      <meta name="citation_abstract" content="A general scheme for biogenesis of Fe-S clusters in mammalian cells. (A) NFS1 is a cysteine desulfurase that forms a dimer to which monomers of the primary scaffold protein ISCU bind near the top and bottom of the complex. In eukaryotes, ISD11 is an obligate binding partner for NFS1. NFS1 also binds the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (not shown). Structural and biochemical studies suggest that frataxin forms part of the initial Fe-S cluster biogenesis complex, potentially occupying a pocket between NFS1 and ISCU. NFS1 donates inorganic sulfur, and cysteines from ISCU provide the sulfur ligands that directly bind iron in the nascent Fe-S cluster. A highly reduced protein such as ferredoxin probably provides needed electrons. (B) Once the Fe-S cluster is assembled, it must be transferred to recipient proteins. Work in bacteria and yeast model systems suggests that a dedicated chaperone–co-chaperone pair of proteins participates in cluster transfer from the primary scaffold, ISCU, to recipient Fe-S proteins. The co-chaperone is known to be HSC20 (a DNAJ protein), whereas the chaperone is an HSP70 homolog that has not yet been clearly identified in mammalian cells. The role of a putative HSC70 protein is proposed here. HSC20 binds ISCU, and the HSC20-ISCU complex probably then binds to its HSC70 partner through two different binding sites: HSC20 contacts the N-terminus of HSC70 and its binding partner, ISCU, binds to the C-terminal substrate-binding domain region of HSC70. The J domain region of HSC20 contains three residues [His (H) Pro (P) and Asp (D); HPD] that activate the ATPase activity of HSC70. Upon activation, a conformational change is proposed to occur in the substrate-binding domain of HSC70 that affects bound ISCU, resulting in extrusion of a peptide containing the residues LPPVK from the ISCU globular protein. The LPPVK peptide then binds to a groove in the substrate-binding domain of HSC70, which consolidates or perhaps further enhances the conformational change in ISCU, which might convert it to a conformation that facilitates donation of its cluster to recipient proteins. In this model, HSC20 helps protect the vulnerable Fe-S cluster bound to ISCU as it dissociates from the multimeric assembly complex, and HSC20 then escorts ISCU to form a trimeric complex with HSC70. The consumption of ATP probably provides a powerful impetus to drive conformational changes of ISCU and the substrate-binding domain of HSC70; these changes might facilitate release of the Fe-S cluster from ISCU. By capturing the energy released by ATP hydrolysis and coupling it to conformational changes, the chaperone–co-chaperone pair help the Fe-S cluster to reach its target proteins. Target proteins could include some direct targets, or proteins such as NFU1, BOLA3, NUBPL or GLRX5 that might function as intermediary scaffolds that then donate Fe-S clusters to specific subsets of recipient proteins.

    A general scheme for biogenesis of Fe-S clusters in mammalian cells. (A) NFS1 is a cysteine desulfurase that forms a dimer to which monomers of the primary scaffold protein ISCU bind near the top and bottom of the complex. In eukaryotes, ISD11 is an obligate binding partner for NFS1. NFS1 also binds the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (not shown). Structural and biochemical studies suggest that frataxin forms part of the initial Fe-S cluster biogenesis complex, potentially occupying a pocket between NFS1 and ISCU.

A highly reduced protein such as ferredoxin probably provides needed electrons. (B) Once the Fe-S cluster is assembled, it must be transferred to recipient proteins. Work in bacteria and yeast model systems suggests that a dedicated chaperone–co-chaperone pair of proteins participates in cluster transfer from the primary scaffold, ISCU, to recipient Fe-S proteins. The co-chaperone is known to be HSC20 (a DNAJ protein), whereas the chaperone is an HSP70 homolog that has not yet been clearly identified in mammalian cells.
