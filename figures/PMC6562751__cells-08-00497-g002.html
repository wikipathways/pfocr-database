Proteins and cellular processes activated (arrows) or inhibited (bar-headed lines) by (A,C) keratins, (B) nestin, and (D) vimentin. (A) Keratins in blue are involved in either activation or inhibition of proteins in black, and upregulate pro-tumorigenic processes in red. For example, K19 enables activation of multiple signaling molecules, including HER2, Src, and Notch for cell proliferation. Alternatively, multiple keratins may converge on a same cellular process as illustrated by regulation of cell migration by K8, K14, K17, K19, and K80 through various signaling molecules, including STAT3, hnRNP K, p38, Erk, and Akt. Processes, such as chemoresistance, that are directly linked to keratins indicate lack of known mediators. (B) Downstream factors and pro-tumorigenic processes in red regulated by nestin. Some of the better-known roles of nestin include maintaining cell stemness through CDK5 inhibition. (C) Keratins in red inhibit proteins in black and downregulate pro-tumorigenic processes in blue. For example, K6 inhibits cell migration by inactivating Src. Interestingly, K19 activates Notch signaling pathway to promote cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinomas but inhibits Notch signaling to suppress proliferation of breast cancer cells. Such a difference exemplifies context-dependent functions of keratins. (D) Downstream factors and pro-tumorigenic processes in red regulated by vimentin. Vimentin is upregulated in cells that have gone through the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and it promotes invasion and migration via activation of Erk and Rac1 signaling pathways.">
