The figure shows a schematic representation of how stimulation of the vascular wall with S1P may lead to modulation of vascular tone. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) express sphingosine kinases (SphK) that catalyse ATP-dependent phosphorylation of sphingosine (Sph) to produce S1P. S1P phosphatases dephosphorylate S1P back into sphingosine. Endothelial cells actively produce and release S1P into blood stream and appear to represent a major source of S1P in vivo, with red blood cells, and to a lesser extent, blood platelets also producing significant quantities of S1P. S1P metabolized by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) may modulate vascular tone as well. In blood, S1P is highly protein-bound and can be found in lipid–protein complexes with high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) or serum albumin. S1P binds to and activates S1P receptors expressed on endothelial cell surface, including S1P1 as well as S1P3 receptor subtypes. In other cell types, S1P has been found also to have intracellular sites of action, but cell surface receptors appear to modulate the principal responses to S1P in vascular cells. Ligand binding of endothelial cell S1P receptors modulates numerous downstream effect or molecules as summarized in the main text, under the control of the small GTP-binding cytoskeleton signalling protein Rac1. These S1P receptor-activated signalling events can lead to the activation of the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), leading to the synthesis of the important vascular messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO). Endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide diffuses to vascular smooth muscle cells, where it binds with and activates the soluble isoform of guanylate cyclase (sGC), which in turn produces the messenger molecule cGMP. cGMP is the key determinant of the vasorelaxation responses evoked by S1P actions in the endothelium. In contrast, S1P is also able to bind with and activate S1P receptors expressed on the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells, including the S1P2 as well as S1P3 receptor subtypes. In vascular smooth muscle cells, ligand binding of S1P receptors leads to the activation of the small G-protein RhoA and its effector molecules, including Rho-associated protein kinase (ROK), as well as some isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC). Activation of the RhoA/ROK/PKC pathway by vascular smooth muscle cells S1P receptors ultimately leads to vasoconstriction responses by mechanisms summarized in the main text. Thus, the overall effects of S1P of blood vessels in regulation of vascular tone take place in a highly context-dependent manner based on the balance responses modulated by endothelial cells vs. vascular smooth muscle cells, and the differential roles of Rac1/NO/cGMP vs. RhoA/ROK/PKC pathways. The effects of S1P on vascular tone can vary significantly between different vascular beds and different animal species; key experimental variables can influence S1P-mediated vascular responses, as vasoconstriction and vasorelaxation responses can be importantly affected by the S1P concentrations being studied, the specific S1P receptor subtype expression profiles present under different conditions, as well as other factors.
