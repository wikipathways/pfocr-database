(A) EC and regulation of vascular tone. The regulation of vascular tone is obtained through the balanced production of vasodilators and vasoconstrictors in response to a variety of stimuli., The left side of (A) shows the main mechanisms involved in vasodilatation: Nitric oxide (NO) is the predominant mediator of normal vascular function and is generated from L-arginine through endothelial NO synthase (NOS). When released by the endothelium, NO diffuses in the vessel wall, to the vascular SMC, and activates guanylate cyclase causing SMC relaxation. Another endothelium-derived vasodilator is prostacyclin (PGI2), generated by cyclooxygenase (COX) and arachidonic acid metabolism. PGI2 activates adenylate cyclase with subsequent generation of cAMP and final relaxation of the underlying smooth muscle cells. NO and PGI2 have also important antiplatelet effects, as they limit aggregation; both of them are involved in the inhibition of coagulation, inflammation, and smooth muscle cells proliferation. The right side of (A) shows the main mechanisms involved in vasoconstriction. The main vasoconstrictive factor is Endothelin (ET), an endothelium-derived 21-amino-acid peptide (the ET family consists of three structurally related peptides, ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3). The product of ET transcription is prepro-ET, which is cleaved by a neutral endopeptidase to form the active precursor pro-ET. Pro-ET may be released from the non-luminal surface of the endothelial cells and converted to mature ET by the membrane-bound metalloproteinase endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE). The two ET receptors, both coupled to G proteins, are endothelin A (ETA) receptor, situated on the vascular SMC, and endothelin B (ETB) receptor, located on endothelial cells. Binding to ETA receptor stimulates phospholipase C initiating in turn events leading eventually to SMC contraction. The result of ET binding to ETB receptor on endothelial cells is the release of NO and PGI2, which opposes the vasoconstricting action of ET. ET also exert mitogenic activity on SMC (not shown in picture). Many factors stimulating ET synthesis, such as thrombin and angiotensin II, also cause the release of vasodilatator PG12 and/or NO, which oppose the vasoconstricting action of ET. (B) Endothelial cells and coagulation and fybrinolysis. The major antiplatelet agents secreted by endothelial cells are PGI2 and NO. In the quiescent state, endothelial cells maintain blood fluidity by promoting the activity of numerous anticoagulant pathways, the most important being the protein C/protein S pathway (PC/PS), which is initiated when thrombin interacts with the endothelial cell receptor thrombomodulin (TM), facilitating activation of protein C. Activated protein C (aPC) inactivates two cofactors essential for blood coagulation: factors VIIIa and Va. To be effective, protein C must form a complex with protein S, which is synthesized by endothelial cells. Complex formation between thrombin and thrombomodulin also prevents thrombin from being able to clot fibrinogen or to activate platelets. Moreover, the endothelial cell surface is rich in heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (HSPG) to which antithrombin (AT) is bound thus providing the main site for inactivation of active thrombin. Endothelial cells also synthesize tissue factor (TF) pathway inhibitor and participates in fibrinolysis by releasing tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase, allowing the transformation of plasminogen into plasmin, which degrades thrombi by digesting fibrin network. t-PA is constitutively released while urokinase is only synthesized by activated endothelial cells. The natural inhibitor of t-PA, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is also constitutively secreted by endothelial cells. The balance of t-PA and PAI-1, which is normally in favor of PAI-1 is also altered by (continued) Figure 1. Continued. cytokines, again in a way that is procoagulant. After activation, the balance of endothelial properties can be tipped to favor platelet aggregation and clot formation through coordinate induction of procoagulant/prothrombotic factors and suppression of anticoagulant mechanisms. Operating in coordination, these changes can allow fibrin formation and platelet activation to proceed in an inflamed focus. At least two mediators released by activated endothelial cells favor platelet activation. The first one is the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF), synthesized by endothelial cells stimulated by thrombin, histamine, or cytokines. Most of the produced PAF remains membrane associated. PAF is a potent platelet activator and can promote platelet adhesion to endothelial cells. The second is the von Willebrand factor (vWF) of which endothelial cells are the major source. vWF is constitutively secreted into the plasma and the subendothelial matrix. It is also stored in high amount in intracellular Weibel–Palade bodies, which can be mobilized rapidly in response to agonists like thrombin. Endothelial cells do not normally express the primary trigger of the coagulation system, TF. However, when exposed to thrombin, cytokines, or lipopolysaccharides (LPS), endothelial cells synthesize and express TF at their surface. Once coagulation has been initiated, endothelial cells promote thrombi activation since the activity of factor Xa (generated by TF plus factor VII) is locally enhanced by promotion of binding with its cofactor Va at adjacent Xa and Va receptors on the endothelial cell surface. Thrombin is the main effector protease of the coagulation cascade. Factor Xa, activated by factor VIIa and TF, converts prothrombin into active thrombin. This protease converts circulating fibrinogen into fibrin monomer, which polymerizes to form fibrin, the fibrous matrix of blood clot. In endothelial cells, thrombin causes vWF release, the appearance of P-selectin at the plasma membrane, production of PAF and chemokines. Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) and thrombin–antithrombin (TAT) complexes may be measured to assess thrombin activation. Endothelial cells also change shape and show increased permeability. All together, these changes initiate a proinflammatory and procoagulation situation. Thrombin similarly activates platelets. (C) Endothelial cells, inflammation, repair, and remodeling. Endothelial factors involved in the phase of increased vascular permeability include NO, prostaglandins, and platelet activating factor (PAF). Endothelial cells are also the ‘gatekeepers’ of the cell recruitment in inflammation. (C) Left side depicts the main events involved in the recruitment of leukocytes from the circulation into the extravascular space, critical for inflammatory responses, and repair of tissue injury. Once activated, endothelial cells express adhesion molecules on their surfaces thus allowing the binding to reciprocal molecules on the surfaces of circulating leukocytes. Finally, chemotactic factors attract leukocytes along a chemical gradient to the site of injury. Adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte recruitment include four molecular families which are selectins, addressins, integrins, and immunoglobulins. P-selectin is preformed and stored within Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells and α-granules of platelets, allowing the rapid transportation to the cell surface, upon stimulation and thus the rapid adhesive interaction between endothelial cells and leukocytes. E-selectin is not expressed on quiescent endothelial cell surfaces but is induced by inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines or bacterial LPS. L-selectin is mainly expressed on leukocytes. Vascular addressins are mucin-like glycoproteins expressed on the surface of endothelial cells as well as leukocytes. They possess sialyl-Lewis X, which binds the lectin domain of selectins. Their functions include regulation of localization of leukocytes and are involved in lymphocyte activation. Vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), together with intercellular adhesion molecules 1 and 2 (ICAM-1, ICAM-2), are adhesion molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) is a member of the Ig superfamily expressed on the surface, at intercellular junctions, of unstimulated endothelial cells, as well as on other types of cells including circulating leukocytes, which is important for the passage of leukocyte across the endothelium. The interaction between endothelial and leukocyte PECAM-1 is fundamental for transmigration. The right side of (C) shows main mechanisms implicated in endothelial repair. Mediators of angiogenesis are growth factors, among which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most specific for endothelium, cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and extracellular matrix macromolecules, which may influence endothelial proliferation directly or indirectly by means of the stimulation and the production of other angiogenic factors. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) are hematopoietic stem cells with limited pluripotent potential, mainly involved in formation of new vessels after ischemia and in repairing damaged endothelium. Circulating progenitors cells (CPCs) are more undifferentiated bone marrow-derived cells, involved in damaged brain repair. Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) are mature endothelial cells released from the intima after vascular damage. In pathologic conditions with endothelial dysfunction, the number of EPC and CPC is reduced, while CEC levels are increased.
