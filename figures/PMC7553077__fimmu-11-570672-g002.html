Engineered T cells in the B2M gene have lowered HLA class I antigen expression on the cell surface and have reduced the possibility of graft rejection. TCR/CD3 cells have been knocked out to reduce GVHD and to enable physiological CAR expression, thus enhancing CAR T potency. Tumor-suppressive microenvironments have been overcome by downregulating CTLA-4, PD1, and LAG-3. T cells have also been engineered to ignore suppressive signals by expressing dominant negative TGF beta receptors (TGBR2). On the other hand, to engraft T cells under lymphodepleting preparative conditions, the elimination of CD52 is required to enable T cells to resist alemtuzumab-mediated lymphodepletion.
