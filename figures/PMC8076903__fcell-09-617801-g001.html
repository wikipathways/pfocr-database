(A) Anti-tumorigenic TRPs-mediated signaling pathways in gliomas. Cartoon depicting TRP channels signaling pathways suppressing gliomas progression through the inhibition of pro-tumorigenic pathways (in red) and/or the activation of anti-tumorigenic signaling pathways (in green). TRPM2 and TRPML1 upon ROS activation promote cell apoptosis through an increase in oxidative stress and intracellular Ca2+ concentration; due to its localization on the lysosomal membrane TRPML1 may also mediates the autophagic cell death pathway through the interaction with HSP; TRPA1 under hypoxia promotes apoptosis inducing ROS formation and inhibiting antioxidants such as GSH; TRPV1 upon stimulation with CPS triggers the apoptotic pathway through p38 MAPK and reduces glioma expansion via ER pathway in a ATF3-dependent manner; TRPV2 reduces cell proliferation and enhances the Fas-induced apoptosis in an ERK-dependent manner; TRPV2 also acts on cell differentiation since its overexpression is associated with GFAP and βIII-tubulin increased expression and its activation by CBD promotes Aml-1 up-regulation via PI3K/AKT pathway; finally, TRPV2 activation by CBD can improve cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents favoring drug uptake. (B) Pro-tumorigenic TRPs-mediated signaling pathways in gliomas. Cartoon depicting TRP channels signaling pathways promoting gliomas progression through the activation of pro-tumorigenic pathways (in red) and/or the inhibition of anti-tumorigenic signaling pathways (in green). TRPC1 affects cell growth and cell proliferation mainly promoting cytokinesis in response to lipid activation, whereas upon stimulation with growth factors it induces chemotactic migration; TRPC6 affects cell proliferation, tumor growth and angiogenesis likely through the Ca2+-induced activation of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway, whereas TRPC6 effects on cell migration might rather involve Rho activation and subsequent actin cytoskeleton rearrangements; TRPV4 promotes cell migration and tumor invasiveness through the AKT-mediated Rac1 activation; TRPM8 supports glioma progression by inhibiting apoptosis through MAPK pathway and impairing the cell cycle through the activation of BK channels and the subsequent CaMKII-mediated inhibition of phosphatases like Cdc25C and Cdc2; TRPM8 effects on cell migration/invasion are also associated with BK channels activation and the function of TRPM8 in aggressiveness and resistance to treatment may also be potentiated by TKR-mediated HGF/SF stimulation; TRPM7 increases glioma cell proliferation and invasion through the down-regulation of miR-28-5p and the subsequent up-regulation of oncogenic signaling pathways involving AKT, ERK, IGF-1 and Rap1b; TRPM7 effects on glioma proliferation may also be mediated by Notch and/or JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways and through the activation of STAT3; TRPM7 might also be involved in GSC renewal and differentiation thanks to the up-regulation of the well-known GSC marker ALDH1; the hypermethylation of TRPM3 promoter through the down-regulation of miR-204 enhances cell migration; TRPML2 enhances cell proliferation and slows down apoptosis improving DNA repair and inhibiting Caspase 3 likely through PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 pathways.
