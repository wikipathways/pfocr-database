Despite finding no evidence for the activation of complement in our study, complement proteins have several well-known functions which are likely to contribute to HS pathogenesis. This figure illustrates the mechanisms of activation and regulation of the complement cascade and outlines how it’s effector functions could fit into the pathogenesis of HS. The complement cascade can be activated by three different pathways: the classical, lectin and alternative pathway. The classical pathway is triggered by antibody-antigen complexes, cell particles and acute phase proteins binding to C1 (consisting of C1q, C1r, and C1s), and is therefore more likely to play a more prominent role in later stages of the diseases. Activation of the lectin pathway occurs through the binding of the complex of mannose-binding lectin or ficolins to PAMPs or DAMPs released from dilated and ruptured follicles and tunnels. Both pathways result in the activation of C4 and C2, to form the C3 convertase, C4b2a. The alternative pathway depends on constitutive spontaneous low-grade hydrolysis of C3, ultimately forming the alternative C3-convertase C3bBb. All pathways converge on the cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b forms a C5 convertase by combining with previous C3 convertases initiating the terminal complement pathway by cleaving of C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b forms a complex with C6 and C7, which is inserted in the cell membrane. Subsequently, C8 and multiple C9 molecules bind to this complex, resulting in a fully functional MAC (C5b-9) capable of lysing for example bacteria expelled from ruptured follicles and tunnels or direct attack on epithelial cells. C3a and C5a are potent anaphylatoxins resulting in increased vessel permeability and further attracting monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells and T cells (C5a) to the HS lesion. These cells are also capable of locally producing complement components. In addition, interaction of C3a with C3aR and C5a with C5aR1 induces macrophages to secrete HS associated pro-inflammatory cytokines, increases proliferation of T cells, and promotes Th1 and Th17 expansion, cell types that play prominent role in HS pathogenesis. In addition, regulatory T-cell generation and function are decreased by C3a and C5a (not shown in figure). Activation of neutrophils leads to the release of prostaglandins, reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, and MMP-9. The latter potentially aiding the characteristic HS tissue destruction. Two therapies, vilobelimab and avacopan, aimed neutralizing C5a and blocking C5aR1 respectively, have shown promising preliminary results in HS. Bacterial opsonization with (i)C3b facilitates phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils and has been shown to stimulate NETosis. Prominent NET formation found in chronic HS lesions could be contributing to further complement activation through for example MPO and cathepsin G depositions on extruded NETs which are able to respectively cleave C3 and C5. Recognition of C3dg-coated bacteria by antigen-specific B-cell receptors and CR2 lower the threshold of B cell activation and promotes antibody production. Local secretion of antibodies may in turn aid activation of the classical pathway.
