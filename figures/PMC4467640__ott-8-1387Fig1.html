Inhibition or activation of potential sites could be used for therapeutic intervention in anticancer treatment. The ECM proteins and proteoglycans, directly or after binding to integrin receptors, through PI3K/AKT/mTOR (yellow) and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (purple) pathways, significantly influence cell proliferation, apoptosis, and response to chemotherapeutic drug. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a role in regulation of p53 activity and apoptosis and controls critical proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation and migration. The pathway is also connected to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, among many others. As a response to ECM biopolymers, the mTOR kinase regulates translation of protein synthesis of some key molecules such as cyclin D1, p27, pRb, and c-Myc. mTOR inhibitors suppress the translation of mRNAs involved in cell growth and migration. The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway can also be activated by ECM components. Phosphorylated ERKs get activated and will be translocated into the nucleus, where they phosphorylate further transcription proteins, such as Fos, Elk-1, CREB, and Gata-1. These transcription factors bind to promoter regions of many genes, like growth factor and cytokine genes, which are important in promotion of growth and prevention of apoptosis in case of different cell types. Mutations in the tumor often activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways. Inhibitors targeting these pathways could be successfully combined with chemotherapeutic drugs and/or radiotherapy that inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.","license":"CC0","name":"CreativeWork","creator":{"@type":"Organization","name":"WikiPathways"},"keywords":["Agrn","Vegfa","Fgf2","Ilk","Crk","Grap2","Syp","Mapk14","Ahsa1","ras","Hras","Kras","Rem1","Pik3r1","Pdk1","Pdpk1","Ppp2ca","Ppp2r1a","Zhx2","Mapkapk2","Pten","Mdk","Bad","Cdkn1b","Dctn6","Psmd9","Bcl2l11","Jun","Hspb2","Ephb2","Mapk1","Akt1","Akt2","Tsc1","Rheb","Atp7a","Gsk3b","Myc","Nol3","Mdm2","Mtor","Nfkb1","Ccnd1","Hif1a","Eif4ebp1","Rps6kb1","Trp53","Eif4e","AGRN","SDC1","COL6A1","COL6A2","COL6A3","COL6A5","COL6A6","COL7A1","COL8A1","COL8A2","COL9A1","COL9A2","COL9A3","COL10A1","COL11A1","COL11A2","COL12A1","COL13A1","COL14A1","COL15A1","COL16A1","COL17A1","COL18A1","COL19A1","COL20A1","COL21A1","COL22A1","COL23A1","COL24A1","COL25A1","COL26A1","COL27A1","COL28A1","COL1A1","COL1A2","COL4A1","COL4A2","COL4A3","COL4A4","COL4A5","COL4A6","COL5A1","COL5A2","COL5A3","VEGFA","VEGFB","VEGFC","VEGFD","PGF","PDGFA","PDGFB","PDGFC","PDGFD","FGF2","ITGA1","ITGA10","ITGA11","ITGA2","ITGA2B","ITGA3","ITGA4","ITGA5","ITGA6","ITGA7","ITGA8","ITGA9","ITGAD","ITGAE","ITGAL","ITGAM","ITGAV","ITGAX","ITGB1","ITGB2","ITGB3","ITGB4","ITGB5","ITGB6","ITGB7","ITGB8","ITGBL1","ILK","MAPK9","CRK","MAPK14","MAPK1","AIMP2","GRAP2","AHSA1","POLDIP2","MAPK11","MAPK12","MAPK13","KRAS","HRAS","NRAS","PIK3CA","PIK3CB","PIK3CD","PIK3CG","PIK3R3","PIK3R4","PIK3R5","PIK3R6","PIK3R1","PIK3R2","MAPK3","MAPK8","MAPK10","PDK1","PDPK1","PTPA","ZHX2","ARAF","BRAF","RAF1","MAPKAPK2","PTEN","MAP2K7","MAP2K1","MAP2K2","BAD","IFI27","PSMD9","ZNRD2","DCTN6","TMED7","H3P23","FOXO1","FOXO3","FOXO4","FOXO6","BCL2L11","NFATC1","NFATC2","NFATC3","NFATC4","NFAT5","FOS","FOSB","JUN","JUNB","JUND","FOSL1","FOSL2","HSPB1","HSPB2","EPHB2","AKT1","AKT2","AKT3","TSC1","CCL26","RHEB","RHEBP1","ATP7A","GSK3A","GSK3B","MYC","MDM2","MTOR","NFKB1","RELA","RELB","REL","NFKB2","CCND1","HIF1A","EIF4EBP1","MMP1","MMP2","MMP3","MMP7","MMP8","MMP9","MMP10","MMP11","MMP12","MMP13","MMP14","MMP15","MMP16","MMP17","MMP19","MMP20","MMP21","MMP23B","MMP24","MMP25","MMP26","MMP27","MMP28","RPS6KB1","RPS6KB2","TP53","TP63","TP73","SETD2","ARNT","EIF4E","EIF4E2","EIF4E3","pdk-1","akt-1","akt-2","gsk-3","hif-1","LanB1","LanA","LanB2","Pvf1","Pvf2","Pvf3","Pvr","scb","lic","p38b","Nurf-38","Ebp","p38a","Hrb87F","p38c","Ras64B","Ras85D","Pi3K21B","Pi3K59F","Pi3K68D","Pi3K92E","MKP-4","rl","wrd","wdb","mts","tws","Pp2A-29B","Raf","MAPk-Ak2","Dsor1","Mtk","cass","DCTN6-p27","dap","CG9588","foxo","NFAT","AP-1gamma","Jra","kay","Hsp27","Erk7","Akt","lok","sgg","Tor","Dif","dl","Rel","sima","Thor","Mmp1","S6k","p53","betaTub60D","hth","tgo","eIF4E1","eIF4E7","eIF4E4","eIF4E5","eIF4E3","eIF4E6","eIF4EHP","Cancer","Cardiomyopathy","Lung cancer","Noonan syndrome"]}
