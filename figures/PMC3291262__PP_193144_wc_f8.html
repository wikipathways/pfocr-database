      <meta name="citation_abstract" content="A model for PG function in plastid metabolism and short- and long-term photo response and adaptation. The physical connectivity of the PG and thylakoid permit extensive exchange of metabolites between the two subcompartments and possibly also facilitate the recruitment of proteins from the thylakoid-stroma-exposed surface to the PG. During times of high lipid or protein turnover (such as senescence, stress, or plastid biogenesis), the role of the PG becomes especially pertinent. We illustrate here some of the proposed functions of the PG in these processes. Turnover of galactolipids by DAD1-like acylhydrolases will release free fatty acids transported to the PG, where they can (1) be incorporated into triacylglycerol (TAG) by diacyl glycerol acyl transferase 3 and 4 (DGAT3/4), (2) enter the jasmonic acid synthesis pathway, in the case of linolenic acid (18:3), or (3) be esterified to free phytol into fatty acid phytyl esters (FAPEs) during concurrent chlorophyll degradation. Alternatively, the free phytol can be recycled for incorporation into tocopherols by two subsequent phytol kinases, the first of which has been identified (VTE5; ). During chlorophyll degradation, the tetrapyrrole head group is captured by the PG-localized SOUL/heme-binding protein (SOUL/HBP) and delivered for further degradation to the stroma. We predict that the four PG oxidoreductases (NDC1, AKRed, and FRed1 and -2) are active in rereducing oxidized lipophilic compounds sequestered in the PG. Supporting this, NDC1 has recently been demonstrated to display NAD(P)H reductase activity toward a PQ-9 analog (decyl-PQ; ). We expect that NDC1 and the other PG oxidoreductases are responsible for the regeneration of oxidized PG quinones following reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. PQ-9 is expected to be exchanged between the PG and thylakoid. Selective uptake of reduced (or oxidized) PQ-9 would permit a powerful control over the redox state of PQ-9 in the thylakoid and thus over a number of processes regulated by the PQ-9 redox state, including photosynthetic electron flow, retrograde signaling, carotenoid desaturation, and light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) state transition. The presence of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 4 (CCD4) suggests the presence of carotenoid catabolism at the PG. Carotenoids released from the photosynthetic apparatus (photosystems and light-harvesting complexes) can be directed to the PG by FBN4 (or other FBNs) for degradation by CCD4. ABC1K9, positioned as a hub in module 4 (), is regulating the localization or function of FBNs and Trxs as well as components of the cyclic electron flow apparatus (NDH and/or PGR5 dependent). FBNs will be controlling the size of PGs (dashed arrow), while Trxs will control Calvin cycle activity to match the supply of reducing power produced from photosynthesis. Increased Calvin cycle activity will create additional demand for ATP that can be met by up-regulated cyclic electron flow (CEF), either NDH or PGR5 dependent (, ). Metabolites are enclosed in gray boxes, PG-localized proteins are marked in red, and coexpressers are marked in blue. Abbreviations used and not already defined are as follows: zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), state transition kinase (STN7), phytoene desaturase (PDS), ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS), 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), plastochromanol-8 (PC-8), lipoxygenase (LOX), 9,13-hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic acid (9-,13-HPOT), allene oxide synthase (AOS), pheophytinase (PPH), metal-chelating substance (MCS*) possibly represented by AT5G17450, pheophorbide a (pheide a), 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), abscisic acid (ABA), red chlorophyll catabolite (RCC), red chlorophyll catabolite reductase (RCCR), and primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite (pFCC).">
