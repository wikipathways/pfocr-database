    As shown in (a), ENSMUST00000181536 (Snhg19) correlated with 222 protein-coding genes, and the enrichment analysis showed that Snhg18 may be related to leukocyte transendothelial migration, phagosome, glutathione metabolism, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, focal adhesion, Fc epsilon RI signalling pathway, cell adhesion molecules, apoptosis, and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis. As shown in (b), ENSMUST00000150851 (Meg3) correlated with 200 protein-coding genes, and KEGG enrichment analysis pointed out that it may participate in sphingolipid metabolism, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, glycosaminoglycan degradation, complement and coagulation cascades, adherens junction, leukocyte transendothelial migration, galactose metabolism, haematopoietic cell lineage, chemokine signalling pathway, p53 signalling pathway, B cell receptor signalling pathway, Fc epsilon RI signalling pathway, ABC transporters, mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, and apoptosis. As shown in (c), ENSMUST00000129245 (Meg3) correlated with 169 protein-coding genes, that enriched to dozens of KEGG pathway, such as gap junction, ABC transporters, peroxisome, glutathione metabolism, GnRH signalling pathway, complement and coagulation cascades, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling pathway, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, phagosome, tryptophan metabolism, fatty acid degradation, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, Notch signalling pathway, ribosome, and toll-like receptor signalling pathway. KEGG analysis revealed that two lncRNA transcripts were both related to ABC transporters and complement and coagulation cascades, although these two transcripts did not share the same gene of interaction. As shown in (d), ENSMUST00000136359 (H19) correlated with 169 protein-coding genes, including vitamin digestion and absorption, galactose metabolism, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, retinol metabolism, phagosome, gap junction, arachidonic acid metabolism, butanoate metabolism, complement and coagulation cascades, antigen processing and presentation, PPAR signalling pathway, ABC transporters, Notch signalling pathway, bile secretion, and MAPK signalling pathway.
