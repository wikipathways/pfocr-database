Ras signalling affects many cellular functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, fate specification, and differentiation. Ras is a membrane-anchored GTPase that is normally activated in response to the binding of extracellular ligands, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), to a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Under normal physiological conditions, the EGFR kinase domain is intrinsically autoinhibited. EGF binding to the extracellular domain transmits a signal which propagates through the transmembrane domain resulting in EGFR dimerization and activation. EGFR activation results from the formation of an asymmetric dimer in which the C-terminal lobe of one kinase domain plays a role analogous to that of cyclin in activated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/cyclin complexes (). Signalling proceeds through SHC-transforming protein 1 (SHC), Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and Son of sevenless (SOS). SOS1, the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway, is recruited by the adaptor protein Grb2 in response to EGFR activation. Under physiological conditions, Ras is in its inactive GDP-bound state. GEF exchanges GDP for GTP and by so doing activates Ras. Active, GTP-loaded Ras binds monomeric Raf, thereby leading to Raf dimerization, which is the active form of Raf (see ). Ras activates a number of signalling pathways, including the Raf/MAPK kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Raf/MEK/ERK) pathway, the MEK kinase/SAPK-ERK kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase (MEKK/SEK/JNK) pathway, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) Akt for proliferation, and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) pathway which is mostly related to inflammation. There are three major Ras forms, K-Ras, H-Ras and N-Ras, which largely differ in their hypervariable region (HVR), and in their lipophilic post-translational modification (PTM) group, farnesyl, palmitoyl, prenyl, etc. Calmodulin inhibits K-Ras signalling, but not H-Ras or N-Ras. Ras cofactors, and proteins in their pathways, are partners of the Ras GTPase-activating-like protein (IQGAP1) scaffolding protein. IQGAP1 is a large multi-domain protein with tens of partners already identified. Cytoskeleton proteins actin and myosin, as well as other proteins, are also partners of IQGAP1. Some of these proteins are scaffolding proteins too, including actin which itself also has tens of partners. Further, like Ras, some of these proteins are also anchored in the membrane, including Raf (see ) and actin. Ras acts as a binary signal switch cycling between ON and OFF states. Ras returns to its OFF state via GTP→GDP hydrolysis with the help of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP). GDP-bound Ras is unable to bind its effectors. IQGAP1 binds to and regulates the function of numerous proteins. Over 90 proteins have been reported to associate with IQGAP1, directly or as part of a larger complex (). Most of the binding is to the IQ or C-terminal regions. Some proteins interact with expected binding motifs, such as actin to the CHD, and calmodulin and S100 to the IQ motifs. Unfortunately, no structure is available for complexes of any of IQGAP1 protein partners with the respective IQGAP1 domain. As the figure illustrates, IQGAP1 is also a scaffold in the MEK/ERK cascade. It binds to both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 and modulates their activation to proximal Raf. There are three Raf kinases, A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf. IQGAP1 binds B-Raf, except in the heart where it binds C-Raf. Together with binding Ca2+/calmodulin, it couples Ca2+ to the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. IQGAP1 also binds directly to actin and promotes cross-linking of actin filaments. The dynamic cross-linking through IQGAP1, acting to both increase the effective local concentration and allosterically to coordinate function hints at how higher level cellular regulation takes place; in our case here, it also provides insight into how actin dynamically controls and is controlled by cluster molecules, such as Ras. A cluster consists of multiple copies of each of the proteins, and is highly dynamic persisting only sufficiently long for a burst of signalling activity to go through.
