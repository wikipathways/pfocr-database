      <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Schematic representation of lipid metabolism and the link with epigenetic marks in PCa. PCa cells show an increased uptake of exogenous FAs, which are transported by membrane-bound transporters. PCa cells also have increased de novo FA synthesis. Additionally, intracellular FAs can mobilize via lipid droplet lipolysis. In the cytosol, FAs can either be stored as TAG in lipid droplets or undergo enzymatic conversion to acyl-CoAs, which can enter the mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle system. Inside the mitochondria, acyl-CoAs are broken down through a series of enzymatic reactions known as FAO. The resulting acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle, where it is oxidized for citrate production. Citrate can be transported to the cytosol, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA, which can then be used to synthesize cholesterol by the mevalonate pathway or phospholipids. Exogenous cholesterol can also be obtained as lipoproteins through the receptors LDLR and SB-R1. All these processes generate metabolic intermediates, some of which (white boxes) act as substrates or cofactors of epigenetic enzymes. Specifically, acetyl-CoA is used by HATs to acetylate histones; acyl-CoAs are used by HATs to acylate histones; SIRTs are dependent on NAD+; SAM is used by HMTs and DNMTs to methylate histones and DNA, respectively. Additionally, some SCFAs, such as butyrate, can inhibit HDACs, while some LCFAs can enhance sirtuin activity. Dotted lines correspond to metabolites that are transported or diffused through membranes (a different coloured line for the each metabolite). Underlined enzymes correspond to enzymes whose expression can be epigenetically regulated. Enzymes marked with a star (red for metabolic enzymes and black for epigenetic enzymes) are enzymes whose inhibition has an anti-oncogenic effect in PCa.
