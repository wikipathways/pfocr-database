      <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Mitochondrial carnitine shuttle, one-carbon folate metabolism and trans-sulfuration pathway. (4.1) Coenzyme A thioesters (Acyl-CoAs) cannot cross mitochondrial membranes. CPT1a facilitates the transfer of the acyl group from CoA to carnitine. Acyl-carnitines are permeable to the outer mitochondrial membrane, but not the inner mitochondrial membrane, requiring the transport via carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) to reach the mitochondrial matrix. Once in the matrix, CPT2 converts the acyl-carnitine back to an acyl-CoA, which can then undergo FAO (see ). The released carnitine is then transported back across the inner mitochondrial membrane by CACT to be reused in the cytosol. (4.2) Non-esterified fatty acids of 12 or less carbons do not require the carnitine shuttle system, and can diffuse across both mitochondrial membranes. However, they still require esterification to CoA by mitochondrial ACS before they can be metabolized by FAO. (4.3) The carnitine shuttle system is regulated by malonyl-CoA, a precursor to FA synthesis which also inhibits CPT1a activity. Malonyl-CoA is principally produced from citrate that is broken into OAA and Ac-CoA in the cytosol by ATP citrate lyase (ACL). The released acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by ACC to malonyl-CoA. ACC is modulated by AMPK, which phosphorylates ACC and reduces its activity. (4.4) The folate pathway supports the transfer of one-carbon units from serine for biosynthetic processes. During this process both MTHFD2(L) and ALDH1L2 generate NADPH, which is essential for mitochondrial redox homeostasis. Despite the bidirectionality of this pathway, most of the cytosolic one-carbon units derived from serine are catabolized in the mitochondria. However, when the mitochondrial folate pathway is lost the directionality of the cytosolic one-carbon flux is reversed to compensate the synthesis of NADPH. (4.5) In the cytosol, MTHFD1 regenerates THF and the intermediate 5,10-methylene-THF links the folate pathway with the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (Met) within the TSP. In the liver and kidney mitochondria, BHMT regenerates Met, linking the mitochondrial oxidation of choline to betaine with the TSP, but the presence of this pathway in brain cells has not been confirmed.">
