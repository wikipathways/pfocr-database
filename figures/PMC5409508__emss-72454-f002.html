Shear stress is transduced through multiple mechanisms, and a few key examples listed here include voltage-gated ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and cell adhesion molecules such as cadherins and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM). These sensors activate classical elements such as the MAPK pathway, which leads to the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 and p38 to act on downstream target genes, and activation of PI3K and PKA. Mechanical strain sensing involves a myriad of receptor tyrosine kinases as well as the Wnt receptor, Frizzled, and an array of integrins. These extracellular mediators can activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, which stimulates mTOR activity. (B) Conventional biological stimuli include cell-ECM and cell-cell interactions, and receptor patterning/clustering. These events exhibit a feedback response: the cell receives specific input from one of these effectors, and in turn changes the signal by altering the composition or organization of the ECM or responds with an additional signal to a neighboring cell and propagating the message into something dynamic. Cell-ECM interactions are dominated by integrins at the cell surface that exert their effect directly on the nucleus via cytoskeletal filaments. Cell-cell interactions act in a similar manner but also include cell adhesion molecules such as cadherins. Receptor patterning occurs naturally in the sense that the spatial distribution of signaling or adhesion molecules affects cell behavior. In a synthetic system, receptors such as Ephrin-B2 can be encouraged to cluster by presenting the ligand at varying density along a physically-linked backbone, which stimulates a stronger response than a single ligand alone; in this case, Ephrin-B2 stimulates the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. (C) Physical material properties at the macro, micro and nano scales include surface topography, cell adhesion and shape, and substrate stiffness. Topography of the material surface, such as the distribution and regularity of nanopit spacing, activates signaling pathways such as JNK and Erk1/2 and affects cytoskeletal tension. Cell adhesion and shape can be controlled by altering the adhesive sites on a synthetic substrate. This effect regulates cell fate decisions in hMSCs through the Rho/ROCK pathway, which is necessary for the activity of the YAP and TAZ transcription factors. Finally, the physical stiffness of the extracellular substrate heavily influences cell behaviors, such as fate decisions, and this signal is also transduced through YAP/TAZ and the actin cytoskeleton.","license":"CC0","name":"CreativeWork","creator":{"@type":"Organization","name":"WikiPathways"},"keywords":["MTOR","CRK","TW","TAZ","ACTB","MYH7B","MYH7","MYH15","MYH10","MYH9","RHO","OPN1MSW","ITGB3","PCDH11X","arm","Akt","MKP-4","p38b","rl","Mtor","Tor","Pka-C1","Pka-R2","Pka-C3","Pka-R1","Pka-C2","lic","Nurf-38","Ebp","AIMP2","p38a","Hrb87F","p38c","tw","yki","Taz","Dis3","CkIIbeta","Andorra","Anp","Acam","sun","Tsp42Ej","Rok","Act5C","Act42A","Act57B","Act79B","Act88F","Act87E","sqh","Mhc","Mlc2","zip","rho","Bx","Rho1","Lcp65Ab1","bsk","Pi3K21B","Pi3K59F","Pi3K68D","Pi3K92E","scb","Ephrin","Prosbeta2","betaTub85D","nAChRbeta2","fz","LanB1","LanA","LanB2","AKT1","AKT2","AKT3","MAPK1","MAPK3","MAPK11","MAPK12","MAPK13","MAPK14","MAPK8","MAPK9","MAPK10","PRKAR1A","PRKAR1B","PRKAR2A","PRKAR2B","PRKACA","PRKACB","PRKACG","GRAP2","AHSA1","POLDIP2","YAP1","TAFAZZIN","WWTR1","ROCK1","ROCK2","ACTA1","ACTA2","ACTC1","ACTG1","ACTG2","MYH14","MYO6","MYO10","MYO16","MYO19","MYH1","MYH11","MYH13","MYH16","MYH2","MYH3","MYH4","MYH6","MYH8","MYO1A","MYO1B","MYO1C","MYO1D","MYO1E","MYO1F","MYO1G","MYO1H","MYO3A","MYO3B","MYO5A","MYO5B","MYO5C","MYO7A","MYO7B","MYO9A","MYO9B","MYO15A","MYO15B","MYO18A","MYO18B","MYL1","MYL3","MYL4","MYL6","MYL6B","MYL10","MYL12A","MYL12B","MYL2","MYL5","MYL7","MYL9","MYL11","RHOD","RHOA","RHOB","RHOC","PIK3CA","PIK3CB","PIK3CD","PIK3CG","PIK3R3","PIK3R4","PIK3R5","PIK3R6","PIK3R1","PIK3R2","ITGA1","ITGA10","ITGA11","ITGA2","ITGA2B","ITGA3","ITGA4","ITGA5","ITGA6","ITGA7","ITGA8","ITGA9","ITGAD","ITGAE","ITGAL","ITGAM","ITGAV","ITGAX","ITGB1","ITGB2","ITGB4","ITGB5","ITGB6","ITGB7","ITGB8","ITGBL1","EFNB2","NEUROD1","TUBB4B","CDH1","CDH10","CDH11","CDH12","CDH13","CDH15","CDH16","CDH17","CDH18","CDH19","CDH2","CDH20","CDH22","CDH24","CDH3","CDH4","CDH5","CDH6","CDH7","CDH8","CDH9","FZD1","FZD10","FZD2","FZD3","FZD4","FZD5","FZD6","FZD7","FZD8","FZD9","GNAO1","GNAI1","GNAI2","GNAI3","GNAT1","GNAT2","GNAT3","GNAZ","GNAS","GNAL","GNAQ","GNA11","GNA14","GNA15","GNA12","GNA13","Akt1","Mapk3","Mapk1","Crk","Grap2","Syp","Mapk14","Ahsa1","Yap1","Tafazzin","Wwtr1","Rho","Rhod","Ea2","Mapk8","Pik3r1","Hbb-b2","Neurod1","Pecam1","kita","ngfra","mtor","mapk3","mapk14a","tafazzin","rnd2","mapk8b","psmb7","pak2a","itpka","Tyrosine"]}
