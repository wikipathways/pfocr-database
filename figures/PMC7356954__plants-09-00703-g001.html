      <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Interplay between core components of molecular mechanisms controlling seed dormancy and germination with hormones and environmental signals. (A) Hormonal and molecular regulatory networks involved in dormancy and germination. DOG1 increases abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity through sequestration of PP2Cs (AHG1/3) and genetically interacts with ABI3 to ensure ABA signaling during seed maturation and the establishment of dormancy. DOG1 expression is regulated by ethylene (ETH) signaling through the ETR1/ERF12 pathway and has an impact on dormancy release through the control of two antagonistic miRNAs. Other hormones such as auxin (AUX) by the ARF10/16 pathway and karrikins (KR) have a role in dormancy by altering ABA content or signaling. ABI5 plays a key role in ABA signaling to repress germination. ABI5 expression is upregulated under conditions unfavorable for germination by several TFs (ABA-related TFs or NF-YC3/4/9). Negative feedback by RAV1 and WRKY18/40/60 or conditions promoting germination counteract this upregulation. Also, other hormonal signaling pathways (gibberellins, GAs; brassinosteroids, BRs; cytokinins, CKs) interfere with ABI5-mediated transcription or stability through several regulatory proteins (DELLAs, ICE1, BES1, BIN2 or ARR4/5/6). (B) Effects of environmental factors on the regulation of seed dormancy and germination. PIL5 represses germination in the absence of light. It increases the ABA/GA balance partly through direct upregulation of SOM, DELLAs (RGA/GAI) and DAG1 transcription. ABI3/5 and DELLAs also participate in the upregulation of SOM gene transcription. Upon light perception, PIL5 activity is counteracted by different mechanisms mostly mediated by phytochromes (PhyB): increased degradation and reduced transcription in response to higher NO levels and reduced function through HFR1 competitive interaction. NO has also an effect on the stability of class VII ERFs, mediating their degradation and thus reducing ABI5 expression. In addition, activated Phys also reduce DELLA (RGL2) expression and increases its degradation by reducing the expression of circadian genes (RVE1/2). DOG1 integrates temperature cues to regulate dormancy release in fresh-harvested seeds. In dry seeds, SPT negatively regulates germination in the absence of low temperatures. SPT activates ABI5 and represses MFT expression. MFT induces dormancy in fresh seeds but promotes germination in AR seeds, and it is a convergence point between PIL5 and SPT regulation. Pathogen perception triggers DELLA-dependent and GA-independent ABI5 expression to block germination in anticipation of potential seedling damage. Drought and salinity stimulate ABA biosynthesis and induce ABI5 expression, a response mediated by HY5, RSM1 and AGL21 and counteracted by BBX21.">
