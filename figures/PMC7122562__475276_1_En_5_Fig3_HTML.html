Double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), following picornaviral infection, furnish the virus an excellent physical platform for viral RNA assembly and replication. And some picornaviruses, such as PV and coxsackievirus, can spread via extracellular microvesicles (EMVs) in a non-lytic manner between cells. The poliovirus triggered membranes can be specifically induced by the co-expression of two viral proteins, 2BC and 3A. HCV infection prompts the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, which separately increases and decreases the maturation of autophagosomes. And Rubicon can be triggered by HCV NS4B protein alone. IRGM, known to contribute to autophagy, is localized at the Golgi apparatus and regulates the fragmentation of Golgi membranes in response to HCV infection, resulting in co-localization of Golgi vesicles with replicating HCV. Non-structural viral proteins 2B, 2C and 3A with LC3 and viral structural protein VP1 with Atg5, and LC3 with LAMP-1 co-localize in FMDV-infected cells. DENV stimulates and needs AMPK signaling and AMPK-independent suppression of mTORC1 activity for proviral lipophagy. ZIKV NS4A and NS4B, down-regulate cooperatively the Akt-mTOR pathway and induce cellular dysregulation. ZIKV NS3-mediated cleavage of FAM134B blocks the formation of ER and viral protein enriched autophagosomes, and the reticulophagy pathway further. As for HIV, nondegradative stages of autophagy promote its yields at early stage; HIV Gag-derived proteins bind to and interact with LC3, and autophagy enhances productive Gag processing. And when autophagy progresses to the maturation stages, HIV protein Nef plays as an anti-autophagic maturation factor by the interaction with the autophagy regulatory factor Beclin-1, which protects HIV from degradation. The dual and delicate interaction of HIV with the autophagy pathway enhances viral yields by utilizing the early stages while inhibiting the late stages. SARS-CoV and MHV, activate the formation of DMVs. And MHV utilizes the pathway of EDEMosome formation to generate the DMVs. IAV M2 interacts with LC3 and leads to LC3 re-localization. And a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain of IAV is able to block mTOR, activating autophagy. HPIV3 induces incomplete autophagy by blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion, leading to increased virus production. The viral phosphoprotein binds to SNAP29 and suppresses its interaction with syntaxin17, therefore preventing these two host SNARE proteins from mediating autophagosome-lysome fusion. Matrix protein of HPIV3 shuttles to mitochondria and interacts with TUFM. The interaction between M and the LC3 protein that mediates autophagosome formation. These interactions with both TUFM and LC3 are required for the induction of mitophagy and result in inhibition of the type I interferon response. In RV-infected cells, RV NSP4 co-localized with LC3 in cap-like structures associated with viroplasms. And NSP4 enhances the release of calcium from the ER into the cytoplasm, leading to CaMKK-β signaling to trigger autophagy.
