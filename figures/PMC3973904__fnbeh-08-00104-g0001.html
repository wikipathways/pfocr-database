(A) Lipid rafts link cholesterol metabolism to synaptic signaling. Cellular cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl-CoA in a multistep pathway, with HMGCR and SQLE as the rate-limiting enzymes. In the adult brain, cholesterol synthesis is attenuated in neurons that rely on astrocyte derived cholesterol. Cholesterol and ApoE synthesized in astrocytes are secreted in an ABCA1 dependent process, forming discoidal lipoprotein particles. ApoE is a ligand for LDLR family members, which mediate neuronal lipoprotein uptake, thereby providing a supply of cholesterol to neurons. Excess cholesterol is hydroxylated by CYP46A1 to 24-OHC, which diffuses into the circulation. In astrocytes, 24-OHC binds to LXRs, which upregulate ApoE and ABCA1 expression. Cholesterol synthesis is also linked to the mevalonate pathway and produces Farnesyl-PP, which induces protein prenylation, a posttranslational modification that is important for the function of signaling proteins such as Ras and thus modulates protein synthesis. A mutated SQLE attenuates phenotypes of animal model of the ASD Rett syndrome (Buchovecky et al., ). Statins act at HMGCR and benefit animal models of Rett syndrome and other ASDs including fragile X syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 through inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and mevalonate pathway (Li et al., ; Buchovecky et al., ; Osterweil et al., ). Cholesterol is not evenly distributed in cell membranes. Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol. A great number of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins involved in neuronal communication are localized to lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are critical for neurotransmitter release, clustering of postsynaptic signaling molecules, protein trafficking and communication between the cell membrane and cytoplasma. They modulate the function of ionotropic receptors, G protein coupled receptors, voltage-gated ion channels as well as neurotransmitter transporters. Caveolae, a subset of lipid rafts that are flask-shaped membrane invaginations and contain caveolins, is involved in lipid raft protein recycling, sequestration and degradation (Allen et al., ; Pfrieger and Ungerer, ; Sebastiao et al., ). (B) Representative autism linked signaling proteins which are associated with lipid rafts. There is an increasing overlapping between affected signaling molecules or pathways in ASDs and lipid raft associated synaptic proteins as revealed by studies in autism genetics (Huguet et al., ; Murdoch and State, ; Persico and Napolioni, ; Schmunk and Gargus, ; Krumm et al., ; Ronemus et al., ) and neurobiology (Wang et al., , ; Zoghbi and Bear, ; Delorme et al., ; Ebert and Greenberg, ; Won et al., ) as well as research in lipid rafts (Allen et al., ; Korade and Kenworthy, ; Pristera and Okuse, ; Suzuki et al., ; Sebastiao et al., ; Liu et al., ). These studies further support the functional link between lipid rafts and synaptic deficits in ASDs.
