      <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Cholesterol metabolism, lipid rafts and autism spectrum disorders. (A) Lipid rafts link cholesterol metabolism to synaptic signaling. Cellular cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl-CoA in a multistep pathway, with HMGCR and SQLE as the rate-limiting enzymes. In the adult brain, cholesterol synthesis is attenuated in neurons that rely on astrocyte derived cholesterol. Cholesterol and ApoE synthesized in astrocytes are secreted in an ABCA1 dependent process, forming discoidal lipoprotein particles. ApoE is a ligand for LDLR family members, which mediate neuronal lipoprotein uptake, thereby providing a supply of cholesterol to neurons. Excess cholesterol is hydroxylated by CYP46A1 to 24-OHC, which diffuses into the circulation. In astrocytes, 24-OHC binds to LXRs, which upregulate ApoE and ABCA1 expression. Cholesterol synthesis is also linked to the mevalonate pathway and produces Farnesyl-PP, which induces protein prenylation, a posttranslational modification that is important for the function of signaling proteins such as Ras and thus modulates protein synthesis. A mutated SQLE attenuates phenotypes of animal model of the ASD Rett syndrome (Buchovecky et al., ). Statins act at HMGCR and benefit animal models of Rett syndrome and other ASDs including fragile X syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 through inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and mevalonate pathway (Li et al., ; Buchovecky et al., ; Osterweil et al., ). Cholesterol is not evenly distributed in cell membranes. Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol. A great number of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins involved in neuronal communication are localized to lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are critical for neurotransmitter release, clustering of postsynaptic signaling molecules, protein trafficking and communication between the cell membrane and cytoplasma. They modulate the function of ionotropic receptors, G protein coupled receptors, voltage-gated ion channels as well as neurotransmitter transporters.
