      <meta name="citation_abstract" content=". Schematic representation of the mechanisms involved in normal cell cycle control, growth, apoptosis, and cell migration/adhesion that are impaired in cancer development. The targets of these pathways are accessed by scorpion and spider venoms and toxins (described throughout the text). The pathways were presented in a simplified manner and several crosstalk and components were omitted. (A) The control of the cell cycle is regulated by the activity of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and their essential activating coenzymes, the cyclins, and CDKs inhibitors (CDKIs). The phosphoprotein pRb (Rb tumor-suppressor protein) regulates the activity of the E2F transcription factor. Complexes consisting of E2F and hypophosphorylated pRb repress the transcription of the genes required for cell cycle progression. In contrast, phosphorylated pRb (by cyclin/CDK complexes) is unable to bind to E2F, resulting in the activation of E2F-dependent transcription and advancement into the late G1 and S phases. The p53-inducible proteins p21 and p27 (CDKIs) inactivate the cyclin/CDK complexes, leading to the dephosphorylation of pRb and cell cycle arrest. (B) Following activation by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) or G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which binds and recruits protein kinase B (Akt). Akt regulates cell growth by phosphorylation of the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin 1 (mTOR1), which promotes the translation of mRNAs to synthesize proteins. As a catalytic antagonist of PI3K, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) dephosphorylates PIP3 to PIP2. (C) At the top of the figure, the scheme represents the caspase-independent apoptosis mediated by p53. Activated p53 induces apoptosis by transactivating pro-apoptotic genes (e.g., BAX, Bak) and by also directly binding to anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins (e.g., Bcl-2). The p53 protein also activates apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), a factor released from mitochondria to the nucleus, triggering large-scale DNA fragmentation and nuclear chromatin condensation. In the lower part of the figure, the extrinsic and intrinsic canonical caspase-mediated apoptosis are depicted. In the extrinsic pathway, the death receptor-ligand (represented by FAS-Fas ligand - FAS + FASL) binds to the Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), constructing a complex called the death-inducing signaling complex, which activates initiator pro-caspase-8. Caspase-8 activates caspase-3, inducing apoptosis. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is characterized by mitochondrial change in response to various stress signals, such as severe genetic damage, hypoxia, and oxidative stress, which activate the initiator pro-caspase-9. Mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins, BH3-only members, activate other pro-apoptotic proteins, such as BAX, and antagonize anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2). Subsequently, the mitochondrial outer membrane is disrupted, and its permeability increases, resulting in cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) leakage into the cytosol. Cyt-c in cytosol forms a complex with Apaf-1, called the apoptosome, which assists in auto-activation of initiator pro-caspase-9. Caspase-9 activates caspase-3, leading to apoptosis. (D) Ion channels (Na+, K+, Cl−, Ca+) and ion pumps (Na+/K+-ATPase) promote cell migration through their ability to cause volume changes and by interacting with F-actin. Also, channels and pumps interact with integrins, leading to cell adhesion and facilitating migration. See [, , , , ] for a comprehensive review.">
