caption: Model of the Itch/β-arrestin2-dependent regulation of the SuFu/Gli3 complex
  function. When Hh pathway is OFF, Itch, coadjuvated by the protein adaptor β-arrestin2,
  ubiquitylates SuFu. This event does not lead to SuFu degradation, but increases
  the association between SuFu and Gli3. In this way Gli3 is protected from SPOP-dependent
  degradation and is cleaved into a repressor form (Gli3R) that inhibits Hh target
  gene transcription and cell growth. When Hh pathway is switched ON, β-arrestin2
  dissociates from the SuFu/Itch complex, thus abrogating Itch-dependent SuFu ubiquitylation.
  This process induces the dissociation of the Gli3-SuFu complex and impairs Gli3R
  formation, thereby leading to Hh pathway activation and sustained cell growth. Alterations
  in this mechanism, caused by SuFu mutations that make it insensitive to Itch-dependent
  ubiquitylation, are responsible for MB tumorigenesis
