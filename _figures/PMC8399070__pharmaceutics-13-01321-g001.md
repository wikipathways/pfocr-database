caption: 'Pathways of apoptosis. Apoptosis can occur through two pathways: The extrinsic
  or the intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway begins with the binding of extracellular
  ligands to death-promoting receptors, through the Fas-associated death domain adapter
  protein (FADD), then recruits procaspase-8, which in turn activates caspase-8. The
  intrinsic (or mitochondrial) pathway is regulated by a series of specific death-promoting
  molecules released from the mitochondria. Members of the pro- and antiapoptotic
  BCL-2 family compete on the surface of the mitochondria to control the release of
  cytochrome c. The released cytochrome c is associated with Apoptotic protease activating
  factor-1 (Apaf-1) and procaspase-9, which activate caspase-9. The two pathways share
  a common end point at the level of caspase-3 activation. The interaction between
  these pathways occurs through the Bid cleavage triggered by caspase-8. Bid’s interaction
  with Bax or Bak in the outer mitochondrial membrane results in the release of cytochrome
  c. The antiapoptotic BCL-2 family can prevent such a release by direct interaction
  with Bax and/or Bak.'
