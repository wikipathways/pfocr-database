caption: 'Galectin-3 involvement in tumor progression. This figure represents the
  intra-and extracellular galectin-3 functions in processes like cell survival, migration,
  and angiogenesis. (A) In tumor cell, galectin-3 regulates signaling pathways like,
  Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Notch, modulating the cell survival, proliferation, and migration.
  Besides, NFκB and HIF positively regulate galectin-3 expression contributing to
  its function within the tumor microenvironment. (B) Extracellular galectin-3 promotes
  tumor cell migration through interaction with mediators, such as integrins and caveolin,
  leading to FAK stabilization. (C) Regarding angiogenesis, the full-length galectin-3
  can form oligomers and bind to endothelial cell surface, preventing VEGFR and integrin
  internalization. In addition, galectin-3 induces VEGF release by platelets. Furthermore,
  galectin-3 promotes monocyte/macrophage chemotaxis toward tumor microenvironment
  potentializing macrophage-induced angiogenesis. ECM, extracellular matrix. Red full
  arrows: galectin-3 contributes directly to pathway activation. Red dashed arrows:
  possible interaction of galectin-3 in described pathway.'
