caption: Modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by the ubiquitin system. The NLRP3 inflammasome
  relies on both priming and activating signals to be competent in processing pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18 as well as inducing pyroptosis in macrophages. LPS priming upregulates
  the production of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β and FBXO3 through activation of the NF-κB pathway.
  FBXO3 functions to decrease FBXL2 protein levels, which targets NLRP3 for K48-linked
  ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. BRCC3 enhances inflammasome activation
  by removing the K63-linked ubiquitin chains from NLRP3. A20 deubiquitinates and
  thereby limits the maturation of pro-IL-1β. In response to various agonists such
  as ATP and crystals, NLRP3, ASC and pro-caspase-1 assemble into a multisubunit inflammasome
  complex in the cytoplasm. LUBAC and cIAP1/2-TRAF2 assist in NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  through linear and K63-linked ubiquitination of ASC and pro-caspase-1, respectively.
  By contrast, the K63-linked ubiquitination of ASC directs the NLRP3 inflammasome
  for degradation in the autophagosome by binding to the autophagic adaptor p62, ultimately
  resulting in the termination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. ASC, apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a CARD; CARD, caspase activation and recruitment domain;
  cIAP1/2, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1/2; IL, interleukin; LRR, leucine-rich
  repeat; LUBAC, linear Ub chain assembly complex; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain;
  NF-κB; nuclear factor-κB; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6.
