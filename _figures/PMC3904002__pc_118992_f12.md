caption: Model for the Functions of the PS Pathway in Plants.The PS pathway is essential
  for the synthesis of Ser and its derivatives in specific cells of developing embryos
  (A), the SAM (B), and the root (C). Furthermore, at high CO2 levels, the PS pathway
  compensates for Ser biosynthesis via photorespiration and provides 2-oxoglutarate
  for Glu synthesis and subsequently ammonium fixation by the GS/GOGAT cycle (D).
