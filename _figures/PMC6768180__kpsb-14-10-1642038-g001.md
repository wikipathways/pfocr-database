caption: Molecular mechanism of MeJA for anti inflammatory activity.On inflammation
  or tissue injury, the endothelial membrane permeability change and migrates immune
  host cell at the cyte of inflammation or injury. Phospholipids (PLA2 mediated) or
  diacylglycerol (DG lipase-mediated), later Lipooxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase
  (COX) act on eicosanoate and synthesis leukotrienes and prostaglandins (PGH2) and
  PG isomers PGE2 produces inflammation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activates
  NF-κB pathway which further translocated to nucleus and enhance the expression of
  proinflammatory genes for cytokines (IL and TNF-α), iNOS, COX-II. Reactive oxygen
  species (ROS)/reactive oxygen species (RNS) responsible to enhance activity of COX
  and increases synthesis of proinflammatory mediators.
