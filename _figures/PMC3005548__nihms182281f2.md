caption: THC induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells via three different mechanisms. (1)
  THC binds to CB1 and CB2, and leads to ceramide synthesis by serine palmitoyltransferase.
  (2) Ceramide enters the mitochondria and results in cytochrome c leakage into the
  cytosol. (3) Cytochrome c combines with Apaf-1, caspase 9, and forms the apoptosome.
  (4) The apoptosome converts procaspase 3 to active caspase 3, resulting in apoptosis.
  THC also activates the extrinsic pathway (caspases 8 and 10), and inhibits Raf/Mek/Erk
  pathway. The inhibition of the cell survival pathway leads to dephosphorylation
  of Bad, and translocation of this Bcl-2 protein into the mitochondria, and subsequently
  to apoptosis.
