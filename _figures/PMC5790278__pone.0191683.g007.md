caption: In OSCCs, bLF internalizes into cells through LRP1 and suppressed NF-kB p65/Akt
  pathways. The attenuation of p65/Akt by bLF may inhibit G1/S cell cycle through
  the inhibition of downstream signaling pathways including mTOR/S6K and STAT3 and
  induce apoptosis in OSCC. Moreover, SOCS3, which is a negative regulator of STAT3,
  is upregulated. The overexpression of of SOCS3 in OSCC by bLF may downregulate JAK2/STAT3
  pathway leading to the induction of G1/S cell cycle arrest.
