caption: Regulatory mechanism of efferocytosis on microglial neuroinflammation. Abnormal
  activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) drives the transcriptional expression
  of inflammatory factors upon nuclear translocation, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β).
  This dysregulation impairs the efferocytosis function of microglia, thereby exacerbating
  neuroinflammatory responses. Once mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is released into the
  cytoplasm of microglia, it can activate the STING signaling pathway, driving the
  translocation of NF-κB and subsequently inducing the excessive production of pro-inflammatory
  mediators. Exogenous stimuli can promote the sustained activation of the NF-κB pathway
  by activating TRAF6, further amplifying the neuroinflammatory cascade. However,
  the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) can increase the phosphorylation
  of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), thereby blocking the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway reduces NF-κB activity, inhibiting
  neuroinflammation. Furthermore, ERK can activate signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 6 (STAT6), leading to its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation,
  which increases the expression of PPARγ. This, in turn, further promotes the expression
  and release of anti-inflammatory mediators such as arginase-1 (Arg-1) and interleukin-10
  (IL-10), thereby enhancing microglial efferocytosis and facilitating neuroprotection
