caption: 'Overview of the pathways found in vertebrate retortamonads. A, core metabolic
  pathways reconstructed from transcriptomic data showing enzymatic steps where substrate-level
  phosphorylation yields chemical energy in the form of ATP. Abbreviations: 2OG –
  2-oxoglutarate, FA – fatty acid, MVA – mevalonate, OAA – oxaloacetate, orn – ornithine,
  pyr – pyruvate, R5P – ribose 5-phosphate, (m)THF – (5,10-methylene)-tetrahydrofolate.
  Numbers denote enzymes as follows. Arg dihydrolase pathway: 1 – Arg deiminase, 2
  – orn carbamoyltransferase, 3 – carbamate kinase, 4 – orn decarboxylase. Storage
  sugars: 1 – phosphoglucomutase, 2 – glucose-phosphate uridylyltransferase, 3 – glycogen
  synthase, 4 – glycogen branching enzyme and glucanotransferase, 5 – glycogen debranching
  enzyme, 6 – glycogen phosphorylase, α- and β-amylase, 6B – ADP-sugar diphosphatase.
  Glycolysis: 1 – glucokinase, 2 – glucose-phosphate isomerase, 3 – PPi-phosphofructokinase,
  4 – aldolase, 5 – triose-phosphate isomerase, 6 – glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase,
  7 – phosphoglycerate kinase, 8 – phosphoglycerate mutase, 9 – enolase. Pentose-phosphate
  cycle: 1 – transketolase, 2 – ribose-phosphate epimerase, 3 – ribose-phosphate isomerase.
  Pyruvate hub: 1 – pyruvate kinase, 2 – pyruvate, phosphate dikinase, 3 – pyruvate:ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase, 4 – acetyl-CoA synthase, 5 – alcohol dehydrogenase, 6 – aldehyde
  dehydrogenase, 7 – Ser ammonia lyase, 8 – malic enzyme, 9 – malate dehydrogenase,
  10 – PEP carboxykinase, 11 – methylmalonyl-CoA:pyruvate transcarboxylase. Transamination:
  1 – Asp transaminase, 2 – Glu dehydrogenase, 3 – Ala transaminase, 4 – asparaginase,
  5 – Asp-ammonia ligase. Cys synthesis: 1 – Ser O-acetyltransferase, 2 – Cys synthase.
  Fatty acid elongation: 1 – acyl-CoA synthase, 2 – ketoacyl-CoA synthase, 3 – ketoacyl-CoA
  reductase, 4 – hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase, 5 – trans-enoyl-CoA reductase, 6 – acyl-CoA
  thioesterase. Terpenoids: 1 – acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, 2 – HMGC synthase, 3
  – HMGC reductase, 4 – mevalonate kinase, 5 – phosphomevalonate kinase, 6 – diphosphomevalonate
  decarboxylase, 7 – IPP isomerase, 8 – IPP synthase, 9 – undecaprenyl diphosphate
  synthase, 10 – farnesyltransferase. B, summary of mitochondrial translocon subunits
  found in retortamonads. Color code same as in A. C, summary of components of the
  Fe-S cluster assembly systems ISC and CIA found in retortamonads. For simplicity,
  only one subunit is drawn per complex, although most subunits are typically multimeric.
  Color code same as in A, arrows designate cluster assembly steps and transfer among
  the subunits and to the client proteins. How exactly clusters are assembled with
  IscA is a matter of debate.'
