caption: The left figure is a schematic diagram of the morphological changes in the
  necroptotic cell. The figure shows cellular swelling, organelle swelling, plasma
  membrane rupture, and cell lysis causing the release of the contents. Generally,
  it can be observed directly by an electron microscope. The right figure is a schematic
  diagram of the necroptotic signalling pathway. The figure shows RIPK1 phosphorylation
  upon receiving a signal from ligand binding and then RIPK3 activation, which interacts
  with RIPK1 to form a necrosome. Phosphorylated MLKL mediated by RIPK3 induces the
  formation of plasma membrane pores. In addition, DAI and TLRs can directly activate
  RIPK3 leading to necroptosis after detecting exogenous viral DNA or RNA. Key proteins
  in the necroptotic signalling pathway, such as RIPK3 and MLKL, can be detected by
  Western Blot, Immunohistochemistry or Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. The expression
  levels of the genes corresponding to key proteins can be detected by Polymerase
  Chain Reaction. The above methods are suitable for detecting necroptosis. DAI DNA-dependent
  activator of interferon regulatory factors, MLKL mixed-lineage kinase domain-like,
  P phosphorylates, RIPK receptor-interacting protein kinase, TLRs toll-like receptors,
  TNF tumour necrosis factor.
