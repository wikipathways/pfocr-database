caption: Schematic illustration linking hyperglycemia-induced reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) overproduction with Ang-2–dependent vasoregression and combined ischemia/hypoxia-induced
  angiogenesis. In healthy retinal capillaries, proper pericyte coverage ensures endothelial
  cell survival and integrity of blood-retinal barrier by Ang-1/Tie-2 signaling. Chronic
  hyperglycemia induces cell damage and upregulation of Ang-2 in retinal endothelial
  cells and Müller cells (MC), leading to retinal pericyte detachment, migration,
  apoptosis, and progressive vasoregression. Occluded remnants of capillaries are
  no longer perfused, leading to the upregulation of survival/growth factors such
  as VEGF. During the later stages, which is not represented in rodent models, increased
  expression of hypoxia-induced VEGF and increased Ang-2 levels lead to preretinal
  neovascularization. HXP, hexosamine pathway; EC, endothelial cell. (A high-quality
  color representation of this figure is available in the online issue.)
