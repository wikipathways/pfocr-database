caption: Mechanistic model of the cAMP and calcium signalling pathway in cellulase
  overexpression responding to Mn2+/DMF stimulation in T. reesei under cellulase-inducing
  conditions. Mn2+/DMF stimulation induces intracellular cAMP accumulation in an adenylate
  cyclase (ACY1)-dependent manner. An increase in cAMP levels induces a cytosolic
  Ca2+ burst that stimulates the Ca2+ signal transduction pathway to regulate cellulase
  expression in T. reesei under cellulase-inducing conditions. PLC is vital for cellulase
  overexpression in response to stimulation by both Mn2+ and DMF. cAMP induces Ca2+
  bursts via PLC-E. The solid arrows indicate data supported by our own experiments,
  and the dashed arrows indicate other unknown regulation pathways
