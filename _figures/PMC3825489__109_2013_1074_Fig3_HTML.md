caption: Cross talk between the coagulation and complement system. The coagulation
  cascade, the complement system, and fibrinolysis (simplified) communicate through
  many direct and bidirectional interactions (indicated). Activated clotting Factor
  XII can activate the classical complement pathway through cleavage of the complement
  component C1. Similarly, thrombin, kallikrein, and plasmin directly cleave complement
  component C3, as well as its activation fragments (not shown). Moreover, thrombin
  can cleave C5 into C5a, which occurs independently of C3 and therefore represents
  a bypass of the three traditional complement activation pathways (the classical,
  the lectin, and alternative pathways) []. Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor
  (TAFI) inactivates C3a and C5a in a negative feedback loop. The complement system
  also amplifies coagulation through the C5a-mediated induction of expression of tissue
  factor (TF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 by leukocytes (not shown), the
  latter of which inhibits fibrinolysis. In addition, mannan-binding lectin serine
  protease 2 (MASP2) of the lectin complement activation pathway triggers coagulation
  by converting prothrombin to thrombin. MAC, membrane attack complex (C5b–C9); see
  also [, ]
