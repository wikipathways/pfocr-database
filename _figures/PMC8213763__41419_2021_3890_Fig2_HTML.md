caption: During detachment, the ligand–integrin interaction between cells and ECM
  is disrupted and the cells lose the growth stimuli from ECM. However, the integrin
  can be also stimulated by mechanical force and cytoskeleton reorganization that
  actin filaments recruit integrin adaptor proteins, such as talin, kindlin, paxillin,
  and p130CAS to integrin, hence inducing integrin clustering and activation. The
  activated integrin induces FAK/SFK activation and its downstream signaling proteins.
  There is also crosstalk between FAK/SFK and growth receptor signaling, such as EGFR,
  PDGFR, VEGFR, and IGFR signaling pathway. In cooperation with growth receptor signaling,
  integrin/FAK/SFKs induces Paxillin/p130CAS/JNK, Ras/ERK, PI3K/AKT, YAP/TAZ, and
  RhoA/ROCK signaling activation, and hence regulate mechanical transduction, cytoskeleton
  reorganization, and metabolism. Noteworthy, there is also crosstalk between these
  downstream signaling pathways. Eventually, activated integrin signaling and its
  downstream signaling inhibits various forms of cell death, including anoikis, autophagy,
  cell cycle arrest and entosis.

  description: During detachment, the ligand–integrin interaction between cells and

    The activated integrin induces FAK/SFK activation and its downstream signaling
    proteins. There is also crosstalk between FAK/SFK and growth receptor signaling,
