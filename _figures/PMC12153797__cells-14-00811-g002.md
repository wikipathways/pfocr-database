caption: Core signaling networks that contribute to the development of vasculogenic
  mimicry. The signaling within vascular systems relies on VE-cadherin, EphA2, and
  VEGF to initiate the proteolytic cleavage of laminin 5, which results in the extracellular
  matrix being enriched with pro-migratory fragments γ2x and γ2’. The vascular pathway
  benefits from Galectin 3, as it increases the levels of VE-cadherin expression.
  The condition of hypoxia influences all prior pathways through its mediation of
  key signaling molecule expression. The Wnt proteins will likely encourage vasculogenic
  mimicry by engaging PKC and PI3K signaling pathways. However, they may also exhibit
  tumor-suppressive properties under certain conditions. This figure was generated
  using BioRender software version 04
