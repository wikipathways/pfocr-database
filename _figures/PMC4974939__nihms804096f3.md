caption: Activation of “RNA-sensing” TLRs on neurons and microglia triggers distinct
  effects. Signaling through TLR3 on neurons triggers rapid collapse of growth cones
  through a non-canonical signaling pathway, while the same ligand–receptor interaction
  elicits synthesis/release of type I interferons from activated microglia and monocyte-derived
  macrophages. TLR7/8 activation leads to neuron death and inhibition of axon outgrowth
  through undefined mechanisms; however, TLR7/8 activation of CNS macrophages triggers
  canonical TLR signaling pathways leading to NFκB activation and inflammatory cytokine
  production.
