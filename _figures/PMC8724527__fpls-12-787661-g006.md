caption: Expression profiles of DEGs associated with abscisic acid (ABA). (A) Biosynthetic
  and signal transduction pathways of ABA. Pathway was constructed based on the KEGG
  pathway and literary references. ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase; NSY, neoxanthin synthase;
  VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase; ABA, xanthoxin dehydrogenase; NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid
  dioxygenase; AAO, abscisic-aldehyde oxidase; PYL, pyrabactin-resistance1-like; PP2C,
  protein phosphatase type 2C; SnRK, serine/threonine-protein kinase; ABF, ABA responsive
  element binding factor. (B) Heat map of relative expression levels of DEGs involved
  in ABA biosynthetic and signal transduction pathways, including ZEP, NCED, AAO,
  PP2C, and SnRK family. Color scale represents the gene expression level.
