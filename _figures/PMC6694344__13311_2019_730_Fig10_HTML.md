caption: Schematic graph of the neuroprotective role of scaffold protein CAL via regulation
  of mGluR5. The association of CAL with mGluR5 controlled rotenone-induced receptor
  overactivation by decreasing the level of glutamate and u-regulating the protein
  level of mGluR5 through ubiquitination-proteasome-mediated mGluR5 degradation, and
  further mediation of the related signaling pathway to exert neuroprotection against
  cell apoptosis

  5 to Protect Against Cell Apoptosis and Is a Potential Target in the Treatment of
  Parkinsonâ€™s Disease.
