caption: Summary of proposed PIEZO1 regulation by pro-inflammatory conditions in in
  vitro endothelial cells. TNF-α receptor activation by TNF-α led to NF-κB complex
  p65-p50 subunit activation and translocation to the nucleus after IkB-alpha ubiquitination.
  Cytoplasmic levels and activity of p65 are reduced by NOD and CORM-3, respectively.
  NOD also reduces nuclear p65 levels. BRD4, a transcriptional NF-κB enhancer, is
  inhibited by JQ1, but no effect in the regulation of PIEZO1 transcription was found.
  This diagram is simplified and does not consider every TNF-α signaling pathway (created
  in Biorender.com).
