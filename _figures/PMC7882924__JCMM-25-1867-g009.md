caption: A graphical illustration of the function and mechanism of miR‐144‐3p in combination
  with hBMSCs. miR‐144‐3p can be transferred into cervical cancer cells via hBMSCs‐derived
  EVs. In cervical cancer cells, miR‐144‐3p exerts inhibitory effects on cervical
  cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, the mechanism of which depends
  on targeting relationship with CEP55

  impede the progression of cervical cancer via the miR‐144‐3p/CEP55 pathway.
