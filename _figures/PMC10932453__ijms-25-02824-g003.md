caption: The immune response of the tracheal mucosa to M. gallisepticum infection
  in the respiratory tract. The red arrows indicate the modulation of early-stage
  immune mechanisms initiated upon infection, highlighting the induction of inflammation
  and recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. M. gallisepticum attaches
  and colonizes the airway epithelium and is recognized by epithelial TLRs, initiating
  a TLR-mediated signaling pathway that regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory
  factors, including IL-1, CXCL13, CXCL14, RANTES, and MIP-1β, followed by the recruitment
  of macrophages and inflammatory cells to the local tissue. These recruited immune
  cells release inflammatory mediators to enhance host response and the secreted chemokines
  recruit naive B and T lymphocytes to the local tissue, where they are activated
  for subsequent adaptive immune responses. Conversely, the blue arrows illustrate
  the late stage of infection when M. gallisepticum acts to suppress inflammatory
  mediators and modulate the immune response, potentially suppressing inflammatory
  mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-α, influencing Th1 immune responses through the modulation
  of JAK/STAT4 pathway and cytokines correlated with cell-mediated immunity, such
  as IL-2 and IL-4, which prevents the host immune system from clearing the pathogen
  prematurely
