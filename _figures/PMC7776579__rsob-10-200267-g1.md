caption: Schematic of CTNNB1 in cell adhesion and WNT/CTNNB1 signalling. Most schematic
  depictions of WNT/CTNNB1 signalling do not display the large CTNNB1 fraction at
  cell–cell junctions, and vice versa. This figure visualizes both the structural
  role of CTNNB1 in cell adhesion and the transcriptional role of CTNNB1 in WNT/CTNNB1
  signalling. AJs can have different conformations, including a stable and remodelling
  state. AJs are formed by cadherins that bind their counterparts on adjacent cells
  via their extracellular domains and are attached to the cytoskeleton through their
  intracellular tails via CTNNB1 and CTNNA1. In remodelling AJs, the actin/myosin
  bundles run perpendicular to the membrane, and VCL is present. In stable AJs, actin/myosin
  bundles run parallel to the membrane. CTNNB1 is also a critical component of the
  WNT/CTNNB1 pathway. In the presence of WNT signals, it activates the transcription
  of WNT target genes in the nucleus together with TCF as part of the enhanceosome.
  In the absence of WNT, CTNNB1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the destruction
  complex, consisting of APC, AXIN, CK1 and GSK3, where it gets phosphorylated and
  subsequently degraded by the proteasome.
