caption: Initiation of the TGF-β signaling cascade occurs upon ligand binding to TβRII
  and subsequent TβRI-TβRII hetero-tetrameric complex formation, and TβRI is activated
  through phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic GS domain. This is followed by activation
  of intracellular signaling mediators of TGF-β1. The canonical Smad pathway involves
  activation of Smad2/3 through recruitment and phosphorylation by activated TβRI,
  and requires kinase activity of TβRI. Smad2/3 is then released from the receptor
  complex to interact with Smad4 to transmit TGF-β1 signals. TGF-β1 also induces various
  non-Smad signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT, Rho-like GTPases, and the MAPKs.
