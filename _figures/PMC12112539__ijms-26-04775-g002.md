caption: 'IL-23/IL-23R axis orchestrates innate and adaptive immune responses in the
  inflamed gut mucosa. Figure Legend: this figure depicts the complex immunological
  network modulated by IL-23 in the intestinal mucosa, highlighting its effects on
  both innate and adaptive immune compartments in the context of inflammatory bowel
  disease (IBD). Upon microbial recognition through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells and macrophages, secrete IL-23. The cytokine
  binds to the IL-23 receptor complex, composed of IL-23R and IL-12Rβ1, which is expressed
  on a variety of immune cells including Th17 cells, γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells
  (ILC3), and neutrophils. Ligand-receptor binding activates the JAK2/TYK2-STAT3/STAT4
  signaling cascade, resulting in the transcription of effector cytokines and inflammatory
  mediators. Th17 cells respond to IL-23 by producing IL-22 and IFN-γ, and notably
  granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which promotes extramedullary
  hematopoiesis, eosinophil activation, and the recruitment of granulocyte-monocyte
  progenitors in the colon, contributing to mucosal inflammation. ILC3 and γδ T cells
  also respond to IL-23 by secreting IL-17 and IL-22, reinforcing barrier immunity
  and sustaining inflammation. Neutrophils, through IL-23R expression, engage in endocytic
  recycling processes and contribute to IL-22–mediated mucosal repair or damage, depending
  on the inflammatory context. Treg cells are shown to interact bidirectionally with
  the IL-23 axis. IL-23 exerts an inhibitory effect on Treg-mediated immunosuppression,
  whereas Tregs may attempt to counterbalance this activation via IL-10 and other
  regulatory mechanisms. The epithelial barrier is affected by IL-23-induced cytokines,
  particularly IL-22, which has dual roles: promoting epithelial proliferation and
  repair, while potentially triggering ER stress and cell death under chronic stimulation.
  This cellular stress contributes to the release of DNA into the cytoplasm and activation
  of the cGAS–STING pathway, which further amplifies type I interferon responses and
  intestinal inflammation. Created in https://BioRender.com (assessed on 14 April
