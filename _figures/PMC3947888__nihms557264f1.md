caption: Schematic of proposed mechanisms underlying MSC-enhanced tPA. Our previous
  studies show that administration of MSCs significantly increased tPA in astrocytes
  in the ipsilateral IBZ and coculture of MCS with neural parenchymal cells upregulated
  mRNA and protein levels of Shh and tPA, which were abolished by the small interfering
  RNA (siRNA) that reduces the expression of the Shh gene (siRNA-Shh), and cyclopamine
  that specifically blocks Shh signaling (; ). These data suggest that MSC stimulation
  of the Shh pathway mediates this increase of tPA. Our in vivo data support the observation
  that administration of MSCs not only increases tPA but also significantly reduces
  PAI-1 expression in astrocytes. The TGF-β pathway regulates PAI-1 expression (;
  ). Our in vitro data show that MSCs repress the TGF-β pathway in astrocytes, which
  may lead to reduced PAI-1 expression. Blockage of the TGF-β pathway in astrocytes
  by a TGF-β neutralizing antibody abolished PAI-1 induced by coculture of MSCs and
  astrocytes. These data suggest that MSCs interact with astrocytes to enhance tPA
  and concurrently reduce PAI-1 via the TGF-β pathway. The spatiotemporal pattern
  in the adult IBZ of how the Shh pathway upregulates tPA expression in parenchymal
  cells and the TGF-β pathway regulates PAI-1 expression in activated astrocytes,
  have not been fully investigated.
