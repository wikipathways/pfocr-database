caption: Coupled enzyme assay used to measure the activity of Tag-1P kinase (TagK).
  Tagatose-1P (Tag-1P) or Fructose-1P (Fru-1P) are phosphorylated by TagK in Tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate
  (Tag 1,6-BP) or Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru 1,6-BP) respectively. Second reaction
  is the cleavage by the class I ketohexose 1,6-BP aldolase LacD of either Tag 1,6-BP
  or Fru 1,6-BP into the glycolytic intermediates Dihydroxyacetone-P (DHAP) and Glyceraldehyde-3P
  (G3P). G3P is isomerized in DHAP by the triose phosphate isomerase (TPI). DHAP is
  subsequently reduced by NADH to glycerol-3P (G3P) by G3P dehydrogenase (G3PDH).
  The rate of reaction is measured by the decrease of the NADH absorbance at 340 nm.
