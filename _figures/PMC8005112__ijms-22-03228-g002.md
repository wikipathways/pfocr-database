caption: Potential mechanisms of synergy between small molecules and immune checkpoint
  inhibition in melanoma. Colored dots represent small molecule drugs. Intracellular
  ablation of Braf proto-oncogene/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (BRAF/MEK)
  in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (1), of oncogenic drivers
  such as those involved in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT)
  pathway or of other tyrosine kinases (2) induce apoptosis, resulting in increased
  presentation of neoantigens at the cell surface to primed and activated T-cells
  in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Extrinsic to the tumor cell, anti-angiogenic
  drugs (3) may impair nutrient delivery to tumor cells, resulting in tumor cell death
  and immune clearance. In the immune axis, immunomodulator drugs (4) may impair immunosuppressive
  cell types such as cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF), tumor associated macrophages
  (TAM), and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), including the cytokines they
  secrete which hinder cytotoxic T-cell function. Epigenetic modulator drugs may have
  bi-fold effects (5), exposing epigenetically silenced pathways (methylated, Me,
  or acetylated, Ac) within tumor cells, or alternatively activating pathways within
  immune effector cells including but not limited to immune checkpoints. APC (antigen
