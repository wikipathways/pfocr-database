caption: SARS‐CoV‐2 entry and immune activation. SARS‐CoV‐2 needs to bind to ACE2
  to enter the cell, either by TMPRSS2‐dependent direct fusion of the viral envelope
  to the cell membrane or by TMPRSS2‐enhanced endocytosis. Furin and NRP1 can also
  facilitate viral entry. Viral escape by fusion to the endosomal membrane is CTSL‐dependent,
  as is activation of TLR7, which is essential in the recognition of single‐stranded
  RNA viruses and induction of type I IFN via IRF7. Activation of RAS by viral infection,
  via Ang II and AT1R, induces the TLR4/MyD88/NFκB pathway to increase pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines IL‐1β, IL‐6, IL‐8, and TNF‐α. After DJ‐1‐induced endocytosis of TLR4,
  type I IFN, antiviral kinases, and the anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10 are activated.
  Nsp3 and ‐6 of SARS‐CoV‐2 inhibit IFN activation via the IRF3 pathway. Nsp5 blocks
  HDAC2, preventing it from decreasing IL‐8, a pro‐inflammatory cytokine with a role
  in NET formation. MAS is stimulated by the pro‐inflammatory TLR4/MyD88‐dependent
  pathway and inhibited by the anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10. ACE2, angiotensin‐converting
