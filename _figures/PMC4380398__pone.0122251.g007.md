caption: A schematic model of Pik3ip1-deficiency-mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
  Pik3ip1 inhibits PI3K activity through interacting with p110. Knockdown of Pik3ip1
  could increase AKT activity in basal conditions. Activated AKT induces hypertrophy
  by activation of the mTOR pathway. mTOR increases cell growth and protein synthesis
  through activation of p70s6k and eEF2. Pik3ip1-deficiency-mediated cardiomyocyte
  hypertrophy is attenuated by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. In addition,
  Pik3ip1 can attenuate IGF1-induced hypertrophy by inhibiting PI3K activity.
