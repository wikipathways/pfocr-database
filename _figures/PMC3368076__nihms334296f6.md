caption: Proposed mechanisms of leptin and glucocorticoid stress hormones in the GSK3β/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. Leptin binds to the functional form of the leptin receptor, LepRb,
  and results in phosphorylation and activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This
  in turn phosphorylates GSK3β on Ser9 resulting in decreased GSK3β activity. In parallel,
  activated LepRb recruits JAK2 and initiates phosphorylation of STAT3. Phosphorylated
  STAT3 acts on GSK3β to reduce its activity. Glucocorticoids binding to GR induce
  phosphorylation of GSK3β on Tyr216 and decreases phosphorylation on Ser9, consequently
  increasing GSK3β activity. Increased GSK3β activity reduces the stability of β-catenin
  and leads to β-catenin degradation through ubiquitination. Decreased GSK3β activity
  increases the stability of β-catenin and results in accumulation of β-catenin and
  its translocation into the nucleus, allowing interaction with members of the lymphoid
  enhancer factor/T-cell factor (LEF/TCF) family of transcription factors and, as
  a consequence, promoting the expression of cell proliferation genes.
