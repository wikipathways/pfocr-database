caption: 'Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathway in hepatic fuel
  metabolism. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic
  energy sensor, negatively regulates protein synthesis through inhibition of the
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-S6 kinase-1 (S6K1) pathway. The inhibitory
  effect of AMPK on liver X receptor-α (LXRα)-dependent triglyceride synthesis is
  opposed by the action of S6K1. AMPK also shuts down glycogen synthesis via inhibitory
  phosphorylation of glycogen synthase. AMPK as a fuel sensor induces glucose transport
  and fat oxidation in response to metabolic stress such as energy deprivation, and
  also increases mitochondrial biogenesis. AMPK counteracts energy depletion by stimulating
  energy production and limiting energy utilization. Endocannabinoids such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol
  derived from hepatic stellate cells decrease AMPK phosphorylation resulting in downregulation
  of lipogenic action. 2-AG: 2-arachidonoylglycerol; CB1R: Cannabinoid 1 receptor;
  HSC: Hepatic stellate cell; IR: Insulin receptor; Raptor: Regulatory-associated
  protein of mTOR; IRS1: Insulin receptor substrate-1; PI3K: Phosphoinositide-3 kinase;
