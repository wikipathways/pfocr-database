caption: IL-10 signaling pathways in normal and abnormal conditions. Binding of IL-10
  to its specific receptor complex (IL-10R1 and IL-10R2) leads to activation of several
  signaling pathways, including well-established Jak/STAT pathway, PI3K/Akt- and P38/MAPK-mediated
  pathways, as well as CO-mediated pathway. Through its signal transduction, IL-10
  plays a role in anti-inflammation, vascular protection and inhibition of ER stress
  and autophagy.
