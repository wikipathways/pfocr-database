caption: Schematic of mitomiRNAs interactions with mitochondrial encoded genes either
  positive or negative suggestively. Image was created using the Pathway Studio program
  and arrows indicate flow through signaling pathways; touching boxes indicate direct
  binding of mitomiRNAs signaling components. Data from various articles has shown
  that microRNAs have both positive and negative roles on subunits involved in oxidative
  phosphorylation. Within this interaction, reactive oxygen species may also play
  a role on the ability for mentioned microRNAs classification as an oncomiR or tumor
  suppressor.
