caption: AQ biosynthesis in P. aeruginosa. (A,B) Genetics of AQ biosynthesis. Anthranilic
  acid is converted to anthraniloyl-CoA by PqsA. The genes encoding PqsBCD, which
  contributes to the production of HHQ and congeners, are located in an operon with
  PqsA. The PqsL and PqsH enzymes, which mediate synthesis of HQNO and PQS respectively,
  and related congeners are encoded at distal sites of the chromosome. Each of these
  AQ core structures varies with respect to the length and saturation of their alkyl
  chain (–R). Specific CF isolates of P. aeruginosa (JSRI-2, DSAM-2, and LNAP-3) are
  hypothesized to defective at distinct steps in the AQ metabolic pathway as indicated.
  (C) AQ abbreviations used in this study.
