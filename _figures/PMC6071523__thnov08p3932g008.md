caption: Schematic illustration of the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells in
  the tumor microenvironment. Exosomes derived from CAFs were transferred to CRC cells.
  H19 was highly expressed in CAFs and enriched in the CAF-derived exosomes. H19 could
  activate the β-catenin pathway via acting as a competing endogenous RNA sponge for
  miR-141 in CRC, while miR-141 significantly inhibited the stemness of CRC cells.
