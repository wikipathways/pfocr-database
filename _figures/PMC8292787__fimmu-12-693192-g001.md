caption: Potential mechanisms of Type 2 immunity and therapeutic targets in IgG4-RD.
  We hypothesize that an unknown antigenic stimulus (allergen) triggers Th2 cells
  and activates them to secrete interleukins. Activation of Th2 cells by TSLP promotes
  secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which activate B cells and eosinophils. Both
  TSLP and IL-33 may contribute to IgG4 accumulation via induction of a Th2 cytokine
  environment. TLR-activated basophils secrete BAFF and IL-13. BAFF that is also secreted
  from B cells promotes immunoglobulin class switching while IL-13 maintains Th2 cell-dominant
  immune responses contributing to increased IgG4 production. A population of effector
  memory CD4+ T cells with a cytotoxic function (CD4+ CTLs) that arises from chronic
  antigenic stimulation has also been described in IgG4-RD. An antigen-driven process
  that requires an interaction between CD4+ CTLs and activated B cells that serve
  as antigen presenting cells might be implicated in the pathogenesis of igG4-RD based
  on observations of significant reduction of circulating CD4+CTLs and plasmablasts
  after glucorticoid therapy or B cell depletion with rituximab through antibody-dependent
  cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Other key players in the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD
  include follicular CD+T helper (Tfh) cells that induce IgG4 class-switching, expansion
  of plasmablasts, and production of autoantibodies. Tfh cells drive immunoglobulin
  class switching and promote ectopic GC formation through IL-21 production. IL-10
  that is secreted by T regulatory (Treg) cells drives the differentiation of IgG4-class-switching
  B cells to IgG4-secreting plasma cells, whereas IL-35 may suppress inflammation
  via activation of effector Tregs and suppression of CD4+CTLs. Plasma cell derived
  IL-35 may also drive the differentiation of naïve CD4 T cells towards a Th9 phenotype,
  and IL-9 release, which further promotes plasma cell differentiation and IgG4 immunoglobulin
  class switching. IgE secreted by plasma cells stimulates mast cells via its binding
  to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) leading to release of granule contents
  and cytokines, which together drive collagen production and fibrosis. Targeting
  of TSLP-mediated signaling pathway with tezepelumab, and resultant abrogation of
  Th2 cascades, might be one of potential therapeutic options in IgG4-RD. Blocking
  both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling pathways with dupilumab might reduce inflammation
  and fibrosis in igG4-RD. Blockage of IL-13 signaling pathway that is implicated
  in Th2-related fibrosis with either lebrikizumab or tralokinumab might be another
  attractive therapeutic target in igG4-RD. Depletion of IL-5R-expressing eosinophils
  through ADCC with benralizumab or blockage of IL-5 with mepolizumab might reduce
  eosinophilia and could be an alternative therapeutic targets in patients with IgG4-RD
  that have peripheral or tissue eosinophilia. Dissociation of pre-bound IgE from
  FcεRI with omalizumab might reduce activation of mast cells and production of TGF-β1
  that induces fibrosis.
