caption: 'Proposed model for the role of ID2 in clock resetting. A, serum stimulation
  of MEF or light activation of retinal photoreceptors, retinohypothalamic tract (RHT),
  and in turn, SCN neuron (, , , , ). Intracellular signaling pathways are activated
  culminating in the phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-133 and Ser-142 and permitting
  CREB binding to its response element, CRE, in the promoter region of the immediate
  early gene/clock gene mPer1. This promotes transcription of the target gene (, ,
  ). The CRE and E-box elements are located in the promoter regions of the mPer1 gene.
  CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer binding to the E-box element within the gene promoter is
  considered responsible for rhythmic transcriptional activity in various clock and
  clock-controlled genes (, ). Studies in the Clock Δ19 homozygous mutant mouse suggest
  an additional role of this binding: that CLOCK-BMAL1 binding to the E-box element
  is permissive to, or gates, transcriptional activation by the CRE within the same
  promoter region (, ). Target gene (mPer1 and mPer2) induction by activation of the
  CRE is reduced in the Clock (Clk/Clk) mutant mouse SCN and MEFs following light
  and serum stimulation, respectively. mPer1 is a state variable of the clock and
  its induction or suppression is deemed critical to phase shifting of the clock (,
  , , ). B, in the wild type cell, the presence of ID2 interferes with the dimerization
  of CLOCK-BMAL1 by binding to both canonical clock proteins. ID2-CLOCK and ID2-BMAL1
  cannot bind to the E-box element because ID2 lacks a basic DNA binding domain. The
  quantity of the available CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer is reduced, leading to reduced
  transcription of the target gene mPer1. C, in the Id2−/− cell, the number of CLOCK-BMAL1
  heterodimers is increased due to the absence of ID2, thereby increasing the occurrence
  of binding of CLOCK-BMAL1 to the E-box element and permitting maximal activation
  of the promoter when there is coincidental binding of pCREB to the CRE. This results
  in enhanced transcription of the target gene mPer1. As mPer1 is a state variable
  of the clock, a larger phase shift of the clock is produced (). Additionally, a
  direct role for CLOCK in signaling to the mPer1 gene has also been proposed independent
  of the pCREB pathway, in which Ca2+ -dependent protein kinase C phosphorylation
  of CLOCK can regulate mPer1 induction (). Sequestration of CLOCK to the cytoplasm
  and reduction in the quantities of available CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer by ID2 could
  modulate this proposed signaling pathway.'
