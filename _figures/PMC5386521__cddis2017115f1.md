caption: Scheme depicting a molecular pathway by which Cdc25A is induced/activated
  and promotes neuron death in disease and development. In healthy cells, Akt phosphorylates
  FoxO transcription factors and retains them in the cytosol. miR-21, a microRNA that
  suppresses Cdc25A expression and that is negatively regulated by FoxO3a, remains
  elevated in the nucleus to block the apoptotic cell cycle pathway. Aβ treatment
  and NGF deprivation inhibit neuronal Akt signalling. When Akt signalling is suppressed,
  FoxO proteins are activated and translocate to the nucleus. FoxO3a downregulates
  miR-21 and thereby upregulates Cdc25A. Elevated and activated Cdc25A leads to Cdk4
  activation and subsequent Rb phosphorylation, expression of E2F-responsive genes
  such as B- and C-myb, induction of Bim, caspase activation and neuron death
