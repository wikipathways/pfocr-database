caption: Selection using the Rubisco-dependent Escherichia coli strain MM1-PRK. Blockage
  of the glycolytic and gluconeogenesis pathways by chromosomal deletion of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase gene (ΔgapA) produces the E. coli strain MM1 whose growth is dependent
  on being supplied with a carbon source both upstream (e.g., hexoses, glycerol) and
  downstream (e.g., malate, casamino acids; derived from acid hydrolyzed casein) of
  the deletion (dashed line) (Morell et al. ; Mueller-Cajar et al. ). This blockage
  can be bridged by introducing a two step metabolic shunt (diagonal hatching) comprising
  phosphoribulokinase (PRK, which is toxic to E. coli growth (Hudson et al. )) and
  Rubisco. Using a two-plasmid expression system the expression of Synechococcus PCC7942
  PRK from a pACYC184-based plasmid (pACBADPRK) is controlled by the L-arabinose inducible
  BAD promoter (Guzman et al. ) and Rubisco expression is regulated by the isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside
  (IPTG) inducible trc promoter in pTrcHisB. Contrary to that depicted, even when
  producing the PRK-Rubisco shunt the MM1 cells still require limiting amounts of
  casamino acids and elevated CO2 growth pressures for viability (Mueller-Cajar et al.
