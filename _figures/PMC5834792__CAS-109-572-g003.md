caption: Bypass pathway activation‐mediated anaplastic lymphoma kinase‐tyrosine kinase
  inhibitor (ALK‐TKI) resistance (stromal cell‐mediated ligand secretion from tumor‐
  or stromal cell‐mediated receptor tyrosine kinase activation). Left panel, cKIT
  gene amplification with stem cell factor (SCF) (a ligand of cKIT) secretion from
  stromal cell‐mediated crizotinib resistance. Middle panel, hepatocyte growth factor
  (HGF) upregulation led to cMET activation‐mediated resistance. HGF was secreted
  from tumor or stromal cells. Otherwise, cMET gene amplification solely induced the
  activation of cMET, which resulted in ALK‐TKI resistance. Right panel, ERBB receptor,
  including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation‐mediated resistance.
  Various ligands for the ERBB family can induce activation of ERBB receptors and
  induce resistance. CAF, cancer‐associated fibroblast; EML4, echinoderm microtubule‐associated
  protein‐like 4; NRG, neuregulin; TGF‐A, transforming growth factor‐α
