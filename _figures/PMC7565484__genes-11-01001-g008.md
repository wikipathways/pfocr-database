caption: 'Potential metabolic pathway in goose GCs induced by overexpressed and knockdown
  SCD. Notes: “↑” and “↓” in red indicate metabolites which are upregulated in the
  overexpressed SCD group and are downregulated in the control group, respectively;
  “↑” and “↓” in blue indicate metabolites which are upregulated in the knockdown
  SCD group and downregulated in the control group. All MS/MS spectra of those important
  metabolites are shown in .'
