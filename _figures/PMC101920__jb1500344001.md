caption: 'Late steps of AdoCbl biosynthesis in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The
  model shows the late steps of AdoCbl biosynthesis via the de novo biosynthetic pathway
  of the corrin ring (CobD, CbiB sequence), or via the Cbi assimilatory pathway (CobA,
  CobU kinase sequence). Enzymes catalyzing each step are in boldface and shown below
  each corresponding reaction. The enzyme not found in archaea is CobU. At the left,
  OUT is the periplasm and IN is the cytoplasm. The transport system that translocates
  Cbi across the cytoplasmic membrane is illustrated by the overlapping open rectangles.
  Intermediates and final product are identified by boxed abbreviations below each
  compound. Abbreviations: AP-P, aminopropanol phosphate; AdoCby, adenosylcobyric
  acid; AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; AdoCbi, adenosylcobinamide; AdoCbi-P, adenosylcobinamide-P;
  AdoCbi-GDP, adenosylcobinamide-GDP; Cbi, cobinamide; Me2Bza, 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole;
  Thr-P, threonine phosphate.'
