caption: 'Regulation of behavior by the Insulin-Producing Cells (IPCs) in Drosophila.
  The IPCs modulate feeding and locomotor (shaded) behavior through the insulin pathway.
  Decreased insulin production/release from the brain IPCs results in decreased downstream
  insulin signaling and leads to increased ethanol (EtOH) sensitivity and motivated
  foraging. Decreased insulin signaling in sNPFR (short Neuropeptide F Receptor) expressing
  odor receptor neurons (ORNs) and in NPFR (Neuropeptide F Receptor) expressing neurons,
  increases the sensitivity of ORNs to odors and increases the attraction of flies
  towards normally aversive or noxious food sources, respectively. With respect to
  locomotion, octopaminergic neurons signal through the IPCs to promote wake; however,
  this effect is independent of insulin signaling. Insulin signaling in the corpus
  allatum (CA), a non-neuronal endocrine gland (indicated by square), drives sexual
  dimorphism of locomotor patterns. Lastly, insulin signaling in the circadian small
  ventrolateral neurons (sLNVs) modifies the sensitivity of rest: Lactivity rhythms
  to oxidative stress.'
