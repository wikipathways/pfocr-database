caption: 'Overview of metabolism of effector T cells and the reprogrammed metabolism
  of tumor-infiltrating Tregs: Under normal condition, activated effector T cells
  highly express GLUT1 (glucose transporter) and c-Myc which supports the glycolytic
  pathway through which these effector cells survive in normal conditions. In TME
  this dependency on glycolysis becomes fatal for effector T cells as in the high
  lactate low glucose tumor microenvironment, they face a redox imbalance and thus
  a key regulatory enzyme of glycolysis, GAPDH can not function. Whereas in Tregs
  FOXP3 blocks the expression of c-Myc and this can be one possible mechanism of this
  metabolic shift from glucose to fatty acid dependency. Tumor-infiltrating Tregs
  oxidize NADH to NAD+ through the coupled action of ETC and TCA cycle. And as a result,
  the effector T cells which are dependent on glucose for their growth and maintenance
  cannot survive in low glucose lactate rich tumor microenvironment. (Created in BioRender.com).'
