caption: Acute-exercise-conditioned serum inhibits signalling pathways involved in
  cell proliferation. Increased proliferation in cancer cells is underpinned by mutations
  in highly conserved signalling networks that are involved in cell growth and division.
  Exposure of cancer cells to acute-exercise-conditioned serum has been shown to alter
  phosphorylation of proteins in these signalling pathways in a way that reduces cell
  proliferation. For example, exercise-conditioned serum was shown to reduce phosphorylation
  of Akt, mTOR, p70s6k and Erk 1/2 in human lung cancer cells (22). In addition, post-exercise
  serum has been suggested to support the Hippo tumour suppressor pathway (which involves
  activation of MST and LATS1/2) by inhibiting YAP/TAZ in human breast cancer cells
  (18); although, further studies are required to determine this since similar results
  were not observed in other cancer cell types (e.g. colon cancer cells (18)). Figure
