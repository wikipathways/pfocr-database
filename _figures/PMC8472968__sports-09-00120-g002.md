caption: 'The figure shows the function of endothelial NO-synthase (eNOS) in endothelial
  cells. Blue pathways: eNOS is regulated transcriptionally and activated post-transcriptionally
  by serval intra-cellular pathways activated through mechanoreceptors that are sensitive
  to altered share forces from the luminal blood flow. These mechanoreceptors include
  integrins, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, ion channels, G-protein-coupled
  receptors, and adhesion molecules such as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1.
  eNOS activity can also be modulated through cytokine, acetylcholine, and bradykinin
  receptors (not shown). Green pathway: Activated eNOS produces NO from L-arginine,
  with L-citrulline as a by-product. NO then diffuses to nearby cells and activates
  guanylate cyclase (GC) in the periarterial smooth muscle cells, which synthesize
  cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). cGMP causes
  smooth muscle relaxation through several mechanisms. Red pathway: The activity of
  eNOS is inhibited by asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) through competitive inhibition
  on the binding site for L-arginine on eNOS. SDMA has no direct effect on eNOS but
  indirectly reduces NO synthesis and L-arginine transport (not shown). L-arginine
  is an amino acid involved in protein synthesis and glycolysis (not shown), in addition
  to serving as a NO-precursor. Protein-bound L-arginine is methylated (Me) by protein
  arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), and ADMA and SDMA are produced by proteolysis.
  Grey pathways: About 80% of intracellular ADMA is hydrolyzed by dimethylarginine
  dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) to L-citrulline and dimethylamine (DMA), while about
  20% is transported to the blood and excreted in the kidneys. Most of SDMA is transported
  out of the cells and excreted in the kidneys. L-arginine, ADMA, and SDMA are transported
  bi-directionally through the y+ and y + L transporter systems. Created with BioRender.com.'
