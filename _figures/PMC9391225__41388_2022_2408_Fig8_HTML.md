caption: Single-pass glutaminolysis (orange) in TNBC cells is caused by (1) EAA aminotransferases
  withdrawing αKG and (2) alanine aminotransferase pushing glutamate into the TCA
  cycle. (3) αKG is drawn through the TCA cycle by citrate synthase assimilating glucose-derived
  acetyl-CoA (purple). The single-pass glutaminolysis flux was as large as the net
  deamidated flux of glutamine (green). (4) MCF-7 cells possessed a higher capacity
  for pyruvate anaplerosis that supplements αKG (blue), unlike TNBC cells that rely
  on glutamine to produce αKG.
