caption: Schematic illustrating the current working hypothesis on the hormonal servomechanism
  regulating uterine gland morphogenesis and function in the ovine endometrium during
  pregnancy. Interferon tau (IFNτ) is produced by the conceptus between Days 11 and
  21–25 of pregnancy with maximal production on Days 15–16. High levels of endogenous
  Jaagsiekte sheep retroviruses (enJSRVs) are expressed in the PR-positive endometrial
  LE and GE in response to increasing progesterone to stimulate trophoblast proliferation
  and production of IFNτ. Continuous exposure of the endometrium to progesterone for
  8 to 10 days negatively autoregulates PR expression, so that LE and GE are PR-negative
  by Days 11 and 13, respectively. IFNτ activates the JAK-STAT pathway in the endometrial
  glands which stimulates formation of STAT1 homodimers (or GAF) as well as the transcription
  factor IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3; heterotrimer of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF-9).
  STAT1 homodimers or GAF transactivate a GAS element in the IRF-1 gene. IRF-1 then
  binds to IRF-Es and transactivates the UTMP promoter. ISGF3 transactivates ISREs
  present in the 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) gene. The 40/46-kDa form of
  OAS interacts with the intracellular domain of the prolactin receptor (PRLR), which
  mediates the actions of ovine PL. Specifically, OAS prevents PRLR signaling to STAT1
  and promotes signaling through STAT5. Ovine PL is produced by the conceptus beginning
  on Days 16–17 of pregnancy, which is concomitant with the formation of binucleate
  cells in the trophectoderm. The actions of PL are mediated by PRLR homodimers or
  perhaps heterodimers of PRLR and growth hormone receptor (GHR) that stimulate formation
  of STAT5 homodimers. STAT5 dimers bind and transactivate the GAS element in the
  UTMP promoter. The induction of UTMP gene expression in the GE by IFNτ-stimulated
  IRF-1 is maintained by the actions of PL through STAT5.
