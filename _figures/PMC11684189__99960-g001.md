caption: 'Cholesterol metabolic pathway. Cholesterol is synthesized directly in the
  liver or taken up by the epithelial cells of the small intestine. Niemann-Pick C1
  Like 1 (NPC1 L1) in the small intestine absorbs dietary cholesterol into cells through
  endocytosis, which is transformed into nascent chylomicrons and then enters the
  blood. Under the action of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), nascent chylomicrons
  are transformed into chylomicrons, and then the chylomicrons decompose most of the
  triglycerides under the action of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and the rest of the
  chylomicron remnants are used in the liver. The cholesterol directly produced in
  the liver is converted into bile acid by CYP7A1 and transported into the bile duct
  under the action of ABCB11. Some of the cholesterol is formed into cholesterol ester
  under the action of ACAT. Some of the excess cholesterol enters the bile duct through
  transport by ABCG5/ABCG8, and some enters the blood through transport by ABCA1.
