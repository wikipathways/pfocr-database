caption: IFN-α-driven pDC-B cells crosstalk leading to antibody production in response
  to viral infection. Upon virus encounter, pDCs activate TLR7/MyD88 pathway that
  leads to IRF7-mediated first wave of IFN-I production (mainly IFN-β/IFN-α4) and
  IRF-5-dependent secretion of inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6), respectively.
  IFN-I early response activates an IFN-mediated feedback amplification signaling
  leading to a second massive production of IFN-α. In the context of a direct CD40
  stimulation, IFN-α induces activation of B cells that in the presence of IL-6 differentiate
  into Ig producing plasma cells. Two negative feedback signals limit the production
  of IFN-α. One is triggered by IL-1b-mediated SOCS1 activation targeting IRF-7; the
  other is mediated by IFN-α itself, that induce immature B cells to differentiate
  into IL-10 producing regulatory B-cells capable to turn off pDCs. In the context
  of female cells the biallelic expression of TLR7 may determine a more rapid and
  considerable production of IFN-α, thus preferentially leading to plasma cell differentiation
  and antibody secretion.
