caption: Model of the role of AtOXR2 in plant defense. AtOXR2 is part of a loop for
  the activation of the SA-mediated plant defense pathway. By increasing ROS levels,
  AtOXR2 induces SA synthesis. In turn, SA, pathogens, and oxidative stress (ROS)
  stimulate the expression of AtOXR2. Increased AtOXR2 expression modifies the intracellular
  cytosolic redox environment, producing an increment in total GSH content and inducing
  the translocation of NPR1 to the nucleus, thus increasing defense and preparing
  plants against a potential pathogen attack. Black arrows correspond to connections
  known and established by other authors. Blue arrows represent results previously
  published by our group (). Green-dotted arrows indicate original results presented
  in this work.
