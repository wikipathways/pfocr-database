caption: Role of CobT in the late steps of AdoCbl biosynthesis. This branch of the
  AdoCbl biosynthetic pathway is known as the NLA pathway. The black box in the inner
  membrane represents the corrinoid-specific ABC transporter BtuCD. The inset shows
  the chemical structure of AdoCbl; the coring ring in the scheme is represented by
  the rhomboid cartoon with the Co ion in the middle.
