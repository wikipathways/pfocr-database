caption: 'Notch–HER2 crosstalk in HER2+ BC (A). Ju et al. determined an intricate
  form of crosstalk between HER2 and Notch-1 in HER2+ breast cancer. HER2+ breast
  cancer cells exhibit an increase in survivin protein expression concomitantly with
  a decrease in survivin mRNA expression. HER2 promotes activation of the AKT pathway,
  which threonine 308 phosphorylated AKT can inhibit p21-mediated inhibition of cyclin
  dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) dimerization to cyclin B1. Concomitantly, HER2-mediated
  activation of the MAPK pathway enables Erk-mediated CDK1-Cyclin B1 dimerization
  as well as inhibition of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of survivin
  by restricting the formation of the X-linked Inhibitor of apoptosis protein-X-linked
  associating factor-1(XIAP-XAF-1) complex. Together, AKT and Erk promote dimerization
  of CDK1 to Cyclin B1, which stabilizes survivin by phosphorylating the threonine
  34 residue (Thr34) of the survivin protein. Increased survivin stabilization causes
  an increase in survivin expression. Survivin mRNA is reduced by Erk-mediated inhibition
  of γ-secretase, which in turn inhibits Notch receptor-mediated transcriptional activation.
  (B) Pradeep et al. established an interesting form of crosstalk between the HER2
  and Notch-3 receptors in HER2+ DCIS. HER2 up-regulates the transcription of the
  Notch pathway components: jagged-1, -2 (Jag-1/2), DLL-1, ADAM17, presenilin-1 (Pres-1),
  as well as Notch-3 and Notch-1 (Notch-3/1) through the MAPK pathway. Increased transcription
  of the Notch pathway components causes Notch-mediated up-regulation of c-Myc, Cyclin
  D1, phosphorylation of Serine-473 of Atk (+P-Ser 473 AKT), and down-regulation of
  the tumor suppressor, PTEN. Combined GSI and trastuzumab (Trast) treatment reduce
  HER2+ DCIS cell survival and invasiveness.'
