caption: 'Mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Canonical NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation requires two signals: a priming signal and an activation signal. The
  priming signal is triggered by endogenous cytokines or microbial molecules and causes
  the upregulation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β through the activation of the transcription
  factor NF-κB signaling pathway. The activation signal is triggered by various stimuli,
  such as pore-forming toxins, particular matter, and viral RNA, which can induce
  K+ efflux, Cl− efflux, mitochondrial dysfunction (ROS release), and lysosomal disruption
  (cathepsins). These events promote NLRP3 oligomerization to recruit ASC and pro-caspase-1
  and form the activated NLRP3 inflammasome. Activated caspase-1 cleaves gasdermin
  D to release the N-terminal domain and induce pyroptosis. Meanwhile, caspase-1 cleaves
  pro-IL-1β to IL-1β and is released to the extracellular matrix. Non-canonical NLRP3
  inflammasome activation is induced by cytosolic LPS released from gram-negative
  bacteria. LPS is delivered into the cytosol and activates caspase-11, whose activated
  state can trigger the pannexin-1 channel to induce K+ efflux and ATP release. Subsequently,
  the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated, and mature IL-1β is released. Activated caspase-11
  also induces pyroptosis via cleavage of gasdermin D and formation of pores on the
  cell membrane. Alternative NLRP3 inflammasome activation occurs when human monocytes
  are exposed to LPS, which requires RIPK1, FADD, and caspase 8 to activate the NLRP3
  inflammasome rather than K+ efflux. ASC speck formation and pyroptosis are also
  absent in this pathway.'
