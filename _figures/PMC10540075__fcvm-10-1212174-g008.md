caption: NAD+ metabolism. NAD+synthesis happens through the kynurenine (de novo) pathway,
  Preiss-Handler pathway, and NAD+ salvage pathway. In the kynurenine pathway, Tryptophan
  enters through receptors SLC7A5 and SLC36A4 and is changed into formylkynurenine,
  then kynurenine, and finally, kynurenic acid or 3-HK. These final compounds are
  further modified to 3-HAA. Subsequent modifications of 3-HAA into ACMS, quinolinic
  acid, NAMN, and NAAD lead to final NAD+synthesis via NADS. In the Preiss-Handler
  pathway, NA is transported via SLC5A8 and SLC22A13 and is converted to NAMN. NR
  is brought into the cell and is modified into NMN, which is then ultimately converted
  to NAD+ by NMNAT1-3. Lastly, the salvage pathway recycles NAM produced by the NAD+-consuming
  pathway into NMN, which is ultimately converted into NAD+. Ectoenzymes CD38 and
  CD157 convert NAD+into NAM, which enters the cell and is converted into NMN. Lastly,
  NMN is dephosphorylated by CD73 into NR. Figure created using BioRender.com.
