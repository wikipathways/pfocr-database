caption: 'The cell cycle controls the competition between C-NHEJ and resection-dependent
  repair pathways. Extensive end resection is stimulated in the S/G2 phase of the
  cell cycle in a manner that depends on CDK activity, which mediates phosphorylation
  of multiple substrates, such as components of the MRN complex and CtIP. In the G1
  phase of the cell cycle, 53BP1 and Rif1 proteins localize to DSBs, inhibit BRCA1
  recruitment, block DNA end resection thus promoting C-NHEJ. In the S and G2 phases
  of the cell cycle, the ATM kinase, which phosphorylates members of the MRN complex,
  BRCA1, CtIP, or BLM favors the three resection-dependent DSB repair pathways (HR,
  alt-EJ, or SSA). However, recent evidence also suggests that alt-EJ could occur
  in G1 []. Abbreviations: ATM, Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated; CDK, cyclin-dependent
  kinase; DSBs, double-strand breaks; MRN, MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1; C-NHEJ, classical
  nonhomologous end joining; HR, homologous recombination; alt-EJ, alternative end
  joining; SSA, single-strand annealing.'
