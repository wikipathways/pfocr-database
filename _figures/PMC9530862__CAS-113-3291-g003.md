caption: Mechanisms of fasting on cancer cells. Fasting suppresses glucose, IGF1,
  insulin, the MAPK pathway, and heme oxygenase 1 while increasing many autophagy‐regulating
  components (Atgs, LC3, Beclin1, p62, Sirt1, and LAMP2). Fasting causes cancer cells
  to release oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) through aerobic glycolysis, which
  leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), p53 activation, DNA damage,
  and cell death in response to chemotherapy. Fasting activates the autophagic process,
  which induces cell death through a variety of mechanisms. It also suppresses CD73
  and CD39 expression and causes extracellular ATP accumulation, which inhibits Treg
  cells and the M2 phenotype while activating CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Fasting also
  inhibits hemoxygenase 1. It accelerates cellular death and activates CD8+ cytotoxic
  T lymphocytes, which drive the apoptosis cycle once again.
