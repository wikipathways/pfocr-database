caption: Cell cycle-dependent localization of septin-associated protein kinases. (A)
  Components of the septin-monitoring morphogenesis checkpoint localize to the septin
  collar at G2 where they promote Swe1 degradation, and thus full activation of cyclin
  B-bound Cdk1 and M phase entry. At anaphase of mitosis, the APC protein-ubiquitin
  ligase terminates this pathway by degrading its pivotal component, the protein kinase
  Hsl1. At this point in the cell cycle, the protein kinases of the MEN are located
  at the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) and Kin4, the protein kinase central to the spindle
  position checkpoint, is localized to the mother cell cortex. Kin4 and the MEN components
  act in concert to delay mitotic exit until one spindle pole body has been properly
  segregated into the daughter bud. (B) Upon execution of anaphase, spindle elongation,
  SPB segregation, and initiation of mitotic exit, the MEN components relocalize to
  the septin rings, where these protein kinases phosphorylate targets that help promote
  cytokinesis. Gin4 remains septin collar-associated from G1 through cytokinesis.
