caption: Overview of the ligands, receptors, and transcriptional regulators of Hedgehog
  signaling pathway. Some of the drugs and natural compounds discussed in this text,
  which inhibit molecular players of this signaling cascade, are shown in red. PTCH—patched,
  SMO—smoothened, SUFU—suppressor of fused, GLI—Glioma-associated oncogene homolog,
  and SHH—Sonic hedgehog ligand. Created with BioRender.com (figure created on 14
