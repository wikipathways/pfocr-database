caption: Adiponectin and its receptors and schematic representation of adiponectin-induced
  signaling pathway. Adiponectin interacts with the C-terminus (carboxyl end) of receptors,
  which interacts with the protein-adaptive protein (APPL1) in most of the seven regions
  with its intramuscular N terminus. T-cadherin is a receptor with a high affinity
  for high molecular weight adiponectin (HMW) isoforms, leading to a complex cascade
  of events.
