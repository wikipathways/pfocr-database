caption: '(Color online) A schematic overview of the indices of mindfulness and anxiety
  demonstrating their inverse relationship. A stressor in an anxious situation enhances
  the activity of the amygdala, the center of emotional reactions that trigger the
  hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) pathway. This hyperactive HPA axis leads to
  a cascade of reactions on different human characteristics mediated by the sympathetic
  nervous system. The immunological reactions show a decrease in salivary IgA, decrease
  in CD4+ T lymphocyte count/activity, increase in levels of tumor necrosis factor
  alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), and C-reactive protein (CRP)), while endocrine
  reactions exhibit an increase in cortisol hormone levels. Electrophysiological effects
  are evident in the rise in late positive potential (LPP) amplitude in response to
  threatening visual stimuli, stronger delta–beta coherence, higher gamma power and
  a decrease in heart rate variability (HRV). In genetic effects, an increase in nuclear
  factor-kB (NF-kB) level and a decrease in telomerase activity are often observed.
  Behaviorally, anxiety impairs executive function. Conversely, mindfulness is proposed
  to act in the opposite direction to this with a cascade of reactions in response
  to a stressor mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system. Psychologically, chronic
  exposure to stress may lead to the more stable trait of anxiety, while the practice
  of mindfulness meditation may alter the mindfulness trait, suggesting a plastic
  nature of both traits which may be enhanced by continuous accumulation of these
  states. Neuroanatomically, emotion regulation is principally governed by functional
  interaction between amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions, which are respectively
  involved in monitoring emotional reactions and higher order cognitive functions.
  It is proposed that mindfulness-related skills facilitate better emotion regulation
  strategies, such as by alleviating worry and rumination and enhancing acceptance
  and reappraisal abilities. This proposed schematic overview was adapted from concepts
  mentioned relating to the measurement indices (blue arrow: activity contributed
  by mindfulness, dark red arrow: activity contributed by anxiety, upward arrow: increase
  in activity, and downward arrow: decrease in activity).'
