caption: Schematic model of the C/EBPβ/AEP pathway mediating AD pathology. δ-Secretase
  cleaves numerous substrates, including SRPK2, APP, Tau, and TrkB receptors. SRPK2
  phosphorylates δ-secretase on the S226 residue and activates its protease activities.
  BDNF/TrkB signaling inhibits δ-secretase via Akt phosphorylation on T322, promoting
  neuronal survival (left panel). A schematic model shows the role δ-secretase in
  α‐synuclein-induced PD pathology. δ-Secretase‐cleaved α-synuclein N103 triggers
  MAO‐B activation that feeds forward to further activate δ-secretase by the DA metabolite
  DOPAL (right panel).
