caption: Schematic showing IFN-induced upregulation of mucins in hypoxia in COVID-19
  patients. (1) Air inhalation brings SARS-CoV-2 into the alveoli; (2) alveolar macrophages
  recognize the invading virus and respond by releasing IFN-β; (3) other innate immune
  cells, such as plasmacytoid DCs and γδ T cells, may also respond to the virus and
  produce IFNs, including IFN-β and IFN-γ; (4) type II pneumocytes are mainly stimulated
  by locally released IFN-β, thus activating the IDO1-Kyn-AhR signaling pathway; (5)
  activated AhR transcriptionally promotes the expression of mucin genes; (6) the
  generated mucus adheres to the surface of alveoli and impairs oxygen entrance into
  the blood but not CO2 entrance into alveoli, leading to silent hypoxia; (7) mucus
  further accumulates in the alveoli, and proinflammatory factors in the alveoli stimulate
  capillary vessels to allow the leakage of blood, thus leading to the hindrance of
  CO2 exchange; and (8) mucus further accumulates in the alveoli, while proinflammatory
  factors become critical.
