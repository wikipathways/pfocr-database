caption: Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. In response to low levels of oxidative
  stress, p53 exhibits antioxidant activities that contribute to the elimination of
  oxidative stress and ensure cell survival, whereas in response to high levels of
  oxidative stress, p53 exhibits pro-oxidative activities that further increase the
  levels of stress, leading to cell death via apoptosis. p53 can promote apoptosis
  by inducing the transcription of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such
  as Bax and by its direct effects on mitochondrial membranes. TNFα causes apoptosis
  through death receptors (i.e., the extrinsic apoptotic pathway).
