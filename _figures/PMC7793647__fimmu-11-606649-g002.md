caption: 'Major signaling pathways of GILZ. GILZ can regulate cell activation, apoptosis,
  proliferation, and inflammation mainly through several signaling pathways. GILZ
  directly binds p65 and p52 to inhibit NF-κB signaling to reduce the production of
  proinflammatory factors and macrophage phagocytosis. GILZ can directly bind Ras
  and inhibit downstream pathways. (1) inhibits the PI3K–Akt pathway to regulate apoptosis
  and cell survival; GILZ inhibits FOXO3A-mediated transcription, such as the pro-apoptotic
  protein, Bim. (2) The direct binding of GILZ to Ras and Raf leads to reduced activation
  of MEK, ERK, and MAPK, which inhibits cell growth and proliferation. (3) GILZ can
  directly bind c-Fos and c-Jun to inhibit AP-1 signaling, which prevents cell growth,
  cell differentiation, and inflammation. NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; AP-1, activator
