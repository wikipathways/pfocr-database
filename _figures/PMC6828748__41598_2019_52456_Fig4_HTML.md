caption: 'Molecular pathway linked to oxidative stress response in E. granulosus PSCs.
  Exposure to H2O2 and other ROS/RNS can cause macromolecule oxidation at the tegumental
  surface of PSC leading to reactive carbonyls production. Expression of GST at the
  parasite surface can contribute with the detoxification of some toxic aldehydes
  (i.e., trans-2-nonenal). Other carbonyl detoxifying enzymes (AKRs, CBRs, and GSTs)
  are up-regulated to prevent lipid, protein, and DNA damage. Protein modification
  can cause protein aggregation that can be inhibited by Hsp70 chaperone or degraded
  by targeting ubiquitinated proteins to 26S proteasome (ADRM1, PSMD2, UCH-L3, and
  26S ATP). Damaged mitochondrial membrane and nuclear/mitochondrial DNA could be
  responsible for initial events of apoptosis, inducing caspase-3 activation and cleavage
  of protein substrates such as filamins and lamins. ER stress induced by oxidative
  stress can also be associated with PSC apoptosis. Glycerol production can protect
  cells from hyperosmotic and oxidative stress. EV: extracellular vesicle, Cytc: cytochrome
  c, CatD: cathepsin D, Cnx: calnexin, PDI: protein disulfide isomerase.'
