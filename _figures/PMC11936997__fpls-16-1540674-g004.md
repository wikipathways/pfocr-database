caption: Schematic illustration of Secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathway with
  expression levels of 6 DEGs (CCoAOMT, CYP81E1, DFR, and HCT paralogs) and the average
  contents of 4 metabolites (Catechin, Chlorogenic acid, Formononetin, and Genistin)
  from each group. The color scale indicates fold change level of each DEGs between
  high group and low group. The bar plots show secondary metabolite content of High
  (Red bar) and Low group (Blue bar). The y-axis of four graphs represents concentration
  of metabolites (mg/L). CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; CYP81E1, 4’-methoxyisoflavone
  2’-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase; HCT, shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase
