caption: 'Putative mechanism of the effect of Aβ immunotherapy on cognition. The amyloid
  cascade hypothesis states that the accumulation of Aβ oligomers is toxic for neurons
  through two mechanisms, directly and by inducing tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation.
  Tau aggregates, in turn, induce Aβ oligomerization, which leads to a positive feedback
  that potentiates the amyloid pathway and eventually results in neuronal loss and
  dementia. Thus, capturing Aβ oligomers prevents neuronal loss and the subsequent
  dementia. FAD: Familial AD. SAD; Sporadic AD. PHF: Paired helical filaments. NTFs:
  neurofibrillary tangles.'
