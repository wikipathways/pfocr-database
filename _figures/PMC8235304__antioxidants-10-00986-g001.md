caption: Mechanisms of Ferroptosis Inducers and Inhibitors. Ferroptosis is triggered
  following the accumulation of iron-catalysed damage to phospholipid-bound polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFA-PLs). Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) detoxifies lipid peroxides
  at the expense of glutathione oxidation (GSH to GSSG). GSH is a tripeptide containing
  cysteine, glutamate, and glycine and is synthesised through a stepwise pathway catalysed
  by a glutamate–cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), glutamate–cysteine ligase
  modifier subunit (GCLM), and glutathione synthetase (GSS). Cystine imported in exchange
  for glutamate by system xc− (encoded by SLC7A11) provides the main source of cysteine
  for GSH synthesis. Glycine for GSH synthesis can be sourced from serine catabolism
  by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family
  member 4 (ACSL4) acylates PUFAs, which are incorporated into plasma membranes and
  are vulnerable to peroxidation. Ferroptosis can be triggered by the GSH depletion
  (e.g., Cyst(e)inase, Erastin, Eprenetapopt) or direct inhibition of GPX4 (e.g.,
  RSL3). Downstream products of the mevalonate pathway suppress ferroptosis, including
  isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), which is utilised for selenoprotein synthesis (e.g.,
  GPX4), coenzyme-Q10 (CoQ10) synthesis, which is a co-factor of ferroptosis suppressor
  protein 1 (FSP1, encoded by AIFM2), and squalene synthesis, which is a lipophilic
  antioxidant. Inhibiting hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) with
  statins amplifies the activity of ferroptosis inducers. Supplementation of exogenous
  antioxidants (e.g., NAC, N-acetyl-cysteine) to simulate GSH synthesis, lipophilic
  antioxidants (e.g., Ferrostatin-1, Fer-1) to detoxify lipid peroxides, and iron
  chelation (e.g., DFO, deferoxamine) blocks the induction of ferroptosis. Pan-caspase
  inhibitors fail to rescue the cell death (e.g., zVAD-FMK) induced by ferroptosis
  inducers. Ferroptosis induction by traditional therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
  and immunotherapy) contributes to their anti-cancer activity. Figure generated using
