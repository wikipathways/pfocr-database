caption: Magnolin mitigates CXCL10‐induced skin ageing. The skin can undergo chronic
  inflammation due to external factors such as exposure to sunlight, environmental
  pollution and psychological stress. During this process, CXCL10 plays a significant
  role in promoting skin fibroblast senescence and MMP‐induced ECM degradation through
  CXCR3, ultimately leading to skin ageing. Magnolin can mitigate this process through
  the inhibition of the CXCL10/p38 signalling pathway
