caption: Nrf2 activation pathway. Nrf2 is a member of the bZIP family of transcription
  factors. It is localized in the cytoplasm under basal conditions where it forms
  a complex with Keap1 and Cullin 3 until activated. Under basal conditions, Nrf2
  is ubiquitinated and degraded by proteosomes. During electrophilic stress induced
  by either oxLDL or 4-HNE, the cysteine residues in Keap1 are covalently modified
  leading to the subsequent ubiquitination of Keap1 and its degradation. As Nrf2 builds
  up in the cytoplasm, it starts to translocate into the nucleus forming a heterodimer
  with a Maf protein. The transcription factor complex associates with antioxidant
  response elements upstream of antioxidant and phase II detoxication genes to initiate
  transcription. Similarly, under basal conditions NFκB forms a complex with its negative
  regulator IκB in the cytoplasm. During oxidative and inflammatory stress, IκB is
  phosphorylated by the kinase IKK and subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin-proteosome
  pathway. This allows NFκB to translocate into the nucleus, resulting in increased
  expression of genes that encode pro-inflammatory cytokines.
