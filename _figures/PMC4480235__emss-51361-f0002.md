caption: Following binding to agonist ligands, Dectin-1 recruits Syk through a phospho-tyrosine
  in the hemITAM motif. Syk induces production of ROS that acts as microbicidal agent
  and contributes to the activation of the NALP3 inflammasome, leading to processing
  of pro-IL-1β. Syk also leads to activation of NF-κB at different levels. First,
  Syk recruits CARD9/Bcl-10 to activate the canonical p65/p50 pathway and Malt-1,
  which activates c-Rel in human DC. Independent of CARD9, Syk also leads to activation
  of NIK and the non-canonical RelB pathway. Finally, Dectin-1 engagement also leads
  to Syk-independent activation of Raf-1, which results in acetylation of p65/p50
  and modulation of NF-κB activity in part through inhibition of the RelB module.
  Syk also activates the p38, ERK and JNK cascades, as well as NFAT, which regulate
  gene transcription in cooperation with NF-κB.
