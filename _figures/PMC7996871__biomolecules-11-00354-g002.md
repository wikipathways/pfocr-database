caption: PERK pathway and small molecule modulators. UPR induction results in dimerization
  and autophosphorylation of PERK. pPERK catalyzes phosphorylation of the α subunit
  of the translation factor eIF2 (eIF2(α-P)), which associates with the guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor eIF2B, inhibiting its activity and, thus, causing an arrest in transient
  protein translation. However, this also leads to activation of the translation of
  ATF4 and other mRNAs with upstream ORFs. ATF4 induces transcription of pro-survival
  genes and also in the longer term of CHOP, a transcription factor that induces among
  others the transcription of GADD34. GADD34 forms a complex with PP1, leading to
  the dephosphorylation of eIF2(α-P) and resumption of protein synthesis. The constitutively
  expressed CReP also associates with PP1 to maintain a basal level of eIF2(α-P) dephosphorylation
  activity. Activated PERK also phosphorylates Nrf2, causing its release from KEAP1
  and allowing its traffic to the nucleus, where pNrf2 induces transcription of redox
  maintenance genes. In the long term, if ER stress persists, CHOP and QRICH1 accumulation
  leads to the induction of pro-apoptotic genes. Arrows and modulators in green indicate
  steps and activators of the PERK pathway, while those in red show steps and compounds
  that turn off the pathway. Compounds with unknown target mechanism are shown in
  parentheses.
