caption: Putative chilling response pathway predicted in Capsicum annuum based on
  RNA-sequencing data. Chilling insensitive (Ins) ‘UZB-GJG-1999-51’ and chilling sensitive
  (Sen) ‘C00562’ peppers were treated with a chilling temperature of 2 °C for 0 h
  and 24 h after harvest, respectively.
papertitle: Jasmonic acid and ERF family genes are involved in chilling sensitivity
  and seed browning of pepper fruit after harvest.
