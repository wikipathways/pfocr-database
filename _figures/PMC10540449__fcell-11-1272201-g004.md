caption: The BMP signaling pathway in HERS during tooth root development. Created
  with BioRender.com. BMP ligands (such as BMP2/4) bind to BMP receptor type II and
  BMPR1A complexes, thereby activating canonical BMP signaling and modulating the
  expression of downstream target genes, including Shh and Mki67. These genes play
  crucial roles in regulating the initiation, elongation and degeneration of HERS.
  As a downstream target of BMP signaling pathway in HERS, SHH also promotes the differentiation
  of root odontoblasts through the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. The antagonistic
  interaction between BMP and Wnt signaling pathways further promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition during tooth development.
