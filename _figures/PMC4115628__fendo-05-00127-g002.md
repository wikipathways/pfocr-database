caption: Sphingolipid metabolism. Ceramide is the centerpiece of the sphingolipid
  metabolic pathway and can be synthesized de novo from l-serine and palmitoyl-CoA
  (green), through hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (yellow), or through hydrolysis of
  glycosphingolipids and sulfatites (purple). Ceramide can also be synthesized from
  sphingomyelin through the action of sphingomyelinases, or from ceramide-1-phosphate
  through the action of ceramide-1-phosphate phosphatase. Finally, ceramide can be
  further catabolized (blue) to sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate, which are
  biologically active metabolites and finally to ethanolamine-1-phosphate and C16
  fatty aldehydes. SPT, serine palmitoyl transferase; 3-KSR, 3-ketosphinganine reductase;
