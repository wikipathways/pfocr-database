caption: Integrated results of this study to diagrammatically show how LPS-induced
  systemic inflammation facilitates the onset of cerebral edema under short-term hypoxia
  in rats by (1) LPS-induced pro-inflammatory pathway which activates AQP4 and contributes
  to water permeability of astrocytes via TLR4 signaling MAPKs and NF-κB, (2) short-term
  hypobaric hypoxia which reduced Na+-K+-ATPase activity resulting in water inflow
  in astrocytes, (3) LPS + hypoxia-induced leakage of BBB resulting in vasogenic edema.
  All together, these factors contribute to brain edema. Under prolonged hypoxia,
  systemic inflammation may worsen the cerebral edema by (1) LPS plus hypoxia-induced
  astrocyte cytotoxic swelling; (2) LPS plus hypoxia-activated cortical microglia
  release of cytokines, which further stimulate astrocyte swelling; and (3) hypoxia
  further reducing Na+-K+-ATPase activity, and LPS + hypoxia triggering leakage of
  BBB. This mechanism in rats may describe the onset and deterioration of HACE in
  human
