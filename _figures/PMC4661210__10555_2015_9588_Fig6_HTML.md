caption: Activation mechanisms of the ASK1 signaling pathway leading to JNK and p38MAPK
  phosphorylation. ROS can directly or indirectly (via GSH) oxidize the TRX subunits
  (TRX-ox) of the inactivated signalosome complex. Upon oxidation and subsequent dissociation
  of TRX, the ASK1 heteromer autophosphorylates and initiates downstream signaling.
  MKK4/7 are kinases responsible for the activation of JNK proteins, whereas MKK3/6
  phosphorylate and activate the p38MAPKs. Downstream of the NF-κB, HIF-1, and FOS
  pathways, tumor cells and immune cells produce TNF-α. TNF-α binds the TNFR, which
  activates intracellular TRAF. These TRAFs stimulate the production of mitochondrial
  ROS and NADPH oxidase 1-derived ROS that stimulate the dissociation of TRX from
  the signalosome, but also bind TRX to prevent reassociation of TRX with ASK1
