caption: (A) Gene regulated by Pax6 in the prospective lens ectoderm (PLE) and lens
  placode. Expression of Hes1, Lhx2, Mab21like2 and Rx in the optic vesicle (OV) is
  essential for mouse lens placode formation; however, the mechanisms of these genes
  remain to be elucidated. (B) Three genes, c-Maf, Prox1 and Pitx3, are directly or
  indirectly regulated by Pax6 during the proliferation of lens progenitor cells.
  Expression of prox1 is required for the cell cycle exit prior the terminal differentiation.
  (C) A complex regulatory network proposed to control crystallin gene expression
  in differentiating lens fibers. Dotted lines show proposed links between the FGF/MAPK
  pathway to regulate expression of Pax6, c-Maf and αA-crystallin during lens differentiation.
