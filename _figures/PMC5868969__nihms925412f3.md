caption: PD is characterized by elevated oxidative stress and accumulation of misfolded
  proteins such as α-synuclein. H2S mediates sulfhydration of the E3-ubiquitin ligase,
  parkin, which increases its catalytic activity and results in clearance of toxic
  proteins. In PD, this pathway is impaired by suboptimal sulfhydration of parkin
  and accumulation of parkin substrates. Neuroprotection mediated by H2S donors in
  PD therapy act in multiple ways. H2S scavenges reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) either directly or indirectly by the activation of
  antioxidant defense pathways such as those regulated by Nrf2. Sulfhydration of Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), the inhibitor of Nrf2, causes their dissociation
  to facilitate nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and transcription of its target genes
  involved in maintenance of redox homeostasis. Another mode by which H2S protects
  cells is by maintenance of mitochondrial function, which is affected in PD.
