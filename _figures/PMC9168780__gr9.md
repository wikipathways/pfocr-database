caption: 'Roles of H2S in the stimulation of cellular bioenergetics in cancer cells.
  H2S can serve as a direct electron donor into the mitochondrial electron transport
  chain at the level of Complex II via SQR (Pathway #1), but also, at low concentrations,
  it can serve as an electron donor at Complex IV (Pathway #2). H2S can inhibit mitochondrial
  cAMP phosphodiesterases (as PDE2A), and thereby stimulate intramitochondrial cAMP-dependent
  protein kinases, which can phosphorylate and thus further activate the electron
  transport chain (Pathway #3). In addition, H2S can sulfhydrate LDH-A, resulting
  in its activation (Pathway #4). H2S can also directly stimulate the activity of
  ATP synthase via the sulfhydration of specific cysteines (Pathway #5). H2S can regulate
  mitochondrial dynamics (fusion/fission) to maintain the mitochondrial pool in its
  most effective state (Pathway #6). H2S can also increase mitochondrial mass via
  the stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis (Pathway #7). Additional mechanisms
  underlying mitochondrial “stabilization” may be simply related to the general antioxidant
  role of H2S (Pathway #8). Another mitochondrial protective mechanism is related
  to the stimulation of mitochondrial DNA repair (Pathway #12). H2S may also support
  the cancer cell metabolism via the stimulation of glycolysis, in part through GAPDH
  and PKM2 sulfhydration and their consequent activation (Pathway #9). H2S may also
  stimulate the uptake of glucose and its utilization (Pathway #10), and lipid uptake
  and its utilization (Pathway #11) into the cells.'
