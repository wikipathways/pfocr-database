caption: Molecular basics of tumor angiogenesis. Key players of tumor angiogenesis
  and their main functions are depicted here. (a) Once a tumor has reached a volume
  of 1-2 mm3, tumor cells start to be hypoxic, and HIF1α is stabilized. Activated
  HIF pathway leads to the expression of several genes (within green square) which
  greatly contribute to VEGF production. VEGF amplify this system through VEGF-dependent
  MMPs expression involved in ECM degradation and growth factors release. VEGF acts
  as a chemoattractant on endothelial cells from the nearest vessels and triggers
  vessel sprouting. Stimulated VEGFR2 leads to the expression of Dll4, a Notch ligand
  which inhibits the tip cell transformation through VEGFR1 upregulation. VEGFR activation
  mediates proteases expression, VE-Cad complex disruption leading to cell/cell and
  cell/matrix detachment. In parallel, Tie2 stimulation by Ang2 induces pericytes
  detachment. This step is required for endothelial cell migration and proliferation.
  (b) While tip cells drive vessel elongation towards the source of VEGF and through
  EphB4/ephrinB2 signaling, tumor cells attract stromal cells. These stromal cells,
  comprising tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and fibroblasts contribute to tumor
  angiogenesis through secretion of proangiogenic factors. During vessel elongation,
  new ECM is synthesized, and few pericytes will cover the neovessel. This—in conjunction
  with NO production and disruption of adherens junctions—results in a leaky vessel.
  (c) The resulting vasculature is tortuous with many dead ends and is prone to cell
  extravasation. Moreover, endothelial cells contribute to tumor growth by secreting
  supporting molecules in addition to carrying nutrients and oxygen.
