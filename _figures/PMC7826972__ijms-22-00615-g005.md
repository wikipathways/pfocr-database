caption: Role of Myosin IIA/VII/IX/X in L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri cell invasion
  and cell-to-cell spreading. S. flexneri (in light green, lower panel) entry on the
  basal side of epithelial cells by membrane ruffling is regulated by myosin IX. Specifically,
  Myo9b RhoGAP domain triggers the inactivation of RhoC, a Rho GTPase that activates
  actin polymerization, to stop protrusion formation/extension. Upon entering, Shigella
  is released into the cell cytosol and triggers the formation of an actin structure
  called “actin tail” at one pole to acquire actin-based intra- and intercell motility.
  Myosin X, as well as myosin IIa, promotes this step. Specifically, myosin X binds
  the membrane through its four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) domain and
  actin through its head domain. The motor domain activity is used as a strength to
  form the protrusion and “push” bacteria toward the neighboring cell. L. monocytogenes
  (in purple, upper panel) entry at the apical side of epithelial cells is induced
  by injection of bacterial effectors (in dark purple) inside the host cell cytoplasm
  that trigger actin polymerization and subsequent membrane ruffling. Entry of L.
  monocytogenes is facilitated by myosin VII/vezatin/cell adhesion complex pathway,
  which stabilizes membrane protrusions at the entry site of the bacteria. Conversely,
  membrane ruffling is balanced by myosin II to ensure the optimal enclosure of the
  bacteria inside the intracellular vacuole. Bacterial listeriolysin O (LLO) toxin
  lyses the vacuolar membrane, thus releasing L. monocytogenes in the cell cytosol.
  Here, bacteria promote the polymerization of actin at one of its poles, in an actin
  tail structure, which makes bacteria motile in order to escape cytosolic defenses
  such as autophagy and to spread to nearby cells. Similar to S. flexneri, myosin
  X plays a key role in this cell-to-cell spreading process.
