caption: 'The Pathway Tools Regulatory Overview diagram for EcoCyc. The diagram depicts
  a full regulatory network as three concentric rings: the inner ring contains master
  regulator genes; the middle ring contains other regulators; and the outer ring contains
  genes that are not regulators. An arrow (edge) from gene A to gene B indicates that
  gene A regulates gene B. Initially, no arrows are shown; the user can interactively
  add arrows, such as by clicking on a gene and requesting that arrows are added to
  genes that it regulates, or from the genes that regulate it.'
