caption: Schematic illustration of SAT-EVs–mediated regulation of ARDS via miR-26a-5p
  targeting the CHUK/NF-κB signaling pathway. SAT-EVs mitigate inflammation in ARDS
  by delivering miR-26a-5p to macrophages. miR-26a-5p targets CHUK, thereby inhibiting
  the phosphorylation of IκB-α and preventing NF-κB nuclear translocation. This pathway
  suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β,
  IL-6, and iNOS, ultimately alleviating the cytokine storm and attenuating ARDS-related
  lung injury
