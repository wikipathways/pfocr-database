caption: Targeting the osteogenic niche to treat breast cancer bone metastasis. Breast
  cancer bone metastases remain incurable once osteolytic lesions have developed.
  Palliative treatment often includes the administration of osteoclast-targeted, anti-resorptive
  agents including bisphosphonates (e.g., Zoledronic acid) or the anti-RANKL antibody
  Denosumab to prevent the cancer-induced bone resorption. These two agents are the
  only approved treatments for cancer induced bone disease (indicated by green box).
  Additionally, c-Src (Dasatinib) and Cathepsin-K (Odanacatib) inhibitors are under
  investigation for the treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis. As these anti-resorptive
  agents are not able to restore the cancer-induced bone loss, augmenting osteoblast
  function by anabolic treatments has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach
  and several agents are investigated experimentally and/or in clinical trials. Bone
  anabolic treatments including the administration of a recombinant fragment of PTH
  (Teriparatide; Forteo/Forsteo) or Parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP; Abaloparatide)
  are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. However, these drugs cannot be prescribed
  for patients with bone metastases. Another bone anabolic agent Romosozumab, an antibody
  against the Wnt signaling inhibitor Sclerostin, increases bone formation and bone
  mass by activating the Wnt pathway in osteoblasts. Similarly, Dkk-1 inhibitors (e.g.,
  BHQ880) allow active Wnt signaling in osteoblasts thereby increasing osteoblast
  activity. Inhibition of Activin-A signaling has been shown to prevent cancer-induced
  bone destruction. Additionally, Activin-A inhibitors (e.g., Sotatercept) have been
  shown to stimulate osteoblastogenesis while decreasing osteoclast activity to promote
  bone formation. Hence, they could potentially be a novel approach for the treatment
  of cancer induced bone disease.
