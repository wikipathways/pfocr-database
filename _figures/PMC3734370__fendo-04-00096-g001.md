caption: 'Regulated secretory pathway of a model neuroendocrine cell. Single nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect granule biogenesis and release through these mechanisms:
  (1) SNPs in the promoter or 3′UTR of granule-associated genes modulate gene expression
  levels, resulting in altered granule biogenesis, (2) SNPs in the pro-domain of peptides
  or hormones block their processing and/or sorting into the regulated pathway, (3)
  SNPs in convertase/peptidase catalytic or regulatory domains reduce enzymatic activity
  and lead to aberrant propeptide processing, (4) SNPs in the signal peptide and/or
  sorting domain(s) disrupt regulated secretion, and (5) SNPs that change the processing
  or sequence of neuropeptides modulate membrane receptor binding affinity. TrkB,
  tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor; INSR, insulin receptor.'
