caption: Induction and clearance strategies. (a) Induction. Several small molecules
  have been identified that are able to induce transcription of quiescent HIV proviruses.
  Prostratin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and bryostatin have been demonstrated to act
  on the protein kinase C/nuclear factor κB (PKC/NF-κB) pathway. Activated PKC phosphorylates
  IκBα, causing release of NF-κB. NF-κB then translocates to the nucleus, where it
  binds to the promoter of HIV and promotes transcription. Histone deacetylase (HDAC)
  inhibitors directly inhibit deacetylation of histones at the HIV long terminal repeat
  (LTR), which is associated with induction of transcription. Similarly, histone methyltransferase
  inhibitors (HMTi) inhibit the methylation of histone tails, which are associated
  with transcription from the HIV promoter in some model systems. Hexamethylene bisacetamide
  (HMBA) causes activation of the Akt pathway, which may result in phosphorylation
  of HMBA inducible 1 (HEXIM). This may result in the release of positive transcription
  elongation factor b (p-TEFb) from the inhibitory HEXIM complex, allowing p-TEFb
  access to the HIV LTR, where it phosphorylates RNA pol II and primes the LTR for
  transcription. Disulfiram has been shown to act upstream of HMBA, perhaps by causing
  degradation of phosphatase and tensin homolog, an inhibitor of AKT. Activated AKT
  then phosphorylates HEXIM, and LTR induction ensues. Vaccination may activate some
  T cells, inducing transcription from quiescent HIV LTRs. (b) Clearance. Once viral
  transcription has been induced, cells containing HIV must be cleared. There are
  several mechanisms that may contribute to clearance. If HIV transcription is sufficient
  to produce HIV protein, HIV antigens may be displayed on the cell surface, which
  may allow the immune system to target and destroy the infected cells. Alternatively,
  the cell may undergo apoptosis in response to HIV production. Antiretroviral therapy
  (ART) will be used to prevent de novo infection.
