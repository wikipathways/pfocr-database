caption: Schematic diagram showing the interactions between the SDF-1 and GABA signaling
  pathways, and subsequent effects on neuronal movement. (A) SDF-1 binding to CXCR4
  leads to G-protein mediated activation of GIRK channels and hyperpolarization by
  potassium efflux. GABA binding to the GABAA receptor leads to opening of the chloride
  channel and depolarization through chloride efflux. Each pathway antagonizes the
  other's effect on the depolarization state and thus movement rates. (B) The combined
  effect of GABA and SDF-1 signaling on the GnRH neuron under normal movement conditions
  is relatively rapid and organized (‘Normal’, left). Inhibiting SDF-1 while GABA
  signaling remains intact slows the forward movement rate as neurons become depolarized,
  but the organizing effect of GABA maintains the forward trajectory of the GnRH neurons
  (‘Slowed’, middle). Inhibiting both GABA and SDF-1 signaling restores the rate of
  forward movement to higher levels as the depolarizing effect of GABA is removed,
  but the organizing effects are lost and movement is more random (‘Disorganized’,
  right).
