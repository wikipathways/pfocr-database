caption: FICZ (6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole) is a tryptophan photoproduct in the
  skin, derived upon UVB exposure. FICZ is a high-affinity AhR agonist in which binding
  will trigger the canonical AhR pathway thus upregulating the expression of AhR target
  genes such as CYP1A1 [179]. When FICZ binds to the cytosolic AhR complex, cSrc is
  activated and dissociates from the complex. cSrc poses as a critical signal transducer
  for EGFR with substantial synergistic effects believed to exist between these proteins
  [180]. When EGFR is activated by EGF, the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is initiated,
  stimulating the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [181]. COX-2 is widely implicated
  to promote tumorigenesis as it is believed to promote angiogenesis, immune evasion,
  and anti-apoptotic activity [182]. (Created with BioRender.com)
