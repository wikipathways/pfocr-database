caption: Cbi, cobinamide; Cbl, cobalamin; Ado, adenosyl; DMB, dimethylbenzimidazole;
  NaMN, nicotinate mononucleotide. AdoCbl and tetrahydrofolate are essential cofactors
  of the cmu pathway , . Transport and enzymatic reactions are shown with dotted and
  full arrows, respectively. Genes indicated in bold are located on the 380 kb plasmid
  pCMU01. Circled gene names encode proteins more abundant in chloromethane cultures.
  AdoCbl can be synthesized de novo by an aerobic biosynthesis pathway that incorporates
  cobalt (diamond), or obtained from a salvage pathway after internalization of preformed
  Cbi or Cbl. In prokaryotes, the cobalt needed for corrin ring synthesis may be incorporated
  into cells using the CorA transport system , the putative transmembrane proteins
  CbtA and CbtB , the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND)-type Co2+/Zn2+/Cd2+ efflux
  system CzcA , or the Icu transporter . The TonB-dependent Btu system imports preformed
  corrinoid compounds . We hypothesize that BluB-related proteins link AdoCbl and
  H4F de novo synthesis.
