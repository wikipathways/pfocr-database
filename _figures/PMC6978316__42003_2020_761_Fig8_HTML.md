caption: Dual-functional A6 and G6 can directly kill E. coli either by disruption
  of cell membranes or internal biomacromolecules (1), directly bind to LPS or macrophages
  (2), which may be compete with LPS for binding to the TLR signaling complex (3),
  suppress NF-κβ translocation into the nucleus (4), regulate the inflammatory cytokines
  by the MAPK pathway (5), improve the IAP levels in the duodenum of mice and thus
  indirectly dephosphorylate LPS (6) and relieve its toxicity,. Images of LBP, cytokines,
  CD14, MD2, TLR4, and membrane proteins, partial cell membranes, cell membranes,
