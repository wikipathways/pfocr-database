caption: Mechanisms involved in the immune response and C4 intrathecal synthesis against
  Angiostrongylus cantonensis larvae invasion throughout the damaged blood-brain barrier
  (BBB). Larvae take advantage of existing factors such as metalloproteinases (MMPs)
  and adhesion molecules to enter the cerebrospinal fluid space. Antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) are important in the innate response. C4 can play an essential role
  by the interaction with mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or C2 from the classical pathway.
  Complement component 2 bound to C4b is cleaved by classical (C1s) or lectin (MASP2)
  proteases to produce C4bC2a.The final products of complement activation forming
  the membrane attack complex with the interaction of Th1 and Th2 mechanisms produce
  inflammation, necrosis, and apoptotic cells. Neurotoxins produced by eosinophils
  during the inflammation process including antibody production should be the most
  responsible for the central nervous system damage. This figure appears in color
