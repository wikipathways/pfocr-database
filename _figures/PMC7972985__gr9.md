caption: Schematic illustration of the protective effects of bFGF on HUVECs under
  HG + PA conditions. Diabetes-induced endothelial impairment can be attributed mainly
  to the dysfunction of S-nitrosylation homeostasis (S-nitrosylation of IKKβC179 and
  p65C38) and resultant upregulation of chronic inflammation. Mechanistically, the
  up-regulation of S-nitrosylated IKKβC179 and p65C38 by bFGF were attributed to the
  synergy between eNOS and Trx activity. In addition, the bFGF-mediated disassociation
  between Txnip and Trx in a NO-independent manner, also benefited the cellular redox
  homeostasis and maintaining the content of S-nitrosylated IKKβC179 and p65C38 in
  endothelial cells. This finding could yield new therapeutic insights into the prevention
  and treatment of diabetes-associated vascular disease.
