  and is converted into acetyl-CoA that enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
  Alternatively, pyruvate can stay in the cytosol and is converted into lactate that
  is exported out of the cell. The pentose phosphate pathway takes place in the cytosol
  and is an alternative pathway that can be upregulated after injury; it is an important
  source of NADPH used to produce the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) for preventing
  oxidative stress. This figure was originally published by Carpenter et al. (). ©
