caption: Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by the breast CSC-specific
  miRNAs. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is implicated in both stem cell self-renewal
  and cancer. The multiple miRNAs dysregulated in the breast CSCs, such as miR-142,
  miR-146, miR-200, and miR-141, cooperatively activate the Wnt signaling pathway
  by targeting or upregulating the expression of its components. The activation of
  the Wnt signaling pathway induces the transcription of the Wnt target genes, including
  miR-146 and miR-150. miR-150 enhances the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells.
  Upregulation of miR-146 further enhances the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway
  in a positive feedback manner.
