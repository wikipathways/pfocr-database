caption: Mitochondrial dysfunction in spinal muscular atrophy. 1. Following mitochondrial
  stress (e.g., hypoxia), mitochondrial PGAM family member 5 (PGAM5) inhibits Wnt/β-catenin
  signalling, leading to mitophagy (indirectly determined by mitochondrial membrane
  potential [MMP]). In addition, cytosolic PGAM activates Wnt/β-catenin signalling,
  leading to mitochondrial biogenesis (determined by mitochondrial number and mitochondrial
  DNA [mtDNA] production). This should ensure the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria
  and concurrent generation of new mitochondria to optimise the mitochondrial population
  during times of stress. The effect of survival motor neuron (SMN) in this mitochondrial
  stress pathway is not known but Wnt/β-catenin signalling is a known driver of spinal
  muscular atrophy (SMA) pathology. 2. Mitochondrial transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are released
  from the mitochondrial matrix during mitochondrial stress, where they can interact
  with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-A1 protein in the cytosol.
  The downstream effect of this interaction is not known but may involve mitonuclear
  communication or mitophagy. Alternatively, hypoxia is already known to alter SMN
  splicing via hnRNP proteins. 3. Ubiquitination of vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog
  D (VPS13D) by a ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1 (UBA1)-mediated mechanism
  influences mitochondrial size and morphology through fission and fusion mechanisms.
  4. HuD and SMN interact to transport mRNAs along the cytoskeleton. HuD has independently
  been shown to transport mRNA for the mitochondrial fusion protein, mitofusin 2 (MFN2),
  in pancreatic β cells (a known site of dysfunction in SMA). 5. SMN colocalises with
  actin-related protein 2 (ARX-2) at mitochondria. Together both proteins are involved
  in mitochondrial trafficking and distribution. 6. Other SMN interactors (Bcl-2,
  Tim50) and pathways (stasimon, NCALD) have mitochondrial locations, albeit the direct
  effect of these proteins and downstream functions (in brackets) has not been determined.
  Dashed lines indicate pathways that are linked to mitochondrial stress
