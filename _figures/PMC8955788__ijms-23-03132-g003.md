caption: Immune functions of keratinocytes. Keratinocytes actively participate in
  early cutaneous immune defence. Membrane-bound Toll-Like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) recognize pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs), an event that triggers the activation of intracellular
  pro-inflammatory signalling cascades. The activation of TLRs leads to the activation
  of the NF-кB signalling pathway that results in the release of various cytokines
  and chemokines that sustain inflammatory responses and favor the recruitment of
  activated inflammatory cells. The stimulation of NLRs is characterized by the production
  and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to the activation of the NLR family
  pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome platform and of the MAPK and NF-кB
  signalling pathways. The activation of TLRs and NLRs induces the release of antimicrobial
  peptides (AMPs). Keratinocytes are involved in the coordination of complex cross-talks
  with other immune cells, including antigen presentation to skin-resident (αβ) CD8+
  memory T-cells or via secretion of keratinocyte-derived vesicles containing cargoes
  aimed at regulating various biological processes including proliferation, inflammation,
  differentiation, pigmentation and wound healing.
