caption: AuNPs blocked IL-1β-induced cell activation. A) AuNPs inhibited the cellular
  inflammatory response by selectively blocking the IL-1β-dependent pathway. B) When
  THP-1 cells were treated with IL-1β and AuNPs, it was determined that the inhibition
  of TNF-α secretion was dependent on AuNP size. (*p < 0.01 vs control) Adapted with
