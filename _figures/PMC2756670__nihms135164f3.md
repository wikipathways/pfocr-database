caption: The potential mechanisms of estrogen-mediated signaling through estrogen
  receptor (ESR) and G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30). Estrogen plays a role
  in the regulation of cellular functions through two signaling pathways previously
  broadly classified as “genomic” and “nongenomic”. More recently, the FASEB steroid
  signaling work group suggested that “nuclear-initiated steroid signaling” and “membrane-initiated
  steroid signaling” are more appropriate terminologies. The nuclear-initiated signaling
  of estrogen via ESR1 and ESR2, i.e., the “classical” signaling pathway of estrogen,
  exert diverse effects on a variety of tissues that involves gene stimulation as
  well as gene repression. Estrogen is freely cell permeable, passively diffusing
  into the cell to act as a transcription factor by binding to its receptor, ESR1
  and ESR2, which causes a change in receptor tertiary and quaternary structure to
  form the active complex. The active complex then bound a unique DNA sequence known
  as the estrogen response elements (ERE) on the DNA upstream from estrogen responsive
  genes, i.e., in estrogen responsive gene promoters. Subsequently, transcription
  and translation of these genes results in proteins that ultimately are responsible
  for mediating estrogen’s effects. Alternatively, the complex may induce the production
  of a specific protein more indirectly through the activation of its transcription
  factor. In addition, estrogen regulates a plethora of biological processes through
  the membrane-initiated signaling, i.e., GPR30 pathway. Upon estrogen binding, GPR30
  activates heterotrimeric G proteins that stimulate multiple effectors, including
  production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as well as steroid receptor
  coactivator (SRC), a family of nuclear receptor coactivators. The latter pathway
  in turn activates matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), which cleaves pro-heparin-binding
  epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (pro-HB-EGF) and promotes a release of
  free HB-EGF. Subsequently, HB-EGF transactivates epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR). EGFR activation induces multiple downstream events, including the activation
  of phospholipase C (PLC), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K). PLC activation results in intracellular calcium mobilization by
  inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R) via the actions of inositol triphosphate (IP3).
  The activation of MAPK and PI3K stimulates numerous cytosolic pathways and some
  transcription factors. These estrogen stimulations could induce the transcription
  of target genes whose promoters do not contain estrogen response elements.
