caption: A) Exposure to MDP liberates NOD2 from its autoinhibited state allowing it
  to bind and activate the kinase RIP2. RIP2 undergoes tyrosine autophosphorylation
  and is ubiquitinated by a number of E3 ligases. RIP2 also promotes ubiquitination
  of NEMO/IKK γand by doing so links together proximal and distal signaling components
  of the pathway. The TAB proteins of the TAK1/TAB2/TAB3 complex bind these ubiquitin
  chains allowing TAK1 to phosphorylate and activate the IKK complex. IKK activation
  leads to IκBα phosphorylation, marking IκB for degradation and liberating NF-κB
  for translocation to the nucleus. B) TRAF4 inhibits NOD2 signaling in a manner dependent
  on NOD2 binding and IKKα-mediated phosphorylation. The downstream events mediating
  such inhibition are unknown. A20 is phosphorylated and activated by IKKβ and together
  with ITCH, targets activated, tyrosine phosphorylated RIP2 for degradation. In a
  manner independent of its ubiquitin editing function, A20 also inhibits TAK1-mediated
  phosphorylation of IKK.
