caption: Schematic representation showing the mechanism in which PP2A can negatively
  regulate the mTOR pathway. PP2A can inhibit mTOR effectors 4EBP-1 and S6K by reversing
  their phosphorylation state. PP2A can also inhibit nutrient signaling to RAG complex
  proteins thereby inhibiting the mTOR pathway. Figure created with BioRender.com.
