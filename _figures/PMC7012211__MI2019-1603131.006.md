caption: Schematic diagram displaying the impact of AREG on intrinsic apoptosis signaling.
  Phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens leads to the release of cytochrome c from the
  mitochondria through the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC), which is
  formed by the proteins Bax and Bak. In complex with Apaf-1, the released cytochrome
  c forms the apoptosome, which finally activates caspase-3 through binding and activation
  of caspase-9. Caspase-3 finally leads to the initiation of apoptosis. The signaling
  pathway can be inhibited by AREG-mediated activation of the EGF receptor. Binding
  of the cytokine AREG leads to an EGFR-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK
  pathway, which results in the phosphorylation of the protein BAD. In consequence,
  the heterodimers of BAD/Bcl-XL and/or BAD/Bcl-2 dissociate, thereby enabling Bcl-2
  and Bcl-XL to inhibit Bax-induced apoptosis.
