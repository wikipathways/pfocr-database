caption: Different epigenetic signaling pathways regulated during TGF-β-induced EMT.
  a The regulation of EMT-Ms (mainly E-cadherin promoter) is shown through different
  epigenetic regulators. b The regulation of EMT-TFs (mainly Snail and ZEB2 promoters)
  by TGF-β is shown through different epigenetic regulators. Please notice that only
  the Smad3-SETDB1 pathway is shown in the repression of Snail promoter, in which
  SETDB1 expression is repressed by TGF-β. The opposite pathway of Smad3-CBP/p300
  association triggered by TGF-β to activate Snail promoter is described in the text
  but not included in this panel
