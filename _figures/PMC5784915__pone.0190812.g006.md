caption: A) Direct connections representing activator and inhibitor regulations are
  shown as red and green arrows correspondingly. Magenta color arrows shows the inferred
  indirect interactions which are common between the “normal” and “cancer” networks.
  Light blue color arrows represent those indirect interactions which are inferred
  only in the “cancer” network. Line width of the arrows representing the indirect
  interactions, is proportional to their Gqr score. Here only 10 top scored indirect
  connections present in both “normal” and “cancer” networks and 10 top “emergent
  in cancer” connections are shown. The color of protein nodes reflects the relative
  change in their local PageRanks in “cancer” vs “normal” networks. Red color means
  that the protein become better ranked in PageRank in the “cancer” network, and the
  green color means the opposite. The size of the node is proportional to the value
  of the PageRank in the SIGNOR network. B) Hidden cascade of indirect regulations
  connecting BCL2 and BCL2L1 proteins with CASP3. The proteins shown with grey labels
  are those which are not present in the definition of AKT-mTOR pathway. C) Cascade
  of hidden interactions emerging in the “cancer” network and not present in “normal”
  network.
