caption: Metabolic phenotypes of fetal and adult cardiomyocytes. Fetal mammalian cardiomyocytes
  appear more reliant on glycolysis for energy compared with adult myocytes, which
  supply the majority of their ATP demand by oxidizing fatty acids. In addition, the
  fetal heart has been suggested to accumulate glycogen to higher levels and have
  higher pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity. Because end products of biosynthetic
  pathways are required for daughter cell formation, it is also expected that fetal
  hearts synthesize relatively more nucleotides and have higher hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP), glycerolipid synthesis pathway (GLP), and serine biosynthesis pathway
  activity (SBP) than the adult heart.
