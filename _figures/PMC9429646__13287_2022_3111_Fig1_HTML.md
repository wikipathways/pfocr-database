caption: 'Function of lipid rafts in cancer stem cell. Lipid rafts play a crucial
  role in cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSC self-renewal: lipid rafts promote CSC self-renewal
  through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, Notch pathway, and Hedgehog pathway. Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway: in lipid rafts, Wnt ligand binds to their receptors Fz8 and LRP, phosphorylate
  the cytoplasmic domain of LRP, and recruits the scaffolding protein Dvl to disassemble
  the destruction complex (Axin, APC, GSK-3β, and Ck1α), eventually inhibiting degradation
  of β-catenin, which activate target gene transcription. Hedgehog pathway: in lipid
  rafts, the Hh ligand binds to its receptor Ptc, and Ptc releases the repression
  on Smo, allowing GLI to enter the nucleus and stimulate transcription of downstream
  target genes. Notch pathway: γ-secretase, the key protease of the Notch receptor,
  exhibits the highest activity in lipid rafts, which mediates the S3 site cleavage
  of the Notch receptor, and then releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into
  the nucleus that promotes transcription of the target genes. EMT: lipid rafts regulate
  CSC EMT through the TGFβ pathway. The TGF-βRI/ TGF-βRII/ TGF-β signaling complex
  forms in lipid rafts to activate the downstream signal. CSC quiescence: inhibition
  of lipid raft aggregation upregulate cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57 (Kip2)
  expression, which might trigger CSC hibernation. CSC niche: lipid rafts mediate
  cell communication in the CSC niche. For example, VEGF secreted by CSCs binds to
  VEGFR2 in lipid rafts of endothelial cells, promoting niche angiogenesis and enhancing
  self-maintenance; CAFs secrete CXCL12, which is recruited to lipid rafts in cancer
  cells, where it interacts with CXCR4, regulating CSC plasticity'
