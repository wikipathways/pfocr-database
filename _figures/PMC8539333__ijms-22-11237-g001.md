caption: Effects of OTA-induced nephrotoxicity are illustrated, and the potential
  signal pathways are summarized. OTA uptake by proximal tubular cells with organic
  anion transporter. OTA activates AhR and PXR signaling pathways to induce cytochrome
  P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), CYP1A2, and CYP3A4, leading to increased ROS production. Meanwhile,
  OTA induced autophagy and UPS led to apoptosis with MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway. OTA attenuated
  cholesterol and sphingomyelin to disrupt lipid raft formation which led to cell
  apoptosis through PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. Besides, OTA inhibited occluding and ZO1
  to disrupt tight junction. In addition, OTA activated DNMT1-dependent JAK2/STAT3
  signaling pathway to induce apoptosis and DNA damage. OTA could promote NF-kB translocated
  to nucleus which induced inflammation. OTA also inhibits TRAP-1 which regulated
  mitochondria-mediated and ER stress-excited apoptosis. Furthermore, OTA activated
  NRPL3 inflammasome and caused caspase1-dependent pyroptosis. OTA also activated
  p53 which suppressed cyclin D1, CDk2 and CDk4, leading to cell cycle arrest. AhR,
