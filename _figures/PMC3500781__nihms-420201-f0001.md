caption: Two different pathways could bypass DNA damage causing stalled replication
  forks. A) Translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway regulated by proliferating cell nuclear
  antigen (PCNA) monoubiquitination uses specific a TLS polymerase to bypass DNA damage.
  B) A template-switching (TS) pathway regulated by PCNA polyubiquitination bypasses
  DNA damage in the error-free mode. The exact molecular mechanism for the TS pathway
  is not clearly understood yet. The small triangle on the DNA represents DNA damage.
  C) The TLS and TS pathways share many proteins and PCNA is located at the center
  of both pathways to direct which pathway will be chosen to bypass DNA damage. E2
  and E3 represent E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and E3 ubiquitin ligase, respectively.
  PolyUb, monoUb, and sumo stand for polyubiquitination, monoubiquitination, and sumoylation,
  respectively.
