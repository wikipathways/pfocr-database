caption: Mechanism diagram. MSCs in leukemia niche exhibite alterations in multilineage
  differentiation, cell cycle, cell senescence and gene expression profiles, and exert
  pro-proliferative effects through overexpression of IFI6. Mechanistically, IFI6
  might promote the proliferation of B-ALL cells by stimulating the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis
  to activate the ERK signaling pathway, targeting IFI6 or related signaling pathways
  might be an important measure to reduce leukemia cell proliferation. *The indicator
  is statistically different in at least one of the comparisons
