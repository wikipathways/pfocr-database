caption: Schematic diagram of strategies to overcome MDR. Drug-resistant cancer cells
  have many ways to escape cytotoxic drugs, including the overexpression of ABC transporter
  to increase drug efflux, repair DNA and inhibit drug-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic
  signal transduction pathway always involves the activation of Bcl-2, MDR1, NF-κB
  and HIF-1 overexpression and the mutation of tumor suppressor gene p53. MSN is endocytosed
  into drug-resistant cancer cells, and the loaded cytotoxic drugs and/or siRNA targeting
  related genes can be continuously released to reduce drug resistance.
