caption: IR-induced DNA damage activates members of the DNA damage-sensing machinery,
  which may directly or indirectly activate the nuclear GEFs Ect2 and Net1 to stimulate
  guanine nucleotide exchange upon RhoB. Activated RhoB leads to the downstream phosphorylation
  of JNK that triggers the induction of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim leading to cell
  death. Inhibition of either RhoB or Ect2 and Net1 activation through RNAi mutes
  this signaling pathway and results in cellular resistance to IR.
