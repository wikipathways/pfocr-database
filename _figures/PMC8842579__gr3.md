caption: 'PRRs-mediated recognition of SARS-CoV-2SARS-CoV-2 is recognized by the innate
  immune system by members of distinct classes of PRRs (with their respective ligands
  indicated): Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) receptors,
  and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). Upon recognition, signal transduction occurs
  through downstream transcription regulators called interferon regulatory factors
  (IRFs) to elicit interferons production. The secreted interferons interact with
  their receptors, which results in activation of JAK-Stat signaling pathway that
  governs the expression of various IFN-stimulated genes. TRAM, Toll receptor–associated
