caption: Yellow rectangles represent gene annotation categories. Ellipses represent
  genes that are differentially expressed between Mttp-inactivated and vehicle-treated
  sample groups in plaque macrophages in the Reversa mouse model of plaque regression
  (red = up in Mttp-inactivated, blue = down). Genes are labeled by official gene
  symbol. Color saturation indicates the magnitude of the fold-change (see ). Edges
  connect genes to the statistically enriched annotation categories with which they
  are associated (see ; enrichment P values are given in ). (A) A statistically significant
  cluster of upregulated genes is associated (by gene annotations) with the cytoskeleton.
  (B) A statistically significant cluster of downregulated genes is associated with
  the mitochondrion. (C) Human monocyte expression QTLs for genes that are differentially
  expressed in plaque CD68+ cells in regression are enriched for SNPs associated with
  risk of atherosclerosis or CAD, versus the number of atherosclerosis/CAD SNPs for
  monocyte eQTLs overall. The bars marked “expected” show the range of numbers of
  SNPs associated with risk of atherosclerosis or CAD that would be expected to occur
  by chance within the eQTLs of the set of 213 lipid lowering-responsive genes, based
  on the overall percentage of SNPs that are associated with risk of atherosclerosis/CAD
  (“random”) and based on the percentage of SNPs within all monocyte eQTLs that are
  associated with atherosclerosis/CAD (“monocytes”). Error bars indicate >90% confidence
  intervals for the number of atherosclerosis/CAD SNPs that would be expected by chance
  (see ). (*) P<0.05, Fisher's Exact Test (contingency table data are in ).
