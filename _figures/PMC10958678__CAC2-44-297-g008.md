caption: The role of p53 and mut‐p53 in the TME during cancer development. The TME
  contains blood vessels, immune cells, CAFs, signaling molecules, including cytokines
  and chemokines, and the ECM that surrounds the tumor. The p53 tumor suppressor pathway
  plays a crucial role in tumor immunology and regulating immune responses in the
  TME. However, there is a contrasting function between p53 and mut‐p53. Mut‐p53 inhibits
  immune plasticity and promotes tumor progression by regulating key molecules in
  the TME. These molecules include ECM remodeling, pro‐inflammatory and immune‐regulatory
  cytokine secretion, vascularity, and metabolism. Mut‐p53 contributes to cellular
  non‐autonomous effects and has a pro‐tumorigenic role. On the other hand, normal
  p53 facilitates the expression of various immune signaling molecules, such as TLR3,
  ULBP2, IRFs, and CD4+, which are involved in the immunogenicity of cancer cells.
  This suggests that normal p53 may have potential oncogenic effects. Data were retrieved
  from and based on references [13, 206, 400]. ULBP2, UL16‐binding protein 2; MMP,
