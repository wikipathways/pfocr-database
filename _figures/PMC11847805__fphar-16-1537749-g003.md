caption: The mechanism of RIF. (A) HIF-1α can increase the expression LOXL2 to promote
  fibrosis. The TGF-β1 reduces the expression of PHD2 resulting in HIF-1α accumulation,
  and this PHD2/HIF-1α signaling pathway mediates TGF-β1-induced EMT in renal tubular
  cells. (B) The HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway of glomerular endothelial cells is
  activated, and the increased expression of VEGF can promote activation of signal
  path PI3K/AKT. The activation of the signal pathway leading to abnormal angiogenesis,
  exacerbating glomerular fibrosis, and ultimately the loss of glomerular function.
  (C) In a high-glucose and hypoxia environment, HIF-1α expression increases, leading
  to the activation of fibrosis-promoting factors such as TIMP and PAI. HIF-1α can
  also activate Ang II. Ang II further stimulates TGF-β1 expression and promotes pro-fibrotic
  factors, including CTGF, contributing to RIF by increasing ECM synthesis
