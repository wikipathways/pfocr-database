caption: PERK preferentially phosphorylates BPIFB4-V229 on serine-75. Phosphorylated
  BPIFB4 is retained in the cytosol by binding to 14-3-3 and subsequentially binds
  to HSP90. This complex leads to phosphorylation of eNOS by several potential kinases
  on serine-1177, a site linked to enhanced eNOS function. AMPK, AMP-activated protein
  kinase; Akt, also called protein kinase B (PKB); BPIFB4, BPI fold-containing family
  B, member 4; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; HSP90, heat shock protein
  90 kDa; NO, nitric oxide; PERK, protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum
  kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; PKG, protein kinase G.
