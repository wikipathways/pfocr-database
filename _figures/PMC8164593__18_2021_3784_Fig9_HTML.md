caption: Schematic representation of Toll (a), Imd (b), and JAK-STAT (c) signaling
  pathways. In insects, the Toll pathway is mainly involved in fungi and Gram-positive
  bacteria detection. Pathogen recognition peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRP)
  activate a serine proteases cascade, involving ModSP and Grass proteins, which in
  turn, cleaving the inactive form of Spätzle protein, switch on the molecule. These
  interactions initiate protease cascades. Spätzle activates the dimer Toll receptor,
  which, in turn recruits cytoplasmic proteins (dMyD88, Tube, and Pelle) involved
  in the activation of Cactus signaling. In normal cellular condition, Cactus protein
  is coupled with the Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factors Dorsal-related
  immunity factor (DIF) and Dorsal, but following the Toll pathway activation, it
  is phosphorylated, detached from DIF and Dorsal and degraded. Then, both DIF and
  Dorsal can translocate in the nucleus and induce the transcriptional regulation
  of specific AMP genes (A) []. The insect Imd signaling pathway is activated following
  the binding between PGRP-LC and meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan
  of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria. The Imd protein is activated following
  the cleavage by the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and the death related ced-3/Nedd2-like
  caspase (DREDD). The K63‐polyubiquitin chains help to link this complex with TAK1
  and TAB2 proteins that, in turn, act on the IKK complex, which phosphorylates the
  NF‐kB‐like nuclear factor Relish. Consequently, TAK1 and TAB2 proteins are activated,
  that in turn, act on the IKK complex, composed of Immune Response Deficient 5 (IRD5)
  and Kenny (Key). This activated complex cleaves Relish. In this way, the Rel DNA-binding
  domain is released from the C-terminal ankyrin-repeat/IκB-like domain, and translocates
  to the nucleus inducing specific AMP genes transcription (B) []. In insect, JAK/STAT
  pathway is activated when the cytokine receptor, Domeless (Dome), bind the Unpaired
  (Upd) cytokines which induces the JAK tyrosine kinase Hopscotch (Hop) to phosphorylate
  itself and the Dome cytoplasmic component. Simultaneously, the signal transducer
  and activator of transcription at 92E (Stat92e) bind to the phospho tyrosines on
  Dome, and they are phosphorylated by Hop. Phosphorylated Stat92e separates itself
  from the receptor, dimerize and relocate into the nucleus, where it induces the
  transcription of Thioester-containing protein genes (Teps) and Turandot (Tot) genes.
  Proteins derived from the transcription of these genes are involved in phagocytosis
  and melanization processes [, ]
