caption: 'The entry of the virus leads to activation of the innate immune system which
  comprises of macrophages and dendritic cells. Coronavirus antigens are presented
  by the dendritic cells (DC) which serve as antigen presenting cells (APC) which
  load viral antigens on MHC-1 and 2 to the T cells leading to the activation of the
  adaptive immune system. Activation of cytotoxic T cells leads to the proliferation
  of Th1 cells, Th2 cells and Th17 cells. This leads to the elaboration of several
  cytokines and chemokines producing the cytokine storm. Also, the activated macrophages
  could stimulate the MyD88 pathway leading to the activation of downstream signaling
  pathways such as MAPK and NFκB resulting in the expression of cytokines. MHC: major
  histocompatibility complex; IL: Interleukins; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; IFNγ:
  Interferons; MyD88: Myeloid differentiation primary response 88; MAPK: Mitogen activated
  protein kinase; NFκB: Nuclear factor kappa B.'
