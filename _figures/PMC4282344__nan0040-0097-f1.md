caption: Pathways implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Familial Alzheimer's disease
  (FAD) is caused by one of three genes (PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP) involved in the amyloid
  processing pathway (‘the amyloid cascade’). There is no single pathway that explains
  the more common nonfamilial, late-onset/sporadic Alzheimer's disease (LOAD/sAD).
  Candidate genes are enriched for several pathways; Cholesterol Metabolism, Immune
  System and Endocytosis. These pathways may be downstream dependent or independent
  of amyloid processing.
