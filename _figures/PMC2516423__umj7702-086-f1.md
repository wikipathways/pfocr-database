caption: The control of erythropoietin synthesis by the oxygen sensing pathway.In
  the presence of oxygen HIFalpha is hydroxylated by the prolyl hydroxylase PHD2 and
  once modified the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein is able to bind. HIFalpha is then
  targeted to the proteasome. In the absence of oxygen HIFalpha is not hydroxylated
  and VHL does not associate thereby allowing HIFalpha to bind to hypoxia response
  elements (HRE) in target genes such as EPO.
