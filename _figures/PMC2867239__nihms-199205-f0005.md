caption: Modified from . Smo is activated through a series of steps and conformations
  that can be stabilized by small molecule regulators of Hh signaling. Full activation
  of Smo requires the transport of inactive cytoplasmic Smo (red) from the cytoplasm
  into the cilium controlled by step R1. The Smo antagonists SANT-1 and -2 stabilize
  Smo in this inactive state. Smo within the cilium can exist in an inactive state
  (blue) that is trafficked out of the cilium when no further activation is achieved
  (R3). This inactive form is stabilized by the antagonist cyclopamine. Smo can be
  activated (green) through a second step, R2, to promote activation of downstream
  pathway components such as Gli proteins. This state is promoted by Shh signal, and
  can be stabilized by the Smo agonist SAG as well as activating mutations such as
  SmoM2. IFT-Dynein mediates retrograde transport of Smo (R3) in either an active
  or inactive state, as Dync2h1 mutant cilia constitutively localize Smo without Shh
  pathway activation. The mechanisms that deliver Smo to the cilium are not known.
