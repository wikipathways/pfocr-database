caption: Possible mechanisms of 3-BP’s killing actions to cells. After entering the
  cell through MCTs’ channels, 3-BP inhibits glycolytic enzymes (i.e., HK2, GAPDH)
  and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway (i.e., complex II/SDH). Additionally,
  3-BP leads to a reduction in the amount of glutathione while increasing the level
  of ROS. By disrupting the mitochondrial electron transport chain, 3-BP leads to
  the generation of mitochondrial-dependent ROS, which results in mtDNA damage. Excess
  ROS may potentially induce damage to genomic DNA.
