caption: The pathogenesis of IBD. Nod2 is highly expressed in Paneth cells and myeloid
  cells. Nod2 activated by muramyl dipeptide can activate the NF-κB pathway to produce
  α-defensins that directly regulate gut bacteria in Paneth cells. Nod2 signaling
  can drive the Th2-type immune response with the synergistic signals of OX40L and
  TSLPR. CARD9 is highly expressed in myeloid cells and can activate the NF-κB pathway
  to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17A, IL-1β and IL-6.
  When CARD9 mutates to CARD9S12N, it can induce a Th2-type immune response. The IL-23
  signaling pathway of Th17 cells is critical in the development of IBD. PTPN2 mediated
  interactions between intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages are necessary for
  maintaining the intestinal barrier function. The gut bacteria also affect the immune
  system by interacting with immune cells. DCs can induce Th0 cells to differentiate
  by producing different cytokines. Immune imbalance can cause excessive IL-13, IFN-γ
  and TNF-α to induce apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. Destruction of the
  intestinal barrier and invasion of the gut microbiota further leads to severe inflammation.
