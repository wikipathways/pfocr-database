caption: '(A) Without Sema3 or Nrps, the majority of PDE4D resides in the cytoplasm
  rather than being associated with the cell membrane, where cAMP is produced by AC.
  As peri-membrane cAMP is not easily accessible to cytoplasmic PDE4D for degradation,
  its concentration remains high, which leads to high PKA activity and inhibition
  of Hh signaling. (B) In the presence of Sema3 and Nrps, PDE4D is recruited to the
  cell membrane and thus brought into close proximity to its target cAMP. This results
  in reduced cAMP concentration in the entire cell and at the cilium base. Consequently
  PKA is inhibited, which promotes Hh signal transduction. In this process, inhibition
  of PKA by Sema3-Nrp signal per se is insufficient to turn on Hh signaling; instead
  it enhances Hh signaling once Shh turns on the pathway. Abbreviations: AC: Adenylyl
