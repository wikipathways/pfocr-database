caption: The mechanism of how taurine relieves S. uberis infection by activating autophagy.
  From the above results, we infer that taurine enters the cells through transporters
  (TauT and PAT 1) to improve PTEN activity, promote the conversion of PIP3 to PIP2,
  and inhibit PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby attenuating the phosphorylation
  of ULK1 and ATG13 by mTOR, promoting the formation of ULK1-ATG13-FIP200 complex,
  and activating autophagy of MAC-T cells. S. uberis is recognized by both TLR2 and
  TLR4, internalizes into cells and may be ubiquitinated. Then, it is mediated by
  related receptor proteins into autophagosomes and fused with lysosomes to form autolysates.
  Finally, S. uberis is degraded and eliminated by proteases and hydrolases, which
  attenuates the stimulation to cells and reduces the activation of NF-κB, inhibits
  the secretion of inflammatory factors (such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), and alleviates
  the excessive inflammatory response and damage caused by S. uberis infection.
