caption: Ferroptosis metabolic pathway. Note. Red indicated markedly up-regulated
  content of metabolites in the experimental group. Blue indicated no marked change
  of the metabolite which had been detected. Green indicated markedly down-regulated
  content of metabolites in the experimental group. Cause for the phenotypic differences
  among the research subjects was identified through metabolic pathways.
