caption: 'Proposed anti-inflammatory pathways based on reviewed nutritional interventions.
  Note: NF-κB is involved in the regulation of inflammatory response []. Polyphenols
  [], omega-3 fatty acids, TP [], vitamin C [], alpha-lipoic aicids [], and selenium
  [] inhibit activation of NF-κB by scavenging the ROS. PPAR, a transcription factor
  that inhibits activation of NF-κB, is upregulated by TP, EPA, and DHA [,]. TT suppresses
  NF-κB gene expression directly []. Selenium promotes utilization of AA by COX-1
  to generate 15d-PGJ2, an anti-inflammatory prostaglandin that inhibits NF-κB [].
  AA is metabolised by COX-2 to produce pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (PGs and Ts).
  EPA and DHA compete with AA for the substrate in the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase
  pathway to generate less pro-inflammatory substrates []. Polyphenols, TP, and TT
  inhibit the activity of COX-2 [,]. Fibres or probiotics stimulate the growth of
  saccharolytic bacteria and reduce the production of uremic toxins in the gut [].
  In addition, fermentation of soluble fibre produces SCFA, which inhibit the activities
  of NF-κB []. Abbreviations: 15d-PGJ2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2; AA, arachidonic
  acid; ALA, alpha-linolenic acid; CRP, C-reactive protein; COX, cyclooxygenase; EPA,
