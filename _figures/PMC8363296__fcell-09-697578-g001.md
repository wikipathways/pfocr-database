caption: Schematic representation of cellular energy flow and substrate metabolism
  [adapted from ]. Red indicates bioenergetic processes and “branch points” where
  changes in late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) cells occur as described in the
  text. Small script indicates LOAD-associated reductions and large script indicates
  increases in bioenergetic cell functions. A key metabolite is glucose whose uptake
  is controlled by INS/IGF-1 signaling and which is processed through glycolysis to
  pyruvate and may be converted to lactate. Lactate can be converted back to pyruvate,
  which is used in the mitochondria to produce Acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to fuel
  the citric acid cycle (CAC) that generates the reducing agents FADH2 and NADH. NADH
  is the reduced form of NAD+ that is newly synthesized or recycled and serves as
  a proton and electron transfer molecule. The protons and electrons carried by NADH
  and FADH2 are used to generate a proton gradient in the electron transfer chain
  (ETC), which includes complexes I–V, coenzyme Q, and cytochrome C, and leads to
  the production of ATP by OxPhos that produces H2O and reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  Because glycolytically produced cytosolic NADH cannot pass the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, protons and electrons are transported through the glycerol-3-phosphate
  (G3P) shuttle and malate aspartate shuttle (MAS) which generate FADH2 in the intermembrane
  space and NADH in the mitochondrial matrix, respectively. Fatty acids are transported
  to the mitochondria through carnitine carriers and their metabolism in β-oxidation
  is an alternative pathway to produce FADH2, NADH, ATP, and Acetyl-CoA. The pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) produces ribose-5- and xylulose-5-phosphate leading to the
  reduction of NAPD+ to NAPDH that is used for fatty acid biosynthesis and regeneration
  of reduced glutathione (GSH) to neutralize ROS.
