caption: The controversial issues on IL-17A in Alzheimer’s disease. (A, B). Evidence
  shows that IL-17A and IL-17A-producing Th17 cells are elevated in AD patients’ brain
  parenchyma, cerebrospinal fluid, lymph nodes and peripheral blood (A). However,
  the contrary evidence exists that IL-17A level is decreased in AD patients’ peripheral
  blood (B). (C). A diagram of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) processing pathway.
  APP is first cleaved by β-secretase β-site APP cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1) to liberate
  the soluble ectodomain of APP—soluble APPβ (s APPβ), and the intracellular domain
  C-Terminal Fragment (CTF) of APP (β-CTF). β-CTF is further processed by γ-secretase
  to release the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and Aβ peptides. (D). IL-17A induces
  Aβ accumulation by promoting Aβ production and impairing Aβ removal, which are through
  reducing the ability of microglia and macrophages to remove Aβ accumulation, and
  upregulating the APP and BACE1 expression level. Moreover, the Aβ peptides could
  bind to Toll-like receptors and activate NF-κB, which further promote IL-17A production
  and ultimately aggravate Aβ accumulation. (E). The contrary evidence shows that
  Il-17A could upregulate ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) expression
  to facilitate Aβ transportation from brain into the blood circulation, thus reducing
  Aβ accumulation. (F, G). IL-17A deteriorates cognitive function (F) whereas the
  controversial evidence support that IL-17A promotes cognition (G).
