caption: 'The primary targets of lithium in the cell are the glycogen synthase kinase
  3/A (Gsk3/A) and inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) signalling pathways. Lithium inhibits
  mammalian Gsk3 or the Dictyostelium discoideum homologue, GskA, causing changes
  in the cytoskeletan and in gene transcription. Lithium also inhibits the recycling
  of inositol phosphates, by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) and inositol
  polyphosphatase (IPPase). The ‘inositol depletion’ theory of bipolar disorder treatment
  proposes that the therapeutic effect of lithium is to reduce inositol levels in
  the cell, resulting in the attenuation of an over-stimulated InsP3signalling pathway.
  Prolyl oligopeptidase presumably regulates the cleavage of an oligopeptide signal
  controlling the activity of multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (MIPP),
  which functions to breakdown higher-order inositol phosphates to InsP3. Abbreviations:
  DAG: diacylglycerol; GS: glycogen synthase; Gsk3/A, glycogen synthase kinase A/3;
  IMPase; inositol monophosphatase; InsP5 – 6: inositol pentakisphosphate and hexakisphosphate;
  InsP3: inositol (1,3,5) trisphosphate; IPPase: inositol polyphospatase; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol
  bisphosphate; PLC: phospholipase C.'
