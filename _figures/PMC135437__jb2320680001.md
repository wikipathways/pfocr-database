caption: Carotenoid biosynthetic pathways. Carotenoid pathways are branches of the
  general isoprenoid pathway. In nature, two distinctive routes to carotenoid structures
  are known. C40 pathways, which start from the head-to-head condensation of two molecules
  of GGPP, are found in a variety of plant and microbial species. C30 pathways, which
  begin with the condensation of two molecules of FPP, have been identified only in
  a small number of bacterial species. The enzyme CrtE is a bacterial GGPP synthase;
  CrtM and CrtB are bacterial carotenoid synthases; CrtN and CrtI are bacterial carotenoid
  desaturases. PP, pyrophosphate; GPP, geranylpyrophosphate.
