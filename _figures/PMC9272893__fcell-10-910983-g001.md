caption: Multi-level regulation of unconventional secretion of IL-1. IL-1α can be
  constitutively expressed, but accumulates in the nuclear compartment. Secretion
  requires crossing the topological barriers of the nuclear membrane and the plasma
  membrane. Proform IL-1α is biologically active on the IL-1 receptor complex, but
  cleavage by certain proteases such as calpains can increase activity. Pro-IL-1β
  is often transcriptionally induced upon sensation of lower level threats to the
  host such as extracellular PAMPs or pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pro-IL-1β is translated
  and remains in the cytosol, and must cross the topological barrier of the plasma
  membrane for secretion. Cleavage of pro-IL-1β by proteases such as caspase-1 is
  required for bioactivity on the IL-1 receptor complex. IL-1Ra is the only IL-1 family
  member that is conventionally secreted through the biosynthetic pathway. IL-1Ra
  is transcriptionally induced alongside sensation of inflammatory cues and conventional
  secretion of this cytokine may buffer the action of pro-inflammatory IL-1α/IL-1β
  by blocking their interaction with IL-1R1.
