caption: The CLCA1/MAPK13 signaling pathway is initiated when environmental stimuli
  (e.g., allergen or virus) stimulate IL-13 production and subsequent activation of
  IL-13 receptor on the surface of mucous precursor cells. IL-13 receptor activation
  leads to STAT6 activation and consequent induction of CLCA1 gene expression. The
  CLCA1 protein is secreted as N-terminal and C-terminal CLCA1 (N-CLCA1 and C-CLCA1)
  peptide fragments that might activate a putative CLCA1 receptor and in turn MAPK13
  to drive a consequent increase in mucin (especially MUC5AC) gene expression and
  mucus production in airway mucous cells.
