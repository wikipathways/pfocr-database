caption: 'Signaling pathways through which macrophages regulate β-cell replication.
  M2 macrophages, not only release TGF-β1 to directly induce upregulation of SMAD7
  in β cells, but also release EGF to activate EGFR signaling that inhibits TGF-β1-activated
  SMAD2 nuclear translocation, resulting in inhibition of TGF-β receptor signaling.
  SMAD7 promotes β-cell proliferation by increasing CyclinD1 and CyclinD2 and by inducing
  nuclear exclusion of p27. M2 macrophages also secrete Wnt ligands to activate the
  Wnt signaling pathway, which induces nuclear translocation and retention of β-catenin
  to promote β-cell replication. Abbreviations: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR,
  EGF receptor; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1.'
