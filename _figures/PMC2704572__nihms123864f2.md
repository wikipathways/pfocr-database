caption: Some complement proteins can accelerate tumor growth. C5a, probably generated
  through the classical pathway, activates myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).
  Activated MDSCs migrate to tumors and produce highly immunosuppressive reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that inhibit the anti-tumor
  T-cell response. In addition, tumor cells are protected from co attack by membrane
  complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs) and soluble complement inhibitors, secreted
  in the tumor microenvironment, such as factor H (fH) and factor I (fI). Factor H
  is a cofactor for fI-mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b and accelerates the decay
  of the alternative pathway C3 convertase. The terminal complement complex (TCC)
  can be incorporated into cell membranes at sublytic doses and activate target cells.
  Unbroken lines connect complement proteins to their functions in tumor growth. Broken
  lines connect complement proteins to functions that currently can only be hypothetically
  linked to tumor growth.
