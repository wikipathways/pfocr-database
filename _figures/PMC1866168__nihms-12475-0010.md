caption: Working model of coordinated regulation of cholangiocyte secretion. Cholangiocytes
  possess numerous transporters, exchangers and channels necessary for ductal bile
  formation. The functions of these proteins on the apical plasma membrane are regulated
  by different regulatory molecules via specific receptors and the cAMP and [Ca2+]isignaling
  pathways. Secretin induces cholangiocyte bicarbonate rich fluid secretion via the
  cAMP-PKA signaling pathway by activation of apical CFTR Cl- channel resulting in
  extrusion of Cl ions, which in turn stimulate Cl-/HCO-3 exchanger and subsequent
  secretion of HCO-3. Secreted bicarbonate ions drive passive AQP1-mediated water
  transport in response to established osmotic gradients. Secretin-stimulated cholangiocyte
  secretion may be potentiated or inhibited by different regulatory molecules (e.g.,
  somatostatin, acetylcholine, nucleotides, bile acids, etc). Primary cilia located
  on the apical plasma membrane may represent a novel regulatory mechanism that is
  involved in coordinated regulation of cholangiocyte secretion (see text for details).
