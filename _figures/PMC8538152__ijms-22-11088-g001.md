caption: PI3K-AKT-mTOR interplays in genomic and non-genomic AR signaling. AR signaling
  can be classified into genomic and non-genomic signaling. Genomic AR signaling involves
  the translocation of activated AR into the nucleus, the binding to ARE of target
  genes, and the regulation of transcription activity. In contrast, non-genomic AR
  signaling does not require AR translocation and DNA binding. In general, AR activation
  is initiated from the binding of androgen to the receptor, which leads to conformational
  changes and dissociation of AR from chaperones such as HSPs. This is known as androgen-
  or ligand-dependent genomic signaling (dark green arrows). However, in the absence
  of androgens, AR can be activated via phosphorylation mediated by multiple cytoplasmic
  factors including AKT, a key biological processing factor of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.
  Thus, it is considered as ligand-independent genomic AR signaling (light green arrows).
  In turn, as non-genomic AR signaling (red arrows), the activation of AR can activate
  the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway by interacting with PI3K and AKT. Activation of PI3K-AKT
  triggers downstream effectors, including mTOR and other signaling cascades, leading
  to the promotion of growth, proliferation, survival, metabolism, migration, etc.
