caption: Different signaling pathways activated by the binding of CGs and ROS to NKS.
  (A) The diagram depicts several signaling pathways, including the positive inotropic
  effect shown in the left inset, as well as those activated by SRC and PI3K transactivation
  within caveolae. Each signaling pathway is represented by arrows of varying colors.
  Additionally, the diagram includes the representation of the ROS amplification loop.
  (B) The diagram illustrates the generation of intracellular calcium oscillations
  and the involvement of molecular components, such as IP3R, ORAi1, and STIM1, along
  with voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs). Arrows indicate the pathways. The
  “X” on NCX and NKA indicate diminished activity
