caption: Inositol mechanisms of action in cancer cells. Inositols (INS), including
  InsP6 and myo-Ins, modulate a number of different critical pathways. Available data
  suggest that the inhibition of the phosphorylation-based (P) activation of key molecular
  targets represents a basic mechanism through which inositol interferes with specific
  biological functions, eventually ending up in delaying cell replication and in fostering
  apoptosis or phenotypic differentiation. (A) Inositols inhibit pRB phosphorylation,
  thus fostering the pRB/E2F complexes formation and blocking further progression
  along the cell cycle. (B) Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphonate (PIP2) is metabolized
  to diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ins-trisphosphate (IP3) by phospholipase-C (PLC). Moreover,
  PI3K catalyzes the synthesis of PIP3 from PIP2. PIP3 is required for enabling the
  activation of ERK and Akt pathways. Indeed, by reducing both PI3K levels and its
  activity, inositols counteract the activation of the PKC/RAS/ERK pathway. Upstream
  of that pathway, inositols disrupt the ligand interaction between FGF and its receptor
  (FGF-r) by interfering with syndecan (Synd) activity as well as with the EGF-transduction
  processes involving IGF-II receptor and AP-1 complexes. Downstream of PI3K inhibition,
  Akt activation through selective phosphorylation promoted by PDK and mTORC2 is severely
  impaired upon inositol addition. Downregulation of both Akt and ERK leads consequently
  to NF-kB inhibition and reduced expression of inflammatory markers, like COX-2 and
  PGE2. Inositol-induced downregulation of presenilin-1 (PS1), when associated with
  inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway, counteracts the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT), thus reducing Wnt-activation, β-catenin (β-cat) translocation, Notch-1, N-cadherin
  (N-cad), and SNAI1 release. Inositols interfere also directly with different cytoskeleton
  components by upregulating Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and E-cadherin (Ec) and decreasing
  Fascin (F) and Cofilin, two main components of the pseudopodia. Reduced formation
  of membrane ruffling and pseudopodia, as well as inhibited release of metalloproteinases
  (MMPs), severely impairs both motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. This effect
  is reinforced by the inositol-induced inhibition on ROCK1/2 release, as well as
  by the decreased levels of phosphorylated Myosin Light Chain (MLC). Overall, these
  effects enable inositols to remodel F-actin (A) assembly and thus to reshape the
  cytoskeleton architecture. Blue arrow indicates promoting effect; red line with
  bar indicates inhibitory effect.
