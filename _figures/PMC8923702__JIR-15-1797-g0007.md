caption: Model of MBL regulating the Th17/Treg balance in C. albicans infection. (1)
  MBL efficiently inhibits C. albicans infection; (2) MBL inhibits the expression
  of TGF-β and IL-6 after infection; (3) TGF-β interacts with its receptor, TGF-βR,
  to activate Foxp3 through the SMAD3/4 signaling pathway; in addition, IL-6 interacts
  with IL-6R to activates Foxp3 through the JAK3/STAT5 signaling pathway; (4) TGF-β
  interacts with TGF-βR to activate SMAD2/4 signaling pathway and stimulate RORγt;
  (5) Foxp3 promotes the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into the Treg subgroup, whereas
  RORγt promotes the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into the Th17 subgroup; (6) MBL
  regulates inflammatory responses by promoting changes in the Th17/Treg balance.
