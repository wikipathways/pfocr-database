caption: Potential sites of canonical Wnt signaling deregulation in PD. As outlined
  in the main text, six proteins—GSK3β, LRRK2, Nurr1, Parkin, VPS35, and WNT3—have
  been linked to canonical Wnt signaling and genetic risk of PD. The sites where these
  proteins affect the canonical pathway are represented graphically. The diagram is
  divided into three sections; from left-to-right these are (i) basal canonical Wnt
  signaling, (ii) activated Wnt signaling, and (iii) Wnt secretion. (i) In the basal
  state, β-catenin, the main effector of the canonical Wnt pathway, is repressed by
  GSK3β, LRRK2, and Parkin. GSK3β phosphorylates β-catenin, triggering the ubiquitination
  (Ub) of this protein by Parkin, leading to the proteosomal degradation of β-catenin.
  (ii) Upon binding of Wnt ligand such as WNT3, LRRK2, β-catenin, GSK3β, and associated
  proteins are recruited to membrane receptor complexes. The phosphorylation of β-catenin
  by GSK3β is repressed, stabilizing β-catenin and allowing this protein to enter
  the nucleus. Nuclear β-catenin binds and transactivates target transcription factors
  including Nurr1, driving the expression of downstream genes. In both basal and activated
  conditions LRRK2 functions as a scaffolding protein. (iii) Wnt ligand secretion
  is mediated by Wntless (WTL), which transports Wnt ligands from the trans-Golgi
  network to the plasma membrane where Wnts are released. This process is dependent
  on the recycling of Wntless back from the plasma membrane, via early endosomes to
  the trans-Golgi network. This last step is mediated by the retromer complex, of
  which VPS35 is an essential component. Loss of VPS35 function leads to an accumulation
  of Wntless in the endosomal system, and decreased secretion of Wnt ligands.
