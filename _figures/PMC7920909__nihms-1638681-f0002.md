caption: Lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the interaction of spike
  protein with ACE2 present on the surface of cells. Once inside the cells, it releases
  its genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. The viral genome uses the host machinery to
  translate into polyproteins that are further proteolyzed into smaller proteins by
  viral proteinases. Discontinuous transcription of the positive-strand RNA results
  in the synthesis of subgenomic negative-strand RNA, which is translated into viral
  structural proteins and serves as a template for the replication of genomic RNA.
  Genomic RNA and nucleocapsid protein together form a nucleoprotein complex in the
  cytoplasm and assembled with other structural proteins, such as spike (S), envelop
  (E), and, membrane (M) proteins into the ER-Golgi intermediated compartment (ERGIC).
  New virus particles are released through exocytosis. Link between viral non-structural
  proteins and the Rab pathway may lead to exosome-mediated dissemination of the viral
  modulators, inflammatory mediators which needs to be explored.
