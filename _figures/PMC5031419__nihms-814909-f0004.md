caption: Mutations affecting the upstream oncogenes KIT and PDGFRA were only found
  in the genital melanoma cases and were not found in any of the genital nevi. Conversely,
  mutations found in atypical genital nevi such as BRAF, which is also common in sun-exposed
  melanomas, were not found in any of the genital melanomas. The proteins affected
  by these mutations are highlighted in blue.
