caption: The role of TRIB2 in melanoma cell, colorectal cancer cell, ovarian cancer
  cell, and osteosarcoma cell proliferation. (A) Circ_0084043 inhibits melanoma cell
  proliferation by targeting the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway through the miR-429/TRIB2 axis,
  while TRIB2 promotes melanoma cell proliferation by inhibiting FOXO. (B) TUG1 interacts
  with miR-542-3p to target TRIB2, and TRIB2 inhibits the expression of p21 through
  AP4 to promote the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. (C) TRIB2 promotes
  ovarian cancer cell proliferation by regulating the GSK3β/β-Catenin signaling pathway.
  Cisplatin promotes the transition from NER to MMR through TRIB2, thereby inhibiting
  Survivor and inducing p21 expression, leading to the arrest of ovarian cancer cells
  in the G2/M phase and inhibiting their proliferation. (D) TRIB2 interacts with AP4
  to inhibit the transcription of p21, thereby promoting the proliferation of osteosarcoma
  cells. Created with BioGDP.com. TRIB2, tribbles homolog 2; FOXO, forkhead transcription
  factor O; AP4, activating enhancer-binding protein 4; TUG1, taurine upregulated
  gene 1; NER, nucleotide excision repair; MMR, mismatch-mediated-DNA repair; GSK3β,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3β
