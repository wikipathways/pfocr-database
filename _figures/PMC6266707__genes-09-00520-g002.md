caption: Schematic representation of photosynthetic organisms as heterologous terpenoid
  biofactories. (A) In cyanobacteria and in algal chloroplasts, photosynthesis provides
  ATP and NADPH, which are, in turn, used to fix carbon dioxide. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  (G3P) links carbon fixation with the rest of metabolism. Pyruvate (PYR) is produced
  from G3P via glycolysis and these two metabolites are the precursors for the MEP
  pathway. (B) In eukaryotic algae, mitochondria produce acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) from
  which the MVA pathway is initiated and IPP/DMAPP are produced. Chloroplasts also
  contribute to the terpenoid precursor pool. Metabolite exchange between cellular
  compartments, which is not yet fully elucidated, makes terpenoid metabolism more
  complex.
