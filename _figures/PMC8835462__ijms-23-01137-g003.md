caption: 'A simplified model for the relationship among different hormones in response
  to both Al toxicity and low P. Al stress and P deficiency induce the local up-regulation
  of TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 (TAA1) and YUCCA (YUC) in the root
  transition zone through an ethylene-dependent pathway, which contributes to auxin
  accumulation in the root transition zone (TZ), suppressing primary root growth.
  Local cytokinin (CK) accumulation acts downstream of auxin signaling through ARF7/9,
  synergistically regulating the stress-induced inhibition of root growth. COI1-mediated
  jasmonate (JA) signaling is involved in stress-induced root growth inhibition through
  ALMT1-mediated malate exudation from roots to affect ROS production. In addition,
  the production of melatonin under stress conditions is able to reduce the ROS production
  and induce cell wall expansion to promote root growth. JA: jasmonic acid; COI1:
  F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1; ALMT1: aluminum-activated malate transporter1;
  LPR1: low phosphate-resistant root1; TIR1: transport inhibitor response 1; ARF:
  auxin responsive factor; RAM: root apical meristem; NO: nitric oxide; ROS: reactive
  oxygen species; ETR1: ethylene receptor1; EIN2: ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2.'
