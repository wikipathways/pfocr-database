caption: 'Expression analysis of the DGEs involved in the liquiritin synthesis pathway.
  The genes involved in liquiritin synthesis were selected from the reported studies
  (Koes et al. ; Shimada et al. ; Bibi et al. ). The expression profiles of the detectable
  DEGs were presented, with pink and blue colors to denote the high or low expression
  levels. PAL phenylalanineammonialyase, C4H Trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase, 4CL
  4-coumarate-CoA ligase, ACC Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, CHS Chalcone synthase, II-CHI:
  type II Chalcone–flavonone isomerase, GT glycosyltransferase'
