caption: 'The NF-κB pathway and subcellular localization of differentially regulated
  genes connected with NF-κB: Within the NF-κB signaling pathway a total of 26 genes
  were differentially expressed in Group 1 (a); whereas 27 genes were shown to be
  regulated in Group 2 (b). (Green marks indicate upregulation, red marks downregulation
  of the respective mRNA in 229R cells.)'
