caption: Schematic representation of multifarious antibacterial mode of action for
  α-MG. (1) α-MG shows electrostatic interaction with negatively charged bacterial
  membrane, where it binds with the bacterial inner membrane (2) in which, the strong
  hydrophobic interaction with lipid alkyl chain of cytoplasmic membrane might be
  the major driving force for the rapid bactericidal property. Further, α-MG interacts
  with the transmembrane precursor proteins via hydrogen bonding. (3) The downregulation
  of YidC2, SecA, FtsY, and MscL has evidenced that α-MG thwart the cytoplasmic membrane
  integrity. (4) The downregulation of dltA inhibits D-alanylation of anomeric teichoic
  acids and hence, the development of resistance against α-MG has been aborted. (5)
  TagG, a part of two component ABC transporter which exports the anomeric polyglycerophosphate
  chains (TAs) from cytoplasm. Inhibition of tagG shows that teichoic acid biosynthetic
  pathway has also been affected, because tagG is localized in cytoplasmic membrane.
  This might possibly due to the loss of cytoplasmic membrane integrity which resulted
  in decreased export of teichoic acids from cytoplasm. (6) DNA replication and mismatch
  repair mechanism has been downregulated upon α-MG treatment. (7) α-MG also inhibited
  fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (8) α-MG also enhanced the expression of heat shock
  proteins. (9) α-MG has also shown to increase the genes involved in oxidative stress
  response. CPM, cytoplasmic membrane; PGN, peptidoglycan.
