caption: Exogenous (Ex) rather than endogenous PGE2 activates EP3 receptor of vagal
  pulmonary C-neurons (VPCNs) to sensitize/stimulate TRPV1 via the PKA signaling pathway
  and other ion channels (Chs), while CAP/CA directly activates TRPV1. Once TRPV1
  is activated, sodium and calcium ions flowing through TRPV1 into the neuron to cause
  depolarization, leading to action potential (AP) firing upon the activation of voltage-gated
  sodium channels. In addition, PGE2 may also act on other ion channels to contribute
  to the neural excitation. The evoked action potentials transmit in vagal afferents
  to promote the release of excitatory amino acids from the central terminals that
  stimulate the second-order neurons mainly within the nucleus tractus solitarius
  (NTS). These neurons further project to the respiratory network (R network) to reflexively
  elicit cough.
