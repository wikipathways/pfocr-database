caption: Summary of the dominant effects of WNT5A mutations on skeletal morphogenesis.
  The forelimb field is injected at stage 15 prior to budding. (A) Controls (empty
  plasmid, GFP or AlkPO4 virus) show flattened chondrocyte shape, hypertrophy and
  low proliferation in the diaphysis and elongation of the cartilage condensations
  in the proximo-distal axis. (B) wtWNT5A virus slightly altered chondrocyte flattening
  and increased proliferation in the diaphysis. Hypertrophy was present similar to
  controls. wtWNT5A increased JNK-PCP activity and blocked canonical WNT signaling.
  (C) In the presence of WNT5AC83S virus, chondrocytes were rounded and randomized
  which also correlated with a lack of elongation. The mutWNT5A was less effective
  at antagonizing the canonical pathway. Mutant WNT5A blocked hypertrophy leading
  to distortion of growth. Instead of elongating proximo-distally, cartilages grew
  in the perpendicular (AP and dorsi-ventral axes). AP, anterior-posterior; DVL, dishevelled;
  FZD, frizzled; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor related protein; Pk, Prickle;
  Pr, proximal; Di, distal; r, radius; u, ulna.
