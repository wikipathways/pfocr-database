caption: 'The scheme of neuroprotective and neuroinflammatory factors in PD’s. Based
  on animal and clinical trial studies [, , , , , -] the selected factors may influence
  on neuroprotection or neuroinflammation in reducing or worsening Parkinson’s decrease.
  (A) The proper diet combined with regular physical activity can lead to neuroprotection
  and consequently lowering the markers of inflammation and free radicals damage of
  macromolecules, improving the function of mitochondria as well as reducing the risk
  of osteoporosis, which is associated with decreasing risk of falls. (B) The improper
  diet and sedentary lifestyle may induce neuroinflammation. In consequences will
  be observed an increased Hcy level, a strong risk factor for osteoporotic fractures,
  mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS generation, damage of macromolecules, muscle atrophy
  and hence a deterioration in the quality-of-life patients. Abbreviation: KYN- kynurenine
  pathway, KYNA- kynurenine acid, QUIN- quinolinic acid, PGC-1α- peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-gamma coactivator 1α, ROS-reactive oxygen species, and (indicators: ↓-decrease;
  ↑-increase).'
