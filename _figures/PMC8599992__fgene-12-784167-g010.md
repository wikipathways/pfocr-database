caption: 'Proposed model for the role of SLX4IP in promoting RAP1 SUMOylation and
  activation of the IKK—NF-κB—Notch signaling axis in cells using the ALT pathway.
  (A) SLX4IP is recruited to ALT telomeres through its interaction with SLX4. The
  presence of SLX4IP stimulates PIAS1 to SUMOylate RAP1 on K240. The SUMOylation of
  RAP1 reduces its ability to interact with TRF2 and SLX4, thus promoting its redistribution
  from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (B). There, SUMOylated RAP1 activates NF-κB
  signaling by binding to the IKKβ subunit of the IKK complex. (C) The interaction
  between SUMOylated RAP1 IKKβ triggers the phosphorylation and proteasome-dependent
  degradation of IκBα, thus liberating NF-κB and promoting its translocation into
  the nucleus. (D) Once in the nucleus, NF-κB represses the transcription of TERT
  (the catalytic subunit of telomerase), which is thought to sustain the ALT mechanism.
  Additionally, NF-κB activates the transcription of several genes, including JAG1,
  which encodes a cell surface protein and Notch ligand called Jagged-1. (E) The binding
  of Jagged-1 to a Notch receptor on a neighboring cell initiates Notch signaling
  by releasing the NICD through a cascade of proteolytic cleavages (depicted by scissors).
  The NICD is a transcription factor that works together with additional coactivators
  (RBPJ and MAML) to activate transcription of target genes, some of which include
  Notch transcription factors (F). This is thought to establish a feed-forward loop
  that sustains the ALT phenotype by controlling the expression of ALT-associated
  genes (e.g., ATRX, DAXX). Abbreviations: S, SUMO; P, phosphorylation; Ub, ubiquitin;
  NICD, Notch intracellular domain; ALT, alternative lengthening of telomeres.'
