caption: Model of Cpb1–C3–C3aR pathway amplifying p38 MAPK signaling downstream of
  TLR4 and Ifnar activation in macrophages. TLR4 and Ifnar activation through their
  respective ligands induce expression of proinflammatory genes via various mechanisms,
  including the induction of p38 MAPK (; ). C3 expression is induced downstream these
  pathways (; ), and is quickly released from macrophages (), where it is cleaved
  into C3a and C3b. Anaphylotoxin C3a can be cleaved extracellularly by Cpb1 into
  C3a-desArg (; ), where it then acts as a ligand for C3aR. We find, the activation
  of C3aR then amplifies MAPK activity through enhancing p38 MAPK phosphorylation
  downstream of TLR4 and Ifnar, but not Ifngr, activation. Due to the extracellular
  nature of this signaling pathway, the Cpb1–C3–C3aR pathway acts as a cell-autonomous
  and a non–cell autonomous amplification pathway enhancing expression of proinflammatory
  genes of self- and neighboring macrophages.
