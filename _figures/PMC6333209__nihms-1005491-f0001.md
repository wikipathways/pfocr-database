caption: Role of apoER2 signaling in antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) actions in platelets,
  endothelial cells, and trophoblasts. APL binding to the cell surface β2GPI triggers
  dimerization of the protein, which in turn associates with the first ligand-binding
  domain of apoER2. In platelets, the aPL–β2GPI complex binding causes phosphorylation
  of tyrosine residues of the receptor and dissociation from the adaptor molecule
  Dab-1, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathway. In endothelial
  cells, engagement of apoER2 inactivates eNOS by decreasing the serine phosphorylation
  of the enzyme (peNOS↓). In trophoblasts, apoER2 mediates aPL-induced attenuation
  of Akt kinase by dephosphorylating the critical serine residue of the kinase (pAkt↓).
  These intracellular signaling pathways initiated by aPL–β2GPI engagement of apoER2
  result in various cellular dysfunction, contributing thrombus formation, neointima
  hyperplasia, fetal loss, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).
