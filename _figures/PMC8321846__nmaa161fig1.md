caption: Insulin signaling promotes the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and might
  be repressed by lipid metabolic intermediates, such as diacylglycerol, ceramides,
  and intermediates of incomplete fatty acid oxidation. The skeletal muscle, adipose
  tissue, and liver are the major insulin-sensitive tissues/organs. In the fed state
  and under normal conditions, insulin activates mTORC1 and suppresses the translocation
  of FoxO from the cytoplasm to the nucleus through the IRS-PI3K-AKT pathway in the
  skeletal muscle, contributing to the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass. The insulin
  signal may also be inhibited by lipid intermediates, although the causal relation
  between increased lipid content in the skeletal muscle and insulin resistance is
  still under debate. AKT, serine/threonine kinase 1; FoxO, Forkhead box O; IRS, insulin
  receptor substrate; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; p, phosphorylated;
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
