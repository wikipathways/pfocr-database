caption: 'Scheme of retrotransposon-mediated IFN responses in SLE and DM. (A) The
  activation level of the IFN production pathway in patients with SLE and DM differed.
  Genes with significantly elevated and suppressed expression compared with those
  in the control group are highlighted in red and blue, respectively. (B) The correlation
  among genes. Genes with significantly elevated and suppressed expression compared
  with those in the control are highlighted in red and blue, respectively. The connected
  lines show the significant positive correlations between two genes calculated by
  a nonparametric Spearman’s rank correlation test. TE; transposable element, nRTK;:
  nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, TF; transcription factor.'
