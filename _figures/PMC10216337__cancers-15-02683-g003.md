caption: Schematic representing the suggested roles of and molecular pathways involving
  MeCP2 in pancreatic cancer. MeCP2 increases mesenchymal markers including snail,
  N-cadherin, and vimentin. MeCP2 simultaneously decreases epithelial markers including
  E-cadherin and ZO-1 to induce EMT. The increase and decrease of mesenchymal and
  epithelial markers, respectively, are achieved through the binding of MeCP2 to the
  Furin promoter and subsequent activation of TGF-β1 by Furin and Smad phosphorylation
  [115]. MeCP2 recruitment to the methylated CpG islands of LIN28A hinders the ability
  of LIN28A to increase the expression of NANOG, c-Myc, OCT4, SOX2, and LIN28B [116].
  MeCP2 binding to methylated CpG sites at the IL-6 gene may result in its silencing
  [117]. Illustration is generated using BioRender.com
