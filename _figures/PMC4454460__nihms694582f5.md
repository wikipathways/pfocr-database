caption: A model showing different pathways to repair replication fork damage due
  to structure-forming sequences. Srs2 and Sgs1 helicases act at the fork to facilitate
  replication across structure-forming sequences on the CTG strand (above). Srs2 can
  facilitate fork reversal, perhaps by removing Rad51 from damaged forks, to allow
  the damage to be bypassed and the fork to restart in a manner that prevents breakage
  and repeat-length changes (left arrow). Sgs1 may also help to stabilize a replisome
  stalled at the CAG•CTG repeats. In the absence of either of these helicases, single-strand
  gaps or double-strand breaks result (above). Single- or double-strand breaks can
  be processed by a Rad51-dependent sister chromatid recombination pathway, leading
  to recombination intermediates that are dissolved by Sgs1–Top3 (middle). Slippage
  associated with DNA synthesis of CAG•CTG repeats can lead to repeat contractions
  or expansions. Double-strand breaks may be repaired by homologous recombination,
  leading to trinucleotide repeat instability (right downward arrow), by Rad51-independent
  single-strand annealing (right, above), or, if unrepaired, will result in loss of
  a chromosome arm as observed in our fragility assay. Joint molecules observed by
  two-dimensional gels (shown inside the gray box) correspond mainly to reversed forks
  but may also represent some Rad51-dependent sister chromatid recombination intermediates
  (see text for details). Alternatively, damage may be processed by a template-switching
  mechanism, as proposed previously, leading to similar recombination intermediates.
  In the absence of both Sgs1 and Rad51 proteins, instability occurs by another pathway,
  in which replication slippage following formation of unresolved secondary structures
  on the lagging strand or on its template leads to contractions or expansions (dotted
  arrow, above left).
