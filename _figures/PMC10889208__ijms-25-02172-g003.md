caption: 'Fibroblasts’ pivotal role in the different phases of acute/non-impaired
  wound healing vs. chronic diabetic wound healing. Fibroblasts in (a) acute/non-impaired
  wound healing are activated and trans-differentiate into myofibroblasts upon injury
  responding to hypoxia, after stimulation of the immune system in the inflammation
  phase by inflammatory cytokines and factors. TGF-β signaling pathway is preferentially
  activated, regulating the trans-differentiation phase of fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts
  play a pivotal role in the following phases, secreting additional regulatory growth
  factors, cytokines and chemokines, stimulating proliferation of additional myofibroblasts,
  keratinocytes, and endothelial cells, and promoting angiogenesis. Myofibroblasts
  generate MMPs to break down the old ECM and generate new ECM during the remodeling
  phase and dedifferentiate into fibroblasts for clearance by macrophage phagocytosis.
  Fibroblasts in (b) chronic diabetic wound healing are impaired by additional ROS,
  AGEs, and LPSs that overstimulate the immune system, prolonging the inflammatory
  phase which is further prolonged by preferential activation of Notch signaling that
  prevents the trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Consecutive
  phases of proliferation, remodeling, and clearance are consequently altered. AGE:
  advanced glycation end product; ECM: extracellular matrix; LPSs: lipopolysaccharides.
  MMPs: matrix metalloproteinases; NOS: nitric oxide synthase; ROS: reactive oxygen
