caption: Model of GM-CSF and IL-6 signaling. GM-CSF binding to its receptor, a heterodimer
  receptor consisting of low-affinity α chain and a longer, signal-transducing β chain
  leads to conformation changes in the receptor complex and phosphorylation of Janus
  kinase 2 (JAK2). JAK2 transphosphorylates the β receptor which allows for docking
  of STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) and STAT3. STAT5 and
  STAT3 are phosphorylated by JAK2, which promotes their homo-dimerization and translocation
  to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. GM-CSFR activation also initiates
  MAPK signaling involving ERK1/2. Similarly, binding of IL-6 to IL-6Rα leads to dimerization
  with the signal-transducing membrane protein gp130 and phosphorylation of JAK1.
  JAK1 transphosphorylates the receptor leading to the recruitment and phosphorylation
  STAT3. This allows STAT3 to homodimerize and locate to the nucleus. Within the nucleus,
  phospho-STAT3 is acetylated by p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) which stabilizes
  STAT3/p300/CBP complex and promotes enhancesome formation. In addition, STAT3-monoubiquitination
  on Lys97 promotes binding to BRD4, part of the positive transcription elongation
  factor (pTEFb) complex that includes CDK9, and promotes transcription elongation
  of target genes. Both GM-CSF and IL-6 converge on STAT3 signaling suggesting that
  this common pathway may be a prime target for inhibiting vascular inflammation.
  GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
