caption: RSS1 ensures cell cycle progression, and thereby contributes to the maintenance
  of meristematic cells under undesirable environmental conditions. RSS1 stability
  is controlled by the APC/C-26S proteasome pathway, leading to RSS1 accumulation
  from G1/S to M phase. RSS1 functions primarily at the G1–S transition, possibly
  through the regulation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which antagonizes the cyclin-dependent
  protein kinase (CDK) activity. The phosphorylation states of the substrate X are
  the determinants of G1–S transition (and subsequent cell cycle progression). Under
  stressful conditions, the G1/S checkpoint is conducted by cyclin-dependent kinase
  inhibitor (CKI) to inhibit the CDK activity that leads to a restrained transition
  to S phase, whereas RSS1 sustains cell cycle progression to balance cell division
  with cell differentiation. Defects in the cell cycle progression in rss1 plants
  affect, at least, the maintenance of proliferative tissues in the roots and the
  number of dividing cells and the organization of the shoot apical meristems. The
  latter interferes with cytokinin metabolism, which in turn influences cell division
  control and anti-senescence activity. Taken together, the role of RSS1 is essential
  for growth and viability under stressful conditions.
