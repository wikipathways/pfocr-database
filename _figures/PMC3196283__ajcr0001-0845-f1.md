caption: BER pathways BER is initiated by a damage specific DNA glycosylase and APE1
  that excise the damaged base and incise the arising abasic site, respectively generating
  a DNA single strand break with a 5'-sugar phosphate. Pol β removes the 5'-sugar
  phosphate and also adds one nucleotide into the single-nucleotide gap. Finally,
  XRCC1-Lig III complex seals the remaining DNA ends. This pathway is commonly referred
  to as the short patch BER pathway (left branch). However, if the 5'-sugar phosphate
  is resistant to cleavage by Pol β, then Pol δ/ε adds 2-8 more nucleotides into the
  repair gap, generating a flap structure that is removed by FEN-1 in a PCNA-dependent
  manner. Lig I then seals the remaining DNA ends. This pathway is commonly referred
  to as long patch BER (right branch).
