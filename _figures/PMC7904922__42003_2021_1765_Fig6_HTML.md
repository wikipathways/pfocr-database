caption: Exposure to light and oxygen and oxidative phosphorylation via the ETC (electron
  transport chain) generates ROS (reactive oxygen species) that can be reduced via
  NADPH, GSH (glutathione), and antioxidant enzyme systems. NADPH is a key reducing
  equivalent that can be generated by the PPP (pentose phosphate pathway), serine
  metabolism, and ME1 (malic enzyme 1). NADPH reduces GSSG via GSR (glutathione reductase)
  to GSH, which is generated from serine metabolism and Glu (glutamate). GSH powers
  the enzyme system GPx (glutathione-peroxidase), which along with the other systems
  catalase and SOD1/2 (superoxide dismutase 1 and 2) helps reduce ROS. Nearby MGCs
  can provide Gln (glutamine) to photoreceptors, where it is converted to Glu and
  enters the TCA cycle or shunted out of the mitochondria as αKG (alpha ketoglutarate)
  via OGC (oxoglutarate carrier). IDH3 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 3), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase), PKM2 (pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2), H2O2 (hydrogen
  peroxide), Glucose-6-P (glucose-6-phosphate), GAP (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate),
  3PG (3-phosphoglyceric acid), GLUD (glutamate dehydrogenase), GOT2 (glutamic-oxaloacetic
  transaminase 2), OAA (oxaloacetate), Asp (aspartate), AGC (aspartate-glutamate carrier).
