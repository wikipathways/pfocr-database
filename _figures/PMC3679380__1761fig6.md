caption: Crosstalk between the RA-activated p38MAPK pathway and the expression of
  RAR target genes. In response to RA, p38MAPK is activated (a), and then translocates
  into the nucleus and phosphorylates MSK1 (b). Activated MSK1 phosphorylates histones
  (c) and RARα at a serine located in the LBD (d). Subsequent to conformational changes,
  the cyclin H subunit of the CAK subcomplex of TFIIH is recruited to an adjacent
  domain (e), allowing the formation of a RARα/TFIIH complex and the phosphorylation
  of the NTD by the cdk7 kinase (f). In the case of the RARγ subtype, phosphorylation
  of the NTD promotes the dissociation of coregulators, such as vinexinß (g). Finally,
  phosphorylated RARα is recruited to response elements located in the promoter of
  target genes (h).
