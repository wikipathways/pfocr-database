caption: 'Schematic illustration of EGFR transactivation by GPCR. Two mechanisms have
  been proposed and supported by the available data: TMPS and ligand-independent intracellular
  pathways. (A) TMPS: In this model, GPCR-induced EGFR transactivation depends on
  the activation of MMPs that are able to cleave EGFR ligands such as HB-EGF and stimulate
  ligand shedding. The ligands released into the extracellular space then bind to
  EGFR and stimulate the dimerization and activation of the receptors, which leads
  to the activation of signaling cascades; (B) Ligand-independent pathway: This pathway
  involves the activation of intracellular protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) such as
  Src family proteins. Src phosphorylates the tyrosines residues in the cytosolic
  domain of EGFR. The phosphorylated EGFR is able to interact with downstream signaling
  proteins, leading to the activation of various signaling pathways. Src could be
  activated by GPCR through different mechanisms; (C) Future research: Future research
  should focus on the EGFR transactivation through ligand-independent Src pathway.
  It is important to determine how Src activates EGFR, the activation status of Src-activated
  EGFR, and the effects of Src-activated EGFR on the downstream signaling cascades
  and cell functions. For example, does Src stimulates the dimerization of EGFR? Does
  Src phosphorylate all the major phosphor tyrosine (Y) residues of EGFR? What are
  the downstream signaling pathways activated and what is the physiological consequence
  of this activation?'
