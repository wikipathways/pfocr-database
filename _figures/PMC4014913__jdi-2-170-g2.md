caption: Metabolic pathways of fatty acid (FA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis,
  and mechanisms by which lipid intermediates affect hepatic insulin sensitivity.
  Excess lipid intermediates in the TAG biosynthetic pathway, such as diacylglycerol
  (DAG), phosphatidic acid (PA) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), cause insulin resistance
  by activating several serine/threonine kinases, including protein kinase C (PKC),
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), IκB kinase
  (IKK), which inhibit insulin signaling either directly through insulin receptor
  substrate (IRS)‐1 and IRS‐2 serine phosphorylation or indirectly through a series
  of transcriptional events mediated by nuclear factor (NF)‐κB. This, in turn, results
  in reduced insulin activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3‐kinase and Akt. Ceramide
  can also impair insulin action through interactions with Akt. Reduced Akt activation
  resulting in lower fork‐head box (FOX)O phosphorylation leads to increases in the
  transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxycarboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose‐6‐phosphatase
  (G6Pase). This enhances gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose output (adapted from
  Nagle et al.). Copyright 2009 The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular
