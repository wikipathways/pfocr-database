caption: Glycolysis and its relationship with other metabolic pathways in TNBC. Due
  to higher glucose uptake in TNBC, the pyruvate produced from glucose enters the
  TCA cycle in mitochondria as Ac-CoA (acetyl coenzyme A). The malate that exits or
  is converted from pyruvate forms asparagine, whose high expression is associated
  with poor prognosis in TNBC. The high LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) expression allows
  elevated lactate efflux, which acidifies extracellular matrix and promotes tumor
  aggressiveness. Upregulated protein glycosylation via the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP) and increased NADPH production is described by upregulated pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) and serine synthesis. Additionally, higher fatty acid synthesis
  (FAO) characterized in TNBC also promotes the energy utilization of tumor cells.
