caption: The biosynthetic pathway of essential amino acids completed by Arsenophonus
  sp. and P. maidis. The KEGG pathway analysis was conducted, and EC numbers are shown
  above. The EC numbers in red font within red boxes represent enzymes that were found
  in the P. maidis transcriptome; those in blue font within blue boxes represent enzymes
  that were found in the Pm Arsenophonus genome; and those in blue font within red
  boxes indicate enzymes that were found in both. Essential amino acids are shown
  in solid green circles
