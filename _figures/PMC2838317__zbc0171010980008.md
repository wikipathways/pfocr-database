caption: Differences between TRAIL- and AD5-10-induced signaling pathways. In the
  initiation stage of the caspase cascade, FADD and caspase-8 are recruited to DR5
  (and possibly DR4) DISC. c-FLIP is involved in DISC formation in non-small cell
  lung cancer. Moreover, unlike TRAIL and other reported agonistic antibodies for
  DR5, AD5-10 particularly induces ROS accumulation and time-dependent reduction of
  GSH and GSSG content in the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of Jurkat leukemia cells.
  ROS scavengers, antioxidant (N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC)) and GSH, suppress AD5-10-triggered
  cell death by inhibiting the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease
  G (EndoG), which contribute to the fragmentation of the nuclear DNA. Under ROS stress,
  JNK was triggered simultaneously and a subsequent secondary activation of JNK was
  observed; NF-κB was also activated during this time course.
