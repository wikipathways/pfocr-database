caption: 'Metabolism of adenosine. Adenosine is generated mainly by two enzymatic
  systems: intra/extracellularly localized nucleotidases and cytoplasmic S-adenosylhomocysteine
  hydrolase (SAHH). In response to hypoxia/cellular damage or other stressful/inflammatory
  stimuli, ATP is rapidly dephosphorylated by combined effects of adenylate cyclase
  (AC), phosphodiesterases (PDE) and nucleotidases to form intra/extracellular adenosine.
  Ecto-5′-nucleotidase (ecto-5′-NT) is one such enzyme that plays an important role
  in regulating local adenosine production for receptor signaling. Extracellular adenosine
  can interact with adenosine receptors (AR) that are coupled to heterotrimeric G
  proteins, which, in turn, couple AR activation to various effector molecules that
  can regulate second-messenger systems to influence cell and tissue function. Adenosine
  can also be deaminated to inosine by adenosine deaminase (ADA) that can exist intra-
  or extracellularly, or it can be transported into and out of the cells via membrane-associated
  nucleoside transporters. Intracellular adenosine is generated from the dephosphorylation
  of AMP by a cytosolic form of nucleotidase (cyto-5′-NT) or the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine
  by SAHH. Adenosine can also be phosphorylated back to AMP by adenosine kinase (AK).
  AMP can also be directly deaminated to inosine monophosphate (IMP) by AMP deaminase.
  The reaction of phosphorylation predominates when adenosine occurs at a low physiological
  concentration (<1 µM), whereas ADA is activated at higher concentrations of the
  substrate (>10 µM). Hypoxanthine is formed after the removal of ribose from inosine
  by the actions of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) PNP has only negligible
  activity towards adenosine and degrades mainly inosine. Hypoxanthine can be salvaged
  back to IMP by hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), which is again converted
  to AMP through the purine nucleotide cycle (PNC). Hypoxanthine can also enter the
  xanthine oxidase (XO) pathway to form xanthine and uric acid sequentially as byproducts'
