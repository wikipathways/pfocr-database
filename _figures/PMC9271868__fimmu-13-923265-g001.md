caption: PLA2-driven lipid mediator pathways. Lysophospholipids (such as lysophosphatidylcholine
  (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), lysophosphatidylserine (LPS), lysophosphatidylglycerol
  (LPG), lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) and LPA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (such
  as AA, EPA and DHA) released from membrane phospholipids (PC, PE, PS, phosphatidylinositol
  (PI), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidic acid (PA)) by PLA2 are metabolized
  by downstream enzymes into various lipid mediators, which in turn act on their specific
  receptors on target cells. In the PLA2-lysophospholipid axis, various lysophospholipids
  are converted by autotaxin (ATX) into LPA, and alkyl-LPC is converted by LPC acyltransferase
  2 (LPCAT2) into PAF. In the PLA2-PUFA axis, ω6 AA released by PLA2 is metabolized
  into prostanoids including PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, PGI2, TXA2, and 12-hydroxyheptadecatrenoic
  acid (12-HHT) via the COX pathway involving COX-1 or COX-2 and terminal PG synthases
  (PGDS, PGES, PGF2α synthase (PGFS), PGI2 synthase (PGIS) and TXA2 synthase (TXAS)),
  or into LTB4 and cysLTs (LTC4, D4 and E4) via the 5-LOX pathway involving 5-LOX,
  its cofactor 5-LOX-activating protein (FLAP), and terminal LT synthases (LTA4H and
  LTC4S). Combined actions of 15-LOX and 5-LOX give rise to lipoxins (e.g., LXA4),
  an AA-derived SPM. ω3 PUFAs (e.g., EPA and DHA) are metabolized by LOXs and/or CYP450s
  into various SPMs including hydroxy-EPA (e.g., 18-HEPE), hydroxy-DHA (e.g., 14-
  and 17-HDHAs), E- and D-series resolvins (e.g., RvE1-3 and RvD1-6), protectin D1
  (PD1), maresins (e.g., MaR1-2), and ω3 epoxides (e.g., 17,18-EpETE).
