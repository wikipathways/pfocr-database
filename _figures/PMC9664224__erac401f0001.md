caption: 'The green world of TOR: the main external and internal signals integrated
  by TORC1 and its antagonist SnRK1 complex regulate metabolic processes and developmental
  transitions in photosynthetic organisms. Starting at the top-left and moving clockwise
  around the outside of the figure: an ATP molecule; a thermometer representing temperature;
  the sun and moon representing light/dark cycles, and the circadian clock; nitrogen,
  amino acids, and nucleotides; sulfur; molecules of the hormones auxin, cytokinin,
  brassinosteroid, and abscisic acid; carbon, sugars representing sucrose, and a hexagon
  representing glucose; sugar starvation. These shaded and white spaces describe the
  biological processes integrated by the TORC1 signaling pathway. The outer circle
  shows the plant (Arabidopsis) developmental transitions controlled by TORC1/SnRK1.
  Starting at the top and moving clockwise: seeds; germinated seedlings; vegetative
  development; flowering transition; senescence. The next circle shows the algae (Chlamydomonas)
  cell cycle controlled by TORC1/SnRK1. Starting at the top and moving clockwise:
  a single cell; a growing cell; dividing cells; release of the daughter cells. The
  central part of the figure represents a cell and the metabolic processes regulated
  by TORC1/SnRK1. TORC1 is composed of TOR, Regulatory-Associated Protein of TOR 1
  (RAPTOR), and Lethal with Sec13 protein 8 (LST8). The processes of respiration,
  transcription, translation, photosynthesis, and autophagy are highlighted inside
  the cell. Blocked lines indicate inhibition, and the dashed line implies a mutual
  inhibitory relationship that needs to be further characterized. Created with BioRender.com.'
