caption: Overview of acetylcholinergic signaling. Acetylcholine (ACh), sourced from
  precursors choline and acetyl-CoA, leaves the presynaptic neuron’s axon terminal
  through vesicle-mediated exocytosis. Acetylcholine molecules diffuse through the
  synapse, until binding with cholinergic receptors (CR) in the membrane of the postsynaptic
  signal-recipient neuron’s dendrite. This binding event permits influx of calcium
  ions into the dendrite. Ionic membrane depolarization activates an action potential,
  causing an electrical signal to be propagated down the length of the axon in a series
  of ion transport events, until the signal reaches the axon terminal and is translated
  again into neurotransmitter signals destined to reach the next neuron’s dendrite.
