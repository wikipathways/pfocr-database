caption: 'Summary of possible IL-24-induced effects. The figure depicts schematically
  our view of the effects that different sources and delivery modes of IL-24 can have
  on receptor-positive or -negative cells. The left side of the scheme shows receptor-mediated
  activation of the Jak/STAT pathway and subsequent regulation of STAT target genes
  on receptor-positive (IL-20R1/IL-20R2 and/or IL-22R/IL-20R2) cells by different
  forms of IL-24: 1. human IL-24: human endogenous IL-24, 2. Hek-IL-24: human IL-24
  expressed from Hek cells, 3. mouse IL-24: commercially available human IL-24 expressed
  from mouse cells. On the right- hand side receptor-independent effects are shown:
  4. GST-IL-24: recombinant fusion protein expressed from bacteria, 5. plasmid IL-24:
  plasmid-encoded IL-24, over-expressed following nucleofection, 6. Ad-IL-24: IL-24,
  with or without signal peptide, transduced by modified adenoviruses. Only IL-24
  in combination with an adenoviral expression backbone may kill target melanoma or
  other cancer cells while intracellular overexpression of IL-24 or any other kind
  of IL-24 on its own does not lead to increased cell death. In this context, we have
  recently shown the lack of apoptosis-inducing effects of different forms of IL-24
  (light blue box, no. 2–5) on melanoma cells.'
