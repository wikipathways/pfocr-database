caption: The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome has involved in the pathogenesis of
  several renal diseases including acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease
  (CKD), diabetic nephropathy (DN), IgA nephropathy (IgAN), etc. In the canonical
  pathway, NLRP3 functions as a pattern recognition receptor for danger signal. Stimulation
  with danger or inflammatory signals triggers the formation of a large multimolecular
  complex, namely, NLRP3 inflammasome, where caspase-1 is activated to cleave its
  substrates including the precursors of inflammatory cytokine IL-1β to its bioactive
  form and leads to cell death called pyroptosis. In the non-canonical pathway, NLRP3
  inflammasome mainly dependent on caspase-11/caspase-4 or caspase-8, leading to macrophage
  death. NLRP3 gene knockout has protective effect on ischemia/reperfusion induced
  AKI (I/R-AKI), but not on cisplatin induced AKI. IL-1β inhibition has no protective
  effect on I/R-AKI.
