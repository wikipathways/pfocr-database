caption: 'The inhibition of ROS by zinc reduces glucose toxicity. Zinc stimulates
  metallothionein transcription. Metallothionein itself has antioxidant effects. Zinc
  provides protection against immune-mediated free radical attack by protecting sulfhydryl
  (SH) groups against oxidation and participation in the inhibition of the free radical
  production in the Haber Weiss cycle by competing with transition metals. Zinc contributes
  to SH stabilization by protecting proteins from oxidation. It has also been shown
  to reduce directly .O2 and .OH- radicals, H2O2, and xanthine oxidase levels, thereby
  improving mitochondrial function. Decreasing these radicals decreases lipid peroxidation.
  Zinc also stimulates PDX-1 insulin promoter activity, and inhibits xanthine oxidase
  activity, thereby reducing lipid peroxidation. +: stimulation of pathway. -: inhibition
  of pathway.'
