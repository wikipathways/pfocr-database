caption: Regulation ModelIFN priming results in reduced spermidine, accompanied by
  increased glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation, facilitating DC responding
  to weak signal. TLR7 ligand stimulation further aggravates the metabolic shift.
  Addition of spermidine restrains the process and prevents DC from overactivation
  in autoimmune disease. The transcription factor FOXO3 adapts its activity to the
  metabolic change and mediates the anti-inflammatory effect of spermidine by altering
  phosphorylation levels at different sites.
