caption: Hypothetical Scheme Showing the Possible Signaling Circuitry That Controls
  Cytokinesis in Arabidopsis.Components in the NACK-PQR pathway are shown. The MPK4
  MAPK plays a crucial role downstream of MKK6/ANQ MAPKK during formation of the cell
  plate. MPK4 might repress transcription of the MPK11 gene in a cytokinesis-independent
  manner (1); alternatively, the proper progression of the formation of the cell plate
  that is mediated by MPK4 might repress the transcription of MPK11 (cytokinesis-dependent
  mechanism) (2).
