caption: Pathways in Drosophila involved in aging innate immunity. The Toll pathway
  is traditionally activated by Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, and it is also implicated
  in the response to viral infection, heat shock, and cold shock stresses. Toll activation,
  via its ligand Spätzle (Spz), leads the degradation of the Cactus inhibitor and
  subsequent nuclear localization of the NF-κB transcription factors Dif and Dorsal.
  This leads to the transcription of antimicrobial genes such as Drosomycin and Metchnikowin.
  The Immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is primarily activated by Gram-negative bacteria,
  and is also implicated in the response to viral infection and desiccation stress.
  Activation of the IMD pathway leads to the nuclear localization of the NF-κB transcription
  factor Relish and subsequent transcription of genes, including Diptericin, Drosocin,
  Cecropin, Attacin, and Pirk. The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
  transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is activated via Unpaired (Upd) cytokine detection
  in response to viral and bacterial infection, aging, and stress. This leads to the
  nuclear localization of the Drosophila Stat92E factor and subsequent activation
  of transcription. The Drosophila Insulin/Insulin Growth Factor/Target of Rapamycin
  (IIS/TOR) signaling network regulates growth and nutrition via binding of insulin-like
  peptides (dILPs) to the insulin receptor (dInR). There is a singular insulin substrate,
  Chico, that induces two downstream signaling cascades, one via the Akt1 kinase and
  the other via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The IIS/TOR network
  is impacted by viral (dFOXO specifically), Gram-positive, and Gram-negative bacterial
  infections, as well as starvation stress. Activation of dInR subsequently affects
  the activity of the Target of Rapamycin (dTOR) factor, as well as the dFOXO transcription
  factor.
