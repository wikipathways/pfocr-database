caption: 'Interestingly, the participation of at least four adaptor proteins containing
  Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains that can be recruited by activated TLRs results
  in important branching of the signal transduction and yields a significant flexibility
  to TLR signaling by allowing cross-talk with other pathways, including MAP kinase,
  PKR and Notch patways (). These adaptor proteins are recruited by TLRs by homophilic
  interactions between their TIR domains and are utilized differently by the TLRs.
  TLR5, TLR7 and TLR9 were shown to depend on recruitment of MyD88 to signal [, ],
  whereas TLR3 is the only TLR that does not use MyD88 []. TLR4, on the other hand,
  can use all four adaptor proteins: MyD88, TRIF, Mal/TIRAP and TRAM [-]. Even though
  activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway is usually effected by all TLRs, the timing
  of NF-κB activation [, ] as well as the additional signaling pathways that are activated
  by the branching of the signal varies among TLR receptors and with the participation
  of different adaptor proteins. These variations will ultimately affect the biological
  result in terms of gene expression and can provide opportunities for therapeutic
  manipulation of signaling by some of the pathways activated by cross-talk. This
  is demonstrated by the finding that even though NF-κB activation is observed after
  TLR4 stimulation by LPS, this may or may not result in inflammatory gene expression
  depending on the adaptor protein used. In wild-type cells, LPS stimulation results
  in inflammatory cytokine expression, whereas in MyD88-deficient cells LPS fails
  to induce cytokine expression. In the absence of MyD88, activation of NF-κB occurs
  with delayed kinetics in comparison to wild-type cells []. This delayed activation
  of NF-κB is dependent on TRIF, and interestingly both pathways involve activation
  of TRAF6/TAK1 which are common upstream activators of other signaling pathways such
  as MAP kinases.'
