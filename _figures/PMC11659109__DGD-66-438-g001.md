caption: Triggers for postnatal metabolic shift. During fetal development, glucose
  metabolism is dominant in the myocardium under hypoxic conditions, maintaining proliferative
  capacity. This hypoxic metabolism is regulated by genes such as Hif1a and UCP2.
  Postnatally, changes induced by extracardiac factors such as GLA in breast milk,
  thyroid hormones, and sympathetic innervation induce reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  generation through mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (see Figure 2) and epigenetic
  alterations via a histone modification enzyme Kdm2. Postnatal metabolic transitions
  contribute to the loss of cardiac regeneration capacity through these mechanisms,
  and possibly other unknown pathways. Images are created using BioRender.com
