caption: A model for the functions and acquisition pathways of acetyl-CoA in multiple
  organelles of Toxoplasma. Toxoplasma has multiple ways to produce and use acetyl-CoA
  in different organelles. It can be generated from pyruvate by BCKDH or PDH in the
  mitochondrion and apicoplast, respectively, which is then used to fuel the TCA cycle
  in the mitochondrion, or the FAS II pathway for fatty acid synthesis in the apicoplast.
  Acetyl-CoA can also be generated by ACS or ACL in the cytosol, using acetate or
  citrate as substrates, respectively. In the nucleus, acetyl-CoA may be generated
  by ACS, or it is imported from the cytosol, to enable protein acetylation. Acetyl-CoA
  is also a critical substrate for fatty acid elongation pathway FAE in the ER, but
  no acetyl-CoA synthesis has been reported in the ER. By contrast, the TgAT1 transporter
  is probably involved in translocating cytosolic acetyl-CoA to the ER. Glu, glucose;
