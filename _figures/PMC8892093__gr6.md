caption: Summary of the role of Antroquinonol in the context of AD pathophysiology.Antroquinonol
  administration leads to a decrease of Aβ levels in the brain, which is forms through
  the cleavage of APP. Briefly, APP can be processed through non-amyloidogenic or
  amyloidogenic pathways, with the latter being more prominent in AD brains. Cleavage
  by β-secretase of APP produces sAPPβ and CTFβ (after APP endocytosis). CTFβ is then
  cut by γ-secretase into Aβ and AICD fragments. Exocytosis of Aβ and sAPPβ back into
  the extracellular space then occurs. Aβ accumulates, and its oligomerisation, leads
  to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain. The non-amyloidogenic pathway
  consists of APP cleavage by α-secretase; which produces sAPPα, and CTFα, with CTFα
  being further cleaved by γ-secretase, leading to generation of p3 and AICD fragments.
  All products part of non-amyloidogenic pathway are non-pathogenic. Antroquinonol
  can also reduce inflammation in the neurons notably by its action on Nrf2 expression
  and reduction of NF-kB, TNF-α and IL-1β levels produced by reactive neuroglial cells.
  Actions of Antroquinonol can therefore lead to reduction of learning and memory
  impairment, neuronal loss and inflammatory and oxidative responses.
