caption: Under normoxia, the energy metabolism is mainly govern by MYC, which activates
  the glycolytic flow by transcriptionally expressing a series of glycolytic enzymes,
  such as GLUT1, HK2, PKM2, and LDH1. Since NDRG members are normally repressed by
  MYC, the mitochondrial energy metabolism is maintained as an active state. Under
  hypoxia, however, the energy metabolism is govern by HIF-1 instead of MYC. HIF-1
  keeps the glycolytic flow by expressing glycolytic enzymes but restricts the mitochondrial
  energy metabolism, which is attributed to reduced biogenesis of mitochondria and
  to increased PDK1, an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase. HIF-1 also upregulates
  NDRG1, −2 and −4 by directly activating these genes and by indirectly blocking the
  MYC-mediated repression of these genes. NDRG1 inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  by blocking LRP6 phosphorylation and activation. β-catenin is suppressed by both
  NDRG2 and HIF-1, leading to further repression of MYC. NDRG4 inhibits AKT phosphorylation
  and activation, thereby suppressing the PI3K-mediated glycolysis. NDRG3 is stabilized
  in hypoxia by lactate accumulation, and induces various hypoxic responses by activating
  the c-Raf-ERK pathway. Consequently, HIF-1 and NDRGs cooperatively achieve metabolic
  reprogramming under hypoxia.
