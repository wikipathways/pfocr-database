caption: Proposed model for MC-LR-induced testis germ cell apoptosis in rats via SIRT1
  signaling pathway activation. MC-LR exposure downregulated SIRT1 levels in primary
  co-cultured Sertoli–germ cells and rat testes, subsequently increasing p53 and Ku70
  acetylation, and Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 expression. RES pretreatment could
  promote the activation of SIRT1, which could resist MC-LR-induced apoptosis via
  reducing the acetylation of p53 and Ku70, as well as Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3 activation.
