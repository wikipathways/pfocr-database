caption: A. TNF ligation results in recruitment of RIPK1, TRADD, cIAP1 and cIAP2,
  and TRAF2 and TRAF5 to the TNFR1 to form complex I. cIAP1 and cIAP2 mediate Lys63-linked
  ubiquitylation of RIPK1, enabling docking of TAK1 (transforming-growth-factor-β-activated-kinase-1)
  and its binding partners TAB2 and TAB3. The signal is then perpetuated to IKK ((IκBα
  (inhibitor of kappa B) kinase)), which degrades IκBα, the cytoplasmic inhibitor
  of canonical NFκB. Once liberated from IκBα, NFκB translocates to the nucleus where
  it drives the transcription of pro-survival genes as well as feedback antagonists.
  Two pro-survival NFκB target genes are A20 and FLIP which promote association of
  RIPK1 with cytoplasmic RIPK3, TNF-receptor-associated-death-domain (TRADD), FADD,
  caspase-8 and the NF-κB target FLIP to form the death-inducing signaling complex
  (DISC). FLIPL can hetrodimerize with Caspase-8 and facilitate the cleavage and degradation
  of CYLD, RIP1K and RIPK3. However, the DISC also enables homo-dimerization and catalytic
  activation of caspase-8, which activates caspase-3 and caspase-7 to induce apoptosis.
  When caspase-8 is deleted or inhibited, RIPK1 interacts with RIPK3, resulting in
  the formation of the necrosome, an interaction that can be inhibited by necrostatin
  1 (nec-1). RIPK3 recruits and phosphorylates MLKL, leading to the formation of oligomers
  that translocate to the plasma membrane. Once at the plasma membrane, MLKL forms
  membrane-disrupting pores, regulating both Na+ and Ca2+ influx, resulting in membrane
  rupture. B. cIAPs also function as negative regulators of the non-cannonical NF-kB
  pathway. In resting cells, a complex encompassing cIAP1, cIAP2, TRAF2 and TRAF3
  targets and degrades NIK. Upon ligation of TNFR1, the TRAF2-TRAF3-cIAP1/2 complex
  is recruited to the receptor, changing the substrate specificity from NIK to the
  components of the complex. This results in increased NIK levels, phosphorylation
  of IKKα and p100, proteolytic processing of p100 to p52, and translocation to the
  nucleus. When cIAPs are depleted the canonical NFκB pathway is inhibited whereas
  the non-canonical NFκB pathway is not. Under these conditions, the large (~2-MDa)
  ripoptosome is assembled and, similarly to complex IIa, can stimulate caspase-8-mediated
  apoptosis.
