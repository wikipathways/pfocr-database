caption: This optophysiological tool combines two features in one functional unit,
  the internalization after the binding of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) and
  the light-gated influx of cations, including Ca2+, via CatCh upon illumination.
  a. The CXCR4-protein was placed at the N-terminus, followed C-terminally by eYFP
  and the β-subunit of the rat HK-ATPase, to combine the intracellular C-terminus
  of eYFP with the extracellular N-terminus of ChR2 (aa 1–309). b. Schematic overview
  of the light-induced intracellular Ca2+signaling mediated by tCXCR4/CatCh in an
  eukaryotic cell. In this optogenetic application the SDF1/CXCR4 signaling pathway
  (1–4) is used to induce internalization of tCXCR4/CatCh in endosomes. 1. tCXCR4/CatCh
  is expressed heterologously in the mammalian cell and trafficked towards and integrated
  into the plasma membrane. There, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 will be activated
  by its endogenous ligand SDF1. 2. Upon SDF1-activation tCXCR4/CatCh is internalized.
  As the Ca2+ concentration in the cell environment is four magnitudes higher than
  within the cell, also the calcium concentration in these endosomes is considerably
  higher than in the cytosol. 3. The endosome is trafficked into intracellular areas
  of the cell. 4. Upon illumination with blue light, CatCh will open and release Ca2+
  ions into the cytosol, resulting in a local intracellular increase of Ca2+. This
  transient Ca2+ signal might be used for triggering Ca2+-dependent physiological
  processes by light. N = nucleus, M = mitochondrion.
