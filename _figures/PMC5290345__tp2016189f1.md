caption: The potential effects of propionic acid on the citric acid cycle. (a) The
  citric acid cycle and associated electron transport chain complexes. The citric
  acid cycle is represented in the yellow circle with the enzymes of the cycle in
  blue ovals and the metabolites in black. The electron carriers derived from the
  citric acid cycle are represented in green ovals. These carriers are used by complex
  I and complex II of the electron transport chain (upper right corner) to produce
  energy. Complex V uses the energy produced by the electron transport chain to produce
  adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy carrier of the cell. (b) Predicted changes
  in citric acid cycle metabolism in the context of high propionic acid levels. Propionic
  acid uses a pathway that consumes acetyl-CoA to produce succinyl-CoA, an intermediate
  of the citric acid cycle. Thus, in the context of propionic acid, the first steps
  in the citric acid cycle may be bypassed and the production of nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide (NADH) may decrease. (c) 3-Nitropropionic acid (3NP), which could be
  generated from reactive nitrogen species interacting with propionic acid, inhibits
  succinic dehydrogenase, an important enzyme that produces a key energy carrier.
  This will not only decrease the production of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2)
  but also the steps following, including malate dehydrogenase, another step that
  produces an electron carrier, NADH. This figure was adapted from Figures 1 and 2
  in Frye et al.
