caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of heat production in cells. A) Shivering thermogenesis:
  This process is initiated by a short period of cold perception. This results in
  an activity of striated muscle cells, which produce irisin and uncoupling protein
  3 (UCP3). Production of irisin leads to increased mitochondrial biogenesis, increased
  UCP3 expression by striated muscle cells, and, eventually, the initiation of the
  process of browning of white adipocytes.UCP3 inhibits the production of reactive
  oxygen species in mitochondria, whose numbers and activity in striated muscle cells
  are increased.[ 38 ] B) Nonshivering thermogenesis: This highly complex process
  occurs only in brown adipocytes activated by noradrenaline due to prolonged exposure
  to cold. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is produced in the signaling pathway
  leading from the β3‐adrenergic receptor. cAMP contributes to the deiodinase II expression.
  This enzyme converts thyroxin (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), which regulates the
  expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1).[ 39 ] UCP1 is the crucial molecule of
  non‐shivering thermogenesis, as it ensures heat production on the inner mitochondrial
  membrane, where it can uncouple the energy of the proton gradient from ATP production.
  cAMP also stimulates the production of free fatty acids (FFA) from lipids stored
  in droplets. FFA is the energy source in the β‐oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondrial
  matrix.[ 40 ] C) The activities of ion pumps localized on membranes ER/SR–endoplasmic
  reticulum/sarcoplasmic reticulum, WA–white adipocyte'
