caption: Simplified schematic of IA biosynthetic pathway in Y. lipolytica. Engineered
  Y. lipolytica uptakes and converts extracellular carbon sources such as glucose
  and waste cooking oil into IA products. Genes and metabolites of the native TCA
  and glyoxylate cycle pathway are identified in black, while heterologously introduced
  genes are shown in green and the endogenous genes used in this paper are shown in
  red. LIP2, lipases; POX1-6, six difffferent acyl-CoA oxidases; MFE1, multifunctional
  enzyme; POT1, peroxisomal thiolase; PEX10, a proteins required for peroxisome assembly;
  CAT, carnitine acetyltransferases; ICL, isocitrate lyase; CAD, iso-aconitic acid
  decarboxylase; ACO, aconitase; MLS, malate synthase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase;
  CIT, citrate synthase.
