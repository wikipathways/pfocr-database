caption: Schematic representation of photobiomodulatory effects through its action
  on the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase and activation of several signaling molecules.
  Following photobiostimulation, the mitochondrial chromophore, cytochrome C oxidase
  lead to ROS generation which in turn activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, while the effector
  enzyme, adenylyl cyclase, converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP could either activate
  pKA and RAS which further leads SIRT and ERK Signaling to promote cell survival,
  inhibit inflammatory processes, and apoptosis. NO release could also lead to NO-mediated
  vasodilation.
