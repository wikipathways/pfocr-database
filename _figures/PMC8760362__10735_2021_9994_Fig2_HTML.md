caption: Differentially expressed proteins induced by the Zika virus affect the Nuclear
  and Plasma Acute Phase Response Signaling Pathway. The cellular region where the
  differentially abundant proteins were identified for the acute phase response pathway.
  Proteins in red mean upregulation of the expression. A total of 14 proteins are
  deregulated in this pathway. These are fibronectin 1 (FN1), fibrinogen alpha chain
  (FGA), fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG), fibrinogen beta chain (FGB), coagulation factor
  II (F2), serum amyloid P component (APCS), angiotensinogen (AGT), serpin family
  A member 1 (SERPINA1), complement C9 (C9), inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain
  4 (ITIH4), plasminogen (PLG), serpin family A member 3 (SERPINA3), ceruloplasmin
  (CP) and complement component 4 binding protein alpha (C4BP). Prediction legend,
  the intensity of the color red means higher upregulation of the protein. Proteins
  in the color orange in the diagrams were not detected by our proteomics experiments.
  The color orange means predicted activation of the protein or interaction leading
  to activation. The color yellow in the lines of the pathway means inconsistency
  due to downstream deregulated proteins. The protein gene name is used in the diagrams,
  to identify proteins look at Supplementary Table 1 gene name column. Data were analyzed
  through the use of IPA (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis).
