caption: Integration of various signaling pathways with ABA signaling. ABA signaling
  plays a central role in regulating different developmental processes, including
  stress responses, as is evident from its interactions with calcium (Ca2+), jasmonic
  acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), brassinosteroid (BR), ethylene (ET), and MAP kinase
  (MAPK) signaling pathway members.
