caption: Cellular carbohydrate and glutamine metabolism showing the pathways in which
  wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 are functional. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, 2 and 3 (IDH1/2/3)
  catalyse the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (αKG) in the cytoplasm
  and mitochondria, respectively, where IDH1 and IDH2 are NADPH producing and IDH3
  is NADH producing. This reaction occurs in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle(-like)
  metabolism and is fed by glucose influx and/or glutamine influx. The conversion
  of glutamine into αKG occurs in the glutaminolysis pathway and the last step is
  catalysed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), which is inhibited by chloroquine and
  metformin. The TCA cycle produces NADH, which is used in the electron transport
  chain (ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Complex I of the ETC
  is inhibited by metformin. Wild-type IDH1/2 (IDH1/2WT) differs from mutant IDH1/2
  (IDH1/2MUT) because the latter enzyme converts αKG into a novel oncometabolite,
  D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). CoA, coenzyme A; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate.
