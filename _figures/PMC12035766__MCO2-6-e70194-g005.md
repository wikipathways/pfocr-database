caption: Mechanisms of molecular hydrogen inhibiting CRC growth. CD8+ T cells assist
  the host in resisting viral infections and tumor cell invasion. However, prolonged
  exposure to persistent antigens or chronic inflammation leads to a loss of function
  in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and an identity crisis in memory T cells (TM),
  resulting in terminal exhausted T state. Hydrogen directly counteracts mitochondrial
  dysfunction caused by PGC‐1α inactivation, which provides ATP to terminal exhausted
  T after mitochondrial function is restored, and increases the amount of terminal
  exhausted T to improve the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tumourigenesis and development, with overactivation
  of PI3K promoting rapid growth and reproduction of cancer cells. mTORC1 regulates
  the balance between cellular anabolic and catabolic metabolism, which is associated
  with cell growth. Hydrogen can directly inhibit the expression of PI3K and PAKT,
  thereby suppressing downstream signaling molecule mTORC1 expression to inhibit colorectal
  cancer cell growth. Meanwhile, hydrogen reduces cancer stem cell (CSCs) activity
  in CRC by targeting inhibition of the p‐AKT/SCD1 pathway
