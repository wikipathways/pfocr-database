caption: (A). Proposed model for mXinα localization at the adherens junction of the
  intercalated disc. The extracellular domains of N-cadherin molecules projecting
  from the plasma membrane of each cardiomyocyte form a homotypic interaction. The
  cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin recruits β-catenin and α-catenin, and subsequently
  allows the assembly of actin thin filaments at the adherens junction. Full-length
  mXinα may be present at an auto-inhibited state due to the C-terminal proline-rich
  region, which may prevent the Xin repeats from binding to actin filaments. Once
  β-catenin binds to the β-catenin-binding domain on mXinα, a conformational change
  leads to an open state, which has a higher binding affinity of the Xin repeats to
  actin filaments. (B). β-catenin plays a central role in regulating Wnt signaling
  and the N-cadherin-mediated complex (adapted from Nelson and Nusse ). In the absence
  of a Wnt signal, cytoplasmic β-catenin is complexed with Axin, APC (adenomatosis
  polyposis coli), and GSK3β, phosphorylated, recognized by β-TrCP (an E3 ubiquitin
  ligase) and then targeted for degradation. In the presence of a Wnt signal, which
  binds to Frizzled or Arrow/LPR5/6 receptors, Dsh (Dishevelled) becomes activated
  and uncouples β-catenin from degradation. Accumulated, cytoplasmic β-catenin is
  then available to complex with the Tcf transcription factor in the nucleus and thus
  change target gene expression. β-catenin appears to play a central role in regulating
  N-cadherin-mediated adhesion and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The mXinα
  protein interacts directly with β-catenin and actin filaments and subsequently,
  may stabilize the N-cadherin/β-catenin complex. Thus, mXinα not only is a component
  of the adherens junction but also is a potentially important factor that may affect
  the level of β-catenin available to control gene expression in cardiomyocytes.
