caption: The MBP-FGF2 protein was immobilized on polystyrene plates. This biologically
  modified substrate could trigger an intracellular signaling pathway through binding
  with the membrane receptor, FGFR1. It also contributed to forming cellular spheroids
  by adhering to HSPG to control cell-matrix adhesion strength.
