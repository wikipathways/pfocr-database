caption: TAGE theory in LSRD. Habitual intake of sugar/HFCS and dietary AGEs causes
  excessive production of intracellular GA by activating the Glu/Fru metabolic pathway.
  GA binds to intracellular proteins to generate and accumulate TAGE, a type of GA-AGEs,
  which causes cell damage and cell death due to a decrease in proteostasis. As a
  result, TAGE leak out of cells and contribute to the onset/progression of LSRD,
  coupled with the action of the RAGE. Furthermore, since fluctuations in the blood
  TAGE levels are strongly correlated with the onset/progression of LSRD, including
  pre-disease states, it is expected that the onset of diseases can be predicted.
  This insight may support the prevention of LSRD and the extension of a healthy lifespan.
