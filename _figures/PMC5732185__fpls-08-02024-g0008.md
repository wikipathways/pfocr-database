caption: A model of miR160- and miR165/166-regulated pathways contributing to SE induction.
  ARF10/ARF16 and PHB/PHV that are repressed by miR160 and miR165/166, respectively,
  are postulated to positively regulate LEC2, thus controlling SE induction via the
  up-regulation of YUC genes (YUC1,4, and 10) and the activation of the auxin biosynthesis
  pathway. As a consequence of IAA accumulation, the auxin-responsive genes that are
  involved in SE induction are triggered. The targets of miR160 and miR165/166 appear
  to interact via a negative feedback loop as PHB/PHV seems to positively control
  their repressors, ARF10/ARF16. Besides controlling the auxin response, ARF10/ARF16
  might also contribute to SE induction by impacting the signaling pathways of other
  hormones including ABA and/or cytokines. The role of ARF17 in SE induction appears
  to be unrelated to the LEC2-mediated pathway. Further analyses are required to validate
  the assumed intra- and inter-specific regulatory interactions, which are indicated
  with dashed lines and to identify any other genetic components that are involved
  and are marked with a question mark.
