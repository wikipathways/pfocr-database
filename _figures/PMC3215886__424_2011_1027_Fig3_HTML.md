caption: The “stimulatory” pathway of WNK4. a Activation of WNK4 by angiotensin II
  potentially occurring via elevations in intracellular Ca2+. In this state, WNK4
  stimulates the SPAK/OSR1 pathway. Cl−-depletion and K+-depletion activates WNK1,
  thereby activating the SPAK and OSR1 kinases. In both cases, activation of the STE20
  kinases leads to increased phosphorylation level of NCC. The augmented phosphorylation
  level of NCC increases cotransport activity. b Potential mechanism whereby gain-of-function
  mutations in WNK4 causes PHAII. Increased activity of WNK4 due to PHAII mutations
  increases its stimulatory effect on the SPAK/OSR1 pathway. This enhances phosphorylation
  of NCC and thereby increases NaCl transport, leading to PHAII. c An increase in
  the expression of WNK1 stimulates the activation of the SPAK/OSR1 kinases, which
  subsequently increases the phosphorylation level of NCC
