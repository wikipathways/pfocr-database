caption: Canonical Notch signaling pathway. The unactivated Notch receptor releases
  a soluble intracellular domain (NICD) after three hydrolysis events. Subsequently,
  the NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA-binding
  protein cellulose synthase-like, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)-corepressor
  (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone
  acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD–CSL complex, leading to the
  transcriptional activation of Notch target genes
