caption: The essential components of the Cn-mediated retrograde signaling pathway.
  In response to this stress signal, NFκB (cRel-p50) and the other signature transcription
  factors (as indicated) alongwith hnRNPA2 and Akt kinase are activated and translocated
  to the nucleus. Nuclear Akt phosphorylates hnRNPA2 which associates with the signature
  transcription factors by protein-protein interaction and stabilizes the enhanceosome
  complex. The transcriptional coactivator function of hnRNPA2 is essential for activation
  of the stress responsive nuclear genes Cathepsin L, RyR1, Glut4 and Akt1.
