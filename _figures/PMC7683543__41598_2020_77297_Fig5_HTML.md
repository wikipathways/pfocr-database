caption: 'Canonical pathway enrichment analysis identifies immune response classical
  complement pathway as the ones most enriched in PVEC co-cultured with NPC. (a) Canonical
  pathway enrichment using the Metacore from Clarivate Analytics identified the top
  10 most enriched pathways in PVEC vs. PVEC + NPC. (b) Depiction of the top most
  modified pathway, “Immune response: Classical complement pathway”. The legend included
  in the figure decodes the colored shapes and arrows used in the picture. Colored
  bars close to each protein name indicates whether the DEG was upregulated (red)
  or down-regulated (blue) upon co-culture of PVEC with NPC.'
