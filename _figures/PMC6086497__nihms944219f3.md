caption: 'Significantly altered metabolites in the nitrogen metabolic pathway in sedentary
  and exercise trained hearts ± ischemia reperfusion injury. Peak values of a hisitine,
  b glutamine, c glutamic acid, and d glycine from rat hearts after sedentary, exercise
  trained, sedentary ischemia reperfusion injury, and exercise trained reperfusion
  injury. An ANOVA was run to determine significance, followed by a post-hoc Fisher’s
  least significant difference (LSD) multiple comparison between groups. N = 10 biological
  replicates/group. *p < 0.05 versus to I/R, **p < 0.05 versus exercise, #p < 0.05
  versus exercise I/R. Data is presented as the mean ± SEM'
