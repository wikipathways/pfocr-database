caption: The effects of anesthetics targeting GABAARs on different neuronal populations.
  Anesthetic agents activate microglia, triggering the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and M1 markers, which in turn exacerbate neuroinflammation. These drugs
  induce massive apoptosis in oligodendrocytes, leading to neuronal demyelination.
  Notably, iron and folate have been shown to mitigate this demyelination process.
  Furthermore, anesthetics interfere with astrocyte function via the ERK pathway,
  disrupting BDNF metabolism and ultimately leading to neuronal apoptosis. This cascade
  of events underscores the harmful effects of anesthetics on neurodevelopment, particularly
  in the context of inflammation-induced apoptosis in both neurons and glial cells
