caption: A model for the role of LUH in regulating mucilage modification in seed coat
  epidermal cells. Epidermal seed coat differentiation is controlled by a multimeric
  complex that includes MYB5, bHLH proteins (TT8/EGL3), and a WD40 repeat protein,
  TTG1 (). This complex is thought to positively regulate GL2. GL2 in turn activates
  MUM4, an NDP-l-Rha synthase required for the synthesis of RG-I (). Although MYB61
  also regulates seed coat differentiation and mucilage synthesis, it is thought to
  function via a separate pathway (). MUM2 encodes a secreted glycosidase that removes
  Gal residues from the RG-I side chains in the apoplast (; ). We propose that LUH
  may promote MUM2 expression indirectly through the repression of a negative regulator
  (repressor). LUH is likely to perform this function by forming a regulatory complex
  with either SEU or SLK proteins and an as yet unidentified transcription factor
  (TF). According to this model, reduced LUH activity would lead to increased expression
  of the MUM2 repressor, and as a consequence, MUM2 expression would be reduced. While
  not unambiguously demonstrated, it is likely that LUG is also capable of regulating
  MUM2 activity.
