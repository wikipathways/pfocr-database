caption: Model of the microbial impact on strobilation in Aurelia auritaMicrobial-produced
  beta carotene, synthesized via the 2-C-methyl-D-erythrol 4-phosphate (MEP) and carotenoid
  pathways, is hypothesized to present a pre-modulator of strobilation in A. aurita.
  In bacteria, pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate condense to form 1-deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate (DXP), which undergoes enzymatic reactions to yield isopentenyl pyrophosphate
  (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP),
  a precursor in isoprenoid biosynthesis, is produced in the carotenoid pathway through
  the condensation of IPP and DMAPP, subsequently forming beta carotene. Upon cellular
  uptake, beta carotene undergoes enzymatic cleavages in the polyp host. beta carotene
  dioxygenase1 (BCO1), antagonized by BHT, catalyzes all-trans retinal production.
  All-trans retinal is further yielded through reversible isomerization (e.g., retinol
  dehydrogenase 2). Subsequent oxidation through retinal dehydrogenase (RALDH), inhibited
  by DEAB, forms 9-cis retinoic acid. This acid serves as a ligand for nuclear receptors,
  including RxR (inhibited by UVI3003). Upon binding of 9-cis retinoic acid RxR forms
  a heterodimer with another nuclear receptor, likely activated by 5-methoxy-2-methyl
  indole. This heterodimer modulates the gene expression of strobilation genes, proposing
  a microbial-driven pathway where beta carotene, derived from bacteria, plays a crucial
  role in retinoic acid synthesis, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microbial
  and eukaryotic factors in the reproductive processes of A. aurita
