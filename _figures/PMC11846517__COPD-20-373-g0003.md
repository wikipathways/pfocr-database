caption: A schematic representation showing the changes in metabolic pathways of amino
  acid metabolites amid ARDS. During ARDS, there exist aberrations in the levels of
  certain amino acids like glutamine and arginine. The metabolism of these amino acids
  is regulated by other amino acids or signaling molecules, acting to either stimulate
  or curtail the mitochondrial oxygen free radicals production. However, these free
  radicals possess the potential to damage DNA and cellular membranes. For further
  information, refer to the main body of the text
