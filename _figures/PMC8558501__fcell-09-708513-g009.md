caption: Mechanism diagram. MSCs with CAF-like phenotype stimulate SDF-1/CXCR4 axis
  to enhance the growth and invasion of B-ALL cells through cell-to-cell communication.
  AMD3100 reduces the secretion of MMP-9 in MSCs with CAF-like phenotype and the phosphorylation
  of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway on ALL cells by blocking the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, and
  weakens the expression of integrin receptor α5β1 on leukemia cells to reduce the
  interaction between the integrin α5β1 and the increased secretion of fibronectin
  in MSCs with CAF-like phenotype, thereby reducing the interaction between MSCs with
  CAF-like phenotype and ALL cells. Regulation of ITGB1 in leukemia cells could effectively
  interfere with the promoting effect of MSCs with CAF-like phenotype on the adhesion,
  migration and invasion of leukemia cells.
