caption: Interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase plays a central role in the signal
  transduction of the T cell receptor. By binding of the MHC to the TCR, the kinase
  Lck (lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase) becomes activated with the help
  of Zn2+. Lck binds to protein Zap-70 (zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70) which
  leads to the phosphorylation of LAT (linker for activation of T cells) and SLP-76
  (SRC-homology-2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa). Upon binding of
  ITK to PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate) via its PH domain, ITK is
  recruited to the LAT/SLP-76-signalling complex. ITK interacts with SLP-76 and LAT
  at its SH2 and SH3 domains and gets phosphorylated on the tyrosine residue Y511
  and Y180. The LAT/SLP-76 complex can also function as an accumulation platform for
  complex proteins like VAV1 (vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1) and Nck (non-catalytic
  region of tyrosine kinase). ITK becomes activated which results in the phosphorylation
  of PLCγ1 (phospholipase Cγ1) and the generation of IP3 (inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate)
  and DAG (diacylglycerol), which activates the PKC (protein kinase C). Finally, a
  Ca2+ influx within the cell can be observed. Through this signalling pathway, ITK
  can control the nuclear translocation of transcription factors AP-1 (activator protein
  1) via Erk (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), NFAT (nuclear factor of activated
  T cells), IRF4 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 4) and NF-κb (nuclear factor ‘kappa-light-chain-enhancer’
  of activated B-cells) as well as the subsequent expression of various genes, e.g.,
  IL-2, IL-9 and IL-17A
