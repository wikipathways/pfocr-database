caption: Aside from their traditional roles in suppressing Bcl-Xl and Mcl-1, Bad and
  Noxa (when phosphorylated) modulate metabolism by enhancing glucose consumption
  through glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, respectively. Additionally,
  Bcl-XL and an N-terminally cleaved form of Mcl-1 localize to the matrix to promote
  respiration. It is still unclear how these novel metabolic functions of Bcl-2 family
  proteins may intertwine with their long-studied roles in modulating MOMP.
