caption: The common risk factors, signaling pathways, and predisposition at the cellular
  level, for both cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Cancer is characterized by a decrease
  of apoptosis (connected to upregulated aerobic glycolysis, increased antioxidant
  activity, and increased proliferation). Elevation of apoptotic signals (linked with
  toxic protein forms, oxidative stress, inflammation or elevated oxidative phosphorylation)
  potentiates neurodegenerative processes and the risk of AD development. Changes
  which lead to suppression of Pin1 and Wnt signaling, with simultaneous p53 upregulation,
  increase susceptibility to neuronal death. On the other hand, upregulation of Pin1
  and Wnt pathway increases the risk of tumor development
