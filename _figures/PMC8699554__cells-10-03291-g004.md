caption: 'Macrophage-mediated pathway showing the mechanistic similarity between SARS-CoV-2
  infection and RA. Schematic diagram showing the pro-inflammatory function of distinct
  macrophage subsets in the normal (left side) and SARS-CoV-2 infected (right side)
  alveolar tissue (A) and synovial tissue (B) of normal (left side) and RA patients
  (right side). The identity of distinct participating macrophage subsets is shown
  at the bottom. Arrows indicate the downstream cellular events; double-headed arrows
  represent the similarity in transcriptomic homology and regulatory activities. “+”
  indicates positive expression, and “-“ indicates negative expression. FABP4: fatty
  acid-binding protein 4; FCN1: ficolin-1; FOLR2: folate receptor beta; ICAM1: intercellular
  adhesion molecule 1; IFN: interferon; IL: interleukin; LYVE1: lymphatic vessel endothelial
