caption: Effects of high salt or sodium ions on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.
  HSD induced M1-type macrophages and inhibited M2-type macrophages by increasing
  the release of NO, TNF-α, and IL-1β, hindering mitochondrial metabolism in M2-type
  macrophages and the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. HSD decreased the sensitivity of
  NK cells to IL-15 and the expression of self-cd122, hindering the proliferation,
  activation, and function of NK cells. In another study, HSD was able to increase
  Bifidobacteria colonization into tumors and increase their anti-tumor capacity.
  HSD promotes DC maturation and enhances their secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  via P38/MAPK-STAT1, epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). HSD enhances the anti-tumor
  capacity of CD8+ cells, and the CD4+ subset, Th17 is increased in response to HSD.
  Th17 has different roles depending on the disease background. HSD facilitated the
  conversion of M-MDSC to pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor phenotypes, and alleviated
  the inhibitory effect of PMN-MDSCs on T cell function
