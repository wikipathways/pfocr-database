caption: A proposed model illustrating the mechanism that underlies NTZ in the amelioration
  of AD pathology. NTZ stimulated autophagy and promoted Aβ clearance by inhibiting
  both PI3K/AKT/mTOR/ULK1 and NQO1/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathways. NTZ was capable of
  repressing tau hyperphosphorylation involving inhibition of PI3K/AKT/GSK3β pathway
  and attenuating LPS-induced inflammation by inhibiting PI3K/AKT/IκB/NFκB signaling
