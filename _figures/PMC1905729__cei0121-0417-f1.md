caption: Binding of IL-12 to the IL-12Rβ1 and β2 chains induces phosphorylation of
  the kinases Tyk2 and Jak2, which associate with the cytoplasmic tails of the β1
  and β2 chains, respectively. Subsequently the signal transducing protein STAT4 binds
  to the cytoplasmic tail of the β2 receptor and in turn becomes phosphorylated. It
  then dissociates from the receptor, dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, where
  it acts as a transcriptional activator by binding to specific DNA response elements
  (RE) in the promoter regions of IL-12 inducible genes [,].
