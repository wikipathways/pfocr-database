caption: 'Intracellular signaling activated through FGFRs. Formation of the FGF-Syndecan/heparin-FGFR
  complex leads to receptor autophosphorylation and activation of intracellular signaling
  cascades of the Ras/MAPK pathway, the PI3K/Akt pathway (left), and the PLCγ/Ca2+
  /PKC pathway (right) (,,,). Syndecans facilitate the binding of FGFs to FGFRs, forming
  a ternary structure. EphA receptors induce tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFRs and
  FRS2 by forming a complex with the FGFR. The Ras/MAPK signaling cascade is activated
  by the binding of Grb2 to phosphorylated FRS2. The subsequent formation of the Grb2/SOS
  complex results in the activation of Ras. There are three routes by which FGFRs
  are able to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway: Gab1 can bind to FRS2 indirectly via
  Grb2, resulting in the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
  (,); PI3K can bind directly to a phosphorylated tyrosine residue of the FGFR ();
  and lastly, activated Ras can induce membrane localization and activation of the
  PI3K catalytic subunit (). The negative feedback signals that are mediated by or
  imposed on FRS2 are marked by the dotted line (). The PLCγ/Ca2+pathway is activated
  when autophosphorylation on a tyrosine residue in the carboxy terminal tail of the
  FGFR creates a specific binding site for the SH2 domain of PLCγ (). The last activated
  components of the above-mentioned signal transduction cascades translocate into
  the nucleus and phosphorylate specific transcription factors of the Ets family,
  which in turn activate expression of FGF target genes. DAG, Diacylglycerol; IP3,
  inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate; SOS, son of sevenless.'
