caption: Biosynthetic pathway for aflatoxins (according to Udwary [37], and Yabe [38])
  and downstream transformation reactions. Arrows and dashed arrows denote single
  and multiple enzyme reaction steps, respectively. Enzymes of reaction steps are
  indicated. Biosynthetic, enzymatic, and non-enzymatic degradation reactions are
  drawn with green, pink, and gray background colors, respectively. NE denotes non-enzymatic
  reactions (these steps are emphasized with double-line arrows). VA, versicolorin
  A; OMeSTC, O-methylsterigmatocystin; OH-OMeSTC, 11-hydroxy-O-methylsterigmatocystin;
