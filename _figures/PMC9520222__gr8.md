caption: Schematic diagram of the function and mechanism of IDD model with or without
  LDH treatment. Without LDH treatment, the intervertebral disc was characterized
  of reduced disc height, destroyed structure, and loss of physiological function.
  While, the optimized LDH-pretreated cell transplantation enhanced the chondrogenic
  differentiation and in situ intervertebral disc regeneration through focal adhesion
  signaling pathways.
