caption: To research the underlying mechanisms for the variable response to ERT, enrichment
  analysis and PPI analysis results revealed the interaction of many gene groups,
  and a gene network was obtained by modeling the functional relationships between
  these genes. PPI networks were mapped to find the correlations between PD prognostic
  biomarkers and prognostic DNA biomarkers in PD. Many genes are associated with KEGG
  pathways. In the focal adhesion pathway, the three nodes with the most interactions
  on PPI analysis were the VCL and TLN1 genes. The genes talin (TLN1) and vinculin
  (VCL) encode various structural proteins and ensure interactions with actin filaments
  on integrins. VCL is expressed in all sites binding actin cell skeletons to sarcoma
  and is a membrane-linked protein that indirectly binds to integrins via talin. A
  study by Zemljic-Harpf et al found talin-1 expression in cardiomyocytes in patients
  with heart failure was increased compared to control cells. The reduction in cardiomyocytes'
  TLN1 expression was shown to assist cardiac remodeling. Vasile et al showed that
  obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was associated with reduced VCL expression
  in intercalation disks. In our study, the increase in expression of these two genes
  leads to the consideration that they play a role in the resistance and lead to cardiac
  disruption. In previous studies, these two genes were not associated with PD. The
  increased VCL and TLN1 expression in the group without response to medication may
  be associated with worsened prognosis (). Additionally, when networks are examined
  after protein-protein interaction analysis, the differentially expressed M6PR gene
  was identified to have a central role among genes with increased expression in the
  lysosome pathway (). As a result, they may act as a marker for PD diagnosis. The
  FYN gene related to focal adhesion was shown to play a central role among genes
  with reduced expression in the unresponsive group in week 52. Two genes, YES1 and
  FYN, were found to have the strongest interaction (). Some components of the focal
  adhesion molecules participate in structural interactions between membrane receptors
  and the actin cell skeleton. This leads to the consideration that it may be an important
  pathway requiring research for disruption of structures related to muscle structure
  and response to medication. Another emerging pathway in string analysis of reducing
  genes is the cell cycle. Among nine genes (CDC20, CDC23, CDC26, CREBBP, MAD2L1,
  RBL1, SMAD3, SMC3, and TFDP1) in the cell cycle pathway with differential expression,
  CDC20, CDC23 and CDC26 were found to have the highest node numbers. In the IOPD
  iPS-based skeletal muscle model created by Yoshida et al previously, the cell cycle
  or cell proliferation pathways emerged among 175 genes and increased expression
  of MYBL2, NDC80, CCNB2, GINS2, MAD2L1, CCNA2, TPX2, BUB1B, CCNB1, and UHRF1 was
  shown in the group receiving ERT. The reduction in expression of cell cycle genes
  in the group without a response to ERT indicates that a detailed study of this pathway
  will be beneficial.
