caption: Regulation network of the lectin genes related to immune activities. The
  functions of the first neighbors were predicted by KEGG pathway analysis. Genes
  that show positive correlation with the 35% concentrate feeding are in red, and
  the genes that show negative correlation with the 35% concentrate diet are in blue.
  Signaling pathways are in yellow, and regulatory functions are in violet. The genes
  regulating the same signaling pathways are given the same line shapes and the genes
  and signaling pathways regulating the same functions are given the same color.
