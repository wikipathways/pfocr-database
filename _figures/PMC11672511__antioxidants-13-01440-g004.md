caption: 'NLRP3 inflammasome induction by mtROS. The mtROS generated in complexes
  I and III of the electron transport chain confer the priming signal necessary for
  the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The cytosolic spread of mtROS activates redox-sensitive
  transcription factors, such as NF-κB, which stimulate the expression of inflammasome-related
  genes. Additionally, excessive production of mtROS causes oxidative modifications
  of mitochondrial proteins, mtDNA, and membrane lipids such as cardiolipin, which
  favor inflammasome assembly. ox-mtDNA release requires a TLR-dependent priming signal
  that triggers mtDNA replication through IRF1-mediated induction of CMPK2, an enzyme
  responsible for dNTPs supply. Dysfunctional mitochondria also engage the NRF2-ARE
  signaling pathway and mitophagy, which inhibit inflammasome assembly. Abbreviations:
  ARE, antioxidant response element; CMPK2, cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase
  2; IRF1, interferon regulatory factor 1; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; NRF2, nuclear
  factor-erythroid 2 (NFE2) p45-related factor 2; dNTPs, deoxynucleotide triphosphates;
  TLR, toll-like receptor'
