caption: Transcriptional regulation of the CYP11B1 gene by the CREB family. The CREB
  family, including CREB and CREM, is involved in the regulation of gene expression
  of CYP11B1, a cortisol synthase. CREB has been identified as a component of the
  transcription factor complex with p300 and CBP, but the other components are still
  unknown.
