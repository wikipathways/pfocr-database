caption: Palmitoylation is essential for DLK's ability to convey retrograde injury
  signals following distal axonal injury. At the cellular level, palmitoylation targets
  DLK to trafficking vesicles where DLK forms complexes with its direct substrate
  MKK4. These complexes also contain the scaffold protein JIP3, which binds dynein/dynactin
  retrograde motor proteins, and may also involve the downstream palmitoyl-kinase
  JNK3, which is heavily implicated in axonal retrograde signaling. In addition to
  this role in DLK localization, palmitoylation is necessary for DLK's ability to
  activate the JNK pathway. This additional ‘security feature’ ensures that depalmitoylated
  DLK does not inappropriately phosphorylate cytosolic MKKs.
