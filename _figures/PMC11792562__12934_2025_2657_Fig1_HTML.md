caption: Main biological pathways for cytidine synthesis in E. coli. Precursor synthesis
  is divided into the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle, which
  provide the necessary precursors for cytidine synthesis. UMP synthesis primarily
  involves the production of uridylic acid (UMP). The cytidine synthesis pathway utilizes
  UMP as a precursor to synthesize cytidine. The boxed section in the figure highlights
  the gene editing aspect of this study, with the red X indicating the site of knockout
  [17]
