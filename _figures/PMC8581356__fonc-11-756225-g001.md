caption: 'The mechanisms of TAM (in particular AXL) regulation of immune evasion.
  (A) Modulation of the tumor-immune microenvironment: promotes secretion of various
  immunosuppressive chemokine. After AXL inhibition, cytokines are decreased (CXCL9,
  CXCL10, CXCL11), increased (CCL-2, CCL-3, CCL-4, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5), or
  there could be no difference (CXCL12). These changes lead to regulation in the recruitment
  of specific immune cells (monocytes, macrophages, CD8+ T cells, NK cells). (B) Promoting
  T cell exclusion. AXL expression is significantly correlated with the expression
  of genes encoding CXC chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6) and PD-L1 which prevent T cell
  activation. Tumors treated with the combination of pharmacological inhibition of
  AXL and anti-PD-1 presented an increased number of CD8 T cells. (C) Enhancing the
  immune suppressive activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tumor-specific Tregs
  can suppress antitumor immune responses against a broad range of tumor antigens,
  even after being activated by just one tumor-associated antigen. GAS6 induces CD4+
  CD25+ Tregs to express CTLA-4 and Foxp3 especially with AXL. These activated Tregs
  increase the consumption of IL-2 or suppression of IL-2 production to block the
  activity of T lymphocytes. (D) TAM signaling is involved in the overall stage of
  NK cell differentiation. Especially, the GAS6/AXL pathway promotes FLT3 ligand-induced
  human NK cell development and cooperative interaction between the GAS6/AXL pathway
  and IL-15 signaling promotes NK cell differentiation. In the absence of AXL, IL-15
  failed to activate several downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K, AKT, and
  ERK1/2. (E) Suppress innate immune response. TAM signaling and type I IFN receptors
  inhibit the inflammatory response in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) by expressing
  the genes encoding the cytokine suppressors SOCS1 and SOCS3. In case of DCs, they
  serve as “presentation platforms” for GAS6 which triggers STAT1-dependent cascade
  with type I IFN. TAM also activates phagocytosis of DCs and macrophages to clear
  apoptotic cell corpses which could induce immune responses. (F) Inhibit apoptosis.
  The GAS6/AXL pathway is important in limiting apoptosis which involves activating
  survival signaling mediated by AKT, CREB, BCL-XL, and Survivin. It also suppresses
  phosphorylation of BAD that initiates apoptosis and activate ERK1/2 signaling.'
