caption: Schematic representation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and inhibition
  effects of baricitinib. Various cytokines and growth factors can participate in
  signal transmission through the JAK pathway, including different interleukins (ILs),
  interferons (INFs α, β, and γ), granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor
  (GM-CSF), growth hormone (GH), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and leptin hormone.
  Interaction between the receptors and ligands leads to phosphorylation of the tyrosine
  residues of many target proteins by JAK enzymes and affects signal translocation
  from the extracellular to the intracellular. Then, phosphorylated STATs form dimers
  (STAT-STAT) can translocate into the nucleus, bind to specific DNA sequences, and
  transmit extracellular cytokine signals into transcriptional responses
