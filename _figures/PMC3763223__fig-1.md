caption: Reactions of the proline metabolic pathway. Proline (Pro) is synthesized
  from glutamate (Glu) starting with the enzymes glutamate kinase (GK) and γ-glutamyl
  phosphate reductase (GPR), which in plants and animals are fused together in the
  bifunctional enzyme P5C synthetase (P5CS). The intermediate, γ-glutamate-semialdehyde
  (GSA), spontaneously cyclizes to Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), which is then
  reduced to proline by P5C reductase (P5CR). Alternatively, GSA/P5C can be generated
  from ornithine and ornithine-δ-aminotransferase (OAT). Proline is oxidized back
  to glutamate by proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH) in the
  mitochondrion. PRODH couples proline oxidation to the reduction of ubiquinone (CoQ)
  in the electron transport chain (ETC). In Gram-negative bacteria, PRODH and P5CDH
  domains are fused together in the PutA protein.
