caption: Conceptual diagram summarizing selected brain systems wherein the processing
  of stressor-related information may relate to the expression of stressor-evoked
  blood pressure reactivity. Although the model is anatomically incomplete, key areas
  implicated by animal and human evidence are included. PVN, paraventricular nucleus;
  LHA, lateral hypothalamic area; NTS, nucleus tractus solitarius; DVN, dorsal vagal
  nucleus; NA, nucleus ambiguous; CVLM, caudal ventrolateral medulla; RVL, rostral
  ventrolateral medullary; IML, intermediolateral cell column; HR, heart rate; BRS,
  baroreflex sensitivity; CO, cardiac output; TPR, total peripheral resistance. Blocked
  endpoints denote inhibitory influences; arrowed endpoints denote excitatory influences.
  Broken gray lines correspond to ascending (afferent) visceral input, particularly
  from peripheral baroreceptors. This model was derived explicitly from the work of
  , , ,  and .
