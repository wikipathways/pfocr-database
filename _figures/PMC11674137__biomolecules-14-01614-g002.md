caption: Landscape of the mitophagy mechanisms. Mitochondrial autophagy involves multiple
  interconnected mechanisms that can be broadly categorized into ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent
  and ubiquitin-independent pathways. The PINK1/Parkin pathway is the most well-studied
  ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. In addition, a group of mitochondrial autophagy receptors,
  such as Nix, Bnip3, and FUND1, can directly bind to LC3 without requiring extensive
  ubiquitination, which characterizes the ubiquitin-independent pathway. These distinct
  yet complementary pathways play crucial roles in regulating mitochondrial quality
  control and cellular homeostasis
