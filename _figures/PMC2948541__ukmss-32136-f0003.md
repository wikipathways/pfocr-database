caption: A. Opposing effects of synaptic vs. extrasynaptic NMDAR signalling on CREB-dependent
  gene expression. The activation of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-dependent
  gene expression by synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity is a
  multi-step process. CREB must be phosphorylated at serine-133 in order to recruit
  its coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) , ; this phosphorylation is mediated
  by the fast-acting nuclear CaM kinase pathway (A) and the slower acting, longer
  lasting Ras-ERK1/2 pathway (B) , , , both of which are promoted by activation of
  synaptic NMDARs CBP is subject to Ca2+-mediated transactivation by nuclear Ca2+
  dependent CaM kinase IV , , which phosphorylates CBP at serine-301 (C) . In addition,
  nuclear translocation of transducer of regulated CREB activity (TORC) is a key step
  in CREB activation. Synaptic NMDAR-induced Ca2+ signals promote TORC import into
  the nucleus via calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation (D) , . TORC acts at least
  in part by assisting in the recruitment of CBP to CREB  (not shown). In contrast
  to these CREB-activating signals of synaptic NMDARs, extrasynaptic NMDARs suppress
  CREB activity ,  through inactivation of the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway (E)  and the nuclear
  translocation of Jacob, which promotes CREB dephosphorylation (F) .B. Opposing effects
  of synaptic vs. extrasynaptic NMDAR signalling on FOXO-dependent gene expression.
  Synaptic NMDAR activity suppresses FOXO activity by promoting the Akt-mediated phosphorylation
  and nuclear export of FOXOs (A) , of which FOXO1 and FOXO3 are the predominant neuronal
  subtypes. FOXO1 is also regulated transcriptionally by FOXOs  and thus signals that
  cause FOXO export also result in FOXO1 transcription being suppressed. By contrast,
  bath activation of NMDARs, which also triggers extrasynaptic NMDAR activity, stimulates
  FOXO nuclear import (B), an event that contributes, through promoting transcription
  of pro-death genes, to excitotoxic cell death.  Synaptic NMDAR activity can exert
  a long-lasting block on this import signal (C) , the mechanistic basis of which
  remains unclear.
