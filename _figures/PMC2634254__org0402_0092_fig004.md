caption: Upstream regulators and downstream targets of β-catenin during embryonic
  liver development. β-catenin expression in early foregut development inhibits Hex
  expression; later in hepatogenesis, β-catenin is thought to regulate proliferation
  in part through Hex. Srfp5 inhibits β-catenin activity, while FGFs stimulate the
  β-catenin pathway. In turn, β-catenin activates FGF-8 expression, suggesting a feed-forward
  mechanism. Downstream targets of β-catenin, such as cyclin D1 and c-myc, induce
  proliferation, while others, such as Hex, BMP4, C/EBPα and HNF-4, promote differentiation.
