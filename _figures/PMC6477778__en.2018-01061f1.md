caption: Proposed sources of NOD1 activation and corresponding physiologic, endocrine,
  and cell tissue communication events leading to insulin resistance in different
  tissues. Generic NOD1 activation by bacterial peptidoglycans (PAMPs) or metabolites
  (DAMPs) initiate a downstream inflammatory signal cascade in which the adaptor protein,
  RIPK2, interacts with NOD1 via its caspase recruitment domain (CARD) motif. Subsequent
  recruitment and activation of TAK1 enhances MAPK and NF-κB signaling. Crosstalk
  between the insulin receptor pathway and both NF-κB and MAPK signaling can occur
  through inhibitory inputs of IKKβ and JNK on IRS1,2 phosphorylation, reducing insulin
  signaling and, thus, contributing to insulin resistance. Circulating proinflammatory
  cytokines—NF-κB signaling promoted proinflammatory cytokine gene and protein expression,
  establishing a feed-forward cascade in which cytokines can bind to their respective
  receptors and propagate downstream inflammatory signaling on the same, neighbor,
  or distal cell. Enhanced inflammation in target cells attenuates insulin receptor
  signaling, thereby participating in the onset of whole-body insulin resistance.
  NOD1 signaling in cells of hematopoietic origin amplifies peripheral inflammation
  and insulin resistance—NOD1 activation in hematopoietic cells promotes changes in
  macrophage polarization, converting anti-inflammatory macrophages to a proinflammatory
  state. Elevated proinflammatory cytokine secretion and increased proinflammatory
  macrophage infiltration in adipose and peripheral tissues results in heightened
  inflammation in target tissues and corresponding reductions in insulin signaling.
  The NOD1-dependent influx in proinflammatory macrophages is accompanied by an increase
  in neutrophil infiltration, which together are thought to participate in inflammation-mediated
  insulin resistance. NOD1 signaling in adipose tissue stimulates lipolysis and reduces
  insulin-stimulated glucose uptake—increased inflammation and cytokine secretion
  in adipose tissue as a result of autonomous activation of NOD1 and infiltration
  of immune cells collectively dampen insulin receptor signaling. Loss of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT activity translates to reduced GLUT4 membrane translocation,
  thereby decreasing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. NOD1-induced inflammation
  also enhances adipose lipolysis via proposed NF-κB/PKA– and ERK-dependent pathways,
  increasing hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) activity. Elevated circulating FFAs travel
  to, and accumulate in, metabolically active tissues, where they can convert into
  lipid metabolites and stimulate PKC isoforms. Enhanced PKC signaling in the liver
  and muscle mediates changes in local insulin receptor signaling, contributing to
  the onset of hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance, respectively. However, NOD1
  activation might also occur directly in liver and skeletal muscle.
