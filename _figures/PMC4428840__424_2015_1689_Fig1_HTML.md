caption: Ion channels and electrical signalling in type 1 cells. Putative summary
  model of key ion channels/currents in rat type 1 cells. Background channels and
  currents setting the resting potential include TASK, predominantly TASK1/TASK3 heterodimers
  plus some contribution from TASK1 and TASK3 homodimers; Na-leak, an uncharacterised
  background Na+-leak conductance; and Na/K ATPase, an Na/K pump current presumed
  to be present in order to maintain intracellular Na+ homeostasis. Voltage-gated
  channels mediating electrical activity (action potentials) in the rat type 1 cell
  include Ca V, voltage-gated calcium channels including L-type and N-type channels;
  K V, voltage-gated, delayed rectifier type, potassium channels (other species may
  also have voltage gated Na+ channels). Calcium-activated channels include BK Ca,
  a large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (note this channel is also
  voltage sensitive) and Cat Ca, a calcium-activated cation channel permeable to Na+
  ions. Signalling pathway for both hypoxia and acidosis involves inhibition of TASK
  channels (all three forms) and maxi-K+ channels. Inhibition of TASK leads to membrane
  depolarisation, followed by activation of voltage-gated Ca+ channels generating
  Ca2+ influx and upstroke of action potentials; KV is assumed to mediate action potential
  repolarisation. The resulting rise in [Ca2+]i not only promotes neurosecretion but
  also activates a non-selective cation channel which reinforces the depolarising
  effect of TASK channel inhibition. Ca2+-dependent activation of maxi-K channels
  would be expected to repolarise the type 1 cell and limit Ca2+ influx were it not
  also inhibited by hypoxia/acidosis [, ]. Channels in red mediate inward (depolarising)
  current, those in blue mediate outward (repolarising/hyperpolarising) current
