caption: Proposed pathway for the hepatic synthesis of ‘NPC bile acids’. Hepatic formation
  of NPCBA1, NPCBA1 analogues (left pathway) and NPCBA2 (right pathway). Endolysosomal
  accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, associated with cellular oxidative stress
  (A,B), leads to the production of oxysterol molecules (7‐oxocholesterol and cholestane‐3β,5α,6β‐triol).
  The keto group of the 7‐oxocholesterol can be reduced by 7‐oxosteroid reductase
  (C) forming 7β‐hydroxycholesterol which, upon further enzymatic modifications, can
  lead to the series of NPCBA1 (D) or, alternatively to the formation of a trihydroxycholenoic
  acid (E). In a similar way, NPCBA2 series can be produced, via enzymatic reactions
  (F), from cholestane‐3β,5α,6β‐triol.
