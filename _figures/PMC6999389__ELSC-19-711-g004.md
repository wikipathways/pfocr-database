caption: (A) A schematic depiction of the central carbon metabolism of S. cerevisiae
  and the metabolic engineering approach used in this study. The two carbon dioxide
  fixation reactions convert either PEP or pyruvate into oxaloacetate, which is then
  reduced in three further steps to succinate and finally exported outside of the
  cell by a heterologous transporter (Mae). (B) Description of the pathway genes and
  the donor organisms as well as the regulatory elements (all from S. cerevisiae)
  used for the construction of the integrated gene cassettes
