caption: NF-κB-mediated regulation of inflammatory and immunosuppressive CD4+ T-cell
  lineages. Proposed mechanism of MS pathology implicated by pathway analysis of GWAS-NR
  candidate genes. This simplified schematic presents an abridged set of interactions
  in an exploded format for tractability, uses generic labels for several homologous
  candidates (for example, B7 represents both CD80 and CD86), and does not individually
  depict each candidate gene implicated in current literature as having relevance
  to this pathway. Activation of membrane-bound T-cell receptors (TCR), pattern recognition
  receptors such as dendritic-cell Toll-like receptors and C-type lectins, ,  and
  receptors of the TNF superfamily,  initiate signal transduction cascades leading
  to the activation of NF-κB transcriptional programs through canonical and non-canonical
  pathways, resulting in cytokine production that determines the balance between inflammatory
  Th1 and Th17 cells, and immunosuppressive regulatory T cells via JAK/STAT signaling
  to lineage-specific transcription factors. NF-κB activation also promotes the expression
  of cell adhesion molecules on vascular endothelia, which enable the infiltration
  of inflammatory T cells across the blood–brain barrier.,  CLEC, C-type lectin; FcR,
  Fc receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNFR, TNF-α receptor;
  Th1, T helper type 1 cell; Treg, T-regulatory cell.
