caption: Growth factor stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases leads to the recruitment
  of the Grb2-Sos complex resulting in dissociation of GDP from Ras. We propose that
  PI3KC2β competes for binding this transient nucleotide-free (nf) Ras trapping it
  in the nucleotide-free state and preventing GTP loading. In addition, binding of
  nucleotide-free Ras to PI3KC2β inhibits its lipid kinase activity. The PI3KC2β-Ras
  complex may then translocate to distal sites such as early endosomes (EE) where
  ITSN1 then binds to PI3KC2β leading to the release of nucleotide-free Ras and activation
  of the lipid kinase activity of PI3KC2β. In addition, once released from the ITSN1-PI3KC2β
  complex, Ras binds GTP resulting in Ras activation and recruitment of effectors,
  e.g., Raf, Class I PI3Ks, etc. Although the above model describes a potential role
  for nf-Ras in ITSN1 and PI3KC2β function, we propose that nf-Ras may be regulated
  by additional proteins besides these molecules. Our findings also raise the possibility
  that the nucleotide-free forms of other GTPases may play a similar role in cell
  signaling.
