caption: The m6A regulatory pathways have the similar axis of writer/eraser/m6A-reader/mRNA/cell
  functions in common. In general, writer or eraser proteins are responsible for adding
  or removing m6A modification, then reader proteins recognize the m6A-modified mRNAs,
  which are divided into different protein families to perform various functions in
  cells. The regulatory functions of m6A are usually mediated by this pathway in common.
