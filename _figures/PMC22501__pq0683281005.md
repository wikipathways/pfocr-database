caption: Proposed metabolic pathways for synthesis of all-trans, 9-cis, and 11-cis
  retinoids. The existence of a 9-cis RDH suggests that 9-cis retinol is generated
  from all-trans retinol by using an evolutionary conserved mechanism similar to that
  involved in the generation of 11-cis retinol in the visual system. The proposed
  metabolic route generating 9-cis RA from 9-cis retinol is similar to that generating
  all-trans RA from all-trans retinol.
