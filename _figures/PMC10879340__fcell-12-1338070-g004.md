caption: 'Summary of Zebrafish Studies on TGF-β Signaling and Pharyngeal Arch Patterning.
  (A) During the early stages of pharyngeal arch (PA) patterning (18–20 hpf), a ventral
  source of BMP activates Endothelin (Edn) signaling, which induces the expression
  of ventral-promoting transcription factors in the PAs (dlx5a/6a, hand2). BMP signaling
  also directly induced the expression of hand2 in the ventral PAs. Notch signaling
  (via jag1b) specifies the dorsal domain. There is also evidence that BMP signaling
  regulates the formation of the trabeculae in the maxillary domain (M) during this
  period, however how this is achieved in zebrafish in unclear. BMP is opposed by
  TGF-β signaling during this period, and the scaffolding protein Wdr68 permits BMP
  signaling by sequestering Smad2/3 and thereby inhibiting TGF-β signaling. In later
  stages of PA patterning (24 hpf onwards), the BMP (induced by Wnt signling) and
  Edn pathways act independently: BMP signaling activates the expression of ventral
  (hand2) and intermediate-ventral (msx1a) genes, whereas Edn induces the expression
  of intermediate identity specifiers (dlx3b/5a/6a, nkx3.2). Dorsal Notch signaling
  induces the expression of grem2, which inhibits BMP signaling and restricts hand2/msx1a
  to the ventral-most region of the arches. In turn, BMP signaling restricts the expression
  of grem2 to the dorsal region of each arch, creating distinct dorsal, intermediate,
  and ventral domains of gene expression. During this stage, BMP (together with Hedgehog
  signaling) also induces the expression of gata3 in the maxillary domain (B) The
  gene expression domains generated in (A) result in differential domains of prrx1
  and barx1 expression, with barx1 being expressed in the intermediate domain and
  prrx1 being expressed in the dorsal and ventral domains (left). This, in turn, results
  in heterochronic onsets of chondrogenesis, where barx1+ cells initiate chondrogenesis
  earlier than prrx1+ cells. This heterochrony, in part, dictates the shape/identity
  of the resulting skeletal elements. The spatial gene expression domains in the PAs
  also create differential regions of fox gene expression, which dictate whether a
  cell will undergo osteogenesis or chondrogenesis; sox9a+/fox-regions will initiate
  an osteogenic gene expression program, whereas sox9a+/fox + cells will initiate
  a chondrogenic program (right). All images are oriented with anterior facing left'
