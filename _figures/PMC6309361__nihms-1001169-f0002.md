caption: Effects of hemolysis on the monocyte/macrophage compartment. Heme affects
  phagocytic activity of macrophages and microbial clearance by directly activating
  the DOCT8/Cdc42 signaling pathway, and inhibiting cytoskeletal remodeling necessary
  for phagocytosis. In addition, heme induces monocyte differentiate into red pulp
  macrophages through BACH1 degradation and activation of SPIC signaling, thus restoring
  iron recirculation needed for replenishing red cells in hemolytic conditions. In
  addition, heme induces heme oxygenase 1 expression in nonclassical monocytes which
  in turn drive the expansion of Tregs, perhaps further contributing to impaired adaptive
  immune response in hemolytic conditions. Tregs, regulatory T cells. SPIC, spleen
  focus forming virus proviral integration-site.
