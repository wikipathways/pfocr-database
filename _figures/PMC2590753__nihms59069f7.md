caption: Photic input from the retina induces the release of glutamate and PACAP from
  RHT terminals. Transmitter binding to postsynaptic receptors on SCN neurons evokes
  a series of intracellular signal transduction events, including MAPK pathway activation.
  One downstream target of the MAPK cascade is CREB, which, when phosphorylated on
  Ser-133, drives clock gene transcription. Light-induced activation of the MAPK cascade
  also stimulates mTORC1, which in turn targets the translation regulators p70 S6K
  and 4E-BP1. Activated p70 S6K stimulates S6 phosphorylation, whereas 4E-BP1 phosphorylation
  has been shown to lead to its dissociation from eIF4E, thereby allowing cap-dependent
  mRNA translation to occur. U0126 is a specific MEK 1/2 inhibitor and rapamycin inhibits
  mTORC1.
