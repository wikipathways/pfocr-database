caption: 'Cytokines, T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement and co-stimulation, growth factors
  but also pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) induce the activation of
  class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks). PI3K generates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3) to act as a second messenger that induces the phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308.
  PI3K signaling induces mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) activation,
  which in turn phosphorylates its downstream targets serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated
  kinase 1 (SGK1), protein kinase C (PKC) and Akt on Ser473. Phosphatase and tensin
  homologue (PTEN) negatively regulates PI3K signaling, by dephosphorylating PIP3.
  Akt phosphorylates and thereby inhibits the heterodimer tuberous sclerosis complex
  1 (TSC1)/TSC2, which inhibits activation of the small GTPase Ras homologue enriched
  in brain (Rheb), thus releasing mTORC1 activation. However, this activation is dependent
  on amino acid sufficiency that is sensed by mTORC1 via the RAS-related GTP-binding
  protein (RAG) GTPases. During starvation periods, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
  either directly inhibits mTORC1 activity or phosphorylates TSC2. In contrast to
  the Akt-mediated phosphorylation, AMPK supports the inhibitory function of this
  complex and therefore represses mTORC1 activation. The best described downstream
  effectors of mTORC1 are ribosomal S6 kinase1 (S6K1) and eIF4E- binding protein 1
  (4E-BP1). The phosphorylation of these effectors promotes translation.Activating
  phosphorylations and GTP are marked in bright orange, while inhibitory phosphorylations
  are displayed in faded red. Abbreviations: Raptor – regulatory-associated protein
  of mTOR; Rictor – Rapamycin insensitive companion of mTOR; SIN1 – stress-activated
  MAP kinase interacting protein1; mLST8 – mammalian lethal with sec-13 protein 8.'
