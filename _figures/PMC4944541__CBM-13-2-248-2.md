caption: Crosstalk between leukemia cell and BM MSCs. LSC/leukemia cells remain dependent
  on signals from the BM niche for survival, proliferation, and as a sanctuary for
  resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. LSC engraftment and proliferation in BM induced
  the stromal microenvironment to create a malignant niche. Leukemic cell-induced
  pro-survival, growth-stimulatory signals change in MSC that mimic an inflammatory
  response, and potentially contribute to LSC therapy resistance. Gene set enrichment
  analysis (GSEA) identified activation of NF-кB as a potential cause of pro-inflammatory
  signaling pathway changes induced by leukemia cells in MSC.
