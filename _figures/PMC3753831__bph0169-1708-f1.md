caption: ERK1/2-mediated regulation of the G1-S phase transition. Nuclear ERK1/2 phosphorylates
  and stabilizes/activates members of ETS and AP1 transcription factor families, which
  can induce transcription of CCND1 (cyclin D1). The transcription factor MYC is stabilized
  by ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation, and MYC can up-regulate the expression of cell
  cycle regulators such as cyclin D2 CCND2 (cyclin D2) and CDC25A. CCND1 and CCND2
  bind to and activate CDK4 and CDK6 (CDK4/6). Phosphorylation of RB by CDK4/6 frees
  the E2F transcription factors from RB-mediated repression, allowing E2F-induced
  transcription of genes such as CCNE (cyclin E), CCNA (cyclin A) and MYC. Newly synthesized
  CCNE binds and activates CDK2, which can also phosphorylate RB in a feedforward
  loop. p27KIP1, an endogenous inhibitor of CDK2, is down-regulated and inactivated
  during cell cycle entry by a variety of mechanisms mediated by cyclin E-CDK2, ERK1/2
  and RSK. CDK2, initially in complex with CCNE and later with CCNA, and the E2F transcription
  factors regulate many target factors to drive progression into, and through, S phase.
  ERK1/2 signalling is frequently hyperactivated in tumour cells as a result of mutations
  in RTKs, RAS or BRAF (shown, yellow star), providing validation for selective inhibitors
  of mutant BRAF (e.g. vemurafenib) or MEK1/2 (e.g. selumetinib).
