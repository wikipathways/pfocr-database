caption: Interactions and functions of NRPs. NRPs interact with five major types of
  soluble ligands such as TGF‐β1, VEGF, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), platelet‐derived
  growth factor (PDGF)‐BB, and semaphorin 3 (SEMA3) family and their corresponding
  signaling receptors as a receptor or coreceptor. The functions mediated by growth
  factor (GF) pathways (HGF, PDGF, etc.) overlap with several other cellular functions.
  The TGF‐β canonical signaling pathway mainly yields antiproliferative, cell transformative,
  and immunosuppressive effects, which can be inhibited through TGF‐β noncanonical
  signaling.,  NRPs activate p130Cas adaptor molecule upon binding to GFs and can
  inhibit canonical SMAD2/3 signaling, while preferring noncanonical signaling. Additionally,
  SEMA3 ligands crosstalk with NRPs and plexins in order to regulate axonal guidance
  and suppress other cellular functions such as proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis
