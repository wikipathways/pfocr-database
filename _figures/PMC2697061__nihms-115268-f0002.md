caption: ER stress triggers PERK dimerization and auto-phosphorylation. Activated
  PERK attenuates protein biosynthesis by phosphorylating eIF2α. Phosphorylated eIF2α
  also activates transcription factor ATF4, which enhances the stress-induced expression
  of numerous cytoprotective genes. Additionally, ATF4 increases the expression of
  CHOP, which induces GADD34 expression. GAAD34 binds to PP1 and forms the GADD34-PP1
  complex that specifically dephosphorylates eIF2α. ER stress also triggers IRE1dimerization
  and auto-phosphorylation. Activation of IRE1 initiates the splicing of XBP1 mRNA,
  producing an active transcription factor sXBP-1. Additionally, ATF6 becomes an active
  transcription factor by transiting to the Golgi complex, where it is cleaved by
  the proteases S1P and S2P. The activation of IRE1 signaling and the cleavage of
  ATF6 promote ER expansion and the expression of ER-localized chaperones. In multicellular
  organisms, if these adaptive responses are not sufficient to resolve the folding
  problems in the ER, the UPR will trigger an apoptotic program, such as activation
  of caspase 12 or CHOP, to eliminate the cells.
