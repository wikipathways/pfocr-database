caption: Irisin can activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway by reducing
  intracellular ATP levels, or by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) or intracellular
  calcium concentrations. Activation of the AMPK pathway stimulates the expression
  of GLUT4 (also known as SLC2A4), HK2 and PPARA genes and inhibits the expression
  of PYGM and PCK1 (also known as PEPCKC). The high expression of GLUT4 and HK2, combined
  with the increased translocation of GLUT4 protein from the cytoplasm to the membrane
  (mainly via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway), induces glucose
  uptake by myocytes. Conversely, inhibition of PYGM and PCK1 expression reduces glycogenolysis
  and gluconeogenesis. In addition, the increased expression of PPARA stimulates lipid
  metabolism. The irisin–AMPK pathway also increases fatty acid β-oxidation. Finally,
  irisin stimulates biogenesis in mitochondria by regulating the expression of PPARA
  and TFAM genes and of UCP3 protein.
