caption: Impact of the WalKR two-component system (TCS) on S. aureus virulence. The
  WalKR TCS is activated through phosphorylation of the WalR response regulator by
  the WalK histidine kinase, leading to increased expression of several genes involved
  in cell wall (CW) degradation and turnover. Higher release rates of CW degradation
  products after infection can then trigger the host innate immune response through
  activation of the NF-κB pathway, resulting in more efficient bacterial clearance
  and decreased virulence. Increased WalKR activity also leads to stimulation of the
  SaeSR TCS (dotted arrow) and higher expression of virulence genes involved in host-pathogen
  interactions and innate immune system evasion. Fine-tuning of WalKR activity must
  therefore play an important role in the switch between S. aureus commensal and pathogenic
  lifestyles.
