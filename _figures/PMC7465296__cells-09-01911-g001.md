caption: 'Zebrafish is a suitable tool for the study of cell signaling in bone, starting
  from the bone formation mechanism which recapitulates mammals molecular pattern
  involving orthologous genes runx2a/runx2b, osterix (osx) and downstream genes coding
  for bone matrix proteins (e.g., osteonectin (osn), osteopontin and collagens), (1).
  Mammalian bone homeostasis and remodeling processes are recapitulated in zebrafish,
  since they involve the same molecular pathway: high levels of RANKL produced by
  osteoblast (ob) bind to RANK receptor on preosteoclasts inducing osteoclast (oc)
  maturation and consequent bone reabsorption. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) inhibits RANKL–RANK
  binding by acting as decoy receptor allowing osteocyte maturation and thus bone
  formation (2). Notably, a very peculiar characteristic in zebrafish is the ability
  to regenerate entirely functional appendages after injury, such as the caudal fin
  after cut (3). Regeneration is accomplished by dedifferentiating mature osteoblasts
  into precursors and resetting the bone formation signaling pattern made of sequential
  activation of runx2, osx, and genes coding for bone matrix proteins. Zebrafish also
  grants feasible genetic manipulation and investigations in the adult stage at bearable
  costs. This is a valuable advantage since some human degenerative skeletal disorders
  are phenotypically evident in adults. Zebrafish mutants for human bone disorders
  can be generated at ease and furthermore studied also in the homozygous condition,
  which may result lethal in the mammalian orthologs (4). In this way, it is possible
  to investigate gene functions that cannot be addressed otherwise and also to test
  possible pharmacological treatments both in the adult and larval stages in a high
  number of individuals (5). Created with BioRender.com.'
