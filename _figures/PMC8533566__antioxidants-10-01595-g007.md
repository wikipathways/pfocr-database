caption: Downregulated genes of SOD3 mutants are associated with synaptic dysregulation.
  GO pathway analysis enriched for the Synaptic Vesicle Cycle pathway in both the
  downregulated gene lists of over-expresser and knockout animals. Genes downregulated
  the over-expresser are denoted in green along with a green arrowhead, while those
  downregulated in the knockout are in red with a red arrowhead. The gene downregulated
  in both is designated in dark blue with both red and green arrowheads.
