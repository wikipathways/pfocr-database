caption: FluMap, a comprehensive IAV pathway map. FluMap was created with CellDesigner
  version 4.3. A total of 960 factors and 456 reactions were included. The SBML and
  high-resolution image PDF files are available as Additional Data. When FluMap is
  opened in CellDesigner, all factors, reactions, and cellular compartments included
  in the map are listed in the SBML file, and symbols used to build the map are illustrated
  in the legend of Additional file . (See also Additional file ).
