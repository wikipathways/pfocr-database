caption: 'Liver X receptor perturbations of lipid metabolism in diabetic retinopathy.
  Under normal physiological conditions, transcriptional activity of LXRs is increased
  in response to elevated cellular levels of cholesterol. A high glucose environment
  attenuates activation of LXR, inducing the downregulations of transporters ABCA1
  and ABCG1 on the cell membrane. Consequence of cellular cholesterol accumulation
  causes oxidative stress and inflammation in vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore,
  the increased expression level of VEGF downregulates tight junction proteins ZO-1
  and occludin, leading to blood-retinal breakdown. LXR agonists can eventually reverse
  this pathological process. LXR: liver X receptor; RXR: retinoid X receptor; ABCA1:
  ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1; ABCG1: ATP-binding cassette subfamily
  G member 1; apo: apolipoprotein; ZO-1: zonula occludens-1.'
