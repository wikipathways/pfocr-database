caption: Schematics of classical CSR from IgM to IgA. Mature B cells constitutively
  transcribe VDJ, Cμ and Cδ genes encoding IgM and IgD. In the presence of specific
  sets of activation signals, B cells initiate germline transcription of downstream
  Cγ, Cα (shown here) or Cε genes throughout a genomic region encompassing the initiation
  (I) exon and the S region located upstream of each of these CH genes. Germline transcription
  is preceded by the activation of a promoter sequence positioned upstream of the
  I exon and further requires the 3′ RR located downstream of the Cα gene (not shown).
  In addition to initiating germline transcription, B cell-activation signals induce
  the expression of the DNA-editing enzyme AID, which is an essential component of
  the CSR machinery. Together with other proteins, AID binds DNA-RNA hybrids from
  the targeted donor Sμ and acceptor Sγ, Sα (shown here) or Sε regions and thereafter
  introduces DNA lesions that are ultimately processed into double-strand DNA breaks.
  These breaks undergo fusion through the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway,
  which includes the DNA repair protein 53BP1. The resulting looping-out deletion
  of the DNA interposed between Sμ and Sγ, Sα (shown here) or Sε regions causes loss
  of the Cμ gene and juxtaposition of the VDJ gene with a downstream Cγ, Cα (shown
  here) or Cε gene. Finally, the recombined IgH locus undergoes transcription and
  splicing events that lead to the formation of mature mRNAs encoding transmembrane
  or secreted IgG, IgA (shown here) or IgE. Graphics depict a segment of the human
  IgH locus and the resulting pre-mRNA and mature mRNAs. L, leader sequence. Eμ, IgH
  enhancer μ, also known as IgH 5′ enhancer or IgH intronic enhancer. Iμ, initiation
  μ exon. μS, 3′ segment of the Cμ4 exon encoding the secretory (S) piece of IgM.
  Poly-An, terminal polyadenylation exon. μm, exon encoding the transmembrane region
  of IgM. Pα, promoter. Iα, initiation α exon. αS, 3′ segment of the Cα3 exon encoding
  the secretory (S) piece of IgA. αm, exon encoding the transmembrane region of IgA.
  3′RR, IgH 3′ regulatory region, also known as IgH 3′ enhancer.
