caption: Degradation of plastics into microplastics and their entry into the human
  body. Common plastic polymers, including polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene
  terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, and polyurethane, degrade into
  microplastics. These microplastics are widely dispersed in the environment, including
  air, water, and soil. The primary pathways for their entry into the human body include
  ingestion through the gastrointestinal tract, inhalation through the lungs, and
  skin contact
