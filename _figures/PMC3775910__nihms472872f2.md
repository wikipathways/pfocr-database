caption: Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize wear debris around loose implants.
  Wear particles are generated from articulating and non-articulating surfaces of
  artificial joints. Particles with/without carrier proteins are recognized, as such
  or after phagocytosis, by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type
  lectin receptors (CLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomelization
  domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoid acid inducible gene (RIG)-I-like
  receptors (RLRs) which finally leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  [e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, interferon
  (IFN)-γ and type I IFN]. In vitro, implant-derived wear debris was reported to induce
  NALP3 inflammasome [the neutral apoptosis inhibitor protein (NAIP), MHC class II
  transcription activator (CIITA), heterokaryon incompatibility locus E protein from
  Podospora anserine (HET-E) and telomerase-associated protein (TP1) (=NACHT), leucine-rich
  repeat and pyrin-domain-containing protein 3 or NALP 3 inflammasome]. Wear particles
  activate the NALP3 inflammasome pathway so that the proinflammatory cytokine precursors
  pro-IL-1-β, and pro-IL-18 are proteolytically activated by caspase-1. NF-κB = nuclear
  factor kappa B; NFAT = nuclear factor of activated T-cells; MAPKs = mitogen activated
  protein kinases; AP-1 = activator protein 1; IRF= interferon regulatory factor.
