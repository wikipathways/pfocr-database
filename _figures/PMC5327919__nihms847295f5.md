caption: Overall pathway analysis shows the pathways, which played important roles
  in shaping the lipidomic profile of serum in the 90Sr-exposed mice based on the
  statistically significant intermediates identified in this study. This figure summarizes
  all the observed perturbations in the lipidome. The location (membrane bilayer,
  cytosol) of each observed cellular response is numerically marked.
