caption: Engagement of the type I IL-4 receptor by IL-4 brings about tyrosine phosphorylation
  of the associated JAKs, key tyrosine residues (pY1-5) in the cytoplasmic domain
  in IL-4Ra, STAT6 and IRS-2. STAT6 is dephosphorylated by SHP1, a protein tyrosine
  phosphatase (A). De-phosphorylation of STAT6 is critical to limit autoimmune and
  Th2 allergic inflammation, mast cell, B cell and epithelial cell activation. IRS-2
  binds the regulatory p85 subunit of PI3-K, activating the enzyme to generate PIP3.
  In turn, PIP3 activates PDK1 and mTORC2. The proteins comprising the two mTOR complexes
  1 and 2 are shown (B). TORC2 kinase phosphorylates AKT on serine 473 and to SGK1
  in CD4+ T cells, leading to Th2 polarization. AKT inactivation of the Tsc1/2 complex
  prevents hydrolysis of GTP bound to Rheb. GTP-bound Rheb activates mTORC1, triggering
  a negative feedback loop via multiple pathways on IL-4-activated IRS-2/PI3-K/AKT
  signaling (C). The composition of the mTORC1 complex is shown. The mTORC1 complex
  also regulates macrophage polarization, as Raptor-deficient macrophages have enhanced
  M1 and M2 responses. The mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes also regulate by unknown mechanisms,
  the polarization of T cells [adapted from ()]. An additional negative regulatory
  pathway triggered by IL-4 is the induction of the SOCS proteins. SOCS1 binds IRS-2
  and targets it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (D). Phosphotyrosine, pY; phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase, PI3-K; phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, PIP3; 3-phosphoinositide
  dependent protein kinase-1, PDK1; mTOR complex 2, mTORC2; serum and glucocorticoid-inducible
  kinase 1, SGK1; Ras homolog enriched in brain, RHEB; tuberous sclerosis complex
  1, TSC1; regulatory-associated protein of mTOR, Raptor; mammalian lethal with Sec13
  protein 8, mLST8; proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa, PRAS40; DEP-domain-containing
  mTOR-interacting protein, DEPTOR; rapamycin-insensitive companion of TOR, RICTOR;
  mammalian stress-activated protein kinase-interacting protein 1, mSIN1; protein
  observed with RICTOR, PROTOR; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, SOCS1.
