caption: Schematic overview of glycolysis and the fates of pyruvate in Streptococcus
  pneumoniae D39 (serotype 2). In this study, we provide genetic evidence that the
  pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) is a functional pathway for the production
  of acetyl-CoA under aerobic conditions, consistent with previous findings in the
  TIGR4 strain (), and that pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) is the major pathway for
  acetyl-CoA synthesis under anaerobic conditions. Note that acetate kinase (AckA)
  and phosphate acetyltransferase (Pta) are reversible enzymes and are represented
  here with double-headed arrows ().
