caption: The hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway. Under adequate oxygen pressure,
  prolyl-hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs) hydroxylate two prolyl residues on the
  α-subunit of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF-α). The hydroxylated
  residues are recognized by the ubiquitin ligase Von Hippel–Lindau, leading to subsequent
  degradation of HIF-α via the proteasome (upper part of the figure). However, during
  hypoxia (deprived oxygen pressure), PHDs are inactive and HIF-α is able to translocate
  into the nucleus, interacts with the HIF-β subunit and P300/CBP enabling binding
  to hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE) in the promotor region of genes implicated
  in the hypoxia response (lower part of the figure).
