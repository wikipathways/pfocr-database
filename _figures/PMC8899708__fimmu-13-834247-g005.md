caption: 'Pathway and structural details of MAP3K8 as potential drug target. (A) Diagrammatic
  representation of MAP3K8 signaling in innate and stromal cells for persistent inflammation.
  (B) Unique binding mode of a preclinical inhibitor in MAP3K8 kinase domain (PDB:
  5IU2). Active site residues providing hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions
  are present in hinge region, helix-αC element as well as selectivity pocket formed
  due to extended flexible P-loop of kinase domain. Secondary structure of kinase
  domain is rendered as line ribbon including P-loop in blue, hinge region in red
  and rest of the domain in white. Key residues of the domain are rendered as black
  sticks, water molecules as sticks in element color and inhibitor as yellow ball
  and stick model. Soft surface of inhibitor is depicted in light yellow and hydrogen
  bond interactions as yellow dashed lines.'
