caption: Biosynthetic and catabolic pathways in the brain. Cholesterol is the end
  product of the mevalonate pathway. Three molecules of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)
  are required to generate 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) which is the
  substrate of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the mevalonic acid-generating enzyme. This
  is the only limiting rate reaction in cholesterol synthesis and is the target of
  statins, the cholesterol-lowering drugs. Mevalonic acid is then converted to farnesyl
  diphosphate (farnesyl-PP) and squalene. The latter is then converted to 2,3 oxidosqualene
  by squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Then a series of enzymes catalyzes the synthesis of
  zymosterol, which can, in turn, be converted to cholesterol via desmosterol by 24-dehydrocholesterol
  reductase, also known as the Bloch pathway (operating in astrocytes) or via lathosterol
  (not shown), which is the precursor of 7-dehydrocholesterol, also known as the Kandutsch-Russell
  pathway (the minority pathway in neurons). The enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase,
  which converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, is defective in patients with
  SLOS. Cholesterol, in turn, must be converted to 24-S-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC)
  by 24-hydroxylase (CYP46) to be able to permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
