caption: 'Fluoropyrimidines (5-fluorouracil and the oral prodrug capecitabine and
  tegafur) are for the 90% rapidly catabolized in the liver, whereas only 10% is anabolized
  by forming metabolites responsible for the drug mechanism of action. The rate-limiting
  step of 5-FU catabolism is catalyzed by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) with
  the synthesis of dihydrofluorouracil (DHFU) and subsequent metabolic reactions lead
  to the synthesis of inactive compounds excreted by the urinary tract. The main mechanism
  of action of fluoropyrimidines includes the interaction by either direct or indirect
  mechanisms, with normal nucleoside biosynthesis. In fact, when active metabolites
  produced as FUTP, FdUTP, FdUMP are embedded as analogues of pyrimidines in RNA and
  DNA synthesis, they break the nucleic acid filaments by promoting apoptosis in cancer
  cells. FdUMP furthermore inhibit the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) enzyme by forming
  a covalent ternary complex. The inhibition of this reaction not only interrupts
  the biosynthesis of DNA nucleotides but also interferes with the folate cycle. In
  this last pathway methylene tetrahydrophilate reductase (MTHFR) is the key enzyme
  of transmetilation reactions: methyl groups derived from the folate pool in fact
  permits homocysteine-methionine reconversion by recycling the methyl group bound
  to Vitamin B12 as a cofactor. DPYD - dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase; DHFU - dihydrofluorouracil;
  FUTP - fluorouridine triphosphate; FdUTP - fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate; FdUMP
  - fluorouridine monophosphate; TYMS - thymidylate synthase; MTHFR - methylene tetrahydrophilate
  reductase.'
