caption: Hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 promotes BNIP3 and BNIP3L transcription, thereby
  activating Beclin 1 by disrupting the Bcl-2-Beclin1 complex. Beclin 1 is required
  for the nucleation of autophagy. The mTOR signaling pathway plays a central role
  in hypoxia-induced autophagy. Inactivation of mTOR during hypoxia leads to activation
  of the autophagy-initiating kinase ULK1, which is required for the initiation of
  autophagy. Translational regulation also plays provital roles in hypoxia-induced
  autophagy, including mitochondrial autophagy (Mitophagy). Hypoxia inactivates mTOR
  and thus leads to dephosphorylation of 4E-BPs, which represses cap-dependent translation
  initiation by sequestering eIF4E. The RPS6 kinase RPS6K is also down-regulated by
  mTOR inactivation. On the other hand, hypoxia causes ER stress and thus leads to
  phosphorylation of eIF2α by PERK. Phosphorylation of eIF2α inhibits translation
  initiation by preventing the eIF2-GTP-tRNA(i)Met ternary complex formation. Other
  unknown mechanisms (?) of translational regulation during hypoxia remain to be established.
  Notably, hypoxia induces translation of lysosomal proteins (yellow arrow) and ATF4,
  which activates LC3-dependent autophagy. The abundance of several translation factors
  involved in the mTOR and PERK signaling pathways is also regulated by hypoxia. The
  color represents up-regulated (blue) or down-regulated (red) genes at the translational
  level.
