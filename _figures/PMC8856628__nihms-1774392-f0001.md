caption: GEM (2’,2’-difluorodeoxycytidine, dFdC) crosses the cell membrane and is
  continuously phosphorylated by the phosphorylation rate-limiting enzyme deoxycytidine
  kinase (dCK) to form GEM monophosphate (dFdCMP), GEM diphosphate (dFdCDP), and GEM
  triphosphate (dFdCTP). As a substrate for DNA polymerase, dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine
  triphosphate (dCTP), a raw material for DNA synthesis. DNA polymerase stochastically
  incorporates dFdCTP into DNA during replication, which terminates DNA strand elongation
  and ultimately leads to apoptosis. Two active metabolites, dFdCDP and dFdCTP, can
  inhibit ribonucleotide reductase (RR). RR is the rate-limiting enzyme (RRM1 and
  RRM2) in the DNA synthesis pathway and is mainly responsible for converting ribonucleotides
  into deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), which are essential for DNA assembly
  and repair. In addition, dFdCDP and dFdCTP can inhibit cytidine deaminase (CDA)
  or deoxycytidylate deaminase (DCTD), which can inactivate dFdCMP.
