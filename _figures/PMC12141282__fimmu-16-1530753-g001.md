caption: The vicious cycle in the lungs of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patients.
  Inflammation triggers the NF-κB signaling pathway via pathogen-associated molecular
  pattern (PAMP) or damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) receptors, leading
  to the expression of NLRP3 and IL-1β. NLRP3 proteins assemble into the NLRP3 inflammasome
  complex, activating caspase-1 to trigger pyroptosis and facilitate the maturation
  of IL-1β and IL-18, thereby initiating downstream immune responses. The NLRP3-mediated
  inflammatory response can ultimately promote B cell proliferation and antibody production
  as well as T cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine release. ACPA enhances
  the expression of NLRP3 and IL-1β. This abnormal activation may create a vicious
  cycle in the lungs of seropositive RA patients and potentially lead to a cytokine
  storm
