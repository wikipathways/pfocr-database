caption: Both mechanical signals and immune response can regulate tendon cells and
  further influence tendon regeneration. Inflammation and mechanical signals can control
  the tenogenic differentiation by regulating the transcription of tendon markers
  in tendon cells. Some cytokines and mechanical signals have the same targets, indicating
  a kind of potential co-regulation pathway. However, most mechanosensitive proteins
  are unknown, and the inflammation process still needs a deeper understanding. In
  that, it is necessary to figure out the mechanism of the balance between biomechanics
  and immune response during tendon regeneration.
