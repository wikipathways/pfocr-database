caption: Secreted immunomodulatory factors transcriptionally induced by oncogenic
  Kras signaling. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and granulocyte macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are regulated via the concerted action of mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3K pathways, interleukin (IL)-10 is regulated via
  the MAPK pathway, CXCL8 is induced by both MAPK and canonical nuclear factor (NF)-κB
  pathways, IL-6 is regulated by the noncanonical RalB/TBK1/IKKE/NF-κB pathway, and
  CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 are induced via the classical NF-κB signaling pathway.
