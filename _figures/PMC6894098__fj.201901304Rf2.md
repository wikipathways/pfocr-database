caption: H2S metabolism. H2S can be metabolized via oxidation or methylation, occurring
  in the mitochondria and cytoplasm, respectively. However, H2S oxidation is thought
  to be the primary clearance pathway. During H2S oxidation, H2S is oxidized by SQR,
  thus forming a persulfide. This persulfide is further oxidized by ETHE1 to generate
  SO32−, which is converted to SO42− and S2O32− by sulfite oxidase and rhodanese,
  respectively. SO42− and S2O32− are then excreted into the urine and cleared from
  the body. Electrons released by H2S oxidation by SQR are captured by ubiquinone
  and transferred to the ETC at the levels of complex III. During H2S methylation,
  H2S is converted into CH4S and (CH3)2S via S-methyltransferase (TMT). (CH3)2S can
  also be further metabolized by rhodanese to generate SO42−, which is excreted as
  waste through the urine. Cyt c, cytochrome c.
