caption: 'Pathways involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis in the senescent
  heart. Angiotensin II (ANG II), reactive oxygen species (ROS), transforming growth
  factor β (TGF-β) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) signaling appear to play an important role
  in mediating fibrotic remodeling of the aging heart. ANG II exerts its effects directly
  through the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1) and indirectly through induction of TGF-β.
  Smad 2/3 seems to be a common pathway for these two mechanisms. Age-dependent mitochondrial
  dysfunction is the major source of ROS in the myocardium. ANG II induces NADPH oxidase
  dependent generation of ROS. ROS activate TGF-β and upregulate its downstream fibrogenic
  effector connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). ROS, ANG II and ET-1 induce adhesion
  molecules in the microvascular endothelium and pro-inflammatory mediator expression.
  Inflammatory cytokines may induce and activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
  enhancing matrix degradation. TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling promotes fibroblast proliferation,
  phenotypic conversion to myofibroblasts and the production of extracellular matrix
  components including fibrillar collagen, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. Changes
  in the extracellular matrix occur in part due to an imbalance of MMPs and their
  inhibitors (TIMPs). The altered matrix modifies the pro-survival signals that cardiac
  myocytes receive from their scaffolding environment, leading to cardiomyocyte loss
  due to apoptosis or necrosis. Symbols: E, endothelial cell; Fi, fibroblast; L, lymphocyte,
  Ma, macrophage; M, monocyte; N, neutrophil; TGF-βR, TGF-β receptor; VCAM-1, vascular
  cell adhesion molecule-1; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1'
