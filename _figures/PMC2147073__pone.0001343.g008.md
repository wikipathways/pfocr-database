caption: The generation of α- and the oxygenated mycolic acids is considered to follow
  to two independent pathways. A common, di-unsaturated precursor, Y, is envisaged
  for the two pathways. Y is subsequently transformed into α-mycolic acids by the
  action of the MmaA2 and PcaA that modify the distal or proximal double bond, respectively.
  Action of MmaA4 commits Y to the pathway for the oxygenated mycolic acids, by producing
  the precursor X. MmaA3, which is required for generation of methoxy-mycolic acids
  in M. tb is inactive in M. bovis BCG Pasteur due to the presence of a point mutation
  . The proximal double bond is modified by the CmaA2 (and MmaA2) or PcaA to generate
  trans- or cis-cyclopropanated derivatives, respectively. In the presence of TAC,
  all the CMASs mentioned above are inhibited, except for MmaA4. Due to inhibition
  of MmaA2, excess of Y is diverted to MmaA4 leading to generation of X, which accumulates
  due to lack of activities of CmaA2 and MmaA2. SRI-224 appears to affect MmaA4 to
  a certain degree, leading to accumulation Y in addition to X. (For simplicity, only
  the meromycolyl moiety of mycolates has been depicted).
