caption: 'Fig. 7. Model of the 13mer peptide-mediated invasion pathway. Inactivation
  of RhoA and activation of PAK1 and Cdc42, both upstream of RhoA, are necessary but
  not sufficient for invasion. We explained this through a putative pathway branching
  upstream of Cdc42 at PI3K (question mark). Arrows and arcs indicate activation and
  inactivation, respectively. Crossed arrows indicate dispensable pathways. Open or
  closed circles indicate, respectively, inactivation or activation by pharmacological
  modulators (shaded) or by dominant-negative or constitutively active constructs
  (unshaded). Definitions are: 13mer, 13mer β-casein-derived peptide; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3 kinase; Rac1, Ras related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1; Cdc42, cell division
  cycle 42; PAK1, p21-activated kinase 1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  RhoA, Ras homolog; ROCK, Rho-associated coil-coiled kinase; FAK, p125 focal adhesion
  kinase; CNF1, Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1; C3 exoenzyme, Clostridium
  botulinum exoenzyme C3 transferase.'
