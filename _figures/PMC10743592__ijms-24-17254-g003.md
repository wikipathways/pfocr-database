caption: Presentation of association between apoptosis and necroptosis. The pathway
  of apoptosis is divided into intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway and extrinsic (death
  receptor) pathway. In the intrinsic pathway, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and other
  intrinsic stimuli can stimulate the mitochondria to release cytochrome C, which
  can combine with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 to form apoptosomes. Apoptosomes can activate
  caspase-3/7 to cause apoptosis. The death receptor can initiate apoptosis by caspase-8.
  In addition, the death receptor can recruit RIPK1/3, FADD, and TRADD to form necrosomes
  in the absence of caspase-8. ROS can be released from mitochondria to cause necroptosis.
  Toll-like receptors can also initiate necroptosis. When ligands bind to death receptors,
  the binding can help the transcription of NF-κB. Death receptors can link apoptosis
  with necroptosis. When ghrelin binds to its receptor, Bax, caspase 3/8/9 can be
  affected in the apoptosis. In the necroptosis, ghrelin can influence the levels
  of RIPK1/3 and NF-κB. BCL-2 can inhibit Bax, while Bid can stimulate Bak. Other
  arrows represent the following steps. The figure is made using Biorender
