caption: 'In adipose and muscle capillaries, TG in VLDL (from liver) are hydrolyzed
  into FFA by endothelial-bound LPL and GP1HBP1. ApoC-II activates LPL, thus lowering
  levels of TG whereas apoC-III inhibits LPL, thus raising TG levels. The apoC-III
  in TG-rich VLDL can bind to the TLR2 receptor, thus activating NF-κB, a pro-inflammatory
  transcription factor, which upregulates VCAM1 on the endothelial cell to which monocytes
  attach and migrate into the subendothelial space where they are converted to macrophages
  which take up oxidized lipoproteins and form foam cells and the fatty streak. When
  TG levels are high, HL converts TG-rich LDL to small, dense LDL which have a longer
  half-life and are more readily oxidized. HDL particles pick up the cholesterol ester
  from foam cells and transfer it via CETP to apoB-containing particles in exchange
  for TG. These TG-enriched HDL particles are catabolized faster than large, CE-rich
  HDL, a finding resulting in lower levels of HDL-C, and a dysfunctional HDL particle,
  in the setting of high TG levels and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance (IR)
  affects the pathway as shown.In the acute phase of inflammation induced by nutrient
  excess, FFAs from adipose tissue or nutrient intake lead to activation of the pro-inflammatory
  pathway in which AA is converted via COX and LOX enzymes to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids
  (PGs, TX and LTs) that stimulate the expression of NF-κB and adhesion molecules
  (VCAM-1), release of cytokines and chemokines and recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils
  to the tissues. Following this acute phase, AA, EPA and DHA are actively converted
  via LOX and aspirin acetylated COX-2 into specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs)
  that promote the resolution phase of inflammation (anti-inflammatory/pro-resolution
  pathway) by several mechanisms: 1) decrease NF-κB expression in immune cells and
  endothelial and adipose cells, 2) decrease the production of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α
  from adipocytes and macrophages, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) from
  macrophages and leptin from adipocytes, 3) decrease expression of adhesion molecule
  receptors (e.g. VCAM-1) on the endothelium, 4) decrease monocyte infiltration in
  the inflamed tissue preventing foam cell formation in the arterial wall and crown-like
  foamy macrophages in the adipose tissue, 5) increase the production of adiponectin
  from adipocytes, 6) inhibit neutrophil migration to the adipose tissue and 7) stimulate
  the formation of efferocytic, anti-inflammatory macrophages which promote efferocytosis
  and clearance of the pro-inflammatory apoptotic cells from the inflamed adipose
  tissue and arterial wall.AA, arachidonic acid; Aspirin-COX-2, aspirin acetylated
