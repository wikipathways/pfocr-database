caption: Schematic representation of the cellular mechanisms in endothelial cells
  mediating the antiangiogenic and capillary barrier actions of 2-ME. (i) Disruption
  of tubulin dynamics by 2-ME inhibits cellular accumulation of hypoxia-induced factor-1α
  (HIF-1α), thereby inhibiting its translocation to the nucleus and resulting in inhibition
  of transcription and secretion of angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth
  factor-1 (VEGF-1). Decreased generation of VEGF-1 and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1
  (sFLT-1) protects against endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival
  as well as endothelial barrier dysfunction. 2-ME can also induce antiangiogenic
  effects by causing endothelial cell apoptosis. (ii) 2-ME can generate reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) via activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or directly interacting
  with mitochondria to stimulate caspase-3 leading to apoptosis. (iii) 2-ME can also
  trigger apoptosis by upregulating the extrinsic pathway by increasing the expression
  of death receptor (DR5) and activating caspase-8. The collective effects of these
  mechanisms are protection against endothelial barrier disruption and capillary leak,
  inhibition of angiogenic activity and neovascularisation, and potential protection
  against tumor progression, plaque development, pulmonary hypertension, obesity,
  pre-eclampsia, renal disease, eye disease, endometriosis and rheumatoid arthritis.
