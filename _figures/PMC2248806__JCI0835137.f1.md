caption: In this issue, Denechaud et al. () describe a series of studies that strongly
  challenge a recent report by Mitro et al. () suggesting that LXRα/β has a direct
  glucose-sensing function in liver. Denechaud et al. provide strong evidence for
  ChREBP, not the LXRs, in mediating the effect of glucose on genes in the liver ().
  The regulation of hepatic lipogenesis involves several transcriptional regulatory
  networks. Three transcription factors, ChREBP, LXRα/β, and SREBP-1c, contribute
  to this regulation, but in an often incestuous manner. For instance, LXRα/β has
  been found to regulate the transcription of both ChREBP and SREBP-1c. ChREBP, LXRα/β,
  and SREBP-1c bind to ChOREs, LXR response elements (LXREs), and sterol response
  elements (SREs), respectively. Moreover, DNA binding by ChREBP and LXRα/β requires
  heterodimerization with Max-like protein (Mlx) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), respectively.
  Genes that regulate hepatic lipogenesis have been found to contain 1 or more ChOREs,
  LXREs, and/or SREs. Some genes, such as for FAS, are regulated by all 3 transcription
  factors. The authors demonstrate that glucose flux is necessary for regulation of
  hepatic genes by glucose and that phosphorylation of ChREBP at Ser196 is reciprocally
  regulated by glucose flux. ChREBP is located in the cytoplasm under low plasma glucose
  concentration due to the phosphorylation of Ser196. As the plasma glucose level
  rises, glucose enters hepatocytes and is rapidly equilibrated due to the low-Km
  glucose transporter GLUT2. Glucose phosphorylation is then initiated by GK, leading
  to the formation of xyulose-5-phosphate (X-5-P) by the hexose monophosphate shunt
  pathway. Increased xyulose-5-phosphate in turn appears to cause dephosphorylation
  of Ser196 on ChREBP (probably through activation of PP2A), thereby allowing ChREBP
  to enter the nucleus and affect gene expression. Insulin appears to affect hepatic
  lipogenesis principally by increasing transcription of both ChREBP and SREBP-1c.
