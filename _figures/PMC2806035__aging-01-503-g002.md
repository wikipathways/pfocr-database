caption: The scheme                                             recapitulates the
  pathway of p66Shc that drives mitochondrial H2O2 and its relationship                                             with
  insulin receptor signaling leading to fat accumulation. Food intake determines                                             energetic
  substrate availability and insulin stimulates intracellular                                             transduction
  pathways that regulate gene transcription in order to favor                                             triglyceride
  accumulation. P66Shc-mediated ROS production is                                             directly
  boosted by insulin and in turn potentiates insulin receptor signaling,                                             suppresses
  the expression of uncoupling proteins and beta oxidation enzymes                                             leading
  to triglyceride accumulation.
