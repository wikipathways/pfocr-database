caption: Schematic metabolite maps of MDHΔC-CR plants. (A) Metabolite alterations
  in light-adapted (16 h) MDHΔC-CR plants compared with those in Control-CR plants.
  (B) Metabolite alterations in dark-adapted (8 h) MDHΔC-CR plants compared with those
  in Control-CR plants. (A and B) Plants used for metabolome analysis were grown under
  LD-GL conditions for 4 wk. The ratio of each metabolite content in MDHΔC-CR and
  Control-CR plants was normalized by Log2(fold) and was displayed as a color box
  based on the metabolite data shown in SI Appendix, Table S1 (n = 5, biological replicates).
  Cyan and magenta arrows represent NADPH consuming and producing reactions, respectively.
  Metabolites shown in gray were not determined or not detected. Each symbol indicates
  significant difference (*P < 0.05; †P < 0.01; ‡P < 0.001; Welch’s t test) between
  the values of Control-CR and MDHΔC-CR plants. A map for the malate valve and malate-aspartate
  shuttle is shown without metabolite level data. The metabolome data shown here indicate
  overall levels of metabolites in leaf extracts. 2OG, 2-oxoglutarate; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate;
