caption: Structure and treatment strategy of TAT-CLs-DHA/siRNA. The mechanism of TAT-CLs-DHA/siRNA
  is to inhibit the TLR4 signaling pathway to therapy LN. The therapy was based on
  a synergistic effect involving the HMGB1 siRNA and DHA which the siRNA binds to
  HMGB1 mRNA and the DHA act on the TLR4 signal pathway of immune cell.
