caption: Oncogenic activation of K-Ras stimulates miR-155 expression via MAPK and
  NF-κB pathway. MiR-155 negatively regulates the expression of its downstream target
  Foxo3a, a transcription factor that promotes the expression of two major antioxidants
  including SOD2 and catalase. As such, enhanced expression of miR-155 by oncogenic
  K-Ras may result in further inhibition of Foxo3a, leading to decrease of SOD2 and
  catalase and subsequent accumulation of ROS stress that contribute to cell transformation
  and cancer cell proliferation.
