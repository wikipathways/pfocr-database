caption: Addition of furfural moderately increased expression of most genes in the
  histidine pathway. With the exception of hisG, all other genes in this pathway were
  upregulated in response to furfural addition. Ratios for these changes are shown
  in parentheses. ACR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide.
