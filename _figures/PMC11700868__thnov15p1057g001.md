caption: Scheme of establishment and application of Nano-IFNγ/Zole for remodeling
  the suppressive TIME induced by iRFA. Bisphosphonate-mineralized nano-IFNγ (Nano-IFNγ/Zole)
  was dispersed in alginate gel and injected into the peripheral tumor during the
  final stage of RFA surgery. A single administration of Nano-IFNγ/Zole can exert
  a long-term immune regulatory effect by retaining in residual tumors after iRFA.
  Zoledronate acts as an immune regulator by blocking the mevalonate metabolic pathway
  in TAMs, delaying the acidification process in intracellular lysosomes through blockade
  of isoprene modification of small GTPase in the mevalonate metabolic pathway. Inhibited
  lysosomal acidification activates TFEB signaling and promotes its nuclear translocation,
  which collaborates with IFNγ-mediated JAK/STAT1 pathway on reprogramming the immunosuppressive
  M2 TAMs to M1 type, thereby reshaping the suppressive TIME of CRCLM after iRFA and
  delaying the recurrence and metastasis of residual tumors
