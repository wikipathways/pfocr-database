caption: Molecular basis for AD and interaction with neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus.
  In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is processed by α-secretase that cleaves within
  the Aβ domain. sAPPα and a membrane-bound carboxyl-terminal fragment are generated.
  In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is sequentially cleaved by β- and γ-secretases
  to release the neurotoxic Aβ peptide. β-secretase cleavage of APP forms a secreted
  ectodomain sAPPβ and a membrane-bound fragment. Cleavage of the latter product generates
  AICD and Aβ. Suggested functions of relevant signal molecules in adult hippocampal
  neurogenesis are summarized.
