caption: Players involved in the inflammatory theory of ACM pathogenesis, ultimately
  leading to fibro-fatty replacement. Defects in the desmosomes caused by pathogenic
  mutations (A) trigger signaling cascades leading to the dysregulation of the Wnt
  pathway (inhibition) and the Hippo, GSK3β, NFκB, and TGF-β1/p38 MAPK pathways (activation)
  (B). Abnormalities in these signaling pathways lead to the activation of inflammatory,
  apoptotic, and fibrotic/adipogenic genes, thus resulting in the secretion of inflammatory
  cytokines (i.e., TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17) and the infiltration of inflammatory
  cells (i.e., T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells) (C) and cellular
  damage associated with cardiac cell death (D) and fibro-fatty replacement (E). During
  tissue injury and myocardial degeneration, damaged mitochondria release danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs, as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial (mt)DNA
  fragments), thus further precipitating the immune responses and perpetuating inflammation,
  apoptosis and fibro-adipogenesis (F). Physical stress due to strenuous exercise
  not only causes mechanical injury and cell death in the presence of damaged desmosomes,
  but also stimulates the activation of the immune response and the production of
  pro-inflammatory mediators (G). The myocardium carrying pathogenic alterations in
  genes encoding desmosomal proteins is more vulnerable to the presence of infectious
  agents (i.e., cardiotropic viruses, bacteria, protozoan), leading to the amplification
  of myocardial inflammation, severe myocyte damage and subsequent precipitation of
  the disease (H). Desmosomal disruption and myocardial damage might stimulate an
  immune response by the production of auto-antibodies such as anti-DSG2 (desmoglein
  2), AHA (anti-heart), and AIDA (anti-intercalated disk) antibodies (I).
