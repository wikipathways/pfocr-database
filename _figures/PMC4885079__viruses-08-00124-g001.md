caption: RSV Induces a Non-Canonical UPR Response. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress
  induction upon Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection, possibly as a result
  of ER overload due to glycoprotein RSV F, G and SH transit, is associated with activation
  of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6)
  branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Interaction of F with the binding
  immunoglobulin protein (BiP/GRP78) chaperone could be an initiating event of the
  UPR response. Increased protein folding and degradation capacity are induced as
  a result of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) splicing variant XBP1s production by
  IRE1 endonuclease activity and ATF6f fragment formation. IRE1 acts as a restriction
  factor against RSV independently of XBP1s. IRE1 kinase activity and IRE1-endonuclease
  activity involved in selective mRNA degradation, a process called IRE1-dependent
  decay (RIDD), might contribute to IRE1-dependent inhibition of RSV replication through
  mechanisms that remain to be characterized. Autophagy was shown to promote negative
  feedback on the IRE1 pathway.
