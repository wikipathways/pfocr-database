caption: 'Schematic representation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria.
  The process of OXPHOS is the main pathway in the cell to produce adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP). It consists of two coupled processes embedded in the inner mitochondrial
  membrane (IMM), the electron transport chain (ETC) and the ATP synthesis. In the
  ETC, the reduced substrates NADH and FADH2 are oxidized by the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase
  (Complex I) and succinate-CoenzymeQ reductase (Complex II), respectively. These
  proteins transfer electrons from their substrates onto Q-10, which serves as a substrate
  for the CoenzymeQ-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (Complex III). Q-10 is a highly lipophilic
  substance that is able to diffuse within the IMM. Complex III transfers the electrons
  from Q-10 onto cytochrome c, which is a water-soluble electron carrier, located
  at the surface of the IMM in the IMS. In the final step of the ETC, cytochrome c
  oxidase (Complex IV) uses the electrons from reduced Cyt c to reduce molecular oxygen
  to water. In the process of transferring electrons, the Complexes I, III and IV
  actively move protons (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix to the IMS, forming the
  ΔΨm. Ultimately, this potential is used by the ATP synthase (Complex V) to catalyze
  the generation of ATP from ADP and Pi. ADP: adenosine diphosphate, ATP: adenosine
  triphosphate, Cyt c: cytochrome c, ETC: electron transport chain, FADH2: flavin
  adenine dinucleotide, IMM: inner mitochondrial membrane, IMS: intermembrane space,
  NADH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, Pi: inorganic phosphate, Q-10: coenzymeQ10,
  ΔΨm: mitochondrial membrane potential.'
