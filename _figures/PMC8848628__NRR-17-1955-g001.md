caption: 'In vivo downstream signaling pathways of CSPGs and CSPG receptors.CSPGs
  inhibit axon regeneration and induce retrograde apoptosis by binding CSPG receptors
  (PTPσ, LAR and NgRs) and affecting their downstream signaling pathways. CSPG receptors
  activate RhoA and inactivate Akt signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting axon regeneration
  and inducing retrograde neuronal apoptosis. Chondroitinase ABC treatment can remove
  the binding of CSPGs from CSPG receptors and re-activate the Akt signaling pathway
  after SCI, thus promoting axon regeneration and reducing retrograde neuronal apoptotic
  signaling. Erk activity has been reported to be modulated by CSPG receptors in vitro,
  but the specific in vivoroles after SCI are still unclear. CSPG: Chondroitin sulfate
  proteoglycans; Erk: extracellular regulated kinase; GSK-3β: glycogen synthase kinase-3β;
  LAR: leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase; mTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin;
  NgR: Nogo receptor; PTPσ: protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma; ROCK: Rho-associated
  kinase; SCI: spinal cord injury.'
