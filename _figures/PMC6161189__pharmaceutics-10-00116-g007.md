caption: 'Four different routes have been described for N2B drug delivery. The extracellular
  pathway ① directs the drug to the CNS along the OSN (or trigeminal nerve which is
  not shown here) via bulk flow processes. For the intracellular route ② the drug
  is endocytosed and then shuttled to the CNS where it is finally exocytosed. ③ and
  ④ describe drug transport through or along supporting cells. The drug molecule can
  either be endocytosed by supporting cells or travel through the intercellular space.
  By travelling through the intercellular space ④ the drug has to pass tight junctions
  like zonula occludens (ZO), claudin (CL) and occludin (OC). It should be noted that
  intranasal drug delivery is rather a mixture of these different pathways than being
  limited to one only. Abbreviations: SUS: sustentacular cells; OSN: olfactory sensory
  neuron; OEC: olfactory ensheathing cell; GOB: globose basal cells; HBC: horizontal
  basal cells; BG: Bowman’s gland; CP: cribriform plate; OB: olfactory bulb.'
