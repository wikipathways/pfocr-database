caption: 'The STING pathway in NH and HCs: prospective contribution to transplant
  outcome. (A) Left: As a result of transplantation-related damage, dsDNA from host
  cells (eg, dendritic cells, epithelial cells) or viruses induce cyclic dinucleotide
  (CDN) production by cGAS which bind to and activate STING. Bacterial CDNs can also
  activate STING directly. Downstream of STING signaling, activation of IRF3 and NF-κB
  induce the production of cytokines, which regulate immune activation and reparative
  processes such as epithelial regeneration. Right: STING activation in the NH or
  hematopoietic compartments during SOT could increase T-cell responses against donor
  grafts. STING activation in the NH compartment during allo-HSCT increases aGVHD
  in MHC-matched transplant recipients; however, expression of STING in this compartment
  decreases aGVHD in MHC-mismatched transplant recipients. The potential role of STING
  in auto-HSCT is unclear. Promotion of epithelial repair in the GI tract and/or increased
  anti-pathogen T-cell responses could diminish recipient transplant-related mortality
  (TRM). Alternatively, increased cytokine production as a result of conditioning
  could elevate recipient TRM. (B) STING-targeted agents (see ) can be combined with
  tumor vaccination and checkpoint blockade to promote tumor-specific responses without
  exacerbating GVHD. Application of this strategy could be combined with prophylactic
  GVHD regimens involving posttransplant cyclophosphamide to reduce potential exacerbation
  of donor antihost alloreactivity in addition to direct cytotoxic effects on the
  tumor. EBV, Epstein-Barr virus.'
