caption: A schematic representation of the alcohol-related mechanism of liver injury
  during prolonged EtOH consumption. MeCHO causes an excessive release of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) which leads to cellular damage and induction of the NF-κB pro-inflammatory
  pathway. Additionally, alcohol consumption results in gut permeability, which concludes
  in Kupffer cells stimulation by, i.e., endotoxins (LPS), which stimulates NF-κB-induced
  inflammation even further and also favors fatty acids overproduction. ADH—alcohol
  dehydrogenase, ALDH—aldehyde dehydrogenase, ER—endoplasmic reticulum, EtOH—ethanol,
  IKK—inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase complex, IκBα—inhibitor of nuclear
  factor kappa B alpha, LPS—lipopolysaccharide, MeCHO—acetaldehyde, MeCOOH—acetic
  acid, NF-κB—nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, ROS—reactive
  oxygen species, SREBP-1c—sterol regulatory element-binding protein (for further
  insight on SREBP-1c, please refer to ), TNFR—TNF receptor, TNFα—tumor necrosis factor
  alpha, UPR—unfolded protein response.
