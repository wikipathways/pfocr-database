caption: Schematic representation of the concept of angiotensin II-growth factor cross-talk
  in ureteric bud morphogenesis. Metanephric mesenchyme and stroma interact reciprocally
  with the ureteric bud (UB) and angioblasts to form the metanephros. Multiple gene
  regulatory networks have been shown to regulate UB elongation, branching and nephron
  formation. Signaling molecule Slit2 and its receptor Robo2, forkhead/winged helix
  transcription factors C1 and C2 (FoxC1/C2), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 and
  angiotensin (Ang) II AT2R act to restrict glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
  expression anteriorly and specify correct site of UB outgrowth from the nephric
  duct (, ). GDNF/c-Ret/Wnt11 pathway is the major positive regulator of UB development
  (). Stromal factors Foxd1, retinoic acid receptor (Rar) β2, BMP4, fibroblast growth
  factors (FGF) 7 and 10 play an essential role in UB morphogenesis (). FGF7/10 act
  via FGF receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (RTK2). Angiotensinogen (AGT) and Ang II are
  emerging stromal factors that regulate UB morphogenesis (). Since renin-expressing
  cells are present in the stroma on E12 (), co-localization of AGT () and renin in
  the stroma suggests that Ang II is generated around the UB and acts in a paracrine
  manner on the AT1R and AT2R expressed in the UB to regulate branching. Ang II AT1R
  cross-talks with GDNF/c-Ret/Wnt11 pathway and EGFR. Stimulation of the AT1R by Ang
  II inhibits Spry1 gene expression and thereby releaves inhibition of signaling via
  the GDNF/c-Ret/Wnt11 pathway (). In addition, Ang II enhances tyrosine phosphorylation
  of EGFR in UB cells (). Inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity abrogates Ang
  II-induced UB morphogenesis (). Coupling of Ang II with the AT2R upregulates paired
  box 2 (Pax2) and stimulates UB branching (). Stem cell factor (SCF) is expressed
  in the UB and acts via its receptor c-kit to induce GDNF expression in the metanephric
  mesenchyme and thereby modulate UB branching ().
