caption: Pretreatment with live and pasteurized A. muciniphila can attenuate intestinal
  barrier dysfunction in LPS-induced Caco-2 cells by restoring the inflammatory response
  and by facilitating the assembly of tight junctions. The protective effects of A.
  muciniphila on barrier function were proved to ameliorate inflammation disorders
  by inhibition of the NF-κB pathway and to increase tight junctions via CDX2 mediation
  by activation of the AMPK pathway, both dependent on TLR2. TLR2, Toll-like receptor
  2. LPS, lipopolysaccharide. ZO, zonula occludens. CDX2, Caudal type homeobox 2.
  AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase. NF-κB, Nuclear Factor-Kappa B.
