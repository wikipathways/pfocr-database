caption: Alternative NOTCH pathway representations. NOTCH signalling pathways are
  shown that were either pre-defined through manual curation of literature (a – from
  KEGG) or generated dynamically through known genetic and physical interactions along
  with other molecular properties (b – from GeneMania). The interaction network defined
  by GeneMania was saved an imported into Cytoscape (c - ver.3.2.1) and T-ALL patient
  RPKM values were used to colour nodes based on high/medium/low (red/grey/black)
  expression level
