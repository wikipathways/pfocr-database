caption: Alginate synthesis in Azotobacter vinelandii. (A) Biosynthetic pathway. The
  enzymes (red) as well as the substrates (blue) for alginate production are indicated.
  (B) Genetic arrangement of alginate biosynthetic genes. The experimentally determined
  promoters are indicated by vertical black lines. algD transcription starts from
  three promoters (for details, see the text). The nature of the internal promoters
  upstream alg8, algG, and algA is unknown. Genes are not shown at scale.
