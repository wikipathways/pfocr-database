caption: Proposed pathways for inducing SR Ca2+ leak during β-adrenergic signaling
  and stretch in a ventricular cardiomyocyte. (A) β-AR raises cAMP levels via Gs-protein-dependent
  activation of AC that activates both PKA and Epac. PKA phosphorylates LTCC and PLB
  leading to more Ca2+ influx and faster uptake by SERCA into the SR. Epac activates
  nNOS and CaMKII via an PI3K and AkT signaling cascade promoting SR Ca2+ leak via
  RyR phosphorylation. The broken line indicates a cAMP and Epac-independent pathway
  for local activation of nNOS targeted to RyR in the dyad. RyR not coupled to LTCC
  in T-tubules are not modulated by CaMKII and nNOS. eNOS is localized to caveolae
  and exerts negative effects on LTCC during β-adrenergic stimulation. (B) Mechanotransduction
  involves ROS and NO for RyR activation. The ROS and NO pathway are independent and
  operate on different timescales via different mechanosensors. NOX2 produces ROS
  near RyR in the dyad increasing RyR activity possibly via oxidation of CaMKII. With
  a delay, nNOS is activated via an unknown mechanosensing mechanism. The enhanced
  SR Ca2+ leak promotes Ca2+ waves that activate a transient inward NCX current causing
  DAD. Caveolar eNOS is activated by stretch via PI3K-Akt and positively modulates
  EC coupling outside the dyad by mechanisms that are incompletely understood. See
  text for further details. AC, adenyl cyclase; β-AR, β-adrenergic receptor; cAMP,
  cyclic adenosine 3’,5’-monophosphate; CaMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase II; EC, excitation contraction; DAD, delayed afterdepolarizations; eNOS,
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase; Epac, exchange protein activated by cAMP; LTCC,
  L-type Ca channel; NCX, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; NO, nitric oxide; NOX2, NADPH oxidase
