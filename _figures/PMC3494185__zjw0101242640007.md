caption: Hypothetical schematic of the roles of KPNA2 and E2F1 in NSCLC. Nuclear transportation
  of E2F1 was mediated by KPNA2 through the classical nuclear import pathway. The
  biological functions of downstream effectors of E2F1 were maintained in cells with
  normal expression of KPNA2 and E2F1. In NSCLC cells, aberrantly overexpressed KPNA2
  or E2F1 triggered dysregulation of downstream effectors of E2F1 and contributed
  to oncogenesis.
