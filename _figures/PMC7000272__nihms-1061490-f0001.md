caption: 'RELA interactome. Upstream regulator analysis of IPA identified RELA as
  one of the most activated transcription factors (activation z score = 5.58). Here
  we show selected interactome of RELA which has significant overlap (P value: 1.6E−11)
  with our gene set (GSE105088) of IL-1-induced genes in LNCaP. A complete list of
  proteins in this RELA interactome can be found in . Red color indicates the gene
  encoding the protein was significantly upregulated (IL-1-induced) in our gene set
  and green color indicates downregulation (IL-1-inhibited). Orange color indicates
  predicted activation consistent with knowledge base and blue color indicates predicted
  inhibition, yellow color indicated inconsistent findings between our data and the
  knowledge base. Solid arrow indicates direct relationship and dotted line indicates
  indirect relationship. IPA knowledge base predicts that RELA activates AR expression
  in IL-1-treated cells which is inconsistent (yellow arrow) with our gene expression
  data (GSE105088). IL, interleukin; IPA, ingenuity pathway analysis [Color figure
