caption: 'Physiological regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway. mTOR controls multiple
  downstream effectors, such as S6K/S6/nucleophosmin and 4EBP1/eIF4E, which regulate
  protein synthesis and other processes related to cellular growth, proliferation,
  metabolism, and survival. In response to environmental or physiological stimuli,
  multiple upstream pathways, primarily involving cascades of protein kinases, may
  either activate (PI3K/Akt, ERK) or inhibit (REDD1/REDD2, LKβ1/AMPK) mTOR via modulation
  of the tuberin-hamartin complex and Rheb GTPase. In anabolic states, such as with
  insulin, growth factor, or nutrient stimulation, PI3K/Akt and ERK activate the mTOR
  pathway and induce protein synthesis, cell growth and proliferation. Conversely,
  in catabolic states, the REDD1/REDD2 and LKβ1/AMPK pathways respond to hypoxia or
  energy/nutrient deprivation by inhibiting the mTOR pathway and thus slowing protein
  synthesis, cell growth, and metabolism. In the disease of TSC, mutation of one of
  the TSC genes leads to disinhibition or hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway, causing
  dysregulated growth and proliferation and predisposing to tumor formation. In addition
  to genetic mutations, acquired brain injuries may cause abnormal activation of mTOR
  and related pathways, which may lead to cellular and molecular changes promoting
  epileptogenesis (See ). Note that this schematic figure is oversimplified for clarity,
  as upstream regulators, feedback loops, intermediary steps, and alternative pathways
  (e.g. mTORC1 vs. mTORC2) are not shown. Abbreviations: 4EBP1 – elongation factor
  4E binding protein 1; AMPK – AMP-activated protein kinase; eIF4E – elongation initiation
  factor 4E; ERK – extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; GAP – GTPase activating
  protein; mTOR – mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K – phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase;
  PKB – protein kinase B (a.k.a Akt); PTEN - phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
  on chromosome ten; Rheb – Ras homolog expressed in brain; S6K – ribosomal S6 kinase.'
