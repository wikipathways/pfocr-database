caption: 'BRAF gene signaling pathway. Normal pathway: RAF kinase, a protein encoded
  by BRAF, can activate downstream MEK through phosphorylation. The MAPK/ERK signaling
  pathway can regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis.
  BRAF gene mutated pathway: BRAF remains active if a pathogenic mutation occurs,
  which can lead to the continuous activation of RAF protein, which in turn continuously
  transmits signals to its downstream pathway when no chemical signal is received,
  thus resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation. V600E is a common carcinogenic
  gene mutation site. BRAF, V-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1; FGF, fibroblast
  growth factor; HRG, histidine-rich glycoprotein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; Her2,
