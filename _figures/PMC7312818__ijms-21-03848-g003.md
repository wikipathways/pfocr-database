caption: 'Role of miRNAs in the host–pathogen interaction. (A) Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) engage with the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and activate
  the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the host cell. (B) miRNA directly
  targets the mRNA of retroviruses in host cells. (C) miRNA participates in defense
  mechanisms and targets the genomic replication of viral DNA. (D) LPS inhibits miR-149,
  a direct inhibitor of MyD88, allowing activation of inflammation via the MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6
  signaling pathway and expression of IL-8 in the CF airway. (E) Viral stimulated
  miR-144 and miR-146a target the TRAF6 signaling pathway to counteract the interferon
  defense responses in the human airway. (F) miRNA activated by NF-κB targets proteins
  that inhibit the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to activate inflammation via IL-8. (G)
  Immune cells such as T helper cells can increase the expression of miRNAs against
  viral mRNA as defense mechanisms. (H) miRNA can also be transported from one cell
  to other cells through extracellular vesicles and could target ion channel proteins
  such as CFTR (I). ACE2: Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2; SARS-CoV-2: Severe acute
