caption: 'Correlations of microbiome and different cancers. Hepatic cancer: Hepatic
  cancer is linked to Helicobacter pylori, which is widely acknowledged as a key factor
  in the onset of distal gastric cancer and gastric mucosal lymphoma. Gastric cancer:
  Two metabolites produced by P. gingivalis, acetaldehyde and butyric acid, can induce
  cancer development. Acetaldehyde, a byproduct of ethanol metabolism, induces DNA
  damage and mutations while promoting the proliferation of epithelial cells. Colorectal
  cancer: The influence of MiR-181a-5p extends to multiple tumor attributes, encompassing
  cell growth, metastatic behavior, angiogenesis, the transition from epithelial to
  mesenchymal states, and the regulation of autophagy. Extracellular vesicles containing
  miR-181a-5p are discharged by colorectal cancer cells, triggering IL-6/STAT3 signaling
  in hepatic stellate cells. Changes in the tumor microenvironment and the formation
  of liver metastases occur when CRC cells and hepatic stellate cells interact. Microbes
  produce lactate that binds to GPR81 on cervical squamous cells, activating the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. This process boosts the expression of Fut8, which encodes α-1,6
  fucosyltransferase, thereby halting the progression of cervical cancer. Wnt signaling
  leads to the stabilization of β-catenin, facilitating its translocation into the
  nucleus. When nuclear β-catenin interacts with Tcf, it triggers the expression of
  Wnt target genes, which play a crucial role in governing stem cell behavior and
  tumor formation. In the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin undergoes continuous
  degradation. This figure was generated using BioRender software version 04'
