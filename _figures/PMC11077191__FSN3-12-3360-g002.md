caption: The pathways participating in the lipid‐lowering activity of H‐SVE treatment.
  (a) Steroid biosynthesis, (b) Bile secretion, (c) Cholesterol metabolism, (d) PPAR
  signaling pathway, (e) AMPK signaling pathway, (f) Thyroid hormone signaling pathway,
  (g) Glucagon signaling pathway. Different colors represent different trends in gene
  expression, with orange and blue for up‐ and down‐regulated gene expression, respectively,
  in the Model group compared with the NC; red and green represent up‐ and down‐regulated
  gene expression, respectively, in the H‐SVE group compared with the Model group;
  blank means no significant difference in expression was detected
