caption: The RAS-MEK-ERK pathway represents a chain of protein signalling pathway
  that responds to a mitogen binding to a cell surface receptor. This chain of protein
  communications occurs through sequential protein phosphorylation and ends up by
  affecting the nuclear DNA transcription leading to different cellular changes. Abnormalities
  of certain factors along the pathway can lead to cardiocutaneous syndromes.
