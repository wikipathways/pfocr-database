caption: Neuron-released α-synuclein activated microglia through TLR2, and subsequently
  activated LRRK2 kinase. NFATc2, as a kinase substrate of LRRK2, was directly phosphorylated,
  which accelerated nuclear translocation of NFATc2 where cytokine/chemokine gene
  expression such as IL-6 and TNF-α, were upregulated by NFATc2 transcriptional activity.
  This resulted in a neurotoxic inflammatory environment, which in return aggravated
  the neuronal degeneration in a mouse model of PD. Data from Kim et al.
