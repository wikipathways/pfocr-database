caption: Lipids involved in TGN trafficking. Lipids from the PI and PC synthesis pathways
  are involved in post-TGN transport. Sec14/PITP regulates post-TGN transport probably
  by sensing and balancing between the two pathways. Along the PC pathway, ARF-activated
  phospholipase D (PLD) hydrolyzes PC to PA. PA may stimulate the recruitment of the
  protein machinery required for budding. Along the PI pathway, PI4P and PI(4,5)P2
  are important lipids for recruiting coat proteins for budding and for regulating
  actin cytoskeletal proteins around the TGN. PI4 kinase further interacts with frequenin
  and is probably involved in sensing Ca2+ for regulated secretion. PI(4,5)P2 is known
  to be an activator of ARF and conversely, ARF and PA can stimulate the production
  of PI(4,5)P2. ARF was recently shown to directly recruit PI4 kinase and PI4,5 kinase
  to the TGN, an additional way of converging lipid kinases, coat machinery and actin
  cytoskeleton proteins in post-TGN transport.
