caption: Schematic outline of the elimination of apoptotic tissue from the sponge
  S. domuncula, after induction with the Fe++ chelator Dip. Initially the expression
  of the HAD gene is induced as a response to Dip. After initiation of Dip-induced
  apoptosis the caspase gene is upregulated and, sequentially, the expression of the
  ASABF gene sets on. While quinolinic acid, a metabolite synthesized via the HAD/kynurenine
  pathway, attracts the gastropod Bittium sp. the terminally expressed ASABF causes,
  after removal of the apoptotic tissue, an repelling of the gastropods as well as
  a killing of the microorganisms.
