caption: 'The colored circles represent the nodes or proteins of the pathway and the
  black arrows indicate an edge or connection between two nodes of the network. The
  nodes are colored according to their sub cellular locations in the cell () and are
  divided into four regions: Extracellular and Membrane (Blue), Cytoplasm (Red), Nuclear
  (Green) and Output proteins (Yellow) respectively. The size of the nodes is assigned
  according to their total number of connections or degree. Total degree of each node
  is followed by the name of the proteins. The “Bow-Tie” structure of the Hedgehog
  signaling network is easily visible, where the signals are converging towards GLI1
  or GLI2 and diverging to its subsequent steps. The size the node GLI1 is biggest
  as it has highest number of connections or degree among all other proteins in the
  network.'
