caption: 'Effects of aberrant activation of HGF/c-MET signaling pathway on immune
  cells: firstly, HGF/c-MET signaling pathway can promote the increase of glycolysis-mediated
  lactate secretion in tumor cells, which in turn inhibits the proliferation and cytotoxic
  effects of CTL. Second, the abnormally activated HGF/c-MET signaling pathway was
  able to lead to the up-regulation of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, which inhibited
  T-cell activation and led to T-cell depletion by binding to PD-1. Third, the HGF/c-MET
  signaling pathway was able to activate STAT3 phosphorylation in MDSCs and upregulate
  ROS expression, thereby suppressing T cell immune response. In addition, MDSCs can
  competitively deplete cysteine in the body environment, and upregulate the activity
  of iNOS and Arg-1 thereby depleting L-arginine and blocking T-cell production. Finally,
  the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway promotes MDSC recruitment and expansion, and MDSCs
  can secrete TGF-β to promote the proliferation of Tregs and IL-10 and IFN-γ to induce
  the immunosuppressive function of Tregs. This figure was created using Figdraw'
