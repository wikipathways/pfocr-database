caption: 'Autophagy impairment in PD. Impaired forms of autophagy have been observed
  in PD. Genetic mutations of α-syn are linked to impairment of the autophagy process.
  Many factors, such as genetic factors, defective mitochondrial trafficking, oxidative
  stress, dysfunctional ATP cycle, deregulated mitochondrial dynamics, and altered
  mitogenesis perturb healthy mitochondria. Damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria allow
  PINK1 to recruit PRKN, which in turn activates other essential proteins, such as
  OPTN and ubiquitin, Rab7 and others thus to initiate a quality control process,
  i.e., mitophagy. The function of the Rab7 is regulated by the TBC1D15/17 (belong
  to the TBC family with Rab-GAP functions), which is also regulate the shaping and
  target functions of isolation membrane by cross-linking with Fis1 and MAP1LC3B.
  The sequential steps of mitophagy are: formation of the phagophore, maturation into
  the mitoautophagosome, and fusion of the mitoautophagosome with the lysosome. Conventional
  autophagy also plays an essential role in (both naïve and aggregated) α-syn degradation.
  α-syn selectively binds to the pathogen-recognition receptor, TLR-4, which activates
  the downstream signaling pathway following NF-κB activation, to stimulate SQSTM1/p62
  production. The SQSTM1 produced binds to the internalized α-syn and initiates the
  autophagy process. Dysregulation of the autophagy process leads to the accumulation
  of α-syn alongside SQSTM1. Apart from mitophagy and macroautophagy, CMA also selectively
  degrades α-syn, which contains a KFERQ-like motif. Selective CMA inhibition or altered
  CMA functioning affect α-syn degradation. Abbreviations not described in the text:
  Fis1, Mitochondrial fission 1 protein; GAP, GTPase-activating proteins; IKK, IκB
  kinase; MyD88, myeloid differentiation protein 88; Rab, Ras superfamily of small
  G proteins; TBC, Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16; TIRAP, Toll-interleukin 1 receptor adaptor protein.'
