caption: The HIPPO (hpo)-Large tumor suppressor (Lats) pathway validated in Drosophila
  melanogaster and its similar pathway recently postulated in mammals. The network
  involves Hippo (Hpo), Salvador (Sav), Lats1/Warts (dNDRs), Mats (Mob as tumor suppressor,
  dMob1) and Yorkie (Yki) factors, and participates to the control of tissue growth
  by regulating cell cycle arrest and cell death. In Drosophila Hpo interacts with
  Sav, which acts as a scaffold protein, and phosphorilates Warts-Mats. Activated
  Warts can negatively regulate the transcription of cell cycle and cell death regulators
  such as cyclin E and the apoptosis inhibitor DIAP1, through the phosphorilation
  of the non-DNA binding transcriptional co-activator Yorkie. All components of the
  HIPPO pathway are well conserved in mammals and they have a similar function in
  humans since Lats1 (Warts), Mob1A (Mats), MST2 (Hippo) and Yap (Yorkie) genes can
  all functionally rescue their correspondent Drosophila mutants.
