caption: 'Estrogen receptor-mediated signaling pathways in the myometrium. The biosynthesis
  of natural E2 occurs in the ovary downstream the actions of the LH and the FSH,
  which are regulated by the GnRH. E2 mediates its biological response through several
  pathways, which can be classified as genomic and nongenomic. There are 3 main mechanisms
  of genomic regulation mediated by ER. Firstly, in the classical pathway, E2 ligands
  passively enter the cells by diffusion. ERα and ERβ are localized in the cytosol
  and are attached to the chaperon Hsp90, which is released after binding with estrogen.
  The estrogen-bound receptors form dimers that enter the nucleus and bind to the
  ERE, specific DNA sequences of the promoters of target genes affecting their transcription.
  Secondly, the nonclassical pathway involves binding the E2-bound ER to TFs that
  are already bound to the DNA. The third mechanism is hormone-independent. The ER
  can regulate E2 responses by activating the signaling of growth factors via the
  phosphorylation of different serine (118/167) residues on the receptor. In addition
  to upregulating gene expression, E2 exerts its nongenomic rapid biological actions
  by interaction with membrane receptors. GPER, a membrane-integrated 7-transmembrane
  receptor, activates heterotrimeric G-proteins after binding with estrogen to elicit
  various nongenomic responses, such as calcium signaling, PKC, and cAMP/PKA pathways.
  Bound-membrane ERs (ERα, ERβ, ER36, and ER46) also activate cytosolic signalings,
  such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK. In addition, the activation of kinases results in the
  phosphorylation of specific transcription factors that regulate gene expression.
  EDCs are exogenous, manufactured chemicals, such as genistein, bisphenol A, and
  phthalates that mimic natural estrogen molecular and cellular responses, thereby
  altering the functions of the endocrine system. These chemicals are associated with
  the developmental origin of fibroids and their pathogenesis. Abbreviations: AC,
