caption: Fatty acid β-oxidation, TG synthesis, and phospholipid biosynthesis pathways.
  In the de novo biosynthesis of phospholipids and TG, esterified fatty acid is condensed
  with sn-glycerol-3-phosphate to form 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate catalyzed by
  glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, followed by formation of phosphatic acid (PA)
  catalyzed by 1-acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase. Duchenne muscular dystrophy
  (DMD) patients have reduced channeling of fatty acids toward β-oxidation, leading
  to reduced phospholipid ratio (). Increased TG accumulation is observed in familial
  partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) patients. DMD, FPLD, and rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy
  (rmd) are described in the section Lipid Abnormalities in Inherited Skeletal Muscle
  Diseases. Description of the skeletal and cardiac manifestations of multiple acyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD),
  medium chain acyl-CoA (MCAD), and short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) are
  described in the section Inherited Cardiac Muscle Diseases. Neutral lipid storage
  disease (NLSD) is described in the section Lipid Storage Disorders. A red “X” indicates
  a defect in the gene and the associated abnormality caused by the defect; a red
  arrow indicates the biosynthetic pathway affected by the abnormality. AGPAT, 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate
  acyltransferase; ChK, choline kinase; CPT, choline phosphotransferase; CT, cholinephosphate
  cytidylyltransferase; EPT, ethanolaminephosphate cytidylyltransferase; DGAT, 1,2-diacylglycerol-acyltransferase;
  G-3-P, glycerol-3-phosphate; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; Lipin-1,
  phophatidate phosphohydrolase; PEMT, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase;
  PSD, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase; PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase.
