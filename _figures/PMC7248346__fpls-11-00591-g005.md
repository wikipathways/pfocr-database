caption: 'AC2/C2 and Autophagy. AC2/C2 modulate the autophagic pathway to facilitate
  infection and inhibit antiviral defense pathways. AC2/C2 stabilize endogenous suppressors
  of RNA silencing to inhibit TGS and PTGS. The following cellular components are
  shown: ADK, Adenosine Kinase; SnRK1, SNF1-Related Kinase 1; PTGS, Post-Transcriptional
  Gene Silencing; ESR, Endogenous Suppressor of RNA Silencing; rgs-CaM, Regulator
  of Gene Silencing Calmodulin-like Protein; TGS, Transcriptional Gene Silencing;
  SGS3, Suppressor of Gene Silencing 3; DCL, Dicer Like; RISC, RNA-Induced Silencing
  Complexes; VSR, Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing; AC2/C2, geminivirus virulence
  factors; CH3, methylated DNA in the viral dsDNA minichromosome. Black arrows represent
  reactions and/or responses that are induced. Red lines indicate inhibition due to
  the ESR. Purple lines indicate inhibition of ADK and SnRK1 and rgs-CaM through interaction
  with AC2 and/or C2 proteins.'
