caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to create a network of biologically relevant
  genes regulated in response to diet for comparisons control versus diet A, control
  versus diet B, and diet C versus diet B. The network is displayed graphically as
  nodes representing genes and edges (the biological relationship between the genes).
  Different shaped nodes represent the functional class of the gene product. The position
  of the node represents the subcellular localization of the gene product. A total
  of 38 genes were represented in the network, with a number of focus genes with functions
  relating to transcription, growth and proliferation, and lipid metabolism
