caption: Pentose phosphate pathway. In Wigglesworthia, the oxidative branch of the
  pentose phosphate pathway is missing and only the regenerative steps are present.
  Missing steps are shown in grey. The YbhE protein is thought to catalyze the conversion
  of d-glucono-1,5-lactone-6-phosphate to 6-phospho-d-gluconate (see the text for
  details).
