caption: The influence of liver-specific glucokinase knockout on the myocardium. The
  liver-specific glucokinase knockout mouse experiences long-term hyperglycemia, which
  induced decreased levels of insulin receptor. Disrupting the early signaling events
  in the insulin pathway also has downstream effects on other proteins including Akt
  and AMPK, ultimately leading to insulin resistance and attenuated glucose uptake.
  Fatty acid synthesis increased in cardiomyocyte by decreased AMPK phosphorylation
  and subsequent increased ACC activity. Increased glucose stimulates NADPH oxidase
  expression. NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide generation then contributes to mitochondrial
  dysfunction, leading to a further increase in superoxide generation. Insulin resistance,
  increasing fatty acid synthesis and oxidative stress induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy
  and fibrosis.
