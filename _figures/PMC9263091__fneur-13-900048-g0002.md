caption: LPS, present in brain cells affected with AD, has an inhibitory effect on
  NF-L expression; a human microbiome-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-NF-kB-miRNA-30b-NF-L
  pathological signaling pathway may be in part responsible for driving altered cytoskeletal
  dynamics, neuronal atrophy and altered trans-synaptic signaling in stressed human
  neuronal-glial (HNG) cells in primary culture and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain.
  LPSs are neurotoxic glycolipids derived from the outer cell wall of non-capsulated
  Gram-negative bacteria; normally they contribute to the integrity of the outer cell
  wall membrane and protect the cell against the action of bile salts and lipophilic
  antibiotics (, , ). Both microbial infection and LPS are strong inducers of NF-kB
  signaling in neurons and other human cell types. miRNA-30b is under transcriptional
  control by NF-kB, and the neuron-specific NF-L chain mRNA-3'-UTR is a target for
  miRNA-30b. Other miRNAs may be involved (see ). Disruption and insufficiency of
  NF-L abundance within the neuron are in part responsible for disturbances in neuronal
  cytoarchitecture, atrophy, and synaptic aberrations as is observed in stressed human
  brain cells and in AD-affected neocortex.
