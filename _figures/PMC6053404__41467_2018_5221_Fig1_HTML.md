caption: Biosynthesis of viridicatin-type fungal alkaloids. a Proposed asq biosynthetic
  pathway in Aspergillus nidulans for the formation of aspoquinolone, and proposed
  pen/png biosynthetic pathway in Penicillium sp. for the formation of penigequinolone.
  b Proposed transformation of the non-4′-methoxylated 6,7-bicyclic cyclopeptin 4
  to 6,6-bicyclic viridicatin 6. The non-heme dioxygenase AsqJ catalyzes the epoxidation
  of 4 to yield (–)-cyclopenin 5. Then, the hemocyanin-like AsqI catalyzes the ring
  contraction in 5 to form 6 via a 6-endo-tet cyclization. c The product methyl isocyanate
  7 was trapped by converting it to carbamothioate 9 with thiophenol 8. DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate; OPP, diphosphate
