caption: Schematic pathway for low-dose PTX inhibition of cell growth in colorectal
  carcinoma cells. In this model, down-regulation of glycolysis-and glutaminolysis-related
  genes by low-dose PTX through an unknown pathway halted cell growth. The blockage
  of cell growth might involve the p53 signaling pathways.
