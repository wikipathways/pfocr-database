caption: DUSP4 deficiency results in ERK activation leading to Lenvatinib resistance.
  (A) In normal HCC cells, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activate RAS-RAF to enhance
  phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2, leading to cancer progression. (B) Lenvatinib
  resistance was accompanied with DUSP4 downregulation, accounting for the activation
  of the MAPK/ERK pathway, which resulted in enhanced cell migration, proliferation,
  survival and inhibited cell death. The inhibition of MEK by Selumetinib enhanced
  treatment sensitivity to Lenvatinib in DUSP4 deficiency HCC.
