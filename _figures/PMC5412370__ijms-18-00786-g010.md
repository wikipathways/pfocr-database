caption: 'Regulation of gene expression by the TSPO ligand PK 11195. It is well known
  that the classical TSPO ligand PK 11195 can modulate mitochondrial TSPO functions
  such as Ca2+ release, ATP production, and ROS generation via modulation of mitochondrial
  proteins such as VDAC, ANT, and complexV (a.k.a. ATP(synth)ase). Ca2+ release, ATP
  production, and ROS are part of the mitochondrial – nuclear signaling pathway for
  regulation of nuclear gene expression. In this pathway, calcium sensitive proteins
  such as calcineurin and calmodulinKIV contribute to induction of expression of immediate
  early genes. The present study shows that PK 11195 exposure at first induces expression
  of immediate early genes, as well as other transcription factors (calcineurin, and
  calmodulinKIV are implicated in these effects), followed by changes in gene expression
  for enzymes and other proteins. Eventual potential functional implications include
  cell proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, cell death, inflammation,
  immune response, and tumorigenicity. While it is impossible to include all co-factors
  and context conditions into this diagram, it should be appreciated that by making
  small and big variations in the research paradigm, other final effects will become
  apparent regarding changes in function due to changes in gene expression, for example
  as a consequence of application of other TSPO ligands, TSPO knockdown, TSPO knockout,
  TSPO gene insertion, full medium, serum free medium, etc. The (*) and the (**) next
  to the phenomena modulated by PK 11195 indicate results from our present study (*)
  and from our previous studies (**). # indicates data from studies by others. (We
  consider it worthwhile for future studies to pay attention to the calcium sensitive
  proteins in the context of gene expression regulation via TSPO activities).'
