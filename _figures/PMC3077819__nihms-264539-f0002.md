caption: Widespread extracellular matrix (ECM) pathway silencing by DNA hypermethylation
  in colon cancer. (A) Hypermethylated genes in colon cancer (green circled) are highlighted
  on a map of the ECM pathway. The network shows interaction of the genes with each
  other within the extracellular matrix. Circled (green) genes include 13 hypermethylated
  genes in CRC derived from our gene discovery approach (LAMA1, MMP2, FBN2, CPAMD8,
  NTNG1, NRCAM, EVL and GPNMB, FLNC, CD109, ICAM5, HAPLN1, and IGFBP3). Arrows indicate
  incoming (←) or outcomming (→) connector between proteins. Colors (Green/Red/Black)
  of line describe positive, negative, and unspecified effect of functional interaction
  (www.genego.com). An additional 6 genes including TIMP2, TIMP3, MMP9, Nidogen, Osteonectin,
  and PLAU were previously identified to be down-regulated in association with DNA
  methylation in other cancer types, and now are shown to be similarly altered in
  colon cancers in the present study. The functional gene ontology analysis was performed
  using the MetaCore database (GeneGo). The Table below the schematic figure shows
  the putative role of all of these 19 genes in the ECM pathway.
