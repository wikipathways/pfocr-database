caption: Perinatal to early infancy versus childhood to adolescence brain metabolism.
  Only main variations between both development times are shown. (a) In the neonatal
  brain, lactate and ketone bodies (KBs) uptake versus glucose ratio is higher than
  in the adult brain. Upon importation of glucose into the neuron, it will be preferentially
  metabolized through the pentose phosphate pathway, generating both NADPH and precursors
  for the synthesis of nucleotides, as well as key element in the antioxidant defense
  of the cell. Glucose might also be further metabolized for the generation of oxalacetate,
  a-Ketoglutarate and pyruvate, all precursors of amino acids which also have specific
  roles as neurotransmitters (NTs), as is the synthesis of glutamate. Lactate and
  KBs are taken up by the cell at much higher rates than found in adults. They undergo
  metabolism for the production of Acetyl CoA, which can either enter the TCA cycle,
  producing NADH used by the mitochondrial electron transport chain for ATP synthesis,
  or for sterol synthesis, such as cholesterol, a key element for neurodevelopment
  signaling and essential component of membranes. KBs are preferentially used over
  lactate for fatty acid synthesis. (b) The astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle metabolism
  model is roughly represented for the adult brain metabolism scheme. Multichannel
  Transporters (MCRs) transport metabolites through membranes into the specified compartment.
