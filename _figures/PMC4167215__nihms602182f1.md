caption: Unfolded proteins, accumulating in the mitochondria, are digested by the
  protease CLPP-1 into short peptides. These peptides are exported into the cytoplasm
  through a transporter HAF-1 and by a yet unknown mechanism inhibit mitochondrial
  import. Impairment of the import allows the nuclear translocation of transcription
  factor ATFS-1, which in non-stress conditions moves into the mitochondria and is
  degraded by protease LONP-1. ATFS-1, together with other nuclear factors UBL-5 and
  DVE-1 activate the protective UPRmt target genes, which reconstitute the mitochondrial
  proteostasis. In parallel to ATFS-1 mediated transcriptional response, ROS, produced
  by stressed mitochondria, activate the kinase GCN-2, which phosphorylates eIF2α,
  which leads to down-regulation of global translation and thus reduces the load of
  new mitochondrial proteins to be folded.
