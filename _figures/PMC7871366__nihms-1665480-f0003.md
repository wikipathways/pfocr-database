caption: IBD risk genes listed at the bottom of each panel represent genetic vulnerabilities
  that perturb key pathways underlying intestinal homeostasis and drive inflammatory
  pathology in the gut mucosa (centre). a, Phagocytes have evolved numerous mechanisms
  to detect microorganisms and elicit effector responses that promote inflammation
  through cytokines and antimicrobicidal responses such as oxidative burst and xenophagy.
  b, Intestinal epithelial cells maintain barrier integrity through dynamic remodelling
  of junctional complexes. c, Coordinated interactions between dendritic cells, T
  cells and B cells facilitate the induction of antigen-specific immune responses
  and immunological memory directed against commensal microorganisms. d, Stromal cells—such
  as fibroblasts—are key mediators of tissue remodelling and healing that dynamically
  respond to inflammatory conditions. e, Cell-extrinsic and -intrinsic stressors associated
  with inflammation sensitize cells to death. The integrated stress response facilitates
  adaptation to these stressors by coordinating cellular responses to ER stress, oxidative
  stress, hypoxia, autophagy and cell death pathways. f, Intercellular communication
  among immune cells, stroma and epithelial cells is tightly controlled by elaborate
  cytokine networks. g, Microbe-sensing pathways that operate in the cytosol of host
  cells function to detect and respond to intracellular infection or exposure to bacterial
  toxins.Distinct inflammasome complexes mediate activation and secretion of IL-1β
  or IL-18 and elicit pyroptosis, a proinflammatory form of programmed cell death.
