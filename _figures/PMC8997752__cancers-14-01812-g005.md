caption: 'Correlation analysis of the CD28/CTLA-4–CD80/86 signaling pathway and of
  the immune modulators CD28 and CTLA-4 with the cytotoxic T-cell marker CD8. (A)
  In the NOM group (n = 41), only CD80 and CD86 expression levels were moderately
  correlated. (B) OSCC (n = 98): strong correlation between CD28 and CD80, e.g., CTLA-4,
  could be observed. CD80 and CTLA-4 expression levels were moderately correlated.
  No correlation between CD86 and CD80 was observed.'
