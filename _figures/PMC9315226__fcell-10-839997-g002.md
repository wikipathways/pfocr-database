caption: Activation of the ERK5 pathway through gene amplification and/or mRNA over-expression
  in melanoma. Both the ERK1/2 and ERK5 pathways are de-regulated in melanoma, but
  by distinct mechanisms. It is well known that the canonical ERK1/2 pathway is activated
  in melanoma through mutations in NRAS (20%) or BRAF (50%–60%). In the case of BRAF
  the vast majority of mutations are BRAFV600E/K which cause constitutive activation
  of BRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signalling; melanoma cells harbouring BRAFV600E/K are addicted
  to ERK1/2 signalling and BRAFi and MEK1/2i are now approved for treatment of BRAFV600E/K-mutant
  melanoma. More recently it has become apparent that the ERK5 pathway is also deregulated
  at high frequency in melanoma, with 47% of primary and metastatic melanomas exhibiting
  gene amplification and/or increases mRNA for ERK5 pathway components including MEKK2/3,
  MEK5, ERK5, and all four MEF2 transcription factors (MEF2A-D). Furthermore, shRNA
  against ERK5 reduces melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and melanoma growth in
  xenograft models suggesting that ERK5 therapies could have benefit in melanoma carrying
  either wild type BRAF or BRAFV600E mutations.
