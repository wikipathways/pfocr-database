caption: Possible mechanisms of anaphylaxis or related events following COVID‐19 vaccination.
  In individuals who were previously exposed to the allergen, the IgE‐mediated mast
  cell degranulation is a possible mechanism. It was also found that the IgG antibodies
  may directly bind to the platelets and granulocytes leading to degranulation and
  the release of various inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, the CARPA is a potential
  mechanism when the IgM/IgG mediate the allergic reaction by activating the classical
  pathway of the complement leading to mast cell degranulation due to the production
  of anaphylatoxins. Anaphylaxis following vaccination could be also triggered by
  CARPA in unsensitized individuals through the activation of the alternative pathway
  of the complement system. CARPA, complement activation‐related pseudo‐allergy; COVID‐19,
  coronavirus disease 2019; IgE, immunoglobulin E; IgG, immunoglobulin G; IgM, immunoglobulin
  M.
