caption: Model of Meristem Maintenance in Rice.This model proposes that rice has two
  CLV-like pathways that negatively regulate stem cell identity. FON2 and FCP1 may
  act as signaling molecules at their putative receptors, FON1 and Y (representing
  an unknown protein). The FON2–FON1 pathway is responsible for regulating the IM
  and FM, whereas the pathway including FCP1 may be involved in regulating the vegetative
  SAM. FON2 may not recognize the putative receptor Y, because no abnormalities in
  the vegetative SAM were induced by FON2 overexpression. Inactivity of FON1 in the
  vegetative SAM has been suggested by our previous work (). The large Xs indicate
  that the gray pathway with this mark is not functional. The question mark indicates
  processes that are unclear at present and remain to be elucidated in the future.
  The stem cell–promoting factor corresponding to WUS in Arabidopsis has not been
  identified to date in rice.
