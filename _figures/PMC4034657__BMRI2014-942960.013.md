caption: Apoptosis pathways. The intrinsic pathway (blue) in myocytes is mediated
  by mitochondria, initiated by release of cytochrome c (white spheres) into the cytosol
  or via extrinsic pathway (violet) through death receptors. Both processes result
  in caspase-3 activation that leads to a cleavage cascade that finally results in
  programmed cell death (PCD) {red spheres represent different subclasses of caspases.
  IAP = inhibitor-of-apoptosis (green); family of proteins that bind and inhibit caspases}.
