  description: Model of the signaling responses under iron (Fe) stress in the root.
    Signal locations and physiological pathways of Fe stress are shown. The soil distribution
    of Fe is highly heterogeneous, Fe stress occurs in both low-Fe and high-Fe environments.
    To cope with this heterogeneity, plant roots, and in particular the root apex,
    engage an array of adaptive responses to adjust their morphology and physiology.
    ① Dynamic changes in root system architecture (RSA) could regulate the exchange
