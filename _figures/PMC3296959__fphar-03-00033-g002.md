caption: Innate immunity and the ubiquitin–proteasome system in PD. Innate immunity
  is used by the cell to increase proteasome degradation of unwanted proteins by direct
  and indirect stimulation of the protesome through interferon-γ and ISG15, a ubiquitin-like
  protein that can be attached to both host and viral proteins. ATM (and appropriately
  functioning LRRK2) usually stimulates innate immune signaling when necessary. However,
  ATM also regulates proteasome-mediated protein turnover through suppression of the
  ISG15 pathway, and together with dysfunctional LRRK2 could decrease proteasome activity
  necessary for an adequate immune response and the degradation of normal cellular
  protein substrates, like dimer or tetramer forms of α-synuclein. As these forms
  are normally degraded through the ubiquitin/proteasome and lysosome/autophagy pathways,
  along with other cellular substrates, dysfunction in these pathways would increase
  α-synuclein to form toxic oligomeric species that also inhibit the proteasome and
  autophagy pathways, as well as innate immunity. This scenario would lead to the
  increase in toxic oligomers of α-synuclein that aggregate into fibrils to form Lewy
  bodies over time.
