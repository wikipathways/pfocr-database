caption: Proposed signaling pathways involved in TP-induced hepatotoxicity. TP suppressed
  the FXR/SHP pathway via inhibiting the Sirt1 activity, which led to dysregulation
  of the expression of FXR-targeted genes involved in bile acid homeostasis and gluconeogenesis.
  Both Sirt1 agonist, SRT1720, and FXR agonist, OCA, reduced TP-induced disruption
  of hepatic metabolism and liver injury.
