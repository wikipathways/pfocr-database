caption: 'During receptor-mediated endocytosis, plasma membrane sphingolipids are
  internalized. Those sphingolipids not targeted for recycling must be catabolized
  in the lysosome first to ceramide and then to sphingosine as they move through the
  endolysosomal pathway. Sphingosine is exported out of the late endosome/lysosome
  where it is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases to S1P. In the endoplasmic reticulum,
  S1P can either be irreversible degraded by S1P lyase or dephosphorylated back to
  sphingosine and reused in the sphingolipid salvage pathway. In NPC, however, in
  addition to the hallmark cholesterol accumulation, there is accumulation of sphingosine
  that contributes to the cellular biology and pathology of NPC disease. Abbreviations:
  GSL, glycosphingolipid; LDL; low density lipo-protein; LDLR, low density lipoprotein
  receptor; SM, sphingomyelin; Cer, ceramide; Sph, sphingosine; SphK1, sphingosine
  kinase 1; S1P. sphin-gosine-1-phosphate; S1PRs, S1P receptors; CE; cholesterol esters;
  FC, free cholesterol; ACAT, cholesterol acyltransferase; SPL, sphingosine-1-phosphate
  lyase; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; Hex, hexadecenal.'
