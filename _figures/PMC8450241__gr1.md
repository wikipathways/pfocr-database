  cerevisiae. The 2-oxo acids phenylpyruvate and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate can be decarboxylated
  into the fusel aldehydes phenylacetaldehyde or p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, by 2-oxo
  acid decarboxylases (Pdc1, Pdc5, Pdc6, Aro10) (in red), or be transaminated into
  l-phenylalanine or l-tyrosine (in green), respectively. These two aromatic amino
  acids can both serve as substrate in the phenylpropanoid pathway (indicated with
  dotted arrows), for cinnamic acid and coumaric acid biosynthesis. The 2-oxo acid
  decarboxylases (Pdc1, Pdc5, Pdc6, Aro10) are also responsible for the decarboxylation
  of pyruvate into acetaldehyde, a step essential for cytosolic acetyl-CoA biosynthesis.
