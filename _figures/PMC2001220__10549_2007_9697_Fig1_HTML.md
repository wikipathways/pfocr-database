caption: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways and ER signaling in endocrine
  resistant breast cancer, with opportunities for targeted intervention. Estrogen
  (E2)-liganded ER activates E2-regulated genes in classical pathway (thick black
  arrow), but following long-term tamoxifen therapy resistance can develop with bidirectional
  cross-talk (gray arrows) between ER and growth factor receptors, with association
  of membrane bound ER with growth factor receptors, and/or IGFR or EGFR/HER2 activation
  of ER phosphorylation. Stars show various targeted therapies. AI aromatase inhibitor,
  SERD selective estrogen receptor down-regulator, MoAb monoclonal antibodies, TKI
  tyrosine kinase inhibitor, FTI farnesyltransferase inhibitor, CCI cell cycle inhibitor.
