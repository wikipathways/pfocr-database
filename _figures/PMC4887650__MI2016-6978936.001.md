caption: TLR4 intracellular signaling pathways. TLR signaling is triggered by ligand-induced
  dimerization of the receptors. TIR domains of TLR4 recruit TIR domain-containing
  adaptor proteins MyD88 and MAL (MyD88-dependent pathway) or TRIF and TRAM (MyD88-independent
  pathway). MyD88-dependent pathway involves the recruitment and the activation of
  IRAKs (IRAK1, IRAK2, and IRAK4) and TRAF6 that induce TAK1 activation. TAK1, in
  turn, leads to MAP kinase kinase- (MKK-) mediated activation of MAPKs (p38, JNK,
  and ERK1/2) and activation of IKK complex. MAPKs and IKK complex induce activation
  and translocation in the nucleus of transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1.
  MyD88-independent pathway involves TRIF and TRAM adaptor proteins and, via TRAF3,
  the recruitment of TBK1/IKKε, followed by the activation and translocation in the
  nucleus of the transcription factor IRF3. MyD88-dependent pathway induces production
  of proinflammatory cytokines, and MyD88-independent pathway induces the production
  of type I interferons.
