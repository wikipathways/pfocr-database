caption: Schematic representation of MAPK signaling to the translational machinery.
  The Ras/ERK (green) and p38MAPK (champagne) pathways impinge at different levels
  on the translational machinery. Although Ras/ERK signaling stimulates the activity
  of both RSK (green) and MNK (orange), the latter is also responsive to agonists
  of the p38MAPK pathway. MNK interacts with eIF4G and on activation phosphorylates
  eIF4E (orange) at Ser209, a site that increases its oncogenic potential and facilitates
  the translation of specific mRNAs. Following stimulation of the Ras/ERK pathway,
  activated RSK phosphorylates rpS6, eIF4B, and eEF2K (green), which are important
  translational regulators. RSK also participates in the regulation of mTORC1 by inhibiting
  TSC2 (red) and Deptor (yellow), which are negative regulators of mTORC1. ERK and
  RSK regulate LKB1-dependent (purple) and -independent phosphorylation of Raptor
  (pink), resulting in increased mTORC1 signaling. ERK and RSK also collaborate in
  the regulation of ribosome biogenesis by promoting TIF-1A phosphorylation (green).
  T bars represent inhibitory signals, whereas arrows indicate stimulatory signals.
  Abbreviations and detailed explanations are provided in the text.
