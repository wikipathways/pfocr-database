caption: Putative pathway for natural parthenocarpy in Musa spp. (A–C) Increase in
  auxin, GA and Cytokinin induces parthenocarpic fruit formation by down regulating
  the expression of MADS box TFs (MaAGL8, MaMADS16, MaMADS29), MaRGA1 (DELLA), MaHK2
  and MaBAM1. MADS box TFs, MaRGA1 and BZR1c ould act as a focal point in auxin mediated
  GA response in parthenocarpy. (D) Genes related to brassinosteroid signaling pathway
  (BZR1) get interacts with Pnsl5 and GRF2act asa bridge between MaHK2, MaBAM1 and
  CLV-WUS signaling pathway that induces seedless fruit formation. (E) CLV-WUSHEL
  signaling pathway where WSIP2 is the wushel interacting protein get interacts with
  WUS, CLV1, AG and thereby associated with MaBAM1 which issignificantly down regulated
  in parthenocarpic accession cv. Pisang Lilin. (F) Group of poly comb proteins (CLF,
  FIE, EMF2, MSI—histone modifying enzymes) which arereported to be involved in epigenetic
  mechanism of reproductive development. Their association to MaBAM1 (involved in
  male/female gametophyte development) and CLV speculated their role in seedless fruit
  formation. KEGG analysis also highlighted that these genes are involved in lysine
  degradation pathway. Green color box indicates hormonal signaling pathway and epigenetic
  mechanism that are predicted to mediate seedless fruit formation; Dotted arrow lines
  represents the putative flow and the association of interaction partners to the
  validated genes which is derived from the constructed PPI network; Highlighted genes
  in rounded rectangle boxes along with ↓ symbol indicating down regulated expression
  pattern in cv. Pisang linin upon pollination (P24) in the current study. Highlighted
  gene in rounded rectangle boxes along with ↑Symbol indicated increased expression
  pattern MaGID1C in cv. Pisang Lilin. Genes mentioned in the triangle boxes are literature
  derived genes where corresponding supporting evidences were given in the discussion
  section.Genes mentioned in the oval boxes are retrieved based on their interaction
  with candidate genes in the constructed PPI network; Where expression of these genes
  MaAGL8, MaMADS16, MaMADS29, MaRGA1 (DELLA), MaHK2, MaBAM1, MaGID1C, MaGH3.8 (mentioned
  in the pathway) were validated in three cultivars C4, CVR and PL of Musa spp.
