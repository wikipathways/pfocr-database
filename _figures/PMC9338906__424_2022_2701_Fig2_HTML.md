caption: Examples of recently discovered metabolic pathways in acute kidney injury.
  (1) Uptake of filtered, non-degradable immunoglobulin light chains in proximal tubular
  cells and accumulation in lysosomes induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production,
  which then activates the redox-sensitive JAK2/STAT1 pathway and interstitial inflammation
  and fibrosis. (2) During acute metabolic acidosis, changes in redox state of the
  vital metabolic co-factor NADH (towards oxidation) and inhibition of fatty acid
  oxidation lead to the accumulation of intracellular lipids. (3) The nephrotoxic
  iron chelator deferasirox (DFX) is highly lipophilic and interacts with the mitochondrial
  inner membrane, causing severe swelling in these organelles and a decrease in cellular
  ATP, probably due to partial uncoupling of the respiratory chain
