caption: Reduced expression levels of Progranulin (GRN) are present from early embryonic
  life. However, the clinical symptoms of disease arise more than half a century later.
  Initially, the disease is in its latent, compensated phase. During this time the
  pathophysiological events slowly progress, but compensatory mechanisms presumably
  prevent the emergence of the disease phenotype. In this latent disease phase, progranulin
  deficiency triggers a complex dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, where
  gene products belonging to the stimulatory, canonical Wnt pathway are upregulated,
  while negative regulators of Wnt signaling show reduced expression levels. This
  results in disruption of mitochondrial energy metabolism, inefficient protein degradation
  and altered cell cycling. At this phase, Wnt dysregulation might be, at least partially,
  a compensatory event, which is likely to become detrimental over a prolonged period
  of time. The neurodegenerative phase is characterized by lysosomal alterations,
  appearance of complex inflammatory processes, disrupted synaptic transmission, myelination
  defects and appearance of TDP-43 inclusions, which jointly lead to neuronal death.
  During this neurodegenerative phase Wnt signaling changes are likely to be detrimental
  to brain function, rather than compensatory. The molecular pathology and cell loss
  ultimately result in functional disturbances and clinical diagnosis of FTD.
