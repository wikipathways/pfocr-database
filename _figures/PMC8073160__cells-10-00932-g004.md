caption: FGF/FGFR signaling in bone—FGF-2 is highly expressed in bone tissues. There
  is a high molecular weight (HMW) form, located in the nucleus, that acts as a transcriptional
  factor, and upregulates the expression of SOST and FGF-23 responsible for inducing
  mineralization. The low molecular weight (LMW) form is cytoplasmic or membrane associated.
  The latter can promote osteoblast differentiation and mineralization through the
  Wnt pathway, BMP-2 signaling, or synergistic action with BMP-2. By activation of
  FGFR signaling, LMW FGF-2 also activates MAPK-ERK/2, which acts as a transcriptional
  factor that upregulates mineralization genes such as RUNX2.
