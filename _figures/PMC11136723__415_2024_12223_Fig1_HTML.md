caption: 'Integrated Schematic of Frataxin’s Multi-Faceted Role in Mitochondrial Bioprocesses
  and its Implications in Friedreich''s Ataxia. The information depicted in this figure
  is adapted and synthesized from publications presented by Tsai et al. 2010 and Mailloux
  et al. 2013 and 2015. Figure offers a comprehensive schematic that illustrates the
  pivotal role of frataxin in Iron–Sulfur (Fe–S) cluster synthesis and its subsequent
  interactions with the TCA cycle, ETC, and OXPHOS within the mitochondrial matrix.
  This understanding holds particular significance for disorders like FA, where compromised
  Fe–S cluster synthesis plays a detrimental role. Deficiencies in frataxin and Fe–S
  clusters can severely hamper the mitochondrial bioprocesses, including efficient
  electron transfer and ATP production, emphasizing the need to understand these relationships
  in both normal and pathological conditions. Left Section (Green): Frataxin’s Role
  in Fe–S Cluster Biosynthesis [16]. The left portion of the figure highlights the
  mechanics of Fe–S cluster biosynthesis facilitated by frataxin. It interacts with
  a multi-protein complex comprised of Nfs1, Isd11, and Isu2, activating the Fe–S
  cluster biosynthetic pathway from its “off” state to “on state”. Upper Section (Red):
  Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and OXPHOS [9, 21]. The upper section of the figure
  elucidates how NADH and succinate, byproducts of the TCA cycle, are oxidized by
  NQR and SQR, both of which rely on Fe–S clusters for effective electron transfer.
  NQR needs 7–8 Fe–S clusters for the systematic transfer of electrons from NADH to
  Q10, converting it into ubiquinol (QH2). SQR uses 3 Fe–S clusters to convert succinate
  and facilitate the transfer of electrons to Q10 (this process links ETC with TCA
  cycle). These processes are intrinsically linked with proton pumping, setting up
  a proton motive force that Complex V (ATP Synthase) uses to synthesize ATP, a process
  known as "coupled" respiration or OXPHOS. Lower Section (Purple): TCA Cycle Integration
  [8]. The lower part of the figure depicts the initiation of the TCA cycle by citrate
  synthase (CS). CS catalyzes the formation of citrate from acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate,
  which is critical for generating NADH, which then feeds into the OXPHOS pathway,
  creating an integration of nutrient metabolism (fatty acids, amino acids, and glucose)
  with cellular energy production (ADP to ATP). By providing an integrated view, Fig. 1
  serves as a foundational reference for understanding the complex interrelationships
  among these vital mitochondrial processes analyzed in this study, and how their
  disruption can interfere with surrounding processes. a and a1—two heme groups, Acn
