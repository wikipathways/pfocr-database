caption: 'Key anti-obesity strategies and pharmacological agents. Reduced energy intake
  can be achieved through A) appetite suppression: leptin secreted by adipocytes penetrates
  across BBB and binds to neurons in the hypothalamus. JAK-STAT signaling has been
  identified as a key pathway involved in activation of leptin receptor in the hypothalamus.
  Upon activation of leptin pathway, synthesis of agouti-related neuropeptide and
  neuropeptide Y is inhibited, resulting in appetite suppression and decrease in food
  intake; and B) decrease in fat absorption: large dietary fat breaks down and feeds
  pool of dissolved monoglycerides and fatty acids. Once uptake by absorptive intestinal
  cells, they are packaged into chylomicrons and released into the lymphatic system.
  EGCG has previously shown to suppress fat absorption with possible mechanisms including
  modified surface transport barriers and altered intraluminal digestion as well as
  intestinal production of lipoproteins. On the other hand, strategies to increase
  energy expenditure include C) exercise mimetics such as AMPK and PPAR agonists that
  increase energy expenditure by muscle cells, which in turn release myokines to regulate
  adipose tissues; D) stimulation of thermogenesis by brown adipocytes, which can
  be achieved through activation of β3-adrenal receptor (Adrb3) that relays sympathetic
  nerve signal to activate brown adipocytes, or activation of intracellular cAMP,
  a downstream mediator Adrb3 signaling; and E) white to brown fat conversion (termed
  “browning”). For example, activation of Notch signaling leads to the release of
  Notch intracellular domain (NICD) via γ-secretase-mediated proteolytic cleavage.
  NICD translocates to the nucleus where it binds RBPJ transcriptional complex to
  activate the transcription of HES and HEY family genes. HES directly binds to the
  promoter regions of PRDM16 and PGC1α to inhibit beige adipogenesis. Since the proteolytic
  cleavage of NICD is necessary for activation of Notch signaling, pharmacological
  blocking using a γ-secretase inhibitor DBZ inhibits Notch signaling transduction
  and promotes browning of white adipocytes. This figure was created using BioRender
