caption: Amino acid metabolism plays an important role in mediating functionality
  of the innate and adaptive immune systems. In macrophages, the amino acids glutamine
  and arginine are crucial for immune functions including cytokine and nitric oxide
  production. The fate of arginine in macrophages is a key distinction between inflammatory
  and tolerant cell phenotypes. Tryptophan metabolism by macrophages may suppress
  the activity of the adaptive immune system. In T cells, glutamine and arginine promote
  robust responses to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, including proliferation and
  cytokine production. Sufficient availability is necessary for proper mechanistic
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway signalling. Tryptophan has an important role
  in promoting T cell proliferation, and lack of availability may mediate failure
  to respond to infections or tumours. TCA, tricarboxylic acid; Treg, regulatory T.
