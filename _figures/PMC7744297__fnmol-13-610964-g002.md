caption: Schematic representation of the AChR clustering and dispersal pathways. Upon
  the release of agrin by the nerve terminal, agrin binds to LRP4 resulting in MuSK
  activation () and recruitment of DOK7 and Crk/CrkL () that further stimulates MuSK
  activation. The signal is propagated downstream, which results in the clustering
  of the AChRs by the cytoplasmic anchoring protein rapsyn. By contrast, ACh disperses
  AChR clusters not stabilized by agrin signaling. A cyclin-dependent kinase (CdK5)
  mechanism is thought to drive this pathway through the interaction of rapsyn and
  the calcium-dependent protease calpain (). Calpain activity promotes the cleavage
  of p35 to p25 (), an activator of CdK5. On the other hand, rapsyn behaves as a calpain
  suppressor, thus stabilizing AChR clusters. It is thought that on synaptogenic induction,
  new synthesized AChRs may be transported and delivered to the nascent postsynaptic
  sites for insertion, together with AChRs endocytosed from the spontaneous AChR clusters.
  Synapse specific transcription in subsynaptic nuclei by different transcription
  factors and specific promoter elements in synaptic genes such as GABP () and Erm
  () is also key to achieve a high concentration of AChRs in synaptic sites. VGNa+C,
  volgated-gated Na+ channel.
