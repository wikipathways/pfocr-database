caption: The classical MAP kinase pathway is activated in human tumors by several
  mechanisms including the binding of ligand to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
  mutational activation of an RTK, by loss of the tumor suppressor NF1, or by mutations
  in RAS, BRAF and MEK1. Phosphorylation and thus activation of ERK regulates transcription
  of target genes which promote cell cycle progression and tumor survival. The ERK
  pathway contains a classical feedback loop in which the expression of feedback elements
  such as SPRY and DUSP family proteins are regulated by the level of ERK activity.
  Loss of expression of SPRY and DUSP family members due to promoter methylation or
  deletion is thus permissive for persistently elevated pathway output. In the case
  of tumors with V600EBRAF expression, pathway output is enhanced by impaired upstream
  feedback regulation.
