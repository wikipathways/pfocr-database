caption: Schematic summary of the present study. Melatonin via PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition
  promotes GSK-3β dephosphorylation (i.e., activation) which probably phosphorylates
  the transcription factor MITF at serine 298, enhancing its transcriptional activity.
  MITF binds to tyrosinase, TRP-1 and TRP-2 promoters, leading to the increase in
  the expression of respective transcripts. Specific inhibitors of GSK-3β, like BIO
  and LiCl, block the effect of melatonin on the expression and activity of tyrosinase
  and on the synthesis of melanin. Melatonin also induces ROS generation that is involved
  in tyrosinase activity stimulation and melanin synthesis; the glycogen synthase
  kinase-3β inhibitor BIO and ROS scavengers like N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione
  (GSH) reduce ROS formation and melanogenesis induction. The PI3K specific inhibitor
  Ly294002 reproduces the effect of melatonin on GSK-3β activation and on tyrosinase
  activity and melanin production.
