caption: A greatly simplified model of the Dok-7/MuSK pathway for postsynaptic specialization
  of the mammalian NMJ. Dok-7 can activate MuSK and induce Rapsyn-dependent AChR clustering
  even in the absence of neural Agrin; however MuSK requires both Dok-7 and Agrin
  to form functional NMJs in vivo. Many of the molecular mechanisms underlying these
  signaling events have yet to be determined. AChR, acetylcholine receptor; PH, pleckstrin
  homology; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; Y, tyrosine residue in each SH2 target motif
  of Dok-7.
