caption: Drought responsive genes in plant hormone signal transduction pathway. (A)
  IAA signal transduction pathway; (B) ABA signal transduction pathway; (C) GA signal
  transduction pathway; (D) BR signal transduction pathway; (E) JA signal transduction
  pathway. Relative expression levels are normalized based on the Z-score and shown
  as a color gradient from low (blue) to high (red). The columns in heat map are 5,
  7, and 9 days of well-watered condition, and 5, 7 and 9 days of drought-treated
  condition under severe drought from left to right, respectively.
