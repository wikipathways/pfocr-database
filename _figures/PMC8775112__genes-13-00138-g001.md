caption: 'Wnt pathway. (a) Wnt pathway OFF: The Wnt pathway is inactive in the absence
  of Wnt ligands or by the effect of extracellular inhibitors that prevent the activation
  of the pathway. We can group the extracellular inhibitors into two categories depending
  on the action they perform: (i) binding to the Wnt ligands and preventing their
  binding to the membrane receptors, such as SFRP1–5 and WIF-1, and (ii) interfering
  with the LRP binding to FZD, such as DKK1 and sclerostin. Due to their mechanism
  of action, the first type of inhibitors can act on both canonical and non-canonical
  pathways, while the second type is specific to the canonical Wnt pathway. The inhibition
  performed by DKK1 and sclerostin is mediated or enhanced by receptors such as Kremen
  proteins and LRP4 [,]. When the canonical pathway is not activated, β-catenin is
  phosphorylated at three critical residues and sequestered in the cytoplasm by the
  destruction complex. The destruction complex is formed by scaffold proteins APC
  and AXIN1; Ser/Thr kinases, CK1α, ε and δ and GSK3β; and transcriptional regulators
  YAP/TAZ of the Hippo pathway []. This phosphorylated β-catenin is polyubiquitinated
  for its degradation in the proteasome by the complex containing, among others, β-TrCP
  protein. Thus, it is not available in the nucleus and, in its absence, a complex
  is formed by TCF/LEF and TLE/Groucho, inhibiting the transcription of target genes.
  (b) Wnt pathway ON: The binding of a Wnt ligand to FZD/LRP or ROR1/2/RYK/FZD activates
  the Wnt pathway that will result in a different transcriptional regulation. Canonical
  Wnt Pathway ON: The pathway begins at the cell surface with the formation of a heterotrimeric
  complex consisting of a Wnt ligand (19 different Wnts), a LRP transmembrane co-receptor
  (LRP5/6) and an FZD receptor (10 different FZDs). The formation of the LRP-FZD-Wnt
  complex results in phosphorylation of the LRP5/6 co-receptor by CK1α and GSK3β.
  Then, the DVL (also called DSH) polymerizes and is activated, inhibiting the destruction
  complex. This produces stabilization and accumulation in the cytoplasm of β-catenin,
  which will translocate to the nucleus. Once there, it displaces the TLE/Groucho
  repressors, forming an active complex with TCF/LEF proteins, which results in the
  recruitment of coactivators and activation of transcription of genes important for
  the differentiation and formation of bone, such as WISP1 and RUNX2 [,]. Non-canonical
  Wnt Pathway ON: (i) WNT/PCP: The WNT-PCP pathway begins with the binding of a Wnt
  ligand, such as WNT5A, to FZD and the co-receptors ROR1/2 or RYK. Then, DVL is recruited
  and activated, resulting in the activation of the scaffold protein VANGL. DVL forms
  a complex with DAMM1, which activates the small GTPases RHOA and RAC1, which in
  turn activate ROCK and JNK. This leads to rearrangements of the cytoskeleton and/or
  the induction of transcription through ATF2 and/or NFAT. The activation of the WNT5A-ROR1/2
  pathway inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling [,]. (ii) WNT/Ca2+: The binding of
  the ligand to an FZD receptor results in the recruitment and activation of DVL.
  Then, DVL binds to the small GTPases, which activate PLC. This activation leads
  to the breakage of PIP2 into DAG and IP3. When IP3 binds to its receptor on the
  endoplasmic reticulum, calcium release occurs. When the calcium concentration is
  increased, DAG activates PKC, which in turn can activate CDC42. Increased intracellular
  calcium can also activate calcineurin and CaMKII, which in turn can induce the activation
  of the NFAT transcription factor or NF-kB [,]. WNT signaling modulators: The binding
  of RSPO to LGR and to RNF43/ZNRF3 maintains the Wnt signal ON by preventing the
  polyubiquitination and endocytosis of FZD performed by RNF43/ZNF3 []. WNT production:
  Wnt precursors undergo post-translational modifications such as porcupine-mediated
  palmitoylation, other lipid modifications and glycosylation in the ER. Then, the
  transmembrane protein Wntless (Wls) transports the functional Wnt ligands to the
  plasma membrane via the golgi apparatus. Wnt ligands are secreted from the cell
  by solubilization, exosome formation or on lipid protein particles [,,]. See next
