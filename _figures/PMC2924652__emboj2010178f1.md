caption: Two-component and chemotaxis signalling in bacteria. (A) Schematic representation
  of the canonical two-component system. Sensory histidine kinase (HK) is composed
  of the input (blue) and the autokinase (red) domains; the kinase is typically a
  dimer. The response regulator (RR) consists of the receiver (purple) and output
  (green) domains. The phosphate group is transferred from the histidine residue on
  the kinase to the asparate residue on the response regulator, activating the output
  domain, which typically regulates gene expression. The response regulator can be
  dephosphorylated by the phosphatase activity of the kinase. (B) Molecular composition
  of the chemotaxis pathway in E. coli. Receptors sense and transmit signals to regulate
  the activity of the cytoplasmic histidine kinase CheA. Receptors form trimers of
  dimers, where different types of receptors (light or dark blue) are mixed. CheA
  binding and regulation by receptors are aided by CheW. CheA transfers phosphate
  group to CheY, the single-domain response regulator controlling flagellar motor,
  and to CheB, composed of the regulatory receiver domain and the output methylesterase
  domain. Receptors are methylated on glutamate residues by the methyltransferase
  CheR. CheY is dephosphorylated by the phosphatase CheZ. Receptors, CheW, CheA and
  CheZ form a stable signalling core, to which CheR, CheB and CheY dynamically localize.
