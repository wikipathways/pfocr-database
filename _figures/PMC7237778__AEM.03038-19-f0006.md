caption: Proposed metabolic changes caused by type 2 NADH dehydrogenase deficiency
  in P. taiwanensis VLB120. An increased NADH/NAD+ ratio (1) might result in substrate
  inhibition of the Nuo complex as well as ROS production (2), which is reported for
  this NADH dehydrogenase (, ). Rerouting of the flux through the TCA cycle into the
  glyoxylate shunt (3) reduces redox cofactor formation () and helps to scavenge reactive
  oxygen species by glyoxylate (, ). Limited ATP provision from oxidative phosphorylation
  can be mitigated by upregulation of the ADI pathway, based on our proteomics data
  (4) (, ). The light representation of the Ndh dehydrogenase indicates deficiency
  of both isozymes. ETC, electron transport chain; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ADI,
  arginine deiminase pathway; Nuo, type 1 NADH dehydrogenase; Ndh, type 2 NADH dehydrogenase;
