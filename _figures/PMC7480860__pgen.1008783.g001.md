caption: A) Co-cultures of P.a. wild type (WT) and mutants lacking phenazine biosynthesis
  operons (Δphz1 or Δphz2) were inoculated onto 72 h-old lawns of C.a. WT, adh1Δ/Δ
  and adh1Δ/Δ reconstituted with ADH1 (adh1Δ/ADH1). The red pigmentation indicates
  production of the phenazine 5-MPCA by P.a. B) Dual-seq allowed for parallel analyses
  of P.a. (green) and C.a. (red or pink) mRNA expression profiles from co-culture
  lawns to survey the effects of ethanol (green oval) and 5-MPCA (red oval) on gene
  expression. C) Principle component analysis (PCA) of TPM (transcripts per kilobase
  per million reads) from transcriptome profiles of P.a. grown alone (No C.a.), P.a.
  grown with C.a. WT, and P.a. grown with C.a. adh1Δ/Δ. D) PCA of gene expression
  profiles of C.a. WT and C.a. adh1Δ/Δ grown in mono-culture (No P.a.) or co-cultures
  with P.a. WT. E) Pathway analysis of DEGs from co-cultures of P.a. with C.a. WT
  compared to with C.a. adh1Δ/Δ. P.a. pathways were phenazine (PCN, 1-OH-P, 5-MCPA)
  biosynthesis and pyochelin (PCH) biosynthesis pathways. Inset shows increase in
  siderophore-derived fluorescence of co-cultures of P.a. with C.a. adh1Δ/Δ which
  is consistent with increased PCH production. C.a. pathways included amino acid metabolism,
  sulfur (S) metabolism, peroxisomal transport, fatty acid beta-oxidation, glycolysis,
  cation (e.g. Fe) import, base excision and mismatch DNA repair. Red arrows indicate
  higher expression in co-cultures with C.a. WT and blue arrows indicate higher expression
  in co-cultures with C.a. adh1Δ/Δ. P-values are from hypergeometric over-representation
  tests, FDR corrected.
