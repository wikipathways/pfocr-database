caption: The Glycerophospholipid metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism in liver.
  The mRNA expression of genes in red was up-regulated and the mRNA expression of
  genes in blue was down-regulated in eWAT, respectively; the lipid level in red was
  up-regulated and the lipid level in blue was down-regulated in eWAT, respectively.
