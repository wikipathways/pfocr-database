caption: 'CO causes the dissociation of the metabolism between remethylation cycle
  and transsulfuration pathway. Metabolomic analysis concerned with sulfur-containing
  amino acids was performed with CO-releasing molecule (CORM)-treated U937 cells.
  Metabolites were extracted at time 0 and 0.5 h after 100 µM CORM administration.
  Data represent the mean ± SD of samples from 4 independent experiments. Asterisks
  indicate statistically significant differences (unpaired Students’t test,). *: p<0.05;
  **: p<0.01. AdOX; oxidized adenosine, CBS; cystathionine β-synthase, SAH; S-adenosylmethionine,
  SAM; S-adenosylcysteine.'
