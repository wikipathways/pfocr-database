caption: Intestinal iron uptake and its distribution to the reticuloendothelial system.
  Dietary iron can be either in the form of heme or non-heme. DMT1 is a ferrous ion
  (Fe2+) transporter; hence, Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by apical membrane ferrireductases
  enzyme, Dcytb. IREG1 (Iron-regulated transporter-1) also known as Fpn is an iron
  exporter transporter to the circulation.
