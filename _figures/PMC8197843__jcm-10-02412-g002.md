caption: 'Production of energy in the mitochondria. (A) Physiological conditions.
  Mitochondria are formed from the permeable outer membrane, the intermembrane space,
  the selectively permeable inner membrane and the matrix. In the inner membrane,
  there are electron transport chain enzymes and ATP synthase. The tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle and β-oxidation enzymes are contained in the mitochondrion. The energy
  released during the oxidation of energy substrates is available inside the mitochondria
  in the form of reducing equivalents. The electron transport chain (ETC) (b) collects
  and transports the reducing equivalents, directing them to react with oxygen to
  form water. ETC is made up of four large protein complexes embedded in the inner
  mitochondrial membrane. The flow of electrons through the respiratory chain is driven
  by the redox potential difference and is mediated by three of the complexes (I,
  III, IV), substrates having a more positive potential than NAD+/NADH transfer electrons
  to complex III via complex II (instead of I). The flow of electrons through complexes
  I, III and IV causes the displacement of protons through the inner mitochondrial
  membrane—from the matrix to the intermembrane space. This allows the creation of
  a proton gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP. Proton-motive force (PMF), created
  by ions accumulating in the mesothelial space, is used by the ATP synthase (c) located
  in the inner mitochondrial membrane—it attaches a phosphate residue to adenosine
  diphosphate, creating ATP []. The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), which is continuously produced in the
  cytosol by the glycolytic pathway. The transfer of reducing equivalents from NADH
  across the inner mitochondrial membrane requires the presence of a pair of dehydrogenase-conjugated
  substrates on both sides of the membrane, a system known as a substrate shuttles.
  Two types of substrate shuttles are involved in the transfer of reducing equivalents
  across the inner mitochondrial membrane—the glycerophosphate shuttle and the malate-aspartate
  shuttle (a) []. (B) Sepsis. In the course of sepsis, the expression and activity
  of some electron transport chain (ETC) complexes (b) are reduced. This may reduce
  the efficiency of ETC, whose role is to generate a proton gradient that drives the
  synthesis of ATP (c). Loss of some copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which contains
  information on key subunits of the ECT complexes, has also been reported. In addition,
  sepsis can impair the operation of the substrate shuttle. Legend: gray color—insufficient
