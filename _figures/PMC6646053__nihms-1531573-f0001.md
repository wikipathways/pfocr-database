caption: Multiple different elements influence complement activation on a target surface.
  1) Antigen density will affect the clustering of bound IgG and IgM. Mobility of
  the antigen on the target surface may also affect clustering of the bound immunoglobulin.
  2) IgG and IgM can activate the classical pathway. Some subclasses of IgG are better
  activators than others. In general IgG3 > IgG1 > IgG2 >> IgG4. C1q binds efficiently
  to six clustered IgG molecules or to a single IgM that is complexed to antigen.
  3) Complement regulatory proteins on the target surface and in plasma control complement
  pathway activation by the immune complexes. Alternative pathway regulators, such
  as factor H, decrease amplification through the alternative pathway.
