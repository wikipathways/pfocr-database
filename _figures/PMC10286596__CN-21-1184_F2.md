caption: 'Overview of resveratrol-modulated mitochondrial biogenesis in neurodegenerative
  diseases. PGC-1α: resveratrol-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in neurodegenerative
  disorders can take place by either SIRT1/PGC-1α/NRF-1 or SIRT1/FoxO3a/PGC-1α pathways,
  where resveratrol activates PGC-1α in a SIRT1-dependent manner. NRF-2: resveratrol
  increases NRF-2 protein levels and promotes NRF-2 nuclear translocation. SIRTs:
  resveratrol-activated SIRT1 can protect neurons by reducing ROS accumulation, Aβ
  oligomer formation, and α-synuclein accumulation. In addition, resveratrol-activated
  SIRT1 restores mitochondrial function by increasing PGC-1α and TFAM expression.
  AMPK: in neurons, resveratrol-stimulated AMPK activity requires activation by either
  SIRT1 or the upstream activator LKB1. Moreover, the resveratrol-activated AMPK/mitophagy
  pathway alleviates mitochondrial network fragmentation and dysfunction. ERRα: resveratrol
  enhances mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing ERRα expression and activity. TERT:
  resveratrol-mediated activation of TERT depends on nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAMPT) activation, which activates SIRT4. TFAM: mitochondrial biogenesis-associated
  RES-elicited neuroprotection acts via the SIRT/PGC-1α signaling pathway, ultimately
  affecting TFAM acetylation rate. Dashed lines are for translocation.'
