caption: Comparison of the pathway of programmed cell death in C. elegans with the
  major one in vertebrates. The worm has a homologue of Bcl-2 (CED-9), of its BH3-only
  apoptosis inducers (EGL-1), of the caspase-activator Apaf-1 (CED-4) and of the proteolytic
  caspases (CED-3). However, a striking difference is that CED-9 directly binds and
  inhibits CED-4, until CED-4 is displaced by EGL-1, whereas vertebrate Bcl-2 does
  not bind to Apaf-1 but instead prevents the activation of its pro-apoptotic siblings
  Bax and Bak, thereby preventing their permeabilisation of the MOM and release of
  cytochrome c (cyt c), an essential cofactor for Apaf-1.
