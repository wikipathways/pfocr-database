caption: HN inhibits OS and ER stress in RPE by direct and indirect mechanisms. ER
  and mitochondria are linked through MAMs (mitochondria-associated membranes) which
  perform a variety of functions; some of which are listed in the figure. ER stress
  leads to CHOP induction via multiple signaling mechanisms. ER stress also activates
  procaspase 4 to active caspase 4 which in turn upregulates active caspase 3 leading
  to increased apoptosis. Exogenous HN's action on the suppression of ER stress-induced
  apoptosis via inhibition of caspase 4, CHOP, and caspase 3 are also shown in the
  figure. Exogenous HN is taken up by RPE and gains entry into mitochondria when cotreated
  with oxidant stressor. HN downregulates cellular OS and decreases mitochondrial
  ROS and augments mitochondrial GSH. The receptor-mediated pathway of HN preventing
  oxidant-induced apoptosis via activation of phosphorylated STAT3 is also shown.

  description: HN inhibits OS and ER stress in RPE by direct and indirect mechanisms.
    ER and mitochondria are linked through MAMs (mitochondria-associated membranes)
    which perform a variety of functions; some of which are listed in the figure.
    ER stress leads to CHOP induction via multiple signaling mechanisms. ER stress
    also activates procaspase 4 to active caspase 4 which in turn upregulates active
    caspase 3 leading to increased apoptosis. Exogenous HN's action on the suppression
    of ER stress-induced apoptosis via inhibition of caspase 4, CHOP, and caspase
    3 are also shown in the figure. Exogenous HN is taken up by RPE and gains entry
    into mitochondria when cotreated with oxidant stressor. HN downregulates cellular
    OS and decreases mitochondrial ROS and augments mitochondrial GSH. The receptor-mediated
    pathway of HN preventing oxidant-induced apoptosis via activation of phosphorylated
    STAT3 is also shown.
