caption: TOR signalling pathway governs key processes that strikingly affect fungal
  pathogenesis. Components of the TOR pathway in Botrytis cinerea (a), Fusarium graminearum
  (b), Fusarium oxysporum (c), Magnaporthe oryzae (d), Phytophthora infestans (e),
  Verticillium dahliae (f), and other representative plant‐pathogenic fungi (g) are
  shown. ABL1, carbon‐responsive gene; AreA, global nitrogen regulator; ASD4, the
  GATA transcription factor‐encoding gene; CAK1, protein kinase; cAMP, monobutyryl
  cyclic AMP; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; FKBP12, FK506 binding protein 12; GAP1,
  amino acid permease; IMP1, vacuolar protein required for membrane trafficking; LST8,
  lethal with SEC. 13 protein 8; MAC1, the adenylate cyclase; MeaB, bZIP protein;
  MGV1, mitogen‐activated protein kinase gene 1; MKK1, mitogen‐activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) kinase; MSG5, phosphatase similar to yeast Msg5; NEM, protein phosphatase;
  NUT1, a major nitrogen regulatory gene; PAH, phosphatidate phosphatase; PKA, protein
  kinase A; PMP1, a tyrosine‐protein phosphatase; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PPE1,
  homologue to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sit4/Ppe1; PR1, pathogenesis‐related protein
  1; R. solanacearum, Ralstonia solanacearum; RAP, rapamycin; RAPTOR, regulatory‐associated
  protein of mTOR; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RRD, resistance to rapamycin deletion
  2; SIT4, PP2A phosphatase; SNF1, sucrose non‐fermenting 1; SNT2, named for the presence
  of the DNA‐binding domain SaNT; STRIPAK, striatin‐interacting phosphatases and kinases;
  TAP42, Tor associated protein 42; TIP41, Tap42‐interacting protein 41; TOR, target
  of rapamycin; VAST, VASt domain‐containing protein; WHI2, a homologue of S. cerevisiae
