caption: Schematic diagram of PARP activation in inflammatory signaling. Experiments
  in cultured microglia and astrocytes indicate that binding of TNFα to its receptor,
  TNFR1, leads to calcium influx and activation of phosphatidylcholine (PC)-specific
  phospholipase C (PC-PLC), resulting in formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and downstream
  action of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway. ERK2 phosphorylation of PARP-1 increases PARP-1
  activity, which then facilitates activation of NF-κB transcription. One possible
  mechanism whereby PARP-1 facilitates NF-κB transcription is by depleting NAD+, which
  is also used as a substrate by sirtuin-1. Sirtuin-1 normally keeps the P65 subunit
  of NF-κB deacetylated, but a decrease in sirtuin-1 activity will result in acetylated
  P65, which enables NF-κB transcription. [Adapted, with permission, from Vuong et
