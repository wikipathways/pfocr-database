caption: The mechanisms underlying enhanced immunotherapy efficacy through exercise.
  (A) The antitumor effects of exercise depend on IL-15 signaling pathway, thus enhancing
  the sensitivity of pancreatic tumor cells to immunotherapy. (B) Exercise increases
  the infiltration of CD8+ T cells through the CXCL9 or CXCL11/CXCR3 signaling pathway.
  (C) Exercise influences multiple transcriptional pathways, including promotion of
  vascular branching and normal vasoconstriction, which improves hypoxia in TME and
  enhances the efficiency of drug transport. Meanwhile, hypoxia-related transcription
  pathways are also inhibited, thereby reducing anaerobic glycolysis. (D) Exercise
  inhibited the expression of SQLE in lipid metabolism and reversed the TME. Simultaneously,
  a negative correlation was observed between the expression of SQLE and the immunotherapy
  efficacy. M1, M1 macrophage; TIME, tumor immune microenvironment; CTLA-4, cytotoxic
  T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4
