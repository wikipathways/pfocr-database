caption: 'The three main signal transduction pathways associated with GPR120/FFAR4
  stimulation: —ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS via beta-arrestin 2 (ARRβ2) signaling in
  immune pro-inflammatory cells. After receptor stimulation, the adapter protein ARRβ2
  is recruited, which, after forming a complex with GPR120, leads to the desensitization
  of GPR120 as well as other receptors [e.g., Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), interleukin
  1 receptor (IL1R), and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)] to pro-inflammatory
  stimuli. The GPR120- ARRβ2 complex internalizes and interacts with TGF-β-activated
  kinase 1 (MAP3K7)-binding protein 1 (TAB1) and NLRP3 [nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain (NOD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing protein (NLR) family member 3]
  inflammasome, which leads to the inhibition of the subsequent inflammatory cascade.
  Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-кB) essential
  modulator (NEMO) ubiquitination, which is crucial for the activation of the canonical
  NF-κB signaling pathway, does not occur. A decrease in the concentration of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines indirectly modulates adipose tissue cell functions by reducing insulin
  resistance and, consequently, stimulating glucose uptake [82,94,95,96,97,98]. —METABOLIC
  EFFECTS via classical Gα q/11 signaling. In this pathway, omega-3-fatty acids (Ω-3
  FAs), acting as a ligand and agonist of GPR120, activate the Gαq/11-linked phospholipase
  C-beta (PLCβ). After PLCβ activation, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  hydrolyzes into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which
  serve as second messengers. IP3 binds to receptors, the conformational changes of
  which, after activation, lead to the mobilization of calcium ions (Ca2+) from intracellular
  stores. The following cytosolic Ca2+ influx stimulates the release of both cholecystokinin
  (CCK) and incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric
  inhibitory polypeptide (GIP, also known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide).
  Incretin hormones support the survival and proliferation of pancreatic β-cells,
  which translates into increased insulin secretion. Moreover, the increase in Ca2+
  concentration activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway including Akt,
  which stimulates downstream anabolic signaling, favoring cell growth (adipogenesis),
  proliferation, (angiogenesis), and survival. Upregulated glucose transporter type
  4 (GLUT4) activity promotes increased glucose uptake, whereas augmented vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression induced by NF-кB enhances angiogenesis.
  Increased DAG synthesis activates protein kinase C (PKC), which results in the further
  activation of various intracellular signal transduction systems, including extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2). ERK1/2 has anti-apoptotic effects
  promoting cell growth and survival and indirectly reduces ghrelin activity by inhibiting
  proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), an enzyme necessary for the cleavage of pro-ghrelin
  into mature ghrelin in the Golgi apparatus [91,92,93,96,99,100,101,102,103,104].
  —METABOLIC EFFECTS via Gα i/o signaling. Gαi/o affects related signaling pathways
  through the inhibition of adenylate cyclase (AC) activity, influencing intracellular
  cyclic adenosine 3,5-monophosphate (cAMP) levels in ghrelin-producing cells with
  a subsequent decrease in ghrelin synthesis. In this mechanism, the inhibitory effect
  of ghrelin on insulin secretion in pancreatic islet β-cells is reduced [99,105].
  a PC1/3 is synthesized and expressed in a variety of tissues such as the neuroendocrine
  cells in the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, the enteroendocrine
  cells (gut), and in β cells of the pancreas. b CCK is produced in the intestinal
  epithelial endocrine I-cells of the small intestine (mainly in the duodenum) and
  various neurons in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system (CNS).
  c GLP-1 and GIP are produced in the intestinal epithelial endocrine L cells and
  K cells, respectively. Since 2003, when Fredriksson et al. discovered the GPR120/FFAR4
  protein [43,106], interest in this receptor has consistently increased as further
  reports of the anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects of its agonists have appeared
