caption: The microbial synthesis of butyrate in the colonic lumen. First, dietary
  fibers (carbohydrates) are broken down to monosaccharides and, subsequently, phosphoenolpyruvate
  through the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway. Thereafter, acetyl‐CoA is produced via
  pyruvate, which eventually gets converted to butyryl‐CoA. Butyryl‐CoA can be converted
  to butyrate through two pathways. The most common one uses acetate as a cosubstrate
  to generate butyrate and an acetyl‐CoA molecule and the other, less common, pathway,
  produces butyrate via butyrate‐phosphate. Both pathways are regulated by different
  enzymes (indicated in red in the figure). Created with BioRender.com
