caption: Model of the Nodal signaling pathway during establishment of the LR asymmetry
  in amphioxus. Dashed lines mark proposed interactions based on the data from other
  chordates. Gray text denotes inhibition of expression of the respective factors.
  During neurulation, Nodal and its co-ligand Gdf1/3 are expressed symmetrically.
  However, right-sided inhibition of Nodal by Cerberus results in propagation of the
  pathway on the left side, where Nodal activates expression of Nodal, Gdf1/3, Lefty,
  and Pitx and inhibits expression of Cerberus. We propose that during the course
  of later development, Pitx interacts with organ-specific factors and promotes left-side
  specific morphogenesis. Anteriorly, Pitx is proposed to interact with Pit1 and to
  activate expression of Lhx3 to promote differentiation of cell types within the
  preoral pit. Slightly more posterior, Pitx is proposed to regulate expression of
  Dkk1/2/4, which inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and thus promotes fusion of ectoderm
  and endoderm epithelia during morphogenesis of the mouth opening. The mechanism
  underlying activation of expression of factors responsible for right-sided morphogenesis
  is currently unknown. csg, club-shaped gland; en, endostyle; fgs, first gill slit;
