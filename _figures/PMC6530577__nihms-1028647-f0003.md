caption: The saturated free fatty acid palmitate, and other toxic lipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine
  (LPC) are known to activate the three UPR sensors. IRE1α, via phosphorylation and
  activation of the stress kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) targets the insulin
  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) for inhibitory phosphorylation leading to insulin resistance.
  IRE1α-dependent RNA degradation (RIDD) negatively regulates hepatic steatosis via
  degradation of lipogenic mRNAs and regulatory microRNA. IRE1α s-nitrosylation inhibits
  its endoribonuclease activity with a resultant decrease in XBP1 splicing and an
  increase in microRNAs that are degraded via RIDD. The PERK pathway is implicated
  in the regulation of hepatic steatosis; CHOP mediates palmitate-induced hepatocyte
  apoptosis, though its in vivo role in NASH is less clear. ATF6α is activated in
  NASH; however, its contribution is not well defined. Lipid perturbation-induced
  UPR activation activates a subset of genes distinct from misfolded protein-induced
  UPR; however, the specific ATF4 and XBP1 induced lipotoxic target genes have not
  been defined. CHOP, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; NASH, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; PERK, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic
  reticulum kinase; UPR, unfolded protein response.
