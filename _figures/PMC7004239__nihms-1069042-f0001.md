caption: 'Redkal et al. identify a novel pathway for microbial metabolism of L-dopa.
  Left: Tyrosine decarboxylases (tyrDC) from E. faecalis convert L-dopa to dopamine,
  which can subsequently be metabolized to m-tyramine by dopamine dehydroxylases (Dadh)
  from E. lenta. Right: Inhibition of E. faecalis tyrDC by (S)-a-Fluoromethyltyrosine
  (AFMT) leads to increased bioavailability of L-dopa, which has the potential to
  be absorbed into the bloodstream and cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) into the
  brain to protect against motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.'
