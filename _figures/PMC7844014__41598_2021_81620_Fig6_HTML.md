caption: Network of interactions significantly enriched for genes displaying altered
  methylation patterns following treatment with valeric acid. This network was identified
  by the IPA as being the most significantly associated with the set of input genes
  and molecules within this network have functional relevance in “RNA post-transcriptional
  modification, Cancer, and Developmental disorder” (p = 10E−59). Of the 27 genes
  present in the network, 26 were significantly hypermethylated are shaded in green,
  while only 1 was hypomethylated are shaded in red. Each interaction is supported
  by at least one literature reference identified in the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge
  Base, with solid lines representing direct interactions, and dashed lines representing
  indirect interactions.
