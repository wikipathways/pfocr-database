caption: siRNA-mediated knockdown of Syndecan-1 expression results in decreased expression
  of IL-6, the IL-6R and the chemokine CCL20, possibly due to reduced activation of
  NFkB. Reduced expression of components of the IL-6 signaling pathway results in
  decreased constitutive activation of STAT3 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Low expression of
  the Wnt-coreceptor LRP-6 in Syndecan-1-deficient cells may reduce responsiveness
  to Wnt signaling. The attenuation of mutiple stemness-related signaling events results
  in a reduction of the SP and ALDH-activity, two surrogate parameters of stem cell
  activity. The reduction of the CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) phenotype may have implications
  for novel Syndecan-1-centered therapeutic approaches of basal-like breast cancer.
