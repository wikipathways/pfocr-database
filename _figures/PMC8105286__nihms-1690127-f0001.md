caption: 'The main players in the Notch signaling pathway. Main figure – schematic
  of the main players in the sender and receiver cells. The interaction domains within
  the Notch receptors and Notch ligands is highlighted. Inset – schematic of the activation
  complex in the nucleus. The schematic is drawn approximately to scale (see scale
  bar) partially based on current structural knowledge. Some structural aspects are
  hypothesized (including the extended conformation of the receptors and ligands).
  DSL: Delta, Serrate, Lag2. NRR: Negative regulatory region.'
