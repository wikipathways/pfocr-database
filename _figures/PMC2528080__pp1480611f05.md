caption: 'SERK genes are involved in several independent pathways. Model of pathways
  involving the five SERK genes (SERK1–SERK5) containing five LRRs (stripes) and one
  SPP (red square) domain as defined by . Shown are: BR pathway involving BRI1, SERK1,
  and SERK3 (; ; ); FLS2 pathway involving SERK3 essential to innate immunity ();
  pathway involving likely EMS1/EXS (; ), TPD1 (), and SERK1 and SERK2 mediating male
  sporogenesis (; ; C. Albrecht and S.C. de Vries, unpublished data); and pathway
  involving SERK3, SERK4, and probably an unidentified RLK leading to cell death control
  (; ; ). [See online article for color version of this figure.]'
