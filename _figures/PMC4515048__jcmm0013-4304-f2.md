caption: Schematic model of the pathway leading to hypercapnia-induced activation
  of L-type Ca2+ channels in carotid neurons. Elevated CO2 levels are converted by
  CA to protons and HCO3−. The carbonate directly activates the expression of sAC,
  which converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). The cAMP activates PKA, which is believed
  to activate the L-type Ca2+ channels leading to Ca2+ entry into cells. This model
  is based on a model proposed in [].
