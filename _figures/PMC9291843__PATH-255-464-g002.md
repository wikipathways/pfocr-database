caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed model of the MMR/ethanol/acetaldehyde gene–environment
  interactions in both MMR‐proficient (upper panel) and MMR‐deficient (lower panel)
  colonic epithelial cells. Upon ethanol/acetaldehyde exposure, in some colonic epithelial
  stem cells there is DNA base damage that normally would be recognised and repaired
  by the MMR system, or if unrepaired this base damage may induce replication errors,
  such as base mismatches or insertion/deletion loops (InDels), during S‐phase of
  the cell cycle. Here, the MMR‐proficient cell is able to activate DNA mismatch repair
  of the (MMR‐recognised) base damage, bringing about either cell cycle arrest in
  the context of mild DNA damage to allow DNA repair or cell death by apoptosis for
  more severe DNA damage. By contrast, the MMR‐deficient cell (dMMR due to mutant
  Msh2) is unable to activate the MMR signalling pathway and so there is neither cell
  cycle arrest nor apoptosis, resulting in aberrant survival of DNA‐damaged cells
  that can undergo ethanol‐induced subsequent proliferation. The proliferating dMMR
  stem cells populate the colonic crypt and expand further to form dMMR crypt foci.
  Stimulated by ethanol to undergo increased proliferation, these cells form hyperproliferative
  crypts whilst remaining subject to ongoing DNA damage from continued exposure to
  ethanol/acetaldehyde. These dMMR cells can accumulate mutations reflecting dMMR
  genomic instability and are consequently at increased risk of tumour formation,
  thus explaining the acceleration of colonic adenoma formation and increased probability
  of evolution to adenocarcinoma.
