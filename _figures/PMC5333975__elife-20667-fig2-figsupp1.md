caption: 'This cycle contains a direct input reaction (rpi, dashed line) allowing
  the cycle to operate with broader sets of kinetic parameters than cycles missing
  this feature. A knockout strain where rpi is eliminated, does not grow under ribose
  despite having the theoretical ability to do so.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20667.005'

  force low substrate saturation at flux branch points.
