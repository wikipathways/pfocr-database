caption: Feedback mechanism of neurovascular coupling controls vasodilation of cerebral
  blood vessels through neuronal and glial metabolism. Glucose and oxygen (O2) demand
  during neuronal activation generates signaling molecules such as CO2, nitric oxide
  (NO) and increased extracellular K+ which dilate cerebral blood vessels. Glucose
  and oxygen (O2) demand during glial activation due to glutamate transmitter uptake
  lead to increased extracellular Na+. Increased anaerobic metabolism in glia also
  lead to higher extracellular lactate. Increased extracellular acidification, combined
  with higher intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+, dilate cerebral blood vessels.
  Feedforward mechanism of neurovascular coupling controls vasodilation of cerebral
  blood vessels through neurotransmitter signaling. During neuronal activity activation
  of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) lead to increased intracellular Ca2+
  levels. This leads to activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and phospholipase
  A2pathway to produce arachidonic acid (AA) and prostaglandins (PG) which lead to
  vasodilation of cerebral blood vessels. Glial activation by metabotropic glutamate
  receptors (mGLURs) increase Ca2+ concentration in the end feet of astrocytes lining
  blood vessels. Increased end feet Ca2+ activates phospholipase A2pathway to produce
  AA, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) via P450 epoxygenase and PG, which dilate blood
  vessels. Additionally increased end feet Ca2+ in astrocytes can activate Ca2+ gated
  K+ channels; gk(Ca), releasing K+ which dilates blood vessels. The feedback and
  feedforward mechanisms are unified by intracellular Ca2+ signals and the mitochondrial
  Ca2+ uptake process.
