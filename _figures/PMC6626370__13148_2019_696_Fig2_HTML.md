caption: Convergent inflammatory signaling through NF-κB potentiates BRD4-dependent
  transcription of VI mediators, a result suppressed by apabetalone. a MCP-1, LPS,
  IL-1β, and TNFα all signal through NF-κB. The stimulants MCP-1, LPS, IL-1β, and
  TNFα activate their cognate receptors CCR2, TLR, IL-1R, and TNFR respectively. The
  receptors translate the signal through AKT, MYD88 and TRADD, phosphorylating NF-κB
  (yellow “p” circles) and releasing RelA-p50 subunits from IκBα. RelA translocates
  to the nucleus where it binds to consensus DNA binding sequences and is acetylated
  at K310 by p300 (black “a” circles). BRD4 recognizes and binds to these acetylation
  marks, recruiting pTEFb to activate RNA Pol II to drive inflammatory gene expression
  (cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules). b Apabetalone (green 7-point star)
  competitively inhibits BRD4 BD2 interactions with acetylated lysine marks on RelA.
  This prevents pTEFb recruitment and Pol II activation, inhibiting the transcription
  of VI mediators and components of the NF-κB pathway. Green boxes and red arrows
  indicate genes in the illustration whose expression is reduced by apabetalone
