caption: Context-dependent effect of PI3K signaling on Treg development, differentiation
  and maintenance. (A) During thymic development, attenuation of PI3K signaling may
  be required to enhance the translocation of Foxo proteins to the nucleus where they
  enhance the expression of Foxp3. (B) The capacity of PI3K signaling to antagonize
  is illustrated during the in vitro differentiation of Foxp3− CD4+ T cells to Foxp3+
  T cells where signal attenuation after 18 h facilitates Foxo nuclear translocation.
  It is worth noting that earlier inhibition may interfere with TCR-dependent signals
  that favor Foxp3 expression. (C) Hyperactivation of Akt (e.g. by expression of a
  membrane targeted Akt transgene) leads to Foxo nuclear exclusion and reduced Foxp3
  expression. Whether such extent of Akt activation can be achieved by physiological
  receptor activation has yet to be determined. (D) Treg numbers in the periphery
  is controlled by both TCR and IL-2 signals. Inhibition of PI3K is likely to reduce
  the ability of these receptors to maintain Treg homeostasis, thus explaining the
  reduced number of Treg in p110δ-deficient mice. (E) Enhanced numbers of Treg are
  found upon deletion of Pten or Ship in T cells in which PI3K signaling is enhanced,
  probably reflecting enhanced IL-2-dependent homeostatic expansion.
