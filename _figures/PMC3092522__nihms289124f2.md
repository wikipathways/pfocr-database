caption: (A) Lapatinib is a dual EGF receptor (EGFR)/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor
  approved for use in trastuzumab-refractory patients. Neratinib is an irreversible
  tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR/HER2. (B) Pertuzumab, a monoclonal antibody to
  HER2, binds to HER2 at a distinct epitope from where trastuzumab binds and prevents
  ligand-induced heterodimerization with HER3. Dysregulated activation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR
  pathway can mediate trastuzumab resistance, and molecular therapies aimed at directly
  inhibiting PI3K, AKT and mTOR are therefore in development. (C) HSP90 inhibitors
  promote HER2 degradation by blocking the activity of HSP90, a chaperone protein
  that protects HER2 from proteasomal degradation. (D) TDM-1, the antibody–drug conjugate
  of trastuzumab and maytansine, allows for delivery of a potent microtubule inhibitor
  selectively into HER2-overexpressing cells.
