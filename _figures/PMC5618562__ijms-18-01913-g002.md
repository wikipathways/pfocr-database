caption: Interplay between G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) signaling regulated
  by melatonin and GPCR signaling regulating YAP/TAZ. MT1 binding by melatonin (MLT)
  induces activation of associated Gαq and Gαs that leads to the accumulation of intracellular
  cAMP that in turn activates Protein Kinase A (PKA) and PKC. These in turn inhibit
  NF-κB transcriptional activity on its target promoters, including TAZ promoter.
  In Androgen Receptor (AR) positive cells, PKA and PKC inhibit the androgen response
  on AR responsive genes. In parallel, glucagon, epinephrine, and dobutamine signal
  through Gαs, inducing increased intracellular cAMP and activation of PKA. This in
  turn inhibits the RhoGTPase RhoA and activates LATS1/2 kinases, resulting in phosphorylation
  of YAP/TAZ, their cytoplasmic sequestration by 14-3-3 protein, their degradation
  mediated by βTrCP, and the impairment of their nuclear activity on pro-proliferative,
  pro-metastatic, and anti-apoptotic genes. ↑ indicates an increase in protein levels
  or activity; ↓ indicates a decrease in protein levels or activity.
