caption: 'Potential explanation for the role of uric acid in the development of SOS
  in the inflammatory setting. High levels of uric acid activate the RAGE/HMGB1 signaling
  pathway in sinusoidal endothelial cells and increase NF-κB expression. NF-κB overexpression
  increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e. TNF-α and IL-6, from
  damaged sinusoidal endothelial cells, resulting in cytokine derangement within the
  hepatic sinusoids leading to immune activation. HMGB1 also increases the expression
  of adhesion molecules (VCAM and ICAM) and PAI-1, resulting in the activation of
  the pro-coagulant cascade and sinusoidal obstruction [,27].SOS: Sinusoidal obstruction
  syndrome; RAGE: receptor for advanced glycation end products; HMGB1: high mobility

  cell adhesion protein; PAI-1: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.'
