caption: Metabolic reprogramming and macrophage polarization. Consistent with their
  diverse function and energy demands, macrophages adapt their metabolic programming
  in response to inflammation, injury, repair and fibrosis in CKD. Glycolysis is increased
  in activated macrophages with an increase in pyruvate production. In M1 macrophages
  (left side), most pyruvate is not converted to acetyl-CoA due to the blockage of
  the TCA cycle; rather, there is flux into the pentose phosphate pathway, generating
  NADPH, nucleotides and amino acids. Accumulation of citrate drives fatty acid synthesis;
  the accumulation of succinate leads to induction of HIF-1α, promoting expression
  of inflammatory and glycolytic genes; reverse electron transfer, along with increased
  NADPH, and HIF-1α, results in ROS overproduction, and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes.
  In M2 macrophages (right side), pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA and enters
  the intact TCA cycle, leading to sustained ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation
  and up-regulation of genes associated with tissue repair; increased levels of fatty
  acids enter the TCA cycle leading to an increase in β-oxidation and energy production
  and a decrease in ROS production due to forward electron transfer. In M2 macrophages,
  arginase-1 drives the production of polyamines and ornithine in contrast to conversion
  into citrulline and NO in M1 macrophages. F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
