caption: Biological processes regulated by ACY-1215. (A) Acetylate tubulin and increase
  microtubule stability. (B) Acetylate GRP78, inhibit misfolded or unfolded protein
  in the aggregate pathway and inhibit protein degradation. (C) Acetylate HSP90 and
  reduce polyubiquitinated protein transportation. (D) Reduce tau hyperphosphorylation
  and promote clearance. (E) Reduce F-actin depended cell migration by deacetylating
  cortactin.
