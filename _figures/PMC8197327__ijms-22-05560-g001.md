caption: Major routes driving the influence of adipose tissue on tumor progression.
  Adipose tissue can release adipokines which play important roles in normally altered
  pathways in cancer. The stromal cell derived factor 1 (CXCL12) through direct interaction
  with the chemokine receptor CXC type 4 (CXCR4) present in the membrane of tumor
  cells activates the JAK2/STAT3 signaling cascade, that ultimately has the function
  of translocation from STAT3 to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor
  for genes involved in cell survival, or migration and invasion, thus promoting EMT.
  Leptin, another of the main adipokines in adipose tissue, acts by interaction with
  its membrane receptor (OB-R). This receptor is associated with the JAK2 protein,
  which in turn phosphorylates STAT3, triggering the activation of survival pathways.
  Likewise, its interaction with the serine/threonine kinase RAF protein, and the
  GTPase RAS induce the activation of the MAPK pathway, promoting cell growth and
  survival. This hormone is also important in the regulation of apoptosis since via
  PI3K/AKT can modulate the levels of the BCL-2 and BAX proteins, inhibiting apoptosis
  of tumor cells and thus favoring both proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy.
  In an inflammatory environment, it is common for the adipose tissue and its microenvironment
  immune cells to release different interleukins such as IL-6 or IL-1, which by binding
  to their membrane receptors (IL-6R and IL-1R) are capable to activate the survival
  pathways mentioned above. IL-1, can also promote proliferation and survival by activating
  NFκB-mediated signaling. Finally, adipose tissue can contribute indirectly to the
  spread of tumor cells through the remodeling of the extracellular matrix mediated
  by collagenases (CLG) and metalloproteinases (MMPs) which, in conjunction with EMT,
  favors the migration of cells out of the primary niche and their dissemination.
