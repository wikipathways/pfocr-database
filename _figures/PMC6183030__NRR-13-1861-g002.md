caption: 'Glycolysis and other metabolic pathways in Müller Glia.The glycolytic pathway
  is characterized by ten enzyme catalyzed reactions. Enzymes are listed in the table
  corresponding to the numbers above each arrow. In addition to glycolysis, glycolytic
  intermediates are also shuttled to parallel energy pathways including the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBSP) and the de novo serine synthesis pathway (DNSS). Simplified
  diagram of DNSS and HBSP are shown highlighting relevant reactions, products, and
  enzymes to retinal metabolism. The HBSP converts fructose-6 phosphate and glutamine
  to glucosamine-6 phosphate and glutamate via the non-glycolytic enzyme GFAT. The
  de novo serine synthesis pathway consists of 3 enzyme catalyzed steps through which
  Müller glia convert 3-phosphoglycerate to serine, which can then be provided to
  retinal neurons. GFAT: Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase; OGT: β-linked
  N-acetylglucosamine transferase.'
