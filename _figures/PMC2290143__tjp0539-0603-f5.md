caption: The on-centre receptive field of AII amacrine cells is produced via the rods
  → rod bipolar cell (RB) → AII amacrine cell pathway. Illumination of the periphery
  of the AII cell receptive field results in a characteristic off-surround response.
  There are two possible circuits underlying the surround response. In the first,
  peripheral signals are carried to the inner retina by the rods →rod bipolar cell
  → S1-S2 amacrine cell route. In turn, these peripherally generated signals are carried
  centrally, providing direct GABAergic feedback to rod bipolar cell axon terminals
  (large circle). Alternatively, an unidentified amacrine cell (?) may provide surround
  inhibition via direct feedforward inhibitory inputs onto AII amacrine cell dendrites
  (small circle). Open arrowheads, sign-conserving excitatory synapses; filled arrowheads,
  converting sign-inverting inhibitory synapses; AII, AII amacrine cell; S1-S2, S1-S2
  amacrine cells; OPL, outer plexiform layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; IPL, inner
  plexiform layer.
