caption: Pain transmission starts with a noxious stimulus in the peripheral tissue,
  which is detected by various types of nociceptive receptors, such as TRPV for heat
  perception and TRPA for cold sensation. T-type calcium channels, voltage-gated sodium
  channels (Navs), and voltage-gated potassium channels (Kvs) participate in nociceptive
  neural transmission. The nociceptive information travels through the primary afferent
  neurons to the dorsal horn neurons, where presynaptic N-type and T-type calcium
  channels participate in neurotransmitter release, and the postsynaptic glutamate
  receptors AMPA and NMDA transmit pain sensation through the spinothalamic tract
  to the thalamus and the somatosensory cortex. Neuropathic pain can appear as a direct
  or indirect nerve damage, lesion, or disease that affects the somatosensory nervous
  system (periphery and/or central part). The pain sensation can appear as a response
  to noxious or non-noxious stimuli. The molecular mechanism involves a hyperexcitation
  of the somatosensory neurons through ionic channel dysfunction expressed in the
  neurons. The hydrogen sulfide (H2S) modulator in the pathway can interact with various
  ion channels, where the H2S/T-type calcium channel pathway represents an important
  pharmacological target.
