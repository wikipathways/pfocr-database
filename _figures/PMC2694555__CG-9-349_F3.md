caption: Response to pathway inhibitors of tumor cells depends on the mechanism of
  pathway activation. (a) Tumor cells with EGFR mutation are sensitive to EGFR inhibitor
  gefitinib or erlotinib, whereas those with RAS mutation are resistant to the same
  drug, because RAF-MEK-ERK signaling is not inhibited by the drugs. (b) When the
  PI3K pathway is hyperactivated by PI3K mutation or by PTEN loss, tumor cells are
  sensitive to rapamycin, which inhibits mTOR downstream of the pathway. However,
  the HER2 inhibitor Herceptin cannot stop the deregulated signal, because it does
  not inhibit hyperactivation downstream.
