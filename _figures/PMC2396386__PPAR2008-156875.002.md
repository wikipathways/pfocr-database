caption: Effector pathways for PPARγ in NSCLC. PPARγ can increase either expression
  of enzymatic activity of PTEN. This results in inhibition of Akt activation (pAkt),
  which may be involved in the growth inhibitory responses seen with PPARγ activation.
  Decreased Akt activity also can lead to decreased activity of the transcription
  factor NF-κB. NF-κB is a critical transcription factor in the production of proangiogenic
  and proinflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, IL-8. Decreased production of these
  factors would be expected to inhibit recruitment of inflammatory cells such as macrophages,
  and block tumor angiogenesis. PPARγ-mediated suppression of members of the Snail
  family of transcription factors, such as Snail, Zeb, or Twist, would lead to derepression
  of E-cadherin expression and promote the epithelial phenotype, leading to decreased
  migration and invasiveness.  PPARγ-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression in NSCLC
  has been shown by several investigators. This would result in decreased PGE2 production,
  which will impact growth. TZDs can inhibit PGE2 production through a PPARγ-independent
  pathway involving induction of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH). Pathways
  indicated in green are increased or activated by PPAR, while those in red represent
  pathways that are inhibited or repressed.
