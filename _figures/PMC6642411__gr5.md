caption: LAIR1 signalling pathway in malaria.The LAIR1 pathway is activated by attachment
  of collagen and collagenous ligands (C1q) to LAIR1 extracellular surface. This results
  in phosphorylation of intracellular LAIR1 ITIM tyrosine residues by Src family kinases.
  Phosphorylated ITIMs serve as docking sites for recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases.
  SHP-1 and SHP-2 become localized to phosphorylated ITIMs through their regulatory
  SH2 domains, subsequently inducing their phosphatase activity. Activated SHP-1 has
  been shown to block activation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor nuclear
  factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) through de-phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa-beta
  kinase complex (IKK). SHP-1 phosphatase activity also inhibits activation and translocation
  of IRFs from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by preventing TANK-binding kinase 1 (TANK-1)
  phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). These events subsequently
  block transcription of inflammatory mediator encoding genes with response elements
  for IRFs and NF-κB. SHP-2 inhibits activation of IRF 8 and blocks expression of
  phagocyte NADPH oxidase (gp91PHOX). LAIR1 inhibitory signalling is regulated by
  soluble LAIR1 and LAIR2 (soluble homolog of LAIR1) through competition for collagenous
  ligands. Children with SMA had increased circulating levels of sLAIR1 and sLAIR2
  indicative of enhanced receptor shedding. C1q was reduced in children with SMA,
  thereby, limiting ligand availability. Phagocytosis of PfHz antagonizes LAIR1 signalling
  through down-regulation of LAIR1 ITIM and SHP-1 phosphorylation, but does not alter
  SHP-2 phosphorylation. Leukocytic ingestion of PfHz also decreases LAIR1 transcripts
  and protein. These events result in NF-κB activation and the consequent production
  of pro-inflammatory mediators that enhance the pathogenesis of SMA. Red arrows represent
  ligand-receptor interaction, black solid arrows represent activation, and dashed
  black arrows represent blockade. (For interpretation of the references to colour
