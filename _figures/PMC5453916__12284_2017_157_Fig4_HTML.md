caption: Cytoscape visualisation of 16 newly identified metabolites from the rice
  bran metabolome. Medicinal and nutritional value for these bioactive compounds are
  described as deonted by 1 in Tables ,  and . Pathway specific network visualization
  is shown for Calrose rice bran. Each metabolite is represented as a node (circle),
  extending from a central sub-metabolic pathway node. The central hexagon node represents
  the super metabolic pathway. Node size corresponds to the Z-score using the relative
  abundance mean value for all three varieties
