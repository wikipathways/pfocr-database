caption: Synaptic stimulation activates adenylate cyclase (AC) resulting in the rapid
  release of cAMP and the activation of the cAMP→PKA→ERK pathway (kinases are indicated
  in yellow). Stimuli leading to long-term plasticity activate mTOR dependent protein
  synthesis of preexisting RNA granules (red ovals) allowing the transition into late-phase
  synaptic plasticity. Simultaneously, the cAMP→PKA→ERK pathway induces the synthesis
  and activation of chromatin remodeling proteins (e.g. PARP-1) and new gene expression.
  It is not yet known whether the mTOR pathway directly contributes to the activation
  and up-regulation of PARP-1 (dashed line). PARP-1 opens the chromatin allowing activity-dependent
  transcription to take place. Among the new genes expressed are activity-dependent
  Pol I transcripts required for the consolidation of late-phase synaptic plasticity.
  In this model, the new stimulation-evoked rRNAs give rise to new ribosomes. The
  new plasticity-dependent ribosomes are assembled into new RNA granules (green ovals)
  and shipped to activated synapses to maintain, through local protein synthesis,
  the long-lasting changes required for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory.
