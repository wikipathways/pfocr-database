caption: In healthy muscle, systemic cues activate RhoA in peripheral tissues which
  in turn regulates diurnal polymerisation (F-actin) and de-polymerisation (globular
  (G)-actin) of actin. During the de-polymerisation stage, G-actin preferentially
  binds to myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF). However, when this shifts
  to the polymerisation phase, the G-actin pool diminishes and unbound MRTF translocates
  into the nucleus and influences expression of SRF. SRF activation regulates transcription
  of SRF target genes including the core clock genes—Per1 and Per2, as well as secondary
  loop clock genes—Rora1 and Nr1d1, and cytoskeletal genes such as Acta. When dystrophin
  is absent, F-actin is not stable and the cell shifts to the de-polymerised state.
  G-actin binds to MRTF and therefore SRF transcription is hampered.
