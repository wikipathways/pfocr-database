caption: Mechanisms of neuronal glucotoxicity. In the early stages of hyperglycemia,
  there is an upregulation of glucose flux through glycolysis and the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA). This results in enhanced electron donor supply to the mitochondrial
  electron transport chain, leading to an increase in the proton gradient across the
  mitochondrial inner membrane which promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). ROS-induced DNA damage triggers the activation of the NAD+-dependent DNA
  repair enzyme, poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), responsible
  for depleting neuronal NAD+. The increase in intracellular glucose activates the
  polyol pathway which, in concert with PARP1, reduces intracellular NAD+ inhibiting
  glyceraldehyde triphosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and therefore glycolysis. The
  inhibition of GAPDH provokes the accumulation of upstream triose phosphates then
  converted to glycating agents, thereby promoting the formation of advanced glycation
  end products (AGEs). The accumulation of fructose, another metabolite upstream GAPDH,
  triggers the activation of the hexosamine pathway and the subsequent build-up of
  UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Furthermore, the activation of the polyol
  pathway depletes NADPH and, alongside mitochondrial ROS, contributes to oxidative
  stress in light of its role as a cofactor for glutathione reductase, which, in turn,
  is crucial in maintaining the intracellular pool of reduced glutathione.
