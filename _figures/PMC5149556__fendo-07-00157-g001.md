caption: Molecular events that connect inflammation to insulin resistance in obesity.
  Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) bind to Fetuin-A, an endogenous ligand of toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR2, and initiate transcription of interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) in a myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)–TIR-domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-β-dependent pathway. Activated IRF3 then translocates
  to the nucleus and binds to target DNA sequences. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) protein
  binds to its receptor and initiates inhibitor of κB (IκB)–NF-κB signaling pathway
  leading to translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus where it binds to AP-1 DNA sequences.
  Stimulation leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (LTB41) activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  pathway, leading to phosphorylation and binding of the c-Jun–c-Fos heterodimer to
  target genes. NF-κB, c-Jun–c-Fos, and IRF3 induce expression of inflammatory factors
  such as cytokines, chemokines, and components of the inflammasome. When inflammasome
  is assembled, pro-caspase-1 is converted to caspase-1, which then converts pro-interleukin-1β
  (IL-1β) and pro-IL-18 to IL-1β and IL-18, respectively. I, insulin; insulin receptor;
  IRS, insulin receptor substrate.
