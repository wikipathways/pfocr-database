caption: Overview of metabolic disturbance and pathway activation in the Acsl1T−/−
  heart. The loss of ACSL1 prevents uptake and activation of fatty acids (FAs) for
  oxidation. Other ACSL isoforms (ACSLx) activate FAs that are used for triacylglycerol
  (TAG) and phospholipid (PL) synthesis. The inability of Acsl1T−/− heart to oxidize
  FA is compensated for by increased glucose and amino acid catabolism. The shift
  in oxidative metabolism leads to reduced AMPK phosphorylation and the activation
  of the mTOR pathway causes cardiac hypertrophy in Acsl1T−/− and Acsl1H−/− mice.
  S6 Kinase-P, S6 kinase phosphorylation; Glucose 6-P, glucose-6-phosphate.
