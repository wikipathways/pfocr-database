caption: 'Schematic representation of different metabolic reactions and pathways contributing
  to oleagenicity in Rhodococcus. The enzymes and regulators (circles) mentioned in
  this article are in green. The enzymes that exhibit redundancy are underlined. The
  orange boxes indicate the precursors needed for the synthesis of triglycerides,
  while the yellow circles represent reserve compounds. The activator and inhibitory
  metabolites for the ADP-Glc PPase activity are marked with green and red dots, respectively.
  Lightning bolts indicate the existence of an external input that activates a regulatory
  protein. The red boxes indicate the main knowledge gaps that need to be investigated
  to get a better integral understanding of oleagenicity in rhodococci. Abbreviations:
