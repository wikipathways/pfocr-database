caption: A summary of hepatic lipid metabolism pathways altered in NAFLD and driving
  dyslipidemia. Increased hepatic TG in NAFLD is a result of several processes. Elevated
  plasma insulin and glucose levels respectively activate the LXR and ChREBP pathways,
  which increase de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Through the action of ACC, DNL increases
  the concentration of malonyl-coA, leading to inhibition of CPT1 and consequently
  reducing fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and mitochondrial function. In parallel, LXR
  increases the expression of ANGPTL8 and 3, two inhibitors of LPL. Moreover, ANGPTL8
  contributes to increase hepatic TG by decreasing intracellular TG hydrolysis via
  inhibiting ATGL. Increased hepatic TG content leads to higher TG secretion and,
  as a consequence, increased plasma TG levels. Increased intracellular cholesterol
  in the liver inhibits the SREBP2 pathway. SREBP2 increases LDLR and PCSK9 mRNA expression.
  These changes combined with additional post-transcriptional regulation of PCSK9
  lead to reduced membrane-bound LDLR, which leads to decreased LDL uptake by the
  liver. The ensemble of these changes contribute to increased large VLDL1 and the
  formation of small dense LDL, which favors foam cell formation and ultimately atherosclerosis.
  A number of potential NASH therapies directly target metabolic pathways of lipid
  metabolism. For example, firsocostat inhibits ACC, reducing DNL and hepatic TG accumulation.
  Statins inhibit HMGCoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis.
  Other strategies focus on activating different nuclear receptors that more broadly
  control lipid and glucose metabolism. These include nuclear receptors from the PPAR
  family, FXR and TR-β. Among those treatments, fibrates are PPARα agonists, pegbelfermin
  is a FGF21 analog (a PPARα target gene), thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone)
  are PPARγ agonists, elafibranor is a dual-PPARα/δ agonist, lanifibranor is a pan-PPAR
  agonist, obeticholic acid (OCA) is an FXR agonist, NGM282 is an FGF19 analog (FXR
  target gene in the intestine), and resmetirom is a TR-β agonist.
