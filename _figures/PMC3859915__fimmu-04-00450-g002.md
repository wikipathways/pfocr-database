caption: Signaling downstream IL-2/IL-15Rβ. Upon engagement of IL-2 or IL-15 different
  tyrosine residues are phosphorylated in the IL-2/15Rβ intracytoplasmic regions,
  across two main regions (“A” and “H”). These phosphorylations lead to the recruitment
  and downstream phosphorylation of STAT5 by JAK1 and JAK3. The mTOR pathway takes
  also part to IL-15 signaling but the mode of mTOR activation is currently unknown.
  Activation of mTOR is essential to increase NK cell metabolism. PI3K and MAPK are
  also activated upon IL-2 engagement and probably also upon IL-15 engagement but
  this requires formal demonstration.
