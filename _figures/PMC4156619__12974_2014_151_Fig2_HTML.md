caption: Peripheral and central kynurenine pathway interaction. As indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
  (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) are found at only very low concentrations
  within the brain, concentrations of within-brain tryptophan (TRP) and kynurenines
  are largely dependent on those from the periphery. TRP from the periphery competes
  with other large neutral amino acids (LNAA) for passage across the blood brain barrier
  (BBB) to be used in the synthesis of serotonin (5-HT). Kynurenine (KYN) and 3-hydroxykynurenine
  (3-HK) are also capable of crossing the BBB whereby they participate in the production
  of kynurenic acid (KYNA) and quinolinic acid (QUIN) which do not easily cross it.
