caption: Gene expression regulation in T cells at steady state. Quiescent (naive and
  memory) T cells receive tonic signals through the TCR, S1RP1 and IL‐7R and IL‐15R
  cytokine receptors (1). These signals are critical for maintenance and homeostasis
  and for de novo transcription in quiescent T cells (2). The fate of preformed mRNA
  (3) in quiescent T cells is determined via post‐transcriptional mechanisms. Long
  3’UTR in mRNA contains binding sites for RBPs, critical drivers of post‐transcriptional
  regulation. To keep quiescent T cells at bay, RBPs mediate mRNA decay and translational
  block. Conversely, tonic signaling engages PI3K‐AKT pathway and mTOR, which drives
  translation of proteins necessary for maintaining T cell quiescence and their preparedness
  for activation (4). The turnover rate of the proteins involved in T cell quiescence
  is high so that depletion of these proteins can occur immediately after activation.
