caption: Proteins or complexes encoded by MG risk genes are indicated in yellow background,
  while those in red character represent that their encoding genes are the miRNA-target
  genes with miRSNPs in their 3′UTR regions. Four important genes (IGF1R, IGF1, RAS,
  and BCL2) are MG risk genes and meanwhile contain the miRSNPs, and are indicated
  in red character and yellow background.
