caption: Mechanisms of acetic acid stress response in S. cerevisiae cells. When yeast
  cells utilize acetic acid as the sole carbon source acetate anion enters cells through
  either Jen1p or Ady2p monocarboxylate transporter where it is converted into acetyl-CoA
  which enters the TCA or the glyoxylate cycle. Both acetate transport and metabolism
  are inhibited by glucose. At low pH (pKa = 4.76), in the presence of glucose, acetic
  acid enters cells in its undissociated form by facilitated diffusion through Fps1p
  aquaglyceroporin channel, where more neutral cytosolic pH causes its dissociation
  into acid anions and protons. Concomitant cytoplasmic acidification by protons induces
  the activation of the Pma1p, a plasma membrane ATPase that pumps protons out of
  the cell. Acetic acid challenge may activate Hog1p, a MAP-kinase involved in phosphorylation
  and subsequent ubiquitination, endocytosis, and final vacuolar degradation of Fps1p,
  and transcription factor Haa1p enabling cells to adapt to varied levels of acetic
  acid. On the other hand, lethal concentrations of acetic acid induce ROS accumulation,
  cyt c release and mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase-like activity increase leading
  eventually to cell death (AA-PCD), with chromatin condensation and nuclear DNA fragmentation
  occurring as PCD hallmarks. AA-PCD can occur in YCA1-dependent or YCA1-independent
  manner. RTG signaling pathway is proposed to be activated in certain growth conditions
  causing AA-PCD resistance and cell adaptation to acetic acid stress (see text for
  details). RTG pathway is linked to TOR and Ras signaling pathways, where the former
  has an inhibitory effect on Rtg1/3-dependent gene expression, and the latter enhances
  retrograde response. Hyperactivation of Ras–cAMP–PKA pathway can lead to mitochondrial
  dysfunction, ROS production and apoptosis. Cell adaptation and acetate metabolic
  pathways (green arrows) and AA-PCD pathways (red arrows) are shown. COX, cyt c oxidase;
  RCI, respiratory control index; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid.
