caption: Regulation of insulin signaling pathway in adipocytes in healthy and obese
  (pathologic) subjects. In the former case, the induction of mTORC1 by insulin results
  in the inhibition of autophagy. The inhibition of autophagy induces a “browning”
  phenotype in adipocytes. During obesity, ER stress, hypoxia and inflammation stimulate
  insulin resistance, resulting in the inhibition of mTORC1, followed by the induction
  of autophagy. Autophagy improves adipocyte function by eliminating damaged organelles
  and misfolded proteins and preventing pro-inflammatory responses. In addition, the
  excessive stimulation of autophagy can increase energy storage by adipocytes and
  promote cell death
