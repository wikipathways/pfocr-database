  (3-P-Glycerate), and pyruvate, which trigger the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway,
  the one-carbon cycle, and the TCA cycle, respectively. The hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway generates uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an N-acetylglucosamine
  (GlcNAc) donor for addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to histone
  proteins. The one-carbon cycle produces S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a donor for
  methylation of both DNA and histone proteins. The TCA cycle generates α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG), the main cofactor for both the histone demethylases members of the Jumonji
  family (JHDM) and TET enzymes, involved in DNA methylation. In addition, the TCA
  cycle generates citrate, which is converted by ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) to acetyl-CoA,
  which acts as an acyl donor for histone acetylation. Acetyl-CoA can derive from
  either glycolysis or fatty acid oxidation. NAD+ is a main cofactor for SIRT1-mediated
  histone deacetylation. Intracellular NAD+ levels are determined by glycolysis and
  oxidative phosphorylation. SIRT1 catalyzes the NAD+-dependent deacetylation of target
  proteins, which are regulated by this reversible lysine modification. During deacetylation,
  NAD+ is converted to nicotinamide (NAM) and the ribose accepts the acetyl group
  from substrate to produce O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr). Red dots, methyl groups;
