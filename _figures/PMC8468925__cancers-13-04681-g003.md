caption: Exploiting cellular vulnerabilities induced by a defective p53 pathway. Alterations
  in the p53 pathway abrogate response to cellular stress. As a consequence, p53-
  or ATM-defective cells are sensitive to oxidative-stress-inducing agents such as
  PEITC or parthenolide. Abrogation of DNA damage response (DDR) leads to a number
  of cellular dependencies (addictions) in which tumor cells rely upon alternative
  pathways to repair DNA damage. Consequently, inhibition of these dependency pathways
  (i.e., ATR, USP7, PARP, or DNA-PK) leads to selective killing of p53 pathway-defective
  cells.

  description: Exploiting cellular vulnerabilities induced by a defective p53 pathway.
    Alterations in the p53 pathway abrogate response to cellular stress. As a consequence,
    p53- or ATM-defective cells are sensitive to oxidative-stress-inducing agents
    such as PEITC or parthenolide. Abrogation of DNA damage response (DDR) leads to
    a number of cellular dependencies (addictions) in which tumor cells rely upon
    alternative pathways to repair DNA damage. Consequently, inhibition of these dependency
    pathways (i.e., ATR, USP7, PARP, or DNA-PK) leads to selective killing of p53
    pathway-defective cells.
