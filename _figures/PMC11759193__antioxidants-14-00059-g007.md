caption: Mechanistic overview scheme of the effects of aircraft noise on endothelial
  function. Noise acts on the stress response pathway, activating the sympathetic
  nervous system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis through the activation
  of the amygdala and the hypothalamus, by releasing corticotropin-releasing hormone
  (CRH) into the pituitary gland, further stimulating the release of adrenocorticotropic
  hormone (ACTH) into the circulation [36]. Sympathetic nervous system activation
  induces inflammation and oxidative stress through catecholamine release. Catecholamines
  bind to α- and β-adrenergic receptors in the brain, on immune cells, and on vascular/cardiac
  tissue, which promote downstream activation of ROS-releasing enzymes and mediators
  of inflammation, leading to endothelial dysfunction. Treatment with α- or β-receptor
  blockers reduced markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in both the cardiovascular
  and brain tissue and alleviated the negative effects on the endothelial function.
  Some of the depicted pathways were summarized from previous work [10]. Arrows up
  or down nearby protein names mean up- or downregulation of protein. Created with
