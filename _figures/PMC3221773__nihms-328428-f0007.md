caption: Model of layered B-1 and B-2 development. In a first neonatal wave, B-1 CLPs
  generate B-1 progenitors that in turn differentiate into immature B-1 cells. The
  latter cells then migrate to the SPL where they mature into B-1a and B-1b cells
  through B-1 transitional cell intermediates. In a second wave, B-2 CLPs generate
  immature B-2 cells that mature into B-2 transitional cells in the SPL. This B-2
  transitional cell wave becomes predominant in the adult. Emergence of B-1 and B-2
  transitional cells is blocked when both the classical and alternative NF-κB pathways
  are inactivated (Step 1). However, selective defects in one or the other pathway
  have differential effects on the formation of mature B-1 and B-2 cells. While the
  survival and maturation of B-2 transitional cells is dependent on alternative NF-κB
  signaling (step 2), B-1 transitional cells emerge and mature in the absence of these
  signals. The number of mature B-1 cells is reduced in mice with defects in classical
  NF-κB signaling. However, this does not compromise the emergence or maturation of
  B-1 transitional cells into B-1a or B-1b cells. Instead, classical signaling is
  required for maintenance of the mature B-1 pool, and for B-1a cells in particular,
  following their formation (step 3).
