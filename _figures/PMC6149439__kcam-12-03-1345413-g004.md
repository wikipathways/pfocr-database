caption: 'Molecular model depicting UNC-53 mediated regulation of UNC-5 in Rac GTPase
  dependent and independent pathways required for proper DTC migration: The genetic
  data supports UNC-53 functioning in Rac GTPase dependent and independent pathways
  for proper DTC migration by regulating the activity of UNC-5 receptor. We propose
  that UNC-53 primarily regulate UNC-5 activity by 2 pathways, first by negatively
  regulating CED-10 and MIG-2 mediated signaling and second pathway includes ABL-1
  and most probably ABI-1.'
