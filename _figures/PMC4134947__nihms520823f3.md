caption: 'Mutant proteins are indicated with asterisks and are circled. The citramalate
  pathway (upper left) and the Threonine pathway (center left) both produce the metabolic
  intermediate 2-ketobutyrate, which can be converted into L-homoalanine by a mutant
  GDH (GDH*, model based on PDB: 1BGV) []). 2-ketobutyrate can also be converted into
  alcohols (pathways on lower left) by action of LeuA, LeuCD, LeuB, KIVD, and ADH.
  A mutant LeuA (LeuA*, model based on PDB: 1SR9 []) is required for recursive "+1"
  chain elongation of ketoacid substrates, and a mutant KIVD (KIVD*) is required to
  produce 5-8 carbon alcohols. Isobutanol and branched-chain acids (pathways on right)
  are made by co-opting the valine and leucine biosynthesis pathways. For production
  of isobutanol, a mutant IlvC (IlvC*, model based on PDB: 1YRL []) was engineered
  to use NADH instead of NADPH. For branched-chain acid production, KIVD, IPDC, and
  an ALDH were engineered.'
