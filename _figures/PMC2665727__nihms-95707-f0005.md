caption: 'Ty retrotransposition cycle. Wavy red lines represent retrotransposon RNA;
  the red rectangle is the DNA copy of the retrotransposon. Blue dots represent the
  Gag structural protein; blue and green shapes represent the Gag-Pol polyprotein.
  Hexagons represent the virus-like particle (VLP). The stages in the pathway are
  as follows: (1) transcription of Ty element by RNA polymerase II, (2) transport
  into the cytoplasm (3) translation of retrotransposon mRNA, (4) VLP assembly and
  retrotransposon mRNA packaging, (5) reverse transcription, (6) import into the nucleus,
  and (7) integration of cDNA into the genome. Stimulatory (green) and inhibitory
  (red) host functions are represented near their putative sites of action. An enlargement
  of stages 3 and 4 is provided to illustrate the localization of Ty RNA and proteins
  in mRNA processing bodies (P body, grey enclosure). An active translation complex
  is indicated by binding of the GpppX cap of the mRNA to translation initiation factors
  (eIFs) and binding of the poly(A) tail to poly(A) binding protein, Pab1. Shortening
  of the poly(A) tail (deadenylation, dotted arrows) is the major mechanism of disassociation
  of mRNA from the translation initiation complex and binding by the decapping co-activators,
  Pat1, Dhh1 and Lsm1−7 (chain of grey ovals). These factors promote the localization
  of mRNA in P bodies, where mRNA decapping by Dcp1/Dcp2 and 5′−3′ degradation by
  Xrn1 occurs. VLP assembly may occur in P bodies.'
