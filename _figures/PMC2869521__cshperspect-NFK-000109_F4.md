caption: Solid tumors activate the NF-κB pathway to maintain cell survival. (A) IKKε
  is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer in association with a gain or amplification
  of its genomic locus. IKKε phosphorylates a serine residue in CYLD, thereby lowering
  its deubiquitinase activity toward the IKKγ subunit, leading to a more active IKK
  enzyme. In addition, IKKε can directly phosphorylate serine-46 of IκBα. (B) Regulation
  of NF-κB by TBK1 downstream of mutant K-ras in lung cancer. Mutant K-ras signals
  to several downstream pathways, including the MAP kinase, PI(3) kinase, and RAL
  GTPase pathways. K-ras-associated RAL guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Ral-GEFs)
  promote the active, GTP-bound state of the RAL proteins. RalB interacts with Sec5,
  which in turn recruits TBK1, causing kinase activation. TBK1 triggers classical
  NF-κB pathway activation, as judged by the accumulation of nuclear p50/c-rel heterodimers.
  Because TBK1 can only phosphorylate one serine in IκBα, an as yet unknown kinase
  must cooperate with TBK1 to achieve dual IκBα phosphorylation.
