caption: FMDV entered host cells by macropinocytosis and CME. For the macropinocytic
  entry, the binding of FMDV to RTKs may activate cellular actin modulators (Rac1,
  Pak1, and PKC) and other factors, such as NHEs and dynamin, which trigger actin
  rearrangement and plasma membrane ruffling. The virions are then internalized into
  macropinosomes, and the membrane fission events that separate the macropinosomes
  from the extracellular space occur in a myosin II-dependent manner. After closure,
  the early macropinosomes containing FMDV acquire Rab5 and EEA1, which facilitate
  intracellular trafficking. The acidic pH of macropinosomes may trigger viral uncoating.
  As an alternative entry route of FMDV, virion binding to integrin receptors induces
  viral internalization via CME. The internalized vesicle is then delivered to early
  endosomes, and the endosomal acidic pH triggers viral uncoating.
