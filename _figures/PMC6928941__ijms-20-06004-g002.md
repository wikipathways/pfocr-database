caption: Ca2+ is mostly involved in mTOR-independent autophagy induction. The canonical
  pathway of regulation and induction of autophagy is controlled by the mammalian/mechanistic
  target of rapamycin (mTOR). A variety of factors can inhibit mTOR and lead to autophagy
  activation. Inactivated mTOR activates and phosphorylates Unc-51 like autophagy
  activating kinase (ULK1) complex, forming a multiprotein complex with Beclin1, VPS34,
  AMBRA1, VPS34, and PI3K-III, known as the PI3K class III complex, and the formation
  of PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate). PIP3 induces the initiation of the phagophore
  membrane, while the elongation is controlled by the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L complex. At
  the same time, LC3 is lipidated and conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine, forming
  the LC3-II and participating in the cargo recognition and closure of the autophagosome
  membrane. Cargo is degraded by the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and is
  performed by lysosomal hydrolases. Ca2+ physiology and signaling have an important
  role in the induction of autophagy. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels, mediated by
  SOCC or release of intracellular stores (induced by thapsigargin, vitamin D ionomycin,
  or Ru360), can activate Ca2+calmodulin dependent kinase 2 (CaMKK2), which will activate
  protein kinase B (AKT); or alternatively, Ca2+ can directly activate AKT, initiating
  the signaling processes necessary for autophagy induction. The Ca2+ released from
  the lysosome can also activate AKT and CaMKK2, by the stimulating two-pore channels
  (TPC) and transient receptor potential cation channel, mucolipin subfamily, member
  1 (TRPML1). In PD, the mutated protein leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) can
  upregulate TPC activity, causing increased Ca2+ transport through the channel, and
  augment autophagy. The stored lysosomal Ca2+ released via TRPML1 activates calcineurin,
  which leads to transcription factor EB (TFEB) dephosphorylation. Dephosphorylated
  TFEB translocates to the nucleus, regulating lysosomal genesis, activation of autophagy,
  and increasing cell clearance. On the other hand, reduced Ca2+ channel activity
  can attenuate the autophagic response. Knocking-out presenilin leads to reduced
  lysosomal H+-ATPase pump and SERCA activities, as well as reduced autophagy. SERCA
  inhibition with thapsigargin shows similar results. Attenuated IP3R activity inhibits
  Ca2+ release from the ER, consequently reducing the CICR via RyR activation and
  decreases the autophagic response.
