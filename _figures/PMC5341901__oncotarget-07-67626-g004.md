caption: MYC pathway activation, glutaminolysis, and the oncometabolite 2HG stand
  in a functional relationship to each other and are associated with stem-like features
  in cancer cells. 2HG accumulation (Key factor 1) inhibits αKG-dependent dioxygenases,
  which results in stabilization of HIF1α and in extensive epigenetic alteration.
  These methylation-specific changes cause a block of cell differentiation and an
  increase in the expression of stem and progenitor cell markers. 2HG accumulation
  is often associated with MYC pathway activation (Key factor 2) in breast cancer
  cells. MYC maintains stem cell pluripotency and simultaneously influences major
  metabolic pathways implicated in overactive tumor cell metabolism, including mitochondrial
  biogenesis. MYC expression is affected by the interaction of ERα with ERBB2 and
  strongly influences glutamine metabolism by regulating glutaminase expression. A
  metabolic switch towards activated glutaminolysis is mediated by extracellular lactate
  uptake via MCT1, stabilizing HIF2α and transactivating MYC, which subsequently triggers
  the expression of glutamine transporter ASCT2 and of glutaminase (GLS). Glutaminolysis
  (Key factor 3) contributes to cancer cell metabolism by fueling OXPHOS through the
  replenishment of TCA cycle intermediates, supplying building blocks for proliferation,
  replenishing GSH pools for ROS-scavenging (which involves the xCT cystine/glutamate
  antiporter for cysteine acquisition and the generation of NADPH by malic enzyme
  to reduce GSSG back to GSH), coupling glutamine export with leucine-import (which
  mobilizes mTORC1 and stimulates ribosome biosynthesis), and promoting 2HG accumulation
