caption: Displays canonical P2Y Purinergic Receptor Signaling pathway identified through
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Genes highlighted in pink represent focus genes.
  ADCYL [(AC) adenylate cyclase)] is involved in biological processes including activation
  of protein kinase A activity and G-protein coupled receptor signaling. ITGA2B [(GpIIB/IIA)
  integrin subunit alpha 2b)] is involved in cell adhesion, regulation of leukocyte
  migration and platelet aggregation. PLCD [(PLC) phospholipase C delta 1)] is involved
  in angiogenesis and is a regulator of cell proliferation. PRKACB [(PKA) protein
  kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit beta)] is involved in activation of protein
  kinase A activity and G-protein coupled receptor signaling. PRKCH [(PKC) protein
  kinase C eta)] is involved in cell differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis,
  and NFκB activity.
