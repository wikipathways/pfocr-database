caption: (A) GUN4 retrograde signalling model (after ). (i) GUN4 is proposed to be
  an activator of MgCh activity, interacting with the chlorophyll H subunit to promote
  the catalytic integration of Mg2+ with ProtoIX to form the chlorophyll biosynthesis
  pathway intermediate Mg-ProtoIX. (ii) The accumulation of excess tetrapyrrole intermediates,
  such as ProtoIX, in the chloroplast can lead to generation of ROS. GUN4 is proposed
  to bind ProtoIX, shielding its reaction with ROS. In shielding ProtoIX, GUN4 may
  be progressively modified or degraded, with degradation products hypothesized to
  act as the retrograde signals. (B) A contrasting model for GUN4 (after ). Instead
  of having a ‘shielding’ effect when bound to ProtoIX, the GUN4–ProtoIX complex appeared
  to escalate 1O2 generation. The elevated 1O2 produced by GUN4–ProtoIX may be sensed
  by an 1O2-sensing system (like the Arabidopsis EXECUTER1/EXECUTER2 or EX1/EX2 system)
  yet to be discovered, that relays a signal to the nucleus.
