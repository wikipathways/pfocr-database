caption: 'The inflammatory pathways leading to the development of IBD-related colorectal
  cancer. A: The role of the JAK/STAT3 pathway in the development of IBD-related colorectal
  cancer. Various in vivo and in vitro models have shown that the JAK/STAT3 pathway
  plays a vital role in oncogenesis. The signal transduction of IL-6 involves the
  activation of JAK, activating transcription factors of the signal transducers and
  activators of STAT3. This is followed by its phosphorylation, dimerization and nuclear
  translocation of STAT3, initiating transcription of STAT3 target genes (including
  cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, c-myc, Mcl1, surviving and VEGF) leading to carcinogenesis. PI3K
  mediated activation of Forkhead box O3 (FOXO) leads to inhibition of gene transcription,
  whereas PI3K mediated activation of mTOT leads to oncogene transcription-mediated
  development of oncogenesis; B: The canonical Wnt-pathway in the development of IBD-related
  colorectal cancer. The canonical Wnt-pathway (β-catenin mediated Wnt-signaling)
  regulates proliferation and differentiation of the colonic stem cell in the normal
  colon. However, the loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene results in
  the shift of β-catenin from the membrane to the nucleus leading to increased transcription
  of cyclin D1 and c-myc genes thereby triggering carcinogenesis. IBD: Inflammatory
  bowel disease; CRC: Colorectal cancer; JAK: Juan kinase; P: Phosphorylation; STAT3:
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins 3; PI3K: Phosphoinositide-3-kinases;
