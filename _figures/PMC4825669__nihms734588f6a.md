caption: (A) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) illustrating genes upregulated (red)
  and downregulated (green) Post-TAC relative to Post-Swim in TgGRK5 mice with an
  emphasis on Connective Tissue Disorders, Organismal Injury and Abnormalities, Dermatological
  Diseases and Conditions. (B) IPA illustrating genes upregulated (red) and downregulated
  (green) Post-TAC relative to Post-Swim in TgGRK5 mice with an emphasis on Organismal
  Injury and Abnormalities, Cellular Development, Connective Tissue Development and
  Function. Lines with solid arrowheads represent direct interaction of molecules
  in signaling cascade. Lines with clear arrowheads represent auto-regulation in signaling
  cascade.
