caption: Specific nutrient-sensing pathways contribute to ARD entry and exit. The
  initial sensing and dissemination of the signal to enter ARD (green pathways) includes
  genes encoding proteins involved in O-GlcNAc cycling (ogt-1, oga-1, with dotted
  arrows showing their biochemical interaction), genes that regulate fatty acid metabolism
  (nhr-49, acs-2) and sirtuins (sir-2.1). The dashed green line indicates an allele-specific
  effect on ARD entry. Energy sensing, mediated by the product of aak-2, uniquely
  acts in both ARD initiation and recovery (yellow pathway). The two members of the
  insulin/IGF signaling pathway tested in this study showed differing results with
  age-1 not affecting ARD (grey pathway), while the downstream daf-16 affected recovery
  (red pathway). ARD recovery additionally relies on the TOR pathway (rsks-1), which
  may also interact with daf-16. Stress signaling influences ARD recovery as well,
  with skn-1 playing a minor role, and another possible pathway interacting with daf-16.
