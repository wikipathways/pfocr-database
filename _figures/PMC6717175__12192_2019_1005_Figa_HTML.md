caption: Mixed primary glial cultures were established from cortical and spinal cord
  regions of wild-type mice and mice expressing ALS–causing mutant human SOD1 and
  the inflammatory and heat shock responses were investigated in these cultures. In
  the absence of stress, all cultures appeared to have similar cellular composition,
  levels of inflammatory mediators and similar expression level of heat shock proteins.
  When stimulated, spinal cord glia were more reactive and activated the inflammatory
  pathway more readily than cortical glia; this response was similar in wild-type
  and SOD1G93A glial cultures. Although the heat shock response was similar in spinal
  cord and cortical glial, in SOD1G93A expressing glia from both the spinal cord and
  cortex, the induction of heat shock response was diminished. This impaired heat
  shock response in SOD1G93A glia may therefore contribute to the exacerbated inflammatory
  reactions observed in ALS mice.
