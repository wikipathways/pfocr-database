caption: Endosteal, reticular, and vascular niches in the context of bone marrow.
  In the endosteal niche, HSCs proliferate and, while their number increases, they
  move toward the vascular niche following cytokine and physical gradient (mobilization)
  and reaching the vascular niche, where further differentiation into mature elements
  occurs. HSCs differentiation leads to cell types, including monocytes, which can
  turn into osteoclasts or macrophage. Monocytes and machrophages can then move to
  peripheral tissues through systemic vessels. HSCs homing is favoured by CXCL12 produced
  by CAR cells, particularly abundant in reticular niche. In bone marrow niche, mesenchymal
  stem cells can be found, which under the influence of Wnt10b and BMP2 are able to
  move to bone matrix and differentiate into osteoblasts. B Lym B lymphocyte, Bas
