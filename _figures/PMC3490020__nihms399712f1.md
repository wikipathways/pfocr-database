caption: The main MicroRNA biosynthetic pathway. MicroRNAs are often transcribed in
  multi-unit clusters known as pri-miRNAs. These long transcripts include several
  pre-miRNAs that become separated by the RNAse enzyme Drosha. Individual pre-miRNAs
  are actively transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin5. In the cytoplasm a second
  RNAse enzyme, Dicer, digests the loop between the two strands of the miRNA hairpin,
  releasing the miRNA duplex. Argonaut 2 recognizes one or both of the strands of
  the duplex and with the participation of Argonaut 1 mediates the inclusion in the
  RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). [Fig. 1. Double column width, colour.]
