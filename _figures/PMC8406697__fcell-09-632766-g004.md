caption: 'Representation of the proposed link between serotonin and craniofacial defects
  mediated by FoxO1 transcription factor. Our hypothetical model proposes that under
  low serotonin signaling, FoxO1 enters to the nucleus generating the transcription
  of osteogenic (Runx2) and cartilage (Sox9) differentiation genes promoting the differentiation
  of bones and cartilages. On the contrary, under high serotonin signaling, the activation
  of the serotonin two receptor, through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, impedes the entrance
  of FoxO1 to the nucleus, generating an imbalance in the pluripotency genes related
  to craniofacial defects. Craniofacial defects observed are included. References:
