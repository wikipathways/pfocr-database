caption: The Wnt canonical and non-canonical pathways. (a) The Wnt/β-catenin(bC) pathway.
  In the normal steady state, bC is targeted for degradation by a cytoplasmic APC/Axin/GSK-3β
  protein complex. Once bound to this complex, bC is targeted by coordinated phosphorylation
  by CK1/APC/Axin/GSK-3β-complex leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
  However, when the Wnt ligand binds to Frizzled/LRP5/6 co-receptors, subsequently
  triggers activation of Dvl followed by releasing bC from an inhibitory APC/Axin/GSK-3β-complex.
  bC translocates into the nucleus and activates genes involved in cell proliferation,
  survival and differentiation. (b). The Wnt/PCP pathway. When the Wnt ligand binds
  to Wnt/PCP receptor complex, Dvl is responsible for initiating the signaling cascade
  that culminates in the activation of the small GTPases Rac, Rho and cdc42. Once
  activated, these proteins trigger cytoskeletal rearrangements which regulate cell
  motility and polarity.
