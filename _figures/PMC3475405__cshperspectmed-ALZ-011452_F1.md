caption: The vascular hypothesis of Alzheimer disease. Vascular risk factors (e.g.,
  hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiac disease) and/or an initial vascular damage
  mediated by a cerebrovascular disorder (e.g., ischemia, stroke) lead to brain hypoperfusion
  (oligemia) and/or blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction (hit 1), which is associated
  with a diminished brain capillary flow/hypoxia and accumulation of multiple neurotoxins
  in brain, respectively, that can impact neuronal function contributing to the development
  of neurodegenerative changes and cognitive decline (solid lines). In a parallel
  pathway, BBB dysfunction and hypoperfusion/hypoxia can reduce amyloid β peptide
  (Aβ) vascular clearance across the BBB and increase Aβ production from Aβ-precursor
  protein (APP), respectively, causing Aβ accumulation in brain (hit 2; dashed lines).
  Elevated Aβ levels lead to formation of neurotoxic Aβ oligomers, causing neuronal
  dysfunction, on the one hand, and self-aggregation, on the other, which leads to
  self-propagation of Aβ-mediated brain disorder and the development of cerebral β-amyloidosis.
  According to the vascular hypothesis, a pathogenic tau phosphorylation in neurons
  and the development of tau-related pathology including neurofibrillary tangles (not
  shown in the diagram) may be triggered independently or simultaneously by a hypoperfusion/hypoxia
  insult and/or direct Aβ neurotoxicity.
