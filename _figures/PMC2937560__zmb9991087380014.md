caption: MAPK dynamics and the induction of pathway responses. (A) The signal transduction
  cascade of the pheromone response pathway is depicted as a curve emanating from
  membrane-associated upstream components and terminating in the active MAPK. Restricting
  the localization of an intermediate pathway component (e.g., Ste11) does not prevent
  activation of normal downstream components or normal outputs (left), whereas restricting
  the localization of the terminal effector MAPK confines its activity to only some
  of its targets and biases its action toward inappropriate ones (right). (B) The
  activity of the upstream signal transduction pathway is directed to cellular processes
  according to the subcellular localization of Fus3. Only the free MAPK can access
  all of its relevant substrates efficiently.
