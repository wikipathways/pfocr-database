caption: 'Computational framework for developing molecular connectivity maps. The
  framework consists of three major components: disease protein network, disease-disease
  network and disease biomarker network. The first component takes the inputs from
  database and literature and outputs a disease protein network (DPN). The second
  component takes the input from DPN and generates the output of positively scored
  disease-disease network (DDN) using scoring algorithm. Further, the second component
  was used to generate sub-component of common pathway network (CPN). The final disease
  biomarker network (DBN) component was generated from DPN showing proteins specific
  to diseases.'
