caption: Peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids and IBA. A, Fatty acids (green) and
  IBA (purple) are processed and transported to peroxisomes for catabolism through
  β-oxidation. Required enzyme activities are indicated in the center of the mechanism;
  known or predicted enzymes acting in each pathway are indicated outside the arrows.
  The enzyme converting IBA to IBA-CoA is unknown, and it is not clear if IBA is transported
  into peroxisome in the form of IBA or IBA-CoA. B, The complete degradation of C18:1Δ6-cis
  is shown as an example of pathways involved in catabolism of fatty acids with a
  cis-double bond on an even-numbered carbon. Auxiliary enzymes are in red. The first
  double bond of unsaturated fatty acids is always more than two carbons away from
  the CoA attachment site. Thus, at least one round of core β-oxidation is required
  to function upstream of auxiliary pathways in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty
  acids.
