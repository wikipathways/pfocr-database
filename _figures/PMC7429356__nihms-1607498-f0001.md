caption: Under normoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylase domain containing enzymes (PHDs)
  hydroxylate the hypoxia inducible factor alpha subunits (HIF1α and HIF2α). These
  hydroxylations allow the E3 ubituitin ligase von Hippen Lindau (VHL) to ubiquitinate
  HIF1α and HIF2α, leading to their proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions,
  the PHD enzymes are inactive, allowing HIF1α and HIF2α to accumulate in the cytoplasm.
  The alpha subunits will then dimerize with HIF1β, enter the nucleus, and bind to
  hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the DNA to act as transcription factors and
  drive the expression of hypoxia responsive genes.
