caption: CSF1R c.1085 genotype regulated tumor immunity and affected clinical outcome.
  Macrophages with different CSF1R c.1085 genotypes responded to the stimulation of
  CSF-1 differentially. CSF-1 induced a prominent activation of CSF-1R, leading to
  an M2-like dominant polarization in macrophages with CSF1R c.1085 genotype A_A.
  CRC patients with CSF1R c.1085 genotype A_A had worse clinical outcome, including
  shorter disease-free survival and overall survival. In addition to the more M2-like
  macrophages, lower IL-2 expression generated by the interaction of CD40 ligand and
  CD40 between helper T cells and macrophages with CSF1R c.1085 genotype A_A also
  provide a mechanism explaining why CRC patients without this germline variant had
  a worse clinical outcome. TAM, tumor-associated macrophage; Th, T helper cell; NK,
  nature killer cell; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte.
