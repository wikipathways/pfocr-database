caption: Bacterial enzymes involved in butanoate metabolism and changes in their expression
  in the presence of polysaccharides from Astragalus and Codonopsis pilosula. Differentially
  regulated enzymes in the APS (A) and CPPS (B) groups using enzymatic expression
  in the FOS group as the baseline. All gene products with blue-filled boxes represent
  background genes present in the species tested in this transcriptome, while gene
  products with white-filled boxes indicate genes not belonging to the species tested
  in this transcriptome. Genes with red, yellow, or sky blue borders indicate differentially
  expressed genes annotated to this metabolic pathway, representing upregulated, downregulated,
  and both upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively. The number in each box
  corresponds to the Enzyme Commission number identifying the enzyme
