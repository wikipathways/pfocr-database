caption: A proposed mechanistic model as to how ciRS-7 functions as a miR-7 sponge
  and regulates EGFR/RAF1/MAPK pathway via inhibiting miR-7 activity. The normal function
  of miR-7 is to prevent excess activation of EGFR/RAF1/MAPK pathway in intestinal
  epithelial cells. Instead, persistent up-regulation of ciRS-7 sequestered miR-7
  and thereby lead to the accumulation of growth signaling to drive colorectal tumor
  growth.
