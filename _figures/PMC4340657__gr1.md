caption: 'Modes of cell death. Activation of apoptotic, necroptotic, or pyroptotic
  signaling pathways leads to cell death. Left panel: Upon binding of a death ligand,
  the intracellular domain of a death receptor recruits adaptor proteins such as Fas-associated
  protein with death domain (FADD) and pro-caspase 8 to form a signaling platform
  termed the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Caspase 8 undergoes proteolytic
  autoactivation, resulting in direct or indirect (via mitochondria) activation of
  caspases 3, 6, and 7, which execute the final step of cell death. Various stimuli,
  including endoplasmic reticulum stress, trigger apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway,
  where mitochondrial permeabilization is a central event. Release of proapoptotic
  factors from mitochondria into the cytosol activates caspase 3, 6, and 7 and cell
  death by apoptosis. Middle panel: Necroptosis is initiated by death receptors in
  cells where caspase 8 function is inhibited. Under these conditions, death receptor
  activation promotes formation of a necrosome, a signaling complex comprising FADD,
  receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1), and RIP3. This complex induces cell
  death via mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), and probably other mediators.
  Right panel: Pyroptosis is a cell death mode resulting from activation of inflammasomes,
  including NLRP3 inflammasome. Upon activation, the intracellular receptor NLR family,
  pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) recruits apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  containing a CARD (ASC) and pro-caspase 1. Cleavage-activated caspase 1 then induces
  cell death.'
