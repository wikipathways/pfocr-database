caption: '(A) The proposed new aerobic benzoate metabolic pathway in A. evansii and
  the conventional β-ketoadipate pathway. Compounds: 1, benzoate; 2, protocatechuate;
  3, catechol; 4, β-ketoadipate; 5, β-ketoadipyl-CoA; 6, succinyl-CoA; 7, acetyl-CoA;
  8, benzoyl-CoA; 9, 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA; 10, 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA
  semialdehyde; 11, cis-3,4-dehyroadipyl-CoA; 12, trans-2,3-dehydroadipyl-CoA; 13,
  β-hydroxyadipyl-CoA; 14, β-hydroxyadipyl-CoA lactone. The two pathways merge at
  β-ketoadipyl-CoA (compound 5). (B) The aerobic benzoate oxidation gene cluster of
  A. evansii is experimentally shown, as well as putative functions of the gene products.
  The sizes of the different open reading frames are indicated beneath the arrows.'
