caption: (A) In subjects with normal levels of CDKN2B, E2F4 remains bound to RB and
  is not able to repress CALR expression. CALR is therefore expressed on the surface
  of the AB and activates LRP-1–dependent ABCA1 expression, reverse cholesterol transport,
  and phagocytosis. Because this efferocytosis pathway is intact, the AB is efficiently
  cleared, and the macrophage maintains a quiescent antiinflammatory profile. (B)
  In subjects who have reduced levels of CDKN2B, E2F4 is released from phosphorylated
  RB and inhibits CALR expression. Because it does not express an “eat-me” signature,
  the AB is not engaged by a neighboring phagocyte and rapidly undergoes secondary
  necrosis. As a consequence of this failed efferocytosis, the macrophage assumes
  an inflammatory foam cell phenotype.
