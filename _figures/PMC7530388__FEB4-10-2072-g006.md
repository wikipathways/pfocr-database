caption: Effects of low‐dose EVE on the signaling pathways assessed in the present
  study. (A) Schematic diagram of the activated Akt pathway in estrogen deprivation‐resistant
  breast cancer. One of the mechanisms underlying estrogen deprivation resistance
  is the aberrant activation of ERα, dependent on its phosphorylation at S167, through
  the Akt–mTOR signaling pathway, which regulates several cellular functions including
  cell growth and survival. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor, EVE, eliminates estrogen
  deprivation therapy‐resistant breast cancer cell growth. (B) In all EVE‐resistant
  LTED clones (IC‐cells) investigated, low‐dose EVE increased the expression of CIP2A,
  activated the Akt signaling and enhanced the cell growth. Although EMT was enhanced,
  the molecular mechanism remains unclear. EVE‐activated pathways revealed in this
  study are indicated using red lines.
