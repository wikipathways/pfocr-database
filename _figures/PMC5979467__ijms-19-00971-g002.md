caption: 'Role of survivin in caspase-mediated apoptosis. The activation of caspase-3
  and caspase-mediated apoptosis are caused by the initiator caspases (caspase-8/-10
  and -9) as part of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways, respectively.
  In the extrinsic pathway, activated receptors, such as Fas and tumor necrosis factor
  receptor (TNFR), cause caspase-8/-10 activation. In the intrinsic pathway, stress
  signals alter the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family,
  resulting in the release of mitochondrial factors such as Smac/DIABLO and cytochrome
  c. These factors cause the activation of caspase-9. Survivin interacts with XIAP,
  preventing the activation of caspase-9 through the inhibition of apoptosome formation
  and with Smac/DIABLO hinders its pro-apoptotic function. The nuclear/cytosolic balance
  of survivin is regulated by the nuclear export receptor Crm1. Green-line arrow:
  stimulation; red t-bar: inhibition; black-line arrow: translocation of molecules/stimuli.'
