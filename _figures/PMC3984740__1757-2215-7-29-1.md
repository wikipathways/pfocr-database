caption: 'Disputable mechanisms of the addition of N2O to the CO2 pneumoperitoneum
  impact on adhesion formation. A) Traditional mechanism of multiple severe adhesion
  formation, which is not related with N2O. B) The antiadhesiogenic impact of N2O.
  Metabolic pathways affected by N2O included interactions with the cobalt atom (Co),
  betaine, methyltransferase, methionine synthase with increased homocysteine (Hcys)
  and decreased methionine [,]. Then, several enzyme deficiencies can also be a pathway
  for decreased postsurgical adhesions such as acystathionine synthetase, tetrahydrofolate
  methyltransferase and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), which catalyze
  the synthesis of cystathionine from Hcys [,] with subsequent increased cysteine
  concentration, which then results in weakened collagen cross-linking [] in the collagen
  network between fibroblasts; N2O induced-oxidative stress, DNA damage [] and apoptosis
  by caspase-3 activation [] in these virgin adhesion fibroblasts with increased genome
  instability. C) A possible mechanism of the adhesiogenic impact of N2O: The following
  changes are associated with increased Hcys concentration: shift of vascular endothelium
  surface from anti- to pro-coagulant status; reactivation of blood platelets; alterations
  of several intrinsic and extrinsic targets in the coagulation and fibrinolysis system
  with modification of the blood clot/fibrin clot structure; increased resistance
  of fibrin clot to fibrinolysis [] with increased adhesion formation potential.'
