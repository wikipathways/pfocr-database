caption: During T-cell receptor (TCR) crosslinking with antigen presented by major
  histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules (in CD4+ T cells) or class
  I molecules (in CD8+ T cells), the tyrosines of the cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 become
  phosphorylated (P). SHP-2 (and possibly SHP-1) is recruited to the ITSM, and an
  as-yet-unidentified partner is recruited to the ITIM. As a consequence, phosphorylation
  of TCR proximal signaling molecules, including Lck and ZAP-70, is impaired (Panel
  A). Activation of the PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway (Panel B) and activation of the Ras–MEK–ERK
  pathway (Panel C) are inhibited. In contrast, other signaling events, such as the
  activation of the p38 pathway, remain unaffected or enhanced (e.g., BATF is up-regulated)
  (Panel D). The imbalanced activation of signaling pathways alters cell-cycle progression,
  gene transcription, metabolism, and epigenetic programs in T cells. Black arrows
  indicate activation signals, and red blocked arrows indicate inhibited signals.
