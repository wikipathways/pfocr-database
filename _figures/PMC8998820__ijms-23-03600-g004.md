caption: Neutrophilic inflammation induced by Natterin requires cGAS/STING/IRF3 via
  type I IFN receptor. Natterin induces neutrophilic infiltration with cell activation
  and release of cytosolic molecules, such as DNA, succinate and ROS. cGAS/STING drives
  IRF3-mediated inflammation dependent on type I IFN receptor. The activation of the
  STING pathway requires TLR4/TRIF-dependent pathway, essential for the production
  of type I IFNs, which synergizes with processed IL-33 to coordinate inflammation.
  Our data clarify that the neutrophilic inflammation induced by Natterin an aerolysin-like
  toxin is the result of activation of cytosolic DNA sensors pointing to the possibility
  of new pharmacological tools for its control.

  description: Neutrophilic inflammation induced by Natterin requires cGAS/STING/IRF3
    via type I IFN receptor. Natterin induces neutrophilic infiltration with cell
    activation and release of cytosolic molecules, such as DNA, succinate and ROS.
    cGAS/STING drives IRF3-mediated inflammation dependent on type I IFN receptor.
    The activation of the STING pathway requires TLR4/TRIF-dependent pathway, essential
    for the production of type I IFNs, which synergizes with processed IL-33 to coordinate
