caption: Hypothetic CLV3 signaling pathway model. As it is shown, CLV3 might be transmitted
  via at least three receptor complexes. The first one is that CLV1 monomer or CLV1
  homodimers. The second one is that CLV2-CRN heterodimers forming a tetramer through
  CRN-CRN interaction. In addition, CLV1, CLV2 and CRN may form complexes as the third
  and functional receptor complex.
