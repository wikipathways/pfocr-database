caption: Schematic representation of basic autophagy pathway. Upon deprivation of
  growth factors, increase in AMP level and pathogen infection lead to AMPK activation
  and subsequent inhibition of mTORC1 function. In contrast, in the presence of growth
  signals PI3K-AKT signaling pathway activates mTOR. Inhibition of mTORC1 results
  in activation of ULK complex, which phosphorylates Beclin-1, leading to VPS34 activation
  and initiation of phagophore formation. ULK functions in a complex with ULK1, ULK2,
  FIP200, ATG13 and ATG101, while VPS34 function within the PIK3C3 complex containing
  its regulatory subunit, VPS15, ATG14 and Beclin-1, which further recruits to WIPI
  and ATG2 for phagophore elongation. Several ATG proteins engage two evolutionarily
  conserved ubiquitin-like conjugation systems - ATG12-ATG5 and phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE)-conjugated LC3 (LC3-II) targeted to the pre-autophagosomal membrane. In the
  ATG12-ATG5 conjugation system, the complex further interacts with ATG16, where ATG7
  functions as an E1-like enzyme and ATG10 factions as an E2-like enzyme. In the other
  system, LC3 is first cleaved by a cysteine protease ATG4 to generate LC3-I, which
  is further conjugated with PE to form membrane bound LC3-II facilitated by ATG7
  and ATG3. The cytoplasmic damaged cargo is then ubiquitinated, captured by adaptor
  molecules - p62 or NBR1 and subsequently delivered to the phagophore membrane. Matured
  autophagosome then fuses with endolysosomal vesicles forming an autolysosome, where
  the cargo is degraded and provide nutrients. AMPK, AMP activated protein kinase;
  mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;
  PIK3C3, Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Type 3; LC3, microtubule-associated
  protein 1 light chain 3; Ub, ubiquitin; NBR1, neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1.
