caption: Model for the integration of PLC-mediated phosphoinositide lipid signaling
  in the regulation of the TTG2-dependent epidermal cell fate pathways. Green boxes
  indicate the TTG2 transcription factor and the co-regulated epidermal traits. In
  between is the PLC lipid signaling pathway with blue boxes indicating the cellular
  functions influenced by the various branches and signaling metabolites of the pathway.
  The regulation of such cellular functions are likely important for the development
  of trichomes and cells of the seed coat. PLC lipid signaling is therefore a possible
  mechanism for the regulation of cellular functions by which TTG2 controls epidermal
  development. The genetic interactions between TTG2 and AtPLC1 observed in this study
  suggests such a mechanism. This model provides a framework for further exploring
  the possible roles phosphoinositide lipid signaling in the TTG2-dependent epidermal
  cell fate pathways
