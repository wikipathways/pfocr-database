caption: Neurons. Nitric oxide (NO) is a major moderator of functional hyperemia.
  NO produced by neurons acts directly on VSMCs, leading to VSMC hyperpolarization
  and relaxation. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine released by neuronal
  activity can also act directly on VSMCs through purinergic P2XR and P2YR receptors
  resulting in constriction, or adenosine 2A receptors (A2R) resulting in relaxation,
  respectively. Neuronal-mediated large increases in extracellular [K+] activate VSMC
  voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), resulting in VSMCs intracellular [Ca2+]
  increases, leading to depolarization and contraction.Astrocytes. The role of astrocytes
  in neurovascular coupling to arterioles is controversial. Glutamate or ATP released
  from neurons are postulated to act on metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) or
  P2YR on astrocytes, respectively, to initiate 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent
  intracellular [Ca2+] increase, which has been shown by some studies to contribute
  to neurovascular coupling, but disputed by others. According to some studies, intracellular
  [Ca2+] rise launches signaling cascades in the astrocytes and release of vasoactive
  ions and molecules from astrocyte endfeet to VSMCs, mainly K+ ions from large conductance
  calcium- activated potassium channels (BKCa), arachidonic acid (AA), through phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2) pathway, and AA metabolic products epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EETs),
  and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), via cytochrome P450 (p450) and cyclooxygenase 1 (Cox1),
  respectively. Extracellular Ca2+ intake from transient receptor potential vanilloid
  channel 4 (TRPV4) provides another means of increasing intracellular [Ca2+]. Dashed
  lines and question marks indicate pathways for which there is limited or conflicting
  data in the literature.VSMCs. EETs and moderate increases in extracellular [K+]
  both act on VSMC potassium channels including BKCa and inward rectifier potassium
  channels (KIR), resulting in hyperpolarization and relaxation of the VSMCs (left).
  However, large increases in extracellular [K+] activate VGCCs, resulting in intracellular
  [Ca2+] increases leading to VSMCs depolarization and contraction (right). PGE2,
  which acts through prostaglandin EP4 receptors (EP4R) on VSMCs, generates cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from intracellular ATP, also producing hyperpolarization
  and relaxation. PGE2 levels can be modulated by extracellular lactate levels, which
  can block reuptake of PGE2 by prostaglandin transporters (PGT). Lactate levels depend
  on the oxygen content of the tissue. Conversely, AA taken in by VSMCs can be metabolized
  to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a potent VSMC depolarizer, resulting
  in VSMC contraction. NO released by neurons or endothelial cells can block VSMC
  20-HETE production, modulating VSMC contraction and favoring relaxation through
  facilitation of conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate
  (cGMP) via soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Adenosine released by neurons acts on
  A2R and blocks VSMC VGCC activation leading to VSMCs hyperpolarization and relaxation.
  In contrast, neuronal release of ATP to VSMCs P2XR and P2YR can increase intracellular
  [Ca2+], resulting in depolarization and contraction.Endothelium. Vasoactive compounds,
  including ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), acetylcholine
  (ACh), and bradykinin (BK), in the blood stream can bind their respective receptors
  (P2XR, P2YR, muscarinic M3R, and B2R) to initiate signaling pathways in endothelial
  cells similar to the pathways in astrocytes, with the addition of the diacyl-glycerol
  (DAG) AA pathway mediated by phospholipase C (PLC), generating vasoactive molecules
  that are released to VSMCs. Intracellular [Ca2+] increases initiated by receptor-mediated
  signaling of endothelium can produce endothelial AA, EETs, and prostacyclin (PGI2),
  which act on VSMCs similarly to PGE2, to generate VSMC hyperpolarization and relaxation.
  The intracellular [Ca2+] rise can also activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase
  (eNOS) leading to NO production, and endothelial KCa channels, releasing K+ that
  can act on VSMCs as well as hyperpolarizing the endothelium. Endothelial-derived
  hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) can also trigger VSMC hyperpolarization. Additionally,
  shear stress on the endothelial vessel walls and red blood cells (RBCs) due to blood
  flow triggers ATP release from RBCs and signaling pathways, including activation
  of endothelial eNOS, and direct production of AA and its metabolites. Endothelial
  and endothelial-VSMCs gap junctions (GJs) facilitate retrograde endothelial signal
  propagation and signaling to VSMCs.
