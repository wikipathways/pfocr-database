caption: An overview of various auto-reactive and non-autoreactive antibody targets
  found in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), ranging from ① anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs)
  to nuclear constituents. Additionally, autoantibodies to regulators and proteins
  important in antigen presentation are observed. Antibodies to the light chain ②
  beta-2 microglobulin of MHC class I molecules have been found. Furthermore, autoantibodies
  to ③ MHC class II invariant chain, known as CD74 (green), including its selective
  domain CLIP (red), which is bound to the groove of MHC class II molecules, have
  been observed. In addition, ④ CD74 may be membrane bound and act as a receptor for
  macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Besides the presence of antibodies
  reactive to antigen presenting molecules, antibodies towards ⑤ microbial agents
  are found, that display the potential to cross-react (red) with self-antigens (green).
  Furthermore, autoantibodies to regulators of bone metabolism are observed in AS,
  such as ⑥ osteoprogeterin, which negatively regulates of RANKL, ⑦ SIRT-1, a primarily
  nucleated enzyme that deacetylates transcription factors, ⑧ sclerostin, an inhibitor
  of bone formation, mainly produced by osteocytes, and ⑨ noggin, a protein antagonizing
  the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling pathway. Lastly, the formation of
  auto-reactive antibodies was detected towards ⑩ proteins that underwent post translational
  modification. Next to the aforementioned antibodies, unidentified targets have also
  been observed, such as reactivity to UH-axSpA peptides. This figure was created
