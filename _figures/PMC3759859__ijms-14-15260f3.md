caption: p53-induced cell cycle control and apoptosis. UV-induced DNA damage activates
  ATR, ATM and DNA-PK kinases, which via check point kinases Chk1/2 signal to activate
  p53 and DNA damage repair. Activated p53 transcriptionally regulates the cell cycle
  control protein p21 and several components of the pro-apoptotic pathway. Pro-apoptotic
  Bax, Bak, Noxa and PUMA proteins and additionally death receptors CD95 and DR5 become
  up-regulated while p53 trans-represses anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Moreover,
  p53 induces apoptosis by direct interaction with the mitochondrial membrane. UV-activated
  AKT inhibits p53 by activation of its regulator MDM2 and/or by inhibition of Chk1/2.
  Above that, by inhibition of Chk1/2 AKT may interfere with DNA damage repair and
  directly inhibit p21.
