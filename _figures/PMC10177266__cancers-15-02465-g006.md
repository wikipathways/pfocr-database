caption: 'A schematical diagram summarizes the molecular consequences of the association
  between Aurora kinase B and HPVE6 to cellular events, and treatment of AZD1152 can
  disrupt the oncogenic event mediated by the AurB-HPVE6 complex. (A). Aurora kinase
  B (AurB) is a kinase with its ATP acceptor site located at amino acid residue 120.
  Phosphorylation of AurB at amino acid residue threonine (T) 232 and/or T331 increases
  its kinase activity. AurB is also phosphorylated by Chk1 at T331. HPVE6 and AurB,
  independently, favor phosphorylation histone H3 at position serine (S) 28. AurB
  activates transcription factors specific to protein 1 (Sp1) and C-myc, which in
  turn leads to increased expression (indicated by the solid red arrow) of human telomerase
  reverse transcriptase (hTERT). E6 also has a role in increasing the hTERT protein
  level. While increased hTERT protein resulted in increased cell proliferation, hTERT
  also inhibited the Ras/MEK/ERK axis. (B). HPVE6 binds to AurB at the C-terminal
  end of E6 (residues 140 to 150). This interaction may result in altered protein
  conformation of Aur. This, in turn, results in the distortion of the ATP binding
  site within AurB. However, the phospho-status of AurB at T232 remains unaffected.
  In addition, the association between AurB and HPVE6 did not disrupt the ability
  of AurB to increase hTERT protein level and its telomerase activity, as well as
  the post-translational modification of histone H3: acetylation of histone H3 at
  residue lysine (K) 9 and phosphorylation of histone H3 at residues S10 and S28.
  In addition, the hindrance effect of hTERT on Ras/MEK/ERK expression is also overridden
  by the AurB-E6 complex, leading to increased expression of this key oncogenic signaling
  pathway. As the lesion progresses, the level of E6 protein increases. This will
  also increase the AurB protein level and activity, leading to cell immortalization,
  proliferation, and survival, with dysregulated cell division and formation of the
  eventual carcinoma. (C). Treatment with AZD1152, a potent and specific Aurora kinase
  B inhibitor, suppresses AurB activity and activates the apoptotic pathway. The treatment
  also can reduce hTERT protein level and its telomerase activity, halting HPV-mediated
  carcinogenesis, albeit the inhibitory effect occurs in a non-HPV-specific manner
  (indicated by dashed red arrows).'
