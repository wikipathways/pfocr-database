caption: NAD+biosynthetic pathways. De novo biosynthesis begins with the conversion
  of tryptophan (Trp) to N-L-formylkynurenine either by indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase
  (IDO) or tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). After four reaction steps, N-L-formylkynurenine
  can subsequently be converted to the unstable 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde
  acid, which can undergo nonenzymatic cyclization to quinolinic acid. The last step
  of de novo biosynthesis consists of the quinolinate-catalyzed phosphoribosyltransferase
  (QPRT) formation of NA mononucleotide (NaMN) using PRPP (5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate).
  The Preiss-Handler pathway is initiated by NA phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT)
  to form NaMN. Further, NAMN is converted into adenine dinucleotide NA (NAAD) by
  the enzymes NMN adenylyltransferase (NMNAT1-3) together with ATP. Finally, NAAD
  is converted to NAD+ via an amidation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme NAD+ synthase
  (NADSYN). The Core Recycling and Salvage Pathways are the shortest ways to synthesize
  NAD+ from NAM and NR (2 steps). NAM is converted by the rate-limiting nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) to form NMN using PRPP as a cosubstrate. NMN is
  also a product of NR phosphorylation by NR kinases (NRK1-2). The subsequent conversion
  of NMN to NAD+ is catalyzed by the NMNAT1-3 enzymes. Further, the synthesized NAD+
  is used in the work of such enzymes as sirtuins, PARPs, CD38/157. NR, nicotinamide
  riboside; NAM, nicotinamide; NMN, NAM mononucleotide; AFMID, kynurenine formamidase;
  KMO, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase; KYNU, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase; 3HAO, 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid oxygenase.
