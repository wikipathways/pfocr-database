caption: Schematic representation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway proposed for
  significant production of kaempferol and quercetin in different organisms. Naringenin
  is a substrate used by all the organisms using different enzymes for conversion
  to their respective products. (A) represents the proposed pathway in yeast using
  the N3COX gene converting naringenin into dihydrokaempferol. (B) shows the flavonoid
  pathway developed in microbes with the expression of the FMO and CPR gene catalyzing
  kaempferol into quercetin. (C) the flavonoid pathway in Arabidopsis shows that F3′H
  catalyzes dihydrokaempferol into dihydroquercetin while, (D) in Lotus, DFR converts
  dihydrokaempferol into kaempferol, instead of the FLS enzyme. (E) shows F3′H converting
  kaempferol into dihydroquercetin in blackberry and (F) is our proposed pathway for
  flavonoid synthesis in yeast using the rice F3H gene.
