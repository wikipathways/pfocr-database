caption: A summary of the pathways that are known to be impacted by high levels of
  miR-29c. MiR-29c-inhibited pathways are shown on the left (blue rectangles represent
  atrophy pathways and green rectangle relate to hypertrophic pathways). Please refer
  to [,] for more information. The present work shows that, despite the considerable
  increase in protein synthesis, components of the AKT/mTOR pathway are downregulated.
  The main results of miR-29c skeletal muscle overexpression are increased force and
  skeletal muscle development (for details see []). Created with BioRender.com.
