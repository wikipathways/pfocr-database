caption: Mechanisms involved in tubuloglomerular feedback control of renal vascular
  tone. Tubuloglomerular feedback is initiated when the filtered load of sodium chloride
  is increased to the macula densa resulting in increases of; sodium reabsorption
  via the sodium potassium 2 chloride exchanger (NaK2Cl), intracellular Na+, sodium
  potassium ATPase (NaK-ATPase) activity and intracellular Ca2+. These events trigger
  the release of ATP from the macula densa cells. ATP is converted to adenosine extracellularly
  and then acts on adenosine 1A receptors (A1AR) in the adjacent afferent arteriole
  to promote vasoconstriction. A1AR activates phospholipase C (PLC) via a GTP binding
  protein (Gi), the release of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).
  The subsequent activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2, formation of arachidonic
  acid (AA) and 20-HETE, as well as activation of protein kinase C (PKC), alters transient
  receptor potential channel (TRPC) and large conductance calcium activated potassium
  channel (BK) activities resulting in depolarization and activation of voltage gated
  calcium channels (VGCC) and Ca2+ influx. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ initiates
  contraction of the afferent arteriole, reduction in glomerular capillary pressure
  and filtered sodium chloride load. Activation of the angiotensin II receptor type
  I (AT1R) stimulates a similar transduction pathway to that shown in (Fig. 2) for
  the myogenic response. In addition, ATP and angiotensin II have been shown to be
  positive modulators of tubuloglomerular feedback through activation of G-protein
  coupled receptors, specifically purinergic receptor 2X (P2X) and angiotensin 1 receptor
  (AT1) via Gq to modulate PLC activity.
