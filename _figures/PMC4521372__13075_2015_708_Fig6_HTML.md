caption: Schematic hypothesis about interleukin (IL)-13 synthesis induced through
  Smad and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in response to transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β in T cells of patients with systemic sclerosis. TGF-β binds
  first to its type II receptor (TβRII), which then recruits and phosphorylates the
  type I receptor (TβRI), leading to activin receptor-like kinase (ALK5) activation
  within the receptor complex. The TβRI–TβRII complex then phosphorylates Smad 2/3
  proteins, which complex with Smad4 to accumulate in the nucleus and act as transcription
  factors of target genes. In the non-Smad pathway, the TβRI–TβRII complex transmits
  its signal through other factors, such as by the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (Ras-ERK) pathway, TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) and p38-MAPK pathways. Under activation, these factors translocate to the
  nucleus and regulate the expression of target genes. We observed that the upregulated
  IL-13 expression induced by TGF-β occurs via GATA-3 transcription factor modulation
  through Smad3 and p38-MAPK signaling pathways, which is reversed by the specific
  Smad3 inhibitor SIS3 or by the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580, respectively. Additionally,
  the ALK5-specific inhibition by SB431542 abolishes the TGF-β-induced Smad3 phosphorylation.
