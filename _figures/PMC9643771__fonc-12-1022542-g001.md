caption: The Cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase-Stimulator of Interferon Genes (cGAS/STING) Pathway
  Plays a Critical Role in Antitumor Immunity. Following DNA damaging events, DNA
  fragments enter the cytoplasm of cancer cells. This cytosolic DNA is then recognized
  by the cytoplasmic sensor cGAS, which can then produce cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Consequently,
  cGAMP promotes the recruitment of STING molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum,
  which leads to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylating interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3), and nuclear factor-κB (NF- κB). IRF3 and NF- κB then translocate
  to the nucleus to promote transcription of type I interferons, which can lead to
  an antitumor response via the promotion of T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.
