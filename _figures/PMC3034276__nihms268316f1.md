caption: The tripartite glutamatergic system and magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies
  in mood disorders. The glutamate (Glu)-glutamine (Gln) cycle plays a key role in
  the regulation of presynaptic and postsynaptic ionic and metabotropic glutamate
  receptors that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. In
  the brain, glutamate can either be synthesized de novo from glucose via the Krebs
  cycle and the transamination of α-oxoglutatrate or it can be recycled through the
  Glu/Gln cycle (see above). Glutamate is transported into synaptic vesicles by vesicular
  Glu transporters. Once released, Glu binds to and activates ionotropic and metabotropic
  receptors found throughout the central nervous system that have wide-ranging effects
  on neural excitability. There are three excitatory ionotropic receptors identified
  by their pharmacological properties as AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors. Metabotropic
  glutamate receptors couple to different signal transduction systems and ligand sensitivities.
  Glutamate is cleared from the extracellular space via high-affinity excitatory amino
  acid transporters in neighboring glial cells, which convert Glu into Gln via the
  action of glutamine synthetase. Glutamine is then transported back into the glutamatergic
  neuron where it is hydrolyzed by glutaminase back into Glu. AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic
  acid; BPD, bipolar disorder; 13C MRS, carbon-13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy;
  EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; Glx, glutamine plus glutamate; MDD, major
  depressive disorder; mGluR2/3, metabotropic glutamatergic receptor 2 and 3; NMDA,
