caption: Schematic representation of the regulatory cascade employed by BluR and Lon
  to control OmpF expression. In Escherichia coli, OmpF expression responds to environmental
  changes via complex regulatory networks. Our report described a novel pathway controlling
  OmpF synthesis at low temperature. The ycgZ-ymgABC operon, which transcription is
  controlled by the BluR-BluF system, encodes YcgZ, a protein highly unstable in the
  presence of the Lon protease. Increased amount of YcgZ leads to reduced transcription
  of ompF, consequently decreasing the amount of OmpF porin.
