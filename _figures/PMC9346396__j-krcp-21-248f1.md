caption: 'The complement system can be activated through three pathways: the classical
  pathway, the mannose-binding lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. The classical
  pathway is activated following recognition of immune complexes, and the lectin pathway
  is activated mainly by microbial surfaces, whereas the alternative pathway is spontaneously
  activated by the phenomenon of “tick-over.” The alternative pathway amplifies the
  response of the first two pathways. These pathways lead to the formation of a C3
  convertase, which cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b is then incorporated to form
  a C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. C3a and C5a are proinflammatory
  molecules. C5b, together with C6, C7, C8, and C9, leads to the formation of the
  membrane attack complex (MAC), which results in cells lysis.'
