caption: Model for PA transport and polymerization. PA regulatory transcription factors
  (TT factors) activate PA biosynthesis structural genes (TTs) in the nuclei of seed
  coat endothelial cells under appropriate conditions. PA pathway proteins are translocated
  to the cytosolic side of the ER for synthesis of epicatechin (white circles) and
  anthocyanins (red circles). These flavonoids can be compartmentalized in different
  ways. Epicatechin and anthocyanins are readily glycosylated, and the conjugates
  are transported into the vacuole by MATE (TT12) transporters. They could also be
  loaded into the ER membrane system or derived membrane vesicles, which are transported
  to the central vacuole through prevacuole compartment (PVC)-dependent vesicle trafficking,
  or else they could be bound to the TT19 GST, which facilitates their transport into
  the ER, vacuole, or other compartments. The acidic vacuolar conditions may facilitate
  nonenzymatic condensation of PA units, or the units may undergo enzymatic condensation
  catalyzed by TT10, with E3′G as a possible extension unit, or by yet unidentified
  proteins (red cylinders). After synthesis on the ER and modification by glycosylation
  in the Golgi, TT10 could be sorted and targeted within membrane vesicles that also
  contain epicatechin and other PA biosynthetic units. TT10 may also catalyze the
  condensation of PA units into oligomers (such as procyanidin B1 and B2) in the vesicles,
  which are transported to the vacuole, where PA chain elongation could be further
  catalyzed by TT10 using epicatechin glucoside and PA oligomers as substrates. PAs
  can also be transported through membrane vesicles or other mechanisms to the apoplastic
  space, where they are subjected to oxidative polymerization and further cross-linked
  with other cell wall components, catalyzed by apoplastic TT10-like polyphenol oxidases.
  Blue hexagons represent glycosylated moieties (epicatechin, membrane sterols, and
  TT10 protein).
