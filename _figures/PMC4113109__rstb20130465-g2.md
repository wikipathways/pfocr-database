caption: Hedgehog signalling at a glance. The dynamic localization pattern of the
  Hedgehog (Hh) signalling molecules correlates with the states of pathway activation.
  In the absence of Hh ligand, the Hh receptor Patched 1 (Ptch1) is enriched in cilia
  and the seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) is excluded from cilia and
  maintained into an inactive conformation. The Glioblastoma (Gli) transcription factors
  Gli2 and Gli3 enter cilia in complex with their partner and inhibitor Sufu (suppressor
  of Fused) and become processed into transcriptional repressors (GliR) either inside
  cilia or after exit from the cilia. In the presence of Hh ligand, Patched 1 disappears
  from the cilium and Smo accumulates in cilia in an active conformation. Active Smo
  somehow prevents the processing of Gli into GliR and promotes the formation of the
  transcriptional activator form of Gli (GliA). Many steps in the process remain mysterious,
  in particular how Patched 1 influences Smo activation and how Smo communicates to
  the Gli processing machinery. (Online version in colour.)
