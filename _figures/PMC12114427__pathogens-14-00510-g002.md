caption: 'The inducible expression pathway of Viperin. After viral infection: PAMPs,
  PPRs, and RLR are activated, which in turn activates the phosphorylation of transcription
  factors NF-κB and interferon regulatory factors IRF3 and IRF7, and induces the production
  of type I interferons. Interferons can bind to type I interferon receptors on the
  cell surface in a paracrine and autocrine manner. The dimerization of IFNAR subunits
  activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, ultimately inducing the formation of ISGF3.
  ISGF3 can directly bind to the ISRE and promote the transcription of Viperin. Viperin
  is also produced independently of the interferon pathway and is directly regulated
  by IRF1 or IRF3. The membrane glycoprotein glycoprotein B (GB) of HCMV can induce
  the phosphorylation of IRF3 and bind to the ISRE upstream of the Viperin promoter,
  thereby directly initiating its transcription. VSV infection stimulates IRF1 to
  bind to the two proximal ISREs of the Viperin promoter, activating its transcription.
  CHIKV infection also directly induces Viperin expression by activating MAVS and
  downstream IRF3'
