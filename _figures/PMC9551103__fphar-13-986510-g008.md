caption: Schematic diagram of LH011 in treating UC. In conclusion, current experimental
  results suggested that LH011 could improve DSS-induced mice colitis. On the one
  hand, LH011 decreased inflammatory response by inhibiting the TLR/NF-κB signaling
  pathway. On the other hand, LH011 enhanced anti-oxidant capacity by activating the
  Nrf2/Keap1/HO-1 signaling pathway.
