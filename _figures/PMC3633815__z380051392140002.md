caption: Schematic representation of the roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in pulmonary vascular
  remodeling. A) Increased levels of growth factors and vasoconstrictors and chronic
  hypoxia activate mTORC1, which, in turn, promotes cell growth and proliferation
  via S6K1-S6 signaling pathway. mTORC1 may also stimulate proliferation via inducing
  Ca2+ release (shown only for PAVSMCs). B) Growth factors, vasoconstrictors, and
  chronic hypoxia activate mTORC2, which stimulates PAVSMC proliferation and resistance
  to apoptosis by unknown mechanisms.
