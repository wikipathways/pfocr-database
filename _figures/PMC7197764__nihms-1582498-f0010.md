caption: (A) DpsC acts as an acyltransferase by transferring to starter unit such
  as prop-ionyl CoA to the ACP, while also being able to perform the initial chain
  elongation of the starter unit-loaded ACP with malonyi-CoA. This product is then
  used as an initial substrate by a ketosynthase chain length factor (KS/CLF) which
  undergoes eight rounds of elongation. Eventually the biosynthetic pathway ends with
  the generation of daunorubicin. (B) The carbonyl and oxetane groups have oxygen
  lone pairs that orient in the same direction, partly due to the C-O-C bond strain.
  (C) The mimic can be loaded onto phosphopantetheine (PPant), thus mimicking malonyi-PPant.
