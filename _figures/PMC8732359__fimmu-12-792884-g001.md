caption: The potential mechanisms of lncRNAs in SLE and RA. (A) lncRNA NEAT1 is overexpressed
  in G-MDSCs and induces the promotion of G-MDSCs on IFN-I signaling activation of
  B cells, contributing to the pathogenesis of SLE; lnc5150 and GAS5 in serum participate
  in the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway, and promote the inflammatory response
  of SLE; lncRNA YPEL4 in serum promotes the onset of SLE through FcγR-mediated phagocytosis;
  lncRNA NEAT1 in PBMCs affects the expression of inflammatory mediators through activating
  the MAPK signaling pathway; lncRNA MALAT1 is overexpressed in PBMCs and can modulate
  the SIRT1 pathway directly, then promote the inflammatory response of SLE; lncRNA
  GAS5 in CD4+ T cells can upregulate E4BP4 by inhibiting miR-92a-3p and attenuating
  the self-reactivity of CD4+ T cells, playing a protective role in SLE; LincRNA00892
  can activate CD4+ T by targeting hnRNP K and subsequently up-regulating the expression
  of CD40L, thereby playing a pathogenic role in SLE; lncRNA MALAT1 in CD4+ T cells
  can participate in type I interferon-mediated SLE by up-regulating OAS2, OAS3 and
  OASL. (B) lncRNA NEAT1 shuttled by PBMC-derived exosomes plays critical role in
  the development of RA by acting as a ceRNA for miR144-3p to restrict its function,
  and thus increase the expression of the miR144-3p-targeted gene ROCK2; lncRNA GAS5
  in the serum of patients with RA activates the AMPK pathway; lncRNA MEG3 acts as
  ceRNA to inhibit inflammation by down-regulating AKT/mTOR signaling pathways; lncRNA
  HIX003209 in LPS-treated chondrocytes promotes the proliferation and activation
  of macrophages by modulating the inhibitory effect of the IκBα/NF-κB signaling pathway;
  lncRNA HOTAIR inhibits the activation of NF-κB in chondrocytes and reduce inflammation
  of RA; lncRNA-H19 acts as the ceRNA of miR-124a to inhibit the proliferation and
  invasion of RASF; lncRNA ITSN1-2 inhibits the NOD2/RIP2 signaling pathway and reduces
  the proliferation and inflammation of RA-FLS; GAS5 in FLS acts as a ceRNA to directly
  target miR-222-3p, upregulates the expression of Sirt1 and inhibits the proliferation
  and inflammation of RA; lncRNA XIST can inhibit the proliferation of SFs by promotion
  of of miR-126-3p/NF-κB pathway, thereby playing a protective role in RA; lncRNA
  ZNF667-AS1 is overpressed in RA-FLS, which plays a protective role in RA by sponging
  miR-523-3p and thus inactivation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway; LncRNA LERFS is
  lowly expressed in RA-FLS and can promote synovial aggression and joint destruction
  by interacting with hnRNP Q; lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 can promote the proliferation and
  invasion of RA-FLS through regulating the miR-331-3p/PIAS3 pathway; lncRNA linc00152
  is up-regulate in RA-FLS, which can promote TAK1 expression by targeting miR-103a
  and thus activate the NF-κB pathway; lncRNA AL928768.3 and lnc-AC091493.1 can regulate
  their target mRNAs (e.g., SDC1, LTB), and thus implicate in the abnormal immune
  response of RA or promote the proliferation of FLS via multiple pathways in patients
  with RA. Also, transcription factor YY1 can promote linc00152 expression directly,
  and thus forming a linc00152/NF-κB feedback loop, which can promote RA-FLS inflammation.
