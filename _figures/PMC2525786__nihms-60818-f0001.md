caption: Macrolides and anthracyclines are clinically important drugs produced by
  streptomycetes. Both classes of natural products contain aminosugar moieties that
  are attached by glycosyltransferases (Gtfs) at a late stage in the biosynthetic
  pathway and are essential for biological activity (). These Gtfs are potentially
  useful for the combinatorial biosynthesis or chemoenzymatic synthesis of structurally
  novel compounds with new biological activities. For many years, however, all attempts
  to reconstitute the activity of these Gtfs in vitro failed. Then, in 2004, Liu and
  coworkers reported that DesVII, a TDP-D-desosaminyl tranferase involved in pikromycin
  biosynthesis, requires the presence of an “auxiliary protein”, DesVIII, encoded
  in the same gene cluster, to catalyze glycosyltransfer in vitro, although the role
  of DesVIII was not clear. Walsh and coworkers subsequently reported that AknS, a
  Gtf involved in the glycosylation of aklavinone, requires the presence of the DesVIII
  homolog, AknT, to effect glycosyltransfer in vitro. Walsh and coworkers proposed
  that AknT functions as a regulatory subunit that increases the catalytic activity
  of AknS by influencing substrate affinity. There is precedent for this hypothesis
  because a well-characterized eukaryotic glycosyltransferase, β-1,4-galactosyltransferase,
  contains a regulatory subunit that alters substrate affinity and selectivity.
