caption: Acupuncture affects glial activation. EA down-regulated the neuronal chemokine
  CX3CL1 and prevented the p38 MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, leading to reduced release
  of TNF-α and IL-1β, BDNF, PGE2. Released IL-1β and TNF-α acts on spinal dorsal horn
  neurons to enhance the neuronal excitability and inflammatory response. PGE2 and
  BDNF bind to spinal cord neuronal EP2 and Trk B, respectively, inducing a change
  in their excitatory state and thus causing neuropathic pain. EA induced an increase
  in adenosine levels in the spinal cord, which in turn activated astrocyte A1Rs to
  produce an analgesic effect. Additionally, analgesic effect of acupuncture was mediated
  in part through inhibiting the activation of JNK and promoting the release of IL10
  in astrocytes.
