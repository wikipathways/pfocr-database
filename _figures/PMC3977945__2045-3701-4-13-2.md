caption: Schematic diagram of the simplified phosphorylation-mediated regulation of
  the core Wnt/β-catenin pathway components. Phosphorylation of LRP6 at T1479 by CK1γ
  and at S1490 by GSK3 and Grk5/6 promotes Wnt signaling. Dvl phosphorylation mediated
  by RIPK4 and CK1ϵ is essential for Wnt signaling. Phosphorylation of Axin at S497/S500
  by GSK3 is suppressed by Wnt ligand, resulting in reduced association with LRP6
  and β-catenin. C-terminal phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA inhibits its ubiquitination
  and thus promotes β-catenin signaling activity. TNIK phosphorylates TCF4 to activate
  its transcriptional activity. NLK and HIPK2 phosphorylate TCF/LEF factors to inhibit
  their interaction with DNA.
