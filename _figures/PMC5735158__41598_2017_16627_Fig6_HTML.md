caption: Dynamic enrichment analysis identifies context relevant higher level SCPs
  emerging from interactions of level-3 SCPs. Three case studies using experimental
  high throughput datasets from literature were used to demonstrate the ability of
  the MBC Ontology to identify SCPs relationships that give rise to the whole cell
  function that was studied in each case. SCP units were generated by merging any
  two or three level-3 SCPs that were related to each other based on the top 25% predicted
  SCP relationships and contained at least one experimentally perturbed gene. The
  merged SCPs were added to the original level-3 SCPs and the experimental data was
  analyzed for enrichment analysis using the extended set of level-3 SCPs and Fisher’s
  exact test. All level-3 SCPs (blue rectangles and diamonds) that were among the
  top 5 predictions (either as a single SCP or as an SCP unit) were connected with
  each other based on all predicted SCP-SCP relationships (dashed black lines). The
  largest SCP network was kept and assigned to a context specific higher level SCP
  (open [unspecified level] or light red [level-2] octagon). Annotated level-1 grandparents
  (dark red rectangles) and level-2 parents (light red rectangles) were added to demonstrate
  that the combined level-3 SCPs belong to different SCP families. Arrows connect
  parent SCPs with their children SCPs. Blue lines encircle level-3 SCPs that were
  identified as part of a new merged SCP unit. Squares indicate level-1 to level-3
  SCPs that were identified by the original taxonomy. Diamonds indicate level-1 to
  level-3 SCPs that were only identified by the dynamic enrichment approach that enables
  extension of the original taxonomy. (A) Dynamic enrichment analysis identifies the
  inferred context relevant higher-level SCP Protein proofreading and degradation
  as the major disease mechanism that reduces CFTR activity at the plasma membrane
  in cystic fibrosis. (B) The two major parts of the Secretory pathway were identified
  as a major requirement for secretion. (C) Transcription associated DNA re-arrangements
  were identified as a major mechanism by which erlotinib might increase sensitivity
  of breast cancer cells to doxycyclin. In this case including the top 26% (instead
  of 25%) predicted SCP relationships increases the size of the SCP-network that is
  related to the identified whole-cell function (at a 25% threshold the network contained
  the SCP Focal adhesion organization that was connected to the SCP Thyroid hormone
  receptor signaling instead of the SCPs Histone methylation and demythelation and
  Transcription regulation by chromatin remodeling). (D) Cell cortical actin filament
  dynamics were predicted to be responsible for reduction in colony formation activity
  of erlotinib treated breast cancer cells. See also Supplementary Fig.  D/E, 22 D/E
  and 23 D/H/I.
