caption: Chosen features of ROS/RNS metabolism during the COVID-19 in comparison to
  other viral infections. Nox 2, as the reactive oxygen species source, has been reported
  to be increased in COVID-19 patients [], and, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the antimalarial
  drug, was demonstrated to inhibit Nox2 activity []. Nox increased activity is also
  a common feature of EBV and influenza virus infection, and Nox2 inhibition in IV
  infection lowers viral burden. On the basis of feedback, viruses (HRSV, HRV, and
  SeV), cause ROS induction via Nox2 [, –, ]. In serum of COVD-19 patients, inflammatory
  cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) were increased, possibly taking part in the initiation
  of mitochondrial ROS production [, ] (thick grey lines). Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
  protease–3CLpro has been shown to act through mitochondrial ROS, inducing NF-κB
  signal transduction pathway []. This pathway is closely related to many other viral
  infections, e.g., SeV, HRV, IV, and SARS-Cov (via S protein) [–, ]. The latter virus,
  by induction of ROS, and subsequent generation of oxidized phospholipids, may not
  only modulate the severity of acute lung injury but also directly induce inflammatory
  cytokine production in macrophages [] (black, dotted line). Mitochondria are proved
  to be important ROS source in rubella and HBV infection [, ], as they induce ROS
  production, either directly, or via viral N protein (in case of rubella, black thick
  lines).
