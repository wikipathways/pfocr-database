caption: Overview of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Calcium homeostasis is maintained
  by the influx and efflux of Ca2+ through calcium channels and pumps located on the
  plasma membrane, as well as membranes of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and endo-lysosomes. The cytoplasm, extracellular
  space, and each organelle have unique resting Ca2+ concentrations that have been
  indicated. Extracellular Ca2+ is transported into the cytosol through different
  channels such as transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, purinergic receptor
  (P2X) channels, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) channels, Piezo mechanosensitive
  channels, ionotropic glutamate receptor channels (e.g. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors,
  NMDARs), and voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels. Ca2+ is removed from the cytosol
  to the extracellular space by plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) efflux pumps
  and sodium-calcium exchangers (NCX). Activation of cell surface transmembrane receptors
  with tyrosine-based activation motifs (RTK e.g. B-cell and T-cell receptors) or
  G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR e.g. neurokinin-1 receptor) activate phospholipase
  C (PLC). PLC hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) located in
  the plasma membrane which generates two second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds to IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) located on
  the ER membrane leading to the release of Ca2+ from the ER and DAG activates protein
  kinase C (PKC). Depletion of ER Ca2+ activates stromal interaction molecules STIM1-STIM2
  (located in the ER membrane), which then activates Orai1-Orai3 channels (located
  in the plasma membrane) to induce Ca2+ influx into the cytosol. This mechanism is
  called store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Ryanodine receptors (RYRs) represent
  an alternative pathway for Ca2+ release from the ER regulated by Ca2+, Mg2+ and
  other molecules including ATP, calmodulin and CaMKII. The Ca2+ concentration in
  the ER is replenished via sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2b (SERCA2b)
  pump. The influx of Ca2+ from the ER to mitochondria occurs through voltage-dependent
  anion channels (VDAC) and mitochondrial calcium uniport (MCU) located in high numbers
  within mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) (insert a). Ca2+ leaves mitochondria
  mostly through Na+/Ca2+/Li+ exchanger (NCLX). Ca2+ stored in the endo-lysosomes
  is mobilized mostly by two-pore channels (TPC) and transient receptor potential
  mucolipin (TRPML) channels in response to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NAADP.) TRPML1 is involved in the mitochondrial-lysosomal contact sites (Mit-Lys),
  facilitating Ca2+ transfer to mitochondria through VDAC and MCU (insert b). Multiple
  effector molecules mediate effects of Ca2+signaling including PKC, Raf-MAPK (mitogen-activated
  protein kinase)-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), calmodulin, calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinases (e.g. CaMKII), and calcineurin. These signaling molecules influence
  gene expression through transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB),
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), and
  nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT).
