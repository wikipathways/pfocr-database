caption: In tumor epithelial cells, glucocorticoids are converted to inactive 11-keto-forms,
  reducing glucocorticoid receptor activity, while 11βHSD2 inhibition leads to increased
  levels of epithelial intracellular active glucocorticoid. The susequent inhibition
  of the COX-2 pathway and induction of G1 cell cycle arrest through activation of
  tetinoblastoma protein (Rb, a tumor suppressor) and inhibition of the mTOR pathway
  lead to inhibition of colorectal tumorigenesis.
