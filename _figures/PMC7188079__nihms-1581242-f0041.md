caption: The transporter activity of PepT1 is driven by the electrochemical proton
  gradient established by the apical Na+/H+ antiporter for the pH balance from the
  peptide-transport-induced intracellular acid load (center cell). This mechanism
  depends on the basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase (right cell). The uptake of di- and tripeptides
  will occur rapidly and they will be hydrolyzed in the cytosol, free amino acids
  will be released into the blood stream by different amino acid transporters located
  in the basolateral membrane. PepT1 transport of bacterial di- and tripeptides in
  the lumen, such as N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), muramyl dipeptide
  (MDP), and L-Ala-γ-D-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid (tri-DAP), into the intestinal
  epithelial cells (left cell). Due to the accumulation of bacterial di- and tripeptides,
  the NFkB pathway is stimulated leading to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines.
  Di- and tripeptides are common substrates cotransported with protons by PepT1.
