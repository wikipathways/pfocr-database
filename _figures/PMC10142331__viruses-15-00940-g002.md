caption: SFTSV mediates cell cycle, apoptosis, and the cGAS-STING pathway to achieve
  immune escape. The main mechanism by which the SFTSV influences the host cell pathway
  is depicted in this picture. (1) NSs inhibit host cell cycle protein CDK1 to achieve
  viral replication. (2) SAFA recruits and promotes activation of the STING–TBK1 signaling
  axis against SFTSV infection; (3) NSs induce BECN-1-dependent autophagy by breaking
  the BECN1–BCL2 linkage and complete virus replication.
