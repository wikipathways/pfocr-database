caption: Three pathways lead to activation of complement. The Classical Pathway is
  initiated by complexes of IgM, IgG1, or IgG3 with antigens. This activates proteolysis
  of C1 that cleaves C4 and C2 to form the classical pathway C3 convertase. The Mannose
  Lectin Pathway is activated by interaction of mannan-containing microbes with MBL,
  which activates MASP-1 and MASP-2 to cleave C4 and C2, again forming a C3 convertase.
  The Alternative Pathway is initiated by interactions between microbial antigens
  and inhibitory complement regulatory proteins. This permits autoactivation of the
  pathway in which C3 interacts with factor B and factor D to generate the alternative
  pathway C3 convertase. These convertases all cleave C3 to generate the anaphylatoxic
  C3a fragment and depositing C3b on the activating microbial particle or immune complex.
  This opsonizes the particle for phagocytosis and initiates the activation of the
  membrane attack complex. The C5a fragment that is proteolytically released from
  C5 also is a highly anaphylatoxic molecule that induces intense local inflammation.
