caption: Signaling mechanisms involved in lifespan regulation and the cellular response
  to genotoxic stress. (A) Signals promoting growth and survival (yellow portion of
  the cell). IGF-1 is secreted primarily by the liver in response to growth hormone
  and is the key mediator of its growth-promoting effects. IGF-1 binds its cell surface
  receptor IGF-1R, a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates numerous substrates including
  SHC, which then recruits the adaptor protein GRB2 and activates the RAS-MAPK pathway,
  which stimulates cell proliferation and differentiation. A second key substrate
  is IRS-1, which leads to activation of the serine-threonine kinase AKT via PI3-kinase
  (PI3K). AKT promotes cell survival by directly phosphorylating and inhibiting pro-apoptotic
  factors including caspase-9, BAD and FOXO transcription factors. AKT also phosphorylates
  a subunit of IKK leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which
  drives expression of pro-survival genes. AKT inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis by
  phosphorylating and activating MDM2, an E3-ubiquitin ligase that polyubiquitinates
  p53, targeting it for proteosomal degradation. AKT also phosphorylates the TSC complex,
  allowing activation of mTOR. mTOR is a PI3K-like kinase that resides in multiprotein
  complexes. mTORC1 positively regulates growth by directly phosphorylating and inhibiting
  4E-BP, causing it to release its binding partner eIF-4E, which then binds mRNA caps,
  the rate limiting step in protein translation. mTOR also negatively regulates autophagy
  and activates S6K, which promotes ribosomal maturation and growth. Decreased expression
  of the growth promoting factors IGF-1, IGF-1R, PI3K, AKT, TOR, e1F4E or S6K leads
  to lifespan extension in at least one model organism (yeast, worms, flies or mice).(B)
  Pro-apoptotic signaling in response to genotoxic stress (blue portion of cell).
  DNA double strand breaks are sensed by the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, which
  in turn activates the signal transducer ATM. ATM is a PI3K-like kinase with numerous
  protein targets. ATM phosphorylation of the transcription factor p53 leads to its
  stabilization and activation, promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. ATM also
  phosphorylates IKKγ, the regulatory subunit of IKK, causing its translocation to
  the cytoplasm, activating IKK, which phosphorylates IκB. Phosphorylation of IκB
  leads to its polyubiquitination and proteosomal degradation, releasing NF-κB transcription
  factor, which moves to the nucleus and in response to genotoxic stress increases
  expression of pro-apoptotic genes. A third substrate of ATM is the transcription
  factor E2F1, which among other things induces expression of the histone deacetylase
  SIRT1. SIRT1 deacetylates numerous non-histone substrates including KU70 and FOXO
  transcription factors, leading to their activation and inhibition of apoptosis.
  SIRT1 also deacetylates p53 and NF-κB, causing their inactivation and dampening
  of pro-apoptotic signals. Hyperactivity of the pro-apoptotic factor p53 accelerates
  aging and NF-κB is associated with old age. Deletion of SIRT1 extends lifespan in
  metazoans and appears to delay aging in mammals, consistent with it being primarily
  growth promoting.
