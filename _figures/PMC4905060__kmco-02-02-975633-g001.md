caption: Molecular mechanisms of oncogenic RAS-induced senescence. The numerous pathways
  of oncogenic RAS-induced senescence converge on common effectors, such as p53 and
  p16, to execute the senescence response. On one hand, oncogenic RAS activates the
  ERK MAPK pathway and promotes the transcriptional upregulation of p16 and senescence.
  Several pathways downstream of oncogenic RAS have been shown to activate p53. In
  addition to increased p16 transcription, the ERK MAPK pathway can lead to transcriptional
  upregulation of p14/19ARF and activation of the DNA damage response, both shown
  to activate p53. Similarly, expression of oncogenic RAS activates the p38 MAPK pathway
  and PRAK, which has been shown to phosphorylate and activate p53. Importantly, RAS
  also leads to activation of a NADPH oxidase and the generation of ROS in a PI3K-dependent
  mechanism. ROS contribute to the stabilization and activation of the tumor suppressor
  p53, which in turn leads to the transcription of p21, a mediator of p53-induced
  cell-cycle arrest. Reversible oxidation and inactivation of PTP1B prevents it from
  keeping AGO2 in an active, microRNA-loaded state. Hence, ROS-mediated inhibition
  of PTP1B and AGO2 allows the transcription of p21 and the onset of senescence. (Modified
  from DeNicola and Tuveson). AGO2, argonaute 2; ERK, extracellular-signal regulated
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  PRAK, p38 regulated/activated kinase; PTP1B, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species.
