caption: 'Schematic metabolic model showing important pathways after proliferation
  of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 in porcine blood (A) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
  (B). This model is based on the genome annotation of S. suis serotype 2 strain P1/7.
  Important differentially expressed genes found in our study are depicted by colored
  boxes. Red boxes and green boxes indicate lower- and higher-expressed genes compared
  to growth in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB), respectively; black boxes indicate that no
  differential expression was observed. Metabolic pathways are highlighted in different
  colors and are simplified: dark green, Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway (glycolysis);
  blue, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP); light purple, glycogen metabolism; red, pyruvate
  metabolism; brown, incomplete tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle; orange, Leloir pathway;
  yellow, pyrimidine metabolism; light green, purine metabolism; pink, amino acid
  metabolism. For additional information on gene annotations and metabolite abbreviations
  used, see .'
