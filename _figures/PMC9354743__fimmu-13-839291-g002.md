caption: The regulatory role of m6A modification in HSCs, and T and B lymphocytes.
  In the HSCs, METTL3 and YTHDF2 promote endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT)
  via Notch1a leading to HSC generation. METTL3 and METTL14 enhance the ability of
  HSC self-renewal through MYC, whereas YTHDF2 inhibits HSC self-renewal by promoting
  the decay of mRNA encoding transcription factors, including TAL1, GATA2, RUNX1,
  and STAT5. MPP, multipotent progenitor cells; CMP, common myeloid progenitors; CLP,
  common lymphoid progenitors. In CD4+ T cells, METTL3 and METTL14 promote naive CD4+
  T-cell proliferation by the IL-7/STAT5/SOCS pathway. Meanwhile, METTL3 promotes
  the differentiation of Th1 and Tfh cells, but represses Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation.
  METTL14 promotes Tregs differentiation, and METTL3/14 is essential for the suppressive
  function of Tregs. However, the exact roles of m6A modification in CD8+ T cells
  is unknown. In B cells, YTHDF2 and RBM15 promote pro-B-to-large-pre-B transition,
  and METTL14 promotes the transition from large pre-B cells to small pre-B cells
  via increasing chromatin accessibility of key transcription factors loci (Ikzf3,
  Irf4, Spib, and Bcl6). However, loss of METTL14 did not affect IgH recombination,
  but might impair the expression of recombined IgH. IGF2BPs promote the differentiation
  of MZB and FoB by enhancing the stability of B-cell regulators Pax5 and Arid3a mRNA.
