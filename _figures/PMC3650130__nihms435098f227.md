caption: Recently, Anderson and co-workers described cycloisomerization of O-allyl
  oximes into pyrroles catalyzed by the Ir(I)/Ag(I)-combined system. This reaction
  represents a transition metal catalyzed version of the Trofimov reaction, where
  o-vinyl oximes are cyclized under strongly basic conditions.O-allyl oximes are more
  stable precursors then the corresponding O-vinyl oximes and, therefore, are more
  convenient starting materials. Thus, cycloisomerization of α-cyano substituted O-allyl
  oximes 3-156 gives 2,3,4-trisubstituted pyrroles 3-157 in good yields. The reaction
  proceeds via a successive isomerization of α-cyano O-allyl oxime 3-156 into O-vinyl
  oxime 3-158, followed by a facile tautomerization and formation of intermediate
  3-159. A subsequent [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement leads to the 1,4-imino aldehyde
  3-160, which undergoes cyclocondensation into 2,3,4-trisubstituted pyrrole 3-157.
  On the other hand, in the case of O-allyl oximes, containing other α-substituents
  (H, Alk, Ar), the reaction starts with the formation of O-vinyl oxime 3-158a, which
  is not prone to [3,3] rearrangement due to the high enolization barrier. A [1,3]
  rearrangement of O-vinyl oxime 3-158a into the iminoaldehyde 3-162 occurs instead.
  A subsequent nucleophilic cylization affords regioisomeric 2,3,5-trisubstituted
  pyrrole 3-161. In the case of α-aryl or α-carbmehoxy O-allyl oximes 3-165 the reaction
  can be driven to the 1,2,5-trisubstituted pyrroles 3-164 by addition of a base,
  which facilitates imine-enamine tautomerization, followed by a subsequent [3,3]
  rearrengment pathway (). Therefore, the regioselectivity of pyrrole formation in
  this transformation can be controlled by either the nature of the α-substituent
  or by addition of a base.
