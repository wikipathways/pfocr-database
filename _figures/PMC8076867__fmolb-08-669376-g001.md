caption: Cotranslational recognition of nascent Sec substrate proteins by the SRP
  or SecA allows cells to avoid the existence of cytoplasmic intermediates. Nascent
  Sec substrates are recognized by ribosome-bound SRP or SecA. (A) In translationally
  coupled translocation (CT), the SRP recognizes the targeting signal of a subset
  of Sec substrates (primarily IMPs) from an early stage in protein synthesis. The
  SRP targets the translating ribosome to SecYEG by interacting with its receptor
  protein FtsY at the membrane, which results in the binding of the translating ribosome
  to SecYEG and direct coupling of translocation to protein synthesis. (B) Sec substrates
  that fail to be recognized by the SRP are targeted for translationally uncoupled
  translocation (UT) by SecA. SecA recognizes the targeting signal of a nascent Sec
  substrate when it is about 120 amino acids from the peptidyl transferase site in
  the ribosome. SecA then recruits SecB to the nascent chain. Upon recruitment of
  SecB, nascent substrates of the UT pathway can either engage SecYEG cotranslationally
  or can be held in a translocation-competent conformation by the “Inhibit” branch
  of the quality control network.

  description: Cotranslational recognition of nascent Sec substrate proteins by the
    SRP or SecA allows cells to avoid the existence of cytoplasmic intermediates.
    Nascent Sec substrates are recognized by ribosome-bound SRP or SecA. (A) In translationally
    coupled translocation (CT), the SRP recognizes the targeting signal of a subset
    of Sec substrates (primarily IMPs) from an early stage in protein synthesis. The
    SRP targets the translating ribosome to SecYEG by interacting with its receptor
    protein FtsY at the membrane, which results in the binding of the translating
    ribosome to SecYEG and direct coupling of translocation to protein synthesis.
    (B) Sec substrates that fail to be recognized by the SRP are targeted for translationally
    uncoupled translocation (UT) by SecA. SecA recognizes the targeting signal of
    a nascent Sec substrate when it is about 120 amino acids from the peptidyl transferase
    site in the ribosome. SecA then recruits SecB to the nascent chain. Upon recruitment
    of SecB, nascent substrates of the UT pathway can either engage SecYEG cotranslationally
    or can be held in a translocation-competent conformation by the “Inhibit” branch
    of the quality control network.
