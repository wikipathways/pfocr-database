caption: Diagram of the mechanism of regulating atherosclerosis of LRP1 in VSMCs and
  macrophages. (A) LRP1 in VSMCs could degrade extracellular PDFGBB, MMPs, t-PA, and
  FVIII, which are atherogenic factors, in the way of endocytosis to play the role
  of anti-atherosclerosis. It could inhibit migration and proliferation of VSMCs to
  resist atherosclerosis by preventing the activation of TGFβ/Smad2/3/PDGFRβ signaling
  pathway. Gleevec could also has the effect to inhibit PDGFRβ. Additionally, LRP1
  inhibit the activation of ERK1/2 which could suppresses the expression of ABCA1
  by promoting phosphorylation of cPLA2. In contrast, LRP1 in VSMCs accelerates the
  development of atherosclerosis by promoting the uptake of aggLDL and the formation
  of foam cells. (B) The LRP1 can also be cleaved by γ-secretase to release a 25-kDa
  β-chain fragment, which translocates to the nucleus to suppress inflammatory gene
  expression. The phosphorylation of NPxY of LRP1 ICD promotes the expression of ABCA1.
  Nevertheless, LRP1 in macrophages accelerates the development of atherosclerosis
  by promoting the uptake of aggLDL and the formation of oxidized LDL. AS, atherosclerosis,
  ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2.
