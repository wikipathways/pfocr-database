caption: Proposed biological network of differentially expressed genes in sepsis.
  By use of PathwayStudio, a pathway network was built for microarray data based on
  previously reported interactions in the literature. The links and nodes represent
  literature-based findings. Some of the prominent, differentially expressed genes
  shared in inflammatory and immune response in sepsis were used to create the network.

  line ending with | depicts negative regulation/expression. Up- and downregulated
  genes are indicated in red and green, respectively. IL1RN, interleukin-1 receptor
  antagonist; S100A9, S100 calcium binding protein A9 (calgranulin B); CAMP, cathelicidin
  antimicrobial peptide; GRO2, growth-related oncogene 2 (CXCL2); GRO3, growth-related
  oncogene 3 (CXCL3); PGLYRP, peptidoglycan recognition protein; TLR, toll-like receptor;
  LBP, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; HSP1A, heat shock protein 1A.
