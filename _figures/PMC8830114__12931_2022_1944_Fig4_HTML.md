caption: A ARDS (and mechanical ventilation) associated with COVID-19 seems to be
  largely responsible for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This pathway seems
  to be ARDS related and not COVID-19 (SARS CoV2 virus infection) specific. B Overview
  of SARS-CoV-2 entry, infection and endothelial inflammation and cell death. As is
  well established, oral nasopharyngeal entry of SARS-CoV-2 is followed by its binding
  to the alveolar epithelium. The infected pneumocytes secrete cytokine and chemokines,
  which attract neutrophils to the alveolar space, leading to a possible breach of
  the alveolar wall. Meanwhile, endothelial cells overexpress NLRP3 as we observed
  in the autopsies (either by infection, or via increased amounts of chemokines and
  cytokines). The NLRP3 pathway drives endothelial pyroptosis. This leads to breakdown
  of the endothelial-alveolar barrier and causes interstitial and alveolar space flooding.
  Endothelial cell death and debris activate coagulation cascades that promotes thrombi
  formation
