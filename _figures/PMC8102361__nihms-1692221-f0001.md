caption: GHRHAnt activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), which in turn induces
  P53. That tumor suppressor possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities
  in the lungs, suppresses generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhances
  endothelial barrier integrity via Rac1-mediated cofilin deactivation and the suppression
  of filamentous actin (F-actin). The latter event is mediated through the blocking
  of the Ras homolog family member A (RhoA)/myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) pathway. Thus,
  GHRHAnt oppose the endothelial barrier dysfunction (EBD) due to lung hyperpermeability.
  This feature is the hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
