caption: 'Icariin-targeted genes related to the top 5 shared KEGG pathways. (A) Icariin-targeted
  genes related to Toll-like receptor pro-inflammatory signaling: (1) PI3K-Akt signaling,
  (2) NF-kB, and (3) MAPK signaling pathway. (B) Icariin-targeted genes related to
  Adipocytokine signaling, and insulin resistance. (C) Icariin-targeted genes related
  to Neurotrophin signaling regulating cell survival and apoptosis. (4) JNK signaling
  pathway is involved in the process. (D) Icariin-targeted genes related to NOD-like
  receptor signaling pathway. (2) NF-kB, and (3) MAPK signaling pro-inflammatory pathways
  are involved. (E) Icariin-targeted genes related to B cell receptor signaling. (2)
  NF-kB pathway is involved, regulating B cell ontogeny, autoimmunity anergy, and
  immune responses.'
