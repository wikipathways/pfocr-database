caption: The relationship between TME and radiotherapy tolerance in cervical cancer
  (A) Radiation-induced activation of TGF-β, CSF-1, and HIF-1α in the TME promotes
  M1 macrophage differentiation into M2 phenotype, promoting abnormal angiogenesis,
  and enhancing radiotherapy resistance. (B) HPV16/18 infection activates the IL-6/STAT3
  pathway through E6 protein, increasing IL-6 secretion and inducing senescence in
  CAFs through paracrine signaling. (C) Senescent CAFs secrete additional IL-6 that
  activates STAT3 in fibroblasts through an autocrine mechanism, enhancing cervical
  cancer resistance to radiotherapy. (D) Irradiated fibroblasts may enhance cancer
  cell invasiveness and promote EMT, thereby increasing radiation resistance. (E)
  SEPT9 targets the HMGB1-Rb pathway, facilitating M1 macrophage differentiation into
  M2 phenotype, promoting abnormal angiogenesis, and enhancing radiotherapy resistance.
