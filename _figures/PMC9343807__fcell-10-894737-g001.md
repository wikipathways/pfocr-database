caption: The Hippo signaling pathway. Major mammalian Hippo signaling pathway components.
  When the Hippo pathway is active, MST1/2 activates and phosphorylates MOB1A/B and
  LATS1/2, and activated LATS1/2 phosphorylates YAP and TAZ. Phosphorylated YAP/TAZ
  is sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3 protein and is degraded by
  β-TrCP. In the absence of Hippo signaling, inactive LATS1/2 cannot phosphorylate
  YAP/TAZ, and YAP/TAZ translocate to the nucleus and interact with TEAD transcription
  factors to promote target gene expression. VGL4 competes with YAP for TEAD binding.
  NF2 directly interacts with LATS1/2 and induces its phosphorylation.
