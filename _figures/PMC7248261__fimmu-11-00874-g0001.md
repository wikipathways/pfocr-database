caption: Pathophysiology of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). After penetrating the
  skin, contact allergens react with or modify self-proteins into immunogenic proteins.
  Contact allergen-stressed KC produce profound amount of IL-1β and IL-18 and activated
  DETC produce IL-17A and IFN-γ. Simultaneously, APC are activated and can subsequently
  carry contact allergen-modified self-protein-MHC complexes to the dLN, where the
  priming of naïve T cells occur. Activated CD8+ T cells undergo clonal expansion
  and several memory subsets are developed. One specific subset of memory CD8+ T cells
  e.g., TRM cells migrates back to the site of primary allergen exposure. At the second
  exposure to the contact allergen, a faster and stronger inflammatory response is
  induced. Activated DETC and TRM cells produce significant amounts of IL-17A and
  IFN-γ and stressed KC produce large amounts of IL-1β. Additionally, TRM cells can
  induce apoptosis in allergen-modified KC via either the Fas-FasL-dependent or the
  perforin-dependent pathway. DETC, dendritic epidermal γδ T cell; APC, antigen presenting
  cell; TRM cells, tissue-resident memory T cells; KC, keratinocyte.
