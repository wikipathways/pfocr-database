caption: 'Metabolic mechanism of adaptation. A) Flux arrest in glycolysis, citric
  acid and mycolic acid pathway; B) Activation of NAD pathway de novo as computed
  based on directional re-routing of metabolic fluxes; C) Alternate mechanism of ATP
  generation based on proton motive force; Mechanism: The activation of nadA ~ E operon
  lead to de novo biosynthesis of NADH, pool which is then reduced to NAD following
  the activation of the nuoA ~ Eoperon coding for NDH-I. This maintains the electron
  flow with proton translocation, which increases the potential difference across
  cell membrane, and can potentiate ATP production, thereby providing the necessary
  energy when challenged with antibiotic stress.'
