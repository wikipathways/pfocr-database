caption: Mechanism of combination therapy for miR-21i and TMZ. miR-21i was delivered
  by PAMAM into the cells and coordinated with miR-21, leading to inactivation of
  miR-21. For LN229 cells (PTEN-wild), the inactivation of miR-21, which is inhibited
  by the simultaneous miR-21i and TMZ treatment, targets and reduces the expression
  of PTEN, blocks the PI3K-pAKT pathway, induces an increase in apoptosis, and leads
  to synergistic antiproliferative activity. For U251 (PTEN mutant) and U87 (PTEN-lost)
  cell lines with high STAT3 expression, the synergistic effect was achieved by sequence
  treatment of the two drugs. Reprinted with permission from [], copyright (2021)
