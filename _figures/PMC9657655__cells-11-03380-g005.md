caption: Impacts of psychological stress on periodontal status. Psychological stress
  affects periodontitis via three pathways, including lifestyle change, endocrine
  change and neurogenic pathway. Health-impairing lifestyles, such as smoking and
  alcohol consumption, exacerbate periodontitis-associated alveolar bone loss. Endocrine
  change mainly manifests as altered levels of stress hormones, such as GCs and catecholamine.
  GCs and catecholamine modulate bone remodeling and immuno-inflammatory response,
  adding to periodontal deterioration. Neuropeptides are the major effectors in the
  neurogenic pathway. Current evidence indicates the presence of both protective and
  harmful factors among neuropeptides. GCs, glucocorticoids.
