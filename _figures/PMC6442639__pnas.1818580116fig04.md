caption: A redox-balanced model for CO metabolism in T. kivui. The Ech complex (green)
  is constituted of either one or both Ech1 and Ech2. It catalyzes Fd2− oxidation
  and H2 evolution coupled to the transport of H+ and Na+. The F1FO ATP synthase (yellow)
  has an assumed H+/ATP stoichiometry of 12/3. The electron bifurcating hydrogenase
  and hydrogen-dependent CO2 reductase are depicted in blue. Numbers are rounded.
