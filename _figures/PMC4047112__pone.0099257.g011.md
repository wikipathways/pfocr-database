caption: 'The figure illustrates the interactions among the different proteins, kinases
  or small molecules involved in this work. The interactions were drawn by using the
  software Pathway Studio (v 9, Elsevier). Arrows with the+symbol represent stimulations
  and those with the -| symbol represent inhibition. Green ellipses: small molecules;
  red sickle-vertex: kinases; purple rectangle: disease (CF); blue star-vertex: shRNA
  specific for CFTR. The results obtained with IL-1β blocking Ab or with the receptor
  inhibitor IL1RN suggest that an autocrine IL-1β signaling is responsible for the
  reduced mCx-I activity and the increased ROS levels seen in IB3-1 CF cells or in
  Caco-2/pRS26 cells. Inhibition of NF-κB or p38 MAPK also resulted in increased mCx-I
  activity and decreased ROS levels. The inhibition of MEK1/2 or JNKs (AP-1 pathway)
  had no effects. The mechanisms by which CFTR increases IL-1β and IL1-β, p38 MAPKs
  or NF-κB inhibit mCx-I and increase ROS levels remain to be determined (dotted lines).'
