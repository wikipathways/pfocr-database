caption: The phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is highly active in many
  tumor cells, including medullary thyroid cancer. The pathway is activated by one
  of many receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). Akt is activated downstream of PI3K, and
  then can activate or inhibit multiple targets that lead to cell proliferation and
  inhibition of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Activation of RET (Rearranged during
  Transfection) can also activated PI3K. Certain compounds, including LY294002, Sorafenib,
  Sunitinib, Vandetanib, and MK-2206 (in black circles) effectively inhibit proteins
  in these pathways, and thus combinations of compounds that target different components
  could be tested. PTEN, Phosphate and Tensin Homolog; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-3,4-diphosphate;
  PIP3, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate.
