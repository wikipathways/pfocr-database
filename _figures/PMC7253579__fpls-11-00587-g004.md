caption: Proposed model for the role of the SACPATH in abiotic and biotic stress responses
  in plants. Upon abiotic stress (AbS, 1) such as that imposed by osmotic, salt, and
  drought, the cellular concentration of free lysine increase. As the lysine concentration
  increases, the transcripts encoding bifunctional LKR/SDH, monofunctional SDH, and
  AASADH accumulate, increasing the lysine-to-α-aminoadipate metabolic flux. In general,
  the expression of P5CS and P5CR is also upregulated under abiotic stress, and by
  the action of these two enzymes, glutamate is converted into proline (AbS, 2), and
  Δ1-piperidine 6-carboxylate is converted into pipecolate (AbS, 3). Proline and pipecolate
  are the two most effective osmolytes and help sustain cellular homeostasis under
  abiotic stress. The upregulation of AASADH helps metabolize aldehydes generated
  by stress conditions, including, for example, betaine aldehyde, whose conversion
  generates betaine, another important osmolyte (AbS, 4). Upon pathogen attack (BS,
  5) lysine is also catabolized to pipecolate through the NHP pathway by the enzymes
  ALD1, which deaminates lysine to Dhp, and SARD4, which reduces Dhp to pipecolate.
  Dhp is then N-hydroxylated by FMO1 to generate NHP, the effector of SAR (BS, 6).
  In the proposed model, the pipecolate generated by the SACPATH could also serve
  as a substrate for FMO1 to produce NHP, therefore contributing to SAR.
