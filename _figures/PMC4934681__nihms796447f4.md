caption: Molecular mechanisms of STD. Acute hypoxia of seconds to minutes can lead
  to a short-term decrease in breathing frequency via an incompletely understood pathway.
  (A) Acute hypoxia induces activation of serotonin (5-HT) type 2A and 2C receptors
  and/or α2-adrenoreceptors within the noradrenergic A5 cell group. Activation of
  5-HT2A/2C or α2-adrenoreceptors modulates glutamatergic NMDARs via an unknown pathway,
  and presumably decreases NMDAR activation. (B) Physiologically, activation of this
  pathway leads to decreased phrenic nerve activity and decreased ventilation (due
  to reduced breathing frequency); reprinted with permission ().
