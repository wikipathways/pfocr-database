caption: '(A) In fetal life, PGCs transform into gonocytes that remain centrally placed,
  surrounded by immature Sertoli cells. In mice, gonocyte development occurs before
  the formation at E10-13.5 d.p.c, in humans at E 8–10.5 weeks, and in pigs at E30–42
  d.p.c (gonadotropin-independent). In the neonatal phase, FSH, through FSHR signaling,
  regulates the proliferation of the cells and the number of cells that will be had
  in adult life (~P2–5-day mice (postpartum), ~P8–12 weeks in humans, and ~P4–16 weeks
  in pigs). During the prepubertal phase, an increase in FSH occurs during the maturation
  of Sertoli cells and during the completion of the first cycle of sperm (~P8–10 days
  in mice; ~P2–4 years in humans; ~P8–24 weeks in pigs). In adult life, the spermatogenesis
  process starts. This is a complex process in which diploid spermatogonia self-renew,
  proliferate, and differentiate into haploid spermatozoa. The gonadotropins act in
  the early events of the spermatogenesis, before spermiogenesis, mainly in spermatogonial
  proliferation and meiosis. These hormones act on all phases of spermatogenesis in
  some species such as rodents and a specific phase of spermatogenesis in men: the
  maturation of type A spermatogonia to type B spermatogonia, meiosis, and spermiation.
  (B) In germ cells, FSH mainly influences self-renewal, proliferation, and survival
  of spermatogonia cells through glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
  secreted by Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells secrete many factors linked to self-renewal
  such as GDNF and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), differentiation and proliferation
  of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP4), and activin
  A, amongst others such as KIT ligand (KL or stem cell factor—SCF), which promotes
  the KIT tyrosine-kinase receptor expressed by differentiated spermatogonia. GDNF
  induces SSC self-renew and survival through multiple pathways such as AKT/MEK, AKT,
  and SFK. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway influences the self-renewing
  divisions of SSCs, inhibits apoptosis, and is involved in activating mTORC1 through
  the SFK signaling pathway. GDNF upregulates the specific SSC genes such as B cell
  CLL/lymphoma 6, member B (BCL6B), Ets variant gene 5 (ETV5), and Lim homeobox protein
  1 (LHX1). GDNF also acts on the canonical RAS/ERK1/2 pathway, important for the
  proliferation and self-renewal of these cells by phosphorylation and activation
  of CREB1, ATF1, CREM, and c-FOS factors.'
