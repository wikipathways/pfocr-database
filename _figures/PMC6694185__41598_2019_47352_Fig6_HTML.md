caption: Model illustrating facilitation of mitochondrial protein import by the PINK1
  kinase-driven E3 Ub ligase Parkin and lack thereof in PARK2/PINK1-linked Parkinson’s
  disease. Under physiological reductions in mitochondrial protein import efficiency,
  the PINK1 kinase associates with the TOM complex and activates Parkin by phosphorylating
  S65 of Parkin and ubiquitin. By ubiquitylating receptor subunits of the TOM complex,
  Parkin facilitates the import of proteins targeted to mitochondria by the presequence
  pathway. The mitochondrial ubiquitylase USP30 antagonizes these effects. Mutations
  in PINK1 or PARK2 impair the system and its regulatory effect on mitochondrial protein
  import, contributing to the pathophysiology of autosomal recessive PD.
