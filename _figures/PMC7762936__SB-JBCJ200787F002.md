caption: Post-translational regulation of the long and winding cholesterol synthesis
  pathway. Cholesterol synthesis can be divided into the early pathway and post-lanosterol
  pathway, which in turn proceeds via the Bloch pathway or the Kandutsch–Russell pathway
  (containing C24-saturated derivatives of Bloch pathway intermediates). Depicted
  is the more widely utilized modified Kandutsch–Russell pathway, which bypasses upstream
  intermediates and downstream entry points. For simplicity, chemical structures are
  shown only for the sterol intermediates at the start and end of the Bloch and modified
  Kandutsch–Russell pathways. Red broken lines and inhibitory arrows indicate intermediates
  and E3 ligases that promote the degradation of HMGCR, whereas the red solid lines
  indicate intermediates that promote the degradation of other cholesterol synthesis
  enzymes (inhibitory arrows) or stabilize MARCHF6 (arrowheads). Note that for clarity,
  we have indicated only the major contributors to degradation of each enzyme. It
  is also likely that additional intermediates promote degradation of some enzymes,
  but these have yet to be explored. The E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCHF6 targets the enzymes
  indicated in purple. For more details, please refer to the text.
