caption: 'The intracellular signaling pathway that regulates the formation of interstitial
  axon branches in cortical neurons. Our results suggest the following model: MAP1B
  functions as a brake on interstitial axon branching (left, red panel), which can
  be released following GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation (right, yellow panel). Subsequently,
  the ratio of tyrosinated/detyrosinated tubulin shifts towards the tyrosinated tubulin,
  promoting the formation of interstitial axon branches'
