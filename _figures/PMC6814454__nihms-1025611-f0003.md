caption: Substrates of PD enzymes identified by proteomics.(A) The PINK1-parkin mitophagy
  pathway. PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1, pink) is a serine-threonine type kinase that
  is directed to mitochondria and is stabilized on the surface of depolarized mitochondria.
  Once stabilized, PINK1 will phosphorylated both ubiquitin (Ub, black) and a ubiquitin-like
  domain on the cytosolic E3 ligase parkin (green). Activated parkin then adds phosphor-ubiquitin
  (pUb) to proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), leading to their degradation
  and turnover of the mitochondria by mitophagy.(B) The kinase domain of Leucine-rich
  repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) can phosphorylate Rab proteins on the surface of organelles,
  including damaged lysosomes but also perhaps other membranes. Phosphorylated Rabs
  (pRabs) show diminished interaction with GDP-dissociation inhibitor (GDI) proteins
  which normally prevent the insertion of Rabs into membranes via their C-terminal
  lipidation motifs. pRabs may interact with effector proteins and undergo cycles
  of GTP to GDP hydrolysis. Adapted largely from ().
