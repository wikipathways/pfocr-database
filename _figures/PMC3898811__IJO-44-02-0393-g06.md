caption: Schematic diagram as summary of the present investigation. Short-term hypoxia
  leads to the stabilization of HIF-1α, targeting the metabolism-related genes, such
  as PGK1, ALDOC and LDHA, to adapt to the hypoxic environment. The prolonged hypoxia
  is more sophisticated. Firstly, this hypoxia induces HAF. On the one hand, the induced
  HAF contributes to the degradation of IκB in an unknown way, leading to the activation
  of NF-κB pathway, which can be inhibited by PDTC resulting in the increase of target
  genes, such as HIF-1α, HIF-2α and HIF-β. On the other hand, HAF leads to the degradation
  of HIF-1α directly. The combination of the two aspects result in the switch of HIF-1α
  to HIF-2α, leading to the activation of migration/invasion and stem-cell related
  genes to maintain invasive and self-renewal capacity of tumor cells.
