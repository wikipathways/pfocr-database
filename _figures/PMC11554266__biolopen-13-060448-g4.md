caption: This figure depicts how autophagy is activated in response to nutrient deprivation,
  playing a pivotal role in promoting cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis. Under
  nutrient stress, autophagy is initiated through AMPK activation and mTORC1 inhibition.
  Once autophagy is induced, it supports cell survival by enhancing amino acid release
  and stimulating the pentose phosphate pathway, which sustains metabolic processes.
  At the same time, autophagy suppresses apoptosis by reducing p53 activity and degrading
  active caspase 8, a key component of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Beclin1,
  a core autophagy protein, is essential in initiating and regulating the autophagic
  process by interacting with various proteins to promote autophagosome formation.
  The disruption of the Beclin1-Bcl-2 complex further enhances autophagy, contributing
  to cell survival, particularly in CRC cells. This regulation allows cancer cells
  to evade apoptosis, leading to tumor progression and increased resistance to therapies.
