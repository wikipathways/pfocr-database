caption: (A) Alignment of sequences adjacent to Y200 for human TRPV1–4. The bottom
  line shows conserved residues (*), which include the TRPV1 Y200 site (yellow bar).
  (B) Schematic diagram of the signaling pathways important in sensitization of TRPV1
  by TrkA. The functionally most significant pathway is shown at the left (yellow,
  solid arrows). A smaller component of sensitization following exposure to NGF is
  mediated by phosphorylation of TRPV1 at residues S502 and S801, probably by the
  PLCγ/PKCɛ pathway (green, dashed arrows). PKCɛ is a crucial intermediate in sensitization
  of TRPV1 by bradykinin (pathway shown at the lower right of the diagram).
