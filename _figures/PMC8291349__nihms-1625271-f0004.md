caption: 'The CYP7A1 gene proximal promoter contains BARE, which binds the nuclear
  receptors shown. Three mechanisms for bile acid regulation of CYP7A1 gene transcription
  are illustrated here. The CYP7A1 promoter contains two bile acid responsive elements,
  BARE-I and BARE-II, which contains a direct repeat with 4 bases spacing (DR4) and
  1 base spacing (DR1) motif, respectively. Nucleotide sequences shown are rat Cyp7a1
  gene. Mechanisms 1 and 2 are FXR-dependent and mechanism 3 depicts an FXR-independent
  cell signaling pathway. Mechanism i: Bile acid activation of FXR induces the repressor
  SHP to inhibit HNF4α and LRH-1-mediated transcriptional activation of CYP7A1. The
  SHP-mediated mechanisms may also inhibit PXR/RXRα (BARE-II), COUP-TFII/RXRα (BARE-I
  and BARE-II), LXR/RXRα (BARE-I) and PPARa/RXRα (BARE-II) binding to the CYP7A1 promoter
  to suppress CYP7A1 gene transcription. FXR also induces MAFG to inhibit CYP7A1.
  PXR, VDR and PPARa inhibit CYP7A1 gene transcription via competition for HNF4α binding
  to the BARE-II on the CYP7A1 gene promoter. Mechanism ii: Bile acid activation of
  intestinal FXR induces FGF19, which is transported from the intestine to the liver
  and activates the FGFR4/β-Klotho complex to phosphorylate and activate JNK1/2 and
  ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Phosphorylation of HNF4α inhibits its dimerization and
  binding to the CYP7A1 gene, resulting in reduced CYP7A1 gene transcription. Phosphorylation
  of PGC-1α, a co-activator of PPARα, and other nuclear receptors also inhibit trans-activation
  of the CYP7A1 gene. Mechanism iii: Taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA)/CDCA activates macrophages
  and induces the release of inflammatory cytokines including TNFα and IL-1β, which
  cross the sinusoidal membrane to activate protein kinase C (PKC) and JNK signaling
  pathways to inhibit CYP7A1 gene transcription. Epigenetic regulation: Histone acetylases
  (HATs), such as CBP/P300 and histone deacetylases (HDACs) such as sirtuin 1 (SIRT1),
  regulate FXR, SHP and CYP7A1/CYP8B1 by epigenetic mechanisms. The methytransferase
  G9a is recruited by SHP and Prox-1 to inhibit CYP7A1 by histone methylation. Abbreviations:
