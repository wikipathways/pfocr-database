caption: New metabolic retrograde signaling pathways. The different components of
  recently discovered plant retrograde signaling pathways are shown. (A) β-CC is most
  likely produced by oxidation of carotenes by 1O2 in the chloroplast and could diffuse
  through the membrane into the cytosol. Feeding β-CC results in the up-regulation
  of genes involved in stress responses, particularly those triggered by 1O2. It is
  speculated that the electrophilic carbonyl group could react with electron donors,
  such as sulfhydryl groups; however, the actual targets and mode of action are unknown.
  (B) MEcPP, an intermediary of isoprenoid precursors, is produced by MDS in the plastidic
  MEP pathway. MEcPP over accumulating mutants present high levels of SA and are resistant
  to biotrophic pathogens. MEcPP regulates the expression of the HPL and ICS1 gene,
  with concomitant production of SA. Although the transport and action mechanism are
  unknown, MEcPP could promote chromatin reorganization and induction of transcription
  of target genes. (C) PAP levels are catabolically regulated by SAL1 in the chloroplast
  and PAP transport is probably mediated by PAPST1. Cytosolic PAP could diffuse to
  the nucleus via the pores (cylinder) where it inhibits nuclear XRNs and affects
  gene regulation of stress inducible genes (i.e., APX2 and ELIP2). This mechanism
  is thought to play a role during drought, as PAP levels increase 30-fold. Other
  potential PAP targets (Nucleotide diphosphate kinase, NDK, and poly (ADP-ribose)
  polymerase, PARP, proteins) may mediate other aspects of signaling. The control
  mechanism of gene regulation by the XRNs proteins is a matter of investigation.
  Red lines, inhibition; black arrows, induction or activation; proteins involved
  in the signaling are indicated as ovals. Unknown components, processes or targets
  are indicated with red “?” or with dashed arrows. β-CC, β-cyclocitral; MEP, Methylerythritol
  phosphate pathway; MEcPP, methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate; MDS, MEcPP synthase;
  IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; SA, salicylic acid;
