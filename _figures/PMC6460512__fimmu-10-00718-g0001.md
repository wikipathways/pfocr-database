caption: Hypothetical illustration showing LPS mediated inflammatory response, possible
  mechanism of anti-inflammatory miRNAs mediated endotoxin tolerance as well as packaging
  within extracellular vesicles (EVs; including exosomes and microvesicles) in a placental
  trophoblast. The initial LPS dose stimulates TLR4 pathway in the placental trophoblast
  to prompt the initial inflammatory response, while also upregulating miRNA transcription.
  The miRNAs are either found freely in the cytoplasm and released outside the cells,
  or selectively packaged into extracellular vesicles by various mechanisms. Exosomes
  are formed intraluminally in the endosomal system within multivesicular bodies (MVB)
  while microvesicles are secreted by membrane derived vesicle formation. They are
  selectively packaged with nucleic acids (DNAs, mRNAs, miRNAs), proteins, lipids
  and carbohydrates, specific to the cell of origin and the intended target. The EVs
  and free miRNAs are transported to the target cell via the extracellular space.
