caption: 'Molecular Mechanisms of Breast Cancer Metastasis, Drug Resistance, and Target
  Organ Selection.A Breast cancer cells acquire both intrinsic and adaptive drug resistance
  during metastasis through genetic mutations, clonal selection, and therapy-induced
  adaptations, complicating treatment strategies. B Tumor-Derived Factors. Direct
  Factors: VEGF, PlGF, TGF-β, MMP9, and exosomes promote angiogenesis, cell migration,
  and microenvironment remodeling, facilitating metastatic niche formation in target
  organs. Indirect Factors: MMP2, HIF-1α, CXCL1/CXCL12, and neutrophils enhance invasiveness
  and immune evasion, supporting metastasis across multiple organs. C Brain Metastasis:
  Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, mediated by CXCL12, VEGF, and exosomes, promotes
  tumor cell colonization and angiogenesis in the brain. D Lung Metastasis: VEGF,
  MMP9, and LOX drive angiogenesis, extracellular matrix degradation, and cell adhesion,
  promoting tumor growth and dissemination in the lungs. E Bone Metastasis: Tumor
  cells trigger bone destruction via the RANKL-RANK signaling pathway and TGF-β release,
  creating a vicious cycle that accelerates bone metastasis. F Liver Metastasis: HIF-1α,
  VEGF, and CXCL12 foster fibrosis, immune modulation, and angiogenesis, facilitating
  tumor colonization and growth in the liver'
