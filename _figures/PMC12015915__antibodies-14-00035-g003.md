caption: 'Margetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that has been modified at the Fc region
  to enhance its therapeutic effects. It specifically binds to the extracellular domain
  IV of the HER2 receptor, preventing the formation of HER2 homodimers and disrupting
  the ligand-independent interactions of HER2 with HER3, HER1, and HER4. This disruption
  strengthens antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), leading to the targeted
  elimination of tumour cells. Furthermore, by blocking the HER2-associated tyrosine
  kinase signalling pathway, margetuximab reduces cancer cell proliferation, migration,
  invasion, and survival. Adapted from open access journal referenced Alasmari, M.M.
