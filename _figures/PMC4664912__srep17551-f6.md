caption: Red italics denote candidate positively selected genes, blue italics indicate
  significantly up-regulated genes and green italics genes experiencing positive selection
  and increased expression. (1) AVPR2, expressed mainly in kidney tubules, primarily
  serves to respond to the pituitary hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) to maintain
  water homeostasis; production of ALB can facilitate blood plasma volume expansion,
  which serves to regulate blood pressure. (2) AGT, PREP, ANPEP and CTSA play roles
  in the renin-angiotenin system pathway; NR3C2, PIK3CG, PDPK1 and SCNN1G associate
  with aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption pathway. (3) EHHADH provides energy
  for tubule reabsorption through the oxidation of fatty acids in the proximal tubule;
  ATP6V1G3 and ATP6V1F are v-type-H+ ATPases and they participate in Na+ uptake as
  energizers.
