caption: The anthocyanin and PA biosynthetic pathways. Enzymatic steps altered in
  the transparent testa mutants referred to in the text are shown. There is no evidence
  that Arabidopsis produces tri-hydroxylated intermediates or end products in PA or
  anthocyanin biosynthesis, so this branch of the pathway is not shown. All steps
  analyzed so far, with the possible exception of flavonol synthase (FS), are encoded
  by a single gene in Arabidopsis. CHI, Chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hyroxylase;
  F3′H, flavanone 3′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase.
