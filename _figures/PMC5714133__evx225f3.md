caption: '—Scheme for the possible evolution of the biosynthetic pathways of Q. The
  flow scheme illustrates the hypothetical evolution of the pathways of Q biosynthesis
  presented in this work: a (in gray box on the left), c (top), and m (bottom), all
  originating from the ancestral pathway of PQ biosynthesis in cyanobacteria (). The
  scheme includes only the enzymes for Q biosynthesis that vary in presence and combination
  within the genome of proteobacterial taxa; their symbols are presented in the boxed
  caption at the bottom of the illustration. UbiA is implied to be present in all
  combinations for its crucial function (see  and ), whereas UbiB and UbiJ are not
  considered because their role in Q biosynthesis is not essential and partially unknown
  (; ). Gene loss and acquisition is represented by a red thin arrow and thin black
  line, respectively. A dark gray square indicates the absence of a gene in the combination
  of enzymes deduced from genomic information. The dashed arrows in the middle indicate
  a minor alternative route (or intermediate) in pathway c that seems to be present
  only in deep branching gamma proteobacteria such as Salinisphaera (). A genus or
  species characteristic for each combination of Q biosynthesis enzymes is indicated
  at the bottom of each set of symbols (cf.  and ). Acquisition of other CoQ genes
  specific to mitochondria () is not represented at the end of pathway m, bottom right
  of the scheme. Q in gray circle indicates anaerobically synthesized ubiquinone (pathway
  a, within the gray square), whereas aerobically synthesized Q is represented as
  in figure 1. RQ in red circle indicates the Q derivative rhodoquinone that is found
  in Rhodosprillum and very few other proteobacteria such as Rhodoferax, as well as
  in anaerobically adapted mitochondria of invertebrates (; ; ). α GWF2, alphaproteobacterium
