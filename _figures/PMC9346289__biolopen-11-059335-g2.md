caption: Integration of the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle with native photorespiration
  and different photorespiratory bypasses. (A) Rubisco oxygenation generates 2-phosphoglycolate
  that is recycled via the native photorespiratory pathway (black). (B) Alternative
  pathway 3 (purple) (; ) bypasses photorespiration by metabolising glycolate in the
  chloroplast. (C) The β-hydroxyaspartate cycle (orange) () generates oxaloacetate
  from glycolate while conserving more carbon and nitrogen than native photorespiration.
  (D) E. coli glycolate catabolic pathway (blue) () generates 3-phosphoglycerate for
  Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle metabolism without requiring catalytic steps in additional
  compartments to the chloroplast. (E) Fully synthetic tartronyl-CoA pathway (green)
  () provides a more direct route for glycolate assimilation than native photorespiration.
  Enzymes, stoichiometries and co-substrates have been omitted for clarity. 2PG, 2-phosphoglycolate;
  3PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; Asp, aspartate; CBB, Calvin–Benson–Bassham; OAA, oxaloacetate;
  RuBP, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate.
