caption: A, haematoxylin and eosin stained section of neonatal pig thyroid tissue
  showing follicles consisting of epithelial cells and colloid-filled lumina. Scale
  bar = 50 μm. B, schematic depiction of thyroid follicle showing polarized orientation
  of epithelial cells (A, apical; BL, basolateral). Arrows indicate directional movements
  of thyroglobulin (Tg) and I−, uptake of iodinated Tg (Tg*) pro-hormone and release
  of T3 and T4. Circulating I− levels in blood range between 10 and 100 μm (; ). Due
  to rapid intrafollicular Tg* formation, the colloid can be regarded as essentially
  devoid of free I−. C, basic steps involved in thyroid hormone formation are shown.
  Left, TSH binds its receptor and promotes thyroid hormone production. Circulating
  I− is taken up at the basolateral membrane via the sodium-iodide symporter, NIS
  (). Intracellular I− accumulates and moves across the apical membrane by a process
  believed at least partially to be mediated by Pendrin, thereby providing this essential
  element for hormone synthesis. Middle, Tg is produced by the thyroid epithelial
  cells, processed along the synthetic pathway and released into the follicular lumen.
  Top, H2O2, required for the coupling of I− and Tg, is generated by DUOX2 at the
  apical membrane. Reaction of these components is catalysed by TPO; I− is coupled
  to many tyrosine residues within Tg, of which only a select number are hormonogenic.
  Tyrosine residues can be either mono- or di-iodinated. TPO also facilitates coupling
  of these residues to form precursor to T3 (mono- + di-iodinated) and T4 (2 × di-iodinated).
  Right, outline of endocytosis and processing of the pro-hormone. Some Tg* is proteolysed
  at the apical surface by externalized cathepsins prior to uptake (). Internalized
  Tg* is proteolysed by cathepsins within lysosomes (; ). T3 and T4 exit basolaterally
  in a process at least partially mediated by MCT8, a monocarboxylic acid transporter
  of the SLC16 family (). Un-utilized iodotyrosines are further degraded by iodotyrosine
  dehalogenases and recycled.
