caption: Neurotrophin actions on the endothelial cell. Under basal conditions, the
  neurotrophin receptor trkA and trkB (and, in some tissues, also trkC) are expressed
  by EC. Trk receptor engagement by mature NTs initiates two major signaling pathways,
  Erk MAPK and IP3K/Akt. Nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment of EC causes a rapid
  phosphorylation of trkA, determining a parallel activation of ERK1/2 and a subsequent
  increase in EC proliferation and migration. Activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway promotes EC survival. Moreover, via the PI3K/Akt, NGF stimulates EC invasion
  and cord formation by augmenting MMP-2. NGF, via trkA, supports EC survival in vitro
  and in vivo, an action which is, at least in part, mediated by increased VEGF-A.
  BDNF, via trkB, also supports EC survival. Under basal conditions, the p75NTR is
  scarcely expressed by EC. Following p75NTR induction or transduction, the receptor
  triggers EC apoptosis and inhibits EC cell cycling through mechanisms that may be
  dependent or not from ligand (mature NT and pro-NGF) activation.
