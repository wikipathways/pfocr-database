caption: The time of expression of a C-signal-dependent gene depends on its position
  within the C-signal transduction pathway and on its threshold C-signal specific
  activity (, ). Two cells are shown signaling to each other; both have the same signal
  transduction circuit, but for clarity the circuit is shown only in the cell on the
  right.
