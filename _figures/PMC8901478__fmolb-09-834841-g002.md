caption: Potential predictive biomarker strategy for oncolytic virus therapeutic response.
  Shown are tumor cells with variable gene expression and interferon pathway signaling
  status at the time of initial diagnosis or pre-treatment biopsy. (A) Tumor cell
  with loss of function or low levels of JAK1, JAK2, and/or STING expression. In these
  tumors, oncolytic viruses may replicate more efficiently and induce widespread immunogenic
  cell death (oncolysis). (B) Tumor cells with intact JAK1, JAK2 and STING signaling
  will be resistant to DNA viral replication but are more sensitive to immune checkpoint
  blockade. These tumor cells will express higher levels of PD-L1 making them permissive
  to PD-1 blockade and potentially other checkpoint blockade, such as CTLA-4 (Created
  with Biorender).
