caption: Schematic of the Ras-MAPK and TGFβ pathways. The left-hand side of the schematic
  depicts the Ras-MAPK pathway while the right-hand side of the schematic shows the
  Smad-dependent TGFβ signaling pathway. The details of both pathways are elaborated
  in the text. Both pathways begin with extracellular factor binding transmembrane
  cell surface receptors and end with transcriptional changes. Differences in the
  Ras-MAPK and TGFβ pathways are evident in the method by which stimulus signals are
  relayed to the nucleus. The Ras-MAPK pathway utilizes a phosphorylation cascade
  that results in signal amplification and a nonlinear switch-like response to stimulus.
  The TGFβ pathway is depicted here as a linear response to stimulus due to the direct
  interaction of transcription factor Smads with transmembrane receptors TGFβRI and
  TGFβRII. Box 1, 2 and 3 indicates points of integration that are detailed in the
  text.
