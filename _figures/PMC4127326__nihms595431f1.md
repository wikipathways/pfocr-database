caption: 'Schematic models for the assembly of cohesin and associated factors at double-strand
  breaks (DSBs), and ATR- and Eco1 (Ctf7)-dependent reactivation of cohesin in G2
  phase. a: In response to DNA DSB damage, cohesin is recruited to the damage site
  in a S/G2 phase-specific manner. This is dependent on the Mre11 complex (Mre11–Rad50–Nbs1),
  the cohesion-loading factor (Scc2–Scc4), and γH2A. In the case of human cells, the
  Smc5–Smc6 complex is also required for cohesin recruitment to DSBs. For establishment
  of sister chromatid cohesion, cohesin requires additional factors, including Eco1
  (Ctf7), the Smc5–Smc6 complex, and ATR (see b). b: In G2 phase, DSBs induce ATR
  activation, which leads to reactivation of cohesin by Eco1 (Ctf7). Mre11 and the
  Smc5–Smc6 complex may be involved in the same pathway. This process requires the
  acetyltransferase activity of Eco1 (Ctf7). The targets of ATR-mediated phosphorylation
  and Eco1 (Ctf7)-mediated acetylation are unknown.'
