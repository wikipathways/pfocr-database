caption: In choroidal endothelial cell, upon binding to VEGF, VEGFR2 interacts with
  IQGAP1, leading to VEGFR2 activation. Activated VEGFR2 recruits Src and results
  in Src phosphorylation. Once Src is activated by VEGFR2 and IQGAP1, it activates
  Rac1 potentially involving phosphorylation of vav guaninenucleotide exchange factor
  2 (Vav2), then leads to Src activation (from Rac1GDP to Rac1GTP). Once Rac1 is activated,
  Rac1GTP binds to IQGAP1 via GRD domain. This interaction between IQGAP1 and Rac1
  maintains persistent Rac1 activation, which leads to CEC migration and CNV formation
  (the diagram was produced with BioRender).
