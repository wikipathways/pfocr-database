caption: Summary of differentially expressed genes involved in the AMPK signaling
  pathway. Activation of AMPK occurs following phosphorylation of Thr172 (not shown)
  by LKB1, CaMKK, TAK1, and MLK3. Activated AMPK regulates glucose metabolism by increasing
  glucose uptake via translocation of GLUT4 by phosphorylating/inhibiting TBC1D1 and
  phosphorylating/activating PIKfyve, HDAC4, and PLD1. AMPK-mediated translocation
  of GLUT1 occurs following phosphorylation/inhibition of TXNIP. Glycolysis is stimulated
  via activation of PFKFB3, and glycogen storage is reduced by inhibition of GS. Inhibition
  of gluconeogenesis occurs following phosphorylation/inhibition of PDE4B, TORC2,
  HDAC4/5/6, and HNF4α. AMPK regulates lipid metabolism by phosphorylating/inhibiting
  HSL, HNF4α, and activating ATGL to increase lipolysis. An increase in β-oxidation
  occurs by phosphorylation of ACC2 and reducing fatty acid synthesis by phosphorylation
  of ACC1. AMPK decreases lipid and sterol synthesis by phosphorylating/inhibiting
  SREBP1, ChREBP, and HMGCR. AMPK inhibits protein synthesis by phosphorylating/inhibiting
  TIF-1α, mTORC1, and RAPTOR, and phosphorylating/activating eEF2K and TSC2, which
  inhibit mTORC1. Lastly, mitochondrial functions are regulated by activated AMPK
  by activating mitochondrial biosynthesis. AMPK phosphorylates/activates AKAP1, DRP1,
  PGC-1α, SIRT1, p53, and HDAC4. AMPK activates mitophagy and autophagy pathways by
  phosphorylating/activating ULK1, ACSS, Atg9, Beclin1, and FOXO3.
