caption: The proposed model for redox-mediated DSC differentiation. A, Auxin signaling
  negatively modulates ROS accumulation in root tips and WOX5 expression. ACR4 stability
  is negatively mediated by abnormal redox status, which positively modulates the
  expression of PLT1 and PLT2. PLT1 and PLT2 are negative regulators of DSC differentiation.
  Blue arrows indicate positive regulation, red bars indicate inhibition, and dotted
  lines indicate indirect regulation. B, Redox-mediated trafficking routes of ACR4.
  Redox signal promotes the endocytosis of ACR4 through the trans-Golgi network/early
  endosome (TGN/EE) and MVB/LE. ACR4 (TNFR12C-A) does not respond to redox signals
  for protein endocytosis. ACR4 (ΔTNFR) cannot be trafficked from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) to the Golgi and plasma membrane by secretion pathway, but might
  be transported into the MVB/LE or some unknown compartments, where it plays a role
  in redox signaling, and finally be degraded in vacuoles.
