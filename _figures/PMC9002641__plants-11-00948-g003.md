caption: The figure shows the structures of secondary metabolites identified from
  P. fijiensis that are known to be toxic to banana tissue, as well as the structure
  of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN), which is polymerized to produce DHN melanins.
  Some of the phytotoxic shunt metabolites are derived from this pathway [,,,,,,].
