caption: The mechanism by which ginseng prevents disease via regulation of the endocrine
  and immune systems. Ginseng regulates the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis.
  Ginseng thus prevents various diseases by ameliorating tissue injury and immune
  cell death, while modulating immune cells in order to limit inflammatory responses.
  The HPA axis is the major pathway regulating the immune response to stress; this
  is initiated by hypothalamic secretion of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH)
  and secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) from the pituitary gland. CRH stimulates
  the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the bloodstream.
  ACTH in turn triggers the release of glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, from the
  adrenal cortex. In the event of severe stress-induced dysfunction of the HPA axis,
  endocrine homeostasis is disturbed; this can predispose the patient to a number
  of diseases. Patients with depression and anxiety exhibit increased production of
  HPA hormones, including CRH and AVP, as compared to healthy individuals . Additionally,
  glucocorticoids and norepinephrine modulate proinflammatory cytokine production
  by immune cells. Consequently, chronic and severe stress causes immune dysfunction,
  which in turn can lead to various diseases . It is well known that glucocorticoids
  suppress immune function during acute stress, thus increasing susceptibility to
  disease. However, should the stress become chronic, receptors become resistant to
  glucocorticoids and can no longer downregulate inflammatory processes . IL, interleukin;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha.
