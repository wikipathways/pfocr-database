caption: Interaction network of key signaling pathway-mRNA-miRNA. (A) MAPK signaling
  pathway; (B) TGF-β signaling pathway. (The red pentagon in the Fig. represents the
  signal pathway, the blue oval is the mRNAs corresponding to the signal pathway,
  and the green rectangle is the miRNAs corresponding to the mRNAs. They all originated
  from the top 10 most differentially expressed miRNAs from the three comparisons.)
