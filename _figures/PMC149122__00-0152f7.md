caption: A Model for Cell Death Signaling in Arabidopsis Protoplasts.Weak and strong
  SA signals are denoted by smaller and larger letters, respectively. As alternatives
  to the light-dependent PAL-mediated generation of SA shown in the model, SA might
  be produced from SA β-glucoside through a pathway independent of PAL and light,
  and the primary role of light in PCD may be to generate ROS rather than to activate
  the transcription of PAL genes. See text for details.
