caption: A role for fibroblast-derived metabolites in tumor-stroma interactions. (A)
  illustrates metabolic reprogramming in CAFs and (B) illustrates the effect of metabolites
  derived from CAFs to cancer cells in the TME. (1) Activated CAFs uptake excess TME
  lactate produced by glycolytic cells in the TME. (2) p62 deficient CAFs are autophagy
  defective and have upregulation of ATF4 which activates metabolic flux through pyruvate
  carboxylase (PC) → asparagine synthase (ASNS) pathway producing asparagine that
  is consumed by cancer cells. (3) CAFs characterized by upregulation of anapleurotic
  glutamine metabolism where cancer cell-derived aspartate, asparagine, and glutamate
  are used to generate glutamate that is fed to cancer cells; glutamine amino ligase
  (GLUL) is overexpressed in these CAFs. (4) Cancer cells induce autophagy in CAFs
  increasing turnover of non-essential amino acids, alanine has been shown to be up-taken
  by cancer cells to support growth. (5) Upon activation pancreatic and hepatic CAFs
  shift from lipid storing to lipid-secreting wherein CAF-derived lipids support proliferation
  and migratory potential of cancer cells. (6) Exosome releasing CAFs pack metabolic
  molecules used by cancer cells. (7) CAV1 deficient CAFs are known to upregulate
  glycolytic metabolism, as well as, fibroblast activation by PDGF and TGFβ. (A) describes
  metabolic alterations in CAFs in dashed boxes. In both figures metabolic pathways
  are denoted with green arrows, cellular processes are assigned specific colors,
  and metabolic molecules are underlined.
