caption: Pathways of proline biosynthesis in B. subtilis. The major pathway of proline
  synthesis from glutamate is shown as a descending series of reactions. Some proline
  is also apparently synthesized from glutamate via ornithine (an intermediate in
  arginine synthesis) by the action of the RocD product (unpublished results). Since
  no ortholog of E. coli ArgE protein is present in B. subtilis, conversion of N-acetylglutamic
  γ-semialdehyde (an intermediate in arginine synthesis) to γ-glutamic semialdehyde
  () apparently does not occur. Details of the anabolic pathway from glutamate to
  ornithine and the catabolic reaction from γ-glutamic semialdehyde to glutamate have
  been omitted. The catabolism of citrulline includes its conversion to ornithine
  (unpublished data) but has not been characterized further. Ornithine cyclodeaminase
  (dashed line) is not present in B. subtilis. The proG and proI genes have been previously
  known as ykeA and yqjO, respectively.

  description: Pathways of proline biosynthesis in B. subtilis. The major pathway
    of proline synthesis from glutamate is shown as a descending series of reactions.
    Some proline is also apparently synthesized from glutamate via ornithine (an intermediate
    in arginine synthesis) by the action of the RocD product (unpublished results).
    Since no ortholog of E. coli ArgE protein is present in B. subtilis, conversion
    of N-acetylglutamic γ-semialdehyde (an intermediate in arginine synthesis) to
    γ-glutamic semialdehyde () apparently does not occur. Details of the anabolic
    pathway from glutamate to ornithine and the catabolic reaction from γ-glutamic
    semialdehyde to glutamate have been omitted. The catabolism of citrulline includes
    its conversion to ornithine (unpublished data) but has not been characterized
    further. Ornithine cyclodeaminase (dashed line) is not present in B. subtilis.
    The proG and proI genes have been previously known as ykeA and yqjO, respectively.
