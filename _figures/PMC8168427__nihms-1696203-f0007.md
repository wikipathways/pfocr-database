caption: (a) ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A2 play a main role of retinoic acid biosynthesis and
  oxidize retinaldehyde to RA. These two enzymes could also metabolize aldehydes,
  but their contribution is minimal as ALDH2*1 genotype metabolizes aldehydes in the
  most efficient way. (b) ALDH2*2 is associated with decreased catalytic activity,
  and therefore, accumulation of toxic aldehydes would induce mitochondrial dysfunction,
  including dysregulated bioenergetics (reduced fatty acid β-oxidation and adenosine
  triphosphate synthesis), and increased oxidative stress (4HNE and MDA). In addition,
  an mitochondria-independent pathway induces electrical remodeling and AF through
  the suppression of SCN5A expressions. The accumulation of toxic aldehydes would
  compete retinaldehyde for catalytic activity of ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A2 (competitive
  inhibition). Therefore, the levels of RA and related RA/RAR pathway are further
  downregulated, which is accompanied by decreased transcriptional activity of SCN5A.
  The concurrence of dysregulated SCN5A channel and mitochondrial bioenergetics contributes
  to AF attack.
