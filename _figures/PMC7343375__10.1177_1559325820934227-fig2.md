caption: 'Abbreviated diagrammatic representation of the PI3K, Akt, mTOR cell signaling
  pathway, and associated pathways, as a major regulator of cell function (see Laplante
  and Sabatini for a more extensive chart of mTOR-related cell signaling). The mTOR
  is an atypical serine/threonine kinase that is present in 2 distinct complexes.
  The first, mTORC1, is highlighted and is composed of mTOR, Raptor, GβL, and DEPTOR
  and is inhibited by rapamycin. It is a master growth regulator that senses and integrates
  diverse nutritional and environmental cues, including growth factors, energy levels,
  cellular stress, and amino acids. It couples these signals to the promotion of cellular
  growth by phosphorylating substrates that potentiate anabolic processes such as
  mRNA translation and lipid synthesis or limit catabolic processes such as autophagy.
  The pathways from mTORC1 leading to activation of autophagy (highlighted) are indicated
  in red (heavy arrows). Interactions with AMPK (circled) are also shown. Overactivity
  of mTORC1 is believed to trigger inflammatory processes which can result in pathological
  injury and processes leading to many cancers and degenerative diseases; and aberrant
  mTOR signaling is involved in many disease states including cancer, cardiovascular
  disease, and diabetes. Adapted from Moore and with permission from Cell Signaling
