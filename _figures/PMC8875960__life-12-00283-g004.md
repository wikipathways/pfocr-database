caption: Non canonical NF-κB signaling in CLL. BIRC3 is a negative regulator of the
  non-canonical NF-κB pathway, and the BIRC3 gene is disrupted by loss of function
  genetic alterations in a fraction of CLL. BIRC3 physiologically catalyzes the ubiquitination
  of MAP3K14, leading to inactivation of the NF-κB pathway. In the case of BIRC3-disrupting
  mutations, MAP3K14 is no longer ubiquitinated, and therefore, MAP3K14 can perform
  its function of positive signal transducer activating the NF-κB pathway.
