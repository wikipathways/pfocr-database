caption: Diagrammatic sketch showing the mechanism by which isorhamnetin attenuates
  IAV (H1N1)-induced proinflammatory responses and injury. After infection, influenza
  virus is recognized by RIG-I, which induces the production of type I IFN, cytokines,
  and chemokines. The IFN-α and IFN-β act on the IFN receptors (IFNARs) of adjacent
  cells via autocrine and paracrine activity to activate the MAPK pathway. This pathway
  is a cascade of protein kinases that is triggered by specific extracellular signals
  such as type I IFN. Upon extracellular stimulation, MAPKs are activated downstream
  of sequentially activated protein kinases, MAPK kinase kinase (MKKK) and MAPK kinase
  (MKK). Subsequently, JNK and p38, 2 MAPK family proteins, become continuously activated
  (i.e., phosphorylated) by multiple upstream kinases in the MAPK pathway, thus inducing
  the expression of pro-inflammatory and IFN. Following, IFN interacts with IFNAR
  in the form of paracrine or autocrine to cause positive feedback, accompanied by
  excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The inhibition of RIG-I signaling
  by isorhamnetin attenuates RIG-I-linked proinflammatory IFN production, which results
  in a reduction in JNK activation and thus a decrease in the amplification of proinflammatory
  responses. IAV, influenza A virus; IFN, interferon.
