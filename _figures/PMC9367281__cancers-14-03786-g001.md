caption: Schematic of the canonical PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Light blue arrows
  denote the activating signal transduction events between the members of a particular
  pathway (shown as circles of different color). Red crossbars denote the inhibitory
  events. Upon activation of RTK (receptor tyrosine kinase), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase) phosphorylates and produces PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)) from PIP2
  (phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate). PTEN (phosphatase) promotes the reverse
  reaction thus negatively regulates the pathway. PIP3 facilitates the phosphorylation
  of AKT (protein kinase B). Activating AKT phosphorylates different target proteins
  and mediates multiple cellular events and processes such as cell cycle, metabolism,
  survival, apoptosis, etc. Schematic representation of an alternative non-AKT-dependent
  activation pathway via the Ras/MAPK signaling. Upon exposure of cancer cells to
  extracellular signals sensed by RTKs, the signal is transferred via the Grb2/SOS
  protein complex to specific receptor(s) rat sarcoma virus (Ras), which binds GTP
  and recruits a protein kinase, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (Raf). The latter
  relays the signal to another kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK),
  followed by the transfer to yet another kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK). ERK mediates a variety of cellular events via phosphorylation of a number
  of transcription factors (cell cycle, survival, apoptosis, etc.). AKT phosphorylates
  TSC2, which forms a functional complex with TSC1. Phosphorylation of TSC2 impairs
  the ability of the TSC1-TSC2 complex to act as a GAP toward the small GTPase Rheb.
  Rheb-GTP potently activates mTORC1. Phosphorylation of PRAS40 by Akt and by mTORC1
  itself results in dissociation of PRAS40 from mTORC1 and may relieve an inhibitory
  constraint on mTORC1 activity. Only the key upstream phosphorylation events are
  shown.
