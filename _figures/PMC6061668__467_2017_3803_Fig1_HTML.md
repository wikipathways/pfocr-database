caption: Endothelial injury pathways in thrombotic microangiopathies. Extrinsic factors
  from haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), such as graft versus host
  disease (GVHD), post-conditioning regimens and viruses can all damage endothelium,
  either directly, or via chemotaxis and activation of donor cytotoxic T lymphocytes
  and upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and
  tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Furthermore, activated endothelium itself
  promotes IL-1 and TNF-α, perpetuating the inflammation and damage. Endothelial injury
  exposes collagen and negative charges, which binds von Willebrand factor (vWF),
  and GPIa, which facilitates platelet activation through the platelet glycoprotein
  GP1b. Concomitantly, exposed tissue factor (TF) forms a complex with activated factor
  VIIa and activating factor Xa, leading to the formation of thrombin. This, in turn,
  facilitates the further activation and aggregation of platelets, which, with the
  help of fibrin, forms a thrombus, capable of occluding vessels. TF, in addition
  to the aforementioned cytokines TNF-α and IL-1, upregulate soluble adhesion molecules,
  such as E-selectin, vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular
  adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) to promote leukocyte adhesion and further promote thrombus
  formation. Increased levels of thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and reduced levels of suppressed
  production of prostaglandin I2 (PG12) observed in TA-TMA, fail to suppress platelet
  aggregation precipitated by cytokine-induced endothelial activation. Neutrophil
  extracellular traps (NETs), capable of killing viruses and fungi, are proposed to
  be a fundamental component of TA-TMA, promoting endothelial damage and thrombus
  formation. Furthermore, complement factor Bb and properdin are deposited on NETs,
  with consequent activation of the alternative complement pathway. Factors intrinsic
  to the host by means of genetic variants that alter the alternative complement pathway,
  can result in the unrestricted formation of C3 convertase on the endothelial cell
  surface, converting C3 to C3a and C3b, and ultimately resulting in injury to the
  endothelium through formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) []. The pathophysiology
  of TA-TMA is a dynamic, contemporaneous process that involves many converging pathways.
  Inevitably, it is likely that an admixture of extrinsic and intrinsic factors, with
  relative impact, controls the process and severity of TA-TMA
