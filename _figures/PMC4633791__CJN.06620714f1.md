caption: Activation of effector and regulatory T cells by antigen presenting cells.
  Key surface molecules in activation of (A) T effector cells and (B) T regulatory
  cells (Tregs). The key molecules required for both cells are similar. The T cell
  receptor complex includes CD3, CD2, CD4 or CD8, LFA1, and CD45R, and activation
  of T cell receptor (TCR) by antigen results in Signal 1 for T effector cells and
  Tregs. In effector T cell–lineage T cells, CD28 on the T cells is activated by B7.1
  and B7.2 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and generates Signal 2, which combined
  with Signal 1, initiates effector T-cell activation. The activation of effector
  T cells is augmented by CD40L binding to CD40 and cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-12,
  for generation of Th1 cells. With Tregs, CTLA4 binds to B7.1 and B7.2 and limits
  activation through CD28. Thus, the effector T cells Signal 2 pathway is not required
  for Treg activation. The second signal for Treg activation is generated by IL-2
  binding to the IL-2 receptor, which includes CD25.
