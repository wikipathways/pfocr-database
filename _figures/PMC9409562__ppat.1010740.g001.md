caption: (A) Overview of mechanistic IFN-I signaling, activating ISG expression via
  route of the IFNAR heterodimer and downstream interaction of the kinases JAK1 and
  TYK2 with STAT1/2 transcription factors. (B) Overview of how IFN-I steer immune
  responses in infections caused by Candida species and A. fumigatus. C. albicans
  causes specific enrichment of IFN-I responses, and genetic variations in the IFN-I
  pathway are linked to susceptibility to candidiasis and aspergillosis. While remaining
  controversial in systemic candidiasis, IFN-I are largely found protective on mucosae
  and during aspergillosis rather a protective role is observed. This renders IFN-I
  lucrative as potential immunotherapeutics on mucosal surfaces. CCL8, C-C motif chemokine
  ligand 8/monocyte chemoattractant protein 2; CGD, Chronic granulomatous disease;
  IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; IFN-I/I, type I interferon; III, type III interferon;
  IFNAR, IFN-α/β receptor; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; JAK1, Janus kinase 1;
