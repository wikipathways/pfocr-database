caption: 'A schematic representation of selective pharmacological chaperoning of nAChRs
  in response to chronic nicotine. (A) Nicotine interconverts within milliseconds
  between the protonated membrane-impermeant form and the neutral membrane-permeant
  form. The latter enters cells and enters the ER (red arrow). Here, the charged form
  pharmacologically chaperones nAChRs so that increased numbers exit toward the Golgi
  via the COPII pathway, eventually resulting in receptor up-regulation at the PM.
  Thus, pharmacological chaperoning by nicotine is thought to underlie the process
  of nAChR up-regulation by chronic nicotine. (B) This study finds that nicotine-mediated
  up-regulation also depends on the COPI machinery involved in ER to Golgi and Golgi
  to ER transport of nAChRs. One possible explanation for the COPI dependence is that
  nicotine enters additional organelles and binds more extensively than previously
  thought within the early exocytic pathway, shown by the additional red arrows leading
  to both COPI and COPII vesicles, ERGIC, and cis-Golgi. See also the animation, “Nicotine
  Up-regulates nAChRs”: http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.201311102/DC2.'
