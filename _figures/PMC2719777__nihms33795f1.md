caption: Model of Hedgehog signaling in vertebrates.A. Ptch inhibits Smo in the absence
  of Hh. SMO is unable to activate Gli transcription factors as Sufu binds Gli and
  prevents the transcription of Hh target genes. Hh ligand is bound by Hip on the
  membrane surface.B. Binding of the Hh ligand inhibits Ptch, and relieves the inhibition
  of Smo by Ptch. Smo localizes to the membrane and is now able to activate Gli transcription
  factors. Hh target genes are transcribed.
