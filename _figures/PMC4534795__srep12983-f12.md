caption: (a) A model is proposed, based on our findings (refs , , , ,, and this study)
  and those of others (refs ,,, , ,,), in order to explain the regulatory feedback
  circuit between Nrf1 and the 26S proteasome. The 120-kDa Nrf1 glycoprotein is retrotranslocated
  through the p97/VCP-driven pathway from the ER into the nuclo/cytoplasm where it
  is deglycosylated to yield an active 95-kDa isoform. The latter deglycoprotein is
  proteolytically processed to generate a cleaved 85-kDa Nrf1 isoform by the 26S proteasome
  that is activated by proteasome inhibitors through a feedback loop. In turn, transcriptional
  expression of the 26S proteasome and p97/VCP complexes is regulated by the 95-kDa
  and/or 85-kDa Nrf1 isoforms before the CNC-bZIP transcription factor is subjected
  to further proteasome-mediated processing that creates small Nrf1 isoforms of between
  55-kDa and 25-kDa. Such small polypeptides may also be produced by in-frame translation
  of long Nrf1 mRNA transcripts and subsequently further degraded by the proteasome.
  (b) Schematic representation of a bidirectional regulatory feedback circuit exists
  between Nrf1 and the 26S proteasome. The transcriptional expression of 26S proteasomal
  subunits (e.g. PMSA4 and PMSB6) is regulated predominantly by Nrf1 (see refs ,,,
  , ,,). In turn, different doses of the proteasomal inhibitors MG132 and CI/ALLN
  exert opposing effects on the activity of Nrf1 to mediate expression of genes encoding
  proteasomal subunits. Specifically, at low doses, MG132 and CI/ALLN increase activity
  of Nrf1-target proteasomal subunit gene expressions by increasing the levels of
  the active 95- and/or 85-kDa Nrf1 isoforms, whereas high doses of MG132 and CI/ALLN
  inhibit Nrf1-mediated transcription by increasing the levels of the 36-kDa Nrf1γ
  and 25-kDa Nrf1δ dominant-negative isoforms. However, the detailed rational mechanism(s)
  of this bi-phasic response remains to be determined. In addition, further mechanistic
  study is warranted to identify which proteases enable the endoproteolytic processing
  of either 120-kDa or 95-kDa Nrf1 proteins to yield the cleaved 85-kDa isoform.
