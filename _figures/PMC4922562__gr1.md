caption: YAP/TAZ mechano-sensing signaling pathway network. This is the scheme of
  the computational signaling cascade model. The ECM mechanical properties are transmitted
  to intracellular signals via adhesion molecules, such as FAK. Adhesion molecules
  activation induces RhoA binding with GTP. RhoA-GTP drives the formation of actomyosin
  via mDia and ROCK activation. mDia is a formin that polymerizes F-actin. ROCK can
  both activate myosin and induce F-actin assembly through LIMK and cofilin. Eventually,
  the resultant of F-actin and myosin activity, i.e., stress fibers in 2D systems,
  leads to the YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation. In comparison with the YAP/TAZ mechanical
  sensing mechanism, SRF/MAL senses mechanical inputs by being inhibited by G-actin.
  In addition, the Hippo core component LATS is sensitive to cell-cell interaction.
  In our model, the synergistic effect between the mechanical sensing and the Hippo
  pathway is predicted due to the interaction of LATS and LIMK. To see this figure
  in color, go online.
