caption: 'Wnt signaling has important indirect as well as direct effects on PDCs.
  Wnt signaling is involved in endochondral bone development (pink pathway). One of
  its ligands, Wnt7b, is expressed in the perichondrium dependent on Ihh signaling
  (violet pathway). The Wnt ligand signals via a seven transmembrane G-protein coupled
  receptor (GPCR), Frz, together with LRP5/6 co-receptors, initiating canonical Wnt
  signaling pathway. The Frz receptor leads to phosphorylation and activation of the
  Dsh protein. The activated Dsh inhibits the combination ability of GSK3β, leading
  to accumulation of free and unphosphorylated β-Catenin in the cytoplasm, which then
  translocates to the nucleus. There, β-Catenin binds to TCF/LEF, promoting changes
  in the transcriptional machinery that leads to expression of several target genes.
  Eventually, Wnt signaling promotes osteogenesis and angiogenesis during bone development
  and formation. Interestingly, in the injured periosteum, BMP2 (blue pathway) represses
  β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling to induce chondrogenic cell fate determination.
  In part, it indicates the pro-osteogenesis and anti-chondrogenesis capacity of Wnt
  signaling. However, Wnt signaling is also demonstrated to act on PDCs and induce
  both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. Thus, Wnt signaling enhances osteogenesis,
  its effect on chondrogenesis is not clear. β-catenin-independent pathway (non-canonical
  pathway, pink pathway) is activated when PDCs are loaded with mechanical stress.
  The binding of Wnt ligands to Frz receptor and co-receptor ROR2 induces osteoclastogenesis
  through Jnk. Frz: Frizzled; LRP5/6: lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6; Dsh:
  Disheveled; TCF: T-cell factor; LEF: lymphoid-enhancing factor; Jnk: c-jun N-terminal
  kinase; P: phosphorylation'
