caption: The outcome of transplantation is determined by cosignalling. Full T-cell
  activation requires two signals. The first is antigen-specific recognition of TCR
  and alloantigen presented on MHC. The second is costimulation which can be positive
  or negative. In the presence of positive cosignalling (such as with CD28), T-cell
  proliferation occurs. These activated T cells attack the donor graft and results
  in graft rejection. One the other hand, the activated T-cell response is terminated
  in the presence of negative co-signalling (such as with CTLA-4) which protects the
  graft from destruction.
