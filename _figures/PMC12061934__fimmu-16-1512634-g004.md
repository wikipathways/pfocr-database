caption: The mechanism by which Treg cells (Tregs) affect ischemic stroke (IS). Tregs
  inhibit the proinflammatory response in AIS. However, these cells can also exacerbate
  brain injury through thrombus formation. During subacute and chronic stage of IS,
  Tregs have a protective effect on IS. In subacute IS, Tregs suppress the inflammatory
  response by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines. These cells also inhibit neutrophils-derived
  MMP-9 to release by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway, which alleviated the blood-brain-barrier
  (BBB) disruption. In addition, transplantation of Tregs in the gut alter the microbiota
  and increase the short-chain fatty acid production, which protect the integrity
  of BBB by brain-gut axis. After Tregs infiltration into the brain in the chronic
  stage of IS, Tregs promote the neuronal repair. These cells activate oligodendrocytes
  and M2 phenotypes but inhibited astrocytes to induce neuronal repair

    Tregs inhibit the proinflammatory response in AIS. However, these cells can also
