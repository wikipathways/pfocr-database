caption: 'Schema model of SOS pathway regulated by Ca2+ under saline shock. Ca2+signaling
  triggered by salt stress activate SOS3 causes interaction with SOS2. SOS3/SOS2 complex
  activates SOS1 by direct phosphorylation driven by SOS2 and result in Na+ efflux.
  Alternatively, SOS2 regulates vacuolar channels (CAX and NHX) and balance Na+ vacuolar
  sequestration. CAX: Vacuolar H+/Ca2+ antiporter, CBL: Calcineurin B-like protein,
  CIPK: CBL-interacting protein kinase, NHX: Vacuolar located Na+/H+ antiporters,
  SOS: Salt overly sensitive, SS: Salt stress. SRR: Sal responsive receptors.'
