caption: Paracrine and autocrine mechanisms of Akt-mediated tumor-stromal interactions.
  Carcinoma cells respond to a variety of ligands released by the tumor stroma, including
  SDF1 secreted by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and CCL5 secreted by mesenchymal
  stem cells. Acting through their cognate receptors this induces activation of the
  PI 3-K and Akt pathway leading to modulation of invasive migration. The Akt pathway
  also stimulates the transcriptional induction of VEGF which is then secreted and
  acts in a paracrine manner to stimulate its cognate receptor VEGF-R in endothelial
  cells. This in turn activates PI 3-K and Akt, with a variety of consequences. Akt
  phosphorylates the substrate girdin leading to enhanced endothelial cell migration.
  Akt can also further stimulate the transcriptional induction of VEGF leading to
  an autocrine loop which amplifies PI 3-K signaling. Akt can also directly stimulate
  eNOS (endothelial nitric oxidase synthase) to produce nitric oxide (NO), which can
  function in an amplification loop to further activate Akt. The net effect is enhancement
  of endothelial cell permeability, migration and angiogenesis.
