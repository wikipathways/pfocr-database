caption: Sphingolipid metabolic pathways. Ceramide is the metabolic hub with synthesis
  available via the de novo pathway (blue), via the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (orange)
  or via the salvage of more complex sphingolipids (red, lavender, forest green).
  Ceramides become glycosphingolipids via either conversion to glucosylceramide (lavender)
  or galactosylceramide (red). Ceramide synthases have been labelled to highlight
  their position in the pathways, with additional enzymes, numbered 1–16. 1, Serine
  palmitoyltransferase; 2, 3-ketosphinganine reductase; 3, dihydroceramide desaturase;
  4, sphingomyelinase; 5, sphingomyelin synthase; 6, ceramide kinase; 7, ceramide
  phosphatase; 8, ceramidase; 9, sphingosine kinase; 10, sphingosine-1-phosphatase;
  11, glucosylceramidase; 12, glucosylceramide synthase; 13, lactosylceramide synthase;
  14, galactosylceramidase; 15, ceramide galactosyltransferase; 16, cerebroside sulphotransferase.
