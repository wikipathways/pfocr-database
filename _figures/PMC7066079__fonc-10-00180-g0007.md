caption: A proposed model to illustrate the role of FAM83A in the Wnt and Hippo signaling
  pathways. GSK3β phosphorylates β-catenin and results in the degradation of β-catenin,
  which inhibits the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway. FAM83A can inhibit GSK3β
  activity and increase the level of active unphosphorylated β-catenin; active β-catenin
  then transports into the nucleus and activates the Wnt signaling pathway. Meanwhile,
  similar to β-catenin, FAM83A may also inhibit the phosphorylation and degradation
  of YAP, which is induced by the Hippo signaling pathway and enhance the activity
  of YAP through repressing GSK3β. In addition, FAM83A could downregulate the upstream
  MST to inhibit the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Figures were produced
  using Servier Medical Art (https://smart.servier.com).
