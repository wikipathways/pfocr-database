caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of Cg-LAM. The addition of the first Araf unit
  is thought to occur on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane by a GT-A/B glycosyltransferase
  (). After transportation across the membrane by an unknown ‘flippase’ enzyme, further
  elaboration of the lipoglycan then occurs through the addition of mannose and arabinose
  units catalysed by several GT-C glycosyltransferases utilizing DPM and DPA, respectively
  (; ; ).
