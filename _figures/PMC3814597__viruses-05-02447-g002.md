caption: General activation of interferon-β (IFN-β) transcription and induction of
  IFN-stimulated genes. Biochemical and structural features in the RNA genome or dsRNA
  produced through viral replication is recognized by RIG-I and Mda5 in the cytoplasm
  leading to the activation and translocation of IRF-3 and NF-κB into the nucleus
  where they are involved in initiating the transcription of IFN-β. In addition, 5’-triphosphorylated
  dsRNA in nucleocapsids triggers the activation of RIG-I and its downstream signaling,
  as has been shown for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and La Crosse virus (LACV)
  []. The resulting IFN-β is transported out of the cell where it binds to IFN receptors
  (IFNAR), thereby activating the JAK/STAT pathway leading to the transcription of
  a number of different IFN stimulated genes that aim to restrict viral replication
  and spread and initiate an antiviral state in uninfected cells.
