caption: Cross talk of Na+ and Ca2+signalling between the cell membrane and the mitochondria.Influx
  of Ca2+ into cells is mediated by multiple cell membrane pathways. Among them are
  store operated Ca2+pathway (SOCE), L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (LVGCC) and
  the cationic channel TRPV1. It is followed by rapid Ca2+ influx into the mitochondria
  by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter MCU. Dynamic complexation of MCU with EMRE MICU1
  and MICU2 control the affinity ad intensity of Ca2+ influx via MCU. Mitochondrial
  Ca2+ influx by MCU is followed by a ~100 fold slower Ca2+ efflux through the rate
  limiting mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCLX.The removal of mitochondrial Ca2+
  by NCLX is upregulated by (i) mitochondrial Ca2+ rise triggered by MCU and (ii)
  by cytosolic Na+ rise mediated by TRP channels or by the voltage sensitive Na+ channel
  Nav. Because of the low affinity of NCLX to cytosolic Na+ cytosolic Na+ influx is
  essential for its activation. This Ca2+ and Na+signalling between the cell membrane
  and mitochondria are linked to multiple physiological processes ranging from insulin
  secretion to pain sensation. Impaired mitochondrial MCU or NCLX activity leads to
  mitochondrial Ca2+ overload a major cause for ischemic or neurodegenerative induced
  damage.
