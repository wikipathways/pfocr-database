caption: Nrf2 activation by phytochemicals leading to various events. MAF (musculoaponeurotic
  fibrosarcoma protein) activates antioxidant response genes by interacting with Nrf2
  through ARE signaling, indicating that in response to electrophilic and oxidative
  stresses. In addition, in cancer cells, the imbalance in Nrf2/ARE signaling leads
  to drug resistance, poor prognosis, and cell proliferation. So, the consecutive
  Nrf2 activation might cope with the consequences in a positive manner.
