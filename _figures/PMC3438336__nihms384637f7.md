caption: Following US-induced activation of integrin receptors, FAK autophosphorylates
  at Y397, which is a binding site for Src (; ). Src binds to FAK and is activated
  by autophosphorylation of Y416 in the activation loop of the kinase domain of Src
  (; ). The p130Cas docking protein binds to FAK and Src, forming an FAK-Src-p130Cas
  complex, and then Src phosphorylates p130Cas on Y249 (; ), which is a binding site
  for the CrkII adapter protein (; ). We propose that the binding and activation of
  CrkII leads to the phosphorylation and activation of Erk, which influences numerous
  cellular processes including proliferation, survival, migration, and a wide range
  of gene regulation; however, the pathway through which CrkII signals to Erk has
  not been elucidated in this study.
