caption: Lipid metabolism reprogramming in cancer cells. (1) Combined elevation of
  glucose and glutamine consumption promotes lipogenesis by activating the SREBP/SCAP
  pathway. Glucose produces N-glycans through HBP (Hexosamine Biosynthesis Pathway),
  which stabilizes SCAP (SREBP-cleavage activating protein) through N-linked glycosylation
  of its luminal loops (1 and 7). Glutamine enters the mitochondria and ammonia (NH3)
  is released by GLS (glutaminase). NH3 is protonated and converted to NH4+, which
  directly binds to the aspartate D428 and Serine S326/330 in the core of the SCAP
  transmembrane domains, forming stable hydrogen bonds. This binding triggers a dramatic
  conformation change in SCAP, leading to its dissociation from Insig (insulin-induced
  gene), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein. Subsequently, SCAP escorts
  SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) to the Golgi, where it is cleaved
  by two enzymes S1P (site 1 protease) and S2P (site 2 protease) to release its active
  N-terminal fragment. Finally, the N-terminal domain goes into the nucleus, binds
  to the SRE (sterol regulatory element) motif located in the promoters of gene involved
  in lipogenesis to activate their transcription and promote de novo lipid synthesis
  and tumor growth. (2) Glucose is the main source for lipid synthesis. Glucose via
  glycolysis breaks down into pyruvate, which enters the mitochondria and is converted
  to acetyl-CoA by PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase), followed by condensation with OAA
  (oxaloacetate) to form citrate to enter the TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle).
  Citrate is released to the cytosol via its mitochondria transporter, SLC25A1. Citrate
  is then cleaved to acetyl-CoA by ACLY (ATP citrate lyase), which serves as a precursor
  for fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis catalyzed by a series of enzymes that
  are the main transcriptional targets of SREBPs, as shown in the Figure. In addition,
  cytosol acetate can be converted to acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis by ACCS2 (acetyl-CoA
  synthetase 2). Besides that, acetyl-CoA is also the substrate for the acetylation
  of histones, which is involved in epigenetic regulation. Moreover, glutamine through
  glutaminolysis contributes as an anaplerotic substrate to replenish tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. Glutamate, the product of the first step of glutaminolysis,
  is converted to α-KG (α-ketoglutaric acid) and then enters into the TCA cycle. (3)
  SREBPs upregulates the expression of LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor), which
  binds to LDL and transports it into cells through the endocytosis process. LDL is
  then hydrolyzed in the lysosomes and cholesterol is released, promoting tumor growth.
  (4) Excess fatty acids and cholesterol are converted to TAG (triacylglycerol) and
  CE (cholesteryl ester) by DGAT1 (diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1) and sterol
  O acyl-transferase 1 (SOAT1) to form LDs (lipid droplets) and prevent toxicity from
  high lipid levels. Under conditions of nutrient deficiency, LDs are hydrolyzed by
  autophagy to release free fatty acids and cholesterol for tumor survival.
