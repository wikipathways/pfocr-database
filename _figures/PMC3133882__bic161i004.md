caption: In the absence of activating mutations in key components of the Wnt signalling
  pathway, microenvironmental factors may contribute to transcriptional activation
  of Wnt/β-catenin target genes. For example, interaction of LPA with LPAR or ET with
  ET receptors (ETR) have been shown to block the activity of GSK3β, thereby resulting
  in increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin and enhanced β-catenin-mediated
  transcriptional activity (left-hand panel). Lateral aggregation of collagen-binding
  β1 integrins leads to dissolution of adherens junctions and enhanced nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin. In addition, integrin aggregation enhances the expression of LRP-6
  and Wnt-5a while down-regulating the Wnt pathway inhibitors DKK and CTGF. Mechanical
  compression, exerted on MCAs of metastasizing EOC cells in the form of increased
  intraperitoneal fluid pressure due to accumulated ascitic fluid, may also destabilize
  adherens junctions and promote nuclear translocation of β-catenin (right-hand panel).
