caption: Diaminopimelate/lysine biosynthesis pathways. The four variants of the diaminopimelate/lysine
  biosynthetic pathways starting from tetrahydrodipicolinate are denoted as (A) the
  succinylated or acetylated pathways, (B) the meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase
  pathway, and (C) the L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (DapL) pathway. The abbreviations
  of the enzymes along with the enzyme reaction definitions are listed in Table .
