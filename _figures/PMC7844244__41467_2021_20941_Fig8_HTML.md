caption: a The transferred cDNT not only decreased CD4+ T cell proportion and survival
  and Th17 cell differentiation, but also selectively suppressed the proportion and
  cytokine production of liver-infiltrating M1, but not M2 macrophages. IL-10 secreted
  by M2 macrophages downregulated the immunosuppressive function of cDNT toward M2
  macrophages. b The IL-10/IL-10R interaction could decrease Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression,
  and enhance cytochrome C leakage and caspase-3 activity, leading to decreased cDNT
  survival. The IL-10/IL-10R interaction also activates the PI3K/MAPK signaling pathway,
  which might induce the expression of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A. The inhibition
  of cDNT survival and the promotion of NKG2A expression by the IL-10/IL-10R interaction
  contribute to decreasing cDNT function.
