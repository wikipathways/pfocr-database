caption: 'The four branches of MOB control. The “MOB1 branch”: In human cells, hMOB1
  phosphorylated by MST1/2 promotes the activation of NDR1/2 and LATS1/2 in the context
  of Hippo signalling and the regulation of other important cellular functions [,,].
  The “MOB2 branch”: hMOB2 can interact with the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) DNA damage
  sensor complex, thereby supporting DNA damage and consequently cell cycle signalling
  [,]. The “MOB3 branch”: hMOB3s form a complex with MST1, in so doing regulating
  apoptotic signalling []. The “MOB4 branch”: hMOB4 as part of the STRIPAK (Striatin-interacting
  phosphatase and kinase) complex is likely to support the diverse cellular roles
  of the STRIPAK complex [,]. Notably, it is possible that these MOB branches do not
  signal in isolation, but rather may be interlinked as highlighted by dashed grey
  lines. For example, hMOB2 may connect with the “MOB1 branch” by competing with hMOB1
  for NDR1/2 binding [,], the hMOB3s may link with the “MOB1 branch” through competing
  with hMOB1 for MST1/2 binding [,], or hMOB4 as part of the GCKIII-containing STRIPAK
  complex may connect with the “MOB1 branch” through GCKIII-mediated phosphorylation
  of NDR1/2 (see subchapter 4). Noteworthy, Hippo and STRIPAK signalling have already
  been found to be interconnected (see subchapter 4), although, to our knowledge,
  the specific roles of hMOB4 have not been defined. hMOBs are in green. MST1/2 and
  NDR/LATS kinases are in yellow and red, respectively. Established interactions are
  highlighted by black lines, while putative interconnections between “MOB branches”
  are shown by dashed grey lines. Phosphorylations are indicated by “P” in blue.'
