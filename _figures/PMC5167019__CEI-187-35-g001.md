caption: Different signalling pathway targets already used for interventions to reverse
  immunosenescence. Immune cells use receptor‐mediated signalling pathways to respond
  to their ligands. With ageing, the changes in the signalling pathways may lead to
  changes in immune cell functions of the innate and the adaptive immune response.
  To improve the functioning of the immune cells with ageing, these signalling pathways
  seem to be good targets. The main targets used in various studies in vitro (*) and
  in vivo (†) are indicated. ? Suggests that other possible targets not yet explored
  in the context of immunosenescence.
