caption: Proposed model for the mechanism by which ARM promotes chemoresistance via
  PPARγ/ABCG2 pathway. Adipose tissue, which is composed of various types of cells
  including adipocytes, fibroblasts, immune cells and endothelial cells, secrete various
  factors such as fatty acids, lipids and adipokines to form ARM. When fatty acids
  are transported into EOC cells by different receptors, including FABPs, CD36 and
  FATPs and adipokines bind with their receptors, the PPARγ/ABCG2 pathway is upregulated.
  Thus, ARM promotes chemoresistance by increasing ABCG2 expression via upregulation
  of PPARγ. Therefore, inhibition of ARM-educated PPARγ can attenuate chemoresistance
  and decrease the undesirable side effects of chemotherapy. FABPs, fatty acid-binding
