caption: Molecular mechanisms of SN2, SP6A, CDF1 genes and their role in the regulation
  of potato tuberization. In wild-type potato (left panel), SN2 functions as a positive
  regulator of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling by upregulating the ABA receptor StPYL1
  and repressing PP2C, which in turn, activates SnRK2.2/2.3/2.6 kinases and enhances
  ABI5-mediated transcription, promoting tuber initiation. SP6A encodes a mobile FT-like
  protein that integrates H2O2 signaling with photoperiod and sucrose-responsive pathways.
  H2O2 accumulation induces SP6A expression, repressing StCO, and GA biosynthesis
  (GA20ox1), while activating StBEL5, StCDPK1, POTH1, and StRboh to drive stolon swelling
  and tuber formation. CDF1, under short-day conditions, is rhythmically expressed
  from a 288 bp light- and clock-responsive promoter and represses StCO, thereby derepressing
  SP6A and activating the tuberization program. Under long-day conditions, CDF1 is
  destabilized by StFKF1 and StGI, preventing premature tuber formation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
  knockout of StSN2 (right panel) diminishes ABA signal amplification, suppressing
  ABI5 activation and leading to reduced tuber formation. Disruption of SP6A abolishes
  H2O2 responsiveness, silencing downstream signaling and inhibiting tuber induction.
  Targeted deletion of cis-elements within the CDF1 promoter reduces its photoperiod-regulated
  expression amplitude, delaying tuber initiation by ~5–6 days and moderately reducing
  plant biomass, while maintaining its rhythmic expression pattern
