caption: Chronic immune activation is a multifactorial process driven by many cell
  types, including conventional DCs (cDCs), pDCs, T cells, or NK cells. DCs recognizing
  HIV or microbial components through TLRs or other pattern recognition receptors
  secrete IFN-α and inflammatory cytokines, inducing activation of other cell types
  (e.g., NK cells). Activated NK cells can lyse virally infected cells directly or
  through ADCC. Inhibitors of the TLR pathway or of cytokine signaling can be used
  to tune down the inflammatory response. For example, chloroquine () and short oligonucleotides
  (ODNs) block activation of endosomal TLR. Rapamycin inhibits mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, necessary for recruitment of MyD88 to TLRs (). STAT
  decoys can inhibit the transcriptional program induced in target cells by inflammatory
  cytokines. Synthetic mimetics of defensins, peptides with antimicrobial activity,
  could be used to protect gut epithelium from bacterial invasion and enhance anti-HIV
  immune responses. TRAF6, TNF receptor–associated factor 6; IRAK1, IL-1 receptor–associated
  kinase 1.
