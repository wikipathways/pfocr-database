caption: Extracellular Vesicle-Based Cancer Immunotherapies. (a) Tumour-derived EVs
  carrying tumour-specific and tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) and modified breast
  tumour-derived exosomes (TEX) with miR-155, miR-142, and let-7i, may be reasonably
  used as sources to stimulate T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) against cancer cells.
  (b) EVs have been genetically engineered for displaying specific monoclonal antibodies
  on their surface, such as anti-CD3 and anti-HER2 (human epidermal growth factor
  receptor 2) or anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) resulting in novel synthetic
  multivalent antibodies retargeted exosomes (SMART-EXO) that can simultaneously target
  immune and cancer cells. (c) A novel HER2-specific exosome-T vaccine using polyclonal
  CD4+ T cells armed with exosomes derived from HER2-specific DCs (EXO-T) has been
  developed. Distinct three signals derived from novel EXO-T vaccine include (1) exosomal
  pMHC-I/TCR, (2) exosomal CD80/CD28 and T cell CD40L/CD40 (for T-cell memory formation),
  and (3) T-cell cytokine IL-2 (for T-cell proliferation). Conversion of exhausted
  CD8+ CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) within tumours by EXO-T cells via a T cell CD40L/CD40-activated
  mTORC1 pathway can also occur.
