caption: (A) Signaling pathways that regulate autophagy. In fed conditions, insulin
  (INS) and/or growth factors, MTOR complex 1 (MTORC1) is activated via a known signaling
  pathway including class I PI3K and negatively regulates downstream kinases such
  as PIK3C3 and ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) leading to a prevention
  of autophagy. In this condition, MTORC1 is also a key regulator of cell growth.
  Under starvation, the activity of MTORC1 is suppressed releasing the inhibition
  of PIK3C3 and ULK1 and allowing the induction of the autophagy machinery. (B) Cellular
  functions of PIK3C3. The process of autophagy starts with the generation of autophagosomes
  that then fuse with the lysosome allowing the degradation of the autophagosome contents.
  Our results using SAR405 demonstrated that PIK3C3 has a dual role during the initial
  steps of autophagy, with the generation of autophagosomes, and also during endocytosis
  between late endosomes to lysosomes.
