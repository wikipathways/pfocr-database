caption: 'Training sets and features used for machine-leaning-based identification
  of digenic disease gene pairs(A) Digenic gene pairs (positives) were derived from
  the Digenic Diseases Database (DIDA). Unique gene pair combinations (n = 140) were
  used for training and testing. Non-digenic gene pairs (negatives) were derived from
  unaffected relatives of UDN individuals. Genes with rare variants in the same individual
  were used as an unaffected non-digenic gene pair. We also considered several other
  negative training sets, including random gene pairs, permuted pairs of genes involved
  in digenic pairs, and gene pairs matched to attributes of digenic pairs ().(B) We
  considered six network and functional features (NFFs) for training the digenic disease
  classifiers: (1) “pathway similarity,” Jaccard similarity of pathway annotations
  from KEGG and Reactome for both genes; (2) “phenotype similarity,” Jaccard similarity
  of phenotype annotations from HPO for both genes; (3) “co-expression rank,” co-expression
  rank of gene pair compared to all other gene pairs across multiple tissues from
  COXPRESdb; (4–6) “network distances” between the genes on protein-protein, pathway,
  and literature-mined interaction networks from UCSC gene and pathway interaction
  browser database. We also trained classifiers considering additional evolutionary
  and functional features ().'
