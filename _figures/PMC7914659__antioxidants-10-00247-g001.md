caption: 'Schematic representation of three major sources of H2S: enzymatic pathway,
  nonenzymatic pathway, and bacterial origins. Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) catalyzes
  homocysteine to produce Cystathionine. Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) catalyzes cystathionine
  to form l-cysteine or l-cysteine to generate H2S. 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase
  (3MST) produces H2S from 3-mercaptopyruvate, which is generated by cysteine aminotransferase
  (CAT) and d-amino acid oxidase (DAO) from l-cysteine and d-cysteine, respectively.
  Another source of endogenous H2S is coming from nonenzymatic processes. The other
  source of H2S is derived from gut microbes, mainly by the sulfate-reducing bacteria
  (SRB).'
