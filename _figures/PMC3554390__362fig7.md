caption: Schematic diagram depicting direct competition between glucose and lipids
  for fat storage as triglycerides in adipocytes during catch-up fat. During catch-up
  fat on an LF (high-carbohydrate) diet, the increased DNL pathway leads to enhanced
  insulin-dependent glucose utilization in adipose tissue and liver, which contributes
  to maintaining normal blood glucose homeostasis. By contrast, during catch-up fat
  on an HF diet, the increased availability of dietary lipids markedly inhibits the
  activity of key lipogenic enzymes (G6PDH and FAS) and provides substrates for triglyceride
  (TG) synthesis and storage in adipose tissue. Thus, substrate competition between
  dietary fat and carbohydrates for TG storage in adipose tissue, via the inhibition
  of DNL, will lead to diminished glucose utilization in adipocytes and hepatocytes,
  thereby promoting glucose intolerance during catch-up growth.
