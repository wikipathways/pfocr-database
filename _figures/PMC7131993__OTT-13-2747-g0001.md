caption: Increased matrix stiffness can affect cells in different signaling pathways
  in colorectal cancer (CRC). Increased matrix stiffness can induce the activation
  of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC cells, then 1) promote the translocation of β-catenin
  into the nucleus, and initiate a series of changes in gene level, leading to the
  proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells, 2) Promote the detachment of β-catenin
  from E-cadherin, resulting in instability of cell-to-cell connections and promoting
  metastasis. An increase in matrix stiffness can also increase the translocation
  of YAP to the nucleus via the FAK/Src pathway, thereby altering the characteristics
  of the tumor stem cells. The increase in matrix stiffness also promotes the conversion
  of Rho GDP to Rho GTPases. The activation of Rho 1) induces myocardin-related transcription
  factor A (MRTF-A) to remove G-actin, enter the nucleus to participate in a series
  of regulation, and 2) increase the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and promote
  cell contraction. Black arrows indicate events in which a series of effects of matrix
  stiffness on the cellular pathway occur.
