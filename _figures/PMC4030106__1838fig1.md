caption: 'Roles of IL-21 and IRF4 in immune and metabolic regulation. The biological
  effect of IL-21 is mediated by the IL-21R/γ chain (γc)-STAT3 signaling pathway,
  which induces the expression of IRF4 in T cells. IRF4 is a multifunctional transcription
  factor. It is required for IL-21–mediated Th17 cell differentiation. In addition,
  IRF4 skews macrophages toward the M2 phenotype and promotes lipolysis in adipocytes
  during fasting. Il-21 deficiency in mice leads to a mixed Irf4 phenotype: a loss
  of function in T cells (increased Tregs) and gain of function in adipocytes and
  macrophages (increased lipolysis and M2 activation, respectively). A potential mechanism
  for the metabolic effect in adipocytes is that Il-21 interferes with the fasting
  signal that activates the FoxO1-Irf4 axis. A similar link to FoxO1 in the liver
  could be responsible for the enhanced gluconeogenesis in the liver of Il-21 KO mice.
