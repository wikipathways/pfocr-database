caption: Activation of TAZ upon epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human breast
  cancer cells. A schematic of components of the mammalian Hippo pathway in epithelial
  (left) and mesenchymal-like (right) states of breast cancer cells. Components addressed
  by Cordenonsi and colleagues are shown in red. The authors demonstrated that Scribble
  is delocalized from the plasma membrane upon epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT), leading to stabilization of the TAZ protein and its translocation to the
  nucleus, where it activates downstream targets. Question marks indicate open questions.
