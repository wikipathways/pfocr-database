caption: Schematic representation of the relationship between RAGE and neurite outgrowth
  after spinal cord injury. The binding RAGE to HMGB1 promotes Rac, Cdc42 pathway
  and is involved in the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton. Also, the binding RAGE to
  S100B increases cell motility and is related to CREB, NF-κB, STAT3 signaling. These
  mechanisms result in the promotion of neurite outgrowth and finally may improve
  the functional decline after spinal cord injury.
