caption: 'The primary motor neuron components and lipidome pathways in MND/HSP. (A)
  Simplified schematic of the core components of the primary motor pathway, including
  upper and lower motor neurons, for the transmission of voluntary commands from the
  primary motor cortex to skeletal muscles. (B) Classic and alternative pathways through
  which cholesterol can be converted into primary bile acids. The classical pathway
  is initiated by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) located in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) of the liver, catalysing the conversion of cholesterol to 7α-OH. The alternative
  pathways are initiated by three enzymes: (i) the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase
  (CYP27A1) requiring mitochondrial cholesterol import, primarily via the ER and lipid
  droplets, mediated by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and StAR-related
  lipid transfer domain (StarD) proteins (; ); (ii) the liver microsomal sterol 25-hydroxylase
  (CH25H); and (iii) the brain sterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), forming 27-OH, 25-OH
  and 24-OH, respectively. Oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) catalyses the 7α-hydroxylation
  of both 25- and 27-OH to 7α,25- and 7α,27-diOH, whereas liver microsomal oxysterol
  7α-hydroxylase II (CYP39A1) catalyses the 7α-hydroxylation of 24-OH to 7α,24-diOH
  (). In the liver the 7α-hydroxylated oxysterols converge in the common bile acid
  pathway, initiated by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B7), where they are further
  modified to form the primary bile acids. (C) Enzymatically (blue and green) and
  ROS (orange) derived oxysterols, highlighting the importance and multiple enzymatic
  roles of the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) in oxysterol metabolism.
  CA = cholestanoic acid; ChEH = cholesterol epoxide hydrolase; HSD = hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase; none = cholestenone; ROS = reactive oxygen species. Figure adapted
  from . (D) Biosynthetic pathways for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis. The
  primary routes of PE synthesis include the Kennedy pathway (enzymes shown in red)
  and the phosphatidylserine (PS) decarboxylase pathway in mitochondria. PE is formed
  from ethanolamine via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway comprising
  three enzymatic steps. Two additional pathways of PE production: the acylation of
  lyso-PE catalysed by lyso-PE-acyltransferase (MBOAT2), and the synthesis from PS
  via PS-synthase-2 (PTDSS2). The CDP-choline branch of the Kennedy pathway forms
  phosphatidylcholine (PC), also via three enzymatic steps. PE and PC synthesized
  via the Kennedy pathway is catalysed by PS-synthase-1 and 2 (PTDSS1/2) to PS, which
  can be transported to the inner mitochondrial membrane where PSD (encoded by PISD)
  decarboxylates it to PE. Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase 2 (PEMT2)
  methylates PE to form PC. DDHD1/2 may also play a role in maintaining PE homeostasis.'
