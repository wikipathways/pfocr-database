caption: Interactions between alcohol-induced mechanisms leading to hepatic carcinogenesis.
  Alcohol mediates several mechanisms of hepatocyte proliferation and carcinogenesis.
  These include pathways of ethanol metabolism, which generate acetaldehyde and induction
  of CYP2E1, both of which promote generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation,
  and DNA strand breaks. Alcohol leads to hypomethylation of DNA and also harms the
  retinoic acid pathway; both of these promote oncogene activation and induce carcinogenesis.
  Several host factors, for example gene polymorphisms (C282Y heterozygosity and CYP2E1
  c2) lead to enhanced incidence of carcinogenesis. Iron overload and neoangiogenesis
  are both associated with alcoholic liver disease and HCC. Finally, the immune system
  is of major importance, with NK cells having a protective effect and TLR4/Nanog
  promoting the alcohol-induced occurrence of HCC
