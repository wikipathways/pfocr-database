caption: 'Possible sites of action of thymoquinone in the NO/cGMP/KATP channel pathway.
  Nitric oxide (NO) is either released exogenously by SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine,
  the NO donor) or synthesized endogenously from its major precursor L-arginine (L-Arg)
  by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO can activate the enzyme soluble guanylyl
  cyclase resulting in an increase in the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) synthesis.
  Cyclic GMP, as a second messenger, modulates various intracellular targets such
  as PKG (cGMP-dependent protein kinase) and cGMP-regulated KATP and Kv channels,
  which contribute to the synaptic transmission of pain impulses in the central and
  peripheral nervous systems. Dashed arrows indicate an inhibitory effect. SUR1: sulfonylurea
  receptor-1'
