caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanisms underlying preconditioning (PC)-induced
  ischemic tolerance. PC-evoked astrocytic activation induces CD147 expression via
  the P2X7 receptor/HIF-1α signaling pathway. This CD147 expression assists with the
  translocation of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 and MCT4 to the cell membrane,
  thereby promoting lactate release from astrocytes during severe ischemia; this effect
  likely plays a role in ischemic tolerance
