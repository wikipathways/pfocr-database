caption: Interaction between Trp metabolites and AS. Kyn significantly boosted OPG
  and OCN expressions by enhancing bone mineralization and suppressing RANKL-mediated
  OC differentiation. There was an inverse relationship between 5-HT levels and pCREB
  activation. Melatonin showed a positive correlation with OCN and IL-1β expression,
  as well as BASDAI, BASFI, the duration of morning stiffness, and CRP levels. IAA
  derived from gut microbiota down-regulated cytokine levels including TNF-α, IL-6,
  IL-17A, and IL-23, as well as improved the generation of anti-inflammatory cytokine
  IL-10. IAA could also enhance the intestinal barrier, relieve pathological changes,
  and reshape the gut microbiota. IAA stimulated the AhR pathway, up-regulating FoxP3
  and increased Treg cells, down-regulating RORγt and STAT3, and decreasing Th17 cells.
