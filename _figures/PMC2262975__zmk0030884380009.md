caption: Comparison of the pheromone response pathways of opaque cells (A) and white
  cells (B). The roles of some of the components (the trimeric G protein α and γ subunits
  and CST20) in the models were not analyzed here, but they were inferred from the
  conserved and more thoroughly studied pheromone response pathway of S. cerevisiae.
  The distinctive points of the comparison are that the components of pathways from
  receptor through the MAP kinase cascade are shared, whereas the terminal regulatory
  component, the response-specific transcription factor, differs. Although CPH1 is
  the downstream regulator in the opaque pheromone response pathway, the downstream
  regulator in the white pheromone response pathway remains unidentified, hence the
  question mark. Although FAR1 plays a major role as a downstream regulator in the
  opaque pheromone response pathway, its functions have no analogies in the white
  pheromone response pathway, so it has not been represented in the opaque model.
