caption: Overexpression of HER2D16, a HER2 exon-16 splice variant, is a novel mediator
  of osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
  is associated with reactivation of EGFR pathway signaling. In the discussed report,
  the authors demonstrate that HER2D16 can homodimerize and/or heterodimerize with
  mutant EGFR and WT EGFR. Additionally, as HER2D16 expression frequently occurs with
  HER2 amplification, it may form heterodimers with WT HER2. HER2D16 overexpression
  was sufficient to cause osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell with a
  T790M mutation and was associated with reactivation of EGFR and downstream mitogenic/proliferative
  pathways such as the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. The combination of afatinib, a
  pan-HER TKI, and osimertinib overcame HER2D16-mediated resistance. Future studies
  are needed to determine if HER2D16 drives resistance solely through reactivation
  of MAPK and/or AKT or if other known functions of HER2D16 such as suppression of
  apoptosis and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition also play a role. EMT,
