caption: D-PDMP inhibits ox-LDL induced LCS activity and atherosclerosis development.
  Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) activates LacCer synthase (LCS) to produce large quantities
  of LacCer, which stimulates the activity of NADPH oxidase. Concomitantly, there
  is an increase in the generation of superoxide radicals (ROS). ROS mediates p44MAPK
  phosphorylation thereby stimulating c-fos expression, promoting cell proliferation
  of vascular-smooth-muscle cells further to angiogenesis and generation of atherosclerosis.
  D-PDMP, a potent inhibitor of LCS, impaired ox-LDL mediated induction of LCS activity
  thereby inhibiting the above pathway.
