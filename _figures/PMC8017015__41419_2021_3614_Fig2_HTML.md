caption: Schematic representation of doxorubicin-induced ferroptosis pathway. Doxorubicin
  treatment results in iron overload through upregulation of TfR and inactivation
  of ferritin. Free iron complexes with doxorubicin and through the Fenton reaction
  create reactive oxygen species (ROS). Doxorubicin induces lipid peroxidation by
  inhibiting cytosolic and mitochondrial GPX4 resulting in ferroptosis. In the mitochondria,
  doxorubicin causes iron overload by blocking MitoFer and ABCB8. In the nucleus,
  activation of NRF2 results in upregulation of HMOX1 leading to heme degradation
  and resulting in excess free iron and ferroptosis. Tf transferrin, TfR transferrin
