caption: Schematic showing the activation of the Ras to ERK pathway by growth factor
  binding to a receptor tyrosine kinase. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization
  and autophosphorylation. The Grb2 adapter protein binds to activated receptors and
  increases association of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos to Ras, resulting
  in Ras loading of GTP and activation. Ras enhances membrane recruitment and activation
  of the Raf protein kinases, which activate MEKs, leading to ERK activation. Once
  activated, ERKs phosphorylate cytoplasmic substrates and translocate to the nucleus
  to phosphorylate nuclear targets.
