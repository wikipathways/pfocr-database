caption: 'Summary of BLV and HTLV-1 genes and their precursors and proteins produced
  (structural and enzymatic). Gene: Gag, Precursor: Pr44gag, Proteins: P15/MA (bind
  the genomic viral RNA - interact with the lipid bilayer of the viral membrane -
  proteolytically processed to generate three fragments: p10, a seven amino acids
  product, and p4) - P12/NC (Tightly bind to the packaged genomic RNA) - P24/CA (The
  major constituent of the capsid (CA) of BLV virions - The major target for the host
  immune response). Gene: Pro (Prt), Precursor: pr66gag-prt, Proteins: p14/Prt (Protease).
  Gene: Pol, Precursor: Pr145, Proteins: P80/RT+IN (contains all of the tryptic peptides
  of the gag-protease precursor - encodes reverse transcriptase (RT), (RNA dependent
  DNA polymerase). Gene: Env, Precursor: Pr72env, Proteins: Gp51/SU (The extracellular
  SU is very immunogenic, a useful tool for diagnostics and vaccine development) -
  Gp30/TM (The TM transmembrane protein is a key factor in cell fusion during transmission
  and is involved in signal transduction via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motifs (ITAM) present in the cytoplasmic tail). Gene: pX, Precursor: Tax ORF, Proteins:
  Tax (p34) (Transcriptional activator of viral expression - target of the host immune
  response with T and B epitopes - Oncogenic potential - Activation of NF-kappa B
  (NF-κB) pathway - Inhibition of DNA repair of oxidative damage, increase accumulation
  of mutations in cellular DNA - Induction of DNA damage, cellular senescence and
  apoptosis - directly binds to tristetraprolin (TTP), a post-transcriptional modulator
  of TNFα expression – regulate many cellular proteins by direct binding) - Rex (p18)
  (Nuclear export of viral mRNAs - post-transcriptional regulation) - R3 (p5) (The
  maintenance of high viral load) - p12I (Maintenance of viral infectivity - Activation
  of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway) - G4 (p11) like p13II (The
  maintenance of high viral load - Oncogenic potential) - p13II (Suppression of viral
  replication - Interaction with farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase - Activation of
  Ras-mediated apoptosis) - p30II (Suppression of viral replication - Regulation of
  gene transcription by binding with p300 - Enhancement of Myc transforming potential)
  - HBZ (Inhibition of HTLV-1 transcription - suppression of the classical pathway
  of NF-κB - Enhancement of TGF-β signaling - Oncogenic potential)'
