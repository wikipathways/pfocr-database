caption: TNFR2 can modulate TNFR1 signaling. TNFR1, activated by soluble TNF (sTNF)
  or membrane TNF (memTNF), recruits TRAF2 adapter protein trimers enabling transactivation
  of the TRAF2-associated E3 ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2 and activation of the classical
  NFκB pathway but also other proinflammatory signaling pathways not indicated here
  (Left). In addition, in TNFR1 signaling the TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complexes inhibit triggering
  of cell death by K63 ubiquitination of RIP (Left). TNFR2 activation by memTNF recruits
  TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complexes, too, and triggers classical NFκB signaling (Right). Due
  to the higher expression levels of TNFR2 and its ability to trigger TRAF2 degradation,
  however, TNFR2 activation can result in a substantial depletion of cytosolic TRAF2-cIAP1/2
  complexes (Right). This entails enhanced alternative NFκB signaling and sensitizes
  for TNFR1-induced death signaling. For details see text.
