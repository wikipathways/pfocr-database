caption: 'Antioxidant mechanisms of pyruvate. (1) Pyruvate non-enzymatically detoxifies
  peroxynitrite (ONOO−) to nitrite and peroxides (ROOH) to their conjugate alcohols
  (ROH). (2) Via the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) equilibrium, pyruvate oxidizes cytosolic
  NADH, regenerating NAD+ for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and
  decreasing superoxide (•O2−) formation by NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX). (3) Pyruvate carboxylation
  by malic enzyme increases mitochondrial concentrations of Krebs cycle intermediates,
  including citrate and isocitrate, thereby supporting NADPH production by mitochondrial
  NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH). (4) Citrate effluxes to the cytosol
  via tricarboxylate transporters (TCT), where it is converted by aconitase (ACON)
  to isocitrate, providing substrate for NADPH formation by cytosolic ICDH. (5) Citrate
  inhibits phosphofructokinase (PFK), thereby diverting glycolytic flux into the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP). (6) NADPH generated by mechanisms 3, 4 and 5 provides reducing
  power to reduce glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to glutathione (GSH), thereby maintaining
  GSH redox state for the glutathione peroxidases (GPX) and other GSH-dependent antioxidant
  systems. CS: citrate synthase; DAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; DPG: 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate;
  GAP: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; GR: glutathione reductase; MCT: monocarboxylate
  transporter; PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; PGI: phosphoglucose isomerase. See text
  for details.'
