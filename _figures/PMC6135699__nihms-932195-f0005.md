caption: NF-κB signaling is highly regulated via post-translational modification throughout
  the entire pathway. A20 can act as both a ubiquitin ligase or as a deubiquitinase.
  For example, here we depict its role in inhibiting ubiquitination of TRAF6, although
  it can also target TRAF2 and cIAP1. CYLD is a constitutively expressed deubiquitinase
  that targets RIP1, IKKγ, TRAF2, and TRAF6. Cezanne is another deubiquitinase that
  targets TRAF6 in the canonical NF-κB pathway, but also inhibits noncanonical NF-κB.
