caption: Dietary phytochemicals targeting Wnt, TGF-β, JAK/STAT, NOTCH, PI3K, and TNF-α
  signaling pathways involved in EMT transitions. Curcumin and black pepper inhibit
  the WNT-β catenin pathway, Ginger and its compounds inhibit TGF-β, TNF-α, and JAK/STAT
  pathway, and the PI3 K pathway was inhibited by clove and Fennel
