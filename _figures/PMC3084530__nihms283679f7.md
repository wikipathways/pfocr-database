caption: The rigid chaperone domain (Ch) of MESD binds to the newly synthesized BP
  domain of LRP6, serving as a folding template. After BP domain properly folded,
  MESD switches the binding from the rigid chaperone domain to the flexible escort
  domain (Es), safely guarding the mature receptor traveling from the ER to the Golgi,
  preventing premature ligand (Lig) binding. The acidic environment of the Golgi activates
  the histidine switch in the BP domain that leads to the dissociation of MESD from
  the receptor. MESD will be retrieved back to the ER by the KDEL-receptor. The properly
  folded receptor will be properly post-translationally modified and further reach
  the cell membrane for activation of canonical WNT pathway. RAP goes through a similar
  cycle for promoting the ligand-binding domain folding and trafficking as described
  before ().
