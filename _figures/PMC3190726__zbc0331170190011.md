caption: Schematic representation of the dual ERK1-dependent impact on regulated processing
  and transcription of PrPc. Stimulation of M1/M3 muscarinic receptors triggers PKC-dependent
  activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Activated ERK1 then 1) directly phosphorylates
  ADAM17 on its intracytoplasmic threonine residue at position 735, thereby increasing
  ADAM17 activity, the processing of PrPc at the 111/112 peptidyl bond, and the secretion
  of the neuroprotective N1 fragment; 2) increases PrPc promoter transactivation and
  mRNA levels in an AP1-dependent manner. Mutational analysis indicates that AP-1
  directly activates PrPc transcription likely after formation of well documented
  ERK-1-dependent build-up with phosphorylation of c-Fos and its subsequent association
  with phospho-c-Jun (). Therefore, under physiological conditions, ERK1 participates
  via two distinct processes (elevation of both substrate levels and enzyme activity)
  to an overall increase of the N1-associated neuroprotective phenotype.
