caption: 'Schematic representation of the IGF/IGF-1R axis: (1) Insulin-like growth
  factor (IGF-1/2) binds to its receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R),
  triggering a cascade of events that ultimately lead to the activation of the insulin
  receptor substrate (IRS). Once activated, IRS initiates the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway,
  which plays a crucial role in promoting cell survival. This is achieved through
  a reduction in apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death, and an increase in
  protein synthesis, which aids in cellular growth and maintenance. Overall, the activation
  of IRS and the subsequent PI3K-AKT signaling pathway are essential for maintaining
  healthy cellular functions. (2) The SHC protein acts as a signal transducer, triggering
  the activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK and JNK/MAPK pathways. These pathways, in turn,
  activate specific transcription factors that regulate the expression of target genes.
  By orchestrating this complex signaling cascade, the SHC protein plays a crucial
  role in coordinating cellular responses to diverse extracellular stimuli. This process
  is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and adapting to changing environmental
  conditions. (3) In addition to the activation of ligand-dependent signaling pathways,
  insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) 1–6 can also trigger ligand-independent
  signaling pathways. This means that IGFBPs can influence cellular processes even
  when not bound to IGFs. IGF-1R: Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase;
