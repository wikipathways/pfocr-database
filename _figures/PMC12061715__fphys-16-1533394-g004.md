caption: 'Mechanism of inflammatory factors, myostatin (MSTN) and ATF4 involved in
  reduced protein synthesis: In the context of inflammation, oxidative stress and
  glucocorticoid overflow, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α
  activate NF-κB, p38MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways. The activation of NF-κB pathway
  also promotes the expression of TNF-α and MSTN, whereas the increase of ROS also
  activates NF-κB pathway and inhibits mTORC1 signal transduction; MSTN first combines
  with actriib, and then with ALK4/5 to synthesize a complex and activate it. Smad2/3
  phosphorylation induced Smad2/3 and Smad4 to form a complex, leading to the inactivation
  of Akt. Once Akt/mTORC1 signaling was blocked, protein synthesis decreased. In the
  process of fasting, immobilization, and aging, activated ATF4 promotes the expression
  of GADD45α protein, whereas, under denervation, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) promotes
  the expression of GADD45α. Briefly, these factors interact to inhibit mTORC1 signal
  transduction, resulting in reduced protein synthesis, which eventually leads to
  muscle atrophy'
