caption: Summary of the possible mechanism leading to Tourette syndrome (TS) associated
  with the immune response/inflammation. Bacterial infection leads to over-activation
  of the peripheral immune response, producing a large number of inflammatory cytokines,
  which diffuse into the brain across the BBB and lead to neuroinflammation. Virus
  or allergens cloud also mediate the release of inflammatory cytokines. Excessive
  inflammatory cytokines can also lead to microglia M1 hyperpolarization via the JAK2/STAT3
  and NF-κB pathways, which may impair striatal dopaminergic neurons, causing over-release
  of dopamine (DA), resulting in tics. Anti-neuronal antibodies also play an important
  role in the pathogenesis of TS mediated by infection. Anti-neuronal antibodies produced
  after bacterial infection, particularly streptococcus infection, interact with neuronal
  surface antigens, which activate microglia via the CAMK II pathway, leading to impaired
  dopaminergic neurons, ultimately, leading to tic syndrome
