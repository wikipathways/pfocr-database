caption: Roles of YbeY/YbeZ in P. aeruginosa. YbeY/YbeZ are involved in the maturation
  of 16S rRNA and ribosome assembly (). Meanwhile, YbeY influences the levels of multiple
  sRNAs. One of the direct regulatory targets of YbeY is the sRNA ReaL. ReaL binds
  to the 5′-untranslated region of the rpoS mRNA, inhibiting its translation (). RpoS
  is an alternative sigma factor that has been demonstrated to contribute to bacterial
  responses to oxidative stresses by activating the expression of the major catalase
  KatA in P. aeruginosa (). YbeY directly degrades ReaL, thereby positively regulating
  the expression of RpoS (). In addition, YbeY and YbeZ control the expression of
  the T3SS and T6SS genes as well as biofilm formation through the RetS-GacS/GacA-RsmY/Z-RsmA
  pathway. YbeY and YbeZ repress the transcription of retS through an unknown mechanism.
  RetS directly binds to GacS, which inhibits the phosphorelay-dependent activation
  of GacA. GacA activates the expression of two sRNAs, RsmY and RsmZ, that antagonize
  the function of RsmA. RsmA is a posttranscriptional regulator that activates the
  expression of the T3SS genes and represses the expression of the T6SS genes as well
  as the extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis pel and psl genes, which are important
  for biofilm formation ().
