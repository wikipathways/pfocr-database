caption: The result of ‘Networks’ query way. (A) The result of ‘KEGG Pathway’ query.
  Candidate proteins should be entered first and KEGG pathway ID should be selected.
  A colored KEGG pathway will be drawn with drug targets highlighted in the result.
  Orange means drug targets in our database, blue means the queried proteins. (B)
  The result of ‘PPI’ query. The page demonstrates association network of ERBB2 in
  Breast cancer with 900 score threshold of network edge and multi-level annotation
  of network node. Nodes are divided into three colored sectors. Red means the protein
  is differentially expressed. Blue means the protein is with variations. Yellow means
  the protein has PTMs. The gray edge means that this protein is a drug target.
