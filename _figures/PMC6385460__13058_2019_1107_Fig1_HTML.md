caption: Schematic illustration of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in TNBC tumor growth
  and progression. mTORC1 comprises mTOR, mammalian lethal with sec-13 protein 8 (mLST8),
  and regulatory-associated protein of mammalian target of rapamycin (RAPTOR). mTORC1
  is activated by growth factors, nutrients (amino acids), and cellular energy. It
  stimulates anabolic processes, including protein and nucleotide synthesis via ribosomal
  protein S6 kinase (S6K), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding
  protein 1 (4E-BP1), and hinders catabolic processes, such as autophagy, through
  Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1). mTORC2 consists of mTOR, mLST8, mammalian stress-activated
  map kinase-interacting protein 1 (mSIN1), and rapamycin-insensitive companion of
  mTOR (RICTOR) and is activated by growth factors. mTORC2 activates the AGC kinase
  family members Akt, serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK), and protein kinase
  C (PKC). mTORC1 and mTORC2 are commonly activated in human cancers. AMPK activation
  inhibits mTORC1; however, the effect on mTORC2/Akt is not completely clear. Moreover,
  AMPK activation represses expression of EGFR, cyclin D1, and cyclin E and phosphorylation
  of MAPK, Src, and STAT3
