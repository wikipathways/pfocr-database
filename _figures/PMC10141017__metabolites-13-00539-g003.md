caption: 'A heat map depicting the individual concentrations of intermediate metabolites
  of the glycolysis pathway in Mexican mint (Plectranthus amboinicus) plants under
  varying watering regimes (n = 3). Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate
  (F6P), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (DHAP), 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PG), 2-phosphoglyceric acid (2PG), phosphoenolpyruvic
  acid (PEP), and pyruvic acid (PA). Metabolite concentrations in each block compartment
  are normalized across all data for an individual compound such that similar color
  intensities between compounds can represent widely differing concentrations. The
  red color represents a lower concentration, and the green color represents a higher
  concentration of a particular metabolite. The compartment was arranged from left
  to right as follows: regular watering (RW), drought (DR), resumption of regular
  watering after drought (RH), flooding (FL), and resumption of regular watering after
  flooding (DHFL).'
