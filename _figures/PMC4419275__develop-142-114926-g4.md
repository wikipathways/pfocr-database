caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of hair cell regeneration. Supporting cells can classically
  regenerate hair cells via two mechanisms: mitotic hair cell regeneration and direct
  transdifferentiation. Enhancing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway or inhibiting
  cell cycle inhibitors such as p27Kip1 may constitute approaches to enhance mitotic
  regeneration. By contrast, Notch inhibition and Atoh1 overexpression may promote
  the direct conversion of supporting cells into hair cells.'
