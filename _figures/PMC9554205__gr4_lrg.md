caption: Brief graphical summary of the literature. SARS-CoV-2 and OP co-exposure
  disrupts RAS which is characterized by down-regulation of ACE-2, up-regulation of
  ANG II, and hyperactive ANG/AT1R signaling pathway. Redox homeostasis is altered
  by down-regulation of Nrf mediated antioxidant signaling, induction of NOX assembly,
  and excessive production of ROS. Proinflammatory cytokine levels are amplified by
  viral and chemical exposure via induction of NF-kB mediated signaling cascade. All
  these alterations at sub-cellular moiety lead to cardiovascular issues.
