caption: The potency of nutraceuticals and functional foods for preventing viral infections.
  Pre-intervention as supplements or in combinations with nutraceuticals and nutrient
  supplements modulate immune responses and prevent viral infections or ameliorate
  disease severity by acting at different stages of a virus invasion pathway (Nsp15,
  SARS-CoV-2 endoribonuclease; 6vsb, 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein; 6lu7, SARS-CoV-2
  main protease, ACE2, receptor for SARS-CoV-2; EGCG, Epigallocatechin gallate).
