caption: 'Metabolic model of Desulfosporosinus sp. MAG SbF1. Gene expression stimulated
  by specific substrates in combination with sulfate is indicated by colored points.
  Paralogous genes are indicated by an underscore followed by a number. Plus signs
  indicates proposed protein complexes. Details for all genes are given in a, and
  transcription patterns are shown in . For the citric acid cycle and anaplerotic
  reactions, carriers of reducing equivalents and further by-products are not shown.
  The following abbreviations were used: X, unknown reducing equivalent carrier, e.g.,
  NAD+ or ferredoxin; WL, Wood-Ljungdahl pathway consisting of enzymes encoded by
  the acs operon, MetF, FolD, FchA, and Fhs; TCA, citric acid cycle; FDH, formate
  dehydrogenase; Hase, hydrogenase; NDH-1, NADH dehydrogenase 1; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.'
