caption: (A) Genetic ablation of the Hfe protein (Hfe−/−) leads to diminished hepcidin
  production and elevated iron uptake and distribution. Transgenic overexpression
  of hepcidin (B) greatly diminishes tissue iron loading and leads to a microcytic,
  hypochromic anemia. Application of supraphysiological amounts of BMP6 (C) initiates
  hepcidin production through stimulation of the Bmp/Hjv/Smad signaling pathway, leading
  to diminished available iron.
