caption: Summary. Figure depicts a workflow of the methods used throughout this study.
  The relationship between Integrin β3, Filamin A, Talin-1 and Vinculin in the focal
  adhesion pathway is depicted within the figure. The desired pre/post treatment assay
  is depicted by the 12-well plate at the end of the work flow, where green depicts
  most sensitive and pink depicts least sensitive samples.
