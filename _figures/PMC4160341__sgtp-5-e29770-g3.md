caption: Figure 3. Spatial regulation of the signaling pathways mediated by Rho GTPases
  during the ingression phase of cytokinesis. Upon anaphase onset, the site of the
  division plane is established. This involves in-part the interaction between the
  centralspindlin complex and Ect-2, which is facilitated by phosphorylation, and
  occurs at the central spindle and/or midzone. RhoA is subsequently recruited to
  the equator of the cell cortex where its activation is tightly regulated. Its activity
  is confined to a narrow zone (defining the division plane) by several Rho GEFs (GEF-H1,
  Myo-GEF) and GAPs (p190RhoGAP, MP-GAP). At the same time, cell cortex localized
  Rac1 is maintained in an inactive state by MgcRacGAP to inhibit the formation of
  Arp2/3-mediated branched actin filaments. However, this pathway may be active at
  the polar regions to allow for cell elongation. At the equatorial cell cortex, RhoA
  activates the effectors, mDia1 for linear actin filament polymerization, as well
  as the kinases, MLCK, ROCK, and citron kinase, to activate myosin II. The outcome
  is assembly and activation of the actin-myosin II contractile ring to mediate membrane
  ingression. Anillin and septin proteins maintain all furrow components within this
  narrow zone for efficient and complete membrane ingression.
