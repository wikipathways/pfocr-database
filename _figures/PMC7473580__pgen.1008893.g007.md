caption: 'Left: S. pombe trm8Δ mutants (red) trigger RTD of tY(GUA), leading to GAAC
  induction and further loss of tY(GUA) and tP(AGG). The further reduced levels of
  tRNA resulting from GAAC induction is in part due to transcription upregulation
  of Fil1 target genes (solid lines), and may also be due in part to the global reduction
  in translation (dotted lines). Right: S. cerevisiae trm8Δ trm4Δ mutants (green)
  trigger RTD of tV(AAC), leading to GAAC induction. This results in inhibition of
  further loss of tV(AAC), which is due in part to the the transcription upregulation
  of Gcn4 target genes (solid lines), and may also be due to global reduction in translation
  (dotted lines).'
