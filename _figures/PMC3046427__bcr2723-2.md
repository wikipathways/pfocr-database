caption: β-Catenin is at the hub of multiple signaling pathways. Many signaling pathways
  regulate the stability or binding interactions of β-catenin. In the Wnt pathway,
  glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and casein kinase 1 (CK1) phosphorylate the
  N-terminal degron sequence of β-catenin to facilitate its destruction. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) pathways also impinge upon β-catenin
  phosphorylation by regulating GSK3β activity. In addition, p53 induces the degradation
  of β-catenin through protein interactions involving Seven in absentia homolog 1
  (Siah1), Siah interacting protein (SIP) and EBV-induced G-protein coupled receptor
  (Ebi), resulting in ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin. Pin1 binds to β-catenin
  phosphorylated on S246P to prevent its association with adenomatous polyposis coli
  (APC). In the NF-κB pathway, IκB kinase (IKK)α and IKKβ phosphorylate β-catenin
  throughout the protein to activate and inhibit transcription, respectively, although
  the N-terminus is essential for IKKα regulation. Some proteins, such as those within
  the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) pathway and Sox17, regulate β-catenin
  in the nucleus by modulating its interaction with transcriptional co-activators
  Tcf/Lef. Other proteins, like enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), interact with
  β-catenin to promote its translocation into the nucleus. A number of tyrosine kinases
  phosphorylate (both membrane bound and cytosolic) β-catenin to prevent its binding
  to the cadherin complex at the cell membrane. Src, epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR), and erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene-2 (ErbB2) have been shown or
  implicated to phosphorylate β-catenin on Y654, while Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl)
  phosphorylates Y489. β-TrCP, beta-transducing repeat-containing protein; DKK, Dickkopf;
