caption: Quality control of protein import. The mitochondrial protein translocation-associated
  degradation (mitoTAD) pathway removes precursor proteins from the TOM complex that
  arrest in the translocon during transport. Ubx2 recruits the AAA-ATPase Cdc48 for
  extraction of stalled precursor proteins from the TOM channel for proteasomal turnover.
  In the mitochondrial compromised protein import response (mitoCPR) the expression
  of the CIS1 gene is induced upon mitochondrial import stress. Cis1 links the membrane
  bound AAA-ATPase Msp1 to Tom70 to facilitate the extraction and subsequent proteasomal
  turnover of stalled precursor proteins.
