caption: Biosynthesis of EXTs (A) and AGPs (B) and the possible role of a fasciclin-like
  AGP (SOS5/FLA4) as an extracellular biosensor (C). (A) Sites of action of known
  glycosyltransferases acting on EXTs are depicted within a representative EXT glycomodule
  sequence found in an EXT molecule. (B) Sites of action of known glycosyltransferases
  acting on AGPs are depicted within a representative AGP glycomodule sequence found
  within an AGP molecule. (C) Proposed model that links AGP-Hyp GALTs, GALT2 and GALT5
  with SOS5 (FLA4) and FEI1/FEI2 in regulating cellular signaling of root growth.
  Signaling of normal root growth likely involves GALT2/GALT5-dependent glycosylation
  of SOS5 and glycosylated SOS5 binding FEI1/FEI2, which in turn triggers binding
  of FEI1/FEI2 to ACC synthase, specifically ACS5, to form a scaffold complex. The
  ACC synthase in the scaffold is thought to lead to the localized production of ACC,
  a potential signaling molecule of cell wall integrity. In contrast, when GALT2/GALT5-dependent
  SOS5 glycosylation is inhibited or when SOS5 or FEI1/FEI2 is disrupted, ACC synthase
  (ACS5) is not bound to FEI1/FEI2 and thus is not part of the scaffold. Consequently,
  the unbound ACC synthase produces non-localized ACC, which is converted to ethylene,
  and serves to inhibit cellulose synthase/cellulose biosynthesis. Such weaker or
  compromised cell walls lead to root tip swelling in response to elevated NaCl or
  sucrose treatment. It is also likely that GALT3, GALT4, and GALT6 as well as HPGT1,
  HPGT2, and HPGT3 play redundant or partially redundant roles to GALT2 and GALT5
  in this pathway.
