caption: The figure shows the interactions between Rosiglitazone and PCOS subnetwork
  No.3. The ellipses indicate PCOS-related proteins, the octagons show the drugs,
  and the Squares depict the pathways. The figure highlights the shared proteins in
  blue and the shared pathways in violet. The pathway protein interactions are shown
  by six color edges (including 1-red for Pyruvate metabolism, 2-yellow for Biosynthesis
  of amino acids, 3-violet for TCA cycle, 4-blue for carbon metabolism, 5-pink for
  metabolic pathways, and 6-orange for Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism). The
  yellow nodes and black edges indicate interactions among PCOS-related proteins in
  subnetwork No.3 that are not shared with the drugs-related proteins
