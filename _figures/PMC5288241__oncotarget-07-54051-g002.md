caption: Liganded AR binds in the vicinity of the IRE1α, RAMP4 and EDEM1 genes to
  increase their expression, thus activating the IRE1α pathway but at the same time
  inhibits pro-apoptotic JNK signaling which is also activated by IRE1α. In contrast,
  androgens inhibit PERK and eIF2α activity. However, contrary to expectations (see
  text), ATF4 and CHOP expression are modestly increased in response to androgen;
  thus, the exact role of the PERK pathway and its regulation by androgens in prostate
  cancer requires further investigation. It is currently unknown whether the ATF6
  pathway is regulated by androgen signaling in prostate cancer cells. Arrows with
  solid lines indicate a direct established effect whereas those with dashed lines
  indicate indirect or currently unexplored interactions.
