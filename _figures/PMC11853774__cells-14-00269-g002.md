caption: 'Role of Hedgehog (Hh) and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in the regulation of the
  autophagic process in hematological diseases. Red lines indicate that inhibition
  of the Hedgehog or PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, via their respective inhibitors, activates
  the autophagic process. Green lines highlight the interaction between these pathways
  when active, demonstrating how they regulate each other to suppress autophagy. Autophagy
  plays a dual role in leukemic cells: it can enhance survival under stress, promoting
  chemoresistance through its cytoprotective effects, or drive cell death, contributing
  to tumor suppression'
