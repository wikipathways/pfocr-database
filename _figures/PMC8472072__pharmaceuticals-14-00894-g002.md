caption: 'In recent years, two new molecular targets of antidepressants have been
  discovered. Many antidepressants functionally inhibit ASM, causing a reduction in
  ceramide in the cell membrane as a forward effect and a slow increase in sphingomyelin
  as a backward effect. Sphingomyelin increases autophagy via intermediate steps.
  Because ceramide in the cell membrane displaces cholesterol, antidepressants increase
  cholesterol by lowering ceramide levels. Cholesterol enhances TRKB dimerization
  and, thus, antidepressant binding. The BDNF-TRKB pathway induces autophagy, and
  so both signaling pathways converge here. A reduction in autophagy is observed in
  many of the phenomena associated with MDD, and increasing the rate of autophagy
  is likely to be useful in treating patients with MDD. Abbreviations: ASM, acid sphingomyelinase;
  BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; TRKB, tyrosine kinase receptor 2.'
