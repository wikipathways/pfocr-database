  IPAD (green line and arrows). Aβ in the ISF enters the basement membranes of endothelial
  cells in the walls of capillaries. Contractile pericytes surround capillaries and
  may supply the motive force for IPAD in capillaries. Aβ then rapidly passes into
  basement membranes (100 to 150 nm thick) surrounding smooth muscle cells (SMC)s
  in the tunica media of cerebral arteries. Changes occur in the walls of arteries
  as they age and IPAD is impaired resulting in the deposition of fibrillar Aβ in
  the IPAD pathways as CAA (green asterisks). As more Aβ is deposited and the severity
  of CAA increases, the wall of the artery is disrupted, SMCs are replaced by Aβ and
  IPAD is further impaired. The yellow line passing along the IPAD pathway shows how
  CSF that has entered the ISF of the brain also drains from the brain along IPAD
  pathways in artery walls. SMCs in the tunica media of arteries supply the motive
  force for IPAD and have both adrenergic and cholinergic innervations. C, Entry of
  CSF into the brain along periarterial pial–glial basement membranes. As arteries
  enter the surface of the cerebral cortex they are coated by a layer of pia mater
  that is firmly associated with the basement membranes of the glia limitans on the
  surface of the brain. There are no perivascular spaces around cortical arterioles
  so tracers injected into the CSF enter the brain along the periarterial pial–glial
  basement membranes and mix with the ISF in the brain parenchyma. CSF tracers are
  then eliminated from the brain along IPAD pathways. This route could be used to
  deliver drugs to increase the efficiency of elimination of Aβ along aging IPAD pathways.

  description: 'A, Intramural peri‐arterial drainage (IPAD) pathways for the lymphatic
    drainage of interstitial fluid (ISF) and soluble amyloid beta (Aβ) from the brain.
    Right side of diagram: ISF and Aβ (green line and arrows) pass from the extracellular
