caption: Distribution of storage compounds and WE biosynthetic pathways in the three
  domains of life. (A) Storage compounds described so far in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
  The production of WE by archaea is described in this study. (B) Biosynthetic pathways
  to WE production. A long-chain fatty acid is activated to fatty acyl-coenzyme A
  (acyl-CoA) by a fatty acyl-CoA ligase (FadD). Part of the fatty acyl-CoA is reduced
  to the corresponding fatty alcohol by different types of fatty acyl-CoA reductases.
  FcrA is the fatty acyl-CoA reductase characterized in this study. WE synthesis is
  then catalyzed by the WE synthase WS/DGAT, which uses a fatty acyl-CoA as the activated
  substrate and a fatty alcohol as the acceptor molecule
