caption: Generation of a biological network of genes of the most significant Canonical
  Pathways for the Il10-/- (EF·CIF vs. C) comparison. The network was generated by
  IPA using all molecules from significantly affected Canonical Pathways (Oxidative
  Phosphorylation; Antigen Presentation Pathway; IL-10 Signaling; Interferon Signaling;
  LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function; Circadian Rhythm Signaling). Connections
  were applied based on known interactions between these genes within the Ingenuity
  Pathways Knowledge Base. Central genes and their direct interactions were identified
  and were supported by published information. *Genes that are detected 2 or more
  times on the array. Genes or gene products are represented as nodes, and the biological
  relationship between two nodes is represented as a line (i.e. an edge). All edges
  are supported by at least 1 reference from the literature. Red and green coloured
  nodes indicate genes with up- and down-regulated expression, respectively. The intensity
  of the colours specifies the degree of up- or down-regulation. Greater intensity
  represents a higher level of differential expression. Nodes and edges are displayed
  with various shapes and labels that present the functional class of genes and the
  nature of the relationships between the nodes, as shown in the legend to Figure
  3.
