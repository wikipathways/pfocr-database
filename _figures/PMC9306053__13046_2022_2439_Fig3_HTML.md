caption: Targeting multiple metabolic pathways of mitochondria can enhance the anti-tumor
  effect of CD8+ T cells. (The red arrows indicate promotion, and the green arrows
  indicate inhibition) ①Activating CD28, increasing enolase 1 activity, or adding
  exogenous pyruvate and PEP can promote the glycolysis of CD8+ T cells. ②Inhibiting
  LDH activity and supplementing exogenous L-arginine can promote OXPHOS of CD8+ T
  cells. ③For melanoma, fibrosarcoma, colon cancer and lung cancer, a combination
  of bezafibrate with PD-1 blockade can promote FAO and function of CD8+ T cells,
  while inhibiting FAO can improve the anti-tumor effect of CD8+ T cells in breast
  cancer. ④Up-regulating the expression level of transcriptional activity of PGC1-α
  in CD8+ T cells can facilitate mitochondrial biogenesis and functional recovery.
  It can be achieved by stimulating 4-1BB combined with PD-1 blockade, inhibiting
  the activity of Akt, inhibiting the mTORC2 pathway to activate Foxo1, and using
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to activate SIRT1. ⑤Regulating mitochondrial fusion
  and fission by essential GTPase (Drp1, Mfn1, Mfn2 and Opa1) can control CD8+ T cell
  function. ⑥MAPK/ERK can prevent the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to
  cytoplasm and the activation of caspase cascade, decreasing CD8+ T cell apoptosis.
  ⑦Addition of BH4 can regulate mitochondrial iron transport and respiration in CD8+
  T cells, increasing the activation of CD8+ T cells
