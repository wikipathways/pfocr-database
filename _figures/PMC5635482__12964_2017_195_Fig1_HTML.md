caption: 'A model for the DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair: Crosstalk between
  the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway, translesion synthesis (TLS) and homologous recombination
  (HR). a Certain endogenous, environmental sources and chemotherapeutic agents inflict
  damage to the DNA forming adducts between each DNA strands creating inter-strand
  crosslinks. b Two replication forks converge at the DNA ICL covalently linking the
  Watson and Crick strands of the DNA. The replication machinery encounters the DNA
  lesion at the fork leading to fork stalling. c The FA core complex detects the stalled
  replication fork, assembles on the DNA lesion and initiates checkpoint response
  by activating ATR, which in turn phosphorylates multiple FA proteins. This triggers
  the ubiquitin ligase activity of FANCL resulting in monoubiquitination of FANCD2
  and FANCI. d The FANCD2-FANCI heterodimeric complex is recruited to the ICL site.
  This further recruits downstream nucleases, in particular structure specific endonucleases
  like SLX4 (FANCP), ERCC1-XPF, FAN1 and MUS81-EME1 to coordinate nucleolytic incisions
  flanking the ICL. The incisions unhook the ICL leaving crosslinked nucleotides tethered
  to the complementary strand. FAAP20 interacts with the FA core complex and binds
  to monoubiquitinated REV1. This catalyze TLS-dependent lesion bypass across the
  adduct, mediated by specialized TLS polymerases such as REV1 and Polζ. This restores
  the integrity of the template strand required for the progression of the nascent
  leading strand. e DSB generated after nucleolytic incisions serves as a suitable
  substrate for repair by the HR pathway. Downstream FA proteins promote RAD51-dependent
  strand invasion forming the synaptic filament. Branch migration and intermediates
  containing Holliday junctions are formed. f The resulting double Holliday junction
  is resolved by HR specific nucleases, HR repair is completed and the integrity of
  the DNA is restored'
