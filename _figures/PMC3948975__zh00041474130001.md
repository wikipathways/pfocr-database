caption: 'Multiple modes of Ca2+ entry occur in mammary epithelial cells. Left: store-operated
  mechanisms are triggered by aggregation of STIM proteins that sense luminal Ca2+
  in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. Direct interaction with plasma membrane Orai1
  channels elicits Ca2+ entry, localized increase in Ca2+cyt, and refilling of stores
  by the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump. SOCE, store-operated
  Ca2+ entry. Right: store-independent mechanisms include a direct interaction between
  the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase-2 (SPCA2) pump located in Golgi-derived vesicles
  (GDV) and Orai1 channels resulting in Ca2+ influx and potential refilling of Golgi
  stores by fusion of Ca2+-loaded vesicles. Red arrows indicate ATP utilization by
  the SERCA and SPCA2 pumps; dotted lines show movement of STIM or SPCA2, required
  for Ca2+ entry mechanisms. SICE, store-independent Ca2+ entry.'
