  Modulating the MAPK signaling pathway of LQZ against AD. EGF, IL-1,
  and TNF initiate a series of kinase activations through their respective
  cell surface receptors in the MAPK pathway: EGFR (RTK), IL-1R, and
  TNFR. These activations lead to the activation of p-MAPK3/1 (p-ERK1/2)
  and p-MAPK14 (p38), which, in turn, activate p65. This regulates the
  release of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α,
  influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation,
  apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and cytokine production. The therapeutic
  effect of LQZ-H on AD potentially involves reducing the expressions
  of EGFR, p-MAPK1/3, p-MAPK14, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α,
  thus inhibiting the MAPK pathway
