caption: (A) Schematic of evolution of the eukaryotes and their shikimate pathway
  genes using the bikont/unikont eukaryote root (, , ). Shikimate pathway genes are
  colored and are in the gene fusion order as indicated in panel B. Mitochondria and
  nuclear organelles are marked M and N, respectively. Apicoplastid organelles are
  illustrated as a red capsule, plastids are colored green, and plastids of secondary
  endosymbiotic origin are colored green with a red border. Secondary endosymbiotic
  events, hypothetical loss events, and horizontal gene transfers are labeled and
  are given an arrow to infer the direction and target of the gene transfer. Note
  that the shikimate pathway genes are localized in the cell only to reflect the likely
  associated origin, i.e., not to demonstrate genome localization or functional localization.
  For example, the arom pathway probably arose at a similar time as the eukaryotic
  cytoplasm, so it is drawn in the cytoplasm; the Plantae shikimate pathway is likely
  to have arisen at a similar time to the plastid endosymbiosis, so it is drawn associated
  with the plastid, although in several cases origin is not directly from the plastid
  progenitor genome. (B) Key for the color coding of the shikimate pathway genes and
  illustration of the alternative naming for each gene/enzyme. A brief outline of
  the metabolic pathway is given.
