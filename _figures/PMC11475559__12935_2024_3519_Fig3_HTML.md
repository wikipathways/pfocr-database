caption: RhoA is overexpressed in cancer and promotes cancer progression via RhoA/ROCK2
  signaling pathway. RhoA and its downstream effectors Rock2, myosin II, LIMK, and
  cofilin play critical roles during G1-S phase progression by regulating the expression
  of cell cycle proteins p21 and cyclin D1. RhoA regulated by Rho GEFs and GAPs can
  recruit effectors to form a contraction ring during cell cytokinesis, and the loss
  of contractile forces can cause asymmetric division. RhoA-mediated actin assembly,
  protrusion at the front of the cell, and contraction at the body of the cell enhance
  motility and promote cancer cell invasion and migration. In addtion, RhoA plays
  an important role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the formation of vasculogenic
  mimicry network. These processes drive cancer stem cells to tumor progression

  cancer progression and shows promising therapeutic potential
