caption: Schematic diagram of pathogen-derived molecules enabling VP22 to evade the
  DNA-sensing pathway in cells. (1) cGAS is activated after it binds to dsDNA and
  uses ATP and GTP to generate cGAMP through enzymatic activity. cGAS is responsible
  for activation of the binding protein STING. Phosphorylated STING begins to recruit
  TBK1 to activate IRF3, and phosphorylated IRF3 enters the nucleus to activate the
  interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), thereby producing type I interferon
  to fight pathogens. HSV-1 VP22 binds to and inhibits the enzymatic activity of cGAS,
  thereby enabling evasion of the host’s innate immune response. (2) AIM2 is a pattern
  recognition receptor that can recognize dsDNA in the cytoplasm and bind to the linker
  protein ASC and pro-caspase-1 to form the AIM2 inflammasome (AIM2-ASC-Pro-caspase-1),
  which activates caspase-1; activated caspase-1 can cleave pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18,
  which leads to the maturation and secretion of the inflammatory factors IL-1β and
  IL-18. HSV-1 VP22 can interact with AIM2 and prevent its oligomerization, thereby
  inhibiting the activation of AIM2-dependent inflammatory bodies.
