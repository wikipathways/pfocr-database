caption: B, The square indicates the decision node, the point at which a treatment
  strategy is chosen; the letter M indicates the Markov node, with branches indicating
  the health states in transition within every 6 months; the green circles indicate
  the chance node, after which there is a probability of the occurrence of each event;
  and the orange triangle indicates the terminal node, the end of a pathway within
  a 6-month cycle.
