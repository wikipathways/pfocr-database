caption: a, Normal CD34+ stem and progenitor cells preferentially express a short
  isoform of IRAK4 (IRAK4-S), which promotes stronger activation of MAPK signalling
  than the NF-κB pathway. b, Mutations in U2AF1 lead to predominant expression of
  a long isoform of IRAK4 (IRAK4-L). The N-terminal domain retained in IRAK4-L interacts
  with the death domain of MYD88, facilitating the assembly of the myddosome complex,
  which mediates IRAK4 autotransphosphorylation and NF-κB maximal activation. Treatment
  with IRAK4 inhibitors decreases NF-κB signalling and promotes the differentiation
  of AML cells in vitro, significantly reducing the tumour burden in in vivo experiments.
  Ex, exon.
