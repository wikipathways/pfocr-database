caption: Lipid Pathway. Galactosylceramidase (GALC) can hydrolyze the amide bonds
  of galactosylceramide (GalCer), dihexosylceramide (DiHexCer), and galactosylsphingosine
  (GalSph, psychosine). In GLD, GALC is absent and psychosine has been found to be
  the principle substrate that accumulates. In the current study, GalCer, DiHexCer,
  and glucosylceramide (GluCer) were also observed to be dysregulated in cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) in the canine model of GLD.
