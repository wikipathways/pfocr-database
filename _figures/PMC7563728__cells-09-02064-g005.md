caption: 'Proposed model of EMT-mediated catabolic metabolism in breast cancer subtypes.
  Proposed divergent metabolic models of PPP-dependent luminal subtype (left) and
  a FAO-dependent basal-like subtype (right) of breast cancer indicate Snail involvement
  in catabolic metabolism and cancer cell survival. Abbreviations: PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; ACC2, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2; CPT1, carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase I; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; F6P,
  fructose 6-phosphate; TIGAR, TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator; PFK-1
  phosphofructokinase-1; FBP1, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase 1; F1,6BP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate.'
