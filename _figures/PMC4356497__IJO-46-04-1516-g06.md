caption: Metabolome data map of the glycolysis metabolic pathway and PPP, in HCT116
  cells and in conditioned medium (medium data). Each bar represents the relative
  amount of a metabolite for non-treatment (black), treatment with FF/CAP18 at 10
  μg/ml (deep grey) or 40 μg/ml (light grey) and control medium (white). All metabolite
  data are shown as the mean of triplicate samples ± standard deviation. The P-values
  were evaluated using Student’s t-test. The asterisks indicate the statistical significance.
  *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001.
