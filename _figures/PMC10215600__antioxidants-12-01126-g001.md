caption: Nrf2 and SIRT1 signaling pathways regulation by antioxidants. (A) At optimal
  conditions, Nrf2 forms a KEAP1-ubiquitin complex, which downregulates Nrf2 via proteasomal
  degradation. Nrf2 activity is also inhibited by PTEN. This phosphatase decreases
  3-phosphoinositides (PIP3) by conversion into PIP2, and the downstream Akt-GSK3β
  are not activated. The small amount of Nrf2 cannot be phosphorylated and translocated
  into the nucleus. Another mechanism of antioxidants involves SIRT1/FOXOa3 and the
  PGC1α pathway by expression of the antioxidant defense genes and mitochondrial biogenesis.
  (B) With physiological doses of antioxidants, KEAP1 is oxidized and the Nrf2 complex
  is destroyed, which results in an increased amount of Nrf2. PTEN is also suppressed
  and, thus, activates the previously described pathway with the following translocation
  of Nrf2 into the nucleus. Phosphorylated Nrf2 binds to the electrophile response
  element (EpRE) that starts the expression of the phase II antioxidant enzymes. Metabolic
  stress activates the Nrf2 pathway in the same manner. Moderate physical exercise
  stimulates both Nrf2 and SIRT1 signaling. Melatonin exerts its antioxidant effects
  through receptor-mediated transcriptional activity and after diffusion in the cytosol
  via several different pathways
