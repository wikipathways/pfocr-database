caption: A nuclear SIRT1 mechanism for delaying NAD-ATP depletion through inhibition
  of PARP-1 is presented. The NAD salvage pathway uses nicotinamide (NAM) as a substrate.
  NAMPT1 converts nicotinamide (NAM) to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) which via
  nicotinamide adenylyl-transferase (NMNAT) gets converted to NAD. Both of these processes
  require ATP. Reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (R(O/N)S) causing DNA damage causes
  activation of PARP-1, which leads to NAD depletion as NAD is used as a substrate
  in the polymerization reaction. The salvage pathway is simultaneously activated
  by (R(O/N)S), which leads to a futile NAD-recycling process that ultimately depletes
  ATP. Similar lesser characterized ATP depleting pathways are predicted specifically
  in axonal cytosol and mitochondria where NMNAT2 and NMNAT3 enzymes have been colocalized
  respectively with Sirtuin and PARP family members. R(O/N)S cause damage to DNA,
  which activates PARP-1 leading to NAD depletion through use of NAD as a substrate
  to generate poly(ADP)ribose, PAR (1). Nicotinamide (NAM) is used by nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) to make nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). This
  is then converted to NAD via nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1),
  part of the genomic triplication responsible for the slow Wallerian degeneration
  mouse (Wlds) phenotype. The NAD salvage pathway repeatedly uses ATP to replenish
  NAD (2). The NAD-dependent mitochondrial deacetylase, SIRT3, functions as a master
  regulator of ATP levels. Under ischemic conditions NAD is required to maintain production
  of ATP from anaerobic glycolysis. The increased salvage pathway efficiency of the
  Wlds mouse is probably able to provide NAD to maintain ATP generation by anaerobic
  glycolysis during oxidative stress (3). Otherwise ATP can be supplied via oxidative
  phosphorylation (4). The futile cycle continues until PAR formation triggers AIF-dependent
  apoptosis or ATP stores are so depleted that necrosis happens (5). PARP-1 activity
  can be inhibited directly (e.g. minocycline and PJ-34 are nanomolar affinity inhibitors)
  or indirectly through activation of SIRT-1 (e.g. resveratrol; 6). Either PARP-1
  inhibitory approach can significantly delay NAD and ATP depletion similar to the
  Wlds mouse. Alternatively pharmacological administration of NAD or precursors can
  help prevent deficiencies. All of the pharmacological approaches described here
  have been shown to ameliorate EAE pathogenesis in published reports. Neurons are
  particularly susceptible to depletion of NAD owing to their apparent lack of a fully
  functional salvage pathway (see text).
