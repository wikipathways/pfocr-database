caption: 'The involvement of PI3K and NF-κB pathways in the apoptosis delay in A.
  phagocytophilum-infected neutrophils. A. phagocytophilum bacteria are recognized
  by neutrophils: among other receptors, PSGL-1 possibly plays a role in activating
  downstream signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Activation of PI3K results in the
  stabilization of Mcl-1, which in turn leads to apoptosis inhibition. The NF-κB pathway
  is activated in a PI3K-dependent manner. Activation of NF-κB leads to the release
  of IL-8, which in an autocrine manner leads to the delay by activating the PI3K
  and NF-κB pathways.'
