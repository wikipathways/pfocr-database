caption: The main observations made in Green et al. (). The numbers are information
  according to literature, and the letters are the results based on our data. BMI
  = body mass index; FAA = food anticipatory activity; IGF-1 = insulin-like growth
  factor-1; TCA cycle = tricarboxylic acid cycle; TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor-α.
  (1) Calorie restriction remains the most robust intervention to extend life span
  and improve healthspan. (2) The cerebellum is most commonly associated with motor
  control and cognitive and sensory functions, although it has strong links with the
  hypothalamus and is more recently thought to play a role in nutritional regulation
  and adiposity. (3) Cerebellum plays a role in feeding behavior, and through the
  circadian clock, rhythms have been shown to be centrally involved in the coordination
  of food anticipatory activity. (4) Cerebellar metabolism is increased by stomach
  expansion through the vagus nerve. (5) The hypothalamus controls energy balance
  through, among other signals, adipokines (adiponectin, interleukin-6, and TNF-α,
  leptin) and insulin, which generally circulate in the blood proportionally to body
  fat content; however, insulin also spikes after meals. (A) Mice under restriction
  show high levels of FAA for 2 h prefeeding, and this behavior was inversely correlated
  with factors that regulate energy balance such as leptin, insulin, TNF-α, and IGF-1.
  (B) Data in Green et al. suggest an essential role for the cerebellum in physiological
  and behavioral responses to food intake. The relationship that exists between the
  cerebellum and nutritional regulation may be in part due to strong direct connections
  with the hypothalamus, which is a major area of the brain associated with hunger
  signaling. (C) Pathway enrichment indicated changes in the pathways of adenosine
  and guanine, which are precursors of DNA production, in addition to changes in pathways
  of metabolism of in aromatic amino acids, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan,
  and the sulfur-containing amino acid methionine. (D) They also detected increases
  in the TCA cycle, electron donor, and dopamine and histamine pathways. (E) In particular,
  changes in l-histidine and homocarnosine correlated positively with the level of
  caloric restriction and food anticipatory activity and negatively with insulin and
  body temperature. (F) Several metabolic and pathway changes acted against changes
  seen in age-associated neurodegenerative disorders, including increases in the TCA
  cycle and reduced l-proline. (G) Carnitine metabolites contributed to discrimination
  between CR groups.
