caption: Specification of GABAergic Cortical Interneurons. With regard to the specification
  of MGE-derived interneuronal progenitors, several transcription factors play a role.
  Shh signaling activates Nk×2.1, which is the key transcription factor in specifying
  PV- and SST-positive interneurons from this region. Lh×6 and Lh×8 are transcription
  factors that lie downstream of Nk×2.1; they also aid in the specification of PV
  and SST interneurons (see text). Sox6 lies downstream of both Nkx2.1 and Lhx6/8.
  The Dlx homeobox family of genes play a key role in specification of CGE-derived
  cortical interneurons, although they also function to maintain the PV-expressing
  subset of MGE-derived interneurons (Dlx5 in particular). Arx is a homeobox transcription
  factor whose expression is directly affected by Dlx genes; Arx seems to play a role
  in the migration of interneurons to the cortex. Gsx1 and Gsx2 are both required
  for the specification of cortical interneurons that originate in the CGE. Mash1
  is a downstream transcription factor whose absence results in reduced cortical interneuron
  numbers; it is required for proper function of the Notch ligand Delta1, which, in
  the Notch signaling pathway, serves to repress neuronal differentiation. The Dlx
  genes lie further downstream and play a crucial role in CGE-derived interneuron
  specification. The molecular mechanisms behind POA interneuron specification are
  unclear, although Nk×2.1 is expressed by interneurons derived from this area. Lh×6
  is not expressed by these interneurons. Nk×5.1 was shown to affect the specification
  of NPY and Reelin interneurons.
