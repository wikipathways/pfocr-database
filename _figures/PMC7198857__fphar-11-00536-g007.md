caption: The signaling pathway network by which PF resists H2O2-induced oxidative
  stress in melanocytes. PF may depended on the JNK/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway to reduce oxidative
  damage which was reflected in suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation
  and enhancing the productions of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and antioxidant enzymes
  catalase (CAT), therefore, PF inhibited cell apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation.,
  Moreover, PF promoted dendrite extension probably by inhibiting the actin polymerization
  in stressed cells. In addition, JNK increased the Nrf2 expression in PF-pretreated
  PIG1, but inhibited the expression of Nrf2 in PF-pretreated PIG3V under oxidative
  stress. Pathway Builder Tool 2.0 was used to draw this picture.
