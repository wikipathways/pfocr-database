caption: 'Potential biochemical pathways deregulated as a consequence of FH inactivation.Notes:
  FH-deficient kidney cancer has impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and undergoes
  a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis to generate adenosine triphosphate for cellular
  energy demands. Fumarate, which accumulates in FH-deficient cells, can competitively
  inhibit prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), resulting in HIF-1α stabilization and increased
  expression of the HIF-1α target genes VEGF and GLUT1. Elevated fumarate also succinates
  KEAP1, altering its conformation and inhibiting its ability to degrade nuclear factor
  erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 transcriptional activity is upregulated,
  leading to activation of the antioxidant-response pathway and protection against
  oxidative stress. Adapted from Linehan and Rouault.Abbreviations: LDHA, lactate
  dehydrogenase A; CoA, coenzyme A; αKG, α-ketoglutarate; FH, fumarate hydratase;
