caption: a. FAT4 knockdown upregulated the expression of E2F5 suggesting a link between
  the two genes. b. A suggested mechanism of EMT and cell cycle regulation by FAT4
  based on Western blot obtained data. Inhibition of FAT4 regulates the expression
  of EMT markers and promotes cell cycle progression via the suggested pathway. The
  solid lines indicate the results obtained from the previous study [], while the
  dotted lines indicate results of our western blotting experiments
