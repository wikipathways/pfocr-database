caption: Glucose uptake in adipose tissue and its regulation by ghrelin. Insulin activates
  the IR, which phosphorylates and recruits different substrate adaptors such as the
  IRS family of proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylated IRS then displays binding sites
  for numerous signaling partners. Among them, PI3K has a major role in insulin function,
  mainly via the activation of the AKT/PKB and the PKCz cascades. Activated AKT induces
  glycogen synthesis, through inhibition of GSK-3. Insulin stimulates glucose uptake
  in muscle and adipocytes via translocation of GLUT-4 vesicles to the plasma membrane.
  GLUT-4 translocation involves the PI3K/AKT pathway. Ghrelin treatment induced increases
  IRS-1 and AKT phosphorylation, but when the adipocytes were treated with wortmannin,
  a PI3K inhibitor, completely blocked this ghrelin induced increase in glucose transport
  and phospho-AKT expression, suggesting that PI3K/AKT activation may mediate the
  effect of ghrelin on glucose transport in these adipocytes.
