caption: Autophagy induced via cGAS-STING and its signaling pathway. a Exogenously
  or endogenously damaged dsDNA stimulates cGAS to produce cGAMP. cGAMP binds to STING,
  and the cGAMP-STING complex recruits SAR1 and SEC24C to form the COP-ll complex.
  The COP-ll complex translocates from the ER to ERGIC. b The ERGIC serves as a membrane
  source for LC3 lipidation, which is dependent on WIPI2. LC3-positive membranes enclose
  dsDNA, bacteria or viruses and form autophagosomes. c The autophagosome transferred
  to the lysosome is digested by various enzymes
