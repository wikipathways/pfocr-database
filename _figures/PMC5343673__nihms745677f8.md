caption: Increased free radicals trigger DNA damage response and/or oxidative stress
  that may elicit p53-dependent apoptotic pathway. p53 mobilizes the pro-apoptotic
  protein Bax through the transcriptional activation of BH3 domain in proteins such
  as PUMA that may elevates Drp1 levels, ultimately leading to mitochondrial fragmentation.
  MicroRNAs, MiR30 and miR499 reduce mitochondrial fission activity by suppressing
  the expression of p53 and Drp1 and enhance neuronal survival.
