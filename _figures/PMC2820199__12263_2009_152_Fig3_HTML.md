caption: 'Network of proteins, functional classes and cell processes modulated in
  prostate cancer cells after curcumin treatment. All of these data were extracted
  from PubMed abstracts using the MedScan Reader software (version 1.1) [, ] and then
  imported to the Pathway Studio software tool (Version 5.0) [] for visualization.
  Nodes correspond to proteins (in red), functional classes (in orange). Lines represented
  the different types of interactions and relationships between the corresponding
  nodes and curcumin: expression (in black), regulation (in blue). Arrow line represented
  induction/activation, blunt-ended line represented repression/inactivation'
