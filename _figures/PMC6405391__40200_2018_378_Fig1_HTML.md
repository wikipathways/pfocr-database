caption: Energy imbalance leads to obesity. High calorie intake and sedentary life-style
  leads to net gain as fat mass and hyperlipidemia resulting in the induction of insulin
  resistance, which progresses to diabetes and impaired insulin secretion by pancreatic
  beta cells. In the process of insulin resistance elevated and inflammed adipose
  cells play an important role through secretion of cytokines, known to be contributing
  factors in impairing insulin signaling pathway and suppressing pancreatic insulin
  production/secretion. This results into the impaired uptake of glucose by the muscles
  and ultimately causing hyperglycemia

  diabetes and oxidative stress leading to NASH and atherosclerosis severity.
