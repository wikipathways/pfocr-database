caption: 'Thiamin biosynthesis in plants. Comprehensive schematic representation of
  thiamin biosynthesis in planta (adapted from ; ). Synthesis of pyrimidine and thiazole
  moieties as well as their condensation occurs in plastids. Biosynthesis pathway
  is shown in blue, enzymes in black. Transport across membranes is proposed to be
  carrier-mediated (barrels), of which the identified mitochondrial TPP carrier is
  indicated (red barrel; ). The chemical structure of thiamin is depicted, which can
  be pyrophosphorylated by the action of TPK on its free hydroxyl group. End-product
  feedback via sensing of TPP levels by the riboswitch residing on the 3′-UTR of THIC
  (pre-mRNA) in the nucleus is shown in red. Products: Gly, glycine; NAD+, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; Enzymes: THIC, HMP-P synthase; THI1, HET-P synthase; TH1,
  HMP-P kinase/TMP pyrophosphorylase; TPK; TH2, TMP phosphatase.'
