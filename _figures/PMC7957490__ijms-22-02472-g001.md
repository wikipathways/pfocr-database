caption: 'The crosstalk between MSCs and immune cells in the initial phase of tissue
  injury. Immediately upon tissue injury, resident MSCs become activated by microbial
  pathogens and/or by alarmins released from injured cells. Activated MSCs produce
  monocyte-attracting chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2, CCL12) which recruit circulating
  monocytes to the site of injury and inflammation. Tissue resident macrophages and
  recruited monocytes obtain pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype upon phagocytosis of
  microbial pathogens and apoptotic cells. M1 macrophages/monocytes produce CCL5,
  CCL2, CXCL12, IL-8 which activate JNK-dependent signaling pathway in resident MSCs,
  inducing their conversion in inflammatory (MSC1) cells. MSC1 secrete anti-viral
  cytokines (IFN-α and IFN-β) that up-regulate cytotoxicity of NK cells and enhance
  NK cell-dependent elimination of infected cells. Additionally, MSC1, in an IL-8-
  and MIF-dependent manner, enhance the phagocytic ability of neutrophils and macrophages,
  enabling the efficient removal of apoptotic cells, necrotic tissue and cellular
  debris. Abbreviations: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), C–C motif chemokine ligand
  (CCL), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXC), c-JunNH2-terminal kinase (JNK), macrophage
  migration inhibitory factor (MIF), natural killer (NK) cells, interleukin-8 (IL-8),
  interferon alpha (IFN-α), interferon beta (IFN-β).'
