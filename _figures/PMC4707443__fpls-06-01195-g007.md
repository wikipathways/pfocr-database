caption: 'Model for the regulation of long-term drought responses in Q. suber roots,
  where ABF-dependent signaling pathway components are up-regulated in roots exposed
  to long-term drought. (A) Functional network (functional features on Cytoscape),
  based on known Arabidopsis ABF-dependent signaling components (; ), cross-referenced
  against the complete DEG functional network. Edge thickness represents normalized
  link weights and edge color indicates physical interaction (magenta), predicted
  interaction (orange), shared protein domain (light green) and co-expression (purple).
  Node color represents expression in Log2 of fold change, while border color represents
  different classes of signaling components. (B) Schematic model of the proposed ABF-dependent
  signaling cascade: colors refer to different Arabidopsis signaling cascade components
  (gene name plus AGI code), while brackets highlight matching Quercus ID unigenes,
  found in the present analysis to be differentially expressed. Low water availability
  induces ABA production, which is recognized by the PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. PYR/PYL/RCAR’s
  structural conformation changes after binding to ABA, thus recruiting Protein Phosphatase
  2C (PP2C) phosphatases. PP2Cs are unavailable to dephosphorylate SnRK2 kinases.
  Phosphorylated (active) SnRK2s activate AREB/ABF transcription factors (TFs), which
  recognize ABRE cis-element motifs, mediating induction of stress-related gene expression
  (e.g., RD29b and NCED3). Other TF families are also likely to play a role in drought-signaling,
  including ANAC, AP2/EREB, MYB and WRKY TFs.'
