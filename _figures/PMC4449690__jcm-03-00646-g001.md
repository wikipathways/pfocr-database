caption: Synthesis of sphingolipids in mammalian cells. Two main pathways to produce
  sphingolipids exist in mammals. The de novo pathway of synthesis starts on the cytoplasmic
  face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The first step of this pathway is the condensation
  of l-serine with palmitoyl-CoA to form a 3-ketosphinganine. This reaction is catalyzed
  by serine palmitoyl-transferase (SPT). 3-Ketosphinganine is then reduced to form
  dihydrosphingosine (DH-Sph) by 3-ketopshinganine reductase. DH-Sph is a substrate
  of ceramide synthases (CerS) which produce dihydro-ceramide. Dihydroceramides are
  transformed into ceramides by dihydroceramide desaturase. Ceramide can be transported
  to the Golgi apparatus to be transformed into more complex sphingolipids such as
  sphingomyelin and glucosyl-ceramides. A second synthesis pathway is the catabolic
  pathway that leads to the degradation of sphingomyelin (SM) into ceramides by sphingomyelinases.
  This process takes place in the lysosomal and plasma membranes.
