caption: Schematic diagram of metabolic pathways in T cells. During T cell activation
  and rapid proliferation, glycolytic metabolism is enhanced by increases in glycolytic
  transporters such as GLUT-1. This increases glycolytically derived pyruvate conversion
  to acetyl-CoA, which is further converted to citrate within the TCA cycle. In the
  activated T cells, citrate is exported into the cytoplasm, where it is converted
  back to acetyl-CoA for use in the mevalonate pathway to synthesise cholesterol.
  To balance the export of citrate out of the TCA cycle, glutamine transporters are
  also upregulated. TCR, T-cell receptor; CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; MCT1, monocarboxylate
  transporter 1; GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; ASCT2, alanine-serine-cysteine transporter
  2; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate;
  TCA, Tricarboxylic acid cycle.
