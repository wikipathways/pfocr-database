caption: The DEGs and DAMs involved in the pathway of valine, leucine and isoleucine
  degradation in response to Cd stress and the addition of MT. BCAT, branched-chain
  amino acid aminotransferase; BCKDHA, 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase E1 component
  alpha subunit; DLD, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; DBT, 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase
  E2 component (dihydrolipoyl transacylase); IVD, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase; ECHA,
  enoyl-CoA hydratase; MCCC, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase alpha subunit; ACAT,
  acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase; HMGCS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HIBCH,
  3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase; HIBADH, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase; AGXT2,
  alanine-glyoxylate transaminase/(R)-3-amino-2- methylpropionate-pyruvate transaminase;
  ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+); ALDH6A1, malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase
  (acetylating)/methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; ACAA, acetyl-CoA acyltransferase.
  The blue pattern represents the DEGs or DEGs that changed under Cd stress and the
  addition of MT. The rectangle is divided into three equal parts (the left of rectangle
  represents DEGs or DEMs in CK vs T1, the middle of rectangle represents DEGs or
  DEMs in CK vs T2, the right of rectangle represents DEGs or DEMs in CK vs T3). The
  color in the rectangle represents the DEGs or DEMs are regulated under Cd stress
  and the addition of MT (red indicates up-regulation, green indicates down-regulation,
  blue indicates both up-regulation and down-regulation, white indicates neither up-regulation
  nor down-regulation).
