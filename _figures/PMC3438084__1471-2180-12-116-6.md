caption: A subset of the up-regulated genes with known function in response to maize
  root exudates. The significantly up-regulated genes by the root exudates were mapped
  in the KEGG pathway and the diagram was accordingly adapted. The products encoded
  by the up-regulated genes were highlighted in red, whilst the down-regulated YadH
  was highlighted in green. CM stands for cell membrane.
