caption: Fig. 6. A model for p19-mediated PTGS suppression. The dsRNA amplification
  cycle was integrated into current plant PTGS models. The replication cycle of plant
  RNA viruses results in dsRNAs. Aberrant transgenic mRNAs might be converted into
  dsRNAs by host-encoded RdRP without 21–25 nt dsRNAs. Effective transformation of
  transgene mRNAs or viral RNAs into dsRNA by plant RdRP might require PTGS-generated,
  21–25 nt dsRNAs as primers. p19 sequesters 21–25 nt dsRNAs, thus inactivating the
  dsRNA amplification and intensification of the abRNA pathway. Consequently, p19
  interferes with transgene-induced local silencing. Generation of systemic signal
  is prevented by the inactivation of the abRNA pathway, if precursors of 21–25 nt
  RNAs are involved in mobile complex. Alternatively, p19 prevents the incorporation
  of 21–25 nt dsRNAs into the systemic complex. Further studies are required to clarify
  whether p19 can influence RISC activity or not (symbolized by ‘?’).
