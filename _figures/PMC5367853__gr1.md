caption: 'Autotrophic product formation in C. autoethanogenum. The ATP-efficient,
  indirect ethanol route employing phosphotransacetylase (Pta), acetate kinase (Ack)
  and aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR) are depicted in green. The direct ethanol
  biosynthesis route utilizing bi-functional aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE),
  CoA-dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) is
  shown in red. AlsS = acetolactate synthase; 2,3-BDH =2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase;
  BudA = acetolactate decarboxylase; CODH = carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; CoFeSP
  = corrinoid iron sulphur protein; Fdox = oxidized ferredoxin; Fdred = reduced ferredoxin;
  Hyt = NADP-dependent electron bifurcating hydrogenase; LdhA = lactate dehydrogenase;
  Nfn = transhydrogenase; Pfor = pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase; Rnf = H+-translocating
  ferredoxin: NAD+-oxidoreductase; WLP = Wood-Ljungdahl Pathway. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
