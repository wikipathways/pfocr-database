caption: 'Obesity-induced activation of DNA-sensing cGAS–STING signaling pathway mediates
  inflammation and metabolic abnormalities. The metabolic disorder (obesity) destabilizes
  mtDNA localization by inhibiting DsbA-L. Decreased DsbA-L promotes mtDNA liberation,
  which is sensed by cGAS and, in turn, activates the cGAS–STING–TBK-1 pathway. Besides
  active STING–TBK-1, LPS, and poly: I.C could activate TLR4 and TLR3 receptors to
  stimulate the phosphorylation of IRF3. IRF3 and NF-κB activation induce the transcription
  expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IFNα, MCP-1, IL-18) while the phosphorylation
  of PDE3B/4 by active TBK-1 inhibits cellular cAMP levels. The increased expressions
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to inflammation-mediated metabolic dysfunction
  leading to insulin resistance. The reduced cAMP levels suppress PKA signaling contributing
  to the abrogation of thermogenesis (heat production) in adipose tissues.'
