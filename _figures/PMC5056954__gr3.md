caption: In NSCLC cells harbouring activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) and treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Gefitinib,
  Ras/ERK and PI3-kinase-Akt signalling are inhibited. However, while Akt activity
  remains low, Ras/ERK pathway activity recovers. This recovery is driven in part
  by the activity of the Src tyrosine kinase, but also by the loss of expression of
  the ERK-specific phosphatase DUSP6/MKP-3. Loss of DUSP6 expression is secondary
  to the continued inhibition of Akt activity by Gefinitib, resulting in lower levels
  of the transcription factor Ets1, which normally transactivates the DUSP6 gene promoter
  to increase expression. This elevated Ras/ERK pathway activity contributes to TKI
  resistance by reducing the level of the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family protein Bim-EL,
  thus promoting cell survival in the continued presence of the drug.
