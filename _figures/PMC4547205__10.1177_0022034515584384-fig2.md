caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis comparing gingivitis to healthy subjects. Functions
  and scores of 5 activated networks in gingivitis subjects are listed. The top-ranked
  network comprises endocrine disorders, metabolic disease, and carbohydrate metabolism
  functions (score = 25). The majority of molecules in this network are highlighted
  by red, indicating upregulation. Only 2 molecules are highlighted by green, indicating
  downregulation. Genes that are associated with these key network molecules but not
  included in the polymerase chain reaction array are not colored. Straight lines
  represent direct interaction, and dotted lines represent indirect interaction.
