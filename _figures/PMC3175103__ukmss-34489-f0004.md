caption: Expression levels of 24526 genes from 32 microdissected tumours were pooled
  and compared against 10 pooled perilesional controls, and genes that were differentially
  expressed (p value <0.01) were analysed using Ingenuity pathway analysis. Overexpressed
  transcripts are shown in red and underexpressed transcripts are shown in green.
  TRKB (NTRK2) and TRKC (NTRK3), members of the TRK signalling pathway, were overexpressed
  in tumour tissue compared to control samples. Expression of TRKA (NTRK1) however
  was reduced. Downstream members such as PI3K and AKT and BCL2 were also over expressed.
