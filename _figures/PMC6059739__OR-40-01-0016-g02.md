caption: Regulation of the Wnt pathway via YAP/TAZ. The canonical Wnt pathway can
  decompose β-catenin destruction complex and promote the accumulation of β-catenin
  in the nucleus where the β-catenin/TCF4 complex binds to a DNA enhancer element
  within the first intron of the YAP gene to trigger YAP expression in colorectal
  cancer (CRC) cells. However, in the cytoplasm, YAP/TAZ suppresses the nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin, which results in the inhibition of the Wnt pathway. In contrast, the
  Wnt pathway also stabilizes TAZ through its phosphorylation by GSK3. P, phosphorylation;
  ↓, activation; ⊥, inhibition.
