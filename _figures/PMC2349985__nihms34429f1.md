caption: LTB4, a pro-inflammatory lipid mediator, is synthesized from the arachidonic
  acid pathway involving the biosynthetic enzymes 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), Five-Lipoxygenase
  Activating Protein (FLAP) and LTA4 Hydrolase (LTA4H) via 5HPETE and LTA4 as intermediates.
  Arthritis might be initiated by infection mediated activation in the joints and/or
  from the formation of auto-antibodies leading to deposition of immune complexes
  (IC) in the synovium. The immune complexes activate mast cells and cause mast cell
  degranulation, which further leads to the influx of inflammatory cells through vasodilation
  and other mediators. Interplay of synovial cells and the incoming leukocytes leads
  to production of cytokines and activation of the complement cascade. Amplification
  loops between the cytokines and chemoattractants like LTB4 and other chemokines
  sets up perpetual joint inflammation. All of the innate immune cells such as dendritic
  cells, macrophages, neutrophils and mast cells are capable of producing LTB4 by
  the induction of complement or cytokines. Since all of these cells express LTB4
  receptors they set up further amplification loops in the inflamed joints. The solid
  lines represent response to and broken lines represent production of indicated mediators.
