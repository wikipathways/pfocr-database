caption: Schematic summarizing the effects of lactate on intracellular signaling in
  muscle. Contractions stimulate glycolysis and subsequent lactate production and
  accumulation. In combination, lactate accumulation and mitochondrial respiration
  induce ROS production. A ROS-sensitive transcriptome is activated, which elicits
  many cell responses seen in the response to exercise, including MCT1 expression,
  mitochondrial biogenesis, and the production of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., GPx).
  In this figure, novel signaling effects described in the present report (solid arrows)
  are shown. ROS generation (left side of figure) is responsible for regulating MCT1
  expression. For mitochondrial biogenesis (right side), it is likely that the lactate-signaling
  pathway merges with calcium (Ca++) signaling as contractions increase cytosolic
  Ca++ flux. By itself, lactate increases expressions of slow type troponin I (TnI)
  and myogenin that are also known to be responsive to Ca++ flux via calcineurin (CaN).
  ROS can increase intracellular Ca++ that raises CaMK activity. As well, free Ca++
  can also activate CaMK. Lactate elicits a large number of adaptive responses, which
  coordinate metabolism as a functional adaptation to exercise in skeletal muscle
  cells such as proliferation of the lactate oxidation complex; from Ref. [].
