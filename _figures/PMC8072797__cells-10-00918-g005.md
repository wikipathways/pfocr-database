caption: Proposed mechanism of TM in ovarian CSCs. (a) In ovarian CSCs environment,
  the amplified Ca2+ channel functions to maintain stemmness and cell proliferation
  through the AKT, ERK or Wnt pathway. The amplified BKCa channel functions to further
  activate the wnt/ β-catenin pathway through hyperpolarized membrane potential. (b)
  When the BKCa channel is inhibited by selective inhibitor, such as paxillin, the
  Ca2+ channel is further activated by positive feedback following membrane depolarization.
  Increasing of intracellular Ca2+ concentration is enough to maintain stemness and
  proliferation. (c) When the Ca2+ channel is inhibited by a selective inhibitor,
  such as manidipine, the BKCa channel activity enables the maintenance of a weak
  stemness and, therefore, requires a stronger Ca2+ channel blockade to induce cell
  death. (d) When the Ca2+ channel and BKCa channel are blocked simultaneously by
  TM, though weakly, it is enough to disrupt stemness and induce cell death.
