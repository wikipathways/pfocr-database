caption: Schematic overview of suggested mechanisms for hydrogen production during
  sulfur deprivation in light, as it has been described for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
  Deprivation from sulfur leads to a degradation of PSII components, which partly
  inhibits the oxidation of water, and less oxygen is thereby produced in the photosystem.
  The low level of oxygen that is still produced in PSII is continuously consumed
  by the respiration, and the culture becomes anaerobic. Sulfur deprivation also leads
  to degradation of the enzymes in the Calvin cycle, causing this CO2 fixation pathway
  and energy sink to come to a halt. When the Calvin cycle is no longer available
  for reducing CO2, the whole system of PSII and PSI is reduced, creating a potentially
  dangerous situation for the algae. To remove the reductive pressure, the algae dispose
  of the electrons by transferring electrons from ferredoxin to hydrogenase. This
  enzyme then uses the reductive energy to form hydrogen which can easily be released
  from the cell. Depending on culturing conditions and other factors, a certain amount
  of electrons released in the form of hydrogen may originate from degradation of
  starch. This reducing power enters the electron transport chain from the PQ pool.
