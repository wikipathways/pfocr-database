caption: DNA is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern when delivered to the host
  cytoplasm by viral or microbial infection, and a danger-associated molecular pattern
  when leaked into the cytoplasm from damaged mitochondria or nucleus. cGAS is the
  cytosolic DNA sensor that recognizes and binds cytosolic DNA in a DNA-sequence-independent
  manner that subsequently triggers cGAS dimerization and production of a special
  dinucleotide messenger, 2′3′-cGAMP from ATP and GTP. 2′3′-cGAMP binds STING localized
  on ER, through trafficking to Golgi to recruit and activate IKK and TBK1. TBK1 phosphorylates
  STING, which in turn recruits IRF3 for phosphorylation by TBK1. Phosphorylated IRF3
  dimerizes and enters the nucleus, where it cooperates with NF-κB signaling to turn
  on transcription of type I IFNs and other immunomodulatory genes
