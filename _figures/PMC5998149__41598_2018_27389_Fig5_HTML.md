caption: Pathway analysis of selected metabolites. mIMCD3 krab shANKS3 cells were
  represented in red. Luci-i controls were depicted in green. Shaded areas indicate
  the standard deviation at each time point. (A) Tryptophan-Niacin-NAD pathway analysis.
  Precursors of NAD+ were found to be significantly upregulated whereas reduced levels
  of NAD+ and NADP+ were detected. For Trp both GC-MS and LC-MS/MS data was shown.
  (B) Time series analysis of branched-chain amino acids detected by LC-MS/MS. Upon
  Anks3 depletion all three BCAAs were found at diminished concentrations. 2-keto-3-methylvaleric
  acid, a degradation product of isoleucine, was found to be upregulated. (C) All
  six unmodified nucleosides were found at lower concentrations after tet treatment.
  However corresponding bases were not significantly affected. Interestingly, modified
  nucleosides such as 6-methyladenosine and 5-methyluridine were found to be significantly
  upregulated.
