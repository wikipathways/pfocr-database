caption: Canonical and non-canonical signaling to NF-κB. The canonical pathway is,
  e.g., induced by TNFα, IL-1, or LPS and uses a large variety of signaling adaptors
  to engage IKK activity. Phosphorylation of serine residues in the signal responsive
  region (SRR) of classical IκBs by IKKβ leads to IκB ubiquitination and subsequent
  proteosomal degradation. This results in release of the NF-κB dimer, which can then
  translocate to the nucleus and induce transcription of target genes. The non-canonical
  pathway depends on NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase) induced activation of IKKα. IKKα
  phosphorylates the p100 NF-κB subunit, which leads to proteosomal processing of
  p100 to p52. This results in the activation of p52-RelB dimers, which target specific
  κB elements.
