caption: A schematic overview depicting ATL III ameliorates NAFLD by activating the
  AdipoR1-mediated AMPK/SIRT1 pathway. In both HFD-induced NAFLD mouse model and FFAs-induced
  HepG2 steatosis model, AdipoR1-mediated signaling pathway takes part in the protection
  roles of ATL III ameliorating NAFLD. Fatty liver induced by 3-month HFD feeding
  has prominent lipid accumulation with high levels of oxidative stress and fibrosis,
  which is inhibited by ATL III administration. In FFAs-induced HepG2 steatosis model,
  ATL III treatment activates AdipoR1-mediated AMPK/SIRT1 pathway. In one hand, ATL
  III increases SIRT3 and Nrf2 levels, which decreases oxidative stress. In another
  hand, ATL III increases PGC1 α and CPT1A levels, which contributes to fatty acid
  oxidation.
