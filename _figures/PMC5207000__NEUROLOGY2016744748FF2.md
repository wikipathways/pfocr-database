caption: Here we show the vitamin D pathway. Red indicates the gene products with
  which our single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated. Note that
  all 4 SNPs lie in or near genes involved in vitamin D synthesis, transport, or metabolism.
  UVB = ultraviolet B. Adapted from Mokry et al.
