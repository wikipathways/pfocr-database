caption: (A) A variety of environmental triggers modulate hypha formation through
  the cyclic AMP (cAMP)–protein kinase A (PKA) signalling pathway. Muramyl dipeptide
  and CO2 act directly on the adenylate cyclase Cyr1 and other signals, including
  amino acids and glucose, act on Cyr1 indirectly. Many signals act through the transcription
  factor Efg1 to activate the hypha-specific cyclin Hgc1. The cyclins Ccn1 and Hgc1
  form complexes with the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) Cdc28. These complexes promote
  persistent actin polarization for hyphal growth. Farnesol is a quorum-sensing molecule
  that accumulates at high C. albicans cell densities and inhibits hyphal formation.
  Low temperatures inhibit hyphal formation through the inhibitory activity of the
  molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) on the PKA signalling pathway,
  which involves Ras1. The environmental triggers that induce signalling through the
  Ccn1 pathway are thought to be similar to those that induce signalling through the
  PKA pathway but the precise details of Ccn1 activation are unclear. (B) Additional
  environmental factors stimulate hypha formation through alternative signalling pathways.
  These factors include ambient pH (through the Rim101 pathway), physical embedding
  of C. albicans cells within a matrix (through the transcription factor Czf1), hypoxia
  (which involves the transcription factors Efg1 and Efh1) and low nitrogen due to
  starvation (which activates hyphal development by the transcription factor Cph1).
  (C) In addition, genotoxic stress by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), UV radiation, hydroxyurea
  or gene deletions leading to DNA damage or interference with DNA replication cell-cycle
  checkpoints also cause cell filamentation. The alternative signalling mechanisms
  illustrated in parts A, B and C will yield different signalling outputs, and as
  a result the cell surface and immunological properties of these hyphal forms are
  likely to differ (denoted by the different colours of hyphae).
