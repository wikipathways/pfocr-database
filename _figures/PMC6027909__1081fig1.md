caption: The primary mechanisms by which AIBP protects against macrophage inflammatory
  response. In one way, AIBP/apoA-I disrupts lipid raft membrane micro-domains and
  decreases LPS-induced TLR4 activation via ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, which
  activates MyD88-mediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling and then upregulates the expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In another way, AIBP may promote the direct anti-inflammatory
  function in an ABCA1-dependent manner via activation of JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway
  after interaction with apoA-I. In addition, AIBP can also function as an NADH epimerase
  involved in the reconversion of NADHX to NADH, which is critical for mitochondrial
  OXPHOS and plays a potential role in regulation of macrophage inflammation.
