caption: Summary of the proposed pathways of the role of ICG001 to attenuate cardiac
  hypertrophy and ameliorate cardiac fibrosis induced by pressure overload. ICG001
  prevented heart failure induced by pressure overload possibly through two pathways.
  The dotted lines indicate the hypothesized chain of event. One of the pathways attenuated
  immune activation mediated by KLF5 upregulation, while the other pathway blocked
  the PPAR-α downregulation that causes metabolic alteration. ICG001 inhibited the
  binding of CREB-binding protein (CBP) to β-catenin and then reduced the expression
  of KLF5 leading to the reduction of macrophage recruitment and TGF-β. Inhibition
  of CBP and β-catenin complex formation by ICG001 prevented accumulation of lactate,
  aspartate, and alanine and improved the metabolism of branched-chain amino acid
  (BCAA). Oxidative stress was reduced by ICG001 according to the ratio of reduced
  and oxidized glutathione. Both pathways ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis
  and ultimately prevented HF.
