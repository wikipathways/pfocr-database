caption: Most significantly differential network between cellular proliferation and
  cell death. 8 metabolites (2-oxoglutaric acid, D-pantothenic acid, L-aspartic acid,
  L-methionine, L-phenylalanine, L-threonine, L-valine and oleic acid), resulting
  from cellular proliferation are significantly altered between BC cells with or without
  an intact FA pathway. 5 metabolites (L-alanine, L-methionine, L-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan
  and L-threonine) which are the end-products of the reduced activity in cell death.
  Amongst the amino acid intermediates, methionine, phenylalanine and threonine were
  involved in both activities of promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell death
  (Red line means activation and blue line means inhibition).
