caption: 'Basic pathways of AGE chemistry and associated physiology and pathology.
  In the classical Maillard reaction (green), AGEs are formed when reducing sugars
  and proteins interact. Initially, reaction intermediates termed Schiff bases are
  formed. These subsequently rearrange into ketoamines known as Amadori products or
  early glycation products. These are more stable products than Schiff bases but,
  at this point in the reaction, the chemistry is still reversible. After further
  chemistry, the reaction becomes irreversible and forms AGEs (orange). There are
  several other cellular pathways, including the polyol pathway (shown) and lipid
  peroxidation (where oxidants, such as free radicals, “attack” (lightning bolt) lipids
  that contain carbon-carbon double bonds), that can lead to the formation of reactive
  dicarbonyls, “termed carbonyl stress” (purple) rapidly accelerating the formation
  of AGEs. Beyond proteins, lipids and DNA can also undergo glycation, leading to
  AGEs. Pathways such as the polyol pathway only occur inside the body. AGEs have
  both physiological roles (orange) and pathological effects (red). (Abbreviations:
  AGEs, advanced glycation end products; ROS, reactive oxygen species).'
