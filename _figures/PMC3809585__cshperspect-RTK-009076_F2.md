caption: TAM receptor signaling pathways. (A) Free TAMs. As receptor dimers, activated
  TAM proteins drive a conventional RTK signaling pathway that is dominated by the
  phosphorylation and activation of Akt. The positions of major tyrosine autophosphorylation
  sites shared between Tyro3, Axl, and Mer are indicated (P). The tyrosine immediately
  downstream from the kinase domain (Y821 in human Axl) is bound by the SH2 domain
  of Grb2, which recruits the p85 subunit of PI3 kinase through an SH3 (Grb2)-proline-rich
  domain (p85) interaction. Alternatively, p85 can bind this phosphotyrosine directly
  using its own SH2 domain. P85 also binds to the indicated phosphotyrosine within
  the kinase domain (see, e.g., ). Mobilization of the joint p85/p110 PI3K complex
  results in the downstream phosphorylation and activation of Akt. Mer activation
  has also been found to drive the downstream activation of PLC-γ, by a mechanism
  that is not delineated biochemically (). These pathways are required for TAM regulation
  of cell survival and the mobilization of the actin cytoskeleton required for the
  engulfment of apoptotic cells by phagocytes. (B) TAM receptors complexed with the
  type I interferon receptor (IFNAR). In dendritic cells, TAM receptors—when activated
  by the binding of a TAM ligand—form a coimmunoprecipitable complex specifically
  with the R1 (or α) chain of the IFNAR (). This may be associated with the activation
  of Jak1 (J1) (). Direct activation of the hybrid TAM-IFNAR receptor by the addition
  of Gas6 leads to the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Stat1. This
  dimeric transcription factor then translocates to the nucleus, where it drives the
  expression of the cytoplasmic cytokine inhibitors SOCS1 and 3. This pathway is required
  for the inhibition of inflammatory responses in dendritic cells (; ). See text for
  details.

  description: TAM receptor signaling pathways. (A) Free TAMs. As receptor dimers,
    activated TAM proteins drive a conventional RTK signaling pathway that is dominated
    by the phosphorylation and activation of Akt. The positions of major tyrosine
    autophosphorylation sites shared between Tyro3, Axl, and Mer are indicated (P).
    The tyrosine immediately downstream from the kinase domain (Y821 in human Axl)
