caption: Activation of NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) by canonical and atypical pathways.
  (a) NF-κB activation by Toll-like receptor (TLRs) and cytokine receptors. The canonical
  pathway is activated by a large number of agonists [e.g. tumor necrosis fator (TNF),
  interleukin 1 (IL-1) or microbial ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] through
  the triggering of various cytokine receptors or TLRs and stimulate the IκB kinase
  (IKK) complex (IKK1-IKK2-NEMO) to phosphorylate IκBα and promote its degradation.
  The atypical NF-κB pathways involve stimulus-induced proteolysis of the NF-κB2 p100
  (the so-called noncanonical pathway) and NF-κB1 p105 precursor proteins. A limited
  number of agonists induce processing of p100 to p52 via activation of NF-κB–inducing
  kinase (NIK) and IKK1, resulting in the nuclear translocation of p52-RelB heterodimers.
  By contrast, the canonical IKK complex triggers p105 proteolysis, which releases
  associated Rel subunits and also facilitates activation of the p105-associated TPL-2
  MEK kinase, which triggers extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated
  protein (MAP) kinase activation. (b) Canonical NF-κB activation by T-cell receptor
  (TCR). Ligation of TCR and the costimulatory molecule CD28 triggers the association
  of the intermediate CBM signaling complex, composed of Carma1, Bcl10 and MALT1,
  with the Ubc13-Uve1 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme heterodimer. This mediates K63-linked
  ubiquitination of NEMO, Bcl10 and MALT1, promoting the interaction of the CBM complex
  with IKK and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which
  is a required step for the activation of IKK. A Carma1-independent pathway, which
  stimulates Tak1 catalytic activity and consequently phosphorylation of the IKK2
  activation loop, is also necessary for IKK activation. Ub, ubiquitin.
