caption: Several signals are generated upon wounding, which activate different RTKs
  at the cell membrane, such as EGFR and Stitcher. These RTKs activate the ERK pathway
  leading to activation of Grh and Fos transcription factors, which subsequently induce
  the expression of cuticle repair genes (Ddc and Msn). One hypothesis for Holn1 function
  is that Holn1 is involved in the transcription and/or splicing of components of
  the ERK/Grh/Fos pathway in the nucleus and thereby contribute to proper wound healing.
