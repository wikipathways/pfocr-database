caption: Apoptosis of immune cells was first induced by antibody depletion or γ-irradiation.
  Apoptotic cells are then detected and digested by phagocytes, during which TGF-β
  is produced by both phagocytes and apoptotic cells. Following administration of
  self-peptides, naive T cells initiate TCR signaling within this TGF-β-rich environment,
  and Foxp3 expression is induced to instruct naive T cells along the Treg differentiation
  pathway. These induced Treg cells act to maintain tolerance toward autoantigen and
  reverse autoimmune disease.
