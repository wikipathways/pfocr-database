caption: 'Metabolic profile of astrocytes []. Glucose is transported to astrocytes
  through GLUT1 transporter and then metabolized to lactate. Lactate is transported
  outside astrocytes and taken up by neurons by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs).
  Intracellular lactate in neurons is oxidized to pyruvate and metabolized along the
  oxygen pathway. GLUT1: glucose transporter-1; MCT: monocarboxylate transporter;
  TCA: Krebs cycle; Pyr: pyruvate; Lac: lactate.'
