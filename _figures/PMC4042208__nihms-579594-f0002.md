caption: Redox regulation of autophagy. The Keap1-Nrf2 pathway is not only regulated
  by the proteasomes but also by autophagic activity. The cysteine-rich protein Keap1
  serves as a redox sensor and can bind to p62 and be degraded by autophagic activity.
  Undegraded Keap1 complexes with Nrf2 and mediates Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation
  by the proteasomes. In response to oxidants, cysteine modification on Keap1 releases
  Nrf2 by inhibiting its ubiquitination. Keap1-free Nrf2 is stabilized and transported
  to the nucleus where it activates transcription of antioxidant genes, including
  HO-1 and NQO1, proteasomal PA28αβ, thereby increases proteasomal degradation of
  oxidatively damaged proteins as well as p62, which plays an important role in autophagy
  by interacting with both ubiquitinated proteins and microtubule-associated protein
  light chain 3 (LC3), thereby facilitates autophagy-lysosomal degradation of proteins
  and dysfunctional organelles such as the mitochondria. Some of the autophagy proteins
  are also susceptible to cysteine modification, examples include ATG4 which is a
  cysteine protease involved in pro-LC3 cleavage, LC3I to LC3II conversion by lipidation,
  and LC3II to LC3I conversion by delipidation. DJ-1 is a cysteine protease playing
  a role in mitochondrial quality control and DJ-1 mutant mice or human Parkinson's
  disease patients accumulate abnormal mitochondria.
