caption: Overall structure and signal transduction functions of programmed death-1
  ligand 1. Schematic representation of the molecular organization of PD-L1 in the
  cell membrane. The reverse signaling activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and counteracting
  apoptosis are indicated. The blue line shows inhibitory relationship between PD-L1
  reverse signaling and induction of apoptotic pathways. Red arrows show the activating
  relationships between the indicated proteins. Ig V and Ig C indicate immunoglobulin-like
  variable and conserved sequence motifs. TM, transmembrane domain; ICD, intracellular
  cytoplasmic domain; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; AKT, AKR mouse T cell lymphoma;
  and mTOR, molecular target of rapamycin
