caption: Model for the role of G1P3 and ISG12 in the modulation of IFNs antiviral
  response. In this model, G1P3 is induced at early time points after viral infection
  and serves to stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential, resist apoptosis, and
  sustain the production of IFNs through the RIG-I/MAVS pathway. ISG12 is induced
  at later time points of postinfection and destabilizes mitochondrial membrane potential,
  curtails RIG-I signaling, induces apoptosis, and downregulates IFNs production.
  IFN, interferon; RIG-I, RA inducible gene I.
