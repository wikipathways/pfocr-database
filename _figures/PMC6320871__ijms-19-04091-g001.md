caption: 'A simplified model for BR interaction with the innate immunity pathways
  in plants. The BR signaling pathway (far left) has crosstalk with different MTI
  or PTI pathways at multiple levels (receptor, cytoplasmic, or transcriptional).
  The crosstalk is either BAK1-dependent (flg22- or elf18-triggered immunity) or independent
  (chitin-triggered immunity), and MTI/PTI triggered by different MAMPs/PAMPs converge
  on similar downstream signaling events, including the formation of MAPK cascades,
  activation of transcription factors, and defense-related gene expression, among
  others. Please note that the two RLCKs, BIK1 and BSK1, directly connect the FLS2-BAK1
  and/or ERF-BAK1 receptor complex to the downstream MAPK components, and that the
  two homologous transcription factors BZR1 and BES1 play distinct roles in flg22-triggered
  bacteria defense. BZR1 inhibits plant immunity by suppressing the defense-related
  gene expression, whereas BES1 enhances plant immunity by promoting MYB30-mediated
  signaling pathways. Whether BZR1 and BES1 play different roles in regulating the
  trade-offs between growth and immunity under different environmental conditions
  needs further studies to elucidate. CERK1, chitin-elicitor receptor kinase 1; FLS2,
  FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE 2; ERF, elongation factor-TU (EF-Tu) RECEPTOR; LYK5, lysin motif
  receptor kinase 5; MTI: MAMP-triggered immunity; PTI: PAMP-triggered immunity; MAMP:
  microbe-associated molecular patterns; PAMP: pathogen-associated molecular patterns;
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; RLCK: receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase.'
