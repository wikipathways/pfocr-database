caption: 'NAD+biosynthesis and major cellular functions. Cellular NAD+ levels are
  maintained by biosynthesis from dietary precursors: amino acid tryptophan (Trp)
  and vitamin B3, which comprises nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM), and nicotinamide
  riboside (NR). Trp is converted to quinolinic acid (QA) in the kynurenine pathway
  and further by quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QAPRT) into nicotinamide mononucleotide
  (NAMN). NAMN is also produced from NA in the Preiss–Handler pathway by nicotinic
  acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT). Both pathways are completed by the transformation
  of NAMN into nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) by nicotinamide mononucleotide
  adenylyltransferases (NMNAT1, NMNAT2, and NMNAT3) and further into NAD+ by NAD+
  synthetase (NADS). The salvage pathway recycles NAM produced by NAD+-consuming enzymes:
  sirtuins (SIRTs), ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTDs), as well NAD+ glycohydrolases
  and cyclic ADP-ribose synthases. NAM is transformed by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAMPT) into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is then turned into NAD+via
  NMNATs. This pathway can be also fueled by NR, derived from diet or from dephosphorylation
  of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NAD+ levels are balanced by subcellular compartmentalization
  of NAD+synthesis and consumption. In the cytoplasm and mitochondria, NAD+ is utilized
  via multiple pathways in bioenergetics, maintenance of redox homeostasis, or cell
  signaling. Whereas the nuclear NAD+ pool contributes in addition to maintenance
  of genomic homeostasis mainly via the NAD+-dependent ARTDs and SIRTs (see text for
  details).'
