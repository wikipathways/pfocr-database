caption: The potential mechanisms of Sirt1 in microglial activation and/or neuropathic
  pain. Sirt1 can be positively regulated by the AMPK and PPARδ pathways, as well
  as by Arc, but can be negatively regulated by JNK signaling and specific miRNAs
  (e.g., miR-210 and miR-155). Sirt1 governs excessive microglial activation by deacetylating
  p65 at lysine 310, thereby suppressing NF-κB activity. Additionally, Sirt1 can shift
  the microglial phenotype toward the M2 state by modulating ROS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome
  signaling and the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway. Furthermore, Sirt1 activates the PGC-1α/Nrf2
  and Sonic hedgehog (Shh)/GLI family zinc finger-1 (Gli-1) signaling pathways to
  inhibit microglial activation. Additionally, Sirt1 can inhibit the release of HMGB1,
  which in turn suppresses the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway
