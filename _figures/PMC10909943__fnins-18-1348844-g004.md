caption: TUDCA’s impact on Preventing hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of Tau.
  Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), consist of hyperphosphorylated and aggregated microtubule-associated
  protein Tau, is another pathological hallmark of AD. TUDCA could decrease Aβ-induced
  activation of caspase-3 and the subsequent cleavage of Tau protein, while promoting
  the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in AD to inhibit p53 expression and the activity
  of Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), thereby regulating Tau phosphorylation.
  The processes of induction and formation of hyperphosphorylated Tau and NFTs are
  represented by black arrows. The inhibitory effects of TUDCA on caspase-3 and p53
  are indicated by two brown arrows with flat heads, while the inhibitory effects
  of AKT on GSK3β are indicated by a blue arrow with a flat head
