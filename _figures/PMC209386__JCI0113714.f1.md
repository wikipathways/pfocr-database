caption: Effect of salicylates on insulin signaling during insulin resistance. (a)
  Normally, the occupied insulin receptor phosphorylates scaffold proteins, such as
  the IRS-1, on critical tyrosine residues. However, in insulin-resistant states,
  a number of agents, such as the cytokine TNF-α or circulating FFAs, lead through
  intermediary signaling pathways to the activation of IKK, which in turn indirectly
  increases the number of phosphorylated serine and threonine residues (indicated
  by blue circles) on IRS-1. This modification blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation
  and converts IRS-1 into an insulin receptor inhibitory protein. (b) In the presence
  of salicylates, IKK activity is inhibited, reducing the IRS-1 serine/threonine phosphorylation
  and allowing IRS-1 to be phosphorylated on tyrosine. These phosphorylated tyrosine
  residues (black squares) serve as binding sites for a number of signaling molecules,
  most importantly PI 3′-kinase, which initiate signaling pathways regulating metabolism.
  Aspirin (ASA) also inhibits cyclooxygensases (COX) to prevent the generation of
  inflammatory prostaglandins (PGE) from arachidonic acid (AA) in a pathway unrelated
  to the effects of the drug on insulin action.
