caption: Breast Patient Pathway OverviewUniversal patient pathway for breast cancer
  management in three sequential intervals of care including the Patient Interval
  the Diagnostic Interval, and the Treatment Interval. The Patient Interval spans
  the time from initial presentation based on onset of clinical symptoms or asymptomatic
  screening to the point where a breast abnormality warranting further evaluation
  is detected. During the Diagnostic Interval, the identified breast abnormality undergoes
  the ‘triple test’ work-up based on clinical evaluation, imaging and tissue sampling
  to achieve a definitive benign or malignant diagnosis. The health system should
  endeavor to complete the diagnostic work-up within a 60 day (2 month) period, because
  worsened survival outcomes can result from diagnostic delays extending significantly
  beyond 3 months. During the Treatment Interval, each patient undergoes individualized
  evaluation and treatment planning for curative therapy or palliative management,
  the selection of which depends on the extent of disease and potential for meaningful
  clinical improvement based on the application of realistically available resources.
