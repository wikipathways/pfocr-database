caption: Crosstalk between the genes (in blue) obtained from the systematic review
  of LR and their biological functions in the dopaminergic neurons. Levodopa is metabolized
  by COMT and DDC. Dopamine in the pre-synaptic neuron is produced from and released
  into the synapse by exocytosis. The receptors in the post-synaptic neurons [DRD1,
  DRD2, DRD3, ADORA2, glutamate receptors (mGLUR1/S), NMDA, HTR2A] uptake dopamine
  and further downstream cellular signalling leads to altered gene expression. Signalling
  pathways like the Ras-GRF1 mediated signalling, Ca2+-calmodulin dependent pathway
  and adenylyl cyclase participate in dopaminergic response. The function of 6 common
  genes (in bold) found with overlapping roles in LR and PD risk are discussed in
