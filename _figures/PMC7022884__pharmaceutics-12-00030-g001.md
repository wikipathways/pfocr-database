caption: DNA vaccine mechanism for induction of cell-mediated and humoral immunity.
  The DNA-Nanoparticles (NPs) vaccine is administered through one of many routes,
  such as intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or
  oral, and transfects target cells, delivering the DNA payload to the cytosol. The
  DNA molecules translocate across the nuclear membrane, initiating gene transcription
  and subsequent synthesis of the encoded proteins. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
  are of primary importance for processing and presenting antigens to lymphocytes
  for the induction of robust immune responses. Specifically, APCs present antigens
  on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I molecules either following direct transfection
  of the DNA vaccine or through cross-presentation from other cells, such as APC phagocytosis
  of transfected apoptotic or necrotic bodies. APCs also present antigens on MHC II
  molecules when transfected cells secrete the encoded proteins which are then endocytosed
  by APCs. APCs then can activate naive T cells by presenting antigens through the
  use of MHC I and T cell receptors (TCR), stimulating antigen-specific T-cell immune
  responses. Alternatively, through the MHC II pathway, processed antigens are presented
  to CD4 T cells, which mediate the induction of B cell responses that are capable
  of stimulating antigen-specific antibody-mediated immunity. Adapted from [], which
