caption: Entry pathways of LAs with different chemical properties. Diagram of the
  movements of differently charged LA molecules (B, basic amine, N, neutral LA, Q,
  quaternary charged LA) to and from the channel. Black dashed lines are transitions
  requiring open activation and fast inactivation gates, as the drug enters from the
  intracellular side. Black solid lines are transitions probably not strongly depending
  on the gating state. Violet and blue lines indicate two pathways observed in MD
  studies for lidocaine and benzocaine, respectively, (; ), where the LA does not
  pass through the membrane phase but enters a lipophilic pathway within the channel
  protein towards the side fenestrations (see also ). Subscript characters represent
  membrane phase (m), receptor site (r), extracellular (o) and intracellular (i) space.
  The figure is based on the diagram reported in ().
