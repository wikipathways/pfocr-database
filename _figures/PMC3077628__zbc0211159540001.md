caption: NmR levels positively correlate with the PHO pathway activities. A, the model
  of NAD+ biosynthesis pathways in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of
  a de novo synthesis from tryptophan and the salvage of various NAD+ precursors.
  In vertebrates including mammals, the involvement of Nam deamidase Pnc1 in Nam salvage
  is absent. Instead, the utilization of Nam is achieved by the addition of phosphoribose
  to make NMN, which is mediated by the Nam phosphoribosyl transferase (). NaR, nicotinic
  acid riboside. NaAD, deamido NAD+. Abbreviations of protein names are shown in parentheses.
  B, the PHO responsive signaling pathway is shown. The PHO signaling is normally
  repressed by a cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complex (Pho80-Pho85), which phosphorylates
  and inactivates the transcription factor Pho4. When phosphate is limiting, Pho81
  (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) inhibits the Pho80-Pho85 complex, thereby
  derepressing PHO-responsive genes. The regulation of Pho80-Pho85 is distinct from
  typical cyclin-dependent kinase regulation; the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
  Pho81 is constitutively associated with Pho80-Pho85, and inositol heptakisphosphate
  (IP7) is required for Pho80-Pho85 inactivation. Pho84/89, high affinity Pi transporters;
  Pho90/91/87, low affinity Pi transporters; Pho5 and Pho8, repressible phosphatases.
  C, mutants with increased PHO activity release more NmR, whereas mutants with decreased
  PHO activity release less NmR compared with WT. The upper two panels show NmR release
  of mutants defective in high affinity phosphate transporters (first panel) or in
  low affinity phosphate transporters (second panel) determined by cross-feeding assay.
  The lower two panels show NmR release of mutants defective in the regulatory factors.
  Results show growth of the NAD+ auxotrophic npt1Δqpt1Δ recipient cells (plated on
  YPD at a density of ∼9000 cells/cm2) supported by feeder cells (the PHO mutants,
  ∼2 × 104 cells spotted directly onto the recipient lawn). Cells were grown at 30
  °C for 2 days. D, the correlation between the growth (A600) of the NAD+ auxotrophic
  npt1Δqpt1Δpho5Δ reporter cells and the level of supplemented NmR (nmol) in 8 ml
  of culture is shown. E, intracellular NmR levels also correlate with the PHO pathway
  activities. The levels of intracellular NmR are determined by supplementing reporter
  cells with cell extracts prepared from the strains of interest (cross-feeding bioassay,
  “Experimental Procedures”). Results of one representative set of three independent
  experiments are shown. The error bars denote S.D. The p values are calculated using
  Student's t test (***, p < 0.005).
