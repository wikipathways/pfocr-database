caption: 'Iron homeostasis pathways are reprogrammed in response to O2 availability:
  a model. Under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, we propose that iron is distributed
  to iron storage complexes, Fur, iron-binding proteins, or Fe-S biogenesis and heme
  synthesis pathways. However, under anaerobic growth conditions, iron uptake is shifted
  to ferrous transport systems, expression of iron storage proteins is increased,
  and Fe-S biogenesis occurs primarily by the housekeeping Isc pathway. When expressed
  under anaerobic iron-limiting conditions, we propose that RyhB targets anaerobically
  induced Fe-S-binding and iron-binding proteins of anaerobic respiratory pathways
  in addition to other constitutively expressed RyhB targets. Whereas under aerobic
  growth conditions, iron uptake is shifted to ferric transport systems, iron storage
  gene expression is decreased, and Fe-S biogenesis is still mainly by the housekeeping
  Isc pathway, but expression of the stress-induced Suf pathway is increased. When
  expressed under aerobic iron-limiting conditions, RyhB switches from targeting Fe-S-binding
  and iron-binding proteins of anaerobic respiratory pathways to those of aerobic
  respiratory pathways and the TCA cycle. The abundance of Mn, Mn proteins, and Mn
  efflux systems also increases under aerobic growth conditions.'
