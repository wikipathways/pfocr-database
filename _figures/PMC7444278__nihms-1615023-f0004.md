caption: (Left) In the absence of vHH, the PTCH1 receptor is enriched in cilia, suppressing
  the ciliary enrichment and activation of SMO. KIF7 aids in shuttling the SUFU-GLI
  complex to the ciliary tip. Negative regulator GPR161 activates adenylyl cyclase
  3 (AC3), facilitating PKA activation. PKA phosphorylates the full length GLI (GLIFL)
  which promotes the formation of GLI repressor (GLIR). GLIR translocates to the nucleus
  and suppresses vHH-dependent gene targets. (Right) vHH ligand binds PTCH1, which
  is subsequently removed from the cilium permitting ciliary SMO enrichment and activation
  (star). Activated SMO promotes the dissociation of the GLI-SUFU enabling activated
  GLI (GLIA) formation. GLIA translocates to the nucleus to promote HH-dependent gene
  transcription.
