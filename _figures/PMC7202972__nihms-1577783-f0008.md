caption: Panel A. Down-regulating effect of growth hormone (GH) on Cyp2d22. GH activates
  its receptor (GHR) on hepatocyte membrane, which then activates Jak2, an effect
  followed by phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription
  5b (STAT5b), which dimerizes and then binds to a specific element on the promoter
  of Cyp2d22 gene, thus inhibiting its transcription. Panel B. Up-regulating effect
  of progesterone on Cyp2d22. Progesterone inhibits the insulin-induced activation
  of the PI3k/AKT/FOXO1β signaling pathway (), thus preventing the translocation of
  the forkhead box protein O1β (FOXO1β) into the cytoplasm, an effect that favors
  the transcription of Cyp2d22. Dotted lines depict inhibition.
