caption: 'Mechanisms proposed for lactate to depolarize POMC neurons of the hypothalamus.
  In a high-energy condition, lactate modulates the activity of POMC neurons through
  two pathways: (1) directly through incorporation via MCT2 or indirectly by binding
  to HCAR1 in astrocytes. (A) In a classical mechanism of neuronal activation, lactate
  is taken up by neurons using MCT2 and serves as a suitable energetic substrate.
  The increase in the ATP/ADP ratio causes the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels,
  producing a depolarization. (B) The binding of lactate to HCAR1 in astrocytes activates
  a Gi/o-coupled pathway that, through an increase in intracellular calcium, leads
  to the release of glutamate onto POMC neurons. In this model, the activation of
  glutamate receptors will cause depolarization of POMC neurons. Dotted line shows
  a possible mechanism that has not been evaluated yet.'
