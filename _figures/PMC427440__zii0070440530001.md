caption: Model of the regulatory pathway for the activity of the alternative sigma
  factor σB of S. aureus, which is homologous to the core regulatory pathway of B.
  subtilis. In these species, σB is negatively regulated by the anti-sigma factor
  RsbW, which additionally acts as a specific kinase for the anti-anti-sigma factor
  RsbV. RsbV activity depends on phosphorylation status, and inactive phosphorylated
  RsbV could be activated by dephosphorylation by the specific phosphatase RsbU. Transcriptional
  analysis of the deletion mutants generated in S. epidermidis in this study suggests
  that regulation of σB activity in this species is homologous to that in S. aureus
  and B. subtilis.
