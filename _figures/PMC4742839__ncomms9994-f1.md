caption: Genome-scale human metabolic model is integrated with the liver gene expression
  profile (human liver biopsies from subjects with NAFLD and controls) and the splanchnic
  flux (metabolomics of human serum from hepatic vein and artery from subjects with
  NAFLD) data by using GSMM. The GSMM analysis provides liver functionality scores,
  reaction activity and pathway enrichment in the context of NAFLD.FVA, flux variability
  analysis; iMAT, Integrative Metabolic Analysis Tool; MPA, metabolic phenotypic analysis;
  QP, quadratic programming.
