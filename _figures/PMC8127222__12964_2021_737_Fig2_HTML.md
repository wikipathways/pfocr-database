caption: 'Schematic representation of the role of KCTDs in modulation of potentially
  tumorigenetic pathways. a: PI3K/AKT pathway. The activation of the GPCR receptor
  leads to the dissociation of the heterotrimer G into Gα and Gβγ. Subsequently, Gβγ
  activates PI3K that phosphorylates AKT. KCTD5 and KCTD12 negatively regulate the
  AKT pathway by triggering proteolysis of Gβγ heterodimer and inhibiting the phosphorylation
  of AKT, respectively. KCTD20 and BTBD10 suppress the PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation
  of AKT, acting as positive regulators of the pathway. b: WNT pathway. In the absence
  of Wnt ligand, β-catenin is degraded through the “destruction complex” (composed
  of CK1, axin, GSK-3β and APC), which phosphorylates β-catenin for ubiquitin-mediated
  proteasomal degradation. KCTD1 negatively regulates Wnt signalling by Enhancing
  β-catenin degradation. c: NF-κB pathway. Binding of inflammatory cytokines to TLR
  leads to the activation of the IKK complex, which phosphorylates IκBα. IκBα phosphorylation
  induces its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, leading to nuclear
  translocation of the NF-κB transcriptional complex. TNFAIP1 interacts with KCTD10
  inducing its degradation and inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. d:
  Notch pathway. KCT10 interacts with Cullin3 and the intracellular domain of Notch1,
  mediating Notch1 ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation'
