caption: SIRT1 regulates individual steroid hormone receptors via different mechanisms.
  A) SIRT1 regulates the AR through direct deacetylation, thereby inhibiting AR activation
  and translocation and the transcription of AR-dependent genes. B) SIRT1 inhibits
  the PR by regulating the nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of the receptor, and thereby
  the downstream activation of PR-regulated genes. C) SIRT1 regulates ERα by inhibiting
  the PI3K/AKT (p85/p110) pathway, possibly through FOXO3a. This inhibits the translocation
  of ERα from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thus decreasing ERα binding to DNA and
  ERα-dependent gene transcription. D) The energy-sensing capabilities of SIRT1 regulate
  its effect on GR signaling. The cellular NAD/NADH ratio regulates SIRT1-mediated
  deacetylation of the GR and thus its ability to interact with the co-activator p300.
  E) SIRT1 regulates the MR by binding DOT1, thereby enhancing DOT1-mediated repression
  of MR-regulated genes. SIRT1 regulation of MR is independent of SIRT1 deacetylase
  activity.
