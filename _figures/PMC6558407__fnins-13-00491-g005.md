caption: Insulin and autophagy signaling modulation in Huntington’s disease (HD).
  (A) Although the IGF-1 role on HD still seems paradoxical, it is clear that it develops
  an important role in this pathology. As observed in some studies, HD patients present
  higher basal plasma levels of IGF-1, which may be related with an IGF-1 resistance
  condition and a reduction in the insulin pathway. The reduction in IR activity results
  in reduced mTORC2 and AKT-mTORC1 activities, which leads to, respectively, a reduction
  in autophagosome precursor formation and an increase in the autophagy process, which
  may be related with the upregulation of autophagosomes with deficits in cargo recognition.
  However, long term IR down regulation, due to for example, receptor depletion or
  long term IR inhibition, results in reduced autophagy, which may be due to a lack
  of essential autophagosome precursor formation, and increased mHtt aggregates. (B)
  Non-pharmacological approaches such as dietary restriction also demonstrated to
  have a dual effect depending on the time. Short-term fasting resulted in increased
  autophagy and reduction on mHtt aggregation, while long-term serum deprivation resulted
  in reduced autophagosome formation.
