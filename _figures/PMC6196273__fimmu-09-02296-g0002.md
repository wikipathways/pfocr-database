caption: Iron chelators modulate multiple immunometabolic pathways via the stabilization
  of HIF1α. Under homeostatic conditions, the PHD enzymes hydroxylate HIF1α marking
  it for degradation. These enzymes require oxygen (O2), iron (Fe), α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG), and ascorbate (Asc) as cofactors to function. When oxygen is low (hypoxia),
  the PHD enzymes are disabled, resulting in the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α (HIF1α). Other factors such as the accumulation of the metabolite succinate
  or reactive oxygen species (ROS) can also inhibit PHD enzymes. The therapeutic use
  of iron chelators will reduce the availability of iron inside the cell and therefore
  deny the PHD enzymes of the iron they require to function. Iron chelators thereby
  stabilize HIF1α which promotes enhanced flux through glycolysis by binding to the
  promoter region of the pfkfb3 gene. This increased rate of glycolysis produces lactate
  and synthesizes the required building blocks for cellular proliferation and effector
  function. PAMP or DAMP signals in the macrophage (such as LPS stimulation or infection
  with Mtb, for example) leads to increased aerobic glycolysis and a break in the
  TCA cycle at 2 points; succinate (which promotes IL1β and ROS production as well
  as further inhibiting PHD enzymes) and citrate (which leads to the accumulation
  of the anti-bacterial metabolite, itaconate, via the enzyme IRG-1). HIF1α also mediates
  increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) which provides NADPH
  required from NO and ROS production. HIF1α promotes fatty acid synthesis (FAS),
  leading to the accumulation of lipid droplets and the production of eicosanoids.
  There is also a role for HIF1α in promoting amino acid metabolism. Glutamine can
  be used to produce succinate or the antioxidant glutathione. Tryptophan is processed
  by the iron-dependent enzyme IDO1, which results in a net anti-inflammatory response
  but can also produce NAD or picolinic acid, which has anti-microbial properties.
  Thus iron chelation may be a useful tool for manipulating macrophage metabolism
  during Mtb infection through the stabilization of HIF1α.
