caption: Mast cells selectively produce inflammatory mediators and impact the early
  responses to Chlamydia reproductive tract infection. Human mast cells sparsely take
  up Chlamydia, do not undergo degranulation, and are resistant to its intracellular
  life cycle. Mast cell–Chlamydia interaction occurs downstream of the NF-kB-mediated
  pathway with an upregulation of the expression of several inflammatory genes along
  with the production of proinflammatory mediators at the protein level. In the absence
  of mast cells in vivo, mice display an altered chemokine environment with reduced
  recruitment of effector cells, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and B cells into
  the reproductive tract.
