caption: Energetic metabolic reprogramming in tubular epithelial cells during sepsis-induced
  AKI. Activated HIF-1α promotes the transformation of pyruvate into lactate, and
  inhibits the transformation of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, thus blocking entry into
  the Krebs cycle. HIF-1α also induces the expression of PKM2, and slows down the
  conversion of phosphoenol pyruvate to pyruvate. HK is activated by Akt or O2− and
  increases glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity which is linked to increased
  PPP activity. As ATP levels decrease, AMPK is activated. AMPK leads to induction
  of mitochondrial biogenesis by PGC-1α, inhibits mTORC, and activates mitophagy by
  phosphorylating the serine/threonine protein kinase ULK1. Acetyl-CoA, acetyl-coenzyme
  A; PKM2, M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase; HK, hexokinase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  mTORC, mammalian target of rapamycin complex.
