caption: 'Schematic representation of signaling pathways that were involved in exosomes/MVs
  mediated pro‐regenerative capacity in cutaneous wound healing, bone regeneration,
  hindlimb ischemia, and vascular injury repair. The mechanisms of tissue recovery
  following EVs treatment have been attributed in part to the ability of exosomes/MVs
  to promote angiogenesis at the site of injury. Exosomes/MVs can promote bone regeneration
  through modulating the osteogenic differentiation of recipient BMSCs. Exosomes/EVs
  treatment can promote the cutaneous wound healing process, while excessive scar
  formation can be prevented in later stages. Exosomes/MVs‐shuttled miRNAs have been
  demonstrated to reduce inflammation by modulating target proteins in inflammatory
  signaling pathway during wound healing. Abbreviations: ‐, the specific signaling
  pathway has not been identified; BMSC, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell; EV, extracellular
  vesicle; miRNA, microRNA; MV, microvesicle.'
