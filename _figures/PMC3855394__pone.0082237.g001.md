caption: (A) Overview of this study. The membrane-tethered peptide activates human
  GPCR, which is heterologously produced in yeast, thereby activating the chimeric
  Gα proteins. This promotes the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and
  transcription factor Ste12p. Phosphorylated Ste12p induces transcription of the
  GFP reporter gene by binding to a pheromone response element in the FIG1 promoter.
  (B) Functional domains encoded by the membrane-tethered peptide plasmids. After
  processing by the secretory pathway, the signal sequence and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol
  (GPI) targeting sequence are cleaved and the peptide sequence, which contains a
  free N-terminus, is tethered on the plasma membrane by GPI covalently linked to
  the C-terminus.
