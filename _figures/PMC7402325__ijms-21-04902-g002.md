caption: The PI3K/AKT pathway is a superordinate module of SOX2 and p53 expression
  control. The PI3K/AKT pathway (blue) resembles a superordinate regulatory module
  for the expression control of SOX2 (grey), a stemness inducing transcriptional master
  regulator (see chapter 3), and the tumor-suppressor p53, a central transcriptional
  modulator at the intersection of DNA-damage control (yellow), apoptosis induction
  (green), and cell-cycle progression (purple). Note an overt degree of molecular
  symmetry between these output functions, which shows in (1) AKT-enforced nuclear
  entry of key components (i.e., MDM2 and SOX2), (2) corresponding transcriptional
  adaptations that modulate the expression of respective downstream effectors, (3)
  a mutual dependence on PI3K/AKT-regulated protein synthesis to translationally impose
  these expression changes, and finally (4) near-symmetric feedback regulatory relays
  to balance and adjust these output functions. These interrelations are of particular
  significance for stem cells, whose genome integrity is a functional imperative.
  In cancer, though, the indicated circuitry is frequently distorted by constitutively
  activating mutations in PI3K/AKT signaling and/or functional disruptions within
  DNA response elements that rank amongst the most prevalent transforming aberrations.
