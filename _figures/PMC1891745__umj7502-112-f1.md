caption: Diagram illustrating Functional JAK STAT PathwayThis “JAK STAT” pathway appears
  to be ubiquitous amongst vertebrates. Following ligand binding the activated JAK2
  protein catalyses tyrosine phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor
  and also leads to phospharylation of the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription
  (STATS).Phosphorylation of STAT leads to dimerisation via conserved Src homology
  2 (SH2) domains. Translocation of these dimers to the nucleus then occurs facilitated
  via Nucleoprotein Interactor 1 (NPI-1). Subsequent regulation of gene expression
  following interaction with DNA response elements occurs. This leads to a transcriptional
  response. There is also interaction with the RAS/MAPK, Pl-3 K and Akt downstream
  pathways.Under normal conditions the enhanced gene expression is under complex negative
  feedback mechanisms including amongst others the production of the negative regulator
  Suppressors of Cytokine Signalling (SOCS).
