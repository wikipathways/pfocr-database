caption: Figure 1. Schematic of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. (1)
  The extrinsic pathway is mediated by the ligation of TNF/CD95/Fas ligands to the
  membrane. This triggers the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)
  composed of FADD and pro-caspase 8. Caspase 8 activation occurs due to the induced
  proximity of pro-enzyme molecules. Caspase-8 also activates the pro-apoptotic protein
  Bid which feeds into the intrinsic pathway. (2) The intrinsic pathway is mediated
  primarily by the Bcl-2 super family. BH3 pro-apoptotic proteins inactivate Bcl-2
  pro-survival partners releasing Bax and Bak. Homo-oligomerization of Bax and Bak
  at the OMM results in the release of cytochrome c and the downstream activation
  of caspase-9 via a conformational change. Both pathways converge to activate the
  executioner caspases leading to cell death.
