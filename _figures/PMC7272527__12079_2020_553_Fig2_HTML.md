caption: HIF-Hypoxia signaling in skeletal muscle physiology and fibrosis. In normoxia,
  blood flows through vessels and capillaries (5 per muscle fiber on average) (Valle-Tenney,
  2019) allowing oxygen to reach the cells in the muscle tissue. In this condition,
  the HIF-α transcription factor is continuously hydroxylated by HIF-prolyl hydroxylases
  domain-containing enzymes (PHD). This mark is recognized by Von Hippel-Lindau E3
  ubiquitin-ligases and ubiquitinated for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. During exercise, oxygen consumption could exceed oxygen availability, in
  addition to vasoconstriction, decreased oxygen diffusion generates a hypoxic state
  where HIF-signaling is activated. In the hypoxic state, HIF-α is no longer hydroxylated
  and it accumulates and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to HIF-β to exert
  its function as a transcription factor. The same effect has been described for muscle
  regeneration where the skeletal muscle cell niche becomes hypoxic after injury by
  extravasation of capillaries and impaired blood flow through the tissue. In this
  context, HIF-signaling plays multiple roles including angiogenesis, myeloid cell
  activation and myogenesis by satellite cell proliferation. In situations of exercise
  and regeneration, normoxia is reestablished after a transient period of hypoxia.
  However, in chronic skeletal muscle pathologies the hypoxic state, in addition to
  repetitive damage and pro-fibrotic factors overexpression, elicits the establishment
  of fibrosis. In this condition, sustained HIF-activation in crosstalk with other
  pro-fibrotic pathways (TGF-β or Renin-Angiotensin system) could promote the overexpression
  of key profibrotic cytokines such as CCN2
