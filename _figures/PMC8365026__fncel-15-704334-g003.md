caption: ER stress-mediated inflammation pathway under cerebral ischemia. Under ischemic
  state, NF-κB is an essential pivot in the inflammation pathway induced by ER stress.
  NF-κB is controlled by the activation of AKT and suppression of inhibitory IκB proteins.
  NF-κB and TNF-α promote each other casing nausea cycle of inflammation response.
  In addition to NF-κB, the release of inflammatory factors induced by IRE1α-TRAF2-JNK
  axis is also a crux part of the injury mechanism in cerebral ischemia. Ca2+ overload
  from the ER through NOX2-dependent, subsequent activation of CaMKII and mitochondria
  pathway lead to the generation of ROS involving in inflammation response. Reactive
  microglia are mainly expressed as M1 pro-inflammatory type with Ca2+ overload after
  I/R injury.
