caption: 'Sufficient glucose and oxygen levels are required for mTORC1 activation,
  and many sensing mechanisms have been identified. Glucose, glutamine, and oxygen
  are utilized for ATP production via glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.
  Decreased availability of these nutrients can lower ATP levels, with a subsequent
  rise in AMP levels, conditions that stimulate the activation of AMPK. AMPK inhibits
  mTORC1 through activation of the TSC complex, which inhibits Rheb, and phosphorylation
  of Raptor within mTORC1. Glucose or oxygen deprivation, as well as other forms of
  energy stress, also stimulates the transcription of REDD1 through the action of
  either the HIF1, ATF4, or p53 transcription factors. REDD1 somehow cooperates with
  the TSC complex to inhibit Rheb and mTORC1. Through their sensing of AMP and oxygen,
  respectively, AMPK and the PHD proteins (in yellow) represent the only known direct
  sensors of cellular metabolic status within this network. In addition to energy
  stress, glucose and oxygen can also be sensed through ER homeostasis, as they are
  required for proper protein glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, respectively.
  Disrupting these processes results in activation of PERK and inhibition of eIF2a,
  which results in the selective translation of ATF4. Glucose starvation and energy
  stress also appear to signal to mTORC1 via the Rag GTPases, albeit through unknown
  mechanisms, and through a pathway involving the p38 and PRAK kinases leading to
  direct phosphorylation of Rheb. Severe states of ATP depletion inhibit the ability
  of the TTT-RUVBL1/2 complex to promote formation of functional mTORC1 dimers. Note:
  mTORC1 is depicted as a single unit at the lysosome for simplicity. Compounds such
  as 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), AICAR, and the biguanides metformin and phenformin also
  have inputs into these different mechanisms of mTORC1 inhibition. Dashed lines denote
  unknown molecular mechanisms.'
