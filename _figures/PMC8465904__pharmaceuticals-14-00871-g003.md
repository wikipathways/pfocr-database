caption: 'Extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathway and its regulation via p53. Under
  cellular stress, the extrinsic pathway is started by ligand binding to death receptors,
  including TNFα, Fas and TRAIL; this leads to the autoactivation of caspases-8 and
  -10, which in turn promote the catalytic activation of the effector caspase-3. Another
  target of caspase-8 is the pro-apoptotic protein Bid, which is hydrolyzed to tBid,
  inducing Bax oligomerization and mitochondria depolarization with release of cyt
  c. Along with the activation of caspase-9, these events amplify the apoptotic pathway.
  The intrinsic pathway involves the permeabilization of the mitochondrial external
  membrane, which facilitates the cytosolic release of pro-apoptotic proteins like
  SMAC/Diablo and cyt c, which are otherwise confined within the intermembrane space.
  cyt c binds the Apaf-1 protein, which in turn binds and activates caspase-9, responsible
  for the activation of apoptosis executioners: Caspases-3, -6, and -7. On the other
  hand, SMAC/Diablo inhibits IAPs, which bind and neutralize caspases-8 and -10. Another
  protein involved in apoptosis regulation is p53, which transcriptionally activates
  pro-apoptotic genes and inhibits anti-apoptotic genes, directly inhibiting BclXL
  and Bcl-2 in the mitochondria, favoring apoptosis. Continue arrows (↓) indicate
  activation, arrows with (⊥) indicate inhibition.'
