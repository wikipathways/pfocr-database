caption: 'Molecular mechanisms involved in glucosensing in the gastrointestinal tract.
  A: in enterocytes, transport of glucose occurs by SGLT-1, following the Na+ electrochemical
  potential gradient across the apical membrane until its intracellular concentration
  is sufficiently elevated. Glucose is transported outside of enterocytes by facilitated
  diffusion through GLUT-2, localized on the basolateral membrane of the cell. Saturation
  of SGLT-1, depending on the luminal glucose concentration, is associated with an
  increase of GLUT-2 translocation to the apical membrane. B: in brush cells, the
  glucose trafficking signal transduction pathway involves GLUT-2 transporters. This
  mechanism is coupled with TAS1R2/TAS1R3 sweet taste receptor activation that was
  described for taste buds. C: enteroendocrine cells (EEC) receive glucose stimulation
  via sweet taste receptor activation, as described below, but GLUT-2 also trigger
  the entry of glucose into the glycolytic pathway to generate ATP. This increase
  in ATP leads to closure of ATP sensitive potassium channels (KATP) channels, membrane
  depolarization, opening of Ca2+ channels, and release of hormones like glucose-dependent
  insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1); note that
  membrane depolarization can be induced by glucose itself. D: enteric neurons are
  glucosensitive: extracellular glucose removal leads to hyperpolarization and decreases
  in their membrane input resistance. The excitation of these neurons is mediated
  by inhibition of KATP channels or by SGLT-3. They can also be activated by gastrointestinal
  (GI) hormones secreted by EECs in response to glucose detection. Enteric neurons
  can activate neighboring neurons or transmit glycemic information to the brain via
  nervous afferents.'
