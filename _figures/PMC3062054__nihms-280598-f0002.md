caption: The major signaling pathways stimulated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
  and TGF-β receptors are shown schematically. Note that TGF-β can stimulate both
  the canonical pathway, and non-canonical pathways (not shown), including some components
  which are listed here under RTK. Activation of the phospholipid PI3K pathway may
  be achieved by binding of the regulatory p85 subunit to an activated RTK or through
  the activation of the small GTP-binding protein RAS. On activation, PI3K induces
  formation of phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-phosphate (PIP3), which serves as a docking
  site for proteins containing phospholipid-binding domains (e.g., PH domains), including
  protein kinase B and AKT. Recruitment of AKT to the membrane enables its phosphorylation
  on two stimulatory residues; one of these phosphorylation events (threonine-308)
  is mediated by PDK, whereas the other (serine-473) is mediated by mTorC2. PTEN and
  INPP4B are phophatases that abolish AKT activation and act as tumor suppressors.
  AKT has a large number of substrates that regulate mainly survival and metabolism.
  One example is the proapoptotic protein BAD, which is inhibited following phosphorylation
  by AKT. BAD induces permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane to enable release
  of cytochrome C. The latter is involved in the generation of a protein complex known
  as the apoptosome, which cleaves pro-caspases to generate the active form of caspase-9.
  The ERK pathway is a multiple layer kinase cascade, in which the most distal MAPK
  elements are activated on tyrosine/threonine phosphorylation. In the ERK1/2 kinase
  pathway, binding of a ligand to an RTK enables auto-phosphorylation and recruitment
  of adaptors like GRB2 and SHC. The adaptors mediate recruitment of a GTP/GDP exchange
  protein, SOS, which loads GTP onto RAS. Active, GTP-loaded RAS molecules stimulate
  RAF kinases, which instigate the cascade leading to MEK (MAPK kinase) and then to
  ERK activation. Active ERK molecules translocate to the nucleus to stimulate multiple
  transcription programs essential for cell cycle progression and cell migration.
  The phopholipase Cγ-protein kinase C (PKC) pathway is instigated on recruitment
  of PLCγ to ligand-bound receptors. The activated enzyme hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to form two second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and
  inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). Binding of IP3 to receptors on the membrane of
  the endoplasmic reticulum leads to Ca2+ release. Free cytosolic calcium ions, together
  with DAG, activate members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family, resulting in the
  phosphorylation of various effector proteins. In addition, cytosolic Ca2+ activates
  the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and phosphatases. The SMAD signaling
  pathway is the canonical signaling pathway of TGF-β family members. TGF-β dimers
  bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor.
  The type I receptor then recruits and phosphorylates a receptor-regulated SMAD (R-SMAD).
  R-SMAD then binds to the common SMAD (SMAD4) to form a heterodimeric complex. This
  complex then translocates into the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor.
