caption: VEGF secreted by tumor cells promotes neovascularization via downstream pathways
  including the MAPK signaling pathway, FAK pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, and p38 MAP
  kinase pathway, it also directly promotes tumor cell proliferation. IP3 pathway
  and VEGF-induced immune escape might be involved in invasiveness of the pituitary
  adenoma.
