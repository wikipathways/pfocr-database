caption: 'Microbial stimulation of inhibitory checkpoints modulates the tumor immune
  microenvironment. Fusobacterium nucleatum inhibits the activity of natural killer
  cells and cytotoxic T cells via interaction between Fap2 and TIGIT or CEACAM1. Helicobacter
  pylori acts on CEACAM1 through its outer membrane protein HopQ protein to inhibit
  immune cells. Bifidobacterium upregulates the expression of IFN-I in dendritic cells
  through the STING signaling pathway, thereby promoting antigen cross-presentation
  and T cell activation to enhance the efficacy of CD47 blockade. Abbreviations: STING = the
  stimulator of interferon gene'
