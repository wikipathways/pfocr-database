caption: 'Eicosanoid synthesis pathways: Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty
  acid that is released from the cellular membranes by cytoplasmatic phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2). Free arachidonic acid can be metabolized to eicosanoids through two major
  pathways: the cyclooxygenase (COX) and the lipooxygenase (LOX). The COX-1 (constitutive
  form) pathway results in the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, which
  are important for physiological functions. The COX-2 (inducible form) pathway plays
  a crucial rule in the production and release of inflammatory prostaglandins. Similarly,
  the LOX pathway leads to the synthesis of leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid (HETE) that contribute to the inflammatory process. Different studies have
  associated the flavonoid anti-inflammatory effect with a suppression of these pathways.'
