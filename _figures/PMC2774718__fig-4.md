caption: Downstream effects of Ras glutathionylation in response to endogenous H2O2
  production. Two independent modes of Ras activation by glutathionylation are depicted
  here. On the left is shown how Ras-dependent and -independent pathways contribute
  to angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy in vascular smooth muscle cells (Adachi et
  al., 2004), namely (1) coupling of angiotensin II receptor activation to production
  of ROS by NADPH oxidase, followed by Ras glutathionylation and activation of Akt
  and p38, and (2) ROS-independent transactivation of EGFR and activation of the ERK
  signaling pathway. The right-hand scheme depicts a mechanism by which Ras-SSG mediates
  the hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes to mechanical strain. Strain-stimulated
  cardiac myocytes exhibit ROS-dependent Ras glutathionylation, which activates the
  ERK pathway and results in increased protein synthesis. The basis for activation
  of Akt and p38 (left) vs. ERK (right) pathways by the same signaling intermediate
  (i.e., Ras-SSG) is not yet understood.
