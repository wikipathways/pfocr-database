caption: Highlights of key changes in cell cycle, differentiation, and metabolism-related
  transcripts. (A) Representative steps from pathways involved in cell cycle regulation
  and myogenesis. Significantly underexpressed (in red) and overexpressed (in green)
  genes were identified by using fold and t test analysis (Table 3). The CCND2/CDK4
  pathway seems to be overall promoted, whereas the c-Fos and c-Jun pathways appear
  inhibited at the transcriptional level. Myogenesis-related genes are underexpressed.
  (B) Overall underexpression of key enzymes from the glucose and glycogen metabolic
  pathways (Table 3).
