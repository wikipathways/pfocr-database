caption: Signaling pathways in TCSCs. (A) Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. KDM1A demethylates
  APC2 and DKK1, triggers Wnt signaling, starts the transcription of downstream target
  genes, and raises expression of stemness marker proteins. GSK-LSD1 effectively blocked
  KDM1A’s demethylation, preventing the abnormal stimulation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. (B) Notch signaling pathway. The ligand attaches itself to the Notch extracellular
  receptor, releasing the Notch intracellular structural domain (NICD). This NICD
  enters the nucleus and interacts with the CSL to control the expression of target
  genes downstream. Crenigacestat efficiently prevents TCSCs-driven tumor growth in
  vivo by reducing aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and blocking the Notch1-cMYC signaling
  pathway, which prevents the development of tumor balls. (C) Hippo signaling pathway.
  The Hh ligand attaches to the extracellular structural domain of PTCH upon activation
  of Hh signaling, blocking the receptor and removing its inhibitory action on SMO.
  Gli proteins can be dephosphorylated and transformed into their active state when
  Sufu’s function is inhibited by Smo. Target genes (like Snail) are expressed more
  when activated Gli1 enters the nucleus. By inhibiting Gli1, GANT61 suppresses the
  Shh pathway, delaying the formation of tumors fueled by TCSCs. (D) JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway. The cytokines control target gene transcription by binding to membrane
  receptors, activating JAKs, and mediating STAT phosphorylation into the nucleus.
  Through their targeting of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, curcumin and cucurbitacin
  suppressed the expression of stemness genes and the tumor-promoting potential of
  TCSCs. (E) PI3K/AKT-SOX2 signaling. Diallyl trisulphide inhibited the tumorigenic
  ability of TCSCs by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, reducing the phosphorylation
  level of AKT and downstream SOX2 expression
