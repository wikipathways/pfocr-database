caption: 'Study workflow: Four differential microbial strains were found in the fecal
  microbiota of Laiwu pigs and Lulai black pigs. Multiple differential metabolites
  were found in the blood of the two breeds, with tanshinone IIA and royal jelly acid
  being proven to have anti-adipogenic functions. Correlation analysis revealed that
  E. siraeum was strongly positively correlated with these anti-adipogenic metabolites,
  leading to its selection as the target microbe for further functional studies. Gene
  analysis of E. siraeum showed its involvement in 161 signaling pathways, including
  the insulin signaling pathway and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Further investigation
  of the metabolites secreted by E. siraeum revealed their involvement in pathways
  such as fatty acid degradation. Gavage of high-fat diet mice with E. siraeum metabolites
  resulted in reduced body weight, white adipocyte size, insulin, leptin, and IL-6
  secretion, along with an increase in brown fat cells. Overall, E. siraeum effectively
  inhibits fat deposition in mice through multiple mechanisms'
