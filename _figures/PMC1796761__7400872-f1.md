caption: Pathway of double-stranded break repair by homologous recombination and the
  factors involved. Recombination is initiated by nucleolytic processing of the DSB
  to generate 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhangs that rapidly complex with RPA.
  Rad51 recruitment displaces RPA leading to the formation of a helical nucleoprotein
  filament with ssDNA, which can search for an intact homologous template and then
  catalyse invasion of the ssDNA into a donor sister chromatid or homologous chromosome
  to form a joint molecule. The resulting joint molecule acts as a primer for DNA
  synthesis to extend the heteroduplex DNA, which, following further processing and
  resolution of the joint DNA molecules, leads to repair of the DSB and restoration
  of DNA integrity. BIR, break-induced replication; BRCA2, breast cancer 2; BLM–TopoIIIα,
