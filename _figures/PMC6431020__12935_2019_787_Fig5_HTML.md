caption: Schematic diagram of molecular mechanisms underlying PA-induced GC metastasis.
  Schematic diagram shows that PA enters into GC cell, activates FABP5 and promotes
  its nuclear transport, which then increases GC cell nuclear protein level of SP1.
  Consequently, the cellular levels of UCA1 is elevated and both the GC cell migratory
  and invasion properties are improved
