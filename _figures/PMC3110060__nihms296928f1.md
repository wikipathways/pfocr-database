caption: Cells progressing to senescence acquire several prominent phenotypes and
  the levels of many proteins governing each of these phenotypes are influenced by
  senescence-associated miRNAs. As shown in the light gray boxes, senescent cells
  have elevated levels of p53 (subject to negative regulation by MCM5, a protein repressed
  by miR-885-5p), which transcriptionally upregulates miR-34 expression; in turn,
  miR-34 represses the levels of several proliferative proteins (E2F, c-Myc, cyclins
  and cdks) and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, SIRT1). Senescent cells also have
  active (hypophosphorylated) RB, resulting from elevated levels of two potent inhibitors
  of cdks (the RB kinases), p21 (upregulated in part via p53) and p16; a number of
  miRNAs that reduce p21 and p16 abundance have been reported. Senescence cell-specific
  gene expression programs are controlled via changes in proteins that modulate gene
  transcription (via promoter elements or chromatin remodeling) like Bmi-1, HMGA2,
  RARγ, and B-Myb, and proteins that affect gene expression post-transcriptionally
  like the splicing factor ASF/SF2 and the mRNA-stabilizer and translation regulator
  HuR; each of these proteins is also subject to control by senescence-associated
  miRNAs and some of them in turn cross-talk with the p53/p21 pathway (HMGA2 represses
  p21 transcription) and with the p16/RB pathway (Bmi-1 represses p16 transcription).
  Importantly, not only are we learning how miRNAs affect senescence, but we are also
  discovering how senescence factors directly modulate the expression of miRNAs; for
  example, p53 transcriptionally upregulates miR-34 and RB transcriptionally upregulates
  miR-29/miR-30. In addition, senescent cells also secrete a distinctive subset of
  proteins, a feature known as SASP; secretion of some of these factors (e.g., IL-6
  and IL-8) is under control of IRAK1, a protein whose levels are reduced by the senescence-associated
  miR-146. Factors secreted through the SASP, as well as lower integrin β1 activity
  resulting from higher miR-183 affect ECM function.These pathways and regulatory
  processes influence key aspects of the senescence phenotype (dark gray). Major downstream
  consequences of activation of p53/p21 and p16/RB and gene regulatory factors are
  the inhibition of the cell division machinery and the implementation of senescence-associated
  gene expression patterns. The p53/p21 and p16/RB pathways elicit cell responses
  to cell damage by genotoxins and oxidants. The main consequences of the SASP are
  the secretion of factors that cause inflammation and compromise the integrity of
  the ECM.
