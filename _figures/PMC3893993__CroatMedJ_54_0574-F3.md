caption: RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Extracellular ligand
  such as growth factor (GF) binds to GF receptor and activates cytoplasmatic part
  of the receptor (a tyrosine kinase), which by phosphorylation enables binding with
  docking proteins such as GRB2. This protein forms a complex with sons of sevenless
  (SOS) guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activates it. Activated SOS removes
  guanosine diphosphate from RAS protein and activates it. Activated RAS protein then
  activates rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) kinase, and RAF kinase subsequently
  activates MEK kinase (mitogen-activated protein [MAP] kinase kinase). MEK kinase
  finally activates mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK, also known as extracellular
  signal regulated kinase. Mutations in genes controlling production of these signaling
  proteins, causing Noonan syndrome, are indicated (PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, NRAS, SHOC2,
  RAF1, BRAF, MEK1).
