caption: Schematic diagram of signaling microdomain for specific PIP2 signal. Stimulation
  of M2AChR/GIRK pathway and ETAR induce the recruitments of each component to Cav-3,
  which allow ETAR to interact with GIRK channels (upper). In contrast, B2R are dissociated
  from Cav-3 during B2R stimulation. By losing scaffolding network, they cannot interact
  with GIRK channel complexes any more (lower).
