caption: Mitochondrial involvement in fibromyalgia syndrome. A schematic diagram representing
  the important role of mitochondria in normal and in FMS underlining the biosynthetic
  pathway mediated by PGC-1α. The decrease of PGC-1α expression induces downregulation
  of Mfn2 that, in turn, determined a decrease of CoQ10 expression in the inner of
  mitochondrial membrane. In mitochondria CoQ10 is a part of electron transport chain
  among several complexes likely to cytochrome C on the complex IV. It is also depicted
  the potential beneficial effects of melatonin in RIM rats and so, its role in the
  maintenance of health. Mfn2 = mitofusin2; PGC-1α = peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha; ROS = reactive oxygen species; CoQ10 = coenzyme
  Q10; Cyt c = cytochrome complex; RIM rats = reserpine-induced myalgic rats; F0 =
  “Fraction 0” of the ATPase; it is a proton pore that is embedded in the mitochondrial
  membrane; F1 = “Fraction 1” of the ATPase; it is the portion responsible for hydrolyzing
  ATP; ADP = adenosine diphosphate; Pi= inorganic phosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate.
