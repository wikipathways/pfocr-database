caption: TNF-α signaling pathway based on 14-3-3γ protein function. As mentioned in
  the text, exposure to TNF-α can lead to overexpression of 14-3-3γ protein in MCF-7/MX
  cells. This protein interacts with many proteins such as PKC and p53. 14-3-3γ acts
  as an inhibitor for PKC activity leading to blocking of PHB phosphorylation. Inhibition
  of PHB phosphorylation elevates mitochondrial permeability and facilitates regulated
  cell death procedures. 14-3-3γ also elevates stability and activity of p53 via inhibition
  of AKT phosphorylation which might be another mechanism connecting 14-3-3γ to cytotoxic
  effects of TNF-α in MCF-7/MX cells

  rates of cell death in mitoxantrone-resistant breast cancer cells MCF-7/MX exposed
  to TNF-α.
