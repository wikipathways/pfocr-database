caption: In silico analysis of the genetic networks directly involved in Notch and
  Wnt signaling suggest overlap and direct crosstalk via Notch target gene activation
  through canonical Wnt signaling. By means of MatInspector,  gene promoters in the
  Notch pathway were found to contain at least one putative LEF-1/TCF-site (number
  of sites in per gene is described in square brackets). Genes in gray boxes were
  subjected for further semi quantitative RT-PCR analysis.
