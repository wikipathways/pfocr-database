caption: A simplified illustration of YAP/TAZ and glycolysis. (a). Glycolysis upregulates
  the activity of PFK1 (phosphofructokinase) to promote YAP/TAZ transcriptional cooperation
  with TEAD factors, and form a PFK1-TEAD1-YAP/TAZ complex in cells nucleus. (b).
  Glycolysis activates YAP through the HBP (hexosamine biosynthesis pathway). YAP
  is O-GlcNAcylated by OGT (O-linked b-N-acetylglucosamine transferase). O-GlcNAcylation
  of YAP promotes its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. (c). MG
  (Methylglyoxal), a side-product of glycolysis, promotes YAP transcriptional cooperation
  with TEAD factors by reducing the binding of HSP90 and LATS1 and inhibiting LATS1
  activity. (d). YAP-TEAD binds with the GLUT3 promoter to directly regulate the transcription
  of GLUT3 and then promotes glycolysis in tumor cells. (e). FOXC2 (forkhead box protein
  C2) interacts with YAP and TEAD in cells nucleus to activate YAP, and then the activation
  of YAP upregulates the expression of HK2 to promote cells glycolysis. (f) YAP-TEAD
  directly binds with the two site (GGAATT/GGAATC) in the promoter region of lncRNA
  BCAR4 to upregulate the expression and transcriptional activity of HK2 and PFKFB3
  to promote cells glycolysis
