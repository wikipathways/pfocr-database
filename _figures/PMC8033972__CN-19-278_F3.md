caption: 'The biased agonism is ligand-dependent selective activation of FPR2/ALX
  to interact with many structurally diverse agents. The binding of both pro-resolving
  ligands, including endogenous: lipoxin A4 (LXA4), 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (AT-LXA4) or
  new synthetic (e.g., MR39, BML-111, MMK-1) as well as pro-inflammatory: serum amyloid
  A (SAA), amyloid β (Aβ) or prion protein (PrP) to FPR2/ALX induces contrasting effects
  on inflammatory pathway activation and immune response. The biased signalling can
  provide a new method for shifting pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory pathways
  and in this way improve efficiency of RoI. (A higher resolution / colour version
  of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article).'
