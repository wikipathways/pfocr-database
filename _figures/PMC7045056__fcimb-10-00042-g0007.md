caption: 'Interaction networks of top score canonical pathways and transcripts affected
  in FFPE tissue samples from meningococcal septic shock patients. The interaction
  networks in lungs (A), heart (B), kidneys (C), liver (D), and spleen (E) are generated
  through the use of IPA ≪core analysis≫. In addition, ≪Canonical Pathways Analysis≫
  was performed to determine genes that were involved in well-documented canonical
  signal transduction or metabolic pathways, from the library of canonical pathways
  in IPA. Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for multiple testing corrections was performed.
  Significantly enriched genes in the dataset were overlayed into the specific canonical
  pathway. The analysis was performed in silico using Molecular Activity Predictor
  analysis of IPA. The shapes represent the molecular classes of the ≪gene≫. In the
  figures, red represents upregulation and green down-regulation, and color intensity
  represents the relative magnitude of change in gene expression. Gray color indicates
  no activity pattern available. Direct and indirect interactions are indicated by
  solid and dashed lines, respectively. The network diagram shows the biological relationship
  between the indicated genes lines: — represents direct physical interactions; —–
  represents indirect functional interactions; → represents activation; ⊣ represents
  inhibition. The blue lines indicate that the direction of regulation is consistent
  with IPA prediction. In contrast, yellow lines indicate that the regulation observed
  is inconsistent with expectations, while gray lines indicate lack of pre-existing
  data to formulate expectations. Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent
  the functional class of the genes.'
