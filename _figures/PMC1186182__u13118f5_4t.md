caption: d4E-BP is an important downstream effector of the dFOXO phenotype. Under
  oxidative stress, dFOXO becomes dephosphorylated, and enters the nucleus to activate
  d4E-BP transcription. Amino acid starvation inhibits the dTOR pathway in the larval
  fat body, which results in suppression of the Inr/PI3K pathway in peripheral tissues.
  This affects d4E-BP regulation in two ways. First, suppression of Inr/PI3K signaling
  leads to inactivation of dAkt. Consequently, dAkt cannot phosphorylate dFOXO, resulting
  in enhanced transport of dFOXO to the nucleus and transcriptional activation of
  d4E-BP. Also, the d4E-BP kinase dTOR is a downstream target of the PI3K pathway.
  Under starvation, dTOR is inactive, such that d4E-BP does not become phosphorylated,
  and can interact with eIF4E. Thus, amino acid starvation increases both the protein
  level and activity of d4E-BP, which results in repression of cap-dependent translation.
papertitle: Starvation and oxidative stress resistance in Drosophila are mediated
  through the eIF4E-binding protein, d4E-BP.
