caption: Cancer–immunity cycle. During cancer development, cancer cells die. Antigen
  presenting cells (APCs) within the tumors engulf dead cancer cells and/or their
  corresponding particles. APCs process engulfed materials into smaller peptides to
  be presented on their surface carried on major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
  molecules. Those APCs migrate through the lymphatics to secondary lymphoid organs
  and activate antigen-specific- naive T cells. Then, active T cells travel through
  blood vessels to infiltrate into the tumor. Intratumoral effector T cells can recognize
  tumor antigens on the surface of cancer cells and kill them, resulting in the release
  of more antigens. Cytotoxic T cells kill their cellular targets via either the death
  receptor pathway or the granule exocytosis pathway. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER);
  T-cell receptor (TCR); transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP).
