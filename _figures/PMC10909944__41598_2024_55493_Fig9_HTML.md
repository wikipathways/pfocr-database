caption: The mechanistic schematic model of action of circRNA_SLC8A1 in macrophages
  against Mtb infection. Briefly, circRNA_SLC8A1 sponged miR‐20b‐5p to upregulate
  SQSTM1/p62 expression, further activating the NF-κB signaling pathway to inhibit
  macrophage apoptosis and promote Mtb survival in macrophages
papertitle: circRNA_SLC8A1 promotes the survival of mycobacterium tuberculosis in
  macrophages by upregulating expression of autophagy-related protein SQSTM1/p62 to
  activate the NF-κB pathway
