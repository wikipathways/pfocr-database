caption: The insulin signaling pathway in normal and AD conditions. A Under physiological
  conditions, the PI3K/Akt signaling axis is activated upon interaction of insulin
  (Ins.) to insulin receptor (Ins. R) and phosphorylation of IRS-1. It not only prevents
  the activity of GSK-3β which in turn inhibits Tau phosphorylation but also alters
  the balance ratio between pro- and anti-apoptosis-related genes in favor of cell
  survival. B In AD, Aβ oligomers cause elimination of Ins. R from the surface of
  the neuron and reorganize them to the cell bodies. Aβ-derived diffusible ligands
  (ADDLs) also cause downregulation of Ins. R. The abatement in brain insulin signaling
  rises the activity of GSK-3β, which escalates aberrant Tau phosphorylation. On the
  other hand, Aβ oligomers can directly hinder the PI3K activity which consequently
  decreases the expression level of Akt that leads to upregulation of pro-apoptotic
  genes coupled with the downregulation of anti-apoptotic genes, an event which eventually
  gives rise to caspase-3-dependent neuron cell death and neurodegeneration
