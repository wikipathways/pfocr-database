caption: (A) Summary of the experimental setup.(B) Schematic integration of metabolomics
  results on HSCs+MPP1 and MPPs. Quantification is depicted as fold change (FC) +
  SD relative to HSCs+MPP1. Metabolite names and dots (upregulated in HSCs+MPP1)are
  shown in red (upregulated in MPPs) and blue. RNA-seq expression data of enzymes
  (padj. < 0.1) are shown as colored lines (red, upregulated in HSCs; blue, upregulated
  in MPPs; see also ). n = 6–12; two to three independent experiments per metabolite;
  unpaired Student’s t test; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.(C) GSEA of selected
  Reactome pathways on RNA-seq data enriched in HSCs and MPPs (n = 3).(D) GSEA of
  selected Reactome pathways on ranked differential OCRs between HSCs and MPPs in
  ATAC-seq.(E) Gene tracks of the Cyp26b1 locus with corresponding RNA-seq, ATAC-seq,
  and H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq coverage files.(F) MTE plots integrating metabolomics,
  RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data on selected KEGG pathways.
  Depicted is log2FC between HSCs(+MPP1) and MPPs (red, upregulated in HSCs; blue,
  upregulated in MPPs). Significance was calculated using an unpaired Student’s t
  test (metabolomics dataset; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001) or by DESeq2 padj.
  value (sequencing datasets; *p < 0.1, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.01).Inner circles indicate
  the average tendencies of the entire KEGG pathway per dataset, and outer circles
  show individual genes/metabolites. n indicates the number of biological replicates.
