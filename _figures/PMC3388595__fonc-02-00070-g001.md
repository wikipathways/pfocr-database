caption: 'Cytochrome c and mitochondrial dysfunction in AA-PCD pathways. At extracellular
  acidic pH values acetic acid enters yeast cells and dissociates into acetate and
  protons causing intracellular acidification. In NAC-sensitive AA-PCD (red dashed
  arrows) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulates early, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity
  increases, while catalase activity is undetectable; cyt c is released to the cytosol
  in a YCA1-dependent manner as a functional protein, acting as an electron donor
  (cred) to the electron transport chain and as a superoxide anion (O2-.) scavenger;
  in a late phase, mitochondrial functions progressively decline, as revealed by a
  decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), respiratory control index (RCI),
  and cyt c oxidase (COX) activity. Caspase-like activity increases and DNA fragmentation
  occurs. The NAC-insensitive (blue dashed arrows) AA-PCD takes place in a YCA1-independent
  manner without cyt c release, yet caspase-like activation and DNA fragmentation
  occur in a late phase. In cells expressing a catalytically inactive form of iso-1-cyt
  c (CW65S; green dashed arrows), no release of mutant cyt c occurs with inhibition
  of AA-PCD, and there is a decrease in H2O2 production. Possible involvement of certain
  signaling pathways in the interplay between PCD and cell adaptation is also shown:
  intracellular acidification caused by AA-PCD induction may stimulate RAS–cAMP–PKA
  signaling pathway, causing mitochondrial dysfunction, which can activate retrograde
  (RTG) pathway. The RTG pathway is positively and negatively regulated by Ras and
  TOR pathways, respectively. The TOR pathway is found at the crossroad of AA-PCD
  and RTG signaling, which may play a role in AA-PCD resistance.'
