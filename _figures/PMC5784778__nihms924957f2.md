caption: 'Summary: the hypoxia-adenosine link during intestinal inflammation and disease.Inflamed
  tissues often become severely hypoxic, whereas tissue hypoxia can lead to tissue
  inflammation. HIFs are stabilized in these conditions, binding hypoxia-response
  elements (HREs) in target genes. Adenosine signaling pathway genes are direct gene
  targets of hypoxia/HIFs. In general, HIF-1α-mediated increase of adenosine signaling
  is tissue protective (e.g., IBD and intestinal I/R injury), whereas in cancer, HIFs
  may target extracellular adenosine/adenosine signaling genes to promote tumorigenesis.
  Boxes: Lower right: Inflammation alters tissue metabolism, reducing the supply of
  nutrients and oxygen to tissues. In turn, inflamed tissues become profoundly hypoxic.
  Middle right: Hypoxia signaling. Both proline hydroxylases (PHDs) and asparaginyl
  hydroxylase factor inhibiting HIF (FIH; indicated as asparagine hydroxylase) serve
  an important role as oxygen sensors, controlling the activity of HIFs. In normoxia,
  HIFs are rapidly targeted for degradation by proline hydroxylase (PHDs) and von
  Hippel-Lindau (VHL; not shown), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In hypoxia, HIF-α is stabilized.
  Oxygen is an essential co-factor of PHDs and asparagine hydroxylase. HIFs (α and
  β subunits) translocate to the nucleus and dimerize, binding to HREs of target genes.
  Top right: Adenosine signaling. Multiple adenosine pathway genes are targets of
  hypoxia/HIFs. The increased release of ATP/ADP to the cell surface and hypoxia/HIF-mediated
  regulation of extracellular adenosine pathway genes (see . for details) together
  enhance adenosine signaling.'
