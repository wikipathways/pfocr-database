caption: Schematic representation of UV-B mediated control of flowering time (factors
  and flowering pathways involved). Upon UV-B irradiation multiple flowering pathways
  control flowering time. The age and autonomous pathways lead to an upregulation
  of FLC [as demonstrated by ], which acts as an FT repressor. CO and FT are flowering
  promoting factors of the photoperiodic pathway. CO is repressed by RUP2, a negative
  regulator of UVR8 signaling [as demonstrated by ] and a circadian clock component.
  ELF3, another circadian clock component also represses FT, indirectly by targeting
  CO for degradation. UVR8 represses ELF3 and possibly interacts with another protein
  factor (P) in order to promote FT gene expression.
