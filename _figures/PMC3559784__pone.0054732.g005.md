caption: The adult C. sinensis worm makes full use of bile fatty acids, sugars and
  amino acids as energy sources. All genes present in the citrate cycle and oxidative
  phosphorylation pathways were highly expressed, implying that the adult worm could
  obtain large amounts ATPs from aerobic respiration. (A) Fatty acid elongation. (B)
  Fatty acid metabolism. (C) Citrate cycle (TCA cycle). (D) Acetate:succinate cycle.
  (E) Fumarate reduction pathway. (F) Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis. (G) Amino acid metabolism
  related to energy metabolism. (H) Oxidative phosphorylation.
