caption: '(A) A simplified model for carbon dioxide and abscisic acid (ABA) signal
  transduction pathways in guard cells that mediate stomatal closure. The current
  model involves the enzymatic function of the carbonic anhydrases CA1 and CA4 with
  bicarbonate ions as intermediary signaling molecule. Downstream calcium, protein
  kinases, and ion channels are required for the stomatal closure response to CO2.
  Note that amplifying signals from the mesophyll [, ] are not shown here for simplicity
  (see text for details). Different pathway components are color-coded for ease of
  viewing: ABA genes = green; CO2 genes = brown; kinases = purple; channels = blue.
  Abbreviations: ABA = Abscisic acid; PYR/RCAR = ABA receptors; CO2 = carbon dioxide;
  CA = carbonic anhydrase; HCO3− = bicarbonate Ca = calcium; ABI1 = protein phosphatase
  2C. (B) The rate of cytosolic calcium transient production in guard cells of the
  Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 ecotype are not significantly modulated by the CO2 concentration,
  in contrast to the Ler ecotype. Cytosolic calcium transients in guard cells pre-exposed
  to low CO2, switched to high CO2, then returned to low CO2, at the indicated concentrations.
  Buffer composition was 10 mM KCl/50 mM CaCl2/10 mM Mes·Tris, pH 6.15. Data are the
  means of n=27 guard cells ±SE.'
