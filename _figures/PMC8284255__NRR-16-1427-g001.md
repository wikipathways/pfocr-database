caption: 'Molecular mechanism of N4-acetylcytidine continuously activating NLRP3 inflammasome
  by HMGB1 pathway in microglia.HMGB1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis
  of AD. N4A may first initiate the NLRP3 inflammasome, and induce the expression
  of NLRP3 and HMGB1 through signal 1, and then N4A-induced HMGB1 as signal 2 to promote
  the assembly and subsequent activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. N4A-mediated HMGB1
  release was dependent on NLRP3 inflflammasome. A2AR: Adenosine A2A receptor; AD:
  Alzheimer’s disease; ASC: apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment
  domain; HMGB1: high mobility group protein B1; NLRP3: nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain-like receptor protein 3.'
