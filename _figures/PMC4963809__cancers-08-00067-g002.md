caption: A schematic illustration of the canonical Wnt signal transduction cascade.
  Panel (A), in the absence of Wnt ligand, a destruction complex consisting of AXIN,
  APC, GSK3-β and CK1 resides in the cytosol. β-catenin is phosphorylated by CK1 and
  GSK3-β and targeted for degradation by the proteosomal machinery; Panel (B), with
  Wnt stimulation, some components of protein complex dislocate from the cytosol to
  the plasma membrane. The destruction complex falls apart and β-catenin is stabilized.
  Dvl is also recruited to the membrane and binds to Fz and Axin which is bound to
  phosphorylated LRP5/6. Stablized β-catenin is translocated to the nucleus where
  it associates to LEF/TCF transcription factors, displacing co-repressor TLE and
  recruiting additional co-activators to Wnt target genes. The activated Wnt pathway
  is associated to meningioma.
