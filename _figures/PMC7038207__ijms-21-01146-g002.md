caption: Connexin hemichannels in mechanotransduction of osteocytes. During FFSS,
  mechanical forces sensed by osteocytic dendrites are transduced through integrins,
  αvβ3 and α5β1 (①). αvβ3 integrins induce the fast activation of Panx1/P2XR (purinergic
  receptor) channels and an increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which propagates
  as a Ca2+ wave (②). Moreover, αvβ3 integrin induces the activation of focal adhesion
  kinases, known activators of signal transduction pathways (③). Mechanical loading
  activates the AKT pathway (④), which promotes the opening of Cx43 hemichannels (⑤)
  and stabilizes Cx43/α5β1 integrin/14-3-3θ complex, and 14-3-3θ (⑥) facilities the
  translocation of Cx43 and α5β1 integrin to the cell surface (⑦). The opening of
  hemichannels leads to a release of factors that promote bone formation and osteocyte
  survival signaling. For example, PGE2 released by Cx43 hemichannels activates EP2/4
  (prostaglandin receptor) that induces the activation of PI3K singling pathway (⑧),
  which leads to inhibition of GSK3β (⑨), allowing the accumulation of β-catenin required
  to modulate bone remodeling genes, such as OPG, RANKL and Sost (⑩). Moreover, EP2/4
  activates the ERK signaling pathway and through direct protein phosphorylation of
  Cx43, promotes the closure of hemichannels (⑧).
