caption: 'Immune deficiency (IMD) pathway members in malacostracans. a PGRPs recognises
  Gram-negative bacteria and activate the IMD pathway through the RHIM motifs. Although
  the IMD pathway is typically activated by PGRPs in Drosophila melanogaster, PGRPs
  are not necessary for IMD signalling and it was posited that an unknown protein
  is present upstream of the IMD signalling cascade. Like DIF from the Toll pathway,
  in the IMD pathway, differential activation of another NF-κB transcription factor,
  Relish, occurs. Relish is phosphorylated through the activation of IκB kinase (IKK)
  complexes and transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). The caspase-8
  homolog death-related ced-3/Nedd2-like protein (DREDD) and FAS-associated death
  domain (FADD) proteins are required for IKK and TAK1 activation and Relish is cleaved
  through DREDD. Caspar, a homologue of mammalian Fas-associating factor 1 that is
  essential for antifungal immunity, negatively regulates the IMD-mediated immune
  response by preventing nuclear translocation of Relish. Caspar also suppresses the
  IMD pathway through targeting Dredd-dependent cleavage of Relish. Phylogenetic trees
  of b IMD, c Caspar, d Relish and e DREDD are constructed using the maximum-likelihood
  method from an amino acid multiple sequence alignment. Taxa labels are depicted
  as their respective colour codes. Bootstrap support values (n = 1000) for all trees
  can be found in Additional file : Figure S14. Scale bar represents substitution
  per site'
