caption: 'A schema summarizing the protective effects of duodenal jejunal bypass surgery
  on hypothalamic cell injury induced by diabetes. Duodenal jejunal bypass (DJB) surgery
  significantly reduces hypothalamic oxidative stress injury and inflammation in type
  2 diabetes mellitus rats by a mechanism depending on glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-mediated
  activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. DJB therapy effectively inhibits hypothalamic
  oxidative stress and inflammatory damage caused by diabetes by GlP-1-mediated activation
  of Nrf2/HO-1 to inhibit oxidative stress damage in the hypothalamus. In addition,
  DJB inhibits inflammation by upregulating Nrf2 expression, activating the Nrf2/HO-1
  axis, and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. T2DM: Type 2 diabetes mellitus; DJB: Duodenal
  jejunal bypass; GLP-1: Glucagon-like peptide 1; GLP-1R: Glucagon-like peptide 1
  receptor; IL: Interleukin'
