caption: 'Model of RV infection and pathogenesis: virus entry, formation of viroplasms
  and replication, and release of virions and viral proteins such as NSP4; this protein
  mobilizes intracellular calcium from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Released NSP4 affects
  uninfected cells, resulting in mobilization of intracellular calcium by a PLC-dependent
  pathway that activates chloride secretion. Tight junctions can also be disrupted
  by RV infection and by the NSP4 activity; the disruption of epithelial cell structure
  may lead to cell death and alterations of the paracellular pathway of fluid movement.
  RV infection activates epithelial cell signaling resulting in the activation of
  the enteric nervous system, intestinal secretion, and immune responses (Estes and
  Greenberg ; Ramig )'
