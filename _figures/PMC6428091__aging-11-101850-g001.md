caption: 'Cytosolic glucose enters glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways. Pyruvate
  enters mitochondria where it is converted into acetyl-CoA then used in TCA cycle.
  Excess citrate is transported from the mitochondria into cytosol. ATP citrate lyase
  (ACL) converts the cytosolic citrate into acetyl-CoA that is converted into malonyl-CoA
  by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the first committing step of fatty acid (FA) synthesis.
  After FA synthesis, triacylglycerol (TAG) is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) via Kennedy pathway and then accumulated in lipid bodies (LB). Acyl-CoA is
  used for acylation of glycerol-3- phosphate to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)
  that is further acylated to form phosphatidicacid (PA). PA is dephosphorylated to
  form diacylglycerol (DAG), which is then acylated to produce TAG catalyzed by DAG
  acyltransferase (DGAT). TAG can also be synthesized by phospholipid (PL):DAG acyltransferase
  (PDAT) using PL and DAG as substrates. Ex novo FA accumulation also uses Kennedy
  pathway. FA is metabolized by β- oxidation pathway in peroxisome. Abbreviations:
