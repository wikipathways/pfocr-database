caption: Regulation of cell cycle progression by calcineurin and CaMK. CaN dephosphorylates
  the NFAT transcription factor, which in turn activates p21, cyclin D1, CDK4, c-myc,
  and cyclin A. CaN also stabilizes cyclin D1 by dephosphorylation. Furthermore, the
  CaN/NFAT pathway and its downstream target c-myc regulate p21. p21 is a well-known
  inhibitor of CDK2-cyclin E and CDK4/6-cyclin D. CaMK negatively regulates the expression
  of p27, which is an inhibitor of CDK4-cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E. CDK2-cyclin E
  and CDK4/6-cyclin D complexes phosphorylate Rb, leading to the activation of E2F1
  and the subsequent G1/S progression. In G2/M, CaMK phosphorylates and activates
  cdc25, leading to downstream dephosphorylation and the activation of CDK1. Solid
  red lines indicate phosphorylation, red dotted lines indicate dephosphorylation,
  and green dotted lines indicate transcriptional activation.
