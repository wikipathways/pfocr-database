caption: Microglia impact neuronal homeostasis and function. Figure illustrating microglia‐neuron
  crosstalk in the CNS. Microglia sense their neural environment by proteins encoded
  by sensome genes, crucial to maintain CNS homeostasis, and rapidly respond to damage
  or insult. Once excess neural progenitors or debris are detected, microglia initiate
  their clearing functions via TREM2, CR3 (DAP12), AXL, MER, and other yet‐to‐be‐defined
  molecules. Additionally, microglia sculpt and refine neural circuits by pruning
  synapses during specific developmental windows through the complement signaling
  pathway, fractalkine/ADAM10 signaling, and TREM2‐mediated pathways. Microglia also
  actively “listen” to adjacent neuronal activity by P2Y12, GABA‐R, β2AR, AchR, and
  other neurotransmitter receptors
