caption: Differential expression of metabolic pathways in endfoot versus somata. Diagram
  of the glycolytic pathway (green highlight), tricarboxylic acid cycle (purple highlight),
  electron transport chain (yellow highlight), and glycogen and glutamate pathways;
  protein abbreviations are depicted for each metabolic step, and colored tags depict
  differences in abundance between endfeet and somata, per the key in the upper right;
  if no difference was reported between endfeet and somata, an encircled B is depicted
  beside the protein name.
