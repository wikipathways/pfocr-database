caption: (A) Expression of key Wnt target genes overlayed on CSHMM showing enrichment
  in upper vs. lower paths.(B) Schematic of method used to determine the exact time
  of Wnt pathway activation. The top 3 panels show the continuous expression of Wnt
  markers reconstructed using splines for the top paths (blue curve) vs. bottom paths
  (orange curve). For all three markers there is a split in expression values at the
  halfway point between nodes N1 and N2 (middle of P1). To determine the real time
  denoted by this point a time is assigned for each node in the CSHMM tree revealing
  that the middle point is day 17.5.(C) Schematic summarizing experimental plan for
  testing effect of time-dependent downregulation of canonical Wnt signalling by CHIR
  withdrawal.(D) Retention of distal lung epithelial fate on day 29 of the experiment
  described in C, measured by the frequency of cells expressing the NKX2-1GFP and
  (E) SFTPCtdTomato reporters quantified by FACS. *=ANOVA p<0.05.
