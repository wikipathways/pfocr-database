caption: 'Regulatory mechanisms of DELLA stability by PTMs. Ubiquitination: (1) canonical
  pathway: high GA levels allow for the formation of the GA–GID1–DELLA ternary complex
  and the subsequent recruitment of the SCFSLY1/GID2 E3 ubiquitin complex for DELLA
  ubiquitination (Ub) and degradation. (2) COP1 pathway: under shade or warm temperature,
  COP1 is quickly re-accumulated in the nucleus to target DELLAs for 26S proteasome-mediated
  degradation by the CUL4–DDBCOP1 complex. Likewise, COP1 enhances GA levels, thereby
  promoting DELLA destabilization through the canonical pathway. (3) FKF1 pathway:
  under long-day photoperiods, FKF1 interacts directly with DELLAs to promote their
  polyubiquitination by the SCFFKF1 complex and proteolytic degradation. SUMOylation:
  salt stress induces OTS SUMO protease degradation and consequently leads to the
  accumulation of SUMOylated (S) DELLAs. SUMO-conjugated DELLAs are able to bind to
  the SIM site of GID1 independently of GAs. Thus, GID1 is sequestered, which allows
  for the accumulation of non-SUMOylated DELLAs to trigger defense responses. Phosphorylation:
  phosphorylation (P) mediated by EL1 (and probably by MLKs and/or other kinases)
  stabilizes DELLAs, whereas TOPP4-mediated dephosphorylation leads to GA/GID1-dependent
  DELLA degradation.'
