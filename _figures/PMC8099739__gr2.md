caption: Networks depicting the ‘response cores’ in (a) viral and (b) bacterial infections.
  The networks in each case correspond to the top-ranked perturbations in infection
  as compared to healthy controls. The viral core consists of 1043 nodes and 1,151
  edges, of which 62 belong to DEGsetV (46-up, 15-down, FC > ± 1.5, q ≤ 0.01) while
  the bacterial core consists of 1393 nodes, 1845 edges of which 287 belong to DEGsetB
  (104-up, 183-down, FC > ± 1.5, q ≤ 0.01). The hubs are labeled by their respective
  functional categories (from Reactome) obtained through a pathway enrichment analysis
  of the hub gene and its first neighbors using a hypergeometric test (q ≤ 0.01).
