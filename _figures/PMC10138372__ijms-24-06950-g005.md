  metabolism) in quinoa leaves. (A) Overview of the starch and sucrose metabolism
  pathway in quinoa leaves in response to saline-alkali stress. Rectangles with orange
  frames, metabolites; circles, DEGs; blue solid lines with arrows, directions of
  the processes; rectangles with green frames, other metabolism pathways; gray dotted
  lines, connection of the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway with other metabolism
  pathways. The colors of rectangles and circles indicate significances, which are
