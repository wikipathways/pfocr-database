caption: After cell cycle exit, and under the control of OTX2, postmitotic precursors
  get restricted to the photoreceptor lineage and are fated to produce both rods and
  cones. These precursors will differentiate by default into S-cones, unless their
  fate is directed into rods by the expression of NRL, or into M-cones by the expression
  of TRβ2. In developing photoreceptors, NRL expression is initiated by OTX2 and RORβ
  and increases during development to restrict the lineage to rods. OTX2 plays a crucial
  role in maintaining NRL expression to consolidate rod cell fate. Sustained expression
  of NRL is needed to induce downstream targets, including NR2E3, that are critical
  for suppressing cone genes and for rod maturation in collaboration with CRX. In
  CrxRip/+ mutant retinas, CRXRip protein blocks both OTX2 and CRX, arresting NRL
  expression and, consequently, rod differentiation pathway. In addition, CRXRip protein
  prevents the CRXWT protein from forming requisite transcriptional complexes for
  rod gene expression. Ultimately, the arrest in photoreceptor development does not
  permit phototransduction, causing congenital blindness.
