caption: T cell receptor signaling pathway showing downstream mediators regulated
  by DNA methylation, gene/protein expression and/or protein phosphorylation. T cell
  receptor signaling pathway depicting genes with their corresponding promoter methylation
  status, gene and protein expression levels and phosphorylation status between naïve
  and memory T cells. Promoter methylation status, transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic
  measurements were imported into GeneSpring and overlaid onto the TCR signaling pathway
  to identify molecular signatures underlying the transition from naïve CD4+ T cells
  to memory CD4+ T cells. Different shapes are used to denote promoter methylation,
  mRNA, protein and phosphorylation status. Red indicates high in naïve CD4+ T cells,
  blue indicates high in memory CD4+ T cells and the unchanged are depicted in white.
  Different colored arrows are used to depict various modes of regulation of pathway
  components
