caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism by which SAHA affects the D-IBS via the
  STAT3/SERT/5-HT signaling axis. SAHA could promote the transcription of SERT by
  inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation and the 5-HT signaling pathway, thereby repressing
  visceral sensitivity of D-IBS rats and consequently alleviating D-IBS.
