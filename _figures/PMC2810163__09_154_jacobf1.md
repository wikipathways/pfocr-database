caption: Whole body radiation (Radiation) combined with polymicrobial sepsis induced
  by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) (RCI) activates the sympathetic nervous system
  (SNS) and causes the release of norepinephrine (NE) from the sympathetic fibers
  in the gut. The NE then travels through the portal vein into the liver. While in
  the liver, NE binds to the α2A-adrenoceptors (α2A-AR) and activates the signaling
  pathway(s) responsible for the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines,
  TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and HMGB-1, from Kupffer cells (KC). Ghrelin, a stomach-derived
  peptide, reaches the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) in the brain by crossing the blood-brain
  barrier, stimulates GHSR-1a receptors (ghrelin receptors), activates the vagus nerve
  and in turn, through the cholinergic pathways, downregulates TNF-α and other proinflammatory
  cytokines. While activating the cholinergic pathway, ghrelin can inhibit the SNS,
  decrease the release of the sympathetic neurotransmitter NE, and cause the downregulation
  of the proinflammatory cytokines as well. Therefore, ghrelin’s beneficial effect
  in RCI is caused by the rebalance of the dysregulated sympathetic/parasympathetic
  nervous systems. HMGB-1, high-mobility-group B1.
