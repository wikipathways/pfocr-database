caption: 'Membranes, Ion Channels, and Transporters of the NE.(A) Membrane structure
  of the nuclear envelope. ONM, outer nuclear membrane; INM, inner nuclear membrane;
  PNS, perinuclear space; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NR, nucleoplasmic reticulum;
  NPC, nuclear pore complex (depicted as two yellow bars).(B) Three routes of ion
  transport at the nuclear periphery (bidirectional black arrows): through the NPC
  (1), across the ONM (2), and across the INM (3).(C) Reported ion channel activities
  in the NE of mammalian cells. IP3-regulated Ca2+ channels in the INM (including
  the NR) and ONM are presumed to release Ca2+ from the perinuclear space into the
  nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, respectively. A Ca2+-ATPase has been identified in the
  ONM. The direction of ion flow is unknown for K+ and Cl– channels.(D) Nuclear membrane
  ion channels, transporters, and NUPs acting in the Nod factor signaling pathway.
  Related cation channels (DMI1, CASTOR, POLLUX, and SYM8) and two NPC proteins (NUP85
  and NUP133; enlarged for emphasis) have been identified in genetic screens for nodulation-defective
  mutants in several species of leguminous plants. These proteins are needed for Ca2+
  oscillations (zig-zag line) that occur on both sides of the NE during Nod factor
  signaling (). CASTOR and POLLUX (blue ovals) may be K+ channels that regulate the
  membrane potential of the INM and/or ONM to trigger release of Ca2+ from the perinuclear
  space through as yet unidentified voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (red ovals) ().
  An (unknown) Ca2+-ATPase (orange spheres) presumably pumps Ca2+ back into the perinuclear
  space. A hypothetical function of NUP85 and NUP133 in perinuclear Ca2+ oscillations
  is regulation of the Ca2+ permeability of NPCs (Downie and Oldroyd, 2008).'
