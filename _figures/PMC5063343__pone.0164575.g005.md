caption: (A) The complete network showing interaction between genes at 0 hours after
  LPS under heat stress treatment. Highly connected hubs includes CASP9, IL18, IFNB,
  IL8, and iNOS. There appears to be a small cluster of genes related to apoptotic
  pathway formed near the top of the network. (B) Cluster 2 from MCODE network clustering
  algorithm showing the interaction between IL8, IL18, TLR4, TRAF6, CD40, IFNB, IFNG,
  and CASP9. The cluster shows interaction between multiple mechanisms during response
  to LPS stimulation under heat stress. Interesting to note once again the additional
  interaction with the CASP9/CASP3 apoptotic pathway.
