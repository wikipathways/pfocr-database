caption: 'A, brain in dorsal view and the head‐skin trigeminal pathways initiating
  swimming on the same or opposite sides. Dots show locations of the neuron populations,
  not their real numbers: touch‐sensory trigeminal neurons (tSt, yellow), sensory
  pathway neurons (tIN, pale magenta; rdlc, red), electrically coupled reticulospinal
  excitatory neurons (dIN, brown). Fb, forebrain; hb, hindbrain; mb, midbrain; m,
  muscles; oc, otic capsule; sc, spinal cord; tg, trigeminal ganglion. B, functional
  diagram of the network including the central pattern generator (swim circuit) neurons:
  inhibitory interneurons (cIN, blue; aIN, purple) and motoneurons (mn, green). Continuous
  lines indicate evidence for a monosynaptic connection. Dashed lines indicate indirect
  connections (delay). Large circles represent populations of neurons. Small circles
  (inhibitory) and triangles (excitatory) are synapses and, when they contact a box,
  they connect to all neurons in the box.'
