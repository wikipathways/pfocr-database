caption: ER stress responses to RNA viruses, heat and osmotic stress, and stress-related
  hormones in plants. Under biotic/abiotic conditions, BiP dissociates from IRE1 to
  bind unfolded proteins that accumulate in the ER. Activated IRE1 splices bZIP60
  mRNA (bZIP60), resulting in a frame shift that generates a bZIP60 variant (bZIP60-S)
  targeted to the nucleus. When BiP is sequestered away, bZIP17/28 transcription factors
  are released from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where they are cleaved. The cytosol-facing
  regions of bZIP17/28 are transported from the Golgi apparatus to the nucleus. After
  translocation, bZIP transcription factors upregulate the expression of stress response
  genes. Expression of bZIP60 is increased by viral infection. SA induces IRE1-mediated
  splicing of bZIP60 mRNA and proteolytic processing of bZIP28. SA regulates the expression
  of stress response genes via an NPR1-depenedent pathway. ABA promotes proteolytic
  processing of bZIP17. Dashed arrows indicate yet-uncharacterized molecular pathways.
