caption: Protective roles of mitophagy.Reactive oxygen species such as reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) acts as a signaling mechanism
  to induce autophagy or mitophagy which has a role in bioenergetic pathway and protective
  roles in cell survival. On the other hand, an increase in mitochondrial fusion protects
  mitochondria through mitophagy. The PTEN-induced putative kinase protein 1 (PINK1)
  of mitochondria is destabilized by presenilin rhomboid like (PARL) and cytosolic
  E3 ubiquitin ligase PARKIN (PARKIN) ubiquitinates mitofusion (Mfn), voltage dependent
  protein channel 1 (VDAC1) etc. that results in elevated mitophagy. PINK1 with different
  proteins such as mitochondrial RhoGTase (MIRO), tumor necrosis factor receptor associated
  protein 1 (TRAP1), PARKIN combined with Mfn and voltage dependent anion channel
  1 (VDAC1) has different inhibitory roles such as mitochondrial trafficking and mitochondrial
  remodeling. Clearance of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy enhances mitochondrial
  biogenesis and increases the rate of cell survival.
