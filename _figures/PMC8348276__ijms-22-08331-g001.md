caption: (A) Normal integral metabolic purine salvage pathway enables the regulation
  and availability of purines; (B) Disruption of ADA activity prevents the physiological
  continuation of the purine pathways with increased levels of Ad and dAd. In grey
  letters, the deoxy-metabolites branches are reported. ADA2 inactivation determines
  the stop of the dAD to d-Inosine and Ad to Inosine progression, and consequently
  the downstream final product represented by uric acid, with upstream accumulation
  of both dAd and Ad metabolites.
