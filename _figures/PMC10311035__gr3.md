caption: 'Glucose, glutamine and fatty acids utilization in osteoblasts via Wnt signaling
  regulation. Wnt ligand binds to FZD and LRP5/6 receptors which leads to degradation
  compound''s deactivation, which is composed of Dishevelled, Axin, GSK-3β, APC''s
  and CKlα (casein kinase 1). Through this mechanism, in mature osteoblastic cells,
  β-catenin''s amount increases in the cytoplasm then translocates to the nuclei and
  assisted by the TF (also known as sequence-specific DNA-binding factor), the mitochondrial
  fatty-acid β-oxidation gene expression initiates. In osteogenic cells, mTORC1 signaling
  pathway is stimulated by Wnt pathway and causes the amount of glutamine amidohydrolase,
  the initiative enzyme in the glutaminolytic pathway, to increase. Wnt pathway also
  stimulates mTORC2 signaling pathway in order to adjust the proper number of proteins
  engaged in the glycolytic pathway. Notes: MLST8, mTOR associated protein, LST8 homolog; RAP,
  RAS/RAP GTP-binding protein; RIC, resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase; SIN1,
  stress activated protein kinase interacting protein 1; TSC1/2, tuberous sclerosis
  proteins 1 and 2.'
