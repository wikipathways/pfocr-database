caption: 'EBV-Driven Oncogenesis: Manipulating MAPK Signaling and Apoptotic Pathways:
  EBV promotes tumorigenesis through the MAPK signaling pathway, manipulating host
  cellular mechanisms. The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), a crucial EBV oncoprotein,
  activates MAPK components—ERK, JNK, and p38—downregulating dual-specificity phosphatases
  DUSP6 and DUSP8 that normally inhibit this signaling. Simultaneously, LMP1 enhances
  SP1 expression, regulating genes linked to cell growth and differentiation, and
  inhibits EphA4, suppressing cellular proliferation and creating a favorable environment
  for viral oncogenesis. Additionally, EBV increases BGLF2 and BZLF1 expression via
  the JNK pathway, activating AP-1 to promote viral replication and bolster its oncogenic
  effects. EBV transforms B cells and induces apoptosis via the JNK/p38 pathway. By
  regulating CD70 and CD47 expression, EBV activates signaling cascades that cause
  the activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, ultimately leading
  to apoptosis'
