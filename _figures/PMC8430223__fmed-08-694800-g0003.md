caption: POSTN induces osteoblast differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. (1) Upon
  treatment with recombinant POSTN, the expression of semaphorin 3A is increased and
  promotes the activation and differentiation of osteoblasts through the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway. (2) The intensity of osteoclast apoptosis signals is weakened
  by POSTN expression through the TGF-β signaling pathway under a high level of mechanical
  stress. (3) The expression of the autophagy-related protein beclin 1 in osteoblasts
  is increased after Postn silencing. (4) The expression of the proteins RUNX2 and
  RANKL is significantly reduced after Postn gene silencing through the activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway. (5) Osteoblast apoptosis is induced by melatonin
  through the activation of the ERS-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway; subsequently, the cascade
  effects of CHOP, caspase 3, and JNK are triggered to promote apoptosis. POSTN overexpression
  can inhibit the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway by suppressing the PERK pathway to protect osteoblasts
  from apoptosis.
