caption: Two signal transduction pathways for mating, morphogenesis, and virulence
  in U. maydis. The pheromone response pathway on the left shows pheromone (Mfa) binding
  to a receptor (Pra), activation of a postulated MAP kinase module via a heterotrimeric
  G protein, and activation of the transcription factor Prf1. This factor increases
  transcription of the b genes encoding homeodomain transcription factors (bW1, bE1,
  bW2, bE2; ref. ). The cAMP signal transduction pathway is shown on the right. The
  major PKA catalytic subunit Adr1 may phosphorylate potential target proteins or
  a proposed cAMP responsive transcription factor to influence target gene transcription.
  Dashed arrows indicate potential interconnections of the two pathways as described
  in Results and Discussion.
