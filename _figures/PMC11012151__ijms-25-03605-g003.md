caption: Role of exercise-regulated renin–angiotensin system (RAS) in amelioration
  of DN. (A) Development of diabetes leads to overactivation of the RAS in the kidney.
  ACE converts Ang I (secreted by the liver) into Ang II. Ang II, by binding to its
  receptor AT1R, has the effect of constricting blood vessels. The overactivation
  of Ang II/AT1R signaling can cause inflammation. ACE2 has antagonistic effects against
  ACE, which can degrade Ang II to produce the vasodilatory heptapeptide Ang-(1-7),
  an essential factor for maintaining renal function homeostasis. Upward yellow arrows
  mean up-regulation of its activity. (B) Exercise can decrease ACE activity and increase
  ACE2 activity. Increased ACE2 activity leads to high level of Ang-(1-7), whose binding
  to its receptor (MasR) results in effects opposite to Ang II. It inhibits ERK1/2
  signaling pathways and ROS generation through SH2-containing protein tyrosine phos-phatase-1
  (SHP1) and SHP2 of the Src family, and it also inhibits NF-κB signaling pathways
  and increases NO production, which leads to actions such as vasodilation and anti-fibrotic
  effects. Created with BioRender.com, accessed on 12 March 2024
