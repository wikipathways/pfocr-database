caption: 'Schematic illustration of Amantadine and its therapeutic role in spinal
  cord injury. Step One: Hub gene identification through molecular docking. Genes
  such as CFH, LY86, CSF1R, HEXB, CX3CR1, and FCRLS are found to be associated with
  spinal cord injury. Amantadine is subsequently identified as a candidate compound
  for treatment. Step Two: Compression injury is induced in C57 mice at 3dpi and 7dpi.
  Step Three: Macrophage subtypes are identified, including inflammatory macrophages
  (IMs), border-associated macrophages (BAMs), and chemotaxis-inducing macrophages
  (CIMs). Detection markers like Mrc1, Ccl12, Il-1b, Cd81, Arg1, and Spp1 are used
  for macrophage characterization. Step Four: Amantadine modulates macrophage activity
  through the Notch signaling pathway, affecting Hif-1α and p-NF-κB. This promotes
  the recovery process by regulating anti-inflammatory factors and preventing neuron
  apoptosis, ultimately aiding spinal cord repair'
