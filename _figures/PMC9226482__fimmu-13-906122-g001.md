caption: Food antigens cross the intestinal epithelium to induce tolerance or provoke
  allergy. (1) Small molecules such as electrolytes and water enter the sub-epithelium
  via paracellular pathways. (2) Degradation of tight junctions increases the permeability
  of the paracellular pathway, which leads to non-selective and uncontrolled entry
  of macromolecules into the intestinal sub-epithelium and contributes to the sensitization
  process of food allergies. (3) Small molecules such as amino acids and glucose that
  are transported across the epithelium by apical brush boundary transporters such
  as SLCs on enterocytes. (4) M cells sample food antigens, and then present them
  to dendritic cells. (5) Goblet cells form goblet-cell-associated antigen passage
  (GAP) to enclose luminal antigens (food antigens and microbial antigens) in internal
  sack-like vesicles, and then transport them across entire cells to dendritic cells.
  (6) In food allergy mouse models, secretory epithelial cells function as conduits
  to allow the transport of food antigens through the epithelium of the small intestine
  and induce a food-induced anaphylactic reaction. (7) CX3CR1+ macrophages rely on
  CX3CR1 expression to form dendrites to efficiently sample antigens from the intestinal
  lumen without disrupting the tight junctions between the cells. CX3CR1+ macrophages
  transfer antigens they captured to CD103+ DC. (A) When food antigens enter the intestinal
  sub-epithelium through above pathways, they are acquired and processed by dendritic
  cells. Then DCs migrate to MLNs where they present the processed food antigens and
  induce tolerance or food allergy. To induce oral tolerance, DCs secrete interleukin-10
  (IL-10), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)
  to induce Tregs and promote their production of IL-10 and TGF-β to maintain tolerance.
  (B) In the case of allergy, oral antigens and adjuvants stimulate the expression
  of IL-33 in intestinal epithelial cells, which in turn upregulates the expression
  of the costimulatory molecule-OX40L on DCs. OX40L expression upregulates DCs to
  promote the TH2 response in the MLN and leads to more severe food allergies.
