caption: 'Reaction steps of the riboflavin pathway and generation of the MAIT cell
  ligand 5-OP-RU. Red colour denotes the individual enzymes involved in the pathway.
  Enzymes are labelled according to their names in E. coli; genes and enzymes in other
  bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis or Lactococcus lactis may follow a different
  nomenclature. Note also that RibC catalyses the dismutation of two DMRL molecules.
  Enzymes: RibA, guanosine-5’-triphosphate (GTP) cyclohydrolase II; RibB, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone
  4-phosphate (DHBP) synthase; RibC, riboflavin synthase; RibD, 2,5-diamino-6-(5′-phospho-d-ribosylamino)-4-pyrimidinone
  (DARP) deaminase/reductase; RibE, 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1-d-ribityl)lumazine synthase
  (lumazine synthase);??, hypothetical phosphatase.'
