caption: Different rules should be used dependent on the biological question at hand.
  For example a State Change interaction is inferred when the rule detects phosphorylation
  of p53 by p38. This is a useful relationship that can be applied to protein signaling
  cascade analysis from proteomics data. “Sequential Catalysis” rule on the other
  hand links entities that are responsible for catalyzing subsequent reactions. This
  is a relationship that frequently occurs in metabolic pathways and is useful for
  metabolomic studies where changes in the concentration of substrates are observed.
