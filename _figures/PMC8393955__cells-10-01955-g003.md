caption: Germline-encoded Ly49H mediate viral antigen-specific recognition. During
  mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, NK cells expressing the Ly49H receptor recognize
  MCMV-infected cells via the MCMV-derived glycoprotein m157. Stimulation of the Ly49H
  leads to the activation of the DAP12-mediated signaling pathway, driving NK cell
  degranulation and secretion of perforins and granzymes. DNAX accessory molecule-1
  (DNAM-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-α/β and IL-1) partially drive the clonal-like
  expansion of NK cells. Inhibitory KIR2DL2/3 in humans and Ly49A/C/G2 in mice can
  block the membrane proximal activation events upon the recognition of MHC class
  I.
