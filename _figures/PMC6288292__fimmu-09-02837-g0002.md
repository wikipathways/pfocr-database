caption: The effect of different preconditioning stimuli in the MSCs response. Schematic
  representation of known effects of highly studied preconditioning factors—hypoxia
  (in blue), 3D culture (in blue), specific soluble factors (green), and inflammatory
  cytokines (red)—in the MSCs response. Blue pathway presents the effect of a hypoxic
  environment on the cells, which is mediated by specific signaling pathaways (Akt,
  ERK, p38MAPK) and culminates in the stimulation of the above signaled effects. Tridimensional
  culture is also represented in blue. MSCs preconditioning with specific soluble
  factors (SDF-1, TGF-α, and melatonin) seems to stimulate the same signaling pathways
  as a hypoxic environment and, thus, elicit the same general response from these
  cells. The use of inflammatory cytokines to influence the MSC response, as represented
  in red, besides promoting the specific above shown effects, also stimulates the
  production of factors that seem to be common to all the other preconditioning factors.
  The pathways that mediate this activity are still to be determined.
