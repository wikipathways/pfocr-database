caption: BCAA hypocatabolism promotes tumour development. Leucine affects mTORC activity
  by regulating the ubiquitination state of Sestrin2. BCAA accumulation promotes the
  progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung
  cancer, and leukaemia by activating the mTORC signalling pathway. EZH2, MSI2 and
  NARSG12D are involved in regulating the expression of BCAT1, which leads to an increase
  in the catabolic reverse reaction of BCAAs and then promotes the activation of mTORC.
  The downregulation of BCAT2, BCKDHA and BCKDHB led to a reduction in BCAA catabolism
  and promotes the activation of mTORC. Deletion of PPM1K leads to BCAA accumulation
  by increasing the ubiquitination of MEIS1 and p21, damaging the dry nature of HSCs
  and LICs and leading to leukaemia. In addition, BCAA accumulation promotes ROS production
  through the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. BCAA
  accumulation caused by the overexpression of BCKDK may protect NSCLC cells by maintaining
  glycolysis and reducing ROS accumulation
