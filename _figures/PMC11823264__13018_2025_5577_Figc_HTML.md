caption: Biochemical substances. The imbalance between ECM degradation and synthesis
  is driven by a dynamic regulatory imbalance between MMP-3 and TIMP-1 and TIMP-2.
  Disc cells secrete transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which not only promotes
  ECM production (including proteoglycans and collagen) but also further promotes
  nerve and blood vessel formation by stimulating NGF production. In addition, semaphorin
  3 A secreted by neurons competitively inhibits the binding of vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) to nerve ciliary proteins, inhibits the growth of certain neuronal
  axons, induces growth cone disintegration, promotes osteoblast production and inhibits
  bone loss. During disc degeneration, disc cells also release a variety of proinflammatory
  factors, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and PGE2, which collectively inhibit
  proteoglycan and collagen synthesis and exacerbate inflammation by activating the
  NF-κB pathway, which further stimulates the secretion of inflammatory factors such
  as IL-1β and TNF-α, forming a positive feedback loop. The activation of NF-κB further
  stimulates the secretion of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and TNF-α, forming
  a positive feedback loop while inducing the expression of MMP-3 and accelerating
  ECM degradation. Inflammatory factors also activate dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons,
  triggering sensory nerve hypersensitivity and increasing the experience of pain.
  In particular, high concentrations of PGE2 can increase norepinephrine (NE) secretion
  by acting on sensory EP4 receptors, which further promotes osteoblast activity to
  maintain bone homeostasis. This complex regulatory network reveals the mechanism
  of interaction between disc degeneration, pain, and bone metabolism
