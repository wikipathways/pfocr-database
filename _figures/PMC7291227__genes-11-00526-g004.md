caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) upstream regulatory analysis. Upstream analysis
  of the post-GWAS genes, including HLA and non-HLA genes, demonstrated (A) HDAC1
  and (B) STAT5A as the most significant transcription factors (TFs) that regulate
  the highest number (13 molecules illustrated above) of the post-GWAS genes studied
  here. The sub-cellular localisation of the molecules has been illustrated by pinpointing
  the broad network communication of the involved molecules in a cell. Arrows have
  depicted protein-protein interactions of molecules produced by the post-GWAS assigned
  genes. The arrowheads depict an “act on” relationship towards a positive regulation.
