caption: Schematics of native and transplanted two-component signaling pathways. (A)
  The native pathway consists of a receptor histidine kinase protein, which senses
  and propagates the signal to a cognate response regulator that regulates gene expression.
  (B) The envisioned adaptation to the mammalian host. Subscript “hum” indicates human-optimized
  codon sequence. DNAB, DNA binding. Pconst, constitutive mammalian promoter. P, phosphate;
  Pmin, minimal mammalian promoter; VP16, VP16 transactivator domain.
