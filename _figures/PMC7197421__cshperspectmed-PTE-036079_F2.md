caption: PTEN deficiency drives a progrowth, antiapoptotic and DNA damage-prone phenotype.
  (A) In PTEN wild-type (WT) cells exposed to genotoxic stress, PTEN coordinates a
  cellular response that determines the balance between “DNA repair and survival”
  and “DNA damage and apoptosis” outcomes via lipid phosphatase-dependent regulation
  of PI3K signaling in the cytoplasm and protein phosphatase activity-dependent regulation
  of the DNA damage response (DDR) in the nucleus. (B) In PTEN-null cells exposed
  to genotoxic stress, loss of cytoplasmic PTEN function drives hyperactivation of
  the progrowth and antiapoptotic PI3K/Akt signaling pathway while loss of PTEN nuclear
  function leads to accumulation of DNA damage. The increase in apoptotic signals
  emanating from failure to repair DNA is countered by constitutive activation of
  PI3K/Akt survival signaling, allowing unrepaired cells to reenter the cycle despite
  accumulating irreparable DNA damage and further contributing to the diseased state.
  (L) lipid phosphatase activity, (P) protein phosphatase activity.
