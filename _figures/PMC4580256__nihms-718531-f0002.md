caption: '(A) In a normal glioma cell with an intact PI3K pathway, T cells are able
  to bind antigenically and induce cellular apoptosis. (B) In a glioma cell with aberrant
  PI3K pathway signaling, PD-L1 expression is upregulated. This has two consequences:
  T cells bind through the PD-1 receptor and undergo apoptosis; and glioma cells secrete
  soluble factors (in red), which are taken up by monocytes. Monocytes secrete IL-10,
  which then upregulates PD-L1 expression on their cell surface. PD-1: Programmed
  death-1; PD-L1: Programmed death ligand-1.'
