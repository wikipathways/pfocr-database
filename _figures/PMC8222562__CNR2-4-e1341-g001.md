caption: Schematic representation of DSB repair pathways that operates in a mammalian
  cell. There are mainly three pathways to take care of the repair of DSBs in mammalian
  cells; homologous recombination (HR), classical nonhomologous end‐joining (c‐NHEJ),
  and alternative NHEJ (A‐NHEJ). As shown in the figure, each pathway has its own
  repertoire of proteins, which aids in repairing the broken DNA. HR repairs DNA breaks
  based on the homology and occurs at the replicative phase of the cell cycle and
  is error‐free. c‐NHEJ occurs throughout the cell cycle and is error‐prone. Ligation
  of broken ends is mediated by Ligase IV/XRCC4/XLF complex. Alternative NHEJ is also
  error‐prone, leading to extensive deletions, and repair occurs based on the microhomology
  regions
