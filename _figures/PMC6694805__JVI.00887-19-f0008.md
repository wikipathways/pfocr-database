caption: Schematic diagram showing the molecular signaling pathway for JEV-induced
  apoptosis and encephalitis via NS4B. JEV particle enters cytoplasm and releases
  viral RNA, which directs the synthesis of NS4B protein. The synthesized NS4B protein
  puts two PERK molecules together with its LIG-FHA and LIG-WD40 domains, leading
  to dimerization and activation of PERK, which causes the phosphorylation of elF2α
  and subsequent increase of ATF4 translation. The ATF4 protein enters the nucleus
  and induces the transcription of CHOP gene by binding the UPR element (UPRE). CHOP
  then triggers apoptosis and encephalitis.
