caption: Low pH induces differentiation of T cell into Tregs. Tumor-derived exosomes
  contain TGF-β, which acts on the receptor on the surface of T cells to activate
  the SMAD signaling pathway and promote the expression of Foxp3. Tumor-derived exosomes
  contain IL-10, which acts on receptors on the T cell surface to activate the JAK/STAT
  signaling pathways and promote Foxp3 expression. Tumor-derived exosomes contain
  miR-214, which enters Tregs by endocytosis, inhibits the expression of PTEN protein,
  and then promotes the expression of the cycle-related transcription factor E2F by
  activating the PI3K signaling pathway and promote Tregs proliferation. PTEN maintains
  the stability of Tregs by inhibiting the activation of PI3K/Akt to stabilize the
  expression of CD25 and promotes the induction of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway
  to maintains the stability of Tregs
