caption: Schematic Model for Basal Resistance in Compatible Interactions Based on
  the Zigzag Model.This model summarizes the quantitative output of the plant immune
  system, based on the summation of PTI and ETS in compatible interactions, as proposed
  in the zigzag model of . In the case of a wild-type plant attacked by the wild-type
  fungus, PTI mediated through SIPK/WIPK (S/W) is suppressed by ETS, resulting in
  lesion formation. However, PTI by the ssd1 mutant is induced to higher levels than
  by the wild-type fungus, and ETS is not sufficient to suppress PTI below the threshold
  required for effective resistance, resulting in attenuated pathogenicity. In the
  case of SIPK WIPK–silenced plants, the level of PTI induced by the wild-type fungus
  and ssd1 mutant is reduced compared with that of wild-type plants. ETS by the ssd1
  mutant suppresses PTI below the threshold for effective resistance, resulting in
  lesion formation. Thus, the SIPK/WIPK activity induced by the wild-type fungus and
  ssd1 mutant correlates with PTI, and the threshold for effective resistance depends
  on the sum of PTI minus ETS. HR, hypersensitive response.
