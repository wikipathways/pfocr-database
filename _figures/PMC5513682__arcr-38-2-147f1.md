caption: 'Major and minor ethanol-oxidizing pathways in the liver. Ethanol (i.e.,
  ethyl alcohol) is oxidized principally in hepatocytes of the liver. (Middle panel)
  Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), a major enzyme in the cytosol, and aldehyde dehydrogenase
  2 (ALDH2), which is located in the mitochondria, catalyze sequential oxidations
  that convert ethanol to acetate, producing two mole equivalents of reduced nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide (NADH). (Right panel) Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is a major
  inducible oxidoreductase in the endoplasmic reticulum that oxidizes ethanol, in
  the presence of molecular oxygen (O2), to acetaldehyde and converts reduced NAD
  phosphate (NADPH) to its oxidized form, generating water. (Left panel) Peroxisomal
  catalase is a minor hepatic pathway of ethanol oxidation that uses hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2) to oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde and water.SOURCE: Figure adapted from
