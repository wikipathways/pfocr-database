  output of ﾏウcfG-dependent transcription. The weight of arrows shows the relative
  regulatory contribution of each sensor kinase under light and dark conditions.B.
  Model of GSR control network including protein interactions (solid lines) and transcriptional
  output (dashed lines). Most, but not all, of the GSR pathway regulators are subject
  to feedback regulation. PhyR, which serves to integrate signals, and GsrK, the primary
  activating kinase, are not under transcriptional control of ﾏウcfG, and are instead
  constitutively expressed. This feature of the GSR system in E. litoralis DSM 8509
  likely necessitates a negative regulator to prevent constitutive activation of GSR
  transcription; GsrP fulfills this function.
