caption: Physiological overview of the secretory pathway. (A) Synthesis, anchoring,
  and translocation of protein to the ER (ribosome binding to the ER membrane is promoted
  by the SRP complex, which recognizes the SR; once in the ER lumen, the ribosome–nascent
  protein complex, coupled to the translocon, translates the polypeptide into the
  lumen of the ER), (B) Protein folding and quality control (the newly synthesized
  proteins with correct folding and assembly continue their forward movement in COPII-coated
  vesicles that fuse with the GA for cargo delivery; however, the secretory pathway
  is bidirectional, and the circulatory pathway may stretch from the GA to ER, moving
  retrogradely through COPI-coated vesicles). (C) Protein sorting (when proteins arrive
  at the TGN, they are classified and packaged in transport vesicles to be sent to
  their final destination, i.e., the extracellular space). ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  GA, Golgi apparatus; SR, signal recognition; SRP, signal recognition particle; TGN,
  trans-Golgi network. The figure was created with BioRender.com (agreement no. AM24BH3QGW).
