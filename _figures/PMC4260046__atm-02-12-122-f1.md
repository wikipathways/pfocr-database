caption: Schematic of the binding sites on human epidermal growth factor receptor
  2 (HER2) for FDA-approved HER2-directed therapies. HER2 is a transmembrane receptor.
  Activation of HER2 results in cell signaling through the MAPK (RAS, RAF, MEK, and
  ERK) pathway and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, leading to cellular proliferation. Trastuzumab
  and T-DM1 binds to the juxtamembrane domain of HER and inhibits cell signaling.
  T-DM1 is then endocytosed and DM-1 is released within the cell, where it can exert
  its cytotoxic effect via inhibiting microtubule function. In contrast pertuzumab
  binds domain II of the extracellular domain of HER2, preventing receptor heterodimerization
  with HER1, HER3, and HER4, and cell signaling. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib
  binds the intracellular adenosine triphosphate binding domain of HER1 and HER2 and
  results in inhibition of cell signaling.
