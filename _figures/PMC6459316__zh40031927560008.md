caption: 'Summary of cellular effects and proposed mechanism of the miR-21-5p effect
  in response to lipid. A: a simplified diagram of components of glucose and fatty
  acid oxidation pathways relating to this study. B: increased miR-21-5p levels would
  be expected to suppress of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α,
  and possible other genes, when palmitic acid (PA) is added. This would reduce fatty
  acid oxidation (FAO) and increase glucose oxidation. Attenuated lipid uptake would
  reduce intracellular lipid levels, and lower β-oxidation could reduce reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and result in the observed decrease in lipid peroxidation. It is also
  possible that miR-21-5p may inhibit oxidative stress (gray hatched line). In this
  scenario, increasing extracellular lipid or treatment with etomoxir (ETO) would
  not reduce the oxygen consumption rate because the FAO and uptake machinery regulated
  by PPAR-α would already be attenuated and the cells more reliant on the glycolytic
  pathway. C: reduced miR-21-5p levels in the presence of elevated extracellular lipid
  would be expected to relieve suppression of PPAR-α, leading to an increase in cellular
  lipid uptake and fatty acid oxidation and reduced reliance on glucose oxidation.
  Increased lipid content was observed in anti-miR-21-5p-treated cells. The increased
  β-oxidation may augment ROS production, leading to enhanced peroxidation of the
  intracellular lipid. In this situation, ETO treatment would impact the oxygen consumption
  rate because the cells have made FAO the predominant metabolic pathway. The reduction
  of the oxygen consumption rate in response to exogenous PA may be caused by lipotoxicity
  related to the increased uptake. Our results indicate that increases or decreases
  in miR-21-5p modulate mitochondrial respiration by shifting the balance of fatty
  acid and glucose oxidation. In total, these findings suggest that there is an optimal
  level of miR-21-5p. CPT1a, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; FFA, free fatty acid.'
