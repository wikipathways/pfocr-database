caption: Fibroblasts play a key role in excessive ECM deposition and stricture formation
  in IBD. Th17 cells and Stat3 signalling pathway drive fibrosis in IBD via activation
  of fibroblasts (a). AIEC suppresses let‐7b secretion from intestinal epithelial
  cells, leading to the transformation of intestinal macrophages into fibroblasts
  and intestinal fibrosis. NOD2 mutations contribute to the activation of fibroblasts
  and macrophages, potentially leading to development of strictures (b). HucMSCs and
  ISCs exhibit therapeutic effects in IBD‐related fibrosis by inhibiting proliferation,
  migration, and activation of fibroblasts and promoting tissue regeneration (c).
  Dysregulated lipid metabolism genes contribute to fibrogenesis in adipose tissue,
  and the FC3 subset of fibroblasts is associated with intestinal fibrosis. Additionally,
  stem cells promote fibrogenesis through modulation of lipid metabolism and fibroblast
  function (d). AIEC, adherent‐invasive Escherichia coli; HucMSCs, Human umbilical
  cord mesenchymal stem cells; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; ISCs, intestinal stem
  cells
