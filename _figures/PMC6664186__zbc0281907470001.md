caption: A novel enzyme-catalyzed pathway for oxidized phospholipid synthesis. The
  canonical pathway (top) of oxidized phospholipid synthesis is a four-step process
  composed of the sn-2 hydrolysis of phospholipid by a PLA2, the oxidization of the
  released nonesterified arachidonic acid by LOX or COX, activation of the oxidized
  arachidonic acid (oxAA) by acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), and finally acylation of eicosanoid-CoA
  to the sn-2 position of 1-palmitoyl (or 1-stearoyl)-LPC. In this study, we have
  described a novel pathway (bottom) initiated by an sn-1 phospholipase activity that
  generates 2-AA-LPC, which can be directly oxidized to 2–15-HETE-LPC followed by
  the acylation of 2–15-HETE-LPC by palmitoyl-CoA or stearoyl-CoA catalyzed by sn-1
  LPC acyltransferase activity. FA, fatty acid.
