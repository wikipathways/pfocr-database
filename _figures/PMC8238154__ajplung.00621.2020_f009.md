caption: EV-PA induced adaptive and innate immune response of CF MDM predicted to
  be attenuated. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predictions for chemoattraction of phagocytes
  (A) and MHC-II antigen presentation (B) with genes that were significantly upregulated
  in CF MDM + EV-PA compared to WT MDM + EV-PA shaded in red and those with significantly
  reduced expression levels in CF versus WT MDM + EV-PA shaded in green. Blue shading
  indicates predicted repression. Expression level fold changes between EV-PA exposed
  CF and WT MDM are listed below each gene symbol. n = 3 donors each for WT and CF
  MDM exposed to EVs secreted by WT AEC from 4 donors or CF AEC from 3 donors. AEC,
  airway epithelial cell; CF, cystic fibrosis; EV, extracellular vesicles; EV-PA,
  EVs secreted by P. aeruginosa-exposed AEC; MDM, monocyte-derived macrophages; WT,
  wild type.
