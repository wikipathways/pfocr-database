caption: The gene-drug network and the schematic diagram of the possible effect of
  Polaprezinc on signaling pathways involved in SARS-CoV-2 and its neurological manifestation.
  (A) The relation between genes and their target drugs has been shown as a network.
  The size of each drug (orange diamond nodes) was adjusted based on its FDR significance
  level (biggest nodes indicate smallest FDR levels). (B) Based on drug repurposing
  and Reactome pathway analysis, 4 target genes, such as Fms related receptor tyrosine
  kinase 1 (FLT1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and heme oxygenase
  1 (HMOX1), as well as their mechanisms, were predicted by Polaprezinc in the context
  of COVID-19.
