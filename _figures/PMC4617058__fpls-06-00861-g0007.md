caption: A working model of TOR-TRIN1 pathway for modulating cotyledons greening.
  A simplified model shows how TOR regulates cotyledons greening through TRIN1 in
  Arabidopsis. In this model, AZD is able to suppress the kinase activity of TOR.
  TOR negatively regulates the stability of the TRIN1/ABI4 protein in nucleus. TRIN1
  functions as a negative regulator of chloroplast biogenesis and hypocotyl elongation
  through inhibiting the activity of Elongated Hypocotyl 5 (HY5). Hypocotyl elongation
  could be regulated by phytochrome, hormones and other signals might or might not
  mediate via TOR signaling. Arrows and T-bars represent enhancement and inhibition,
  respectively. The solid lines indicate the known confirmed or direct interactions.
  The dashed lines indicate experimentally unproven or indirect links.
