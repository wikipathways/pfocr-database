caption: Reductive stress in glutaminolysis. Glutaminolysis is a metabolic pathway
  that involves the deamination of glutamine by GLS, yielding glutamate and ammonia.
  Glutamate is then converted to α-ketoglutarate, a TCA cycle intermediate. Glutamine
  supports the production of GSH and NADPH, which are two major reducing powers in
  the cells. IDHs catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate
  and reduce NADP+ to NADPH. In general, IDH1 is predominantly present in the cytosol
  and IDH2 is localized in the mitochondria. The generated GSH and NADPH mitigate
  intracellular ROS production.
