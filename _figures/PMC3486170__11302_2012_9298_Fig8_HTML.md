caption: Schematic representation of A2A-receptor actions in SH-SY5Y cells. Top—at
  cellular release sites, cAMP formed within receptor-aligned signalling compartments
  (grey area) facilitated noradrenaline release by activating PKA (which primes vesicles
  for exocytosis, ref. []). Cyclic AMP produced outside receptor-signalling compartments
  enhanced Src-family kinase activity, restricted calcium influx and led to the inhibition
  of noradrenaline release. Phosphorylation of Rabphilin3A following receptor activation
  (dotted arrow) was independent of cAMP/PKA. Bottom—at regions beyond release sites
  (soma), A2A-receptor activation caused phosphorylation of CREB and Src activation.
  Both effects were mediated in part by cAMP/PKA. Activation of Src by receptor-independent
  cAMP was via an unidentified pathway (X) bypassing PKA
