caption: The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway tags proteins with chains of ubiquitin to
  be degraded in the catalytic core of the proteasome. The ubiquitin E1 enzyme binds
  ubiquitin and transports it to the E2 enzyme. The E2 enzyme then transports the
  ubiquitin to the target substrate via the E3 ubiquitin ligase. Substrates (proteins)
  that are polyubiquitinated are degraded by the proteasome. Proteasomes regulate
  the concentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins. The proteasome
  is composed of the catalytic core 20S complex, which comprises α- and β-subunits,
  and two 19S regulatory complexes. Together with ATPases, these form the 26S proteasome.
  The degradation of the cellular proteins is a vital step in the regulation of various
  signal transduction pathways. The degradation process yields peptides which can
  then be further degraded into amino acids and used in synthesizing new proteins.
