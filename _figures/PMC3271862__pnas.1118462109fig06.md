caption: A proposed model for IL-2–mediated reversal of T-cell tolerance through modulating
  Sirt1 expression. (A) Schematic representation of the transcriptional regulation
  of sirt1 during T-cell anergy induction. TCR signaling activates NFAT through calcium/calmodulin/calcineurin
  pathway to induce egr2/3 expression. EGR2 and EGR3 bind to FoxO3a at sirt1 promoter
  to synergistically induce sirt1 gene transcription for inducing and maintaining
  T-cell tolerance. (B) Schematic representation of IL-2–mediated reversal of T-cell
  anergy. When anergic T cells receive IL-2 (may be also CD28), its binding to IL-2R
  activates PI3K/AKT. The activated AKT phosphorylates FoxO3a leading to sequestering
  FoxO3a to cytoplasm. Therefore, sirt1 gene expression is inhibited leading to breakdown
  of T-cell tolerance.
