caption: (A) Soluble molecule, but not prostaglandin E2, that will maybe activate
  and enhance IDO pathway on hMSCs (B) As IDO activation consequence there is tryptophan
  depletion from the environment leading to down regulation in lymphocytes proliferation
  (C) hMSCs IL-7 secretion will lead lymphocytes to survive without interfering with
  proliferation (D) For unknown reasons hMSCs will lead to a down regulation in INF-γ
  and IL-17 secretion by T lymphocytes altering the environmental ratio between Th1:IFN-γ,
  Th17:IL-17 secreting cells and T regulatory cells.
