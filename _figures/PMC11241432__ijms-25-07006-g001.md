caption: 'Schematic diagram of two-way communication connecting intestinal microflora
  with the brain. The transmission between the dysbiotic gut and the central nervous
  system occurs through several pathways: (1) the neuroanatomical pathways (vagus
  nerve, VN), where vagal afferent fibers originate from terminals in the intestinal
  wall, but do not have direct access to the intestinal microflora. The vagal fibers
  cannot penetrate the intestinal epithelium unless the intestinal epithelium’s integrity
  is destroyed, which creates the possibility of microorganism invasion. When the
  intestinal epithelial barrier is disrupted, the gut bacteria and their metabolites
  can make direct contact with the VN. (2) The intestine contains numerous bacteria
  that produce endotoxins or can convert dietary components into several metabolites,
  such as SCFAs. These metabolites regulate homeostasis, maintain BBB integrity, and
  influence brain function. Microbial dysbiosis leads to a proinflammatory milieu
  and systemic endotoxemia, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases
  and metabolic disorders. The enteric vascular barrier (GVB) prevents bacteria from
  entering the bloodstream. After the destruction of the GVB, the bacteria and their
  toxic metabolites enter the bloodstream, causing oxidative/nitrative stress and
  inflammatory reactions. (3) Proinflammatory factors involved in local intestinal
  inflammation may reach the brain to induce mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia.
  (4) TLR receptors recognize ligands from commensal or pathogenic bacteria to maintain
  tolerance or trigger immune response, respectively. TLR4 involvement induces several
  intracellular signaling cascades, producing cytokines and chemokines essential for
  maintaining gut homeostasis and infection control. CD4+ T cells produce proinflammatory
  cytokines (such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-17 (IL-17)), which may
  enter the peripheral circulation driving systemic inflammation. Interleukin-22 (IL-22)
  is a cytokine with many protective qualities, but requires constant regulation to
  prevent overproduction in inflammatory settings. IL-22 is considered protective
  at barrier sites exposed to external stimuli in an acute setting. However, chronic
  inflammation can result in the dysregulation of IL-22 signaling, promoting overt
  tissue damage'
