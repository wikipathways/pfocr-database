caption: Schematic of the proposed mechanism for astaxanthin, rescuing the LPS-induced
  immune dysfunction of DCs and protecting LPS-induced sepsis in mice. (A) Astaxanthin
  firstly activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway, and then significantly upregulated
  HO-1 expression, which suppressed the immune functions of LPS-induced DCs, including
  activation markers (CD69), the cytokines release (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10), phenotypic
  marker (MHCII, CD40, CD80, and CD86) and migration marker (CCR7). (B) Astaxanthin
  decreased the production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in serum, recovered the change
  in body weight and decreased the mortality of the LPS-treated mice.
