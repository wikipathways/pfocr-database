caption: Human and yeast peroxisomal β-oxidation pathways. The human peroxisomal β-oxidation
  pathway for the degradation of straight-chain fatty acids is encoded by the ACOX1
  (encoding acyl-CoA oxidase), MFE2 (encoding multifunctional enzyme) and ACAA1 (encoding
  3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase) genes (pink boxes, black font). These genes were transplanted
  into the yeast system at their corresponding yeast gene loci POX1, FOX2 and POT1,
  respectively. Human peroxisomes contain additional pathways for α-oxidation of branched
  chain fatty acids, plasmalogen synthesis, bile acid synthesis and glyoxylate detoxification.
  Additional pathways that were not investigated in this study are presented in semitransparent
  color. Modified from Waterham, Ferdinandusse and Wanders ().
