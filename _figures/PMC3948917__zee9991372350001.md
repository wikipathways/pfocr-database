caption: Enzymatic reactions and steroid modifications required for DHT synthesis.
  The structure of cholesterol, with carbons 3, 5, and 17 labeled, is shown in the
  upper left. Modifications of carbons 3 and 5 on the steroid A and B rings are catalyzed
  by 3βHSD and SRD5A in the adrenal pathways and pregnanes in the backdoor pathways
  (not shown). Conversion from 17-ketosteroids to 17β-hydroxysteroids is catalyzed
  by the 17βHSD isoenzymes. The conventional pathway occurs through conversion from
  DHEA → androstenedione → testosterone → DHT. The dominant adrenal pathway (5α-dione
  pathway) occurs through DHEA → androstenedione → 5α-dione → DHT. A missense mutation
  in 3βHSD1 (shaded box) increases flux through a metabolic step (DHEA → androstenedione)
  that is otherwise rate-limiting in the synthesis of DHT, permitting the development
  of CRPC. Mutant 3βHSD1 may also regulate metabolic flux through the backdoor pathways
  (not shown).
