caption: Astrocytes as memory elements. (A) Schematic representation of the pathway
  leading to t-LTD at developing neocortical synapses. A postsynaptic action potential
  leads to Ca2+ influx into the postsynaptic neuron (1). When this is followed by
  a presynaptic action potential, leading to activation of mGluRs (2), PLC is strongly
  activated (3), leading to the synthesis of endocannabinoids. These endocannabinoids
  leave the postsynaptic neuron to activate astrocytic CB1Rs (4), which cause release
  of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (5). The resultant Ca2+ transients trigger vesicular
  release of glutamate from the astrocyte, which in turn activates presynaptic NMDARs
  (6). This leads to a long-lasting depression in presynaptic release probability
  (7). (B) Astrocytes could act as memory elements. Schematic showing the action potential
  activity of a presynaptic (bottom, blue) and a postsynaptic (top, yellow) neuron,
  as well as the Ca2+ activity of a neighboring astrocyte (middle, pink). By sensing
  the buildup of endocannabinoids during subsequent pairings, astrocyte activity would
  gradually increase during the induction of t-LTD. t-LTD could then be induced only
  when astrocyte activity reaches a certain threshold (dotted line).
