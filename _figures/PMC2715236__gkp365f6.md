caption: Model for the role of FANCM in the DNA damage response. (A) Model for the
  role of FANCM in the FA pathway and crosslink repair in the DNA damage response.
  () The helicase or nuclease domain can target the FA core complex to a replication
  block at a DNA crosslink. () The core complex can stimulate FANCD2 monoubiquitination,
  perhaps by being in close proximity to its substrates FANCD2 and FANCI. () An ATP
  driven conformational change may enable the FANCM complex to recruit additional
  DNA repair proteins that carry out crosslink repair. (B) A cartoon of the FANCM
  protein divided into the three domains systematically dissected in this article.
  Each of the domains confers distinct functions to FANCM in the DNA damage response.
  (C) FANCM helicase suppresses crossovers by dissolving D-loops, by acting early
  to suppress D loop formation FANCM may prevent the formation of Holliday junction,
  which are then resolved by crossover.
papertitle: The Walker B motif in avian FANCM is required to limit sister chromatid
  exchanges but is dispensable for DNA crosslink repair.
