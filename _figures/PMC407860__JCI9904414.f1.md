caption: Flow diagram illustrating two pathways for bile acid synthesis. Cholesterol
  serves as the sole substrate and is converted to cholic acid via both classic and
  alternative pathways. Microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase is the initial and rate-controlling
  enzyme for the classic pathway, whereas mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase initiates
  the alternative pathway and might be rate limiting. The product, 27-hydroxycholesterol,
  is then 7α-hydroxylated by microsomal oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (27-hydroxycholesterol–7α-hydroxylase),
  which is different from microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase.
