caption: 'RNAP stalls at a DNA lesion in the transcribed strand and obscures it from
  repair enzymes. Stalled RNAP is either dislodged (left) or forced to backtrack (right)
  from the site of damage by Mfd and UvrD, respectively, to initiate the process of
  TCR.Mfd-dependent pathway: Mfd binds to stalled RNAP and becomes activated. Using
  its ATP dependent translocase activity it pushes RNAP from behind to eventually
  terminate the elongation complex. Mfd then recruits UvrAB to the exposed DNA lesion
  site. Repair then proceeds as in GGR.UvrD-dependent pathway: Monomeric UvrD and
  NusA associate with RNAP throughout elongation. The SOS response triggers rapid
  UvrD accumulation leading to its dimerization in the elongation complex, which starts
  its ATP-dependent helicase activity. Activated UvrD in collaboration with NusA,
  pulls RNAP backwards, away from the lesion site. UvrD and NusA then recruit the
  UvrAB complex to the site of damage. Repair then proceeds as in GGR. In UvrD-dependent
  TCR transcription can resume shortly after repair has been accomplished, whereas
  Mfd-dependent TCR results in transcription termination.'
