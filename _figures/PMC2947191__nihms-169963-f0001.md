caption: (A) Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) family cell signaling pathway.
  TGF-β family ligands bind and signal through serine/threonine kinase receptors on
  the plasma membrane. Signals are transduced through phosphorylated receptor Smad
  proteins. Receptor Smad/co-Smad dimers translocate into the nucleus to stimulate
  target gene transcription. (B) Receptors and Smad proteins that comprise the core
  signaling pathway for TGF-β and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) family ligands.
  See Shimasaki et al for a comprehensive list of TGF-β family ligands and their receptors.
  AMH, anti-müllerian hormone; GDF, growth differentiation factors.
