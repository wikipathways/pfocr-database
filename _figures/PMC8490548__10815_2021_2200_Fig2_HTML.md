caption: The one-carbon (1-CC) and folate cycles. A narrow gap at the level of MTHFR
  results in accumulation of unmetabolized folic acid, with feedback inhibition by
  excess substrate (Michelis and Menten law); the folate cycle may be reversed. A
  shortage of vitamin B12 (e.g., malabsorption) inactivates methionine synthase, with
  impairment of methionine synthase activity and accumulation of homocysteine. Mutations
  in the CBS pathway may also induces Hcy accumulation
