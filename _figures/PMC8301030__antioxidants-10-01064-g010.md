caption: Antiosteoporotic effects of daidzein (DZ), genistein (GS), glycetin (GC),
  and their metabolites [6-hydroxydaidzein (6-HD), formononetin (FNT), dihydrodaidzein
  (DHD), biochanin A (BCA), and cladrin] through modulation of gene expression at
  transcriptional and translational levels in different bone cell types. Cell differentiation
  and proliferation, osteogenic activity, and bone health (such as bone density) is
  enhanced, whereas apoptosis, bone loss, and bone resorption are attenuated in experimental
  settings (involving MG-63, MC3T3-E1, Saos-2, and bone marrow cells and in vitro
  experiments in rats/mice). In osteoblast cells, GS, DZ and GC upregulate the expression
  of genes associated with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), and
  downregulate Wnt/β-catenin pathway, whereas they inhibit receptor of activator of
  nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL). DZ induces increased ALP and collagen synthesis,
  and inhibits estrogen receptor A alpha/beta (ERAα/β) in MG-63 cells. DZ also decreases
  the expression of genes associated with nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic
  1 (NFATc1), cellular oncogene fos (c-Fos), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)
  and cathepsin K (CTSK), as well as inhibits RANKL in bone marrow cells. DHD and
  6-HD upregulates the expression of genes associated with the bone morphogenetic
  protein 2 (BMP2), transcription factor Sp7 (Osterix), alpha-1 type I collagen (COL1a1),
  runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), and ALP in MC3T3-E1 cells. DZ, BCA,
  and FNT increase the expression of genes associated with RUNX2, ALP, OPG, and COL1
  in Saos-2 cells. As shown in the right panel, cladrin, GS, and FNT improve bone
  health by regulating a wide range of genes in rat and mice. In addition, mixed intake
  of GS, DZ, and GC increases bone calcium retention and decreases bone resorption
  and bone loss in postmenopausal women []. ↑, enhancing; ↓, lowering; →, activation;
  ┤, inhibition. Figure adapted from Kim et al. [].
