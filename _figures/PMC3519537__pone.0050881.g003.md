caption: For the ‘grounding’ stage of ASP, with the tool ‘gringo’, we use our rule
  based representation (logic program), the pathway relations and the appropriately
  encoded gene expression data sets (facts). Gringo, then produces all possible ground
  facts, which are then handled by the solver, ‘clasp’, which uses the logic program
  with the integrity constraints to find consistent ‘answer sets’. Finally, using
  our own custom made program for path searches, we process the answer sets to identify
  affected paths in the experiment using each differentially expressed or mutant gene
  as a starting point and longevity as the end point. These paths are split into primary
  or secondary effects using the information on the longevity phenotype, acquired
  by survival assays, complementary to each experiment.
