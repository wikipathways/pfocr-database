caption: Simplified TGF-β signaling pathways. TGF-β, a multifunctional cytokine, signals
  through TGF-β receptors. Canonical signaling goes through phosphorylation of Smad2
  and Smad3, which then combine with Smad4 to enter into the nucleus. TGF-β mediates
  growth inhibition mainly through this pathway. Smad7 negatively regulates this pathway
  through inhibition of Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation. TGF-β binding to its receptors
  also activates noncanonical signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein
  kinase and PI3 kinase pathways, as well as small guanosine triphosphatase. These
  pathways are implicated in EMT, tumor cell motility, and migration. cyD, cyclin
