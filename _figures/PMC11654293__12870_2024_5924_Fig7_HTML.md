caption: Panoramic expression levels of differentially expressed genes involved in
  chlorophyll and carotenoid metabolism. (a) Chlorophyll biosynthetic and degradative
  pathway. (b) Regulatory network of chlorophyll biosynthesis and degradation based
  on the CytoNCA algorithm. (c) The top 10 hub genes in the regulatory network of
  chlorophyll biosynthesis and degradation based on the CytoHubba algorithm. (d) Carotenoid
  biosynthetic and metabolic pathway. (e) Regulatory network of carotenoid biosynthesis
  and metabolism based on the CytoNCA algorithm. (f) The top 10 hub genes in the regulatory
  network of carotenoid biosynthesis and metabolism based on the CytoHubba algorithm.
  The color scale from green to orange indicates expression values ranging from low
  to high
