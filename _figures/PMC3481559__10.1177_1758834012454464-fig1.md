caption: The VEGF pathway and its targets for inhibition. The interaction of VEGF-A
  with VEGFR-2 is considered the most relevant interaction for angiogenesis. VEGF-A,
  however, also interacts with VEGFR-1, as do VEGF-B and PlGF; the contribution of
  the latter two to the angiogenesis pathway and escape from angiogenesis inhibition
  is not yet fully understood. Targets for angiogenesis inhibition include VEGF ligands
  (aflibercept and bevacizumab), VEGF receptors (e.g. IMC-1121B), and tyrosine kinase
  signaling (TKIs) []. PlGF, placental growth factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth
  factor; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.
