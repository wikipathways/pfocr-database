caption: An opposing role of the ERK and p38 pathways in Ras transformation. The ERK
  activity is required for Ras transformation and the ERK activation alone is sufficient
  to transform cells. The p38 MAPK pathway, as demonstrated with p38alpha, on the
  other hand, is inhibitory to Ras oncogene signaling. Thus, the ERK and p38 MAPK
  pathways oppose each other in determining Ras transforming activity. The inconsistent
  effect of the JNK pathway on Ras transformation was illustrated with the “+” sign,
  whereas “?” indicates that p38beta, gamma and delta proteins may have a distinct
  role in regulating Ras oncogene activity.
