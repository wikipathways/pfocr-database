caption: Cellular heterogeneity between OA patients and non-OA controls. (A) The cell
  fraction difference between patients with OA and non-OA controls. (B) The MIF expressed
  by other chondrocytes interacts with the CD74-CXCR2/4-CD44 complex expressed by
  InfCs and activates the MAPK signalling pathway, which increases the expression
  of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor and further promotes the
  transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (C) An integrative analysis of scRNA-seq
  data and bulk RNA-seq data demonstrates two major subtypes of patients with OA are
  stratified by preFC, resulting in an inflammatory-related subtype and a non-inflammatory-related
  subtype of OA. (D) An integrative analysis of scRNA-seq data and GWAS summary data
  shows that HTC is the key chondrocyte population that drives the susceptibility
  to the pathogenesis of OA. Reproduced from Fan Y et al. (2024) with permission from
