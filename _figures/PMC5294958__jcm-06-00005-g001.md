caption: The TGF-β/Smad4 signaling pathway. The Ligand TGF-β binds a complex of transmembrane
  receptor serine/threonine kinases (Types I and II) in the cell surface and induces
  transphosphorylation of the receptors. The consequently activated receptors phosphorylate
  selected Smads at C-terminal serines, and these receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads)
  then form a complex with a common Smad4. Activated Smad complexes translocate into
  the nucleus, where they regulate transcription of target genes, through physical
  interaction and functional cooperation with DNA-binding transcription factors. Besides
  the Smad4-mediated signaling, Smad2/3 form a complex with Tiflγ and Smad complexes
  then translocate into nucleus, thus regulating the transcription of target genes.
  Activation of R-Smads by Type-I receptor kinases is inhibited by Smad6 or Smad7.
  Phosphorylated TGF-β receptors also activate Ras and ERK in a Smad-independent manner
  and induced tumorigenesis.
