caption: The metabolite changes detected by 1H NMR urine and kidney analysis and the
  pathway referenced to the KEGG database show the interrelationship of the identified
  metabolic pathways involved in the db/db mice. Metabolites in red and green represent
  increase and decrease in levels, respectively, compared with wildtype mice. Stars
  represent the potential targets of drugs for diabetic nephropathy.
