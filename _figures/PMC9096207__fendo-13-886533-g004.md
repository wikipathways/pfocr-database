caption: EOC metastasize preferentially to the omentum, composed of mesothelial cells
  atop of adipocytes. (A) Adipocytes release cytokines and chemokines that influence
  the progression of EOC. IL-6 and adiponectin act as chemoattractants, homing HGSOC
  spheroids to the omentum, and increasing their ability to adhere and invade. IL-8,
  released by adipocytes, binds CXCR1 on EOC cells, activating the STAT3/MAPK pathway
  and increasing adhesion and invasion of EOC cells. MCP-1, released by adipocytes,
  binds CCR2 on EOC cells, activating the PI3k/AKT pathway, increasing proliferation.
  CD36 and FABP4 receptors on EOC cells are involved in the uptake of fatty acids
  that can be utilized by the cancer cells as a source of energy. (B) Milky spots
  are highly vascularized areas, rich in immune cells. They are primarily composed
  of macrophages with a lesser proportion of T cells, B cells and neutrophils. EOC
  cells release IL-8 and MCP-1 that cause NETosis of neutrophils, to which cancer
  cells preferentially bind. Macrophages release many cytokines aiding in the adhesion,
  migration and invasion of HGSOC spheroids. Created with BioRender.com.
