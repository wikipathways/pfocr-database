caption: 'The neuro-glial coagulonome (NG-coagulonome) in the peripheral nervous system
  (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS).(A) The NG-coagulonome in the PNS: Schwann
  cells modulate nerve function in the PNS by secretion of coagulation factors and
  inhibitors and expression of corresponding receptors. NOR: Schwann cells microvilli
  at the NOR express protease activating receptor 1 (PAR1). High levels of thrombin
  activate PAR1 and cause conduction block, whereas low levels activate PAR1 via the
  endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) pathway, inducing a neuroprotective phenotype
  in Schwann cells. Tissue factor binds FVIIa which cleave FX to generate FXa. Levels
  of FXa and activated protein C (aPC) rises after injury, modulate activation of
  prothrombin to thrombin. The Schwann secretes PN1 in electrical activity dependent
  manner which inhibits thrombin. Thrombin inhibition supports neuroregenerative processes.
  FVIIa potentially binds EPCR as well, suggesting fine balance between the different
  modes of PAR1 activation. Myelin expresses the adhesion protein neurofascin 155
  (NF155) which connects it to the axons via caspr. This structure is disturbed by
  thrombin. DRG: Satellite cells at the DRG express PAR1 and neurons express PAR1,
  2 and 4. PAR1 is elevated in diseases involving peripheral neuropathy such as human
  immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The complex of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
  and annexin A2 (ANXA2) is expressed on the DRG cells and associated with chronic
  pain. This suggests a local production of plasmin which is another PAR1 activating
  protease. Thrombin is inhibited by PN1 which is secreted from glia cells and counteracts
  the detrimental PAR1 activation. NMJ: Both muscle fibers and Schwann express PAR1
  and secrete thrombin. Electrical activity induces thrombin secretion which leads
  to synaptic elimination. This is prevented by secretion of the thrombin inhibitors
  such as anti-thrombin (AT) and PN1 from glia cells mainly. (B) The known NG-coagulonome
  in the CNS: Astrocytes modulate nerve conduction in the CNS at the NOR and at the
  synapse. NOR: Peri-nodal astrocytes express PAR1, implying its role in nerve conduction.
  Thrombin cleaves NF155 thus, induces neurodegeneration. Protease nexin (PN)1 is
  secreted from astrocytes by exocytosis and modulate thrombin depended proteolysis
  of NF155. PN2 and AT are assumed to be secreted from astrocytes as well. These thrombin
  inhibitors are part of a feedback loop opposing thrombin damage seen in disease
  models such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Synapse: Astrocyte’s
  PAR1 activation by thrombin depolarizes the synapse, whereas depolarization itself
  releases thrombin from the astrocyte. High levels of thrombin following injury activates
  PAR1 and lead to the secretion of glutamate, thus activating N-methyl-D-aspartic
  acid receptor (NMDAR). NMDAR is localized to all of the three partite synapse components.
  Its activation creates slow long term potentiation (LTP) which changes synaptic
  plasticity. NOR: node of Ranvier; DRG: dorsal root ganglia; NMJ: neuromuscular junction.
