caption: TAp63 is integral for DNA damage signaling in oocytes. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy
  activates the ATM/CHK2 or the ATR/CHK1 pathway. The phosphorylation of TAp63 by
  priming kinase CHK1/2 recruits a second executioner kinase CK1, which adds additional
  phosphorylation. This allows the opening of the closed dimeric state to eventually
  form an active tetrameric conformation. TAp63 acts as a transcriptional activator
  for downstream apoptotic signaling.
