caption: The involvement of Notch in the regulation of myelination and axonal growth.
  Myelinating glia (A) and the axonal membrane (B) both harbor notch ligands (C) and
  notch receptors (D). Proteases (e.g., ADAM10 and γ-secretase) activate the canonical
  notch signaling pathway (E) by processing the ligand bound notch receptor to release
  notch intracellular domain (NICD) (F). The protease ADAM 17 can activate canonical
  notch signaling in a ligand independent manner (G). NICD undergoes translocation
  to the nucleus and binds to a transcriptional de-repression complex containing RBPJ/MAML
  transcription factors (H1,H2). In myelinating glia, canonical notch signaling activates
  a cascade of downstream genes (e.g., Hes1), halting OPC differentiation (H1). Whereas,
  in neurons, canonical notch signaling upregulates DUSP1 and DUSP6 in a Hes/Hesr/Dec
  dependent manner (H2). DUSP1 and DUSP6 inhibit axonal growth and neuritogenesis
  by negatively regulating the p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 pathways, respectively (I). Novel
  notch ligands (e.g., F3/contactin or NB3) activate non-canonical notch signaling
  (J) that recruits the NICD/Deltex1 (DTX1)/p300 transcription complex, thus activating
  genes that are essential for myelination. The notch antagonist, numb, inhibits various
  steps in both the canonical and non-canonical notch signaling pathway (K), whereas
  DTX1 plays a critical regulatory role in both non-canonical notch signaling and
  the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway (L).
