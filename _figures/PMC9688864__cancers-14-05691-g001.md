caption: 'Rewiring of the metabolic fate of AAs in cancers: Gln- derived Glu yield
  α-kg through both transamination or dehydrogenation, by means of AST, ALT, PSAT,
  or GDH, respectively. The first pathway prevails in conditions of glucose abundance,
  resulting in production of the NEAAs Asp, Ala, and Ser, and enabling proliferation.
  Asp is used in nucleotide synthesis while α-kg, Ala, and Ser can feed the TCA cycle.
  On the other hand, GDH is activated during glucose scarcity or cell quiescence,
  supporting cell survival and stress resistance. Furthermore, GLS-derived ammonia
  in cancer can stimulate autophagy, lipogenesis, or being re-incorporated to Glu
  synthesis, which can be re-routed for transamination and biomass production. Abbreviations:
  Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate; Asp, aspartate; Ala, alanine; Ser, serine; GDH,
  glutamate dehydrogenase; GLS, glutaminase. AST, aspartate transaminase; ALT, alanine
  transaminase; PSAT, phosphoserine transaminase; Oaa, oxaloacetate; Pyr, pyruvate;
  3-Php, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate; α-KG, alpha-ketoglutarate.'
