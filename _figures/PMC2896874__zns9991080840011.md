caption: 'Schematic overview of MAPK-regulated processes that are thought to couple
  light to the SCN clock during the early night. Photic input from the RHT drives
  the release of the excitatory amino acid glutamate and the neuropeptide PACAP. Postsynaptic
  receptors trigger actuation of the MAPK signaling cassette, ultimately leading to
  the phosphoactivation of the effector kinase ERK. Two principal ERK-mediated signaling
  events are depicted: activation of MSK and the mTORC1 signaling complex. A potential
  signaling pathway from ERK to CLOCK (CLK) is also depicted (). Signaling through
  MSK leads to activation of transcription factors such as CREB (), which in turn
  drives the induction of early response genes, including c-fos and the clock gene
  Period1, and potentially Period2 (). CREB also stimulates the expression of the
  microRNA miR-132, which works through an as yet unidentified mechanism to limit
  the resetting effects of light (). ERK-dependent activation of mTORC1 causes phosphorylation-dependent
  activation of a p70 S6K/S6 signaling cassette, which stimulates TOP mRNA translation,
  and a 4E-BP1 and eEF1A signaling cassette, which increases CAP-dependent translation.
  These two arms of the mTOR pathway work in conjunction to enhance the rate of mRNA
  processivity. With respect to clock entrainment, we posit that the ERK-dependent
  transcription (via MSK/CREB) and ERK-dependent translation facilitation (via the
  mTOR pathway) lead to a robust induction of the PERIOD protein expression. As a
  state variable of the clock (), the induction of PERIOD leads to a rapid resetting
  of the molecular oscillator.'
