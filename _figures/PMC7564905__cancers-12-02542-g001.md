caption: Signaling mechanisms mediating the actions of neurotrophins. Neurotrophin/Trk
  signaling involves neurotrophin binding to Trks, leading to receptor dimerization,
  autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues, and the recruitment of cytosolic adaptor
  proteins such as Src homology collagen protein (Shc). Shc recruits the adaptor growth
  factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) which is linked to the Ras exchange factor
  son of sevenless (SOS) leading to the activation of a RAS- MAPK pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK).
  Activated extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) translocates to the nucleus and transactivates
  transcription factors such as STAT1/3, Elk1, and Myc, modulating gene expression
  to induce proliferation, differentiation or development. Shc can also recruit GRB2-associated-binding
  protein 1 (Gab1), driving activation of the PI3K-PDK1-Akt cascade. Phosphorylated
  Akt can regulate cell survival, growth, and angiogenesis via activation or inactivation
  of downstream targets. Akt can play an anti-apoptotic role through inactivation
  of Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) transcription factor, Bcl-2-associated death
  promoter (BAD) and glycogen synthesis kinase (GSK-3β). Akt activates several proteins
  important for cell survival such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), murine
  double minute 2 (MDM2) and NF-k β. Phosphorylation of PLCγ by Trk receptors enables
  catalysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP 2) cleavage to diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP 3), which releases calcium from intracellular
  stores, activating calmodulin (CaM) and Ca2+ /CaM-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs).
  Together, these signaling molecules stimulate multiple intracellular enzymes that
  regulate the activity of transcription factors, such as cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB) and ion channels involved in the control of synaptic plasticity.
  Trk transactivation may be mediated by G protein-couple receptors (GPCRs). GPCR-activated
  members of c-Src family induce a neurotrophin-independent transactivation of a Trk
  via trans-phosphorylation of cytosolic tyrosines, which provide docking sites for
  triggering intracellular signaling cascades like PI3K-PDK1-Akt and MAPK. Binding
  of neurotrophins to p75NTR can activate either the NF-kB signaling pathway producing
  prosurvival signals, or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling to induce cell death.
  P75NTR can activate the kinase NIK, which in turn stimulates IKK complexes that
  phosphorylate IKB, leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal processing and
  subsequent releasing of NF-kB. This creates transcriptionally competent NF-κB complexes
  that translocate to the nucleus and induce the expression of survival genes. Neurotrophin
  binding to p75NTR can also induce activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase
  1 (ASK1), which, in turn, activates JNK. JNK itself, or via c-JUN phosphorylation,
  stimulates p53-mediated apoptosis by regulating its targets such as Bcl-2-associated
  X protein (BAX). Pro-neurotrophins can also bind to p75NTR to initiate cell apoptosis
  via the JNK signaling pathway [,,,].
