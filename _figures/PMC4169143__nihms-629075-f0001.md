caption: Cytokines are structurally diverse and bind to structurally distinct receptors.
  One major class of cytokines are those that bind receptors belonging to the Type
  I/II family. These include many, but not all interleukins, interferons, colony and
  stimulating factors, as well as growth hormone, prolactin, and erythropoietin. Of
  note, IL-1, IL-17 and TNF do not signal by the Jak-Stat pathway. Shown here are
  the signal transduction pathways stemming from the IL-2 receptor in T cells culminating
  in the activation of the of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5,
  MAPK, and mTOR serine/ threonine kinase. The Raf-Ras-MAPK pathway is linked to cytokine
  receptors like the IL-2 receptor by adapter molecules such as SHC, Grb2 and SOS.
  IL-2 and other cytokines also activate PDK1 and PKB (Akt) leading to activation
  of mTor. In this regard, it is useful to note that although the term Jak-Stat pathway
  is frequently used, other pathways are also activated. As best we can tell, these
  pathways are also dependent upon Jaks; although, this is an area that deserves further
  research. Tyrosine kinases are indicated in red and serine threonine kinases are
  indicated in blue. The effect of various jakinibs is depicted. mTor inhibitors are
  also shown.
