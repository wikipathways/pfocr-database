caption: Axon death signalling across species. (a) In mouse axons, axonal survival
  is ensured by above-threshold levels of Nmnat2. Nmnat2 is constantly replenished
  by axonal transport, while the atypical ubiquitin ligase complex and the MAPK pathway
  rapidly degrade soluble and vesicle-bound Nmnat2, respectively. Nmnat2 keeps NMN
  levels low, and NAD+ levels constant. Nmnat2 also blocks Sarm1 through an unknown
  mechanism. Upon axotomy, Nmnat2 drops below threshold levels, which induces axon
  death. NMN levels rise, and NAD+ levels are rapidly depleted by the NADase activity
  of Sarm1. (b) Axon death signalling in flies. See text for details. (c) Axon death
  signalling in fish. The genetic interactions of Ca2+, Nmnat2 and Sarm1 remain to
  be determined. See text for details.
