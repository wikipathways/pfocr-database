caption: 'Structure and mechanism of TLR4, highlighting both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent
  pathways. Two pathways are facilitated by stimulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4):
  the MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88)-dependent pathway
  and the MyD88-independent pathway. The early stage of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  activation, which results in the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines, is involved
  in the MyD88-dependent pathway. IFN-regulatory factor (IRF3) and the late phase
  of NF-κB activation are both activated by the MyD88-independent pathway, which results
  in the synthesis of IFN-β and the expression of IFN-inducible genes'
