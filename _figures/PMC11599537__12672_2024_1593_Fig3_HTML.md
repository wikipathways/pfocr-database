caption: The role of TLN1 in cancers. Phosphorylation of talin1 mediated by CDK5 results
  in β1 integrin activation to promote PCa bone metastasis, and miR-9 may mediate
  the suppression of TLN1 expression by inhibiting the activation of the TLN1-regulated
  FAK/AKT signaling pathway to inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of
  tumor; TLN1 can be recognized as a biomarker, prognostic marker and therapeutic
  target in tumors; miR-1303 drives cancer cells proliferative, invasive, and metastatic
  activity via regulating TLN1, while miR-429 and circRNA_400029 impair proliferative,
  invasive, and metastatic activity of cancer cells through the regulation of TLN1.
  In the picture, the red plus sign represents facilitation and the red minus sign
  represents inhibition
