caption: a | Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) prevents the precocious differentiation
  of cardiac progenitor cells and premature expression of cardiomyocyte genes–. HDAC3
  tethers cardiac lineage genes located in lamina-associated domains (LADs) to the
  nuclear periphery for silencing. HDAC3 bound to the nuclear receptor co-repressor
  1 (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT)
  complexes on chromatin interacts with the lamina proteins zinc-finger and BTB domain-containing
  protein 7B (ZBTB7B) and lamina-associated polypeptide 2, isoform-β (LAP2β) to tether
  LADs to the nuclear lamina, where they become facultative heterochromatin and enriched
  in the repressive histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) modification–. The
  release of LADs from the nuclear periphery alters their chromatin configuration
  and facilitates the expression of cardiomyocyte genes,. b | In the second heart
