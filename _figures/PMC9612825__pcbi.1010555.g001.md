caption: The network of pancreatic beta cell central metabolism consists of 56 metabolites
  connected via 65 enzyme-catalyzed reactions, making up glycolysis, glutaminolysis,
  PPP, TCA Cycle, polyol pathway, the electron transport chain, and shuttles between
  the cytoplasm and mitochondria (denoted by the shaded rectangle). For clarity, some
  metabolites are shown as multiple nodes within a subcompartment (for example, mitochondrial
  AKG is shown as two nodes, though they represent the same metabolic species). As
  part of model training, we performed a sensitivity analysis, and the reactions whose
  Vmax values were significantly impactful are colored green. We compared model predictions
  of metabolite levels after 60 minutes of stimulation with 2.8 mM glucose, relative
  to metabolite levels following 60 minutes of stimulation with 16.7 mM, to qualitative
  shifts in metabolism as reported in the literature, provided in the supplemental
  material (). The experimental observations are indicated by the left half of the
  metabolite nodes, and the model predictions are shown on the right. The model can
  differentiate between metabolite location (cytosol versus mitochondria), while the
  mass spectrometry approaches can only measure the total (pooled) amount of a metabolite;
  we have outlined those metabolites in orange. The full set of abbreviations and
  reaction equations is given in .
