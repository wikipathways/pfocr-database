  results from deficiency of the enzyme PCC and is caused by mutations in the PCCA
  or PCCB gene. Isolated MMA can be caused by defects in any of several downstream
  steps in the pathway, including d-methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MCEE), MUT, or enzymes
  that impair the synthesis of adenosylcobalamin (MMAA and MMAB). OAA, oxaloacetic
  acid; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
