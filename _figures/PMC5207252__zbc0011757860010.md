caption: Schematic representation of the pathway of mitochondrial stress signaling
  through CCCP. Mitochondrial stress, resulting from the dissipation of the mitochondrial
  membrane potential by CCCP, leads to the activation of Akt, which can phosphor-inactivate
  GSK-3β. This relieves the negative control of PRC expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation
  of the GSK-3β consensus sites at PRC Ser1505/1507, leading to a severalfold increase
  in PRC protein half-life. However, unlike PRC induction, which is exclusively post-translational,
  c-MYC induction occurs predominantly through a 9-fold increase in mRNA expression,
  with little change in the c-MYC protein half-life. Although PRC and c-MYC protein
  expression are both induced by the GSK-3 inhibitor, AZD2858, the effect on c-MYC
  and the PRC stress genes is muted (dashed arrow) compared with that achieved with
  CCCP. The pathway is blocked by the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 and by the antioxidant
  NAC, presumably because signaling to Akt is dependent on mitochondrial ROS. The
  c-MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 blocks the induction of c-MYC, PRC, and representative
  stress genes, demonstrating an essential requirement for c-MYC, an effect confirmed
  by c-MYC silencing. In addition to the induction of PRC and c-MYC, full execution
  of the stress response requires unidentified stress-dependent events that coincide
  with the in vitro protease resistance of both proteins. We speculate that this stress-dependent
  resistance to in vitro proteolysis reflects a change in the physical state of both
  that is required for the adaptive reprogramming of gene expression.
