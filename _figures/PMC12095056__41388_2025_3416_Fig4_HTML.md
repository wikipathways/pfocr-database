caption: Ciliary Hh signaling promotes the transcription of genes associated with
  therapeutic resistance, including those promoting survival, stem cell behavior,
  and drug efflux. Ciliogenesis-promoting pathways, such as activation of the DNA
  damage response upon chemotherapeutic treatment, enhance ciliary signaling and consequently
  drive resistance. Created with BioRender.com
