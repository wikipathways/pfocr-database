caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of ATR dimer and A2E. ATR that is released
  from opsin upon photoisomerization of 11-cis-retinal reacts with PE to produce the
  N-retinyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NRPE) SB. Both ATR dimer and A2-PE may form
  from the same tautomer x arising from a [1,6] H-shift of NRPE (). Tautomer x can
  form an iminium ion with a second ATR according to path a, and after 6 π-aza electrocyclization
  and autooxidation, A2-PE is formed. Conversely, in path b, C20 of NRPE reacts with
  C13 of free ATR in a Michael-type addition, followed by a Mannich reaction to close
  the ring, and elimination of the amino group of PE, yielding the ATR dimer.
