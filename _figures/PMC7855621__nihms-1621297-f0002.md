caption: Centriole and cilium biogenesis. (A) Regulation of centriole biogenesis during
  the cell cycle. In the G1/S phase of proliferating cells, assembly of new centrioles
  are initiated on both the mother centriole and the daughter centriole, creating
  two mother-daughter centriole pairs. The newly formed centrioles elongate throughout
  the G2 phase. In the late G2 phase, the daughter centriole from the previous cell
  cycle acquires distal appendages and subdistal appendages by sequential recruitment
  of their structural components. Subdistal appendages anchor microtubules and facilitate
  the formation of the pericentriolar material. To initiate the M phase, the two pairs
  of centrosomes separate, migrate to the opposite poles of the cells and establish
  bipolar spindles. Upon exit from cell cycle, the mother centriole docks to the plasma
  membrane by distal appendages for cilium assembly in response to specific developmental
  and/or environmental signals. (B) Intracellular pathway of cilium biogenesis. Ciliogenesis
  is initiated by docking of preciliary vesicles from the Golgi apparatus and recycling
  endosomes to distal appendages. These vesicles subsequently merge to form a large
  ciliary vesicle containing machineries for the maturation of the mother centriole
  and the trafficking of nascent cilia. Upon CP110 removal, the intraflagellar transport
  (IFT) complexes (IFT-A, pink oval and IFT-B, blue oval) and motor proteins (kinesin-2
  motors, red ball and dynein-2 motors, purple ball) are recruited to distal appendages.
  The transition zone emerges shortly after the recruitment of IFT machineries and
  is characteristic of the Y-links. The ciliary axoneme elongates and the ciliary
  membrane extends with the transport of ciliary proteins and building blocks, forming
  the ciliary sheath. Fusion of the ciliary sheath with the plasma membrane exposes
  the primary cilia to the external environment.
