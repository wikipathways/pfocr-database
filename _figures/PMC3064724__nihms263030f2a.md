caption: '(A) A linear model for the BLM, TLM, and ZBM hybrid NRPS-PKS templated assembly
  of the BLM, TLM, and ZBM aglycones from nine amino acids and one acetate. Abbreviations
  for NRPS and PKS domains are: A, adenylation; ACP, acyl carrier protein; AL, acyl
  CoA ligase; AT, acyltransferase; C and C’, condensation; Cy, cyclization; KR, ketoreductase;
  KS, ketosynthase; MT, methyltransferase; Ox, oxidation; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein.
  (B) Proposed pathway for BLM, TLM, and ZBM aglycone biosynthesis. [?] indicates
  a step whose enzyme activity could not be identified within the sequenced BLM, TLM,
  and ZBM clusters. While all intermediates for TLM and ZBM biosynthesis are hypothetical,
  the analogous compounds, except the ones in brackets, have been identified in BLM
  biosynthesis from S. verticillus fermentation as the corresponding free acids.'
