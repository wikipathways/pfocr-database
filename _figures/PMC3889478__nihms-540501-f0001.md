caption: Comparison of in vivo (left) and in vitro (right) signaling support to the
  intestinal stem cell. Signaling networks between the Paneth cell and stem cell appear
  to be broadly conserved. However, disruption on one element of a single pathway
  highlights the important compensation wired into the system where in vivo environments
  can rely upon mesenchymal cells to maintain signaling homeostasis. Wnt, Notch and
  signaling pathways are key players in the balance between stem cell maintenance
  and differentiation.
