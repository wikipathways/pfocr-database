caption: Proposed molecular mechanism by which H2S Inhibits inflammation in KD. In
  KD pathogenesis, multiple factors activate the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, leading
  to systemic vascular inflammation and exacerbating coronary damage. H2S suppresses
  the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine
  release, thereby mitigating inflammation and attenuating coronary lesions (created
