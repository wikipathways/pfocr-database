caption: 'Complement is activated by three pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative
  pathway. In each pathway, a series of initial binding steps followed by proteolytic
  steps ultimately results in activation of the terminal pathway and lysis of the
  target cells. CRP, C-reactive protein; C1-INH, C1 esterase inhibitor; MBL, Mannose-binding
  lectin; MASP, MBL-associated serine protease; C4BP, C4b-binding protein; TCC, terminal
  complement complex. Parts of this figure are adapted from Kraiczy, P. (2016), “Travelling
