caption: The mainly regulated mechanism underlying ferroptosis. GPX4 regarded as the
  key regulator in ferroptosis relies on the biosynthesis of GSH. It produces an antioxidative
  effect on ferroptotic process, and is regulated by MAV signaling pathway. Xc- system
  that is composed of SLC7A11 and SLC3A2 regulates ferroptosis together with glutathione
  metabolic pathway by exchanging glutamate and cystine at 1:1 ratio. Ferroptosis
  is dependent on overload iron that ascribes to peroxides and divalent ferrous salts
  produced by fenton reaction. Iron can be transported from extracellular to intracellular
  in virtue of transferring protein. Mitochondria as the essential organ involving
  in ferroptosis, contains six ferroptosis-related genes and releases ferroptosis-induced
  lipid peroxides through the electron-transporting chain. PUFAs, polyunsaturated
  fatty acids; GSH, glutathione; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; DMT1, divalent metal
  transporter 1; HSPB1, heat shock protein B1; FTH, ferritin heavy polypeptide; IREB2,

  factor 2; SLC7A11, transmembrane protein transporter vector family 7 member 11;
