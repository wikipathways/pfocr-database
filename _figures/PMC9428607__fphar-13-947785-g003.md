caption: Schematic diagram of the dopamine receptor complex signaling cascade. D1-D2
  heterodimers induce calcium release via a Gαq-dependent pathway, distinct from Gs/Golf-
  or Gi/Go- dependent pathways activated by D1 receptor heterodimers or D2 receptor
  heterodimers. D1-D2 heterodimers trigger calcium signaling by activating Gαq and
  PLC, leading to the activation of calmodulin kinase II-α(CaMKIIα). When calcium
  ions enter cells through various ion channels on the membrane, CaMKIIα is activated.
  Activation of CaMKIIα promotes its autophosphorylation, which binds to GluN2B and
  phosphorylates GluN2B at the S1303 site (p-GluN2B). Studies have shown that the
  interaction between GluN2B and CaMKIIα is significant for the synaptic CaMKIIα localization
  and activity. Phosphorylation of GluA1 and GluN2B plays a key role in the glutamatergic
  transmission and is regulated by the D1-D2 heterodimers signaling pathway. Inhibition
  of the recruitment, deletion, or activity of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs)
  would interfere with long-term depression. CaMKIIα/BDNF/CREB-dependent neural plasticity
  pathways may be an important target for dopamine receptor complex research. D1R,

    D1-D2 heterodimers induce calcium release via a Gαq-dependent pathway, distinct
