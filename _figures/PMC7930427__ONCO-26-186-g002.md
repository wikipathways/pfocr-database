caption: 'Significant genes from Pathway Panel. Gene expression of 23 paired patient
  tumor samples and matched control samples were obtained using NanoString nCounter
  PanCancer Pathway Panel. The pairwise t test was performed for the tumor samples
  and matched controls, and the cutoff of FDR <0.05 was used to define significantly
  differentially expressed genes. Red bar, overexpressed; blue bar, underexpressed.
  Abbreviation: FDR, false discovery rate.'
