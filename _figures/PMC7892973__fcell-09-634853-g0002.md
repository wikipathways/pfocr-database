caption: Potential role of irisin-involved integrin signaling cascade in modulating
  tumor microenvironment remodeling. Irisin exerts anti-inflammatory and cancer suppressing
  effects through the reduction in proinflammatory cytokines; via regulation of TLR4/MyD88
  downstream signaling (Mazur-Bialy et al., ,). IL-6 induced EMT is regulated by irisin
  through STAT3/Snail signaling pathways in osteosarcoma (Kong et al., ). EMT inhibition
  is mediated by irisin signaling via the inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway in lung cancer
  cells (Shao et al., ). Activation of CD81/integrin-mediated FAK signaling in response
  to irisin regulate cell survival, proliferation and migration (Oguri et al., ).
