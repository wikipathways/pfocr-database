caption: 'The fatty acid synthesis (FAS, a) and polyketide synthase (PKS, b) pathways
  for DHA biosynthesis. Shaded boxes show the putative genes detected from Aurantiochytrium
  sp. PKU#SW7 transcriptome; White boxes indicate genes not detected in the present
  study. Two candidate genes predicted to encode enzymes catalyzing fatty acid elongation
  (denoted as PH, a) in FAS pathway or functioning as dehydrase/isomerase (denoted
  as DH, b) in PKS pathway, were selected for functional analysis. ACC: Acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; ACP: Acyl carrier protein; MT: Malonyl transferase; KS: Ketoacyl synthase;
  KR: Keto reductase; D/I: Dehydrase/isomerase; ER: Enoyl reductase.'
