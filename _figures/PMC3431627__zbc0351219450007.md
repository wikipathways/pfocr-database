caption: Potential mechanisms of acquired-resistance to vemurafenib. Two major mechanisms,
  compensatory mechanism and genetic mutation, potentially contribute to acquired-resistance
  to vemurafenib in B-RAF V600E melanoma. Compensatory mechanism of acquired-resistance
  primarily involves Ras activation in response to upstream RTKs signaling such as
  FGFR3, PDGFRβ, or IGF-1R. Ras activation induces resistance to B-RAF inhibition
  primarily by reactivation of RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, and activation of alternate signaling
  pathways such as PI3K/Akt in certain context (, ). In addition, COT activation was
  also reported as a potential compensatory mechanism to compromise B-RAF inhibition
  (). A second major resistant mechanism is vemurafenib treatment-induced genetic
  mutations that result in reactivation of ERK signaling. The mutations identified
  to date include N-Ras Q61K/R (), MEK C121S (), or K-Ras K117N ().
