caption: Model depicting the dual pathways by which S. Typhimurium is targeted by
  autophagy in mammals and the conserved role for PKC in the regulation of this process
  in both mammals and yeast. Data is consistent with two independent pathways for
  induction of antibacterial autophagy in mammalian cells (DAG and ubiquitin pathways).
  Dashed line and question mark between pathways represents the possibility that the
  two pathways may interact with each other.
