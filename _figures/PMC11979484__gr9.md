caption: Schematic diagram of Hi-Exos in relieving the senescence of NPCs and IDD.
  Hi-Exos was superior to Exos in relieving the senescence of NPCs and IDD for the
  increased epigenetic factor miR-221-3p level. In details, Hi-Exos transferred the
  miR-221-3p to the senescent NPCs to decrease the DDIT4 protein level in senescent
  NPCs, which further inhibited the activation of NF-κB signalling pathway to relieve
  the senescence of NPCs and repair the IDD
