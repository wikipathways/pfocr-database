caption: Gemcitabine causes replicative stress by irreversibly inhibiting ribonucleotide
  reductase and thereby decreasing dNTP concentration. Decreased dNTP concentration
  causes stalled replication forks. In response to this replicative stress, the ATR/CHK1/WEE1
  pathway is activated and this leads to stabilization of the replicative forks. However,
  inhibitors of the ATR/CHK1/WEE1 pathway block this compensatory pathway. This leads
  to persistence of unstable replication forks and ultimately causes genomic catastrophe
  leading to cancer cell death.
