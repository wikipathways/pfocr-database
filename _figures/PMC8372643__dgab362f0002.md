caption: 'Role of HIF1α-PFKFB3 signaling in angiogenesis. (A) Retinal nonperfusion
  and ischemia promote hypoxia, which activates HIF1α. HIF1α activates different angiogenic
  factors, including VEGF (orange dots), to increase blood reperfusion and oxygen
  delivery. As a HIF1α target gene, PFKFB3 is implicated in the tip cell phenotype
  and vessel sprouting. (B) Targeting HIF1α-PFKFB3 signaling may prevent sprouting
  and abnormal vessel formation. (C) HIF1α-PFKFB3 signaling and its biological mediator
  F2,6P2 promote tip-cell competition by initiating the VEGF-DLL4-Notch signaling
  circuit. VEGF activates VEGFR2, which upregulates PFKFB3 levels and increases glycolysis
  and the expression of Notch ligand—DLL4. DLL4 binds to the Notch receptor of stalk
  cells, activates NICD; the latter, in turn, exerting negative feedback on VEGFR2
  signaling in the stalk cells. This signaling cascade results in the glycolytic tip
  cells with high DLL4 and VEGF expression and less glycolytic stalk cells with high
  Notch signaling, directly involved in vessel sprouting. Abbreviations: DLL4, delta-like
  ligand 4; F2,6P2, fructose-2,6-biphosphate 2; FBPase1, fructose-1,6-biphosphatase
  1; NICD, Notch 1 intracellular domain; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor;
  VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.'
