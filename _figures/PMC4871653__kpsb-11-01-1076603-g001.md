caption: 'Proposed pathway for urea and nitrate acquisition in root cells. Comparison
  of 3 treatments containing nitrogen in the form of: (A), urea alone (orange dots);
  (B), nitrate alone (green dots); or (C), urea plus nitrate. Blue rectangles, transporters
  belonging to HATS (i.e. DUR3, NRT2s); blue ovals, transporters belonging to LATS
  (i.e., PIPs, NIPs, NRT1s); line arrows, enzymatic reactions for N-assimilation;
  dashed arrows, feedback regulation on acquisition systems by N-sources itself or
  by metabolic products; bold arrows, activation of an assimilatory pathway; blue
  triangle, translocation of amino acids to the sink organs (A, B): putative response
  of root cells when a single N source (urea or nitrate) is available in the external
  solution. The acquisition of urea (or nitrate) is induced by N source and the source
  is rapidly accumulated in the cytosol. To overcome cytotoxic levels of urea (or
  nitrate), a feedback regulation on transport systems are activated by substrate
  itself or by N-metabolic products. Concerning the feedback regulation of urea-HATS,
  it might involve a putative post-transcriptional modification or re-targeting of
  DUR3 protein using a trafficking pathway (such as the trans-Golgi network, TGN).
  C: when both N-sources are present, root cells are more efficient in the acquisition
  of urea and nitrate through the enhancement and cooperation between assimilatory
  pathways, cytosolic and plastidial ones. This mechanisms might even allow a better
  control on the homeostasis of urea and nitrate in the cytosol, with no need for
  a feedback regulation on the uptake. Drawing of plant has been modified from http://udl.concord.org/artwork/plant_34/pl_34_index.html.'
