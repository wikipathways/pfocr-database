caption: cGAS-STING pathway in the liver plays a key role in mediating NAFLD/NASH/ALD.
  Mitochondrial stress caused by methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diets, high-fat
  diets (HFD), free fatty acids (FFAs), and LPS leads to the release of mtDNA. In
  hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells, mtDNA activation triggers inflammatory responses
  similar to those in adipocytes, resulting in elevated inflammation, lipid accumulation,
  and liver fibrosis through proinflammatory cytokine production. The transport of
  cGAMP from hepatocytes to immune cells via connexin 32 (CX32) spreads these inflammatory
  effects. In addition, alcohol-induced ER stress and LPS/TLR4 signaling can activate
  the cGAS-STING-IRF3 pathway, leading to apoptosis. However, IRF3 also suppresses
  Scd1 transcription through TLR3/TRIF signaling, which inhibits adipogenesis
