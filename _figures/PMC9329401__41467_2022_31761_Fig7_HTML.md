caption: High protein diet feeding promotes succinate production by the gut microbiota.
  High levels of luminal succinate induce gut bacterial cellular stress and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production, which promote vesiculation and increased production
  of microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles. Microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles
  can directly activate TLR4 expressed on the gut epithelium, activating downstream
  NFκB signalling that results in increased expression of APRIL, CCL28 and PIGR, which
  drives the T-cell-independent sIgA response. Increased TLR4 signalling also potentiates
  pro-inflammatory responses, resulting in more severe DSS-induced colitis. Increased
  intestinal succinate observed in IBD patients may contribute to disease pathology
  by promoting microbiota-derived extracellular vesicle production and the TLR4/NFκB
  signalling pathway.
