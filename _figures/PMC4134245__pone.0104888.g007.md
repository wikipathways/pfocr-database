caption: Low dose (0.1 mM) Met induces moderate AMPK activation which is followed
  by sequential activations of PKA, Src and PDGFR and results in protection of the
  cells from Dox toxicity. High dose (1.0 mM) Met also leads to the sequential activations
  of AMPK, PKA and Src. With both dosages of the Met treatment, Dox induced ROS generations
  and [Ca2+]i levels are suppressed. However, the excessive activities of AMPK with
  the high dose Met causes a suppression of PDGFR expression in cardiomyocytes and
  the protective effect of low dose Met is abrogated.
