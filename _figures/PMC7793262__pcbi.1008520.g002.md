caption: 'A: Representation of signaling pathways for regulatory macrophages and classification
  of signals as M1 (inflammatory) or M2 (anti-inflammatory). Every time a macrophage
  receives a signal on the specific pathway a counter is incremented representing
  the total stimulation level (e.g. stat1Counter). B: Schematic diagram of criteria
  for macrophage to myofibroblast transformation (MMT) that were implemented in GranSim
  following, namely that resting macrophages that have STAT1 and STAT3 signals and
  are not exposed to Mtb.'
