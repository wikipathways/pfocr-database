caption: 'a, Model yeast S. cerevisiae BY4741 has four auxotrophic markers of histidine,
  leucine, uracil and methionine, and the yeast prototrophy kit (pHLUM v.2 plasmids)35
  can be used to complement the auxotrophic markers. b, Auxotrophic markers in BY4741
  can be replaced with functional modules that facilitate co-culture design. We developed
  15 knockout strains: ade8Δ, ura3Δ, his3Δ, trp1Δ, tyr1Δ, pha2Δ, aro7Δ, leu2Δ, ilv1Δ,
  arg4Δ, lys2Δ, ser1Δ, cys4Δ, met14Δ and thr4Δ, which are auxotrophic to adenine,
  uracil, histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and phenylalanine,
  leucine, valine and isoleucine, arginine, lysine, serine, cysteine, methionine and
  threonine, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). One marker such as leu2∆ can be
  used to express different fluorescent proteins such as mTagBFP2, mScarlet-I and
  sfGFP, which can be used as fluorescent markers. One marker such as his3∆ can be
  used to express the genes that help the production of exchanged metabolites (emy),
  which can be used as metabolite donor. One marker such as met15∆ or CRIPSR-cas9
  tool can be used to express a heterologous high-value bioproduct synthesis pathway.
  c, An adenine auxotrophic strain was designed to pair with 13 other auxotrophic
  strains for co-culture potential in 4 different cross-feeding structures (ade-em
  I, ade-em II, ade-em III, ade-em IV). The auxotrophs for each metabolite, with and
  without adenine overproduction (ade4op overexpression) were co-cultured with the
  adenine auxotroph (ade8Δ) with and without the overexpression of genes involved
  in the overproduction of the metabolites to identify the syntrophic pairs. d, The
  maximal OD700 values of co-culture ade-em I and ade-em II within 72 h were ranked
  from strong to weak. N = 3 biologically independent samples and data are presented
  as mean ± s.d. One-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test
  with 95% confidence intervals were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5.0 software
  and P values are noted.Source data'
