caption: LRG1 can direct TGFβ signalling towards a specific pathway depending on the
  cell type and the context. During pathological angiogenesis/vascular dysfunction
  (left), LRG1 binds to Endoglin and switches the EC phenotype towards a pro-angiogenic
  state in an ALK1/SMAD-1,-5,-8-dependent fashion []. During fibrosis (right), LRG1
  was shown to promote differentiation of fibroblasts into matrix-producing myofibroblasts
  by favouring the ALK5/SMAD-2,-3 pathway in an Endoglin-independent way []. Created
