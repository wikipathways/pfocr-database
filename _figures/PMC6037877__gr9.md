caption: Proposed mechanisms by which transcription factor specificity protein 1 modulates
  TGFβ1 production to negatively regulate RANTES expression in macrophages stimulated
  with substance P. Substance P (SP) upregulates RANTES expression via the p38γδMAPK
  signaling pathway. TGFβ1 delays SP-induced internalization of NK1R and thus enhances
  signaling. SP also upregulates TGFβ1 by activation of the transcription factor C/EBPβ.
  In contrast, specificity protein 1 (Sp1) suppresses induction of TGFβ1 via cross-talk
  with C/EBPβ, thus influencing RANTES expression by macrophages after stimulation
  with SP.
