caption: Notch signaling pathway. The ligand on the receiving cell connects the cell
  that acts as a presenter for the notch receptor. ADAM metalloprotease and γ-secretase
  split the Notch extracellular truncated (NEXT) domain, forming the notch intracellular
  domain (NICD). NICD is introduced into the nucleus and is a complex of transcription
  factors CSL 9 CBF1/hairless/lack 1 and transcriptional coactivator of mastermind-like
  proteins (MAML). The complex would then activate the target gene’s transcription.
  Treatment with diallyl trisulfide (DATS) boosts the expression of tumor suppressor
  microRNAs miR-143 and miR-145. When microRNAs bind to Notch1 mRNA, the mRNA is degraded,
  but the Notch1 protein is not translated. Curcumin inhibits Notch1 transcription
  and expression and the nucleus’ Hes-1, Hey-1, and Hey-2 genes ().
