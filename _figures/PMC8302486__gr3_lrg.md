caption: The role of IFN β in antiviral activity. 1, The IFN binds the IFNAR on the
  cell surface and initiates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway inducing ISGS which encodes
  IFITM, PAI-1, OASL, ZAP and ISG20, etc.; 2, PAI-1 inhibits TMPRSS2 that cleaves
  ACE-2 bound spike protein of SARS- COV-2; 3, IFITM3 inhibits the viral ssRNA release
  into the cytoplasm through endosome and initiates lysosomal degradation of the virus;
  4, OAS activates RNase L that effectively degrades viral RNA; 5, ZAP senses and
  attaches to viral RNA, followed by recruiting RNA exosome that eventually degrades
  viral RNA; 6, The ISG20 inhibits viral replication by impairing protein translation.

  inhibitor; CTSB/L cathepsin B/L; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; PKR, protein kinase
  R; OASL, 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase like; IKK, IκB kinase complex; NF κB, nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of an activated B cell; eIFα2, eukaryotic initiation
  factor α 2; IFN β, interferon β; IFNAR, interferon-alpha/beta receptor; Jak 1, Janus
  kinase 1; Tyk 2, tyrosine kinase 2; STAT 1 and 2, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 1 and 2; IRF 9, interferon regulatory factor 9.
