caption: In this scenario age (representing the effect of time in relation to genetic,
  epigenetic and environmental interactions) is the dominant underlying major pathway.
  All progressive glomerular diseases impact progression through effects on podocyte
  number or glomerular volume or both. The net effect is to drive progressive reduction
  in podoyte density which triggers further podocyte detachment, tuft collapse and
  glomerulosclerosis. These processes including downstream proteinuria drive tubule-interstitial
  inflammation and scarring. Parallel age-associated NFκB-driven processes (arterioscelerosis
  and glomerular aging) further amplify these processes (,). According to this scenario
  the central elements common to all glomerular disease progression (glomerular volume
  and podocyte number) will be determinative of outcome and represent major unrecognized
  opportunities for therapeutic intervention.
