caption: Effects of NO and nitrosative stress on apoptosis. NO-mediated effect on
  cell viability and death has been carefully characterized in the last years. For
  example, Bcl-2 has been reported to be S-nitrosylated and thus modified to be stabilized
  and not degraded by the Ubiquitin/proteasome system. Cytochrome c has been also
  indicated to undergo S-nitrosylation in order to bind Apaf1 and procaspase-9 and
  promote the assembling of the apoptosome. Zymogen procaspase-9, and the executioner
  pro-caspase3, remain in a quiescent (inactive) form since they are S-nitrosylated
  in their catalytic cysteine residue in order to avoid unwanted activation of death
  program. Upon apoptotic stimulus, Trxs are able to denitrosylate caspases, thereby
  allowing their proteolytic activation and the progression of the apoptotic events
  downstream it. Recently, it has been also highlighted that the recruitment of the
  death receptor Fas to lipid rafts of plasma membrane upon binding to its ligand
  (FasL) is enhanced by S-nitrosylation of Cys304 of its cytoplasmic domain (DD, death
  domain). In this case S-nitrosylation positively affects the execution of apoptosis
  that takes place directly via the caspase-8-initiated extrinsic route or can synergize
  with the mitochondrial pathway through the proteolytic activation of the proapoptotic
  protein Bid in its truncated form (t-Bid).
