caption: 'Probable mechanism of association of radiation-induced ROS with hypogonadism
  and ED. Nonionizing radiations damage the Leydig cells, which reduces testosterone
  synthesis and subsequent inhibition of spermatozoa. Such radiations negatively affect
  sperm parameters, including count, motility, morphology, viability and motility.
  Nonionizing radiations also stimulate NO activity, which along with ROS, brings
  about lipid peroxidation and damage to testicular tissues. These tissues are also
  damaged by apoptosis mediated by elevated ROS levels. Nonionizing radiation-induced
  ROS further causes DNA damage and decreases the concentration of histone kinase
  along with a reduction of SOD and glutathione peroxidase activity. Whereas ionizing
  radiations cause a decline in testosterone production by damaging Leydig cells and
  by inhibiting the activity of steroidogenic enzymes. Such radiations enhance LDH
  activity, which results in cellular damage. Damage to the penile smooth muscles
  and reduced ICP may cause ED. ED is also caused by decreased cGMP levels and damage
  to the corpus cavernosum, which are brought about by ionizing radiation-induced
  oxidative stress. Red arrows represent the increase and decrease of the respective
  substances and sperm parameters beyond harmful levels. (NO: nitric oxide, SOD: superoxide
  dismutase, LDH: lactate dehydrogenase, ICP: intracavernosal pressure, ODO: oxadiazoloquinoxalin-1-one,
  cGMP: cyclic guanosine monophosphate, ED: erectile dysfunction, ROS: reactive oxygen
  species).'
