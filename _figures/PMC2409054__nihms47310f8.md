caption: A novel signaling network communication among RTKs, GPCRs, and the purinergic
  P2X7 receptor. In human cervical epithelial cells, EGF, acting via the MAPK cascade
  pathway, stimulates mitosis and proliferation. EGF also facilitates β2-adrenoceptor-dependent
  stimulation of deglycosylation and degradation of the P2X7 receptor. The effect
  of EGF involves attenuation of β2-adrenoceptor internalization by a PI3K-dependent
  mechanism and facilitated recycling of the β2-adrenoceptor by a PI3K-independent
  mechanism. The EGF effects on β2-adrenoceptor endocytosis and recycling would tend
  to up-regulate β2-adrenoceptor responsiveness by increasing the pool of the receptor
  that is available for activation upon ligand binding. The composite effects of EGF
  and epinephrine would tend to facilitate inhibition of P2X7 receptor-dependent pore
  formation and apoptosis. The combined EGF mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects would
  lead to an increase in cell number and to epithelial growth. PKA, Protein kinase
  A.
