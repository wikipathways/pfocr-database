caption: Model for σE-dependent regulation of the SsrB regulon. Membrane-targeting
  host defences including reactive oxygen stress and antimicrobial peptides cause
  an accumulation of unfolded outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and stimulate the cleavage
  of the anti-sigma factor RseA consequently releasing σE into the cytoplasm where
  it directs RNA polymerase to a subset of SPI-2 promoters. RpoE can positively or
  negatively regulate SsrB-regulated genes including integrated virulence genes unlinked
  with SPI-2 but has no effect on some effector genes such as sseL. This regulatory
  pathway may have evolved to coordinate virulence gene expression with host infection
  by responding to host-specific defence pathways that perturb the bacterial outer
  membrane.
