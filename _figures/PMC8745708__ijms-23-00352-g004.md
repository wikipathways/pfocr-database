caption: 'A consequence of NF1 loss of function in cancer: NF1 deficiency prevents
  inactivation of Ras through GTP hydrolysis and leads to upregulation of Ras signalling.
  It is associated with increased tumour proliferation, EMT, invasion, cell motility,
  and therapy resistance. Moreover, the hyperphosphorylation of LIMK1 in Ras- or LIMK2
  in a ROCK-dependent manner results in the activation of cofilin pathways, which
  leads to changes in actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. The inability of the C-terminal
  domain of neurofibromin to bind to focal adhesion kinase and syndecan-2 induces
  cell detachment and might facilitate the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. This
  process is supported by the upregulation of FOSL1 and increased secretion of chitinase-3-like
  protein 1 (CHI3L1). Loss of NF1 changes also the tumour microenvironment and angiogenesis
  by the enhanced secretion of platelet-derived growth factor AA (PDGF-AA) and interleukin-8
  (IL-8). In patients with NF1, the somatic NF1 hit accompanies a germline mutation
  (NF1 -/-), which corresponds to a complete loss of function of neurofibromin, a
  classical tumour suppressor. In non-NF1-associated NF1-altered GBM, the somatic
  NF1 hit accompanies other primary genetic alterations that might act similar, e.g.,
  affect the MAPK pathway. Created with BioRender (ZE2345L4TH, 24 October 2021).'
