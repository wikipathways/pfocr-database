caption: CSCs drug resistance methodology. Cancer stem cells have developed multiple
  mechanisms to resist chemo- and radiotherapy. The nuclei of CSCs retain lower levels
  of reactive oxygen species, resulting in less DNA damage. The DNA damage response
  pathway is preferentially activated allowing for increased DNA repair capacity.
  A modified epigenetic signature can prevent CSCs from undergoing apoptosis through
  repression of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein activity. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters
  efficiently pump chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cell. The ALDH1 enzyme can effectively
  oxidize and inactivate certain bioactive metabolic drugs. IAP proteins block the
  function of death caspases preempting cell death. UroCa stem cells upregulate the
  expression of CD47 to prevent phagocytosis by macrophages
