caption: Schematic illustration of cholinergic regulation in the striatum. ChIs exert
  influences on striatal function by regulating multiple targets (arrows). Activation
  of ChIs can reduce glutamatergic transmission to MSNs of both pathways via M2 and
  M4 mAChRs, trigger dopamine release from their terminals through nAChRs and generate
  feedback inhibition via M4 receptors. Although MSNs of both the direct and indirect
  pathways express M1 receptors, which increase the excitability of a neuron when
  activated, the direct pathway is inhibited by acetylcholine because of the high
  expression level of M4 receptors
