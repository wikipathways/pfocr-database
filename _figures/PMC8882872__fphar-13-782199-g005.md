caption: Regulation of NF-κB in CKD. (1) Common NF-κB dimer pairs include p65/RelA
  and p50 in the canonical pathway and RelB and p52 in the non-canonical pathway.
  Non-canonical cell signals may antagonize canonical cell signals in fibroblasts.
  (2) AHR dimerizes with RelB in the production of IL-8. AHR or PPAR-γ activation
  promotes ubiquitination and degradation of p65/RelA. (3) Estrogen activates estrogen
  receptors (ER-α/β) to produce the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα, and promotes the recruitment
  of ER-β to p65 binding sites, which blocks p65 transcriptional activity. (4) Heat
  shock protein (HSP)-90 is a chaperone shared by ER-α/β, PPAR-γ, AHR, and canonical
  NF-κB. (5) Elevated levels of p65/RelA, RelB, and HSP90 are found in CKD patient
  serum.
