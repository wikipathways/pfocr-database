caption: A model for the Q Tyr-28-mediated csfB regulatory pathway. After asymmetric
  division and during engulfment (early, left), transcription of the csfB gene is
  activated by σF in the forespore. In turn, the produced CsfB protein acts as an
  inhibitor of σG, helping to prevent its premature activation. After the completion
  of forespore engulfment (late, right), the transcription of csfB by σG is prevented
  by a conserved csfB promoter element, which we propose is a binding site for a repressor
  protein (Rep). The cessation of csfB transcription limits CsfB production to promote
  maximal σG activation. A highly conserved tyrosine (Tyr-28; Y) in the TMD of Q (whose
  gene is also activated by σF [not shown]) is also required for the inhibition of
  σG-dependent csfB transcription. Q is known to assemble into a channel apparatus
  with the mother cell proteins AA-AH (A-H) and to form a direct interaction with
  AH (H). This channel is generally required for gene expression at late times in
  the forespore, including that directed by σG; as such, it has been proposed to serve
  as a feeding tube through which the mother cell provides nutrients required for
  macromolecular synthesis (as shown). A separate subpopulation of Q is also known
  to interact with the SpoIIE phosphatase (IIE), an interaction that we have shown
  in the current study to be dependent specifically on Q Tyr-28. We propose that this
  subpopulation of Q, in collaboration with SpoIIE, positively regulates the csfB
  repressor protein by an unknown mechanism. However, we cannot rule out other scenarios,
  including the possibility that SpoIIE is not involved and/or that Q interacts with
  yet another partner via Tyr-28 to effect csfB regulation. Regardless, our data support
  the conclusion that Q is a bifunctional protein that (i) generally activates σG,
  through its assembly into the AA-AH·Q channel, and (ii) specifically maximizes the
  activity of σG, through participation in a gene regulatory circuit that represses
  expression of the gene encoding the anti-σG factor CsfB.
