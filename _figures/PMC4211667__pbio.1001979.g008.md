caption: In conventional two-component signaling systems, an HK receives a signal
  in the sensor region and ultimately promotes phosphorylation of a response regulator.
  In contrast, DivL repurposes its RR docking surface and canonical output domain
  as a sensory module for DivK∼P. Upon binding DivK∼P, DivL causes the repression
  of the CtrA differentiation pathway, potentially through conformational remodeling
  of the DivL PAS sensor domains.
