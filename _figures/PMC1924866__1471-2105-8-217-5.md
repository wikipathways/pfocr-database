caption: Striped view of multiple time-point comparisons. Gene expression data from
  mouse uterine smooth muscle from mid-to-late pregnancy through postpartum are shown
  as striped color sets on a pathway for prostaglandin synthesis and regulation. For
  each comparison, a separate color set was generated, with eight colors designating
  different fold thresholds. The order of the criteria dictates the priority for how
  a gene box is colored. For this dataset, the striped view allows comparison of expression
  changes that are predicted to promote versus block contraction during distinct phases
  of pregnancy. Multiple probe sets from the microarray linking to a gene are indicated
  by a dashed edge around the gene box. The central color of the gene box corresponds
  to the predominant criterion met (mode) and the rim colors represent the second
  most prevalent criterion met.

  description: Striped view of multiple time-point comparisons. Gene expression data
    from mouse uterine smooth muscle from mid-to-late pregnancy through postpartum
    are shown as striped color sets on a pathway for prostaglandin synthesis and regulation.

    how a gene box is colored. For this dataset, the striped view allows comparison
    of expression changes that are predicted to promote versus block contraction during
