caption: Schematic representation of potyvirus interactions with plant UPR, autophagy,
  and cell death pathways. This diagram illustrates the interactions between potyviruses
  and the UPR, highlighting the modulation of key cellular pathways, including autophagy,
  and cell death. SMV P3 interacts with cellular EF1A to inhibit the UPR and trigger
  cell death. SCMV P1 blocks bZIP60 mRNA splicing, suppressing the IRE1-mediated UPR
  pathway. TuMV (turnip mosaic virus) and PVY (potato virus Y) 6K2 proteins activate
  both IRE1- and bZIP28-mediated UPR pathways. In addition, TuMV and other potyvirus
  6K2 proteins are associated with the ER to form VRCs. Potyviral proteins NIb and
  VPg-Pro localize to the nucleus, where they are hypothesized to influence the transcriptional
  activities of bZIP60 and bZIP28. Mature VRCs bud off and merge with multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs), incorporating autophagy-related factors, such as NBR1, ATG8f, and
  Beclin-1, which promote viral replication. These autophagy receptors may also facilitate
  the turnover of viral replication proteins. In some cases, VRC–MVB complexes are
  transported to the cell wall, whereas others are directed to viral cylindrical inclusions
  and plasmodesmata to enhance cell-to-cell movement. Additional VRCs interact with
  chloroplasts. The interconnections between the UPR, autophagy, and cell death pathways
  underscore the complex strategies employed by potyviruses to manipulate host cellular
  processes during infection. bZIP28, basic leucine zipper 28; bZIP60, basic leucine
  zipper 60; EF1A, eukaryotic elongation factor 1A; SMV, soybean mosaic virus; TuMV,
  turnip mosaic virus; UPR, unfolded protein response; VRC, viral replication complex
