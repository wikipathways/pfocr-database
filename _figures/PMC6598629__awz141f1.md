caption: The supraspinal locomotor network. This schematic drawing displays the supraspinal
  network for locomotor control. Cortical signals convey motor commands to the mesencephalic
  locomotor regions (MLR) via the basal ganglia, through the striato-pallidal and
  the striato-subthalamic-pallidal pathways, and via the hyper-direct pathway that
  directly links the SMA with the STN. Locomotor plans reach the MLR, which represents
  a cross-point of information coming from the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, and
  further descend to the pontomedullary reticular formation (PMRF) and to the spinal
  central pattern generators (CPGs). The investigated nodes are highlighted in yellow.
  The pathways of feedforward motor commands are displayed as red (activating) and
  blue (inhibiting) arrows, while those of sensory feedback are displayed as grey
  arrows. CRB = cerebellum; GPe = globus pallidus pars externa; GPi = globus pallidus
  pars interna; M1 = primary motor cortex; PC = parietal cortex; SN = substantia nigra;
  STR = striatum; TH = thalamus.
