caption: 'A. The paradox of INS/IGF activity: high activity promotes growth but limits
  longevity.B. Signaling is regulated by phosphorylation (yellow symbols) through
  a highly conserved pathway, which is shown here for mammalian IGF-1. Receptor activation
  by ligand binding generates PIP3 and can be blocked by PTEN. AKT phosphorylation
  turns on a growth pathway that acts through mTOR and is blocked by 4E-BP (not shown)
  and turns off FOXO activity in the nucleus, which otherwise causes cell cycle arrest.'
