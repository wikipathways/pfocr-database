caption: Proposed urea assimilatory pathway in Arabidopsis. Urea is synthesized inside
  mitochondria during Arg degradation via arginase in the Orn or urea cycle. Arginase-derived
  urea is then exported to cytoplasm and hydrolyzed by urease. Urea-derived ammonium
  is assimilated into Gln via GS; then, GOGAT catalyzes the formation of Glu via the
  GS-GOGAT cycle. AAT, Asp aminotransferase; AL, arginosuccinate lyase; AS, arginosuccinate
  synthetase; ASN, Asn synthetase; GDH, Glu dehydrogenase; NiR, nitrite reductase;
  NR, nitrate reductase; OCT, Orn carbamyl transferase.
