caption: Schematic illustration of interplay between host metabolism and cytokine
  induction. Upon infection, pattern recognition receptors (such as Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs), retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and cytosolic
  sensors (cGAS)) sense pathogen-associated molecular pattern and dimerize with their
  cognate adaptor molecules to activate IKKαβ and TBK-1/IKKε. These kinases in turn
  activate IRF3 and NF-κB, thereby promoting cytokine production. Central metabolic
  pathways, including the glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and lipid metabolism,
  are crucial for cell proliferation and viral replication. The immune-modulating
  effect of metabolism can stem from metabolites, metabolic enzymes and organelles.
  Conversely, the metabolism-programming activity of cytokine response can originate
  from immune signaling components or cytokine signaling thereof. Mitochondria serve
  as an excellent example that integrates diverse players at the interface of immune
  response and metabolism. Metabolites, such as succinate and citrate, directly or
  indirectly regulate NF-κB activation. Metabolic enzymes (e.g., mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) and adenosine 5′-monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK))
  play regulatory roles in both metabolism and immune responses. Metabolic organelles,
  such as mitochondria and lysosomes, deploy multiple strategies to interfere with
  pathogen replication and reprogram metabolic activity for intrinsic immune defense,
  via modulating mitochondrial fission and fusion (e.g., Mfn2) and activating the
  autophagy-lysosome degradative pathway. Blue arrows represent cellular metabolic
  processes and orange arrows indicate innate immune signaling pathways.
