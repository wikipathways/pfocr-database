caption: 'Regulation of NF-kB/E2F/Rb and p53/p21 pathways by proteasome.NF-kB/E2F/Rb
  pathway: under unstimulated conditions, NF-kB is kept inactive in the cytosol by
  IkB inhibitor. Different stimuli (e.g., cytokines, stressors, Pathogen Associated
  Molecular Patterns), generically indicated as green spheres on membrane receptors,
  phosphorylate and activate IKKBγ subunit which thereafter phosphorylate IkB through
  the kinase activity held by the α and β subunits. Phosphorylated IkB is ubiquitinated
  and degraded by the 26S proteasome. Free NF-kB dimers translocate into the nucleus,
  where transcription of target genes occurs. Cyclin D1 (CCDN1) expression allows
  the cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 complex to form. This complex phosphorylates Rb protein, inducing
  its detachment from EF2 transcription factor. Free EF2 enters the nucleus and transcribes
  cyclin E (not shown), cyclin A and genes involved in DNA synthesis: this triggers
  the progression toward the S-phase.p53/p21 pathway: under physiological conditions,
  p53 degradation is predominantly orchestrated by the E3-ligase MDM2, which promotes
  its poly-ubiquitination, and, thus, its degradation by the 26S proteasome. A number
  of stimuli activate the p53 pathway, inducing its tetramerization and translocation
  into the nucleus. Herein, p53 triggers the transcription of pro-apoptotic factors
  (i.e., Noxa and Bax, not shown) and CdkI p21. When expressed, p21 binds to: (i)
  Cdk2/cyclin E (CCNE1) complex, blocking the entry of the cell into the S phase;
  (ii) cyclin B (CCNB1)/Cdk1 complex, leading to a growth arrest in the G2 phase;
  (iii) PCNA, inhibiting DNA replication. p21 levels are also modulated through the
  ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the 26S, and further by a ubiquitin -independent
  pathway by the 20S.Figure legend is restricted to NF-kB and p53, whose mechanisms
  of transcription induction is not sketched. PIs stands for Proteasome Inhibitors
  and the red arrows indicate the steps of NF-kB, p53 and p21 turn-over which are
  blocked by this class of drugs.'
