caption: 'In cells infected by JEV, SeV or treated with 5’pppRNA, RIG-I signaling
  is strongly activated; through the NF-κB and IRF3 cascades this pathway induces
  the production of IFNα/β and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα through an autocrine/paracrine
  manner that synergistically upregulates STING expression. By a positive feedback
  mechanism, induction of STING contributes to a sustained inflammatory response that
  protects treated cells from infection, including DNA virus infection. Abbreviations

  virus; HCV hepatitis C virus; 5’pppRNA, 5’-triphosphorylated RNA; TRAF, TNF receptor
  associated factor; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein; RIG-I, Retinoic
  acid inducible gene-I; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; IκB, inhibitor of kappa B; IKK, IκB kinase; IRF, interferon regulatory
  factor; IFNα/β, Interferon α/β; IFNAR: IFNα receptor; JAK, Janus kinase; TYK: tyrosine
  kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; ISGF3, IFN-stimulated
