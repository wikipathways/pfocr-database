caption: Impact of miR-140 overexpression on proteins involved in the NFKB signaling
  pathway. NFKB activators (upper right corner) and target genes (in the nucleus)
  of NFKB were downregulated by miR-140, while two inhibitors were upregulated (upper
  left corner). IL1B binds to IL1R1. This activates IRAK kinases and the IKK complex
  which phosphorylates the NFKB inhibitor IKB. Phosphorylated IKB is then ubiquitinated
  and degraded in the proteasome. This releases NFKB. NFKB1 or -2 heterodimerizes
  with REL, RELA or RELB, translocates into the nucleus and turns on transcription
  of NFKB target genes. IL1B, interleukin 1β.
