caption: D2R decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the kidney by increasing
  the expressions of HO-2, PON2, and DJ-1 and inhibiting NFκB activity (NFκB increases
  NQO1 expression). Nrf2 transcription and activity are increased by oxidative stress.
  Oxidation of cysteine SH groups of KEAP 1 by ROS releases Nrf2 allowing its translocation
  into the nucleus where it binds to antioxidant response element (ARE), increasing
  the expression of antioxidant proteins such as NQO1, GST, and its own (Nrf2) expression.
  DJ-1 prevents the ubiquitination of Nrf2 and therefore, its degradation.
