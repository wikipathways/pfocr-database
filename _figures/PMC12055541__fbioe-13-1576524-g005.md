  ① TLR4/NF-κB Pro-inflammatory Pathway. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
  activate TLR4, which triggers the MyD88-dependent pathway. This leads to IKK phosphorylation,
  promoting NF-κB (P65/P50) nuclear translocation. Consequently, pro-inflammatory
  cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α are released, sustaining the M1 macrophage phenotype and
  amplifying inflammation. ② NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation. Excessive ROS and ATP
  accumulation activates NLRP3, which recruits ASC and caspase-1. This cascade enhances
  IL-1β and TNF-α secretion, reinforcing M1 macrophage polarization and inflammation.
  Additionally, a positive feedback loop further elevates ROS levels, exacerbating
  tissue damage. ③ JAK/STAT Pathway and M2 Macrophage Polarization. IL-4 and IL-10
  stimulate JAK phosphorylation, activating STAT3/6. This shift promotes M2 macrophage
  differentiation, upregulating Arg1 and CD206 while reducing inflammation. ④ PI3K/Akt
  Pathway for Cell Survival and Repair. BDNF and IGF-1 activate PI3K, leading to Akt
  phosphorylation. This suppresses GSK-3β and increases IL-10 and TGF-β, enhancing
  M2 macrophage polarization and neuroprotection. ⑤ Nrf2 Antioxidant Pathway. Reduced
  oxidative stress promotes Keap1 degradation, freeing Nrf2 to enter the nucleus.
  Nrf2 induces HO-1, NQO1, and GPX4 expression, neutralizing ROS and mitigating inflammation.
  ⑥ ROS and Apoptotic Pathway. Lower ROS levels inhibit the JNK/P38 pathway, reducing
  Bax expression while increasing Bcl-2. This prevents cytochrome c release, ultimately
  suppressing Caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, promoting cell survival (Created in https://BioRender.com)
