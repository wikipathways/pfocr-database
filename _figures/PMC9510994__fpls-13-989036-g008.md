caption: Schematic presentation of terpenoid biosynthetic pathway in LJFs of ‘Yujin2’
  compared to ‘Fengjin1’. The upregulated, downregulated, mix-regulated, and unchanged
  genes (bold fonts) and metabolites (small circles) in ‘Yujin2’ are represented in
  red, blue, yellow, and gray, respectively. The scale bars adjacent to the name of
  genes or metabolites are picked from the heatmaps for the transcriptome () and metabolome
  (). The first three and the latter three squares of a bar represent the normalized
  abundance values of DEGs or DAVs from ‘Yujin2’ and ‘Fengjin1’, respectively. Red
  and blue colors reflect high and low expression levels, respectively. The asterisk
  followed by the gene name indicate that the gene expression was validated by qRT-PCR.
  The solid line, dashed line, and dotted line indicate a single-step reaction, a
  multi-step reaction, and the movement of substances, respectively. 3β-HSDD, plant
