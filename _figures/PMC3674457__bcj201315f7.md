caption: Schematic model of raft-mediated Akt signaling in the regulation of cell
  survival and death in MCL cells during edelfosine treatment. This scheme highlights
  the importance of lipid raft membrane domains for PI3K/Akt pathway activation in
  the regulation of MCL cell survival or death, based on the data reported here. For
  further details, see the text.
