caption: 'Schematic of the MET signaling pathway and the sites of action for MET targeted
  therapies. (A) The MET signaling pathway with downstream intracellular signaling
  and transcription of genes leading to enhanced morphogenesis, cell survival, motility,
  proliferation, and invasion. MET is activated by its ligand, HGF, and the MET receptor
  can interact in various ways with the EGFR receptor. (B) The MET targeted therapies
  presented according to specific targets, either extracellular or intracellular.
  The pipe-line drugs are highlighted in cursive. MET: mesenchymal epithelial transition
  factor, HGF: hepatocyte growth factor, EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor, SRC:
  v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homolog, PI3K: phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase, GRB2: growth factor receptor-bound protein 2, GAB1: GRB2-associated binding
  protein 1, SHC: src homology 2 domain-containing, SOS: son of sevenless, RAS: rat
  sarcoma, RAF: rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, MEK: MAPK effector kinase, ERK:
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase, RAC1: ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate
  1, JNK: janus kinase 1, AKT: ak strain transforming, NF-kB: nuclear factor kappa
  B, mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin, FAK: focal adhesion kinase, STAT3: signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3, ATP: adenosine triphosphate. Created
