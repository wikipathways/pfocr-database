caption: 'Anoikis signaling pathway in cancer cells. Cell detachment-induced anoikis
  signaling can be activated via three pathways: (1) the extrinsic death receptor-mediated
  apoptotic pathway, (2) the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and (3) the caspase-independent
  pathway. In the first pathway, activation of Fas/FADD leads to cleavage of caspase-8
  and subsequently activates downstream caspase-3 to facilitate apoptosis. In the
  second pathway, Cell-ECM interaction mediates integrin-induced activation of Talin1,
  FAK/Src and ILK-1. ILK-1 activation leads to phosphorylation of GSK3β and subsequent
  recruitment of Snail, which ultimately activates the PI3-K/Akt cell survival pathway.
  The loss of cell-ECM interaction contributes to upregulated proapoptotic proteins,
  such as Bim and downregulated antiapoptotic regulatory proteins, such as Bcl-2.
  The above changes activate cytochrome C release from the mitochondria, which subsequently
  activates caspase-9 and -3 to induce apoptosis. In the third pathway, upon cancer
  cell loss of the ECM interaction, the AES/TLE1 heterooligomers are translocated
  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm; subsequent downregulation of TLE1 by the proteasome
  results in the activation of the death signaling pathway.'
