caption: 'Exhausted T cells in the TME are characterized by the coexpression of multiple
  inhibitory molecules, including PD-1 and CTLA4. There are several signaling pathways
  potentially involved in the development of T-cell exhaustion within the TME: a PD-1/PDL1
  signaling can antagonize TCR signaling by preventing the phosphorylation of the
  TCR-proximal signaling molecules Lck and ZAP70. b, c PD-1/PD-L1 signaling inhibits
  the TCR/CD28-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways to
  induce cell cycle arrest through p27- and p15-mediated cascades. CTLA-4 binding
  to CD80/86 activates the phosphatase PP2A, directly inhibits Akt/mTOR signaling
  and promotes cell cycle arrest in T cells. d PD-1/PDL1 signaling induces the transcription
  of exhaustion-related molecules and suppresses the transcription of effector molecules
  regulated by the transcription factors NFAT and BATF, respectively. e The inhibition
  of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling mediated by either PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA4 results in decreases
  in glycolysis and amino acid metabolism and suppresses the metabolic regulator PGC1α
  and mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, glucose deprivation decreases the concentration
  of the glycolytic metabolite PEP and subsequently inactivates the Ca2+-NFAT signaling
  pathway to suppress T-cell effector functions. In addition, cholesterol accumulation
  in the TME induces T-cell exhaustion via the molecular regulation of ER stress.
