caption: Schematic illustration showing the proposed mechanism by which FABP5 promotes
  LNM of CCa by regulating FA metabolism. FABP5 is directly targeted by miR-144-3p.
  Then, FABP5 promotes LD lipolysis and FA synthesis in CCa cells. Subsequently, the
  increase in intracellular FAs produced by FA metabolic alteration activates the
  NF-κB pathway, resulting in EMT, lymphangiogenesis, and LNM in CCa.
