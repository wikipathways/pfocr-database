caption: Schema of pathways producing and utilizing endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived
  H2O2. Reduced thiols (-SH) of cysteine residues in nascent proteins are oxidized
  by catalytically competent protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) to promote protein
  folding with native disulfide bonds (S-S). PDI can be re-oxidized by ERO1, with
  flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) embedded in its active site, which reduces molecular
  oxygen (O2) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). ER-resident antioxidants PRDX4, GPX7, and
  GPX8 oxidize their catalytic domain by utilizing H2O2 (-SOH = sulfenic acid) and
  mediate “the disulphide relay” to PDI. NOX4 produces H2O2 over superoxide on the
  ER membrane, unlike other NOX family proteins. Reproduced from Konno et al. (2021)
