caption: miR156-based regulation of SPL13 enhances photosynthesis, phenylpropanoid,
  and ABA biosynthesis in response to flooding. (A) Illustration of reduced Glycolysis
  and TCA cycle with an enhanced phenylpropanoid pathway in flood-stressed SPL13RNAi
  plants based on differentially expressed genes, (B) MapMan-based pathway analysis
  illustrating Photosystem I and II associated increased transcript abundance along
  with electron transport chain in miR156-A8 plants compared to WT plants during FS,
  (C) Total monomeric anthocyanin in Gallic acid equivalents, (D) enrichment of ABA
  biosynthesis in SPL13RNAi plants upon flooding. n = 3 biological replicates. Pathways
  in ‘A’ and ‘C’ were manually generated based on the KEGG pathway database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html)
  with permission and previous reports on glycolysis, phenylpropanoid, and carotenoid
  biosynthesis pathway. DEG corresponding to construct the phenylpropanoid and glycolysis
  pathway in ‘A’ are presented in Tables  and , respectively. Values in ‘C’ are mean
  with ± SE.
