caption: 'a. Proposed triple mode-of-action of PI3Kδ inhibition in CLL: (1) a cancer-cell
  intrinsic impact, with PI3Kδ dampening signalling by the BCR and a range of cytokines,
  chemokines, co-stimulatory molecules and adhesion receptors; (2) inhibition of stromal
  cells that support the leukaemic cells, such as myeloid-derived nurse-like cells,
  mesenchymal fibroblast-like cells and leukaemia-associated T-cells, and (3) a host
  anti-leukaemia adaptive immune response, as a consequence of dampening of Treg function
  upon PI3Kδ inhibition.b. Documented effects of PI3Kδ inhibition in FL: (1) a cancer-cell
  intrinsic impact, with PI3Kδ dampening signalling by the BCR, the CD40/CD40L pathway
  as well as restoration of FL cell dependence on the BCL2 anti-apoptotic protein,
  resulting in a predisposition to FL cell death and sensitivity to BLC2 inhibitors;
  (2) dampening of recruitment of T-follicular helper cells and Treg cells through
  downmodulation of the CCL22 chemokine; and downregulation of proteins involved in
  B–T-cell synapses, leading to an inefficient crosstalk between FL cells and T-follicular
  helper cells; (3) dampening of follicular dendritic cell-FL interactions related
  to angiogenesis, cell adhesion and transendothelial migration in FL patients that
  show a clinical response to PI3Kδ inhibition. (4) a host anti-leukaemia adaptive
  immune response, as a consequence of dampening of Treg function upon PI3Kδ inhibition.
  Such a PI3Kδ-inhibition induced immune response has to be formally documented in
  FL.c. Effect of PI3Kδ inhibition in solid tumours: (1) a cancer cell-intrinsic impact:
  some solid tumours (such as breast and melanoma) express high levels of PI3Kδ which
  may provide sensitivity to PI3Kδ inhibition. (2) dampening of the immuno-suppressive
  effects of MDSCs and macrophages, and dampening of cancer-stimulating fibroblasts
  and macrophages, and (3) preferential inhibition of Treg cells, allowing a CD8+
  T-cell immune response to develop. The question marks in the figure indicate that
  the role of PI3Kδ in the indicated responses requires further validation, with inhibition
  of PI3Kγ likely to have a stronger suppressive impact on macrophages than inhibition
  of PI3Kδ, and blockade of PI3Kα and/or PI3Kβ having a stronger impact than PI3Kδ
  inhibition on fibroblasts.'
