caption: The cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathway. Cell wall damage is sensed
  (wave arrows) at the plasma membrane through cell-surface proteins that stimulate
  nucleotide exchange on Rho1 and activation of Pkc1. The main role of activated Pkc1
  is to trigger the MAPK module (Bck1, Mkk1/Mkk2 and Slt2). Once phosphorylated, the
  MAPK Slt2 activates two different transcription factors, SBF (Swi4/Swi6) and Rlm1.
  Cell wall damage caused by Congo red (CR) is sensed mainly through Mid2 to activate
  the CWI pathway; Zymolyase (Zym) mediated cell wall stress requires Hkr1 sensor
  and elements of the Sho1 branch of the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway to
  activate Rho1; Caspofungin (Cas) is sensed through Wsc1 leading to the activation
  of the CWI pathway and parallel inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling (solid
  lines) Modulatory mechanisms of CWI signaling are represented with broken lines.
  Rlm1 elicits transcriptional positive feedback loops on the expression of RLM1 and
  SLT2. In contrast, attenuation of the CWI pathway requires negative retrophosphorylation
  feedback loops mediated by Slt2 on Rom2 and Mkk1/2 and the Rlm1-dependent transcriptional
  induction of the Slt2 phosphatases Ptp2 and Msg5. In addition, other Slt2 phosphatases
  like Ptp3, Sdp1 and Ptc1 and ubiquitination of Pkc1 by Ubp3 also contribute to attenuate
  the induction of CWI pathway. Arrows and T symbols represent activation (positive)
  and inhibitory (negative) events, respectively.
