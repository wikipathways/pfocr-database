caption: The synthesis of mevalonate begins with a two-step condensation of three
  acetyl-CoA molecules to produce 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA).
  HMG-CoA is the substrate of the committed step enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR),
  that generates mevalonate. Mevalonate is further processed by two phosphorylation
  steps and decarboxylation to synthesize isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), which can
  be isomerized to dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). These two molecules are building
  blocks for larger isoprenoid pyrophosphates. The synthesis of the 15-carbon isoprenoid
  farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is a major branch point in the mevalonate pathway.
  FPP can be shuttled to the production of cholesterol through the synthesis and cyclization
  of the 30-carbon isoprenoid, squalene. FPP is also used in the synthesis of dolichol
  phosphate, an oligosaccharide carrier for asparagine glycosylation and mannose-donor
  for GPI-anchor production. The direct addition of FPP to biomolecules can occur
  during the formation of ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q) and Heme A of cytochrome c oxidase.
  Finally, FPP is converted to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) by geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate synthase 1 (GGPS1). Both FPP and GGPP can be post-translationally added
  to proteins, especially RHO, RAS and RAB family proteins, in a process known as
  prenylation by farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase)
  respectively. GGPP also can be used for the synthesis of ubiquinone, the conversion
  of Vitamin K1 to Vitamin K2, and the generation of a newly discovered glutathione
  conjugate, s-geranylgeranyl-l-glutathione (GGG). SREBP maturation (mSREBP) is important
  for supporting mevalonate pathway gene expression.
