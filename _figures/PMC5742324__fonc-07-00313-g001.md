caption: 'Glucose and glutamine catabolism provide tumor cells with biosynthetic precursors.
  Glucose transport and glycolytic flux are accelerated in cancer cells, when compared
  to normal cells, due to increased expression of appropriate transporters and enzyme
  isoforms. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) shunts G6P from the glycolysis
  into the oxidative branch of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Intermediates from
  glycolysis and TCA cycle replenish biosynthetic pathways to produce macromolecules
  (nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins) necessary for cell proliferation. Only those
  transporters and enzymes relevant to the text are shown: GLUT1, glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)/-B, MCT1/4. HIF- targets are in red and
  CRISPR-Cas9 targets studied in our lab are identified with red arrows.'
