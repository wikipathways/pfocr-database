caption: M. burkeana leaf coding transcripts involved in the regulation of the caffeine
  metabolism, biosynthesis of streptomycin and ansamycin pathways. a M. burkeana leaf
  coding transcripts involved in the regulation of the caffeine metabolism. b M. burkeana
  leaf coding transcripts involved in the regulation of streptomycin biosynthesis
  pathway. c M. burkeana leaf coding transcripts involved in the regulation of ansamycin
  biosynthesis pathway. While caffeine metabolic pathway is specific to tea quality,
  the biosynthesis of streptomycin and ansamycin pathways are specific to therapeutic
  medicines. The enzymes encoded by the M. burkeana leaf transcripts are indicated
  by red enzyme numbers (EC-number) and all other enzymes are indicated by black.
  The chemical reactions catalyzed by the enzymes encoded by the M. burkeana leaf
  transcripts are indicated in black solid arrows and all other reactions and intermediates
  are indicated in black dashed/dotted arrows. End products are indicated in blue
  color and bold. 5-AA-6-FA-3-MU 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil
