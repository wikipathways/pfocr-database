caption: Alcohol mediated Hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity caused by increased production
  of ROS; due to alcohol damages antioxidant defenses and mitochondrial function as
  well as structure. It leads to liver inflammation, fibrosis and steatosis. Cellular
  responses, which are sturdily involved in Kupffer cell may also activated due to
  action of ROS which contribute to an increase of inflammatory responses, resulting
  liver injury. Furthermore, activated Kupffer cells release ROS and cytokines that
  are crucial for HSC activation and inducing the pro-fibrogenic pathway.
