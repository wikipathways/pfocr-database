caption: Proposed role of Soat in lipid droplet formation and steroid-triggered lipolysis.
  (A) Soat expression in the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and uptake of DHEAS
  under physiological conditions. (B) Upregulation of Soat expression by LPS treatment
  through JNK and NF-κB–dependent pathways increases DHEAS uptake and stimulation
  of lipolysis via an AR-dependent pathway. The lipolytic effect of DHEAS could be
  blocked by STX64 and flutamide. (C) As DHEAS levels are low in mice, Soat may mediate
  uptake of other relevant sulfated steroids here. (D) Absence of steroid sulfate
  uptake through Soat in Slc10a6 −/−  knockout mice could lead to the hypertrophy
  of lipid droplets in adipocytes via hitherto unknown signaling pathways. DHEAS,
  dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; STS, steroid sulfatase;
  STX64, STS inhibitor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NF-κB, nuclear factor “kappa-light-chain-enhancer”
  of activated B-cells; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; AR, androgen
  receptor; flutamide, androgen receptor antagonist. The figure was created with biorender.com.
