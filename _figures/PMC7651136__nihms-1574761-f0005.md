caption: 'Cell cycle checkpoints elicited by UV-induced ATR activation. G1-S checkpoint:
  Following UV-induced DNA damage in G1 phase, activated ATR phosphorylates p53 at
  Ser15 and CHK1 at Ser345. Phospho-CHK1 inactivates CDC25A, preventing dephosphorylation
  of CDK2 and inducing G1 arrest. The p53-p21 pathway also inhibits CDK2. Intra-S
  checkpoint: UV activates the ATR-CHK1 pathway in S phase, decreasing the function
  of CDK. DNA replication origin firing requires phosphorylation of Treslin by CDK,
  and thus it is plausible that replication stress prevents origin firing via inhibiting
  Treslin phosphorylation. S-G2checkpoint: ATR senses ongoing DNA replication during
  unperturbed S phase, inhibiting CDK1 activity and preventing cell cycle progression
  to G2 phase. When DNA replication is completed, ATR activity is diminished, allowing
  CDK1 to phosphorylate FOXM1 for S-G2 transition. G2-M checkpoint: UV-induced ATR-CHK1
  activation inhibits CDC25C and CDK1 activities, preventing G2-M transition. WEE1
  phosphorylates and inhibits CDK1, also inducing G2 arrest.'
