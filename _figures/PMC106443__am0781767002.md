caption: Structures of plasmids used for HMG gene overexpression. Plasmids pGhrH and
  pChGRH have the full-length HMG gene and the truncated HMG gene, respectively. GAP-P,
  promoter of the gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAP-T, terminator
  of the gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HYGr, HYG phosphotransferase
  gene.
