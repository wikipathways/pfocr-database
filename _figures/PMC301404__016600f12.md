caption: Model Illustrating How Changes in [Ca2+]cyt Levels Regulate Trichome Morphogenesis
  through a Ca2+ Sensor, KIC, and a Microtubule-Based Motor, KCBP, in Arabidopsis.Based
  on the magnitude of changes in [Ca2+]cyt levels in trichome cells in response to
  developmental cues, KIC can be activated, which in turn negatively regulates the
  microtubule-based motor, KCBP, in the trichome morphogenic complex. The positive
  and negative regulation of intermediate components in the pathway are shown with
  an arrow and a line ending with a solid bar, respectively. Some of the known positive
  and negative regulators of trichome morphogenesis that interact with KCBP are shown
  in green and red, respectively. Biochemical and/or genetic analyses show interaction
  between positive (KCBP and AN or FRC1) or between positive and negative (KCBP/SUZ)
  regulators (; ; ) or between KCBP and KIPK (). AN, ANGUSTIFOLIA; FRC1, FURCA1; KCBP,
  kinesin-like CaM binding protein; KIC, KCBP-interacting Ca2+ binding protein; KIPK,
  kinesin-interacting protein kinase; MT, microtubule; SUZ, suppressor of zwi3.
