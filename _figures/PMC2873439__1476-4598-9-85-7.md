caption: CXCR5 activate PI3K isoforms through Gα-Src-FAK pathway or via Gβ/γ pathway
  leading to subsequent activation of ERK1/2. LNCaP cells express PI3Kp110α, PI3Kp110β
  and PI3Kp110δ, while PC3 cells express PI3Kp110α, PI3Kp110β and PI3Kp110γ. Perhaps
  owing to their more aggressive phenotype, PC3 cells are capable of exploiting both
  Gα-Src-FAK and Gβ/γ-mediated events leading to enhanced migration and invasion,
  while LNCaP cells are only able to take advantage of the Gα-Src-FAK-mediated pathway
  following CXCL13-CXCR5 interaction.
