caption: 'JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription)
  pathway. The JAK-STAT system consists of three main components: (1) a membrane receptor,
  (2) JAK and (3) the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). It
  is activated by different signals, including interferon, interleukin, growth factors
  and other chemical messengers that activate the kinase function of JAK, which autophosphorylates
  itself. The STAT proteins then bind the phosphorylated receptor, where they are
  phosphorylated by JAK. The phosphorylated STAT proteins bind to another phosphorylated
  STAT protein (dimerizes) and translocate into the nucleus where promote transcription
  of genes responsive to STAT. The pathway is negatively regulated at multiple levels.
  Pathway objects and links are described separately in .'
