caption: Pathological mechanisms of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation are essential cellular and molecular
  events in the pathogenesis of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction results in Aβ deposition by stimulating mtDNA mutations and ROS production
  in AD. It can also aggravate the functions and mutations of Parkin, causing PD development.
  Besides, mHTT impairs mitochondrial ATP production and mitochondrial respiration
  in HD. SOD1 dysfunction is a cause of sporadic ALS. Secondly, oxidative stress is
  a key player in aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. Aβ-induced oxidative imbalance
  and P-tau protein are critical in the neurodegeneration of AD with oxidative stress.
  Enhanced oxidative stress causes UPS dysfunction and further aggravates the injury
  of dopaminergic neurons in PD substantia nigra. ROS plays a role in blocking neurotransmitter
  transmission in HD through stimulating protein misfolding and forming inclusion
  bodies. Besides, ROS/RNS overproduction is evident in ALS patients. Thirdly, neuroinflammation
  is implicated in the pathologic processes of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases.
  The inflammation of AD is mainly regulated by microglia in the innate immune response
  of the central nervous system. The accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein in
  Lewy bodies are involved in the development of PD. The release of inflammatory cytokines
  induced by mHTT and the activation of NF-kB signaling pathway are the main inflammatory
  mechanisms of HD. The increased microgliosis and astrocytosis result in decreased
  MHCI level and ultimately contribute to neurotoxicity in ALS.
