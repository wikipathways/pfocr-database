caption: 'Pathway analysis of composite list of expressed genes and enriched transcription
  factors implicates specific regulatory networks. The number of original genes is
  the number of genes in the network (highlighted in green) that were in the original
  gene list (excluding the genes encoding the transcription factors). The number of
  transcription factor genes is the number of genes in the network that encode significant
  transcription factors. The functions shown are the functions that are most significant
  for that network. A: Network derived from expressed genes and significant transcription
  factors in basal-like tumor subtype. B: Network derived from expressed genes and
  significant transcription factors in luminal subtype A. C: Network derived from
  expressed genes and significant transcription factors in normal-like breast tumor
  subtype. D: Network derived from expressed genes and significant transcription factors
  in ERBB2+ tumor subtype. Highlighted regions indicate feed forward autoregulatory
  loop inferred from the presence of NF-κB TFBS in the ERRB2 and GRB7 promoters (see
  Supplementary Figure S4 at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). E: Network derived from expressed
  genes and significant transcription factors in luminal subtype B.'
