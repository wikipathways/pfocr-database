caption: 'Mechanisms of prostate smooth muscle contraction and assumed connections
  to the regulation of prostate growth. In contrast to earlier concepts, α1-adrenoceptors
  in the prostate are no longer regarded as isolated receptors mediating exclusively
  contraction. In fact, α1-adrenoceptors in the prostate are part of a signaling network,
  where different receptors and non-adrenergic mediators cooperatively regulate prostate
  smooth muscle tone and growth, leading to benign prostate obstruction. Prostate
  α1-adrenoceptors lead to contraction by activation of the IP3/Ca2+/calmodulin pathway,
  of DAG/protein kinase C, of the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway, and by a JNK-dependent
  mechanism. At least the Ca2+- and Rho kinase-dependent mechanisms are shared by
  TXA2 receptors, which cause prostate smooth muscle contraction in parallel to α1-adrenoceptors.
  In addition, α1-adrenoceptors share intracellular effectors with hormone receptors
  and growth factors (e. g. fibroblast growth factor): Stimulation of prostate α1-adrenoceptors
  leads to activation of ERK1/2, Akt and transcription factors, which are well known
  to mediate growth and differentiation'
