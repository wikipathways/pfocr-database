  can enter the cell as glucose or as ketones [beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) and acetoacetate
  (AcAc)]. Glucose is processed through the cytosolic glycolytic pathway to generate
  cytosolic NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine nucleotide) and pyruvate. Pyruvate
  can enter the mitochondrion and be processed into acetyl-CoA, CO2, and mitochondrial
  NADH. Ketones are directly metabolized by the mitochondrion to generate acetyl-CoA
  and mitochondrial NADH, leaving cytosolic NAD+ oxidized. Ketone body–derived acetyl-CoA
  is condensed with oxaloacetic acid (OAA) to generate citrate. In inhibitory neurons,
  citrate is converted to alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG), then glutamate (Glu), and then
  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Increased GABA inhibits neuronal excitation, suppressing
  seizures. Increased acetyl-CoA also drives the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to
  generate mitochondrial NADH, which is oxidized by the electron transport chain (ETC)
  to increase ΔP and drive ATP synthesis. The elevated ATP drives the neuron plasma
  membrane K+ and Ca2+ pumps, thereby stabilizing the membrane potential, decreasing
  depolarization, and inhibiting seizures. The increased ΔP also drives the mitochondrial
  innermembrane nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) to convert NADH to
  NADPH. The elevated NADPH drives the reduction of mitochondrial oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH), protecting the mitochondria against oxidative
  stress. Mitochondrial citrate can be exported to the cytosol, where it is cleaved
  by ATP-citrate lyase to generate cytosolic acetyl-CoA and OAA. The OAA is reduced
  by malic dehydrogenase to malate, and the malate is oxidized to pyruvate, generating
  NADPH. The cytosolic NADPH can then reduce cytosolic GSSG to GSH, protecting the
  cytosol against oxidative stress. Cytosolic acetyl-CoA can drive histone acetylation
  by histone acetylases (HATs), opening chromatin and activating transcription of
  energetic genes. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) can reverse this acetylation, inhibiting
  transcription of energetic genes. HDAC inhibitors such as valproate keep the chromatin
  open and energy production high. However, valproate treatment of patients with severe
  energy deficits may drive energy production beyond the capacity of the impaired
  bioenergetic system, resulting in failure and pathology (). Oxidation of ketones
  by the mitochondria leaves cytosolic NAD+ oxidized. This activates Sirt1 to deacetylate
  the forkhead box, subgroup O (FOXO) and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor
  gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) transcription factors, resulting in the induction
  of mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and ATP production.
