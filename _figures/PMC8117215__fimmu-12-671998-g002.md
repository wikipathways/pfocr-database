caption: Overview of the UPR signaling pathway under ER stress conditions. Unfolded
  Protein Response is engaged to respond to increasing amount of proteins in the ER.
  (1) The ER-resident chaperone BiP binds to unfolded and misfolded proteins and consequently
  releases the sequestrated IRE1α, PERK and ATF6 ER sensors, leading to their activation
  following (i) dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of IRE1α and PERK elements or
  (ii) MBTPS1/S1P and MBTPS2/S2P – mediated cleavage of ATF6α in the Golgi apparatus.
  Activated ATF6α then translocates into the nucleus and upregulates chaperones expression
  and factors involved in lipid synthesis and ERAD. Activated PERK phosphorylates
  eIF2α which represses global protein translation except for ATF4 whose translation
  is enhanced. ATF4 then upregulates amino acid metabolism and apoptosis. IRE1α, via
  XBP-1 transcription factor, leads to a broader range of responses with upregulation
  of many factors including chaperones and those important for lipid synthesis and
  ERAD. IRE1α regulates as well the factors important for protein folding and secretory
  functions. Particularly, XBP1 mRNA requires IRE1α to be spliced and efficient as
  a transcription factor.
