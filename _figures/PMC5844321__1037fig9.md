caption: 'Sterol precursor(s) lead to Upc2-facilitated induction of Set4 to repress
  genes required for antifungal drug resistance and sterol homeostasis under hypoxic
  conditions. (A) Model under hypoxia: Sterol-facilitated induction of Set4 by Upc2
  mediates repression of ERG genes by association with the transcriptional repressors
  Hap1 and Tup1 to block the function of the transcriptional activator, Upc2. Hap1
  under hypoxic conditions is heme independent and is considered a transcriptional
  repressor. Activation of ERG genes by Upc2 is blocked by the presence of Set4 and
  Hap1 as indicated by the inhibitory symbol. S288C strains expressing the hap1–Ty1
  gene fusion partially repress ERG gene expression; whereas yeast strains expressing
  HAP1 will fully repress ERG genes. (B) Model under azole drug treatment: Sterol-facilitated
  induction of Set4 by Upc2 mediates repression of genes involved in azole resistance
  and likely associates with a transcriptional repressor (T.R.) to block a transcriptional
  activator (T.A.). Under azole treatment, ERG genes are Set4 independent but are
  activated by Upc2, Hap1heme, and coactivators. Hap1 under aerobic conditions is
  bound to heme and is considered a transcriptional activator.'
