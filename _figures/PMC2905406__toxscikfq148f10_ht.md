caption: 'Illustration of GDNF signaling disruption by coated silver nanoparticles.
  A: potential targets for disruption of GDNF signaling in C18-4 cells that inhibit
  proliferation. (1) Nanoparticles bind to GDNF and prevent receptor binding, (2)
  nanoparticles bind to receptors and prevent GDNF from binding, (3) nanoparticles
  interact with the Ret receptor and prevent activation of the receptor and downstream
  elements, (4) nanoparticles bind to Fyn kinase and prevent activation of Fyn and
  downstream elements, and (5) nanoparticles interact with proteins in the PI3/Akt
  pathway. B: model of C18-4 cell growth disruption by silver nanoparticles. The silver
  nanoparticles promoted a decrease in Fyn activity, which disrupted Akt activity
  and promoted a decline in N-myc expression, leading ultimately to a decline in cell
  proliferation. GDNF binding and Ret activation are not affected.'
