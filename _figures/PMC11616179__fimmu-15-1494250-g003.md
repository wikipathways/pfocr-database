caption: The role of LAMs and LCMs in liver injury. In liver pathological conditions,
  LAMs precursor cells are recruited to the liver via chemotaxis and then differentiate
  into LAMs. The transmembrane receptor TREM2, on the surface of LAMs, plays a vital
  role in regulating the LAMs function. Numerous literatures have reported that TREM2
  can promote anti-inflammation and anti-fibrosis through inhibiting the TLRs signaling
  pathway, promoting phagocytosis, and inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover,
  TREM2 can inhibit the production of MiR-106b-5p in the exosomes derived from macrophage,
  thereby enhancing the MFN2 expression to maintain mitochondrial structure and lipid
  metabolism balance. Besides, LAMs can transform into KCs when the KCs were exhausted.
  LCMs located in the liver capsule also play a significant role in liver inflammation
  and tissue remodeling. LAMs are recruited from peripheral monocytes, and mitigate
  the dissemination of intraperitoneal bacteria by recruiting neutrophils in the liver,
  thereby inhibiting the liver inflammation indirectly
