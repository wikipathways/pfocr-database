caption: Models of piRNA pathway silencing in distinct tissues of the Drosophila ovary.
  Germline and somatic cells of the Drosophila ovary use vastly different mechanisms
  to combat particular transposon threats. (A) In somatic cells of the ovary, flamenco
  cluster transcription precedes its processing to piRNAs that are directly loaded
  into the Piwi protein, which targets somatically expressed transposons (gypsy family)
  for silencing. Given Piwi’s nuclear localization, regulation is likely occurring
  at the transcriptional level. (TGS) Transcriptional gene silencing. (B) The Aub
  and AGO3 proteins actively cycle in a germline-specific feed forward amplification
  loop to generate a potent and abundant pool of silencing-capable piRNAs. (C) Piwi
  may act similarly in the germline as in the soma. Here, the Piwi protein may directly
  bind antisense, cluster-derived piRNAs to silence elements by TGS. Additionally,
  Piwi may serve as a low-level recipient or participant with AGO3 in the ping-pong
  cycle. (D) Diagram of a mid/late-stage egg chamber of the Drosophila ovary. (NC)
  Nurse cell (germline); (NCN) nurse cell nucleus; (OO) oocyte; (ON) oocyte nucleus;
