caption: 'Network visualization of key signaling and lip regulatory modules implicated
  in ferroptosis. The gene regulatory network comprises the following circuits (in
  chronological order of execution): 1. Iron overload; 2. Lipid peroxidation 3. Ferroptosis
  and 4. Mitochondrial damage and pericardial edema. Full protein names of the nodes
  in this network are as follows: TF: transferrin, TFR: transferrin receptor, ACSL4:
  acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4'
