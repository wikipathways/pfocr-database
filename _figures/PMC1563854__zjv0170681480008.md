caption: Molecular model depicting the induction and suppression of NF-κB activation
  during VV infection of 293T cells. Our current hypothesis is that MVA infection
  of 293T cells triggers the phosphorylation of ERK2 via MEK proteins. Next, the IKK
  complex is targeted by P-ERK2, possibly in conjunction with ERK5, and the activated
  IKK group in turn phosphorylates IκBα. Consequently, the modified IκBα is degraded,
  and the released NF-κB is able to migrate but temporarily remains in the nucleus
  to coordinate the transcription of a variety of host immune response genes. When
  available, M2L will interfere with MEK-directed phosphorylation of ERK2 and thereby
  partially inhibit VV-induced NF-κB activity. The remainder of the suppression is
  likely provided by K1L, which negatively interacts with the component(s) of an ERK2-independent
  pathway that promotes NF-κB activation.
