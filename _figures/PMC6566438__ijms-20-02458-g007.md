caption: Schematic representation of some of the signaling pathways involved in the
  differentiation of ADSCs into IPCs. The increase in insulin expression by ADSCs
  is dependent on a set of signaling pathways. The MAPK/p38 (red) and Jak/STAT-3 (blue)
  pathways act positively on the differentiation of cells into insulin-producing cells,
  whereas the PI3K (green labelled) pathway acts negatively. Exendin-4 has been shown
  to be a good inducer of cell differentiation by enhancing p38 phosphorylation, which
  is inhibited by SB203580 (SB). PI3K inhibition by LY294002 (LY) augmented insulin
  production in all protocols of differentiation. Resveratrol (Resv) activates the
  Jak/STAT-3 pathway, culminating in insulin expression, but to a lesser extent when
  compared to exendin-4.
