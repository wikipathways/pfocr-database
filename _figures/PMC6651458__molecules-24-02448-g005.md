caption: A proposed mechanism via which 13-EBR exhibits anticancer effects in triple-negative
  breast cancer (TNBC) and RT-R TNBC. Treatment with 13-EBR exhibits anticancer effects
  through the suppression of cell proliferation and colony-forming ability and by
  inducing apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated signaling pathway in RT-R MDA-MB-231
  cells, as well as MDA-MB-231 cells.
