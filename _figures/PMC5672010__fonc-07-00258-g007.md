caption: Differentially expressed genes induced in the chronic obstructive pulmonary
  disease canonical pathway. (A) HPV11E6 induced the upregulation of CXCL2 gene only,
  while HPV18E6 induced the upregulation of IL8, MMP1, and MMP9 genes (B). Red shading
  indicates genes that are upregulated while the unshaded genes were not identified
  as differentially expressed by HPVE6 but were rather integrated into the computationally
  generated pathway on the basis of the evidence stored in the IPA knowledge memory
  indicating a relevance to this pathway.
