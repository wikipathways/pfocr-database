caption: 'Xenoestrogens and phytoestrogens  modulate multiple estrogen-mediated signaling
  pathways to shape the hallmarks  of cancer. (A) Activation of estrogen receptor
  signaling. There are two  types of ERs: intracellular ERα and ERβ and membrane-associated
  mERs and GPER []. ERs are activated in four manners: (1) the  classical genomic
  pathway where estrogens are bound to ERs that will activate  the transcription of
  target genes, (2) the non-classical genomic pathway  involving ERs interactions
  with other transcription factors (TFs) such as  activator protein 1 (AP-1), including
  c-Fos, c-Jun, c-myc, (3) the  E2-independent pathway which activates ERs through
  phosphorylation induced by  growth factors (EGFR/IGFR/Her2/3) signaling cascades
  [],  and (4) the non-genomic pathway involving membrane-associated ERs such as mERs
  and  GPER. (B) Co-activation of AhR/PPARγ/ERRγ/ROS pathways.  Xenoestrogens/phytoestrogens
  activate AhR signaling pathways and cross-talk  with ER pathways: (1) AhR competes
  with ERs for promoter binding, leading to  inhibition of ER signaling, (2) activation
  of AhR signaling regulates E2  production by controlling the gene expression of
  CYP19, also known as  aromatase, and (3) activation of AhR signaling ubiquitinates
  ERs for  degradation via the proteasome, leading to inhibition of ER signaling.  Xenoestrogens/phytoestrogens
  activate peroxisome proliferator-activated  receptors (PPARs) and estrogen-related
  receptor gamma (ERRγ).  Xenoestrogens/phytoestrogens could also induce oxidative
  stress-mediated  signaling by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). (C) Shaping
