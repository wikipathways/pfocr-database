caption: LAG3/MHC Class II Signaling Pathway. (1) LAG-3 is commonly expressed on regulatory
  T cells (Treg), effector T cells, and NK cells. Its main ligand is MHC class II,
  which is found upregulated on some tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating macrophages,
  and dendritic cells (DCs). LAG-3-MHC II interaction promotes inhibition of the responses
  of effector T cells and promotes the suppressive activity of Treg. (2) Double blocking
  of LAG3 and PD1 in synergy using antagonist antibodies against LAG3 in combination
  with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, represents a novel strategy in oncology. Indeed, co-blocking
  LAG-3 and PD-1 enhances T-cell effectors and NK cells proliferation, promotes the
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokine, and inhibits Treg cells [].
