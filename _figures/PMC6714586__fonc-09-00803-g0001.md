caption: Main signaling pathways implicated in VE-cadherin/VM-positive cells. VE-cadherin
  can be phosphorylated by VEGFR-2, alone or in a NRP-1-dependent manner, in response
  to different VEGF soluble factors. These stimuli lead to the phosphorylation of
  VE-cadherin at Y658 and its subsequent internalization. pY658-VEC can interact with
  p120 and Kaiso. This complex prevents Kaiso from binding its target genes (CCND1,
  WNT11), promoting VM formation in aggressive melanoma models. VE-PTP may be an important
  factor in the maintenance of VE-cadherin phosphorylation status, and catenins p120
  or β-catenin may influence the VE-PTP/VE-cadherin axis. On the other hand, VM-positive
  aggressive melanoma cells showed an up-regulation in a number of proteins, as compared
  with poorly melanoma cells. One of these proteins was TIE-1, which may be a target
  of VE-PTP, suggesting an implication in the TIE/angiopoietin pathway.
