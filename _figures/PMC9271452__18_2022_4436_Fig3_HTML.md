caption: A complex interaction between different pathways following the GSK-J4 treatment.
  A The most enriched biological processes after GSK-J4 treatment, showing substantial
  enrichment of mitochondrial function and organization, and translation. Gene ontology
  analysis was performed using Enrichr, with redundant terms trimmed using Revigo
  (unadjusted P < 0.01). B Network visualization of the downstream targets of GSK-J4
  with the canonical pathways overlaid. Many of these genes are involved in the mitochondrial
  dysfunction pathway, while others show involvement in sirtuin and necroptosis signaling
  pathways. Schematic downloaded from QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Green downregulated;
  red upregulated. Blue leads to inhibition, and yellow indicates inconsistent findings
  into a downstream state of a molecule
