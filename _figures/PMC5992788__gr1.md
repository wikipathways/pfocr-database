caption: CRISPR Targeting of Swedish KM670/671NL APP and Its Effect on Aβ Generation(A)
  The Swedish KM670/671NL APP (APPswe) double-base change (yellow), causing familial
  Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is located near a potential Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9
  PAM (NGG) site (purple). The mutation and gRNA target site is upstream of the β-secretase
  site. (B) In the amyloidogenic pathway, amyloid-β (Aβ) is produced via sequential
  cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. No Aβ is
  generated upon α-secretase APP cleavage in the non-amyloidogenic pathway. The APPswe
  mutation is a better β-secretase substrate than the corresponding wild-type site,
  and individuals with this mutation develop AD as a consequence of elevated Aβ levels.
  (C) Three different gRNAs targeting the KM670/671NL site (SW1, SW2, and SW3) and
  one gRNA recognizing the wild-type sequence (WT) were evaluated. The PAM site is
  depicted in purple.
