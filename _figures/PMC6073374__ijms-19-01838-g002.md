caption: The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)/Patched (PTCH1) and WNT signaling pathways. (A)
  The SHH ligand inactivates the PTCH1 receptor allowing Smoothened (SMO) to become
  active. Red cross represents the release of the inhibition exerted by PTCH1 on SMO
  when SHH is present. The SMO activates the GLI proteins, a family of transcription
  factors that turn on the expression of different target genes, giving raise to cell
  proliferation and tumorigenesis (activation of the pathway represented with black
  arrows). (B) The binding of WNT to the Frizzled receptor activates a cascade of
  downstream events, resulting in the inactivation of the β-catenin destruction complex.
  The red cross represent the release of the inhibition exerted by the β-catenin destruction
  complex on β-catenin. In consequence, β-catenin activates and promotes the transcription
  of genes that promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (represented with black
  arrows). Adapted from [,].
