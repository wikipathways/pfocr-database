caption: Selenium metabolism in the liver. Diet-derived Se is used for Sec synthesis
  or excreted following methylation/glycosylation. Se in the Sec synthesis pathway
  is used for the synthesis of liver selenoproteins or SeP, which enter the systemic
  circulation. In addition, small Se-containing compounds bound to albumin and/or
  selenomethionine also enter the systemic circulation. High glucose and high lipid
  diets increase SeP mRNA and enhance the synthesis of SeP when enough Sec-tRNA[ser]sec
  is available.
