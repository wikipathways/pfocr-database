caption: Schematic model illustrates the role of Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) in the regulation
  of follicular recruitment in chickens through its influence on the autophagy-lysosome
  pathway in granulosa cells (GCs). The upregulation of SIRT5 inhibits excessive autophagy,
  stabilize mitochondrial activity, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance lipid droplet
  formation, which contribute to the promotion of follicular recruitment in chickens.
  This provides insights into the molecular control of reproductive processes in chickens
