caption: Pathway analysis. Ingenuity analysis on differentially expressed genes in
  damaged and undamaged cartilage revealed three protein–protein interaction networks
  showing significant association. These were, A. Cellular Development, Skeletal and
  Muscular System Development and function, Lymphoid tissue structure development.
  B. Inflammatory response, cell death, haematological disease. C. Skeletal and muscular
  disorders, cell signalling, small molecule biochemistry Nodes shaded grey are genes
  with significant expression differences in the microarray.
