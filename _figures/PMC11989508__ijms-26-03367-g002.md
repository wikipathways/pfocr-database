caption: ERS is closely linked to the pathological mechanisms of PD, with clinical,
  animal, and cellular studies highlighting its critical role. Clinical evidence reveals
  significant upregulation of ERS markers (e.g., GRP78, CHOP, p-eIF2α) in PD patients’
  brain regions such as the SN and locus coeruleus, as well as in CSF, correlating
  positively with disease severity and suggesting ERS-driven neuronal apoptosis. In
  animal models, Drosophila expressing mutant α-syn and MPTP-induced mouse PD models
  exhibit ERS activation (e.g., increased BiP expression and XBP-1 splicing), while
  ERS suppression alleviates dopaminergic neuron damage and improves motor function.
  Cellular experiments further confirm that mutant α-syn overexpression or MPP+ treatment
  triggers ER unfolded protein accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction, activating
  the UPR pathways (IRE1, PERK, ATF6). However, persistent stress ultimately leads
  to apoptosis, with ERS and mitochondrial damage (Ca2+ overload, ROS surge) forming
  a vicious cycle that synergistically exacerbates neuronal degeneration. These findings
  collectively underscore ERS as a multifaceted contributor to PD pathogenesis and
  a potential therapeutic target. (↑ represents increase; ↓ represents decrease)
