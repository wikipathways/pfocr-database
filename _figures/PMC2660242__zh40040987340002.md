caption: Metabolic control of vascular redox signaling. The redox status of cytosolic
  NADH generated primarily by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
  in glycolysis and cytosolic NADPH derived from glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) metabolism
  by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  are hypothesized to control signaling mechanisms through their influence in providing
  NAD(P)H to support ROS generation by Nox oxidases and processes directly regulated
  by NADP(H) redox. Note that the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reaction and mitochondrial
  shuttles normally function to maintain very low levels of cytosolic NADH, allowing
  high levels of lactate (Lac) to regulate signaling through increasing NADH and ROS
  generation by Nox oxidases. Some of the signaling mechanisms we have observed to
  be regulating contractile function in bovine arteries by these metabolic redox control
  systems, including cGMP signaling, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK),
  potassium (K+) channels, and processes controlled by NADP(H) redox (NADP/NADPH)
  that coordinate the lowering of cytosolic calcium (Ca2+), are included in the model
  shown.
