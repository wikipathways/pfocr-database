caption: A schematic representation of the PPP and glycolysis is shown. The oxidative
  branch of the PPP yields NADPH that can be used in biosynthetic reactions for nucleotides,
  lipids and antioxidant defense. The reversible non-oxidative branch produces ribose-5-phosphate
  from oxidative branch as well as glycolytic intermediates. Solid black arrows represent
  glycolytic flux, green arrows represent the oxidative branch of the PPP, and light
  blue arrows represent multi-step processes of non-oxidative branch of PPP. For clarity,
  each component of the metabolic process has been abbreviated. PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase;
  TKT, transketolase; Taldo1, transaldolase; HK, hexokinase; GLUT, glucose transporters;
  PFK1, phosphofructokinse-1; PGM, phosphoglyceratemutase; PKM2, pyruvate kinase (PK)-M2;
  LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate
