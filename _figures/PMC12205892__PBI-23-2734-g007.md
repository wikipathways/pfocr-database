caption: 'A proposed model: a plant viral effector suppresses NbFER‐NbRALF1‐mediated
  intracellular immunity in N. benthamiana. In the absence of TuMV infection, NbRALF1
  likely recognizes the intracellular CD of FER to activate its kinase activity and
  subsequent initial downstream immune responses. Upon TuMV infection, NbRALF1 is
  upregulated and co‐operates with NbFER to enhance the plant immunity response, probably
  by binding with the intracellular cytoplasmic domain of FER. To counteract this
  defence, TuMV‐encoded 6K2 targets NbRALF1 for degradation via the 26S proteasome
  pathway, thereby subverting the NbRALF1‐NbFER module‐mediated host immunity defence
  and finally establishing successful infection. The figure was partially created
  using BioRender'
