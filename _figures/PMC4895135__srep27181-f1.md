caption: Au8003 is the enzyme responsible for chain elongation from DMAPP and IPP
  to GFPP, as well as cyclization from GFPP to the end product ophiobolin (1). Production
  of ophiobolin is also connected with four other pathways via intermediates of DMAPP,
  IPP, FPP, GGPP, and GFPP. The enzymes Au6298, Au13192 and Au11565 could catalyze
  chain length elongation from DMAPP and IPP to the end products FPP, GGPP and GFPP,
  respectively. FPP could be used for drimane (2) synthesis by drimane synthetase
  or for HexPP synthesis by Au3446, which may then be used to synthesize ergosterol
  (4). GGPP produced by Au13192 (with the silent TC domain) is an important precursor
  for ophiobolin (1) production, but it can also produce veridiene (3) in vitro. GGPP
  or GFPP produced by Au11565 and Au3446 are also substrates for ophiobolin production.
