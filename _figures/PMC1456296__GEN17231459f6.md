caption: A hypothetical model for the regulation of dipeptide utilization in S. cerevisiae.
  The proteins with clear background represent those that have been reported previously
  to be involved in PTR2 regulation. The shaded background represents those proteins
  that have been determined in this study. The SPS protein complex (Ssy1p-Ptr3p-Ssy5p)
  is an amino acid sensor, which leads to a cleavage of the N-terminal of Stp2p. The
  activated form of Stp2p is localized to the nucleus and regulates PTR2 expression.
  In addition, Dal81p synergistically regulates PTR2 expression together with Stp2p.
  Other proteins, Rpn4p, a positive regulator, and Cup9p, a negative regulator, bind
  at the PTR2 promoter region and are also involved in PTR2 transcription. The stability
  of Rpn4p is modulated by Ubr2p and Ubc2p and the stability of Cup9p by Ptr1p, Ubc2p,
  and Ubc4p via the ubiquitination pathway. Binding of N-end rule dipeptides to Ptr1p/Ubr1p
  results in ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Cup9p. Ubr2p competes with Ptr1p for
  the degradation of Cup9p. Arp5p, Arp8p, Ies6p, and Taf14p (components of the INO80
  complex) together with Eaf3p possibly negatively regulate PTR2 transcription via
  repressing the acetylation of histones in the PTR2 coding region. The transcription
  of PTR2 is negatively regulated by a RNA polymerase mediator protein complex, which
  includes Ssn2p, Ssn3p, Ssn8p, and Srb8p. Thp1p might be involved in the translocation
  of PTR2 mRNA from the nucleus to the cytosol. The interaction between Kem1p and
  Pat1p is potentially involved in the degradation of PTR2 mRNA. Dipeptide utilization
  is also modulated by the Ptr2p trafficking system; Srn2p, Vps36p, and Snf7p represent
  components of ESCRT-I, -II, and -III, together with Vps8p and Eaf7p, which appear
  to regulate Ptr2p internalization from the endosome to the vacuole. In addition,
  Npr1 and Lst4p are also involved in Ptr2p trafficking and affect the retention of
  Ptr2p in the plasma membrane.
