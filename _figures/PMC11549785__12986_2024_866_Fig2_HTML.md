caption: LncRNAs modulate MR of solid tumor cells by influencing lipid metabolism.
  LncRNAs significantly regulate the mRNA stability of FAO-related genes and lipid
  synthesis-related genes through epigenetic mechanisms. These mechanisms trigger
  crucial lipid metabolism-associated signaling pathways, thereby governing MR of
  solid tumor cells. In this figure, we mainly summarize that lncRNA LINC00924 substantially
  enhances FAO, fatty acid uptake and upregulates the expression of fatty acid transport-related
  proteins. Mechanistically, LINC00924 modulates the alternative splicing of the MNK2
  precursor mRNA by binding with HNRNPC. This interaction downregulates Mnk2a splicing,
  which, in turn, regulates the p38 MAPK-PPARα signaling pathway. Meanwhile, lncRNA
  NEAT1 upregulates the expression of ATGL, which catalyzes triglyceride hydrolysis
  to yield diacylglycerol and FFAs to potentiate the PPARα signaling pathway. LncRNA
  HUCL also upregulates the expression of ACSL1 to activate above pathway. Furthermore,
  lncRNA LNMICC facilitates the nuclear translocation of NPM1 transcription factor
  to bind to the promoter region of FABP5, stimulating its transcription and consequently
  bolstering fatty acid metabolism. Besides, the lncRNA ROPM influences phospholipid
  MR by upregulating PLA2G16 expression and enhancing the production of FFA and arachidonic
  acid, which activates critical oncogenic signaling pathways, including PI3K-AKT,
  Wnt-β-catenin, and Hippo-YAP. At last, all these lncRNAs related pathways influence
  lipid metabolism to modulate MR in solid tumor cells
