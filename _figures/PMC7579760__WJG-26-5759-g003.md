caption: 'Hepatitis C virus life cycle. Hepatitis C virus entry is facilitated by
  a variety of receptors and signaling pathways (described in[]). Upon viral entry,
  the positive sense RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm from endosomal acidification.
  The viral RNA undergoes replication and translation at the rough endoplasmic reticulum
  to produce a single polyprotein chain at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane that
  is cleaved by viral and host proteases into 10 different viral proteins (structural
  and non-structural). The virus particles are assembled on lipid droplets and associate
  with very-low-density lipoproteins which mature at the Golgi apparatus and are released
  via the secretory pathway. HSPG: Heparin sulfate proteoglycan receptor; LD: Lipid
  droplets; VLDL: Very-low-density lipoproteins.'
