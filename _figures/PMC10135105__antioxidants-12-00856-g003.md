caption: 'Activation of NRF2 signaling pathway by 4-HNE. 4-HNE adduction of KEAP1
  at Cys513 and Cys518 disrupts the binding of NRF2 to KEAP1 and subsequent proteasomal
  degradation of NRF2. Instead, accumulated cytoplasmatic NRF2 translocates to the
  nucleus, initiating the expression of more than 200 genes containing the ARE in
  their promoter, such as TrxR1. Other cysteine residues in KEAP1, such as Cys151,
  Cys288, Cys226, and Cys368, have also been suggested to be involved in the activation
  of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Abbreviations: 4-HNE: 4-hydroxynonenal, ARE: antioxidant
  response element, BTB: Broad complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-Brac domain of KEAP1,
  Cul3: Cullin 3 E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cys: cysteine, DLG: motif of the Neh2 domain
  of the NRF2 responsible for direct interaction with KEAP1, ETGE: motif of the Neh2
  domain of the NRF2 responsible for direct interaction with KEAP1, KEAP1: kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1, KELCH: Kelch domain of KEAP1, Maf: small Maf proteins,
  NRF2: nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2, TrxR1: thioredoxin reductase 1, Ub: ubiquitin.'
