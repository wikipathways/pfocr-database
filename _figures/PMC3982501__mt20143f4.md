caption: The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathway is frequently hit by
  lentiviral vector (LV) integration. The RTK pathway is frequently activated in human
  and murine tumors by several mechanisms. Several of the common insertion site (CIS)
  genes identified in our model, such as Braf, Map3k8, Rasa1, and Pten, belong to
  the RTK pathway. The LV integration in these genes may collaborate with the genetic
  lesion of the Cdkn2a−/− mice to activate the RTK pathway and induce tumorigenesis.
  Genes of the RTK pathway that promote cellular proliferation and survival are indicated
  in red, whereas genes that promote cell cycle arrest and senescence are indicated
  in blue. The rounded rectangles highlight the pathways that are deficient in Cdkn2a−/−
  mice. Stars indicate the genes of the pathway that are CISs in our model.
