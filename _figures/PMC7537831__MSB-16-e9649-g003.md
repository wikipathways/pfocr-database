caption: Ascaroside biosynthesis from a very long‐chain fatty acid (C28) assumed to
  serve as a precursor for all ascarosides. The unknown pathway of ascarylose synthesis
  and attachment is represented by two mass‐ and charge‐balanced reactions (RCC0211
  and RCC0227, ). Reactions from the iterative peroxisomal beta‐oxidation of long‐chain
  ascaroside are lumped to only keep a minimal number of intermediate metabolites
  in the reconstruction. In total, the synthesis of seven ascarosides is reconstructed,
  covering the most abundant ascaroside species in Caenorhabditis elegans.A detailed
  representation of the peroxisomal beta‐oxidation during ascaroside biosynthesis.
  The lumped peroxisomal beta‐oxidation reactions in (A) represent the net reaction
  that comes out of one or multiple iterations of the pathway in (B).
