caption: 'Schematic intracellular network required for lipid metabolism, Apo B biogenesis,
  and CM assembly in the enterocyte. Digestion takes place in the intestinal lumen
  where TGs, CEs, and GPs are hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase, cholesterol esterase,
  and phospolipase A2, respectively. The lipolytic products (FA, 2-MG, FC, lyso-GP)
  are emulsified into mixed micelles by bile salts before their diffusion through
  the unstirred water layer. At the apical surface, they enter the enterocyte via
  passive diffusion when they are in high concentrations. However, protein transporters
  (e.g., FABPm) are required at weaker concentrations. Once inside the enterocyte,
  the lipolytic products are bound to cytoplasmic FABPs (I- and L-FABP) in order to
  migrate to the ER where they are reesterified by various enzymes: monoacylglycerol
  acyltransferase (MGAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) for the conversion
  of 2-MG to TG, ACAT-2 for the esterification of FC into CE, and an enzymatic system
  (glycerophosphate acyltransferase, phosphatidate phosphodiesterase, lyso-PC acyltransferase)
  for the production of GP. The synthesis of Apo B-48 and its interaction with MTP,
  a heterodimeric complex with the chaperone protein, protein disulfide isomerase
  (PDI), through the NH2-terminal domain, is essential for preCM assembly. This packaging
  process starts when the growing Apo B-48 polypeptide is cotranslationally lipidated
  by MTP in the lumen of the ER: the association of Apo B-48 with lipids is required
  not only to ensure proper initiation of folding, but also to prevent its destruction
  by the proteosomal degradation pathway. The formation of preCM transport vesicles
  is critical for the transport of the nascent lipoproteins to the Golgi, a process
  mediated by Sar1b GTPase. The maturation of preCMs is completed in the Golgi by
  addition of lipids and glycosylation of Apos, yielding a mature CM particle characterized
  by TG and CE in its core and FC, GP, and Apo B on its surface. Finally, CMs are
  released by the enterocyte into the intestinal lymph through exocytosis. MG, monoacylglycerol;
  FC, free cholesterol; I-FABP, intestinal-FABP; L-FABP, liver-FABP; PC, phosphatidylcholine.'
