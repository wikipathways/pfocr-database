caption: A map of the VEGF signaling pathway (as an example of an important target
  in cancer therapy) obtained from KEGG is shown []. The gene expression studies are
  used as an independent predictive method for the prognosis. In cancer genomics studies,
  tremendous effort has been devoted to pathway-based analysis. Pathway analysis is
  a promising tool to identify the mechanisms that underlie disease, the adaptive
  physiological compensatory responses and new avenues for investigation. Different
  pathways have different biological functions. Thus, studying each pathway separately
  is reasonable. Among the many pathways, only a few have been shown to have predictive
  power for the development of cancer. In this sense, KEGG could be a useful tool
  to identify genetic signatures [].
