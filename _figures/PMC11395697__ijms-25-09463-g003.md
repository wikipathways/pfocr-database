caption: The serrated neoplasia routes. (A) The traditional serrated pathway begins
  with a KRAS mutation in normal colonic mucosa, leading to the formation of a traditional
  serrated adenoma (TSA). Further MGMT methylation and other TSG (tumor suppressor
  gene) methylation events promote the progression to TSA-HGD (traditional serrated
  adenoma–high grade dysplasia). Subsequent accumulation of genetic alterations results
  in the development of serrated adenocarcinoma (SAC), which can exhibit either an
  MSI-L/CMP-L (microsatellite instability–low/CpG island methylator phenotype–low)
  or MSS/CMP-L (microsatellite stable/CpG island methylator phenotype–low) molecular
  profile, indicative of invasive colorectal cancer (CRC). (B) The sessile serrated
  pathway initiates with a BRAF mutation in normal colonic mucosa, leading to the
  formation of sessile serrated lesions (SSL). Further MLH1 methylation and other
  TSG methylation events promote the progression to SSL-HGD (sessile serrated lesion–high
  grade dysplasia). Subsequent accumulation of genetic alterations results in the
  development of serrated adenocarcinoma (SAC), which can exhibit either an MSI-L/CMP-H
  (microsatellite instability–low/CpG island methylator phenotype–high) or MSI-H/CMP-H
  (microsatellite instability–high/CpG island methylator phenotype–high) molecular
  profile, indicative of invasive CRC. Figure created using BioRender
