caption: Regulation of bile acid synthesis by an ileal bile acid sensing system. Bile
  acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver. The rate-limiting enzyme in
  the pathway is cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1). Bile acids are secreted across
  the apical (canalicular) membrane into the bile canaliculus via the Bsep transporter).
  Bile is then released into the duodenum and flows through the intestinal lumen,
  where it emulsifies lipids. Lipids are primarily absorbed by enterocytes in the
  jejunum. The bile acids are transported through the apical Asbt transporter across
  into ileal enterocytes. Bile acids activate the farnesoid X receptor/retinoid X
  receptor (FXR/RXR), leading the induction of Fgf15 and Ostαβ. The bile acids are
  then released into the portal circulation via basolateral Ostα/β and reabsorbed
  by the hepatic basolateral transporter, Ntcp. FGF15 binds to the FGF4 receptor,
  leading to the repression of Cyp7a1 expression and reduced bile acid synthesis.

  cellular sentinels that regulate the bile acid pool.
