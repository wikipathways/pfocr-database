caption: 'Schematic model of arachidonic acid (AA) release and action. Membrane-bound
  phospholipids (PLs) are hydrolyzed by enzymes of the PLA2 superfamily releasing
  free AA for subsequent eicosanoid production, which then mediates the inflammation
  response. AA may also be generated by alternative pathways: phospholipase C (PLC)
  and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) generate 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), which
  is degraded by monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) releasing AA. Alternatively, triacylglycerols
  (TGs) stored within cytosolic lipid droplets are hydrolyzed by adipose triglyceride
  lipase (ATGL) and release AA. Apparently, the pathway that is responsible for AA
  release along the PLC/DAGL/MGL route is most prominent in the brain and the liver,
  while the pathway along the ATGL route may predominate in TG-rich lipid droplet-containing
  inflammatory cells, such as mast cells.'
