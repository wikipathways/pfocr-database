caption: 'Schematic representation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway: Ligands binds to
  the receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR, IGF1R, Her2, and Ras leads to conformational
  changes and activates PI3K. PI3K is a heterodimeric protein consisting of a regulatory
  subunit p85 and a catalytic subunit p110. PI3K initiates activation of Akt by phosphorylation
  which acts as a major source of activation to further downstream signalling moieties
  involved in various cellular processes such as (text in red) ribosomal protein synthesis
  and cell growth (mTOR, S6K1 and eIF4E), loss of apoptosis (through inhibition of
  BAD, FKHR and activation of NFkB), metabolism (activation of GSK3β), cell-cycle
  arrest and DNA repair mediated by p53.'
