caption: Model for regulation of miRNA biogenesis at the Microprocessor. Multiple
  signaling pathways converge on the Microprocessor via the helicases p68 and p72.
  These helicases have ATP-dependent and ATP-independent functions. We present a model
  whereby both functions affect miRNA production. The ATP-independent functions have
  been linked with recruitment of processing activities to RNA polymerase. This could
  be used by the miRNA pathway as a manner of recruitment of the Microprocessor to
  transcription sites. The ATP-dependent role of p68 has been described as maintenance
  of proper RNA secondary structure to facilitate Drosha cleavage. The components
  of the RNA polymerase preinitiation complex and Microprocessor are simplified. (TBP)
  TATA-binding protein; (TAF) TBP-associated factors; (InR) initiator element; (RE)
  response element.
