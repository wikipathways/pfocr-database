caption: EGF signaling pathway generated by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software.
  EGF and PDGF signaling pathways were the top two pathways in the top 10 functions/diseases
  associated with the high fertility spermatozoa (Table 2). Each node represents a
  protein; proteins in shaded nodes were found in the high fertility spermatozoa dataset
  (see additional file ) while proteins in clear nodes were not found in the high
  fertility spermatozoa dataset.
