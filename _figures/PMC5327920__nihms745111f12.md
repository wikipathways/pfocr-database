caption: Schematic describing the relation between the degree of high-frequency hearing
  loss (severe, moderate and minor) and changes in suprathreshold population response
  profiles in the low-frequency, edge-frequency and high-frequency regions. (A) In
  cases of severe high-frequency hearing loss, low-frequency regions become extremely
  hyperactive, the edge-frequency becomes mildly hypoactive and the high-frequency
  region become very hypoactive. (B) In cases of moderate high-frequency hearing loss,
  low-frequency regions become mildly hyperactive, little change occurs at the edge-frequency
  region and the high-frequency region becomes moderately hypoactive. (C) In cases
  of minor high-frequency hearing loss, the low-frequency region shows no change at
  suprathreshold intensities; the edge-frequency becomes mildly hyperactive and the
  high-frequency region is mildly hypoactive.
