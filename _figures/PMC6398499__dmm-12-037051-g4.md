caption: Crosstalk between Wnt, RA and related signaling pathways in orofacial clefts.
  A surplus (+) of RA induces cleft palate, and RA is known to interact directly with
  the canonical Wnt pathway. In orofacial primordia, retinol dehydrogenases (Rdhs)
  convert vitamin A (retinol) to retinaldehyde, which subsequently produces RA mainly
  via the aldehyde dehydrogenase Aldh1a3. RA represses Wnt signaling, while Lrp6-mediated
  canonical Wnt signaling represses Aldh1a3 expression in the orofacial epithelium,
  suggesting a reciprocal negative regulation between the Wnt and RA pathways. The
  cytochrome P450 family member Cyp26b1 is responsible for RA degradation, thereby
  regulating the endogenous levels of RA. Fgf10 and Tbx1 may act downstream of Cyp26b1
  during palatogenesis. The phenotypic outcomes of the key signaling components highlighted
  in this figure were demonstrated in the respective mutant mouse models.
