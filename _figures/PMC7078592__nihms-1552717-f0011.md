caption: Pathway depicting the effect of reduced succinyl-CoA on heme and hemoglobin
  synthesis. Lower levels of succinyl CoA and heme were observed in the brains of
  the Pank1−/−Syn-Pank2−/− mice together with fewer transcripts for Alas, Hbb1 and
  Hbb2. A decrease in succinyl CoA, together with reduced expression of the aminolevulinic
  acid synthase encoded by the Alas gene leads to decreased amount of the metabolic
  intermediate, aminolevulinic acid, which, in turn, leads to decreased synthesis
  of heme. [Heme-Fe+2] is a positive regulator of transcription of Hbb1 and Hbb2 that
  yield the β subunits of hemoglobin. Depression of this pathway results in reduced
  active hemoglobin in the brain. The blue bold arrows indicate the observed results
  in the Pank1−/−Syn-Pank2−/− mice compared to the age-matched controls, the dashed
  arrow and the plus sign indicate positive regulation of [heme-Fe+2] on Hbb1 and
  Hbb2 expression.
