caption: Antifungal metabolite and peptide pathways are involved in non-host resistance
  against Colletotrichum species. The PEN2 pathway is involved in the synthesis of
  antifungal metabolites required for preinvasive resistance against non-adapted fungal
  pathogens. It was recently reported that EDR1 functions independently of PEN2in
  cell-periphery resistance against non-adapted Colletotrichum species. EDR1 is required
  for pathogen-induced expression of four PDF genes that encode antifungal peptides
  (PDF1.2a, PDF1.2b, PDF1.2c, and PDF1.3). MYC2 is involved in repression of PDF1.2a,
  and genetic analysis suggests that EDR1 interferes with MYC2 to abrogate repression
  of PDF expression. In addition to induction of the PDFs, EDR1 probably regulates
  as yet unidentified pathways involved in preinvasive defense.
