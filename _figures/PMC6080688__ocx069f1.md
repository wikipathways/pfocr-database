caption: Overview of the experimental and analytic design of the study. We hypothesize
  that a classifier based on the pathway-level transcriptional responses that differ
  between symptomatic and asymptomatic responses to HRV infection in healthy patients
  can predict which asthmatic patients will have exacerbations over a 1-year follow-up
  period, based on those patients’ transcriptomic responses to an in vitro HRV stimulation
  assay. Panel A illustrates the development of a classifier using innovative features.
  Both shared and unique genetic and nongenetic variables influence transcript expression
  and healthy vs disease state within an individual. Exposure to a relevant stimulus
  (here, HRV infection) reveals relevant pathway gene sets whose genome and environmentally
  informed responses (G × E response pathways) can be used to predict individual prognosis.
  Panel B describes the development of classifier from the training set using data
  from PBMCs of healthy volunteers exposed to HRV in vivo. For each patient, paired
  microarrays analyzing gene expression before and after HRV exposure were compared
  using N-of-1-pathways analysis to identify significant Gene Ontology biological
  process (GO-BP) features describing each response. Responses in asymptomatic patients
  were then compared to responses in symptomatic patients to develop the classifier.
  Panel C describes the laboratory stimulation assay of asthmatic patients' PBMCs
  in this study. As in the training set, paired microarrays for each patient were
  used to determine the response using N-of-1-pathways. The classifier developed in
  panel B was then applied to individual responses and used to predict recurrent exacerbation.
