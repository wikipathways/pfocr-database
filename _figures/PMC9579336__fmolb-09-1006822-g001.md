caption: 'Mevalonate pathway (; ). Explanation of the pathway is described in the
  main text. Changes in carbon numbers are denoted by the right side of the molecules.

  for enzymes are denoted in blue. Abbreviations: HMGCR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  (HMG) Coenzyme A reductase; PP, pyrophosphate; MD, menadione; UBIAD1, UbiA prenyltransferase
  domain-containing protein-1; SQLE/SM, squalene epoxidase also called SM; LSS, lanosterol
  synthase; PDP1, type I polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase 1 also called PPAPDC2.'
