caption: Regulation of centrosomal F-actin clearance in lymphocytes. Recent studies
  carried out on B and T lymphocytes have implicated three discrete pathways in centrosomal
  F-actin clearance and centrosome polarization during early stages of IS assembly.
  (1) In B lymphocytes the recruitment of the branched F-actin nucleator Arp2/3 to
  the IS upon BCR activation leads to a local depletion of centrosome-associated Arp2/3
  that results in reduced F-actin polymerization at the centrosome, allowing for centrosome
  untethering from the nucleus and its repositioning to the B cell IS (). (2) In T
  lymphocytes protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) has been identified as a novel regulator of
  centrosomal F-actin remodeling, beyond its role in cortical actin reorganization
  at the IS. Following TCR triggering, PKCδ phosphorylates the scaffold protein paxillin,
  which localizes at the centrosome where it contributes to centrosome translocation
  to the T cell IS by promoting a local F-actin clearance through an unknown mechanism
  (). (3) An alternative pathway, based on the proteolytic activity of a centrosome-associated
  proteasome, controls F-actin clearance from the centrosome to enable its dissociation
  from the nucleus and polarization to the nascent IS. This pathway is exploited by
  both B and T lymphocytes with some cell type-dependent features. In B lymphocytes
  the intracellular distribution of the proteasome is regulated by the proteasome
  adapter and scaffold protein Ecm29 during B cell IS formation, allowing a sequential
  recruitment of the proteasome to the centrosome and then to the IS, which is crucial
  for F-actin reorganization at both locations (, ). In T lymphocytes proteasome-mediated
  degradation of unknown targets at early stages of IS assembly is dependent on the
  transport of the 19S regulatory particle (RP) to the centrosome, which is paralleled
  by an active degradation of K48-linked polyubiquitylated proteins (K48 Ub) (). The
  contribution extent as well as the sequential implication of these pathways to the
  process remain to be elucidated.
