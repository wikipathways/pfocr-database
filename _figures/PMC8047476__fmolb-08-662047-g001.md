caption: Psoriatic arthritis is a multifactor disease. Dendritic cells (DC) play a
  central role in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis. DC activated by different
  stimuli produce and secrete IL-23 and IL-12 which further stimulate Th17, γδT cells
  and ILC3 and Th1 cells, respectively, leading to the production of inflammatory
  cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines can act by activating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway
  which regulates the expression of RANKL. RANKL binds to RANK activating osteoclast
  precursors. Environmental triggers such as changes in the microbiota, PAMPs (pathogen
  associated molecular patterns), and LPS can trigger the development of inflammatory
  cascades such as the MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 pathway. Epigenetic mechanism, namely non-coding
  RNAs (e.g., MiR-146a), has been suggested as a critical link between environmental
  triggers and aberrant inflammatory responses. PsA genetic associations are highlighted
  with a red *.
