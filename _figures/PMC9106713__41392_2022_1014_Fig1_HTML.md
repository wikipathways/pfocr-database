caption: Schematic illustration of cuproptosis mechanism. The effect of intercellular
  copper concentration on cell activity shows that cells maintain highly bioactive
  only within a suitable range of extremely narrow copper ion concentrations (a).
  Elesclomol, a copper ionophore, shuttles copper into the cells. FDX1 encodes a reductase
  to reduce Cu2+ to Cu+ and is a direct target of elesclomol. DLAT, a protein target
  of lipoylation, involves with mediating carbon entry to the TCA cycle. DLAT lipoylation
  was promoted by FDX1, and Cu+ enhanced lipoylated protein aggregation and iron-sulfur
  cluster protein reduction, which triggered proteotoxic stress and cell death (b).
