caption: Monovalent cation signalingWhen the concentration of external Na+ (or other
  monovalent cations) is low, no or little binding of Na+ to the negative charge of
  the primary sensor GIPC sphingolipid occurs. High levels of Na+ cause electrostatic
  interaction between GIPC and the cations, which affects the membrane surface potential.
  The change in membrane voltage could promote opening of voltage dependent Ca2+-permeable
  channels and evoke a subsequent Ca2+ signal. The latter is translated into transcriptional
  regulation and well-characterized Ca2+-based signaling cascades such as the SOS
  Na+ extrusion pathway, activated by the CBL-CIPK interaction ().GIPC, glycosyl inositol
