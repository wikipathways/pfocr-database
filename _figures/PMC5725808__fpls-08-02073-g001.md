caption: (Iso) flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in soybean. The first key legume-specific
  enzyme chalcone reductase (CHR) is highlighted in orange that leads into the synthesis
  of isoflavonoid phytoalexins (green highlights) in soybean. The three isoflavone
  aglycones glycitein, daidzein and genistein are shown in pink. The dotted arrow
  indicates speculative steps while multiple arrows indicate two or more steps in
  the pathway. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL,
  4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CHR, chalcone reductase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone
  isomerase; IFS, isoflavone synthase; 2HID, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase.
