caption: 'Hypothalamic circuits regulating thermogenesis of BAT and browning of WAT.
  The preoptic area (POA) receives peripheral information about external temperature,
  being activated by cold and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and mediate the febrile response.
  The POA projects to other hypothalamic nuclei such as the ventromedial nucleus of
  hypothalamus (VMH) leading the activation of BAT sympathetic traffic through projections
  to rostral raphe nucleus (rRPa). Several peripheral signals converge in the VMH
  to regulate thermogenesis: activation of estrogen receptor α (ERα), glucagon like
  peptide 1 receptor (GLP1-R), thyroid hormone receptor (TR), or bone morphogenic
  protein 8 receptor (BMP8R) inhibit AMPK in the VMH stimulating thermogenesis in
  in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT), as well as lipotoxicity-induced
  ER stress. The dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH) is also involved in
  the thermogenesis regulation, since it is inhibited under normothermic environment
  by a GABAergic tone which is disinhibited by POA stimulation inducing thermogenesis.
  The arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus (ARC) contain neurons that express orexigenic
  factors such as agouti-related protein (AgRP) along with neropeptide Y (NPY) and
  anorexigenic neurons expressing proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Leptin induces POMC
  expression increasing the release of POMC products in the second order neurons.
  Leptin action in the ARC also activate RIP-Cre expressing neurons, which through
  disinhibiton of GABAergic population act on paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
  (PVH) to induce thermogenesis. Conversely, AgRP and NPY in the ARC act on the PVH
  decreasing the sympathetic activation of BAT. In the lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus
  (LHA), neurons expressing orexins (OX) promote BAT thermogenesis, a process that
  can be activated by low AMPK activity in the VMH. LepR: Leptin receptor; GABA-R:
  GABA receptor; MPO: medial POA; MnPO: median part of the POA; MC4R: melanocortin
  4 receptor; β3-AR: beta 3 adrenoreceptor.'
