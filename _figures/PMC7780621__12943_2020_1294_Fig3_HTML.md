caption: Role of cytokines/chemokines on tumor progression and dissemination. High
  expression of CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in primary tumor cells or/and ECSCs enhances the
  activation of p-ERK-1/2 and increases these cells’ ability to invade and metastasize
  to lymph node and bone marrow. Abundant expression of CCL21 in the endothelium of
  lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes attracts CCR-7-positive tumor cells. CCL21/CCR7
  axis upregulates MUC-1 expression through p-ERK signaling and enhances the migration,
  invasion, and lymph node metastasis through the lymphatic system. High production
  of potent angiogenic (VEGF-A) and lymphangiogenic (VEGF-C) factors by primary tumor
  cells leads to a malignant process. Elevated levels of CXCL-8 secreted by primary
  tumor cells or TAMs induces the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathway
  through the CXCR2 receptor expressed in primary tumor cells. These processes lead
  to further malignant progression to lymph nodes and distant organ metastasis through
  the lymphatic system and blood vessel. Also, circulating CXCL-8 contributes to the
  metastasis process
