caption: Overview of the ubiquitin-dependent BRI1 endocytosis and degradation. The
  ubiquitin molecules are transferred by ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBC35/36 to
  the E3 ligases PUB12/13, which ubiquitinate the cell membrane-localized BRI1 to
  form K63-linked ubiquitin chains. ELT1, which is also localized to the cell membrane,
  can inhibit the ubiquitination of BRI1. Ubiquitinated BRI1 is recognized by TASH3
  and internalized through the CME pathway, although it can also be internalized via
  the CIE pathway. The vesicles formed by endocytosis are transmitted to the TGN/EE,
  and finally through MVB enter the vacuole for degradation. During the endocytosis
  and transmission process, deubiquitinating enzymes UBP12/13 and AMSH3 can remove
  the ubiquitination from BRI1, allowing it to return to the cell membrane via vesicles.
  BIL4, localized on the vacuole membrane, also serves as a recognition protein for
  ubiquitinated BRI1 entering the vacuole. Misfolded BRI1 synthesized in the endoplasmic
  reticulum is recognized by the Hrd1 complex within the ERAD system, where ubiquitin
  molecules are transferred by ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC32 to E3 ligase HRD1,
  leading to K48 chain and proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm. OsSMG3 and SiSGD1
  can also utilize the ubiquitin molecules transferred by the UBC32 homologs OsDGS1
  and SiUBC32, resulting in BRI1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation
