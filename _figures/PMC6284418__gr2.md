caption: Mechanism of post-operative neuroinflammation.DAMPs and PAMPs activate the
  downstream pathway involved in inducing the production of TNFα, as well as other
  proinflammatory mediators via NF-κB. This causes the loss of blood-brain barrier
  (BBB) integrity, due to endothelial dysfunction occurs and increased permeability
  of the BBB. As a result, there is a recruitment of circulating lymphocytes into
  the neuronal tissue, and microglia and astrocytes are activated. Cytokines induce
  the synthesis and release of NO via inducible nitric oxide synthase from the activated
  microglia and astrocytes. Also, cytokines cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+.
  In addition, GSK-3 dysfunction occurs in neuroinflammation, which potentiates microglial
  activation and migration and stimulates cells to produce NO and TNFα via NF-κB activation.
  Subsequently, neuroinflammation leads to neuronal apoptosis, reduced hippocampal
  neurogenesis, impaired synaptic plasticity and a loss of synaptic connections. All
  of this, in turn, leads to neurodegenerative conditions such as post-operative cognitive
  dysfunction and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. BBB, blood brain barrier.
  DAMP, danger associated molecular pattern. GSK-3, Glycogen synthase kinase-3. iNOS,
  inducible nitric oxide synthase. NO, nitric oxide. TLR, toll like receptor.
