caption: NICE has recommended that autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients
  in England with chronic kidney disease stages 2 or 3 and evidence of rapidly progressive
  disease are eligible for treatment. This decision differs from that made by the
  Scottish Medicines Consortium and the European Medicines Agency in excluding patients
  with chronic kidney disease stage 1. Evidence of rapid disease progression has been
  defined as a significant decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate or increase
  in total kidney volume or both. In the absence of such evidence, risk prediction
  algorithms based on total kidney volume (Mayo Classification) or genotype (PROPKD)
  are the best predictors of prognosis. NICE, National Institute for Health and Clinical
  Excellence.
