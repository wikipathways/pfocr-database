caption: The regulation between TIGIT and immune cells. TIGIT could expressed on both
  cancer cell and immune cells such as T cell and NK cell. TIGIT inhibitors could
  suppress the inhibitory function and enhance the T cell and NK cell cytotoxic and
  anti-tumor function through upregulating the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α. The
  over expression of TIGIT of T cell could also cause T cell exhaustion, and down
  regulate the T cell cytotoxic. The NK cell activity could also be upregulation via
  antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity pathway.
