caption: The p53–p21–DREAM–E2F/CHR pathway. Indirect p53-dependent repression through
  DREAM. Induction of p53 leads to downregulation of genes. This regulation is indirect
  as p53 does not bind to the regulated genes. Instead, induction of p21/CDKN1A expression
  by p53 causes hypophosphorylation of p107 and p130. Hypophosphorylation of these
  pRB-related pocket proteins facilitates DREAM formation. DREAM complexes then displace
  the activating complexes FOXM1–B-MYB-MuvB (FOXM1-MMB) and E2F1-3/DP on the target
  promoters. (In the figure, LIN54 is the only labeled MuvB component.) Overall, this
  switch causes previously activated genes to be indirectly downregulation by p53
