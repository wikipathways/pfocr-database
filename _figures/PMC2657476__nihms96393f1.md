caption: 'EGFR is activated by ligand binding and subsequent receptor heterodimerization
  or homodimerization which leads to receptor autophosphorylation. EGFR can be transactivated
  by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). GRPR activates Src leading to activation
  of PDK1 and PI3K, whereby TACE cleaves EGFR proligand and activates EGFR. EGFR can
  also be transactivated by cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin from neighboring
  tumor cells. The EGFR-E-cadherin complex activates EGFR and leads to MAPK signaling
  allowing for cell survival during the early stages of metastasis. EGFR activation
  leads to five primary signaling cascades. 1) MAPK: EGFR phosphorylation recruits
  Grb2 and Sos (adaptor proteins) that bind EGFR at Y1092 and Y1110 or alternately
  Grb2 and Sos bind via Shc at Y1172 and Y1197. Raf-1 is activated and the MAPK signaling
  cascade is activated resulting in cell survival, proliferation and differentiation;
  2) STATs: STATs can be activated by interacting directly with EGFR or through Src-mediated
  EGFR signaling. Once phosphorylated STATs homodimerize or heterodimerize and are
  translocated to the nucleus where they induce the transcription of target genes
  that lead to cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, and apoptotic inhibition; 3)
  Src: Can be activated by binding directly to EGFR at Y915 and Y944 and can also
  activate EGFR by phosphorylating EGFR at Y845. Downstream of EGFR, Src can activate
  the STAT pathway or the PI3K pathway. Activation of Src is implicated in cell proliferation,
  migration, adhesion, angiogenesis and immune function; 4) PLCγ: Binds directly to
  EGFR and activates the MAPK pathway through PKC and the PI3K pathway leading to
  AKT activation. This results in migration and invasion; and 5) PI3K: Involved in
  many pathways and results in activation of AKT that leads to apoptotic resistance,
  cell growth, invasion and migration.'
