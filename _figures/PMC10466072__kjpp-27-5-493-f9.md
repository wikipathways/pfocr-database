caption: Ursolic acid (UA) plus 3,3’-diindolylmethane (DIM) combination treatment
  can induce apoptosis by promoting cleaved-PARP and caspase-9, increasing the G1
  phase by upregulating CDK4, CDK6, and Cyclin D1 protein expression, and inhibiting
  migration by regulating E-cadherin, MMP-9, and MMP-13 in esophageal squamous cell
  carcinoma (ESCC). UA plus DIM combination treatment lowered p-Akt and p-Gsk-3β expression
  in ESCC. UA plus DIM combination activated the Hippo signaling pathway leading to
  the inhibition of YAP de-phosphorylation and nuclear translocation and suppression
  of its downstream gene CTGF further restrained cell growth in ESCC. UA and DIM combination
  treatment induced the Hippo pathway activation by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway
  in ESCC. UA plus DIM combination treatment can induce YAP inhibition by conversely
  inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway through up-regulated PTEN. UA plus DIM stimulated
  a feedback loop between the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and Hippo signaling pathways
  in ESCC.
