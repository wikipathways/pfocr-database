caption: Pre-treated tumor with exhausted CD8+ T cells and tumor proliferating without
  immune inhibition. Radiation of tumors leads to double-stranded DNA breaks and downstream
  cGAS-STING signaling, which in turn increases Type 1 IFN release. Immunogenic cell
  death releases DAMPs such as HMGB1, HSP, GP96, and calreticulin. HMGB1 activates
  Dendritic Cells through TLR4-dependent pathway. Anti-CTLA-4 agents act on naïve
  and regulatory T cells while anti-PD-1 agents predominantly work on exhausted T
  cells.
