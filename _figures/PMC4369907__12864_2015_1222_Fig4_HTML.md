caption: 'Possible regulating processes of the differentially expressed HTRTs in rice
  grain cells in response to high night temperatures at the early milky stage. Blue
  arrow indicates the electron transport orientation; Red words indicate the differentially
  expressed HTRTs, and the arrow pointing to the box indicates the regulated pathway.
  TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle; FAD: flavin adenine dinucleotide; FMN: flavin mononucleotide;
  Q in the electron transport chain indicates ubiquinone (coenzyme Q, CoQ); Cyto:
  cytochrome; NO3−: nitrate; NO2−: nitrite.'
