caption: A simplified representation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and its
  role in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) pathogenesis. a In the absence of the Hh ligand,
  the full-length glioma-associated oncogene (GliFL) is phosphorylated by protein
  kinase A (PKA), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK 3), and casein kinase 1 (CK1). This
  results in cleavage of the full-length Gli into the Gli repressor (GliR) that acts
  downstream to prevent transcription of the target genes. b In the presence of the
  Hh ligand, Smoothened (Smo) protein is phosphorylated by PKA and CK1, which leads
  to the formation of the Gli activator (GliA) and in turn to activation of downstream
  transcription. PTCH Protein patched homolog 1
