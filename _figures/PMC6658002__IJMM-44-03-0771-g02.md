caption: Other stimuli leading to necroptosis. In addition to the TNF-α-mediated necroptosis
  pathway, multiple other necroptosis triggers have been identified. These involve
  the canonical pathway that requires RIP1 kinase activity, as well as the non-canonical
  pathway that is dependent on either the TRIF adaptor or the DAI sensor. RIP1-dependent
  stimuli include TNF-α, CD95L (also known as FASL), APO-1L, TRAIL (also known as
  APO-2L) and IFN-α/β. RIP1-independent stimuli include viruses (such as CMV), viral
  DNA, LPS and polycytidylic acid. After various necroptotic stimuli induce necroptosis,
  a necrosome is formed. Phosphorylated MLKL by RIP3 transfers from the cytosol to
  the plasma and intracellular membranes, causing destruction of membrane integrity
  and eventually necrotic death. TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RIP, receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine kinase; TRIF, TIR domain-containing interferon-β; DAI, DNA-dependent
  activator of IFN regulatory factors; FASL, Fas ligand; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis
  inducing ligand; IFN, interferon; CMV, cytomegalovirus; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain like protein.
