caption: A model of APPL1-regulated TAK1-MKK3-p38 MAPK pathway in response to Ad stimulation.
  C', indicates the COOH terminus of AdipoR1. Under the basal condition, APPL1 binds
  with inactive TAK1 and weakly associates with MKK3 and p38 MAPK. On Ad stimulation,
  APPL1 interacts with AdipoR1, leading to activation of TAK1 and, subsequently, recruitment
  of MKK3 and p38 MAPK to form a complex consisting of AdipoR1, APPL1, TAK1, MKK3,
  and p38 MAPK. Once MKK3 is activated, TAK1 dissociates from APPL1, and the activity
  of TAK1 is rapidly downregulated. This process occurs concurrently with the dissociation
  of APPL1 complex from AdipoR1 and, in turn, stimulates the downstream events regulated
  by TAK1-MKK3-p38 MAPK pathway.
