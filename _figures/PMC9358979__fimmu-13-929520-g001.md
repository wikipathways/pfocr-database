caption: Crosstalk of mitochondria homeostasis and immune signaling. Mitochondria
  support the major generation of reactive oxygen species(mROS) for modulating various
  signaling and cellular metabolism. Mitochondria produce ATP through the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA) oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) at electron transport chain
  (ETC) complexes. Detoxify free radicals from ETC complexes reduced by manganese
  superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) into water (H2O).
  GPX, as a catalase, also regulates the conversion balance of oxidized glutathione
  (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in mitochondria. Under the circumstance of
  oxidative stress that is stimulated by insults and exogenous pathogens, various
  DNA sensors trigger aberrant mitochondrial function by activation of pattern recognition
  receptors in the cytosol and mitochondria (e.g. retinoic-acid-inducible protein
  I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5), and Toll-like
  receptor(TLR)). Expulsion of highly immunogenic Ox-mtDNA out of mitochondria stimulates
  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1),
  Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor pyrin domain-containing
  protein 3 (NLRP3)-mediated IL-1β and IL-18 production, and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAS)
  and the cyclic GMP-AMP receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-dependent
  IFN-α. Under conditions of nutrient deprivation, AMPK inhibits energy-consuming
  pathways by mTORC1 for mitophagy activation. The HRES-1/Rab4-mediated dynamin-related
  protein 1 (Drp1) depletion reverses mitochondrial accumulation via mTOR-independent
  pathway. Mitochondrial respiration (ETC), mTORC1, and cGAS-STING signaling pathway
  serve as potential therapy targets. Several medications that targeting mitochondria
  metabolism process has been observed the therapeutic clinical effectiveness in SLE,
  including N-acetylcysteine (NAC), Rapamycin, Metformin, Mito Q, Hydroxychloroquine
  (HCQ), and Idenenone. The voltage-dependent anion selective channel (VDAC) oligomer
  inhibitor VBIT 4 can inhibit the release of mtDNA. I, II, III, IV, and V represent
  the electron transport chain complexes I–V. Glutathione reductase (GR).
