caption: PTHrP increases cell surface levels of integrin α6β4, which signals synergistically
  with growth factor receptors to activate the PI3-K/Akt pathway. This results in
  phosphorylation, and therefore inactivation of GSK-3. Since GSK-3 is known to phosphorylate
  c-myc, thereby targeting it to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, inactivation of
  GSK-3 results in increased c-myc levels and therefore decreased apoptosis. The PI3-K/Akt
  pathway also regulates the Bcl-2 family of proteins, resulting in decreased apoptosis.
  Thus, the net effect of intracrine PTHrP signaling in C4-2 cells is increased cell
  survival.
