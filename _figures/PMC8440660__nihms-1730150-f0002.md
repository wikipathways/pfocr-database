caption: Local neurotransmitters secreted by sympathetic (green) and sensory (yellow)
  neurons and circulating neurotransmitters and hormones from the vasculature (red)
  act directly on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) on the membrane of the bone marrow
  adipocytes. Depending on the summative activation of cytoplasmic G-stimulatory or
  G-inhibitory proteins, this has the potential to activate the cAMP/PKA signaling
  pathway (*), leading to the phosphorylation of lipid droplet-associated protein
  perilipin and a series of lipases including adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL),
  hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) that convert triglycerides
  to diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, and eventually to fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol
  that can be released from the adipocyte for energy use by other cells.
