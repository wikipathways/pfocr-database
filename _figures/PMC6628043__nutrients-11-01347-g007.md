caption: Biofunction analysis of differentially expressed genes from eWAT (A) Biofunction-overlay
  of the disease and function related to lipolysis in eWAT; (B) the disease and function
  in response to CLE in eWAT. Differentially expressed genes based on HFD compared
  to ND, and CLE and LU compared to HFD comparison for q- < 0.05, fold change > 1.5.
  ND, normal diet (AIN-76); HFD, high-fat diet (45% kcal from fat); CLE, HFD+chrysanthemum
  leaf ethanol extract (1.5%, w/w); LU, HFD+luteolin (0.003% w/w); eWAT, epididymal
  adipose tissue. Red indicates upregulation relative to HFD; green indicates downregulation
  relative to HFD. Orange color indicates activation of biofunction; blue color indicates
  inhibition of biofunction. Grey nodes indicate input genes into the pathway analysis
  and the different symbols indicate gene functions. Yellow nodes indicate inconsistent
  effect with predicted. Cross shape, disease; octagon shape, function; square, cytokine;
  triangle, phosphatase; horizontal oval, transcription regulator; vertical diamond;
  enzyme; circle, other.

  description: Biofunction analysis of differentially expressed genes from eWAT (A)
    Biofunction-overlay of the disease and function related to lipolysis in eWAT;
    (B) the disease and function in response to CLE in eWAT. Differentially expressed
    genes based on HFD compared to ND, and CLE and LU compared to HFD comparison for
    q- < 0.05, fold change > 1.5. ND, normal diet (AIN-76); HFD, high-fat diet (45%
    kcal from fat); CLE, HFD+chrysanthemum leaf ethanol extract (1.5%, w/w); LU, HFD+luteolin
    (0.003% w/w); eWAT, epididymal adipose tissue. Red indicates upregulation relative
    to HFD; green indicates downregulation relative to HFD. Orange color indicates
    activation of biofunction; blue color indicates inhibition of biofunction. Grey
    nodes indicate input genes into the pathway analysis and the different symbols
    indicate gene functions. Yellow nodes indicate inconsistent effect with predicted.
