caption: Representation of epidermal human cell infection by SARS-CoV-2 and antiviral
  mechanisms. TMPRSS2 cleaves the viral S protein into S1 and S2 subunits. The S1
  protein binds to ACE2 and S2 promotes the fusion of viral and cellular membranes,
  allowing the internalization of the virus. Viral RNA binds to TLR7, resulting in
  the activation of TBK1 and IRF, which are translocated to the cell nucleus, resulting
  in the gene transcription of type I IFN (α, β, and λ). Cellular infection by the
  virus and the inflammatory milieu can lead to DNA damage, mitochondrial stress,
  and cell death, resulting in the generation of cytosolic DNA. These pathogenic DNAs
  bind to cGAS, which activates the STING signaling pathway, resulting in the transcription
  of type I IFN genes. Type I IFNs bind to cellular receptors, activating the JAK-STAT
  intracellular pathway that results in the translocation of IRF to the nucleus and
  the transcription of ISGs. Image provided by Servier Medical Art (https://smart.servier.com/),
