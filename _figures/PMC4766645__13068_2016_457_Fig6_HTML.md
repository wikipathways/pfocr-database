  analysis. A schematic pathway of carbon import into the developing S. viridis fifth
  internode, showing the three major demands on carbon supply. A Mapman pathway file
  (Additional file  and Additional file ) was created to generate this visualisation
  of gene expression with regard to each carbon demand (also using the updated S.
  viridis mapping file, Additional file , and the experiment file, Additional file
  ). Genes were assigned into categories (as labelled on the diagram) and their expression
  values were displayed as squared log2 fold change from the squared average of the
  four internode zones for each gene. Up-regulated genes are shown in blue, whilst
  down-regulated genes are in red. The.mp4 animation (Additional file ) changes from
  meristematic zone (a), to cell expansion zone (b), to transition zone (c), to mature
  zone (d) indicating the internode region with a transparent grey box on the left
