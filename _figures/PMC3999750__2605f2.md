caption: Binding of FX to Adv5 increases infection of hepatocytes and enhances activation
  of macrophages. Adv5 without FX bound is recognized by immunoglobulin M (IgM) and
  complement and inactivated. This form of virus has a low infectivity and mildly
  activates the innate immune system by binding to integrins on liver macrophages.
  Binding of FX to Adv5 enhances infection of liver hepatocytes by increasing the
  binding of virus to the cells. In addition, Adv5 coated with FX induces a more robust
  innate immune response in macrophages by activating the TLR4-NF-κB pathway. KC,
  CXCL1. Professional illustration by Debra T. Dartez.
