caption: 'Lipid metabolic pathway. Exogenous fatty acids can be brought into cell
  via passive diffusion or FA transport or translocase proteins (CD36) across the
  membrane and be synthesized into PUFAs by the action of elongation of very long
  lipids protein. As a central substance in lipid metabolism, Acetyl‐CoA can be synthesized
  from a variety of sources and enter the lipid metabolism process: (1) Exogenous
  Acetate is synthesized into Acetyl‐CoA by ACSS2 after entering the cell. (2) Citric
  acid generated from glucose through the TCA cycle is synthesized into Acetyl‐CoA
  by the action of ACLY. (3) Glutamine is another potential source of acetyl coenzyme
  A, which is ultimately generated in the cytoplasm through the action of IDH2 and
  IDH1 in the mitochondria and cytoplasm, respectively. Acetyl coenzyme A can be synthesized
  into cholesterol by the action of enzymes such as ACAT, HMGCS, and HMGCR. It can
  also produce FA through ACC, FASN, SCD, and can be stored in the body as lipid droplets
  after glycerol‐3phosphate as a backbone, and release free fatty acids to generate
  energy for cells through mitochondrial FAO in energy deficiency. The regulation
  of key molecules in lipid metabolism is described in detail in the text. α‐KG, α‐ketoglutarate;
