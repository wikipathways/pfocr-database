caption: Figure 1. HSP-3 contains a C-terminal KDEL motif and an N-terminal signal
  sequence and is therefore predicted to be a resident ER protein. We diagram an alternative
  model to that suggested by Couillault et al. Given the chaperone activity and predicted
  ER localization of HSP-3, we suggest that HSP-3 does not play a direct role in signaling
  with NIPI-3 and TPA-1, which are likely cytoplasmic signaling proteins. Rather,
  HSP-3 may be required for the processing of an additional signaling molecule within
  the ER that matures through the secretory pathway and acts as an intermediate in
  signaling between NIPI-3 and TPA-1. Given that hsp-3 mutants have a Nipi phenotype,
  a prediction of this model is that mutations in the unidentified substrate may also
  produce a Nipi phenotype. We suggest that this unidentified molecule is a transmembrane
  protein, although it is also possible that it could encode a secreted membrane anchored
  protein. Loss of function mutations in this hypothetical hsp-3 client would act
  genetically upstream of tpa-1 but downstream of nipi-3, just as the authors described
  for hsp-3.
