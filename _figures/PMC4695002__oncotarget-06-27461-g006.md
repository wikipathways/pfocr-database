caption: 'STAT3, hsa-mir-21 and their regulatory targets are represented by nodes,
  while regulatory relationships among these are represented by edges. hsa-mir-21
  is represented by white diamond. Genes are color according to their biological function.
  Green edges link hsa-mir-21 to its precursor MIR21 and related gene VMP1. Grey edges
  represent TF: target relationships, magenta edges represent hsa-mir-21:target relationships.
  Shape of the nodes denotes expression status of genes from the meta-analysis of
  gene expression profiles in NSCLC. Downward oriented triangles denote downregulation,
  while those pointing up denote upregulation. Circles denote no significant differential
  expression. Size of the nodes corresponds to its centrality, measured by network
  betweenness. Red node highlight signifies putative TFs.'
