caption: Canonical Gαs/cAMP/PKA pathway at FSHR in target cells. The Gαs/cAMP/PKA
  pathway has been the most studied and is associated with various intracellular events.
  It is now acknowledged that PKA is not the sole target of cAMP accumulation. Indeed,
  EPAC is also activated upon FSH stimulation. Both PKA and EPAC contribute to the
  activation of MAPK, ERK and p38, whereas EPAC also leads to Akt activation. Solid
  lines represent facilitatory outcomes whereas, the dotted ones pertain to the inhibitory
  results. Adapted from Gloaguen et al.  under CC-By License.
