caption: A schematic representation of the signaling pathway showing the possible
  role for cyclic-AMP responsive element binding (CREB) protein and CREB-binding protein
  (CBP) in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. CREB is activated after its
  phosphorylation (pCREB) by different protein kinases, which further recruits CBP
  to bind to the DNA. CBP also has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity
  by which it increases histone aceylation and relaxes the chromatin, which in turn
  makes the DNA more accessible to the transcriptional machinery and thereby facilitates
  gene transcription.
