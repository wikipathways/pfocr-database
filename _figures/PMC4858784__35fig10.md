caption: EGF-Ras-ERK signaling promotes duct vs. G1 pore fate. (A) The biased competition
  model postulates that asymmetry in canal position results in the left member of
  the duct/G1 equivalence group receiving more canal-derived LIN-3/EGF signal and
  therefore becoming the duct cell (). An unknown lateral inhibitory mechanism ()
  prevents the cell on the right from receiving or responding to the EGF signal. (B)
  The EGF-Ras-ERK pathway acts via LIN-1/Ets and EOR-1 to promote duct fate (; ).
  Asterisks indicate potential ERK-dependent phosphorylation (; ). (C and D) Reduced
  EGF-Ras-ERK signaling causes a duct-to-G1 pore fate transformation. Constitutive
  signaling causes a G1 pore-to-duct fate transformation; the two ducts fuse to make
  a binucleate duct (; ). (E) In mosaics lacking let-60/Ras activity in the ABpl lineage,
  the duct and G1 pore progenitors switch fates (). (F) Physical or genetic ablation
  of the canal cell prevents duct and G1 pore tubulogenesis ().
