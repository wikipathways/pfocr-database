caption: Pathways of apoptosis. The ‘intrinsic’ and ‘extrinsic’ apoptosis pathways
  converge on the effector caspases, such as caspase 3, which promote the biochemical
  and morphological characteristics of apoptosis. The ‘extrinsic’ pathway is activated
  by cell-surface death receptors, such as Fas, and is mediated by activation of the
  initiator caspase, caspase 8, within a death-inducing signalling complex (DISC).
  The ‘intrinsic’ pathway is activated by a wide range of stimuli which trigger the
  release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, leading to the activation of a distinct
  initiator caspase, caspase 9, within the apoptosome. In some situations, the activation
  of caspase 8 can lead to the cleavage of Bid, which is also able to promote cytochrome
  c release. Bcl-2 family proteins play a key role in controlling mitochondrial function
  associated with the ‘intrinsic’ cell-death pathway, either preventing or promoting
  the release of cytochrome c.
