caption: 'D3M functioning in the whole-brain semantic memory network. A, The two-hub
  model of the semantic memory network. Many modality-specific cortical regions represent
  an aspect of conceptual knowledge (e.g., ‘apple’), an object feature (e.g., color
  of apple), and/or an object-associated feature (e.g., shape of apple tree). The
  links between each modality specific region and a supramodal hub region (PRC hub)
  are termed “spokes”. In cued-recall, the representation of object identity is activated
  in the PRC via the structural encoding process along the ventral visual pathway
  (green arrows) and then triggers retrieval of associated features or attributes
  of objects represented in the PRC itself, as well as those represented in lower-order
  cortical areas (red arrows). B, D3M provides essential circuit mechanisms required
  for driving the retrieval of nested associations of object-associated features in
  the distributed memory network by serial backward-propagating signaling through
  L5 and L6 (curved red arrow). In the PRC hub, D3M receives a high-level representation
  of the cue stimulus from the area TE and converts it to the to-be-recalled object
  representation [schema in thick magenta arrow; for details, see Hirabayashi et al.
  (2014))]. In brief, the conversion of the representations is performed by signal
  transfer between two functionally different classes of cells identified in the PRC:
  “cue-holding neurons” (CH, green), which hold information on the presented cue stimulus,
  and “pair-recall neurons” (PR, purple), whose delay activity encodes the to-be-recalled
  paired associate of the cue stimulus. Bars and arrows between neurons depict functional
  connectivity and directed interactions. This retrieval process starts when a cue
  stimulus is presented, and CH neurons exhibit strong responses. The CH neurons and
  PR neurons then interact, and the neuronal representations gradually shift to the
  sought target. Next, the firing rates of the PR neurons gradually increase, via
  mutual interactions among the PR neurons. Finally, the information of the to-be-recalled
  target is sent back through backward projections from L5/6 (curved red arrow). I
  propose that a similar mechanism for conversion of representations is at work in
  many areas of the semantic memory network.'
