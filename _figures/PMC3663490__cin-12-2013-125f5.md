caption: 'Graphical representation of the ATM biological pathway and its crosstalk
  with other biological pathways (P53, BRCA1, NF-kB) involved in (DNA damage, repair,
  apoptosis, cell-cycle) which are enriched for SNPs associated with increased risk
  of developing breast cancer.Notes: Gene symbols in red font represent genes containing
  SNPs associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Gene symbols
  in black font represent novel genes not reported in GWAS. Dual ring circles indicate
  complex regulation involving many genes. Lines and arrows indicate direction of
  regulation. Biological activities are indicated in the text mapped to rectangular
  shapes. Information on association of individual SNP-containing genes with individual
  subtypes of breast cancer is provided in Table B as supplementary material.'
