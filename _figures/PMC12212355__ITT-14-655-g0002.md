caption: Preventing T cell exhaustion and enhancing cytotoxicity through metabolic
  reprogramming. Knockout of regnase-1, overexpressing GLUT1, CARs secreting IL10
  and modifying CAR with 4–1BB strongly enhance oxidative phosphorylation, thereby
  leading to memory phenotype and intensive persistence to T cell exhaustion. Knockout
  of SIRT1, overexpressing GLUT1 and CD28 domain increase glycolysis and facilitating
  T cell differentiation. Knockout of RASA2 reinforces fatty acid oxygen, enhancing
  anti-PD-1 activity. Upregulating the expression of ADRB2 and IL10 inhibit PD-1 as
  well. Despite energy metabolism, T cell exhaustion can be decreased through the
  inhibiting SOCE signaling pathway and preventing endoplasmic reticulum stress. Knockout
  of regnase-1 and roquin-1 simultaneously activate NF-kB pathway, resulting in enhanced
  cytotoxicity. In addition, knockout of SIRT1 and knockdown of ADRB2 regulate the
  expression of transcription factors, increasing the level of GzmB and IFN-γ, leading
  to enhanced cytotoxicity as well. Created in BioRender. Su, S. (2025) https://BioRender.com/3s9395v
