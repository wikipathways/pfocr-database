caption: '(A) Study workflow. Washed platelet samples were prepared from five individual
  blood donors. Following lysis and trypsin digestion, meK-containing peptides were
  enriched, further purified and labeled with 10-plex TMT reagent. Labeled samples
  were combined and analyzed by LC-MS/MS to ultimately identify 190 meK modifications
  on 150 proteins and to quantify 34 peptides representing 28 meK modifications. (B)
  Representative MS2 and MS3 spectra identifying and quantifying EF1A1 K55 dimethylation
  in five platelet samples. (C) Plots of measured reporter ion intensities and (D)
  deviations from inter-subject mean reporter ion intensity for 25 peptides (numbered
  #1–25, as listed in panel 2D and ) representing 28 meK modifications (n=5). See  for
  individual reporter ion intensity measurements, coefficients of variation (CV) and
  other values. (E) A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of 150 lysine methylated
  proteins identified in platelets was generated from a query of Pathway Commons using
  ChiBE. Gray connecting lines represent “in complex” relations. (F) Preliminary model
  putatively placing selected lysine methylated proteins identified in this study
  (CALM, BiP, ADCY10, EEF1A1, EF2, etc.) into well-established receptor signaling,
  secretory, trafficking, protein translation and cytoskeletal remodeling processes
  in platelet regulation.'
