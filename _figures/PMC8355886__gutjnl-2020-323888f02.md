caption: HDV life cycle, spreading pathways and drug targets. HDV virions first attach
  to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and then to the viral receptor NTCP to
  enter host cells. After membrane fusion, the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is released
  and further transported to the nucleus to initiate RNA replication. The incoming
  genome (G) serves as the template for the first rolling circle amplification. The
  resulting antigenome (AG) multimers are cleaved in cis by the intrinsic ribozyme
  and ligated into circular monomers. After a second rolling cycle using the AG as
  the template, HDV G multimers are synthesised and further cleaved to produce monomers.
  The HDV AG might be edited by ADAR1, yielding an extended HDAg ORF that produces
  L-HDAg, some of that is further prenylated. S-HDAg and L-HDAg (intact and prenylated)
  are transported into the nucleus to regulate virus replication or bind to the HDV
  RNA to form RNP. The G-containing RNP can be exported to the cytoplasm and encapsulated
  into HBV envelope through the interaction between L-HDAg and S-HBsAg. HDV virions
  are released through the ER-Golgi secretory pathway. besides the HBV envelope-dependent
  de novo infection, HDV can also spread through division of infected cells in an
  HBV-independent manner (below). Bulevirtide (BLV) blocks de novo infection by efficient
  binding of the viral receptor NTCP. Lonafarnib (LNF) prevents the prenylation of
  L-HDAg by inhibiting the farnesyl transferase and consequently impairs HDV assembly
  and secretion. The target(s) of nucleic acid polymer (NAP) is unclear. It may inhibit
  assembly/release of HDV virions and/or HDV ribonucleoprotein assembly via direct
  interaction with the HDAg. IFNs, including MDA5-mediated HDV-induced IFNs and therapeutic
  IFNα and IFNλ, induce IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) which profoundly suppress HDV
  amplification during cell division. HBV, hepatitis B virus; HDV, hepatitis D virus;
  IFN, interferon; L-HDAg, large hepatitis D antigen; NTCP, sodium taurocholate cotransporting
  polypeptide; S-HBsAg, small hepatitis B surface antigen.
