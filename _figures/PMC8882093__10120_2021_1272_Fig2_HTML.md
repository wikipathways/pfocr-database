caption: The localized inflammatory response upon the infection of gastric epithelial
  cells by H. pylori (HP). Gastric epithelial responses to HP infection through the
  actions of CagA and VacA result in activation of cell survival through Mcl-1 protein
  induction and autophagy regulation. IL1β and IL-8 expression (red arrows) is also
  upregulated which induce the influx of inflammatory cells. Persistent inflammation
  upregulates the expression of a number of cytokines and chemokines (pale green box),
  which can contribute to epithelial gastric cancer cells differentiating to mesenchymal
  cells. Such signaling cues can also enhance the expression and secretion of cathepsin
  proteases (yellow box and arrows), which can act on modifying the extracellular
  matrix (ECM, black box), along with cathepsins derived from tumor-associated fibroblasts
  (TAFs), -macrophages (TAMs) and tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (TINs). As contributing
  mechanisms to gastric cancer progression, cathepsins can also target the cleavage
  of cell–cell junctions (black tabs), the expression of which can also be negatively
  modulated upon the activation of signal transduction pathway intermediates by CagA
  and VacA (blue box)
