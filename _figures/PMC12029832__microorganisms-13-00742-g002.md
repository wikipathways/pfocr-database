caption: The representation of various NPN-synthesized feed proteins in the nitrogen
  cycle network. Ammonia in the nitrogen cycle pathway originates from the reduction
  and conversion of nitrate and nitrite, atmospheric dinitrogen capture, and urea
  decomposition. Protein synthesis requires ammonia to undergo a series of biochemical
  reactions, including converting ammonia to glutamine and α-ketoglutarate, and α-ketoglutarate
  to glutamate, which acts as an amino acid residue for protein synthesis. The color/thin
  line represents the nitrogen cycle network, and the black/thick line illustrates
  the conversion of NPN into feed protein. NR, nitrate reductase; NiR, nitrite reductase;
  GS, glutamine synthetase; GOGAT, glutamate synthetase; UC, urea carboxylase
