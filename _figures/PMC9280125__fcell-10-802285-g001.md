caption: Homocysteine metabolism is dependent on folate and methionine metabolism.
  Folic acid is reduced to dihydrofolate by the action of dihydrofolate reductase
  (DHFR), which together with dietary dihydrofolate is reduced further to tetrahydrofolate
  (THF), which enters the folate metabolic cycle. Alternatively, folate may enter
  the folate cycle as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), with folate cycle metabolism
  involved in the transfer of one-carbon units to generate thymidylate and purines
  for nucleotide biosynthesis. Methionine acts as the precursor for the ATP-dependent
  synthesis of the primary methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which through the
  action of methyltransferases transfer methyl groups to various acceptors (R-) resulting
  in the methylation of DNA, proteins and lipids, whilst generating S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH). SAH is catabolized to homocysteine by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY).
  Homocysteine can be metabolised by three metabolic pathways. 1) Remethylation of
  homocysteine to methionine relies on 5-MTHF as methyl donor, catalysed by the vitamin
  B12-dependent action of methionine synthase (MS). THF is then re-cycled to form
  5-MTHF, catalysed by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). 2) Betaine can
  be utilized as an alternative methyl donor to generate methionine and dimethylglycine
  (DMG), catalysed by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). 3) Alternatively,
  homocysteine can enter the transsulphuration pathway being converted to cysteine
  through the action of cystathionine β-synthase (CβS).
