caption: Schematic representation of glucose and glutamine metabolism in cancer cells.
  After entering the cell through specific transporters (GLUT), glucose is metabolised
  to pyruvate. In cancer cells, pyruvate is mainly converted to lactate by the lactate
  dehydrogenase A (LDHA), while its catabolism in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  is restricted through the inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) induced by HIF-1. Glycolysis
  (bold arrows) generates also another important intermediate, glucose-6-phosphate
  (glucose-6-P) that is metabolised by the pentose phosphate pathway (blue arrows),
  which produces NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate for glutathion and nucleic acids synthesis.
  Glutaminolysis (purple arrows) is an alternative energy source for cancer cells.
  First converted to glutamate by glutaminase (GLS) in the cytosol, glutamine replenishes
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (anaplerosis) through the conversion of glutamate
  to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Glutaminolysis contributes also to synthesis of lipids,
  amino acids, nucleotides and generation of lactate that is transported out of the
  cell by the ubiquitous monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and the hypoxia inducible
  MCT4. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD),
  mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), oxaloacetate (OAA), l-type amino acid transporter
  1 (LAT1), Asc-type amino acid transporter 2 (ASCT2)
