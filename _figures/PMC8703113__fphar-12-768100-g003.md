caption: Cav-1 mediates protein membrane targeting and regulates cellular metabolism.
  When cells are subjected to harmful external stimuli (such as high glucose and oxidative
  stress), the transcription levels of CAV1 increase, which promotes the formation
  of caveolae on the cell membrane. The expressed Cav-1 can then recruit receptors
  such as IGF-IR, glucose transporter, and LOX-1 to caveolae and bind there to Cav-1
  and subsequently regulate glucose or lipid metabolism by mediating specific receptor
  signals. In addition, under high glucose conditions, blocking autophagy induced
  by the AMPK-MTOR-PIK3C3 pathway reduces the degradation of Cav-1 by autophagy, resulting
  in increased expression of cavin and Cav-1. The high expression of Cav-1 recruits
  LC3B and binds together to inhibit the formation of autophagosomes, further inhibiting
  autophagic degradation of Cav-1 and leading to an increase in the formation of caveolae,
  which eventually mediates increased endocytosis of low-density apolipoprotein.
