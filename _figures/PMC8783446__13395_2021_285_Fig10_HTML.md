caption: Pathway analysis suggests cross-talk between interconnected survival signaling
  pathways and sarcolemmal sarcoglycans, dystrophin, and archvillin. The gene names
  of proteins co-immunoprecipitating with or binding to Sgcg as shown here were arranged
  in the default Organic View using IPA software. Eleven of 13 Top Candidate Sgcg
  interactors, as well as 3 of 5 Other Candidate interactors (Fig. ), were assigned
  to either the TP53/ESR2/TRIM25-associated signaling network or to the sarcoglycan,
  dystrophin, dystroglycan-associated sarcolemmal network. Colors highlight SGCG (magenta),
  SVIL (yellow), NKCC1/SLC12A2 (green), additional Top Candidate Interactors (blue)
  and Other Candidate Interactors (gray). Additional genes (white) and direct (solid
  lines) and indirect (dashed lines) interactions were added by the IPA software.
  Interactions involving the B-Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 signaling cascade (orange)
  with β-dystroglycan/DAG [] and SVIL [] were added manually
