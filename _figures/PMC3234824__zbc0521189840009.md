caption: Diagrammatic illustration of signaling pathway involved in the regulation
  of miR-10b by CCN5 in breast cancer cells. Under CCN5-free microenvironment, phosphorylates
  JNK resulting in activation of JNK pathway inducing HIF-1α synthesis or stability,
  which in turn up-regulates TWIST1, resulting in up-regulation of miR-10b from HOXD
  cluster (), promoting migration of breast cancer cells. All the cascades are absent
  or minimal in CCN5-positive breast cancer cells or may be reversed if CCN5 is activated
  in CCN5-negative breast cancer cells. (+) indicates positive effect, and (−) indicates
  negative effect.
