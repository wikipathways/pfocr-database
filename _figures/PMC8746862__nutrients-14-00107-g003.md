caption: AX partially induces the antioxidant defense system while inhibiting the
  ROS-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway. AX inhibits ROS-mediated activation
  of canonical NFκB signaling and related signals such as JAK/STAT3. Consequently,
  the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression is suppressed, resulting
  in attenuation of inflammatory signals. On the other hand, AX produces partial activation
  of Nrf2 via dissociation of Nrf2/Keap-1 by electrophiles, and/or other pathways.
  Consequently, antioxidant enzymes are induced and act in an anti-inflammatory function
  in vivo. Thus, AX suppresses the exacerbation cycle of chronic inflammation and
  shifts the cycle toward improvement. The regulation of these inflammation-related
  signaling pathways by AX involve a mixture of acute-phase responses to AX that result
  from ROS scavenging, modulation of phosphorylation and protein modifications related
  to the regulation of intracellular Redox balance, modulation of adaptor protein
  association with receptors, and the more chronic induction of gene expression mediated
  by these results. In this figure, lipid rafts and precise and detailed signal pathways
  are not shown to avoid complications. In particular, it has been reported that AX
  affects the points indicated by the orange arrows. This figure was adapted from
  the reference [,].
