caption: 'Model of Cripto’s inhibition of Act B signaling through the Smad2 pathway.
  Left: Activin (black) signaling via Alk4 (red), ActRII (blue), and Smad2 leads to
  regulated cell proliferation in many tissues and organs. Right: Cripto-dependent
  Nodal (yellow) signaling through Smad2 leads to differentiation and patterning in
  the early embryo. Cripto is represented in green. Center: Cripto inhibits Act B
  signaling via binding to Alk4 and Act B, resulting in deregulated growth and hyperproliferation.
  Three possible inhibitory complexes are proposed: Cripto/Act B, Cripto/Alk4, and
  Cripto/Act B/Alk4. Smad2-p, phospho-Smad2.'
