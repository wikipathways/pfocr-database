caption: The FAO pathway. FAs are activated to fatty acyl-CoA by fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.
  On the outer mitochondrial membrane, fatty acyl-CoA is converted to fatty acylcarnitine
  by CPT1 and shuttled into the mitochondrial matrix. CPT2 on the matrix side of the
  inner membrane then reconverts acylcarnitine to acyl-CoA, which is cleaved into
  acetyl-CoA by a repeated four-step cycle catalyzed sequentially by the activity
  of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase,
  and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, resulting in the shortening of FAs by two carbons in
  each cycle. The breakdown product acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle, and the produced
  NADH and FADH2 are coenzymes used in the electron transport chain to generate ATP.
  CACT, carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase; IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane; OMM,
