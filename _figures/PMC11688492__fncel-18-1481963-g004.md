caption: Schematic overview of the molecular mechanisms related to astrocytes activation
  by the SARS-CoV-2 and S protein. “Astrogliosis” astrocyte activation can be mediated
  by interplay between CD147/DPP4 and NRP1 receptors and SARS-CoV-2 and S protein.
  CD147/DPP4 activation may enhance proinflammatory cytokines, VEGF production and
  NRP1 activation. Furthermore, VEGF-VEGF-R2/NRP1 is able to induce angiogenesis,
  migration and disruption of TJ proteins in BBB capillary endothelial cells. In addition,
  excess VEGF can activate the ADAM9/10 metalloproteinases with the consequent release
  of the extracellular domain of NRP1 and cytoplasmic tail, inhibiting the VEGF-NRP1
  signaling pathway in a negative feedback fashion. Figure created with BioRender.com
