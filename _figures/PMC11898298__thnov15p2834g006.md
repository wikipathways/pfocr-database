caption: 'Model of ironomycin cytotoxic effects alone and in combination with other
  drugs. (A) Ironomycin sequesters iron in lysosomes triggering different cellular
  responses: (1) the production of ROS through the Fenton reaction that cause peroxidation
  of lipids, which require GPX4 activity to be detoxified, and DNA damage that will
  cause cell cycle arrest; (2) impairment of mitochondrial metabolism and ATP production;
  (3) ER stress characterized by the activation of UPR, notably the IRE1α signaling
  pathway. High levels of lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, mitochondrial activity impairment
  and sustained ER stress lead to ferroptosis and apoptosis. Combination of ironomycin
  with BH3 mimetics have a synergistic toxic effect in MCL cells. (B) Ironomycin downregulates
  BCR-signaling and synergizes with ibrutinib. Combination of both drugs further increases
  a sustained UPR that leads to apoptosis. Figures were created with Biorender.com'
