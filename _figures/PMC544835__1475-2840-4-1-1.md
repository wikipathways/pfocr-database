caption: Reverse Cholesterol Transport. This figure demonstrates the process of reverse
  cholesterol transport. It begins in the arterial vessel wall and with the assistance
  of the ATP binding cassette transporter A-1 (ABCA-1) and in collaboration with the
  Apo A-1 protein attached to the outer shell of the nascent HDL-C lipoprotein particle
  free cholesterol is internalized within the HDL-C lipoprotein particle. The enzyme
  lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) esterifies free cholesterol (FC) via
  a lipidation process and internalizes it within the HDL-3, which matures to a larger
  HDL-2 lipoprotein particle. From this point in time the HDL-3 and 2 particles can
  enter the hepatic cycle via the Scavenger Receptor B-1 and subsequently excreted
  in the bile. The alternative pathway is for the larger HDL-C apoA-1 lipoprotein
  particles to undergo a transference of the cholesterol esters through an exchange
  process with triglycerides via cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) to the
  ApoB-100 lipoprotein particles and enter the liver for further metabolism via the
  low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to be subsequently excreted in the bile.
