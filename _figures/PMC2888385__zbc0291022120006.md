caption: Model of Nodal-Smad2 signaling regulation of the BMP pluripotency pathway
  in mouse ES cells. Nodal-Smad2 signaling regulates a significant number of genes
  in undifferentiated ES cells. Positively regulated targets include genes characteristic
  of the mesendoderm developmental lineage. Genes negatively regulated by Nodal signaling
  include some trophoblast markers; the mechanism of this regulation remains to be
  determined. The regulation of Id gene expression by Nodal-Smad2 is indirect, via
  the BMP signaling pathway. The transcriptional regulation of Smad7 by Nodal signaling
  is the major contributor to the modulation of the BMP signaling pathway. BMP pathway
  activation and Id gene expression are essential components to maintain ES cell pluripotency.
