caption: (A) The structure of the FGF receptor (FGFR). (B) FGFs signal through receptor
  tyrosine kinases, which have intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity in their
  cytosolic domains. Binding of dimeric FGFs causes receptor dimerization, which leads
  to a conformational shift in the receptor structure that activates the intracellular
  kinase domains and causes intermolecular transphosphorylation. These phosphorylated
  tyrosine residues then function as docking sites for adaptor proteins which themselves
  may be directly phosphorylated by FGFR, leading to the activation of multiple signal
  transduction pathways, including the PI3K-AKT pathway (blue), the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk
  (MAPK) pathway (orange) and the phospholipase C/Ca2+pathway (green). (C) Proposed
  model for the different epithelial responses to FGF10 (migration) versus FGF7 (proliferation)
  via FGFR2b. FGF10 specifically induces phosphorylation of Y734 of FGFR2b, which
  leads to the recruitment of PI3K and SH3bp4 resulting in receptor recycling and
  sustained signaling. Y734 does not get phosphorylated in response to FGF7 leading
  to receptor degradation and transient signaling. See main text for details.
