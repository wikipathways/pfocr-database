caption: A working model of time‐restricted improves the reproductive function of
  female mice via liver FGF21. Time‐restricted feeding increased fertility and prevented
  hypothalamic hypogonadism. FGF21 directly acted on GnRH neurons to modulate GnRH
  secretion via ERK1/2 pathway. Liver FGF21 signaling was involved in the beneficial
  effect of time restricted feeding on fertility
