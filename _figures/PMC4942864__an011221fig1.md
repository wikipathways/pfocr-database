caption: Overview of leucine metabolism. BCATc and BCATm catalyze the first step in
  leucine degradation by transferring nitrogen from leucine to α-ketoglutarate to
  produce glutamate and KIC. After leucine is metabolized to KIC, KIC is either metabolized
  into isovaleryl-CoA by BCKDC or into HMB by an enzyme referred as to KIC dioxygenase
  (). Alternatively, one of the derivatives of isovaleryl-CoA, MC-CoA, can be converted
  into HMB. Ultimately, these metabolites yield acetoacetyl-CoA and acetoacetate and
  are used for energy production. Apart from being metabolized, leucine stimulates
  protein synthesis by activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway. BCATc, cytosolic branched-chain
  aminotransferase; BCATm, mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase; BCKDC, branched-chain
  α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex; HMB, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate; KIC, α-ketoisocaproate;
  MC-CoA, β-methyl-crotonyl-CoA; mTORC1, complex 1 of the mammalian target of rapamycin;
  S6K, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase; 4E-BP1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E–binding
  protein 1.
