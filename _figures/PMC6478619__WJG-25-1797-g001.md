caption: 'Yes-associated protein and WW-domain-containing transcriptional co-activator
  with PDZ-binding motif is a point of convergence in signaling pathways. A network
  that involves activated Ras, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and tyrosine kinase
  receptors positively regulates Yes-associated protein and WW-domain-containing transcriptional
  co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (YAP/TAZ) activity via Rho/PKD/organization
  of the actin cytoskeleton and PI3K/AKT/mTORC1. The interaction of mTORC1 and YAP
  is explained in the text. In addition, the localization and activity of YAP/TAZ
  is negatively impacted by the Hippo pathway which mediates phosphorylation of YAP
  and thereby its cytoplasmic sequestration. Metformin and statins inhibit YAP/TAZ
  activity at different sites in the network. Stimulatory effects are shown by black
  arrows whereas inhibitory effects are indicated by red arrows. YAP/TAZ: Yes-associated
  protein and WW-domain-containing transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif;
  GPCR: G protein-coupled receptor.'
