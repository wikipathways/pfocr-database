caption: Figure 3. The differentially methylated genes in EA interact in three networks.
  Network 1 is constituted by 35 genes and several key nodes and includes purine metabolism
  as the most significant pathway. Network 2 is enriched in 6 G-protein-coupled receptors
  mainly involved in calcium signaling while 15 genes in Network 3 bear the node HMMR,
  indicating ECM remodeling relation pathways. Known and predicted protein-protein
  interactions (identified at confidence score > 0.7) are shown. Only the networks
  with at least one node consisting of more than 3 neighbors are displayed.
