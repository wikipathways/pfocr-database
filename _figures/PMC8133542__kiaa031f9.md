caption: Proposed model for the induction of APX6 transcript accumulation responding
  to senescence promoting stimuli via the ABA-dependent pathway. ABA induces the transcriptional
  activation of the APX6 promoter, directly or indirectly, by yet unknown transcription
  factors (TFs). Previous studies (i) provided evidence indirectly linking ABA INSENSITIVE5
  (ABI5) as a plausible upstream regulator of APX6 expression—thus, the question mark.
  APX6 is also negatively regulated transcriptionally by miR398 via the activity of
  its master regulator SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE7 (SPL7). We suggest
  that while miR398 suppresses its canonical targets COPPER/ZINC SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE1
  (CSD1), CSD2, and others, it is also moonlighting on APX6, and perhaps other targets
  not directly linked to copper distribution control. Under copper sufficient conditions,
  the expression of SPL7 decreases with the age of the plant and leaves promoting
  the accumulation of APX6 transcripts. ABA suppresses the expression of SPL7, further
  enhancing the age- and stress-dependent expression of APX6 (ii). In contrast, Cu
  deficiency, inhibiting ABA biosynthesis and signaling (iii), decreasing APX6 expression
  in a two-prong manner, suppressing the ABA signaling pathway while increasing the
  SPL7-mediated Cu-redistribution response.
