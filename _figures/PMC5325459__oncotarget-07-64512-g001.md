caption: 5mC is catalyzed by DNA methyltransterases (DNMTs) via the addition of a
  methylgroup at the 5-position of cytosine. TET family proteins (TET1/2/3) catalyze
  the stepwise oxidation of 5mC to yield 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC. 5fC and 5caC are able
  to be recognized and excised by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and replaced with
  unmethylated cytosines through the base excision repair (BER) machinery, leading
  to the active demethylation. An alternative active demethylation pathway may be
  achieved via deamination of 5hmC to 5-hydroxymethyluridine (5hmU) by AID/APOBEC
  enzymes, followed by BER. However, this deamination mechanism is controversial.
  During DNA replication, the downregulation or loss of the maintenance activity of
  DNMT1 dilutes the level of 5mC after each cell cycle, which results in passive demethylation.
  DNMT3A and DNMT3B could display a reduction-oxidation state-dependent DNA dehydroxymethylase
  activity, opening a simple pathway for the direct conversion of 5hmC to C. The stem-cell
  nuclear extracts could be capable of achieving the decarboxylation of 5caC, indicating
  the stem-cell nuclear extracts may be a decarboxylase. In a proportion of gliomas
  and breast cancers, a possible mechanism that leads to decreased levels of 5hmC
  by Eleftheriou et al. is that TET proteins are preactivated in certain cancer-related
  environment resulting in the preferential catalytic conversion of 5mC to 5caC and
  5fC, instead of 5hmC.
