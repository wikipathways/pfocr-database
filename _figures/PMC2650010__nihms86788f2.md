caption: 'The mTOR pathway is regulated by mitogen-responsive signaling pathways (shown
  in green), as well as by pathways that signal the availability of nutrients, such
  as amino acids (shown in yellow), and intracellular energy (shown in blue). Mitogens
  activate mTOR independently of Akt through the Ras/Mek/ERK pathway, the Wnt signaling
  pathway, and through activation of phospholipase D. Amino acids also activate mTOR
  through multiple mechanisms: activation of Vps34, MAP4K3, the Rag family of GTPases,
  and phospholipase D. However, the mechanisms by which some of these proteins activate
  mTOR are not well understood, and there may be crosstalk between these pathway components.
  Conversely, conditions that deplete intracellular energy, such as hypoxia, inhibit
  the mTOR pathway. One mechanism by which this occurs is through activation of AMPK.
  AMPK is activated by increases in intracellular AMP, as well as by the upstream
  kinases, LKB1 and CaMKKβ. AMPK inhibits the mTOR pathway directly through phosphorylation
  of Raptor and indirectly through phosphorylation and activation of TSC2. Although
  hypoxia can inhibit the mTOR pathway through activation of AMPK, it also inhibits
  mTOR through increased expression of the hypoxia-inducible-factor-1 target gene,
  REDD1. The tuberous sclerosis complex TSC1/TSC2 and Rheb GTPase (shown in grey)
  integrate signals from mitogen-responsive and energy and nutrient-sensing pathways
  to regulate mTORC1 (shown in red).'
