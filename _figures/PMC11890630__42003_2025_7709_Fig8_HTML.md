caption: a Chronic inflammation under obese conditions, alters circadian gene expression
  through interferon-mediated responses of IRFs.In consequence, induces the expression
  of the NFKB p65 subunit RELA and the core clock transcription factor MAX at stages
  S2 and S3, disrupting the circadian translational transcriptional feedback loop
  (TTFL) mechanism55,58 and affecting the expression of key CCGs. MAX, further exacerbates
  cellular dysfunction by repressing NPR1 and PLN, disrupting the pro-thermogenic
  cGMP signaling pathway65,131 and impairing the Ca2+ cycling of the SERCA2-mediated
  futile cycle102. The Ca2+ channel TRPV4 inhibits the expression of PPARGC1A and
  induces inflammation72, which, in turn, activates the STATs transcription factors,
  inducing NLRP3-inflammasome and pro-apoptotic genes, leading to a mitochondrial-to-nucleus
  retrograde signaling (MTNRS), contributing to reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity73,132.
  In later stages, MAX may negatively regulate SIRT1-mediated activation of PPARGC1A68,104–107
  and the inhibition of the NLRP3-inflammasome133,134. Chromatin remodelers further
  regulate thermogenic and senescence-related genes28,29. b Environmental conditions
  induce a pro-inflammatory cascade, propelling a self-perpetuating vicious cycle
  that promotes cellular dysfunction, amplifies inflammation, and accumulates cellular
  and molecular defects, thereby exacerbating the progression of T2D
