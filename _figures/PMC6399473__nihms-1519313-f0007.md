caption: (A-C) ApoA-V is required for the clearance of large TRL particles. By biding
  both TRLs and GPIHBP1/HSPG that tethers LPL, apoA-V facilitates the interaction
  between TRLs and LPL and stimulates LPL-mediated TRL-TG clearance. Under a normal
  non-stressed situation, TRL particles are scarce, resulting in only moderate increases
  in plasma TGs in apoA-V deficiency (A). Under metabolic stresses that increase the
  production of TRLs (B, C), these particles accumulate in the absence of apoA-V.
  SREBP-1c is essential for the accumulation of large VLDLs (B), but not CMs (C),
  via its essential role in the production of large VLDL particles. LPL, lipoprotein
  lipase; GPIHBP1, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding
  protein 1; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan.
