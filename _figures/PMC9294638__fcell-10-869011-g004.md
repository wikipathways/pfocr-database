caption: A schematic diagram of the role of several miRNAs in the senescence process
  through regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade. Mounting evidence has demonstrated
  that aberrant expression of various miRNAs could be correlated with cellular senescence.
  As an illustration, a recent study has detected that miR-221 could play a crucial
  role in modulating proliferation, chemotherapy sensitivity and senescence in lung
  cancer cells via downregulating PTEN and upregulating AKT expression levels ().
  Moreover, another research has revealed that high glucose could result in premature
  senescence of human glomerular mesangial cells via reducing miR-126 and p-Akt expression
  levels and promote in the expression of p53, p21 and Rb proteins in the high-dose
  d-glucose group (). Furthermore, another study has detected that miR-21 could elevate
  cardiac aging induced by D-gal and Dox via suppressing PTEN (). In addition, miR-34a-3p
  could enhance the senescence of dental pulp stem cells via inhibiting CAB39 expression
  through the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway (). Green lines indicate the positive regulatory
  effect among miRNAs and their targets, and red lines depict negative one among them.
