caption: Signalling through the JAK–STAT pathway. (1) The signal through the JAK–STAT
  pathway is initiated when a ligand (e.g. cytokines, growth factors, hormones) binds
  to its corresponding transmembrane receptor. (2) Ligand binding causes receptor
  dimerization. (3) This leads to the activation of the receptor-associated members
  of JAKs through proximity‐mediated trans‐phosphorylation. (4) JAKs are endowed with
  a phosphorylation site. This mediates the phosphorylation of a specific tyrosine
  residue of the receptor, which then becomes a docking site for latent cytoplasmic
  STAT proteins. (5) Inactive STAT proteins associate with the phosphorylated receptor,
  allowing the JAK protein to phosphorylate its C‐terminus on a single tyrosine residue.
  (6) Activated STATs then dissociate from the receptor, dimerize, and translocate
  to the nucleus. (7) Here, they bind to nuclear DNA. This allows the transcription
  of specific DNA-targeted genes that encode for molecules involved in processes of
  proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. (8) The signal transduction to the
  nucleus is turned-off by inhibiting molecules, such as suppressors of cytokine signalling
  and protein tyrosine phosphatases.
