caption: In the canonical pathway (left), stimulation of TNF receptors (TNFR), IL-1
  receptors (IL-1R) or Toll-like receptors (TLR) with their cognate ligands activates
  TRAF proteins and subsequently the kinase TAK1, which phosphorylates and activates
  IKKβ. IKKβ then phosphorylates IκB resulting in its ubiquitination by the SCF-βTrCP
  ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. The NF-κB
  dimer consisting of p50 and Rel-A can then enter the nucleus to regulate the expression
  of targets genes involved in inflammation, immunity and cell survival. In the non-canonical
  pathway, a subset of receptors belonging to the TNFR superfamily, such as the B
  cell receptor for BAFF (BAFF-R), activates the kinase NIK through an unknown mechanism.
  NIK then phosphorylates IKKα, which in turn phosphorylates the NF-κB precursor p100.
  p100 is subsequently polyubiquitinated and then processed to the mature subunit
  p52 by the proteasome. p52 and its binding partner Rel-B translocate to the nucleus
  to turn on genes that are important for the maturation of B cells.
