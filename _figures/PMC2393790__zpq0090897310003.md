caption: Citrate cycle genes are up-regulated in the brains of nurse bees. Gene expression
  in whole brains of nurse bees and foragers was measured on cDNA microarrays ().
  Expression data were mapped to pathway diagrams compiled by KEGG. P values are based
  on ANOVA described in ref. . Abbreviations for gene names are based on SwissProt
  naming conventions. N.S., Not significant.
