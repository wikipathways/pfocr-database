caption: Schematic diagram of mechanism on this research. The Keap1/Nrf2 signaling
  pathway is closely involved in the pathogenesis and progression of T1DM. The Keap1/Nrf2
  signaling pathway could effectively suppress ALX-stimulated intracellular ROS overproduction
  to protect pancreatic β-cell from oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, thereby contributing
  to the suppression of T1DM development. Conversely, inhibition of the Keap1/Nrf2
  signaling pathway significantly promotes the progression of T1DM.
