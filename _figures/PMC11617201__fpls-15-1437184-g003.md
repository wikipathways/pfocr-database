caption: 'Biosynthesis and catabolism metabolic pathways of abscisic acid (ABA) in
  higher plants. The biosynthesis and catabolism pathways of ABA represent pivotal
  aspects of plant physiology research. ABA biosynthesis predominantly occurs in plastids
  and cytosol, with C40 β-carotenoids serving as the primary precursors. 9-cis-Cyclocarotenoid
  dioxygenase (NCED) acts as a crucial rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis pathway.
  Additionally, hydrolysis of ABA-GE provides free ABA, constituting another essential
  mechanism for regulating ABA concentration in plants. ABA catabolism primarily involves
  two pathways: hydroxylation and glucosylation. With the assistance of enzymes, ABA
  is metabolized into inactive metabolites, which no longer exhibit biological activity
  in plant growth and development'
