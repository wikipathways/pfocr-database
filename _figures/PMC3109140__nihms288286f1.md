caption: A. ChIP analysis of endonuclease-induced DSBs. The HO endonuclease in yeast,
  and the I-SceI and I-PpoI homing endonucleases in mammalian cells, have been used
  to induce DSBs. While HO and I-PpoI cut endogenous recognition sequences, the I-SceI
  recognition sequence is introduced into the genome by stable transfection. Factor
  binding or modification in the vicinity of DSB sites can be analyzed by ChIP using
  specific PCR primers.B. Fluorescent microscopy analysis following nuclear microirradiation.
  Selective sub-nuclear exposure of UVC using micropore filters has been used to study
  the NER pathway. Focused laser microbeams (of various wavelengths, energies, etc.)
  or charged particles, delivered to sub-micron regions in the cell nucleus (with
  or without DNA sensitization), have been used mainly to study DSBs. However, other
  types of damage are also induced, including CPD, SSBs, and in some cases, base damage.
  In addition, photo-activation of psoralen derivatives by microirradiation induces
  interstrand crosslinking damage (ICLs).
