caption: Discovery of BIBF1120. H-bonds are outlined as blue hashed lines. The methyl-piperazinyl
  moiety is involved in the ionic interaction with the side chains of Glu850 (Black).
  Hydrophobic interaction is outlined by hashed brown rectangle. Solvent-exposed region
  is highlighted using green rectangle. Hinge region is indicated by pink arc.
