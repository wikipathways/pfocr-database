caption: Multiple messengers contribute to NMDAR-induced metaplasticity. Steps involving
  neurosteroids are recent additions. The question marks at these steps reflect uncertainty
  about whether activation of neurosteroid synthesis occurs subsequent to other steps
  in the pathway or reflects a parallel path to LTP inhibition. As described by ,
  other messengers such as PI3K, mTOR and S6 kinase are also likely to contribute
  to LTP inhibition. To the right of the main cascade, we list agents that inhibit
  the particular step and allow LTP induction. Key enzyme inhibitors include FK-506
  and cyclosporine for calcineurin, L-N-monomethylarginine (L-NMMA) and L-nitroarginine
  (L-NOArg) for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and SB203580 for p38 MAP kinase. Finasteride
  and dutasteride inhibit 5-alpha reductase a key enzyme in allopregnanolone synthesis
  and picrotoxin is a GABAAR antagonist. As noted in , interpretation of the effects
  of picrotoxin is complex because of effects on network excitability.
