caption: cAMP signaling pathway in Mtb. cAMP signaling in Mtb is complex, involving
  up to 16 ACs, 10 of which have been biochemically shown to produce cAMP shown here.
  Rv1264, Rv1647, Rv2212, Rv1319c and Rv1625c are activated by known signals, including
  pH, fatty acids, protein-protein interactions and small molecules. The other five
  enzymes with confirmed AC activity have not been associated with specific signals.
  Mtb produces high levels of cAMP upon macrophage infection, growth on propionate
  or exposure to heat stress; however, the specific signals and ACs responsible are
  not known. Mtb can control the level of cAMP available in the cytoplasm by regulation
  of synthesis, hydrolysis via the Rv0805 PDE, secretion outside of the cell and by
  Rv1636 binding. There are 10 proteins with cNT-binding domains (CNBs), only Rv3676
  (CRPMT), Rv1675c (Cmr) and Rv0998 (MtPat) have been characterized. CRPMT and Cmr
  are DNA-binding transcription factors (TF) that regulate mycobacterial gene expression,
  while MtPat is a lysine acetyl transferase that is activated by cAMP to inactivate
  downstream protein substrates.
