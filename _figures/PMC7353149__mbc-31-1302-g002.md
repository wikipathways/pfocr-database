caption: Nontethering function of ER–PM tethers is part of the Δtether snf7Δ SL pathway.
  (A) Growth assay testing artificial ER–PM tethers ability to rescue the Δtether
  snf7Δ SL phenotype. Tenfold serial dilutions of WT, Δtether, and Δtether snf7Δ strains
  expressing either an empty vector or an artificial ER–PM tether. Cells were grown
  overnight in SCD -leu selective media and spotted onto YPD and SCD -leu plates.
  (B) Growth assay testing for snf7Δ SL phenotypes in strains with a subset of ER–PM
  tethers deleted. Tenfold serial dilutions of Δtether snf7Δ were compared with scs2/22Δ
  snf7Δ and tcb1/2/3Δ snf7Δ, and spotted onto YPD and SCD plates. (C) Simplified lipid
  synthesis pathway. Nutrients in red boxes are absent in synthetic media. The CDP-DAG
  pathway is shaded in yellow, and the Kennedy pathway is shaded in green. (D) Growth
  curve testing the effect of choline supplementation on the Δtether snf7Δ SL growth
  phenotype. Culture density was detected every 20 min. Each point is the average
  of three biological replicates; error bars are the SD at each time point.
