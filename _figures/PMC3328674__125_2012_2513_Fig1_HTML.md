caption: Mechanisms of exercise-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Upon
  acute endurance-type exercise, muscular contraction increases AMP and AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK), calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II (CAMKII) as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). This
  will accelerate translocation of GLUT4 and thereby facilitate insulin-independent
  glucose transport. Post-exercise effects involve activation of peroxisome-proliferator
  activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α), which by stimulating expression of
  nuclear respiratory factors (NRF1, NRF2) will increase ATP synthesis and, later,
  mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, exercising improves insulin-dependent glucose
  transport and phosphorylation by hexokinase II (HKII), which includes more distal
  components of insulin signalling such as phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1),
  TBC1 domain family, members 1 and 4 (TBC1D1/4), Rac1 and protein kinase C (PKC)
  isoforms. The effects of training on mitochondrial function and glucose metabolism
  may be modulated by variants in genes such as PPARG or NDUFB6. While the cellular
  mechanisms of acute resistance-type exercise are less clear, chronic resistance
  training activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/serine kinase 6 (S6K)
  pathway, ultimately leading to protein synthesis and increased muscle mass. TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid
