caption: Regulation of lipid metabolism in cancer cells. In cancer cells, glucose
  uptake and glycolysis are markedly up-regulated by RTKs via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway, generating large amounts of pyruvate. Pyruvate is converted to lactate
  and it also enters the mitochondria, where it forms citrate, which is transported
  by SLC25A1 from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, where the citrate serves as
  a precursor for de novo synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. Glutamine can
  also enter into mitochondria and participate in energy production and lipid synthesis.
  Acetate is converted to acetyl-CoA by the ACSS2 enzyme, serving as another source
  of lipid synthesis. Glucose participates in the HBP to form glycans that will be
  added to proteins during glycosylation. Oncogenic EGFR signaling increases N-glycosylation
  of SCAP, which activates SREBP-1 and -2 [, ], which ultimately up-regulate expression
  of enzymes in lipogenesis pathways and expression of LDLR. The enzyme up-regulation
  promotes fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, while the LDLR up-regulation increases
  cholesterol uptake []. The microRNA miRNA-29 regulates the SCAP/SREBP pathway via
  a novel negative feedback loop []. The transporter CD36 brings fatty acids into
  cancer cells. When cellular fatty acids and cholesterol are in excess, they can
  be converted to TG and CE by the enzymes DGAT1/2 and SOAT1/ACAT1, forming LDs. When
  present in excess, cholesterol can be converted to 22- or 27-hydroxycholesterol,
  which activate LXR to up-regulate ABCA1 expression, promoting cholesterol efflux.
