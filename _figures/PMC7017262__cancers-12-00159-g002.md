caption: Schematic overview of molecular H. pylori signaling pathways that involve
  cortactin during infection of gastric epithelial cells. (A) The H. pylori T4SS pilus
  protein CagL activates c-Src tyrosine kinase through α5β1-integrin interaction [].
  Activated c-Src phosphorylates injected CagA, which in turn leads to the activation
  of Csk, a c-Src inhibitor [,]. Csk in complex with pragmin, a protein which potentiates
  kinase activity of Csk, inactivate c-Src that further results in tyrosine dephosphorylation
  of cortactin at Y-421 and Y-486 []. (B) The H. pylori protein CagA after injection
  into a host cell by the T4SS machinery activates tyrosine kinase c-Abl, which phosphorylates
  cortactin at Y-466 [,]. The downstream signaling leads to the recruitment of the
  Rho-family guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2 by phosphorylated cortactin,
  finally resulting in Rac1-mediated cell movement []. (C) Alternatively, CagA-activated
  Rac1 can lead to the activation of the serine-threonine kinase PAK, which phosphorylates
  cortactin at S-113 []. This leads to the dissociation of cortactin from the complex
  with F-actin and N-WASP. (D) During H. pylori infection, CagL dissociates ADAM17
  from the α5β1-integrin []. Released ADAM17 increases the production of heparin-binding
  epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), activating EGF receptor. Alternatively, H. pylori
  can activate hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) c-Met by a yet unknown factor,
  enhanced by interaction of CagA and signal transducing protein PLCγ []. The downstream
  signaling from either EGF or HGF receptors activates the Ras/ERK pathway, which
  leads to serine phosphorylation of cortactin at S-405 and S-418 []. Serine phosphorylated
  cortactin activates FAK, that results in increased cell adhesion []. In contrast,
  CagA-activated SHP2 phosphatase can downregulate activity of FAK due to SHP2-mediated
  dephosphorylation of FAK []. (E) Finally, high protein levels of cortactin were
  described to contribute to the apoptotic function of VacA in gastric epithelial
  cells in a yet unknown fashion []. Downstream signaling upregulates the pro-apoptotic
  protein Bax and downregulates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which results in
  apoptosis of target cells.
