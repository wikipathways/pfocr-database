caption: TNFα-related signal transduction pathway participating in the differentiation
  of skin appendages. Only EDA-A1, EDA1R and EDARADD are specific for the pathway.
  ED1 is expressed in interfollicular cells. Its transcription is controlled by the
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway and requires LEF-1. The membrane-bound protein product of
  ED1 is cleaved by furin-like proteases to obtain soluble ligands. EDA-A1 binds to
  EDAR which recruits EDARADD. Both are expressed in follicular cells. EDA-A2 binds
  to XEDAR, which does not require a protein adaptor to react with TRAF proteins.
  The remaining components are used by other signaling pathways that converge on NFκB.
  NFκB stimulates transcription of target genes, and their protein product interacts
  with several signaling pathways including Shh and BMP. Mutations of ED1 cause X-linked
  HED, mutations of EDA1R or of EDARADD cause autosomal (either dominant or recessive)
  forms of HED. Mutations in NEMO cause X-linked HED associated with immunodeficiency,
  osteopetrosis, and lymphedema. For details see text
