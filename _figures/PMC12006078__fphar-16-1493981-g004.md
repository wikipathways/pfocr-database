caption: The mechanisms of action by which acacetin prevents cardiac fibrosis and
  hypertrophy. (A) Pathological stimuli such as MI, Ang II, or hypertension can induce
  MF by increasing the expression of fibrosis-related genes via activation of the
  TGF-β1/Smad3, Akt/mTOR, or MAPK signaling pathways. However, acacetin can alleviate
  MF by inhibiting the activation of these signaling pathways. (B) Acacetin can significantly
  counter MI- or Ang II-induced ROS production, cell apoptosis, and inflammatory responses
  by regulating the Sirt1/AMPK/PGC-1α, PPAR-α, Nrf2, NF-κB, or PI3K/Akt pathways,
  thus exerting its inhibitory effect against cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. (By Figdraw)
