caption: Schematic diagram of IL-1 and TNF signal transduction events. (A) IL-1 binding
  to IL-1RI results in recruitment of the IL-1 receptor accessory protein IL-1RAcP,
  which form a complex that, via the intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains
  of the two receptor molecules, engages the MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor
  88) adaptor protein (; ; ). MyD88 binding initiates phosphorylation of IRAK-4 (interleukin-1
  receptor-associated kinase 4), IRAK-2 and IRAK-1. IRAK-1 recruits TRAF6 and these
  two proteins localise to the cell membrane where they associate with TAK1 (TGF-β-activated
  kinase 1), TAB1 (TAK1-binding protein) and TAB2. The TAK1/TAB1/TAP2/TRAF6 complex
  translocates to the cytosol where TRAF-6 is poly-ubiquitinated and TAK1 is subsequently
  phosphorylated, and activates NF-κB, p38 MAPK and JNK. The MyD88 adaptor molecule
  and downstream signalling events are common to most Toll-like receptors (TLRs),
  and, via TRAF6, this pathway also converges with RANKL signalling. (B) Engagement
  of the homotrimeric TNF-R1 receptor by TNF enables recruitment of TRADD (TNF-R1
  associated death domain protein) via homotypic death domain interactions. TRADD
  associates with itself, TRAF2 and RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein 1) and with
  TRAF5. TNF-R2 is able to directly associate with TRAF2, independently of TRADD.
  TRAF2 auto-poly-ubiquitinates and ubiquitinates RIP1. Poly-ubiquitination of RIP1
  then leads to the recruitment of TAK1, through interactions with TAB1, TAB2 and
  TAB3, again leading to NF-κB, p38 MAPK and JNK activation (; ).
