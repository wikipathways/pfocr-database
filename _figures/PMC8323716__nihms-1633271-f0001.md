caption: EZH2 transcription is activated by transcription factors like E2F or ELK1.
  On the post-transcriptional level miR-101 and miR-26a have been shown to decrease
  EZH2 and therefore their down regulation also leads to EZH2 overexpression. Activity
  of EZH2 is regulated by AKT-mediated phosphorylation. C-myc leads to PTEN upregulation
  inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway resulting a decreased inhibition of EZH2.
  Increased activity of EZH2 then leads to upregulated H3K27 methylation resulting
  in repression of tumor suppressor genes. This catalytic function is antagonized
  by NOTCH1. Non-catalytic or PRC2-independent roles for EZH2 include enhancing STAT3
  activity, interaction with transcription factors, or stabilization of DDB promoting
  nucleotide excision repair.
