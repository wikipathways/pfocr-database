caption: Proposed pathways upregulated in the S. mutans+S. gordonii mixed cultures.
  Genes in bold type are upregulated in the mixed culture; genes in plain type exist
  in the S. mutans genome, but were not upregulated in the microarray. The pathways
  are proposed based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
  database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html#energy).
