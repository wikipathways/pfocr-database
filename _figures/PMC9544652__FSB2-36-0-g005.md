caption: A diagram illustrating the mechanism by which upregulation of LOX promotes
  renal fibrosis. Injury to kidneys led to activation of β‐arrestin/ERK biased signaling
  pathway and the downstream transcription factor STAT3 nuclear sublocation, which
  can bind to the promoter of LOX and increase its transcription, resulting in collagen
  over cross‐linking. Targeting LOX with its inhibitor BAPN significantly suppressed
  IRI‐induced collagen over cross‐linking by decreasing LOX expression and activity,
  resulting in a decrease in renal fibrosis.
