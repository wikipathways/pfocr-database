caption: HCV infection inhibits C4 and C3 components expression ,  as well as C2 production
  (current study). Reduction of C4 and C2 synthesis by HCV affects C3 convertase formation
  in classical pathway, which results in the inhibition of C3 cleavage. Limited C3b
  generation affect C3b deposition onto pathogenic surface, and impairs another C3
  convertase formation of alternative pathway and C5 convertase formation in both
  pathways. Together with the reduction of membrane attack complex formation , the
  impairment of C3 convertase activity may be a key event for HCV persistence. CP = classical
  pathway, AP = alternate pathway.
