caption: 'A schematic describing the altered response of R and T cells to tunicamycin-induced
  ER stress: In the absence of tunicamycin, all three ER stress receptors (PERK, IRE1,
  and ATF-6) are blocked by GRP78/BiP and therefore do not undergo downstream processes.
  In the presence of tunicamycin, when N-glycosylation of newly synthetized proteins
  is blocked, nonglycosylated/unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER and GRP78/BiP
  begins to interact with them. In S cells with lower GRP78/BiP levels, the amount
  of GRP78/BiP is insufficient to simultaneously bind unfolded proteins and to block
  all three ER receptors. Therefore, GRP78/BiP releases from PERK, IRE1, and ATF-6,
  and these receptors are activated and induce the following stress response pathways:
  i. PERK dimerizes, autophosphorylates, and subsequently inactivates eIF2α via specific
  phosphorylation. This leads to inhibition of eIF2 (alpha, beta, and gamma) heterotrimer
  formation. This results in a rapid decrease in translation or suppression of global
  protein synthesis. Due to this action, the arrest of S cells in the G1 phase of
  the cell cycle occurs. If this stress persists during repeated passages in the presence
  of tunicamycin, initiation of the PERK-ATF4 pathway induces CHOP expression; ii.
  IRE1 is homooligomerized, autophosphorylated, and exhibits RNA splicing activity
  that results in specific splicing of XBP1 mRNA and translation of the spliced variant
  of this protein. The truncated XBP1 variant is a functional transcription factor
  that initiates the expression of ER chaperones and endoplasmic reticulum-associated
  degradation (ERAD) genes. This allows cells to recover from ER stress. During this
  period, cell arrest occurs in the G1 phase; iii. after GRP78/BiP release, ATF6 is
  specifically cleaved and a 50-kDa fragment translocates into the nucleus, where
  it induces transcription of ER chaperones (e.g., GRP78/BiP), protein degradation
  enzymes, and XBP1. If the effect of sublethal concentrations of tunicamycin does
  not last long (during the first and second passages), the cells are able to grow
  normally in subsequent passages in the absence of tunicamycin. However, if this
  stress-induced condition persists, S cells do not proliferate, and after the third
  passage in the presence of tunicamycin, only a few viable cells were detected. R
  and T cells contain more GRP78/BiP, which is able to interact with larger amounts
  of unfolded proteins without release from the ER stress receptors. Under these circumstances,
  there is no activation of these receptors upon incubation with tunicamycin, as there
  is in S cells. Therefore, R and T cells are not retained in the G1 phase of the
  cell cycle under the influence of tunicamycin. Increasing GRP78/BiP in S cells by
  transfection with the gene encoding this protein prevented arrest in G1 cell cycle
  phase in transfected S cells after incubation with tunicamycin.'
