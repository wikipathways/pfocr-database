caption: Overview of serotonergic pathway modulated by gut commensal microbiota components.
  Gut 5-HT is biosynthesized with L-tryptophan (Trp) derived from dietary contents
  in enterochromaffin (EC) cells, in which tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) converts
  Trp into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a direct precursor of 5-HT. Activation of
  EC cells and TPH1 is dependent on resident microbiota and their metabolites. Released
  5-HT binds to various 5-HT receptors (5-HTRs) on immune cells, such as mast cells
  and macrophages, which potentially induces mucosal inflammation in the gut. Enteric
  5-HT can modulate GI motility by stimulating the enteric nervous system (ENS), while
  it also acts to induce pain by activating afferent fibers as well as inducing mucosal
  inflammation, mainly through 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors. Released 5-HT is taken up
  by serotonin reuptake transport (SERT) and degraded by monoamine oxidase (MAO) into
  5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) in the cells to optimize the luminal 5-HT level.
  5-HT can also influence bacterial composition by quorum sensing (QS).
