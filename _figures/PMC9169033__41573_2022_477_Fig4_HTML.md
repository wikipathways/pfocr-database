caption: a | A variety of metabolic changes indicated by the different levels of metabolites
  in multiple sclerosis (MS) are known to occur. It is assumed that the MS brain metabolism
  has increased glycolysis and therefore a reduction of the flux through the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Furthermore, other pathways
  such as the urea cycle, the kynurenine pathway and glutamine metabolism are also
  affected in MS. Red upwards and downwards arrows indicate changes in the metabolite
  level or metabolic pathways (grey circular arrows, changes in red) in MS. b | T
  cell subtypes show different metabolic properties. In MS, T cells seem to increase
  their metabolic fluxes (indicated by red upwards and downwards arrows); however,
  after differentiation, they display a different metabolic profile. T memory (Tmem)
  cells rely on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and OXPHOS, whereas T helper 17 (TH17)
  cells display increased fatty acid synthesis (FAS), glycolysis and glutaminolysis.
  c | Metabolic active pathways of neurons (yellow) and astrocytes (blue). Neurons
  rely on the astrocyte–neuron lactate shuttle for their energy supply. Astrocytes
  take up glucose and metabolize it to pyruvate using glycolysis, and, finally, lactate
  is generated through lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Lactate can exit the cell and
  the extracellular lactate can be shuttled into neurons to either fuel neuronal ATP
  synthesis or to generate reducing agents such as NADPH to maintain redox homeostasis.
  In MS, this mechanism seems to be diminished (indicated by red upwards and downwards
  arrows). ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine; BCAA, branched-chain amino acid; GLS,
  glutamine synthetase; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthetase; KA, kynurenic acid;
  NO, nitric oxide; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; QA, quinolinic acid.
