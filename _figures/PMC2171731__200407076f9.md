caption: Model for invadopodium formation. (A) A model for invadopodium formation.
  Mature invadopodia are formed through three processes. (1) In the initiation phase,
  precursors of invadopodia are formed de novo at the cell periphery around lamellipodia.
  (2) These precursors are motile and move around on the ventral membrane until they
  stick to ECM. (3) In the maturation phase, anchored invadopodia protrude into ECM
  and degrade it. (B) Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway for invadopodium
  formation. EGF ligand binding to the EGF receptor activates and/or recruits Nck1
  and Cdc42. Nck1 recruits WIP–N-WASP complex, and Cdc42 activates N-WASP probably
  through Toca-1 to initiate invadopodium formation. Cofilin mainly functions in the
  maturation process of invadopodium formation.
