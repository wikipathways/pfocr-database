  blocking of the G9a binding pocket, (b) G9a and GLP-affected pathways: H3K9 di-methylation
  inhibits caspase 1 expression; G9a demethylates p53, inhibits its activity, and
  enhances the expression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which is implicated in cell
  proliferation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Red arrows—up arrow is
  an indicative of upregulation, down arrow is an indicative of downregulation, and
