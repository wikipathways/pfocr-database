caption: The primary generation of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species in
  skeletal muscleThe main pathway of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in
  extracellular and intracellular space is exhibited. Extracellular reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), including O2·- and H2O2, are produced by xanthine oxidase (XO), NADPH
  oxidase 2/4 (NOX2/4), and superoxide dismutase 2/3 (SOD2/3). Intracellular RONS
  consisting of O2·-, H2O2, ·OH, ROO·, ·NO, ONOO− are generated in the different pathways,
  such as ETC, NOX2/4, SOD2/3, lipoxygenase (LOX), NOS, as well as their secondary
  metabolic reactions.
