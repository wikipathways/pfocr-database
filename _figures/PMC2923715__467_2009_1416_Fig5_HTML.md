caption: Wnt signaling pathways. The canonical pathway is mediated through the cystoplasmic
  protein disheveled (Dvl) and ultimately effected through β-catenin-mediated transcription.
  The non-canonical pathway is mediated through membrane-bound Dvl and ultimately
  controls planar cell polarity. Inversin, the NPHP2 gene product, in concert with
  the NPHP3 protein, appears to facilitate development by controlling the Wnt pathway
  signaling. RhoA Ras homolog gene family, member A
