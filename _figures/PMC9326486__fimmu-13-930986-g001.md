caption: Schematic overview of non-canonical signaling pathway and NIK regulatory
  mechanisms. In resting cells, NIK forms a complex with TRAF2/3 and cIAP1/2, which
  leads to the continuous ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NIK. Upon
  ligand binding, TRAF3 is recruited to the receptor, where TRAF2 induces ubiquitination
  of cIAP1/2 which in turn induces ubiquitination of TRAF3. As a result, TRAF3 is
  degraded and NIK is stabilized. After NIK stabilization, NIK is able to phosphorylate
  the IKKα complex to induce activation. After direct phosphorylation of the precursor
  p100 by both NIK and the IKKα complex, p100 will undergo proteasomal processing
  into the active subunit p52, which together with RelB may translocate to the nucleus
  to activate target genes.
