caption: LBP/CD14-independent activation of host cells by E·albumin. Maximum potency
  of TLR4 activation occurs through the LBP/CD14-dependent pathway (on left) when
  LBP alters the dense packing of endotoxin within Eagg and catalyzes the extraction
  of an endotoxin monomer by mCD14 or sCD14, which then transfers those monomers to
  MD-2(·TLR4). Alternatively, LBP/CD14-independent activation of host cells by endotoxin
  (on right) can occur following destabilization of endotoxin aggregates by limiting
  or chelating divalent cations or perhaps by the action of host defense proteins
  such as the complement membrane attack complex or host cationic antimicrobial peptides.
  This leads to the extraction and binding of endotoxin by albumin. Albumin can serve
  as a CD14-surrogate by transferring endotoxin monomers to MD·2(·TLR4), resulting
  in activation of TLR4. Since activation of TLR4 by E·albumin occurs in the absence
  of CD14, it is possible that the resulting intracellular signaling would proceed
  predominantly through the MyD88-dependent pathway.
