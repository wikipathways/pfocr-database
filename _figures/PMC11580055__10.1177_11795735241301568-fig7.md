caption: The mechanism of EE improving secondary brain injury after TBI through the
  TLR2/NF-κB/MMP9 pathway. EE treatment reduced TLR2 overexpression after TBI and
  inhibited the activation of the NF-κB/MMP9 pathway, reduced the release of inflammatory
  factors and albumin leakage, and improves secondary brain injury after TBI
