caption: Model of the DNA-damage checkpoint pathway. In response to DNA damage, Chk1
  becomes phosphorylated in a manner that is dependent on the activity of Rad3 and
  other checkpoint Rad proteins. The association of Chk1 with 14-3-3 proteins is stimulated
  by phosphorylation of Chk1. Phosphorylated Chk1 communicates with target proteins
  to propagate the signal for arrest. Wee1 and Cdc25 have been suggested as potential
  in vivo targets of Chk1; however, it is likely that other targets exist as well
  (see text for discussion).
