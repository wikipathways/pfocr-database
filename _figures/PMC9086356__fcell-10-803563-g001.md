caption: 'Developmental Process of the ILC Family. All members of the ILC family derive
  from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). The developmental pathways are mostly
  split into three lineages: NK lineage, ILC lineage, and LTi lineage. The NK pathway
  (in blue) is the first to derail from the main pathways (in green). The downstream
  progenitor is an Id2+ NFIL3+ TOX + LTi and ILC precursor and Id2+ NFIL3+ TOX + PLZF
  + precursor restricted to ILCs (in pink). The LTi restricted precursor (in grey)
  is an intermediate cell stage that is, Id2+ RORγt + CCR6+. Further down from the
  restricted ILC-only precursor, T-bet, GATA3, and RORγt AHR are needed for ILC1,
  ILC2, and all types of ILC3 development respectively.'
