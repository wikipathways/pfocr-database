caption: RANK/RANKL pathway in mammary gland physiology and breast cancer. (A) RANK
  is constitutively expressed on the membrane of luminal and basal epithelial cells
  including mammary stem cells (MaSCs). Stimulation with progesterone induces RANKL
  expression and secretion in progesterone receptor (PR)-positive luminal epithelial
  cells. RANKL binds in an autocrine fashion to RANK on luminal epithelial cells,
  which stimulates further RANKL expression, and in a paracrine fashion to RANK on
  basal epithelial cells, resulting in enhanced RANK expression on basal mammary epithelial
  cells and the activation of the IKKα-NFκB–cyclin D1 signaling axis to induce a variety
  of physiological responses necessary for mammary gland development. (B) Heterozygous
  BRCA1 mutation-carrying women can spontaneously lose the remaining wild-type BRCA1
  gene from somatic mutation or epigenetic silencing. Subsequently, loss of BRCA1
  protein can result in increased genomic instability, DNA damage, and genetic mutations
  (e.g., TP53). Progesterone, as well as synthetic progestins, up-regulate RANKL expression
  in PR+ luminal breast epithelial cells which stimulates RANK-mediated cell proliferation
  of adjacent progenitor cells as discussed in (A). Altogether, the genotoxic stress
  and amplified proliferation cues culminate in uncontrolled proliferation and the
  development of breast cancer.
