caption: DJ-1’s mechanisms involved in Nrf2 pathway regulation. A) Schematic representation
  of the proteins and chemical substances, their connections, and the outcomes. (1)
  DJ-1 stabilizes Nrf2 by favoring Nrf2 free form, possibly by promoting the dissociation
  from its inhibitor, the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein1 (Keap1) [,]. (2) DJ-1
  is also able to modulate Nrf2 signaling, activating it in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner
  [, , , ]. As a result of the DJ-1-mediated activation of the pathway, nuclear Nrf2
  triggers the expression of specific enzymes involved in antioxidant responses, such
  as (3) NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) [,,, , , ], (4) heme oxygenase-1
  (HO-1) [,,, , , , ,], (5) Glutathione S-transferase (GST) [,] (6) Isocitrate dehydrogenase
  (IDH) [] and (7) Trx1 []. (8) The DJ-1 based peptide ND-13 is a DJ-1 and TAT-based
  peptide with therapeutic potential, promoting DJ-1-dependent activation of Nrf2
  antioxidant mechanism []. (9) Several chemical substances (11-Dehydrosinulariolide
  [], Compound B [], Bibenzyl compound 20C [], Rosmarinic acid [], Cu(II)ATSM [],
  Morinda citrifolia’s Active Principle Scopoletin [], Tauroursodeoxycholic acid []
  and Salidroside []) have also been described with a promising effect in enhancing
  DJ-1-mediated Nrf2 signaling activation. (10) Furthermore, DJ-1 is involved in a
  loop regulatory mechanism of the 20S proteasome that provides a balance in protein
  degradation processes. DJ-1 may bind to 20S proteasome, inhibiting its action together
  with NQO1 enzyme. Contrarily, the DJ-1-mediated Nrf2 activation also leads to 20S
  proteasome enhancement []. B) The influence of DJ-1 mutations and the importance
  of DJ-1 cysteine residues in the protein’s signaling regulation mechanisms.
