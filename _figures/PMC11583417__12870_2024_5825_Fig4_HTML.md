caption: 'Expression patterns of key genes and metabolites related to the phenylpropanoid
  pathway in Dendrocalamus farinosus shoots under OFBa. Blue and red squares represent
  down and upregulated DEGs, and green and red circles represent down and upregulated
  differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs), respectively. Solid and dashed arrows
  represent direct and indirect effects, respectively. Metabolic pathway adapted from
  Mapman (3.6.0RC1) and amendments involved displaying the newly identified genes
  and metabolites under this study and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) portal used for analysis. OFBa: bio-organic fertilizer (containing Bacillus
  amyloliquefaciens)'
