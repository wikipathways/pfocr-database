caption: Upon binding of one of the three TGFβ ligands (TGFβ1, TGFβ2, TGFβ3) to the
  type II TβRII receptor expressed on the cell surface of the HSC or LSC, TβRII multimerizes
  with a nearby type I TβRI receptor. Multimerization subsequently phosphorylates
  and activates the TβRI receptor. In the canonical TGFβ signaling pathway, one of
  the receptor-mediated SMAD transcription factors (R-SMAD 1, 2, 3, 5, 8) binds to
  the activated TβRI receptor via an adaptor molecule, thereby phosphorylating the
  R-SMAD. The activated R-SMAD dissociates with the TβRI receptor and binds to SMAD
  4 in the cytosol. The heterodimeric R-SMAD/SMAD 4 complex is now able to translocate
  into the nucleus to turn on the transcription of TGFβ target genes such as p57Kip2.
  Canonical SMAD-dependent signaling can be inhibited by the inhibitory SMADs (Smad
  6 and7), which function by either (1) dephosphorylating or recruiting the proteasomal
  E3 ligases to the TβRI receptor, or (2) competitively binding to SMAD 4. SMAD-independent
  signaling has also been characterized, as the activated TβRI receptor can activate
  the MAPK pathway and subsequent ERK, JNK, and/or p38 signaling pathways.
