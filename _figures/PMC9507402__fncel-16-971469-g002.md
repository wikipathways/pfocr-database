caption: Overview of signaling pathways that mediate pyroptosis. Recognition of pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or double-stranded
  DNA (dsDNA) by their respective inflammasome-sensors NLRP1/3/6, NLRC4, AIM2, and
  Pyrin leads to the assembly of a multi-protein complex termed the inflammasome.
  Consequently, caspase-1 undergoes autoproteolytic processing to lock the protease
  in its active form. Caspase-1 directly cleaves its substrates gasdermin D and the
  pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. The N-terminal cleavage fragment
  of Gsdmd forms pores in the host cell membrane thereby mediating the release of
  cytoplasmic content, the mature IL-1β and IL-18 and the other DAMPs IL-1α, HMGB1
  and ATP. Cytosolic LPS activates caspase-4/5 and caspase-11, triggering pyroptosis
  by cleaving GSDMD. The activated caspase-11 also cleaves Pannexin-1, inducing ATP
  release and P2 × 7R-related pyroptotic cell death. Pathogenic Yersinia can inhibit
  TAK1 function by effector YopJ, and then induces the activation of caspase-8, which
  cleaves GSDMD, resulting in pyroptosis. In addition, under hypoxia conditions, PD-L1
  is transferred to the nucleus and regulates the transcription of GSDMC together
  with p-Stat3, resulting in the conversion of apoptosis to pyroptosis after TNFα-activated
  caspase-8. Chemotherapy drugs can activate caspase-3 to cleave GSDME and induce
  pyroptosis. In the granzyme-mediated pathway, CAR T cells rapidly activate caspase-3
  in target cells by releasing GzmB, and then GSDME was activated, causing extensive
  pyroptosis. In addition, GzmA and GzmB in cytotoxic lymphocytes enter target cells
  through perforin and induce pyroptosis. GzmA hydrolyzes GSDMB, and GzmB directly
  activates GSDME. The administration of NP-GSDMA3 and Phe-BF3 induces GSMDA3-mediated
  pyroptosis. GSDMA acts as both a sensor and substrate of GAS SpeB and as an effector
  to trigger pyroptosis.
