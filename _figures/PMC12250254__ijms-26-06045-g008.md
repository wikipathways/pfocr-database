caption: Mechanistic pathways of p73-mediated ferroptosis involving SLC7A11 and betaine. p73
  suppresses the transcriptional expression of SLC7A11 and reduces intracellular levels
  of betaine, a metabolite known to inhibit ROS accumulation. Arrowheads represent
  activation; blunt ends represent inhibition
