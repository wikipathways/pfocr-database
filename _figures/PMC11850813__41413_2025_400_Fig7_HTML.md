caption: Schematic representation of the molecular mechanism underlying knee arthrofibrosis.
  Human synovial tissues from patients with knee arthrofibrosis (AF) and negative
  controls (NC) were obtained. First, with the FCM and single-cell transcriptomic
  analysis, we identified fibroblasts, macrophages, FLS, endothelial cells, VSMC,
  and T cells as main components of synovial tissues. The fibroblast-macrophage interactions
  were investigated, and CCN2 in the TGF-β pathway was identified as a potential biomarker
  for knee AF. Second, in vitro experimentations revealed that autocrine of CCN2 is
  essential in the pro-fibrotic functions (activation, proliferation, and migration)
  of fibroblasts through TGFBR/SMAD pathway. Then, we verified CCN2 expression in
  clinical patients and discovered that TGF-β induced CCN2 is positively related to
  AF. Schematic molecular mechanism underlying the knee arthrofibrosis is shown at
  the bottom. Macrophages initiate the fibrotic casade by activating multiple pro-fibrotic
  pathways, including TGF-β signaling pathways and others (the ncWnt, tenascin, and
  FGF signaling pathways). The fibroblasts, as receivers, affect macrophages via the
  CXCL signaling pathway. Additionally, autocrine of CCN2 by fibroblasts promoted
  fibrosis through TGFBR/SMAD pathway, thus leading to the knee arthrofibrosis
