caption: Summary of the liquid biopsies activating chemoattraction signal pathways
  for recruiting immune cells in NASH/NAFLD. palmitate and lysophosphatidylcholine
  (LPC)-induced hepatic lipotoxicity is triggered by CXCL10 with hepatocyte-derived
  CYP2E1 vesicles enrichment; Palmitate-stimulated EVs are enriched in ceramide (C16:0)-derived
  sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) to chemoattract macrophages. Increased numbers of
  EVs derived from invariant natural killer T cells and CD14+ monocytes are associated
  with alanine transaminase (ALT) level in serum. Mlk3−/− mice fed a diet that was
  high in fats and carbohydrates exhibited suppressed cytokine expression and macrophage
  infiltration compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Lipid-induced TNFRSF10B signaling
  causes release of inflammatory extracellular vesicles from hepatocytes. High levels
  of hepatocyte mtDNA in the microparticles (MPs) activated toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)
  pathway for chemotaxis of neutrophils and M1 macrophages.
