caption: SARS-CoV-2 inhibition of IFN induction and signaling.Key components of IFN
  induction and signaling are shown with solid arrows denoting signaling pathway.
  SARS-CoV-2 proteins (red) that are repotyed to inhibit different steps in the pathway.
  Direct interacting partners of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are shown as overlapping. SARS-CoV-2
  proteins that inhibit phosphorylation steps are shown with flat head arrows toward
  phosphorylation symbols (yellow circles). Proteins that inhibit translocation events
  are shown with flat arrows towards translocation path. Created with BioRender.com.
