caption: 'Mechanism of resistance to arsenic trioxide- all-trans retinoic acid (ATO-ATRA)
  therapy in APL. The resistance to ATRA and ATO may derive from: (i) genetic mutations
  resulting in amino acid substitution in the RARa ligand binding domain (LBD) and
  in the PML-B2 domain of PML-RARa (ii) deregulated pathways like AKT/mTOR, activators
  of MAP kinase pathway and/or other epigenetic controllers or additional gene mutations
  (ei WT1), (iii) FLT3-ITD severely blunts ATRA response, which fails to degrade PML-RARA
  protein whose persistence in the cells confers the APL phenotype with PML nuclear
  body disruption and deactivation of P53 signaling. This type of resistance is overcome
  by ATO (iv) some autophagy regulatory proteins BECN1 and p62/SQSTM1 have been shown
  to play a pro-survival role during ATRA and ATO treatment, (v) alterations in the
  redox system. (vi) Metabolic alterations (vii) High expression of multi drug resistant
  (MDR) proteins, (viii) Microenvironment influences (ix) Presence of X-RARa fusions.'
