caption: The molecular mechanism of inducing cognitive impairment in OSA patients
  through intermittent hypoxia (IH). IH increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
  and the nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes,
  triggering the inflammatory response and releasing inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β,
  IL-6, TNF-α) by activating the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
  ROS overproduction induces apoptosis by causing mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress. Additionally, ROS overproduction induces the production of
  hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF 1α) and beta-secretase 1 (BACE1). HIF-1α downregulates
  the N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and BACE1, generating amyloid β (Aβ).
  Finally, the inflammatory cytokines aggravate neuronal axons, leading to synaptic
  damage. Blocking arrow indicated the molecular target by current therapeutic drugs.
