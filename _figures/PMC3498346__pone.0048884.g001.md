caption: After skeletal muscle damage occurs, cytokines and growth factors are released
  from the injured blood vessels and from infiltrating inflammatory cells. As a result
  of these coordinated events, satellite cells undergo extensive proliferation upon
  activation. Activated satellite cells (also called MCPs or myoblasts) will differentiate
  into myotubes and fuse together with either damaged myofibers or form new myofibers,
  while some will undergo self-renewal to restore the satellite cell pool. If inflammatory
  cell infiltration and fibroblast activation persist, the aberrant tissue repair
  response will produce a non-functional mass of fibrotic tissue. Myogenic regulatory
  pathways and factors are indicated. In hibernating squirrels, activation of Wnt
  signaling pathway (Wnt) does not favor fibrosis formation as has been shown in other
  mammals (in red).
