caption: (i) BLM induces pulmonary cell injury. (ii) Danger/stress signals generated
  by dying cells are sensed by the inflammasome rather than TLRs in antigen-presenting
  cells (alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and/or epithelial cells). (iii) Danger
  signals induce membrane signals, leading probably to the activation of a NALP protein
  and to the recruitment and activation of the adaptor ASC and caspase-1, known to
  interact via PYR-PYR and CARD-CARD homotypic interactions. (iv) Inflammasome activation
  results in the processing and maturation of pro-IL-1β into its biologically active
  form IL-1, and to IL-1β secretion. The production of pro-IL-1β seems independent
  of TLRs and could be attributed to sensing by other NACHT-LRRs. (v) IL-1β then activates
  the IL-1R1 complex in tissue-resident cells (probably pulmonary epithelial cells),
  leading to the recruitment of MyD88 via TIR-TIR homotypic interactions. Triggering
  of the IL-1R1/MyD88 pathway results in the activation of transcription factors such
  as NF-κB, which will turn on the transcription of neutrophil-attracting chemokines
  such as KC, lymphocyte-attracting chemokines such as TARC, and the transcription
  of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, resulting in lung inflammation (vi). IL-1R1/MyD88-dependent
  IL-1β production by tissue-resident cells may contribute to an autocrine/paracrine
  amplification loop. IL-1R1 blockade with IL-1Ra (anakinra) attenuates lung inflammation
  induced by BLM. IL-1β will also activate the IL-1R1/MyD88 pathway in fibroblasts,
  leading to metalloproteinase/TIMP-1 imbalance in favor of TIMP-1 and to fibroblast
  proliferation, resulting in collagen deposition and pulmonary fibrosis (vii).
