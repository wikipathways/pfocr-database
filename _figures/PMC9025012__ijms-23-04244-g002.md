caption: Sphingolipid pathway. The de novo sphingolipid metabolic pathway commences
  by the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine, which
  ultimately is converted to ceramides by the action of KDSR, CerS and DES, respectively.
  Ceramides can also be synthesized from sphingomyelin by SMS, from glucosylceramide
  by GluCs and from galactosylceramide by GalCS. Ceramides can be phosphorylated to
  ceramide-1-phosphate by CERK and SMPDL3b can dephosphorylate ceramide-1-phosphate
  to ceramide. Ceramides can be deacylated to sphingosine by Cdases and sphingosine
  can be phosphorylated to form sphingosine-1-phosphate by SPHK. Sphingosine-1-phosphate
  can finally be broken down to hexadecanol and ethanolamine. SPT, serine palmitoyl
