caption: Aox-mediated respiration. Black arrows indicate movement of electrons. The
  canonical cytochrome c pathway includes the classical protein complexes, depicted
  in green, with protons pumped into the intermembrane space by complexes I, III and
  IV. This pathway is coupled to ATP synthesis by contributing to the proton gradient
  in the intermembrane space that will drive ATP synthesis via ATP synthase (complex
  V, in yellow). Inhibition of complex III by drugs like anti-mycin A (AMA) halts
  movement of electrons via the classical route. Aox (in orange) functions as complex
  IV, reducing oxygen into water, thus providing an additional route to finalize electron
  flow. However, Aox does not function as a proton pump, effectively diminishing the
  proton gradient and, consequently, reducing ATP synthesis. Aox may be targeted for
  inhibition by chemicals like salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM).
