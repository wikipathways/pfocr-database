caption: 'Thyroid hormone and glucocorticoids contribute to the differential metabolism
  of fetal and adult cardiomyocytes. The predominant ATP generation pathways in the
  fetal (orange arrows) and adult (blue arrows) cardiomyocytes are shown. The fetal
  heart primarily relies on glycolysis, with some glucose and lactate oxidation. The
  adult heart chiefly oxidizes fatty acids but is metabolically flexible. Thyroid
  hormone in the form of T3 activates TRs α and β directly or downstream of conversion
  from T4. Upon activation by T3, TRs trigger the expression of several mitochondrial
  biogenesis, beta-oxidation and electron transport chain related genes. TRβ also
  promotes oxidative consumption of triglycerides without T3. Glucocorticoid receptor
  (GR) has similarly been linked to pro-OXPHOS and beta-oxidation pathways in adult
  CMs and is essential for adult heart function. ATP generated in the mitochondria
  travels by simple diffusion during development, but creatine kinase (CK) shuttling
  and direct adenine nucleotide channeling (DANC) ensure rapid transferral in the
  adult cardiomyocyte to sites of consumption. Abbreviations: ANT, adenine nucleotide
  translocator; Cr, creatine; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  β-OX, beta-oxidation; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway;
  PCr, phosphocreatine; TCAC, tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
