caption: Accelerated lipolysis generates acetyl CoA from fatty acids due to impaired
  pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) via pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and possibly directly by ammonia. Cataplerosis of α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG) by to form glutamate is a metabolic disposal pathway activated in the muscle
  during hyperammonemia. Lower αKG results in stabilization of HIF1α, decreased mTORC1
  activation and decreased tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux and lower ATP synthesis.
  These perturbations contribute to lower protein synthesis. Homeostatic responses
  include the utilization of branched chain amino acids to provide anaplerosis for
  generate αKG (isoleucine, valine) and acetyl CoA (leucine, isoleucine) with increased
  transport of branched chain amino acids from circulation for metabolic disposal.
  Ammonia via a p65NFkB mediated mechanism also activates myostatin that in turn inhibits
  mTORC1. These metabolic and molecular perturbations contribute to decreased sensitivity
  to anabolic stimuli (anabolic resistance) that can be potentially reversed by intervention
  at targeted sites. 1. Long term ammonia lowering strategies. 2. Myostatin blocking
  agent including antagomirs. 3. L-leucine provides acetyl-CoA, activates mTORC1 and
  protein synthesis. 4. Glucogenic amino acids can be a source of anaplerotic input
  to provide succinyl CoA replacing the loss of (cataplerosis) of αKG that is converted
  to glutamate during hyperammonemia (since skeletal muscle cannot generate urea).
  5. Cell permeable esters of αKG are a potential strategy to reverse cataplerosis
  and a novel method to increase muscle ammonia disposal. 6. Physical activity stimulates
  mTORC1 via phosphatidic acid.
