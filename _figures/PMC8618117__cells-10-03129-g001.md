caption: STK11/LBK1 promotes cell survival under stress conditions by allowing a switch
  from an anabolic to a catabolic metabolism. Under energy deprivation, the accumulation
  of AMP and the decreased levels of ATP lead to activation of LKB1 which phosphorylate
  AMPK at Thr-172 in an ⍺ subunit resulting in its activation. AMPK is involved in
  multiple metabolic pathways to increase ATP production and to stop ATP consumption
  switching metabolism from an anabolic state to a catabolic state. This pathway promotes
  cell survival under stress conditions but impairs cell growth and proliferation.
