caption: Pathway map of the Prtostaglandin E2 receptor signaling. Many of the genes
  identified as significantly different in our dataset are involved in this pathway.
  These differentially expressed factors from experimental data are depicted as white
  columns with red bars, the height of the red bar is proportionate to the fold change
  as a result of TiO2 exposure in pregnant (left) vs normal (right) mice.
