caption: Exosome-mediated DOX resistance in BC. DOX induces toxicity in cancer cells
  by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DBS), and inhibiting
  topoisomerase II-induced cell death by inducing ROS generation. Cancer cells develop
  resistance against DOX by increasing drug efflux through overexpressing ABC transporters
  and overexpressing miR181b-5p, miR582-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-222, miR 155, and miR
  34a-5p, which promote apoptosis inhibition, cell proliferation, tumor promotion,
  M2 macrophage polarization, and stem cell induction. These miRs are lodged into
  exosomes and transported to DOX sensitive cells to induce resistance by multiple
  signaling mechanisms, as depicted in the figure. DOX inhibits cell proliferation
  by activating the cAMP responsive element binding protein-like 1 (CREBL1)/proliferation
  potential protein (P2P) pathway via enhancing synthesis of ceramide. Ring finger-11
  (RFN-11) promotes ubiquitination and degradation of proapoptotic proteins; phosphatase
  and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN-10)/forkhead box O (FOXO) activates
  M2 macrophage polarization
