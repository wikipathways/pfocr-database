caption: Eosinophils modulate the functions of a multitude of cells of the innate
  and adaptive immune system. Although not professional antigen-presenting cells (APC),
  eosinophils can express MHC class II and costimulatory molecules (CD80 or CD86),
  process antigens and stimulate T cells to proliferate and produce cytokines in an
  antigen-specific manner. Acting with dendritic cells (DCs), eosinophils regulate
  the recruitment of T helper 2 (Th2) cells in response to allergen sensitization
  by producing CCL17 and CCL22. Eosinophil can also favor T follicular helper (Tfh)
  cell differentiation through the production of interleukin-6 []. Eosinophils also
  prime B cells and sustain long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow via the production
  of APRIL and interleukin-6. Eosinophils stimulated by CpG DNA and by EDN promotes
  the maturation and activation of DCs. MBP activates neutrophils causing the release
  of superoxide and interleukin-8 and increases their expression of the cell-surface
  integrin complement receptor 3 (CR3). Eosinophils also maintain alternatively activated
  macrophages (M2 macrophages) by producing interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. MBP,
  ECP, and EPX activate basophils and mast cells, resulting in the release of histamine.
  Eosinophil granule proteins also activate platelets. Eosinophil-derived NGF primes
  human basophils and modulates several functions of mast cells.
