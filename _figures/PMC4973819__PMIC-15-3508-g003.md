caption: 'Reconstruction of the C1 metabolism at the organismal level in the microbial
  communities inhabiting petroleum‐polluted marine sediments based on the proteome
  analysis. Panels A, B and C, represent the active pathways in HAV, MES and PRI,
  respectively. The complete C1 metabolism that included the metabolic coupling of
  CH4 and CH3OH metabolism and the Wood‐Ljungdahl pathway is shown in Panel (D). As
  shown, only a small portion of the reactions within the entire C1 metabolism (D)
  was identified as being active in HAV, MES and PRI (A–C). The presence of enzymes
  for each transformation and the taxonomic affiliation of polypeptides are shown.
  Circles in A–C represent the relative number of proteins (referred to the total
  number proteins assigned to these pathways) in a sample assigned to each taxonomic
  group (the total number of proteins of each is indicated in the circles). Solid
  lines (HAV, blue; MES, red; PRI, green) in A–C display the syntrophy between different
  members as they participate in contiguous reactions, as described in panel (D).
  The relative number of proteins assigned to these syntrophic reactions is presented
  by the line thickness. In panels (A–C), the grey colour indicates transformations
  for which no proteins in the proteome were identified, whereas the black colour
  represents transformations for which proteins were found (putatively active reactions).
  Transformations in the CH4 and CH3OH metabolism for which no proteome evidence were
  found (e.g., the glutathione (GSH) pathway connecting methanol with CO2) are not
  indicated. Note: the representation of CO2 in a circle (bottom of each panel) represents
  the presence of a carbon dioxide concentrating carboxysome shell protein, a structural
  protein involved in CO2 accumulation within the cells, but with no catalytic function.'
