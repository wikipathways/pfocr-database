caption: 'Simplified unscaled representation of MD‐2/TLR4 complex signaling induced
  by extracellular LPS. LBP extracts a single molecule of LPS from the micelle to
  deliver it to the MD2/TLR4 complex via CD14. The interaction with LPS results in
  the dimerization of the receptor, thereby activating two distinct signal transmission
  pathways. The first is the “Myddosome,” also known as the MyD88‐dependent pathway,
  which occurs at the cell surface. The second is the “Triffosome,” or TRIF‐dependent
  pathway, which originates from the endosome. Abbreviations: LPS, Lipopolysaccharide;
