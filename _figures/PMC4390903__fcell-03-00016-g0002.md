caption: DNA damage pathways and how CHK1-, WEE1-, or CDK1 inhibitors can synergize
  with cytarabine to increase its DNA damaging efficacy in AML. Ataxia-telangectasia
  mutated (ATM) protein kinase is activated in response to ionizing radiation (IR),
  radiomimetic agents, and agents which cause double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). Ataxia-telangiectasia-related
  (ATR) protein kinase is activated by a broader range of genotoxic stimuli that result
  in single-strand DNA breaks (SSB). In addition, ATM can also activate ATR. Initial
  sensing of DNA damage can also be mediated by the NBS1-MRE11-RAD50 complex and by
  RAD17-RAD1-HUS1-RAD9 at the site of DNA breaks. This is followed by phosphorylating
  CHK2, p53, MDM2 and CHK1, which mediate cell cycle checkpoint responses to arrest
  the cells until DNA damage is repaired. Activated p53 will induce p21 and the CDC25A
  protein, which inhibit CDK2 and prevents G1/S transition. Altered phosphorylation
  (by CHK1) or cytoplasmic sequestration of CDC25C (by 14-3-3σ) will inactivate CDK1/cyclin
  B preventing cells from entering mitosis. CHK1 also phosphorylates/activates WEE-1,
  which phosphorylates and inactivates CDK1/cyclin B complex on Tyr15 residue, resulting
  in cell cycle arrest at G2, allowing time for DNA repair. In AML, treatment with
  cytarabine (Ara-C) activates the DNA damage pathway through CHK1, which stabilizes
  stalled replication fork and induces S phase arrest. This will allow DNA damage
  induced by Ara-C to be repaired. To increase the DNA damaging efficacy of Ara-C
  the checkpoint pathway can be blocked by a selective CHK1 inhibitor such as MK-8776
  that overrides the S-phase checkpoint activation. To overcome the G2/M checkpoint
  blocking WEE-1 kinase using the selective inhibitor MK-1775 will result in CDK1
  activation and cells die due to accumulation of genetic lesions. CHEM, genotoxic
  chemicals; Rep stress, replication stress; UV, ultra violet radiation.
