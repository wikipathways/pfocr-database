caption: Overview of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae and the
  carotenogenic pathway in X. dendrorhous. The carotenogenic pathway in X. dendrorhous
  consists of GGPP synthase encoded by crtE, the bifunctional enzyme phytoene synthase
  and lycopene cyclase encoded by crtYB, and phytoene desaturase encoded by crtI.
  S. cerevisiae contains a GGPP synthase, encoded by BTS1, which is able to convert
  FPP into GGPP. HMG1 encodes HMG-CoA reductase, which is the main regulatory point
  in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway in many organisms. IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate;
  DMAP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate.
