caption: In silico model simulations of the choline - betaine pathway of the osmoadaptation
  mechanism. In C. salexigens, the osmoprotectant betaine is synthesized from its
  precursor choline in two steps. Whereas the first step from choline to betaine aldehyde
  is catalyzed either by membrane-bound choline dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.1, CsaI1514)
  or by a ferredoxin-dependent choline monooxygenase (EC 1.14.15.7, CsaI2455), betaine
  aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.8, CsaI1515) is involved in the second, betaine
  aldehyde to betaine step. FBA simulations were performed with biomass as the objective
  function and 3 mmol/gDW/h glucose uptake rate and the computed metabolic flux values
  in mmol/gDW/h are shown on bar charts. Uptake of exogeneous choline was restricted
  to 0, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2 mmol/gDW/h.
