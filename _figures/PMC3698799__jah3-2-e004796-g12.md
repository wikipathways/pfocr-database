caption: Proposed mechanism by which G6P accumulation regulates load‐induced mTOR
  activation and ER stress. The intersections of the metabolic pathway of glucose
  transport and phosphorylation with the molecular signaling pathways addressed in
  the study are shown. We propose that rapamycin (mTOR inhibition), metformin (AMPK
  activation), phenylbutyrate (ER stress relief), or LVAD (mechanical unloading) protect
  the heart from metabolic stress at high workload. G6P indicates glucose‐6‐phosphate;
  mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; AMPK, AMP kinase;
  LVAD, left ventricular assist device; HK, hexokinase; TSC, or tuberous sclerosis
  complex, is composed of TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin).
