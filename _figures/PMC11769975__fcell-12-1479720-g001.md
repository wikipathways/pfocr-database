caption: Mechanisms by which Fusobacterium nucleatum may contribute to colorectal
  carcinogenesis [This figure was created using MedPeer (www.medpeer.cn)]. The expression
  of β-catenin and NF-κB is mediated by the LPS of Fusobacterium nucleatum via TLR4.
  Additionally, through binding to E-cadherin, FadA promotes the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
  By binding to the host factor Gal-GalNAc in CRC tissues, Fap 2 facilitates the nuclear
  colonization of F. nucleatum. The carcinogenic consequences of CRC are related to
  these pathogen-host interactions. OMV stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, such as TNF and IL-8, and promotes intestinal inflammation by activating
  TLR-4 and affecting NF-κB signaling. By suppressing PTEN protein expression, miR-21
  promotes proliferation and invasion of CRC cells
