caption: A. A schematic of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway that converts the glycolysis
  intermediate fructose-6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) to UDP-GlcNAc showing the addition of
  nitrogen into the pathway from the amide side-chain of Gln. UDP-GlcNAc goes on to
  generate UDP-GalNAc and CMP-Neu5Ac so that the aminosugars GlcNAc (blue square),
  GalNAc (yellow square), or Neu5Ac (purple diamond) in glycoconjugates will have
  an additional +1 dalton to their mass if amide-15N-Gln is used as the nitrogen donor.
  Glc, glucose; GlcN, glucosamine. B. Schematic of the IDAWG in vivo cell culture
  labeling strategy for comparative glycomics. Amide-15N-Gln or Gln is added to the
  media to label cultured cells. Upon harvesting cells can be combined, then N-linked
  and O-linked glycans isolated from digested proteins for permethylation and tandem
  mass spectrometry analysis.
