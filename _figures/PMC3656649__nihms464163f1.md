caption: Estrogen (E)-bound ER, acting as a transcription factor in the nucleus (nuclear/genomic
  activity), binds to DNA sequences in promoter regions of target genes either directly
  (at estrogen receptor elements; EREs) or indirectly via protein-protein interaction
  with other transcription factors at their cognate DNA responsive sites (e.g., members
  of the AP-1 or the SP-1 transcription complexes at AP-1 or SP-1 sites). Upon estrogen
  binding, ER generally recruits coactivator complexes (CoA) to induce or modulate
  gene transcription including genes coding growth factors (GFs) and receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) (A). A small subset of the cellular pool of ER localized outside
  the nucleus and/or at the cell membrane associates in response to estrogen with
  growth factor RTKs (e.g., EGFR, HER2, and IGF1-R) (B) and with additional signaling
  and coactivator molecules (e.g. the Src kinase) (C). This interaction, similar to
  GF activation of these pathways, activates multiple downstream kinase pathways (e.g.,
  Src, PI3K/AKT, and Ras/p42/44 MAPK) which in turn phosphorylate various transcription
  factors (TFs) and coregulators, including components of the ER pathway that enhance
  gene expression on EREs and other response elements (RE). The nonnuclear/nongenomic
  activity, which can also be activated by tamoxifen, is enhanced in the presence
  of overexpression and hyperactivation of RTKs and can contribute to endocrine therapy
  resistance. Overall, the nuclear/genomic and nonnuclear/nogenomic ER activities
  work in concert to provide breast tumor cells with proliferation, survival and invasion
  stimuli. Signaling from the microenvironment activates stress related pathways and
  members of the integrin family. These pathways then trigger downstream kinase pathways
  (e.g., FAK, JNK and p38 MAPK) that can further modulate components of the transcriptional
  machinery, including ER (D). Alterations in each of these transcriptional and signaling
  elements can mediate resistance to endocrine therapy either by modulating ER activity
  or, by acting as escape pathways to provide alternative proliferation and survival
  stimuli.
