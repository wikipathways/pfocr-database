caption: Schematic shows titration of the chaperone BiP/Grp78 from the three main
  ER sensors IRE1 (inositol requiring enzyme 1), PERK (PKR-like eukaryotic initiating
  factor α kinase), and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) by misfolded proteins.
  The IRE1 pathway, through production of the alternatively translated product XBP1s,
  induces genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, ER-associated protein degradation
  (ERAD), and chaperones, to promote ER biogenesis, protein refolding, and disposal
  of damaged proteins. The PERK pathway, largely through induction of the transcription
  factor ATF4, additionally induces antioxidant-related genes and the phosphatase
  cofactor GADD34, which dephosphorylates eIF2α and deactivates the unfolded protein
  response (UPR). Release of ATF6 from BiP exposes Golgi localization signals, and
  ATF6 subsequently undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis to release a 50
  kDa active transcription factor that targets genes involved in ER biogenesis and
  protein refolding.
