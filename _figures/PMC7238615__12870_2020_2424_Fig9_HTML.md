caption: Simplified model of the molecular mechanism of MsTMT involved in plant water
  use efficiency and drought (DR) response. Overexpression of MsTMT in alfalfa represses
  the transcriptional level of SPCH, which plays a critical role in the initial asymmetric
  cell division of stomatal development from meristemoid mother cell (MMC) to stomatal-lineage
  ground cells (SLGCs). This repression causes more MMCs to differentiate into pavement
  cells resulting in reduced stomatal density that contributes to reduced transpiration
  rate and further to increased WUE, which probably in turn improves alfalfa drought
  tolerance. MsTMT also modulates photosynthesis by biochemical processes including
  light harvesting, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), Rubisco carboxylation and electron
  transport capacity. However, the overlapping effect of these factors have limited
  effect on photosynthetic capacity. MsTMT may response to drought stress involved
  in ABA-dependent and -independent pathways by regulating MYB, bZIP, WRKY, and RD22
  and NAC and DREB1B genes, respectively. The increase in MsTMT gene expression was
  accompanied by elevated expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST), laccase and
  gibberellic acid-stimulated Arabidopsis (GASA) genes that play an important role
  in protection against oxidative stress
