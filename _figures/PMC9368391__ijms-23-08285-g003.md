caption: 'Schematic diagram of innate immune response induced by coronavirus RNA.
  Viral dsRNA is sensed by TLR3 in endosomes, triggering the innate immune response,

  cytokines through the MyD88-TAK1-IKK-NF-κB signaling pathway. Viral dsRNA is recognized
  by MDA5 and NOD1, and then interacts with MAVS on mitochondria, which further activates
  the NF-κB and IRFs signaling pathways. Viral GU-rich ssRNA is sensed by TLR8, causing
  the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes through the Caspase-8-RIPK1 signaling pathway,
