caption: 'Structurally homologous and divergent enzymes in anaerobic cobalamin synthesis
  and the acetyl‐CoA pathway. Left panel: cobalamin synthesis pathway. Right panel:
  the acetyl‐CoA pathway. Structures from acetogens (blue) and methanogens (salmon)
  are shown superimposed [103], while non‐homologous structures are shown adjacent.
  Adjacent structures of the same colour point to non‐homologous enzymatic variants
  in the same prokaryotic domain, such as in the case of Hmd. Hmd is the Fe‐only hydrogenase
  of archaea that directly reduces methenyl‐H4MPT to methylene‐H4MPT, is expressed
  under nickel limitation, uses a unique iron‐guanylylpyridinol cofactor and is not
  homologous to any enzymes of the pathways shown here [104]. Grey shading highlights
  non‐homologous enzymes in methanogen‐acetogen comparisons. Structures were modelled
  with AlphaFold [105], except for FwdBD (PDB ID: 5T5I [106]) and CODH/ACS (PDB IDs:
  3CF4 and 1MJG [107, 108]). Methanogen ACS and methyl synthesis were modelled based
  on sequences from Methanothermobacter marburgensis. The acetogen methyl branch is
  from Moorella thermoacetica. In cobalamin biosynthesis, methanogen sequences are
  from Methanococcus maripaludis (and Methanosarcina barkeri in the case of CobA,
  which is specific to adenosylcobalamin synthesis and missing in many methanogens;
  see text) and acetogen sequences from M. thermoacetica. In multimers, only the structurally
  homologous subunit was shown for clarity. TM‐scores of structural alignments can
  be found in Table S1. For the nomenclature of enzymes involved in anaerobic cobalamin
  synthesis, see the legend and pannel (B) of Fig. 2. See also Svetlitchnaia et al.
