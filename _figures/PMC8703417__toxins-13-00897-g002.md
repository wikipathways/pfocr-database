caption: Pks+ E. coli promote tumorigenesis in an inflamed environment. Adapted from
  reference [].The color scale on the left indicates oxygen (O2) levels. (a) The healthy
  intestine harbors a diverse and dynamic microbial community (microbiota) which is
  dominated by obligate anaerobes (in white, green or blue); the expression of peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
  activates mitochondrial bioenergetics that consume O2, and thereby maintains epithelial
  hypoxia (O2 level < 1%). (b) In the inflamed intestine, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
  plays an important role for the transition from inflammation to malignancy. NF-κB
  induces interleukin 6 (IL-6) which promotes IEC proliferation, the inhibition of
  apoptosis, and other pro-tumorigenic pathway; the activation of tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF) enhances the activation of NF-κB, resulting in de-differentiation of IEC and
  facilitation of tumor initiation. NF-κB induces the generation of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) which increase epithelial oxygenation. A lower PPAR-γ expression also
  leads to a higher epithelial oxygenation. The increased O2 level benefits the expansion
  of facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae, including pks+ E. coli (in yellow;
  other Enterobacteriaceae are in orange). Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
  is expressed at a high level during intestinal inflammation, resulting in an elevated
  production of nitric oxide (NO) which generates nitrate (NO3−); NO3− boosts the
  growth of pks+ E. coli. The increased concentration of microbiota-derived formate
  enhances E. coli fitness in the inflamed intestine. Biofilm formation and intestinal
  barrier dysfunction are often found in colitis, which promote pks+ E. coli contact
  with IEC and invasion. Colibactin produced by pks+ E. coli causes DNA damages which
  lead to the mutations in genes, such as APC and miR-34a. This results in colorectal
  cancer (CRC) cells which are characterized by Wnt-independent growth, enhanced proliferation
  and impaired differentiation.
