caption: Mechanisms of luteolin (Lut)-induced apoptosis and autophagy in cancer cells.
  Luteolin mediates both the intrinsic and the extrinsic apoptosis pathways. Luteolin
  triggers the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by modulating mitochondrial membrane potential,
  releasing cytochrome c, and inhibiting the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Luteolin
  mediates extrinsic apoptosis by activating caspase activities; enhances expression
  of death receptors and their downstream factors such as Fas/FasL, DR4, DR5, and
  TRAIL; and suppresses other death receptor survival pathways. Luteolin also inhibits
  mdm2 activated by Ras; mdm2 expression triggers p53 degradation. p53, a tumor suppressor
  protein, mediates apoptosis by enhancing Bax levels and reducing levels of antiapoptotic
  protein Bcl-2. Luteolin can directly mediate apoptosis by mediating DNA damage induced
  by ROS. DNA damage signaling, in turn, enhances p53 production and activity. Luteolin
  activates JNK, which inhibits TNF-α-mediated NF-κB (p65) translocation, promoting
  TNF-α-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. However, luteolin can mediate autophagy
  as a cell death mechanism by triggering the intracellular acidic lysosomal vacuolization
  and accumulation of microtubule-associated LC3 II protein, which in turn enhances
  autophagy flux. IKK, I-κB kinase; LC3, light chain-3; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; TRAIL, tumor necrosis
  factor receptor apoptosis-inducing ligand.
