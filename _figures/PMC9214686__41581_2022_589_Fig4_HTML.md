caption: Following activation, cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) produces 2′,3′-cyclic
  GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which binds to stimulator of interferon genes (STING) within cells.
  The fate of intracellular cGAMP depends on its rate of synthesis, the cell type
  in which it is produced and the biological context. Excess cGAMP is transported
  out of cells and is hydrolysed by membrane-bound or soluble ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase
  phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) to yield AMP and GMP in the extracellular space,. When
  production and export of cGAMP exceeds the catabolic capacity of ENPP1, cGAMP is
  imported into adjacent or distal cells through specific transporters, some of which
  can mediate bidirectional transport (LRRC8). The best-studied transporter in vascular
  endothelial cells is the volume-regulated anion (VRAC) channel LRRC8A:C heteromer,
  whereas the solute carrier SLC19A1 is functional in human cell lines and peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells, and SLC46A2 is active in CD14+ monocytes and pro-inflammatory
  macrophages,–. In tumours, cGAMP can be transported between adjoining cells through
  gap junctions (for example, connexins 43 and 45),,, which can be blocked by the
  compounds shown. Several chemical compounds can block ENPP1 and cGAMP import as
  indicated. Sphingosine 1-phosphate can activate LRRC8 to potentiate cGAMP transport.
