caption: Signaling pathways of estrogen-mediated breast cancer cell proliferation.
  Estrogen treatment leads to breast cancer growth through genomic and non-genomic
  pathways. In the genomic pathway, estrogen and its receptors bind directly to specific
  DNA sequences called estrogen response elements (EREs) and activate gene expressions;
  additionally, in non-genomic pathways, estrogen signals can occur by plasma membrane
  localization of ER, or by GPER, to induce rapid cellular effects by activating several
  kinase cascades, such as cAMP-PKA, PI3K/AKT, and MEK/ERK 1/2. ER, estrogen receptor;
  GPER, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor; TF, transcription factor. Adapted from
  Wilkenfeld et al.
