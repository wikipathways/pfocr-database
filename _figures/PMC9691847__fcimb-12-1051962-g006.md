caption: Graphcal abstract. The dysfunction in gut microbiota could impair the tight
  junction of gut epithelial cells. Then, the LPS of gut microbiota could enter periphery
  through lack gut barrier and cause endotoxemia. After entering the periphery, LPS
  could induce inflammatory response in liver through the TLR4/NF-κB pathway [ (1)
  TLR4 in cellular membrane is activated after bind with LPS; (2) Activated TLR4 recruited
  MyD88 in cytoplasma to form a TLR4-MyD88 complex; (3) TLR4-MyD88 complex induced
  the phosphorylation of IκB and NF-κBp65; (4) Phosphorylated NF-κBp65 entered the
  nucleus and induced the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1β,
  IL-6 and TNF-α, whereas phosphorylated IκB was degraded in cytoplasma]. The inflammatory
  response in liver and the released cytokines could contribute to the progression
  of T2DM through inducing the insulin resistance and the dysfunction of pancreatic
  β cell. BHRS treatment ameliorated T2DM through regulating the dysbiosis of gut
  microbiota, enhancing the gut permeability and inhibiting the activation of TLR4/NF-κB
  pathway.
