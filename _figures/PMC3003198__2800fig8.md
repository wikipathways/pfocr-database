caption: Scheme illustrating the dynamic reciprocity between MMP9 and the Raf–MEK–ERK
  pathway, which determines whether cells would continue to proliferate or undergo
  acinar morphogenesis. Culture of HMECs on 3D lrECM allows formation of polarized
  acini and reduction in proliferation. Increased Raf–MEK–ERK pathway induces MMP9
  expression, which in turn prevents the formation of basal polarity by promoting
  the remodeling of the BM through the proteolysis of LM1. Inhibition of MMP9 activity
  with chemical inhibitors (GM6001 or Marimastat) or shutting down MMP9 expression
  directly with shRNA allows acinar polarization. Down-modulation of the MAPK pathway
  directly with shRNA to MEK1/2 or indirectly by inhibition of EGFR (AG1478) or PI3K
  (LY294002) allows the cells to integrate the proper signaling pathways and promotes
  acinar polarization. The result of proper modulation of the MAPK signaling pathway
  during acinar formation is to reduce the levels of MMP9, thereby protecting the
  integrity of ECM proteins, feeding back the appropriate signals to maintain tissue
  homeostasis. (RTKs) Receptor tyrosine kinases; (mRTKLs) membrane-bound RTK ligands;
  (sRTKLs) soluble RTKLs.
