caption: Putative model of high polysaccharide production in the mutated H. erinaceus.
  The Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway could act as glucose signaling regulation. The dysfunction
  of glucose signaling regulation was due to its reduced expression of the Ras-cAMP-PKA
  pathway in the mutated H. erinaceus, which loses the glucose sensing and cause a
  long delay in the glucose response, finally resulting in the block of S phase progression.
  The block of S phase progression might lead to polysaccharide production by increasing
  the activity of the pathways involved in polysaccharide production. Glyoxylate cycle
  module and glycolysis module in Fig. f participate in the production of the glucose-6p,
  such as the role of MAF1, MLS1, PGK1 in the two modules. Glucose-6p connects to
  the pathways involved in producing repeat units through the MPBP in Fig. c, such
  as the role of GAL10 in the conversion from UDP-Glucose to UDP-Galactose. The block
  of S phase progression might interact with the reduced protein translation in the
  mutated H. erinaceus through SCH9. The image depicted in Fig. 9 is our own
