caption: Schematic representation of the actin mechanism of the NRF2 signaling pathway.
  Under basal conditions, a KEAP1/CUL3/RBX1 complex binds to NRF2 and promotes ubiquitination
  to commit proteasomal degradation. Upon activation of NRF2 by electrophiles or reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and other ligands, NRF2 enters the nucleus to associate with
  sMAF, p21Cip1, JDP2, binds to ARE cis-element, and modulates the expression of several
  gene families such as anti-oxidation, detoxification, anti-inflammation, reprogramming
  and cell fate decision, and cell cycle. GCLC (glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic
  subunit), GCLM (glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit), GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase
  4), SLC7A11 (solute carrier family 7 member 11), TXN1 (thioredoxin1), SDO1 (super
  oxide dismutase type 1), HO-1 (heme oxygenase 1), NQO1(NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase
  1), UGT1A1 (UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1), SULTA1 (Sulfotransferase
  family 1A member 1), ABCB6 (ATP-binding cassette superfamily B member 6), IL (interleukin),
  HIF 1α (hypoxia inducible factor 1α), BMP6 (bone morphogenic protein 6), NOTCH 1
  (neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1), PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma), and MyoD1(myogenic differentiation 1).The circle indicated the
