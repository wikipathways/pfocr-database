caption: Vascular adhesion and leukocyte transmigration. Focal adhesion, Vascular
  Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) - signaling and leukocyte transmigration functional
  annotations were derived from pathway interactions and merged for visualization
  due to high overlap (83%). Fold enrichment ​= ​10.39, Benjamini p ​= ​3.24-17, FDR
  p ​= ​5.16E-19. Connectors indicate pathway (green, 10.98% weight), co-localization
  (blue, 5.52% weight), predicted interactions (light orange, 18.92%), and physical
  interactions (light pink, 23.38% weight). Node colors represent the ratio between
  the average of groups, as indicated. Genes that are decreased in T ratio comparisons
  are indicated by shades of blue. Genes that are increased in comparisons are indicated
  in shades of orange. No change is represented in white. (For interpretation of the
