caption: Oncolytic adenoviruses infect tumor cells, replicate their genome (important
  viral gene expression products are E1A and E1B, which allow the virus to take over
  the cellular replication machinery), assemble new viral particles and kill the host
  tumor cells by lysis, resulting in the release of the progeny viruses. This new
  virus generation spreads, and starts a new cycle of virus replication and tumor
  cell killing. Conditionally replicative adenoviruses are restricted in their replication
  to specific factors in the target cancer cells (certain cell cycle pathway defects).
  As a consequence, infection of normal cells by oncolytic adenoviruses and/or their
  replication within these cells is attenuated. Thus, the ideal oncolytic adenovirus
  represents an efficient and specific anti-cancer agent.
