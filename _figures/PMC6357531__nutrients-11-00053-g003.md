caption: Proposed model by which polyphenols may modulate oxidative stress-induced
  pathways including Ang II, VEGF and TNFα. These inflammatory pathways activate common
  signaling pathways associated with Akt/mTOR/PGC-1α and NF-κB/Nox(s)/MMP pathways.
  Polyphenols from fruits, vegetables and olive oil inhibit these signaling pathways
  at different levels. Overall, polyphenols found in the Mediterranean diet reduce
  inflammation and oxidative stress pathways associated with senescence. Mitochondrial
  ROS (MitoROS), which is upregulated during aging and by activation of Ang II signaling
  pathway is also reduced by polyphenols.
