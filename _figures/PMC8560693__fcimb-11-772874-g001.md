caption: The PTS system. Depicted is a generalized schematic of the PTS that exists
  in Firmicutes. Phosphates are transferred across conserved histidine residues on
  EI, HPr, and EIIA. A conserved cysteine serves as the site of phosphorylation on
  EIIB (asterisk indicates an exception to this in mannose-specific EIIBs which are
  phosphorylated on a histidine). Major regulatory pathways diverging from the pathway
  include PCVRs which are putatively controlled through phosphorylation on PRD histidine
  residues by HPr and/or EIIB proteins as well as carbon catabolite repression through
  phospho-Ser-HPr. The transition of unphosphorylated HPr to phospho-Ser-HPr is initiated
  by abundance of ATP as well as the activation of HPr K/P by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
  (FBP). HPr K/P can also transfer the phosphate from phospho-Ser-HPr by moving it
  from HPr to a substrate phosphate (Pi), resulting in the formation of pyrophosphate
  (PPi).
