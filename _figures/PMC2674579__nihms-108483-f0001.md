caption: GST-MDA-7 causes PERK-dependent vacuolization and JNK pathway activation
  in transformed cells that leads to cell death. Exposure to GST-MDA-7 causes a PERK-dependent
  activation of the JNK pathway and a PERK-dependent inactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway.
  Enhanced JNK pathway signaling plays a key role in the activation of pro-caspase
  2, pro-caspase 4 and cathepsin B. Activation of cathepsin B promotes the cleavage/activation
  of the BH3 domain protein BID. Elevated JNK pathway signaling also activates BAX.
  Inactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway facilitates activation of BAD and BIM. Thus GST-MDA-7,
  via PERK signaling, promotes increased activity of at least 4 BH3 domain proteins
  which all act to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and ultimately promote cell killing.
