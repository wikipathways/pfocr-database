caption: The effects of melatonin on the metabolites that were involved in the carbon
  metabolic pathway. (A) Assignment of the 18 metabolites from 54 assayed metabolites
  to the carbon metabolic pathway. The concentrations of these 18 metabolites are
  shown in Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online. (B) Effect of exogenous melatonin
  treatment on primary metabolism in bermudagrass. Transcripts participating in the
  same pathway or homologues are represented by a set of closely connected cubes,
  and the 2-based logarithm of fold change value (log2FC) is denoted. (This figure
  is available in colour at JXB online.)
