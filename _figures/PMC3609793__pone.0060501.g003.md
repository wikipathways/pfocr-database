caption: 'Example of a gene network derived from genes uniquely regulated at 48 hours,
  comprising 3 merged networks consisting of 444 genes (red, increased expression;
  green, decreased expression) as derived from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Selected
  regions of the network are highlighted, consisting of genes involved in: (a) Antimicrobial
  response, Inflammatory response, Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction (“MX1 genes”,
  network score 23); (b) Cell Death, Cell Signaling, DNA Replication, Recombination
  and Repair (“CASP genes”, network score 33); (c) Cellular Development, Hematological
  System Development and Function, Hematopoiesis (“RB1 genes”, network score 37).'
