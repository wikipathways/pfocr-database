caption: Sulfur trafficking in the synthesis of the thiolated nucleosides in S. enterica.
  The dotted arrows indicate uncertainties as to whether other proteins participate
  in sulfur mobilization, since the details of the transfer have not been established,
  whereas solid arrows indicate established pathways. Sulfur from Cys is transferred
  to IscS, creating a persulfide, and the sulfur is in turn moved to its various target
  proteins in the synthesis of s4U, (c)mnm5s2U (s2U), s2C, and ms2i(o)6A (ms2) ().
  The synthesis of all thiolated nucleosides requires IscS, and mutants deficient
  in all thiolated nucleosides are designated class I mutants. In the synthesis of
  s4U and (c)mnm5s2U, sulfur is transferred directly from the persulfide present in
  IscS to a protein, which is ThiI in the synthesis of s4U or TusA in the synthesis
  of (c)mnm5s2U ([Fe-S] protein-independent pathway or pathway II). The arrow from
  IscS to ThiI represents the direct transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI (, , ),
  and the multistep arrow between IscS and MnmA shows the TusA-to-TusD/TusBC/TusE
  sulfur relay (). Mutants defective in these pathways are designated class II mutants,
  mutants deficient only in s4U are class IIA, and those deficient only in mnm5s2U
  are class IIB. The synthesis of s2C and ms2i(o)6A depends on [Fe-S] cluster proteins,
  whose formation is dependent on proteins IscU, IscA, Fdx, HscA, and HscB () ([Fe-S]-dependent
  pathway or pathway III). Besides IscU, only IscA is shown, since its presence is
  required for efficient formation of only ms2i(o)6A, and this IscA-mediated stimulation
  may act by optimizing IscU[Fe-S] formation (arrow a) and/or by optimizing mature
  MiaB formation (arrow b). Mutants deficient in s2C and ms2i(o)6A are designated
  class III mutants. The mutants deficient only in s2C are class IIIA mutants, and
  those that are deficient only in ms2i(o)6A are class IIIB mutants.
