caption: Diagram summarizing the effects of effector proteins on inflammatory signaling
  pathways in host cells. The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathways are two main pro-inflammatory signaling pathways targeted
  and modulated by effector proteins translocated from EPEC into the host cells via
  the T3SS for immune subversion. Tir spans the host cell membrane with two predicted
  transmembrane (TM) domains. The central extracellular intimin-binding domain (IBD)
  is essential for binding to intimin. The phosphorylation of Tyr483/Tyr511 and Tyr
  454 recruits SHP1/2 and PI3K, respectively. NleE stabilizes IκB by inactivating
  TAB2 and TAB3. NleC cleaves the NF-κB subunits and minimizes the activity of p300
  and RPS3. NleH1/NleH2 control the activity of RPS3, which confers regulatory specificity
  on NF-κB-mediated gene expression. NleA blocks NLRP3 inflammasome activation downstream
  of the NF-κB pathway. NleD directly cleaves p38 and JNK, which are involved in the
  MAPK signaling pathway. These two pathways are not separated but are linked by certain
  intermediate proteins, such as TAK1, which means that a more extensive modulatory
  effect on inflammation may be present. See the text for explanation.
