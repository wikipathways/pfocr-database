caption: 'In the transformations leading up to the critical macro-cyclization, we
  fully anticipated the possibility of significant isomerization during activation
  of the trieno-acid. This indeed proved to be the case! However, after a careful
  survey, two sets of mild conditions were found to deliver the desired (Z,Z,E)-configured
  macrolactone (+)-19 as the major product: the Yonemitsu modification of the Yamaguchi
  conditions involving direct introduction at room temperature of DMAP at the outset
  without pre-formation of the mixed anhydride, and the Evans modified Mukaiyama protocol,
  employing NaHCO3 and 20 at room temperature (). Notwithstanding our initial success
  in solving the challenging macrolactonization, (+)-19 was contaminated with minor
  amounts of other geometric isomers, which proved difficult to separate. The problem
  appears to lie with the reversibility of a Michael addition of DMAP or iodide to
  the activated trieno-acid during the lactonization process. Another issue associated
  with Mukaiyama reagent 20 is halogen exchange to give 21, which is known to be nonreactive
  as an activating agent for carboxylic acid coupling. To address these issues, modified
  Mukaiyama reagent 22 was adopted, which possessed a non-nucleophilic counterion
  (i.e., tetrafluoroborate), thus mitigating the undesired Michael addition, as well
  as the inactivation pathway. Pleasingly, reagent 22 delivered macrolide (+)-19 in
  85% yield, with minimum isomerization (ca. <4%).'
