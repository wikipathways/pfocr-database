caption: The activation of Akt by PI3Kδ leads to the phosphorylation of the BACH2
  and FOXO1 transcription factors and their retention in the cytoplasm. BACH2 and
  FOXO1 regulate expression of key genes in Treg differentiation and function, including
  genes encoding FOXP3, L-selectin, CCR7 and IFNγ. Failure to activate this pathway
  upon PI3Kδ inhibition may prevent Treg from undergoing a differentiation program
  and migrating effectively to tumors in order to suppress anti-tumor responses. By
  contrast, constitutive PI3Kδ activation upon loss of PTEN may destabilize the Treg
  lineage, loss of FOXP3 and CD25 expression, resulting in loss of suppressive function
  of the Treg and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines instead of the normal immune-suppressive
  factors produced by Treg.
