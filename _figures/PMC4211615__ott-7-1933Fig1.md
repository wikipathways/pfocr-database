caption: 'EMT-associated signaling molecules in glioma cell. Glioma-associated stromal
  molecules, including TNC, YKL-40, osteonectin, SDF-1, TGF-β1, HGF, EGF, PDGF, and
  IL-6, trigger the EMT via stimulating corresponding receptors in glioma cells. Cell
  surface molecules, including IL-6R, TGF-βR, CXCR4, c-MET, EGFR, and PDGF receptor,
  initiate the oncogenic signaling cascade when they are activated by their specific
  ligands. β4 integrins and α5β1 and αVβ6 integrins are also associated with transmitting
  the EMT-promoting signals. In addition, glioma cells express the mesenchymal stem
  cell-associated surface markers such as CD29, CD44, CD90, and CD105. Intracellular
  signaling networks, including ERK, MAPK, PI3K, Akt, SMADs, β-catenin, and the Ras
  pathway, are involved in the EMT. These signaling networks activate a series of
  EMT-promoting transcription factors such as Snail, Slug, ZEB1, and TWIST.Abbreviations:
  CXCR4, chemokine (C–X–C motif) receptor 4; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EMT, epithelial
  to mesenchymal transition; ERK, extracellular regulated kinase; HGF, hepatocyte
  growth factor; IL-6, interleukin-6; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PDGF,
  platelet-derived growth factor; PI3K, phosphatidylionositol 3-kinase; TGF-β1, transforming
  growth factor β1; TNC, tenascin C; ZEB1, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1.'
