caption: 'Activation of the NF-κB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways are crucial for
  proper antiviral response. However, in case of infection, bacteria/viruses have
  a number of opportunities to inhibit both pathways: trigger NF-κB translocation
  from cytoplasm into the nuclei (1) through plasma membrane (2, bacteria) or endosomal
  (3, viruses) TLR activation; by activing various STAT family members that being
  important for the virus replication (4), by controlling STAT activation/translocation
  to the nucleus (5); and last but not least by reducing the activity of the suppressor
  of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), a host negative regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway
  (6). Abbreviations: TLR, Toll like receptor; TIR, Toll/IL-1R; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; IkB – inhibitor of the
  NF-κB kinase; P – phosphate residue (activated form); Cytokine R, a cytokine receptor
  with β1 and β2 subunits; JAK, Janus tyrosine kinase familly; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription family; SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3.'
