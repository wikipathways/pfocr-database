caption: Depiction of AC5 signaling effects on cellular antioxidant imbalances in
  AC5WT and AC5KO hearts. When AC5 is disrupted (AC5KO), there is less βAR-stimulated
  cAMP, which decreases PKA activity. Lack of PKA leads to the activation of the Raf-1/MEK-ERK
  signaling pathway to increase the expression of MnSOD. This results in attenuation
  of oxidative stress. MnSOD antioxidant defense is not as present in AC5WT. O• indicates
  oxidative stress. Adapted from (Chester and Watts, 2007); image designed using BioRender
