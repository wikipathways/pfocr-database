caption: Targeting SUMOylation for antiviral therapy. A) In EBV positive cells, LMP1
  upregulates the cellular SUMO pathway to maintain viral latency, interfere with
  the innate immune response, and promote tumorigenesis. By preventing this, for example,
  with glycyrrhizic acid or ML‐792, the SUMOylation pathway can be inhibited to suppress
  the infection of new cells and EBV‐associated lymphoid malignancies. B) In HIV infected
  cells, TRIM28 SUMOylates CDK9 to inhibit viral transcription and maintain HIV latency
  through the suppression of P‐TEFb assembly by suppressing interactions between CDK9
  and CycT1, which can be targeted by LRAs. The SENP inhibitor SPI‐01 could target
  HIV integrase to inhibit HIV from integrating into the host genome without influencing
  its reverse transcription.
