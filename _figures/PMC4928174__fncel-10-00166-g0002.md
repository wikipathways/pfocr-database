caption: Canoncial and non-canonical Reelin signaling. Alternative schemes of Reelin
  signaling are shown. Examples for the different concepts are discussed in the text.
  (A) The canonical signaling pathway involves direct binding of Reelin via its central
  fragment to apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (Apoer2) and very low density lipoprotein
  receptor (Vldlr), which induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1. This leads to
  the modulation of downstream signaling effectors. In this model, recruitment of
  SFK by Reelin-binding coreceptors is not required. (B) Other transmembrane receptors
  can be indirectly activated by Reelin-Dab1 dependent signaling in an inside-out
  manner; here, the receptors function as downstream effectors of the canonical Reelin
  signaling cascade. (C) In this model, the recruitment of SFK requires Reelin-binding
  coreceptors in addition to the canonical Reelin receptors Apoer2 and Vldlr. Cadherin-related
  neuronal receptors (CNR) or ephrin B proteins have been suggested to represent such
  putative obligatory coreceptors (see text for details). (D) Non-canonical activation
  of Dab1 signaling has been reported; this can either involve other ligands than
  Reelin that signal via Apoer2 or Vldlr; alternative Reelin receptors, as depicted
  here; or transphosphorylation of Dab1 via receptor tyrosine kinases. Reelin can
  also bind to alternative receptors, e.g., via its aminoterminal fragment, and induce
  Dab1-independent signaling cascades. (E) Dab1-independent Reelin signaling via Apoer2
  or Vldlr has been postulated, based on phenotypic differences between the respective
  mouse knockout models. Apoer2-or Vldlr-specific Reelin signaling events have been
  reported as well, which could involve as yet unidentified receptor-specific adapter
  proteins. (F) Downstream effectors of canonical Reelin signaling function as convergence
  points for various upstream regulators, allowing responsive cells to fine-tune their
  response to external and internal stimuli in a context-dependent manner.
