caption: The main signaling pathway YAP/TAZ involved in OA. The research of YAP/TAZ
  in OA is mainly carried out in chondrocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and fibroblast-like
  synovial cells (FLSs), which mainly regulate the proliferation, differentiation,
  anabolism and catabolism of cells and affect OA through a variety of signaling pathways
