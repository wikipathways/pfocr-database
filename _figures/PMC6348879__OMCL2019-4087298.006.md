caption: 'A schematic model illustrating the underlying mechanism of the alleviated
  effect of melatonin on radiation-induced lung injury through the miR-30e/NLRP3 signaling
  pathway. TLRs and DAMPs activated by radiation further promoted the ROS generation
  and, secondly, the transcription of NLRP3. Moreover, miR-30e was downregulated in
  the macrophages of an irradiated cell model but its target gene NLRP3 was upregulated,
  thus leading to the enhanced assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, then the cleavage
  of pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β. Green lines: facilitation. Red lines: inhibition.'
