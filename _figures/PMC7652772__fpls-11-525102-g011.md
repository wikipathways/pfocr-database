caption: 'The GSL biosynthesis pathway (adapted from ) is initiated by a complex and
  interacting network of abiotic and biotic factors. Aliphatic synthesis pathway shown
  in teal, and the indolic pathway shown in pink, is regulated by R2R3-MYB transcription
  factors. Known interactions between MYBs and specific genes within each respective
  pathway are highlighted as follows: ○ MYB28; ★ = MYB29; ☉ = MYB76; ■ = MYB34; ◆
  = MYB51;  = MYB122. Genes with identified orthologs in the E. sativa genome annotation
  are written in black; those with no identified homologous sequence are written in
  gray. SLIM1, sulfur limitation 1; IQD1, protein IQ domain 1; BCAT, methionine aminotransferase;
  MAM, methylthioalkylmalate synthase; CYP, cytochrome P450; GST, glutathione-S-transferase;
  SUR1, C-S lyase 1; UGT, UDP-glycosyltransferase; FMOGS–OX, flavin-containing monooxygenase;
  ASA1, anthranilate synthase alpha subunit 1; TSB1, tryptophan synthase beta chain
  1; IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; NIT, nitrilase; ESM1, epithiospecifier modifier protein
