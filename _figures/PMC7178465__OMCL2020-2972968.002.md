caption: Danger-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP) binds to the Pattern Recognition
  Receptors (PRRs) expressed on the cytosol or in innate immune cell membranes. The
  cascade triggered by these PRRs leads to NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activation,
  which can activate IL-1β and IL-18. Oxidized mitochondrial DNA (ox-mtDNA) and mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) also activate the inflammasome. NF-κB, through the
  transcriptional activation pathway, generates tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
  and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 activate the
  enzymes IDO and TDO of the kynurenine pathway, degrading tryptophan into kynurenine.
  These two cytokines further activate KMO, which is the enzyme that directs kynurenine
  to be degraded to 3HK and quinolinic acid, both neurotoxic agents, over the kynurenic
  acid, a neuroprotective agent. Kynurenic acid is an NMDA receptor agonist and increases
  glutamate levels and consequently intracellular calcium. Excessive amounts of ROS
  are produced over the kynurenine pathway.
