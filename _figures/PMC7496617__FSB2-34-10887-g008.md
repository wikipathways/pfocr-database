caption: 'TRPM8 expression along the olfactory‐amygdala pathway and testosterone‐dependent
  TRPM8 signaling in the wild type and TRPM8−/− mice. A, schematic representation
  of TRPM8 expression in the olfactory epithelium (OE), olfactory bulb (OB), and the
  amygdala (Amy). Abbreviations: medial preoptic area (MPOA); ventral tegmental area
  (VTA); vomeronasal organ (VNO); accessory olfactory bulb (AOB); hypothalamus (Hypo).
  B, a proposed model for the role of TRPM8 in testosterone (T)‐induced reward mechanism,
  which is diminished in TRPM8−/− (TRPM8‐KO), leading to a delayed sexual satiety.
  C, molecular models of testosterone‐dependent signaling in the WT (left) and TRPM8−/−
  (right) mice. In the WT mice, testosterone‐induced TRPM8 activity results in rapid
  Ca2+ or Na+ influx. PIP2 regulates this activity as the prime TRPM8 gating co‐factor
  with all its known agonists. In addition, testosterone (T) taken up by the cell
  is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5α‐reductase (5αR) and estradiol (E)
  by aromatase (Aro). DHT can bind to the transcription factor Androgen Receptor (AR),
  with subsequent activation of the target genes at the Androgen Receptor Elements
  (ARE). E can bind to its cognate receptors, Estrogen Receptors (ER), and regulate
  their target genes via interacting with the Estrogen Receptor Elements (ERE). In
  TRPM8 knockout mice (right panel), the lack of functional TRPM8 results in diminished
  rapid testosterone signaling and enhanced levels of testosterone as well as its
  metabolic products DHT and E, leading to enhanced activation of AR and ER at least
  in some cell populations'
