caption: Genetic, environmental and hormonal factors act on various elements of the
  innate and adaptive immune responses. Gene copy variants (for example, C4 and FCR)
  and SNPs influence the expression of many genes involved in the immune response
  as well as in the control of organ damage (for example, APOL1 and KLK). Environmental
  factors, including UV light, drugs and products of the microbiome, alter T and B
  cell responses and the functions of innate cells by stimulating TLRs. Hormones and
  genes defined by the X chromosome contribute to disease expression by altering the
  function of lymphocytes and of cells of the innate immune response. The involved
  factors lead eventually to loss of tolerance of B and T cells to autoantigens, which
  are present in abundance because of both increased rates of apoptosis and defects
  in mechanisms responsible for their clearance. The T cell response to antigen is
  aberrant in and late signaling events () and results in misbalanced levels of cytokines,
  including decreased IL-2 and increased IL-17 production. T cells, through distinct
  pathways, also acquire a greater ability to invade tissues and contribute to the
  inflammatory response. B cells, in response to cognate and non-cognate (cytokines)
  interactions with T cells, produce antibodies. Antibodies enter tissues directly
  or in the form of immune complexes (IC), which contribute to tissue inflammation.
  Cells of the innate immune response, under the influence of the involved pathogenic
  factors, produce cytokines (including IFN-α) or, through the direct interaction
  with lymphocytes, contribute significantly to the inflammatory organ-damaging response.
  The clinical heterogeneity of the disease is highly correlated with the multitude
  of the pathways that lead to organ injury. Although several pathways operate in
  each individual, the relative contribution of each pathway varies from person to
  person. Finally, local factors dictate which organ will be afflicted by the autoinflammatory
  response.
