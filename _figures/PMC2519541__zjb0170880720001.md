caption: Acetate switch. Glycolysis (green) metabolizes glucose to acetyl-CoA in an
  NAD+-dependent manner. Acetate dissimilation requires the Pta-AckA pathway (blue).
  The enzyme phosphotransacetylase (PTA) converts acetyl-CoA and inorganic phosphate
  (Pi) into CoA and the high-energy pathway intermediate acetyl-P. The enzyme acetate
  kinase (ACKA) converts acetyl-P and ADP to acetate and ATP. The acetate freely diffuses
  across the cell envelope into the environment. Acetate assimilation (red) requires
  the high-affinity enzyme ACS. In a two-step process that involves an enzyme-bound
  intermediate (acetyl-AMP), ACS converts acetate, ATP, and CoA into AMP, pyrophosphate
  (PPi), and acetyl-CoA. Pyrophosphatases (PPase) degrade the PPi to Pi, ensuring
  that the reaction functions in the direction of acetyl-CoA. Protein acetyltransferase
  (PAT) uses acetyl-CoA as its acetyl donor to acetylate ACS (AcACS), which is inactive.
  When the glycolytic carbon source is depleted, NAD+ is recycled (not shown). The
  NAD+-dependent CobB (a sirtuin) can now deacetylate ACS, with by-product 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose
  (2′-OAADPr). The reactivated ACS produces acetyl-CoA, which replenishes the NAD+-dependent
  TCA cycle (purple). The TCA cycle delivers electrons to the ETC in the form of NADH
  (purple). The primary result is ATP.
