caption: Canonical Hippo signaling. When Hippo signaling is activated, MAP4 kinases
  or the MST1/2 kinases phosphorylate and activate the LATS family of kinases. The
  MST/LATS interaction is facilitated by MOB and SAV adaptor proteins. Activated LATS
  kinases subsequently phosphorylate the YAP and TAZ paralogs, which then associate
  with 14-3-3 proteins and are sequestered in the cytoplasm or degraded. When Hippo
  signaling is inactive, YAP/TAZ are not phosphorylated and are free to translocate
  to the nucleus, where they act as coactivators of transcription through interaction
  with TEAD family and other transcription factors. Image created with BioRender.com.
