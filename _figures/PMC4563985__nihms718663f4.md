caption: 'Potential mechanisms of NF-κB-mediated diseases. (a) Pediatric granulomatous
  arthritis/Blau syndrome. Upon activation or when mutated, NOD2 oligomerizes and
  recruits the kinase RIPK2. IAP proteins then mediate the ubiquitylation of RIPK2,
  enabling it to initiate a signal pathway that results in transcriptional activation,
  most notably through the canonical NF-κB pathway. Oligomerized NOD2 can also associate
  with the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS to activate IFN production. (b) CARD14-mediated
  psoriasis (CAMPS). Expression of adaptor protein CARD14 is largely restricted to
  keratinocytes. Although it is unclear what signals drive CARD14 activation, activation
  of PKC results in CARD14 phosphorylation and activation. Upon activation or when
  mutated, as in patients with CAMPS, it associates with the BCL10/MALT1 complex,
  resulting in excessive NF-κB activation. NF-κB-associated gene transcription then
  drives neutrophil and lymphocyte chemotaxis and psoriasis-like skin inflammation.
  In general, the inflammatory mediators induced by excessive NF-κB activation vary
  by disease and cell type. Number in black circled indicates ❶ disease caused by
  increased sensor/adaptor function. (Other abbreviations: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis;
  MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein; PKC, protein kinase C; XIAP, X-linked
  IAP.)'
