caption: The profibrotic actions of TGF-β are positively regulated by Th2 cytokines
  IL-4 and IL-13. TGB-β can induce fibrosis via the canonical SMAD signaling pathway.
  The binding of TGF-β ligands to their cognate receptors activates a cascade of SMAD
  proteins, which form a complex and translocate to the nucleus to transcribe specific
  genes. The expression of fibrosis-associated genes, such as collagen and fibronectin,
  results in ECM deposition, fibroblast proliferation, and myofibroblast differentiation.
  While these biological processes constitute physiologic wound healing, overactive
  TGF-β/SMAD signaling can lead to tissue fibrosis.α-SMA, alpha smooth muscle actin;
  CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; ECM, extracellular matrix; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases;
  TGF-β, transforming growth factor-beta; TIMPs, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases
