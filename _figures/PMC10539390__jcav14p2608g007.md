caption: Melatonin synergizes the chemotherapeutic effect of 5-FU to inhibit the growth
  of gastric cancer by targeting multiple signaling pathways. Melatonin in combination
  5-FU suppressed the expression level of Ki67, and inhibited the expression level
  of MLCK, the phosphorylation level of MLC and the expression level of p62, and promoted
  the expression levels of Beclin-1 and LC3B, thereby suppressed the MLCK signaling
  pathway and promoted autophagy signal pathway. And autophagy inhibitors 3-MA could
  reverse cell migration, cell invasion, the levels of MLCK expression, MLC phosphorylation
  and autophagy-related proteins expression.
