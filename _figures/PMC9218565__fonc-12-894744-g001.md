caption: NNMT participates in different signaling pathways in the TME. (A) NNMT expression
  is directly regulated by transcription factors and subsequently affects metastasis,
  invasion, apoptosis, and autophagy via a series of downstream signal pathways in
  cancer cells. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β (HNF-1β) and STAT3 can regulate NNMT
  levels. Moreover, BRCA1 can occupy the NNMT promoter and regulate NNMT expression.
  In hepatic stellate cells, upregulated NNMT expression alters H3K27 methylation
  status and affects the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) of CD44, which contributes to tumor
  metastasis. NNMT promotes clear cell renal cell carcinoma invasion and metastasis
  by altering matrix metalloproteinase 2 expression. NNMT also lowers the phosphorylation
  of AKS1 that is an upstream signal of the p38-MAPK pathway and reduces apoptosis
  in colorectal cancer cells. NNMT can alter protein phosphatase2A methylation status
  and influence ULK1 activity to regulate autophagy in breast cancer. (B) NNMT regulates
  autophagy in CSCs by influencing NAD+ metabolism. NNMT decreases the activity of
  NAD+-dependent enzyme PARP1 that can influence autophagy by upregulation AMPK pathway
  and downregulation mTOR pathway in CSCs. (C) NNMT overexpression contributes to
  global hypomethylation and promotes CAF formation. NNMT can elevate 5-methylthioadenosine
  levels and contribute to global hypomethylation, which alters the methylation status
  of genes involved in collagen production and promotes Normal fibroblasts acquiring
  CAF phenotype.
