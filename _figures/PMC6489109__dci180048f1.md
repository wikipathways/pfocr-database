caption: Simple schematic of the proximal insulin signaling pathway in skeletal muscle
  of normal pregnancy and GDM. Insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation (P) of
  the insulin receptor (IR), defective in GDM, which activates the insulin receptor
  to dock IRS-1. After IRS-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine domains, it triggers the
  recruitment of PI 3-kinase, a critical enzyme for glucose transport into the cell.
  GDM women also have decreased tyrosine activation of IRS-1 and reduced IRS-1, in
  part due to increased serine phosphorylation that increases the degradation of IRS-1
  and dampens the insulin signal. The increase in basal IRS-1 serine phosphorylation
  does not resolve in GDM women who show persistent glucose intolerance postpartum
  and are at highest risk for type 2 diabetes. PI 3-kinase is composed of a regulatory
  subunit (p85α) and a catalytic subunit (p110) that must form a heterodimer for PI
  3-kinase activation to occur. When excess p85α monomers are stimulated by hPGH in
  normal pregnancy, it competes with the p85-p110 heterodimer for binding to IRS-1,
  thereby causing a decrease in the IRS-1–associated PI 3-kinase activity and reduction
  in GLUT-4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Elevated p85 reverses postpartum
  with the disappearance of hPGH.
