caption: Ddb1, as a component of the CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex, may control,
  among other targets and potentially in an indirect way, the expression and activity
  of p53 (tp53). Loss of DDB1 results in enhanced p53 activity. This in turn may cause
  upregulation of p21 CIP1/WAF1 (cdkn1a), which again contributes to downregulation
  of ccnd and ccna in proliferating cells. As a result, the cell cycle is deregulated
  and the equilibrium shifted from proliferation to apoptosis. Whether DDB1 deficiency
  contributes to genome instability has not been analyzed in our study.
