caption: 'Lactose synthesis pathway in porcine mammary gland. Note: Glucose is taken
  up by the porcine mammary gland through membrane glucose transporters (possibly
  GLUT1). In the cytoplasm, after glucose is converted into glucose-6-phosphate, it
  will be further converted into UDP-galactose by a series of enzymes: PGM, UGP2,
  GALT, and GALE. Subsequently, glucose and UDP-galactose in the cytoplasm is transported
  into the Golgi bodies by GLUT1 (possibly) and SLC35A2, respectively. Finally, glucose
  and UDP-galactose are synthesized into lactose by LALBA and B4GALT1 in the Golgi
  bodies. After the initation of lactation, mRNA of enzymes is increased 2-fold or
  more are shown in light purple; those increasing 1.5-to1.9-fold are colored light
  red, and those expression increase or decrease less than 1.5-fold are shown in light
  gray. Abbreviation: GLUT1, glucose transporter-1; PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase;
  UGP2: UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2; GALT, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase;
  GALE, e UDP-glucose 4-epimerase gene; LALBA, alpha-lactalbumin gene; β-1,4-galactosyltransferase'
