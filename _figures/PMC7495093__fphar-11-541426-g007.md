caption: The pyroptosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) signaling and protective effect
  of SalB through the nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2)/NLR family
  pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) pathway. I/R and H/R trigger pyroptotic cell death
  signaling, including upregulation of thioredoxin-interacting protein-thioredoxin1
  (TXNIP) and suppression of Nrf2 expression, leads to NLRP3 oligomerization, ASC
  recruitment and subsequent caspase-1 activation. Fortunately, SalB treatment ameliorates
  AKI by regulating the Nrf2/NLRP3 pathway. The arrows represent promotion, while
  the inverted T represent inhibition. The effect of Salvianolic acid B (SalB) is
  shown in red.
