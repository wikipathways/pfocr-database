caption: (A) During homeostasis, basal stem/progenitor cells are only found in the
  trachea, where they maintain themselves by inducing Fgf10 expression in the tracheal
  stromal niche downstream of Yap. Ilk positively regulates the Hippo pathway in conducting
  airway epithelial cells to maintain their quiescence by inhibiting Yap-mediated
  activation of Fgf10 expression in ASMCs.(B) Hippo pathway inactivation in conducting
  non-cartilaginous airway epithelium in response to injury or by deleting Ilk (4)
  or Mst1/2 (5) results in nuclear Yap localization, increased epithelial Wnt7b expression
  and Fgf10 expression in ASMCs, which reciprocally breaks epithelial quiescence.
  The Fgf10-expressing basal stem cell niche extends into the non-cartilaginous airways
  allowing for BSC mobilization into the lower conducting airways upon airway epithelial
  Ilk deletion. Alternatively, Fgf10 released by the activated ASMC niche could drive
  the differentiation of LNEPs, which are scattered along the lower conducting airways,
  into the basal stem/progenitor cell lineage.
