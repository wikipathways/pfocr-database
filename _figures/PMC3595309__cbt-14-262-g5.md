caption: Figure 5. Schematic exhibition of the proposed signaling pathway modulated
  by CDH17 in gastric cancer cells. Coupling CDH17 activates the IKK complex, which
  subsequently phosphorylates the IκB-α. Then the phosphorylated IκB-α undergoes proteasome-dependent
  decomposition, which releases the heterodimers of p65/p50 into cytoplasm and transferred
  into the nucleus. Finally, the p65 binds to its responsive gene and promotes the
  transcription of downstream proteins including VEGF-C and MMP-9. On the other hand,
  RNAi mediated inhibition of CDH17 attenuates the activation of NFκB in gastric cancer
  cells, leading to a concomitant reduction in downstream proteins.
