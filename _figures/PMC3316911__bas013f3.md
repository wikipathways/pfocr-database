caption: The enhanced representation of UDP-d-xylose biosynthesis pathway in prototype
  P. trichocarpa PGDB. In this representation the sub-cellular localization of each
  metabolite in the pathway is specified by a two-letter prefix (). Note that  shows
  12 genes annotated as UDP-glucose dehydrogenases and 9 genes annotated as UDP-glucuronate
  decarboxylase. Manual curation yields only four UDP-glucose dehydrogenase enzymes
  and six UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase enzymes in Populus. Also note that genes encoding
  Golgi-localized membrane-bound UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (UXS) can now be
  distinguished from the same enzyme activity residing in the cytosol.
