caption: Pathways in immune cells that short-chain fatty acids generated by GM triggers.
  The interaction of short-chain fatty acids such as propionate, butyrate, and acetate
  with the host microbiome significantly affects intestinal immune responses. This
  interaction promotes the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs), enhances the
  activity of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, stimulates the production of
  anti-inflammatory cytokines, and supports the proliferation of plasma B cells and
  antibody generation. These processes occur through the inhibition of histone deacetylase
  (HDAC) and the activation of GPR109A and GPR43, resulting in anti-inflammatory outcomes
  and improved tolerance to microbial threats. This figure was generated using BioRender
  software version 04
