caption: 'Schematic representation depicting the role of KMO in MM (a) pDCs trigger
  growth, survival, and drug resistance in MM cells. Tryptophan pathway: tryptophan
  is degraded into kynurenine (KYN) (and downstream metabolites 3 hydroxykynurenine
  [3HK], 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid [3-HAA], and quinolinic acid [QA]). Tryptophan
  catabolic Kyn pathway is upregulated in MM, as evidenced by high KMO levels in MM
  cells and pDCs. Importantly, pDCs–MM interactions further upregulate KMO in MM cells,
  resulting in accumulation of terminal immunosuppressive metabolites mediating immunosuppression
  of MM-T and NK cells in the MM BM milieu. b Therapeutic potential of KMO as an immuno-metabolic
  target: treatment of MM-pDCs by KMO antagonists, either alone, or in combination
  with anti-PD-L1 Abs, generates anti-MM-specific CD8 + CTL activity, as well as enhances
  NK-cell-mediated anti-MM cell cytotoxicity'
