caption: 'Overview of the complement functions in the context of cancer. In a tumor
  context, the complement system may impact the immunity, angiogenesis and the phenotype
  of the tumor cells. Immunity: the same complement proteins may impact several immune
  cells positively or negatively depending of the model or cancer type. The pro-tumoral
  activity is mostly involved in the recruitment of immune cells and in the suppression
  of their anti-tumoral response. The anti-tumoral activity is linked to an improvement
  of the response to therapy and an increase in the immune cells infiltration. Angiogenesis:
  depending on the model, the complement proteins may promote or hamper tumor growth
  by favoring or inhibiting the neoangiogenesis. Tumor cells phenotype: by modulating
  the signaling pathways Erk1/2, AKT and PI3K the complement proteins stimulate tumor
  growth. In other models, the modulation of other signaling pathway (WWOX and FAS)
  by complement proteins favor the apoptosis of tumor cells. The figure is created
  with BioRender.com.'
