caption: 'Schematic representations of GA biosynthesis (A) and signal (B) pathways
  (; ; ). (A) GGDP, CDP, and cat represent geranylgeranyl diphosphate, ent-copalyl
  diphosphate, and catabolite, respectively. CPS, KS, KO, and KAO represent ent-copalyl
  diphosphate synthase, ent-kaurene synthase, ent-kaurene oxidase, and ent-kaurenoic
  acid oxidase, respectively. GA13ox, GA20ox, GA3ox, and GA2ox represent GA13-oxidases,
  GA20-oxidases, GA3-oxidases, and GA2-oxidases, respectively. CPS, KS, KO, KAO, GA13ox,
  GA20ox, and GA3ox are the key enzymes in GA biosynthetic pathway. GA2ox is GA deactivated
  enzyme. Enzymes locate in plastid, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosol using pink
  font, green font, and blue font, respectively. Bioactive metabolic products (GA1
  and GA4) use red font. The remaining metabolic products use black font. (B) When
  bioactive GAs are exhausted or limited, DELLAs (consisting of the following proteins:
  GA-INSENSITIVE, GAI; REPRESSOR OF GA1-3, RGA; RGA-LIKE1, RGL1; RGL2 and RGL3; GRAS-domain
  proteins) interact with transcription factors (TFs) inhibiting expression of corresponding
  downstream genes and therefore growth. When endogenous GA concentration is increased,
  a complex of GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1; the GA receptor)-GA-DELLA is formed. Then,
  the complex is recognized by the F-box proteins, leading to degradation of DELLA
  by ubiquitin-26S proteasome system and thus releasing the growth inhibition. GID1
  and DELLAs are the core components of GA signal pathway. The orange circles represent
  F-box proteins, such as SLEEPY1 (SLY1).'
