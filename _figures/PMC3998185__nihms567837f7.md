caption: Many of the known traits that promote metastatic seeding involve gene products
  (red) that the cancer cells express to amplify their own responsiveness to vital
  stromal cues. The cues that activate these pathways include receptor tyrosine kinase
  (RTK) growth factor ligands (GF), chemokines like CXCL12, and Wnt, and Notch ligands.
  Examples amplifiers include cell adhesion receptors like the VCAM1-Ezrin complex
  that is engaged by tumor leukocyte integrins; the tyrosine kinase Src that amplifies
  PI3K-AKT activation by CXCR4 and IGF1R (not shown); the cancer cell- and myofibroblast-derived
  ECM components tenascin C (TNC) and periostin that enhance Wnt access to their receptors
  (periostin) or amplify signaling by the Wnt and Notch pathways (TNC); and, the collagen
  crosslinking enzymes LOX and PLOD2 that stiffen the ECM for integrin/focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK) mediated amplification of RTK signaling. Various cancer cell-derived
  cytokines (bottom, red) provide additional support by recruiting stromal cells that
  secrete activators of AKT, MAPK and STAT3 in incipient metastatic lesions. MetSC-derived
  BMP blockers like Coco protect self-renewal by inhibiting Smad1 signaling.
