caption: Tumor promoting and suppressing pathways identified after ephrinB2–EphB4
  binding. (a) Tumor promoting pathways. EphrinB reverse signaling promotes invasiveness,
  epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration through STAT3, Src, RAC1 and
  MMP8 [,]. In endothelial cells, ephrinB2 reverse signaling regulates VEGFR2 internalization
  critical for angiogenesis []. Non phosphorylated ephrinB will block tight junction
  formation via PAR6 []. EphB forward signaling in tumors promotes survival via Myc
  and proliferation via Cyclin-D1 through multiple pathways [,,]. Migration can be
  enhanced through the Akt/PI3K NFkB pathway []. Other migratory pathways of EphBs
  include phosphorylation of RRAS and activation of RHOA [,]. (b) Tumor suppressing
  pathways. Endothelial ephrinB disturbs focal adhesion via GRB4 during reverse signaling
  [,]. Tight junctions are formed after PAR6 binding and trimerization with atypical
  PKC (aPKC) and CDC42 []. Constant regulatory feedback is imposed by Src []. Cytokine
  inhibition was found trough modulation of the CXCR4R pathway []. Forward singling
  in tumors involves the upregulation of the PI3K subunit p110 []. Abl activation
  was found to inhibit RAP1 and RAC1 [,,]. RRAS and HRAS are blocked after p120RASGAP
  activation []. RRAS and HRAS are also reduced by direct phosphorylation []. Internal
  calcium can be regulated by S100G which activates SOX17 and reduces proliferation
  []. Different MMPs are significantly upregulated when EphB4 is depleted []. Pathways
  identified in other celltypes but potentially active in endothelial and/or glioma
  cells are indicated with a dashed line.
