caption: 'Gene triplets reveal biological networks at different levels and key genes
  in those networks. A: The basic network structures for logic types 1 (c ↔ a ∧ b),
  3 (c ↔ a ∨ b), 5 (c ↔ a ∧~b), and 7 (c ↔ a ⊕ b); black dots represent chemical compounds.
  Type 5 means protein b may inhibit enzyme a or c. These structures can be applied
  locally to infer protein function, or on a larger scale to reveal protein network
  organization. B: An example illustrating the power of logic triplets to deduce the
  network of KDO2-lipidA synthesis []; dashed line represents a series of sequential
  steps catalyzed by different enzymes on different intermediate compounds. The pathway
  consists of three parts: i) CMP-KDO biosynthesis I in red; ii) lipid IVA biosynthesis
  in green; and iii) KDO transfer to lipid IVA I in blue. The listed logic triplets
  convincingly disclose the structure of the whole pathway, the order of enzymes,
  and even key proteins (in bold font). C: Logic triplets also reveal the interaction
  among different pathways in the whole cellular network. The upper diagram indicates
  that RNA-binding protein hfq regulates gene expression and protein secretion. The
  lower diagram illustrates the interaction among the major pathways in a cell. Numbers
  denote the type of logic relationships, and arrows point to the c genes in logic
  triplets.'
