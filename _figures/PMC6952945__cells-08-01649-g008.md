caption: A model for the PI5P-mediated regulation of Vav1 downstream signaling. Upon
  the SH2-mediated activation of Vav1 by upstream tyrosine kinases, the active Vav1
  molecules become stably associated with areas of the plasma membrane enriched in
  PI5P and, possibly, other mono-PIs. This favors both the optimal signaling output
  and the diversification activities of active Vav1 proteins, as the mono-PI-mediated
  regulation impacts more significantly in the levels of stimulation of the NFAT pathway.
  Specific icons used in the figure are explained in the blue inset. Other abbreviations
  have been described in the main text.
