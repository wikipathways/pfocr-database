caption: Current view of intestinal fructose metabolism in mice. Under conditions
  of low-dose dietary fructose (F) consumption, most of the fructose is metabolized
  by the Hers pathway appearing into portal circulation mainly as glucose (G), and
  the remaining as unmetabolized fructose. Conversely, under high-dose dietary fructose
  consumption, intestinal capacity is overwhelmed, leading to most of the fructose
  to spill over to the liver. Further work is needed to validate or refute this model
  in humans. G-6-Pase; glucose-6-phosphatase. This figure was created using Servier
  Medical Art.
