caption: Mitochondrial UPRmt and UPRam stress response pathways. (A) An accumulation
  of unfolded proteins inside the mitochondrial matrix triggers the UPRmt in both
  mammals and in nematodes. Accumulated proteins are likely processed by the CLPP
  protease and exported out of the mitochondria, a process that in C.elegans requires
  the HAF-1 protein. While under physiological conditions ATFS-1 gets imported into
  mitochondria and constitutively degraded by the AAA+-protease LON, exported peptides
  activate the transcription factor ATFS-1/ATF5 in the cytosol, which translocates
  to the nucleus to alter the cell's transcriptional program, particularly affecting
  the transcription of mitochondrial proteins. In C.elegans the UBL-5, LIN-65, and
  MET-2 proteins also translocate to the nucleus upon UPRmt activation where they
  facilitate the binding of transcription factors, ATFS-1 and DVE-1, by chromatin
  remodeling. A second UPRmtpathway has also been observed in mammals, whereby UPRmt
  activation is sensed by the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein MAVS by an
  unknown mechanism, which then triggers the activation of PKR, which in turn phosphorylates
  the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, JNK. JNK activates c-jun (also by an unknown mechanism),
  which translocates to the nucleus and, together with AP-1, alters gene transcription.
  The bZIP transcription factor AFT4 has also been linked to mitochondrial stress
  response pathways. Localized to the nucleus, ATF4 activates a complex cytoprotective
  transcriptional program, e.g., by transcriptional control of ATF5. (B) In lower
  eukaryotes, the accumulation of cytosolic precursors from either a block in mitochondrial
  import, from mislocalization, or from retrotranslocation out of the mitochondrial
  intermembrane space, can instigate the UPRam. This accumulation enhances activity
  of the Irc25/Poc4 chaperone complex, which is required for assembly of the proteasome.
  Increased proteasome assembly causes the rapid degradation of accumulated proteins.
  In an independent stress response mechanism observed in mammals, there is a decrease
  in cytosolic translation, which is coupled to increased proteasome activity, but
  the molecular mechanisms underlying this response remain to be defined.
