caption: (A) Human induced pluripotent-derived neurons (hiPSC-Ns) and (B) induced
  neurons (iNs). (A) Human primary fibroblasts, or other somatic primary cell source
  from living or deceased subjects, are (1) reprogrammed back to the fetal state into
  hiPSCs through the introduction of defined transcription factors, (2) induction
  of the neural fate is achieved through dual SMAD signaling inhibition, resulting
  in neural stem cells (NSCs) and (3) neurons are differentiated with the aid of neurotrophic
  factors in addition to other small molecules. hiPSC-Ns capture a unique patient’s
  genome in a dish and can recapitulate many factors in neurodegenerative disease
  processes, especially those with a genetic driver. Other CNS cell types can be generated
  this in-vitro technology as well; hiPSCs can be differentiated into microglia by
  driving towards a hematopoietic lineage with small molecules, and NSCs can give
  rise to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. (B) The same starting fibroblast cells
  can be directly converted to iNs by the introduction of neuronal-specific transcription
  factors and small molecule cocktails that include SMAD pathway inhibitors and cell
  cycle blockers. Cells undergoing direct conversion to iNs bypass the pluripotent
  fetal state and may retain more of the epigenetic signature of the starting donor
  cells, rendering them to more likely represent phenotypes which may occur with cellular
  age.
