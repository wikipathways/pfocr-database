caption: IL-10 signaling leads to the production of numerous gene products (indicated
  in red) that are capable of suppressing TLR- and IFNγ-signaling in a variety of
  ways. A. The binding of PAMPs to cell-surface (or intracellular) TLR initiates both
  MyD88-dependent and independent signaling cascades. Activation of the MyD88-dependent
  pathway leads to the activation of TRAF6 which in turn activates the MAPK pathway
  (p38, JNK and ERK MAP kinases), the PI3K/Akt pathway, and the NFκB pathway that
  lead to nuclear translocation of transcription factors and expression of TLR-stimulated
  genes. IL-10 signaling leads to STAT3-dependent transcription of miR146b, SOCS1/3,
  SHIP1, DUSP1, and AMP kinase that interfere with TLR signaling in various ways.
  miR-146b suppresses expression of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK1/4, and TRAF6 proteins while
  SOCS1, DUSP1, and SHIP1 suppress the activities of IRAK1/4, p38, and PI3K, respectively.
  AMP kinase interferes with NFκB signaling by inhibiting the degradation of the NFκB
  inhibitor IκB. SHIP1 also suppresses MyD88-independent TLR activation by suppressing
  TBK1 phosphorylation. IL-10 dependent expression of miR-187 and TTP can affect APC
  function by suppressing expression of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α. B.
  The binding of IFNγ to IFNγ-receptor on monocytes/macrophages leads to STAT1-phosphorylation,
  nuclear translocation of active STAT1 homodimers, and STAT1 binding to gamma-activated
  sequences (GAS) on IFNγ-target genes. IL-10-signaling leads to the production of
  SOCS3 that suppresses Jak2-dependent activation of STAT1 in IFNγ-signaled APCs.
