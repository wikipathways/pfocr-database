caption: Small RNAs regulate transgenerational inheritance of behaviors triggered
  by previous microbial experience in C. elegans. Neuron to-gut to-germline signaling
  is essential to induce the transmission of the memory of previous microbial encounters.
  Sensory neurons perceive bacterial metabolites through GPCRs, modulating the DAF-7/TFG-β
  signaling pathway. Neuronal RDE-4 is necessary for sRNA production involved in transgenerational
  control of behavior. Neuronal sRNAs (blue) are transferred into germ cells through
  the dsRNA transporter SID-1 to induce transgenerational silencing. It is still unknown
  how these neuronally-derived sRNAs are secreted into the worms’ body. Sensory neurons
  (light blue) and neurons adjacent to the intestine (enteric; purple) control intestinal
  immunity against pathogens. Whether intestinal responses triggered by bacteria drive
  sRNAs changes is not known. Bacterial (pink) and host (black) sRNAs are transported
  from the lumen to the intestine through SID-2 and systemically through SID-1. RME-2
  mediates the endocytosis of sRNAs from the worms’ cavity to oocytes. The RNAi machinery
  amplifies sRNAs causing transgenerational silencing. In the germline, the Piwi protein
  PRG-1, the RNA helicase RRF-1, and the nuclear Argonaute HDRE-1 are essential for
  driving transgenerational changes by epigenetic modulation. The transmission of
  epigenetic information between intestine and germ cells is mediated by the transcriptional
  regulation of F08F1.3. Mechanical changes in the intestine triggered by bacterial
  colonization may induce intergenerational histone acetylation in the germline.
