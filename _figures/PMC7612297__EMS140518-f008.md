caption: 'a, During vascular development blood flow acts on EC forming DA to promote
  glucose utilization through the oxidative branch of PPP (oxidative PPP: oxPPP).
  PPP metabolism produces R5P which is important for EC viability and elastin synthesis.
  Elastin is then deposited into ECM and drives vMC recruitment and/or differentiation
  around the DA of developing animals. In oxPPP blockade conditions, this mechanism
  is impaired leading to a vascular phenotype characterized by a “naked” and immature
  DA.'
