caption: Proposed schematic diagram of capsaicin‐mediated suppression of hepatocellular
  carcinoma. Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) abundantly express both SIRT1 and SOX2
  in their nuclei. SOX2 is an important regulator in maintaining the stemness of HPCs
  and is regulated via deacetylation by SIRT1. After capsaicin treatment, SIRT1 undergoes
  ubiquitin‐mediated degradation, and subsequently acetylated SOX2 is then transported
  from the nucleus to the cytosol, where it is also degraded by ubiquitination
