caption: ADH1C is a member of alcohol dehydrogenase system. Overexpression of ADH1C
  significantly reduced expression of PHGDH or PSAT1 mRNA and protein in CRC cell
  lines. Overexpression of ADH1C also reduced serine level in CRC cell lines. Knockdown
  of PHGDH or PSAT1 expression reduced serine level in CRC cell lines. Serine serves
  as precursor for cellular glycine and one-carbon metabolism, which was associated
  with functional roles of cancer cells. Overexpression of ADH1C inhibited proliferation,
  migration and invasion, colony formation of CRC cells by reducing expression of
  PHGDH or PSAT1, then serine level in CRC cells, which can be reversed by adding
  exogenous serine into culture medium. All in all, ADH1C inhibits progression of
  CRC by PHGDH or PSAT1/Serine metabolic pathway
