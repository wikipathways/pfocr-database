caption: 'Model of PTEN- and IPMK-mediated nuclear phosphoinositide signaling through
  SF-1. A: IPMK is a nuclear protein conserved in all eukaryotes () that was first
  characterized functionally as a transcriptional coregulator (, ) before the inositol
  kinase enzyme activity was discovered (). B: Shortly thereafter, Adam Resnick in
  Solomon Synder’s laboratory discovered that IPMK also has a PI3-kinase enzyme activity,
  with the ability to phosphorylate PI(4,5)P2 in membrane systems (), confirmed to
  occur in vivo in mouse models (). IPMK is a close structural homolog to the IP3-kinase
  superfamily and protein kinase A (), but is structurally unrelated to the class
  1 PI3-kinases. C: IPMK was then shown to bind and directly phosphorylate PI(4,5,)P2
  bound to the nuclear receptor SF-1, generating PI(3,4,5)P3 bound to SF-1 resulting
  in robust activation of SF-1 transcriptional programs in human cell lines (). Nuclear
  PTEN opposes this function of IPMK, dephosphorylating PIP3 bound to SF-1 and downregulating
  SF-1 transcriptional activity (). This nuclear phosphoinositide signaling pathway
  is the first described in which the structural biology and mechanistic enzymology
  fully describe the mechanism of the signal transduction, which is extremely important
  in drug design efforts that could impact the clinic.'
