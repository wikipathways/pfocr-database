caption: 'Model of comfrey’s mode of action by interference with the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. IL-1β binding to its receptor (IL-1 R) recruits an accessory protein (IL-1
  RAcP) to activate a downstream signaling cascade involving MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6.
  Of central importance is the activation of the IKK complex consisting of IKK-1,
  -2, and NEMO/IKKγ, which triggers the degradation of the main NF-κB inhibitor IκBα
  through phosphorylation (P) and ubiquitination (Ub). Liberation from IκBα enables
  NF-κB (depicted as a p50/p65 heterodimer) to translocate to the nucleus. Here, NF-κB
  can be modified further (post-translational modifications, PTMs) and interact with
  a variety of cofactors such as histone modifying proteins that modulate its transactivation
  potential. Based on our studies, the hydroalcoholic extract of comfrey root, as
  well as the mucilage-depleted fraction thereof, interfere at two points with this
  signaling cascade as indicated: first, IκBα phosphorylation and its subsequent degradation
  are delayed and second, transactivation of nuclear p65 becomes impaired. Together,
  this results in the alteration of pro-inflammatory gene expression, thus attenuating
  the further development of a pro-inflammatory scenario.'
