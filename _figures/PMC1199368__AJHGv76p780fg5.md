caption: Candidate genes that are involved with the metabolism of androgen and estrogen.
  The androgen portion of the pathway is within the broken line, and the estrogen
  pathway is outside of the broken line, at the bottom of the figure. The measured
  SNPs are indicated within boxes, with their corresponding genes labeled and the
  SNPs numbered below each gene. Other genes and enzymes that are part of the pathway
  are also illustrated, emphasizing that the measured SNPs are for genes whose products
  act at different steps of androgen and estrogen biosynthesis.
