caption: A depiction of the PIP2-mediated signaling pathway on the regulated exocytosis
  of MMP-9 in MCF-7 cells. Illustration shows a step associated with dynamic cascade
  of PIP2 formation and subsequent breakdown, and the lipid kinases and protein kinases
  associated with exocytic sites
papertitle: Imaging the rapid yet transient accumulation of regulatory lipids, lipid
  kinases, and protein kinases during membrane fusion, at sites of exocytosis of MMP-9
  in MCF-7 cells.
