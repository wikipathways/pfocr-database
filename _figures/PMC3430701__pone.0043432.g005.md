caption: The Calvin cycle-pentose phosphate superpathway of carbon metabolism in Prochlorococcus.
  For each gene, the mRNA and protein timecourse data (and sinusoidal fits to them)
  are shown. The values of the phase and amplitude of oscillations at both expression
  levels are given in . Genes for which timecourses are not shown were either not
  detected in the proteome or not measurably oscillating in our experiment; note that
  cbbA, glpX and tktA catalyze multiple reactions. The Calvin cycle consumes CO2 and
  trades reducing power for fixed carbon, while the pentose phosphate pathway does
  the reverse; reactions in the shared intersection reverse direction depending on
  the net metabolic flux. The Calvin cycle is the dominant pathway in the light period,
  when photosynthesis supplies NADPH for carbon fixation. Calvin cycle genes peak
  near dawn at the mRNA level, and near midday at the protein level. The pentose phosphate
  pathway is dominant at night, when stores of carbon fixed during the day are respired.
  Transcripts of pentose phosphate pathway genes peak in the late afternoon, and their
  proteins after sunset. Genes of the shared intersection show cycling parameters
  akin to those of the Calvin cycle. For all genes of this superpathway, however,
  the amplitudes of protein abundance oscillation are much smaller than those of the
  corresponding mRNA, implying that this redirection of the net flow in this superpathway
  between light and dark periods is controlled by small changes in protein abundance
  and posttranslational regulation. Pathway schematic redrawn after .
