caption: Transcriptomic analysis of the biosynthetic pathway of quercetin and derivatives
  from sweet pepper fruits. On the left, a heatmap indicating the differentially expressed
  genes depending on the ripening stage of pepper fruits (red (PR) vs. green (PV))
  is depicted with FDR ≤ 0.05. On the right, a heatmap indicating the differentially
  expressed genes depending on the NO treatment of pepper fruits (treated (PE + NO)
  vs. untreated (PE − NO)) is depicted with FDR ≤ 0.05. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase;
  C4H, trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone
  synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-dioxygenase; F3′5′H, flavanoid
  3′,5′-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-monooxygenase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase;
  ANS, leucocyanidin dioxygenase; FLS, flavonol synthase; 3GT, flavonol 3-o-glucosyltransferase;
  FGT, flavonol-3-O-glucoside L-rhamnosyltransferase; UGT, UDP-glycosyltransferase.
  Asterisks indicate genes which are differentially expressed in the experimental
  conditions.
