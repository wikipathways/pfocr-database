caption: miRNA–gene–pathway regulatory networks. a shows the network for five pathways
  related to tumor invasion and metastasis. b shows the network for the MAPK signalling
  pathway. c shows the network for two new pathways, which have not been previously
  associated with cancer. MiRNAs, genes, and pathways are represented by nodes (pink
  miRNAs; green genes; and blue pathways). Edges of dark color represent the relationship
  between genes and pathways; and edges of light color represent the relationship
  between miRNAs and genes. Nodes marked with a red asterisk refer to genes uniquely
  regulated by one specific miRNA.
