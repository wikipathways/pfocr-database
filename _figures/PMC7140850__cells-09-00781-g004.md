caption: Upregulation of calcium signaling and cell growth events in MCs by ES. (A)
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showing the top three, particularly
  Ca2+-mediated signaling pathway, identified with a high number of genes changed
  upon ES-treatment (showed as numbers on the bars). (B) Schematic summary of ES-induced
  signaling pathway changes as shown by KEGG pathway analysis of all DEGs showing
  significant upregulation of the calcium signaling pathway and cell growth while
  inhibition of NFATc pathway with overlaid predictions. Orange lines predict activation
  and blue lines indicate inhibition of the downstream signal.
