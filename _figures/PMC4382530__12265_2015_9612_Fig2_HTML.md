caption: Pathways in recipient-derived immune response. Primary event is the recognition
  of allo-antigens by T-lymphocytes via one of the indicated pathways. The direct
  pathway is activated by the recognition of MHC complexes with a foreign HLA-antigen
  (red) presented by donor APCs (red). The indirect pathway is activated when T-lymphocytes
  recognize processed allo-antigens presented by recipient APCs (green). The semi-direct
  pathway is activated when T-lymphocytes recognize allo-antigens presented on donor
  MHC on recipient APCs. In addition, non-HLA antigens might be involved, which are
  bound by “auto-antibodies”. This will lead to complement activation and T-lymphocyte
  activation. Activation of B-cells can be initiated by donor DCs and donor T-lymphocytes.
  All of the indicated pathways lead to activation of T-lymphocytes, which start to
  secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ. The secretion of IFN-γ recruits
  more immune cells, such as NK-cells and macrophages, and acts on SMCs. The proliferation
  of SMCs will ultimately result in proliferation of the intima and occlusion of the
  artery, which are the characteristics of CAV
