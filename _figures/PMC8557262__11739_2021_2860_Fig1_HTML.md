caption: 'Impairment of the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection by
  early glucocorticoid therapy. At the top of the figure (blue part), the physiological
  innate immune response to viral infection (SARS-CoV-2) is summarized. Infected cells
  as well as macrophages and dendritic cells recognize the viral single-stranded RNA
  mainly through intracellular TLR7, inducing the transcription and subsequent secretion
  of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN-I). They enhance antigen presentation
  and activate the adaptive immune system (antibody production, increased effector
  T-cell responses, production of type II interferon by activated T-cells and natural
  killer cells, etc.), counteracting viral replication. At the bottom of the figure
  (red part), the possible negative effects of early glucocorticoid therapy on immune
  response is described. Glucocorticoid therapy inhibits pro-inflammatory (IL-6 and
  IL-8) and antiviral (IFN-I) cytokine production and signaling pathway, decreasing
  the expression of the interferon-stimulated genes, suppress antigen-stimulated inflammation
  mediated by macrophages and dendritic cells. Glucocorticoid therapy also induces
  lymphopenia or can worsen a preexisting lymphopenia, hindering the T-lymphocyte
  immunity. Moreover, it can further downregulate membrane-bound angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2). All these actions may contribute to viral replication and more
  severe lung injury. ACE2: angiotensin converting enzyme 2; TLR7: toll-like receptor
