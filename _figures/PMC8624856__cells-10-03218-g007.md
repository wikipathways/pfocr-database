caption: Chemical inhibitors that reduce JCPyV infection in NHAs, SVGAs, and NHA-Ts.
  Previous research has demonstrated the importance of the MAPK/ERK pathway in NHAs;
  however, JCPyV can also use the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway for infection (left).
  Using chemical inhibitors targeting PI3K, AKT, and mTOR significantly reduced JCPyV
  infection in primary astrocytes (left). However, in immortalized cells, SVGAs and
  NHA-Ts, these chemical inhibitors did not reduce JCPyV infection and treatment of
  cells with U0126—an MEK inhibitor of the MAPK/ERK pathway—which significantly reduced
  JCPyV infection (right). This demonstrates that during the viral infection of immortalized
  cells, JCPyV is more dependent on the MAPK/ERK pathway and may not use other pathways,
  such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, to establish successful infection,
  compared to JCPyV infection in primary astrocytes.
