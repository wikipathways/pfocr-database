caption: LRP1-mediated Aβ clearance pathways. Aβ is predominantly generated in neurons
  and secreted into ISF. Proteolytic degradation by endopeptidases (e.g., neprilysin,
  insulin-degrading enzyme) comprises a major Aβ clearance pathway. Cellular Aβ clearance
  also plays a critical role in eliminating Aβ from the brain, where LRP1 significantly
  regulates its endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation. LRP1 is expressed
  in several different brain cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, microglia,
  endothelial cells, and vascular mural cells (vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes).
  In brain parenchyma, neurons, astrocytes, and microglia can take up and degrade
  Aβ mainly in lysosomes. ISF is drained along the cerebrovasculature, where Aβ is
  degraded by vascular cells. A portion of Aβ may be transported out of the brain
  through the BBB. Disturbances of these pathways induce Aβ accumulation and deposition
  as amyloid plaques in brain parenchyma, perivascular regions as CAA and sometimes
  also inside neurons and intraneuronal Aβ.
