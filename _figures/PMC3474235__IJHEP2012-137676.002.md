caption: 'Scheme of the various interactions between GSTs and MAPK implicated in stress-signaling
  pathway (adapted from []). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family is
  composed of three types of kinases: MAP3K, MAP2K, and MAPK. In mammal, 3 major subgroups
  of MAPK are found: ERK, JNK, and p38. ERK is activated by proliferation and differentiation
  stimuli whereas JNK and p38 are preferentially activated by environmental stress.
  Upstream kinases (MAP3K, MAP2K) initiate activation of MAPK cascade in response
  to environmental changes and MAPK phosphorylate downstream targets such as transcription
  factors and generate appropriate biological response. Several GSTs are able to interact
  with various of these MAPK in nonstress conditions. Environmental stress leads to
  the disruption of these interactions and the activation of the signaling pathway.
  ROS: reactive oxygen species; UV: ultraviolet; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; TRAF2;
  TNF-receptor-associated factor 2; ASK1: apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; MEKK1:Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase1; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1; ERK: extracellular
  regulated kinase.'
