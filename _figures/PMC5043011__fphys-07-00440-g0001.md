caption: The CaSR in normal lactation. Activation of the CaSR in the lactating breast
  promotes trans-epithelial calcium transport into milk by increasing the activity
  of the calcium pump, PMCA2. In addition, activation of the CaSR suppresses PTHrP
  release into milk and into the systemic circulation. Circulating PTHrP acts on osteoblasts
  (Ob) to increase osteoclast (Oc) development and activity through the RANK/RANKL
  pathway. This, in turn, stimulates bone resorption and liberates skeletal calcium
  stores. PTHrP also acts on the kidney to stimulate calcium reabsorption. If serum
  calcium is decreased, the CaSR decreases calcium transport into milk to decrease
  calcium utilization and increases PTHrP secretion into the maternal circulation
  to increase the supply of calcium from skeletal stores. In this way, the CaSR helps
  to maintain a steady supply of calcium for milk production and protects the mother
  from hypocalcemia if dietary calcium become limiting.
