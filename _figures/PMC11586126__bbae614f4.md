  (A) glutamate receptor signaling pathway and (B) axon guidance signaling pathway.
  Simplified to highlight CLAC-associated genes. (C) Genomic region containing ROBO1
  and ROBO2. CLACs are highlighted with green arrows and bars. Peaks of ChIP-seq and
  ATAC-seq overlapping CLACs and transcription factor binding motifs (colored stars
  matching panel D) were displayed. (D) Enriched motifs in noncoding CLACs, which
  assemble binding motifs of transcription factors. (E) Enrichment of noncoding CLACs
  with reported epigenetic markers
