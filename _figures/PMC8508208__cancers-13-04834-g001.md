caption: Key metabolic pathways in PDAC cells. Glucose, the intracellular abundance
  of which is increased by Kras-mediated GLUT1 upregulation, is a key metabolic and
  biosynthetic fuel usually oxidised in the mitochondria to produce ATP. However,
  while some mitochondrial oxidation of glucose does occur in cancer cells, proportionally
  higher levels are diverted from this pathway to be utilised in biosynthetic reactions
  to produce hexosamine (used in protein glycosylation) and ribose-6-phosphate (used
  in nucleotide synthesis). Cancer cells also show a greater dependency on glycolytic
  ATP generation with upregulation of this pathway in PDAC mediated both by oncogenic
  signalling via the Kras pathway and hypoxic conditions resulting from hypovascularity.
  Cancer cells also demonstrate an enhanced use of glutamine, which is vital in cellular
  proliferation due to its use in ATP generation and the production of NADPH and glutathione
  to maintain cellular redox balance. Nutrient deprivation in PDAC due to hypovascularity
  also alters cellular metabolism, evoking a requirement for alternative nutrient
  sources to be found. These include recycling of cellular components through autophagy
  and nucleotide salvage, as well as scavenging pathways such as macropinocytosis
  in which large vacuoles non-specifically engulf extracellular space to obtain proteins,
  lipids, and nucleotides.
