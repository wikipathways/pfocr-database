caption: Resting glucose metabolism of juvenile pyramidal cells and its alterations
  in 3xTg-AD mice. Glucose uptake is facilitated via glucose transporters (GluT).
  Once in the cytoplasm glucose phosphorylation by Hexokinase1 (HK1) yields to glucose
  6-phosphate (G6P), the common substrate of different metabolic pathways. Glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PDH) is the rate limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway
  leading to ribose-5-phosphate (R5P). Pentose phosphate pathway is blocked by the
  G6PDH inhibitor, 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN). G6P can also be isomerized into fructose-6-phosphate
  (F6P), a common intermediate of the glycolysis and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway.
  Glycolysis is blocked by Iodoacetic acid (IAA) inhibiting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G3PDH). Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), the
  rate limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, converts fructose-6-phosphate
  and glutamine into glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) and glutamate (glutamine and
  glutamate are omitted for the sake of simplicity). G6P is also the precursor of
  glycogen whose synthesis is normally absent in neurons (gray arrow). Dashed arrows
  indicate multisteps reactions. Functional changes in 3xTg-AD neurons are depicted
  by red arrows. Thicker and thinner arrows denote increased and decreased pathways,
  respectively.
