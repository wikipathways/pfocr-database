  ARF8, and ARF17 and their regulatory microRNAs interact in a complex network ()
  and act upstream of GH3.3, GH3.5, and GH3.6. ARF6 and ARF8 are positive regulators
  of the three GH3s, whereas ARF17 is a negative regulator. GH3.3, GH3.5, and GH3.6
  control each other’s expression through a pathway yet to be identified. The three
  GH3 genes control  homeostasis. The -Ile level in the hypocotyl is determined by
  the  level. The level of -Ile negatively regulates adventitious rooting through
  the activation of the COI1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, auxin controls adventitious
  root initiation through the activation of ARF6 and ARF8 proteins, leading to a downregulation
  of the inhibiting COI1 signaling pathway.'
