caption: Role of PI3K /Akt in COPD regulation. The activation of PI3K/Akt is involved
  in COPD formation and can exacerbate COPD progression through inflammatory and oxidative
  stress. Specifically, activated PI3K/Akt promotes the release of ROS, as well as
  promotes the secretion of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines by alveolar macrophages,
  neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, and epithelial cells to participate in COPD pathogenesis.
  Moreover, small molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway can
  treat COPD through inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation.
