caption: Pathophysiology of OA related to p38MAPK. Aggrecan and collagen (purple box)
  are major components of cartilage. They are able to decomposed by a disintegrin-like
  and metalloproteinase with the thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) and matrix metalloproteinase
  (MMP) (red box) respectively. P38MAPK can induce expressions of MMP. IL-β and TNF-α
  (blue box) are always at a high level in cartilage of OA Patients. P38MAPK is also
  involved in this process.
