caption: Representation of ADAR2-mediated RNA editing and its action in regulating
  the IGF system in cancer. A-to-I RNA editing of IGFBP7 mRNA guided by ADAR2 leads
  to increased production of a full-length edited IGFBP7 protein, which is resistant
  to proteolysis. Secreted IGFBP7 binds IGF1R, thus inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway
  and inducing apoptosis.
