caption: Schematic of the major pathways by which cerebral glutamate (Glu) and glutamine
  (Gln) levels are affected in urea cycle disorders (a) and hypothesis for HI/HA syndrome
  (b) related to increased activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Relative changes
  in pool size of cerebral metabolites (α-ketoglutarate, ammonia, glutamate, and glutamine)
  between different conditions are indicated by differences in font size. In (a) ammonia
  (NH3) levels are primarily increased, and they drive the condensation reaction with
  glutamate to produce glutamine by glutamine synthetase; the α-ketoglutarate -glutamate-glutamine
  pathway is shifted towards to the right. In (b) we hypothesize that in HI/HA, the
  activating mutations in the GDH enzyme drive the deamination of glutamate to produce
  ammonia and α-ketoglutarate; thus, the αketoglutarate-glutamate-glutamine pathway
  is driven towards the left, and there is no accumulation of glutamine. (a) adapted
  from []). HA, hyperammonemia; HI, hyperinsulinism.
