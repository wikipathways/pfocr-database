caption: Pathways of DMSP biosynthesis in higher plants and marine algae (adapted
  from []). a Compositae pathway (described in Wollastonia biflora, in blue). b Gramineae
  pathway (described in Spartina alterniflora, in blue/red). c Marine algal pathway
  (described in Ulva intestinalis, in green). d Methyl cycle and the enzymes involved
  in methionine biosynthesis. Dimethylsulphonio-2-hydroxybutyrate (DMSHB); dimethylsulphoniopropionate
  (DMSP); DMSP-aldehyde (DMSP-ald); 4-methylthio-2-hydroxybutyrate (MTHB); 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutanoate
  (MTOB); S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH); S-adenosylmethione (SAM); S-methylmethionine
  (SMM). Enzyme types and associated cofactors are shown in italics (refer to Table  for
  the enzyme names)
