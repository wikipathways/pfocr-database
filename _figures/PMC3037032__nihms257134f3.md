caption: Methylation of histone H3K36 in the body of actively transcribed genes (see
  ) can be bound by the chromodomain-containing protein, Eaf3, as part of the Rpd3S
  deacetylase complex. This process helps to reposition nucleosomes in the wake of
  transcribing RNA Pol II. In the absence of Rpd3S, nucleosomes are misplaced, resulting
  in the exposure of cryptic start sites that can lead to the formation of aberrant
  transcription. Thus, recruitment of Rpd3S by a histone modification placed by passing
  RNA polymerase complexes can maintain transcriptional fidelity. However, at most
  genes, Rpd3S can be recruited directly through the interaction with the Serine 5
  phosphorylated form of the RNA Pol II CTD (, F. Robert, unpublished data). These
  findings indicate that the relative contribution of H3K36 methylation and CTD phosphorylation
  on the recruitment of Rpd3S can be gene specific and context dependent.
