caption: Changes in transcript abundance of genes involved in central metabolic pathways
  and antioxidant system when Schizochytrium sp. HX-308 was cultured with high oxygen
  supply condition. a Transcriptional regulation of the central carbon metabolic pathways,
  including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. b
  Transcriptional regulation of the antioxidant defense system. Key enzymes are included
  in the map and presented as their names. Gene fold changes as indicated by color
  boxes. Glycolysis; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; EMP, Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway; HK,
  hexokinase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; FBA, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase; PYC,
  pyruvate carboxylase; PK, pyruvate kinase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; CS, citrate
  synthase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; FUM, fumarate hydratase; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase;
  ME, malic enzyme; ACL, citrate lyase; KGDC, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase; SDH, succinate
  dehydrogenase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; CAT, catalase; APX, ascorbate peroxidase;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; GSH-Px, glutathione peroxidase
