caption: Networks top-ranked by Ingenuity Pathway analysis after knockdown of TP53
  (A) and LSR1+TP53 (B). Coloured genes are upregulated (yellow) or downregulated
  (blue) more than 2-fold. "Focus genes" (bold) were defined as genes with a mean
  log ratio of ≥ |1| compared to mock transfected cells. The horizontal lines separate
  different cellular compartments.
