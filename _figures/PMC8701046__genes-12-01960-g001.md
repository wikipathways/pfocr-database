  end-joining (NHEJ) is the predominant DSB repair pathway in G1 phase, but also operates

  DNA repair/replication factors. (D) Homologous Recombination (HR) is limited by

  cycle after DNA replication generates homologous sister chromatids. Initially, DSB
  ends are resected, and the resulting 3′ ssDNA overhangs are bound by Replication
  Protein A (RPA). RPA is subsequently replaced by the RAD51 recombinase, leading
  to the formation of a RAD51 nucleo-protein filament. RAD51 recruitment to ssDNA
  is mediated by BARD1, BRCA1, PALB2, and BRCA2 proteins and stabilization of RAD51
  filaments is promoted by BRDX2, CX3, and Shu complexes (see protein composition
  of complexes in box (E)). Stable RAD51 filaments search for homologous sequences
  in the sister chromatid, and subsequent strand invasion into the homologous sister
  chromatid and D-loop formation are fundamental steps before enabling DNA repair
  synthesis. After DNA synthesis, two sub-pathways of HR can be employed. During Double-strand
  break repair (DSBR), DNA repair synthesis promotes D-loop extension and second end
  capture, resulting in double Holiday Junctions (dHJ), which are either dissolved
  or resolved by specialized enzymes, resulting in either non-crossing-over or crossing-over
  products, respectively. In the case of the second HR sub-pathway, called synthesis-dependent
  strand annealing (SDSA), nascent DNA is displaced from the D-loop and anneals with
  the second end of the DSB, resulting in non-crossing-over products. In the case
  of a broken replication fork, if a second DSB end is not available, break-induced
  replication (BIR) can occur, using the intact sister chromatid as a template. (E)
