caption: Schematic representation of CRP-dependent (A) and CcpA-dependent (B) carbon
  catabolite repression pathways and the Ntr regulatory pathway (C). (A and B) Shown
  on the left-hand side is PTS-mediated glucose uptake in the model organisms E. coli
  and B. subtilis, respectively. The phospho-carrier protein HPr is phosphorylated
  at the catalytic histidine residue by enzyme EI at the expense of phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP). The phosphoryl group is then transferred to EIIA, which is a cytoplasmic
  protein in E. coli (A) or part of the multidomain complex EIIABC in B. subtilis
  (B). From EIIA, the phosphoryl group is transferred to EIIB, a soluble domain attached
  to the integral membrane transporter domain EIIC. The glucose molecule is transported
  into the cell and at the same time phosphorylated by EIIB, yielding glucose-6-phosphate
  in the cell. Shown on the right-hand side is transcriptional regulator-mediated
  CCR. The transcriptional regulators CRP (A) and CcpA (B) are indicated by a dark
  background, and the PTS components involved, EIIA and HPr in panels A and B, respectively,
  are indicated by a white background. In E. coli (A), the degree of phosphorylation
  of EIIA determines the activity of adenylate cyclase (AC) and, consequently, the
  concentration of cAMP in the cell. Binding of cAMP to CRP results in a complex that
  stimulates transcription of target genes (positive regulation). In B. subtilis (B),
  fructose-1,6-phosphate produced from glucose-6-phosphate in glycolysis activates
  HPrK that phosphorylates HPr at the regulatory-site serine at the expense of ATP
  or PPi. Binding of HPr-Ser-P to CcpA results in acomplex that inhibits the transcription
  of target genes (negative regulation). The HPr molecule in HPr-mediated signal transduction
  is the same as the HPr involved in glucose uptake. In Crh-mediated signal transduction,
  the HPr molecule is not part of the uptake system and is termed Crh. (C) Phosphoryl
  group transfer chain in the nitrogen regulation pathway Ntr. The HPr-like protein
  NPr is phosphorylated by enzyme INtr at the expense of phosphoenolpyruvate, after
  which the phosphoryl group is transferred to EIIANtr. The pathway is thought to
  operate independently of the PTS sugar uptake pathway.
