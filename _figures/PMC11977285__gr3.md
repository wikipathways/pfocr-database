caption: 'Extracellular vesicles (EVs) in mitigating MASLD. The figure shows the possible
  mechanism in different studies exploring the role of exosomes isolated from different
  sources in treatment of MASLD. (a) Brown adipose tissue (BAT)-derived exosomes have
  shown direct effect in MASLD by lowing lipid accumulation. And these exosomes using
  ADRB3 activation cause browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). (b) WAT-derived exosomes
  induce M2 macrophage polarization and increase Arg-1 and IL-10 expressions mediated
  by STAT3. (c) Adipose EVs carry lncRNA H19 that regulates HGF/c-MET pathway to mitigate
  MASLD. (d) Human umbilical cord MSC EVs inhibit Foxg1 by carrying miR-124 and ameliorate
  MASLD. (e) Plant-derived exosomes like nanoparticles can reduce inflammation, ROS,
  fatty acid synthesis, and insulin resistance and improve MASLD. Abbreviations: ADRB3,
  beta-3-adrenergic receptor; Arg-1, arginase-1; Foxg1, forkhead box g1; HGF, hepatocyte
  growth factor; IL-10, interleukin-10; MASLD, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic
  liver disease; MSC, mesenchymal stem cell; ROS, reactive oxygen species; STAT3,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3'
