caption: Schematic of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in intracellular
  viral sensing and downstream signaling. TLR-3/7/8/9, RIG-I, and MDA5 are ds- or
  ssRNA-sensing proteins, whereas cGAS is a dsDNA-sensing protein. These PRRs culminate
  in the recruitment and phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs).
  Activated IRFs translocate to the nucleus and bind IFN-stimulated response elements
  (ISRE) that induce transcription of type I interferons (IFNs) and select IFN-stimulated
  genes (ISGs). Released type I IFN binds to IFN-αβ receptors (IFNAR) and induces
  the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. JAK-Tyk2 kinases dimerize, and the activated form
  phosphorylates signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT).
  IRF9 is recruited to this complex and nuclearly translocates, inducing the expression
  of ISGs. These pathways create a positive feedback loop that amplifies the transcription
  of IFNs and ISGs in the skin, fostering an antiviral environment to combat viral
  infections. Red circles represent phosphorylation
