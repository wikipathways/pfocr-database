caption: A proposed model of theanine-mediated tolerance to salt stress in tea plants.
  Salt stress increases glutamate accumulation and the expression of theanine biosynthetic
  genes to promote theanine biosynthesis. Theanine enhances plant high-salinity tolerance
  through a CAT-dependent ROS scavenging pathway.
