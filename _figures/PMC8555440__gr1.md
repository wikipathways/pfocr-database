caption: Intracellular compartmentation of the biosynthesis, metabolism, and signaling
  of JAs.The biosynthesis of JA occurs sequentially in the plastid/chloroplast and
  peroxisome/cytosol from α-LeA (the main route indicated by blue arrows) or from
  hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3) (summarized from knowledge obtained primarily in Arabidopsis).
  Some compounds in the pathway are substrates of enzymes located in distinct intracellular
  compartments. These constitute nodes (metabolic branching points indicated by red
  dots) through which metabolic flux can be diverted toward distinct end products.
  Peroxisomal JA is then transported to the cytosol, where diverse JA derivatives
  are produced, including the bioactive JA-Ile and possibly 12-OH-JA-Ile, which then
  enter the nucleus to activate core JA signaling by reprogramming gene expression.
  JA-Ile may move into the ER and is deactivated by hydrolysis or deconjugation. The
  endomembranes of the plastid, peroxisome, vacuole, and ER are shown by green, orange,
  blue, and purple lines, respectively (double-layer membranes are indicated by double
  lines); the PM is shown by double black lines representing the phospholipid bilayer,
  and enzymes localized at these intracellular compartments are indicated by letters
  in the same color. The NE with a double membrane and nuclear pore is shown. Biologically
  active compounds are indicated by red letters. Also shown are JASSY and OPDAT1,
  localized at the outer and inner membrane of the chloroplast, respectively, and
  probably involved in the efflux of OPDA, and CTS localized at the peroxisomal membrane
  and involved in the import of OPDA.
