caption: Gene enrichment analysis of protein-coding genes co-expressed with DE lncRNAs.
  Enriched gene-sets are represented as red nodes connected according to their GO/KEGG
  pathway relations. Color intensity of the node represents the fold enrichment while
  node size represents number of genes in the gene-set. Enriched terms belonging to
  metabolic pathways, energy and growth-related mechanisms were predominant.
