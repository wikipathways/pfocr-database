caption: Enzymes and products within the pentose-phosphate pathway are shown along
  the left side, while enzymes and products within glycolysis are shown along the
  right side. Bolded and colored arrows and squares denote enzymes considered rhythmic
  in our analysis (p < 0.05), and the color denotes how many hours away it is from
  peak abundance or phase. For example, warm colors show that an enzyme is at a relatively
  high level at CT12, while cold colors show that an enzyme is at a low level near
  CT12. Inset panels show the eJTK rhythmic protein fit, with colored dots showing
  the time from peak protein level, by time of day (CT; see ). CT, circadian time.See
