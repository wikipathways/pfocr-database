caption: Schematic of VIP signaling pathway in GnRH neurons. Note this schematic aims
  at summarizing the conclusions reached in this study and does not provide an exhaustive
  pharmacological profile of each drug. Thus, only the main target(s) of each drug
  are represented; others deemed out of the scope of this study are not. For instance,
  charybdotoxin and TRAM-34 can impact some Kv1.x channels. At higher dose, charybdotoxin
  can also impact KCa3.1
