caption: Pathways of VLC-PUFA biosynthesis. Schematic diagram of in vivo n3 VLC-PUFA
  biosynthetic pathway mediated by ELOVL4 and other ELO families [modified after Suh
  and Clandinin ()]. 18:3n3, 20:5n3, or 22:5n3 can be converted to VLC-PUFA through
  the consecutive enzymatic activities of desaturases and elongases. Although some
  elongases are specific for a single step, others are nonspecific or multifunctional
  and act at several steps (e.g., human ELOVL5 and murine ELOVL2) (). We propose that
  ELOVL4 is essential for elongation of saturated 26:0 to 28:0 and of 26:5n3 to 28:5n3.
  It is also possible that ELOVL4 is necessary for generating (C30–C38):5n3, because
  these FAs are formed only in ELOVL4-expressing cells. However, other ELOVL proteins
  may be responsible for elongations of some of these VLC-PUFA (C30–C38) by using
  products generated by the ELOVL4 elongase activity. The synthesis of 34:6n3 and
  36:6n3 in our study suggests desaturase activity on their shorter chain precursors.
  However, the specific desaturase(s) involved is not known. Reprinted from Agbaga
