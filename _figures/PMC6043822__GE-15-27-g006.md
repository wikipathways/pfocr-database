caption: 'Schematic representation of the main modulated genes and their reciprocal
  interactions in the cell. Genes significantly associated to the main biological
  functions resulted from the functional analysis were associated in the graphical
  representation of their reciprocal interaction, represented as nodes, and the biological
  relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line). All edges are supported
  by at least 1 reference from the literature, from a textbook, or from canonical
  information stored in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base (www.ingenuity.com).
  The node color indicates the direction of gene modulations: upregulation (red) or
  downregulation (green). Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent
  the functional class of the gene product. Separate graphs show distinct functional
  categories significantly associated to the gene list. (a) Cell death/cell growth
  and proliferation: the transcriptional modulation of the genes in this group pointed
  toward cell cycle arrest and the inhibition of cell proliferation, which usually
  precede cell differentiation. (b) Connective tissue development and function, mainly
  involving genes that interact reciprocally within the TGF-β1 signaling pathway.
  (c) Muscular and skeletal tissue development and function, which includes genes
  that interact either directly (such as the ACVR1 receptor on the cell membrance
  and the SMAD3 regulator in the nucleus) or indirectly (such as IGF2) with the TGF-β1
  pathway and genes involved in extracellular matrix deposition (including PCOLCE,
  PCOLCE2, and the collagen isoforms COL11A1 and COL15A1), suggesting the initial
  osteoblastic commitment of cells (see text for additional details).'
