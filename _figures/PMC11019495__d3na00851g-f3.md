caption: Potential mechanism of the effects of NPs on bone cell. (a and b) Schematic
  illustration of NPs facilitated osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs and osteoblasts.
  Classical MAPK, BMP-2/Smad, PI3K-Akt-GSK-3β-β-catenin, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathways are activated by NPs. Therefore, transcription of downstream osteogenesis-related
  gene is significantly promoted, resulting in enhanced osteogenic differentiation.
  (c) Schematic illustration of NPs attenuated osteoclastic differentiation in osteoclast.
  NPs upregulated p62 expression which result in recruitment of CYLD and increased
  deubiquitination of TRAF6, and suppression the activation of RANKL-induced downstream
  signaling pathway as MAPK and NF-κB. Thus, transcription of downstream osteoclastogenesis-related
  genes was markedly inhibited, resulting in reduced osteoclastic differentiation.
