caption: S1P receptor subtype-specific heterotrimeric G protein coupling and intracellular
  signaling mechanisms. S1PR1 couples exclusively to Gi to activate Ras-ERK and PI
  3-kinase-Akt/Rac pathways, leading to stimulation of chemotaxis and cell proliferation.
  S1PR2 couples to multiple G proteins, especially to G12/13 to induce potent Rho
  activation, leading to inhibition of Rac and cell migration, and also inhibition
  of cell proliferation via inhibition of Akt. S1PR3 activates Gq-PLC-Ca2+pathway,
  and Gi-Ras-ERK and -PI 3-kinase-Akt/Rac pathways. S1PR3- G12/13 -Rho pathway becomes
  evident only when Gi is inhibited by pertussis toxin.
