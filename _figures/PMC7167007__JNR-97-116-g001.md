caption: 'Interferon signaling pathway. Binding of IFNs (α and β) with IFNAR (Interferon‐α/β
  receptor): Activation of receptor‐associated protein tyrosine kinase. (a) Janus
  kinase‐1. (b) Tyrosine kinase‐2. (c) Signaling pathway through TRIF. These two protein
  tyrosine kinases start phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription1
  STAT1 & STAT2. Activation of STAT1 & STAT2. Dimerization and translocation of STAT1
  & STAT2 to the nucleus. Formation of trimolecular complex together with IFN‐regulatory
  factor‐9 (IRF‐9) that is, IFN‐stimulated gene factor‐3 (ISGF3). Binding of ISGF‐3
  with DNA sequence called as IFN‐stimulated response elements. These IFN‐stimulated
  response elements activate transcription of ISGs directly and regulate signaling
  of IFNs. Within hours signal decays and STATs return to cytoplasm for next signaling
  pathway. TLR 4 mediated IFN‐β activation through TRIF‐dependent pathway via Interferon
  regulatory factor 3 (IRF‐3) [Colour figure can be viewed at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com]'
