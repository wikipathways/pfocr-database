caption: Hypothetical pathways for induction of mitochondrial fragmentation by NAM
  or SIRT1 activation. NAM treatment activates SIRT1 and increases AMPK activity.
  Activated AMPK can activate PDE4B causing conversion of cAMP to AMP, which downregulates
  PKA activity. As a consequence, Drp1 phosphorylation level decreases, and thereby
  mitochondria become fragmented. This mitochondrial fragmentation may lead to elevation
  of cytosolic Ca2+, which drives calcineurin activation and Drp1 dephosphorylation.
  This cycle of Drp1 hypo-phosphorylation—mitochondrial fragmentation—Ca2+ elevation—Drp1
  dephosphorylation could accelerate mitochondrial fragmentation as well as sustain
  this state of mitochondria. This pathway of mitochondrial fragmentation (blue arrows)
  is also mobilized by direct activation of SIRT1 and AMPK. In coordination with autophagy
  activation, this SIRT1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation would facilitate mitophagy.
  Dash arrows indicate the parts of the pathway that are not demonstrated clearly
  in this study.
