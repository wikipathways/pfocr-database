caption: Model of Gα subunit-ERK pathway specificity. Signals mediated by the Gα5
  subunit require ERK1 function to enhance tip formation, inhibit chemotaxis, and
  reduce cell viability. Folate chemotaxis, cAMP accumulation, and prespore development
  are responses that can require the Gα4 subunit and ERK2. The Gα4 subunit is necessary
  for the phosphorylation of ERK2 in response to folate.
