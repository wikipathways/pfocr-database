caption: Summary of the flow- and ATP-induced eNOS activation pathway. Shear stress
  induces autocrine ATP release. ATP activates PLC via G-protein receptors allowing
  PLC to hydrolyze PIP2 to form DAG and IP3. IP3 diffuses and binds to receptors on
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causing store depletion which activates the SOC TRPC3
  and (putatively) Orai1. DAG promotes opening of store-independent TRPC4s. There
  is a combined effect of TRPC3 and TRPC4 activation. The increase in intracellular
  calcium allows for Ca2+/Calmodulin-mediated eNOS activation which leads to NO production
  regulated by TRPC3- and TRPC4- mediated calcium entry. We deduced that ATP-independent
  recruitment of TRPC4 occurs in response to flow. The participation of Orai1 in this
  pathway is unclear (grey dotted line).
