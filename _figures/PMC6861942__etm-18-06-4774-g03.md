caption: Schematic of the potential role and mechanisms of icariin in HG-induced EPC
  dysfunction. Icariin can inhibit the activation of the p38/CREB signaling pathway
  induced by HG in EPCs, and activate the Akt/eNOS/NO signaling pathway that is inhibited
  by HG in EPCs. It is proposed that via these mechanisms, icariin attenuates HG-induced
  EPC dysfunction. CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; eNOS, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase; EPC, endothelial progenitor cell; HG, high glucose; NO, nitric
  oxide; p-, phosphorylated.
