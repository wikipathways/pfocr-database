caption: Immune inhibitory receptors and their ligands are paired as shown. Neurotrophins
  and nerve growth factors (NGF) bind to CD271 (p75NTR), whose expression can be induced
  under conditions of stress, resulting in downstream signaling pathways promoting
  survival, dedifferentiation, tumorigenesis, plasticity, metastasis, and the suppression
  of T cell activation. Transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), epidermal growth factor
  (EGF), and KIT ligand (stem cell factor or STEEL) can bind to a receptor tyrosine
  kinase (RTK), such as the EGF receptor (EGFR) or KIT receptor (c-KIT receptor or
  CD117). This promotes the activation of either the MAPK pathway or PI3K/AKT pathway.
  Kinase inhibitors can induce mutations in components of either pathway, as shown
  by green arrows. These induced mutations then promote the activation of downstream
  signaling, bypassing the targeted inhibition and resulting in the phosphorylation
  of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Expression of MITF leads
  to differentiation and pigmentation (via tyrosinase activity) as well as the proliferation
  and survival of melanocytes (through the upregulation of Bcl2). Activation of these
  pathways also promotes invasion and metastasis in melanoma tumor cells. Tim3 (HAVCR2)
  forms a heterodimer with CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion
  molecule) inducing T cell inhibition, and also binds its ligand, Galectin 9 to then
  suppress T helper cell type 1 (Th1) function and induce cell death.
