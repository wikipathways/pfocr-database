caption: 'Flavonoid biosynthesis pathway in tomato. A, Basic structures of an anthocyanin
  and a flavonol. Common modification positions include 3′ (R1), 4′ (R2), 5′ (R3),
  3 (R4), 5 (R5), and 7 (R6) of each ring. B, Schematic representation of the flavonoid
  biosynthetic pathway in tomato. Compounds highlighted in purple are the major anthocyanins
  identified in tomato fruit, and major flavonols are highlighted in orange. From
  the top, abbreviations are as follows: PAL, Phe ammonia lyase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA
  ligase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; C3H, 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; CHS, chalcone
  synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3′H, flavonoid-3′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol
  synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; 3GT, flavonoid
  3-O-glucosyltransferase; RT, flavonoid 3-O-glucoside-rhamnosyltransferase; AT, anthocyanin
  acyltransferase; 5GT, flavonoid-5-glucosyltransferase; and OMT, O-methyltransferase.'
