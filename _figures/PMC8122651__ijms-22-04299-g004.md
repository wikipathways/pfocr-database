caption: Differential involvement of multiple signaling systems in the manifestation
  of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. According to recent studies
  on the mechanistic hypothesis of schizophrenia, signaling systems other than the
  DAergic system also play important roles. For example, abnormalities in the glutamatergic
  or GABAergic system could be involved in the dysregulation of the DAergic system,
  which is believed to be the final common pathway in schizophrenia. (A) Glutamate
  hypofunctioning hypothesis for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. (Upper) Normal
  Glu-GABA-Glu neuronal circuitry with respect to mesolimbic DAergic projection. A
  pyramidal Glutamate neuron (the first neuron) synapses on a GABA interneuron (the
  second neuron), which next inhibits a secondary cortico-tegmental pyramidal glutamatergic
  neuron (the third neuron). These series of connections lead to the firing of mesolimbic
  dopaminergic neurons at the normal rate. (Lower) Abnormal Glu-GABA-Glu-DA neuronal
  circuitry. The NMDAR on the GABAergic neuron is suboptimal, and the second glutamatergic
  neuron is not inhibited properly, resulting in overactivation of the mesolimbic
  DAergic system that projects to limbic area. (B) Glutamate hypofunctioning hypothesis
  for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. (Upper) Normal Glu-GABA-Glu-GABA neuronal
  circuitry with respect to the mesocortical DAergic pathway. In this pathway, another
  GABAergic connection is inserted between the cortico-tegmental glutamatergic and
  mesocortical DAergic neurons at the level of the brainstem. (Lower) In schizophrenia,
  a loss of NMDA activity on the first GABAergic neuron leads to consecutive activation
  of subsequent Glu-GABA neurons, which results in the inhibition of DAergic neurons
  located in the VTA. The decrease in DA input to the frontal cortex correlates with
  the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Adapted from Reference [].
