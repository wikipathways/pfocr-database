caption: Biologic actions of isoprenoids. Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway shows effects
  of inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase by statins.
  Decrease in isoprenylation of signaling molecules, such as Ras, Rho, and Rac, leads
  to modulation of various signaling pathways. BMP-2 = bone morphogenetic protein–2;
  CoA = coenzyme A; eNOS = endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ET-1 = endothelin-1;
  HMG-CoA = 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl–CoA reductase inhibitor; PAI-1 = plasminogen
  activator inhibitor–1; PP = pyrophosphate; t-PA = tissue-type plasminogen activator.
