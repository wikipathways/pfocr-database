caption: 'IGFs in the peripheral nervous system. A, IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF-IR play
  critical roles for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of sensory and
  motor neurons as well as skeletal muscles and surrounding Schwann cells. B, Most
  of the physiological effects of IGFs are mediated by the type I IGF-IR. Upon ligand
  binding of the IGF-IR, autophosphorylation of its β-subunits occurs, resulting in
  binding of the major IGF-IR substrates, IRS-1, and IRS-2. Tyrosine phosphorylation
  of IRS proteins recruits and activates two major downstream signaling pathways of
  IGF-IR: MAPK pathway mainly for neuronal motility and neurite outgrowth and PI3K/Akt
  pathway responsible for neuron survival.'
