caption: Schematic model of CLE signaling involved in immune response. (A) Representative
  model of the conserved signaling pathway between CLE signaling and immune signaling.
  Peptide ligands are recognized by leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs)
  with their co-receptors. The signals are transduced via receptor-like cytoplasmic
  kinases (RLCKs) and G proteins and dampened by phosphatases to regulate downstream
  transcription factors. (B-E) Schematic flowcharts of CLE signaling involving plant-pathogen
  interactions. (B-D) Involvement of CLE signaling in plant-bacterial pathogen interactions
  in Arabidopsis (B, C) and maize (D). (E) Involvement of WUS in plant-virus interaction
  in Arabidopsis. Dashed lines indicate putative or indirect pathways. Figure adapted
