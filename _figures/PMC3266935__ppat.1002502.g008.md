caption: HCMV infection results in AMPK activation, likely through activation of CaMKK.
  AMPK activation results in glycolytic activation to provide energy and building
  blocks necessary for production of viral progeny. AMPK activation would typically
  result in inhibition of cellular processes important for viral replication, e.g.
  protein translation and fatty acid biosynthesis. Viral gene products block these
  consequences of AMPK activation, e.g. UL38 binds TSC complex and prevents inhibition
  of mTOR and protein translation. (FP =  fructose-6-phosphate, FBP  =  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate).
