caption: Biosynthesis of nucleotides. Purines and pyrimidines are synthesized de novo
  from amino acids as the ribose form of nucleotides and inosine monophosphate (IMP)
  that are modified by IMP dehydrogenase to adenosine-monophosphate (rAMP) and guanosine-monophosphate
  (rGMP). Next, nucleotide monophosphate (rNMP) is phosphorylated to a triphosphate
  form (rNTP), which is the substrate for RNA. The ribose form of nucleotide diphosphate
  (rNDP) is converted to the 2’-deoxyribose form (dNDP) by cellular or viral ribonucleotide
  reductase (RR), as shown in the lower box. When viral RR is induced by HSV and VZV
  infection, dNDPs are synthesized in the early phase of infection and are used for
  viral DNA synthesis, even in cells that do not actively synthesize cellular DNA.
  Thymidine is an important substrate of DNA and is supplied in two ways—by the conversion
  of uridine monophosphate (UMP) to thymidine monophosphate (TMP) via thymidylate
  synthase (TS) (de novo pathway) and from the systemic circulation by thymidine kinase
  (TK) (salvage pathway). Acyclovir (ACV) and penciclovir (PCV) are phosphorylated
  by viral TK and are further phosphorylated to the triphosphate form by cellular
  enzymes, as shown in the green-shaded boxes. ACV-TP and PCV-TP are incorporated
  into viral DNA by viral DNA polymerase, which results in chain termination. Foscarnet
  (PFA) and amenamevir (ASP2151) directly inhibit viral DNA synthesis by inhibiting
  DNA polymerase and HP, respectively. Nucleotides are used for RNA synthesis in the
  early phase of viral replication. ACV and PCV are efficiently phosphorylated by
  viral TK and inhibit viral DNA synthesis because the supply of dGTP is limited in
  infected cells. This efficient inhibition of viral replication by ACV continues
  for 5 h after infection. In the late phase of viral replication, ribonucleotides
  are converted to deoxyribonucleotides by viral RR for viral DNA synthesis as indicated
  by red arrows. Accordingly, large amounts of dGTP are supplied for DNA synthesis
  (approximately 60,000 and 90,000 dGTPs per DNA molecule of VZV and HSV, respectively)
  and this attenuates the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by reducing the ratio
  of ACV-TP:dGTP. PFA and ASP2151 directly inhibit viral DNA synthesis and are not
  influenced by the supply of dGTP, which results in the efficient inhibition of viral
  growth in contrast to ACV.
