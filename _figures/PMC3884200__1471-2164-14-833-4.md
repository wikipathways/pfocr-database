caption: The effects of CYP2S1 depletion on arachidonic acid metabolism. A simplified
  version of the cyclooxygenase pathway within the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway,
  focused on published cellular modulation of prostaglandin synthesis. Grey indicates
  no significant change in expression. Gold represents very low expression (i.e. base
  mean average value is <1.5). Shades of red and blue indicate a significant (p < 0.05)
  increase and decrease in expression in CYP2S1 depleted cells, respectively. Numerical
  values represent fold change in RNA-seq. * indicates the significant (p <0.05).
