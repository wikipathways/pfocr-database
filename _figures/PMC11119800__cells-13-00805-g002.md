caption: OGT is required for the development of infectious liver diseases. (1) HBV
  infection increases GLUT1 expression, promotes glucose uptake, provides a substrate
  for UDP-GlcNAc, and modifies SMDH1 by O-GlcNAcylation, thus inhibiting viral replication.
  In addition, cellular autophagy is activated after HBV infection. OGT affects autophagosome
  formation by affecting ER stress, AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, as well as autophagosome-lysosome
  fusion, and regulates HBV replication. (2) miR-501-3p can silence OGT to increase
  HCV infection. (3) E. histolytica makes contact with hepatocytes, which reduces
  OGT/OGA levels, increases Ca2+, activates calpain, cleaves OGT, and eventually leads
  to host cell death
