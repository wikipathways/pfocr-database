caption: Pattern of miR-34 (the black arrow) and miR-424 (the red arrow) that inhibit
  or promote DENV replication by regulating host factors. (a) The induction of the
  innate response by virus infection or other stimuli through pattern recognition/retinoic
  acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. (b)Viral infection leads to activation
  of innate immunity and first induces phosphorylation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1).
  (c) This is followed by the phosphorylation or homodimerization of the interferon
  regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), (d) and then it translocated into the nucleus, where
  it induces the transcription of type I Interferons (IFNs) and interferon-stimulated
  genes. (e) Meanwhile, the viral infection also activate the Wnt signaling pathway,
  (f) leading to the repression of the Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GS3Kβ) phosphorylation,
  and (g) which suppresses the IFN pathway by interacting with TBK1. The intersection
  between these two pathways suggests that the Wnt signaling pathway has the ability
  to modulate the innate inflammatory response. (h) miR-34 can act as an inhibitor
  of the Wnt signaling pathway to enhance type I IFN signaling, leading to a cellular
  antiviral status (). (i) miR-424 suppresses expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase
  SIAH1; (j) SIAH1 binds to and ubiquitinates the innate immune adaptor protein MyD88;
  (k) SIAH1 knockdown inhibits proteasome-dependent degradation of MyD88; (l) Inhibition
  of SIAH1 increases MyD88-Mediated NF-kB signaling during DENV2 infection; (m) and
  further promote the production of the NF-kB–activated proinflammatory cytokines.
