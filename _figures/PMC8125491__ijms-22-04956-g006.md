caption: 'The landscape of synergic epigenetic interactions with NF-κB signaling pathway
  in PD development. The NF-κB signaling pathway is activated on the higher level
  of α-synuclein deposits. (A) Increased histone H3 acetylation overexpresses the
  SNCA gene and increases the release of inflammatory cytokines. (B) Similarly, coordination
  of lncMALAT1 sponging with miR-124 and MEKK3 also enhances NF-κB signaling pathway
  activation. (C) Hypomethylation of IL-β displayed similar neuroinflammatory effects.
  Moreover, lower expression of PGC-1α also contributes to NF-κB signaling pathway
  activation. Altogether, these epigenetic mechanisms interact with each other and
  with NF-κB signaling pathways to induce neuroinflammation in PD development. Note:
  ↓ shows downregulated expression, and ↑ shows an upregulated expression.'
