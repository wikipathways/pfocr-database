caption: This pathway produces a key NAD+ intermediate, nicotinamide mononucleotide
  (NMN), from a precursor nicotinamide (NIC). NMN is immediately converted to NAD+
  by NMN adenylyltransferases (NMNATs). NIC, which is produced by NAD+-consuming enzymes,
  such as sirtuins, poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), and CD38/157 ectoenzymes,
  can be salvaged into this biosynthetic pathway. NMRK1 and NMRK2 (also known as NRK1
  and NRK2), as well as CD73, mediate the conversion between NMN and nicotinamide
  riboside (NR). Sirtuins, SIRT1 and SIRT6 in particular, modulate BMAL1/CLOCK, heterodimeric
  clock activators. CLOCK/BMAL1 activate various clock genes, including period1/2,
  cry1/2, and Nampt, by binding to E-boxes on their promoters. Nampt transcription
  shows circadian oscillation, producing circadian NAD+ oscillation as a metabolic
  oscillator. PER/CRY repress the CLOCK/BMAL1 function through protein–protein interaction,
  whereas SIRT1 suppresses their transcriptional activity through protein modification
  (deacetylation).
