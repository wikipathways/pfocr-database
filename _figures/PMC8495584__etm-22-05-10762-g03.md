caption: Potential underlying mechanism of EVO on the inhibition of proliferation
  and cell cycle progression. EVO suppresses cell proliferation by blocking cell cycle
  progression at G2/M phase by concurrently inhibiting Myt-1 and activating Cdc25C
  phosphatase, which significantly increases the activation of the Cdc2/cyclin B complex.
  In addition, EVO downregulates cyclin A expression, which induces S-phase arrest
  in cancer cells. EVO can also inhibit cancer cell proliferation by activating the
  PPARγ signaling pathway by downregulating cyclin D1 whilst upregulating the expression
  of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Arrows represent stimulatory effects
  and T-lines represent inhibitory effects. EVO, evodiamine; Cdc, cell division cycle;
  PPARγ, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ; myt-1, membrane-associated
  tyrosine- and threonine-specific cdc2-inhibitory kinase.
