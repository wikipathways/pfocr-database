  Upper left: intuitive view of perturbations and their points of action. Small inhibitory
  RNAs alter gene expression; natural protein ligands and small compounds act, e.g.,
  on receptors, transporters or enzymes. Genetic alterations have diverse functional
  effects. Perturbations can be natural or investigational. Observations (readouts)
  typically focus on a phenotype of interest, such as growth or differentiation, and
  on observation points that are both practical and informative, such as transcripts,
  protein levels or covalent modifications, e.g. phosphorylation. Upper right: MIMO
  model. All key system variables are represented as real number variables, the combinatorial
  perturbations ui as well as their targets, internal variables, observation points
  and phenotypic outputs yi. Inputs (upper layer, squares) affect the different dynamical
  variables of the system (circles), some of which can be observed (lower layer, squares).
  The model represents a processing system that relates the input to the output through
  the interacting dynamical variables. Representation of coupled perturbations (nonlinear
  effects) is a key requirement of the modeling method. When rate equations are linear
  (lower left), perturbation effects will combine additively. However, in a well-parameterized
  system with nonlinear transfer functions (lower right), epistasis effects will arise,
  and downstream effects depend on pathway organization. Below: uses of a derived
  MIMO model. When inputs and outputs are known, a model can be used to infer the
  internal mechanism of the system (Interpretation). When the inputs and the system
  are known, the model can be used to predict a response (Prediction). When the system
  and the desired output are known, the model can serve to design optimal modes of
  control (Control).'
