caption: Necroptosis activation in AD. Protein misfolding and accumulation leads to
  activation of the TNF signaling pathway. TNFR1 activation results in the recruitment
  of RIPK1. In the absence of caspase-8 activity, RIPK1 interacts with RIPK3 to form
  the necrosome. MLKL is recruited to the complex and phosphorylated by pRIPK3, which
  triggers its oligomerization and translocation to the plasma membrane, where executes
  necroptosis
