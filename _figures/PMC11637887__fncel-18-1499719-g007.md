caption: 'The role of DNA methylation changes in the pathogenesis of HD and the cellular
  impact of toxic huntingtin protein variants. (A) Production of toxic huntingtin
  protein variants. The huntingtin gene generates various toxic protein variants through
  multiple pathways, including RNA hairpins, abnormal repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN)
  translation protein products, amino-terminal huntingtin protein exon 1 protein fragment,
  and small fragments from full-length mutant huntingtin (mHTT). These fragments aggregate
  to form large inclusions in the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular
  toxicity. (B) Cellular impact of toxic mHTT fragments. Nucleus: Toxic mHTT fragments
  disrupt nuclear processes, leading to transcriptional dysregulation and impaired
  DNA repair mechanisms. Factors such as DNA methylation changes, aging, and environmental
  influences exacerbate these effects, resulting in dysregulated transcription of
  important genes, including those involved in DNA repair. Mitochondria: mHTT fragments
  cause mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by decreased ATP production, impaired
  mitochondrial protein import, autophagy damage, and increased oxidative stress,
  which contribute to metabolic dysfunction. Synapse: Toxic mHTT fragments affect
  synaptic function, leading to abnormal synaptic transmission, neuronal death, and
  decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. This results in altered
  synaptic plasticity, dysregulated neurotransmitter release, and neuronal dysfunction,
  ultimately progressing to cell death. Interventions with 5-AzaC, 5-Fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine
  (FdCyd), and decitabine have been shown to reverse transcriptional dysregulation
  and synaptic dysfunction, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies'
