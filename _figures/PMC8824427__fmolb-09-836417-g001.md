caption: Schematic representation of Notch receptor activation and avenues for therapeutic
  intervention. The pathway is activated by ligand binding to Notch receptor, followed
  by proteolytic cleavage fy proteases. This releases the Notch intracellular domain,
  which is then transferred to nucleus for biding with C protein binding factor 1/Suppressor
  of Hairless/Lag-1 allowing conversion of complex from repressor to activator of
  Notch genes. From inhibition perspective, γ-secretase inhibitors and monoclonal
  antibodies can inhibit Notch ligands and receptors (; ).
