caption: 'Overview of the primary cilium-related gene products involved in CS pathophysiology.
  Genes are clustered according to their function and location in the ciliary structures.
  Gene products labels are coloured after the suture sites (CS type legend) that are
  prevalently involved in the associated phenotypes (see  and  for details). The functional
  ciliary gene clusters and the associated phenotypes indicate some level of genotype/phenotype
  correlations: (i). the genes encoding adaptor proteins needed for the intraflagellar
  complex A-mediated retrograde transport (IFT122, IFT43, IFT140, WDR35, WDR19) are
  found mutated in phenotypes with midline CS, prevalently affecting the sagittal
  suture; (ii). genes encoding main players of the hedgehog pathway (SMO, GLI3, IHH,
  EVC and RAB23) are associated with more heterogeneous suture involvement, ranging
  from single sagittal or unicoronal CS, to bicoronal and multi-suture craniosynostoses;
  (iii). the genes products involved in the regulation of centrosome cycle, ciliary
  trafficking and cilium assembly are mutated in syndromes that may feature either
  midline CS (ASPM, MCPH1, CEP57, TMEM216, FLNA), or uni/bicoronal CS (NEK1, CEP120)
  up to multisuture CS (CDC45).'
