caption: Sources of cysteine and cysteine-generated H2S in bacteria. Cysteine in bacteria
  is produced from—(i) l-serine via classical de novo biosynthetic pathway (ii) l-methionine
  via reverse transsulfuration pathway that involves conversion of Met to S-adenosyl-methionine,
  followed by generation of S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) which is cleaved to l-homocysteine
  either by SAH-hydrolase or by successive action of SAH-nucleosidase and S-ribosyl-homocysteinase
  (LuxS). Subsequently, PLP-dependent enzyme, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) catalyses
  the condensation of homocysteine and serine to form l-cystathionine which is converted
  by cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL) to cysteine, α-ketobutyrate (α-KB) and ammonia (Thomas
  and Surdin-Kerjan ; Guédon et al. ) (iii) peptides (cystathione) and (iv) direct
  intake of extracellular cystine via ABC transporters. Enzymatic biogenesis of H2S
  mainly involves CBS, CGL, and 3-MGT/CAT routes. The schematic figure depicts all
  enzymes as monomers without any relevance to the biologically active oligomeric
  form. Thin arrows in the figure represent release of a by-product. Inset depicts
  formation of CSC under varying cellular availability of OAS. In absence, CysK and
  CysE form CSC where the activity of CysK is inhibited and there is no production
  of cysteine. Once OAS starts accumulating, the complex dissociates to release CysK
  for cysteine production
