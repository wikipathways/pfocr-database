caption: DNA repair pathway in mitochondria. A schematic representation of BER in
  mitochondria. In normal DNA guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C); G:C. In case of
  oxidative DNA damage, guanine is directly oxidized to 8-oxoG, which pairs against
  cytosine (C). The oxidatively damaged base is repaired by DNA glycosylase, here
  the represented glycosylase is hOGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase which acts both
  as an N-glycosylase and an AP-lyase), which specifically removes the 8-oxoG opposite
  C and restores the normal DNA, that is, G:C. If unrepaired, the damaged base are
  replicated by translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases (181), which results in
  an 8-oxoG opposite adenine (A). In the second defense mechanism, repair enzymes
  like hMYH (Mut Y homologue) act in removing adenine opposite 8-oxoG thus eliminating
  G:C → T:A transversions. If the 8-oxoG:A is left unrepaired and undergoes DNA replication
  it results in mutated DNA, that is, G:C to T:A.
