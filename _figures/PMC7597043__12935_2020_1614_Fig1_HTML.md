caption: Potential mechanisms of venetoclax resistance. Ventoclax recognizes the BH3-biding
  groove of BCL2 and eases BAK/BAX complex formation, releasing cytochrome c from
  mitochondria and promote tumor cell apoptosis. Mutation of BCL2 changes protein
  conformation and impedes venetoclax binding to its target thus against its pro-apoptic
  effect. Also, genetic alterations such as mutation of TP53 and amplification of
  1q23 combined with running out of ATP on mitochondria membrane lead AMPK/PKA pathway
  aberrantly activating, diminishing the permeability of mitochondria membrane and
  inducing venetoclax resistance. Interact with non-tumor cells in surrounding microenvironment
  though membrane molecules activate multiple signaling pathways including NF-κB and
  PI3K/AKT, which upregulating the anti-apoptic proteins and relseasing varity of
  inflammatory cytokines. Gene mutation and immune phenotype alteration promote clonal
  evolution, dysregulate cancer signaling pathways activation and proteins expression,
  finally lead to venetoclax resistance
