caption: 'A. Gravin forms signaling complexes with β2ARs and PKA. (1) β2AR stimulation
  of AC and gravin-anchored PKA promotes β2AR phosphorylation; (2) β2ARs switch from
  Gs to Gi coupling; (3) β2AR Gi coupling activates ERK pathway and promotes synaptic
  potentiation. Adapted from (). B. Yotiao binds to the GluN1 C-terminal where it
  regulates NMDAR activity through PKA and PP1 phospho-regulation. Yotiao regulates
  GABAARs and IP3R1s. AC2 activity is inhibited when anchored to yotiao. C. Top: AKAP15/18α
  in the hippocampal mossy fiber projection anchors PKA. Pre-synaptic Ca2+ influx
  activates PKA, promoting pre-synaptic MF-LTP. Bottom: AKAP15/18 binds to LTCCs and
  NaV1.2, anchoring PKA to enhance and inhibit channel function respectively. D. D-AKAP1
  anchors PKA at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). The GTPase Drp1 is inhibited
  by PKA phosphorylation, leading to mitochondrial elongation. This is opposed by
  the activity of PP2A associated with the OMM and CaN which is thought to interact
  with Drp1 and possibly also D-AKAP1.'
