caption: Modeling compound response to toxicity assay with DToxFor toxicity prediction,
  the chemical structure of a compound is quantified using MACCS fingerprint before
  being converted to target profile by our previously developed method, TargetTox.
  The target profile is then fed into a VNN, whose structure is guided by Reactome
  pathway hierarchy. Specific pathways and biological processes are coded as hidden
  modules with a series of neurons. For model interpretation, the network output is
  propagated backward onto each neuron as relevance score using the layer-wise relevance
  propagation technique. A permutation-based strategy is then employed to identify
  the VNN paths of high relevance. Each path connects a compound to its toxicity outcome
  via the target protein, specific pathways, and biological process.
