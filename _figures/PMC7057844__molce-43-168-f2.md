caption: Ihh is required for Runx2 expression, and hedgehog signaling and Runx2 induce
  the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells into preosteoblasts in endochondral
  bone. Runx2 activates the hedgehog signaling pathway through the induction of Ihh,
  Gli1, and Ptch1. Runx2, Sp7, and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway induce the
  differentiation of preosteoblasts into immature osteoblasts. Runx2 induces Sp7 expression
  at the preosteoblast stage, Runx2 activates the Wnt signaling pathway through the
  induction of Tcf7 and Wnt10b expression, and Sp7 and Tcf7 activate a Runx2 enhancer.
  Runx2 and Sp7 induce the differentiation of immature osteoblasts into mature osteoblasts.
  Runx2 induces the proliferation of multipotent mesenchymal cells, osteoprogenitors,
  and preosteoblasts through the regulation of Fgf, hedgehog, Wnt, and Pthlh signaling
  pathway genes. The mutual regulation between Runx2 and the signaling pathways, including
  hedgehog, Fgf, Wnt, and Pthlh, or Sp7 plays important roles in the proliferation
  and differentiation of osteoblast-lineage cells and their progenitors.

  description: Ihh is required for Runx2 expression, and hedgehog signaling and Runx2
    induce the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells into preosteoblasts
    in endochondral bone. Runx2 activates the hedgehog signaling pathway through the
    induction of Ihh, Gli1, and Ptch1. Runx2, Sp7, and the canonical Wnt signaling
    pathway induce the differentiation of preosteoblasts into immature osteoblasts.
    Runx2 induces Sp7 expression at the preosteoblast stage, Runx2 activates the Wnt
    signaling pathway through the induction of Tcf7 and Wnt10b expression, and Sp7
    and Tcf7 activate a Runx2 enhancer. Runx2 and Sp7 induce the differentiation of
    immature osteoblasts into mature osteoblasts. Runx2 induces the proliferation
    of multipotent mesenchymal cells, osteoprogenitors, and preosteoblasts through
    the regulation of Fgf, hedgehog, Wnt, and Pthlh signaling pathway genes. The mutual
    regulation between Runx2 and the signaling pathways, including hedgehog, Fgf,

    of osteoblast-lineage cells and their progenitors.
