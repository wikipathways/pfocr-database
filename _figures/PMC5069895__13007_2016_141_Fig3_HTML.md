caption: 'The core pathway for anthocyanin biosynthesis. The general phenylpropanoid
  pathway is catalysed by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase
  (C4H) and 4-coumaroyl CoA ligase (4CL). Enzymes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis
  are chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H),
  flavanone 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H) and flavanone 3′5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H), which produce
  dihydroflavanols: dihydrokaempferol (DHK), dihydroquercetin (DHQ) and dihydromyricetin
  (DHM), respectively. Anthocyanins are synthesized by dihydroflavanol 4-reductase
  (DFR) and anthocyanin synthase (ANS), and stabilised by 3-glucosyl-transferase (3GT),
  3-rhamnosyl transferase (3RT), 5-glucosyl transferase (5GT) and anthocyanin acyl
  transferase (AT). Biosynthetic genes identified as being significantly differentially
  expressed (P value <0.05) are in blue; numbers in green are the fold change of expression
  observed for each differentially expressed gene between Control and LAP1 conditions
  (Additional file : Table S1); green upward arrow represents upregulation; Asterisk
  multiple isoforms of genes encoding these enzymes are upregulated'
