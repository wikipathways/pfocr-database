caption: 'mTORC2 signaling controls metabolic reprogramming in GBM: mTORC2 reprograms
  the glycolytic metabolism, lipid, glutamine, nucleotide and ROS metabolism mainly
  through Akt and c-Myc. Akt and c-Myc promote glycolysis and Warburg effect to generate
  sufficient energy and macromolecules for rapid tumor growth. mTORC2 activates SREBP1
  in an Akt-dependent and Akt-independent manner to promote lipogenesis, providing
  lipids for the synthesis of membrane and signal molecules. mTORC2 also regulates
  glutaminolysis by activating c-Myc. GBM with an activated mutant form of EGFR engages
  c-Myc signaling at least by two complementary steps including mTORC1 and mTORC2.
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; SREBP, sterol regulatory binding protein; GLS, glutaminase.'
