caption: Proposed model for Cry toxin action. The univalent binding of Cry toxin monomer
  to BT-R initiates the progression of cell death by transmitting a death signal into
  the cell. A signal transduction pathway, involving G protein (Gα) adenylyl cyclase
  (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA), is activated. Activation of the signaling pathway
  mediates exocytosis of the BT-R receptor from intracellular vesicles to the cell
  membrane. The resulting enhanced display of BT-R on the cell surface facilitates
  recruitment of additional toxin molecules which, in turn, amplifies the original
  signal in a cascade-like fashion. The signaling kinase PKA modifies downstream molecules
  that promote the biochemical activities that destroy the cell. Toxin oligomers incorporated
  into the plasma membrane of living cells do not form lytic pores and are not toxic.
