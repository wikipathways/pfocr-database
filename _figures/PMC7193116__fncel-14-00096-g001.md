caption: Proposed schematic representation of how CX3CL1 induces microvascular barrier
  disruption in the spine. The vertebral spongy bone is rich in CX3CL1. CX3CL1 induces
  activation of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway in VMECs, which further
  induces the F-actin formation and ZO-1 disruption in ECs and subsequent microvascular
  barrier disruption, resulting in exacerbation of tumor cells TEM in the spine.

  description: Proposed schematic representation of how CX3CL1 induces microvascular
    barrier disruption in the spine. The vertebral spongy bone is rich in CX3CL1.
    CX3CL1 induces activation of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway in VMECs,
    which further induces the F-actin formation and ZO-1 disruption in ECs and subsequent
    microvascular barrier disruption, resulting in exacerbation of tumor cells TEM
    in the spine.
