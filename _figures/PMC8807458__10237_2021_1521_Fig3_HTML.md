caption: The effects of mechanical stimuli on cell–cell signaling pathways in ECs
  and VSMCs a the Notch signaling pathway where a Jagged ligand from the EC binds
  to a Notch receptor on the VSMC, resulting in the translocation of NICD to the nucleus.
  In the EC strain downregulates Notch expression, while shear stress can either up-
  or downregulate the expression of Notch, Dll, and Jagged. In the VSMC, strain downregulates
  the expression of both Notch and Jagged. b) the TGF-β signaling pathway where the
  TGF-β ligand binds to the TGF-β receptor and activates canonical SMAD or noncanonical
  (dashed arrow) cascades. Shear stress and strain upregulate TGF-β1 release from
  ECs, and strain upregulates TGF-β1 release from VSMCs to create an autocrine feedback
