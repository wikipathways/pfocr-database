caption: 'Metabolic pathway layout of terpenoid genes. The 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate
  (DXP) pathway enzymes (shaded) are: Dxs, 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase;
  Dxr, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase; IspD, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  synthase; IspE, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase; IspF, 2C-methyl-D-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; IspG, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate
  synthase; IspH, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase; Idi (encoded
  by fni), isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase; IspA, farnesyl diphosphate synthase;
  HepS, heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase component I; UppS, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate
  synthetase; IspS, putative isoprene synthase. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway enzymes
  (white) are: MmgA, degradative acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; YhfS, hydroxymethylglutaryl
  CoA synthase; PksG, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-ACP synthase. Metabolite abbreviations:
  G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  diphosphate.B, The genome position, length, and sense of each of the terpenoid genes
  in the B. subtilis genome are represented in the table and graphically.'
