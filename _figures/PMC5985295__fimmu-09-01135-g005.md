caption: 'Cooperation of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated ISGF3 and GAF components
  and IRF1 in the regulation of basal and IFN-induced transcription. In unstimulated
  cells, most of the known ISGs are expressed at low but detectable levels. Among
  these genes, there are examples of components (STATs and IRFs) of transcription
  factors, which in the absence of stimulation can combine in unphosphorylated complexes
  (U-ISGF3, U-STAT1, U-STAT2/IRF9, and IRF1) and drive the constitutive expression
  of ISGs. After cell stimulation with IFN type I or II, receptors dimerize and enable
  receptor-bound kinases (JAK1 and TYK2 for IFN-I or JAK1 and JAK2 for IFN-II) transphosphorylation
  and STAT protein recruitment. Next step is phosphorylation of STATs, which can now
  dimerize and with or without a partner (IRF9) create complexes—ISGF3, ST2/IRF9,
  and GAF, then translocate to the nucleus and start a high and robust but transient
  expression (yellow dotted graph) of GAS and/or ISRE-containing ISGs. This leads
  to, inter alia, rapid accumulation of newly synthesized STAT1, STAT2, IRF9, and
  IRF1 proteins in the cytoplasm, which can create new transcription factors in unphosphorylated
  form (U-ISGF3, U-STAT1, and U-STAT2/IRF9), and while level of phospho-proteins is
  dropping (dotted line) support or take over the role of phosphorylated complexes
  in sustaining the expression of ISGs. Important role in the circuit plays IRF1,
  which can occupy ISRE-containing genes and co-binds with other factors to modulate
  IFN-induced response, as well as basal ISG expression. As shown in the graph, responses
  to both types of IFN rely on common elements and events of the JAK–STAT signaling
  pathway and result in partially shared outcome. Thus, IFN-I and IFN-II induce a
  common as well as a unique set of genes. These facts clearly point to functional
  and biological overlap between IFN-I and IFN-II action and additionally to existence
  of mechanisms allowing cells to manage and adjust both responses. Abbreviations:
  IFN, interferon; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; IRF, interferon
  regulatory factor; JAK, Janus kinase; TYK, tyrosine kinase; ISGF3, interferon-stimulated
  gene factor 3; GAF, γ-activated factor; ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element;
  GAS, γ-activated sequence; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; P, phosphate; U, unphosphorylated
