caption: The MKK7-MPK6 cascade plays predominant roles in diverse developmental processes
  including leaf venation architecture, filament elongation, lateral root formation,
  and shoot branching. MKK7-MPK3 and MKK7-MPK6 cascades function redundantly in leaf
  morphology; the MKK7-MPK6 signaling pathway regulates PAT through phosphorylating
  PIN1. In the wild type, PIN1 basal localization is controlled by reversible phosphorylation
  of S337 site by the MKK7-MPK6 cascade. In the bud1 plants, constitutively activated
  MKK7-MPK6 signaling leads to sustained phosphorylation of the PIN1 S337 site, which
  leads to PIN1 apolar localization and results in branching phenotype.
