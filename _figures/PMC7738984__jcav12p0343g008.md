  genes; (B) Regulatory network of the target genes, in which the blue ellipse node
  and red round rectangle node represent the target gene and pathway, respectively,
  and the separate arrow line and solid line represent the target gene-pathway and

  inducing cell apoptosis via mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Hespintor induced ROS
  via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The medium-low concentration of ROS enhanced
  Lck expression and phosphorylation (p56lck), the latter of which activated p38-MAPK
  and EGF/EGFR pathway to promote uPA and uPAR expression; High concentration of ROS
  induced cell apoptosis.
