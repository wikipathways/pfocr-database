caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the unique pattern of phosphorylation of RLC
  in uterine myocytes. As in all smooth muscle, myosin regulatory light chain (RLC)
  is phosphorylated by myosin regulatory light chain kinase (MLCK) at S19. However,
  in uterine myocytes, pRLC is additionally phosphorylated at T18 to form ppRLC, a
  more potent activator of the myosin ATPase that supplies energy for the contraction.
  This diphosphorylation pathway might be a unique adaptive pathway for smooth muscle
  that contract in a phasic pattern. The green lines indicate stimulatory activity
  and the red lines inhibitory.
