caption: 'The role of the gut microbiota and communication with the brain. A healthy
  gut contains large fractions of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, including
  the genera Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcus followed by Verrucomicrobia
  and Actinobacteria, but contains a low number of Proteobacteria phyla members (Mowry
  and Glenn, ). The gut microbiota is related to GI function, but also involved in
  several complex modulatory processes, inflammation and immune response, and peripheral
  (enteric) and central neurotransmission, as well as synthetize and secrete essential
  substances. The gut microbiota contributes to important homeostatic processes and
  is essential for the homeostasis of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (Liu
  L. et al., ). The gut microbiota can affect brain function and bioactivity through
  gut–brain axis via several pathways: (1) the neural regulating pathway, in which
  vagus nerve links between the gut and the spinal cord (autonomic nervous system;
  Bonaz et al., ). The gut microbiota can secrete and regulate neurotransmitters of
  the CNS. (2) The endocrine pathway. The HPA axis can release glucocorticoids, etc.,
  after stimulations by stress or other factors, which can alter gut microbiota composition
  and increase gut epithelium permeability and immune responses in gut (Ait-Belgnaoui
  et al., ; Park et al., ; Bellavance and Rivest, ). (3) The immune-regulating pathway
  via lymphocyte, cytokines, chemokines, and antigen-presenting effect of SCFAs communicating
  with the brain. (4) The blood circulation pathway (Logsdon et al., ). The immune
  and endocrine molecules, such as cytokines and hormones, can pass BBB and intestinal
  mucosa to influence both gut and brain functions (Zac-Varghese et al., ). BBB, blood–brain
  barrier; CNS, central nervous system; HPA axis, hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis;
  SCFA, short-chain fatty acids; APC, antigen-presenting cells.'
