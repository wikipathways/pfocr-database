caption: Recognition of nucleic acid-containing antigens by B cells results in activating
  signals from the BCR as well as delivery of nucleic acids to endolysosomes that
  contain TLR7. TLR7 trafficking to and from the endolysosomes is controlled by the
  chaperone UNC93B1. Upon recognizing ssRNA, TLR7 signals via a complex that includes
  MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6. Several transcription factors are activated downstream
  of this complex, resulting in changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression.
  Several new contributors to the IRF5/IRF7/type 1 IFN branch of this pathway have
  been identified, including BANK1, SLC15A4, and CXorf21/TASL. TLR7 and IFNγR signaling
  converge on the transcription factor STAT1, leading to upregulation of the transcription
  factor T-bet. Type 1 IFNs also activate STAT1, increasing TLR7 expression. Activation
  of nucleic-acid specific B cells in an environment where IFNγ and IL-21 are present
  results in the accumulation of germinal center B cells, ABC/DN2 cells, and plasma
  cells and the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. Figure created with BioRender.com.
