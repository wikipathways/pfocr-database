caption: The cellular niche sustains the phenotypically diversity of cancer stem cells.
  (A) CSCs play fundamental roles in cancer, including contributing to tumor heterogeneity,
  and immune evasion, promoting migration and recurrence, and driving chemoresistance.
  (B) The CSC niche is supported by the tumor components, stroma, immune infiltrate,
  and tumor microenvironment. (C) Cell-cell interactions define spatial cancer niches
  and contribute to the phenotypically diversity of CSCs and cellular heterogeneity.
  (D) CSC phenotypic states are modulated by an array of factors, including intrinsic
  factors like WNT and TGFB pathway activation, cell-cell interactions, cellular plasticity,
  and the cellular niche. Figure created with BioRender.com.
