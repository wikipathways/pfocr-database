caption: Key miRNA signature as predicted from bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
  RNA-seq data in patients with COVID-19(A) Predicted upstream regulators determined
  by IPA consistent with the transcriptional response from differentially expressed
  genes (FDR < 0.05; outer ring) in patients (n = 13). Eight miRNAs were among the
  key regulators in response to COVID-19 (inner ring).(B) Major biological responses
  from dysregulation of this eight-miRNA signature drive immune- and inflammatory-related
  pathways, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction determined by IPA.(C) Pathway regulation
  by miR-2392 from BALF RNA-seq data determined by IPA.
