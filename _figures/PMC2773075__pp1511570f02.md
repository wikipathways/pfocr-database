caption: 'The network composed of reactions exhibiting variable flux in response to
  changing ATP demand (see also  and ). Colors correspond to the description in ;
  reactions shown with broken lines indicate those that at some level of ATP demand
  carry no flux (see ). The reactions shown in black are also included, although their
  fluxes do not respond to changing ATP demand (in these solutions); they form a single
  connected block whose start and end points are in the block of variable reactions.
  The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate relationships between the reactions
  of primary metabolism, and to this end a number of simplifications have been made:
  metabolite names are the common abbreviations, not Biocyc identifiers; the transhydrogenase
  reaction at the top of the figure is composed of the NAD and NADP variants of icosanoyl-CoA
  synthase (EC 2.3.1.119) operating in opposed directions (see “Discussion”); the
  oxidative limb of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is shown as a single lumped
  reaction; and CO2, oxygen, currency metabolites, the electron transport chain, and
  oxidative phosphorylation are omitted. Additional fixed outputs from the system
  are not shown (see “Discussion”).'
