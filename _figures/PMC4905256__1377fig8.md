caption: Hierarchical protein binding at the rDNA locus and intersections with SUMO.
  Fob1 binds to the replication fork barrier (RFB) and is responsible for localizing
  Net1, Tof2, and Top1 to this site (; ). Tof2 increases the interaction of Fob1 with
  the rDNA (thin arrow). Net1 is also localized to the transcription initiation region
  through binding to RNAPI. Sir2 depends on Net1 for localization to the rDNA ().
  Tof2 can also bind Cdc14 and the cohibin complex (; ; ; ). The cohibin complex binds
  to and localizes cohesin, condensin, the Src1-Nur1 complex, and Ulp2 (; ; ; ). Experimentally
  determined sumoylation of individual proteins is indicated by an encircled “S” next
  to the protein. RNAPI contains 14 subunits; 12 of these subunits are sumoylated,
  including Rpa190, which is the specific subunit bound by Net1 (; ). ARS, autonomously
  replicating sequence.
