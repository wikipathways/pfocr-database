caption: Model describing TLS across CPD in human cells. In human normal cells polη
  carries out efficient and relatively accurate TLS across CPD. In human XPV cells,
  TLS across CPD is performed by a back-up system in 2-polymerase reactions, in which
  polκ or polι perform insertion opposite the CPD, whereas polζ performs the extension
  step. This pathway is less efficient and more mutagenic than the polη-dependent
  pathway. A possible 3-polymerase mechanism is also presented. See text for details.
