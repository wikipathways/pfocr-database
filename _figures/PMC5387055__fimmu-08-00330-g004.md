caption: Immunometabolic regulations mediated by coinhibitory receptors in innate
  immune cells and cancer can impact T cell immune responses. Metabolic signaling
  mediated by the programmed death-1 (PD-1):programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway
  in cancer or myeloid cells of the tumor microenvironment might subsequently alter
  T cell metabolic reprogramming and immune function due to nutrient competition and
  by generating metabolic products with detrimental effects on T cell immune function.
  PD-1 and PD-L1 might activate glycolysis in cancer cells, whereas PD-1 ligation
  might inhibit glycolysis of monocytes/macrophages in the context of cancer.
