caption: The schematic of HIV-1’s innate immune evasion in CA-dependent pathway. After
  the invasion, CA protects the HIV-1 virus after the invasion from innate immune
  recognition and ensures it translocates into the nucleus to complete its lifecycle.
  Alteration of CA formation and CA- interaction by genetic mutation or CA inhibitor
  could induce host cell IFN secretion through the cGAS-STING signal pathway. Disrupting
  CA interaction with CypA, CPSF6 will stimulate NF-κB activity, and downstream IFN
  response leads to defects in HIV-1’s infectivity. Furthermore, CA-CypA interaction
  is essential for counteracting with Trim5α to keep the CA core intact and inhibit
  Trim5α-induced immune response through the NF-κB signal pathway.
