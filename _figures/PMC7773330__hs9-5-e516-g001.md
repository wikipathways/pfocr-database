caption: Mechanisms of resistance to Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitors. Resistance
  to JAK2 inhibition may develop via acquisition of JAK2 resistance mutations (genetic
  resistance) or via the formation of JAK family heterodimers of JAK2 with JAK1 or
  tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), which functionally sustain downstream signaling (adaptive
  resistance). Intrinsic resistance to JAK2 inhibition may relate to compensatory
  activation of downstream signaling pathways as, for example, the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway due to bypass activation via receptor tyrosine kinases
  as, for example, platelet-derived growth factor receptor. The figure was created
  with BioRender. PI3K = phosphoinositide 3-kinase; STAT = signal transducer and activator
  of transcription.
