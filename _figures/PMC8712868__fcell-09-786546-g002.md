caption: FGF18 acts on FGFR on the cell membrane and regulates chondrocyte proliferation
  through MAPK, ERK1/2 and hedgehog signaling pathways. The reduction of mitochondrial
  membrane potential and the leakage of cytochrome C into cytoplasm are closely related
  to cell apoptosis. FGF18 can maintain the balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission
  (MFF), restore the function and morphology of mitochondria, enhance the phosphorylation
  of PI3K and AKT, thereby depolymerizing TSC1/TSC2 and activating mTOR, ultimately
  inhibit apoptosis and autophagy of chondrocytes. After cytochrome C is released
  from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, it activates caspase-3 and causes apoptosis
  through a cascaded amplification reaction. FGF18 inhibits IL-1β-induced caspase3
  activation through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, enhances the expression of Bcl-2,
  and exerts an anti-apoptotic effect. Protein phosphatase1 (PHLPP1) is widely presented
  in chondrocytes during OA, and inhibits the proliferation of chondrocytes, differentiation,
  and matrix production. The decrease of PHLPP1 enhances the activity of Akt, and
  then down-regulates the transcription factor FoxO1 expression, followed by the increased
  expression of FGF18, and the enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1 or ERK2 through FGFR,
  and finally accelerates the proliferation of chondrocytes (The figure is made by
