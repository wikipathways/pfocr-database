caption: A single branched pathway result for tryptophan, demonstrates how branching
  schemes can become quite complicated. The bold edges indicate the initial seed pathway,
  the normal solid lines are the branches attached in the first stage of the algorithm
  and the dotted line is a final branch added after the initial branches were attached.
  Compound nodes are ovals, mapping nodes are boxes and reactions are diamonds. The
  numbers are to assist the reader in following the pathway, as the figure is split
  into half to fit on the page.
