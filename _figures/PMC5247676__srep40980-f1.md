caption: LanCL1 may catalyze the conjugation of GSH to protein-bound Dha, followed
  by peptidase-mediated digestion of the reaction product (proteolysis sites indicated
  by curled lines) to form lanthionine. Transamination to form lanthionine ketimine
  has been documented previously. An enamine tautomer can also be formed (not shown).
