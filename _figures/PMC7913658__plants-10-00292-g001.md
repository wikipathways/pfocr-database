caption: Plant sterol synthesis pathway starting with the conversion of 2,3 oxidosqualene
  to cycloartenol by oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC). OSC enzymes are classed as cycloartenol
  synthase (CAS) or lanosterol synthase (LAS) depending on their first cyclic product.
  The main sterol synthesis pathway in plants is indicated by multiple arrows representing
  several enzymatic steps with detailed information on β-sitosterol conversion to
  stigmasterol by a C22-desaturase. The most common end sterols in plants are highlighted
  in gray. The lanosterol synthesis pathway, well known for animal and fungi is indicated
  by dotted lines as lanosterol synthesis has been reported in plants, although lanosterol
  was not detected in this study.
