caption: Schematic representation of the possible interactions between Se metabolism
  and lipid metabolism. Selenoprotein P (SELENOP) has shown an ability to de-activate
  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibit insulin signaling in liver and skeletal
  muscle (). AMPK limits cholesterol synthesis in the liver, thus representing a potential
  node through which SELENOP may regulate cholesterol. SELENOP and other selenoproteins
  can be degraded to produce selenocysteine (Sec) residues that are further metabolized
  through a process involving selenocysteine lyase (SCLY) to produce Se. This Se can
  then be used for de-novo synthesis of selenoproteins. The antioxidant activity of
  selenoproteins may promote the negative regulation of insulin signaling by preventing
  the oxidative inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) by hydrogen
  peroxide (H2O2). PTP1B de-phosphorylates the IR and insulin receptor substrate (IRS),
  which, in turn, reduces protein kinase B (AKT)-mediated lipogenesis. Through affecting
  this pathway, SCLY could work to limit lipogenesis ().
