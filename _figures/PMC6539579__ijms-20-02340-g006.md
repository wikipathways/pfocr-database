caption: Strategies for targeting c-Myc. Several therapeutic agents were developed
  to inhibit c-Myc by different mechanisms. These include inhibitors that block Myc
  expression, including bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) bromodomain inhibitors
  such as JQ-1, OTX015, and TEN010. Other inhibitors reduce c-Myc stability and functions
  by interfering with c-Myc-Max interaction (10074-G5 and omomyc) or inhibit its binding
  with DNA (NY2279 and Mycrol1, 2, 3). Some inhibitors interfere with c-Myc target
  genes such as miR-26a and F-box and WD repeat domain-containing (FBXW)7. In CSCs,
  inhibition of c-Myc-dependent metabolic reprogramming through CD44 variant-dependent
  redox stress, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogenase (NADPH) production
  via decreasing glutaminolysis, or FBW7 gene-dependent c-Myc degradation pathway
  is regarded as a promising strategy.
