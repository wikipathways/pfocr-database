caption: 'Molecular regulation of osteoclast survival: In WT osteoclast, both RANK
  and Ras-Raf-1-MEK-ERK signaling contribute to cell survival, but survival is mainly
  regulated by Src-Cbl-PI3K pathway. When Cbl–PI3K interaction is lost due to the
  YF mutation, Ras mediates increased PI3K signaling. Inhibition of Ras activity decreases
  Ras-Raf-1-MEK-ERK signaling in both WT and YF osteoclasts, but survival is affected
  only in YF osteoclasts, since Src-Cbl-PI3K mediated AKT activation remains intact
  in WT osteoclasts in spite of Ras inhibition.'
