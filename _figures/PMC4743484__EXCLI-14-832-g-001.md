caption: TGF-ß, activin or nodal ligands binds to a type II receptor dimer, which
  then recruit a type I receptor dimer. The type II receptor phosphorylates serine
  residues of the type I receptors leading to activation of the protein. Activated
  type I receptors phosphorylate its downstream targets SMAD2/3 (i.e. R-Smads) which
  then form hetero-oligomeric complexes with the co-SMAD, SMAD4 and translocate to
  the nucleus to bind DNA at sequence-specific DNA motifs to regulate gene expression.
  The heteromeric SMAD complex also interacts with various co-regulators for transcriptional
  activation or repression. SMAD7 can inhibit the phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3.
  BMP signalling functions in a similar pattern. BMP6 and BMP7 bind to their type
  II receptor which then recruits the type I receptors, ALK3 or ALK6. In contrast,
  BMP2 and BMP4 bind first to their type I receptor which then recruits the type II
  receptor ACTRII or BMPRII. Activation of the receptor complex results in phosphorylation
  of the receptors and then leads to phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 which form hetero-oligomeric
  complexes with the SMAD4. The heteromeric SMAD complex translocate to the nucleus
  to bind DNA at specific DNA motifs and thereby regulate BMP-target genes. Co-regulators
  might interact with this complex and modulate BMP-mediated gene expression. SMAD6/7
  can inhibit the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 and subsequently inhibit BMP pathway.
