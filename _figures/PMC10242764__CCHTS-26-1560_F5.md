  the herb-NRR; the pink diamond represents the compounds in NRR; the green circle
  represents the targets, with a green border representing core targets; the gray
  rectangle represents KEGG signaling enriched from 19 overlapping target proteins
  of NRR associated with arrhythmia, with gray border representing the KEGG pathways
  enriched from 5 core targets.
