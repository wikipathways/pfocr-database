caption: 'Gene expression, proteome, and metabolome contrasts in young and immature
  tissues, assigned to the central carbon metabolism. Gene expression and proteomics
  data are provided as log2FC (fold change) but for clarity of the figure only provided
  if either proteome or transcriptome changed by more than logFC of 0.5. Metabolite
  data is provided as concentration fold change. Omics data are highlighted in green,
  red, and yellow. Green: Increase in gene expression, protein accumulation, or in
  metabolite concentration in mature tissues compared to immature tissues. Red: Decrease
  in gene expression, in protein accumulation, or in metabolite concentration in mature
  tissues compared to immature tissues. Yellow: Up and down regulation of genes/enzymes
  that characterize isoforms in different tissues and organelles. Gray: No statistically
  significant difference between tissues. Numbers refer to enzymatic step reactions.
  Numbers (1–34) refers to enzymatic step reactions. 1, hexokinase; 2, glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase; 3, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (cytosolic and plastidial
  isoforms); 4, enolase (cytosolic and plastidial isoforms); 5, pyruvate kinase (cytosolic
  and plastidial isoforms); 6, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; 7, citrate synthase
  (microchondrial and glyoxomal isoforms); 8, isocitrate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial);
  9, malate dehydrohenase (mitochondrial, plastidic, glyoxysomal and cytosolic isoforms);
  10, nitrate reductase; 11, glutamine synthetase; 12, glutamate synthase; 13, ribose
  5-phosphate isomerase; 14, histidyl-tRNA synthetase; 15, 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase;
  16, glycine hydroxymethyltransferase; 17, tryptophan synthase; 18,transaminase;

  acid aminotransferase; 22, valyl-tRNA synthetase; 23, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase

  synthetase (acetate-CoA ligase); 26, fatty acid synthase (acyl-ACP synthases); 27,
