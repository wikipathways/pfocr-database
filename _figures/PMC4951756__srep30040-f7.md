caption: D2 receptor antagonists (e.g. haloperidol) and D2 receptor partial agonists
  (e.g. aripiprazole) bind with the dopamine D2-like receptor, resulting in the phosphorylation
  of Akt and the subsequent phosphorylation of GSK3β probably via biasedly antagonising
  D2R-mediated β-arrestin2, together with the activation of the Dvl-GSK3β-β-catenin
  pathway (A), which might contribute to the therapeutic effect of antipsychotics.
  On the other hand, antagonism of the D2-like receptors by aripiprazole and haloperidol
  leads to increased expression of GABAA (β-1) receptors probably via the activation
  of PKA activity (indicated as a dashed arrow) (B), and enhanced CREB1 activity via
  the activation of GSK3β activity and PKA activity (C), both of which might also
  be involved in the therapeutic actions of antipsychotics.
