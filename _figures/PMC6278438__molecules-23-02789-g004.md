caption: (A) pathway of miRNA processing to regulate mRNA decay. Pri-miRNA precursors
  are transcribed and processed before assembling into a macromolecular complex containing
  the Drosha/DGCR8 heterodimer to release a ~70 nt pre-miRNA hairpin in the nucleus.
  The pre-miRNA hairpin is exported to the cytoplasm by XPO5 and Ran-GTP. In the cytoplasm,
  the pre-miRNA hairpin is cleaved by Dicer to generate the mature ~22 nt miRNA duplex
  that associates with Ago2 leading to the formation of the RNA-induced silencing
  complex (RISC). Activation of mRNA decay results in base-pairing of the guide strand
  to the mRNA 3’ UTR and recruitment of mRNA decay factors such as GW182; (B) Activation
  of the DNA damage response by DDRNAs also involves miRNA processing factors Drosha
  and Dicer that are required to generate small ~20–35 nt RNAs from the sequences
  around the site of damage. Formation of DNA damage foci and recruitment of DNA damage
  factors requires DDRNAs, Drosha, and Dicer.
