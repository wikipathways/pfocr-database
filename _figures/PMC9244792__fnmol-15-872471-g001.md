caption: Pyroptosis mechanism. Classical pathway is activated by caspase-1, it is
  activated by inflammasome, toxins, virus and bacterium through inflammasome; non-classical
  pathway is activated through caspase-4/5/11 by direct binding to LPS. After caspases’
  cleavage on GSDMD or GSDME, the N-terminals translocate on cell membrane resulting
  in pore formation. Chemotherapy drug and TNF-α acts on caspase-3, and GSDME is activated
  directly by caspase-3 and GzmB or indirectly by caspase-8.
