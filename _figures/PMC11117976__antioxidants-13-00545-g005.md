caption: 'M2 macrophage polarization. Step 1: Activation of STAT-6/PPAR-γ by IL-4:
  IL-4 stimulates PPARγ activation through STAT-6, which inhibits PKC-α and diminishes
  NOX-mediated ROS generation via the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Furthermore, the activation
  of STAT-6 and IRF-4 produces H2O2, which is essential for starting the transcription
  of M2-specific genes. IL-4 increases Arg-1 activity, shifting metabolism from nitric
  oxide (via iNOS) to ornithine, supporting tissue repair, via STAT-6/PPAR-γ [63,64].
  Step 2: Nrf-2 Activation and Oxidative Stress Defense Enhancement: Nrf-2 regulates
  expression of SOD-1 and Trx systems by binding to antioxidant response elements
  (AREs), enhancing defense against oxidative stress and promoting M2 gene transcription
  [63,64]. SOD-1 assists in the activation of STAT-6 and IRF-4 by producing H2O2,
  which is essential for starting the transcription of M2-specific genes. Additionally,
  the overexpression of SOD-1 leads to a decrease in iNOS gene expression and a reduction
  in NO synthesis, while simultaneously promoting arginase I expression and increasing
  urea production These alterations affect collagen synthesis and play a role in the
  development of fibrosis [65,66]. The Trx system actively inhibits ROS production,
  whereas the Prx system specifically inhibits NO production. This targeted inhibition
  is crucial for reducing oxidative stress and supporting cellular repair mechanisms,
  thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization [67,68]. Step 3: NOX-2 Downregulation
  and Lysosomal Enhancement: IL-4 directly downregulates NOX-2 and enhances expression
  of cathepsins S and L, improving phagosome protein degradation efficiency [62].
  Step 4: Activation of PI3K/PKBPathway by PGE-2: PGE-2 activates the PI3K/PKB pathway,
  further suppressing NOX-2 activation and aiding M2 polarization [69]. (M2: M2 type
