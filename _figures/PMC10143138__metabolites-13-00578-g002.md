caption: Osteoblast cellular cholesterol homeostasis. (A) Exogenous LDL uptake in
  osteoblast via LDL-LDLR endocytosis is an important source of CE and TG for lysosomal
  hydrolysis. Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL)-mediated lipid catabolism leads to the release
  of free cholesterol and free fatty acids (FFA) for further cellular needs. (B) Cholesterol
  formation begins with acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), two molecules of which are converted
  into acetoacetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT). The first step in the
  mevalonate pathway from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA to mevalonate is catalyzed
  by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), which is the main target of statins. This figure was
  created using Biorender.com (accessed on 13 March 2023).
