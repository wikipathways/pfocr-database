caption: CCL17 and CCL22 which were secreted by TAMs activated the PI3K/AKT pathway
  in tumor cells via CCR4. Specifically, AKT phosphorylation inactivated IP3R, and
  induced calcium aggregation in the ER, which further activated ATF6 and increased
  GRP78 expression. Excessive GRP78 bond with MRP1 and pulled it on cytomembrane,
  therefore, the membrane translocation of MRP1 was the direct cause of TAMs-CM-induced
  5-FU efflux and resistance.

  by promoting MRP1 membrane translocation via an intercellular CXCL17/CXCL22–CCR4–ATF6–GRP78
