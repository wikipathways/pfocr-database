caption: (a) Multiple insect viruses encode virus suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) that
  can interfere with the siRNA pathway at different steps. Some VSRs can block activation
  by hiding dsRNA from the Dcr-2 while others can bind siRNAs or interfere with RISC
  directly. (b) Apoptosis triggered in infected cells can interfere with viral replication
  and is targeted by diverse virus-encoded mechanisms such as inhibitors of apoptosis
  proteins (IAPs) or caspase inhibitors of the p35 family (p35 and p49). (c) In insects,
  translation is inhibited in virus-infected cells by activation of HRI-like eIF2α
  kinases. Baculoviruses encode PK2, a homolog of eIF2α kinases, that can prevent
  phosphorylation of eIF2α and translation inhibition. (d) Regulation of the insect
  IMD/NF-κB pathway by the immunomodulatory cytokine Diedel is important to control
  both the antiviral response as well as homeostasis. Different insect viruses encode
  a co-opted version of this endogenous inhibitor of the IMD pathway. See text for
  more details.
