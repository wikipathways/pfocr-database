caption: Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a TA- and amphetamine-activated
  GPCR, at a DA synapse. Amphetamines enter the presynaptic neurons through competitive
  reuptake inhibition of the DA transporter (DAT) and by diffusion through presynaptic
  membranes, causing release of DA by way of vesicular monoamine transporter-mediated
  exocytosis and reverse transport through the DAT. Both amphetamines and endogenous
  TAs activate TAAR1, leading to adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation and downstream stimulation
  of PKA/PKC. Like D2R, TAAR1 also signals via a G-protein independent, β-arrestin2-dependent
  pathway involving the protein kinase B (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3)
  β signaling cascade. In the case of striatal D2R, β-arrestin 2 has been shown to
  enhance the interaction between AKT and protein phosphatase 2A thereby resulting
  in AKT inactivation and increased activation of GSK-3. D2s are also GPCRs which
  when attached to TAAR1 form heterodimeric complexes. Interaction of TAAR1 with D2R
  reduces β-arrestin 2 recruitment to D2R and the ability of D2R to decrease cAMP
  production, whereas β-arrestin 2 signaling is enhanced, resulting in reduced GSK-3
  activation. In addition, phosphorylation of the DAT through TAAR1-stimulated activation
  has been shown to lead to DAT internalization, which may result in reduced DA uptake
  under certain conditions.
