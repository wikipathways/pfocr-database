caption: Decarboxylation reactions in redox pathways and relation with peroxide metabolism.
  Glycolysis yields pyruvate in the cytosol and enters mitochondria; in mitochondria
  pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
  catalyze oxidative decarboxylation reactions that convert NAD+ to NADH and generate
  CO2. The reducing equivalents of NADH and FADH2 feed the mitochondrial electron
  transport chain in a process that finalizes with the four-electron reduction of
  molecular oxygen to water. In the course of electron transport there is small percentage
  leakage for the monovalent reduction of oxygen to O2•- that in turn dismutates enzymatically
  to H2O2. Mitochondria can emit H2O2 to extramitochondrial compartments. In the cytosol,
  glucose can also follow the pentose phosphate pathway, which in its oxidative phase
  yields NADPH and CO2, the latter by the action of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.
  The reducing equivalents of NADPH can be used for a number of redox reactions, most
  notably in the context of this review for the formation of O2•- (and subsequently
  H2O2) via the membrane bound NADPH oxidases (e.g., toward the phagosome), •NO synthesis
  by NOS, and peroxide detoxification (in GSH- or thioredoxin-based peroxidatic systems).
  TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
