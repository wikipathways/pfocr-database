caption: Schematic representation of GH signaling pathway after virus infection. The
  interactions between GH and cytokines are ambiguous and contradictory but the ghrelin
  can induce GH secretion. After virus infection, the host cells increase the expression
  of ghrelin. Ghrelin stimulates the pituitary gland to increase GH secretion. Meanwhile,
  cells can also increase GH secretion by autocrine or paracrine pathways. Then GH
  binds to the GHR receptor on the cell membrane, and activates JAK/STAT, MAPK and
  PI3K signaling pathways, thus regulating the individual immune response. Moreover,
  GH combined with GHR to activate the IGF1by inducing the JAK2/STAT5 in response
  to immune response.
