caption: a | Autophagy in dead tumour cells promotes dendritic cell (DC)-mediated
  cross-presentation via increasing production of autophagosome with tumour antigen.
  In addition, neighbour of BRCA1 gene 1 protein (NBR1) mediates major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) class I degradation via the autophagy pathway, resulting in reduced
  MHC class I surface expression in pancreatic cancer cells and abolished cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition. b | Autophagy blockade or deficiency results in
  accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumour cells and subsequent mitochondria
  and genome damage, thereby releasing DNA into cytoplasm. Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)
  senses cytosolic DNA, activates inflammasome signalling and promotes tumorigenesis
  via recruiting immunosuppressive immune cells. c-GAS–stimulator of interferon genes
  (STING) can also sense cytosolic DNA, stimulate type I interferon responses and
  enhance antitumour immunity via recruiting CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells.
  c | Hypoxia induces autophagy in tumour cells through hypoxia-induced factor 1α
  (HIF1α). Elevated autophagy mediates degradation of granzyme B in tumour cells,
  which is secreted by activated CD8+ T cells and NK cells, and blocks CTL-mediated
  and NK cell-mediated tumour killing. Meanwhile, autophagy inhibits chemokine CCL5
  expression, which recruits the NK cell migration to the tumour microenvironment
  (TME). MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor cell; TAA, tumour-associated antigen; Treg
  cell, regulatory T cell.
