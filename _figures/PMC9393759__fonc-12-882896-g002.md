caption: 'Macrophage-targeted treatment strategies on study. Macrophage-targeted treatment
  strategies include: inhibition of macrophage and macrophage precursors recruitment
  targeting the CSF1-CSFR and CCL2-CCR2 pathways, depletion of tumor associated macrophages
  (TAMs) (like biphosphonates), repolarization of TAMs to an antitumor phenotype,
  inhibition of tumorigenic factors and mechanisms promoted by TAM and enhancement
  of macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing or phagocytosis. The repolarization of
  TAMs is mediated by stimulating the costimulatory receptor CD40, Toll-like receptor
  7 (TLR7) or administrating anti-CD47 drugs. Anti CR3 factors enhance the innate
  activity of macrophages, favoring the antitumoral phenotypes. Ang2 and the respective
  receptor TIE2 constitute another druggable pathway favoring antitumor responses
  and inhibiting the functions of TAMs.'
