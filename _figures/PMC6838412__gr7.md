caption: 'Schematic diagram of the proposed mechanisms in SS MSG. The miR-1248 plays
  a dual role by (1) associating with RIG-I and activating IFN-β synthesis and (2)
  down-regulating both DAK and ITPR3 expression in a canonical microRNA pathway. Reduction
  of DAK leads to an increase of IFN-β production, while reduction of ITPR3 impairs
  SOCE signaling and results in decreased salivary flow. The endogenous level of miR-1248
  in acinar cells can be elevated from exogenous miR-1248 transported by the exosomes
  secreted from infiltrated lymphocytes. ER: endoplasmic reticulum; PLC: phospholipase
  C. M3R: muscarinic receptor 3.'
