caption: 'Modulation of the flavonoid pathway under calcium fertilizer application.
  Log2FC (D/C) levels of DEGs are presented at Turn-CK, Ripe-CK, Turn-T, and Ripe-T,
  respectively, from left to right. Notes: The bold red font in the gene name indicates
  genes that were upregulated during the veraison period and downregulated during
  maturity; the bold purple font are genes that were downregulated during both veraison
  period and maturity periods; the bold green font are genes that were upregulated
  during both veraison period and maturity periods; genes that are in bold blue were
  downregulated during the veraison period and genes that were upregulated during
  maturity; those that are marked in bold dark red are genes that were expressed unchanged
  during the veraison period and upregulated during maturity. ‘CK’ refers to control
  samples (not treated), ‘T’ refers to treated samples, ‘Turn’ refers to veraison
  stage, and ‘Ripe’ refers to the mature stage. (For interpretation of the references
  to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
