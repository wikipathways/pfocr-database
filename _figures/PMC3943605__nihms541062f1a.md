caption: 'A) ACTH binds to its specific seven-domain transmembrane receptors (MC2R),
  leading to activation the Gas protein, which will activate adenyl cyclase (AC) and,
  therefore, cAMP production. After binding of cAMP to PKA regulatory subunits, the
  catalytic subunits are released and activated. The free catalytic subunit (C) then
  phosphorylates CREB at serine 133, which is translocated to the nucleus and activates
  the transcription of target genes. cAMP is inactivated by phosphodiesterases, allowing
  the PKA tetramer to reassembled, terminating its activity.B) Anomalous activation
  of cAMP pathway in adrenocortical disease. At cell membrane level: 1. activating
  mutations of protein Gas lead to constitutive activation; 2. expression of “illicit”
  G protein-coupled receptors cause pathway activation in response to unusual ligands.
  Inactivating mutations of PKA regulatory subunit PRKAR1A or LOH at the gene locus
  lead to constitutive catalytic subunits activation. Inactivating mutations of phosphodiesteraes
  (PDE) lead to an increase in cytoplasmatic cAMP levels, augmenting PKA activity.'
