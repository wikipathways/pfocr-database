caption: Genetic methods to suppress adult neurogenesis. (A) Administration of Ganciclovir
  (GCV) to mice carrying the transgene (GFAP-TK or Nestin-TK) results in death of
  dividing cells expressing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK). HSV-TK
  produces toxic metabolites that disrupt DNA synthesis and result in the death of
  dividing cells. (B) In the Nestin-CreER/NSE-DTA mouse, Nestin-CreER drives the expression
  of a tamoxifen (Tam)-inducible form of Cre in NSCs and a Cre-inducible diphtheria
  toxin fragment A (DTA) is engineered into the locus of the neuron-specific enolase
  (NSE) gene. Activated CreER leads to the recombination of loxP sites and removal
  of the STOP cassette upstream of the DTA gene, thus allowing the expression of DTA
  from the NSE promoter. (C) In the Nestin-rtTA/TRE-Bax mice, doxycycline (Dox) activates
  the rtTA protein, which binds to seven TetO sequences (TRE) to drive the expression
  of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, which activates the apoptosis pathway in NSCs.
