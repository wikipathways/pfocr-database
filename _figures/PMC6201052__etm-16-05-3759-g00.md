caption: 'Schematic representation of the association between F− and pH regulation
  during amelogenesis. F− accelerates crystal formation and produces a large number
  of protons, which may lower the pH of the microenvironment. The decrease in pH upregulates
  the expression of ion transporters in ameloblasts in two ways: Directly and indirectly,
  via a currently unknown signaling pathway. These two processes lead to the excessive
  release of HCO3−, which may neutralize the pH to form a microenvironment favoring
  crystal nucleation. However, when the decrease in pH levels is severe, more F− diffuses
  into cytoplasm of amelobalsts along the concentration gradient formed by the release
  of protons, overwhelming the buffering capacity of ameloblasts. The retention of
  F− induces a series of pathological changes, including the dysregulation of ion
  transportation. The decrease in pH levels cannot be neutralized, which causes the
  abnormality of crystal formation, leading to dental fluorosis.'
