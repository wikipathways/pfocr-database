caption: 'The mechanism of exercise on oxidative stress of the diaphragm in COPD.
  Exercise may reduce ROS production, regulate diaphragm oxidative stress level, and
  improve diaphragm structure and dysfunction in COPD through: (1) activating the
  NRF2 signaling pathway and upregulating HO-1 and other antioxidant enzymes; (2)
  inhibiting the activity of NOX and reducing the expression of TNF; and (3) activating
  the mitochondrial-related AMPK/PGC-1α/UCP2 pathway. HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; NOX,
  NADPH oxidase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α;
  UCP2, uncoupling protein 2.'
