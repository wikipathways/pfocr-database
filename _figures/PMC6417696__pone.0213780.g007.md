caption: Lipid reserves are mobilized during early lactation, NEFA reach the blood
  stream and enter the hepatocyte where they are oxidized to acetyl-CoA in the β-oxidation
  pathway. The increase in Acetyl-CoA levels leads to acetylation of protein lysine
  residues. Lower levels of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) in the liver of G1 cows may contribute
  to the increase in protein acetylation (AcK-Prot) in the G1 group with respect to
  the G0 group. Protein lysine acetylation impacts negatively on electron transport
  chain activity (ETC), Krebs cycle and β-oxidation resulting in an impaired oxidation
  of NEFA that are re-esterified to triglycerides (TG), giving rise to fatty liver.
