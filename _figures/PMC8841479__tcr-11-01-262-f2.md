caption: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells are highly sensitive to the
  depletion of cystine and glutamine. Erastin inhibits system XC-, thus blocking the
  import of cystine, causing glutathione (GSH) depletion and glutathione peroxidase
  4 (GPX4) inactivation. Uncontrolled lipid peroxidation generates reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), ultimately resulting in ferroptosis. Furthermore, recent studies
  have found that ccRCC cells rely mainly on glutamine for adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) generation. Ferroptosis becomes more severe as ccRCC cells use up glutamine.
