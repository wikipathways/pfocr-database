caption: In the BM microenvironment, a complex network of cells, ECM, and secreted
  molecules work in concert to regulate the normal and leukemic stem cells. Cytokine
  and chemokine signaling and integrin ligation can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway
  which regulates several downstream components that are involved in regulation of
  the normal and leukemic stem cells survival and proliferation. The novel therapeutic
  agents indicated in the Figure, which target the leukemic cells in their surrounding
  microenvironment, or interactions between leukemic cells and BM stromal cells, have
  been shown to destroy LSC without adversely affecting normal stem cell self-renewal.
