caption: 'Proteins and protein isoforms in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle,
  pentose phosphate pathway, galactose metabolism, and glutamine metabolism pathways.
  In total, out of 79 proteins, 50 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS and quantified
  by SRM (highlighted in green), nine proteins were identified, but not quantified
  (highlighted in pink), five proteins were not identified, but quantified (highlighted
  in blue), and 15 proteins were neither identified, nor quantified (not highlighted).
  Enzymes in the presented energy metabolic pathways catalyze: (1) conversion of glucose
  or galactose through glycolysis into pyruvate, which is used in the TCA cycle to
  produce NADH; (2) conversion of glutamine to 2-oxoglutarate, which is used in the
  TCA cycle (3) generation of NADPH and conversion of glucose or galactose through
  the pentose phosphate pathway into ribulose 5-phosphate or erythrose-4-phosphate,
  used in the synthesis of nucleotides and aromatic aminoacids, respectively.'
