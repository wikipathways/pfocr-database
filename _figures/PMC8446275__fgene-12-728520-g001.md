caption: Repair outcomes after a Cas9-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) and strategies
  for enhancing precise repair. (A) Cas9, targeted by a sgRNA, induces a DSB in a
  precise region of the genome. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), promoted by 53BP1,
  is the default repair pathway. Through the coordinated action of factors such as
  DNA-PK and LIG4, NHEJ repairs the DSB by re-joining the DNA-ends in an error-prone
  manner. This results in small insertions and deletions (indels) that can generate
  a loss-of-function allele if a frameshift is generated. If end-resection occurs
  [mediated by CtIP and MRE11-Rad50-NBS1 (MRN)], microhomology-mediated end-joining
  (MMEJ), or homology-directed repair (HDR) function. The repair outcome following
  MMEJ-mediated repair can vary, although this can be predicted since it depends on
  regions of microhomology and leads to larger indels. HDR, mediated by factors such
  as BRCA1 and RAD51, relies on a repair template and hence is error-free, leading
  to precise genomic alterations. (B) The use of ssDNA oligonucleotides (ssODN) as
  donor templates has also been developed to harness HDR. This process is called single-stranded
  templated repair (SSTR). SSTR is generally more efficient due to the asymmetry of
  the Cas9-DNA complex, which leads to the release of the PAM-distal non-target strand.
  Therefore, a rational design of the ssODN donor template complementary to the strand
  that is first released improves precise editing. (C) The inhibition of NHEJ has
  been used to improve precise repair following Cas9-breaks. 53BP1 inhibition through
  ubiquitin variants, dominant negative forms, or expression of factors that displace
  53BP1, has proven useful. Small molecule inhibitors against DNA-PKcs and LIG4 have
  also been used. (D) Cell cycle manipulation has also proved useful for enhancing
  HDR. HDR (depicted in blue) is only active in S/G2/M phases, contrary to NHEJ (depicted
  in orange), which is active throughout the cell cycle. Strategies to improve HDR
  have included the use of compounds (such as XL413, aphidicolin, and nocodazole)
  to block cells in HDR-permissive phases. A Cas9-CtIP fusion allows end-resection
  (and subsequently HDR) to occur throughout the entire cell-cycle. PAM, protospacer
  adjacent-motif.
