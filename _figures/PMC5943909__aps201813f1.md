caption: Summary of the proposed mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression
  by PNX in mHypoA-GnRH/GFP and mHypoA-Kiss/GFP-3 cell models. GPR173 has been identified
  as the cognate receptor for GPR173 (PNX-R). PNX increases the phosphorylation of
  CREB, suggesting that it activates a Gαs protein and the cAMP/PKA pathway. PKA was
  shown to be necessary to induce changes in GnRH, Kiss-1, Oct-1 and C/EBPb mRNA expression
  by PNX. This pathway may therefore mediate the hypothalamic changes in mRNA expression
  by PNX (from Treen et al).
