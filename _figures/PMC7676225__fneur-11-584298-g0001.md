caption: The metabolic effect of Wnt promotes the absorption of glucose in the neuron
  by increasing the affinity of the GLUT3 transporter for its substrate. In the same
  way, it increases the activity of the enzyme hexokinase, one of the proteins regulating
  the glycolytic rate. Therefore, there is an increase in the ATP concentrations,
  a metabolic substrate for the regulation of channels responsible for the excitability
  of the cell membrane. The activation of the Fzd receptors by its Wnt ligand causes
  the decoupling of β-catenin degradation complex (GSK3β, CK1, APC, and β-catenin
  proteins), preventing their degradation by the proteasome and generating an accumulation
  in the cytosol and its translocation to the nucleus, where it binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancer
  binding factor family transcription factors, thus promoting the transcription of
  genes related to lipid metabolism and cell differentiation, among others.
