caption: Glucose enters β-cells via GLUT-2 transporters, and its metabolism generates
  an increase in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio (1), which leads to closure of ATP-dependent
  potassium (K+ATP) channels, generating plasma membrane depolarisation (2). Calcium
  enters through voltage-dependent calcium channels and binds to calmodulin (CaM),
  and this complex activates CaMKKs/CaMKs signalling cascades (3). Upon its activation,
  CaMKK phosphorylates CaMK4, which translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates
  the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) on serine 133 (4). This phosphorylation
  is responsible for CREB activation which, in turn, binds to the cAMP response element
  (CRE) on the IRS-2 promoter to increase IRS-2 gene expression (5). IRS-2 maintains
  β-cell mass by stimulating proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (6). In addition
  to this CaMK4/CREB-mediated pathway, calcium/calmodulin-induced activation of CaMK2
  and CaMK4 stimulate insulin secretion and insulin gene expression (7) and this results
  in an autocrine/paracrine activation of the β-cell insulin signalling cascade (8),
  which ultimately increases β-cell proliferation and reduces apoptosis, at least
  in part, in an IRS-2-dependent manner (9).
