caption: New molecular targeted drugs. Based on the molecular mechanism of COPD, many
  new molecular targeted drugs have been developing in recent years. Antioxidants
  scavenge ROS and inhibit oxidative stress in the lungs and reduce cellular damage
  and inflammation. Protease inhibitors restore the balance between protease and anti-protease
  by inhibiting. proteases. Cytokine and chemokine inhibitors play an important role
  in reducing the inflammatory response. Adhesion molecule inhibitors can block inflammatory
  cells, which continuously migrate from the blood vessels to the tissue. PDE4 inhibitors
  inhibit PDE4 production to increase the cAMP activity in cells. In the occurrence
  and development of COPD, the signalling molecules, such as NF-κB, MAPK, PI3K and
  VIP help regulate inflammation and airway remodellings, and represent plausible
  targets for the development of therapeutic candidates. Candidate drugs include inhibitors
  of p38MAPK, NF-κB and PI3K, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The inhibitor
  of EGFR reduces internalisation of EGFR but does not reduce mucin stores. TGF-β
  inhibitor reduces a fibrotic airway remodelling and downregulates MMP expression,
  Endothelin inhibitors prevent the progression of pulmonary hypertension in COPD.
  Adenosine A2a receptor inhibits neutrophil superoxide production, phagocytosis,
  adhesion and cytokine release. Macrolides reduces the inflammation of COPD by regulating
  the PI3K/Akt-Nrf2 pathway and control transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1
  to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines. PPAR agonists exert antioxidant
  and anti-inflammatory effects by down-regulating NF-κB and other pro-inflammatory
  transcription factors
