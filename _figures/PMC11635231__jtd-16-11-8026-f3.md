caption: The role of FXR in four lung diseases. (A) FXR alleviates lung injury by
  inhibiting the inflammatory response and oxidative stress, and maintaining the integrity
  of endothelial and epithelial barriers. (B) FXR protects the lung from LI/RI by
  regulating related p-AMPKα/Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress, Cyt-C-mediated apoptosis,
  and the NF-κB mediated inflammatory response. (C) FXR inhibits or promotes pulmonary
  fibrosis by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, and alveolar EMT or mediating
  BA-induced EMT, lung fibroblast activation, and the production of α-SMA and vimentin.
  (D) As a proto-oncogene, FXR promotes the occurrence and development of lung cancer
  by establishing an immunosuppressive microenvironment, inhibiting the transcription
  of PD-L1, and activating the Jak2/STAT3 signaling pathway to promote the migration,
  invasion, and angiogenesis of NSCLC cells. Created with BioRender.com. FXR, farnesoid
