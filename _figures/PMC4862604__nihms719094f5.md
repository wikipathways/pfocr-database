caption: 'After formation of a DSB, DNA resection results in two single-stranded overhangs
  and exposure of DNA homology. SSA uses annealing of large DNA sequences of homology,
  which leads to deletions of large fragments of DNA. By contrast, alt-EJ requires
  pairing of only small homologous DNA sequences (microhomologies), which can lead
  to deletions and/or insertions depending on how the repair is orchestrated: (i)
  When the annealing is stable the overhanging noncomplementary flaps are trimmed
  by the endonuclease complex and repair is completed by fill-in DNA synthesis and
  ligation, resulting in deletions of the DNA regions flanking the original break.
  (ii) Alternatively, translesion polymerases (such as Polυ) may extend the annealed
  sequences using untemplated error-prone DNA synthesis resulting in realignment at
  newly created micro-homologous sequences. Then the repair is completed by flap trimming,
  gap-filling DNA synthesis, and ligation, which results in a deletion plus insertion
  junction. (iii) Flap trimming followed by untemplated DNA error-prone synthesis
  can generate new regions of microhomology leading to insertions of DNA sequences.
  Abbreviations: alt-EJ, alternative end joining; DSB, double-strand break; SSA, single-strand
  annealing.'
