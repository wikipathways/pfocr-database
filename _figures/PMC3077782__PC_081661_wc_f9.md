  positive feedback loop formed by LWD1 and PRR9 according to this study is highlighted
  in blue. The LWD1/PRR9 loop is also involved in regulating the light input pathway.
  The reciprocal regulations between LWD1 and oscillators are marked with black lines
  according to the promoter activity data collected in this study. Solid and dashed
  lines represent direct binding and indirect regulation, respectively. Positive and
  negative regulations are marked with arrows and blunt-ended arrows. Gray lines indicate
  two known negative feedback loops composed of CCA1/LHY, PRR9, and TOC1 reported
  previously.
