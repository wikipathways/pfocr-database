caption: 'The involvement of inflammatory cells in bAVM growth. Macrophages release
  VEGF, which regulates the development of ECs and vessel sprouting. By generating
  matrix proteases, macrophages degrade ECM to create a guiding pathway for proliferation
  and migration of ECs and facilitating vascular branching. Macrophages also have
  crucial role in recruitment of pericytes around new blood vessels by expressing
  high levels of PDGFB. Macrophages through triggering autocrine feedback loop of
  COX2, PGE2, EP2-NF-kB-COX2 results in bAVM prograssion. Likewise, macrophages express
  TLR4, which binds to myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and
  leads to the generation of complex with IRAKs and activation of inhibitor kappa
  B kinase β (IKKβ). This process leads to translocation of NF-κB into the macrophage
  nucleus and overexpressing genes involved in inflammation. ECs: endothelial cells,
  COX2: cyclo-oxygenase 2, PGE2: Prostaglandin E2- EP2: prostaglandin E receptor subtype
  2, MyD88: myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, PDGFB: Platelet-derived
  growth factor B, TLR4: toll-like receptor 4, IRAKs: IL-1R-associated kinases, IKKβ:
  inhibitor kappa B kinase β.'
