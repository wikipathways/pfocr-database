caption: Functions of the glycocalyx. (A) Role of the glycocalyx in adhesion of platelets
  and inflammatory cells such as leukocytes. Multiple endothelial glycoproteins such
  as selectins, integrins, and cell-adhesion molecules (VCAM-1) are docked within
  the glycocalyx. As such, the glycocalyx prevents their activation and thereby prevents
  inflammatory processes. (B) Process of releasing nitric oxide (NO) from the endothelium
  in response to shear stress. Shear stress is sensed by heparan sulfate, which is
  bound to glypican. Glypican then attaches to the transmembrane CD44. This mechanical
  signal in response to shear stress is translated into an intracellular signaling
  process resulting in the release of NO from endothelial caveolae. The released NO
  induces relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in vasodilatation.
  Moreover, superoxide dismutase is bound to heparan sulfate and can convert oxidative
  O2– into O2, thereby regulating the level of free radicals. (C) Role of the glycocalyx
  in maintenance of the BBB. Within cerebral microcirculation, the glycocalyx is also
  part of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is further composed of tightly connected
  endothelial cells encapsulated by pericytes that are surrounded by astrocytic feet.
  At the luminal side of the endothelium, the glycocalyx layer prevents large molecules
  from passing the BBB. Since the glycocalyx is negatively charged, the BBB is not
  permeable to negatively charged cells such as platelets and red blood cells, or
  proteins like albumin. (D) Anti-coagulant function of the glycocalyx, as it docks
  anti-coagulant molecules like anti-thrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor and
  the von Willebrand factor (vWf). In states of increased shear stress, the vWf is
  elongated and able to bind platelets that in turn attach to the endothelium and
  initiate coagulation. AT, anti-thrombin; BBB, blood-brain barrier; ET, endothelin;
