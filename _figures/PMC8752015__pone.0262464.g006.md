caption: 'Regions of the brain implicated in PD motor disorders whose neurons contain
  mercury are shown in red. The classical pathway of PD motor pathophysiology is included
  in the upper half of the diagram. Neurons in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc),
  striatum, thalamus and motor cortex contain mercury, but not those in the subthalamic
  nucleus (STN), or the globus pallidus interna (GPi) and externa (GPe). Mercury in
  the locus ceruleus could decrease noradrenaline output to the substantia nigra,
  leaving it more susceptible to toxicants, and to blood vessels, making the blood-brain-barrier
  more permeable to circulating toxicants. Mercury in neurons of the cerebellar cortex,
  dentate nucleus (DN) and inferior olivary nucleus could underlie types of tremor
  in PD (lower left in diagram). Also shown (bottom left) is a stimulatory pathway
  from the subthalamic nucleus via the anterior pontine nuclei to the cerebellar cortex
  and dentate nucleus (both containing mercury), that could cause a resting tremor.
