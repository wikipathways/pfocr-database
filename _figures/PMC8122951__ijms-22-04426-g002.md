caption: 'Leukemia-induced alterations within the B-ALL BM niche. B-ALL cells modify
  the BM microenvironment by cross-talking with MSCs, vascular endothelial cells,
  osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. Left part, from top to bottom: MSCs produce high levels
  of Activin A (ACTA). Activin A down modulates (green down arrow) CXCL12 production
  (green dots) by MSCs, promotes CXCL12-driven migration of B-ALL cells while decreasing
  healthy HSC migration in response to CXCL12. B-ALL blasts, through RANKL secretion,
  can activate osteoclasts, causing bone resorption. The interaction of B-ALL cells
  with MSCs through a periostin/integrin pathway induces the release (red up arrow)
  of CCL2 (pink dots). Upon contact, MSCs can promote chemoresistance in B-ALL cells
  through VCAM-1, Notch3/4, cadherins, and Galectin (Gal)3-dependent pathways. BMP4
  is another TGFβ family member abundantly produced by leukemia-conditioned MSCs,
  which contributes to shaping the BM immune microenvironment: it can promote the
  generation of suppressive dendritic cells (DCs) and the polarization of M2-type
  macrophages. Increased microvessel density (MVD) is a typical feature of the B-ALL
  niche, possibly as a consequence of vascular endothelial cell-mediated neoangiogenesis
  in response to pro-angiogenic stimuli, including VEGF and bFGF. Central part, from
  top to bottom: The BM microenvironment is rich (red up arrow) in inflammatory mediators
  such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-1β, and TNFα, in part directly secreted by B-ALL blasts
  themselves. CX3CL1 (yellow dots), highly represented (red up arrow) in the B-ALL
  BM, can be secreted by endothelial cells stimulated by inflammatory mediators and
  by MSCs. Non-conventional (NC) monocytes, abundant in the PB, are possibly recruited
  through the CX3CR1/CX3CL1 axis into the BM and can differentiate in CD163+/CD206+
  M2-type macrophages under the polarizing action of CCL2, C5a, and BMP4. Expansion
  of immunosuppressive granulocyte-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSC) and Helios+
  regulatory T cells (Treg) further define the B-ALL BM immune infiltrate and, by
  secretion of TGFβ can contribute to inhibit effector T cells, while positively impacting
  on angiogenesis. Right part from top to bottom: Decreased levels (blue down arrow)
  of PTX3 possibly contribute, by unleashing Complement cascade activation, to high
  C5a levels (red up arrow). CXCL1 (purple) and CXCL8 (gray dots) are abundant (red
  up arrow) in the B-ALL BM and can be secreted by MSCs interacting with B-ALL cells.
  CCL2, produced by leukemia-conditioned MSCs and by endothelial cells stimulated
  by inflammatory mediators, can recruit macrophages and, in concert with C5a, can
  induce their M2-like polarization. B-ALL cells expressing high cortactin and myosin-IIA
  levels can extravasate into blood vessels and disseminate in response to chemotactic
  stimuli to generate extramedullary metastases. MSCs further support B-ALL cells
  by transferring mitochondria by means of tunneling microtubes (TNT). Created with
