caption: 'A highly interconnected network was identified based on novel de novo mutations
  identified in this study (Note: one additional de novo missense mutation was recently
  identified in ). Gene ontology annotation of the genes in this network suggests
  involvement of the insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (GIGYF1, GIGYF2,
  GRB10; accession GO:0048009), which has been previously implicated in the development
  of ASD . Furthermore, GIGYF2 and ZNF598 form part of the m4EHP mRNA binding complex
  and have widespread translational repression roles, especially in the brain and
  lungs . Red stars: de novo LGD mutations (frameshift, stop-gained, splice-site);
  Blue stars: de novo missense mutations; Purple star: CNV deletion.'
