caption: Sensing and signalling of heat stress at the chloroplast. Exposure to moderate
  heat has various direct consequences for chloroplast proteins and membranes, which
  trigger rescue pathways. In the thylakoidal membrane, LHCII proteins aggregate,
  which leads to an excess of its major lipid constituent, the non‐bilayer prone glycerolipid
  MGDG. As a consequence, a non‐bilayer structure (the HII phase) emerges, which consists
  of MGDG organized in hexagonally stacked tubules. The xanthophyll cycle enzyme,
  violaxanthin de‐epoxidase (VDE), recruits specifically to the HII phase in the thylakoid
  lumen, catalysing the synthesis of zeaxanthin (ZEA) from its precursors, violaxanthin
  (VIO) and antheraxanthin (ANT). The HII phase remains attached, which allows for
  free diffusion of the photoprotective xanthophylls to the thylakoid. VIPP1 and sHSP
  recruit to the thylakoid membrane under heat stress, as they recognize membrane
  packing defects. They protect thylakoid membrane and PSII integrity. Heat stress
  is signalled in the chloroplast by a rapid Ca2+ increase in the stroma which depends
  on the activity of the calcium sensor CAS. Furthermore, heat induces breakdown of
  the envelope desaturase FAD8, responsible for synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty
  acids. This causes an adaptive decrease in membrane desaturation. The isoprenoid
  biosynthesis intermediate MEcPP accumulates due to a high light/temperature‐induced
  bottleneck in the pathway. MEcPP, together with H2O2 resulting from excess excitation
  energy, and other stress‐induced molecules, serve as retrograde signals to regulate
  heat stress response genes in the nucleus
