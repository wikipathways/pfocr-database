caption: Generic Biosynthetic Pathways of Poly(β-L-Malic acids) (PMLAs) in Eukaryotic
  Cells.Glucose is transported into the cytoplasm where it is metabolized by glycolysis
  to produce pyruvate (green). Excess CO2 activates the reductive extramitochondrial
  pathway to generate malate (blue). When exogenous carbonates are absent, intramitochondrial
  malate formation via the oxidative pathway takes place in the mitochondrial matrix
  through either the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or the glyoxylate shunt (orange).
  Through either pathway, malates are polymerized to form PMLA in the cytoplasm (gray).
  A PMLA synthetase has been proposed that possibly combines the activities of a malyl-AMP
  ligase and an unknown PMLA polymerase, in conjunction with an auxiliary peptide
  or enzyme (e.g., spherulin 3b in P. polycephalum) [,].
