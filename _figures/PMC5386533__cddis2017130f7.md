caption: Model for Fluphenazine-induced hypoxia-specific cell death by potentiating
  the pro-apoptotic path of cellular stress-response pathways. Fluphenazine impairs
  lysosomal functions by interfering with ASMase activity. Sphingolipid accumulation
  induces ATF4 and CHOP. Incubation under hypoxia induces additional stress response
  and additionally activates HIF1 transcriptional activity. Both transcription factors,
  ATF4 and HIF1, express pro-survival as well as pro-apoptotic genes that must be
  balanced to determine cellular fate depending on the amount of stress received.
  Together, Fluphenazine and hypoxia treatment shift the cells' stress response toward
  apoptosis and cell death. However, either of these treatments alone is not sufficient
  to induce cell death and favors the pro-survival stress-response pathway. FP, Fluphenazine;
  C, ceramide; ASMase, acid sphingomyelinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum, SM, sphingomyelin
