caption: 'σE stress-response pathway. OMPs (blue) are synthesized in the cytoplasm
  and secreted to the periplasm by the Sec translocon. Periplasmic uOMPs are assembled
  into the OM by the BamABCDE complex, resulting in the formation of fOMPs. When the
  Bam-assembly pathway is compromised, uOMPs accumulate in the periplasm, and a YxF
  motif activates the DegS protease. DegS initiates the proteolytic pathway, and RseA
  (orange) is further degraded by the RseP and Clp proteases. σE (green) is released
  and activates expression from σE-dependent promoters. Up-regulation of σE-effectors
  (red) results in three arms of the response: down-regulation of translation of omp
  mRNAs by sRNAs, such as micA; increased assembly of uOMPs to fOMPs by the Bam complex;
  and increased degradation of uOMPs by DegP. Collectively, these three arms aim to
  decrease the levels of uOMPs in the periplasm.'
