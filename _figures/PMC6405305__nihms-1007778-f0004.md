caption: (A) Simplified version of the EMT network model of Steinway et al. The network
  includes multiple pathways, TFs, and crosstalks that are known to be involved in
  EMT and are used in multiple mathematical models reviewed here. (B) The model has
  an epithelial E and a mesenchymal M stable steady state in the absence of external
  signals. The colored valleys illustrate the attractor landscape. (C, D) External
  signals or attractor control interventions such as stable motif (SM) control or
  feedback vertex set (FVS) control, described in detail in the next section and ,
  can modify the attractor landscape so that only the E or M state is a stable steady
  state. (E) Hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal states arise in the model under certain
  perturbations (e.g. combined TGFβ induction and SMAD KO). (F) A signaling pathway
  can underlie the EMT decision making process through a noncanonical TF (blue edges
  and node outlines) and bypassing the canonical (known) TF core.
