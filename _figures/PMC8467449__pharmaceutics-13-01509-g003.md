caption: Cholesterol–intracellular and intratumoral metabolism. Cellular uptake of
  cholesterol is mediated by endocytosis of low density lipoproteins (LDL) via the
  LDL receptors (LDLRs), and partially trough HDL receptors (HDLRs), ore commonly
  known as scavenger receptor, Class B1 (SR-B1). LDLR levels in cells is tightly regulated
  by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and inducible degrader
  of LDLRs (IDOL). In endothelial cells, HDL is a chemotactic factor and signaling
  is mediated SR-B1 which is associated with (PDZ Domain Containing 1 (PDZK1) and
  sphingosine phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1PR1) a scaffolding protein, leading to
  phosphorylation of AKT1 (p-AKT1) which phosphorylates and activates nitric oxide
  synthase to produce nitric oxide (NO). Cholesterol can also be produced de novo
  in cells via the mevalonate pathway. Reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA
  (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate is controlled by 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A
  reductase (HMGCR), the enzyme targeted by statin drugs. Cholesterol efflux is facilitated
  by ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily A Member 1 (ABCA1) transporter. Once in the cell,
  cholesterol is involved in multiple functions including cell proliferation and androgen
  synthesis. Excess intracellular cholesterol can get esterified to cholesterol esters
  by sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1) and stored as lipid droplets. Broken and continuous
  arrows indicate regulation and metabolic steps respectively. Figure produced using
  Servier medical art [].
