caption: 'A. Each reaction in the network is linked to a protein and encoding gene
  through the gene-protein-reaction (GPR) relationship. Because each reaction in the
  network corresponds to a column in the stoichiometric matrix, simply removing the
  column association with a particular reaction can simulate gene knockouts. Thus,
  multiple KO simulations can be performed. For example, it is easy to delete every
  pairwise combination of 136 central carbon metabolic E. coli genes to find double
  gene knockouts that are essential for survival of the bacteria.B. The simplicity
  of altering inputs to change cellular growth environments and removing genes in
  silico allows one to perform simulations in millions of experimental conditions
  quickly. Even on a modest laptop computer a single FBA calculation runs in a fraction
  of a second, thus simulating the effect of all gene knockouts in E. coli central
  metabolism can be run in less than 10 seconds.C. Incorrect model predictions are
  an opportunity for biological discovery because they highlight where knowledge is
  missing. Targeted experiments can be performed to discover new content that can
  then be added back to a model to improve its predictive accuracy. Missing model
  content can be discovered using automated approaches known as ‘gap-filling’ () that
  query a universal database of potential reactions to restore in silico growth to
  a model.D. Gap-filling approaches have been used to discover new metabolic reactions
  in several organisms. E. coli: Two new functions for two classical glycolytic enzymes
  phosphofructokinase (PFK) and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) were discovered
  (red) (). Human: Gluconokinase (EC 2.7.1.12) activity was discovered based on the
  known presence of the metabolite 6-phosphogluconolactonate in the human reconstruction
  () (red). Yeast: Automated model refinement suggested modifications in the NAD biosynthesis
  pathway. Experiments demonstrated that a parallel pathway from aspartate thought
  to exist in yeast was not present ().E. False positive predictions can be reconciled
  by adding regulatory rules derived from high throughput data (), for example, a
  recent study was able to reconcile 2,442 false model predictions from the E. coli
  GEM by updating the function of just 12 genes (). Additionally, a false positive
  growth inconsistency in the metabolic model of S. Typhimurium was reconciled by
  updating regulatory rules for the iclR gene product’s transcriptional repression
  of aceA encoding isocitrate lyase. Transcriptional repression can also often be
  relieved via adaptive laboratory evolution. Such evolution drives experimental phenotypes
  to achieve model predictions. Several experimental studies have shown that an organism
  can evolve to achieve model-predicted optimal growth state ().'
