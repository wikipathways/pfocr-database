caption: Possible mechanisms of statin-induced muscle injury. The possible mechanisms
  of muscle damage caused by statins include lowering cholesterol to affect membrane
  stability, reducing protein isoprenylation to affect cell function, affecting lactate
  transporters to cause lactate accumulation in muscle cells, affecting the AKT signaling
  pathway to cause autophagy, activating the ubiquitin-proteasome system to cause
  protein degradation, inducing mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic reticulum dysfunction
  through oxidative stress and calcium ion imbalance to induce cell apoptosis, and
  immune-mediated anti HMGCR myopathy
