caption: L. gibbosa DEG transcriptional changes in the AR metabolic pathway. The enzymes
  in response to AR are represented in orange boxes, whereas the other metabolites
  are in grey boxes. For enzyme reactions, the arrows between two metabolites represent
  the directions of catalytic reactions. The expression patterns over the five time
  points of the genes encoding corresponding enzyme(s) are given above or under the
  arrows (based on the CK expression of each gene, set to 0). AR2 and AR3 represent
  metabolite production of AR under enzymatic action
