caption: Chemotherapy induces damages in chromosomal DNA in cancer cells. PARP serves
  an important role in maintaining genomic integrity and counteract with chemo-agent.
  In tumors with IDH mutation, cells are less capable of maintaining DNA repair mechanism,
  as deficiency in NAD+ metabolism deprives substrates for the BER pathway. Targeting
  PARP by olaparib significantly potentiates the therapeutic effect of TMZ in IDH
  mutant cells.
