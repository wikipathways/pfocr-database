caption: Metabolic mechanisms and functions of immune cells. Anti-tumor immune cells,
  such as effector T cells (including CD8+ T cells), NK cells, and M1-like macrophages,
  primarily rely on glycolysis for rapid energy supply to meet their high activity
  and quick response demands. Glycolysis not only supports ATP production but also
  provides intermediates for biosynthesis, enabling the secretion of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines like IFN-γ, IL-1β, and IL-6, which are crucial for tumor elimination and
  immune activation. In contrast, pro-tumor immune cells, including Tregs and M2-like
  macrophages, utilize OXPHOS as their dominant metabolic pathway. OXPHOS efficiently
  generates energy to sustain long-term immunosuppressive functions, facilitating
  the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, TGF-β, and IL-35, which
  promote tumor progression and immune evasion. These metabolic adaptations reflect
  the functional specialization of immune cells within the TME. (Created with BioRender.com)
