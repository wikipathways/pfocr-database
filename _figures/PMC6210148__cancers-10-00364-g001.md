caption: Model of the topoisomerase 1 reaction and its inhibition by camptothecin
  (CPT) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. (A,B) Top1 cuts a single
  strand of DNA to relax super-coiled DNA stress (A). CPT blocks the ligation step
  and, hence, induces toxicity during the subsequent S phase in association with replication
  stress (B). (C) PARP inhibitor sensitizes the cell to CPT by blocking multiple steps
  of the repair pathway. In this cellular background, apoptosis is induced more efficiently.
