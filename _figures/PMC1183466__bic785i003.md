caption: Numbers represent fold increase (↑) or decrease (↓) in mRNA expression as
  derived from microarray analysis (Cyp27a1 expression was measured by real-time PCR).
  +/− denotes unchanged expression. Only those genes represented on the Affymetrix
  chip are shown. Broken and dotted lines represent positive and negative regulation
  respectively. 1, 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; 2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase; 3, mevalonate kinase; 4, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase; 5, squalene
  synthase; 6, squalene epoxidase; 7, lanosterol synthase; 8, lanosterol demethylase
