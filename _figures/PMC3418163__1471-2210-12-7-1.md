caption: The two enzymatic pathways generating inorganic phosphate (Pi) as a result
  of LPA degradation. In the LPA → MAG → G pathway, lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs)
  dephosphorylate LPA resulting in the generation of equimolar amounts of monoacylglycerol
  (MAG) and Pi. MAG is further hydrolyzed by monoglyceride lipase (MGL), resulting
  in cleavage of the acyl moiety and the formation of glycerol (G). In the LPA → GP
  → G pathway, lysophospholipases (LPLs) catalyze the deacylation of LPA with the
  concomitant formation of glycerophosphate (GP). GP can be further metabolized by
  GP phosphatase (GPase) activity thereby generating equimolar amounts of Pi and G.
