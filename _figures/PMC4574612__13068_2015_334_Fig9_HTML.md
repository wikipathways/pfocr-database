caption: Full scheme of the lignin biosynthetic pathway in switchgrass suggested by
  the computational results of this study. All regulatory signals, i.e., universal
  product inhibition, substrate competition over CCR1, and 4CL inhibition are shown.
  The 4CL inhibiting agent is unknown and therefore denoted with X. 5-OH-ferulic acid
  might be a candidate for this role
