    The mechanisms of ferroptosis include lipid peroxidation and iron loading. The

    stimuli, and lipid peroxidation is highly related to antioxidant systems. Several
    antioxidant systems have been implicated in regulating ferroptosis, including
    the System Xc-GSH-GPX4 pathway, transsulfuration pathway, mevalonate pathway,
    FSP1-CoQ10 pathway, DHODH-CoQH2 pathway, and GCH1-BH4 pathway. STEAP3, six-transmembrane
