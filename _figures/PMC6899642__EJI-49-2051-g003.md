caption: Schematic of the mevalonate pathway, showing the sites of action of statins
  and other inhibitors. Statins inhibit the conversion of 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl‐CoA
  (HMG‐CoA) to mevalonate and thus inhibit the downstream synthesis of not only cholesterol,
  but also isoprenoid intermediates, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate (GGPP), which regulate posttranslational modifications of the small
  GTPase Ras and Rho families. Zaragozic acid A (ZAA), farnesyl transferase inhibitor
  FTI‐277, and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI‐298 block the synthesis pathways
  that split off from FPP in the mevalonate pathway. HA1077 blocks the pathway of
  Rho kinase (ROCK).
