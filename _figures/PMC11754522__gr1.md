caption: Ceramide biosynthesis pathways (created by Figdraw 2.0). Ceramides are central
  to sphingolipid metabolism and can be synthesized through three pathways. The condensation
  of serine and palmitoyl-CoA initiates the de novo synthesis pathway (blue box).
  Sphingomyelin can be hydrolyzed to produce ceramide (green box). Ceramide can be
  hydrolyzed to sphingosine and then reacylated back to ceramide in the salvage pathway
  (orange box). Alk-SMase, alkaline sphingomyelinase; CDase, ceramidase; CerK, ceramide
  kinase; CERT, ceramide transfer protein; DES, dihydroceramide desaturase; GBA, glucocerebrosidase;
  GCase, glucocerebrosidase; GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; SMase, sphingomyelinase;
  SMS, sphingomyelin synthase; SPHK, sphingosine kinase
