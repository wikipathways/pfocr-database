caption: Complement dysregulation in complement-mediated HUS Complement activation
  initiated by any of the three pathways (classical, alternative, or lectin pathway)
  leads to C3 activation and C3 convertase formation on C3-opsonized surfaces. C3
  activation through the alternative pathway of complement (APC) amplifies this response
  (APC amplification loop), culminating in pronounced C3 fragment deposition on complement-targeted
  surfaces (proximal complement). In the presence of increased surface density of
  deposited C3b, the terminal (lytic) pathway is triggered, leading to membrane attack
  complex (MAC) formation on the surface of target cells. Dysregulated or excessive
  complement activation mainly affects renal endothelial cells which show increased
  susceptibility to complement attack due to a deteriorating glycocalyx in pathologies
  such as CM-HUS (terminal complement). Complement alternative pathway dysregulation
  results from loss-of-function mutations in regulatory factors (Factor H, I, THBD/thrombomodulin,
  and vitronectin/VTN in aHUS) shown in red, gain-of-function mutations (C3 and Factor
  B) shown in green, and DGKE mutations shown in black, indicating the unknown effect
  on complement cascade.
