caption: The LuxS/AI-2 signaling pathway. The lsrACDBFGE genes are transcribed in
  an operon, whereas lsrK and lsrR are divergently transcribed. LsrB binds AI-2 which
  is then imported by the Lsr ABC transport system. Inside the cell, AI-2 is phosphorylated
  by LsrK and is thought to interact with LsrR, relieving the repression of the lsr
  operon.
