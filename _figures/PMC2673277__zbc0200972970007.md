caption: Model for the assembly of 14-3-3:Shc scaffolds. Stimulation with 50  ng/ml
  GM-CSF (GM) results in the activation of tyrosine kinases including JAK2  and Src
  family of kinases. Although we have shown that the activated receptor  constitutes
  a high order dodecamer  (), only two subunits of the  receptor are illustrated.
  JAK2 can phosphorylate Tyr577 of βc,  whereas Src family kinases can phosphorylate
  Tyr179 of  14-3-3ζ. The phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ on Tyr179  provides a docking
  site for the direct binding of the SH2 domain of Shc. The  14-3-3:Shc scaffold bound
  to Tyr577 of the βc subunit of the  GM-CSF receptor is specifically required for
  the activation of the PI  3-kinase/Akt pathway and the regulation of cell survival.
