caption: 'Schematic drawings of the neuronal signaling pathways of anorexigenic and
  anxiogenic-like action in goldfish. ODN and CCK-induced anorexigenic actions are
  mediated by α-MSH-signaling pathway, and the anorexigenic actions of NMU, PACAP,
  and α-MSH are mediated by CRH- and subsequent GnRH2-signaling pathways. CRH also
  evokes anxiogenic-like action. Abbreviations: NMU, neuromedin U; PACAP, pituitary
  adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide; ODN, octadecaneuropeptide; CCK, cholecystokinin;
  CRH, corticotropin-releasing hormone; α-MSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; GnRH2,
  gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2.'
