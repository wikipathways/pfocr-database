caption: In each ASJ neuron, GPCRs specific to food signals trigger a G-protein signaling
  pathway that activates the transmembrane guanylyl cyclase DAF-11 to increase cGMP
  production. GPCRs specific to pheromone (including the ascarosides ascr#8 and ascr#2)
  inhibit this activation. cGMP activates cGMP-dependent transcription pathways such
  as through the cGMP-dependent kinase EGL-4/PKG while also increasing calcium influx
  through CNG-gated channels such as TAX-2/TAX-4. The resulting calcium increase can
  both activate calcium-dependent transcription (such as through CMK-1/CaM-Kinase)
  and promote secretion of neuropeptides, which may include INS-6, in a process dependent
  on UNC-31/CAPS. Once secreted, these neuropeptides bind to receptors on the same
  ASJ and/or the other ASJ neuron and, upon reaching a certain threshold, triggers
  an autoregulatory positive feedback loop that further increases production and secretion
  of INS-6 from the ASJs. This positive feedback promotes commitment to exit the dauer
  state by causing an irreversible buildup of INS-6 production and secretion. INS-6
  then signals to downstream tissues that execute the relevant dauer exit gene programs.
