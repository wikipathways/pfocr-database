caption: p53/p21/pRb/E2F and p16/pRb/E2F signaling pathway. The INK4a/ARF locus encodes
  both ARF (alternate reading frame) and p16 protein. ARF could stimulate p53 through
  inhibition and degradation of MDM2 (mouse double minute 2 homolog). Activated p53
  transactivates p21, which, in turn, inhibits CDK2/cyclin E with the consequent inhibition
  of CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rb. Unphosphorylated Rb suppresses the function
  of the G1/S phase-promoting factor, E2F, and as a result, cells are subjected to
  proliferation arrest and DNA damage repair. Similarly, p16 can inhibit the CDK4-6/cyclin
  D complex thereby reducing Rb phosphorylation and subsequent downstream signal transduction
  pathways. Thus, cells will arrest in G1 phase and fail to complete the cell cycle.
  Bmi1, a polycomb group protein, is a transcriptional repressor of p16. Bim1 also
  has a potential inhibitory role on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [].
