caption: FNDC4 is elevated during cardiac I/R injury, which blocks the proteasomal
  degradation of HIF1α and subsequently activates HIF1α signaling pathway to inhibit
  cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In addition, FNDC4-mediated HIF1α activation increases
  the expression and secretion of FGF1 from cardiomyocytes to enhance the angiogenic
  capacity of endothelial cells in a paracrine manner to facilitate cardiac repair
  during I/R stress
