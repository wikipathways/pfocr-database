caption: The synthetic pathways of DHA‐containing GPLs (DHA‐GPLs) in mammalian cells.
  Since mammalian cells cannot synthesize ω‐3 FAs, dietary uptake of DHA or other
  ω‐3 FAs such as ALA is required to generate DHA‐containing GPLs. In the cells, DHA‐containing
  GPLs are formed by two independent pathways, the de novo pathway (Kennedy pathway)
  and the remodeling pathway (Lands’ cycle). In the Kennedy pathway, DHA is mainly
  incorporated into the sn‐2 position of PA by the action of LPAATs. PA is a common
  intermediate for all GPL synthesis, and DHA‐containing PA is converted to other
  DHA‐containing GPLs. Alternatively, DHA may be incorporated into GPLs by the concerted
  actions of PLAs and LPLATs in the Lands’ cycle. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
