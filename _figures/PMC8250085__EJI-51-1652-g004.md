caption: The role of inhibitors of the complement cascade in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
  SARS CoV‐2 initially affects the respiratory tract and the alveolar cells, via the
  ACE2 receptors. SARS‐CoV‐2 then may interact directly with MASP2, activating the
  lectin pathway. The classical and alternative pathways, which are integral parts
  of the innate antiviral response, are also activated and, in turn activate the C3
  fraction of complement, leading to the secretion of C3a and C5a. These anaphylatoxins
  trigger the cytokine storm, mast cell degranulation, and the activation of leukocytes
  and the infiltration of these cells into pulmonary alveoli. The complement cascade
  is also activated via DAMPs, and it renders the lungs more fragile, following the
  deposition of complement proteins. The inhibition of complement proteins could decrease
  the severity of pathological conditions in COVID‐19 patients. Adapted from ref.
