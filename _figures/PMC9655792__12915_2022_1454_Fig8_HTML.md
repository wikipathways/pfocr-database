caption: Working model of GTE4 function in regulating pathogen defense. In most circumstances,
  GTE4 facilitates gene expression, likely through interacting with transcriptional
  activators. Meanwhile, a small proportion of GTE4 may also interact with transcriptional
  repressors to suppress gene expression. In the case of pathogen infection, GTE4
  maintains high expression of ribosome biogenesis related genes, which play negative
  roles in defense response due to consumption of energy and resources. Meanwhile,
  GTE4 reduces JA content by binding and repressing JA biosynthesis gene OPR3. In
  the absence of GTE4, increased JA content activates PR1 expression through an unknown
  noncanonical pathway. Together, GTE4 negatively regulates immune response by both
  promoting plant growth and attenuating JA biosynthesis
