caption: The role of TRIB2 in the lung cancer cell, liver cancer cell, and leukemia
  cell proliferation. (A) TRIB2 promotes lung cancer cell proliferation by mediating
  the ubiquitination and degradation of IκB-α and C/EBPα via COP1 and TRIM21, respectively,
  and enhancing glucose metabolism via phosphorylating PKM2. MiR-206, miR-140, Let-7c,
  miR-511, and miR-1297 inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting TRIB2.
  Notably, miR-511 suppresses TRIB2 and inhibits the proliferation of radiation-resistant
  A549/R cells. (B) TRIB2 can be activated by the Wnt/TCF pathway through FOXA transcription
  and promote liver cancer cell proliferation by stabilizing YAP protein through β-TrCP.
  Additionally, TRIB2 negatively regulates Wnt activity and inhibits liver cancer
  cell proliferation by reducing TCF4 and β-Catenin expression through β-TrCP, COP1,
  and Smurf1. TRIB2 also maintains GPX4 expression through its interactions with PCBP2
  and PSMB5, protecting cells from oxidative stress and promoting liver cancer cell
  proliferation. Furthermore, it reduces intracellular iron levels and ROS production
  by degrading TFRC through β-TrCP, mitigating ferroptosis-related cell death. (C)
  In Imatinib and Doxorubicin-resistant CML cells, TRIB2 respectively acts on the
  c-Fos/miR-33a-5p/HMGA2 axis through the ERK signaling pathway and downstream product
  STAT3 by regulating ERK phosphorylation to promote cell proliferation. Afatinib
  inhibits AML cell proliferation by inhibiting TRIB2 and inducing caspase-3 cleavage.
  In drug-resistant AML cells, TRIB2 promotes cell proliferation through Bcl2. E2F1
  acts on C/EBPα by activating TRIB2 transcription and forms a feedback loop to promote
  the proliferation of AML cells. MiR-99a and miR-155 may promote leukemia cell proliferation
  through TRIB2. Hoxa9/Pbx3/Meis1 complex may promote AML cell proliferation through
  TRIB2. TRIB2 modulates p16, p19, and p21 through the MAPK signaling pathway, facilitating
  sustained leukemia cell proliferation after stress. Moreover, TRIB2 increases Cleaved
  caspase-3 by phosphorylating JNK, inhibiting AML cell proliferation. Created with
