caption: Representation of MyD88-dependent and-independent TLR4 signaling pathways.
  CD14 presents ligands such as LPS or RSV F protein to individual TLR4/MD-2 complexes,
  triggering them to dimerize and activate (; ). The TIR domains of the dimerized
  TLR4/MD-2 complex interacts with TIR domains of the adaptor protein TIRAP (), which
  then recruits MyD88 to initiate the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. This pathway
  results in NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine induction. Once the MyD88-dependent
  pathway has completed, the dimerized TLR4/MD-2 complex is internalized into an endosome
  (; ), a process that is thought to be at least partially mediated by CD14 and MD-2.
  Upon internalization, the adaptor protein TRAM interacts with the TIR domains of
  the dimerized TLR4/MD-2 complex and recruits TRIF, initiating the MyD88-independent
  (or TRIF-dependent) signaling pathway. The MyD88-independent pathway activates interferon
  regulatory factor (IRF3) leading to the production of type I interferons (IFN) and
  activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).
