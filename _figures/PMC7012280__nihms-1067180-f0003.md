caption: This diagram is a screenshot of the interface of the web-based curation platform
  (Noctua) for GO-CAM models. In this view, each molecular activity is represented
  by a box, and some of the properties in  (the active entity, the location and the
  target entity) are “folded” into that box. The beta-catenin destruction complex
  is not folded into its activity box, so that the constituent gene products (e.g.
  AXIN1) are visible. Noctua is available at http://noctua.geneontology.org (the URL
  for this model is http://model.geneontology.org/596ef51500000088).
papertitle: Gene Ontology Causal Activity Modeling (GO-CAM) moves beyond GO annotations
  to structured descriptions of biological functions and systems.
