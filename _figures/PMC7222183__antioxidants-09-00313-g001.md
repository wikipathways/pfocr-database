caption: Main mechanisms in ferroptosis. (A) General process of ferroptosis. Balanced
  levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant activity maintains
  an inactive ferroptosis cell death pathway; however, some disturbance in the players
  of this equilibrium could produce a ferroptosis activation. Two important components
  of ferroptosis are the process of transferrin (TF)-iron import and ferroportin (FPN1)
  export. Changes in iron uptake or iron export produce a suppression or activation
  of ferroptosis since the free iron pool is fundamental [,]. Ferroptosis may be enhanced
  through the process of ferritinophagy, by which ferritin is targeted by nuclear
  receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) and delivered to the lysosome for degradation in
  autophagosome [,,]. Consequently, a large quantity of iron can be rapidly released.
  Currently, it has been suggested that ferroptosis initiation might be triggered
  by an increase in free iron levels itself []. Iron increase/or accumulation induces
  the Fenton reaction which increases the production of ROS. Furthermore, the action
  of iron-dependent oxidases [], specifically lipoxygenase activity of 15-LOX (ALOX15)
  that oxidizes polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) phospholipids (PUFA-PLs) containing
  arachidonate or adrenate moieties, triggers the ferroptosis pathway [,]. In addition,
  increased activity of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), an
  enzyme that preferentially activates arachidonic (AA) and adrenoic acids (AdA),
  has been reported to increase ferroptosis [,]. Inhibition of glutathione peroxidase
  enzyme 4 (GPX4) [,] or glutathione (GSH) unavailability [,] produces lipid hydroperoxide
  accumulation that triggers ferroptosis. (B) Suggested mechanisms of ferroptosis
  in Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA). It has been observed increased levels of lipoperoxides
  and ROS in FRDA neurons. Furthermore, in these neurons, it has also been reported
  lower reduced GSH concentration and GSH homeostasis disturbance, respectively [,,].
  Controversial studies are reporting either normal or increased iron levels in the
  nervous system of FRDA patients (reviewed in []). Recently a study in FRDA patients,
  using magnetic resonance imaging, showed increased iron concentration in the extrapyramidal
  motor system compared with controls []. However, there is no information about distribution,
  location and redox state of the iron in cells from FRDA (indicated with “?”). Increased
  autophagic processes are related to FRDA in different models of disease [,], but
  there is no information about ferritinophagic activity. Further studies should be
  performed in order to unravel if this mechanism increases the iron content in FRDA
  cells. All these ferroptotic characteristics observed in FRDA may indicate that
  this kind of cell death may have a role in the physiopathology of this disease.
