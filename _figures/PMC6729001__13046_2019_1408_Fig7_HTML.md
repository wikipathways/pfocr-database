caption: The schematic model of METTL3 in regulating CRC. METTL3 methylate pri-miR-1246
  in its upstream, marking them for recognition and processing. Overexpression of
  METTL3 increases the level of miR-1246 by promoting the maturation of miR-1246 from
  pri-miR-1246. miR-1246 decreases the expression of anti-oncogene SPRED2, thus resulting
  in cell migration and invasion in CRC
papertitle: Upregulated METTL3 promotes metastasis of colorectal Cancer via miR-1246/SPRED2/MAPK
  signaling pathway.
