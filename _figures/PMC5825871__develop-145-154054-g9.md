caption: Role of Gpr161 in forelimb initiation, limb patterning and skeletal morphogenesis.
  (A) Gpr161 determines Gli3R formation prior to Shh expression preventing premature
  signaling. Premature activation of the Shh pathway might prevent forelimb bud formation
  by regulating Fgf10 expression downstream of Tbx5. (B) Gpr161 prevents ectopic Shh
  expression and Shh-regulated limb patterning in a cilia-dependent manner. (C) In
  the absence of Gpr161, continued slow proliferation of periarticular/round (PA)
  chondrocytes is mediated by cilia-regulated pathway/s. Proliferative signals and
  mechanisms underlying Gpr161-mediated inhibition of proliferation are currently
  unknown. (D) During intramembranous bone formation, Gpr161 blocks a cilia-generated
  signaling pathway inhibiting osteoblastogenesis, possibly by functioning in calvarial
  mesenchymal progenitors that precede Runx2 expressing pre-osteoblasts. The cilia-gener­ated
  pathway could be premature Ihh/Shh signaling. Stages of osteoblast differentiation
  are based on previous literature ().
