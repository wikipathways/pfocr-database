caption: NPPs are part of the extracellular nucleotide-metabolizing network. The concentration
  of nucleotides in the extracellular milieu is the net result of the release of nucleotides
  from cells, their synthesis by nucleoside diphosphokinases and adenylate kinases,
  and their hydrolysis by ectonucleotidases. The examples shown here apply to ATP,
  the prototype extracellular nucleotide. Members of the E-NTDPase family, also known
  as apyrases, generally act as ATP diphosphohydrolases and hydrolyze ATP to ADP +
  Pi, and ADP to AMP + Pi, or ATP directly to AMP + 2Pi. Individual members however
  display substrate preference. For instance, E-NTPDase-1 metabolizes equally well
  ATP and ADP, while E-NTPDase-2 prefers ATP as a substrate. ATP can be regenerated
  from ADP by nucleoside diphosphokinase or adenylate kinase. NPPs, at least NPP1-3,
  have a nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity and metabolize ATP directly to ADP +
  Pi or to AMP + PPi. The hydrolysis of AMP to adenosine by 5′-nucleotidase/CD73 completes
  the dephosphorylation pathway of ATP. Adenosine can be taken up by cells such as
  lymphocytes and be re-used for intracellular nucleotide synthesis (nucleotide salvage).
  Several ectonucleotide species can be expressed by a given cell type, but the relative
  abundance, sorting to specific membrane domains and substrate availability are ultimately
  responsible for the net outcome of the nucleotide metabolism at the cell surface.
