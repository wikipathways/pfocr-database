caption: Exosomal miR‐223 is involved in the regulation of chronic inflammation in
  skeletal muscle. Neutrophils, and pro‐inflammatory M1‐macrophages first clear away
  the damaged tissue and aggravate the muscle injury, accompanied by the infiltration
  of M2‐macrophages. M1‐macrophages and M2‐macrophages release different inflammatory
  factors correspondingly. In general, NF‐κB binds to its inhibitory protein (IκBs)
  in the cytoplasm and remains in an inactive state. When IKK is activated, IκB‐α
  can be phosphorylated to remove its inhibition on NF‐κB, and allow free NF‐κB transferring
  into the nucleus to play the role of the transcription factor to produce TNF‐α.
  The long‐term presence of pro‐inflammatory TNF‐α continuously activates the NF‐κB
  signaling pathway, which forms a vicious circle, eventually leading to chronic inflammation.
  MiR‐223‐mediated inhibition of IKK‐α (a target of miR‐223) in macrophages, inhibits
  the activation of the NF‐κB inflammatory pathway and reduces the production of pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF‐α, thus breaking the vicious circle of chronic inflammation.
