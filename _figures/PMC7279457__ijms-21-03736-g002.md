caption: 'Positioning Cx43 in the intercellular coupling by channels in the DC-T cell
  IS. An IS between an APC (particularly a DC) and a T cell that effectively promotes
  T cell activation contains a large number of signaling molecules and signaling events
  that converge in order to generate T cell functional responses. These signaling
  events include the activation signal produced by TCR-pMHC ligation (antigen recognition:
  signal 1), plus co-stimulatory receptor engagement (signal 2), and a polarization
  signal yielded by instructive cytokines released by the APC (signal 3). Calcium
  release activated calcium channels (CRAC), such as Orai; hemichannels such as those
  formed by Panx1 and Cx43; and Cx43 formed gap junctions (Cx43-GJs), are involved
  in the Ca2+- and ATP- (via purinergic P2X receptors) mediated signaling amplification
  required for antigen-dependent T cell activation. Although Ca2+ can diffuse through
  Cx43 channels, the current consensus is that inositol triphosphate (IP3) is the
  critical intercellular signal that modulates Ca2+ release from internal cellular
  stores, like endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and it is responsible for GJ-mediated Ca2+
  waves in other cell models. An increase in the levels of IP3 in T cells could be
  produced by the convergence of those generated by phospholipase C (PLC) activation
  and those acquired from DC via Cx43 (or other Cx isoform) channel-mediated communication.
  We called these signaling events ‘intercellular coupling by channels’ and considered
  them as signal 4 in a DC-T cell IS. In response to TCR and CD28 stimulation, Panx1,
  purinergic P2X receptors, CRAC, and Cx43 translocate to the IS. ATP released through
  hemichannels promotes autocrine/paracrine signaling via the P2X receptors and the
  entry of Ca2+ into T cell. Curved arrows indicate movement of molecules; dotted
  arrows indicate a signaling pathway; straight arrows connect concepts.'
