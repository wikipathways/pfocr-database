caption: Regulatory chain of HIF-1 signal protein degradation in relation to HBOT,
  ROS, HSPs and hypoxia. HIF-1 hypoxia inducible factor-1; HSPs heat shock proteins;
  PH VHL degradation pathway via prolyl hydroxylases and von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor
  protein; RACK, E3 UBIQUITIN degradation pathways through activated protein kinase
  C receptor and E3 ubiquitin ligase; up- and down-regulations are color-coded. Hypoxia
  directly stimulates HIF-1 gene expression, degradation of which is also oxygen dependent
  via PH vHL pathway. Other degradation pathways (RACK, E3 ubiquitin ligase) are oxygen-independent;
  however, they seem to be inhibited by ROS. HBOT does not interfere with HIF-1 synthesis,
  but it might contribute to its stabilization, not only through ROS-regulated pathways,
  but also via activation of HSP binding to HIF-1 that further stabilizes HIF-1 thereby
  increasing its intracellular levels.
