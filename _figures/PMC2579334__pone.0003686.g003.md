caption: Ingenuity analyses of micro-array data indicated a canonical pathway involving
  insulin signalling as significantly changed in muscle of the septic patients in
  comparison with age-matched controls. Gene descriptions can be found in . Red (and
  pink) means significantly increased gene expression and blue decreased. The ‘strength’
  of the colour is an indication of how up regulated the gene was (with darker red
  being more up-regulated). Grey is a highly connected gene (to the transcript network
  that is altered) but itself is not altered at the mRNA level. Blue/Red hybrids are
  genes identified in the data base where the protein is actually at least two different
  genes and 1 sub-unit is down, while the other is up.
