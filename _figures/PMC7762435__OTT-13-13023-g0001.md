caption: The IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. (A) In the classical IL-6 signaling pathway,
  IL-6 binds to mIL-6 on the cell membrane to form a complex, which induces gp130
  to form a heterohexamer, which then initiates the JAK/STAT3 pathway. (B) In the
  trans IL-6 signaling pathway, IL-6 complexes with sIL-6R, previously generated by
  variable splicing of the IL-6 mRNA or as a result of IL-6R cleavage by metalloproteinase
  (ADAM) 10/17 or meprin metalloproteinase α/β.,, The IL-6/sIL-6R complex then complexes
  with gp130 via intermolecular disulfide bonds. The Box-1 and −2 domains in the cytoplasmic
  domain of gp130 bind and activate JAK, which phosphorylates tyrosine residues in
  the cytoplasmic region of gp130. The phosphorylated pTyr-X-X-Gln motif on gp130
  (X = any amino acid) recruits the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain in STAT3., An adjacent
  JAK phosphorylates the conserved Tyr705 in STAT3, which then homodimerizes with
  another STAT3 via the SH2 domain. This dimer translocates to the nucleus, where
  it regulates expression of target genes.
