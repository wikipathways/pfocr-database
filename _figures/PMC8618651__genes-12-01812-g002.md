caption: 'The DDT pathways: Representation of the four DDT (DNA Damage Tolerance)
  pathways. Lesions in DNA may lead to fork stalling. The damaged site can be bypassed
  in a mutagenic manner by recruiting an error-prone (EP) trans-lesion synthesis (TLS)
  polymerase. This usually requires monoubiquitination of PCNA (by Rad6/Rad18, with
  a still ill-understood role for Rad5), although the recruitment can be independent
  of PCNA modification under some circumstances. Alternatively, an error-free (EF)
  repair pathway is controlled by PCNA polyubiquitination, allowing a homologous recombination
  event using the sister chromatid that may include fork reversal. In the absence
  of PCNA SUMOylation, the Srs2 helicase is absent, and an error-free, homologous
  recombination “salvage pathway” is activated.'
