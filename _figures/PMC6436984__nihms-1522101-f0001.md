caption: The NLRP3 inflammasome undergoes activation by a number of atherosclerosis-related
  stimuli including co-activation by cholesterol crystals, hypoxia, and disturbed
  flow. The activated inflammasome unleashes the activity of caspase-1, the converting
  enzyme that processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to their mature pro-inflammatory forms.
  IL-1β can in turn strongly induce production of IL-6, the major mediator of the
  acute phase response. IL-6 signaling through the canonical receptor on hepatocytes
  unleashed the acute phase response. Among acute phase reactants, fibrinogen and
  plasminogen activator inhibitor play causal roles in atherothrombosis. Therapeutic
  interventions exist or are under development to inhibit this pathway at all levels
  as shown on the left of the figure. IL-1 alpha, the sibling cytokine to IL-1 beta
  shares many of its actions, but has distinct biochemical and cell biological properties,
  and doesn not depend on the inflammasome for activation. CRP denotes C-reactive
  protein.
