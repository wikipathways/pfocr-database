caption: Schematic overview of the estrogen biosynthetic pathway. The rate-limiting
  step in estrogen production is mediated by cytochrome P-450 19A1 (CYP19A1), which
  codes for aromatase, and is colored in red in the grey box. CYP11A1, cytochrome
  P-450 11A1; CYP17A1, cytochrome P-450 17A1; CYP19A1, cytochrome P-450 19A1; HSD3B,
  3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases
