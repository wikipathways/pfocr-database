caption: Possible pathways leading to effector activation by A2B adenosine receptors.
  In MDA-MB-231, both activation of adenylyl cyclase as well as a PLC-mediated increase
  of intracellular Ca2+ was shown. The Ca2+ signal proceeds most likely via a Gq/11-mediated
  pathway. Pathways excluded in this study are shown in gray. For further details,
  see text.
