caption: Mast cell function in its physiological environment is affected by “extrinsic
  S1P” generated by cells other than mast cells (right side, dashed lines with arrows),
  and “intrinsic S1P” (S1P generated by stimulated mast cells; left side blue arrows).
  Crosslinking of the FcεRI by IgE/antigen in mast cells results in the rapid activation
  and translocation of SphK to the plasma membrane and the generation of S1P. This
  is mediated by the Src kinases Lyn and Fyn. Fyn is required for SphK1 and SphK2
  activation, whereas Lyn is required for the early phase of activity and membrane
  translocation (left panel). Fyn-dependent Gab2/PI3K activation, followed by PLD
  activation is required for SphK1 stimulation, while a not yet determined Fyn-dependent
  but Gab2-independent pathway is needed for full SphK2 activation. Our recent studies
  implicate SphK2, and not SphK1, in the influx of calcium following IgE receptor
  independently of IP3 generation, and thus affecting mast cell functions. S1P is
  secreted by activated mast cells to the extracellular media independently of their
  degranulation via an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter (). Furthermore, S1P
  is able to rapidly bind and activate its receptors S1P1 and S1P2 on the plasma membrane.
  S1P1 induces cytoskeletal rearrangements leading to the movement of mast cells towards
  an antigen gradient, while transactivation of S1P2 enhances the degranulation response.
  Mast cell secreted S1P can also promote inflammation by activating and recruiting
  other immune cells involved in allergic and inflammatory responses. Mast cell granules
  are illustrated as blue circles, and the process of degranulation as granules in
  contact with the plasma membrane emptying their content (smaller pink and blue dots).
  Mast cells may be affected by changes in circulating S1P by different mechanisms.
  It is possible that changes in S1P in the circulation affect the priming of S1P2
  in mast cells, which are found in close proximity to blood vessels, enhancing degranulation
  upon cell activation. Increases or decreases in extrinsic S1P levels might also
  induce the differentiation of mast cell precursors towards a more or less responsive
  phenotype, respectively. Constant exposure to higher or lower levels of S1P might
  also indirectly influence mast cell differentiation or function via mediators derived
  from other immune or non-immune cells that respond to the fluctuation in S1P levels.
