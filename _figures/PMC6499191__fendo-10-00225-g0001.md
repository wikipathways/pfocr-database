caption: Endocrine and pharmacological regulation of penile erection. In corpora cavernosa
  the effects of testosterone (T) are primarily mediated by its conversion into 5α-dihydrotestosterone
  (DHT) and its binding to the androgen receptors (ARs), localized within vascular
  endothelium and smooth muscle cells. The AR is a ligand-activated transcription
  factor acting on the genome. The genomic action of AR is modulated by a large variety
  of co-regulators, that fine-tune target gene expression by enhancing or restraining
  transcription. However, steroids, including androgens, have also membrane receptors
  responsible for non-genomic actions. The non-genomic T pathway involves the rapid
  induction of conventional second messenger signal transduction cascades (i.e., activation
  of protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and MAPK), leading to diverse cellular effects
  including smooth muscle relaxation, neuromuscular and junctional signal transmission,
  and neuronal plasticity. Nitric oxide (NO) is released from nitrergic nerve endings
  and from the endothelium in response to acetylcholine and to the shear stress due
  to increased blood flow. Subsequently, NO penetrates into smooth muscle cells and
  binds to soluble guanylate cyclases, which catalyze the conversion of guanosine
  triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP activates protein kinase
  G which phosphorylates and activates proteins that reduce the intracellular Ca2+
  concentration or the sensitivity to Ca2+, decreasing muscular tone. Phosphodiesterase
  type 5 (PDE5) is the predominant enzyme responsible for cGMP hydrolysis in vascular
  and trabecular smooth muscle. T regulates PDE5 expression and mediates clinical
  response to PDE5 inhibitors through a putative androgen response element (ARE) in
  human PDE5A1 promoter. Many interfering factors in the elderly (i.e., frailty, physical
  inactivity, and polypharmacy) may directly or indirectly block at multiple site
  the physiological pathways. Adapted from Aversa et al. (). NOS, nitric oxide synthase;
  GMP, guanosine monophosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; SSRI, selective serotonin
  reuptake inhibitors.
