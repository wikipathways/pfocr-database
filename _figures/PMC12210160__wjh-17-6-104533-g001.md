caption: 'Overview of the anti-hepatitis B virus hepatic innate immunity in hepatocytes.
  The viral components of hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be recognized by diverse pattern
  recognition receptors in hepatocytes, for example: HBV core protein in nucleocapsid
  can be recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 Located on cell membranes (a); the
  epsilon stem-loop structure in HBV pregenomic RNA can be recognized either by RIG-I-like
  receptors (RLRs); RIG-I and MDA5 in cytosol or by TLR3 Located on endosome membrane
  (b); the HBV double-strand DNAs can be recognized by DNA sensors like cGAS or IFI16
  (c). The recognition triggers the downstream antiviral innate response. HBV have
  evolved efficient strategies to counteract the innate response, including: (1) Downregulation
  of TLRs, damping the recognition of HBV infection; (2) Induce the production of
  IL-10 that can impair natural killer and T cell function; (3) Epigenetic downregulation
  of interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulating genes expression by recruiting the histone-methyltransferase
  EZH2 onto targeted gene promoters; (4) HBe binds to TRAM and Mal to disrupt the
  TLR2 signaling pathway; (5) The interaction of viral antigens (HBx, HBs and HBe)
  with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein disrupts RLRs signaling pathway;
  (6) HBV P protein binds to DEAD-box RNA helicase 3 and block its interaction with
  TANK-binding kinase 1/IκB kinase epsilon, subsequently inhibiting IFN-β production;
  (7) Inactive STING with viral antigens (e.g. HBV P protein) to disrupt DNA sensors
  pathway; and (8) HBx relieves the histone methyltransferase SET domain bifurcated
  histone lysine methyltransferase 1-associated transcriptional silencing of covalently
  closed circular DNA, thereby promoting viral replication'
