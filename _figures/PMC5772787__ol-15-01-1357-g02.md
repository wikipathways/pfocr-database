caption: Hypothetic schema of the data we obtained. Ovarian cancer cells that are
  detached from the primary site (the ovary) reprogram their metabolism from glycolysis
  to lipid metabolism. Accordingly, the expression levels of CD44 and c-kit decrease.
  During starvation, the expression level of CD44 further decreases, but that of c-kit
  increases. When ovarian cancer cells are exposed to IL-6 near the omentum, the expression
  level of CD44 further increases, but that of c-kit decreases. These changing patterns
  may contribute to maintaining an overall ‘CSC-like’ status. Indeed, the mTOR pathway
  is reactivated accordingly. This process was considered as an explanation of why
  ovarian cancer cells often metastasize to the omentum.
