caption: Model depicting stress-induced mutagenesis leading to the emergence of L-alanine
  prototrophic suppressor mutants. The L-alanine auxotrophic strain HYE032 senses
  the stress of L-alanine starvation, which leads to activation of a DNA-related metabolic
  pathway (Step 1). Subsequently, a genome-wide mutation(s) is introduced (Step 2)
  in a subpopulation of the cells. Some of the clones obtain, by chance, the ability
  to increase their intracellular level of pyruvate (Step 3), which provides HYE032
  cells with an adequate amount of L-alanine to proliferate (Step 4).
