caption: 'Autophosphorylation on the T-loop serine (S382 in WNK1, S335 in WNK4) activates
  WNK kinases. This process is inhibited by the Cl- ion binding to the Cl- sensing
  pocket. The plasma K+ level affects membrane potential (MP) and Cl- efflux via the
  ClC-Kb channel. Hypokalemia (↓[K]o) releases the Cl--sensing inhibition on WNK by
  hyperpolarizing MP, increasing Cl- efflux and reducing intracellular Cl- level ([Cl-]i).
  Hyperkalemia (↑[K]o) is supposed to do the opposite or inactivates NCC through an
  unknown SPAK/OSR1-independent protein phosphatase (PP) pathway (blue dashed arrow).
  Kir4.1/5.1 functions to maintain normal MP of distal convoluted tubule (DCT), together
  with the Na+, K+ ATPase and ClC-Kb channel. Inhibition of Kir4.1 results in a depolarized
  MP and increased intracellular Cl- concentration. Activated WNKs switch on SPAK/OSR1-NCC
  signaling through a phosphorylation cascade. Other kinases may phosphorylate NCC
  since Spak and Osr1 double knockout mice still preserved some phosphorylated NCC.
  KS-WNK1 may exert competitive inhibition on WNK1 through the interaction with WNK1
  downstream substrates. Red lines and blue lines denote stimulatory and inhibitory
  regulations on NCC, respectively. +P: phosphorylation; -P: dephosphorylation.'
