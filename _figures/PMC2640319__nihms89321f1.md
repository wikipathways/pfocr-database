caption: Insulin and amino acid signaling pathway leading to the stimulation of translation
  initiation. Activation of the insulin signaling pathway is initiated by the binding
  of insulin to its receptor. This activates the insulin receptor and insulin receptor
  substrate-1 (IRS-1), followed by the activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI
  3-K). Activated PI 3-K then stimulates the activation of phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase 1 (PDK-1) and protein kinase B (PKB). Phosphorylation of PKB inactivates
  tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2), thereby inducing the activation of mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR). Amino acids as well as insulin can activate mTOR, which
  exists in a complex with raptor and G protein β-subunit-like protein (GβL). Activated
  mTOR phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation
  factor (eIF) 4E binding protein-1 (4EBP1). Phosphorylation of S6K1 enhances the
  activation of ribosomal subunit S6 (rpS6), which increases the translation of specific
  mRNA. Phosphorylated 4EBP1 releases eIF4E from an inactive eIF4E·4EBP1 complex,
  allowing the formation of the active eIF4G·eIF4E complex, which mediates the binding
  of mRNA to the 43S ribosomal complex. Insulin signaling can be attenuated by protein
  tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B), which dephosphorylates the insulin receptor and
  IRS-1; phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), which inactivates
  PI 3-K; and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which acts on PKB and S6K1. An increase
  in adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels enhances AMP kinase activation, resulting
  in the activation of TSC1/2 complex and the decreased activation of mTOR.
