caption: The polyol pathway. In conditions of excess of glucose, as occurring in diabetes,
  glucose undertakes the polyol pathway to be converted to fructose through the consecutive
  action of aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase. This alternative pathway
  for the metabolism of glucose leads to the increase in fructose levels in tissues
  of diabetic patients and of the NADH/NAD+ ratio that contrasts GAP-dehydrogenase
  activity leading to accumulation of the triose phosphates GAP and DHAP, precursors
  of the dicarbonyls compounds glyoxal (GO) and methylglyoxal (MGO).
