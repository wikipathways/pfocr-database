caption: Summary of the current knowledge on egg perception, signaling and defense
  gene expression. Typical responses of plants to oviposition are shown. a In plants
  from the Brassicaceae family, eggs deposited on the leaf surface release elicitors
  that are either contained in the egg (lipid elicitor) or found in secretions coating
  the eggs (benzyl cyanide, BC). In Arabidopsis, after binding to the putative LecRK-I.8
  receptor, a lipid elicitor triggers the SA pathway that in combination with ROS
  activates the expression of defense genes, including PR1, and an HR-like necrosis.
  Egg-induced SA accumulation suppresses JA-dependent defenses against larvae from
  a generalist herbivore. In addition, BC triggers the expression of cell wall metabolism
  and transport genes that results in leaf surface chemical changes (gray) arresting
  egg parasitoids. In Brassica nigra and Arabidopsis, oviposition leads to induced
  resistance against larvae from a specialist herbivore. b In tomato, oviposition
  triggers H2O2 accumulation and expression of the JA-dependent PIN2. Eggs prime plants
  for enhanced JA accumulation and defense gene expression in response to further
  herbivory. c In pine and elm trees, a combination of wounding and proteinaceous
  elicitors present in secretions coating the eggs induce the emission of plant volatiles
  and the activation of stress and defense genes through the JA pathway. These terpenoids
  are synthesized by terpene synthase genes (TPS) and attract egg parasitoids. In
  addition, oviposition by pine sawfly Diprion pini decreases further larval performance
  and adult fecundity. d In pea, bruchins found in oviposition fluids of the bruchid
  weevil induce neoplasm formation (gray), activate gene expression and stimulate
  the accumulation of the defense compound pisatin. The induction of an OPDA-reductase
  gene (OPR) suggests that the JA pathway is involved in these responses
