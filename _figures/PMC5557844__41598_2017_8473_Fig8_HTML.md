caption: Suggested model to describe how drought-inducible OsbZIP23 regulates both
  light reactions and starch-sucrose pathway. Red boxes, genes showing diurnal expression
  pattern and up-regulated by drought; green boxes, diurnal genes down-regulated by
  drought. Genes encoding proteins interacting with OsbZIP23 are linked with circle-head
  lines; those encoding proteins regulated by bZIP23 are connected with triangle-head
  arrows. Pathways in solid-line rectangles were previously elucidated. Pathways bordered
  by rectangles with dotted lines include genes proposed here as part of crosstalk
  between diurnal expression and drought response.
