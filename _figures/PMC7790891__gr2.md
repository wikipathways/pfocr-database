caption: The regulatory network of ginsenosides in macrophage. (1) Ginsenoside Rg1
  (Rg1) activates autophagy in macrophages in serum-deficient environment through
  the AMPK/mTOR pathway, which suppresses apoptosis and improves the stability of
  late atherosclerotic plaques. (2) Ginsenoside Rd (Rd) suppresses the formation of
  foam cells by inhibiting calcium influx and reducing the uptake of Ox-LDLmacrophages.
  (3) Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) promotes macrophages polarization to M2 by targeting PPARγ
  and inhibits nuclear transcription of NF-κB, which suppresses macrophage polarization
  to pro-inflammatory M1 and the release of inflammatory factors, and then alleviates
  inflammatory responses in diabetic atherosclerosis. (4) Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) promotes
  the activation of stat6 by increasing the secretion of IL-4, prompting macrophages
  to polarize to M2 and play an anti-inflammatory role. (5) CK promotes the effect
  of RCT by activating the LXRα and suppresses the amount of cholesterol in cells.
