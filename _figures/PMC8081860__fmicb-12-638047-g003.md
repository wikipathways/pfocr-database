caption: LAM-induced regulation of the innate immune cells. (A) Interaction of LAM
  with TLR-2 in human alveolar epithelial cells, the classical pathway of TLR activation
  is mediated by MyD88 and TIRAP phosphorylation. Downstream, IRAK and TRAF molecules
  are phosphorylated to induce p38 and ERK1/2 activation, which are involved in pro-IL-37
  production. IL-37 maturation requires caspase 1 (casp-1), IL-37 forms a complex
  with Smad3 that is translocated into the nucleus to suppress the inflammatory response.
  (B) LAM is inserted into the lactosylceramide (LacCer)-enriched lipid rafts or it
  can be recognized by the CD11b/CD18 complex. When LAM is inserted in the cell membrane,
  the recruitment of hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck) by Lyn kinase is inhibited. Moreover,
  LAM regulates the phosphorylation of vav and, consequently, there is a downregulation
  of ras-related protein (Rab27a), limiting the traffic of azurophilic granules by
  GTP hydrolysis blockade. Thus, in neutrophils, LAM favors a negative regulation
  characterized by low production of myeloperoxidase (MPO), NADPH oxidase, LAMP3,
  and impaired intracellular calcium flux. (C) CD11b/CD18 expressed on the cell surface
  of eosinophils interact with LAM, blocking the TLR-2 mediated cell activation and
  consequently the inflammatory cytokine (TNF, IL-1Ra, IL-6, and IL-8) production
  is limited. The figure was created in BioRender.
