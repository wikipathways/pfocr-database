caption: 'Mechanisms by which ADSCs‐EXOs may promote wound healing. (A) adipose‐derived
  stem cells (ADSCs)‐EXOs contain immunoregulatory proteins and reduce the secretion
  of IFN‐α, subsequently inhibiting activation of T cells, resulting in reduced inflammation.
  Additionally, miR‐155 in ADSCs‐EXOs can induce monocyte differentiation into M1
  macrophages, causing chronic inflammation; (B) ADSCs‐EXOs can transfer miRNA‐125a
  and miRNA‐31 to vascular endothelial cells, stimulating proliferation and migration
  to promote angiogenesis; (C) In the early stages, ADSCs‐EXOs may promote proliferation,
  migration and collagen synthesis in fibroblasts, stimulating N‐cadherin, cyclin‐1,
  PCNA and collagen I, III expression and increasing ECM production; (D) in late stages,
  ADSCs‐EXOs prevent the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and reduce
  scarring by inhibition of the formation of collagen and activation the ERK/MAPK
  pathway to increase MMP3 expression. Abbreviations: ECM, extracellular matrix; MCSF,
  macrophage colony‐stimulating factor'
