caption: 'Engineering a GPP-synthesizing microfactory in the yeast peroxisome. Conventional
  production of GPP-derived compounds in yeast relies on the endogenous cytosolic
  MVA pathway (shown in black). Here, we build an insulated pathway for GPP synthesis
  in the peroxisome by targeting the complete MVA pathway in the peroxisome (shown
  in green) and harvesting peroxisomal acetyl-CoA. Introduction of specific monoterpene
  synthases (SeCamS, SpSabS, ObGerS, MsLimS, ClLimS, PtPinS, ObGerS) in the peroxisome
  together with the GPP synthase Erg20p(N127W) (also shown in green) leads to strong
  increase in the production of the corresponding monoterpene scaffolds compared to
  the cytosol. When the monoterpene synthase and Erg20p(N127W) are targeted in the
  peroxisome in the absence of a peroxisomal MVA pathway, IPP and DMAPP coming from
  the cytosol (indicated by black arrows crossing the peroxisomal membrane) can still
  support synthesis of various monoterpenes, albeit at a lower level. Further oxidation
  of monoterpene scaffolds by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CrG8OH and MsLimH, also shown
  in green) residing at the ER provide precursors of high-value molecules, such as
  monoterpene indole alkaloids and menthol. The peroxisomal GPP pool can also be used
  for OA prenylation leading to CBGA, the common precursor of various cannabinoids.
