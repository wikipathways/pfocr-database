caption: Under normal conditions, rhizobia activated by root flavonoids release NFs
  to stimulate the symbiotic signaling pathway. The downstream factor GmLBD16a regulated
  by GmNINs is required for the expression of the symbiotic gene GmEXP17c by directly
  binding to its promoter, thereby promoting the production of nodules. Under salt
  stress conditions, key transcriptional factors such as GmABI5a and GmABI5b in the
  ABA classic signaling pathway directly activate the expression of GmERF13s. The
  upregulated GmERF13s subsequently interact with GmLBD16a, thereby reducing its binding
  ability to the downstream gene GmEXP17c’s promoter and causing a significant reduction
  in the number of nodules
