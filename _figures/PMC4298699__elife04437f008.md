caption: 'High levels of EGFR signaling in the FSC promote maintenance in the niche
  and the formation of basal and lateral domains while suppressing the formation of
  an apical domain. EGFR activates both the canonical Ras-mediated pathway leading
  to the phosphorylation of Erk, and the LKB1–AMPK pathway. Both Erk and AMPK are
  kinases that can regulate gene activity by activating transcription factors and
  phosphorylating proteins in the cytoplasm. AMPK directly promotes the lateral identity
  in polarized cells by activating lateral proteins. PKA is an upstream activator
  of LKB1 in follicle cells, and PKA can be activated by EGFR signaling, suggesting
  that EGFR signaling may activate LKB1 via PKA. EGFR signaling may suppress apical
  polarity either directly by regulating the transcription or activity of apical proteins,
  or indirectly by enhancing the activity of lateral proteins that suppress the localization
  of apical proteins. Low levels of EGFR signaling in prefollicle cells relieves this
  suppression, allowing apical domains to form and permitting differentiation away
  from the stem cell fate.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04437.020'
