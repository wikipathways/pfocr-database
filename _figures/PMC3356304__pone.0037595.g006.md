caption: For each sample, the top panel shows the pathway crosstalk map, and the bottom
  panel shows the genes contributing to the crosstalk. In the top panel, each node
  represents a pathway with the node color proportional to the pathway enrichment
  P value. The edge represents crosstalk event between the connected nodes (pathways),
  with edge width proportional to shared MutGenes and edge color proportional to the
  P value of the crosstalk event. In the bottom panel, a matrix shows the profile
  of genes in the significant pathways, with rows for MutGenes and columns for pathways.
  When a MutGene is observed in a pathway, the corresponding box is in red.
