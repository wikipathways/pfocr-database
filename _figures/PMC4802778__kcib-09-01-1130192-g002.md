caption: Role of sortilin in EV biogenesis. Sortilin is initially synthesized in the
  constitutive secretory pathway as a precursor encoding a short propeptide sequence.
  The propeptide is cleaved by pro-protein convertases at the TGN allowing sortilin
  to enter the secretory pathway (stage 1). There are a number of likely routes that
  sortilin can be trafficked. Sortilin can be trafficked along a number of possible
  routes such as trafficking to the plasma membrane through constitutive secretory
  vesicles (stage 2). Alternatively, sortilin could be anterograde transported from
  the TGN by itself or with its binding partners to the early endosomes (stage 3).
  Sortilin present at the cell surface or in the endocytic pathway could be cleaved
  by disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-converting protein (ADAM) 10 or ADAM17,
  and followed by g-secretase (stage 5). Following endoproteolytic cleavage, sortilin
  could form a heterotrimeric complex with TrkB and EGFR (TES complex) which is internalized
  through a clathrin-dependent endocytosis process into early endosomes (stage 6).
  At the plasma membrane, the purple spots represent clathrin associated with vesicles
  (clathrin-coated vesicles [CCV]) or the bilayered clathrin coats at the endosome.
  The intraluminal vesicles (ILV) are formed by an invagination event at the membrane
  of the late endosomes/multivesicular body (MVB). Sortilin may play a role in the
  recruitment of certain cargo such as its binding partners- TrkB and EGFR, which
  could be an ESCRT-dependent mechanism. The MVB and its content could be degraded
  via the lysosome-mediated pathway for degradation or alternatively the MVB are transported
  to the cell surface were they dock at the plasma membrane requiring Rab27A to release
  the vesicles into the extracellular space (stage 7). The exosomes carrying the TES
  complex could be released and taken up in the target cell. The uptake of TES-containing
  exosomes initiates cellular communication through upregulation of cell signaling
  events by the induction of cell survival through the EGFR cascade and the angiogenesis
  process (stage 8).
