caption: Interaction between Trp metabolites and OA. IPA targeted AhR to inhibit the
  expression of inflammatory factors (NO, PGE2, TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2) and
  matrix-degrading enzymes (MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5) by inactivating the NF-κB
  pathway. 5-HT activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling to inhibit gene expression of Sox9
  and promote Mmp13. Melatonin inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt, p38, ERK,
  JNK, and MAPK. Melatonin maintained mitochondrial functions, decreased mitochondrial
  oxidative stress, and inhibited NOX4 expression on mitochondria to mitigate ferroptosis.
  Melatonin significantly up-regulated HO-1 by enhancing the protein levels of NRF2
  by suppressing miR-146a. Melatonin mitigated matrix degradation with enhanced SIRT1
  expression by blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway and preserved chondrocytes through
  activation of the TGF-β1/Smad2 pathway, which inhibited the expression levels of
  MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, iNOS, NO, PGE2, and COX-2 and accelerated Col2 expression.
