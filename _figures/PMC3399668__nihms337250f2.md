caption: 'The synthesis of serotonin from tryptophan catalyzed by TPH and AADC. Serotonin
  is stored in synaptic vesicles mediated by VMAT. Following release from the terminal,
  serotonin diffuses to both synaptic and extrasynaptic serotonin receptors. Serotonin
  is taken back up into the terminal by the SERT and metabolized by MAO to 5-HIAA.
  5-HIAA: 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid; AADC: Aromatic amino acid decarboxylase; MAO:
  Monoamine oxidase; SERT: Serotonin transporter; TPH: Tryptophan hydroxylase; VMAT:
  Vesicular monoamine transporter.'
