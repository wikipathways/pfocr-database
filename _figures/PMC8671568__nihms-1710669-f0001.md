caption: 'The TGF-β family of proteins mediates brain region-specific divergent neuroadaptations
  involving dysregulated ubiquitin proteasomal system, abnormal chromatin remodeling,
  and altered transcriptional and synaptic mechanisms underlying cocaine-induced plasticity.
  At abstinent day 7 from extended access cocaine self-administration the canonical
  transcriptional activin A signaling is elevated in the nucleus accumbens that results
  in potentiated SMAD3 phosphorylation. Increased phosphorylation leads to altered
  SMAD3-mediated spine remodeling and transcriptional programs that is thought to
  be mediated through recruitment of chromatin remodeler BRG1. On the contrary, a
  similar abstinent time point following short access to cocaine potentiates the BMP
  pathway in the nucleus accumbens through increase in SMAD1/5 phosphorylation. An
  elevated SMAD1/5 level is attributed to reduced expression of its proteasomal regulator
  SMURF1 and increased expression of transcription factor RUNX2 that initiates unique
  transcriptional changes. At AD30 from cocaine self-administration, activin A non-canonical
  signaling is increased in the dorsal hippocampus where RAS-GRF1 is increased concomitant
  with increased levels of p-GluN2B and altered synaptic plasticity. Canonical activin
  A pathway via SMAD2 is elevated while BMP pathway intermediates SMAD1/5 is decreased
  in hippocampus of rodents treated with anti-depressants, environmental enrichment
  and electroconvulsive stimulation. This potentiated activin A signaling in the hippocampus
  leads to altered neurogenesis and transcriptional plasticity involving PMEPA1 and
  histone demethylase, JMJD3. Exposure to stress activates the BMP pathway through
  SMAD 1/5/9 that morphologically blocks neurogenesis. Abbreviations: TGF-β: Transforming
