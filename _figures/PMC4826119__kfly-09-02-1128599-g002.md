caption: Model for Krimp functions in the ping-pong pathway. Krimp interacts with
  unmethylated and piRNA-free AGO3 to recruit it to the nuage, where Krimp also interacts
  transiently with Aub to promote sDMA modification and sense secondary piRNA loading
  onto AGO3. Aub shuttles between the cytoplasm and nuage. The recognition of target
  transcripts by the piRNA guide stably recruits Aub to nuage. sDMA-modified AGO3
  is released from Krimp, and then initiates the ping-pong cycle with Aub. Sense and
  antisense piRNAs are indicated in blue and red, respectively.
