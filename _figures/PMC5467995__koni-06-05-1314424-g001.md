caption: 'Major intracellular pathways leading to Type-I-IFN production. Families
  of sensors, known as PRRs, are available in the cells to detect viral and danger
  products, and induce the expression of Type-I-IFNs. One set of PRRs is localized
  in endosomal vesicles, while another set senses components in the cytoplasm. The
  endosome-associated TLR3 and the cytosolic MDA5, RIG-I and NOD2 sense double-stranded
  and single-stranded RNAs through the activation of adaptor molecules such as TRIF
  and MAVS, respectively. TRIF and MAVS in turn converge to activate the TBK1-IKKε
  kinase complex. This culminates in the activation of the transcription factors IRF3
  and IRF7, which translocate to the nucleus and participate in the induction of a
  first wave of IFN-β production (1). IFN-β in turn acts in an autocrine/paracrine
  manner binding to the heterodimeric receptor IFNAR1-IFNAR2. This is followed by
  the activation of a JAK-STAT signaling pathway leading to a second wave of IFN-α
  production as well as to the transcription of other antiviral genes (2). Other PRRs
  sensing DNA are DAI and cGAS, with this last catalyzing the formation of ligands
  for STING upstream of the TBK1-IKKε complex, which finally drives the expression
  of IFNA and IFNB. cGAMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate;
  cGAS: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; DAI: DNA-dependent activator of IRFs; IFNs: interferons;
  IFNAR: IFN-α/β receptor; IKKε: IkB kinase ε; IRF: IFN regulatory factor; ISGs: IFN-stimulated
  genes; JAK: Janus kinase; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor; MDA5:
  melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; NOD2: nucleotide oligomerization
  domain 2; PRRs: pathogen recognition receptors; RIG-I: retinoic acid-inducible gene-I;
  STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription; STING: stimulator of IFN
  genes; TBK1: TANK-binding kinase 1; TLR3: Toll-like receptor 3; TRIF: TIR-domain
  containing adaptor protein-inducing IFN-β; TYK2, tyrosine kinase-2.'
