caption: 'Expression of Calvin cycle and pentose phosphate pathway genes. The Calvin
  cycle (green) and pentose phosphate pathway (orange) interlock; because their shared
  reactions (purple) run in opposite directions, the cycles cannot productively run
  at the same time. Gas shock expression data (thumbnail plots) for each gene in these
  pathways suggests that, as expected, CO2 starvation broadly downregulates the carbon-fixing
  Calvin cycle, while leaving the reductive pentose phosphate pathway largely intact.
  Data points are the geometric means of two biological replicates. Fold change is
  relative to t=0 for each condition. All thumbnail plots share the same layout and
  axis scales; for details, see sample plot at lower right. Data in sample plot (see
  Key) is simulated for illustration. The region between each time course and the
  baseline used for significance testing (for the air control, expression at t=0;
  for experimental conditions, the parallel time course in air) is shaded according
  to the outcome of that test: a significant change in expression in air with respect
  to t=0, blue; a significantly different time course in an experimental condition
  than in air, red; no significant effect, gray. Genes: cbbA, fructose-1,6-bis-P/sedoheptulose-1,7-bis-P
