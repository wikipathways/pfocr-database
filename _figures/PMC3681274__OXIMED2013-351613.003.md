caption: Hypothetical model of the C. elegans UPRmtpathway. Protein conformational
  stress in the mitochondrial matrix triggers CLPP-1 proteolysis of an unknown substrate,
  producing a stress signal (blue line). The stress signal is conveyed to the cytoplasm
  and induces nuclear translocation and complex formation of UBL-5 and DVE-1, as well
  as binding of DVE-1 to the promoter of the chaperone target gene, HSP-60. This stress-signaling
  pathway results in the induction of mitochondrial chaperone genes, HSP-60 and HSP-6.
  ubl-5 expression is also upregulated, which in turn amplifies the UPRmt signal (green-dotted
  line). HSP-60 and HSP-6 are imported into the mitochondria, where they help to restore
  protein homeostasis by refolding rogue proteins. Adapted with permission from [].
