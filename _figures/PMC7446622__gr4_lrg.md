  Gsk-3 phosphorylate the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 and support viral genome
  replication and transcription. Simultaneously, activated Gsk-3 also phosphorylate
  and degrade the significant oxidative stress combating transcription factor Nrf2,
  resulting outburst of different reactive oxygen species. Circulating DAMPs and PAMPs
  bind with TLR4 and stimulate the pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis via Myd88 dependent
  pathway. β-catenin is a downstream protein of Gsk-3, phosphorylate the p50 sub-unit
  of NfκB, altered their DNA binding ability, and suppresses inflammatory events.
  CREB is another transcription factor that initiates the expression of anti-inflammatory
  genes to overcome the disease condition. During virus infection, activate Gsk-3
  degrade the β-catenin protein and phosphorylate the CREB, consequential, lost CBP
