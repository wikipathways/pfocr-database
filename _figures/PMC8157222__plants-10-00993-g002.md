caption: 'Regulation of NO production and effects of NO on hypoxia sensing and response.
  In plants, NR catalyzes the first step of NO biosynthesis turning nitrate into nitrite.
  Nitrite can then be reduced to NO by NR, NI-NOR, XOR, and complexes III and IV of
  the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The latter results from the use of nitrite
  as a terminal electron acceptor (i.e., the nitrite-phytoglobin (PGB) cycle). In
  mammals, eNOS produces NO via oxidative or reductive mechanisms depending on the
  oxygen level. XOR is also capable of reducing nitrite to NO, as is complex III of
  the mitochondrial electron transport chain. NR and eNOS activity and their stability
  are regulated directly and indirectly by phosphorylation and ubiquitination. NR
  is also regulated by SUMO. In both plants and mammals, the N-degron pathway acts
  as a sensor of NO. In mammals, NO also affects the HIF-dependent oxygen-sensing
  pathway. Solid lines: confirmed pathways/interactions; dashed lines: proposed pathways/interactions.'
