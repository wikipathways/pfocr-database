caption: Predicted periplasmic localization of quinate and shikimate catabolism to
  protocatechuate. Genetic evidence from this study suggests that the sequential action
  of the QuiA membrane-bound quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase (), the QuiB dehydroquinate
  dehydratase (), and the QuiC dehydroshikimate dehydratase () produces protocatechuate
  in the periplasm. Protocatechuate thus formed could then be transported across the
  inner membrane (dashed horizontal lines) into the cytoplasm by the PcaK and VanK
  permeases. Such compartmentation would reduce competition for intermediates that
  are common to both the catabolic pathway and the biosynthetic pathway for generation
  of aromatic amino acids. The putative porin QuiX () may mediate entry of quinate
  and shikimate into the periplasm from outside the cell.
