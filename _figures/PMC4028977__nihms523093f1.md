caption: '(A) The prostaglandin E2 synthesis pathway. PGE2 is synthesized in three
  steps. First, PLA2 isoforms promotes the cleavage of AA from PLs. Then, AA is converted
  to the unstable intermediate PGH2 by the COXs. In the final step, terminal PGESs
  isomerize PGH2 into PGE2. Other structurally relatedprostaglandins, such as PGD2,
  PGF2α, PGI2 and TXA2, are all formed from the common precursor PGH2 by specializedprostaglandin
  synthases. 15-PGDH degrades PGE2 to the inactive metabolite 15-keto PGE2. MRP4 is
  a prostaglandin efflux transporter, releasing newly synthesized PGE2 from cells.
  Extracellular PGE2 is free to bind the prostaglandin E receptors 1, 2, 3 and 4 (EPR1–4),
  inducing a complex intracellular response leading to increased inflammation and
  tumor growth. The PGT transports exogenous PGE2 back in to the cytoplasm. Red symbols
  indicate targets of the PGE2pathway covered in this review and effecting the free
  extracellular concentration of PGE2. Green symbols indicate therapeutic approaches
  for decreasing free extracellular PGE2: (i) reduced PGE2 production through direct
  inhibition or modulated expression of PGES; (ii) inhibition of PGE2 activity by
  direct targeting of PGE2; (iii) increased PGE2 degradation via induction of 15-PGDH;
  (iv) reduced release of PGE2 from the cytoplasm by inhibition of MRP4; (v) enhanced
  re-uptake of PGE2 through induction of PGT; and (vi) reduced sensitivity to free
  extracellular PGE2 due to down-regulation of EPR4 receptor through inhibition of
  PGT. (B) This review will focus on patents for mPGES-1 inhibitors and modulators
  of mPGES-1 expression (3: section titled ‘True inhibitors of mPGES-1’; 4: section
  titled ‘Methods for targeting mPGES-1’), direct inhibitors of PGE2 activity (5:
  section titled ‘Methods and compounds targeting free extracellular PGE2 concentration),
  stimulators of 15-PGDH, and modulators of PGE2 transporters (section 5).15-PGDH:
