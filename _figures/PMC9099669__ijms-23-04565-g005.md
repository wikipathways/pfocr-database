caption: Highlighting the neuroprotective role of ghrelin in Parkinson’s disease.
  Ghrelin, along with its analogs, namely HM01 and Dpr3ghr, markedly render nerve
  cell protective actions against MPTP, MPP+, and rotenone-provoked neuronal destruction,
  via suppressing oxidative stress, programmed cell death, and de-escalating inflammation.
  Ghrelin, following its interaction with ghrelinR/GHS-R1a, suppresses K+ channels,
  which, as a consequence, contributes to DA nerve cell excitation. In addition, ghrelin,
  by means of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, increases the number or amount
  of NSCs of the midbrain and in vitro and ex vivo DArgic nerve cell differentiation.
  Moreover, ghrelin treatment regulates MtMP, suppresses mitochondrial complex-I operation,
  de-escalates ROS formation and caspase-3 stimulation, and eventually restrains nerve
  cells from MPP+ or rotenone-instigated detrimental repercussions. Additionally,
  ghrelin escalates the levels of antioxidant biocatalysts, namely CAT and Cu-Zn SOD,
  de-escalates the MDA levels, and suppresses the NF-κB translocation, and thereby
  suppresses the oxidative stress via ceasing the lipid peroxidation and generation
  of ROS, and finally contributes to nerve cell protective action. Moreover, ghrelin
  possesses its nerve cell protective action via activating AMPK and escalating the
  mitophagy, which subsequently culminates in the amplification in the chondriosomal
  bioenergetics. Furthermore, therapy with the assistance of ghrelin culminates in
  the suppression of microglia stimulation, which, as a result, de-escalates inflammation
  (via de-escalating the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β), and finally culminates into nerve
  cell protective action. Apart from this, the two, namely ghrelin and Dpr3ghr, suppress
  programmed cell death and possess substantial nerve cell protective action by elevating
  Bcl-2 expression, and declining Bax expression and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Subtraction
