caption: 'PQQ and cellular NAD+. Events elicited by PQQ and NAD+ are highlighted.
  At the top of the figure, A, niacin-related serum components are depicted that are
  important in the production of NAD+. Each interacts to generate NAD+ as indicated
  in the section encircled as B. PQQ plays a role in the process by enhancing the
  expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (designated as Nampt}. Increasing
  Nampt activity increases NAD+ cellular levels. NAD+ performs two principal functions;
  first, as a cofactor for dehydrogenases and reductases, such as lactic acid dehydrogenase
  (LDH), C, and second, as a co-substrate for sirtuin-catalyzed protein deacetylations
  as noted in D. Likewise, PQQ is a catalytic cofactor for LDH, C. PQQ facilitates
  the conversion of lactate to pyruvate. In the nucleus, E, NAD+, as a co-substrate
  for sirtuins, promotes targeted acetylation or deacetylation of proteins involved
  in cell signaling. Six examples are enumerated: (1) the LKBl/AMP-Kinase-pathway,
  important in the regulation of rnitochondriogenesis and rates of P-oxidation, (2)
  Forkhead box 0 transcription factors (FoxO) important to cellular proliferation
  and survival, (3) transcription factors involving NF-KB and P53 proteins, which
  regulate multiple aspects of innate and adaptive immune responsiveness, (4) the
  Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription JAK-STAT) pathway
  essential for processes related to hematopoiesis, lactation, and immune responsiveness,
  (5) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC-lα), which
  plays a central role in cellular metabolism and ATP production and (6) the regulation
  of the mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM) and other factors essential for
  mitochondrial genome replication. Finally, in the mitochondria, F. PQQ and NAD+
  profoundly impact oxidative metabolism, ROS control, and heat regulation through
  events controlled by mitochondrial sirtuins and uncoupling proteins, such as UCP2.'
