caption: 'Biosynthetic genes responsible for polyketide extender units of RM-A. A,
  polyketide natural products containing atypical extender units. Bold red type indicates
  carbon chains derived from atypical extender units. B, gene organization. Based
  on the presence of the revR, revS, and revT homologs, each gene cluster was categorized
  into four groups as follows: revR, revS, and revT homologs (panel I); revR and revT
  homologs (panel II); revT homolog with additional genes related to atypical extender
  unit biosynthesis (panel III); and revS homolog with putative propionyl-CoA carboxylase
  β-subunit homolog (panel IV). C, scheme of the possible 2-alkylmalonyl-CoA biosynthesis
  by RevR, RevS, and RevT. Both fatty acid degradation and de novo fatty acid biosynthetic
  pathway were predicted to be involved in 2-alkylmalonyl-CoA biosynthesis.'
