caption: Model of carbon metabolism in the ΔaioS mutant vs WT during AsIII exposure,
  with mannitol being the initial substrate. Reaction steps were derived from KEGG
  pathway maps using the most parsimonious routes of metabolite formation, noting
  that not all enzyme reaction steps are depicted in the model. When multiple intermediates
  are involved between illustrated metabolites, the number of reactions is shown;
  i.e., ×3, with the number of intermediates identified shown in parentheses. Green
  text denotes metabolites increased in abundance; blue text denotes metabolites decreased
  in abundance. Red dashed vector arrows indicate reactions suggested to be inhibited
  by AsIII. Transcripts are denoted by AT5A identification number (purple text), with
  a triangle indication increased expression (←) or decreased expression (↔). Underlined
  text indicates metabolites or transcripts for which the change in abundance when
  compared to the WT was the same with or without AsIII.
