caption: Models of the positive regulatory feedback loop of p65/miR-27a-3p/TAB3/NF-κB
  axis. Transcriptionally activation of miR-27a-3p by p65 overexpression enhanced
  TAB3 expression, and subsequently activated the NF-κB signaling pathway and is involved
  in the malignant potential of cervical cancer cells, which presents the positive
  feedback regulatory loop and its involvement in cervical tumorigenesis. TAB3, TGF-β
  activated kinase 1 binding protein 3; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; TRAF3,
  TNF receptor associated factor 3; MAP3K14, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
  kinase 14
