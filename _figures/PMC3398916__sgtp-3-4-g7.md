caption: Figure 7. Model showing the involvement of Tiam1/Rac signaling in the outgrowth
  of astrocyte protrusions as well as the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton.
  (A) Schematic representation of the effect of absence of Tiam1 expression on astrocyte
  protrusion outgrowth. Protrusional length is impaired and the integrity of the microtubule
  cytoskeleton is disturbed. Centrosome positioning is independent of Tiam1/Rac signaling.
  Arrow indicates the direction of protrusion formation. (B) Scratching monolayers
  of astrocytes induces activation of Cdc42, which in turn regulates a signaling pathway
  involving proteins such as GSK3β, APC and Dlg1, controling centrosome and Golgi
  reorientation.- In this study we have shown that protrusional outgrowth on the other
  hand is regulated by Tiam1-mediated Rac activation. In addition, we demonstrated
  that lack of Tiam1 impairs protrusional outgrowth and the adoption of asymmetrical
  cell shape. Furthermore, in a pathway parallel to the Par6/aPKCζ pathway, Tiam1
  functions in the regulation of the microtubule organization, perhaps through effects
  on microtubule stabilization.
