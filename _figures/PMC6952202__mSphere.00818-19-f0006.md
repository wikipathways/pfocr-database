caption: Model illustrating the putative mechanism by which PUUP potentiates CAS activity.
  The CWI pathway is initiated when cell wall (CW) damage caused by CAS is sensed
  by cell surface sensors in the plasma membrane (PM). The CW stress signal is relayed
  to the nucleus through a MAP kinase cascade, and the induction of CW-related genes
  leads to cell wall repair. PUUP interferes with Hsp90 function, resulting in the
  disruption of Slt2 activation. This in turn prevents the activation of Rlm1 and
  inhibits the induction of genes required for CW repair and maintenance.
