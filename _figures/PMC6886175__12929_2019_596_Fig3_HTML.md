caption: Interactions between EV-A71 and the type I IFN- signaling pathway. Upon cytokine
  engagement, type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) triggers the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to
  the activation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to mount antiviral immunity.
  EV-A71 2A is shown to target IFNAR and IRF9 to curtail IFNR signaling to ISG induction.
  EV-A71 3C is shown to target one of ISGs called ZAP, which functions to inhibit
  viral replication.
