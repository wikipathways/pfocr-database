caption: Host cell cycle regulation influenced by the attack of viral protein components
  on pRb and E2F complex. Viral protein complex forcibly releases the E2F from pRb
  and E2F complex and abruptly increases the cell cycle progression in an uncontrolled
  way. The blue color shows the normal pathway of G1 to S progression, while red color
  shows virus-induced uncontrolled cell progression from G1 to S.
