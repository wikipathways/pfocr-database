caption: The regulatory cascade of MIR211 involving the BRAF/ERK5/DUSP and PDK4. MIR211
  is a negative regulator of at least two negative regulators (BIRC2, DUSP6 and possibly
  other DUSP mRNAs) of the ERK5/MEK signaling pathway. The latter is involved in resistance
  of melanoma to vemurafenib and cobimetinib. PDK4 is a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase,
  which inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by phosphorylation, which therefore
  cannot catalyze the entry of pyruvate to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Metabolites
  of the TCA cycle induces lipid biosynthesis and inhibits hypoxia inducing factor
  HIF1α, which is a transcriptional activator of ERRβ, which in turn is a transcriptional
  activator of PDK4 gene. Evidence for these pathways are obtained from Lee et al.
  (2016 and 2020) (, ).
