caption: A, Multifactorial etiology of adhesion formation. (1) Surgical injury to
  peritoneum induces (2) an acute inflammatory response that activates mesothelial
  and (3) capillary endothelial cells. The subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines
  activates platelets that (4) aggregate and adhere to the endothelium triggering
  the formation of a fibrin thrombus. Hypoxia resulting from interrupted blood flow
  and inflammation induces the upregulation of the transcription factor (5) hypoxia
  inducible factor (HIF)-1α, which causes activated mesothelial cells to secrete plasminogen
  activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and (6) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
  2 key players in the adhesion formation pathway. (7) PAI-1 inhibits tissue plasminogen
  activator (tPA), preventing the dissolution of the fibrinous exudate by plasmin
  and (8) VEGF disrupts the mesothelial and endothelial cell junctions facilitating
  the extravasations of the fibrinous exudate from the vasculature into the peritoneum.
  (9) We also showed that peritoneal levels of tissue factor (TF) are rapidly upregulated
  after surgery facilitating the maturation of the fibrin matrix and (10) permanent
  adhesion formation. B, Synergistic actions of a NK-1RA and VPA on different pathways
  of adhesion formation reduces adhesion formation more effectively than either alone.
  (1) An NK-1RA reduced peritoneal adhesion tissue inflammation, (2) HIF-1α, and (3)
  PAI-1 levels, and (4) increased tPA levels effectively (5) increasing total peritoneal
  fibrinolytic activity. VPA reduced peritoneal adhesion tissue levels of (6) VEGF,
  (7) fibrinogen, and (8) TF. The reduction of fibrin precursors and fibrin in the
  peritoneum in concert with the increase in peritoneal fibrinolysis facilitate the
  breakdown of the (9) fibrinous exudate, thus reducing adhesion formation.
