caption: Cholinergic inflammation-resolving pathway (–). At its splenic nerve terminus,
  vagal outflow releases adrenergic agonists (rather than the usual cholinergic neuro-transmitter);
  these catecholamines (CA) activate β2 ARs on CD3 T lymphocytes that contain choline
  acetyltransferase (CHAT), which is capable of synthesizing the acetylcholine needed
  to mediate inhibition of macrophage NF-κB activity by signaling through α7 nAChR.
