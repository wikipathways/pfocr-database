caption: 'Schematic representation of the p38α involvement in colorectal cancer. A:
  p38α is involved in the regulation of key metabolic cascades in colorectal cancer
  (CRC), sustaining HIF1α protein expression and the transcription of HIF1α target
  genes, such as GLUT1, HK2, PKM2 and LDHA; B: p38α blockade causes a significant
  decrease in the intracellular levels of ATP, which correlates with a time-dependent
  reduction of HIF1α protein levels and the consequent decrease in HIF1α target gene
  expression and phospho-activation of AMPK. AMPK activity is required for the nuclear
  accumulation of FoxO3A and the subsequent activation of FoxO3A target genes involved
  in autophagy, metabolism, cell cycle arrest and cell death, leading to autophagic
  cell death in CRC in vitro and in vivo. PI3K/Akt and JNK kinases regulate the nuclear/cytoplasmic
  shuttling of FoxO3A protein by phosphorylation.'
