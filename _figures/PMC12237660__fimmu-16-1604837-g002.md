caption: Targeting TREM2 signal pathway. TREM2, as a transmembrane receptor, requires
  the presence of DAP12 or DAP10 to exert its function after ligand binding. Its ligands
  include DNA, bacterial products (such as LPS), lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins
  (APOE, APOJ). Upon ligand binding, TREM2 recruits SYK protein, thereby activating
  a series of signaling pathways. Cleavage of TREM2 in the stalk region by ADAM10/17
  creates sTREM2 and stops the TREM2 signaling cascade. TREM2, Triggering Receptor
  Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2; DAP12/10, DNAX-activation protein of 12kDa/10kDa;
  DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; APOE, apolipoprotein E; APOJ,
  apolipoprotein J; ADAM10/17, A disintegrin and metalloproteinase10/17; sTREM2, soluble
