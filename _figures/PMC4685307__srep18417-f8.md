caption: Serum starvation triggers EGF-independent activation of EGFR and, consequently,
  activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, resulting in Sp1 phosphorylation and induction of
  P2rx7 gene expression. Moreover, PKCζ activation reduces Akt phosphorylation, thereby
  providing a negative feedback loop to regulate Akt activity. Higher levels of P2×7R
  allow cell proliferation of N2a cells even in the absence of trophic support.
