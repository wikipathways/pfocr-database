caption: Summary of small RNAs biogenesis and processing. a RNA polymerase II (Pol
  II) is required for the transcription of long primary single stranded miRNA (pri-miRNA);
  a hairpin structure is then formed by sequence complementarity and the pri-miRNA
  is cleaved by DICER-LIKE (DCL) proteins, forming the miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA);
  it is processed by DCL to form miRNA duplexes (Xie et al. ). miRNA duplexes are
  2ʹ‑O‑methylated at both 3ʹends by HUA ENHANCER 1 (HEN1), a mechanism that protects
  them from degradation and uridylation; mature miRNA duplexes are recognized and
  cleaved by the ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins (Vaucheret ); they are successively exported
  to the cytosol as AGO1:miRNA complexes (Bologna et al. ). b The canonical RNA-dependent
  DNA Methylation (RdDM) pathway requires Pol IV to transcribe transposable elements,
  RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2) to produce dsRNAs, DCL3 to process dsRNAs
  to 24-nucleotide siRNAs, which are stabilized by methylation at their 3′-OH groups
  by HEN1 and loaded onto AGO4, AGO6, and/or AGO9. During Pol V mediated transcription,
  the AGO4 recruits DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2), that is responsible
  for de novo methylation at the homologous genomic sites, provoking transcriptional
  gene silencing (TGS). c A slightly different pathway includes the RDR6-dependent
  RdDM. Young transposons are initially transcribed by Pol II to produce RNAs from
  transposable elements. Some of these Pol II transcripts can be copied by RDR6 to
  produce dsRNAs, which are processed by DCL2 and DCL4 into 21–22-nucleotide siRNAs,
  resulting in AGO1-mediated PTGS of transposon derived RNAs. These dsRNAs can also
  initiate low levels of de novo DNA methylation, which initiates the canonical RdDM
  pathway in a manner that is dependent on AGO2, Pol V and DRM2. d Trans-acting siRNAs
  (ta-siRNAs). ta-siRNA biogenesis involves the targeting of a Pol II generated long
  non-coding TAS RNA precursor by miRNA-guided AGO cleavage (miR390-AGO7), followed
  by the respective synthesis (by RDR6) and stabilization (by SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING
  3; SGS3) of dsRNAs. These dsRNAs are processed by DCL4 and loaded into AGO1 proteins
  for PTGS, while for non-canonical RdDM they are processed by DCL1, loaded into AGO4/6,
  can induce DNA methylation at the corresponding TAS loci (Matze and Mosher ). Ta-siRNAs
  biogenesis can be further controlled by the THO complex, in particular by TEX1.
  The THO complex is important to export the ta-siRNAs from the nucleus to the cytosol
