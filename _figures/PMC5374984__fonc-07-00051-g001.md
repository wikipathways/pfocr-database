caption: (A) The autophagy pathway. Autophagy induction is controlled upstream by
  energy sensors, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK). mTOR shuts off autophagy in the presence of abundant nutrients, while
  AMPK is activated upon energy stress. AMPK induces autophagy by inhibiting mTOR
  and stimulating upstream autophagy factors of the unc-51-like autophagy-activating
  kinase (ULK) and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complexes. Vesicle
  expansion requires the autophagy-related gene 8 (Atg8)/light chain 3 (LC3) and autophagy-related
  gene 12 (Atg12) ubiquitin-like conjugation systems. Autophagy receptors (e.g., p62)
  can mediate selective recruitment of cargo to the inner vesicle membrane. Following
  vesicle closure, the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome whereby the engulfed
  material is degraded. (B) The cell cycle. The cell cycle can be divided into G0,
  G1, S, G2 (interphase), and M-phase (mitosis and cytokinesis). Mitosis can be subdivided
  into prophase (DNA condensation is initiated), prometaphase (the mitotic spindle
  starts to form and the nuclear envelope has been dissolved), metaphase (the chromosomes
  are aligned at the metaphase plate), anaphase (separation of the sisterchromatids)
  and telophase (DNA decondenses, the nuclear envelope reforms, the contractile ring
  starts forming) and is followed by cytokinesis (physical separation of the daughter
  cells). Cell-cycle progression is governed by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) holoenzymes.
  CDK activity can be inhibited by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. For G1/S transition
  cyclin-CDKs phosphorylate retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which releases E2 factor
  (E2F) transcription factors from inhibitory binding, leading them to induce transcription
  of targets for G1/S transition.
