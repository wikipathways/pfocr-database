caption: Crosstalk between NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling in COVID-19 []. In uninfected
  cells, the NF-κB subunit is limited to the cytoplasm because of the inhibitory effect
  of the κB inhibitor family (IκB). (a) SARS-CoV-2 infection can increase oxidative
  stress and cause IKβ kinase activation, which causes phosphorylation of IkB-α (an
  NF-κB inhibitor), leading to proteasomal degradation of IkB-α and subsequent release
  of NF-κB. (b) In infected cells, NF-κB containing p65 (a NF-kB subunit; KEAP1 inhibitor)
  is transferred to the nucleus and acts on the DNA response elements. (c) This leads
  to the transcription of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines. (d) The activated NF-κB
  signaling cascade produces excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines and exacerbates
  the oxidative state. (e) In contrast, oxidative stress elicits Nrf2 signaling, leading
  to the separation of Nrf2 from its inhibitor Keap1. (f) Nrf2 then moves to the nucleus
  and binds to the Maf protein and the antioxidant response element (ARE). (g) Activated
  ARE transcripts include antioxidant genes and phase II enzymes such as NADPH, GSH,
  SOD, catalase, heme oxygenase-1, and NQO1. All these enzymes enhance the degradation
  of ROS. In addition, free Keap1 can prevent the degradation of IkB-α. (h) In general,
  genetic intervention and subsequent transcription have a positive effect of the
  Nrf2 pathway in the reduction of oxidative stress. Infection with COVID-19 causes
  oxidative stress, which also causes antioxidant benefits associated with Nrf2 [].
