caption: Forkhead box protein D1 (FOXD1)-expressing stromal cells are progenitors
  for renin precursor cells (RPCs), which in turn differentiate into renin-expressing
  juxtaglomerular cells, smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and a group of mesangial cells.
  Deletion of RBP-J in FOXD1 progenitors leads to striking morphological abnormalities
  characterized by few and thin blood vessels and an absence of renin-producing cells
  and mesangial cells. The lack of mesangial cells leads to the development of aneurisms
  in glomeruli. By contrast, deletion of RBP-J in RPCs leads to a change in their
  fate, as they are no longer able to synthesize renin and properly express smooth
  muscle genes. Despite the low blood pressure of these mice, the mutant cells are
  unable to reactivate renin expression. In addition, they do not reactivate renin
  expression in response to a challenge such as sodium depletion combined with angiotensin-converting
  enzyme inhibition. E, embryonic day; P, postnatal day; RBP-J, recombining binding
  protein suppressor of hairless.
