caption: 'The signaling pathway of NOX-dependent NETosis. Various cancer-associated
  stimuli increase the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in TANs, which results in the
  activation of PKC and NOX and, therefore, leads to intracellular production of ROS
  (I). As SOD and MPO interact, ROS are converted into HClO, leading to the activation
  of NE (II). NE promotes NM degradation, and then PAD4, MPO, and NE ensure chromatin
  decondensation and its mixing with cytoplasmic granules (III); the resulting mixture
  (in the form of NETs) is released into the extracellular space during NETosis (IV).
