caption: Schematic representation of the different RTN-1C-induced signaling pathways.
  Modulation of RTN-1C expression triggers the ER stress pathway and the regulation
  of different proteins (green ovals) at different levels (blue boxes). These events
  affect cellular processes (red boxes) which are at the basis of several human pathological
  settings (grey boxes).
