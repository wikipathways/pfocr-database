caption: CBCs function where signals from BL and CO2 converge. Phototropins that perceive
  BL undergo autophosphorylation and finally activate an H+-ATPase via phosphorylation
  of BLUS1 kinase. Phototropins inhibit the S-type anion channel activities via CBC1
  and CBC2 in response to BL. phot1 interacts with both CBC1 and CBC2 and phosphorylates
  CBC1. CBC1 interacts with both CBC1 and CBC2. CBC2 interacts with CBC2. CBC1 and
  CBC2 are located in the same pathway as HT1. Both CBC1 and CBC2 are required for
  stomatal opening in response to low concentrations of CO2. CBC1 and CBC2 interact
  with and are phosphorylated by HT1. Carbonic anhydrases βCA1 and βCA4 produce HCO3−
  from CO2; the resulting HCO3− activates RHC1, and the RHC1 inhibits HT1 kinase.
  The inhibitory effect of HT1 on OST1 is released in response to high concentrations
  of CO2. The activated OST1 activates the S-type channels of SLAC1, thereby, causing
  stomatal closure. There are protein kinase pathways other than OST1 that lead to
  stomatal closure in response to high CO2. Substrates for CBCs are unknown. Red lines
  signify stimulated stomatal opening and black lines signify accelerated stomatal
  closure
