caption: The reciprocal regulation of the mitochondrial dynamics machinery by the
  mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein
  kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways. The activated MAPK pathway promotes mitochondrial
  fission by activating Drp1 as well as inhibiting Mfn1 activity. Conversely, Mfn1
  has been shown to interact with Ras while Mfn2 has been shown to interact with either
  Ras or Raf; these interactions have been shown to inhibit MAPK activity and some
  of its physiological consequences. Activated Akt can directly phosphorylate and
  activate Drp1 and promote mitochondrial fission. Additionally, Mfn2 can interact
  with the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) complex, via interactions
  with rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR), which inhibits PI3K/Akt activity.
