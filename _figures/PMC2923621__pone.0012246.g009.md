caption: 'Endocytosis has many effects on signalling: in fact, signalling pathways
  and endocytic pathways are regulated in a reciprocal manner. It is now widely accepted
  that the “Endocytic Matrix” is a master organiser of signalling, governing the resolution
  of signals in space and time. Consequently endocytosis affects several cell functions
  that range from proliferation to cell motility . Growing evidences [22, 33, 34 and
  the present paper], point to an effect of certain gliadin peptides (i.e. P31-43)
  on the endocytic compartment. By interfering with Hrs localisation to the endocytic
  membranes, P31-43 induces two important effects: a) it delays endocytic maturation,
  and b) it alters the recycling pathway. By delaying the maturation of endocytic
  vesicles P31-43 reduces EGFR and other RTK degradation and prolongs their activation
  which in turn results in increased proliferation, actin modification and other biological
  effects. The alteration of the recycling pathway is able to direct more transferrin
  receptor and likely other recycling receptors such as IL15 to the membranes.'
