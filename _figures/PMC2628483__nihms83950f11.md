caption: 'A proposed model describing the apoptotic cell signaling events during oxidative
  and ER stress-induced cell death in PrP and PrPko cells. BFA and TUN induce activation
  of caspase-12 and caspase-8; H2O2 induces ROS production ; BFA, TUN, and H2O2 all
  activate caspase-9 which activates caspase-3, which then mediates proteolytic activation
  of PKCδ. Protealytically cleaved PKCδ induces DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cell
  death. The inhibitory action of pharmacological inhibitors: MnTBAP (ROS inhibitor);
  CsA, cyclosporine A (MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor);
  Z-IETD-FMK (caspase-8 inhibitor); Z-LEHD-FMK (caspase-9 inhibitor); Z-DEVD-FMK (caspase-3
  inhibitor); rottlerin (PKCδ inhibitor; and (loss-of-function dominant negative mutants
  (PKCδD327A-CRM and PKCδ K376R-DNM) are shown in the proposed pathway. In essence,
  our data suggest that PrPc protects against oxidative stress and exacerbates ER
  stress-induced apoptotic cell death signaling events.'
