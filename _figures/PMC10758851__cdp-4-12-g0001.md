caption: PI3K/AKT/mTOR intracellular signaling. Activation of PI3KIA begins from receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTKs), G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or other cell-specific
  receptors, such as B-cell receptor (BCR), while the PI3KIB isoform is activated
  exclusively through GPCR signaling. Both types of activation induce conversion of
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3), in a reaction that may be reversed through the inhibitory catalytic activity
  of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). PIP3 acts as a downstream messenger for
  activation of components of cellular pathways, including AKT serine/threonine kinase
  (AKT), which ultimately lead to cell cycle progression, apoptosis inhibition and
  maintenance of cell metabolism through regulation of major signaling proteins such
  as glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), forkhead box (FOXO), nuclear factor kappa
  B (NFkB) and tumor protein 53 (p53). AKT also activates downstream pathways important
  for cell homeostasis, including the mechanistic target of Rapamycin kinase (mTOR)
  activity, which corroborates AKT function in cell survival and regulation of metabolic
  activities. Downstream activation of component of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa
  B kinase complex, conserved helix-loophelix ubiquitous kinase (CHUK), by AKT induces
  phosphorylation of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which
  are the main effectors of mTOR activity and lead to cell regulation and survival,
  but also to phosphorylation-mediated feedback activation of AKT.
