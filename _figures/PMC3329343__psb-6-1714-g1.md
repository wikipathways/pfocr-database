caption: A simplified model for phyA (phytochrome A) signaling pathways. After de
  novo synthesis in the cytosol, assembly of the chromophor and dimerization, light
  establishes a photoequilibrium (designated as λ) between Pr (red light absorbing
  form of phytochromes) and Pfr (far red light absorbing form of phytochromes). The
  Pfr form of phyA interacts with the transport helper proteins FHY1 (FARRED ELONGATED
  HYPOCOTYL 1) and FHL (FHY1-LIKE PROTEIN) and is imported into the nucleus by a piggyback
  mechanism. FHY1 and FHL can re-enter the cytosol and thus function as shuttle-proteins
  for phyA (see  for details). Residual cytosolic phyA together with the blue light
  receptors PHOT1 and 2 (PHOTOTROPIC 1 and 2) trigger the phototropic response potentially
  via the PKS1 protein. In cytosol and nucleus phyA can become ubiquitinated in its
  Pfr form and is subsequently degraded, irrespective of its actual conformational
  state. Within the nucleus several phyA signal transduction pathways have been described.
  Phytochromes repress the (photomorphogenic repressor) COP1/SPA complex and thus
  enhance the nuclear accumulation of positive regulators such as HY5 (HYPOCOTYL 5),
  LAF1 (LONG AFTER FAR RED LIGHT1) and HFR1 (LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR RED 1). HY5 directly
  targets a number of genes important for photomorphogenesis. A second branch is that
  of the PIFs (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs), negative regulators of photomorphogenesis.
  Pfr induces the rapid degradation of these bHLH factors. A third pathway nearly
  exclusively responsible for the HIR (HIGH IRRADIANCE RESPONSE) includes the F-Box-protein
  EID1 (EMPFINDLICHER IM DUNKELROTEN LICHT 1). This protein targets a still unknown
  component of the phyA signaling network for degradation and functions as a repressor
  of phyA signaling. Not shown are the proposed effects on signaling of hypo- and
  hyperphosporylated forms of phyA.
