caption: Strategies of armed OVs for targeting the TMEOVs infect and lyse cancer cells,
  releasing the armed biologics to the TME. Matrix-degrading enzymes such as hyaluronidase,
  collagenase, and matrix metalloproteinase are used to degrade the dense and viscous
  cancer stroma. Bispecific antibodies such as bispecific T cell engager targeting
  FAP and FRβ are designed to selective deplete cancer-associated fibroblasts and
  immunosuppressive M2 macrophages, and activate endogenous T cells independent of
  the MHC class I molecule. Monovalent antibodies such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-L1
  antibodies can also be encoded by OVs to block the inhibitory receptors on regulatory
  T cells and tumor cells. In addition, cytokines such as GM-CSF and TNF-α can be
  armed in OVs to promote dendritic cell maturation and macrophage repolarization.
  IL-2 and IL-12 have also been used to promote T cell proliferation and activation.
  Soluble VEGFR receptor composed of VEGFR fused to an Fc domain is encoded by OVs
  to block the VEGF/VEGFR pathway for suppressing angiogenesis. CTLA-4, cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte-associated protein 4; FAP, fibroblast activation protein α; FRβ, folate
  receptor β; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IL-2, interleukin-2;
  IL-12, interleukin-12; PD-L1, programmed death-ligand 1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor
  α; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, VEGF receptor.
