caption: (Left) Upon exposure to moderate oxidative stress, Sp1 binds to the ZNF32
  promoter to increase ZNF32 transcription, which, in turn, increases C1QBP expression,
  maintains the mitochondrial membrane potential and antioxidant capacity, and inactivates
  the p38 MAPK pathway, consequently promoting cell survival. (Right) Under excessive
  oxidative stress, Sp1 is displaced from the ZNF32 promoter, which prevents ZNF32
  expression, followed by the suppression of C1QBP transcription, loss of mitochondrial
  membrane potential, extreme ROS accumulation, activation of p38 MAPK pathway and,
  ultimately, cell death.
