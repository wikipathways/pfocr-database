caption: . NLRP3 inflammasome activation in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle cells
  are equipped with a functional inflammasome pathway and actively participate to
  the inflammatory response upon P2X7R stimulation. A two signals model is proposed
  for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The Inflammasome priming (first step) is triggered
  by TLR 4 which in turn is activated upon binding with its cognate ligands such as
  extracellular matrix degradation (ECM) products and high mobility group Box 1 (HMGB1).
  HMGB1 is a nuclear protein that acts as a DNA chaperone in the nucleus and as a
  signal of tissue damage when extracellularly released. Ligand binding and conformational
  change that occur in the receptor lead to the recruitment of the adaptor protein
  MyD88, which in turn recruits IRAK4, IRAK1 and IRAK2. IRAK kinases then phosphorylate
  and activate the protein TRAF6, resulting in IκBα degradation and NF-κB diffusion
  into the cell nucleus. The nucleus of NFκB activates the transcription of NLRP3,
  IL-1β and IL-18. The inflammasome assembly (second step) is triggered by the eATP/P2XR7/K+
  efflux. In particular, intracellular K+ efflux, caused by opening of plasma membrane
  channels (P2X7R included), induces the assembly of the fully active NLRP3 complex
  (NLRP3-ASC-NEK7-Caspase-1). Finally, caspase-1, cleaves the pro-IL1β and pro IL-18
  into their mature forms.
