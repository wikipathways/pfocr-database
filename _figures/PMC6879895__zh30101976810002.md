caption: 'Mechanisms of melatonin-positive effect in different models of liver injury.
  A: melatonin counteracts ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) damage both by decreasing
  the activity of JNK and IkB kinase-α (IKKα) and by direct repression of Toll-like
  receptor 4 (TLR4) synthesis. B: melatonin reduces arsenic trioxide (As2O3) toxicity
  stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein-chinasi B (Akt) pathway
  and protects against cadmium (Cd) injury through superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) removal
  of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS). C: alcohol/matrix metalloproteinase-9
  (MMP-9)-mediated cell damage is reversed by melatonin. For details, see text. JNK,
  c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase.'
