caption: 'Panel A: Overview of the interaction between inflammation and the components
  of metabolic syndrome. When caloric intake exceeds metabolic energy demand, the
  level of saturated fat and glucose rise in blood. This excess caloric intake is
  converted into TG’s which are stored in the adipose tissue of visceral fat. Adipocytes
  release free fatty acids and inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α
  which can cause insulin resistance. Adipocytes release MCP-1 which attracts macrophages
  and causes local inflammation and release of further cytokines. Adipocytes can contribute
  to insulin resistance and hypertension through the production of angiotensin and
  aldosterone. FFAs in the plasma are taken up by the liver and packed into TG rich
  VLDL, which leads to lower levels of HDL-C and a dysfunctional HDL which reduces
  reverse cholesterol transport and increases oxLDL and MCP-1. Dysfunctional HDL also
  can modulate T cells through inhibiting Treg and promoting pro-inflammatory Th1
  and Th17 cell production. Dysfunctional HDL can increase blood glucose levels through
  reducing AMPK levels and can lead to vasoconstriction of blood vessels through reducing
  NO levels. FFAs have a similar effect on blood vessels through the production of
  oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species which reduce NO, increase ADMA and
  increase endothelin, thus causing vasoconstriction and hypertension.Panel B: The
  intracellular pathways involved in insulin resistance. In insulin sensitive tissue,
  the activation of the insulin receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the
  insulin receptor substrate (IRS). This leads to an increase in PI3K and subsequent
  activation of Akt. Akt activation leads to the expression of GLUT-4 on the plasma
  membrane and the transport of glucose into the cell. Akt activation also inhibits
  Foxo1 and therefore inhibits gluconeogenesis and prevents hyperglycemia. FFA, saturated
  fatty acids, nod-like receptors and cytokines can impair the intracellular insulin
  signaling pathway leading to insulin resistance. This occurs through different kinases
  which increase serine phosphorylation and decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1.
  Binding of interleukins, TNF-α or angiotensin, to their respective receptors activates
  IKK-β/NF-κB and leads to abnormal phosphorylation of IRS. In addition, IL R activation
  can lead to abnormal phosphorylation of IRS directly through MAPK. Overexpression
  of GRK2 causes insulin resistance by phosphorylating IRS-1. TNF-α can also activate
  IKK-β/NF-κB through activation of COX-2 and subsequent production of PGE2, PGD2
  or LTB4. FFA can bind directly to the NLR or TLR2 or bind to TLR4 after combining
  with FetA in the plasma. Activation of these receptors leads to activation of NF-κB
  and IKK-β leading to abnormal phosphorylation of IRS and upregulation of genes of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines or proteins involved in thrombosis such as PAI-1 or tissue
  factor. Omega-3 fatty acids can inhibit the downstream signaling pathway of TLR2/4
  through binding to the GPR120 receptor. This produces β-arrestin which inhibits
  Tak1, a key protein in the signaling pathway of TLR2/4.Akt, protein kinase B; Aldo,
