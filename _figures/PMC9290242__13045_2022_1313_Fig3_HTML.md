caption: Schematic showing representative mitochondrial therapeutic targets and their
  proposed inhibitors. The mitochondrial ETC, as the central system of mitochondrial
  energy production and OXPHOS, has been the most frequently used mitochondrial target.
  Multiple mitochondrial ETC inhibitors, including metformin and IACS-010759, are
  being investigated for cancer treatment. In addition, inhibitors targeting different
  steps of the mitochondrial TCA cycle have shown promise in phase I and II clinical
  trials. Several other TCA cycle-coupled biomacromolecule synthesis pathways, such
  as the nucleotide synthesis pathway and the one-carbon (1C) metabolic pathway, are
  also potential therapeutic targets for reversing drug resistance
