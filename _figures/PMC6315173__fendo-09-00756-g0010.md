caption: APLNR(s) in representative vertebrate species. In zebrafish, three functional
  APLNRs (APLNR2a, APLNR2b, and APLNR3a) for apelin/ELA peptides (encoded by APLN/ELA
  genes) were identified. Among them, APLNR2a (APLNRa) and APLNR2b (APLNRb) are receptors
  common for ELA and apelin, while APLNR3a is an apelin-specific receptor. In Xenopus
  tropicalis (or turtles), APLNR2 may act as a receptor common for both peptides,
  while APLNR1 may be either lost, or non-functional. In chickens, APLNR1 and APLNR2
  have been identified. APLNR1 can be activated by apelin and ELA potently and thus
  functions as a receptor common to both peptides, whereas APLNR2 can only be activated
  by both peptides at high concentrations, implying it has a less significant role
  in mediating apelin/ELA actions. In humans, only a single APLNR (APLNR1) exists
  and it can be activated by apelin/ELA potently, indicating a crucial role of APLNR1
  in mediating apelin/ELA actions. Activation of these APLNR(s) can activate multiple
  intracellular signaling pathways, including the inhibition of cAMP signaling pathway
  and activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade ().
