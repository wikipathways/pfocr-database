caption: General schematic diagram demonstrating the constitutively activated nuclear
  factor(NF)-κB/Snail/Yin Yang (YY) 1/RKIP circuitry in tumor cells and their modification
  by nitric oxide (NO). In tumor cells, the NF-κB pathway is activated constitutively.
  It has been reported that NF-κB regulates the transcription and expression of both
  Snail and YY1 and that YY1 also regulates Snail transcription. Snail represses RKIP,
  which has been reported to inhibit NF-κB. The overexpression of NF-κB, Snail, and
  YY1 and the underexpression of RKIP have been shown to regulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) phenotype and metastasis. Treatment with the NO donor DETANONOate
  results in the inhibition of NF-κB, Snail, and YY1 and the induction of RKIP expressions.
  This results in the reversal of the repression of E-cadherin by Snail and upregulation
  of E-cadherin. In addition to NO-induced inhibition of NF-κB and its target genes,
  it also inhibits the DNA-binding activities of NF-κB, Snail, and YY1 via S-nitrosylation.
  Together, these various modifications by NO result in the inhibition of EMT and
  metastasis.
