caption: 'Red arrow pathway: Exercise increases expression of transcriptional co-activator
  PGC-1α in hippocampal neurons through an unknown mechanism. Elevated PGC-1α levels
  boost expression of its binding partner ERRα and thus increase the amount of the
  transcriptional complex PGC-1α/ERRα, which enhances Fndc5 gene expression. FNDC5
  is a type I membrane protein, and its proteolytic product, termed exercise factor
  (EF) here, is released to the extracellular matrix. EF likely binds to its receptor
  and activates an unidentified signaling cascade via an autocrine or paracrine mode,
  which induces Bdnf gene expression through an unknown transcription factor. Increased
  BDNF levels will improve the health and function of the hippocampus. Interestingly,
  elevated BDNF-TrkB signaling negatively regulates Fndc5 gene expression, thus forming
  a homeostatic FNDC5/BDNF feedback loop. Green arrow pathway: Exercise also stimulates
  production and release of EF in skeletal muscle, and the released EF is distributed
  throughout the body via circulation. The circulating EF can bind to its receptor
  on hippocampal neurons and induce Bdnf gene expression there. Blue arrow pathway:
  It is possible that the circulating EF could stimulate expression of PGC-1α and
  increase Fndc5 gene expression in hippocampal neurons, thus forming an EF amplification
  loop.'
