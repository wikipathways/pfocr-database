caption: Vicious HIF activation cycle in glioma. Genetic alterations (such as loss
  of PTEN or EGFR mutation) affect critical signaling pathways that lead to HIF-1
  stabilization and activation. Transcriptional activity by HIF-1 directly upregulates
  genes that promote angiogenesis, such as VEGF. Although the upregulation and secretion
  of proangiogenic factors by tumor cells leads to a strong angiogenic response, the
  resulting tumor vasculature is abnormal, displaying leakiness due to excessive vascular
  permeability, focal thickening of vascular walls, and the formation of glomeruloids
  arising from excessive microvascular proliferation. The tumor vasculature also exhibits
  abnormal vessel branching, arteriovenous shunts, poor blood flow, and low structural
  integrity due to inappropriate strengthening of nascent vessels by smooth muscle/pericyte
  lining. Thrombotic events that arise from poor blood flow and increased tissue factor
  expression by the neoplasm lead to vascular occlusion. Combined, the vascular phenomena
  lead to further escalating levels of hypoxia, which in turn stimulates more HIF-1
  expression and activation. These events take place at the growing edge of the tumor
  and lead to a constellation of microregions of hypoxia that develop into pseudopalisading
  necrosis fueling further HIF expression, angiogenesis, and peripheral tumor expansion.
  All of these factors lead to tumor growth and resistance to therapy, with HIF-1
  as a main component of this vicious cycle.
