caption: 'Overview of the Sec translocation pathway. (a) Via the YidC insertase, some
  membrane proteins localize to the IM independent of the Sec translocon, either dependent
  or independent of the signal recognition particle (SRP) (center, dashed arrows).
  Competitive binding of the ribosome nascent chain (RNC) between SRP (left, co-translational
  translocation, or CTT) and trigger factor (TF) (right, post-translational translocation,
  or PTT) leads to diverse translocation mechanisms in most Gram-negative bacteria,
  including Rickettsia spp. Steps for these diverse pathways are superficially similar:
  (1) In binding, SRP (Ffh plus the 4.5S rRNA gene) binds strongly hydrophobic NT
  sequences of nascent polypeptides and halts further translation (CTT), or less hydrophobic
  polypeptides emerging from the ribosome are bound by TF until termination of translation,
  whereby the SecB chaperone binds the unfolded polypeptide and keeps it in a translocation
  competent state (PTT); (2) in targeting, the SRP/RNC complex is localized to the
  IM receptor FtsY, which itself binds the SecYEG complex (CTT), or SecB-bound preproteins
  are delivered to the SecA ATPase located on the cytosolic side of the Sec translocon
  (PTT); (3) in translocation, the RNC complex is transferred (with GTP hydrolysis)
  to SecYEG, where translation provides the force needed to translocate the preprotein
  to the PP (CTT), or SecA (with ATP hydrolysis) threads the substrate through the
  SecYEG channel, with the SecDF complex providing a regulatory role (PTT); (4) in
  SS processing, nonlipoproteins from both pathways are typically processed at their
  NT secretion signals (SS) by SPase I (LepB), although SSs of IM proteins are rarely
  processed; and (5) in subcellular localization, nonlipoproteins from both pathways
  are delivered to their cell envelope destinations (IM, PP, OM) or potentially further
  translocated out of the bacterial cell. NOTE: Dominant pathways for IM (CTT, orange
  arrows) and PP/OM (PTT, green arrows) proteins are distinguished. SecA-mediated
  insertion of large periplasmic loops of IM proteins of the CTT pathway is illustrated
  (blue arrow). (b) After translocation via the Sec translocon, the ‘lipobox’ within
  the SS of lipoproteins mediates the following pathway: (1) addition by lipoprotein
  diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt) of a diacylglyceryl moiety to a conserved Cys residue
  within the lipobox; (2) cleavage by SPase II (Lsp) of the NT residues adjacent to
  the modified Cys; (3) addition by lipoprotein N-acyl transferase (Lnt) of a second
  amide-linked fatty acid to the NT Cys residue; (4) insertion of some lipoproteins
  into the IM or transfer of OM lipoproteins to the Lol system; (5) release of OM
  lipoproteins from the LolCDE complex (with ATP hydrolysis) upon binding by the chaperone
  LolA; and (6) OM lipoprotein insertion into the OM, which is mediated in some bacteria
  by the assembly factor LolB. NOTE: LolE and LolB (colored black) homologs are not
  encoded within Rickettsia genomes; all other illustrated components of the Sec translocon
  and lipoprotein pathway are present in Rickettsia spp. (Table S1).'
