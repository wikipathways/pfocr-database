caption: 'Altered gene expression in the JNK signaling pathway during diapause. This
  scheme displays a generalized assembly (regardless tissue specificity) of relevant
  genes in the JNK signal pathway. Transcript levels (logarithmic fold change, LogFC)
  are given in red for upregulated, blue for downregulated and black for no significant
  change (ns; LogFC close to 0). The acronyms are listed in Additional file : Table
  S3 where also references and details of gene/protein functions are given. At the
  whole organism level diapausing flies demonstrate a moderate activation of JNK signaling
  as judged from an elevated expression of some target genes. There is also enhanced
  expression of JNK-responsive genes, known to be under FOXO (IIS) transcriptional
  control (Sesn and Fer1HCH)'
