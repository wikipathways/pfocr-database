caption: Role of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) downstream signalling in the heart. Scheme
  of gp130 receptor activation showing interleukin-6 (IL-6) type cytokines binding
  to their transmembrane receptor α-subunits, which induces homodimerization of the
  gp130 receptor β-subunits or heterodimerization of gp130 with either one of the
  structurally and functionally similar leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor
  and oncostatin M (OSM) receptor β-subunits. Following dimerization of the gp130
  receptor complex, Janus kinase-1/2 (JAK1/2) constitutively connected to the intracytoplasmatic
  membrane proximal regions of the receptor subunits are catalytically activated and
  themselves transphosphorylate tyrosine residues in the gp130 receptor intracellular
  domain. Subsequently, two major intracellular signalling cascades are triggered,
  the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1/3 pathway and the
  SH2 domain-containing cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2)/MEK/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Via the formation of complexes with growth
  factor receptor binding protein-2 (Grb2)-associated binding protein-1/2 (Gab1/2)
  and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), SHP2 activation furthermore initiates
  the Akt pathway and additionally enhances MEK/ERK signalling. Activation of gp130-mediated
  signalling plays essential roles in stem cells and cardiomyogenesis. In the adult
  heart, it is involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes.
  MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase.
