caption: Structure of the SMAD family and overview of TGF-β/SMAD and BMP/SMAD signaling
  pathway. (A) Structure of the SMAD family. (B) Comparison of the structures of R-SMAD,
  co-SMAD, and I-SMAD. Elliptical circles in the linker region indicate the PXS/TP
  (or S/TP) motif potentially phosphorylated by MAP kinases, and the square indicates
  the PY motif. (C) The TGF-β signaling pathway initiates with the binding of the
  TGF-β ligand to TβRI. Upon phosphorylation by TβRI, R-SMADs, SMAD2/3, (SMAD1/5/8
  phosphorylation by BMP pathway) form a transcriptional complex with the co-SMAD,
  SMAD4. This complex then translocates into the nucleus, associates with DNA by cooperating
  with various cofactors, and regulates target gene expression. SMAD6 and SMAD7, the
  I-Smads, function as negative regulators of TGF-β/SMAD or BMP/SMAD signaling
