caption: Model linking metabolic reprogramming to cancer cell immortality via modulation
  of DNA repair. These studies with chemical probes and RNA interference have implicated
  increased glucose and glutamine metabolism in mediated increased DNA double strand
  break repair, thereby supporting continued proliferation and resisting accelerated
  senescence. Prior work has established a key role for chromatin in regulation of
  DNA damage repair, mediated by phosphorylation of histone H2AX at sites of damage,
  leading to recruitment of 53BP1 and other repair and signaling factors, inducing
  a checkpoint signal that promotes accelerated senescence. Our data implicate cancer
  metabolic reprogramming in accelerating DNA repair, leading to H2AX dephosphorylation,
  release of 53BP1 and rapid return to proliferation. We found a role for the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP) metabolite N-acetyl-glucosamine and O-GlcNAcylation (O-GlcNAc)
  in promoting histone methylation by EZH2 and/or G9A upstream of the E3 ubiquitin
  ligase activity of the PRC1 polycomb group complex, which has a well-established
  role in non-homologous end-joining repair. This activity is normally opposed by
  the TCA cycle product α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), which can promote histone demethylation
  by JMJD demethylases. Downregulation of the TCA cycle or overproduction of the oncometabolite
  2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) blocks demethylation to accelerate DNA repair and resist
  senescence.
