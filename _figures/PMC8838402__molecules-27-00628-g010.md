caption: 'Molecular mechanisms underlying benefits of Rh2-DOX co-treatment in cancer.
  Major pathway for DOX anti-tumor effect is presented by DOX inhibition of topoisomerase
  IIa (TOP IIa) shown in the center. Internalization of lipid rafts with Rh2 increases
  membrane permeability for DOX, which enters the cell through ABC-type transporters.
  Rh2 inhibits P-glycoprotein (gp-P) which lowers DOX intracellular concentration
  and is responsible for development of drug resistance. DOX side effects may originate
  from ROS-production which is NADPH-dependent, and Rh2 inhibits NADPH-dependent DOX
  redox cycling and possibly glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), by analogy
  with structurally similar enzyme inhibitors. Antimetastatic and anti-apoptotic pathways
  (left) are inhibited due to Rh2 interaction with annexin A2 (AnxA2). Abbreviations:
  SOD—superoxide dismutase; NOX—NADPH oxidase; p22—coactivator of NOX; p50—subunit
  of NF-κB transcription factor, tPA—tissue plasminogen activator, MMP—matrix metalloproteinase,
  CSC—cancer stem cells, EMT—epithelial–mesenchymal transformation.'
