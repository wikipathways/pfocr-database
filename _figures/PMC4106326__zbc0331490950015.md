caption: Model depicting how PPARβ/δ promotes H-RAS-induced cellular senescence, whereas
  ER stress attenuates H-RAS-induced cellular senescence. Previous studies showed
  that PPARβ/δ promotes H-RAS-induced senescence and inhibits cell proliferation by
  potentiating p-ERK and repressing p-AKT (left and right boxes, respectively) ().
  H-RAS-induced senescence is promoted by the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and inhibited by
  the PI3K/AKT pathway. This collectively leads to increased expression of proteins
  that mediate senescence including p16, p21, p27, and p53. PPARβ/δ promotes senescence
  by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway, allowing for increased RAF/MEK/ERK activity.
  This was previously shown to be mediated by PPARβ/δ-dependent modulation of RASGRP1,
  PDPK1, and ILK expression (). The present studies extend this model (middle box)
  by showing that ER stress and ER stress-associated UPR attenuates H-RAS-induced
  cellular senescence by repressing p-ERK and increasing p-AKT signaling. PPARβ/δ
  represses ER stress by inhibiting p-AKT/mTOR activity leading to promotion of H-RAS-induced
  cellular senescence and inhibition of cell proliferation.
