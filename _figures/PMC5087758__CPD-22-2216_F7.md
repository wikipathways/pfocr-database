caption: RvE1 Biosynthesis. RvE1 is synthesized through neutrophil-endothelial cell
  crosstalk from EPA. Endothelial cells produces an RvE1 intermediate, 18R-hydroxy-EPA,
  through the 15-LOX pathway (either a 15-LOX or an acetylated COX-2 by aspirin).
  The leukocyte processes 18R-hydroxy-EPA through the 5-LOX pathway to produce RvE1,
  the final active mediator that is released to act locally having a short half-life.
  Synthetic RvE1, which has a longer half-life, inhibited neutrophil infiltration
  in different disease models including peritonitis, colitis, acute lung injury, asthma
  and periodontal disease. It also promoted molecular pathways characteristic to the
  resolution phase of inflammation.
