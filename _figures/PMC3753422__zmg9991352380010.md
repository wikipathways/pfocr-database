caption: 'Scheme of carbohydrate and fatty acids metabolism. Arrows represent the
  flow of the metabolic pathways, and dashed lines indicate the stimulation or inhibition
  of Vpr/PPARβ/δ on the metabolites in the pathway. The inhibitory effect of Vpr/PPARβ/δ
  on pyruvate catabolism is mediated by reduced PDC activity. Abbreviation: NADH,
  reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.'
