caption: Proposed mechanism for increased ROS production in combo-treated cells. Iron
  enters in the cell and in part generates the labile iron pool (LIP), while a part
  is stored in the ferritin complex (FT). Cetuximab binds to EGFR and promotes the
  EGFR pathway and metabolic downregulation; VitC enters in CRC cells and triggers,
  by interacting with LIP, ROS formation, which in turn can chemically reduce FT and
  promote iron release. The latter will react with VitC, which is continuously provided
  to cells and will foster increased ROS production with consequent membrane damage
  and cell death.
