caption: The rate of change for genes encoding upstream and downstream NFLs is shown
  on the left. The biological pathway is indicated in the parenthesis. The function
  of Upstream and downstream NFLs within various signaling pathways is summarized
  on the right. The upstream NFLs interact with a receptor (R), while downstream NFLs
  interact with transcription factors that activate target genes. These interactions
  are either direct or indirect (e.g., with peptidoglycan shown as PG). Genes involved
  in Imd and Toll are from D. melanogaster and the rest are human genes. The data
  for human genes are from Liu et al. (2014) except for IKBα which is from Song et
  al. (2012). The data for D. melanogaster is from Sackton et al. (2007) except for
  Pirk which is from Han et al. (2013). The downstream genes generally have low dNdS
  values (all except for Cactus ≤ 0.08) and the variance amongst downstream genes
  (sd=0.028) is lower than upstream ones (sd=0.053)
