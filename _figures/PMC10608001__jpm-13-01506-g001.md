caption: Activation of the coagulation pathway and oxidative stress in cardiopulmonary
  bypass (CPB). The contact surface is responsible for producing activated factor
  XII (FXIIa), which induces the intrinsic coagulation pathway, leading to thrombin
  formation. Factor XIIa converts the high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) into
  bradykinin. Bradykinin stimulates the release of nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines.
  Cytokines stimulate the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and potentiate the formation
  of thrombin and clot formation and have direct effects on leukocytes. CPB initiates
  multiple processes that stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  The main forms of cardiac ROS are superoxide (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
