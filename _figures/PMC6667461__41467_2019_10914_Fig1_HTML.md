caption: Overview of direct and indirect pro-allergenic immune responses to anti-ulcer
  drugs (AUD). a, f With regards to oral allergens, the gastric pH elevation by AUDs,
  most dominantly by proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) and H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA),
  leads to reduced pepsin activation and impaired food antigen degradation, enabling
  persistence of ingested epitopes and their uptake in the intestines–,,. This leads
  to formation of antigen-specifc IgE and promotion of a Th2 type dominated immune
  milieu resulting in eosinophilic inflammation and allergic symptoms,,. b–e With
  regards to directly AUD-associated innate and adjuvant immune effects, PPIs can
  (b) induce AhR-mediated mast cell activation synergizing with IgE-FcɛRI signaling
  and resulting in mediator release and enhanced CD63 expression via the S1P pathway;
  both mechanisms result in allergic symptoms manifestation; (c) H2RAs stimulate the
  release of Th2 cytokines from both monocyte and Th2 cells leading to a B-cell isotype
  switch resulting in IgG1 (mice) and IgE production (humans, mice); (d) Further,
  H2RAs promote an increase in Th2 cytokine releasing iNKT cells, particularly when
  co-exposed to lipid antigens, and increase in CD1d+ DCs via TLR2 activation; (e)
  Sucralfate, an aluminum compound, can induce IL-4 release from DCs along with IL-5,
  and caspase-dependent IL-1β secretion from monocytes promoting an isotype switch
  in B-cells into IgE production; f The resulting disturbance of gut microbiota composition,,
  additionally supports a pro-allergic Th2 milieu and enhances allergic symptoms
