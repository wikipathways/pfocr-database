caption: 'Cholesterol transport in the CNS. APOE is synthesized by astrocytes and
  assembles free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipids (PLs) to form HDL-like particles.
  (1) Lipidation of these lipoparticles is facilitated via the mobilization and distribution
  of lipids to the cell surface by ABCA1/G1. Once secreted in the extracellular space,
  these HDL-like particles are directed either toward the circulation through the
  BBB and/or to neurons requiring lipids. (2) These APOE-HDL-like particles are recognized
  and endocytosed by members of the cell surface LDLR family (LDLR, LRP, APOER2, VLDLR),
  and (3) the FC is released within neurons and can be used for neurite elongation
  and/or synaptogenesis (4). As a result of lipid internalization, the endogenous
  synthesis of cholesterol within neurons (via the HMGCR pathway) is repressed (5).
  Excess cholesterol will be removed from neurons through its conversion into 24S-hydroxycholesterol
  (24S-OH) which is mediated by cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase (CYP46) (6). This sterol
  can now freely cross lipophilic membranes of the BBB and exit the brain for elimination
  (7). APOE or E: apolipoprotein E; BBB: blood-brain barrier; RER: rough endoplasmic
  reticulum; HMGCR: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; HDL: high-density
  lipoprotein; LDLR: low-density lipoprotein receptor.'
