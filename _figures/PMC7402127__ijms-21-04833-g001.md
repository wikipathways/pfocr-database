caption: 'Schematic representation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
  signaling pathway. A variety of extracellular signals, such as cellular stress and
  cytokines, can activate the p38 MAPK pathway. This leads to the initiation of MAPK
  phosphorylation cascade, in which MAPKKK phosphorylate the p38 MAPK-specific MAPKKs
  MKK3, MKK4, or MKK6. Subsequently, the four isoforms of p38 MAPK (α, β, δ, and γ)
  are phosphorylated, thereby activating various p38 MAPK substrates. Substrates can
  be transcription factors such as ATF2, CHOP, and MEF2C, protein kinases such as
  (MAPKAP)-2 as well as other proteins such as Cdc25 and GS. Phosphorylated substrates
  go on to elicit varied biological responses. The duration of signaling is controlled
  by phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 1; protein phosphatase 2A or MAPK phosphatase.
  Abbreviations: CHOP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein; MEF2C, myocyte
  enhancer factor 2C; (MAPKAP)-2, MAPK-activated protein; GS, Glycogen synthase.'
