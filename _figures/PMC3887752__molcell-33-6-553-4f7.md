caption: Schematic signal pathway by siRNA targeting AIMP2-DX2 in NCI-H460 cells.
  Based on our studies, AIMP2-DX2 has an effect on Gluts expression. When Glut expression
  decreases due to AIMP2-DX2 down-regulation, glucose influx decreases and this decreased
  signal is transmited to EGFR via glycosyltransferases, affecting the EGFR/MAPK pathway.
  The delivered signal, as a whole, causes a decrease of eIF4E expression, which may
  lead to transcription reduction resulting decreased cell proliferation.  and  showed
  the link between GnT-V/GnT-III and EGFR.
