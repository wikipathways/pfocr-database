caption: Schematic of the reversal circuit downstream of FLP sensory neurons showing
  the expression of FRPR-19 and the potential source of FLP-14 peptides. A positive
  feedback via an excitatory FLP-14/FRPR-19 peptide signaling could contribute to
  the maintenance of a high responsiveness under a regime of repeated noxious stimuli.
  Presumably, a stimulus-dependent activation of the FLP-14/FRPR-19 positive feedback
  loop may counteract antagonistic habituation mechanisms. The place of action of
  these pro-habituation mechanisms is unknown. Additional FLP-14 sources are not ruled
  out by our data (not depicted).
