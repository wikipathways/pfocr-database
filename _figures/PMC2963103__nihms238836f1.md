caption: Normal biology of the VHL-HIF axis in the setting of (A) normoxia and (B)
  hypoxia. In normoxic conditions, HIFα is hydroxylated on specific proline residues
  by prolyl-hydroxylases. VHL acts as the sensor for these hydroxylated proline residues
  as part of the VHL-E3 ubiquitin ligase. This polyubiquitinates HIFα and marks it
  for degradation by the proteasome. In hypoxic conditions (or in the presence of
  aberrant VHL), HIFα is allowed to accumulate in the cell. (C) It associates with
  HIFβ, and this complex translocates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor
  binding to hypoxia response elements and up-regulating oxygen sensitive genes. These
  include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor
  (PDGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1),
  carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX), erythropoietin (EPO), and others. Examples of certain
  ligands’ receptors are given, including VEGF receptor (VEGFR), PDGF receptor (PDGFR),
  and the receptor for TNFα, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Shown is the
  downstream signaling for 1 of these receptors, VEGFR, including through the PI3
  kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR, p38 MAP kinase (p38MAPK), and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways.
  Examples of agents that impact on this cascade are given, and where they act on
  the pathway is shown.
