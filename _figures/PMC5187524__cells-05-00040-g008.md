caption: 'Possible modulation of CBF by pharmacologic agents in COPD. Representative
  schemes of the possible sites of action of the pharmacologic agents tested on nasal
  cilia obtained from Control, At Risk, and COPD subjects. Information presented here
  is derived from the review of signaling pathways involved in mammalian ciliary beating
  [], and references in our COPD paper [] and in this review. Beta agonists cause
  an immediate cAMP-dependent increase in CBF, followed by a cAMP-dependent increase
  in intracellular calcium, which in turn increases CBF. Salmeterol (1 µM), a beta-adrenergic
  agonist, increases CBF in a cAMP-dependent manner via beta two receptors (G-alpha-s
  coupled R) expressed at the apical membranes of epithelial cells—i.e., acts via
  increased cAMP, PKA activation, and increased CBF due to phosphorylation of axonemal
  proteins. Tiotropium Bromide (5 µM) results in muscarinic AchR inhibition (i.e.,
  inhibits muscarinic M3 receptors on parasympathetic postganglionic effector cell
  junctions) and plays a role in increased intracellular calcium leading to increased
  CBF; also, increased intracellular calcium activates NOS leading to increased cGMP
  and increased cGMP-dependent protein kinase and increased CBF. The effect is on
  a G-alpha-q coupled R and IP3 release which leads to increased calcium influx. Licofelone
  (10 µM), a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways—i.e., inhibits
  5-LO LTs (LTB4, C4 and D4), prostaglandins, and thromboxanes. Inhibition of both
  pathways leads to a shift into the metabolism of AA to CYP metabolites (EETs and
  20-HETE) which activate influx of calcium into the cell and increased CBF. PKA and
  PKG activation are also possible. Luteolin (100 µM) inhibits activity of metalloproteinases
  MMP-2 and MMP-9. MMPs are not expressed in normal healthy tissues but in diseased
  tissues that are inflamed or undergoing remodeling and repair and MMPs may be compartmentalized
  in close proximity to the cell surface—i.e., soluble and cell surface forms. YM976
  (100 nM) inhibits PDE4 (PDEIV) resulting in increased cAMP and PKA activation and
  increased CBF. HNP-1 (6 µM), human neutrophil protein-1 inhibits serpins and also
  acts as an endogenous antimicrobial agent. Note that increased intracellular calcium
  leads to activation of ca-dependent cyclases (AC1, 3 and 8) which increase cAMP
  and lead to increased CBF. In summary, whether the agent modulates a receptor (adrenergic/cholinergic),
  an enzyme (5-LO, COX, PDE4, serpins), or structural components (MMPs soluble and
  cell surface forms)—i.e., different mechanisms of action—the final outcome is an
  increased CBF. From the literature, we know that the main second messengers following
  receptor stimulation are cAMP and calcium and the final step in increased CBF is
  phosphorylation of axonemal proteins, suggesting a common signaling pathway among
  all the agents tested. Further investigation of the intracellular signaling pathways
  is needed. R: receptor; IP3: inositol tris-phosphate; P450: cytochrome P450; 5-LO:
  5-lipoxynase; COX: cyclooxygenase; EETs and 20-HETE cytochrome P450 metabolites
  that result in increased calcium influx into the cell; PDEIV, phosphodiesterase
  type 4; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate;
  NOS, nitric oxide synthase; PKA, protein kinase A; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase;
  sAC, soluble adenylyl cyclase; tmACs, transmembrane adenylyl cyclases; Serpins,
  serine protease inhibitors.'
