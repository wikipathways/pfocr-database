caption: Activation and inactivation pathways for hypoxia-induced factor 1 (HIF-1)
  in normoxia, hypoxia/anoxia, and cancer. (a) In normoxic normal cells, molecular
  oxygen (O2) sensing by membrane NADPH oxidase results in formation of superoxide
  radical anions and subsequently in the control of the HIF-1 signaling pathway via
  proteolytic degradation of the HIF-1α subunit. These events prevent the recruitment
  of functional HIF-1 which results from heterodimerization of HIF-1α and β subunits.
  In anoxia/hypoxia, a severe drop in the levels of NADPH oxidase-driven superoxide
  radical anion prevents oxidative and proteolytic damage of the HIF-1α subunit which
  then becomes available to form functional HIF-1 and results in signaling activation.
  In cancer cells, the HIF-1 signaling pathway may be overexpressed via, for instance,
  mechanisms illustrated in Panel b. (b) This panel details hydroxylation and the
  subsequent steps of the HIF-1 inactivation pathway and its disruption in cancer
  cells. Mechanisms that neutralize the HIF-1 pathway in cancer cells may include
  alteration of gene expression for succinate dehydrogenase and fumarase (the net
  results of which are a rise in succinate levels which interfere with the hydroxylation
  steps by product inhibition) (mechanism 1) and for von Hippel-Lindau protein (mechanism
  2) (preventing formation of E3-ubiquitin ligase proteic complex and hence HIF-1α
  inactivation). Other comments are in the text.
