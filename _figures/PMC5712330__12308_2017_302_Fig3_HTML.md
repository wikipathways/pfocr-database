caption: Overview of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways. Canonical
  NF-κB signaling is induced upon activation of cytokine receptors (e.g., TNFR1, IL-1R),
  pattern recognition Toll-like receptors (TLR) or B cell and T cell antigen receptors
  (BCR or TCR). Each of the different receptor subtypes employ distinct adaptor proteins
  and signaling complexes (e.g., Myddosome, CBM) that converge and engage the IKK
  complex, consisting of the regulatory subunit NEMO and the catalytic subunits IKKα
  and IKKβ. NEMO is regulated in multiple ways including through linear polyubiquitination
  by the LUBAC complex consisting of HOIP, HOIL1, and SHARPIN. IKK phosphorylation
  of serine residues on cytosolic IκBs (IκBα/β/ε) or their precursors triggers IκB
  ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Classical NF-κB dimers, like p50/RelA
  and p50/c-Rel are released and enter the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Under
  physiological conditions the canonical NF-κB pathway induces rapid but transient
  transcriptional responses. Non-canonical NF-κB signaling is regulated by kinase
  NIK, which is normally degraded in resting cells by an E3 ligase complex consisting
  of TRAF2/TRAF3 adaptor proteins and the E3 ligases BIRC2/3. Activation of a specific
  subset of TNFR family members, like CD40, BAFFR, or APRIL, leads to stabilization
  of NIK via inactivation of the TRAF/BIRC complex. Increased NIK protein levels promote
  IKKα phosphorylation, which in turn phosphorylates RelB/p100, thereby inducing partial
  proteosomal processing of p100 leading to release of RelB/p52 dimers that translocate
  to the nucleus. Non-canonical NF-κB signaling results in a more delayed and sustained
  transcriptional response

  description: Overview of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways.
    Canonical NF-κB signaling is induced upon activation of cytokine receptors (e.g.,
    TNFR1, IL-1R), pattern recognition Toll-like receptors (TLR) or B cell and T cell
    antigen receptors (BCR or TCR). Each of the different receptor subtypes employ

    through linear polyubiquitination by the LUBAC complex consisting of HOIP, HOIL1,
    and SHARPIN. IKK phosphorylation of serine residues on cytosolic IκBs (IκBα/β/ε)
    or their precursors triggers IκB ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Classical
    NF-κB dimers, like p50/RelA and p50/c-Rel are released and enter the nucleus to
