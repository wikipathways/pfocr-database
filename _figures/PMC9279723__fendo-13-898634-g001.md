caption: Signaling pathways involved in oxidative stress-induced autophagy in bone
  remodeling. In osteoblasts, ROS induced an excessive increase in Beclin-1 levels
  by activation of the JNK/c-jun pathway, which triggered excessive autophagy, exacerbated
  osteoblasts apoptosis, and reduced bone formation. On the other hand, oxidative
  stress activates protective autophagy through ROS/SIRT1/FOXO3, ROS/AMPK/FOXO3, ROS/AMPK/mTOR
  and ROS/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways to remove excessive ROS within a certain range, promoting
  the survival of osteoblasts and increasing bone formation. Likewise in osteoblasts,
  oxidative stress-induced protective autophagy is also present in osteocytes, which
  is achieved by ROS/MAPK/ERK/mTOR pathway. In osteoclasts, Oxidative stress-induced
  autophagy promotes osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption through the ROS/ER and
  ROS/TFEB pathways.
