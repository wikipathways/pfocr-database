caption: The known degradation pathway of caffeine in microorganisms. The pathway
  of N-demethylation in Pseudomonas CBB1 is shown as I. The pathway of C-8 Oxidative
  in Pseudomonas CBB1 is shown as II. The pathway of caffeine in fungi is shown as
  III. Solid arrows represent major pathways. Dashed arrows represent secondary pathways.
