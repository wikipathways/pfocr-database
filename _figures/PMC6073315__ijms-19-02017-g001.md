caption: 'Schematic illustration of hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis.
  Peripheral signals such as leptin and insulin enter the CNS, and act on their specific
  receptors in key hypothalamic regions that regulate food intake and energy expenditure.
  Leptin stimulates POMC neurons and inhibits NPY/AgRP neurons in the ARC, resulting
  in the inhibition of food intake via the action of MC4R-expressing neurons in the
  PVN, and other brain areas. TH also regulates a number of other metabolic processes
  by acting on hypothalamic metabolic sensors. Central T3 regulates feeding through
  mTOR signaling pathway targeting orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons in the ARC,
  and exerts a negative feedback on TRH and MC4R expression in the PVN. αMSH: melanocyte
  stimulating hormone; ARC: arcuate nucleus; MC4R: melanocortin 4 receptor; mTOR:
  mammalian target of rapamycin; Ob-Rb: leptin receptor; NPY: neuropeptide Y; POMC:
  proopiomelanocortin; PVN: paraventricular nucleus; T3: triiodothyronine; TRH: Thyrotropin-releasing
  hormone; CRH: corticotropin-releasing hormone; green arrow: activation; red blind-ended
  arrow: inhibition; solid line: direct action; dashed line: indirect action or other
  pathway intervention.'
