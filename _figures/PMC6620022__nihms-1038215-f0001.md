caption: '(A) PCA scores plot generated from 1D 1H NMR spectra from cell lysates of
  wild type T3M4 cells (WT,  n=8), WT cells treated with 10 nM of gemcitabine (WT+,  n=9),
  gemcitabine-resistant (GemR,  n=10) cells, and GemR cells treated with 10 nM of
  gemcitabine (GemR+,  n=8). Please see  and  for explanation of excluded outliers.
  The ellipses correspond to 95% confidence intervals for a normal distribution. (B)
  Metabolic tree diagram generated from the PCA score plots. The number at each node
  is the p-value calculated from the Mahalanobis distance between each group. The
  coloring is identical to the PCA scores plot. (C) Back-scaled loadings plot generated
  from a validated OPLS-DA model (R2 0.99, Q2 0.90, CV-ANOVA p-value 7.94 × 10−7,
  permutation test p-value 0) comparing the WT and WT+ 1D 1H NMR datasets. Positive
  peaks indicate an increase in WT+ and negative peaks are a decrease in WT+. (D)
  Metabolic pathway summarizing the key metabolite differences between WT and WT+
  as determined from the OPLS-DA back-scaled loadings plot in C. An up arrow indicates
  an increase in the metabolite in WT+ and a down arrow indicates a decrease in the
  metabolite in WT+. (E) Back-scaled loadings plot generated from a validated OPLS-DA
  model (R2 0.99, Q2 0.96, CV-ANOVA p-value 2.52 X 10−7, permutation test p-value
  0) comparing the WT and GemR 1D 1H NMR datasets. Positive peaks indicate an increase
  in GemR and negative peaks are a decrease in GemR (F) Metabolic pathway summarizing
  the key metabolite differences between WT and GemR as determined from the OPLS-DA
  back-scaled loadings plot in E. An up arrow indicates an increase in the metabolite
  in Gem R and a down arrow indicates a decrease in the metabolite in GemR. The metabolite
  labeling in the OPLS-DA back-scaled loadings plots in C and E are numbered as follows:
  1, branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine); 2, lactate; 3, alanine;
  4, acetate; 5, glutamate; 6, glutamine; 7,glutathione; 8,malate; 9,aspartate; 10,
  creatinine; 11, creatinine phosphate; 12, glycerophosphocholine; 13, taurine, 14,
  glycine, 15, myo-inositol 16, AXP (AMP, ADP, and ATP).'
