caption: Although TFR1 facilitates iron uptake, it will be degraded by β-TRCP ubiquitin
  ligase leading to ferroptosis resistance. OTUB1 or ABCC5 inhibits SLC7A11 ubiquitination
  and degradation, and CD44 or H2S-mediated persulfidation of OTUB1 enhances this
  event. However, it is unclear the mechanism of SLC7A11 degradation in proteasome.
  MIB1 ubiquitin ligase induces NRF2 ubiquitination and degradation, which is reversed
  by USP11 deubiquitinating enzyme. Under base condition, the interaction of KEAP1
  with NRF2 recruits Cul3-RBX1 ubiquitin ligase to NRF2 for proteasomal-dependent
  degradation in response to ferroptosis inducers (RSL3, cetuximab). However, in response
  to oxidative stress, KEAP1 dissociates from NRF2 and increases NRF2 protein stability
  resulting in ferroptosis resistance. Although p14(ARF)/p53 pathway inhibits SLC7A11
  resulting in ferroptosis sensitivity, p14(ARF) is degraded by CRL2-KLHDC3 ubiquitin
  ligase, which in turn causes ferroptosis resistance.
