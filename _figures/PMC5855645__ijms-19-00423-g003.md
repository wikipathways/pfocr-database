caption: Schematic diagram proposed mechanism of humoral IL-6-mediated inflammation
  in triggering EC damage. (A) The IL-6 cytokine is an important anti-inflammatory
  protein for regulation of cell survival by binding to the cell membrane receptor
  IL-6R/gp130 complex leading to activation of JAK, subsequent activation of other
  signal transduction molecules which influences nuclear gene transcription (down
  arrow) via the classic signaling pathway; (B) Excessive sIL-6R (up arrow) in the
  blood, resultant of cleavage from the membrane (shedding) or de novo synthesis,
  could bind to excess IL-6 and form IL-6/sIL-6R/gp130 complex on ECs. This complex
  formation on the EC membrane would result in the activation of signal transduction
  kinases and induce a pro-inflammatory response by activating the trans-signaling
  pathway.
