caption: In Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Ross River virus (RRV)-infected cells,
  viral replication complexes form at the PM. Via recruitment of p85 to a YXXM motif
  in nsP3, p110 is freed from regulation and can catalyse the conversion of PIP2 to
  PIP3 and recruitment and activation of AKT to the PM. Via multiple downstream effector
  pathways, the internalization of viral replication complexes as well as a heightened
  cellular metabolic activity and likely other yet undescribed states are promoted.
