caption: 'Fatty acid biosynthesis pathways (a) and the TCA (glycerolipid) metabolism
  pathways (b) of Mychonastes homosphaera. ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase, MAT: malonyl-CoA:ACP
  transacylase, KAS3: the beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier protein synthase 3, KAS1/2: the
  beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase, KAR: the 3-oxoacyl-ACP reductase, HAD:
  the beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase, EAR: enoyl-ACP reductase, OAH: oleoyl-acyl-carrier-protein
  hydrolase, PAH: palmitoyl-protein thioesterase, GK: glycerol kinase, GPAT: glycerol-3phosphate
  O-acyltransferase, AGPAT: 1-acylglycerol-3phosphate O-acyltransferase, PP: phosphatidate
  phosphatase, DGAT: acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, PDAT: phospholipid:diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase. Each coloured square represents a homologous gene, and different
  color represent different species. Pathway reconstruction was performed for fatty
  acid biosynthesis and TCA synthesis based on the KEGG database'
papertitle: Genome analyses provide insights into the evolution and adaptation of
  the eukaryotic Picophytoplankton Mychonastes homosphaera.
