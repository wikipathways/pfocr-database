caption: (R,S′)-MNF blocks the growth of PANC-1 xenograft tumors in mice. (A) YAP/TAZ
  is regulated by the canonical Hippo pathway, AMPK-dependent phosphorylation, and
  the β-catenin destruction complex. YAP/TAZ translocation to the nucleus and interaction
  with TEAD transcription factors induces target genes such as GLI2, which encodes
  a transcription factor that controls the expression of several genes implicated
  in tumorigenesis (e.g., CYR61, MMP7, MCL1, BIRC2). Administration of (R,S′)-MNF
  led to significant downregulation in the expression of the indicated protein-encoded
  genes. Inhibition of the glycolytic pathway combined with reduced expression of
  LHDA, caused by the downregulation of c-Myc and HIF-1α gene and protein levels,
  negatively impacts the production of l-lactate by the tumor and its release into
  the circulation. Inhibition of glutamine uptake and its conversion to glutamate
  has a negative impact on the production of metabolic intermediates within the TCA
  cycle for mitochondrial ATP production. (B) Bitopic function of (R,S′)-MNF contributes
  to its anti-tumor activity. (R,S′)-MNF is a biased agonist of the β2-AR by promoting
  its coupling to the Gαs/adenylate cyclase (AC)/cAMP/PKA signal transduction, while
  preventing the recruitment and activation of β-arrestin 1, a critical regulator
  of tumorigenesis through ERK activation and formation of protein complexes with
  YAP and E2F transcription factors. The selective β2-AR antagonist, ICI 118551, inhibits
  salmeterol-stimulated cAMP production and associated PKA activity, while promoting
  basal β-arrestin 1 function. PKA blocks AKT- and ERK-mediated phosphorylation of
  target proteins and enhances LATS-dependent inhibition of YAP/TAZ pro-tumorigenic
  activity. LATS1/2 is activated by PKA, but inactivated by mechanical cues (e.g.,
  integrin engagement) and GPCR-RhoA-mediated F-actin. Binding of the bioactive lipid,
  lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), to GPR55 activates signaling cascades implicated
  in cell proliferation, invasion and survival through coupling to Gαq/11 and Gα12/13.
  Binding of (R,S′)-MNF to GPR55 directly inhibits its function. The illustrations
  were created using Canvas X Draw v.7.0.2 for macOS (Canvas GFX, Boston, MA).
