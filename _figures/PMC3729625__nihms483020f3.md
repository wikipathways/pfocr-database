caption: Glucose metabolism is integrated with autophagy regulation on multiple levels,
  through modulating glycolysis, ER stress, cellular glutathione and reactive oxygen
  species levels. On the one hand, in response to glucose deprivation, autophagy can
  use glycogen stores to generate glucose. On the other hand, glucose levels influence
  glycosylation, glycolysis and redox status, all have complex relationships to the
  regulation of autophagy. Decreased glucose increases ER stress and thereby induces
  autophagy, which can be attenuated by addition of mannose, and exacerbated by thapsigargin
  or tunicamycin. Depletion of glucose may lead to depletion of glucose-6-phosphate,
  which decreases metabolites produced by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), resulting
  in increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased autophagy.
  Increase of intracellular reduced glutathione, while can decrease ROS and inhibit
  autophagy, in certain cell types and conditions is also associated with an increase
  in autophagy. Low glucose-6-phosphate levels also allow GAPDH to interact with mTOR,
  activating autophagy. Increased glycolysis enzyme GAPDH also increases Atg12, and
  thereby increases autophagy. The enzyme TIGAR can be activated by p53, activates
  hexokinase, and shifts cells away from glycolysis to the PPP, resulting in decreased
  ROS production and decreased autophagy.
