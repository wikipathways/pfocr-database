caption: The proposed model. A proposed model for the signaling pathway of calcium-induced
  keratinocyte differentiation. In high calcium conditions, PP1 is recruited to the
  calcium-dependent E-cadherin-β-catenin-PIP5K1α complex in the plasma membrane to
  activate PIP5K1α, which increases the synthesis of the substrate PIP2 for both PLC-γ1
  and PI3K. PLC-γ1 hydrolyzes PIP2 to IP3, which in turn increases calcium concentration
  leading to keratinocyte differentiation.
