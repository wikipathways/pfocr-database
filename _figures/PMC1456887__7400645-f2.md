caption: PKR-like ER kinase-dependent stress response to protein misfolding in the
  endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells. The unfolded protein response in mammalian
  cells leads to the activation of the transmembrane kinases, Ire1α, Ire1β, PKR-like
  ER kinase (PERK) and the transmembrane activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6).
  The PERK pathway is activated after dissociation of BiP from PERK monomers, causing
  dimerization and activation of the cytosolic kinase domain. (Note that the role
  of BiP in this process is unclear ().) This activation leads to the phosphorylation
  of eIF2α, causing attenuation of translation and thereby alleviating endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress. However, translation of transcription factor ATF4 is stimulated
  and, with activation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), leads to an induction of
  genes involved in amino-acid synthesis. The cellular level of glutathione is increased,
  which can potentially protect the cell from damage caused by reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) produced during ER stress. Perturbation of either the PERK or ATF4 pathway
  leads to an increase in the production of ER-derived ROS.
