caption: Scheme of the proposed pathways of Tryptophan. Tryptophan can be metabolized
  along the Kynurenine pathway along three different branches to Anthranilic acid,
  3-OH Kynurenine, and Kynurenic acid, depending to the enzymatic repertoire of the
  cells. Tryptophan can also be metabolized along the Melatonin pathway through the
  synthesis of 5-OH Tryptamine (Serotonin) and by using preferentially different enzymes
  depending on the cellular repertoire.
