caption: THF and 1,4-dioxane degradation pathways. Proposed reaction pathways for
  THF and dioxane metabolism in CB1190, annotated with enzymes based on transcriptomic
  results in this study. The THF pathway is adapted from the pathways proposed by
  Bernhardt and Diekmann (), Skinner et al. (), and Thiemer et al. (). The 1,4-dioxane
  pathway is adapted from Grostern et al. (). The gene locus tags for the enzymes
  in the THF pathway are Psed_6976 to Psed_6979 for the THF monooxygenase thmADBC,
  Psed_0131 for alcohol dehydrogenase, Psed_6971 for hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase,
  Psed_6970 for 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, Psed_6975 for succinate semialdehyde
  dehydrogenase (sad), and Psed_6981 for aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldH). The locus
  tags are the same for the dioxane pathway, except for those for the secondary alcohol
  dehydrogenase (Psed_0131, Psed_2070, Psed_4156, or Psed_6971) and the aldehyde dehydrogenase
  (Psed_6971, Psed_6975, or Psed_6981). TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
