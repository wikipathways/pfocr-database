caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the subset of day-one genes that differentiate
  long-term success or failure, divided into two groups (F and G) following an unsupervised
  cluster analysis. The network pathway on the left contains 11 of the 25 cluster
  F genes, and is primarily involved in cell death and survival. The pathway on the
  right contains 10 of the 12 cluster G genes, and is primarily associated with cell
  cycle regulation. Class prediction genes are represented in gray.
