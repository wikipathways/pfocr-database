caption: The figure shows a schematic representation of the “glutathione pathway.”
  Glutathione (GSH) is synthesized from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine by γ-glutamylcysteine
  synthetase and glutathione synthetase. Glutathione redox state is regulated, in
  part, by glutathione peroxidases, forming oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and by a
  reaction catalyzed by glutathione reductase. Glutathione is conjugated to substrates
  both through the action of the glutathione S-transferases and through non-enzymatic
  reactions. Glutathione conjugates can be excreted from the cells by members of the
  ABCC transporter family.
