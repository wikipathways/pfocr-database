caption: The role of SHH in cerebellar development. Granule neuronal precursors (A–D)
  migrate tangentially from the rhombic lip and may use the SHH pathway in transient
  autocrine manner. Purkinje neurons and later-born Bergmann glia (B) derive from
  the ventricular zone and migrate toward the EGL. SHH from the Purkinje neurons induces
  Bergmann glia maturation (C). In the later EGL, granule neuronal precursors proliferate
  in the outer zone, utilizing SHH secreted from Purkinje neurons. At the same time,
  mature glia send their extensions toward the inner EGL (D) and these or other cortical
  cells may provide factors that promote the differentiation if granule neurons, antagonizing
  the effects of SHH. Granule cells then migrate on glial fibers across the molecular
  and Purkinje layers to form the IGL. Maintained autocrine SHH signaling in the EGL
  (E) may result in the development of cerebellar tumors. (Reprinted with permission
