caption: Model for the enhanced level of induced protection against Pst in Arabidopsis
  plants simultaneously expressing SAR and ISR. Pathogen-induced SAR is dependent
  on SA, requires NPR1, and is associated with PR gene expression (, ). WCS417r-mediated
  ISR requires responsiveness to JA and ethylene, also is dependent on NPR1 but is
  not associated with PR gene expression (), indicating that downstream of NPR1 the
  pathways diverge. PR proteins that accumulate in plants expressing SAR are unlikely
  to contribute to induced resistance against P. syringae pathogens (). Cross-talk
  between the SAR and the ISR pathway is absent. Simultaneous activation of SAR and
  ISR results in an additive effect on the level of protection against Pst. This is
  not accompanied by an increase in the expression of the Npr1 gene. Therefore, the
  enhanced level of induced protection against Pst must be accomplished through the
  parallel activation of so far unidentified defense responses that are all effective
  against Pst. The complementary effects on the level of protection could be achieved
  through the production of distinct (model I) or more of the same antibacterial gene
  products (model II). In both cases, simultaneous induction of SAR and ISR leads
  to enhanced levels of defensive components that are active against Pst. Question
  marks indicate unidentified defensive components.

    Cross-talk between the SAR and the ISR pathway is absent. Simultaneous activation
