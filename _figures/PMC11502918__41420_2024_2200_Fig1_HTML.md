caption: 'UPR: A signaling pathway in response to ER stress, illustrating the three
  primary signaling branches of the UPR activated by ER stress sensors: ATF6, PERK,
  and IRE1α (A) Activated GRP-78 causes the release of three ER stress sensors: ATF-6,
  PERK, and IRE-1α, (B) ATF6 gets fragmented as the result of GRP-78 activation generating
  ATF6f which gets translocated to the nucleus to activate ERAD pathway, (C) phosphorylated
  PERK causes phosphorylation of eIF-2α, which inhibits overall translation but activates
  ATF4 inducing apoptosis, (D) Phosphorylation of IRE1α generates the spliced product
  of XBP1 i.e. XBP1s, affecting autophagy, metastasis and lipid biosynthesis. (Created
