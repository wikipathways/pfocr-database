caption: RNA-editing regulated genes in LUAD are enriched in apoptosis and innate
  immune-related genes. Biocarta pathway enrichments of genes with 5 or more predicted
  regulatory RNA editing sites (A). Pathway diagram showing the genes that are enriched
  in the apoptosis (B) and innate immune-related pathways (C). Blue and red colored
  proteins indicate positive and negative regulation by ADAR-mediated RNA editing,
  respectively. The MAVS protein is colored in both blue and red because there are
  both positive and negative regulatory edits within its 3′ UTR.
