caption: 'Mechanism of Th2-low asthma. Th17 cytokines: Bacteria promote Th17 cell
  differentiation via antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Variants in the IL-17 pathway
  genes also contribute to IL-17 upregulation. IL-17 can stimulate epithelial cells
  and fibroblasts to release neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1/5/8 which recruit neutrophils
  to the lungs. Furthermore, IL-17A enhances airway smooth muscle contraction, migration,
  and proliferation, which facilitates AHR and airway remodeling, Th1 cytokines: Infection
  and epithelial injury promote Th1 cell maturation and secrete Th1 cytokines, including
  TNF-α and IFN-γ. TNF-α synergizes with IL-17 cytokines to promote neutrophil recruitment.
  Furthermore, TNF-α enhances airway smooth muscle contraction. IFN-γ and TNF-α upregulate
  Ca2+signaling in airway smooth muscle and induces AHR. In addition, IFN-γ promotes
  neutrophil recruitment in the presence of IL-17 cytokines.'
