caption: Changes of FAs metabolism in hamster liver of HFD group (A) and HFD+ADT group
  (B). Compared with the HFD group, ADT administration significantly inhibited the
  overexpression of ACC1, FAS and SCD1, activated FADS1 and FADS2, thereby reducing
  endogenous synthesis of PA, SA and OA, and improved the desaturated metabolic pathway
  of EFAs. In addition, ADT upregulated the levels of FATPs, L-FABP, and CPT1α, thus
  increasing the uptake, binding/isolation, transport, and β-oxidation of FAs. More
  importantly, ADT obviously increased the expression of Mitofusin1 to promote mitochondrial
  fusion state and maximal β-oxidation. PA, palmitic acid; SA, stearic acid; OA, oleic
  acid; EFAs, essential fatty acids, including LA and ALA; MFN1, Mitofusin1.
