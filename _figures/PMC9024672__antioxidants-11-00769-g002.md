caption: Mechanism of Nrf2 regulation in the treatment of renal I/R. In physiological
  condition Nrf2 binds to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1) in the cytoplasm
  and is degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. During renal I/R the hyperactivation
  of Nrf2 by CDDO, H2S, water-soluble H2S donor (such as GYY4137) leads to nuclear
  traslocation of Nrf2 that binds to antioxidant response elements and activates transcription
  of the genes encoding proteins involved in antioxidants mechanisms and iron metabolism
  thereby preventing the ROS-mediated tubular damage and the ferroptotic cascade.
