caption: Both G protein-coupled receptor- and nitric oxide-mediated intracellular
  signaling pathways are involved in changes in the contraction or relaxation of bladder
  smooth muscle. Grey symbols () indicate signaling pathway differences between normal
  and DM rats. Phospholipase C generates the intracellular second messenger IP3 from
  the membrane lipid PIP2. IP3 then induces Ca2+ release and the released Ca2+ binds
  to calmodulin. Ca2+/calmodulin activates MLCK, which phosphorylates myosin light
  chain, thus leading to contraction. In bladder smooth muscles from DM rats, changes
  in G protein-coupled receptor-mediated phospholipase C signaling affects IP3-dependent
  Ca2+ release and changes in PDE5 affect contraction or relaxation. These factors
  are expected to result in a decrease in bladder contractility. DM, diabetes mellitus;
  EFS, electrical field stimulation; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate;
