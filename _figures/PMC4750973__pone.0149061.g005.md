caption: The EIF2 signaling pathway was identified as one of the top canonical pathways
  affected by CELF1 knockdown using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. This pathway
  is shown with a molecule activity predictor (MAP) overlay from differential gene
  expression analysis of the RNA-seq dataset. Green indicates reduced expression in
  si2-transfected versus mock-transfected cardiomyocytes, whereas red/pink would indicate
  increased expression. Blue indicates predicted inhibition, whereas orange indicates
  predicted activation. The degree of saturation indicates the level of observed change
  or predicted effect. The 40S and 60S ribosome subunits (highlighted in magenta)
  have been expanded to show individual members of the complexes.
