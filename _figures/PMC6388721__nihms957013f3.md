caption: Simplified illustration of TXNIP role in presumptive pathways involved in
  endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction and pro-atherogenic phenotypes
  may rise from pro-inflammatory or aberrant proliferating signals. EC dysfunctions
  are more likely in vascular curvatures with disturbed laminar blood flow with high
  risk for atherosclerotic plaques development. TXNIP expression elevates in response
  to high glucose, oxidative stress, and also in sites of DSS in vascular tree and
  might directly contribute to pro-inflammatory signals and atherogenic changes through
  different pathways. TXNIP basically is well known to instigate NLRP3/IL-1β signaling
  as a pivotal inflammatory signal. Such locally inflammatory triggers might be amplified
  by DSS-induced VCAM-1 overexpression and subsequent monocyte adhesion which are
  dependent on TXNIP activity. Actin stress fibers and the linked intracellular signals
  may also be affected by TXNIP. ECs’ stress fibers are essential components to determine
  EC phenotype which in turn would affect major apoptotic and inflammatory pathways.
  Laminar shear stress in straight blood vessels makes ECs and their stress fibers
  align in the longitudinal direction of the vessels in a quiescence state. Appropriate
  formation and alignment of stress fibers are associated with the least JNK signaling
  and apoptosis in ECs. KLF-2 a well characterized anti-inflammatory checkpoint in
  ECs may also contribute to stress fiber formation and alignment. DSS-associated
  TXNIP overexpression may release pro-inflammatory effectors from KLF-2 and aggravate
  the appropriately designed actin fibers which in turn may escalate the inflammation
  through JNK activation. This might be augmented by TXNIP-induced Src phosphorylation
  and inhibition which correlates with less actin stress fiber formation. TXNIP may
  play different roles in EC abnormal proliferation and angiogenesis which besides
  its key pro-inflammatory roles may provide other prominent pathway to form atherosclerotic
  plaques along the vessels. Basically, TXNIP activity may result in suppression of
  VEGF transcripts through association with TRX which contributes to elevated endothelial
  VEGF levels. On the other side, it has been well documented that TXNIP is required
  for VEGF-R2 activation by VEGF and the consequent angiogenesis and EC proliferation.
  Nevertheless, concluding proliferative effects for TXNIP is hard to conclude, given
  TXNIP is extensively addressed as a component of combating against cancerous proliferation
  by inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through different effectors like cycline-A.
