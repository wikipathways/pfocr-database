caption: 'Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. (a) In the absence of the HH ligand,
  PTCH1 represses signaling through SMO causing GLI to remain inactive in the cytoplasm.
  (b) During physiological activation of the pathway the HH ligand binds to PTCH1,
  ending SMO suppression and causing activation and nucleus translocation of GLI thus
  influencing target genes expression. (c) Pathological activation of the SHH pathway
  through loss or mutational inactivation of PTCH1, suspending SMO inhibition in Gorlin-Goltz
  and sporadic BCCs (twist, FOXM1, Wnt pathway molecules, and others are viable biomarkers
  in BCC proteomic studies). (d) SMO activating mutations, found in sporadic BCCs,
  showing similar effects on the SHH pathway. HH: sonic hedgehog ligand; PTCH: protein
  patched hedgehog receptor, SMO: smoothened receptor, GLI: GLI factor, and Wnt: wingless
  signaling pathway.'
