caption: 'Summary of events leading to the generation of cytosolic reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) (R1) and mitochondrial ROS (R2). Extramitochondrial cytosolic ROS
  generation occurs following increased glucose flux, activation of the polyol pathway,
  and AGE:RAGE (advanced glycation end products:receptor for advanced glycation end
  products) interaction, as well as via the NADPH oxidase system, such as NOX4. Mitochondrial
  matrix ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are generated via the well-characterized
  electron-transport chain, Complex I–IV redox carriers, localized in the inner mitochondrial
  membrane. During hyperglycemia, there is an increased donation of electrons (e)
  by powerful NADH- and FADH2-reducing agents of Complex I and Complex II, respectively,
  characterized by pumping of protons (H+) into the intermembrane space, which gives
  rise to an increased mitochondrial membrane potential. As a result, the electron
  transport at complex III is inhibited; the system backs up, and the half-life of
  the free-radical intermediates of coenzyme Q (CoQ) is prolonged, which leads to
  an increase in the reduction of O2 to superoxide (O2.−) and in the production of
  ROS. The generated ROS and RNS release cytochrome c, activate caspases, and induce
  apoptosis. They also modulate the activity of angiotensin II (Ang II), protein kinase
  C (PKC), and transforming growth factor β(TGF-β), which ultimately affect the synthesis
  of the extracellular membrane. Abbreviation: DAG, diacylglycerol.'
