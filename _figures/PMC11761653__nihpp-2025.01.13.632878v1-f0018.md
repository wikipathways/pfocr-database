caption: a) The predicted biosynthetic pathway for JBIR-39. JbiE contains PKS-specific
  domains and is likely responsible for the attachment of the fatty acid tail at the
  N-terminus. Although the predicted biosynthetic pathway does not explain the C-methylation
  of the terminal Serine or the extra Thioesterase domain, identifying this BGC showcases
  the potential of MASPR for genome mining. b) Paired mass spectrometry data for this
  molecule was obtained from Streptomyces violascens NRRL B-2700. c) Annotated mass
  fragments providing evidence that this molecule, or an isomer, is present in the
  biological sample
