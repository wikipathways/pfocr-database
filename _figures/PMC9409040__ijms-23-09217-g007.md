caption: Schematic representation of the different levels of controls exercised by
  E4F1 on mitochondrial metabolism and the ATM/ATR–CHK1 axis. E4F1 is an ubiquitously
  expressed transcription factor that binds a limited set of genes (around 100), including
  its own promoter, as reported in mouse [,] and here in human cells. On the one hand,
  E4F1 controls genes important for mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolic functions,
  including a set of genes involved in pyruvate oxidation [,], that we termed a “PDH
  regulon” and which include DLAT, DLD, MPC1 and slc25A1). On the other hand, E4F1
  directly binds and controls the expression of the CHEK1 gene, as observed in mouse
  cells [] and here in human TNBC cells. Here, we also found that E4F1 directly binds
  and regulates two other genes, TTI2 and PPP5C, encoding upstream post-translational
  regulators of the ATM/ATR-CHK1 signaling pathway. TTI2 is a component of the molecular
  co-chaperone TTT complex which specifically recognizes the newly synthesized ATM
  and ATR kinases, and is essential for their correct folding and stability [,]. PPP5C
  is a protein phosphatase that activates ATM, ATR and CHK1 kinase activities [,,].
  Other recent reports show that the E4F1 protein also directly interacts with the
  CHK1 Kinase to modulate CHK1 protein stability and activity [], and also cooperates
  with PARP-1 and BRG1 to trigger ATM/ATR signaling at DNA lesions []. Altogether,
  this suggests the existence of a hitherto unidentified “ATM/ATR-CHK1 regulon” controlled
  by E4F1.
