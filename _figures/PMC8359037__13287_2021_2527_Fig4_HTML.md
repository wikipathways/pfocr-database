caption: The Notch signalling pathway in HFSCs. a Without the activation of Notch,
  the NICD does not enter the nucleus, and CSL might connect with ubiquitous corepressors
  (Co-R) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) to repress target gene transcription. b
  In the Notch pathway, a fully functional Notch receptor binds to a ligand (Dll1-4
  or Jag1-2) presented by a neighbouring cell, resulting in a conformational change
  of the receptor that expose the recognition site for cleavage by ADAM and γ-secretase,
  leading to the release of the active Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Subsequently,
  NICD is translocated to the nucleus, leading to the formation of a complex, the
  DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1/RBPjκ/Su(H)/lag-1)/additional coactivators (Co-A)/mastermind
  (MAM), which induces the transcription of target genes. c Notch signalling plays
  a vital role in the activation, proliferation, deafferentation of HFSCs and metabolite
  generation. The T-shaped lines indicate inhibitory interactions involved in this
  pathway, and the solid arrows indicate activating interactions
