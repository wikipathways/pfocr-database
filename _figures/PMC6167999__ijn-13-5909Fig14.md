caption: Schematic representation of nanoparticulate TiO2-mediated inhibition of testosterone
  production via the ERK1/2–PKA–PKC signaling pathway. Taken together, data from the
  current study suggest that nano-TiO2 enters the cytoplasm and nuclei of LCs, causing
  structural damage and decreased cell activity and testosterone generation or secretion.
  Furthermore, suppression of testosterone production in LCs by nano-TiO2 may be associated
  with dysfunction of ERK1/2–PKA–PKC signaling pathways, with downregulation of StAR,
  P450scc, 3βHSD, SR-BI, PKA, PKC, and pERK/1/2 and upregulation of DAX1. The complex
  dynamic pathway of nano-TiO2-mediated inhibition of testosterone synthesis or secretion
  in LCs requires further investigation.
