caption: A schematic illustration of a hypothesis first presented elsewhere (Schurr,
  ), postulating lactate, not pyruvate, to be the end-product of aerobic glycolysis.
  This hypothesis is founded on thermodynamic and other considerations, including
  data from many studies spanning almost eight decades of research by scientists in
  laboratories all around the world. The illustration shows the glycolytic apparatus
  as an aggregate of the glycolytic enzymes, all in close proximity to each other,
  as required by such a pathway for a maximized efficient output, with the entry of
  glucose into this pathway on the upper left side and an exit of lactate from the
  pathway on the right side through the action of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase
  (cLDH). Lactate is shuttled via an intracellular shuttle to the mitochondrial membrane,
  where it is converted back into pyruvate via mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase
  (mLDH) and into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
