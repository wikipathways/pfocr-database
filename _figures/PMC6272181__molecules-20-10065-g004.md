caption: 'Putative biosynthetic pathways of the major secondary metabolites in FF.
  The shikimate pathway provides a route to tyrosine and phenylalanine (A); Tyrosine
  and phenylalanine are starting points in the biosynthesis of several major secondary
  metabolites in FF (B). Enzyme names are abbreviated as follows: CM, chorismate mutase;
  PDH, prephenate dehydratase; PAT, prephenate aminotransferase; AAT, aromatic aminotransferase;
  PTG, pretyrosine dehydrogenase; TyrDC, tyrosine decarboxylase; MAO, monoamine oxidase;
  UGTs, UDP-glycosyltransferases; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; TAL, tyrosine ammonia
  lyase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, pretycinnamate-4-hydroxylase; 4CL,
  4-coumarate: coenzyme A ligase; C3H, coumarate 3-hydroxylase; COMT, caffeic acid
  O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase.'
