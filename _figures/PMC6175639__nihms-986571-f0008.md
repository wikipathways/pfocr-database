caption: 'Schematic Illustrating Potential Pathways for Glucose Utilization and Energy
  Production by Tendon Cells. (A) Steady State Metabolism (Pyruvate Supply for Mitochondrial
  Oxidative Phosphorylation); (B) Hypoxia/HIF1A Induced switch to anaerobic glycolysis,
  with cytosolic production of lactate from pyruvate; (C) Stress-Induced Aerobic Glycolysis
  with cytosolic production of lactate from pyruvate. Injury related growth factors
  such as TGF-βs, EGF and PDGF signal via receptors and cross-talk involving PI3K/AKT
  and Smads. This results in activation of genes for glucose uptake (Slc2a1), glycolytic
  production of pyruvate (Pfkp, Aldoa, Pgk1, Pgam1, Eno1, Pkm), conversion of pyruvate
  to lactate (Ldha) and lactate removal from the cell (Slc16a3). At the same time,
  Pdk1 expression is activated, which blocks conversion of pyruvate to acetylCoA by
  Pdh, which thereby prevents usage of glucose for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
  (*) Indicates genes and metabolites assayed in the current study. Plus (+) and minus
  (–) signs denote activation or deactivation of pathway components, respectively.
