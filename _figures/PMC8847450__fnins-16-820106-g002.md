caption: Imbalance of the gut flora induces production of proinflammatory factors
  through immune pathway, which causes neuroinflammatory response and cause cognitive
  and emotional dysfunction. Gut microbes also produce short-chain fatty acids, which
  are signaling molecules acting on central nervous system to cause cognitive and
  emotional dysfunction in the brain.
