caption: Resveratrol could activate the PI3K/AKT pathway []. On the other hand, this
  mentioned pathway could increase the Nrf2 translocation, finally induce transcription
  of anti-oxidative enzymes involved in inhibiting apoptosis. Moreover, GSK-3β could
  inhibit the Nrf2-ARE, then the transcription of antioxidant enzymes is induced.
  Interestingly, resveratrol by inactivating JAK-STAT or the NF-kB pathways could
  decrease ROS production and cell death [, ]
