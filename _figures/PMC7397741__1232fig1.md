caption: Model for the regulation of Pah1 PA phosphatase (PAP) localization and stability
  by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and the role of PA phosphatase in lipid
  synthesis. PA phosphatase is phosphorylated (small white circles) by multiple protein
  kinases in the cytoplasm; the phosphorylated enzyme translocates to the nuclear/ER
  membrane through its dephosphorylation by the Nem1-Spo7 complex. Dephosphorylated
  PA phosphatase that is associated with the nuclear/ER membrane catalyzes the conversion
  of PA to DAG, which is converted to TAG for storage in lipid droplets (LDs). The
  PA phosphatase molecule catalyzing the dephosphorylation of PA is denoted with blue
  color. The DAG produced in the PA phosphatase reaction may be converted to the phospholipids
  PC and/or PE via the Kennedy pathway if cells are supplemented with choline and/or
  ethanolamine. DAG may be converted to PA by the CTP-dependent DAG kinase (DGK) reaction.
  The PA phosphatase substrate PA is used for the synthesis of the major ER membrane
  phospholipids (PC, PE, PI, PS) via CDP-DAG. The unphosphorylated/dephosphorylated
  forms of PA phosphatase or protein kinase C (PKC)-phosphorylated PA phosphatase
  are degraded by the 20S proteasome (indicated by the dashed line arrows). More comprehensive
  descriptions of the lipid synthetic pathways and the regulation of PA phosphatase
  may be found elsewhere (, , , ).
