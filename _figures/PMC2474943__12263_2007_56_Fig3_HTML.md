caption: Potential points of action of flavonoids within ERK pathway. ERK1/2 are activated
  by upstream MAPKK, such as MEK1/2, and MAPKKK, such as c-Raf. MEK1/2 induce ERK1/2
  activation via dual phosphorylation on threonine 202 and tyrosine 204 residues within
  the tripeptide motif TEY. Phosphorylation of ERK leads to the activation of a number
  of transcription factors, important in controlling differentiation, neuronal survival
  and various forms of cellular plasticity. For example, ERK activates pro-survival
  transcription factor CREB, by activating both p90RSK and MSK1/2. Other important
  targets include, ATF-1, Elk-1 and stat1/3, all of which are implicated in the regulation
  of various forms of cellular stress, including genotoxic agents, inflammatory cytokines
  and UV irradiation
