caption: Resveratrol attenuated ROS-induced cognitive impairments in rats with Ang-II-induced
  early AD. Ang-II not only increased the generation of superoxide and the activity
  of the Aβ–caspase 3–Akt–GSK-3β–Tau pathway by positively regulating NOX2 levels,
  but also attenuated SOD2 and BDNF expression in the hippocampus (black line). However,
  treatment with losartan or resveratrol improved cognitive impairments in rats with
  Ang-II-induced early AD by abolishing ROS generation and reducing activity of the
  Aβ–caspase 3–Akt–GSK-3β–Tau pathway by negatively regulating NOX2 levels (red line).
  ROS, reactive oxygen species.
