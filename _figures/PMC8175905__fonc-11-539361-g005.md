caption: Summary of proposed mechanisms linking inflammation and hypoxia in OSCC.
  There are several studies demonstrating the presence and function of the molecular
  components of these pathways in OSCC, yet mechanistic studies investigating how
  these pathways intersect during hypoxia and inflammation are more limited. The green
  arrows represent pathways that have been demonstrated in OSCC studies such as (,
  , , , ). The black arrows are pathways that have been demonstrated in non-OSCC studies,
  including (, , , , ). The signalling pathways associated with hypoxia-driven angiogenesis
  and the COX2/PGE2 axis of inflammation are numerous and our understanding is constantly
  evolving. However, based on the literature, important areas of overlap between inflammation
  and hypoxia include generation of ROS, activation of NFκB, signalling through the
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and activity of β-Catenin.
