caption: Metabolic implication of leaf mitochondria during water stress. The scheme
  figures the main metabolic fluxes occurring in a typical C3 leaf cell in optimal
  well-watered conditions, and under water stress. The thickness of the lines corresponds
  to the estimated importance of the fluxes. Diffusion is indicated with dotted lines,
  and metabolic shuttles with dashed blue lines. Restriction of carbon dioxide diffusion
  by closure of stomata and specific inhibition of plastid ATPase under water deficit
  are indicated by arrows in red circles. TN, Plastidial ATP/ADP antiporter; Mal//OAA,
  malate oxaloacetate shuttle; DHAP//PGA, dihydroxyacetone phosphate 3-phosphoglycerate
  shuttle; Glu//Pro, glutamate/proline shuttle; Gln//Glu, glutamine/glutamate shuttle;
  Orn//Citrn, ornithine/citrulline shuttle; PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; TP, triose phosphate;
  Pyr, pyruvate; Ac-CoA, acetyl-coenezyme A; BBC, Benson–Bassham–Calvin cycle; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle; RubP, ribulose 1,5 bis-phosphate; Rubisco, ribulose 1,5
  bis-phosphate carboxylase oxygenase; pdc, pyruvate decarboxylase complex; gdc, glycine
  decarboxylase complex; GS-GOGAT, glutamine synthetase–glutamate oxoglutarate aminotransferase;
  Cyt pathway, phosphorylating electron transfer pathway; Alt pathway, non-phosphorylating
  electron transfer pathway.
