caption: 'The importance of FXR in the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. BAs directly
  bind to and activate FXR in the liver and intestine, leading to the transcription
  of target genes. The genes that are induced or inhibited after FXR activation are
  displayed in light green markers and purple markers, respectively. BAs are synthesized
  in hepatocytes through classical and alternative pathways, bind to taurine or glycine
  through BACS and BAAT, and are secreted through the bile duct membrane through two
  ABC transporters (BSEP and MRP2). They are stored in the gallbladder and then excreted
  into the intestinal lumen, where they can emulsify dietary lipids. Approximately
  95% of BAs in the intestinal lumen are reabsorbed by ASBT on intestinal epithelial
  cells, and bind to FXR, increasing the expression of IBABP and two transporters,
  OSTα/OSTβ, which promote the return of BAs to the liver. BAs circulating in the
  liver are absorbed by the liver’s NTCP and OATP, which are inhibited by BAs. Two
  FXR-dependent pathways inhibit BA synthesis, thereby regulating BA homeostasis.
  Pathway 1: the intrahepatic high concentration of BAs activates the FXR/SHP pathway,
  thereby inhibiting the expression of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 in the liver, and reducing
  BA synthesis. Pathway 2: the high concentration of BAs in the intestine activates
  FXR to induce the secretion of FGF15/19 into the enterohepatic circulation, and
  interacts with FGFR4 and its co-receptor β-klotho on hepatocytes, activates the
  JNK and ERK1/2 pathways, down-regulates the expression of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, and
  limits BA synthesis. Created with BioRender.com. FXR, farnesoid X receptor; SHP,
