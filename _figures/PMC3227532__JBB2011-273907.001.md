caption: Extensive epidemiological studies in SLE patients demonstrate a bimodal distribution
  in mortality rates with the earlier peak attributed to infections and complications
  from kidney disease and/or neuropsychiatric lupus and a later peak mainly linked
  to atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) events []. A population-based case-control
  analysis, using general practice database data, found a relative CV disease risk
  of 2 for women with SLE [, ]. Strikingly, a fifty-fold increased risk of myocardial
  infarction was reported among premenopausal women with SLE []. While several traditional
  risk factors for atherosclerosis are more prevalent among SLE patients, they cannot
  fully explain their increased CV burden [].  Additionally, the effect on CV risk
  of SLE is more pronounced comparing to the impact of other inflammatory diseases
  like rheumatoid arthritis []. These observations support the hypothesis that accelerated
  atherosclerosis and premature CV disease are significantly enhanced by factors inherent
  to the pathogenesis of SLE. Among these, increasing evidence designates type I IFN
  as a major player in promoting both the pathogenesis of SLE and atherosclerosis
  ().
