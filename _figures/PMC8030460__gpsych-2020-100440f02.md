caption: 'Protein kinase C (PKC) signalling pathway during the immune–inflammatory
  pathogenesis of TRD. Resting microglia could be activated into two subtypes: pro-inflammatory
  M1 microglia and anti-inflammatory M2 microglia. Maintaining a balanced state for
  the M1/M2 microglia is important for maintaining normal immunity in the CNS. Abnormal
  communication between microglia and neurons might lead to neuronal apoptosis, cognitive
  dysfunction and TRD. CNS, central nervous system; TRD, treatment-resistant depression.'
