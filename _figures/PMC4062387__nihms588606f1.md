caption: Panel A shows pathway in wild type Pla2g1b+/+ mice, where Pla2g1b-catalyzed
  hydrolysis of dietary fat and phospholipids generates lysophospholipids (LysoPL)
  that inhibits fatty acid oxidation in the liver. The increased fatty acid availability
  in the liver promotes triglyceride (TG) synthesis, leading to elevated VLDL secretion
  into the plasma circulation. Fatty acids generated directly from lipase-catalyzed
  hydrolysis of chylomicron-TG as well as from VLDL hydrolysis are deposited in adipose
  tissues to promote adiposity as well as transported to skeletal muscle to promote
  insulin resistance (I.R.). The LDL generated from increased lipoprotein secretion
  can also be accumulating in the vessel wall to promote atherosclerosis. Panel B
  shows pathway in Pla2g1b−/− mice, where reduced LysoPL absorption due to Pla2g1b
  inactivation results in increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation (bold arrow) and
  reduced TG synthesis and VLDL secretion, ultimately leading to reduced fatty acid
  deposition in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and decreased LDL accumulation
  in the vessel wall.
