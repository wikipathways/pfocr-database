caption: Lineage relationships of cells originating in the otocyst. Cells within the
  otocyst have three broad fates, Prosensory Cell, Non-sensory cell, or Neuroblast.
  As discussed in the text, Sox2 actually plays a role in the specification of both
  the Prosensory and Neuroblast lineages. Prosensory cells then make a secondary choice
  between Hair Cell and Supporting Cell fates, with activation of Fgfr1 by Fgf20 positively
  influencing the hair cell fate, leading to activation of Atoh1. In contrast, Sox2
  acts as an inhibitor of the hair cell fate at this decision point, probably at least
  in some cells through activation of Prox1. For the particular case of pillar cells,
  developing inner hair cells express Fgf8 which activates Fgfr3 in adjacent progenitors,
  leading to an inhibition of the hair cell fate and an induction of the pillar cell
  fate in those cells. Finally, the hedgehog signaling pathway acts to prevent at
  least some Non-Sensory Cells from spontaneously switching into the Prosensory lineage.
