caption: 'Neuronal CB signaling. Activation of a CB receptor with an agonist causes
  several downstream effects: inhibition of adenylcyclase and inwardly rectifying
  calcium channels, and activation of potassium channels as well as the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathway. Activation of MAPK modulates gene expression, depending
  on downstream signaling, cell types, etc. Gene expression can also be modulate as
  a downstream effect of adenylyl cyclase inhibition through the activation of protein
  kinase A.Abbreviations: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases; AC, adenylyl cyclase;
  cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A.Note: Reprinted by permission
