caption: Pathways used by YadB and GluRS to attach glutamate to tRNA. YadB (upper
  pathway) first activates glutamate (Glu) in the absence of tRNA to yield glutamyl-adenylate
  (Glu-AMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi). Glu-AMP then serves as substrate for the attachment
  of glutamate to the Q-base at the first anticodon position of tRNAAsp. In contrast,
  GluRS (lower pathway) requires the presence of tRNAGlu for Glu-AMP synthesis and
  subsequently attaches glutamate to the 3′-terminal adenosine of tRNAGlu.
