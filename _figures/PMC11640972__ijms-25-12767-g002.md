caption: 'The tryptophan metabolic pathways. Tryptophan (Trp) is catabolized via the
  serotonin pathway (over 2% of L-Trp), the kynurenine (KYN) pathway (more than 90%
  of L-Trp), and the gut microbial indole pyruvate pathway (over 5% of L-Trp). (a)
  In the KYN pathway, L-Trp is converted into several key metabolites, including N-formyl-L-kynurenine,
  KYN, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, xanthurenic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid, quinolinic acid, picolinic acid, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).
  These conversions occur via the action of various enzymes: tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
  (TDO), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDOs), kynurenine formamidase (KFA), kynurenine
  3-monooxygenase (KMO), kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), kynureninase (KYNU),
  3-hydroxyanthranilate oxidase (3-HAO), quinolinate phosphoribosyl transferase (QPRT),
  nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT), NAD synthetase, amino-β-carboxy-muconate-semialdehyde-decarboxylase
  (ACMSD), and 2-aminomuconic-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (AMSD). KYNA is also further
  metabolized by the gut microbiome, resulting in quinaldic acid and 8-hydroxyquinaldic
  acid, which may be dehydroxylated from xanthurenic acid [5,8,62]. Notably, the gut
  microbiota contributes to the KYN pathway [70]. (b) In the gut microbial indole
  pyruvate pathway, L-Trp metabolism occurs via four distinct pathways: the indoxyl
  sulfate pathway, the indole-3-acetamide (IAM) pathway, the tryptamine pathway, and
  the indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) pathway. In the indoxyl sulfate (INS) pathway,
  the rate-limiting enzyme is tryptophanase (TNA), which requires pyridoxal phosphate.
  It converts Trp to indole, which passes through the gut lining before being hydroxylated
  into 3-hydroxyindole (indoxyl), which is then converted to INS in the liver by p450
  cytochrome and sulfonation [71]. The IAM pathway starts with tryptophan-2-monooxygenase
  (TMO), which converts Trp to IAM, which is then converted to indole-3-acetic acid
  (IAA) by indole-3-acetamide hydrolase (IaaH). IAA can then be metabolized into indole-3-aldehyde
  or decarboxylated into 3-methylindole (skatole) [72,73]. In the tryptamine pathway,
  tryptophan decarboxylase (TrD) converts Trp to tryptamine via amino acid decarboxylase
  (AAD), which is then converted into indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld). IAAld can be
  converted into IAA or reversibly into indole-3-ethanol (tryptophol) [74,75]. Finally,
  in the IPA pathway, aromatic amino acid aminotransferase (ArAT) converts Trp to
  indole-3-pyruvic acid, which yields indole-3-lactic acid by phenyllactate dehydrogenase
  (fldH), 3-indole acrylic acid by phenyllactate dehydratase (fldBC), and, eventually,
  indole 3-propionic acid by acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (acdA) [75,76,77]. Black
