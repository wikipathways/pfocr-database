caption: Schematic illustration of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Arrows represent
  activation, whereas bars represent inhibition []. Upon receptor activation, insulin
  receptor substrate (IRS) activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is
  in turn phosphorylated to generate phosphatidylinositol [3,4,5]-trisphosphate (PIP3).
  Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) can dephosphorylate PIP3 to regulate the pathway
  activity. AKT is activated through the binding of PIP3 to its amino terminal, pleckstrin
  homology (PH) domain (stripped), which then promotes the translocation of AKT to
  the plasma membrane, where the carboxyl terminal T308 is phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase-1 (PDK1), and S473 is phosphorylated by mTORC2. AKT regulates several cellular
  processes such as survival and cell proliferation, through a variety of downstream
  proteins like glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β), Forkhead Box O (FOXO), amid
  others (not shown). AKT is able to directly phosphorylate and thus inactivates the
  40 kDa proline-rich protein (PRAS40), relieving the suppressive regulation on mTORC1
  activity. Furthermore, AKT can phosphorylate and inactivate the tuberous sclerosis
  (TSC) tumor suppressor protein complex that acts as a GTPase-activating protein
  (GAP) for the RAS homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) small G protein to regulate its
  activity. Retention of the Rheb-GTP bound form activates mTOR, which is comprised
  of two main complexes that are associated with diverse proteins such as Raptor,
  mLST8, PRAS40 and Deptor for complex I (mTORC1), and Rictor, mLST8, Deptor, mSin1
  and Protor for complex II (mTORC2). mTORC1 is regulated by a variety of environmental
  signals mediated via several proteins including REDD1/2 (regulated in development
  and DNA damage responses 1/2), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), among others.
  mTORC1 phosphorylates downstream S6K1 (p70S6 Kinase 1) and modulates the eukaryotic
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), which discharges it from hindering
  eIF4E, and enabling 40S ribosomal subunit to be recruited to mRNAs, leading to the
  initiation of protein translation. S6K also phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6
  that is also involved in translational regulation by the 40S ribosomal subunit.
  By contrast, the regulation of mTORC2 is still under investigation, but it is known
  to be regulated by growth factors. mTORC2 phosphorylates distinct groups of proteins,
  enabling the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and migration via activating protein
  kinase C α (PKC-α), small GTPases (Rhoa, Rac1 and Cdc42), and focal adhesion proteins,
  such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin. Essentially, the activation of
  the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-RSK pathway mediated by growth factor is another mechanism of
  regulated crosstalk with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
