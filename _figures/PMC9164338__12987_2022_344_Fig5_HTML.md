caption: 'Schematic overview of some of the most significantly canonical pathways
  predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen) to be affected by shear stress
  in hCMEC/D3 cells. a NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and (b) Oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway. Analysis gives the common responses to shear stress exposure at both 5
  and 10 dyn.cm−2 compared to the static condition. Relative changes in protein levels
  are depicted by graduated shades of color coding: red (up), green (down), white
  (no change or not applicable). Predictions are shown in orange (activation predicted)
  and blue (inhibition predicted). Proteins in surrounded of purple are modified only
  at 10 dyn.cm−2 vs static; and those surrounded of pink are modified only at 5 dyn.cm−2
  vs static'
