caption: Proposed mechanism of IL-13 inhibition of LPS-induced BPIFA1 expression in
  nasal polyps and adenoid tissue. The IL-13 inhibits BPIFA1 (SPLUNC1) gene expression
  through a JNK/c-Jun regulation pathway. Lactoferrin also interacts with BPIFA1 in
  the nasal polyps and adenoid tissues to avoid LPS-induced inflammation via downregulated
  MEK1/2-MAPK signaling.
