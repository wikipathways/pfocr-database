caption: (A) For normal vascular remodeling to proceed, RA is required for maintenance
  of the yolk sac endoderm, the site of production of multiple growth factors such
  as VEGF-A, IHH and bFGF. These factors act on the underlying mesoderm to promote
  endothelial cell migration via association of FAK with paxillin, FAK phosphorylation
  (Tyr397), and activation of Rac1 and its downsteam effector WAVE2. In the absence
  of RA signaling (B), decreased production of VEGF-A, IHH, and bFGF results due to
  loss of endoderm integrity. As a consequence, the association of FAK and paxillin
  is disrupted, activation of FAK and Rac1 is diminished, there is loss of WAVE2 expression,
  and increased activation of RhoA. The altered activation states of these signaling
  proteins result in increased vinculin-containing focal adhesion sites throughout
  the yolk sac mesoderm and ultimately lead to a defect in endothelial cell migration
  and lack of vascular remodeling.
