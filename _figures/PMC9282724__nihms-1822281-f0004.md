caption: The neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal
  dementia (FTD), Parkinson disease (PD) and late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) occur
  predominantly without known genetic causes. Even within the small proportion of
  cases for which monogenic aetiologies or risk loci have been identified, convergent
  pathophysiology remains elusive. To begin to understand the role of autophagy in
  these mechanisms of disease, disease-causative, disease-associated and disease-susceptibility
  genes for familial or known genetic forms of ALS/FTD, PD and LOAD are mapped onto
  their putative sites of function in the autophagy pathway. a | Schematic of autophagosome
  biogenesis and cargo capture, autophagosome maturation, and fusion of structures

  sarcoma (FUS)), TARDBP (encoding TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43)) and SOD1 (encoding
  superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)) can cause disease, and their protein products as
  well as UBQLN2 have been identified as autophagic cargo and can accumulate in tissue
  from idiopathic cases and cases with other genetic aetiologies. Other genetic aetiologies
  include hexanucleotide repeat expansion at the C9ORF72 locus, whose protein product
  forms a complex that is implicated in autophagosome biogenesis. Optineurin (OPTN)
  and p62 are known autophagy adaptors, which are phosphorylated by TANK-binding kinase
  1 (TBK1), an event essential for targeting these adaptors and their associated cargoes
  for autophagic degradation. VCP, progranulin (GRN) and FIG4 are implicated in membrane
  trafficking and lysosome function. c | In PD, mutations in PINK1 and PRKN (encoding
  parkin) can cause autosomal recessive, early-onset PD, with cell biological studies
  connecting them to mitophagy. SNCA encodes α-synuclein (SNCA), a cargo for autophagy
  and a pathological component of Lewy bodies in brain tissue from patients with idiopathic
  PD and other synucleinopathies. SNCA and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have
  been broadly associated with different steps of autophagy. Other known causes of

  by autophagy and can be mutated in disease, and beige ovals represent all other
