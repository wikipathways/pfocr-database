caption: Heterogeneous contributing factors in MPM disease progression. (A) The MPM
  genomic landscape is dominated by frequent gene inactivation in CDKN2A, NF2 and
  BAP1. (B) Several stem cellular signaling pathways, such as Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt/β-catenin,
  Hippo/YAP and Notch have been implicated in MPM pathobiology. (1) Hh ligands (DH,
  IH, and HH) bind patched (PTCH1) to relive inhibition of Smoothened (SMO) and this
  activates the Hh signaling pathway, via transcriptional activation of glioma-associated
  protein (Gli) factors; in the inactive state, Gli3 gets degraded when suppressor
  of fused homolog (Sufu) is inhibited. (2) Protein-serine O-palmitoleoyltransferase
  porcupine (PORCN) is required for efficient binding of Wnt ligands to cell-surface
  Frizzled (Fzd) receptors and to LRP5/6 which signals to the Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins.
  This causes an accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, followed by nuclear translocation
  and activation of transcription factors. (3) Hippo signaling consists of a cascade
  of kinases, which ultimately phosphorylate and activate serine/threonine-protein
  kinase (LATS)1/2 to inhibit two major downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway—YAP
  and Tafazzin (TAZ)—to stymie signaling (protein degradation). However, in NF2-mutant
  tumors, NAE activates CRL4DCAF1 and thus sustains tumor growth. (4) The Notch pathway
  can be activated by CK2α and when the Notch transmembrane receptors bind to a Notch
  ligand, a cascade of events promote gene transcription via γ secretase. Therapeutics
  (red) to target these pathway components have been developed for Smoothened (Vismodegib),
  Gli (GLI-I, GANT61), PORCN (LGK-974), NAE (MLN-4924) and CK2α (CX-4945 and CIGB-300).
  Arrows indicate interaction or activating effect and T-bars indicate inhibition.
  Green arrows indicate cross-talk between pathways.
