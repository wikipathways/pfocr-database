caption: The repair products are boxed. The box color (from green to red) indicates
  the threat to genomic stability posed by the product of each pathway and sub-pathway.
  DNA synthesis is indicated by an arrow and newly-synthesized DNA by a dotted line.
  The long ssDNA associated with BIR has the potential to undergo MIR. More detailed
  mechanisms for D-loop cleavage and MIR are provided in  and , respectively. The
  reversibility of DSB resection provided by the Shieldin complex with fill-in by
  the DNA polymerase α-primase complex provides an unanticipated degree of flexibility
  in the choice of DSB repair between HR and EJ mechanisms []. Hence, EJ pathways
  are available not only on unresected or minimally resected DSB, they can also be
  engaged after extensive resection and subsequent fill-in.
