caption: Sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway and SM inhibitors. Schematic depicting
  SM depletion by different treatments. Myriocin blocks SPT1 that catalyzes the first
  and rate-limiting step in SM biosynthesis. Fumonisin B1 inhibits dihydroceramide
  synthase (DCS). SMase catalyzes hydrolytic cleavage of SM, generating ceramide and
  phosphocholine. Depletion of SM is common to all three treatments, whereas ceramide
  is decreased by the first two, and increased by the third treatment.
