caption: Therapeutic potential of pro-apoptotic calcium signaling at the ER and mitochondria.
  (A) Mechanism of BCR activated Ca2+ influx in response to rituximab and obinutuzumab.
  The membrane-spanning 4-domain protein CD20 is physically-coupled to the BCR. Rituximab
  and obinutuzumab induce phosphorylation of several proteins involved in BCR signaling,
  including BLNK (B-cell linker kinase), BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase), and PLC-γ
  (phospholipase C-γ). CD20 binds STIM1 and this binding is dependent on the presence
  of Orai1. Upon binding of rituximab/obinutuzumab, Ca2+ is released from lysosomes,
  the ER, and/or extracellularly via activation of store-operated calcium entry, which
  assists cell killing. (B) Schematic showing the four Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains.
  Venetoclax binds to the hydrophobic cleft located in the BH3 domain, and BIRD-2
  binds to the BH4 domain. Transmembrane domain (TM), N- and C- termini are indicated.
  (C) Canonical BAX and BAK dependent pathway of apoptosis and the mechanism through
  which venetoclax inhibits this pathway. (D) Non-canonical ER Ca2+-dependent pathway
  of apoptosis and the mechanism through which BIRD-2 inhibits this pathway.
