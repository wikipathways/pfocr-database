caption: Vemurafenib treatment relieves a negative feedback on ERBB3 transcription
  resulting in an increase of ERBB3 at the membrane. In the presence of its ligand,
  NRG1, ERBB3 heterodimerizes with ERBB2 to become active. Active ERBB3 recruits PI3K,
  which signals to the AKT pathway promoting survival of mutant BRAF melanoma cells
  treated with vemurafenib. Treatment with the anti-ERBB3 monoclonal antibody huHER3-8
  outcompetes NRG1 and prevents the activation of ERBB3 and AKT signaling and enhances
  the efficacy of vemurafenib treatment.
