caption: The role of HLA-G in controlling rejection in organ transplantation. The
  complex process involves both innate and adaptive immunity. HLA-G interaction on
  macrophages, monocytes, and NK cells can trigger the production of cytokines leading
  the inflammation contributes to rejection. Another interaction work on adaptive
  immunity involved direct and indirect pathways. The direct pathway is HLA-G directly
  inhibiting immune effectors such as T cells, B cells, and Natural Killer (NK) cells.
  The indirect pathway involves HLA-G acting on dendritic cells (DC) and CD8+/CD4+
  T cells. Subsequently acting on T regulatory cell (T reg) formation, then continue
  acting on the direct pathway with inhibiting the functional cells.
