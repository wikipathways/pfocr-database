caption: 'HDACs coordinate the cellular response to oxidative stress. HDACs coordinate
  the cellular response to oxidative stress. As a defense mechanism against oxidative
  stressors, Nrf2 acts as a redox-sensitive transcription factor. Under homeostatic
  conditions, Keap1 sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm, resulting in its degradation
  by proteasome. When the cells are subjected to oxidative stress, Nrf2 is activated
  through its dissociation from the Keap1 complex. Then, the Nrf2 protein is transported
  to the nucleus, where it is acetylated and dimerized with the MAF protein at the
  antioxidant reactive element (ARE) site in the promoters of antioxidant genes. Through
  this process, antioxidant genes are activated to scavenge excess reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and maintain mitochondrial function. In response to oxidative stress,
  HDACs act as a negative regulator of the Nrf2 pathway. (A) SIRT1 inhibits Nrf2 acetylation,
  which reduces its binding to ARE and thereby obstructs Nrf2-mediated gene expression.
  (B) HDAC3 is recruited to the ARE site and induces a histone hypoacetylation state,
  hence repressing ARE-dependent gene expression. (C) HDAC1 forms a complex with Bach1,
  which competes with Nrf2 for the binding to transcription cofactor MAF in oxidative-stress-response
  genes. Bach1 acts as a functional inhibitor of Nrf2 by forming a complex with nuclear
  co-repressor NCoR. Abbreviations: Nrf2, NF-E2–related factor 2; Keap1, Kelch-like
