caption: 'Pathway analysis of altered metabolites upon paroxetine treatment. Common
  targets and regulators of significant metabolites were identified by a conservative
  hypergeometric test expression analysis systematic explorer (EASE), score<0.05.
  Metabolites and targets/regulators were clustered into energy metabolism, amino
  acid metabolism and hormone signaling pathways. Green: metabolites, red: proteins,
  yellow: cellular processes, orange: functional classes.'
