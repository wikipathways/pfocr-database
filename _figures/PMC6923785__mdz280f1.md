caption: 'Mechanisms of resistance to PI3K inhibitors in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive
  breast cancer and current and future drug combination strategies involving PI3K
  inhibitors. In PIK3CA-mutated breast tumours, resistance to PI3K inhibitors can
  be mediated by multiple mechanisms, including activation of alternative pathways
  that drive cell proliferation (e.g. RAS/MEK/ERK pathway, ER pathway, or HER2 pathway);
  by signalling via other PI3K isoforms when a specific subunit is blocked; by activation
  of downstream effectors in the PI3K pathway such as AKT and mTOR; by loss of regulators
  of PI3K signalling such as PTEN; or by epigenomic crosstalk between PI3K and ER
  pathways, resulting in upregulation of ER-dependent transcription. Ab, monoclonal
  antibody; AR, androgen receptor; CDK4/6i, CDK4/6 inhibitors; ER, estrogen receptor;
  HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; HER3, human epidermal growth factor
  receptor 3; IGFR1, insulin growth factor receptor 1; mTOR, mTOR inhibitors; PI3Ki,
  PI3K inhibitors; SERD, selective estrogen receptor degraders; T-DM1, ado-trastuzumab
  emtansine; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Dashed arrows, inhibitory function; bold
  arrows, activation function. Note: within each drug class, we have only included
  compounds that have been or that are currently being tested in combination with
  PI3K inhibitors in clinical trials (see Tables  and  for more details).'
