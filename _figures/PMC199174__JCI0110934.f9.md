caption: Models for the function of Ser307 phosphorylation. Upon insulin stimulation,
  IRS-1 is tyrosyl-phosphorylated by the IR, resulting in the activation of PI 3-kinase
  that mediates Ser307 phosphorylation. Ser307 phosphorylation subsequently inhibits
  the ability of IRS-1 to be further tyrosyl phosphorylated by the IR and to propagate
  insulin signaling. An increase in Ser307 phosphorylation, such as that possibly
  trigged by TNF-α in chronic obesity, also induces insulin resistance. As β cells
  compensate for insulin insensitivity with compensatory hyperinsulinemia, chronic
  insulin stimulation induces more Ser307 phosphorylation through the PI 3-kinase
  pathway, thus further increasing the pool of inactive, Ser307 phosphorylated IRS-1.
  This vicious cycle might continue until hyperinsulinemia fails to compensate for
  insulin resistance.
