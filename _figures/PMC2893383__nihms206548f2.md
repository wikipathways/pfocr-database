caption: Schematic of leptin signaling through STAT3 and PDE3B pathways in POMC and
  NT neurons in the hypothalamus. Leptin binding to it’s receptor (Ob-Rb) leads to
  activation of JAK2, receptor dimerization, JAK2-mediated Ob-Rb phosphorylation followed
  by phosphorylation and activation of STAT3. Activated STAT3 dimerizes, translocates
  to the nucleus, and trans-activate target genes including POMC and NT. Additionally,
  leptin activates PI3K and PDE3B, and decreases cAMP levels in the hypothalamus.
  Since PDE3 inhibition by cilostamide reverses the effect of leptin on STAT3 activation
  [Ref. ] as well as leptin-induced POMC and NT gene expression (current study), it
  is possible that decrease in cAMP levels is necessary for STAT3 activation and subsequent
  stimulation of POMC and NT gene expression by leptin. Also, PDE3B-activation dependent
  decrease in cAMP levels may directly result in increased POMC and NT gene expression
  by leptin - a hypothesis need to be experimentally tested. IRS, insulin receptor
  substrate.
