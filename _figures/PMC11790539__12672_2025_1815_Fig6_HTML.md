caption: The cuprotosis signaling pathway. Elesclomol inhibits thyroid carcinogenesis
  by downregulating ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) and strengthening the effect of cuprotosis
  in thyroid cancer cells. Cuproptosis-related gene (CRG) models (involving FDX1,
  BUB1, and RPL3) may regulate cuproptosis through the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated
  (ATM) signaling pathway in thyroid cancer cells
