caption: Our working model. In traditional lymphoid organs, when exposed to antigens,
  naïve lymphocytes and other immune cells undergo development, maturation, activation,
  and differentiation/polarization. During an infection, antigen-presenting cells,
  including dendritic cells and macrophages, ingest pathogens (antigens) and present
  them to T cells via membrane–protein interaction and intercellular communication.
  In addition to presenting antigens, they provide costimulatory signals and secretome
  cytokine signaling (autocrine and paracrine functions), resulting in increased cytokine/chemokine
  and secretome secretion and an increased inflammatory immune response. In contrast,
  in CKD, uremic toxins, including cytokines and other secretomes, activate immune
  cells in the wall of veins. Once these cells become activated, they communicate
  through membrane–protein interactions to transfer signals between each other and
  amplify inflammatory signaling through the activation of the MYCN/AP-1 signaling
  pathway. In addition, these activated immune cells enter the blood circulation and
  move to other organs (long-distance endocrine) leading to increased cytokine/chemokine
  and secretome secretion, increasing inflammatory immune response, and potentially
  inducing cell proliferation
