caption: 'Schematic network that integrates the experimentally confirmed signaling
  pathways and functions of telocytes (TCs) involved in disease occurrence and treatment.
  ➀ In rat model of renal fibrosis, TCs transplantation can indirectly increase the
  expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in vivo, further inhibit TGF-β1/Smad
  signaling pathway, prevent subsequent epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT) process
  and alleviate renal fibrosis. ➁ In acute lung injury, TCs can reduce pulmonary inflammation
  and edema and facilitate proliferation and differentiation of airway epithelium
  by miRNA/ PI3K(p110α)/AKT/mTOR signal pathway. ➂ In calcific aortic valve disease
  (CAVD), TCs extracellular vesicles injection can reduce valve calcification and
  inhibit valve interstitial cells apoptosis via transferring miRNA-30b, and then
  inhibit wnt/β-catenin/Runx2 axis. ➃ In gastrointestinal tract, TCs provide non-epithelial
  Wnts and R-Spondins 3 for SCs to support proliferation and differentiation by working
  Wnt /β- catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, Porcupine (Porcn), Wntless and R-Spondins
  3 (RSPO3) in Foxl1- and Gli1-expressing TCs are critical for Wnts secretion and
  related signaling activation, which nurse SCs function and keep integrity of normal
  epithelium,,. ➄ TCs provide Wnts and enhance in vitro decidualization and mesenchymal-epithelial
  transition (MET) of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) by acting on Wnt /β- catenin
  signaling pathway. ➅ TCs enhance the proliferation, adhesion and motility of ESCs
  in vitro by mediated ERK signaling pathway. ➆ TCs enhances classical activated macrophages
  (M1) differentiation and phagocytosis of pelvic macrophages and inhibits mitochondria-mediated
  apoptosis by activation NF-κB. ➇ In myocardial infarction (MI), TCs exosomal miRNA-21-5p
  targeted and silenced the Cdip1 gene and thus down-regulated the activated caspase-3
  to inhibit the apoptosis of microvascular endothelial cells, which facilitated angiogenesis
  and regeneration and improved myocardial function. ➈ In acute respiratory distress
  syndrome (ARDS), TCs promote proliferation and angiogenesis of vascular endothelial
  cells by transporting various miRNA and acting on PI3K(p110α)/AKT/mTOR signal pathway
  in TCs. ➉ In mice model of inflamed lungs, TCs reduce oxidative stress and tissue
  damage via increased miRNA-146a-5p, then downregulate CREB1/DUOX2 pathway in TCs.
