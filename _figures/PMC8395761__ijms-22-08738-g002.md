caption: 'Oncogenic functions of BCAT1 are highly dependent on mutational and cellular
  context. (A) In AML, LICs showing high expression of BCAT1 but low levels of EZH2
  (IDH1/2wt, TET2wt, EZH2wt genotype), BCAT1 catalyzes BCAA deamination with depletion
  of α-KG. This leads to a reduced activity of α-KG-dependent histone and DNA demethylases
  and α-KG-dependent dioxygenases with DNA hypermethylation and stabilization of HIF-1α;
  (B) In the transition from myeloproliferative diseases (MPN; PV, ETP, PF) to acute
  leukemia, EZH2 loss reactivates BCAT1 expression, while oncogenic RAS (NrasG12D)
  increases glutamine (Gln) uptake and consumption. This leads to enhanced BCAT1-catalyzed
  BCKA reamination to BCAAs and subsequent mTORC1 activation. The activity of α-KG-dependent
  enzymes is also enhanced as well as Glu-dependent processes such as nucleotide synthesis,
  redox balance, and protein synthesis. All these events contribute to myeloid transformation.
  Solid arrows indicate the activity of the pathway, dashed lines indicate inhibited
  or weak activities. GLS: glutaminase; Gln: glutamine; Glu: glutamate; BCAAs: branched
  chain amino acids; BCKA: branched chain α-keto acids; α-KG: apha-ketoglutarate;
  TET2: Ten-eleven translocation 2 demethylase; mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin;
  NEAA: non-essential amino acids; LICs: leukemia-initiating cells; PV: polycythemia
  vera; ETP: essential thrombocytopenia; PF: primary myelofibrosis.'
