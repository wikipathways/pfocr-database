caption: Simple diagram of spiking pathway of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)
  in the retinal degeneration (RD) to the mesopic light stimulation. The simple diagram
  of ON and OFF pathways in the degenerated retina. The stimulated cone photoreceptors
  affect both ON cone bipolar cells (ON CBCs) and OFF cone bipolar cells (OFF CBCs)
  via the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) and the ionotropic glutamate receptor
  (iGluR)-mediated chemical synapse, respectively. The ON and OFF CBCs directly connect
  with ON and OFF RGCs, respectively, generating their spikes with glutamatergic input.
  On the other hand, the stimulated rod photoreceptors affect only rod bipolar cells
  (RBCs) via the mGluR. The RBCs indirectly connect with ON and OFF RGCs through AII
  ACs. The AII ACs synapse with ON and OFF RGCs via the gap junction channel-mediated
  electrical synapse and GABAergic synapse, respectively. In the case of RD, the rod
  pathway cannot show electro-pharmacological alteration even if the OFF light stimulation
  activates the OFF pathway.
