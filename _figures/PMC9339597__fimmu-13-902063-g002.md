caption: Potential mechanisms and targets of complement activation in diabetic kidney
  disease. In diabetes, increased glycation of proteins leads to the activation of
  lectin pathway through MBL and the dysfunction of complement regulatory proteins.
  Hyperglycemia induces the inactivation of CD59, which is the key inhibitor of MAC
  formation, thus predisposing to MAC deposition. Anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are also
  proved to participate in the pathogenesis of DKD. Potential complement-targeted
  therapeutics for DKD in red boxes include C1-INH, OSM721, C3aR inhibitors, C5aR
  inhibitors, and CD59 agonists.
