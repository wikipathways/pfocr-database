caption: 'Model for GST-14 in mitochondrial dysfunction. The pathway induced in gas-1
  is colored purple, the pathway hypothesized to be triggered in gas-1;gst-14(RNAi)
  is colored turquoise, and these involve the ROS cascade, colored red. In grey are
  drawings of the cell perimeter, the nucleus, and the mitochondrion, to put the events
  depicted into the cellular context. A more detailed model can be found in . Abbreviations:
