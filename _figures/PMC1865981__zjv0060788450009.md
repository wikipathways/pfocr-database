caption: Model for Nef-induced signaling in monocytes/macrophages. Exogenous added
  myr+ Nef activates the IKK/NF-κB pathway, the MAPKs, and IRF-3. The activation of
  the NF-κB and MAPK pathways might increase the expression of the proviral genome
  in infected cells and also take part in the regulation of cellular-gene expression
  that results in the synthesis and release of inflammatory factors, such as IL-1,
  IL-6, TNF-α, CCL2/MIP1α, and CCL4/MIP1β, and in the production of IFN-β. Upon binding
  to their specific receptors on the same or neighboring cells, those factors lead
  to the activation of STAT1, -2, and -3, further regulating cellular functions.
