caption: Metabolism of glucoraphanin and glucobrassicin to biologically active metabolites.
  a Sulforaphane is released from glucoraphanin by the plant enzyme myrosinase. Red
  dashed arrow marks the reactive carbon atom subject to glutathione conjugation.
  b Sulforaphane is metabolized via the mercapturic acid pathway into active metabolites.
  Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) first conjugates a GSH molecule (Glu-Cys-Gly) to
  the reactive carbon on sulforaphane. Glutamate is then removed by γ-glutamyltranspeptidase
  (GTP), followed by removal of the glycine residue by cysteinylglycinase (CGase).
  Cysteine is then acetylated by an acetyltransferase (AT) to sulforaphane-N-acetylcysteine,
  which is excreted in the urine. c Indole-3-carbinol is released from the glucosinolate
  glucobrassicin by myrosinase and undergoes spontaneous condensation in the acidic
  environment of the gut. Diindolylmethane (DIM) is the most abundant post-absorption
  acid condensation product. Acid condensation products can be modified further post-absorption.
