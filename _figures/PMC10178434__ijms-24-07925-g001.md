caption: The main mechanisms for the implementation of the Warburg effect. The tumor
  process disrupts enzymatic systems of oxidative phosphorylation, impairs pyruvate
  transport into mitochondria, and causes multiple defects in the Krebs cycle. As
  a result, anaerobic glycolysis becomes the dominant pathway, leading to active synthesis
  of lactic acid and the development of acidosis in tumor tissue. This disrupts the
  function of lymphocytes. Increased glucose metabolism also leads to constant activity
  of LDH, which induces the regeneration of NAD+ and affects the concentration of
  reducing equivalents in mitochondria. The antiapoptotic protein GAPDH, which is
  necessary for the function of NAD+, promotes further tumor growth. The excess carbon
  and reduced equivalents resulting from enhanced glucose metabolism are used for
  the synthesis of nucleotides, lipids, and proteins. Research has shown that sirtuins
  can suppress the expression of HIF-1α, thus inhibiting glycolysis by blocking the
  expression of glycolytic enzymes. SIRT6 also suppresses cMYC and its targets, such
  as GLS1, to inhibit glutamine catabolism, which stimulates enhanced glucose uptake
  by tumor tissue. DNA damage in the nucleus induces the expression of SIRT4, which
  inhibits the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase, thereby regulating glutamine synthesis.

  lactate dehydrogenase; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
