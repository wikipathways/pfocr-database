caption: Role of the CD40–CD40L pathway during the CD8 primary response. Multiple
  models have proposed to explain the role of the CD40–CD40L pathway in mediating
  CD4 help to CD8 T cells. (A) The first model suggests that CD40L-bearing CD4 T cells
  fully activate or license APC by engaging CD40 on APC. Such licensed or highly activated
  DC can then prime CD8 T cells. (B) The second model suggests that CD8 T cells either
  simultaneously or sequentially interact with antigen-presenting cells and CD40L-expressing
  CD4 T cells, which permits full activation of CD8 T cells. (C) However, in acute
  infectious disease models, CD4 T-cell help is dispensable for the CD8 primary response
  and CD8-intrinsic CD40 signaling plays a minimal role in mediating CD8-response
  development. For certain infections, even CD8-extrinsic CD40 signaling is not required
  for optimal CD8 response. This may be due to pathogen-mediated activation of TLRs
  on APCs and consequent inflammatory milieu, which may overcome the need for CD4
  help or CD40 signaling.
