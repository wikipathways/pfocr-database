caption: 'Pathophysiological mechanisms of thrombus formation and sites of action
  of therapeutic interventions, starting from the top center and moving roughly counterclockwise.
  The B cells mature to plasma cells that produce aPL. aPL bind their relevant phospholipid/protein
  complexes. The anti-β2GPI-β2GPI complex activates platelets, increasing the secretion
  of granules and the synthesis of thromboxane A2, and induces the release of neutrophil
  extracellular traps. aPL immune complexes activate complement, producing C5a, a
  potent chemoattractant and activator of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils.
  Endothelial cells are activated, increasing the production of TF, adhesion particles,
  and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex
  pathway induces endothelial hyperplasia. Endothelial NO synthase activity is impaired,
  reducing NO levels, inhibiting vascular relaxation and flow. Activated monocytes
  express TF on the cell surface. Complement activation releases anaphylatoxin and
  leads to membrane attack complex deposition on the cell surface. The anti-β2GPI-β2GPI
  complexes promote interferon type I and other proinflammatory cytokines by plasmacytoid
  dendritic cells via TLR7 and TLR9. Numbers indicate sites of action of the following
  therapeutic interventions: (1) rituximab; (2) hydroxychloroquine; (3) vitamin K
  antagonists—reduce biological activity of factors VII, IX, and X and thrombin; (4)
  direct oral anticoagulants and low-molecular-weight heparin; (5) eculizumab; (6)
  sirolimus, aPL antiphospholipid antibodies, apoER2 apolipoprotein E receptor 2,
  eNOS endothelial NO synthase, GPIb/V glycoprotein Ib/V, GPVI glycoprotein VI, IFN
  interferon, MAC membrane attack complex, MCP1 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1,
  mTORC mammalian target of rapamycin complex, NET neutrophil extracellular traps,
  NO nitric oxide, pDC plasmacytoid dendritic cells, TF tissue factor, TLR toll-like
  receptor, β2GPI β2-glycoprotein I'
