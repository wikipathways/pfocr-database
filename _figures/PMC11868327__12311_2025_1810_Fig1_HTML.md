caption: Molecular cascade illustrating the involvement of GluD2 or GluRδ2 in synaptic
  plasticity, development and maintenance of PF-PC synapses. Black arrows indicate
  pathways involved in mGluR1 mediated LTD induction through GluRδ2/PKC pathway. The
  grey arrow represents the direct or indirect inhibition of PC-CF synapse by mGluR1-mediated
  PKC/ERK pathway. The dotted arrow represents the involvement of the tripartile complex
  in synapse formation, maintenance, and plasticity.?? - mechanism that remain unclear
