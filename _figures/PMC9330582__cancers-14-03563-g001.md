caption: 'The interaction between gut microbiota and the immune system. The intestinal
  microbiota and their metabolites, including SCFAs, induce T-cell differentiation
  mainly on Tregs, Th1, and Th17 cells, impacting systemic immunity. The gut microbiota
  orchestrates Th1 differentiation from CD4+ T-cell by induction of STAT-3 and mTOR
  pathway. In addition, microbiota induces Treg development by the production of IL-10
  and TGF-β. Microbiota and their metabolites may increase the Th17/Treg balance.
  The intestinal microbiota could activate CD8+ T-cells and NK cells which are critical
  in anti-tumor immunity. On the other hand, the immune system modulates systemic
  microbial translocation and inflammation through the activation of PRR signaling
  pathways as well as the production of AMPs. IEL: intraepithelial lymphocytes; PRR:
  pattern recognition receptor; AMP: antimicrobial peptides; DC: dendritic cell; NK:
  natural killer cell; ILC3: Type 3 innate lymphoid cells; TIGIT: T-cell immunoglobulin
  and ITIM domain.'
