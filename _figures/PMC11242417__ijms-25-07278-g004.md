caption: 'Therapeutic strategies for modulating macrophage polarization. (1) Drug
  delivery: immune-instructive modulators, including proteins (such as cytokines,
  chemokines, antibodies, growth factors, and enzymes), nucleic acids, as well as
  other anti-inflammatory and/or pro-wound-healing molecules are delivered to damaged
  tissue, aiming to intervene at different pathway points for the reprogramming of
  macrophages polarization [173]; (2) Biomaterials: Biomaterials, including metallic
  materials, natural polymers and synthetic polymers are applied to regulate macrophage
  polarization to affect the biological behavior of immune factors, while their chemical
  and physical properties can also affect macrophage phenotypes [30,215,217]. Abbreviations:
