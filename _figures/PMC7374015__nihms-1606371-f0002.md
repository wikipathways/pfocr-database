caption: A spatial-temporal view of a patient’s progression pathway. Entities in the
  bag of each visit include a set of medications and diagnoses, which are subject
  to change from time to time. Dotted edges between visits indicate a transition in
  longitudinal view. Bidirectional edges within a visit indicate a co-occurrence in
  cross-sectional view.
