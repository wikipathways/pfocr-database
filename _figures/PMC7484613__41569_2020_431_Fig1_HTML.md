caption: Ageing promotes the development and progression of atherosclerosis through
  different mechanisms, which might be related to age-induced elevations in circulating
  and intracellular IL-6 levels. During ageing, IL-6 signalling in bone marrow adipocytes
  increases. This increased IL-6 signalling might skew haematopoietic stem cells towards
  myeloid cell differentiation and increase the risk of mutations in genes encoding
  transcriptional regulators, such as TET2, that can result in the positive selection
  and expansion of clones of haematopoietic cells without clear development of malignancy
  or other known clonal disorder, a phenomenon known as clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate
  potential (CHIP). Ageing can also have direct effects on haematopoietic stem cells
  (HSCs) that lead to CHIP. Clones of myeloid cells with a TET2 mutation show an increased
  production of IL-6 and IL-1β, which can contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis.
  Ageing can also have pro-atherogenic effects directly on the vasculature. Ageing
  is associated with an increase in the levels of IL-6, possibly mediated by increased
  production by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and mitochondrial genomic instability
  and with a decline in mitochondrial function in the vasculature. The reduced mitochondrial
  function alters mitophagy and increases IL-6 levels, creating a positive feedback
  loop that accelerates atherogenesis. Vascular ageing also leads to the production
  of chemoattractants that increase myeloid cell recruitment into the arterial wall,
  further promoting atherosclerosis. Impaired mitochondrial function combined with
  reduced mitophagy might lead to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
