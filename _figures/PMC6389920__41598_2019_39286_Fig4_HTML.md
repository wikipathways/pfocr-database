caption: The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in tea plants. The numbers in brackets
  following or under of each gene name indicate the number oftranscripts identified
  in this study. The expression levels of the transcripts in the two tissues are represented
  by heat maps. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate-CoAligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H,
  flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′,5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase;
  ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; LAR, leucocyanidin reductase; SCPL1A, type 1A serine
  carboxypeptidase-like acyltransferases.
