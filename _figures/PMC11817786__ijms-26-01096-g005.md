caption: Integrative multi-omics data analysis, including DEGs, DEPs, and DElncRNAs.
  (A) Venn analysis of DEGs, DEPs, and DElncRNA. (B) Venn analysis of KEGG pathways
  from DEGs, DEPs, and DElncRNA. (C) We hypothesize that exosomes are involved in
  the migration and shedding of sperm cytoplasmic droplets by acting on cytoskeleton
  and insulin signaling. Blue color represents down-regulation of expression in the
  high residue group, red color represents up-regulation of expression in the high
  residue group (by Figdraw)
