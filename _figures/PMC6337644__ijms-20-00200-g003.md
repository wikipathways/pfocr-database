caption: 'Telomeres are cap-like features at the ends of chromosomes that help protect
  them when cells divide. Telomeres contain thousands of repeats of the six-nucleotide
  sequence TTAGGG at the chromosome ends, with complementary DNA strand sequences
  AATCCC. 1. In the process of cell division, chromosome replication causes progressive
  telomere shortening, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, leading to cellular
  senescence. 2. The shortening of telomeres can be counteracted by telomerase, which
  is made up of TERT, TERC, and specialized proteins. Telomerase maintains the length
  of telomeres stability by adding TTAGGG repeats to the end of the given chromosome,
  using its complementary TERC sequence as the template, together with TERT subunit
  as the catalytic component. 3. ALT is a phenomenon that 5–10% cancer cases exploit
  a telomerase-independent mechanism to elongate their telomeres []. The transformation
  from telomerase-dependent to ALT-mediated telomere lengthening may be one of strategies
  cancer cells adopt to escape cell senescence and apoptosis caused by telomerase
  dysfunction or absence [,]. ATRX, in collaboration with DAXX and H3.3 promotes the
  processes of telomere shortening [,,]. Evidence shows the ATRX/DAXX/H3.3 complex
  in ALT suppression and a good prognostic factor in GBMs []. Arrow: possible pathway.
