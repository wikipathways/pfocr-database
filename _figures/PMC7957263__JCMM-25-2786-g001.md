caption: Signalling pathways DKK4 involved in different kinds of cancer. DKK4 was
  downregulated in HCC and the canonical Wnt signalling pathway was activated, which
  promoted proliferation, invasion and migration. On the contrary, in Cell Carcinoma
  (RCC), Gastric Cancer (GC), Non‐small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Epithelial Ovarian
  Cancer (EOC), the upregulated DKK4 antagonism with wnts which inhibited the canonical
  Wnt signalling pathway. Meanwhile, DKK4 activated the β‐catenin‐independent Wnt‐JNK
  pathway. In Colorectal Cancer, DKK4 acts as a downstream target of the canonical
  Wnt pathway and could be repressed by 1a,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3. Triiodothyronine
  (T3) and TR up‐regulate the mRNA and protein levels of DKK4 expression. In pancreatic
  cancer, DKK4 was co‐expressed with MAPK proteins, which could active MAPK signalling
