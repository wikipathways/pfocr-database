caption: Schematic of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) processing pathway leading
  to AD. Amyloidogenic processing of APP generates Aβ, a hydrophobic, neurotoxic,
  self-aggregating 40–42 amino acid peptide that accumulates preferentially within
  amyloid plaques.  Recent research suggests that APP processing can result in a number
  of toxic fragments, including N- and C-terminal peptides  that may induce neuronal
  dysfunction, degeneration and death leading to the hypothesis that a number of APP
  fragments are toxic to nerve cells.
