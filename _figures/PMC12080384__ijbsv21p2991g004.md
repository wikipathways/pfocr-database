caption: Multifaceted roles of RBP-regulated non-coding RNAs in tumors. A. RBPs promote
  the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells by affecting mRNAs and ncRNAs associated
  with cellular plasticity and regulating EMT and MET processes. B. RBPs modulate
  ncRNA to affect genes and enzyme activities related to metabolism, impacting various
  metabolic pathways such as glucose metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and fatty
  acid metabolism, influencing tumor progression. C. RBPs regulate the number of CD8+
  T cells in the TME by directly controlling the activity of immunosuppressive and
  proinflammatory factors. Additionally, some RBPs regulate the transcription of ncRNAs
  affecting PD-L1 and CD47, suppressing the RIG-I-MAVS signaling pathway, thus facilitating
  tumor immune evasion. D. RBPs disrupt the conduction of related signaling pathways
  such as the apoptosis signaling pathway, PTEN pathway, and PKR/eIF2α pathway by
  affecting the expression levels of ncRNAs, regulating the drug sensitivity of tumor
  cells. E. RBPs and their regulated ncRNAs mainly affect the binding of ferroptosis-related
  molecules such as NCOA4 binding to FTH1, promoting the expression of ferroptosis-related
  genes DMT1 and TFR1, leading to excessive accumulation of iron ions, and ultimately
  inducing cell death by ferroptosis
