caption: Interzonal signaling. (A) During the first instar, a Dpp signal originates
  from the PSC and activates the Notch pathway by an unknown mechanism in 5–8 preprogenitor
  cells along the medial edge of the primary lobe. The preprogenitors are domeless−,
  proliferate, and give rise to the Domeless+ progenitors of the MZ. (B) Late second
  instar onward, the PSC secretes both Hh and Pvf1, which are needed to maintain progenitor
  quiescence. The niche-derived Hh signal is important for generating an active version
  of Ci (CiACT) in the MZ. The Pvf1-derived signal is sensed by the cells of the CZ,
  which trigger a molecular cascade known as the equilibrium signal that also further
  enhances the stability of CiACT in the MZ. The combination of the niche-derived
  Hh signal and the equilibrium signal arising from newly differentiated cells together
  maintain a progenitor cell population that is adaptable to both homeostatic and
  stress-induced conditions. All arrows represent genetic regulation and not necessarily
  direct molecular steps within a transduction cascade. Adgf-A, Adenosine deaminase
