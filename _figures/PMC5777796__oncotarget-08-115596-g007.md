caption: In the resting state (left panel), Sur8 is maintained at a low level by PKCα-
  and PKCδ-mediated phosphorylation at Thr-71 and Ser-297, respectively, and is subsequently
  degraded. This results in a basal level of cell proliferation. Upon FGF2 stimulation
  (right panel), Sur8 is maintained at a high level by stabilization through degradation
  of PKCα/δ. The stabilized Sur8 promotes transformation and migration of cells via
  activation of the Ras/ERK pathway.
