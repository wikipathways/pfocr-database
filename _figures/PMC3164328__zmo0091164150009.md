caption: Schematic of canonical and alternate modes of action of TZDs. Traditionally,
  TZDs bind to their receptor, PPARγ, which dimerizes with the nuclear receptor RXR
  and acts on peroxisome proliferator response elements together with coactivators
  to promote the transcription of genes involved (e.g., in antidiabetic effects).
  Our data and the literature suggest that the TZDs can act on the GR directly (off-target
  pathway), as well as via the canonical PPARγ pathway with considerable cross-talk
  between the two pathways. In the “off target” pathway, TZDs may imperfectly bind
  to and stimulate the GR via phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, possibly
  resulting in the expression of GC responsive genes. TZDs may also modulate the GR
  pathway indirectly via binding to PPARγ, resulting in subsequent interaction between
  the two receptors directly or through the involvement of common cofactors. TZDs
  may also deactivate MAPKs via a “nongenomic” pathway, which subsequently modifies
  other cellular systems including the phosphorylation of the GR and PPARγ. This schematic
  was modified from the Nuclear Receptor Resource (nrresource.org) with the permission
