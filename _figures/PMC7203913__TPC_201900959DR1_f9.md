  Functioning.(A) GPT1 precursors in the cytosol are covered with chaperons (gray
  ovals) and co-chaperons Trxh7 and Grxc1 as putative redox sensors/transmitters (orange,
  reduced state, -SH; yellow, oxidized state, -S-S-). The hydrophobic membrane domains
  (barrels) of GPT1 are labeled with Roman numerals. Hinge regions of negative net
  charge (blue) may facilitate ER insertion. Left, In the largely reduced state of
  the cytosolic glutathion pool (GSH), the N terminus of GPT1 (green) enters the TOC/TIC
  complex (translocon of the outer/inner chloroplast envelope), the membrane domains
  (MDs) integrate into the inner envelope membrane (IEM), and the TP is processed
  (open arrow)/degraded in the stroma (dotted line). Local oxidation (flash sign,
  open arrow) of the cytosolic glutathion pool (GSSG) likely retains GPT1 in the cytosol
  via a functional change in the bound redox transmitters (Grxc1 and Trxh7). Whether
  this involves glutathionylation of 65C in the GPT1 N terminus is unclear (question
  mark). ER insertion involves the Sec complex and sorting to PerMs via specific peroxins
  (Pex). BFA blocked the ER import of GPT1. OEM, outer envelope membrane.(B) Scheme
  of sugar metabolism in a physiological sink state. Suc is cleaved by cytosolic invertase,
  yielding two hexoses (hex) that are activated by hexokinase (HXK), consuming ATP
  provided by glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. In contrast to GPT2, GPT1
  imports G6P into both plastids (in exchange for Pi released by GPT2-driven starch
  synthesis) and peroxisomes (in exchange for Ru5P, which may also enter plastids
  via GPT1, dashed red arrows), yielding 2 moles of NADPH in the oxidative part of
  the OPPP. NADP inside peroxisomes is formed by NAD kinase (NADK), which relies on
  ATP and NAD imported into peroxisomes via PNC (At3g05290; At5g27520) and PXN (At2g39970).
  The cytosolic OPPP reactions are usually linked via RPE and XPT to the complete
  pathway in the plastid stroma. Abbreviations: PGL, 6-Phosphogluconolactonase; PGD,
  6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; RPE, ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase; RPI, ribose-5-phosphate
