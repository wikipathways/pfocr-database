caption: The cGAS-STING signaling pathway and its role in innate immunity. This illustration
  depicts the activation and downstream signaling cascade of the cGAS-STING pathway,
  a crucial component of the innate immune response to cytosolic DNA. Various sources,
  including dead cells, tumor cells, DNA and retroviruses, and self-DNA, can release
  dsDNA into the cytoplasm, triggering cGAS activation. Upon binding to dsDNA, cGAS
  catalyzes the synthesis of cGAMP, which acts as a second messenger to activate STING
  on the ER. Activated STING translocates to the Golgi apparatus, where it activates
  TBK1, leading to the phosphorylation of both STING and IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3
  dimerizes and induces the transcription of IFN-I. Simultaneously, STING activates
  IKK, resulting in the release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which promotes
  the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IFN-I, in turn, binds to its receptor
  (IFNAR) and initiates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the expression
  of ISGs. These ISGs contribute to diverse immune responses, including enhanced antigen
  presentation, T cell and NK cell activation, antibody production, and direct pathogen
  elimination. The cGAS-STING pathway also regulates the inflammatory response through
  autophagy, which can degrade STING
