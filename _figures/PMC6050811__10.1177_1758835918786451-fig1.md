caption: 'The role of the cyclin D1–CDK4/6–RB pathway in breast cancer.The role of
  the cyclin D1–CDK4/6-RB pathway in breast cancer cells, including cross talk with
  other oncogenic signaling pathways. Mitogenic forces including ER transcriptional
  activity and signaling through ERBB2/PI3K/AKT/mTOR increase cyclin D1 levels, activating
  CDK4/6 and promoting cellular progression to the S phase. There is extensive crosstalk
  between the PI3K and CDK4/6 pathways: not only does PI3K pathway activity increase
  cyclin D1 levels, but the cyclin D–CDK4/6 complex can modulate TSC2 phosphorylation
  and hence mTORC1 activity. Combined inhibition of CDK4/6 and nodes in the PI3K pathway
  can thus maximally suppress mTORC1 activity as well as RB phosphorylation, inhibiting
  two promoters of S phase progression. Furthermore, suppression of E2F activity can
  modulate the tumor cell epigenome, rendering tumor cells more immunogenic and providing
  a rationale for CDK4/6-immunotherapy combinations.AR, androgen receptor; EGFR, epidermal
  growth factor receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; HER, human epidermal growth factor
  receptor; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3-kinase;
  RB, retinoblastoma protein, TSC2, tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (tuberin).'
