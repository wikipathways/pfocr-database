caption: The schematic diagram explains the mechanism underlying by which SP protects
  against colitis. SP improves intestinal mucosal integrity, which was associated
  with inhibiting mtDNA-cGAS-STING signaling or directly repressing the STING pathway
  to attenuate inflammatory response and ferroptosis process, alleviating intestinal
  damage in an NK1R-dependent manner. The figure was drawn by Figdraw
