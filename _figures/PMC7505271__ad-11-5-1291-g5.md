caption: 'Relationships between mitochondrial and histaminergic dysfunctions. (1)
  Histamine content in the synaptic cleft increases due to microglial release. (2)
  Increased HA concentration stimulates H1R and H4R, and subsequent NADPH oxidase,
  which enhances ROS production and leads to mtDNA damage and ETC damage. (3) Increased
  HA content at the synapse also induces the NF kappa-B/AP-1 signalling pathway facilitating
  iNOS synthesis of NO, which in turn leads to glutamate excitotoxicity, nitrosylation
  and nitrosation of proteins, particularly in OXPHOS (ETC damage) and TCA cycle.
  (4) Excessive H2O2produced from upregulated MAO-B leads to damage in mtDNA and the
  TCA cycle. These mechanisms ultimately damage mitochondrial bioenergy production
  in the brain. Arrows indicate stimulation, whereas a line with an end bar indicates
  inhibition. Abbreviations: AP-1, activating protein-1 transcription factor; ETC,
