caption: Transcriptional networks that regulate LIN28B expression. LIN28B is highly
  expressed during embryogenesis and as differentiation progresses, LIN28B expression
  is lost. In adult mammals, only a small subset of somatic cells exist where LIN28B
  expression occurs. Several transcription factors such as MYC and NF-κB promote LIN28B
  transcription, while REST and ESE3/EHF are transcriptional repressors.
