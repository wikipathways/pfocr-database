caption: Transcriptional regulation of Th9 cell generation. The generation of Th9
  cells from naive CD4+ T cells requires T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, IL-2 and
  stimulation by a combination of TGF-β and IL-4. Thus, TCR-nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT), IL-2–signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)
  and IL-4–STAT6 signaling, as well as TGFβ-mediated diversion from Th2 cell differentiation
  pathway, synergistically induce Th9 differentiation. Though these signaling was
  sufficient for the development of Th9 cells, costimulation signaling pathways have
  been identified that drive robust Th9 generation. Costimulatory molecules in TNF
  receptor superfamily, including OX40, GITR and DR3, can activate NF-kB which will
  translocate to the nucleus to induce gene expression. IRF4, interferon (IFN)-regulatory
  factor 4; BATF, basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like; CGRP, calcitonin
  gene-related peptide; DLL, Delta-like ligand; GATA3, GATA-binding protein 3; OX40L,
  OX40 ligand; TSLP, thymic stromal lymphopoietin.
