caption: Schematic of BMP signaling pathway signaling implicated in PAH pathogenesis.
  BMP9 and BMP10 present in the circulation initiate signaling by binding and bringing
  together BMPR2 and ALKI. BMPR2 phosphorylated ALK1 which then propagate the signal
  through phosphorylation of SMAD 1/5/8. Subsequently, SMAD 4 forms a complex with
  SMAD 1/5/8, which translocates to the nucleus regulating the expression of target
  genes.
