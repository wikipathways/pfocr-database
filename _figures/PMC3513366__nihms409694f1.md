caption: 'athways 1–3 represent genetic/epigenetic mechanisms believed to be associated
  with the development of sporadic colonic growths/tumors in humans and rodent models
  of investigation (reviewed in ). At least three sub-types of sporadic Adenomas have
  been described, based on phenotype and associated genotype (in terms of MSI/CIMP/CIN
  (aneuploidy)) (reviewed in ). Many of these genetic/epigenetic changes, associated
  with pathways 1–3, can potentially increase the expression of autocrine progastrins
  (PG) in the colonic growths and serum of patients with CRCs, as described in the
  text. In addition a 4thpathway, termed growth factor/cytokine pathway, can significantly
  increase the risk for developing sporadic colonic growths, in response to DNA damaging
  agents and/or the indicated genetic/epigenetic changes, leading perhaps to more
  aggressive growths in a shorter time-frame. Risk factors, believed to be associated
  with the 4th pathway are indicated and may include: 1) elevated levels of endocrine/paracrine
  progastrins, as in Hypergastrenemic patients; 2) elevated cytokines/growth factors
  associated with inflammation/obesity/specific infections, as discussed in the text.
  The 4th pathway, associated with a sustained increase in the associated risk factors,
  likely results in sustained elevation of the indicated intracellular-kinases/transcription-factors,
  resulting in hyperproliferation of the affected colonic-crypts and possible transformation
  of the colonic-stem-cells, significantly increasing the risk for developing dysplastic/neoplastic
  growths. Abbreviations of key words used in here are described in the text. The
  role of specific molecules/pathways presented in here, were derived from a large
  number of reports in literature, referred to in the text.'
