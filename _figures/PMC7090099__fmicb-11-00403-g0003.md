caption: Integrated analysis of GC-MS and LC-MS profiles. (A) Pathway view of metabolite
  changes in Δsll1330, differential regulated metabolites were represented by color,
  red for down-regulated and green for up-regulated. (B) Pathway view of metabolite
  changes in Δslr6040, differential regulated metabolites were represented by color,
  red for down-regulated and green for up-regulated.
