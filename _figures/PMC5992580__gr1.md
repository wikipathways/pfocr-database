caption: Gene clusters identified via gene interaction analysisLines indicate a physical
  interaction, as assigned by the GeneMANIA plugin for Cytoscape. (A) Gene cluster
  to which the double-strand break repair GO term (GO:0006302) was assigned. (B) Gene
  cluster to which the negative regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signalling pathway
  via death domain receptors GO term (GO:1902042) was assigned. GO=Gene Ontology.
