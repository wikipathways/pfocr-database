caption: Some of the proposed signaling pathways activated by NK-R. (1) Gαs activation
  of AC catalyzes ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), which in turn binds to the regulatory
  subunits of the cAMP-dependent PKA. Usually PKA phosphorylates the CREB transcription
  factor. CREB binds to the cAMP response element (CRE) of a target gene and negatively
  affects the activation of NF-кB []. (2) Inhibition of the AC is performed by Pertussis
  toxin sensitive Gi protein []. Furthermore, Gi and βγ subunits enhance Erk1/2 activation
  after EGFR-mediated transactivation by Src protein []. (3) The SP binding to its
  receptor triggers a GTP-for-GDP exchange on Gα subunits, thus dissociating Gαq from
  Gβγ and subsequently activating downstream effectors such as PLC. This enzyme catalyzes
  the conversion of PIP2 in the second messenger IP3 and DAG, stimulating calcium
  mobilization and PKC activation, respectively []. Via nonreceptor protein kinases
  such as Src or Pyk2, PKC may activate the MAPK pathway but may also activate the
  Raf protein directly []. Another parallel mechanism that regulates MAPK may be developed
  during NK-1R internalization and its protein recruitment by β-arrestins [, ]. Although
  the mechanism is unknown, the Erk1/2 protein is also involved in NF-кB activation
  []. This Gαq subunit also mediates IL-6 production by activation of p38 MAPK [].
  (4) The Gα12/13 subunit is responsible for the activation of Rho/Rock which directly
  regulates the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (MLC) []. Phosphorylation
  of this protein is associated with cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration.
  The βγ dimer activates proteins such as Src, PI3K, and PLC []. This figure was made
