caption: Summary of effects of ES1 and BFA on endosomal sorting. (A) Disturbance of
  endocytosis, endosome sorting and signaling by ES1. ES1 selectively disrupts the
  endocytosis of PIN2, AUX1 and BRI1, but not the endocytosis of PIN1 or PIN7, indicating
  that the endocytic apparatus has at least two pathways of endocytosis. ES1 leads
  to the formation of endomembrane bodies (endosidin bodies) that incorporate early
  endosomes defined by SYP61-CFP and VHA-a1-GFP. PIN2, AUX1 and BRI1 are normally
  endocytosed via this population of endosomes; however in the presence of ES1, these
  endosomes agglomerate. Paired arrows between PIN1 and PIN7 endosomes and TGN/Golgi
  indicate a presumed recycling pathway. In this model, a brassinosteroid-responsive
  NAC family transcription factor (At5g46590) is inhibited by treatment with ES1.
  (B) Disturbance of endocytosis, endosome sorting and signaling by BFA. BFA disrupts
  Golgi-based secretion and leads to the formation of endomembrane bodies (BFA bodies)
  that incorporate early endosomes and TGN components as well as Golgi resident proteins.
  In this model, BFA causes agglomeration of the endosomal population of BRI1 and
  causes the downregulation of the expression of DRWF4, mimicking exogenously applied
  BR.
