caption: Alcohol induces microglial cells to release eCIRP, which binds to IL-6Rα
  activating neuronal STAT3/Cdk5 pathway (shown in inset) and causes AD-associated
  pathological tau phosphorylation and aggregation in neurons. Apart from IL-6Rα signaling,
  eCIRP can also potentially activate TLR4 signaling in neurons causing ER stress,
  NLRP3 activation, or mitochondrial dysfunction to cause neuronal damage and death.
  The oligopeptide C23 can potentially attenuate alcohol-induced AD tauopathy by targeting
  eCIRP’s activation. The released eCIRP also reactivates microglia via TLR4-complex
  and mediates neuroinflammation and potential indirect neuronal damage. eCIRP can
  also potentially mediate HMGB1 release or impact phagocytic activity of microglia
  regulating amyloid clearance or influence tau spreading.
