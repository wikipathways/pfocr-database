caption: Potential mechanisms of electromagnetic field regulation on neural stem cells.
  Ca2+ and CREB might be the hinge of effects, because of a lack of excitability of
  NSCs, and according to the Faraday effects, a possible mechanism could be that the
  MFs facilitate the exchange of intracellular and extracellular ions through these
  long-term opened ion channels and upregulate the expression of voltage-gated Ca2+
  channels (VGCCs) or TRPC1 result in a current and potential difference of NSCs,
  Ca2+ flood into from extracellular matrix or endoplasmic reticulum through the voltage-dependent
  channel or the force of MF itself; on the one hand, intracellular Ca2+ stimulates
  phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB activating the CREB signaling pathway,
  pCREB recruits more CBP, and p300 initiates the transcriptional machinery, including
  histone acetyltransferase. Alternatively, calcium or other ELFEF-activated signals
  could induce histone modifications and chromatin unravelling, leading to the pCREB
  binding and the start of transcription. On the other hand, the pCREB is able to
  bind to the promoter of a series of miRNAs to modulate their expression. In addition,
  CREB itself as well as the epigenetics mechanisms could affect the expression of
  BDNF which plays a critical role in the activities of NSCs.
