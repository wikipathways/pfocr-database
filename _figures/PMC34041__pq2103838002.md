  a consensus view based on the work of many groups,  reviewed in refs.  and . (A)
  The shaded area  represents the pathway in T. brucei procyclic cells and  the nonshaded
  area represents the additional fatty acid remodeling  steps and attachment to VSG
  unique to T. brucei  bloodstream forms. (A and B) The location  of the MT-III enzyme,
  encoded by the TbGPI10 and  PIG-B genes in the parasite (A) and  mammalian (B) cells,
  respectively, is indicated in  red.
