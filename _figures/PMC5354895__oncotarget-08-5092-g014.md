caption: Overexpression of CUG2 together with NPM1 activates Sp1 and Smad2/3 transcription
  factors, which bind to the TGF-β promoter. This eventually enhances production of
  TGF-β protein. The produced TGF-β binds to the TGF-β receptor in autocrine or paracrine
  manner. TGF-β signaling activates Akt and MAPKs in non-canonical ways. P38 MAPK
  is also directly activated by CUG2 although the signaling pathway is unknown. Subsequently,
  Akt and MAPK activate Smad2/3, Snail, Twist transcription factors as master regulators
  of EMT. Finally, Sp1 and activated Smad2/3 in the nucleus enhances binding to the
  CUG2 promoter, leading to increase of CUG2 transcription, which is a synergistic
  feedback system for both the elevated expression of CUG2 and TGF-β.
