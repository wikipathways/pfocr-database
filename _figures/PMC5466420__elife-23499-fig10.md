caption: 'We propose nuclear Yap specifies the identity of ductal progenitors, in
  part by promoting the expression of Ereg and subsequent activation of EGFR signaling.
  Activated Lats1/2 in the maturing ductal structures promotes the phosphorylation
  of Yap, which directs the removal of nuclear Yap to support ductal epithelial differentiation.DOI:
