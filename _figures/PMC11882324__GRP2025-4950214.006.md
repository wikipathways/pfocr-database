caption: NETs play an important role in the crosstalk between neutrophils and pancreatic
  cancer cells. A schematic representation illustrating the stimulation of the STING
  pathway by NETs in pancreatic cancer cells, leading to the secretion of IL-8. IL-8
  subsequently enhances neutrophil chemotaxis and promotes NETs formation, ultimately
  establishing a vicious cycle
