caption: System design. (a) A schematic of the process for creating AMD and normal
  cybrids using polyethylene glycol fusion of mitochondria-free ARPE-19 (Rho0) cells
  and mitochondria-rich platelets isolated from peripheral blood of AMD patients or
  age-matched normal patients. (b) A schematic which illustrates the bidirectional
  signaling pathway mediated by the coculture of hRPCs with AMD cybrids. (c) A schematic
  of the process for isolating human retinal progenitor cells from human fetal eyes.
  aHuman fetal eyes (17-20 weeks gestational age) were obtained from the therapeutic
  termination of pregnancy.
