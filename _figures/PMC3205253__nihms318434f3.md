caption: All the enzymes for which a catalytic activity has been identified are labeled
  in red, whereas the putative β-oxidation enzymes are labeled in magenta. The carbon
  atoms derived from the ring nucleus are converted to CO2 via the tricarboxylic acid
  cycle (TCA), whereas the propionyl-CoA produced from the degradation of the side-chain
  is assimilated into mycobacterial lipids, including the virulence factor PDIM. The
  enzymes and the cholesterol metabolites are described in the text. The methylmalonyl
  pathway enzymes include a propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) and a vitamin B12-dependent
  methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM). The fate of DOHNAA is still unknown.
