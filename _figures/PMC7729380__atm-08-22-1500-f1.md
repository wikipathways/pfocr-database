caption: 'Schematic illustration of miRNA-based gene therapy delivered by a thermo-responsive
  vector for intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). (A) The chemical structure of
  cationic block copolymers: PNIPAM-b-PAsp (DET) and PEG-b-PAsp (DET). (B) The mixed
  cationic block copolymers (MCBC) PNIPAM-b-PAsp (DET) and PEG-b-PAsp (DET) as vectors
  for miRNA to form mixed polyplex micelles. With a temperature increase from room
  temperature (25 °C) to physiological temperature (37 °C), thermo-sensitivity of
  PNIPAM segments become hydrophobic and form more compact mixed polyplex micelles
  with hydrophobic and hydrophilic heterogeneous surfaces. The mixed cationic block
  copolymers delivered miRNA-25-3p for IDD gene therapy.'
