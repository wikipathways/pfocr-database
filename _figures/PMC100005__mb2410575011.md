caption: 'Model for formation of TrkA–src-aPKC complexes. TrkA binds the signaling
  adapter FRS2/SNT at tyrosine 490, which would enable recruitment of c-src to the
  receptor (1) (). On the other hand, TrkA also directly binds ZIP/p62, which recruits
  aPKC to the receptor (2) (). A ternary complex between TrkA-FRS2/SNF and p62 can
  be formed via the binding of aPKC and src. In addition, ZIP/p62 and aPKC are capable
  of binding to TRAF6, the critical regulator of the NF-κB pathway, thereby directly
  linking components of the receptor complex to activation of the κB pathway. Therefore,
  the NGF-induced activation of NF-κB may be modulated by any one of the following
  upstream critical regulatory elements: FRS2, src, p62/ZIP, and aPKC.'
