caption: Working model for neuronal circuit mechanism underlying the positive interaction
  between ASH and ASK sensory neuronsASK promotes ASH activities via sending cGMP
  to ASH through gap junctions. While ASH excites ASK via a disinhibitory neuronal
  circuit consisting of ASH, AIA, and ASK. In detail, ASH inhibits AIA by glutamate/GLC-3
  signaling pathway, and AIA suppresses ASK via FLP-1/NPR-5 signaling. Thus, activation
  of ASH removes AIA inhibition on ASK and then excites ASK indirectly.
