caption: A schematic diagram illustrating the metabolic pathways that catabolize lysine.
  Metabolites highlighted in red text were measured using a targeted metabolomics
  approach. Solid black arrows represent the LKRSDH-dependent pathway. Blue solid
  arrows indicate the postulated pipecolic acid pathway. Dashed arrows indicate those
  metabolic reactions are catalyzed by bacterial enzymes. *, saccharopine was undetectable
  in both control and mutant samples.
