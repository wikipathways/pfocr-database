caption: Post-translational modification of PPARγ regulates atherosclerosis. (A) Both
  phosphorylation of PPARγ at S112 by CDK7/9 or MAPK and phosphorylation of PPARγ
  at S273 accelerates foam cell formation and atherosclerosis through different signaling
  pathway, some PPARγ agonist (WSF-7, SR1664) can block cdk5 mediated Ser273 phosphorylation.
  (B) Acetylation of PPARγ at K268/K293 increases atherosclerosis through upregulating
  ABCA1, ABCG1, and NcoR but inhibiting PRDM16,while deacetylation of PPARγ at K268
  and K293 alleviates atherosclerosis, while PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (Rosi) could
  deacetylate PPARγ at K268/K293. (C) Sumoylation of PPARγ at K107 promotes VSMCs
  proliferation and migration, but sumoylation of PPARγ at K395, such as by Rosi,
  has anti-inflammation effect.
