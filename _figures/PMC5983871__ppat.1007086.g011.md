caption: '(A) The P3 precursor polyprotein is cleaved by the 3C-encoded protease activity
  by two distinct pathways: major and minor. Therefore, proteins 3AB and 3CD are present
  at substantially higher levels in an infected cell than products of the minor pathway.
  (B) 3CD hijacks the GBF1-Arf1-PI4KB pathway to induce PI4P biosynthesis. How 3CD
  recruits GBF1 to the membrane remains unclear. This recruitment event leads to Arf1
  activation and is sensitive to golgicide A (GCA). Alteration of the back of the
  thumb of the 3D domain of 3CD (3CDm) interferes with Arf1 activation. Post-Arf1
  activation, PI4KB is recruited to membranes and is itself activated for synthesis
  of PI4P. PI4P biosynthesis is inhibited by the PI4KB inhibitor, PIK93. Steps leading
  to recruitment and/or activation of PI4KB require the 3C domain of 3CD and are defective
  in 3CmD. The ability of 3CDm and 3CmD to complement the other () suggests that 3CD
  functions minimally at two discrete steps (black boxes). Importantly, these black
  boxes represent the least understood aspects of the normal pathway of PI4P biosynthesis:
  recruitment of GBF1 to membranes and recruitment of PI4KB to membranes and its subsequent
  activation. Identification of the cellular targets of 3CD may illuminate the cellular
  proteins participating in these black boxes of the normal cellular pathway of PI4P
  biogenesis. Biosynthesis of both PIP2 (PI4,5P2) and PC is also induced by 3CD. Induction
  of the synthesis of these lipids occurs by mechanisms distinct from that of PI4P
  as both 3CDm and 3CmD retain the capacity to cause elevation of these lipids ().
  Essentially nothing is known about how 3CD might induce the biosynthesis of these
  lipids, hence the big red question mark. However, as for PI4P biosynthesis, a non-genomic
  mechanism of induction is predicted by the inability of actinomycin D to interfere
  with induction of the biosynthesis of these lipids (Figs ,  and ). (C) The interaction
  of 3A with membrane spans the bilayer but that of 3AB does not. These differences
  in interaction with membrane may give rise to the functional differences reported
  herein. (D) It is well established that 3A interferes with GBF1 activation causing
  dissolution of the Golgi. The literature is rife with examples of 3A impacting localization
  and/or activity of PI4K either directly or in collaboration with ACBD3. Our studies
  reveal loss of PI4P in the presence of 3A. Whether or not this is caused by dissolution
  of the Golgi or active interference with PI4K activation or catalysis is not known.
  None of the activities of 3A can be modulated by the presence of 3CD. (E) 3AB showed
  no substantive change to Golgi integrity, so interactions with GBF1 may not occur.
  Golgi-associated PI4P was depleted in the presence of 3AB. It is not known if this
  outcome requires an interaction with PI4K, requires interference with PI4K activation
  and/or catalysis, or uses a PI4K-independent mechanism. What is clear, however,
  is that the ability of 3AB to interfere with steady-state levels of PI4P is suppressed
  completely in the presence of 3CD.'
