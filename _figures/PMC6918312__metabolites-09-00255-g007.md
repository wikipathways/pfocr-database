caption: 'Probable pathways involved in spongy tissue formation. Ripening stage wise
  accumulation of each metabolite in all the three tissue sets is represented by heat
  map (MR: Mature raw, TG: Table green, MiR: Mid ripe, R: Ripe, H: Healthy, S: Spongy,
  SC: Spongy control). Heatmap (A) represents the putative metabolites from starch
  degradation, amino acid synthesis, TCA and ascorbate glutathione cycle whereas Heatmap
  (B) represents the metabolites from shikimic acid and adipic acid pathway. Metabolites
  identified in analysis are separated by box. Metabolites which are upregulated at
  the completely ripe stage of spongy tissue as compared to the healthy and the spongy
  control are represented in blue whereas downregulated metabolites are highlighted
  in red. Other metabolites are the components of respective pathways but are not
  identified in the current analysis. Black arrow indicates normal metabolic pathways
  whereas blue arrow (SSA to ROS synthesis) represents the probable metabolic variation
  which may induce physiological disorder. Pathways in which probable metabolic change
  occurs (GABA shunt and Ascorbate glutathione cycle) are highlighted separately.
