caption: PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) is activated
  through stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the concomitant assembly
  of receptor-PI-3K complexes at the membrane. PI-3K catalyses the conversion of Ptdlns(4,5)P2
  (PIP2) to Ptdlns(3,4,5)P2 (PIP3) which serves as a second messenger and helps to
  activate Akt. The activated Akt by PDK1 mediates several cellular targets, such
  as MDM2, mTOR, GSK3β, NFκB, FKHR and BAD. The regulation of these targets results
  in increased cellular growth, survival, proliferation and decreased apoptosis.
