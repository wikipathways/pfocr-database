caption: Synthesis of the monomethyl branched-chain fatty acid C17ISO is necessary
  to initiate L1 growth and development. Catabolism of essential, branched-chain amino
  acids produces the precursors of C15ISO, which is converted into C17ISO by the polyunsaturated
  fatty acid elongases ELO-5 and ELO-6. The pathway depicted for C15ISO synthesis
  is incomplete.
