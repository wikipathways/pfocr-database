caption: 'Overview of the E. coli–S. cerevisiae co-culture system for de novo resveratrol
  biosynthesis. The resveratrol pathway is divided into two modules for co-culture-based
  biosynthesis: the upstream E. coli module for p-coumaric acid production and the
  downstream S. cerevisiae module for p-coumaric acid-to-resveratrol conversion. Improved
  resveratrol production can be achieved through optimization of inoculated cell number
  ratios, fermentation temperatures, and cultivation times. A solid line represents
  an enzymatic reaction through an indicated enzyme whereas the dashed line represents
  reaction involving multiple enzymes. Overexpressed enzymes are labeled in red text
  with red arrows. Enzymes encoded by the genes shown are aroGfbr, feedback-inhibition-resistant
  3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase; tyrAfbr, feedback-inhibition-resistant
  chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydrogenase; TAL, tyrosine ammonia lyase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA
  ligase; STS, resveratrol synthase; ACC1S659A,S1157A, inhibition-resistant acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase. The tyrR, a transcription factor that represses tyrosine synthesis
  pathway genes, is deleted in the upstream module'
