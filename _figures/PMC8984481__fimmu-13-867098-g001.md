caption: Mechanisms of lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Following activation, cytotoxic effector
  cells can kill through granule-mediated cytotoxicity, death receptor-mediated cytotoxicity,
  or TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. (A) During granule-mediated cytotoxicity, perforin
  and granzymes are released from lytic granules into the synaptic cleft. Perforin
  forms pores in the target cell membrane. At high concentrations of perforin, osmotic
  flux through pores leads to cell swelling and necrotic cell death. Perforin can
  facilitate the uptake of granzyme B through direct diffusion or endocytosis. Granzyme
  B directly cleaves caspase 3 to induce apoptosis or triggers the mitochondrial apoptotic
  pathway via Bid cleavage into tBid. tBid recruits Bax/Bak leading to mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and apoptosis. Granzyme B may also degrade
  Mcl-1 releasing Bim to activate MOMP. Granzyme B can also cleave ICAD contributing
  to DNA damage, α-tubulin leading to cytoskeletal degradation, or gasdermin E, which
  forms pores in the cell membrane to induce pyroptosis. (B) Ligation of death receptors
  (Fas/DR4/DR5) by FasL or TRAIL triggers assembly of the death-inducing signalling
  complex (DISC) composed of FADD and pro-caspase 8/10. Caspase 8/10 induces apoptosis
  via direct caspase 3 cleavage or the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via Bid cleavage.
  (C) Ligation of TNFR1 by TNF triggers the assembly of complex I (TRADD, RIPK1, TRAF2,
  cIAP1/2). LUBAC ubiquitinates complex I components leading to pro-survival signalling
  via NF-κB and MAPK pathways. In the absence of ubiquitination, RIPK1 dissociates
  and forms complex II with FADD and pro-caspase 8/10. Cleavage of pro-caspase 8/10
  triggers apoptosis by the same pathways as FasL/TRAIL. In the presence of insufficient
  pro-caspase 8, RIPK1 can also recruit RIPK3, which activates MLKL to trigger necroptosis.

  description: Mechanisms of lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Following activation, cytotoxic
    effector cells can kill through granule-mediated cytotoxicity, death receptor-mediated
    cytotoxicity, or TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. (A) During granule-mediated cytotoxicity,
    perforin and granzymes are released from lytic granules into the synaptic cleft.
    Perforin forms pores in the target cell membrane. At high concentrations of perforin,
    osmotic flux through pores leads to cell swelling and necrotic cell death. Perforin
    can facilitate the uptake of granzyme B through direct diffusion or endocytosis.
    Granzyme B directly cleaves caspase 3 to induce apoptosis or triggers the mitochondrial
    apoptotic pathway via Bid cleavage into tBid. tBid recruits Bax/Bak leading to
    mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and apoptosis. Granzyme B
    may also degrade Mcl-1 releasing Bim to activate MOMP. Granzyme B can also cleave
    ICAD contributing to DNA damage, α-tubulin leading to cytoskeletal degradation,
    or gasdermin E, which forms pores in the cell membrane to induce pyroptosis. (B)
    Ligation of death receptors (Fas/DR4/DR5) by FasL or TRAIL triggers assembly of
    the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) composed of FADD and pro-caspase
