caption: In the cytosol, CRTC1 is phosphorylated at S151 by the cAMP-SIK pathway and
  is inactivated through interactions with 14–3–3 proteins. Ca2 + influx through L-type
  VGCCs stimulates calcineurin-dependent CRTC1 dephosphorylation. CRTC1 is activated
  by calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation. Dephosphorylated CRTC1 is translocated
  to the nucleus, where it is likely phosphorylated at S215 by PAK4, which triggers
  CREB-mediated transcription. In PD, oxidative stress and aggregated α-Syn decrease
  PAK4 activity and reduce pCRTC1S215 levels, which subsequently decrease the expression
  of CREB target genes such as BDNF, Bcl-2, and PGC-1α, leading to dopaminergic neuron
  death. CRE, cAMP response element; CREB CRE-binding protein, CRTC1 CREB-regulated
  transcription coactivator 1, CBP CREB-binding protein, SIK1 salt-inducible kinase
  1, VGCC voltage-gated calcium channel, BDNF brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Bcl-2
  B-cell lymphoma 2, PGC-1α peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator
  1 alpha, TH tyrosine hydroxylase
