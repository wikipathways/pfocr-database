caption: Schematic representation of the Ror-family receptors (Ror1/Ror2)-mediated
  signaling, implicated in the regulation of Wnt5a-induced cell polarity, migration,
  proliferation, and survival. (A) The Ror-family receptors induce filopodia formation
  and JNK activation via the interaction with FLNa, leading to the regulation of cell
  polarity and migration. Wnt5a-Ror signaling can also induce activation of c-Src
  and Dvl, leading to the activation of JNK. c-Src and GSK3, respectively, phosphorylate
  the Ror-family receptors on their tyrosine and serine/threonine residues, both of
  which are required for Wnt5a-induced cell polarity and migration. (B) Wnt5a-Ror
  signaling can activate PI3K-Akt pathway presumably via CKIε associated with Ror1/Ror2,
  which in turn promotes cell proliferation and survival. c-Src, activated by Wnt5a-Ror
  signaling, can also induce activation of Akt, thereby contributing to cell proliferation
  and survival.
