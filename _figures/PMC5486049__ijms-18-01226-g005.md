caption: Scheme representing major factors of CWIP and the calcineurin signaling pathway.
  Impaired O-mannosylation results in severe growth defect in the absence of factors
  depicted in red (growth inhibition of 75% or more) and green (growth inhibition
  of 74% mkk2∆ and 73% rlm1∆). Details are described in . Our screening also revealed
  Ste20 and Tor1, involved in mating/filamentous growth/sterile vegetative growth
  signaling and in nutrient sensing, respectively ().
