caption: 'Immune response involving circRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential
  mechanism of circRNAs in inflammation. During virus infection, nuclear factor 90
  (NF90) and its 110 (NF110) isoform produced by interleukin-enhanced binding factor
  3 (ILF3) bind to viral mRNA to inhibit virus replication through two pathways: transport
  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and decoupling from the circRNA-protein complex
  (CircRNPs) in the cytoplasm. Among them, the transport of NF90/NF110 from the nucleus
  to the cytoplasm can reduce the expression of circRNAs. In contrast, the binding
  of NF90/NF110 to dsRNA formed during pre-mRNA processing can not only stabilize
  the RNA duplex but also promote reverse splicing to form circRNA (). 2’-5’ Oligoadenylate
  (2’-5’A) is generated by the combination of 2’-5’ oligoadenylate synthase (OAS)
  and viral genome dsRNA and plays an antiviral effect by significantly increasing
  the activity of RNase L to degrade viral RNA and interfere with viral protein synthesis.
  Endogenous circRNAs often form incomplete RNA duplexes and act as inhibitors of
  PKR activation by dsRNAs associated with innate immunity. Meanwhile, circRNAs can
  be globally degraded by the endonuclease RNase L to activate the PKR antiviral pathway
  (). In addition, parental genes enriched for differentially expressed circRNAs in
  signalling pathways that are significantly regulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection are
  associated with multiple antiviral signalling pathways (, , ). The generation of
  a cytokine storm is related to the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines mediated
  by circRNAs. In macrophages, circ_09505 acts as a sponge of miR-6089 through the
  IκBα/NFκB signalling pathway, on the one hand, promoting the expression of AKT1
  in macrophages and the activation of NF-κB, and on the other hand, promoting the
  production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-12 (). Furthermore,
  circ_0044073 in HUVSMCs and HUVECs functions as a miR-107 sponge to downregulate
  the expression levels of target mRNAs, while activation of the JAK/STAT signalling
  pathway enhanced the expression of the downstream proteins Bcl2 and c-myc. Moreover,
  circ_0044073 significantly upregulated the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines
  IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α (). In addition, the occurrence of a cytokine storm disrupts
  the balance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, thereby invading
  the patient’s nervous system (, ).'
