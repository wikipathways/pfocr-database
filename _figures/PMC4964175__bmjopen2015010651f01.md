caption: Pharmacological targets of ibuprofen. Intracellular signalling cascades converge
  at the GTPase RhoA, which is activated after SCI by myelin and scar-associated proteins
  (for review, see refs. 5, 7 and 29). Downstream to Rho, the activated ROCK inhibits
  axonal regrowth, promotes neurodegeneration, contributes to the development of neuropathic
  pain and tissue loss and impedes neurorestoration and functional recovery (reviewed
  by Watzlawick et al). This pathway can be blocked by the ROCK inhibitors Y-27632
  and fasudil or the specific Rho inhibitors P21CIP1/WAF1, C3 transferase, and by
  the R(−) and S(−) enantiomers of ibuprofen,      as the most convincing Rho inhibitor
  among individual drugs from the group of NSAIDs. Ibuprofen-mediated Rho inhibition
  depends on the upregulation of PPARγ. Treatment with PPARγ agonists was demonstrated
  to have anti-inflammatory effects  and to protect tissue and thereby motor function
  in other CNS injury conditions (reviewed by McTigue). It is not yet clear whether
  the inhibition of NF-κB as a further target of R(−)/S(+) ibuprofen is independent
  of PPARγ. Notably, PPARγ inhibits gene expression by antagonising the activities
  of the proinflammatory transcription factors NF-κB. Another pathway, mainly operated
  by the S enantiomer of ibuprofen, is the inhibition of COX 1/2 and consequently
  of the prostaglandin E2 production, which activates NF-κB or counterregulates it
  at very high concentrations. COX 1/2 and NF-κB are associated with inflammation-induced
  neuropathic pain,  neurodegeneration, sickness behaviour and the systemic inflammatory
  response syndrome.  Systemic inflammation contributes to neurogenic heterotopic
  ossificastions. Taken together, Rho-blocking NSAIDs have the potential to decrease
  the systemic and acute CNS inflammatory response by targeting at least two separate
  pathways, PPARγ and COX 1/2. The suspected side effect of neuroprotective anti-inflammatory
  therapy, that is, that it further limits the regeneration capacity of spared axons,
  is suggested to be abrogated by Rho inhibition. CNS, central nervous system; COX,
  cyclooxygenase; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; NSAIDs,
