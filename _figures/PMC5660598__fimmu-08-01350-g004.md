caption: Dexamethasone (Dex) and monphosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) treatment leads to changes
  in the expression of genes involved in biological processes associated with immune
  response regulation. (A) Ingenuity pathway analysis network interaction analysis
  of differentially expressed genes in Dex-modulated and MPLA-activated dendritic
  cells shows that genes modulated by Dex and MPLA are involved in the control of
  T-cell activation, cell movement, and metabolism. (B) Network interaction analysis
  of genes from Cluster 6 (see Figure ), modulated synergically by dexamethasone and
  MPLA.
