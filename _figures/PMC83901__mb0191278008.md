caption: Model of the regulation of class II MHC genes by IFN-γ. B-cell constitutive
  expression of CIITA is mediated by the proximal 5′-flanking sequences of promoter
  III (horizontally hatched box). In contrast, induction of this promoter by IFN-γ
  is mediated by distal upstream sequences (diagonally hatched box). Binding of IFN-γ
  to its receptor activates JAK kinases which results in phosphorylation of STAT1.
  It is likely that STAT1 activation is accompanied by activation of the CIITA promoter
  directly via STAT1 binding to sequences in this region (black arrow). In addition,
  STAT1 activation induces transcription of CIITA promoter IV both by binding directly
  to sequences in this promoter (open arrow) and by inducing the transcription of
  IRF-1 that is also required for promoter activation (dashed arrow). CIITA then activates
  transcription of the class II MHC, Ii, and DM genes through common sequences found
  in the promoter regions of these genes. Binding of TGF-β to its receptor interferes
  with CIITA gene expression by attenuating the basal activity of both CIITA promoters.
  It is likely that suppression by TGF-β occurs by a mechanism that is distinct from
  the pathway of induction by IFN-γ.
