caption: Distribution between short and long flap removal pathways. The main  pathway
  (thick arrows) involves limited strand displacement by Pol  δ, followed by FEN1
  cutting of the single nucleotide flap. This process  is iterated until all initiator
  RNA (iRNA; red) is degraded  (Nick Translation). Long flap formation (dashed arrows)  results
  from excessive strand displacement synthesis. It is reduced by the  exonuclease
  (Exo) activity of Pol δ (Idling) and  promoted by the actions of Pol32 or Pif1.
  Dna2 cuts long flaps that are  further degraded to precise nicks by FEN1 or the
  exonuclease activity of Pol  δ (Long Flap Processing).
