caption: The role of albumin overload in tubular epithelial cells. Under pathological
  conditions, albumin excessively filters over the capacity of reabsorption by proximal
  tubular cells. The albumin is endocytosed in the cytoplasm by megalin–cubilin receptors
  and induces MyD88-NF-κB signalling, which acts as a priming signal for Nlrp3, ASC
  and caspase-1 assembly. The priming process is associated with the NF-κB pathway,
  allowing Nlrp3 mRNA transcription and pro-cytokine preparation. Excessive albumin
  also leads to mitochondrial stress and ROS generation. Nlrp3 inflammasome activation
  by the detection of ROS release cleaves precursors of relative cytokines and secretes
  IL-1β and IL-18 to the interstitium for the subsequent inflammatory response.
