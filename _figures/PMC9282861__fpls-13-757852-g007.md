caption: Accumulation of bioactive molecules and protectants in response to T. calospora.
  (A) Integration of metabolomic and proteomic data. Joint pathway analysis by MetaboAnalyst
  5.0. (B) Estimation of total phenolic content. GAE, gallic acid equivalents. Data
  represent the means and standard deviation of at least four biological replicates
  (tubers of four inoculated plants and five mock-treated controls). (C) Expected
  metabolic flux based on integration of proteomics and metabolomics data. Statistically
  significant differences (Student’s t-test) at p < 0.1 (*) and p < 0.01 (**). (D)
  Relative auxin content in orchid tubers. Data represent the means and standard deviation
  of at least four biological replicates (tubers of four inoculated plants and five
  mock-treated controls) and were normalized to the auxin content in mock-treated
  tubers (48 ± 42 ng g−1 DW). For details, see  and .
