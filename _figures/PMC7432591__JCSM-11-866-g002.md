caption: Major signalling pathways associated with sarcopenia and peripheral arterial
  disease (PAD). In the context of PAD, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury induces
  a decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, and mitophagic activities, resulting
  in reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and consecutive oxidative stress. Additionally,
  elevated levels of IL6, TNF‐α, and CRP are responsible for the activation of the
  inflammatory pathway. Ultimately, I/R‐induced oxidative stress and inflammation
  enhance the activity of the atrophy‐related ubiquitin ligases MuRF‐1 and atrogin‐1
  and the degradation of mitochondria and proteins. I/R is also associated with defective
  stimulation of the muscle synthesis PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, notably via lower activity
  of the IGF‐1 and RISK pathways. Moreover, alteration of the protective pathways
  RISK and SAFE lead to persistent mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP)
  opening, reduction in mitochondrial calcium retention capacity, and aggravation
  of mitochondrial dysfunction. Further, during I/R, myostatin overexpression results
  in enhanced activity of the muscle degradation pathway TGFβ.
