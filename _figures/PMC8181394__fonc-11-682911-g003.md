caption: (A) Cholesterol metabolism. De novo cholesterol biosynthesis mainly relies
  on the activity of four key enzymes. HMGCR catalyzes the formation of mevalonate.
  Mevalonate is essential for farnesyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis, which is in turn
  exploited by SQS for squalene production. SQL converts squalene into its epoxydic
  form, which is eventually cyclized to lanosterol by OSC. Lastly, lanosterol is converted
  to cholesterol. HDL particles collect extrahepatic cholesterol and allow its cellular
  uptake by interacting with SR-B1. Alternatively, LDL-associated cholesterol can
  be captured and internalized in coated endocytic vesicles in a LDLR-mediated fashion.
  Intracellular cholesterol excess is converted into cholesteryl esters by ACAT1 and
  stored into lipid droplets. Cellular cholesterol efflux is mainly controlled by
  ABCA1 and ABCG1, two regulatory proteins belonging to the ATP-binding cassette transporter
  superfamily. Cellular cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by sterol-sensitive
  systems, such as SREBP2 and LXR. SREBP2-mediated adaptative response promotes cholesterol
  biosynthesis and uptake. Conversely, LXR promotes cholesterol excretion while impairing
  its uptake and production. PPARα activation promotes LXR-mediated ABCA1 expression
  and blocks cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting SREBP2. (B) Pharmacological targeting
  of de novo cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Statins target and inhibit the activity
  of the rate-limiting enzyme HMGCR. Ro 48-8071 and Zaragozic acid act downstream
  of the mevalonate pathway, by inhibiting the activity of SQS and OSC, respectively.
  (C) Pharmacological targeting of cholesterol efflux and storage. The PPARα agonist
  Fenofibrate promotes PPARα-RXR interaction, thereby activating the PPARα signaling
  cascade. Both synthetic (CP-113818, Avasimibe, Avasimin) and natural (Bitter melon
  extract) inhibitors of ACAT-1 block cholesterol esterification and intracellular
  overload. (D) Pharmacological targeting of cholesterol homeostasis. LXR agonists,
  such as GW3965, T0901317, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and LXR623, can activate LXR
  signaling cascade, leading to increased cholesterol efflux and reduced cholesterol
  uptake. HMGCR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; SQS, Squalene synthase;
