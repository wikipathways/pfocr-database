caption: 'Maps of tryptophan metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction pathways:
  (A) tryptophan metabolism (auxin biosynthesis pathway); and (B) plant hormone signal
  transduction pathway. The red rectangles represent increased abundance proteins,
  and the green rectangles represent decreased abundance proteins. Definition of proteins
  indicated in A: ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase family 2 member mitochondrial; KatE,
  catalase. Definition of proteins indicated in B: GRP, gibberellin regulated protein;
  AHP, histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein; NPR1, regulatory protein NPR1;
  PR-1, pathogenesis-related protein 1. The dotted line means many steps of process;
  The double line means cytomembrane; +u means ubiquitination; +p means Phosphorylation;
  Vertical lines mean dissociation; The dotted line with a circle means chemical molecule
  undergoing several steps to combine with next substance.'
