caption: Different types of autophagy. (A) CMA. Proteins degraded by CMA are identified
  in the cytosol by HSC70/cochaperons complexes. Upon binding to the KFERQ motif,
  HSC70/cochaperons complexes bring them to the surface of lysosomes and bind to the
  receptor protein LAMP2A, which in turn promotes LAMP2A multimerization to form a
  translocation complex within the help of Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Upon unfolding,
  substrate proteins cross the lysosomal membrane and undergo complete degradation.
  (B) Macroautophagy. Efficient macroautophagy involves the sequestration of cellular
  material, the formation of autophagosomes, their fusion with lysosomes, and lysosomal
  degradation of the autophagolysosomal content. An unidentified membrane source delivers
  lipid bi-layers for the formation of preautophagosomal membranes, the so-called
  'nucleation process', which recruits the PtdIns3P Class III complex consisting of
  at least BECN1, VPS34, ATG14 or UVRAG. Besides, two ubiquitin-like ATG conjugation
  systems are activated to allow for autophagosomes formation and cytosolic cargo
  incorporation (either specifically via receptors or nonspecifically). For instance,
  the ATG12-ATG5:ATG16L1 complex conjugates phosphoethanolamine to LC3 to form lapidated
  LC3 (LC3-II), which may promote substrate uptake upon binding to different receptors,
  such as p62. After the completed autophagosomes have enclosed substrates, they can
  fuse with endosomes or lysosomes to form amphisomes or autolysosomes, the molecular
  machinery of which is shared with the endocytic pathway. Finally the inner content
  gets released into the lysosome/autolysosome and is being degraded by lysosomal
  hydrolases. (C) Microautophagy and Endosomal microautophagy. Endosomes engulf cytosolic
  materials within multivesicular bodies that contain other cytosolic components,
  and degrade these materials when fusion with lysosomes. The endosomal invagination
  relies on the ESCRT systems. Microautophagy can also selectivity degrade proteins
  bearing the KFERQ motif. Those KFERQ-containing cargos are targeted by HSC70 and
  unlike CMA, delivered to lysosome or endosome through the binding of HSC70 to endosomal
  membrane phosphatidylserines, independent of LAMP2A.
