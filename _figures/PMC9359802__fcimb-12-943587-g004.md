caption: Proposed model of RNA Pol III-dependent activation of anti-VZV innate immune
  responses in lung epithelial cells. VZV DNA can be detected in the cytoplasm by
  cytosolic Pol III leading to activation of MAVS-dependent RIG-I pathway and TLR-3
  pathway, which are also engaged by transcription of ncRNAs by cytosolic Pol III.
  Activation of these pathways results in translocation of NF-KB into the nucleus
  leading to interferon (IFN) response and activation of interferon-stimulated genes
  (ISG) RNase L and PKR in the initial host response against VZV infection. Figure
