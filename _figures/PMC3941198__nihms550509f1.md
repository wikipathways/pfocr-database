caption: 'The immediate precursors of milk lipids are CLD. These organelle-like structures,
  which originate from specific ER domains, are composed of a TAG core that is surrounded
  by a phospholipid monolayer and coated with functionally specialized proteins. Perilipin
  2 (PLIN2, indicated by the red dashed line surrounding the TAG core) is the most
  abundant CLD-associated protein in milk-secreting cells. By inhibiting adipose triglyceride
  lipase (ATGL)-mediated lipolysis of TAG to fatty acids (FA) and diacylglycerol (DAG),
  PLIN2 plays an essential role in stabilizing CLD. The TAG core is synthesized by
  sequential FA acylation of glycerol by four ER membrane-associated enzymes. The
  first step in TAG synthesis, the addition of FA to glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P)
  to form LPA, is specifically catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate-O-acyltransferase-4
  (GPAT4). Loss of GPAT4 prevents milk lipid formation and lactation. The addition
  of FA to LPA to form PA is catalyzed by, as yet undefined, members of the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate-O-acyltransferase
  (AGPAT) family. Lipin1 catalyzes the removal of the phosphate group from PA to form
  DAG. The final step in TAG synthesis, the addition of FA to DAG, is specifically
  catalyzed by diacylglcyerol-O-acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1). Loss of DGAT1 prevents
  milk lipid formation and lactation. Inset: The FA substrates for synthesis of milk
  lipids are derived from the diet, by mobilization from adipose stores or by de novo
  synthesis from glucose. Protein kinase-B1 (AKT1) regulates the de novo synthesis
  pathway, and disruption of its functions is associated with abnormalities in milk
  lipid production.'
