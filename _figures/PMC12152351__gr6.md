caption: 'Diagram illustrating the role of miR-1236-3p in modulating the functions
  of Mtb-infected macrophagesLeft: Mtb recognition by TLR4 triggers the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, which promotes macrophage-mediated immune killing, effectively suppressing
  Mtb survival during initial infection. Right: miR-1236-3p targets TLR4 to downregulate
  the TLR4-mediated downstream NF-κB signaling pathway and reduce the production of
  antibacterial factors including NO and ROS, facilitating the survival of Mtb in
  Macrophages'
