caption: 'Regulation of cardiac hypertrophy by AKAP complexes. A: mAKAP assembles
  a multienzyme signaling complex at the outer nuclear membrane containing AC5, PKA,
  PDE4D3, PP2A, RyR2, calcineurin Aβ (CaNAβ), nuclear factor of activated T cells
  3 (NFATc3), exchange protein activated by cAMP 1 (Epac1), and ERK5. Activation of
  AC5 by β-adrenergic stimulation generates cAMP, which in turn activates anchored
  PKA at submicromolar concentrations. In a negative feedback loop, activated PKA
  phosphorylates PDE4D3, leading to its activation and increased cAMP degradation,
  and AC5, leading to its inactivation and decreased cAMP synthesis. Anchored PKA
  also regulates the activity of PP2A, which promotes PDE4D3 dephosphorylation, and
  RyR2, which enhances Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. This is proposed
  to induce the activation of CaNAβ, which, in turn, dephosphorylates and activates
  NFATc3 to promote hypertrophic gene transcription. Very high concentrations of cAMP
  (in μM) also stimulate Epac1. This in turn activates the GTPase Ras-related protein
  1 (Rap1), which exerts an inhibitory effect on the MEK5-ERK5 pathway. In the absence
  of very high local cAMP, Epac1 is inactivated and the hypertrophic ERK5 pathway
  de-repressed. Stimulation of endothelin-1 receptors (ET1Rs) activates mAKAPβ-bound
  PLCε, which, in turn, promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via a signaling pathway
  that remains to be elucidated. B: activated α1-ARs and ET1Rs stimulate the Rho-guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of AKAP-lymphoid blast crisis (AKAP-Lbc)
  through Gα12. GTP-bound RhoA is released from the AKAP-Lbc complex and promotes
  cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via a signaling pathway that remains to be elucidated.
  Activation AKAP-Lbc-anchored PKA promotes the phosphorylation of the anchoring protein
  on serine-1565. This induces the recruitment of 14-3-3, which inhibits the Rho-GEF
  activity of AKAP-Lbc. AKAP-Lbc also recruits PKCη and PKD. Upon stimulation by the
  Gαq-phospholipase C pathway by α1-ARs and ET1Rs, PKCη becomes activated and phosphorylates
  PKD. Active PKD phosphorylates histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), causing its export
  form the nucleus. This favors myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor 2 (MEF2)-dependent
  hypertrophic gene transcription. LIF-R, leukemia inhibitor factor receptor; IP3,
  inositol trisphosphate 1,4,5-trisphosphate.'
