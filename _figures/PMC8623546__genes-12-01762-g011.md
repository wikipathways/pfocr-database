caption: 'Role of NIMA related kinase 8 (Nek8) in the DNA Damage Response (DDR): ATR
  mediates one of the DDR pathways. Aberrations in ciliary protein Nek8 directly controls
  the activity of cyclin A kinase. Nek8 facilitates Rad51 foci formation and replication
  fork protection upon DNA damage, thereby protecting the kidney from DNA damage related
  injury and hypoxia. It also indirectly regulates the Ataxia Telangiectasia And Rad3-Related
  Protein (ATR)- Checkpoint Kinase 1 (Chk1) pathway, thus, having an overarching role
  in limiting DNA damage in response to replication stress (Modified and redrawn using
  BioRender.com [,]).'
