caption: 'Nrf2 regulation. Nrf2 is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that is
  bound to KEAP1 under physiological condition. KEAP1 is an intracellular redox sensor
  and targets Nrf2 for ubiquitination. Following oxidative stress, four different
  mechanisms result in dissociation of KEAP1 from Nrf2. These four mechanisms are
  as displayed in order: (1) oxidation of cysteine residues by lower molecular weight
  reactive oxygen species, (2) covalent modification of cysteine residues by electrophiles
  such as NF-κB-induced cyclopentenone prostaglandins, (3) phosphorylation of Nrf2
  at Ser40 by protein kinase C and PERK, and (4) protein-protein interaction between
  p62 and KEAP1. Free of KEAP1, Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus where it binds
  to antioxidant response elements in DNA to mediate transcription of key proteins.
  Nrf2 requires the binding partners MAF and CBP to initiate transcription. BACH1
  competes for MAF and NF-κB competes for CBP. Overall, the equilibrium between the
  two transcriptions factors BACH1 and Nrf2 determines overall transcription of the
  downstream genes.'
