caption: The Ca2+signaling pathway and the roles of CD38, Ca2+ channels, and G-protein-coupled
  receptors. In the Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway, PLCb generates IP3 that binds
  to its receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane and induces Ca2+i release.
  Ca2+i activates calmodulin and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) to induce actin-myosin
  cross-bridge cycling and subsequently smooth muscle spasm. CD38 expression evokes
  the generation of cyclic ADP-ribose, which binds to the ryanodine receptor and stimulates
  the SR to release Ca2+i. SERCA refills the SR with cytosolic Ca2+i and inhibits
  smooth muscle spasm. The Ca2+-independent pathway is mediated by RhoA and ROCK,
  which phosphorylate and inactivate MYTP1, leading to airway smooth muscle spasm
