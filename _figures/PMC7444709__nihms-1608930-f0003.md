caption: Possible differences in the mechanisms of activation of homotetrameric TRPC4
  channel (A) from TRPC1-TRPC4 heterotetrameric channels (B) in response to coincident
  Gq/11 and Gi/osignaling. For homomeric TRPC4, the Gq/11-PLCβ pathway mainly serves
  to initiate the self-propagating and H+- and Ca2+-dependent positive feedback activation
  of PLCδ1, and the channel opening requires coincident Gi/o input (A). For heteromeric
  TRPC1-C4 channels, Gαq/11-GTP might exert a direct stimulatory effect through TRPC1
  , which might obliviate the requirement for PLCδ1 and/or Gi/o (B). However, these
  possibilities have not been directly tested. C. Physiological and pathophysiological
  functions demonstrated to require TRPC4 based on studies using Trpc4 knockout mice.
  Among them, gastrointestinal motility and bladder detrusor contraction regulations
  are cholinergic and require M2 (Gi/o-coupled) and M3 (Gq/11-coupled) muscarinic
  receptors ,,. Lung vascular permeability regulation  likely requires both Gq/11
  and Gi/o when it is induced via thrombin receptors. The depolarizing plateau that
  underlies epileptiform burst firing and neurodegeneration of lateral septal neurons,
  is triggered by stimulating group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors ,, but the
  response is inhibited by pertussis toxin (unpublished). For fear related-behavior
  and serotonergic itch, only Gq/11signaling has been suggested ,; however, no report
  has ruled out the involvement of Gi/osignaling at this point.
