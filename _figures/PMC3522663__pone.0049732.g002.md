caption: This model was derived from the neuroarchitecture and neurophysiology of
  the relevant parts of the nigro-striatal motor pathway. We consider the D1-mediated
  direct pathway, the D2 mediated indirect pathway, and a pathway with both D1 and
  D2 receptors. We combine this with the effect of thalamic excitation on the supplementary
  motor area using a multi-compartment model of the pyramidal neuron . Pharmacological
  agents can affect the model in many different ways. SNr = substantia migra pars
  reticulata. SNc = substantia nigra pars compacta.
