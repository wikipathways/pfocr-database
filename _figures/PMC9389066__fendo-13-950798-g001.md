caption: 'NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. It is known that the activation of
  NLRP3 is divided into two key steps: priming and activation. Signal 1 (priming;
  left): When pathogens and their products, injury, stress, and other signals stimulate
  cells, TLR, TNFR, and other receptors can be activated. NF-κB is activated through
  different pathways, which in turn promotes NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18. Provide
  a material basis for the activation and function of NLRP3 inflammasome. Signal 2
  (activation; right): Multiple upstream signaling events are activated by PAMPs and
  DAMPs. These include K+ efflux, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, etc. Inflammasome
  formation activates caspase-1, which cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Gasdermin
  is also cleaved and inserted into membranes, forming pores and inducing pyroptosis.'
