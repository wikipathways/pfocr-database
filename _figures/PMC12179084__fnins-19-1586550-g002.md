caption: Key signalling pathways implicated in macrocephalic ASD. The PI3K/AKT pathway
  is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), activating PI3K which converts
  PIP2 to PIP3. PTEN antagonises this by reversing the conversion. PIP3 leads to downstream
  activation of AKT, which then regulates the mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. RTKs
  also activate the RAS/MAPK pathway, ultimately leading to activation of ERK which
  also regulates mTOR. The canonical Wnt signalling pathway involves the binding of
  Wnt to the receptor Frizzled, resulting in inhibition of the β-catenin destruction
  complex, which includes GSK3, and hence Wnt binding activates β-catenin activity.
  All pathways play important downstream roles in cell functions such as proliferation,
  differentiation, and survival. Epigenetic modifiers also regulate transcription
  of these pathways, acting via DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), histone lysine methyltransferases
  (KMT), histone lysine demethyltransferases (KDM), and chromatin remodelers (e.g.,
  CDH8)
