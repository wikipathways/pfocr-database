caption: Proposed model for SlGRAS4‐dependent regulation of chilling injury tolerance
  in tomato. Our study uncovers a SlGRAS4‐regulated pathway underlying chilling injury
  tolerance. Deciphering the mechanism of this new pathway revealed that SlGRAS4 forms
  a homodimer that activates its own expression. SlGRAS4 is able to bind and activate
  the promoters of target genes involved in antioxidant capacity, calcium signalling,
  photosynthesis ability and energy metabolism. In this way, SlGRAS4 seems to operate
  independently of the ‘ICE1/CBF’ regulon. SlGRAS4 can also directly regulate SlCBF1,
  SlCBF2 and SlCBF3 expression by binding to their promoters. Therefore, the up‐regulation
  of SlCBFs may contribute to the higher chilling tolerance of SlGRAS4‐overexpressing
  lines. We provide a mechanism that SlGRAS4 positively regulates chilling injury
  resistance in tomato mainly by increasing antioxidant capacity and at least partially
  by CBF pathway.
