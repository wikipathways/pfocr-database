caption: Co-expression network and candidate eQTLs associated with lignin and cellulose
  structural genes of pear. a Genes in the lignin biosynthesis pathway in pear, adapted
  from Humphreys and Chapple (2002) []. b Genes in the cellulose biosynthesis pathway
  in pear, adapted from Balaji et al. (2017) []. Black arrows and blue shadows indicate
  key reaction steps. Genes in orange indicate enzymes in the pathways. Round boxes
  next to the enzymes contain the numbers of core pathway genes. c Co-expression network
  of the lignin and cellulose biosynthesis. The outer ring of the network represents
  structural genes implicated in lignin and cellulose synthesis (circles), while inside
  are TFs (rhombus). Nodes are labeled with gene names colored based on the edge number.
  TFs and pathway genes are connected via undirected edges. Internal connections among
  TFs and among pathway genes were not shown for clarity. Detailed IDs, names, and
  connection information for all genes in the network can be found in Additional files  and
  . d Combined Manhattan plots of eQTLs of genes associated with lignin and cellulose
  biosynthesis. The red horizontal line depicts the significance threshold (P = 1.99
  × 10−12). All significant SNP signals in local and distant eQTLs were combined.
  Genes in black indicate those located in local eQTLs, while genes in red indicate
  those located in distant eQTLs. A full list of gene names is provided in Additional
  file . e Circle Manhattan plot for chromosome 6 from the eQTL results of Pbr4CL4,
  PbrLAC4, PbrLAC5, PbrCESA4a, PbrCESA7a, PbrCESA8b, and PbrMYB169. The plot was constructed
  using the “CMplot” package in R software. The red circular dotted line depicts the
  significance threshold (P = 1.99 × 10−12). The signal points highlighted in red
  indicated the locus of PbrNSC
