caption: 'O-glycans are synthesized in a step-wise manner, beginning with the attachment
  of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to the oxygen atom of serine (Ser) or threonine
  (Thr) that is catalyzed by GalNAc-transferases. This step can be followed by addition
  of galactose (Gal) (catalyzed by C1GalT1; chaperone Cosmc is required for production
  of active C1GalT1 enzyme). Sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) can be added to
  each glycan by different enzymes, ST3Gal-1 for sialylation of Gal and ST6GalNAc-II
  for sialylation of GalNAc. Sialylation of terminal GalNAc (i.e., without Gal) prevents
  subsequent addition of Gal. Pathway is proposed based on published primary data
  and reviews ,,,,,–. Color coding is per Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans: yellow-filled
  square, GalNAc; yellow-filled circle, Gal; purple-filled diamond, N-acetylneuraminic
  acid.'
