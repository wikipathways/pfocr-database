caption: 'Reconstruction of the flavonoid synthesis pathway in D. huoshanense through
  joint analysis of structural genes and metabolites under stress conditions. The
  coding genes indicated by gene symbols are described as follows: PTAL, phenylalanine/tyrosine
  ammonia-lyase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; CYP73A, trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase;
  CHS, chalcone synthase; E5.5.1, chalcone isomerase; HIDH, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone
  dehydratase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; CYP75A,
  flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; CYP75B1, flavonoid 3′-monooxygenase; CYP81E, isoflavone/4′-methoxyisoflavanone
  2′-hydroxylase; F3H, flavonoid 3-hydroxylase; and FLS, flavonol synthase'
