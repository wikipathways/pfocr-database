caption: 'm6A methylases that participate in ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a form of
  cell death characterized by an accumulation of Fe2+ ions and lipid peroxide overload.
  The mechanism of ferroptosis is as follows: i) Iron ions are inputted into the cells,
  converted into divalent iron and accumulate in large amounts, promoting the occurrence
  of lipid peroxidation through the Fenton reaction; ii) the systemXc-system (SLC3A2+SLC7A11)
  is presented: The SystemXc−-GSH-GPX4 axis, wherein GPX4 inhibits lipid peroxidation;
  iii) SLC38A1+SLC1A5: Glutamine enters the cell through glutamine transporters to
  generate glutamate, which enters the mitochondria and participates in the TCA cycle
  to generate mitochondrial ROS, thereby promoting ferroptosis. m6A-associated enzymes
  can participate in the ferroptotic pathway of tumors, thereby regulating tumor progression.
  METTL3 inhibits ferroptosis by enhancing the stability of SLC7A11 mRNA through YTHDF1
  and IGF2BP2, respectively. METTL14, FTO, YTHDF2 and YTHDC2 inhibit SLC7A11, thereby
  inducing ferroptosis. YTHDC2 can also increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to
  ferroptosis by inhibiting SLC3A2. Finally, ALKBH5 induces ferroptosis by mediating
  the m6A-TIAM1-Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thereby hindering tumor progression.
