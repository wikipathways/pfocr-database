caption: Interactions between the Ethylene Signal Transduction Pathway and Plant Disease
  Resistance.The ethylene signal transduction pathway can interact with the JA pathway
  to co-regulate expression of a subset of defense-related PR genes, for example,
  PDF1.2, involved in plant disease resistance. Meanwhile, there are considerable
  interactions between JA/ethylene- and SA-dependent pathways in systemic acquired
  resistance. In edr1 mutant, ethylene potentiates SA-mediated PR-1 gene expression.
  In the absence of CPR5 and CPR6, the ethylene pathway can also activate SA-dependent
  PR-1 gene expression independent of NPR1 to promote systemic acquired resistance.
  In the ssi1 mutant, the JA/ethylene-dependent PDF1.2 gene is constitutively expressed.
  Moreover, the ethylene pathway is also required for the rhizobacteria-mediated induced
  systemic resistance, which is independent of SA and pathogenesis-related gene activation.
  Ethylene signaling acts downstream of the JA pathway but upstream of NPR1 in ISR
  activation. Plants that lack ISR1 fail to develop ISR and display ethylene insensitivity.
  Arrows indicate positive regulation, and open blocks indicate negative regulation.
