caption: An illustrative representation and overview of PINK1, Parkin, and related
  molecules in the regulatory pathway for mitophagy. Under the healthy and steady
  state of cells, PINK1 is despoiled within the surface of mitochondria, which may
  be reduced by mitochondrial damage due to oxidative stress and/or redox imbalance,
  resulting in PINK1 and Parkin increases in the outer membrane of mitochondria. Mainly,
  the PINK1 could phosphorylate ubiquitin to activate the ubiquitin ligase activity
  for Parkin, where the Parkin is expected to be phosphorylated and ubiquitinated,
  resulting in the induction of mitophagy. OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; IMM,
  inner mitochondrial membrane; MARK2, microtubule affinity regulating kinase 2; MFN1,
  mitofusin 1; MFN2, mitofusin 2; NDP52, nuclear dot protein 52; PARL, presenilin-associated
  rhomboid-like; OPTN, optineurin; PINK1, PTEN-induced kinase 1; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; VDAC1, voltage-dependent anion channel 1; Ub, ubiquitin
