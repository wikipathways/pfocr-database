caption: YAP/TAZ activity is tightly regulated via Hippo signaling. YAP/TAZ subcellular
  localization and transcriptional co-activator activity in specific contexts are
  mainly regulated by phosphorylation events. When core Hippo signaling are activated,
  YAP/TAZ are phosphorylated and promoted to be degradation in cytoplasmic, whereas
  an inactive Hippo kinase cascade could result in the transportation of YAP/TAZ from
  cytoplasm to the nucleus and the nuclear accumulation of YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ act as
  prominent links in the Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway and integrators of several
  other signal pathways
