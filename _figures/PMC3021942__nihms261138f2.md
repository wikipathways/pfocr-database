caption: Current working model of convergent pathways to PMF. The “Q” pathway (left,
  black arrows) is elicited by intermittent activation of Gq-coupled metabotropic
  receptors (e.g. 5-HT2 or α1). Subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC) initiates
  new BDNF synthesis and increases NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity. BDNF activates TrkB
  and then ERK MAP kinases (pERK). Protein phosphatases (PP2/5) normally constrain
  pLTF, but are regulated via NADPH oxidase (NOX) dependent ROS formation. The “S”
  pathway (right; white arrows) is elicited by Gs-coupled metabotropic receptors (eg.
  5-HT7 and A2A) coupled to protein kinase A (PKA). PKA may induce new synthesis of
  an immature TrkB isoform, which auto-phosphorylates and signals from inside the
  cell via Akt activation (pAkt). We postulate that both pERK and pAkt phosphorylate
  glutamate receptors, thereby giving rise to greater synaptic strength and PMF. We
  cannot rule out changes in motor neuron excitability as a cause of PMF, for example
  via membrane insertion of ion channels.
