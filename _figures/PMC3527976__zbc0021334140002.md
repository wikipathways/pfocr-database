caption: Two rapamycin-sensitive myogenic mTOR signaling pathways. A kinase-independent
  mTOR pathway controls IGF2 expression through transcriptional regulation at a muscle-specific
  enhancer, as well as through suppression of miR-125b, which targets Igf2. IGF2 regulates
  myogenesis by activating the IGF1 receptor (IGF-IR) and PI3K/Akt signaling. A kinase-dependent
  mTOR pathway regulates myocyte fusion and myotube/myofiber maturation by controlling
  follistatin expression via a MyoD/miR-1/HDAC4 pathway. Amino acid signals are most
  likely upstream of the IGF2 pathway, but their role in the follistatin pathway is
  not clear.
