caption: 'EGF decreases sphingolipid biosynthesis transcripts. A: sphingolipid metabolism.
  This pathway was constructed based on the sphingolipid metabolism pathway in the
  KEGG database and figures in Refs.  and  and was drawn using ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0
  (CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, MA). The initial condensation, catalyzed by SPTLC, is
  also the rate-limiting step for de novo synthesis, forming 3-ketodihydro-sphingosine
  (). This product is then rapidly reduced to sphinganine, which is then acylated
  by a member of the LASS family of enzymes to form dihydroceramide. LASS3 is the
  most relevant isozyme for ceramides of the epidermal barrier due to its fatty acyl-CoA
  chain length specificity (). Dihydroceramide is then desaturated by DEGS1/2 or hydroxylated
  by DEGS2 (exclusively), to form ceramides and phytoceramides, respectively. Ceramides
  Cer5(AS) and Cer2(NS) may also be formed via the Salvage Pathway by LASS acylation
  of sphingosine already present in the cell. These reactions occur in the endoplasmic
  reticulum. At this point, the pool of newly formed ceramides and phytoceramides
  are trafficked to the Golgi apparatus. UGCG glycosylates all ceramides and phytoceramides
  to form glucosylceramides. SGMS catalyzes the addition of choline phosphate (from
  phosphatidylcholine) to Cer5 and Cer2 to form sphingomyelin. These 2 products (glucosylceramides
  and sphingomyelin) are packaged into the lamellar bodies, which are extruded at
