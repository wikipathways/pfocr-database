caption: 'has two components: a and b. a Shows the molecular pathway for nitric oxide
  (NO) synthesis and shows that genetic variants in GCH1 and eNOS lead to adverse
  outcomes after stroke. ✢ placed to clarify that the GCH1 variant led to death after
  IS but was not associated with a functional outcome metric. b Shows pathway for
  angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) agonism which is augmented by an angiotensin
  converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism and leads to worse poststroke recovery'
