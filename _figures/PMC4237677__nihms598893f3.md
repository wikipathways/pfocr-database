caption: Expanded microsatellite repeats have been traditionally classified as either
  coding disorders or non-coding disorders that give rise to protein gain- or loss-of-function
  or RNA toxicity mechanisms. For traditional “coding” disorders, the repeat expansion
  is translated as part of a larger open-reading frame (ORF) and results in the expression
  of a mutant protein that disrupts normal cellular function and induces toxicity.
  For example Huntington’s disease (HD), a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder,
  is caused by a CAG expansion within the first exon of huntingtin gene that is translated
  as a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein, HTT []. For traditional “non-coding”
  disorders (blue), the repeat expansion remains in the RNA transcript, accumulates
  as RNA foci that sequester RNA-binding proteins and lead to a loss of their normal
  function. For example, in myotonic dystrophy, CUG(G) expanded RNA transcripts sequester
  MBNL proteins from their normal splicing targets leading to a MBNL loss-of-function
  and alternative splicing dysregulation [, –]. The recent discovery of repeat associated
  non-ATG (RAN) translation [] adds a third pathway for disease. RNA transcripts from
  both “non-coding” and “coding” disorders may undergo RAN translation. Once in the
  cytoplasm, these transcripts are capable of producing proteins in all three reading
  frames, which may contribute to cellular toxicity/stress. Depending upon the flanking
  sequences, each of these RAN proteins will have a distinct expanded peptide repeats
  (colored boxes) and unique different C-terminal regions (f1, f2 and f3). If the
  repeat is also within an ATG-initiated open-reading frame, this ATG-initiated protein
  will share the expanded peptide repeat and C-terminal region with one of the RAN
  proteins but will have an additional N-terminal region. Further complexity is added
  by fact that many expansion mutations are bidirectionally transcribed [], which
  doubles the number of distinct RAN proteins that may be produced. While individual
  RAN proteins have been observed in SCA8[],DM1[] and FXTAS[] patients, sense and
  antisense RNA foci and RAN proteins in all six reading frames been shown to accumulate
  in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD patient cells [–, –].
