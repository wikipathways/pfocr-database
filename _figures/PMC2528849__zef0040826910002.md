caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the canonical insulin signaling pathway. The
  insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylates itself as well as IRS. PI3 kinase (PI3K) phosphorylates
  3-phosphoinositides, which produce binding sites for PIP3 dependent kinase (PDK)
  and Akt via their PH domains. Akt is phosphorylated by PDK and mTOR-Rictor, which
  lead to active Akt kinase activity and its pleiotropic effects. P denotes key phosphorylation
  events.
