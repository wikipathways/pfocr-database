caption: Regulation of BK-β1 expression by NFATc3 signaling. Calcineurin is a Ca2+/calmodulin
  (CaM)-activated phosphatase. In the membranes of vascular SMCs, AKAP150 proteins
  anchor calcineurin (CaN) with PKA and L-type Ca2+ channels (Cav1.2) to form dynamic
  Ca2+signaling complexes. L-type Ca2+ channel activity is upregulated by PKA, which
  increases Ca2+ influx. Upon Ca2+ binding to calmodulin, calcineurin is activated,
  which then dephosphorylates NFATc3 and promotes NFATc3 nuclear translocation, inhibiting
  BK-β1 mRNA expression. In DM, the activity of the AKAP150-NFATc3 signaling pathway
  is upregulated, resulting in enhanced suppression of BK-β1 expression and impaired
  BK channel function in vascular SMCs. The symbol “p” represents protein phosphorylation.
