caption: Metabolism supports energy homeostasis and biosynthesis. Cellular metabolism
  can be configured to efficiently generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP). Glucose is metabolised by glycolysis to pyruvate (generating 2 ATP), which
  in turn can be used to fuel oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Pyruvate is converted
  to Acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria, which fuels metabolic cycles to generate the
  reducing equivalents NADH and FADH2 (not shown) to drive OXPHOS (generating > 30
  ATP). Fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria through a process called β-oxidation
  that yields acetyl-CoA. Glutamine can also be a fuel for mitochondrial OXPHOS. In
  addition to fuelling ATP synthesis, glucose and glutamine can also be metabolised
  and used to support biosynthetic processes. Metabolic intermediates can be diverted
  into pathways to generate biosynthetic precursors important for the synthesis of
  lipids, nucleotides and proteins. Glucose can also be diverted into the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) which is important for nucleotide synthesis and the generation
  of NADPH. NADPH is an important cofactor for biosynthetic pathways and for the reduction
  of glutathione, which quenches reactive oxygen species thus supporting redox balance
