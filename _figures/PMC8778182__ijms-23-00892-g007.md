caption: NGF induces a minor increase in Ca2+- and SNARE-dependent CGRP release, whereas
  it greatly enhances the CAP-evoked exocytosis which is blocked by BoNT/A and/EA
  at low [CAP] but only abolished by BoNT/EA at higher [CAP]. (A) Illustrates the
  effect of acute NGF on CGRP exocytosis from control neonatal rat TGNs starved of
  the neurotrophin for 2 days, and (B) in TGNs pre-treated with BoNT/A or /EA. (A)
  NGF binds to its receptor TrkA, activates the signalling cascades shown [], and
  induces Ca2+ influx by an unidentified mechanism (?). Elevated intracellular Ca2+
  ([Ca2+]i) triggers the fusion of large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) via SNARE-complexes
  (VAMP, syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25), thereby, causing exocytotic release of CGRP and
  surface delivery of vesicle constituents. This acute potentiation by NGF can involve
  the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase—Src (PI3K-Src) pathway, which promotes trafficking
  of LDCVs, and insertion of their TRPV1 channels into the plasmalemma by Ca2+-regulated
  exocytosis (blue arrows) c.f. [,]. Additionally, the phospholipase C γ (PLCγ) cascade
  leads to sensitisation of TRPV1 already on the plasmalemma (red dashed arrows) [].
  The outcome of these composite influences of NGF on TRPV1 is that when the channel
  is activated by CAP [Ca2+]I is raised even more than normally [,,] and this further
  enhances CGRP release (). (B) The proteases of BoNT/A and/EA delete 9 (purple arrow)
  and 26 (green arrow) residues from SNAP-25 (Insert), respectively, preventing the
  fusion of LDCVs; this blocks the minimal CGRP exocytosis elicited by NGF (arrow
  with crosses, left) and its enhancement of the release evoked by 20 nM CAP () (arrow
  with crosses, centre). Stronger stimulation of TRPV1 with 1 µM CAP () induces a
  lot more Ca2+ influx ([Ca2+]i, ([Ca2+]i, ([Ca2+]i; ) which causes a moderate increase
  in CGRP release but overcomes the inhibition by BoNT/A (purple cross with broken
  lines, right) while/EA (green cross, right) remains effective in diminishing CGRP
  release. Acute sensitisation by NGF of TRPV1 selectively enhances neuropeptide exocytosis
  stimulated by low [CAP] (<100 nM) and only moderately affects responses to ≥100
  nM CAP (B). Despite being impotent against 1 µM CAP-evoked CGRP release in starved
  cells ((B),, and G), BoNT/A partially inhibits the moderate NGF-enhancement of 1
  µM CAP-evoked CGRP release (G), implicating membrane trafficking in the sensitisation
  process (B, PI3K-Src stimulated pathway) in accordance with its inhibition of NGF-induced,
  Ca2+-dependent CGRP exocytosis (E).
