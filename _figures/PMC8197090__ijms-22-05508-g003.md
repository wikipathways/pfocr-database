caption: Regulation of LR development by various hormones and their crosstalk. Auxin
  via SLR4/ARF7-ARF9 signalling module promotes LR development. Auxin-induced expression
  of PRH1 is dependent on ARF7 and LBD29. PRH1 may promote LR development by regulating
  the expression of EXP genes that promote cell wall loosening. SLR4/ARF7-ARF9 signalling
  module also activates the expression of LBD16/ASL18 that are involved in the symmetry
  breaking of LR founder cells for LR initiation and primordium development. JA positively
  regulates lateral root formation by modulating auxin biosynthesis and homeostasis.
  JA induces the expression of ASA1 both through COI1 and ERF109. ERF109 also induces
  the expression of another auxin biosynthetic gene, YUC9. BR regulates lateral root
  development by interacting with auxin. At low concentration, BR modulates auxin
  transport and promotes lateral root development. CK negatively regulates LR initiation
  and development by inhibiting auxin carriers. Solid black arrows indicate confirmed
  pathway. Dotted arrow indicates pathways for which there is little or no evidence.

    CK negatively regulates LR initiation and development by inhibiting auxin carriers.
