caption: Relative Innate and Adaptive Immune Mechanisms in HLH Spectrum Pathology.Immunodeficiency
  State (Primary HLH) Vs Immunocompetency State (MAS/sHLH.COVID-19 Immunodeficiency
  State Vs Immunocompetency State.The HLH responses can occur in the setting of both
  immunodeficiency states and in immunocompetence settings and following adaptive
  immune system engineering (Panel A and B in blue). In humans with defects in NK
  and CD8+ T-cells, the inability to kill virally infected cells results in primary
  HLH with hyper-cytokinaemia that can't be cured with anti-cytokine strategies as
  genetic defect typically in perforin pathway machinery makes pathogen elimination
  impossible [] (Panel A). In CAR-T cell therapy hyper proliferating engineered T-cells
  may drive MAS/sHLH that only lasts for the duration of the presence of detectable
  tumour antigen (Panel B). Similar mechanisms may occur in sJIA or autoimmune diseases,
  but this remains to be fully defined. This model is based on the immunological disease
  continuum modified for gain or loss of function in innate or adaptive immunity (Reference
  ).When COVID-19 hyper-inflammatory or cytokine storm reactions are viewed through
  the lens of primary and secondary HLH, it is noteworthy that virally induced immunosuppression
  may play a key role (Panel C). Coronavirus family members including COVID-19 pneumonia
  is associated with robust interferon suppression, blood lymphopenia including NK
  cell abnormalities. Such scenarios likely drive macrophage infiltration and the
  “second wave” of non-type-1 interferon pathway cytokines including IL-6, IL-1, IL-18,
  INFγ, GM-CSF and others that lead to a blood hyper-cytokinaemic picture (Panel B).
  It remains to be seen how many cases of COVID-19 related fatalities have mutations
  in genes associated with the primary HLH disorders and thus closely resemble primary
  HLH (Panel A). Based on persistent viral shedding from the respiratory tract during
  CORVID-19 related disease, then an exaggerated immune response including IFN driven
  and T-cell driven responses that clears the virus but induces pulmonary immune system
  collateral damage and ARDS offers an explanation for the more typical MAS/sHLH phenotype.
  Viral clearance in the face of marked hyper-inflammation would be expected in the
  face of brisk anti-viral antigen responses.
