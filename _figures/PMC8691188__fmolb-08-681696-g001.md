caption: 'Model scheme. Pink box: The scheme for the CRTC1-SIK1 pathway in the SCN.
  We assumed four states for both CREB and CRTC1, which are denoted by CREBC (cytoplasmic
  CREB), CREBPC (phosphorylated CREB in cytoplasm), CREBN (nuclear CREB), CREBPN (phosphorylated
  CREB in nucleus), CRTC1C (cytoplasmic CRTC1), CRTC1PC (phosphorylated CRTC1 in cytoplasm),
  CRTC1N (nuclear CRTC1), and CRTC1PN (phosphorylated CREB in nucleus). CC represents
  the nuclear CREB/CRTC1 complex. Blue box: The regulatory circuit of the mammalian
  circadian clock, in which Per1 and Per2 are upregulated by the CRTC1-SIK1 pathway
  via the nuclear CREB/CRTC1 complex. This regulatory circuit is adapted from the
  schematic diagram of the circadian model in the reference ().'
