caption: Several metabolic pathways are rewired during chronic lung disease. While
  this response exists to clear invading pathogens and launch an inflammatory response,
  long-term activation of these pathways has negative implications. The glycolysis
  pathway supports inflammatory responses of AM, while iron and metabolites produced
  in the TCA cycle can function as bacterial substrates and contribute to pathogen
  survival. While fatty acid synthesis and oxidation is useful as a way of storing
  energy and alternative energy source during times of macrophage activation, fatty
  acid synthesis can also contribute to mucus production. Leukotrienes contribute
  to the AM pro-inflammatory phenotype but also cause bronchial constriction and contribute
  to airway remodelling in asthmatics by causing smooth muscle thickening. The amino
  acid arginine is a proliferator for collagen via ornithine and proline and can thereby
  contribute to extracellular matrix deposition.
