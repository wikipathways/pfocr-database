caption: A, schematic diagram illustrating two models that explain how 2-AG is released
  upon activation of postsynaptic neurons. In the on-demand biosynthesis model (‘on
  demand’), postsynaptic activation induces production of diacylglycerol (DG). DG
  is then converted to 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) by DG lipase α (DGLα) and 2-AG
  is released as retrograde messenger. In this model, acute pharmacological inhibition
  of DGLα is expected to block the retrograde signalling. In the pre-formed pool model
  (‘pre-formed’), 2-AG is synthesized constitutively by DGLα and stored in neurons.
  Postsynaptic activation triggers 2-AG release from the 2-AG pool to initiate retrograde
  signalling. In this model, the retrograde signalling is expected to remain intact
  under pharmacological blockade of DGLα until the presumptive 2-AG pool is depleted.
  B, molecular mechanisms of 2-AG-mediated retrograde signalling based on the on-demand
  synthesis model. Activation of Gq/11 protein-coupled receptors (Gq/11PCRs) stimulates
  PLCβ, which produces the 2-AG precursor DG. Activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel
  (VGCC) causes Ca2+ elevation, which induces DG production through an unknown pathway
  and also facilitates the Gq/11PCR–PLCβ signalling pathway. 2-AG is then produced
  from DG by DGLα and released. The released 2-AG activates presynaptic CB1 receptors,
  and suppresses the transmitter release.
