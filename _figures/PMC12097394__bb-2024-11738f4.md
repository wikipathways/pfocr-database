caption: 'Involvement of E3 ligases and DUBs in calcium handling. The influx of Ca2+
  through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, such as CaV1.2 and CaV3.2, initiates a cascade
  of events. The inward Ca2+ current activates RyR2 channels, resulting in the coordinated
  release of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+. This SR-released Ca2+ contributes significantly
  to the rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration that activates myofilaments, facilitating
  the formation of actin-myosin cross-bridges and driving myocardial contraction.
  E3 ligases, represented by green rectangles, ubiquitinate specific components in
  the pathway, while DUBs, depicted as orange rectangles, remove ubiquitin modifications
  to regulate signaling. DUB: Deubiquitinating enzyme'
