caption: 'A hypothetic model that illustrates (a) both TGF-β and p53 signalling suppress
  the ubiquitin/ATP-independent REGγ–20Sproteasome pathway via REGγ. Smad3 and p53
  proteins negatively regulate REGγ expression through recruitment of its co-repressors.
  The net output of this mechanism is to prevent the degradation of tumour suppressor
  proteins and, subsequently, inhibit cancer progression, cell proliferation and decrease
  drug resistance in cancer cells. (b) Novel GOF of mutant p53: mutant p53 exerts
  bipartite mechanism to enhance the REGγ–20S proteasome pathway in cancer cells.
  On one side, mutant p53 binds and recruits p300, a coactivator, and on another side
  block the recruitment of the Smad3/N-CoR complex formation on REGγ promoter in response
  to TGF-β. The net gain of this mechanism is to enhance the REGγ–20S proteasome pathway
  via REGγ in cancer cells to accelerate cancer progression, promote cell proliferation
  and increase drug resistance during tumour development.'
