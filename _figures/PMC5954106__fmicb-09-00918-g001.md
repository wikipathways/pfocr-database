caption: Simplified scheme of the metabolic pathways required for converting ribonucleotides
  to deoxyribonucleotides. A pathway dependent on a recently described ribothymidylate
  synthase [rTS ()], methylating UMP to free ribothymidylate (rTMP), would be counter-selected,
  as systematic methylation of structured RNAs would render them non-functional. Three
  evolutionarily related families of ribonucleotide reductases (RNR) exist that convert
  ribonucleotides (A, U, C, and G) to corresponding deoxynucleotides (not discussed
  here). Thymidylate synthases (TS) convert dUMP to dTMP. The two TS families, ThyA
  and the flavoprotein ThyX, have distinct evolutionary origins. Misincorporation
  of dUTP by DNA polymerases into the chromosome is counter-selected, as it would
  result in an increased mutagenesis rate. For details, see the main text. Incorporation
  of rTMP to tRNA and rRNA, as well as incorporation of dTMP to DNA are indicated.
  3x refers to the three homologous families of RNRs. rTDP, ribothymidine diphosphate;
  rTTP, ribothymidine triphosphate.
