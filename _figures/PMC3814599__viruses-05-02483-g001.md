caption: Schematic of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and classical nuclear import
  pathway. (top) General NPC substructures and locations of nucleoporins (NUPs) that
  scored as potential HIV-1 co-factors in genome-wide RNA interference screens [,,,].
  Asterisks denote NUPs that scored in more than one screen. (bottom) The Ran-based
  nuclear import cycle. Import protein cargo binds to a karyopherin (KPN) β protein,
  oftentimes bridged by a member of the KPN α protein family (KPN β1, which is also
  referred to as importin β1, and KPN α2 or importin α1, depicted, are canonical members
  of each protein family). KPN β1 ferries the complex through the NPC channel. The
  engagement of KPN β1 by Ran-GTP concentrated at the nuclear basket releases the
  KPN α-cargo complex into the nucleus. KPN β1 becomes free to bind additional import
  cargo after Ran dissociates from it upon RanBP1 binding and Ran-GTP hydrolysis,
  stimulated by RanGAP concentrated at the cytoplasmic filaments.
