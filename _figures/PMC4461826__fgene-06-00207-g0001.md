caption: Mammalian cells employ two principal DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair
  pathways. (A) Schematic representation of the error-free homologous recombination
  (HR) pathway. DSB resection (1), RPA coating (2), RAD51 coating (3), strand invasion
  (4), and DSB repair are illustrated (5). (B) Schematic representation of non-homologous
  end joining (NHEJ). Ku70/Ku80 binding (1), DNA-PK holo-enzyme assembly and recruitment
  of additional NHEJ factors, such as LIG4 and XRCC4 (2), as well as DSB religation
  (3) are illustrated. (C) Proposed targeting of HR-defective human cancer through
  DNA-PKcs inhibition is outlined (for details please refer to the main text).
