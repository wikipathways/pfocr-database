caption: Barluenga published the first Rh-catalyzed carbo-[3 + 2] cycloaddition of
  allenamides 467 with chromium alkenyl(methoxy)carbine complexes 468 (). Most cyclization
  reactions took place with complete chemo-, regio-, and diastereoselectivities, leading
  to a broad range of functionalized amidocyclopentenes 469 in good to excellent yields.
  A tentative reaction pathway for the cycloaddition involved the Fischer-type rhodium(I)-carbene
  complexes 470 generated via a chromium-rhodium exchange. CO appears to be critical
  in this cycloaddition, as it not only improved the efficiency of the catalytic reaction
  by favoring the transmetallation step, but also allowed almost quantitatively recovery
  of Cr(CO)6.
