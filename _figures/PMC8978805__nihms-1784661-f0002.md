caption: Cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) and COX2, which are the targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
  drugs (NSAIDs), can activate AKT, mTOR and NF-κB to support cancer cell survival
  and proliferation, either directly or via the production of prostaglandin E2(PGE2).
  PGE2 produced in a COX2-dependent manner can bind to the PGE2 receptor EP4 and induce
  intracellular signal transduction. Whereas COX2 functions to downregulate the expression
  of DNA demethylase TET1, EP4 signalling upregulates the expression of DNA (cytosine
  5)-methyltransferase 1 and/or 3B (DNMT1/3B). The altered expression of both of these
  epigenetic regulators results in silencing of tumour suppressor genes and thus promotes
  cancer initiation, which could potentially be prevented through treatment with the
  NSAID COX2 inhibitor celecoxib. PGE2-EP4 signalling can also activate a positive
  feedforward loop for tumour initiation and promotion involving upregulation of the
  transcriptional coactivator YAP1, which in turn upregulates the expression of COX
  enzymes and EP4. NSAIDs or EP4 antagonists might effectively disrupt this inflammation-driven
  process. The anticancer effects of metformin largely depend on the activation of
  AMPK, which negatively regulates downstream signalling cascades involved in cancer
  initiation. In addition, AMPK activation confers a tumour-suppressive epigenome
  via the stabilization of TET2 and/or degradation of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase
  EZH2. In an AMPK-independent fashion, metformin attenuates an NF-κB-mediated inflammatory
  response required for stem cell function and can activate a protein phosphatase
  2A (PP2A) pathway to exert control over cell survival via inhibition of the antiapoptotic
  protein MCL1. The latter mechanism is otherwise ineffective for cancer prevention
  in mice without GSK3β activation through caloric restriction. Various cytokines
  present in the inflammatory tumour microenvironment (TME), including IL-6, IL-23,
  leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand
  (RANKL), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and CXC-chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12),
  can induce pro-tumorigenic signals via cognate receptors expressed by cancer cells
  themselves. Therefore, inhibitory antibodies or other antagonists targeting these
  cytokines or their receptors might have anticancer effects. These cytokines are
  derived from distinct immune cells, including macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T (Treg) cells or stromal cells, such as pancreatic
  stellate cells (PSCs), in a context-dependent manner. For instance, IL-6 can be
  produced abundantly by macrophages in response to necrotic tumour cells and IL-1α.
  Hence, the blockade of IL-1α signalling might prevent downstream tumorigenic events.
