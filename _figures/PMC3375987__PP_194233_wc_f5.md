caption: 'Contribution of the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways
  to the accumulation of the major components of grapefruit peel essential oil. A
  color code is used to indicate the origin of structural moieties in oil constituents:
  blue, terpenoid pathway; red, phenylpropanoid pathway; orange, derived from a polyketide
  synthase. The thickness of the reaction arrows and the percentages next to them
  indicate the relative distribution of carbon flux through the different pathway
  branches. Ac, Acetyl; DMAPP, dimethyl allyl diphosphate; DOXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate;
  D-GAP, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; HMF, heptamethoxyflavone; IPP, isopentenyl
  diphosphate.'
