caption: Timeline of genes involved in gonadal development. Genes shown are known
  to play a role in sex-specific gonadal development in human and mice. Testis-related
  genes (blue) and ovary-related genes (pink) represent a regulatory pathway which
  leads to Sertoli and granulosa cell development, respectively. The orange arrows
  represent an antagonistic action. Interactions that are postulated but unproven
  are indicated with (?). The ectopic gonadal expression of Sox3 (represented by red
  dotted line) induces testis differentiation by upregulating Sox9 in a similar way
  to Sry.
