caption: 'Ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced cell cycle signaling and the relationship between
  p53 and phospho-Chk1 (Ser317). A: In cells that have p53, UVB-induced DNA damage
  activates cell cycle checkpoints through ATR activation of Chk1 and Chk2. Chk2 activates
  p53 leading to G1 arrest with subsequent DNA repair (main pathway indicated by red
  arrows). If DNA is not repaired properly, these cells undergo apoptosis. Chk1 inhibits
  Cdc25 activation of cyclin B1 and G2-M progression is prevented (G2 arrest). Our
  data demonstrate that in the presence of p53, phospho-Chk1 (Ser317) is inhibited.
  This may lead to an increase in lethal mitosis. B: In cell that lacks p53, DNA damage
  recognition signaling may be shunted to the Chk1 pathway (main pathway indicated
  by red). p53 deficient cells have elevated levels of phospho-Chk1 at serine 317
  (red arrows) and rely on their G2 checkpoint for survival. The downstream effects
  of elevated phospho-Chk1 (Ser317) are unknown.'
