caption: STAT3 pathway activation represents a focal point of tumorigenesis and immune
  escape. Aberrant STAT3 activation occurs as a result of several potential upstream
  and downstream regulatory events including growth factor receptor signaling (e.g.,
  epidermal growth factor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and c-MET)),
  inhibition of negative regulators of STAT3 (e.g., protein tyrosine phosphatases
  (PTPs), suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), and protein inhibitor of activated
  STAT 3 (PIAS3)), and microenvironmental cytokine crosstalk between immune and glioma
  cells. STAT3 activation transcriptionally upregulates key genes involved in proliferation,
  stem cell self-renewal, angiogenesis, invasiveness, and formation of the immune
  microenvironment. The balance of microenvironmental cytokines favors the infiltration
  of immunosuppressive immune cell populations, including myeloid derived suppressor
  cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs), and Tregs. These cytokines
  activate STAT3 signaling within immune cell populations to increase immunosuppressive
  macrophage polarization, decreased antigen presentation, and decreased T cell activation.
