caption: Histone Kbhb in neuropsychiatric disorders. Protective effects of BHB on
  the brain have been extensively researched. BHB has been found to modulate the levels
  of antioxidant genes, including MnSOD, Foxo3a, and glutathione, and protect neurons
  from contusion injury by epigenetic mechanism. BHB-reduced H2AK119ub is dependent
  on activation of L-type calcium channels and elevated intracellular calcium ion
  concentrations, which in turn activates the Ca2+/CaMKII/p-CREB signalling pathway
  and promotes the occupation of p-CREB and CBP in the brain derived neurotrophic
  factor(BDNF)promoter, thereby enhancing BDNF expression. However, BHB-increased
  H3K4me3 is dependent on cAMP/PKA activation. The latest research has shown that
  the intraperitoneal injection of BHB induced histone H3K9bhb, which promotes the
  expression of BDNF and alleviate major depressive disorder (MDD).
