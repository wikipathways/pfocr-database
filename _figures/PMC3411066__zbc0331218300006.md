caption: Formation and function of 16:1-PI in the signaling of the lipokine 16:1 in
  Swiss 3T3 cells. Glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) is converted to PA during de novo biosynthesis
  of PLs. Dephosphorylation of PA yields DAG that is coupled to choline or ethanolamine
  for PC and PE biosynthesis. PS is formed from PC or PE by the exchange of the headgroup.
  Activation of PA as CDP-DAG initiates PG and PI biosynthesis. The lipokine 16:1
  is endogenously formed in response to insulin and growth factors (GFs) or taken
  up from extracellular stores. 16:1 is subsequently incorporated into 16:1-PA, which
  is specifically converted to 16:1-PI through CDP-DAG synthase and PI synthase (de
  novo PI biosynthesis). The formation of 16:1-PI through LPIATs (remodeling PI biosynthesis)
  is negligible, instead. Levels of 16:1-PI correlate with cell proliferation. LPA,
  lyso-PA; LPI, lyso-PI; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; ACC, acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; LPAAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase.
  Blue, preferred metabolic fate of 16:1. Dashed arrow, unfavored metabolic pathway.
