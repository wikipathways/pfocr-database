caption: Schematic representation of the role of Wnt, Notch, TGF-β and Hif-1α signalling
  in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and liver progenitor cells in hepatocarcinogenesis.
  The cell growth promoting effects of the Wnt and Notch pathways on hepatocytes and
  cholangiocytes, respectively, as well as their differential role on liver progenitor
  cells. The complicated dual role of TGF-β as guardian of cell cycle control, as
  well as its tumour promoting and invasion and metastasis inducing potential in all
  cell types is visualised. Finally, the complex interactions between these three
  pathways, and the possible influence of the HIF-1 pathway is presented.
