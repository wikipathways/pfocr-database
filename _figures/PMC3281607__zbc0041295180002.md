caption: Antioxidant roles of Prx I, Prx III, and Srx in ethanol-fed mouse liver.
  EtOH feeding increases the abundance of CYP2E1 in the ER. A large proportion of
  Prx I is present at the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, where CYP2E1 is located.
  Prx I is therefore preferentially engaged in the reduction of ROS produced by CYP2E1
  and becomes hyperoxidized. Reactivation of such hyperoxidized Prx I requires the
  action of Srx, the expression of which is greatly increased via an Nrf2- and antioxidant
  regulatory element (ARE)-dependent pathway in the livers of ethanol-fed mice. Ethanol
  feeding also increases the abundance of CYP2E1 and the production of ROS in mitochondria,
  likely resulting in hyperoxidation of Prx III that is reversed in part by translocation
  of Srx from the cytosol into mitochondria.
