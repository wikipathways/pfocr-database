caption: 'Forty-four metabolites that increase during fasting include antioxidants,
  organic acids and signalling-related compounds. Non-targeted comprehensive metabolomics
  of whole blood detected increases of one-third (44) of metabolites identified during
  58 h of fasting. In addition to metabolites for energy production, antioxidative
  metabolites were identified as fasting markers, which may combat oxidative stress
  resulting from enhanced mitochondrial activity. Moreover, signalling metabolites
  would contribute for remodelling of metabolic homeostasis during fasting. See the
  text for details. Abbreviations: ET; ergothioneine, OA; ophthalmic acid, PPP; pentose
  phosphate pathway, 3-HB; 3-hydroxybutyrate and 2-OG; 2-oxoglutarate.'
