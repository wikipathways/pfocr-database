caption: 'The infection of endothelial cells by pathogenic microorganisms triggers
  the activation of the NF-κB pathway, resulting in increased levels of HIF-1α. The
  figure mainly illustrates the pathways through which bacteria, viruses, fungi, and
  cytokines activate the NF-κB pathway: (1) The TLR activation by bacterial infection
  recruits the adaptor protein MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88)
  to propagate downstream signals. MyD88 subsequently activates a series of kinases,
  leading to the activation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB),
  a transcription factor that regulates the expression of several pro-inflammatory
  genes. (2) RIG-I plays a crucial role in initiating the innate antiviral immune
  response by serving as a key pattern recognition receptor for host recognition of
  viruses. RIG-I recognizes the RNA component of viruses and transmits signals by
  interacting with the downstream signaling molecule MAVS through its own CARD. This
  process activates the cellular transcription factors IRF-3 and NF-κB, allowing them
  to enter the nucleus. (3) Recognition of β-1–3-glucan in the fungal cell wall by
  dectin-1 enables the sensing of fungal pathogens and initiates host immune responses.
  Dectin-1 triggers the downstream signaling pathways of Syk and Raf1, which subsequently
  modulate the activation of both classical and non-classical NF-κB signaling pathways.
  (4) Upon activation by TNF-α, the TNFR1 triggers the formation of a signaling complex
  that induces a cellular response. In the assembly of Complex I, the activated TNFR1
  binds to TRADD (TNFRSF1A-associated via death domain), followed by the interaction
  with a variety of components, such as receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1).
  This signaling pathway activates NF-κB and MAPK'
