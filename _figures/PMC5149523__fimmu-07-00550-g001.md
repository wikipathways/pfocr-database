caption: Effect of PD-1 on major signaling pathways and subsequent metabolic reprograming
  in T cells. When T cell encounters a foreign antigen presented by MHC on the surface
  of APC, TCR gets phosphorylated upon oligomerization of TCR/CD3 chains, followed
  by recruitment of activated Lck and Zap-70 to the phosphorylated ITAM (tyrosine
  motifs) of TCR tail, leading to initiation of downstream TCR-signaling cascade.
  During TCR cross-linking, when PD-1 interacts with its ligands, the two tyrosine
  residues on PD-1 cytoplasmic tail also become phosphorylated, and SHP-2 is recruited
  to ITSM (also possibly SHP-1). As a consequence, Lck and Zap-70 become dephosphorylated.
  PD-1 ligation also causes inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/MAPK/Erk pathways,
  leading to downregulation of glycolysis and amino acid metabolism and increase in
  fatty acid oxidation in T cells. This alteration in T cell metabolic reprograming
  may change the course of T cell differentiation, leading to impaired differentiation
  of effector and memory T cells, while enhancing the differentiation of T regulatory
  cells and exhausted T cells.
