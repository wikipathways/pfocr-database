caption: Study design. A, Biological model. Schematic representation of the MAPK signaling
  pathway whereby BRAF(V600E), the drugs and KO target sites are highlighted. B, Experimental
  design. WiDr and WiDr PTPN11 KO cells were cultured for transcriptome, proteome
  and phosphoproteome analysis. For each of the six treatments the time-course of
  events is indicated (Experimental Procedures). Color codes are utilized to differentiate
  the effect due to drug inhibition in PTPN11 WT with respect to the knock-out of
  PTPN11 KO by distinguishing BRAFi-treated samples (red and shades of purple) from
  not BRAFi-treated samples (gray and shades of blue). C, Workflow employed in this
  study. For the transcriptomics analysis, mRNA libraries were prepared and sequenced
  using Illumina NextSeq. Quantitation in proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis
  was done by label-free quantitation. Phosphoproteomics was performed after Ti4+-IMAC
  phosphopeptide enrichment. For the integration of transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome
  approach, a customized protein database was developed to include identified missense
  mutations for peptide identification and quantification (Experimental Procedures).
