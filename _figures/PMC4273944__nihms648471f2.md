caption: Che pathways in Myxococcus xanthus. (A) The Dif signal transduction pathway.
  The Dif system lacks homologs of CheB and CheR. The CheY homolog DifD serves as
  a phosphate sink to the CheA homolog DifE, which is proposed to have unidentified
  downstream partners that control exopolysaccharide production. A CheC homolog DifG
  functions as a phosphatase of DifD. (B) The Che3 signal transduction pathway. The
  Che3 system controlling developmental gene expression during fruiting body formation
  involves two gene clusters, che3 and crdS. CheA3 negatively regulates the CrdS-CrdA
  TCS by functioning as a phosphatase to the response regulator CrdA. As part of the
  che3 and crdS gene clusters, uncharacterized peptidylglycan-binding protein CrdB
  and penicillin-binding protein Pbp1A may provide additional inputs into the Che3
  pathway.
