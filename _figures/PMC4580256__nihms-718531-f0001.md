caption: '(1) First, ligands bind to receptors to promote receptor phosphorylation.
  (2) The PI3K protein attaches to the receptor, and (3) facilitates the conversion
  of PIP2 to PIP3. PTEN inhibits this step. (4) PIP3 goes to activate both PDK-1 and
  AKT, the former of which is required to activate the latter. (5) Phosphorylated
  AKT subsequently is involved in cell apoptosis and proliferation, and also activates
  mTOR. PI3K pathway inhibitors act on various steps within this pathway to inhibit
  pathway signaling. PDK-1: Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1; PIP2: Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate;
  PIP3: Phosphatidylinostiol-3,4,5-trisphosphate.'
