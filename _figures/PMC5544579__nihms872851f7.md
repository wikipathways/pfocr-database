caption: Cascade A represents SK-MEL-28 cellular response to BRAF V600E inhibitors
  (BRAFi) within the BRAF V600E mutation. Cascade B represents acquired BRAFi resistant
  SK-MEL-28VR1 cellular response to BRAFi within the mutation profile. Acquired resistance
  causes a paradoxical induction of the MAPK cascade without gemcitabine pre-treatment.
  Gemcitabine pre-treatment followed by BRAFi leads to induction of the MAPK cascade
  and induction of serine synthesis while cells are arrested. Induction of serine
  synthesis leads to an induction of the folate cycle for nucleotide synthesis. These
  series of events lead to cell death due to conflicting activation of cellular signaling
  pathway causing cell cycle arrest signal from gemcitabine-induced DNA damage and
  activation of MAPK signaling pathway by BRAF inhibitors. Cascade C shows sensitization
  of BRAF WT pancreatic cancer BxPC3M1 and non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H2122 cells
  to BRAF inhibitors by gemcitabine pre-treatment. In these BRAF WT cell lines, gemcitabine
  induces cell cycle arrest. Addition of BRAF inhibitors to the arrested cells induces
  the MAPK cascade leading to increased serine synthesis and folate synthesis. These
  series of events lead to cell death due to conflicting activation of cellular signaling
  pathway causing cell cycle arrest from gemcitabine-induced DNA damage and activation
  of MAPK signaling pathway by BRAF inhibitors. The actual mechanism of cell death
  is as yet unknown.
