caption: Schematic representation of the steroidogenic pathways. Pathway 1. The activated
  metabolic pathway in GDM women with normal weight compared to NGT women with normal
  weight is indicated by red arrows. Steroid hormones that showed a higher concentration
  in GDM women with normal weight are shown in the box with small red arrows. The
  red box indicates a higher product/precursor ratio in GDM women with normal weight.
  The green box indicates a lower product/precursor ratio in GDM women with normal
  weight. Pathway 2. The activated metabolic pathway in GDM women with overweight
  compared to GDM women with normal weight is indicated by green arrows. Steroid hormones
  that showed a lower concentration in women with GDM with overweight are shown in
  the box with small green arrows. The red box indicates a higher product/precursor
  ratio in GDM women with overweight. The green box indicates a lower product/precursor
  ratio in GDM women with overweight. GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; NGT, normal
  glucose tolerance.
