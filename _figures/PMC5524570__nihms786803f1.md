caption: 'A: Double Fork Convergence Model. (i) Two replication forks converge on
  an ICL and stall 20–40 nt away from it. (ii) Removal of the CMG helicase by BRCA1
  allows one of the leading strands to approach within 1 nt of the ICL (−1). (iii)
  Activation of the FA pathway leads to ubiquitylation of FANCD2-I, which is required
  for unhooking of the ICL by SLX4/ERCC1-XPF and possibly other nucleases. The position
  of these incisions have not been determined, and the amount of duplex surrounding
  the ICL is unknown. (iv) The unhooked ICL could then be further processed by exonucleases
  to trim the duplex around the ICL, making it more amenable to bypass by DNA polymerases.
  (v, vi) An insertion polymerase inserts nucleotide(s) opposite the ICL and an extension
  polymerase extends the insertion product further. (vi) Ligation to downstream Okazaki
  fragments restores one daughter duplex, and (vii) is used to restore the other duplex
  by HR. The ICL remnant on one strand is likely removed by NER to complete the repair
  of both daughter duplexes. B: ICL traverse model. (i) A single fork collides with
  the ICL, and (ii) in a FANCM/MHF dependent manner ‘traverses’ the ICL to continue
  replication on the other side of the crosslink without unhooking it. The later steps
  of this pathway are not known, but could involve incisions and TLS for post-replicative
  repair.'
