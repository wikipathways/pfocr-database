caption: The ferroptosis signaling pathway and ferroptosis regulators with known and
  potential relevance to radiotherapy. Ferroptosis is driven by the accumulation of
  PUFA-PL peroxides, whose generation is facilitated by iron metabolism, PUFA-PL synthesis
  and peroxidation. Ferroptosis is counteracted by ferroptosis defense systems including
  the SLC7A11-GSH-GPX4, NAD(P)H-FSP1-CoQ, and GCH1-BH4 axes. Several regulators in
  the ferroptosis pathway that are modulated by radiotherapy are also highlighted.
  These regulators either have been confirmed to play roles or potentially might have
  roles in radiotherapy-induced ferroptosis
