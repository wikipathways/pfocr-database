caption: The Purine Metabolic Pathway—ATP is sequentially degraded to hypoxanthine
  and xanthine, which are substrates of XOR. Guanine can also be converted to xanthine
  increasing substrate availability for XDH/XO. XOR exists in two interconvertible
  forms, the dehydrogenase form (XDH) that reduces NAD+, while the oxidase form (XO)
  of the enzyme reduces oxygen, concomitantly producing superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.
  The oxidase form of the enzyme is the predominant source of ROS production and is
  associated with disrupting homeostasis in inflammatory pathologies, including chronic
  wounds. Both forms of XOR catalyze the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and
  finally xanthine to uric acid. In humans, uric acid is the terminal metabolite in
  the purine metabolic pathway and is found in elevated levels in wound fluid from
  chronic wounds. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine
  triphosphate; NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced form; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; XDH, xanthine dehydrogenase; XO, xanthine oxidase; XOR, xanthine
  oxidoreductase. (Reproduced from Pacher et al.)
