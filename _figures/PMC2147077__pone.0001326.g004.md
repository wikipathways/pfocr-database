caption: 'A) V. vinifera general pathway for phenolics biosynthesis leading to stilbenes
  (C6-C2-C6) and flavonoids (C6-C3-C6). For each enzyme, the gene copy number is reported
  in brackets. Genes were identified by similarity search using BLAST where the references
  were the sequences of phenolic biosynthetic genes previously characterized in grape
  and in other plant species. Putative homologues and gene copy numbers were determined
  by comparing aligned amino acid sequences based on a threshold of 80% similarity
  between the grape sequences, and 60% similarity between grape and other species.
  For the large StSy, PAL and F3''5''H families, phylogenetic analysis was performed
  with MEGA4 package  after aligning with ClustalW . The following enzymes involved
  in the pathway are shown: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; StSy, stilbene synthase; RSGT,
  resveratrol glucosyltransferase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  F3''H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3''5''H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin
  reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; UFGT, UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase;
  OMT, O-methyltransferase; ACCase, acetyl CoA carboxylase. PA refers to proanthocyanidins.
  Enzymatic steps that have not been experimentally confirmed are marked with an asterisk
  (*). B) Steps of plastidic isoprenoid pathway and monoterpenoids biosynthesis. For
  each enzyme, the gene copy number is reported in brackets. Gene annotation was performed
  as described in . Abbreviations: G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate;
  MEP, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate; CDP-ME, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol;
  CDP-MEP, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2Cmethyl-D-erythritol 2-phosphate; ME-cPP, 2C-ethyl-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate; HMBPP, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate; IPP,
  isopentenyl pyrophosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The enzymes in the
  pathway are indicated in blue: DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; DXR
  1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductase; ISPD, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  synthase; ISPE, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase; ISPF, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; ISPG, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate
  synthase and ISPH 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate reductase (ISPG and
