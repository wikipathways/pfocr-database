caption: (A) Model for SHIP-deficient mice. Stromal cell–derived IL-33 is released
  under stress or steady-state conditions through a pathway that is yet to be determined.
  IL-33 engages its receptor ST2 on stromal cells or, preferentially, on a committed
  population of myeloid cells. Signal transduction via the ST2→MyD88→IRAK4 axis promotes
  the secretion of several cytokines and growth factors promoting myoproliferation
  — among others GM-CSF and IL-6 — that bind to their respective receptors and activate
  the JAK2/STAT5 pathway (). SHIP is a negative regulator in this process, and impaired
  SHIP-mediated inhibition results in MPN-like disease. (B) IL-33 released by stromal
  cells in the human BM engages ST2 receptor on CD34+ HSPCs. Activation of cell signaling
  downstream of ST2 leads to the production of autocrine cytokines and growth factors
  that support proliferation.
