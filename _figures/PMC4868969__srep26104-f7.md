caption: Os8N3/Xa13 is induced in the chloroplast inner membrane by PXO99 through
  the ETI (effector-triggered immunity) pathway, where it interacts with tAPX to reduce
  its ability to detoxify the H2O2. The arrows indicate the positive regulation of
  the pathway, whereas blunted lines indicate the negative regulation of the pathway.
