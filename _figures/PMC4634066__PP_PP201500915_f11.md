caption: Summary and model. PNY-PNF/STM limits expression of BOP1/2 and downstream
  effector ATH1/KNAT6 to boundary domains flanking the . BOP1 acting through an unknown
  TGA bZIP cofactor directly activates ATH1, whereas promotion of KNAT6 is indirect
  (red arrow). These products form a module that represses growth, meristem activity,
  and flowering by increasing  content by transcriptional promotion of  biosynthetic
  genes. Either directly or indirectly (dashed lines), we propose that misexpression
  of this pathway leads to down-regulation of GA pathway components and repression
  of the miR156-SPL-miR172 module at one or more nodes in correlation with increased
  content of associated classes of floral repressors (e.g. DELLA, AP2-like, and AP2/ERF
  clades). Ultimately, SPL and FD/FT transcripts (not depicted) fail to accumulate,
  and activation of floral meristem identity genes LFY, AP1, and CAL required for
  flower initiation is blocked. Internode elongation is also blocked.
