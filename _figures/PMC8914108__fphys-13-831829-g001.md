caption: The scheme of major mechanisms of exercise-promoted metabolic remodeling
  in the heart summarized in this review. Exercise can improve cardiac mitochondrial
  biogenesis through the eNOS signaling pathway that promotes mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
  content, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), nuclear
  respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Exercise
  can also upregulate the phosphorylation level of sucrose non-fermenting AMPK-related
  kinase (SNARK), enhancing glucose uptake and utilization. Besides, exercise stimulates
  circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and insulin that increase overall
  glucose transport and uptake and also upregulates serine phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase
  2 (PFKFB2) that boost glycolysis in the heart. In addition, exercise augments the
  activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and reduces the activity
  of glucose 6-phosphate isomerase (GPI). Systemically, exercise can stimulate peripheral
  fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue, and increased palmitoleic acid (C16:1n7)
  stimulates Akt phosphorylation that mediates metabolic remodeling in the heart.
