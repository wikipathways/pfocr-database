caption: A, Ribosomal subunit dissociation downstream of stall recognition by Hbs1L-Pelota
  or ZNF598 traps the peptidyl-tRNA on the 60S ribosomal subunit. NEMF (yeast Rqc2)
  binds the exposed 60S-tRNA interface, which prevents 40S rejoining and facilitates
  recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin (yeast Ltn1) to polyubiquitinate
  the nascent chain. The polyubiquitinated nascent chain may be released by the endonuclease
  ANKZF1 (yeast Vms1) for proteasomal degradation via a process involving the AAA+
  ATPase p97 (yeast Cdc48) and its ubiquitin binding cofactors. B, ANKZF1 cleaves
  the peptidyl-tRNA just before the invariant 3’CCA nucleotides, generating a CCA-less
  tRNA intermediate with a terminal 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate (2’,3’>p) that is recycled
  in a two-step pathway involving the removal of the 2’,3’>p by the phosphatases ELAC1
  or ANGEL2, followed by re-addition of the 3’-CCA by TRNT1. TRNT1 also possesses
  proofreading capabilities that can target defective tRNAs for degradation (QC).
  C, Rqc2 can catalyze the non-templated addition of C-terminal alanine and possibly
  threonine residues (CAT tails). CAT tails can push out lysines within the ribosome
  exit tunnel for ubiquitylation by Listerin. Alternatively, CAT-tailed nascent chains
  may be released from 60S ribosomal subunits. Off the ribosome, CAT tails may serve
  as degrons leading to proteasomal degradation, or are otherwise prone to aggregation,
  which may titrate away chaperones and, in yeast, activate the heat shock response
  via HSF1.
