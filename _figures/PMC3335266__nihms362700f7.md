caption: The α7 acetylcholine receptor-initiated anti-inflammatory pathway can be
  stimulated by various stimuli. The endogenous innate cell α7nAChR ligand is acetylcholine
  that is produced by the vagus system in response to infection or other tissue insult
  (–). The function of acetylcholine release is to limit an overly exuberant cytokine
  response to infection. Many therapeutic agents are under development that attempt
  to take advantage of this suppressive pathway (). Eventually, such drugs may prove
  efficacious in the treatment of multiple inflammatory diseases and conditions, including
  septic shock, pancreatitis and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as periodontitis
  (–). Cigarette smoke contains large amounts of a potent, exogenous α7nAChR agonist,
  nicotine (–) (). The primary stable metabolite of nicotine, cotinine, is also an
  efficient α7nAChR agonist (). The consequences of α7nAChR engagement by acetylcholine,
  pharmaceutical agents or nicotine/cotinine is a suppression of the inflammatory
  response (, , –). When triggered at the appropriate time, α7nAChR engagement would
  normally be beneficial. In the case of nicotine, it has been shown that α7nAChR
  engagement also results in the suppression of the oxidative burst (, ), a critical
  bacterial killing mechanism in phagocytic innate cells. Furthermore, nicotine-α7nAChR
  interactions may also stimulate the rapid release of matrix metalloproteinases and
  other proteolytic enzymes () () () from innate cells. Therefore, chronic, inappropriate
  nicotinic stimulation of innate α7nAChRs in smokers may increase susceptibility
  to infection with periodontal pathogens by supressing the inflammatory response
  and phagocytic killing required to fight infection. Additionally, increased protease
  release from nicotine-exposed innate cells may promote protease-protease inhibitor
  imbalances that contribute to the tissue remodelling apparent in periodontal diseases
