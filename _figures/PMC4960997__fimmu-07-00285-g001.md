caption: Release of HSP27 involves non-classical secretory mechanisms. Experimental
  evidence suggests that HSP27 exits cells via the endolysosomal pathway and through
  exosomes. Localization of HSP27 to lysosomes () may involve the dephosphorylation
  of two serine residues at amino acids 15 and 82 (); meanwhile, HSP70 appears to
  enter lysosomes with the aid of ABC transporters spanning the lysosomal membrane
  (). Although direct protein translocation accounts for the unconventional secretion
  of FGF-2 (, ), it remains to be determined whether this mechanism plays a part in
  HSP27 extracellular release. Like FGF-2, HSP70 can interact with lipids as well
  as integrate into lipid membranes (, , –), and it also appears that HSP70 can integrate
  into artificial lipid bilayers forming channels.
