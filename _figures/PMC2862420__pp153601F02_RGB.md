caption: Possible safener-mediated signaling pathways for the regulation of defense
  genes and activation of detoxification pathways in plants. Safeners may tap into
  a RES oxylipin-mediated signaling pathway (e.g. OPDA and PPA1) and up-regulate TGA
  transcription factors (for review, see ), an Nrf2-Keap1-mediated signaling pathway
  (), and/or a JA-mediated signaling pathway (; ) to induce the expression of proteins
  involved in herbicide detoxification in plants. It is also possible that safeners
  may utilize an unknown (?) signaling pathway to trigger plant defense gene expression.
  Dashed lines indicate possible but unproven signaling pathways, and solid lines
  indicate known signaling pathways for the regulation of plant gene expression. Note
  that the three distinct “Gene Expression” boxes indicate that only a subset of GST
  enzymes can metabolize herbicides or safeners as substrates, leading to detoxification
  and herbicide tolerance in cereal crops. CoI1, Coronatine-insensitive protein1;
  JAZ, transcriptional repressor protein; TF, transcription factor/activator. [See
  online article for color version of this figure.]
