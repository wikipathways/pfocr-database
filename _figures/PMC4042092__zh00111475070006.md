caption: Proposed model for the loss of mechanosensitivity in osteoblasts due to ASFF.
  The application of FSS triggers the opening up of mechano- and voltage-sensitive
  calcium channels. The influx of Ca2+ through these channels leads to vesicular release
  of the autocrine-paracrine signaling molecule ATP. Once in the extracellular space,
  ATP activates both the P2Y2 and the P2X receptors. In this study we demonstrate
  that RhoA GTPase is activated by P2Y2R, which initiates a cascade of events via
  the ROCK/LIMK-2/cofilin pathway to culminate in actin filament reorganization to
  form stress fibers. This increases the cell stiffness and prevents the activation
  of calcium channels to the second bout of FSS.
