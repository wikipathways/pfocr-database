caption: MiR-634 enhances the sensitivity for chemotherapy. By regulation of Cyclin
  D1 and the Ras-MAPK pathway, miR-634 overexpression may affect the cell cycle profile
  and apoptosis. Furthermore, repression of the Ras-MAPK pathway, which inhibits several
  pro-apoptotic factors (e.g. Bad [], BimEL [, ]), can indirectly sensitize ovarian
  tumors to chemotherapeutics, such as cisplatin/carboplatin (Pt) and doxorubicin
  (dox)
