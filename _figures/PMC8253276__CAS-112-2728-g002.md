caption: Schematic model for Nogo‐B‐induced tumor angiogenesis. In response to hypoxia,
  expression of Nogo‐B is transcriptionally activated by hypoxia inducible factor‐1
  (HIF‐1) similarly to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Activator protein‐1
  (AP‐1), comprising c‐Fos, also activates the transcription of VEGF and Nogo‐B. Both
  overexpressed VEGF and Nogo‐B are secreted into the extracellular microenvironment
  (ECM). Through binding with VEGF receptor (VEGFR), VEGF could activate multiple
  intracellular signaling pathways (including FAK, PLC‐γ/Ras, and PI3K/Akt) to regulate
  endothelial cell proliferation in addition to migration and adhesion. Furthermore,
  through binding integrin αvβ3 and activating the FAK pathway or through binding
  Nogo‐B receptor (NgBR), Nogo‐B regulates endothelial cell adhesion and migration
  without affecting cell proliferation, thereby promoting tumor angiogenesis
