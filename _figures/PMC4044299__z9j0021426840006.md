caption: TG2 expression results in constitutive activation of NF-κB via noncanonical
  pathway. Acute inflammation is a tightly regulated physiological process in which
  NF-κB is transiently activated as a result of IKK-complex mediated phosphorylation
  and degradation of the inhibitory protein IκBα. As IκBα is one of the downstream
  targets of NF-κB, its expression results in feedback inhibition of NF-κB, which
  limits the inflammatory response (A). In contrast, chronic inflammation is associated
  with constitutive activation of NF-κB owing to aberrant expression of TG2 (B). TG2
  binds to IκBα resulting in its rapid degradation via a nonproteasomal pathway. Alternatively,
  TG2-mediated covalent crosslinking of IκBα may promote proteasomal degradation of
  IκBα polymers (broken arrows). TG2-activated NF-κB regulates the expression of multiple
  target genes that play roles in cell survival, invasion, and drug resistance. One
  of the TG2/NF-κB target genes is HIF-1α, a transcription factor known to promote
  an aggressive phenotype in cancer cells.
