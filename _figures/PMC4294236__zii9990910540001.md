caption: MoCo biosynthetic pathway in M. tuberculosis (adapted from reference ). MoCo
  biosynthesis occurs through a highly conserved, four-step pathway. Further modifications
  of MoCo give rise to alternative forms of the cofactor. A notable feature of this
  pathway is the multiplicity of homologues involved in the first two steps of the
  pathway. Genes identified as essential in forward genetic screens are underlined.
  Parentheses denote genes with weak homology. The moaX gene is reflected twice, since
  it contains both moaD- and moaE-like domains.
