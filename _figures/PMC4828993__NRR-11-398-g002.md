  description: 'Role of the nNOS/peroxynitrite/AMPK vicious cycle in stroke.Stroke
    causes necrotic neuronal cell death in the core area immediately after the injury.
    Necrotic neuronal death is fast and irreversible. However, secondary injury in
    larger penumbra area due to nitroxidative stress and inflammation is reversible
    and may be blocked by targeting the nNOS/peroxynitrite/AMPK vicious cycle. The
    injurious cycle is activated by aberrant activity of nNOS due to increased neuronal
    ONOO– formation. Peroxynitrite activates LKB1, a kinase which activates AMPK via
    phosphorylation. AMPK maintains the nNOS in aberrant activity state by phosphorylating
    nNOS and/or endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), leading to sustained production
    of O2–/ONOO– and thus maintaining the nNOS/peroxynitrite/AMPK vicious cycle. GSNO
    invokes neuroprotection and aids functional recovery by inhibiting aberrant activities
    of nNOS and AMPK and thus reducing the activities of the nNOS/peroxynitrite/AMPK
    vicious cycle. AMPK: Adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase; ATP: adenosine
    triphosphate; BBB: blood-brain barrier; BH4: tetrahydrobiopterin; GSNO: S-nitrosoglutathine;
