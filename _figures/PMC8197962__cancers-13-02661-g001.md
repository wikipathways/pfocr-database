caption: Regulation of ZNF-281 expression and ZNF-281’s role in carcinogenesis. The
  illustration above shows the most important regulating factors of ZNF-281 expression
  and outcomes of ZNF-281 stimulation. SOX4 regulates cells’ differentiation and proliferation
  and induces EMT through ZNF-281. Another pathway stimulating EMT is initiated by
  Snail. ZNF-281 directly stimulates Snail, creating a positive feedback loop. Any
  DNA damage, including administering DNA-damaging drugs, will cause an increase in
  ZNF-281 expression. p53 represses ZNF-281 and its inhibition is mediated by miR34a.
  ZNF-281 induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and keeps cells in the mesenchymal
  state, enabling cancerous cells to migrate and invade. Cells acquire a spindle shape,
  lose E-cadherin in the membrane and have β-catenin translocated from the membrane
  to the nucleus, resulting in weakening of cell junctions. ZNF-281 induces expression
  of CD133 and LGR5 (prognostic stem cell markers) and is responsible for cells gaining
  pluripotency and maintaining their newly acquired stem cell traits. Up-regulated
  ZNF-281 expression is proven to be correlated with progression and metastasis of
  the cancers listed above. In glioma, ZNF-281 expression down-regulates NF-κB1 and
  MMP9 protein expression—both responsible for glioma cells’ invasiveness. In non-small
  cell lung cancer, ZNF-281 gene expression suppresses carcinogenesis via promotion
  of apoptosis, inhibition of proliferation and tumor suppression. Therefore, ZNF-281’s
  down-regulation in glioma and NSCLC is correlated with its progression and metastasis.
