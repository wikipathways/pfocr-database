caption: Overview of sphingolipid biosynthesis and metabolic pathways. The major processes
  of sphin-golipid metabolism include the de novo synthesis pathway, salvage pathway,
  degradation pathway, SM synthesis pathway, GSL synthesis pathway as well as C1P
  synthesis pathway. (a) De novo synthesis is initiated by the SPT complex, which
  completes a series of enzymatic reactions in the ER to produce Cer, which serves
  as a central hub for other sphingolipid pathways. (b) Cer is shut-tled via vesicular
  transport to the cytosolic side of the Golgi, where it is converted to GlcCer in
  the presence of UGCG and transported by FAPP2 into the TGN for further generation
  of a variety of GSLs. (c) Simultaneously, Cer gen-erates S1P in the presence of
  CDases and SPHKs. S1P is further degraded into hexadecenal and ethanolamine phosphate
  through the catalytic action of SGPL1, completing the degradation pathway. Additionally,
  S1P can be reversed to sphingosine (Sph) by the combined action of SGPPs and PLPPs,
  allowing its participation in the salvage pathway. Cer is transported to the trans-Golgi
  complex by CERT. Here, a portion of Cer is catalytically activated by SMS1 to generate
  SM and DAG; another portion is phosphorylated to C1P by CERK. (d) Alternatively,
  Cer is converted to acylceramide catalyzed by DGATs, for storage in lipid droplets.
  (e) Lipids accumulate in the plasma membrane, forming lipid rafts
