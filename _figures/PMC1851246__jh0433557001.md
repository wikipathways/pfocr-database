caption: Biological and biochemical pathways linked with EphA2. Shown is a synthesis
  of the reported protein interactions and cellular consequences of EphA2 signaling.
  The solid lines denote areas of known positive regulation, whereas dotted lines
  represent a negative regulatory event. Dashed lines indicate situations where it
  is presently unresolved whether this pathway represents a positive or negative regulatory
  event.
