caption: Model for the primosome activity and initiation of lagging strand DNA synthesis.
  The T4 replication complex is composed of eight proteins that interact to synthesize
  DNA. Helicase (gp41) and primase (gp61) form stacked rings that encircle the lagging
  DNA strand. The helicase unwinds duplex DNA ahead of the leading strand polymerase
  (gp43) while the primase synthesizes pentaribonucleotide primers for use by the
  lagging strand polymerase. Initiation of lagging strand synthesis begins with the
  synthesis of a primer by the primase while the helicase continues to unwind the
  DNA duplex. To accommodate primer synthesis in the opposing direction of helicase
  unwinding one or more primase subunits may dissociate from the primosome complex
  with the newly synthesized primer (primosome disassembly model) or the primase may
  remain with the replisome creating a second loop of DNA from the excess DNA unwound
  by the helicase during primer synthesis (DNA looping model). In either pathway,
  the clamp loader then loads a clamp onto the RNA primer causing the lagging strand
  polymerase to release the lagging strand template and recycle to the new clamp-loaded
  RNA primer. Okazaki fragments are derived from operation of both the collision and
  signaling mechanisms for lagging strand polymerase recycling.
