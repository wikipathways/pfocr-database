caption: A model to explain the effect of thymoquinone on ulcerative colitis. The
  ROS induced by SDS in the intestines could activate the JNK signaling pathway in
  intestinal stem cells. These stresses lead to an imbalance in the proliferation
  and differentiation of intestinal stem cells. Therefore, the intestinal epithelium
  fails to undergo rapid cell turnover to maintain the integrity of the intestinal
  epithelial barrier. Incorporating thymoquinone into the diet may shield the intestines
  against SDS‐induced harm by modulating the JNK signaling in intestinal stem cells
