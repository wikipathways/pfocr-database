caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming in PAH favors glycolysis. Glucose brought across
  the plasma membrane by glucose transporters is phosphorylated by HK-2 bound to VDAC
  on the OMM. VDAC channels ATP generated by the ATP synthesizing machinery on the
  inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating direct access of ATP to VDAC-bound HK-2.
  In this manner, HK-2 can convert glucose to G-6-P. To maintain this high rate of
  glycolytic metabolism and to stimulate proliferation, G-6-P rapidly distributes
  across two key metabolic routes: entry of G-6-P into the PPP for biosynthetic reactions;
  and conversion of G-6-P via the glycolytic pathway to lactic acid, which is transported
  out of the cell to regenerate NAD+ and maintain glycolysis. Some pyruvate is directed
  to the mitochondria to provide substrates for the TCA cycle for energy generation,
  as well as lipid and amino acid biosynthesis (not shown). ANT, adenine nucleotide
  translocator; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; HK-2, hexokinase-2; OMM, outer mitochondrial
  membrane; PAH, pulmonary arterial hypertension; PiC, inorganic phosphate carrier;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; VDAC, voltage dependent anion channel.'
