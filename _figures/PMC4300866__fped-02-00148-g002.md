caption: 'The three pathways of complement activation: classical, lectin, and alternative
  pathways. The classical pathway is initiated via binding of C1 complex (which consists
  of C1q, C1r, and C1s molecules) through its recognition molecule C1q to antibody
  complexes on the surface of pathogens. Subsequently, C1s cleaves C4, which binds
  covalently to the pathogen surface, and then cleaves C2, leading to the formation
  of C4b2a complex, the C3 convertase of the classical pathway. Activation of the
  lectin pathway occurs through the binding of the complex of mannose-binding lectin
  (MBL), CL-K1 or ficolins, and MBL-associated serine proteases 1 and 2 (MASP-1 and
  MASP-2, respectively) to various carbohydrates or acetylated residues on the surface
  of pathogens (PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern). Like C1s, MASP-2 leads
  to the formation of the C3 convertase, C4b2a, but its activation is dependent on
  MASP-1. MASP-1 also cleaves C2 and C3. Activation of the alternative pathway depends
  on spontaneous low-grade hydrolysis of C3 in plasma leading to the formation of
  C3b. This C3b binds factor B (homologous to C2) to form a C3bB complex. The cleavage
  of factor B by factor D form the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb. Properdin
  stabilizes this complex. The C3 convertases cleave C3 to C3b, which binds covalently
  next to the site of complement activation (opsonization). This amplifies the cascade
  and mediates phagocytosis, as well as adaptative immune responses. The addition
  of further C3b molecules to the C3 convertase forms C5 convertases (C3bBbC3b for
  the alternative pathway or C4bC2aC3b for both classical and lectin pathways), initiating
  the assembly of the membrane-attack complex (MAC) by cleavage of C5 to C5a and C5b.
  Whereas C5a functions as a potent anaphylatoxin, C5b forms a complex with C6 and
  C7, which is inserted in the cell membrane. Thereafter, C8 and 10–18 C9 molecules
  (80 × 55 Å each) bind to this complex, resulting in a fully functional MAC (C5b-9).
  The three pathways converge to this common terminal pathway, culminating with cell
  lysis and death.'
