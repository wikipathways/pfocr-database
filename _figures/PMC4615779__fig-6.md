caption: Overview of the MapMan visualization of differentially expressed transcripts
  (DETs) in wheat under heat stress. (a) Effect of HS on stress-associated genes,
  cell cycle, and redox-regulated pathways. (b) Effect of HS on genes associated with
  photosynthetic pathway, hormonal synthesis and regulation, and protein metabolism.
  (c) Effect of HS on genes associated with carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid metabolism,
  and other metabolite pathways. Pathways were analyzed by the MapMan software (http://mapman.gabipd.org/web/guest/mapman).
  Fold changes (Log2) are indicated by the color scale, red and green represent increase
  and decrease of expression, respectively, in the HS-treated sample as compared to
  the control sample.
