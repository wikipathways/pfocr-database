caption: Working model of Atoh8 activation by canonical BMP signaling pathway. In
  the canonical pathway, BMPs transduce their signal by assembling type I or type
  II receptors to form a hetero-tetrameric complex. The assembly of receptors initiates
  transphosphorylation of type I receptors by type II receptors which further phosphorylates
  and activates R-Smads (Smad 1/5/8). The activated Smad1/5/8 interacts with Co-Smad
  (Smad4) to form a complex that further translocate into the nucleus to bind to the
  Smad Binding Element (SBE) of Atoh8 to initiate its transcription. Based on the
  current literature, the activated Atoh8 can be considered to regulate stress response,
  hypoxic response, iron metabolism and stemness of the cells.
