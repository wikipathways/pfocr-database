caption: 'The Interferon alarm system: Adapted from Onomoto et al (). Activation of
  the cytoplasmic receptors RIG-1 and MDA5 by viral dsRNAs, as well as endosomal receptors
  TLR 7/8 by ssRNAs, lead to phosphorylation of IRF3 and 7, and the pro-inflammatory
  factor NF-kB. These transcription factors induce the expression of interferon genes
  and inflammatory cytokines upon nuclear translocation. Newly synthesized interferons
  bind to their receptors on neighbouring cells and induce the expression of ISGs
  through the Jak/STAT pathway. Under the influence of the restriction factors encoded
  by these genes, the cell goes into an ‘alarm’ mode, and in this state, they halt
  protein synthesis, including that of viral proteins, and marks all newly synthesized
  proteins for degradation. Vesicular transport is slowed, which leads to inhibition
  of virion assembly and release. Excessive production of IFN induces cell apoptosis
  and is associated with the development of a cytokine storm. During a cytokine storm,
  there is the risk of the formation of autoimmune attacks. The lack of IFN production
  does not prepare cells for viral invasion and, as a result, exacerbates an infectious
  disease. RIG-1, retinoic acid inducible gene-1; MDA5, melanoma differentiation associated
  protein-5; TLR, toll-like receptor; IFN, interferon; IRF, IFN regulatory factor;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, Signal Transducer and Activator
  of Transcription proteins; ISG, IFN stimulated gene; ssRNA, single stranded RNA.'
