caption: Molecular mechanisms of LGR4 in tumor bone metastasis. (Breast cancer) RSPO2
  or RANKL binds to LGR4 on breast cancer cells, activates the Gαq/β-catenin signaling
  pathway, promotes the secretion of DKK1, which is transported through the bloodstream
  to the bone matrix, and then binds to LRP5 on osteoclast precursor cells (OPCs),
  promoting the secretion of the chemokine Rnasek, which promotes bone metastasis
  of breast cancer. (Multiple myeloma) R-spondins secreted by osteoblasts bind to
  LGR4 on multiple myeloma cells and activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
  which promotes the survival and proliferation of multiple myeloma and its bone metastasis.
  Whether this pathway can generate DKK1 remains to be investigated. Meanwhile, LGR4
  can activate the NF-κB signaling pathway and promote the production of CXCR12, leading
  to osteolytic lesions
