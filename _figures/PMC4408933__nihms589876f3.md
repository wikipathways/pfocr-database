caption: 'The adipocytokine signaling pathway as represented in the Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg1.html) (; , ). Connections
  represent relations between adjacent molecules, with arrows representing activation
  and blunted lines representing inhibition. Dashed lines indicate an indirect effect.
  Microarray results found the following genes from this pathway to be up-regulated
  in FSL rats relative to SD rats: TRADD, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member
  1 (FACS; Acsl1), and mitogen activated protein kinase 10 (MAPK10, JNK). A conservative
  statistical analysis (EASE) indicated overrepresen-tation of this pathway (p=0.06).
  Results from our human studies indicated significant correlations between adiponectin
  (Adipo) levels and questionnaire measures of anxiety and depression. Significant
  correlations were not found between these measures and leptin (Lep) levels. Factors
  examined in the human component of this study are outlined in rectangles, while
  those factors found to be differentially regulated in FSL rats are circled.'
