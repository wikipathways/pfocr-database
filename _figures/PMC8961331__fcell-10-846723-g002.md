caption: 'Crosstalk Between TGF-β Signaling and Glycolysis. In the glycolytic pathway,
  glucose is converted to pyruvates via a cascade of enzymatic reactions. It has been
  reported that TGF-β signaling can either increase or decrease the expression of
  GLUT1 and HK2, depending on the cell types. This cell type-context effect is also
  seen on PKM2, an enzyme that catalyzes pyruvate into lactate. TGF-β signaling upregulates
  PFKFB3, leading to increased F26BP levels, which, in turn, accelerate conversion
  of F6P to F16BP. It has been suggested that glucose and lactate can promote TGF-β
  signaling; and inhibition of GFAT prevents glucose-induced expression of TGF-β ligands,
  implying a potential role of glucosamine-6-phosphotase in mediating this process.
  The conversion of F16BP to pyruvate has been omitted for clarity. Blue texts and
  arrows, glycolysis and its branches; gray arrows, cell-type dependent effect. Abbreviations:
