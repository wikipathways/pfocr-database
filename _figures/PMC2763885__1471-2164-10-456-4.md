caption: 'Hypothetic model of seasonal photoperiodism transcriptomic regulation in
  the pea aphid''s head. This scheme corresponds to the head of the sexuparae submitted
  to photoperiod shortening and transmitting the signal to its embryos, the future
  sexuals. The photoperiod is sensed by still unknown photoreceptors located either
  in the brain (left side of the diagram) or in the compound eyes (right side). Perception
  is followed by a series of nervous signalling through different pathways such as
  Rho, Wunen or Dunc. In parallel, modification of the cuticle structure might lead
  to a higher concentration in dopamine in the brain that acts as a neurotransmitter.
  Nervous signalisation is relayed by endocrine regulation through the juvenile hormone
  signalling: the insulin pathway could be a regulator of the JH signalling pathway.
  SN: short night, LN: long night, cc: corpora cardiaca, ca: corpora allata.'
