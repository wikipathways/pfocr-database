caption: APC-mediated and T-cell intrinsic TLR activity. (A) TLR ligands can activate
  T-cells indirectly via APCs, where after ligand binding, TLR signaling via NF-kB
  induces an upregulation of MHC, costimulatory receptors, and proinflammatory cytokines.
  (B) TLR ligands can also induce T-cell activation directly via TLR molecules expressed
  on the T-cell surface. In CD4+ and CD8+ effector T-cells, this activation is characterized
  by proinflammatory cytokines, memory T-cell formation, enhanced sensitivity to antigens
  and suppression of regulatory T-cells. In regulatory T-cells, different TLR ligands
  can have contrasting effects, either enhancing or suppressing their function. These
  different mechanisms, APC-mediated and T-cell intrinsic, likely work in concert
  in response to systemic TLR ligand exposure. The T-cell intrinsic pathway can be
  specifically exploited in T-cell mediated treatments such as adoptive cell transfers.
  APCs, antigen-presenting cells; IL-1, interleukin 1; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa B; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNFα, tumor necrosis
  factor-α.
