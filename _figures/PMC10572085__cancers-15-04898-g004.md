caption: The signaling pathway through co-receptors of CD44. The CD44v6 isoform has
  a co-receptor in the variant region of the CD44 ectodomain. Vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) can bind to the co-receptor.
  VEGF bound to the co-receptor further binds to the VEGF receptor (VEGFR), forming
  a ternary complex of CD44v6-VEGF-VEGFR to promote angiogenesis. VEGFR and cMET form
  a heterodimer and suppress migratory activity via the interaction of HGF and cMET.
  In contrast, the binding of VEGF to CD44 is inhibited by the anti-VEGF antibody
  bevacizumab, and thus, CD44v6 does not form the heterodimer of VEGFR and cMET and
  a homodimer with cMET is instead generated. HGF then binds to the co-receptor of
  CD44 instead of VEGF, creating a CD44v6-HGF-cMET ternary complex. This stimulates
  the Ras signaling pathway, resulting in increased motility.
