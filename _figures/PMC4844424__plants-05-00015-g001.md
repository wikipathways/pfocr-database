caption: 'Biosynthesis of JA, major enzymes involved and mutants in the pathway. The
  biosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts (green) and peroxisomes (brown). In brief, after
  cleavage of linolenic acid from a membrane lipid it is converted to OPDA in three
  enzymatic steps. OPDA is a functional signaling compound but can be transported
  to peroxisomes specifically where it is further metabolized to JA by the action
  of OPR and subsequent β-oxidation steps. For further explanation, refer to the text.
  Mutant names are shown in light blue boxes. Extra glume 1 (eg1) is a mutant of a
  plastidic lipase involved in flower specific JA synthesis. OsHI-LOX antisense plants
  were found to be impaired in JA-dependent insect responses. A mutant of OsAOS1,
  coleoptile photomorphogenesis 1 (cpm1), was isolated as photomorphogenic rice mutant
  like hebiba and cpm2, which are mutated in OsAOC. OsOPR7 carries a point-mutation
  in unclosed glumes (ucgl). Abbreviations: 13-LOX: 13-lipoxygenase, 13-HPOT: (13S)-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic,
  13-AOS: 13-allene oxide synthase, AOC: allene oxide cyclase, 12-OPDA: 12-oxo-phytodienoic
