caption: '(A) The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is formed by endothelial cells in the
  cerebral capillaries. These endothelial cells interact with perivascular elements
  such as basal lamina and closely associated astrocytic end-feet processes, perivascular
  neurons and pericytes to form a functional BBB. (B) Cerebral endothelial cells form
  complex tight junctions (TJ) produced by the interaction of several transmembrane
  proteins that effectively seal the paracellular pathway. These complex molecular
  junctions make the brain practically inaccessible for polar molecules, unless they
  are transferred by transport pathways of the BBB that regulate the microenvironment
  of the brain. The adherens junctions (AJ) stabilize cell–cell interactions in the
  junctional zone. The presence of intracellular and extracellular enzymes, such as
  monoamine oxidase (MAO), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), alkaline phosphatase,
  peptidases, nucleotidases and several cytochrome P450 enzymes, endow this dynamic
  interface with metabolic activity. Large molecules such as antibodies, lipoproteins,
  proteins and peptides can also be transferred to the central compartment by receptor-mediated
  transcytosis or nonspecific adsorptive-mediated transcytosis. The receptors for
  insulin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), iron transferrin (Tf) and leptin are all
  involved in transcytosis.P-gp: P-glycoprotein; MRP: Multidrug resistance-associated
