caption: 'RNA Sensing and ResponseNon-comprehensive overview of the most relevant
  RNA sensing receptors at the relevant localizations, with their downstream signaling
  molecules and some of the functional outcomes and secondary consequences as applicable
  (e.g., RIG-I sensing of RNaseL degradation products). RNA sensing receptors are
  in gray, signaling molecules in yellow, nucleases in green, inflammasome pathways
  is purple, and cell death pathways in orange. Unlike other TLRs, TLR3 signals from
  the cell surface and the endolysosome. TLR3 is a sequence-independent sensor of
  the ribose-phosphate backbone of dsRNA > 35bp and of incomplete dsRNA stem structures
  of sufficient length within ssRNA molecules. TLR3 signals via TRIF to induce IFN-β
  and NF-KB signaling. TLR7 and TLR8 are activated by RNA degradation products, with
  the first pocket binding guanosine and uridine (TLR7 and TLR8, respectively), and
  the second pocket binding short di- or trinucleotides. TLR8 activation requires
  upstream endosomal RNase activity (RNaseT2, RNase2) and, due to homology, RNase
  activity is likely required for TLR7 as well. TLR7 activation induces IFN-α via
  the MyD88-TRAF6-IRF7 pathway. TLR8 activation releases IFN-β and proinflammatory
  cytokines via a TAK1-IKKβ-IRF5 pathway. TLR adaptor interacting with SLC15A4 on
  the lysosome (TASL) was reported as a signaling component linking endolysosomal
  TLR7 and 8to IRF5. TLR13 recognizes bacterial 23S rRNA in a sequence-specific manner.
  Upon activation, the cytosolic immune sensors RIG-I and MDA-5 oligomerize thereby
  inducing polymerization of MAVS into fibrillar structures leading to the recruitment
  of TRAF2, TRAF6, IKK, and TBK1, which then activate NF-KB and IRF3 and/or IRF7 signaling.
  In addition, MAVS complexes can associate with FADD, RIP1, and caspase 8 and induce
  apoptosis downstream of MAVS. DDX3, DHX15, DHX36, and DDX60 enhance RIG-I signaling.
  DHX29 acts as co-receptor for both RIG-I and MDA5. LGP2 supports filament formation
  by MDA5 but may compete with RIG-I for ligand. Cytosolic RNA sensors with direct
  anti-viral activity include protein kinase R (PKR) and the 2’-5′-oligoadenylate
  synthetase system (OAS) which both bind dsRNA > 30bp including polyI:C. PKR phosphorylates
  elF2a and inhibits cap-dependent translation of viral and host mRNA. OAS induces
  the formation of 2′5′oligoadenylate which acts as a second messenger to activate
  ribonuclease L (RNase L), which in turn degrades cellular RNA and viral RNA to smaller
  RNA molecules that can be sensed by RIG-I and DHX33. DHX33 activates the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  inducing pyroptotic cell death. IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats
  (IFIT) sequester viral mRNA and block their translation by sensing 5′ termini. IFIT1
  binds mRNA with a cap0 structure (7mGpppNN), and IFIT1B binds cap0, to a lesser
  extent cap1 (7mGpppNmN) structures but not cap2 (7mGpppNmNm) structures. b binds
  uncapped 5′ triphosphate RNA, and IFIT2 which binds AU-rich RNA. DDX17 can bind
  and sequester stem loop structures from some RNA viruses. Adenosine deaminase acting
  on RNA 1 (ADAR1) catalyzes the C6 deamination of adenosine to inosine in base-paired
  regions of RNA, and the resulting non-synonymous coding causes amino acid substitutions
  and potentially renders viral proteins non-functional. The host RNA decay machinery
  includes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), 5′-3′ RNA degradation and the 3′-5′
  RNA exonuclease machinery (RNA exosome). NMD targets mRNA transcripts with a long
  3′ UTR but also senses viral RNA. The 5′-3′ degradation machinery with the decapping
  enzymes DCP1 and DCP2 and the 5′-3′ exonuclease XRN1 (XRN-DCPs) is involved in physiological
  cellular mRNA turnover and exhibits antiviral activity. The superkiller viralicidic
  activity 2-like (SKIV2L) and zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) support the binding
  and transport vRNA to the RNA exosome for degradation. The ISG and viral restriction
  factor Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP-1) is a death receptor downstream of dsRNA sensing.
  ZBP-1 activates multiple programmed cell death pathways, including pyroptosis, apoptosis,
  and necroptosis, termed PAN-optosis. Upon dsRNA binding, ZBP-1 interacts with RIPK3
  supported by caspase-6, resulting in MLKL activation and necroptosis, in caspase-8-induced
  apoptosis and in NLRP3 dependent inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. Three inflammasome-building
  NLRs participate in cytosolic RNA sensing: DHX33 via NLRP3, the RNA helicase DHX9
  via Nlrp9b (human homolog NLRP9), and the RNA-binding accessory protein DHX15, besides
  its supporting function for RIG-I-like helicases, via NLRP6.'
