caption: Model depicting auxin- and cytokinin-mediated signaling pathways involved
  in nodule development. To develop this model, we combined data from studies using
  L. japonicus and M. truncatula. Based on the observation that NSP2 is required for
  the induction of NIN (), we placed NIN downstream of NSP2. Since control of PIN
  proteins (PINs) localization seems to occur in the downstream part of the cytokinin
  signaling pathway () and NIN has an ability to induce localized auxin responses
  (), we suggest that the site of PINs regulation is downstream of NIN. A putative
  shoot-derived inhibitor (SDI) is proposed as a negative regulatory signal of nodule
  development mediated by the AON mechanism involving HAR1/SUNN, KLV, and nodulation-related
  CLE peptides (CLEs) (; ). Here, we suggest that SDI might inhibit cytokinin and
  auxin actions. Proven and putative regulation points are indicated by intact lines
  and dotted lines, respectively. See text for more detailed explanations of the model.
