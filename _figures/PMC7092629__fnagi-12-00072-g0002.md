caption: 'Predicted protein-protein interactions in aSyn pathology: hypothesis and
  bioinformatic analysis. (A) Conceptual model of aSyn pathology induced by loss of
  co-translational and post-translational interactions due to mutations in aSyn or
  omission of partners. (B) Prediction of aSyn protein-protein interaction during
  biogenesis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen) was used to analyze
  possible aSyn interactions and pathways. aSyn gene SNCA was selected as the primary
  molecule (shown in the center). The initial analysis revealed 474 interacting proteins.
  The pathway was trimmed to only show proteins that are complexes, enzymes, kinases,
  phosphatases, groups, transcription regulators, translation regulators, transmembrane
  receptors, or transporters. Two-hundred and seventy-eight interacting proteins remained
  and were filtered based on their major functions. Functions examined are those involved
  in transcription (yellow), translation (green) folding/trafficking (blue), modification
  (purple), secretion (orange), mitochondrial (pink), and degradation (red). One-hundred
  and two interacting proteins remained. All filtering was done to specifically analyze
  the protein-protein interactions involved in aSyn biogenesis.'
