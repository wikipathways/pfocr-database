caption: Hypothesis of the impact of NR in the development of doxorubicin cardiomyopathy.
  It is a popular assumption that the development of doxorubicin (DOX) cardiotoxicity
  occurs due to the massive generation of ROS, which in turn is caused by a secondary
  mechanism due to the suppression of topoisomerase 2β. In consequence DNA damage
  increases, enzymes involved in its repair, PARPs and CD38, are activated, while
  the activity of sirtuins and NAMPT (the main pathway of NAD+synthesis through NAM
  under normal physiological conditions, Core Recycling Pathway) is suppressed, and
  the work of Complex I in the electron transport chain is disrupted, using NADH as
  an electron donor creating NAD+. Damage to Complex 1 and ATP production leads to
  accumulation of ROS that increase oxidative stress. Separately doxorubicin reduces
  tight junction formation by decreasing the expression of the occluded zone (ZO)−1,
  which can increase doxorubicin levels in the capillary endothelium of the heart
  muscle. This also reduces nitric oxide (NO) level by enzymatic inhibition, reducing
  the level of endothelin (ET)−1 accumulation of ROS []. All mechanisms lead to a
  significant decrease in NAD+ levels, the inability of the antioxidant system of
  the cardiomyocyte to cope with increased oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction,
  which ultimately leads to apoptosis of endothelial and cardiac cells. The administration
  of nicotinamide riboside (NR) can significantly increase the level of NAD+ through
  a less energy-intensive synthesis via NRK1/2. An increase in the level of NAD+ activates
  the work of sirtuins, which are able to induce antioxidant defense systems that
  restore mitochondrial biogenesis damaged by oxidative stress and promote the activation
  of autophagy, which is disturbed by doxorubicin leading to the accumulation of nondegradable
  autolysosomes. NMN synthesis via NR inhibits endothelial inflammation and improves
  NO-dependent function. Activation of endothelial SIRT1 controls endothelial homeostasis
  and vascular functionality by modulating the activity of endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase (eNOS), p53, angiotensin II receptor (Ang II), FOXO1 and other mechanisms
  [].
