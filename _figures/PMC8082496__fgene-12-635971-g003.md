caption: Evaluation of KEGG pathway coverage, data quality, and performance improvement
  with the 3-in-1 extraction method. (A) Enhanced coverage of specific molecular pathways
  by the identified proteins, metabolites, and lipids. In The red-colored boxes represent
  identified proteins and the red-colored circles are lipids and metabolites. (B)
  Mapping of the quantified proteins, metabolites, and lipids onto the KEGG metabolic
  pathways. (C) Principal component analysis (PCA) of relative levels of proteins,
  metabolites, and lipids obtained from three biological replicates under the four
  experimental conditions (WM, wild type mock; WP, wild type primed; dM, dir1 mock;
  dP, dir1 primed).
