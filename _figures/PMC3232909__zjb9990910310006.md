caption: Hypothetical model showing the role of CipB and CipI in S. mutans competence
  regulatory cascade. This model integrates the primary circuit sensing CSP, the ComDE
  two-component system, the ComR/ComS circuit, the CSP-inducible CipB bacteriocin,
  and its immunity factor, CipI. At low cell density (low CSP levels), the major competence
  system remains inactive and other systems, such as CiaHR (, ), HtrA (), and HdrMR
  (, ), induce a basal level of genetic competence. Both cipB and cipI genes are dependent
  on the ComE regulator for their transcription. However, the expression of cipI shows
  an additional level of density-dependent control via the LiaSR two-component system
  (). CipI then sequesters CipBin present at low concentrations and prevents its regulatory
  function. When the cell density reaches a critical threshold concentration (high
  CSP levels), the ComDE two-component system activates cipB gene expression, affecting
  the balance between CipB and CipI proteins. Unsequestered CipBin can act as a peptide
  regulator to activate competence gene expression via the ComE and/or ComR regulators
  (see text for additional details). CipBin, unprocessed intracellular form of CipB;
  CipBout, mature extracellular (outside) form of CipB. Solid arrows indicate processing
  steps or transcriptional regulation that has been previously demonstrated. Dashed
  arrows indicate hypothetical links.
