caption: 'Interaction of TGF-β Signaling with Sphingolipid Metabolism. TGF-β differentially
  regulates SPHK1 expression in a context-dependent manner and can upregulate ASAH1
  to promote aberrant accumulation of sphingosine. Ceramide, the only sphingolipid
  that can be de novo synthesized, has been shown to constrain TGF-β signaling. Overexpression
  of SGMS1, which catalyzes synthesis of sphingomyelin from ceramide, also inhibits
  TGF-β signal transduction. Moreover, sphingosine-1P can evoke TGF-β-like responses
  in cells (see text). For simplicity, synthesis of other sphingolipid and the downstream
  catabolism of sphingosine-1P have been omitted. Purple texts and arrows, the sphingolipid
  metabolic pathway; gray arrows, cell-type dependent effect. Abbreviations: SPHK1,
  sphingosine kinase 1; ASAH1, N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1; SGMS1, sphingomyelin
  synthase 1. Figure is created with BioRender.com.'
