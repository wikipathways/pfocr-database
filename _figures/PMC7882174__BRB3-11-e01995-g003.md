caption: Potential effect of leonurine on central nervous system diseases. It has
  a strong protective effect on the brain through a wide range of mechanisms. In ischemic
  stroke, leonurine has a good inhibitory effect on oxidative stress by regulating
  HDAC4/NOX4/MMP‐9 signal pathway through antioxidant activity. In traumatic brain
  injury, leonurine can improve brain injury through the mechanism of anti‐apoptosis
  and antioxidation. In Alzheimer's disease, leonurine can inhibit the overactivation
  of microglia and reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines NO, TNF‐α, IL‐1β,
  and IL‐6, which has obvious anti‐inflammatory effects. In Parkinson's disease, leonurine
  plays an important role in antioxidant stress, increases the ratio of Bcl‐2/Bax,
  and has neuroprotective effect. In depression, leonurine alleviates depression by
  inhibiting the activation of NF‐κB signal pathway and increasing the levels of 5‐HT,
  NE, and DA. In multiple sclerosis, leonurine reduces inflammation and myelin damage
  in the central nervous system by inhibiting the recruitment of autoimmune T cells
  to the central nervous system
