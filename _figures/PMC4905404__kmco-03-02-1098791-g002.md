caption: Regulators of phenotypic plasticity. There are several factors that promote
  bidirectional interconversion via activation of stemness factors. (Upper left panel)
  The TME and its accompanying cancer cells facilitate the transformation of healthy
  fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which secrete growth factors
  that promote interconversion in a Wnt- and Notch-dependent matter. (Upper right
  panel) Inflammation and infiltrating immune cells can activate the NF-κB pathway
  in non-stem cancer cells (NSCCs) and thereby induce dedifferentiation into cancer
  stem cells (CSCs). (Lower left panel) Hypoxia promotes a more stem cell-like phenotype
  via enhanced activation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α factors. (Lower right panel) Cellular
  stress induced by therapy can influence expression of drug efflux pumps and results
  in therapy resistance in NSCCs characteristic of CSCs, thereby indicating dedifferentiation.
  Numbers indicate relevant references.
