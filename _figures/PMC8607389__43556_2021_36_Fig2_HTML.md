caption: PI3K/Akt signaling-mediated by TREM2. DAP12-mediated TREM2 signaling have
  been discussed in the figure. The possible ligands with respect to Alzheimer’s disease
  for TREM2 are lipids, APOE as well as amyloid-β. In the physiological condition,
  upon tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12 ITAM leads to recruitment of Syk kinase along
  with the GRB/SOS1 and DOK3, which activates downstream signaling pathways of ERK,
  PLC-γ, PI3K/Akt as well as Vav. The activation of PLC-γ induces inflammatory cytokine
  response via DAG stimulation and anti-inflammatory cytokine response along with
  cell rearrangement and phagocytosis via elevating Ca2+response in the cell through
  IP3 activation. The main survival pathway of cell PI3K/Akt primarily activates mTOR
  pathway and Foxo that inhibit autophagy and induce cell survival, inhibits GSK-3β
  that eventually reduce Tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer’s disease and suppress IKK,
  which is involved in the inflammatory response. PI3K activation increase formation
  of PI 3,4,5-P3, an important phosphoinositide in the process of phagocytosis and
  migration. Syk recruitment activates Vav2/3 molecule via LAT phosphorylation, which
  induces actin cytoskeleton polymerization important for chemotaxis, migration, and
  phagocytosis. TREM2 is one of the disease-linked genes in Alzheimer’s disease, the
  AD-related variant generally present in Ig-like extracellular domain of the receptor,
  which includes R47H, R62H, D87N, T96K
