caption: Mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in GBM cells. Mitochondrial fusion‐associated
  proteins Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1‐L isoform (OPA1‐L) were expressed at reduced levels,
  and a reduction in CPT1 protein induced low expression of OPA1‐L, which reduced
  mitochondrial fusion and thus promoted cell invasion. KLF4 protein affects mitochondrial
  fusion and thus the cell cycle. The overexpression of DISC1, TRAP1, Rab32 protein,
  and HIF‐1 induces a hypoxic environment that promotes DRP1 protein‐mediated mitochondrial
  fission, which facilitates cell proliferation and invasion. overexpression of DPR1
  and OPA1‐S isoform promotes angiogenesis. FAM72A regulates mitochondrial fusion
  through the Pink1/Parkin signaling pathway. Pink1/Parkin signaling pathway to regulate
  mitophagy, thereby promoting glioma progression. Targeting of DNM1L at the BCL2L13
  Ser616 locus resulted in altered high mitochondrial autophagic fluxes, which significantly
  promoted GBM cell proliferation and invasion. FOXO3a generates drug resistance by
  promoting BNIP3‐mediated mitophagy
