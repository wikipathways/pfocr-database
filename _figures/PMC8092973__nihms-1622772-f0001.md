caption: When the replication machinery encounters a replication block (stop sign),
  replication fork progression stalls, leading to the formation of single-stranded
  DNA (ssDNA) that is rapidly coated by the RPA trimer (I). Restart of stalled forks
  can occur through lesion bypass by translesion synthesis or fork repriming (II-III).
  Translesion synthesis allows the direct bypass of the DNA lesion (II), while fork
  repriming promotes the restart of DNA synthesis downstream of the lesion (III).
  Alternative to lesion bypass, stalled forks can undergo reversal mediated by fork
  remodelers, including the SNF2-family members SMARCAL1, ZRANB3 and HLTF (IV). Fork
  reversal slows down replication fork progression, thus allowing sufficient time
  for repair of the lesion. Reset of reversed forks by the RECQ1 helicase can then
  promote the restart of DNA synthesis once the lesion has been removed (V). Fork
  reversal could also directly promote the bypass of the DNA lesion by enabling DNA
  synthesis on the nascent DNA strand of the sister chromatid (green) through template
  switching (not shown). Following fork reversal, the exposed ends of the regressed
  fork are stabilized by RAD51 to limit fork resection by the nucleases MRE11, DNA2
  and EXO1 and protect the integrity of the fork (IV). Limited fork resection can
  facilitate fork restart through the reset of reversed forks or HR-dependent strand
  invasion catalyzed by the 3’-end of the resected regressed arm (not shown). BRCA1/2,
  RAD51 paralogs and Fanconi anemia proteins cooperate with RAD51 to control fork
  resection and maintain fork protection. Defective fork protection causes extensive
  fork resection and processing of the regressed fork by the endonucleases SLX4 and
  MUS81, leading to fork collapse (VI). Fork collapse can also result from MUS81-mediated
  cleavage of persistently arrested replication forks or from forks encountering single-strand
  DNA breaks. Collapsed forks are repaired by HR-mediated fork restart pathways dependent
  on RAD51 and/or RAD52 (VI-VIII). Key factors involved in each pathway and described
  in the main text are indicated.
