caption: Schematic diagram of the role of miR‐362 in cervical cancer. As a negative
  transcriptional regulator of BAP31, abnormal low expression of miR‐362 led to increased
  expression of BAP31 in CC. The combination of BAP31 and SPTBN1 blocked signal transduction,
  and TGFβ/Smad pathway was inhibited. As a result, cervical cancer cell proliferation
  is accelerated, and apoptosis is reduced. In contrast, cervical cancer cells overexpressing
  miR‐362 via treating with miR‐362 mimics exhibited a low level of BAP31 expression.
  Thus, SPTBN1 could bind to Smad 3, so that TGFβ/Smad pathway is activated to inhibit
  cell growth
