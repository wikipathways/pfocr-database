caption: Molecular mechanism by which Guttiferone K exerts anti-inflammatory effects
  in Mtb-infected macrophages. Through TLR2/TLR4 recognition, Mtb intrudes into the
  macrophage and then accelerates IRAK-1 phosphorylation to activate its downstream
  signaling pathways, including NF-κB, MAPK, and Akt/mTOR, causing inflammasome activation,
  increased production of inflammatory mediators, and autophagy inhibition, ultimately
  resulting in tissue damage. Guttiferone K targets the inhibition of IRAK-1 phosphorylation
  and then drives the inhibition of downstream NF-κB and Akt/mTOR, reducing the expression
  of inflammatory factors and promoting cell autophagy to alleviate inflammation-mediated
  tissue damage induced by Mtb.
