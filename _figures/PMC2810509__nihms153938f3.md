caption: 'The genes associated AVM formation (shown in red) lie in the TGFβ superfamily
  signaling pathway. TGFβ and BMPs bind to TGFβRII and BMPRII, respectively. Upon
  ligand binding, the type II receptors phosphorylate associated type I receptors
  (ALK1, 3, 4, 5, or 6). The ALKs in turn recruit and phosphorylate receptor-regulated
  Smads (Smads 1, 5, and 8 or Smads 2 and 3). The receptor-regulated Smads form complexes
  with the common mediator, Smad 4, and translocate to the nucleus to participate
  in regulating the transcription of target genes. Endoglin is a TGF-β co-receptor
  that can modulates signaling through either the TGF-β or BMP membrane-bound signaling
  complexes. Endoglin also exists in a soluble, extracellular form (sEndoglin) that
  can bind and sequester BMPs or TGF-βs. Mutations of the genes shown in red may lead
  to dysregulation of processes required for blood vessel wall stabilization. In susceptible
  patients, formation of an AVM may then result from a defective repair response to
  an otherwise minor insult. Abbreviations: ALK, activin-like kinase receptor; BMP,
  bone morphogenetic protein; BMP-RII, BMP receptor type II; sEndoglin, soluble Endoglin;
  TGF β, transforming growth factor β; TGF β -RII, TGF β receptor type II.'
