caption: Wnt and Shh pathway expression pattern prior to dental placode formation.
  Schematic of the E11 initiation stage of tooth development, before formation of
  the dental placode, and expression pattern of key regulatory genes. The circle indicates
  the prospective position of the dental placode, established at E11.5. During tooth
  initiation at E11, Wnt4, Wnt6, and Fzd6 (vertical shading) are expressed throughout
  the oral ectoderm, while Wnt5a, Sfrp2, and Sfrp3 are produced in the underlying
  mesenchyme (peach). In the oral ectoderm, Wnt3 and Wnt7b (dark blue) are expressed
  in a pattern mutually exclusive with Wnt10b, Shh, and Pitx2 (light blue), the latter
  being restricted to the prospective dental placode. Also, a rosette of oral epithelial
  cells (orange), characterized by Fgf8 expression, is located posteriorly to the
  placode.
