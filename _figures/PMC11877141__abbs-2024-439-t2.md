caption: 'Metabolic pathways involved in SM pyroptosis during OA pain onset and the
  interplay between the reactive components and those involved in other modes of cell
  deathHMGB1 binds to LPS and is transported to SMs via RNA, leading to SM pyroptosis.
  TNF stimulates further production of TNF by monocytes and SMs, which in turn creates
  positive feedback and promotes pyroptosis. Positive feedback. TNF-α triggers SM
  death by inducing the activation of caspase-3/GSDME signaling. Downregulation of
  DNA polymerase β leads to the accumulation of DNA damage and the leakage of cytoplasmic
  dsDNA, which activates the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/STING/NF-κB signaling pathway
