caption: Sulfur mustard inhalation causes injury and subsequent permeability of airways
  to blood-derived coagulation factors. Activation of the coagulation cascade occurs
  when extravascular TF present in airways binds FVII, converting it to FVIIa, followed
  by conversion of FX to active FXa. Factor Xa catalyzes the activation of prothrombin
  to thrombin, which in turn converts fibrinogen to fibrin. Excessive fibrin deposition
  causes airway occlusion by forming obstructive casts. TFPI is a serine protease
  inhibitor capable of binding active sites on both TF/FVIIa complex and FXa. By these
  inhibitory interactions, TFPI functions as the endogenous regulator of the TF-dependent
  coagulation. However, TFPI levels are insufficient to prevent airway coagulation
  during acute lung injury. Airway casts are removed by the fibrinolytic action of
  plasmin. PAI-1 is elevated in response to acute lung injury and blocks fibrinolysis
  by inhibiting the plasminogen activators uPA and tPA. This allows nascent airway
  casts to increase in size.
