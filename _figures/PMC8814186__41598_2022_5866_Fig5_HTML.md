caption: A summary of differentially expressed proteins related to the response of
  leaves to salt stress and the KEGG pathways involved. The protein is represented
  by a pink circle; the KEGG pathway it participates in is represented by a blue circle.
  The size of the blue circle represents the number of proteins involved in its pathway.
