caption: Schematic illustration for signaling pathways of skeletal muscle growth regulated
  by let-7b. let-7b can inhibit skeletal muscle development through let-7b-IGF2BP3-IGF2
  signaling pathway and let-7b-GHR-GHR downstream genes pathway in normal chicken.
  However, the large deletion mutation at the exon 10 and 3′UTR of GHR gene in dwarf
  chicken lead to disruption of let-7b binding site in GHR 3′UTR. In this case, let-7b
  would enhance its inhibition on IGF2BP3 expression. Therefore, let-7b inhibits skeletal
  muscle development only through let-7b-IGF2BP3-IGF2 signaling pathway with enhancing
  effect in dwarf chicken.
