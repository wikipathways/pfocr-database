caption: MWCNTg promote the EMT through the TGF-β-mediated Akt/GSK-3β/SNAIL-1 pathway.
  Normally, GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of nuclear SNAIL-1 mediates its subsequent
  degradation (a). MWCNTg stimulate in BEAS-2B cells TGF-β secretion, Akt activation
  and GSK-3β inhibition, which induces nuclear SNAIL-1 and its transcriptional activity.
  Contemporarily, GSK-3β inactivation stabilizes cytoplasmic β-catenin, which translocates
  to the nucleus contributing to keep “turned on” the EMT program (b)
