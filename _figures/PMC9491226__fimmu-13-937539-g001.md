caption: 'Schematic diagram of the study design. Fifteen patients with psoriasis underwent
  16 weeks of MTX therapy and then their clinical improvement was assessed. Eight
  subjects were assigned to the good response group [at least 75% improvement in PASI
  (PASI ≥ 75)], while six subjects were assigned to the poor response group [less
  than 50% improvement (PASI < 50)]. Only one was categorized between these two groups.
  Fecal samples and blood samples of all 15 patients were collected before and after
  the treatment. The fecal samples were further investigated by metagenomic sequencing,
  and the biological information, such as community composition, KO genes, and pathway
  profiles, was extracted. Metabolites in blood samples were analyzed using an untargeted
  LC-MS/MS approach. Both omics data were used to screen for the signature associated
  with differential efficacy. Paired-sample comparison between the pre- and post-treatment
  was also performed. Further integration of the two omics data occurred on three
  levels: (i) assessment of the structural similarity between metabolome and microbiota
  profile (by Procrustes analysis); (ii) correlation analysis between the signatures
  mentioned above (Spearman rank correlations); and (iii) correlation analysis between
  microbial function modules and blood metabolite clusters ().'
