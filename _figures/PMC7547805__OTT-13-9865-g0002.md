caption: The regulatory mechanisms of TEAD in cancer biology. Upstream Hippo signaling
  pathway and downstream transcriptional outputs of TEAD4. TEAD4 associates with transcriptional
  factors such as TCF-4, ERα, AP-1, and IRF3 to enhance the stability of the transcriptional
  complex. The TEAD4 transcriptional outputs play critical roles in cancer progression,
  metastasis as well as stem cell maintenance. VGLL proteins directly compete with
  YAP for TEAD4 binding. Tead4 is the unique member of the TEAD family to localize
  to the mitochondrion and maintain mitochondrial energy homeostasis. TEAD4-S is a
  truncated isoform of TEAD4 spread in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, which inhibits
  proliferation and EMT in cancer cells.
