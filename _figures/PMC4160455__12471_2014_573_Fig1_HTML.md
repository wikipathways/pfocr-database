caption: Multiple mechanisms lead to the development of PPCM in mice. Changes in the
  PGC1α or STAT3 expression lead to aberrant activation of MnSOD and lead to inadequate
  antioxidant activity in cardiomyocytes (red cell). Increased levels of ROS lead
  to increased cathepsin D (CD) production. When cathepsin D is secreted into the
  blood and interacts with prolactin (PRL) that is secreted by the pituitary gland
  during pregnancy, it cleaves PRL to form 16 kDa prolactin. This truncated form of
  prolactin can activate the NF-κB pathway in endothelial cells (blue cell) and ultimately
  induces transcription of microRNA-146a (miR-146a). Endothelial exosomes are loaded
  with miRNA-146a and, following secretion, are taken up by surrounding cardiomyocytes
  where it inhibits metabolic activities via Erbb4, Nras, Notch1, and Irak1. Additionally,
  MiRNA-146a inhibits proliferation and promotes cell death in endothelial cells.
  Combined with inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by sFLT1 secretion
  by the placenta, this subsequently leads to angiogenic imbalance, further deteriorating
  cardiac function during pregnancy
