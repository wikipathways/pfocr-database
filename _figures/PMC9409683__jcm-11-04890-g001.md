caption: A scheme of estrogen receptors and the intracellular signaling pathway. In
  genomic pathway, 17β-estradiol (E2) binds to estrogen receptor α and estrogen receptor
  β in the cytoplasm. It forms dimer and translocates to the nucleus. Then, they bind
  to estrogen receptor element (ERE) and activate the transcription of downstream
  genes (classical genomic pathway). Or, they interact with other transcription factor
  (TF)s, such as NF-κB, specificity protein 1 (SP1), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and
  CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ), and prevent their binding to the transcription
  factor regulatory element (TFRE) (non-classical genomic pathway), leading to the
  regulation of their target gene expression. In non-genomic pathway, E2 binds to
  G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) and it regulates mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), calcium (Ca) release, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP). Created with Biorender.com.
