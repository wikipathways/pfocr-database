caption: Summary of lipid metabolism, as it pertains to the p53 family. The mevalonate
  pathway is out lined in the upper half. Fatty acid oxidation and synthesis are portrayed
  in the lower half. Proteins marked with an asterisk are regulated by the p53 family.
  FAO, fatty acid oxidation; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; FAS, fatty acid synthesis;
  ACSL, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferase; ACLY,
  ATP citrate lyase; MLYCD, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
  FASN, fatty acid synthase; SREBP2, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2.
