caption: Mechanistic links between diet and fly tumor progression. Fly tumor cells
  take advantages of the metabolic pathways, nutrient-sensing machinery and systemic
  regulation to progress in response to elevated circulating levels of glucose as
  well as insulin upon dietary changes. (A) Upon a high-sugar diet, elevated glucose
  levels promote the transformation of EGFR hyperplasia into neoplasia in a LDH-dependent
  manner. (B) Upon a high-sugar diet, elevated glucose levels promote Hipk tumorigenesis
  through the HBP/OGT axis. Activated Hipk promotes upregulation of Myc and subsequent
  glucose uptake, which further stimulates the HBP flux. (C) Upon a high-protein diet,
  elevated insulin levels enable scrib−/− clones to proliferate instead of being eliminated.
  Mechanistically, insulin activates InR/TOR signaling that drives protein synthesis
  and confers growth advantages over the neighboring wild-type cells. (D) Upon a high-sugar
  diet, elevated insulin levels activate two tightly linked signaling loops in the
  RasV12 csk−/− tumor model. This feedback circuitry drives metastasis-like behaviors
  cell autonomously and causes wasting phenotypes in distant organs, such as skeletal
  muscle. Bnl, branchless; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; GLUT1, glucose transporter
  1; HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; InR, insulin receptor; OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase;
  Path, pathetic (SLC36 in mammals); SIK, salt-inducible kinase; TOR, target of rapamycin.
