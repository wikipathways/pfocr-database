caption: Summarized targets for future therapeutic interventions of CRPC within the
  AR signaling pathway and AR adaptive responses. The level of increased AR protein
  in CRPC is in part regulated at mRNA level. In addition to its cognate hormone,
  the AR is activated by tyrosine kinase and MAPK signaling, leading to dissociation
  of heat shock proteins (HSP). HSPs might thus present targets of intervention into
  AR signaling []. Further steps of AR signaling are the translocation to the nucleus,
  DNA binding and regulation of AR target gene expression. Besides the wild-type (wt)
  AR, isoforms and mutants of AR exist for which the inhibition is also an important
  future goal for treatment of CRPC. Detection of activated individualized pathways
  that activate the AR may allow using highly specific inhibitors in combination therapies.
  Inhibitors of specific AR activation signaling are highlighted in red color.
