caption: 'Schematic model of the ER quality control system. Selected components are
  depicted in this model. (A) Cotranslational translation: The ER signal sequence
  of a newly synthesized polypeptide is bound by a signal-recognition particle (SRP).
  The SRP–ribosome complex is guided to the Sec complex by an ER membrane-localized
  SRP receptor. After release of the SRP and SRP receptor, the polypeptide begins
  translocation. Subsequently, the signal sequence is processed by the signal peptidase
  (SP) complex (). Transfer of oligosaccharides is catalyzed by the oligosaccharyl
  transferase (OST) complex, and the two outermost glucose residues are sequentially
  removed by glucosidases I and II. (B) Posttranslational membrane insertion: a tail-anchored
  (TA) protein is posttranslationally inserted into the ER membrane. The carboxy-terminal
  single trans-membrane domain of the TA protein is recognized by the Bat3 complex
  and transferred to the cytoplasmic chaperone TRC40 for targeting to the ER-membrane
  localized Get1/2 receptor. (C) CNX/CRT cycle: a monoglucosylated N-glycan of the
  polypeptide recruits the ER lectin chaperones, calnexin (CNX) and/or calreticulin
  (CRT), which promote proper folding by preventing aggregation and premature export
  from the ER. ERp57, a CNX/CRT-bound oxidoreductase, catalyzes disulfide formation.
  Trimming of the innermost glucose residue by glucosidase II then releases the polypeptide
  from CNX/CRT. UDP-glucose/glycoprotein glucosyl transferase (UGGT) monitors the
  folding state of released glycoprotein and, if the correct conformation has not
  been achieved, UGGT reglucosylates it to be reengaged by CNX/CRT. (D) ER exit: The
  natively folded protein is released from the CNX/CRT cycle and transported to its
  destination. In the early secretory pathway, lectins (ERGIC53, VIP36, and VIPL)
  support the sorting or trafficking of glycosylated proteins from the ER to the Golgi
  (; ). “[ ]” indicates that there are several possibilities for N-glycan formation.
  (E) Degradation pathways: Terminally misfolded proteins are degraded primarily through
  ER-associated degradation (ERAD) or autophagic degradation. Before degradation,
  N-glycans on ERAD substrates are extensively trimmed for efficient degradation,
  possibly in a specific compartment within the ER known as the ER quality control
  (ERQC) compartment, where ERAD machineries such as ER mannosidase I and EDEM family
  proteins are enriched. Subsequently, ERAD substrates are retrotranslocated into
  the cytosol, possibly through an E3 ligase complex, and finally degraded by the
  ubiquitin proteasome pathway. A recent report suggests that misfolded TA proteins
  are also degraded by the ERAD pathway (). Autophagy also degrades some ERAD substrates,
  but its recognition mechanism is not well understood.'
