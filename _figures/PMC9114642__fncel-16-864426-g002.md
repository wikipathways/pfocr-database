caption: Endoplasmic reticulum stress is a harmful process that induces apoptosis
  mediated by CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP), caspase-12,
  and JNK. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) dissociates from protein kinase R-like
  endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), ATF6, and IRE1 and ultimately initiates proapoptotic
  signaling pathways by activating CHOP. All three pathways of the UPR can induce
  CHOP activation. Phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (IF2α) can promote
  ATF4 expression and then activate the expression of the downstream protein CHOP
  and induce cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the translation of CHOP is regulated by
  ATF6. CHOP can increase the expression of Bim, death receptor 5 (DR5), Bax, and
  Bak and inhibit the expression of Bcl-2 to play a proapoptotic role. The IRE1 pathway
  and caspase-7 pathway can cause activation of caspase-12. Activated caspase-12 promotes
  the activation of caspase-3/9 and eventually leads to apoptosis. TRAF2 recruits
  and activates ASK1, which subsequently phosphorylates and activates JNK.
