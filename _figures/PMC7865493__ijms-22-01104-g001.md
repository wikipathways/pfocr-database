caption: 'Schematic overview of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathways:
  canonical (A) and noncanonical (B). In physiological conditions, AhR is localized
  in the cytosol and complexed with specific proteins, such as the hepatitis B virus
  X-associated protein 2 (XAP-2), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), c-Src and p23. Upon
  ligand binding, AhR changes its conformation and is translocated to the nucleus,
  where it dimerizes with AhR nuclear transporter (ARNT) (A) or other partners, such
  as transcription factors (e.g., Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6)). (B). Dissociated
  c-Src interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). To date, several
  different types of crosstalk between AhR and other proteins have been described.
  For instance, AhR interaction with the hyperphosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma
  protein (Rb) results in growth arrest at the G1/S phase of the cell cycle []. AhR
  signaling may also promote nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cell (NF-κB) activation via RelA and RelB interaction [,,]. Moreover, AhR signaling
  is associated with the activity and function of the estrogen receptor []. The AhR/ARNT
  complex binds to the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) and induces the transcription
  of AhR-responsive genes (e.g., CYP1A1). On the other hand, AhR ligation promotes
  the transcription of its inhibitor—the AhR repressor (AhRR). AhRR forms a heterodimer
  with ARNT and competes with AhR/ARNT to bind to the XRE sequence, inhibiting AhR-induced
  transcription. However, previous studies suggest that AhR repression may not occur
  solely by inhibition of the DNA binding site and AhR/ARNT complex formation [,].
  Moreover, Wilson et al. indicated that AhR–KLF6 complex formation may be involved
  in cell cycle regulation []. AhR and KLF6 proteins form a heterodimer that recognizes
  novel nonconsensus XRE (NC-XRE), highlighting a distinction from the XRE-dependent
  AhR signaling mechanism. This noncanonical signaling pathway may influence cell
  cycle regulation, as it controls the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
  p21Waf1/Cip1 []. Jackson et al. revealed that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
  (TCDD)-mediated p21Waf1/Cip1 activation is associated with disrupted liver regeneration
  []. Therefore, while the KLF6-mediated noncanonical AhR signaling pathway might
  suppress tumor growth by regulating p21Waf1/Cip1 expression, carcinogenic AhR agonists
  might activate the canonical AhR signaling pathway and promote tumorigenesis. As
  outlined above, AhR might influence cell survival by various mechanisms. However,
  AhR might also interact with different genes that have a similar binding pattern,
  such as STC2 gene, encoding a glycoprotein responsible for the regulation of endoplasmic
  reticulum stress []. Vogel et al. revealed that AhR forms a complex with NF-κB subunit
  RelB. The NF-κB-RelB-binding site is targeted by AhR and promotes the expression
  of chemokine genes, such as BAFF, BLC, and IRF3 []. Furthermore, Ge et al. identified
  Rb as an AhR dimerization partner, suggesting its role in cell cycle arrest [].
  Recently, Huang et al. described a novel NC-XRE in the promoter of the gene encoding
  plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) that might be targeted by a distinct protein
  complex []. However, further investigations are needed to determine the contribution
  of canonical and noncanonical AhR signaling pathways to cell homeostasis. The scheme
  is based on previously reported data [,,].'
