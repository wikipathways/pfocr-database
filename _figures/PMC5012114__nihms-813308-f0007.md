caption: 'Schematic representation of the proposed crosstalk between PC1 and calcineurin/NFAT
  signalling in hPDL cells under mechanical stimulation. The extracellular N-terminal
  part of PC1 acts as a mechanosensor that responds to the external mechanical stimulus
  applied onto the cell. As a result, PC1 activates the calcineurin (CN)/NFAT pathway
  by allowing the dephosphorylation of NFAT []. Activation of the NFAT pathway may
  possibly involve interaction and complex formation between PC1 and PC2 (depicted
  as green shadow), requiring, however, further experimental verification (red question
  mark). The active form of NFAT then translocates to the nucleus were it can modulate
  runx2 gene expression, a crucial osteoblastic gene that influences osteoblast differentiation.
  Putative NFAT-binding sites in the runx2 promoter based on literature [] and computational
  analysis are shown. PC1: petrol blue; PC2: green shadow; mechanical stimulus: orange
  lightning; pNFAT (phosphorylated, inactive form): purple oval with attached red
  circle indicating phosphate group; NFAT (dephosphorylated, active form): purple
  oval; runx2 promoter: black line with purple rectangulars demarcating putative NFAT-binding
  sites'
