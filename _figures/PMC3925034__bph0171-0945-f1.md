caption: Schematic depiction of some of the Ca2+ channels, pumps and exchangers involved
  in Ca2+signalling in mammalian cells. Ca2+ influx channels include the ORAI1 channel
  (an example of a store-operated Ca2+ entry channel), L-type Ca2+ channels (an example
  of a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel), P2X receptor channel (an example of a ligand-gated
  Ca2+ channel) and TRP channels (channels that vary in their Ca2+ selectivity). GPCRs
  increase [Ca2+]CYT via PLC-mediated generation of IP3 and activation of IP3R. [Ca2+]CYT
  levels are sustained at low levels through the active efflux of Ca2+ by PMCAs and
  Na+/Ca2+ exchangers on the plasma membrane. Sequestration of Ca2+ into the ER Ca2+
  store is mediated by SERCA, into the mitochondria by mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter
  (MCU) and into the Golgi by secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase (SPCA). Increases in [Ca2+]CYT
  can result in the activation of calcineurin (CaN) that phosphorylates the transcription
  factor NFAT, which after translocation into the nucleus regulates gene transcription
  (Crabtree, ). Calcium can also activate many cytosolic proteins with Ca2+-sensitivity
  confirmation and activities such as calpain, which can regulate a number of important
  cellular processes including cytoskeletal remodelling and motility (Storr et al.,
  ).
