caption: Simplified model of translation initiation. In the canonical cap-dependent
  initiation pathway in eukaryotes (reviewed in ), the eIF2·GTP·methionyl-initiator
  transfer RNA (Met-tRNAiMet) ternary complex (TC) precedes mRNA in binding to the
  40S ribosomal subunit. A latch (blue) between the head and body of the vacant 40S
  subunit blocks mRNA binding. Binding of eIF1 and eIF1A opens the latch and creates
  a new connection (denoted in grey and marked by an asterisk). Subsequent binding
  of the eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet TC (GTP is denoted by a green circle), eIF5 and eIF3
  generates the 43S pre-initiation complex. For simplicity, only the eIF3j subunit,
  which binds near the A-site of the 40S ribosome, is depicted. Secondary structure
  in the mRNA prevents ribosome association; the helicase eIF4A unwinds the structure
  and facilitates ribosome binding in conjunction with eIF4B/eIF4H, eIF4E, eIF4G and
  PABP. The 43S complex binds to the mRNA near the cap and scans in a 3′ direction.
  Recognition of the AUG start codon through base pairing with tRNAiMet triggers eIF1
  displacement and release of Pi from eIF2·GDP (GDP is denoted by a red circle; ;
  ). Subsequent release of eIF5, eIF2·GDP and eIF3, and association of eIF5B·GTP through,
  in part, the carboxyl terminus of eIF1A, promotes 60S subunit association. Formation
  of the 80S ribosome triggers GTP hydrolysis and release of eIF5B and eIF1A, and
  the ribosome proceeds to translation elongation (; ; ). eIF2, eukaryotic initiation
  factor 2; n, 40S neck; mRNA, messenger RNA; PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; Pi, inorganic
