caption: A The increases of CEBPβ–NFκB interaction enhance NFκB DNA binding activity,
  facilitating the transcription of NFκB target genes. The upregulation of CEBPβ and
  NFκB downstream genes, proinflammatory cytokines, could increase the releases of
  inflammatory factor from the microbubbles or exosomes secreted by microglia or astrocytes.
  NFκB-mediated increases and activation of BACE1 prompt the amyloidogenic processing
  of APP, followed by the γ-secretase cleavage, leading to the Aβ production by the
  neuron. Chronic inflammatory conditions and Aβ depositions exacerbate the binding
  of CEBPβ-NFκB, deteriorating the AD-like pathology. B CA provides neuroprotective
  effects by preventing the nucleus translocation of NFκB, reducing the expressions
  of proinflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, CA reduces the CEBPβ–NFκB interaction and
  alleviates Aβ aggregation via inhibiting the amyloidogenic proteolytic pathway of
  APP.
