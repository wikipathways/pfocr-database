caption: NF-κB signaling pathways regulating neurite growth from cultured neurons.In
  the canonical pathway (a,b), activated IKKβ phosphorylates (P) IκBα at Ser32 and
  Ser36, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, allowing
  the released p65/p50 dimer to translocate to the nucleus. IKKβ can also phosphorylate
  p65 at the Ser 536 residue, which switches NF-κB to a neurite growth-inhibitory
  function. Of the many extracellular signals that activate the canonical pathway,
  TNFα binding to tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) is among the most extensively
  studied  and is known to operate in sympathetic neurons with resultant p65 phosphorylation
  and axonal growth inhibition (a) . TNFR1 ligation results in receptor trimerization
  and the recruitment of several adapter proteins (TNFR1-associated death domain protein,
  TRADD; receptor interacting protein 1, RIP1; TNFR-associated factors, TRAF2 and
  TRAF5) and the IKK complex, which results in IKKβ phosphorylation by the participation
  of additional proteins recruited to the signaling complex (not shown). Canonical
  signaling without significant levels of phospho-S536–p65 facilitates BDNF-promoted
  axonal growth from nodose ganglion neurons during an E18–P1 developmental window
  (b) , although the upstream activators of this pathway have yet to be identified.
  In the TK-dependent pathway (c,d), IκBα is phosphorylated at Tyr42, resulting in
  its dissociation (with or without degradation) from the p65/p50 dimer and translocation
  of the latter to the nucleus, and subsequent enhancement of neurite growth. In nodose
  ganglion sensory neurons (c), binding of BDNF to TrkB during an E15 to E17 developmental
  window results in phosphorylation of IκBα by Src and Lrk , whereas CNTF signaling
  during perinatal development activates the tyrosine kinase SYK, which in turn phosphorylates
  IκBα, leading to its removal without proteasome-dependent degradation . In hippocampal
  neurons (d), binding of NGF to the p75NTR receptor results in PTPB1-dependent phosphorylation
  of IκBα by the tyrosine kinase Src .
