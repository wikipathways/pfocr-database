caption: Cotargeting the PI3K/AKT and AR pathways in CRPC. The administration of AR-targeted
  agents such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide is thought to promote the development
  of castration resistance due to the loss of negative feedback regulation of the
  PI3K/AKT pathway. The development of the PIP5K1α inhibitor, ISA-2011B, adds another
  tool for targeting the PI3K pathway, as well as provide the impetus to cotarget
  with inhibitors of RTK and AR signaling pathways in CRPC. TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
