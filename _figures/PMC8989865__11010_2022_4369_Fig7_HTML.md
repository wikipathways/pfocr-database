caption: Schematic diagram for the possible mechanism for activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  by TGF-β and autocrine loop formation in LX-2 cells. Priming signaling (signal 1)
  is activated through the TAK1-NF-κB signaling pathway in LX-2 cells by TGF-β. Secondary
  signaling activation (signal 2) is induced by ROS and is mediated by p-Smad2/3-NOX4
  signaling. IL-1β levels are increased by TGF-β-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation,
  and consequently IL-1R signaling pathways involve the accumulation of TGF-β in LX-2
  cells. Increased TGF-β acts as an autocrine signaling loop that activates the NLRP3
  inflammasome
