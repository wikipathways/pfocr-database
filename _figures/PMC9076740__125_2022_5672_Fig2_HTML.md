caption: Proposed glucose-sensitive metabolic cycles in functionally mature beta cells.
  The metabolic processing of glucose into TCA cycle intermediates with the resultant
  oxidative phosphorylation pathway is a core component of canonical GSIS. However,
  the processing of TCA-derived metabolites throughout a multitude of mitochondrial–cytosolic
  cycling reactions have also been shown to be a component of mature beta cell function.
  Genes that form core components of each cycle are shown in boxes outlined in the
  colour of the relevant cycle. Glycolytic intermediates may also act in the regulation
  of glucose-sensitive metabolism, together with interactions with elements of cellular
  energy-sensing machinery. F-1,6-BP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; αKG, α-ketoglutarate. This figure is available
  as part of a downloadable slideset
