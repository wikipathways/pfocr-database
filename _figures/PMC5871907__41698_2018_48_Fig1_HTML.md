caption: The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways that trigger nonresolving inflammation
  during hepatocarcinogenesis. The extrinsic pathway is driven by exogenous factors
  (e.g., the PAMPs from pathogens or DAMPs from dead cells), which are able to trigger
  a persistent inflammatory response by engaging the receptors expressed in the inflammatory
  cells and establish an inflammatory condition that increase cancer risk. On the
  other hand, the intrinsic pathway is induced by alterations in cancer-associated
  genetic factors (e.g., mutation of either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes),
  which activate the expression of inflammation-related program. Both of these pathways
  activate transcription factors (e.g., NF-κB, STAT3) that coordinate the production
  of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, ROS, NOS, prostaglandins
  and so on, generating a pro-tumoric inflammatory microenvironment in the liver
