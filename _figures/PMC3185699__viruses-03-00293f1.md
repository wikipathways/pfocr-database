caption: Proposed signaling pathway to the actin cytoskeleton during HIV-1 entry in
  T lymphocytes. (a) Mature free virions (step 1) are initially captured by unspecific
  binding to glycoproteins covering the target cell such as glycosaminoglycans (GAG,
  step 2) or cell surface molecules such as LFA-1 or DC-SIGN (step 3). Subsequent
  specific binding of gp120 to CD4 initiates signaling to moesin, Arp2/3 and filaminA
  (step 4), resulting in entry receptor clustering (step 5). This allows gp120 to
  engage chemokine entry coreceptors to initiate receptor signaling, whose downstream
  effects include activation of cofilin (step 6). Active cofilin and Arp2/3 locally
  loosen the cortical actin cytoskeleton and provide motility (steps 7 and 8), to
  facilitate release of the viral core into the cytoplasm and transport through the
  cortical actin, respectively (steps 9 and 10). (b) Schematic representation of the
  current understanding of signaling cascades induced by gp120 through binding to
  CD4 (left panel) and CXCR4/CCR5 (right panel) during HIV-1 entry. Note that these
  pathways may be distinct in HIV-1 target cells such as macrophages that lack expression
  of T cell specific factors such as Lck.
