caption: During gastrulation, early, high BMP levels activate several NB-specifying
  genes and low BMP levels, controlled by the secretion of BMP antagonists, allow
  the expression of neural genes (e.g., SoxB1 transcription factors). The NB-specifying
  genes interact with each other to promote (black arrows) the formation of the NB
  zone, and they repress (red bars) the expression of neural genes. Indicated are
  the various interactions, described in the text, that result in the separation of
  the NB zone into the neural crest and the pre-placodal ectoderm (PPE). Contributing
  to this separation are several signaling pathways. Later, high levels of BMP promote
  an epidermal fate, but this pathway must be attenuated to produce neural crest and
  PPE. An FGF pulse is required for PPE formation. Wnt postitively regulates neural
  crest formation and represses PPE formation.
