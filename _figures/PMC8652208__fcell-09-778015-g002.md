caption: The effect of bone-derived factors on modules of musculoskeletal system.
  FGF23 affects muscle metabolism. It is associated with cardiomyocytes through FGFR4
  and acts on α-Klotho to change aortic smooth muscle. OPN affects skeletal muscles,
  and the increase in a certain range after injury will help recovery, but long-term
  increase of OPN will lead to muscle fibrosis and affect muscle function. SOST affects
  arthritis through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which can inhibit the activity
  of enzyme inhibitor RNA, promote subchondral bone sclerosis, and inhibit cartilage
  degradation.
