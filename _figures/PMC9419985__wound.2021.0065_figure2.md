caption: The acute signals of HSPCs in response to external stimulations such as infections
  or wound damage/tissue ischemia. Circulating cytokines, including G-CSF, M-CSF,
  IL-1, and IL-6 are increased in the acute phase of infectious diseases and tissue
  ischemia. G-CSF binds to G-CSF receptor and induces JAK/STAT pathway resulting in
  upregulation of genes related to granulopoiesis, such as C/EBPβ. M-CSF can also
  activate myeloid differentiation by inducing PU.1 activity, a key regulator of myeloid
  development, through Src-PI3K pathway. IL-1 and IL-6 regulate myelopoiesis by triggering
  a broad range of signaling pathways, including NF-κB and JAK-STAT pathway. PAMPs
  and DAMPs bind to TLR4 and lead to the activation of both MyD88-dependent pathway
  and TRIF-dependent pathway, causing emergency granulopoiesis. DAMPs, damage-associated
  molecular patterns; G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; HSPCs, hematopoietic
  stem progenitor cells; IL, interleukin; JAK, Janus kinases; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; PAMPs,
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Src, proto-oncogene
  tyrosine-protein kinase Src; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  protein; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing
  interferon-β.
