caption: Pathway illustrations of some of the most important metabolic perturbations
  observed with proton irradiation. The TCA cycle is severely impacted, hence overall
  energy metabolism, while changes in the tyrosine pathway and particularly the catecholamines
  may impact cognitive abilities.
