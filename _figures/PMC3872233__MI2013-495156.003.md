caption: The pathway of ethanol metabolism. Ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde
  by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the microsomal enzyme cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1).
  The ADH enzyme reaction is the main ethanol metabolic pathway involving an intermediate
  carrier of electrons, namely, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Acetaldehyde
  is rapidly metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in the mitochondria to acetate
  and NADH. And acetate is eventually metabolized in the muscle to carbon dioxide
  and water.
