caption: The functions of PGs and their subtypes. The subtypes of PGs have main roles
  in the pathophysiology of asthma. New drugs have been designed to target the PG
  pathway. DP2 receptor activation induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines,
  as well as the migration of eosinophils to the airways
