caption: Vesicular trafficking in the regulation of IS formation. Upon TCR stimulation,
  the T-cell receptor, as well as associated signaling molecules (e.g., LAT and Lck),
  are delivered to the IS via endosomal vesicles. The polarized trafficking of different
  molecules occurs through distinct trafficking routes within the “classical” recycling
  pathway regulated by the Rab5 and Rab11. TCR-polarized trafficking to the IS involves
  additional Rab GTPases, some components of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system,
  and the ciliogenesis protein CCDC28B that is essential for WAS-dependent actin polymerization
  on TCR+ endosomes. Lck associates with Rab11+ endosomal compartments, and its transport
  to the IS and sorting to the cSMAC are regulated by the uncoordinated 119 protein
  (Unc119), the membrane protein MAL, and Rab11-FIP3. LAT trafficking to the IS occurs
  through the classical Rab5 and Rab11 route, where anterograde transport is specifically
  regulated by GMAP210, IFT20, and VAMP7 and retrograde transport by Rab6 and Syntaxin-16.
