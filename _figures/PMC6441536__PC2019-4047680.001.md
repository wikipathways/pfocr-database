caption: Design and workflow for integrative analysis combining germline with somatic
  mutation information using gene expression data. RNA-seq read count data and somatic
  information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) via the Genomics
  Data Commons. Germline mutation information was manually curated from GWAS studies.
  Limma (R) package was used for the discovery of differentially expressed (DE) mutated
  and nonmutated genes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for functional analysis
  and discovery of molecular networks and biological pathways enriched for germline
  and somatic mutations.
