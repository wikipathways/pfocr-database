caption: A model of DELLA and ARF/IAA function. a DELLA protein negatively regulates
  GA responses. In the presence of GA, the formation of a GA-GID1-DELLA complex leads
  to degradation of the DELLA protein by the 26S proteasome pathway, which promotes
  the expression of target genes (top panel). In the presence of auxin, the formation
  of an ARF-IAA complex leads to degradation of the IAA protein by the 26S proteasome
  pathway, which regulates the expression of auxin response genes (bottom panel).
  b The regulation of fruit growth by DELLA and the SlARF7/SlIAA9 pathway during tomato
  fruit development. DELLA and SlARF7/SlIAA9 regulate the GA biosynthesis pathway
  antagonistically. The additive regulation of fruit growth–related genes by DELLA
  and SlARF7/SlIAA9. 1, Protein–protein interaction between DELLA and SlARF7/SlIAA9.
