caption: 'Cyclin B1‐CDK1 is imported into the prophase nucleus, where cyclin B1 binds
  to the MAD1 N‐terminus (i) and CDK1 phosphorylates the APC/C, which results in APC/C
  activation (ii). Cyclin B1 binding to MAD1 releases MAD1 along with MAD2 from the
  inner nuclear pore component TPR, perhaps by locally potentiating MPS1 activity
  toward TPR (i, iii). Free MAD1‐MAD2 is then recruited to the outer kinetochore by
  BUB1 to catalyze assembly of the MCC (iv), which is needed to antagonize rising
  APC/C activity (v). An MPS1 phosphorylation cascade plays a key role in SAC signaling:
  Phospho‐KNL1 recruits BUB1, phospho‐BUB1 recruits MAD1, and phosphorylation of the
  MAD1 C‐terminus is needed for MCC catalysis (iv). Cyclin B1‐CDK1 in turn phosphorylates
  MPS1 to promote its kinetochore localization and BUB1 to prime it for MPS1 phosphorylation.
  Thus, feedback between MPS1 and cyclin B1‐CDK1 activities ensures efficient SAC
  activation. In early prometaphase, kinetochores assemble an outermost domain, the
  corona, which facilitates microtubule capture (vi). Cyclin B1 anchors the MAD1 N‐terminus
  in the corona, and the highly elongated shape of the MAD1 coiled‐coil may allow
  its C‐terminus (and the associated MAD2) to reach the outer kinetochore to participate
  in MCC assembly. Since kinetochore recruitment of corona‐anchored MAD1‐MAD2 no longer
  depends on the KNL1‐BUB1 pathway, MAD1‐MAD2 can persist at kinetochores to catalyze
  MCC assembly even when MPS1 activity is decreased with small molecule inhibitors
  (“low MPS1 activity”). Thus, corona‐localized MAD1‐MAD2 makes SAC signaling more
  robust. This may become physiologically relevant when a single unattached kinetochore
  in late prometaphase needs to generate a strong enough checkpoint signal to inhibit
  the APC/C until that last chromosome is incorporated into the spindle.'
