caption: EBV-mediated critical cellular signaling is shown in HL and EBV-positive
  DLBCL of the elderly. LMP-1 gene polymorphisms associate with enhanced NF-κB activation,
  which not only increases the expression of cycling D1, BclXL, FLIP1, and Surviving
  to induce lymphomagenesis, but also inhibits apoptosis mediated by up-regulation
  of different anti-apoptotic proteins. MicroRNA, such as miR-34a, miR-155, contribute
  to EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly lymphomagenesis by up-regulation NF-κB activation,
  while North1 and BCL-6 down-regulate the NF-κB pathway activation.
