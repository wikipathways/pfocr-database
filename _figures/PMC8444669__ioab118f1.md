caption: Energy pathways in mammalian cells. Metabolic pathways involved in energy
  production in mammalian cells. OXPHOS is the most efficient pathway for ATP production.
  However, glycolysis in aerobic conditions has been reported in cancer (where pyruvate
  is mainly fermented in lactate) and in ESCs (where the pentose phosphate pathway
  is more active).
