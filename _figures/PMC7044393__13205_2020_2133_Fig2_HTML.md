caption: Overview of PAHs degradation pathway in P14. One solid arrow indicates one-step
  reaction and two solid arrows indicates two or more steps. Enzyme names were showed
  with the number of genes identified in the P14 genome. The PAHs were transformed
  to and acetyl CoA and succinyl CoA, then mineralized to CO2 via the TCA cycle
