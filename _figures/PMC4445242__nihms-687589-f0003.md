caption: A model of the changes in the phosphorylation of TCR signaling components
  that occurred after inhibition of ZAP-70 catalytic activity (represented by the
  blue line), illustrated as quantitative SILAC ratio heatmaps beside individual proteins,
  corresponding to the changes in phosphorylation between the inhibitor-treated and
  control cells across the four time points of TCR stimulation. Heatmaps were calculated
  from the average of five independent biological replicate experiments. Green represents
  increased phosphorylation, whereas red represents decreased phosphorylation in ZAP-70–inhibited
  cells relative to DMSO-treated controls. White dots within the heatmap indicate
  a statistically significant difference (q value < 0.05) for that time point and
  phosphopeptide. Below each heatmap square is a color bar representing the coefficient
  of variation for that point. Orange represents a high degree of variation, whereas
  black represents a low degree of variation amongst the replicate analyses.
