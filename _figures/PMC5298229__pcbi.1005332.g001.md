caption: A. Species with domain structures labeled. VEGF with three binding sites,
  two for binding to the receptors and a C-terminal binding domain for binding to
  NRP1. VEGFR2, with ligand binding site (L), receptor coupling site (C), and the
  tyrosine in the position 1175 (Y1175), VEGFR1 with ligand binding domain (L), receptor
  coupling site (C), and the NRP1 binding site (NRP1bd). NRP1 with the ligand binding
  site and the VEGFR2 binding site labeled (R1bd/L), B. The rule for the interaction
  of VEGF and VEGFR and subsequent dimerization included, C. The rule for ligand-independent
  interaction of VEGFR1 and NRP1, D. Ligand-independent dimerization of the receptors
  through the coupling sites (top). Ligand-dependent phosphorylation of the Y1175
  on VEGFR2 (bottom), E. Receptor-complexes undergo internalization and degradation
  from the plasma membrane, F. Signaling pathway for the activation of ERK1/2 downstream
  of phosphorylated Y1175 (pY1175), G. Elements of the calcium-cycling module of the
  model. Activated PLCγ results in the generation of IP3 that then diffuses and binds
  to and activates IP3 sensitive calcium release channels on the ER membrane. The
  decline in ER calcium concentration results in the opening of the calcium release
  activated calcium (CRAC) channels.
