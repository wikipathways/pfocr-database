caption: Biosynthetic pathway of melanin in A. fumigatus. White mutants obtained by
  Brakhage [] and Kwon-Chung [] had mutations in the ALB1 (also called PKSP) gene.
  Steps inhibited by commercialised DHN-melanin inhibitors are localized (Tc, tricyclazole;
  Pq, pyroquilon; Fx, fenoxanil). 1,3,6,8-THN, 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene; 1,3,8-THN,
  1,3,6,8-trihydroxynaphthalene; DHN, dihydroxynaphthalene (adapted from Tsai et al.
