caption: Age-related astrocytic and neuronal deficits leading to brain hypometabolism
  and current therapeutic strategies. Brain glucose hypometabolism is a hallmark of
  aging and neurodegeneration, as shown in particular by FDG PET studies (1). Resistance
  to Insulin has been proposed to account, at least in part, for this hypometabolism
  (2). Astrocytes and neurons both express insulin receptor (IR). Other key features
  of brain hypometabolism include reduced expression of GLUT1 on astrocytes and endothelial
  cells (3), decreased aerobic glycolysis (AG) in astrocytes (4) and consequent impaired
  release of lactate (5), reduced mitochondrial activity in neurons (6) and increased
  oxidative stress (7). Therapeutic strategies that aim at restoring brain energy
  metabolism include the use of ketone bodies as alternative energy source for neuronal
  mitochondrial OxPhos, either through ketogenic diet or medium chain triglycerides
  (8), targeting IR resistance either directly with intranasal Insulin (9) or Metformin
  (10), or via activation of GLP-1R (11). Another specific therapeutic approach consists
  in improving astrocytic AG (12), which results in increased glucose uptake and lactate
  release by astrocytes. Ac-CoA, acetyl-CoA; AcAc, acetoacetate; β-HB, β-hydroxybutyrate;
