caption: Phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in A. tumefaciens. In the PC synthase pathway,
  the integral membrane protein Pcs condenses CDP-DAG and choline to PC. Choline is
  taken up via the ChoXWV transporter. In the PmtA pathway, a single peripheral phospholipid
  N-methyltransferase (PmtA) converts PE via three successive methylations to PC.
  PmtA is stimulated by the anionic lipid PG and inhibited by PC and SAH. CM, cytoplasmic
  membrane.
