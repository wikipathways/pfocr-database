caption: Hemopoietic cell survival is regulated by exogenous concentrations of GM-CSF.
  The selective activation of the Ser585/14-3-3/PI-3 kinase survival-only pathway
  is triggered by low pM concentrations of GM-CSF (left). The alternative survival
  and proliferation pathway triggered by higher concentrations of GM-CSF is dependent
  on the dodecamer assembly and involves the Jak/STAT, Ras/mitogen-activated protein
  kinase, and PI-3 kinase pathways (right). The key receptor-proximal events that
  initiate these signaling pathways are the mutually exclusive phosphorylation of
  Ser585 and of Tyr577 of βc.
