caption: 'The mechanism of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and its potential role
  in Alzheimer’s disease. The ubiquitin–proteasome system includes two successive
  steps: ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Initially, ubiquitin is activated
  by a ubiquitin-activated enzyme (E1) in an ATP-dependent process. Then, the activated
  ubiquitin is transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating-enzyme (E2). Finally, E2 transfers
  the ubiquitin moiety from E1 to the target protein, which is recognized and tagged
  by the ubiquitin–protein ligase (E3). Following this tagging, the polyubiquitinated
  substrates are transported to the 26S proteasome for degradation by the proteasome.
  Meanwhile, the UPS serves as a critical way to remove the accumulation of abnormal
  proteins and prevent the progression of AD. For example, as an important E3 ligase
  in the UPS, Parkin not only interacts directly with Aβ and decreases its accumulation,
  but also indirectly increases the clearance of Aβ via the proteasomal dependent
  pathway. CHIP is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates Tau protein, thereby
  promoting the degradation of abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein. Moreover, the
  UCHL-1 is an E3 ligase and deubiquitination enzyme with the function of degrading
  abnormal protein and improving synaptic plasticity.'
