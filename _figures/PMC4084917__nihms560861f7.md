caption: By inhibiting the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of SREBPs,
  fatostatin decreases the expression of SREBP downstream target genes, including
  FASN, SCD-1, HMGCS1, HMGCR, MVK, MVD and LDLR, and further reduces the levels of
  intracellular fatty acid and cholesterol. Besides, fatostatin suppresses expression
  of AR and its target gene PSA. Through the concerted inhibition of lipogenesis,
  cholesterogenesis and the AR signaling pathway, fatostatin inhibits cell proliferation
  and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Reg, regulatory domain; bHLH, basic
  helix-loop-helix zipper domain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SRE, sterol regulatory
  element.
