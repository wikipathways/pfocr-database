caption: 'Adenosine production and signaling. Extracellular adenosine is generated
  in a stepwise process via multiple molecules. CD39 dephosphorylates ATP into AMP,
  which is then converted into adenosine via CD73. AMP can also be generated via sequential
  action of CD38 and CD203a. Alternative sources of extracellular adenosine production
  include alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and prostatic acid peptidase (PAP). Intracellular
  adenosine is regulated by the balance of the activity of adenosine kinase (AK) and
  cyto-5′NT/intracellular CD73 or the direct metabolism of S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH) by the enzyme S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH). Adenosine is transported
  into and out of the cell by equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) and signals
  predominantly via A2aR and A2bR on cells within the tumor microenvironment. Other
  abbreviations: CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast; DC, dendritic cell; MDSC, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cell; NK, natural killer.'
