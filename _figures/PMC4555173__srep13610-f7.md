caption: Newly identified octanoyltransferase (OctT) is highlighted red. The dashed
  line indicates a hypothetical regulatory role of OctT. Experimentally validated
  functions are shaded blue. Open boxes represent unknown functions or those lacking
  biochemical confirmation. R groups (red) on the structure indicate acyl chains (acetate,
  propionate, isobutyrate or succinate) and methyl groups are in green. 3-PGA, d-3-phosphoglyceric
  acid. GpgS, glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase; GpgP, glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate
  phosphatase; DggS, putative diglucosylglycerate synthase GgH, glucosylglycerate
  hydrolase (detected in rapidly-growing mycobacteria).
