caption: Structures and the generalized metabolic pathway of OP pesticides considered
  in this study. (A) The central structure represents the general structure for OP
  pesticides, where X can be a sulfur or an oxygen atom, and usually, no more than
  two sulfur atoms are bound to the phosphor atom. OTPs and OPOs contain a sulfur
  or an oxygen atom, respectively, which is connected via a double bond to the central
  phosphate. R1 and R2 are alkyl groups, typically methyl or ethyl, and sometimes
  propyl groups. R3 can be aromatic or aliphatic (Supporting Information table S1).
  (B) Metabolic scheme of OTP and OPO pesticides. In the liver, OTPs can be detoxified
  to urinary metabolites by CYP450-mediated oxidative cleavage, or they can be bioactivated
  to OPOs by CYP450-mediated oxidative desulfuration. OPOs can be detoxified to urinary
  metabolites by CYP450-mediated oxidative cleavage in the liver or hydrolysis by
  paraoxonase 1 (PON1) enzymes in the plasma and liver
