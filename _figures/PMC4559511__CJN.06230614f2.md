caption: Complement and adaptive immunity. (A) B cells express complement receptor
  2 (CR2; CD21), which binds to C3dg, a C3 breakdown product that functions as an
  opsonin. C3dg-coated antigens recognized by antigen-specific B-cell receptors plus
  CR2 initiate engulfment and lower the threshold of B-cell activation, promoting
  antibody production. (B) Cognate interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) (T-cell receptor [TCR] +CD28/80/86 or CD40/154) upregulate the expression
  of multiple alternative pathway components, including C3, C5, fB, fD, C3aR, and
  C5aR, while simultaneously downregulating decay accelerating factor (DAF) expression
  (lifting restraint on complement activation). Locally produced C3a and C5a act in
  an autocrine/paracrine manner through AKT signaling to promote maturation and cytokine
  production of APCs, Th1/IFN-γ expression, increased proliferation, and decreased
  apoptosis of T cells. (C) Regulatory T-cell generation, stability, and suppressive
  function are decreased by C3a and C5a signaling-induced AKT signaling, which impairs
  nuclear translocation of Foxo1, a transcription factor for FoxP3. AKT, phosphokinase
  B; pAKT, phosphorylated phosphokinase B; BCR, B cell receptor; iTreg, murine-induced
  regulatory T cell.
