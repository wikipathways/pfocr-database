caption: Scheme of the mevalonate pathway and isoprenoid synthesis. The mevalonate
  pathway (also known as the isoprenoid pathway) is an essential metabolic pathway
  in a human body producing a five-carbon building block called isopentenyl pyrophosphate
  (IPP). IPP is used to make fully functional biomolecules belonging into a large
  group of isoprenoids. Two intermediates in this pathway, FPP and GGPP, play also
  an immense role in post-translational modification of signaling proteins involved
  in a wide array of cellular functions including proliferation, and also carcinogenesis.
  The whole mevalonate pathway begins with acetyl-CoA, the rate limiting enzymatic
  step is catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase (a therapeutic target of statins), whose
  inhibition leads to depletion signaling isoprenoids. Continuous and dashed lines
  represent one and multistep reaction, respectively. HMG-CoA reductase can be blocked
  by statins (in red)
