caption: Regulator effect networks generated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) in
  MCF7 over-expressed mitochondrial fission factor (MFF). IPA analysis generated several
  regulator effect networks in MCF7 cells over-expressing mitochondrial fission factor
  (MFF). Both upstream regulators and downstream cellular responses were identified
  in relation to certain proteins significantly altered in our dataset. Upstream regulators
  are shown at the top while functions and phenotypes are displayed at the bottom.
  Significantly regulated proteins connecting the upper and lower panel are displayed
  in the middle. Red and green colors represent significant up/down-regulation, respectively,
  with the intensity of the color reflecting the degree of change. Orange color predicts
  an overall activation of the pathway while blue indicates a prediction of an overall
  decrease based on z-score value. Inconsistent relationships are represented as yellow
  line. Note that in MCF7 harboring MFF some of the proteins in our dataset have been
  predicted to be inhibited by the upstream regulators ERG, LGALS3, and MYC leading
  to an overall inhibition (blue) of cell survival and/or activation (orange) of cell
  death. (A) Cell survival and adhesion; (B) Cell death.
