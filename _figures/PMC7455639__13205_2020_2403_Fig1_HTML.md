caption: demonstrating the interaction of LRFN1, DLG1, DLG3 and DLG3 with NMDA. Interaction
  of DLG1 and DLG4 is attributed to clustering of receptors and associated pathways.
  DLG3 helps in clustering of NMDA receptors at excitatory synapse. LRFN2 interacts
  with the NMDA and the LRFN2-NMDA receptor pathway is critical for the susceptibility
  of cell towards oncogenesis. Aberrant methylation patters in NMDA receptor pathways
  can lead to NSCLC
