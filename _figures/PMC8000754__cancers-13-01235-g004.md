caption: Proteasome inhibitors and metabolic pathways. Enhancement of glucose and
  glutamine metabolism is a hallmark of cancer cells, including multiple myeloma (MM).
  Targeting deranged cellular metabolism at various levels enhances the cytotoxicity
  of proteasome inhibitors in MM. Inhibition of the glucose transporter GLUT1 (STF-31)
  or the non-pharmacological inhibition of HIF1α and LDHA enzymes result in synergistic
  cell death with proteasome inhibitors (PI). The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme
  IDH2 is synthetic lethal to PI through NAMPT/SIRT3/IDH2 pathway (AGI-6780, FK866).
  Degradation of glutamine can be targeted with Asparaginase (ASNase) or Glutaminase
  inhibitor (CB-832), affecting glutamate-dependent metabolites of TCA cycle. The
  cellular energy sensor AMPK is synthetically lethal to PI. OXPHOS inhibition by
  the mitochondrial protease ClpP (ONC201) leads to cellular stress and upregulation
  of transcriptional factor ATF4.
