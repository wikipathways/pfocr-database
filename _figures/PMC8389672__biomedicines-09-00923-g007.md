caption: Schematic illustration of the BK-induced signaling pathways linked to reprogram
  RBA cells into neuron-like cells. Schematic representation of signaling pathways
  involved in BK-mediated upregulation of MMP-9 and NSE, downregulation of GFAP, and
  induction of morphological change into neuron-like cells in RBA cells. The binding
  of BK to its receptor (B2BKR) results in the activation of PKC-δ and ERK1/2 cascades.
  These events of BK-induced RBA cell morphological change into neuron-like cells,
  including regulation of various proteins, which are mediated through the B2BKR/PKC-δ/ERK
  pathway. Moreover, the upregulation of MMP-9 is critical for BK-induced RBA cell
  neurite fiber outgrowth in this process.
