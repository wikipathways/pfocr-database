caption: Mechanisms of Ferroptosis and its modulators in RA treatment. GSH, iron and
  lipid metabolism are the core components of ferroptosis. System Xc-/GPX4 axis is
  important for GSH synthesis. System Xc- transports cystine into the cells to generateγ-GCS
  along with glutamate, which is catalyzed by GSS. GSH is synthesized by γ-GCS and
  glycine. GSH acts as a GPX4 cofactor to convert PUFAs-OOH to PUFAs-OH. STEAP3 converted
  Fe3+ to Fe2+ in the endosomes, and the Influx of Fe2+ into the cytoplasm is mediated
  by DMT1 or ZIP14. In the cytoplasm, a small portion of Fe2+ remains in the LIP,
  and most of Fe2+ combines with ferritin for storage. NCOA4 aids in the autophagy
  of ferritin to provide Fe2+ by inducing ferritin degradation. The intracellular
  PUFAs-OOH reacts with Fe2+ to induce lipid peroxidation, eventually leading to ferroptosis.
  ALOX15 promotes lipid peroxidation, and CoQ10H2 inhibits lipid peroxidation. NADPH/FSP1/CoQ10
  pathway is an antioxidant pathway parallel to GPX4. Glycine, SR9009, RSL3, and etanercept
  show positive effects on the treatment of RA patients by inducing ferroptosis, while
  G1dP3 plays a positive role in RA treatment by inhibiting ferroptosis. GSH:glutathione,
