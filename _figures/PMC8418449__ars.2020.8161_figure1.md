caption: Role of metabolism in cellular function. Metabolism regulates cellular function
  by integrating energy production, biosynthesis, control of redox state, cell signaling,
  and transcription. The main metabolic task is to produce ATP to meet energetic demands
  for cellular function via glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle.
  Metabolism is also necessary for biosynthetic pathways, including the PPP for nucleotide
  synthesis, as well as the glycerolipid synthesis pathway (lipid synthesis) and serine
  biosynthesis pathway. Metabolic pathways also regulate the intracellular redox state
  by controlling NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H pools and GSH to fuel the TRX/GSH antioxidant defense
  system. NADPH is derived from PPP, IDHs, MEs, and 1C metabolism, whereas GSH is
  derived from glutaminolysis. Further, metabolism regulates ETC to produce mitoROS.
  Finally, metabolism influences signaling and transcription by regulating post-translational
  modification (e.g., glycosylation via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway), epigenetic
  modification, and metabolite signaling. 1C, one-carbon; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  ETC, electron transport chain; GSH, glutathione; ME, malic enzyme; mitoROS, mitochondrial
  ROS; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; TRX, thioredoxin.
  Color images are available online.
