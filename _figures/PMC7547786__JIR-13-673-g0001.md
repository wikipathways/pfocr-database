caption: Th-17 cell polarization from naïve CD4+ T cells and activation. In response
  to SARS-CoV-2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells as well as
  macrophages can present the fragments of the antigen to the naïve CD4+ T cells,
  and upon activation APCs release IL-6, TGF-β, and IL-23 polarizing cytokines. In
  turn, IL-6 binds with its receptor and through JAK-STAT3 causes polarization, maturation,
  and expansion of CD4+ T cells to Th17 cells with the expression of RORγt. In turn,
  the activated Th-17 cells produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-17F,
  IL-21, and IL-22.
