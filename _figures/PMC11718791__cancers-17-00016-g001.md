caption: The PI3K pathway and FDA-approved, or fast-track designation-granted PI3K
  inhibitors. The PI3K pathway is activated by receptor tyrosine kinase (TRK) stimulation,
  which recruits PI3K to the cell membrane and induces PIP2 phosphorylation to PIP3,
  promoting AKT activation by PDK1. Activation of mTORC is led by AKT-induced inhibition
  of the TSC1/2 complex. PTEN serves as a negative regulator by functioning as a PIP3
  phosphatase and converting PIP3 to PIP2. mTOR complexes regulate both upstream and
  downstream of AKT. mTORC2 promotes AKT activation from upstream of the pathway;
  AKT inhibits TSC1/2 complexes, which inhibit its downstream target mTORC1 complex.
