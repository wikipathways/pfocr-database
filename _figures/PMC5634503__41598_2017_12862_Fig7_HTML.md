caption: 'Proposed mechanism. Left panel, wild type RPE cells (light blue): Iron is
  taken up from the basolateral domain of RPE cells by the classical Tf/TfR pathway,
  and excess is stored in ferritin. In addition, RPE cells accumulate iron from phagocytosed
  photoreceptor outer segments that is stored in ferritin. The release of iron from
  ferritin requires its degradation, a process mediated by NCOA4 that chaperones it
  to the phagophore that eventually matures into an autophagosome. Autophagosomes
  fuse with lysosomes, where hydrolases degrade ferritin and release the stored iron.
  These hydrolases are trafficked to lysosomes from the Golgi with the help of adaptor
  protein Rab1a. α-Syn is known to interact with Rab1a and inhibit its function, thereby
  disrupting the trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases. Right panel, α-syn overexpressing
  RPE cells (dark blue): Over-expression of α-syn sequesters Rab1a, resulting in impaired
  lysosomal activity and accumulation of iron-rich ferritin in lysosomes. Since α-syn
  is degraded by the same pathway, inhibition of lysosomal function by α-syn combined
  with upregulation of ferritin due to iron overloading results in the release of
  ferritin and α-syn containing exosomes to the extracellular milieu, probably from
  the AP domain of RPE cells. Abbreviations: AP: apical, BL: basolateral, TJ: tight
  junction, BM: Bruch’s membrane, Tf: transferrin, TfR: transferrin receptor, NCOA4:
  nuclear receptor coactivator 4, POS: photoreceptor outer segment.'
