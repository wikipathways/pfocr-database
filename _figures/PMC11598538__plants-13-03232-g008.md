caption: Schematic model of the mechanism by which the circadian rhythm regulates
  the aroma release of Oncidium Twinkle ‘Red Fantasy’. The main aroma compounds of
  Oncidium Twinkle ‘Red Fantasy’ were 3-Carene, Butyl tiglate, and Prenyl senecioate.
  3-Carene were mainly released at 10:00, while Butyl tiglate and Prenyl senecioate
  were mainly released at 14:00. DXS, CMK, IDI, TPS, and LOX were key genes in the
  terpenoid or fatty acid derivative biosynthetic pathway, which were co-expressed
  with aroma release. Under the treatment of constant light or dark, the aroma release
  maintained a circadian rhythm
