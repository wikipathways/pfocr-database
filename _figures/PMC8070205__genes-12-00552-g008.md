caption: Progerin expression in HGPS leads to DNA repair defect, replicative stress,
  and inflammation through DNA sensing in the cytosol. Expression of Progerin and
  the ensuing genomic instability has recently been reported to contribute to the
  activation cGAS-STING pathway and the production of an inflammatory response that
  may accelerate the aging process in HGPS cells. Indeed, Progerin accumulation leads
  to replicative stress by the sequestration of PCNA, away from the fork, and aberrant
  recruitment of XPA to stalled fork, which impedes their RAD51-dependent protection
  leading to degradation of stalled fork by MRE11. HGPS cells present an important
  accumulation of DNA damage due in part to the decreased level of VDR caused by Progerin
  which leads to a diminution of key DNA repair factor such as RAD51, BRCA1 (leading
  likely an HR defect) and 53BP1. Recently, it was reported that a calcitriol treatment
  could reduce the effect of Progerin accumulation on the VDR level, thus partially
  rescuing DSB repair mechanism in HGPS cells. It has also been shown altered histone
  modifications in Progerin accumulating cells, leading to reduced level of H3K9me3
  in G0/G1 cells, inducing a defective ATM activation and defective amplification
  of the γH2AX signal in response to the DSBs and an impaired recruitment of 53BP1
  and RIF1 during NHEJ. In contrast, it has been also reported (in early passage),
  an increase of SUV39 protein and H3K9me3; the condensed chromatin preventing access
  to DNA repair factors lead to persistent DNA damage. Depletion of SUV39 H1 rescue
  the DNA repair factor recruitment. As described previously, replicative stress and
  DNA damage accumulation (through the different mechanisms described here) can lead
  to cytosolic DNA production, which activate the cGAS-STING pathway and production
  of inflammatory factors. Moreover, Progerin accumulation has been reported to increase
  proteins levels of cGAS, STING, and PRRs and induce a IFN-like response mediated
  by STAT1. As a result, Progerin cells show an increased level of ISG.
