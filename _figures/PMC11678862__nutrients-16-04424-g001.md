caption: Molecular mechanisms linking dietary restriction to lipid metabolism and
  health benefits. The figure illustrates the molecular pathways influenced by dietary
  restriction (DR) and their effects on lipid metabolism and overall health. Key pathways
  include NAD+-dependent sirtuin signaling, the TOR pathway, AMPK activation, and
  insulin/IGF-1 signaling, which collectively regulate metabolic processes. By reducing
  energy intake, DR enhances mitochondrial β-oxidation, promoting the breakdown of
  fatty acids to generate energy, while increasing NAD+ levels to activate SIRT1,
  further driving lipid catabolism. DR also suppresses insulin/IGF-1 signaling by
  activating the TSC1/2 complex to inhibit mTORC1, shifting the cellular focus from
  anabolic processes to lipid utilization and autophagy. Additionally, FOXO transcription
  factors, activated by DR, upregulate genes involved in lipid breakdown and metabolic
  adaptation, supporting efficient fat utilization and stress resistance. In the liver,
  DR enhances cholesterol metabolism by activating CYP7A1, facilitating the conversion
  of cholesterol into bile acids to maintain lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, DR reduces
  circulating levels of cholesterol, adipokines, glucose, and insulin, promoting lipid
  catabolism, metabolic adaptation, stress resistance, and longevity. These coordinated
  changes highlight DR’s critical role in optimizing energy balance, lowering the
  risk of metabolic diseases, and extending the healthspan
