caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In the absence of the Wnt signal, free cytoplasmic
  β-catenin is recognized and recruited by the destruction complex, where CK1 and
  GSK3β phosphorylate it, thereby undergoes ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis.
  In the presence of Wnt ligands, Wnt signaling blocks the activity of the destruction
  complex, and subsequently, β-catenin accumulate. Increased levels of cytoplasmic
  β-catenin translocate into the nucleus, where it associates with DNA binding proteins
  from the TCF/LEF family and other co-transcription factors. β-Catenin-TCF/LEF transcription
  complex then drives the transcription of Wnt/β-catenin target genes
