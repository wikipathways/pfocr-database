caption: MiR-124 and miR-9/9* engage in complex regulatory circuits activating a neuronal
  gene expression program. Expression of miR-124 and miR-9/9* is controlled by the
  neurogenic repressor REST and its co-factors SCP1 and CoREST. In addition, miR-9/9*
  is repressed by TLX and the Notch effector HES1. During neuronal differentiation,
  miR-124 and miR-9/9* are up-regulated and reinforce their own expression by targeting
  their negative regulators. For instance, miR-9 forms auto-regulatory loops with
  HES1 and the let-7 target TLX. Both miR-124 and miR-9/9* repress the expression
  of additional components of the Notch pathway (PW). Furthermore, forced expression
  of miR-124 and miR-9/9* induces a switch of epigenetic regulators. MiR-124 and miR-9*
  favor the switch from BAF53a to BAF53b to be included in the BAF chromatin remodeling
  complex leading to the induction of dendritic outgrowth. In addition, miR-124 targets
  the mRNA splicing regulator PTBP1 allowing the expression of the neuron-enriched
  homolog PTBP2, which induces a neuron-specific pre-mRNA splicing pattern. Down-regulation
  of PTBP1 also leads to the abolishment of its inhibitory impact on the interaction
  of miR-124 with REST co-factor SCP1
