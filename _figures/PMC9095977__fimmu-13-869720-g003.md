caption: HMGB1 functions depend on its localization/environment, oxidation state and
  its alarm signaling involves autocrine and paracrine amplification loops. (A) HMGB1
  effects depend on its localization and oxidation state. Mainly located inside the
  nucleus, HMGB1 binds DNA and modulates nucleosome stability, thus regulating gene
  transcription. In the cytoplasm, it plays a role in autophagy. When actively or
  passively released outside cells, HMGB1 takes part in immunity, inflammation and
  cell differentiation. HMGB1 can stimulate immune cells (leukocytes, macrophages…).
  The HMGB1 redox state evolves in relation to its context. Fully reduced, HMGB1 binds
  to CXCL12 to promote cell recruitment and migration by activation of CXCR4 at the
  cell membrane. Or, by binding RAGE, it is internalized and it can promote autophagy,
  cell migration and cytokines synthesis. Through RAGE and TLRs signalization, disulfide
  HMGB1 induces inflammation and cytokines secretion. When fully oxidized, HMGB1 does
  not interact anymore with the receptors and may enhance immune tolerance. (B) HMGB1
  amplifying feedback loop. Under different stimuli, a cell (macrophage, leukocyte,
  smooth muscle cell, …) can produce and secrete HMGB1 and its receptors directly
  or via the production of cytokines. Once HMGB1 is produced and released, a positive
  feedback loop is created to enhance its production at the protein level by the initial
  cell or by neighboring cells, hereby amplifying its effects. This is associated
  to the secretion of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules. (C) NF-κB mediated
  amplification of HMGB1 and its receptors. By interacting with RAGE and TLR receptors,
  HMGB1, often in complex with stimulating molecules, will activate the NF-κB pathway.
  This will induce the transcription of HMGB1, its receptors, and cytokines, leading
  to an amplification of the inflammatory response.

  description: HMGB1 functions depend on its localization/environment, oxidation state

    (A) HMGB1 effects depend on its localization and oxidation state. Mainly located
