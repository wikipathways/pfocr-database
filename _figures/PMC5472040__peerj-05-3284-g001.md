caption: 'The metabolism of lipids, specifically triglycerides, produces glycerol
  and occurs via triacylglycerol lipase (TAGL). Reducing equivalents required in the
  production of glycerol can be produced via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  involving the enzymes 6-phosphoglucolactonase (6-PGL) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PDH). The enzyme citrate synthase (CS) is involved in the citric acid cycle (CAC)
  and gluconeogenic enzymes include phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP). Pyruvate kinase (PK) is an enzyme present within
  the lower-half of glycolysis. The following substrates are involved in the above
  processes: glucose-1-phosphate (G1P), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), β-glucose-6-phosphate
  (β-G6P), glucono-1,5-lactone 6-phosphate (G-1,5-6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P),
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphtate (F16P), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), glycerol-3-phosphate
  (G3P), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), glyceraldehyde (GA), phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) and oxaloacetate (OAA).'
