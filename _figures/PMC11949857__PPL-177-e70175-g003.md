caption: Simplified lignin biosynthetic pathway in plants showing initial steps. The
  enzymes that catalyse the first couple of steps in this pathway include phenylalanine
  ammonia‐lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4‐hydroxylase (C4H) in dicots and monocots where
  phenylalanine is first deaminated by the enzyme PAL to form cinnamate and then hydroxylated
  by cinnamate‐4‐hydroxylase (C4H) to p‐coumarate. Monocots (grasses) additionally
  contain the bifunctional phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia‐lyase (PTAL) that catalyses
  the deamination of Phe/Tyr leading to the formation of p‐coumarate directly

  homologs imply the potential presence of bifunctional ammonia lyases in conifers
