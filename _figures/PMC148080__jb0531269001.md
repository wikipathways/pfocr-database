caption: Current models of lipoate attachment and synthesis. (A) Lipoate ligase reaction
  that utilizes exogenous sources of lipoic acid and octanoic acid. (B) Current model
  of lipoic acid synthesis and attachment. The sulfur insertion step is catalyzed
  by LipA. LipB then transfers the lipoate moiety from lipoyl-ACP to the lipoyl domains.
  However, an additional pathway is not precluded in which LipB transfers octanoate
  from ACP to the lipoyl domain to form the octanoyl-domain, which is recognized as
  a substrate for LipA-catalyzed sulfur insertion.
