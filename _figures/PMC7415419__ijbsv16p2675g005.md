caption: The models for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) behaviors on autophagic
  signaling pathway activation during osteoclast differentiation and formation. (A)
  Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a decoy receptor for the RANKL and competitively inhibit
  osteoclasts differentiation and maturation through blocking the interaction between
  RANKL and RANK. (B) OPG inhibits osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by enhancing
  autophagy through activating AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway. OPG activates AMP‐activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) and downstream tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2). Activated
  AMPK inhibits mTOR through either phosphorylating Raptor on mTOR or promoting TSC1/TSC2
  complex formation to inhibit Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), which can induce
  mTOR activation. Reduction of activated mTOR activate autophagy indirectly by nonactivated
  70‐kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K). (C) The AMPK/mTOR/UNC-51 like autophagy
  activating kinase 1 (ULK1) signaling pathway mediated autophagy is involved in the
  regulation of energy metabolism in osteoclastogenesis. Under high glucose condition,
  activated mTOR phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser757, which inhibits the interaction between
  ULK1 and AMPK, to suppress autophagy. Under glucose starvation conditions when energy
  supply is exhausted, activated AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 and Raptor, which inhibits
  the activation of mTOR, then signal transduction from AMPK to ULK1 is restored.
  AMPK phosphorylates and activates ULK1 at multiple residues (Ser317 and Ser777),
  the activated ULK1/mATG13/FIP200 protein kinase complex lead to autophagy.
