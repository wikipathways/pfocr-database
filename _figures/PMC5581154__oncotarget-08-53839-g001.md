caption: The Notch signaling cascade primarily consists of three steps. 1) Intracellular
  synthesis. The precursor of the Notch receptor becomes a heterodimeric receptor
  after S1 cleavage by furin-like convertases within the trans-Golgi network and then
  translocates to the cytomembrane. 2) Proteolysis at the transmembrane region. After
  two proteolytic cleavages, mediated by ADAM/TACE at the extracellular domain and
  the γ-secretase complex at the transmembrane region, the NICD is released and transported
  into the nucleus. 3) Effective stage. The NICD/CSL complex recruits co-activators,
  including mastermind-like (MAML) and p300, that can accelerate the activation of
  Notch target genes.
