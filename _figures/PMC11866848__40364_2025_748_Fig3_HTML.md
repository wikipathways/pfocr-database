caption: Mechanism of SLC7A11 inhibiting ferroptosis in cancer cells. In cancer cells,
  glutamine is converted to glutamate by glutaminase, which subsequently promotes
  the mitochondrial TCA cycle, glycolysis, mitochondrial ROS, and mitochondrial lipid
  metabolism, ultimately driving lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. SLC7A11 inhibits
  ferroptosis by promoting cystine uptake and glutamate export, reducing lipid peroxidation
  through both GPX4-dependent and GPX4-independent pathways. TCA, Tricarboxylic acid;
  SLC7A11, recombinant solute carrier family 7, member 11; SLC3A2, solute carrier
  family 3 member 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GLUT, glucose transporter; GPX4,
  glutathione peroxidase 4; GSH, glutathione; ALOX12, arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase;
  mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin 1
