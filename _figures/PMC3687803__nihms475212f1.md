caption: The different layers of the epidermis, and the functions within those layers
  regulated by VDR and its coactivators. The basal layer of the epidermis (stratum
  basale) contains the stem cells that through proliferation provide the cells for
  the upper layers. As the keratinocytes leave the basal layer differentiation takes
  place with K1, K10, involucrin, and transglutaminase being expressed in the stratum
  spinosum, filaggrin and loricrin being expressed in the stratum granulosum. Lamellar
  bodies forming in the stratum granulosum inject their lipid content into the intercellular
  spaces between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum to provide the water proofing
  for the permeability barrier. DRIP205 is most highly expressed in the stratum basale
  and spinosum where it participates with VDR in regulating proliferation in partnership
  with the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Cyclin D1 and Gli 1 (a transcriptional
  factor for the hedgehog pathway) are regulated by VDR, DRIP205, and β-catenin. SRC3
  on the other hand is found in highest concentration in the stratum granulosum where
  it participates with VDR in the regulation of terminal differentiation. SRC3 is
  critical for lipid processing and lamellar body formation required for formation
  of the permeability barrier as well as 1,25(OH)2D induction of cathelicidin and
  CD14 required for innate immunity
