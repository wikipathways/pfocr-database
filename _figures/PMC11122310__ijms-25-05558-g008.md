caption: Proposed illustrated scheme for TGFβ3′s effects on follicular GCs. TGFβ3
  binds TGFβ receptor II and I (RII and RI), leading to an activation of the canonical
  signaling pathway, including Smad2/3 phosphorylation and translocation to the cell
  nucleus. The activated Smad2/3 acts as a transcription factor to drive COX-2 mRNA
  and protein induction, which then triggers TXA2 generation and secretion into extracellular
  space. The  indicates a pharmacological and/or siRNA intervention used in this study
