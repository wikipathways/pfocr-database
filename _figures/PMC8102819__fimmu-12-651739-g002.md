caption: Proposed interactions between inflammation, hemolysis and hypovolemia in
  malaria-induced kidney injury. Malaria PAMPs and DAMPs released during the lysis
  of Plasmodium-infected RBCs (pRBCs) stimulate the immune and inflammatory responses,
  leading to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, which subsequently induce
  the activation of the endothelium and the propagation of the inflammatory process.
  Activated endothelial cells contribute to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines,
  and express surface receptors that facilitate the infiltration of leukocytes into
  kidney tissue. Cell-free heme acts a source of oxidative stress for the vascular
  endothelium and the tubular epithelial cells of the kidney, while also inducing
  the formation of NETs. The activation of the angiotensin (Ang) II/AT1 receptor pathway
  due to malaria-induced hypovolemia also contributes to the amplification of the
  host inflammatory response, by further inducing the secretion of proinflammatory
  cytokines by endothelial cells. DAMP, Damage-associated molecular pattern ICAM-1,
  Intercellular adhesion molecule 1, IL-1β, Interleukin-1β; IL-6, Interleukin-6; NET,
