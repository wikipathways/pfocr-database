caption: 'The transcription factors and genes that regulate PDKs regulation. Schematic
  representation shows the metabolic switch from mitochondrial respiration to lactate
  production. PDKs retard the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA
  by inhibiting PDC. HIF-1 and MYC promotes glycolysis and increases the expression
  of PDKs and LDHA. The transcription of HIF-1 is enhanced by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  and ROS accumulation by electron transport chain Abbreviations: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PDC: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex;
  PDKs, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; HIF1, hypoxia
  inducible factor 1.'
