caption: Metabolic scheme of bioenergetics and anabolic metabolism in cancer cells
  that represent treatment targets. CR cells take up large amounts of glutamine and
  use these nutrients to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS). Glutamine is hydrolyzed to glutamate for glutathione synthesis, an essential
  factor to abrogate high ROS via xCT antiporter. Increased fatty acid synthesis enzymes
  are also found in CR tumors. Moreover, tumors lacking ASS1 enzyme in the urea cycle
  require extracellular arginine in the circulation for survival. ACLY = ATP citrate
  lyase, ACC = acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ADI-PEG = arginine deiminase pegylated-20,
  ASL = argininosuccinate lyase, ASS1 = argininosuccinate synthetase, BPTES = glutaminase
  inhibitor, CD98hc = CD98 heavy chain, 2-DG = 2-deoxy-d-glucose, FX= LDHA inhibitor,
  FASN = fatty acid synthase, G-6-P = glucose-6-phosphate, G6PDH = glucose-6-P dehydrogenase,
  GLS = glutaminase, GDH = glutamate dehydrogenase, GLUT = glucose transporter, GSH
  = glutathione, HK = hexokinase, α-KG = alpha-ketoneglutarate, LDHA = lactate dehydrogenase-A,
  PDH = pyruvate dehydrogenase, PKM2 = pyruvate kinase isozymes M2, PPP = pentose
  phosphate pathway. ROS = reactive oxygen species, SSZ = Sulfasalazine, TCA = tricarboxylic
  acid, XCT = system xc- amino-acid transporter.
