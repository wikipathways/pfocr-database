caption: Plasma levels of glutamate and metabolites in COVID-19 patients. Plasma levels
  of amino acids, proteolysis markers and amino acid synthesis substrates were analyzed
  in COVID-19 patients with low (< 15 pg/mL, light blue dots) and high (> 15 pg/mL,
  dark blue dots) IL-6 levels and control patients (grey dots) by targeted metabolomics.
  Data are expressed in µmol/L. Glutamine and its metabolites were identified as the
  pathway most downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001
  compared to control group
