caption: A proposed model depicting the impact of overexpressing the ANGPTL8 R59W
  variant in influencing the NF-κB pathway. After the overexpression of the wild type
  ANGPLT8/ANGPTL8-R59W and under the influence of inflammatory stimuli like TNFα,
  the activity levels of IKKα/β were enhanced which sequentially phosphorylates the
  NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα, and triggers its rapid degradation through the proteasomal
  degradation. This releases the NF-κB heterodimer as it is no longer repressed by
  IκBα. Subsequently, the NF-κB heterodimer translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus,
  binds to its downstream target DNA sequence, and induces the expression of proinflammatory
  proteins. This expression of proinflammatory cytokines is higher in the overexpressed
  ANGPTL8 R59W variant as compared to the wild type ANGPTL8 under stimulation due
  to its increased nuclear translocation of NF-κB heterodimers. This model depicts
  the proinflammatory role of R59W-ANGPTL8 in modulating the inflammation through
  the NF-κB signaling pathway
