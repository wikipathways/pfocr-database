caption: The identification of microRNA (miRNA) target genes. (A) A network diagram
  shows the relationship between miRNA and its target genes. The miRNA is marked as
  red, the miRNA‐target gene is marked as blue. The larger the square, the higher
  the score of connectivity. The high‐connectivity‐miRNAs include hsa‐mir‐106a‐5p,
  hsa‐mir‐106b‐5p, and hsa‐mir‐20a‐5p. (B) A network diagram shows the KEGG analysis
  between miRNA and signaling pathway. The miRNA is marked as blue and the signaling
  pathway is marked as orange. The size of the square represents the connectivity.
  The larger the square, the higher the score of connectivity. The thickness of the
  line represents the degree of enrichment. The thicker the line, the higher the degree
  of enrichment. The connectivity of PI3K/Akt and focal adhesion was high, indicating
  these two signaling pathways were more susceptible to miRNA regulation
