caption: 'Mechanisms of immune suppression during bacterial infection. (A) Infection
  with B. abortus causes the expression of iNOS and production of NO, which suppress
  the expression of TXNIP within infected macrophages. Since TXNIP is crucial for
  activating NF-κB, its suppression leads to decreased activity of this critical transcription
  factor. With NF-κB activity diminished, the production of NO and ROS, both vital
  for immune defense, is also reduced. (B) Edwardsiella piscicida secretes Trxlp,
  a protein that mimics the structure of human hTrx1 but is devoid of redox activity.
  Trxlp binds directly to the IKK complex, which is essential for the activation of
  the NF-κB signaling pathway. This pathway is pivotal for initiating immune responses
  such as inflammation and apoptosis. The direct engagement of Trxlp with IKK obstructs
  the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Without NF-κB in the nucleus, the transcription
  of immune response genes is hindered, which in turn reduces inflammation and apoptosis.
  Trxlp also interacts with Prx enzymes that normally reduce H2O2. This interaction
  instead leads to a localized accumulation of H2O2. The increase in H2O2, facilitated
  by Trxlp’s interaction with Prx, suppresses apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1
  (ASK1). ASK1 is involved in activating MAP kinases, key players in stress response
  pathways including those governing inflammation and cell death. Suppressing ASK1
  leads to reduction in the activation of MAP kinases and the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. This results in a weakened immune response, creating a more favorable
  environment for bacterial survival. (TXNIP: thioredoxin-interacting protein; NF-κB:
  nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; NO: nitric oxide;
  ROS: reactive oxygen species; Trxlp: thioredoxin-like protein; hTrx1: human thioredoxin
