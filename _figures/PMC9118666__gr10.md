caption: Model of metabolic changes in Plasmodium falciparum–infected RBCs to accommodate
  the loss of FH and MQO. The disruption of FH and MQO abolishes oxaloacetate production
  in the mitochondrion and downstream steps in the TCA cycle. Since parasite-generated
  fumarate can no longer be consumed in the mitochondrion, ΔFM-infected RBCs reduce
  cellular fumarate levels by lowering flux through the purine salvage pathway and
  by reverse flux through hARSL or a functionally similar parasite enzyme. Gray dotted
  lines indicate the predicted transport of metabolites; wide green arrows and narrow
  orange arrows represent an increase and decrease in pathway flux, respectively.
