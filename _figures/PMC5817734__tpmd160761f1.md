caption: Schematic representation of the mode of action of the major drugs with trypanocidal
  activity. The green boxes represent drugs currently used for treatment, the yellow
  boxes represent drugs in clinical trials, and the red boxes represent experimental
  drugs. (A) Bisphosphonates inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, which reduces
  the levels of sterols and other essential poly-isoprenoids compounds, affecting
  cell viability. (B) Nifurtimox (NFX) and benznidazole (BZ) are reduced by the parasite
  nitroreductase, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which
  directly damage the cells of the parasite. Trypanothione reductase helps relieve
  the oxidative stress, and inhibitors of this enzyme, such as thioridazine and sulfoximine
  buthionine (SB), increase the amount of ROS in the intracellular space. (C) The
  ergosterol biosynthetic pathway is essential for parasite survival. Blocking this
  pathway leads to loss of cell viability via depletion of essential sterols and accumulation
  of toxic intermediates. Ergosterol inhibitors and fenarimol analogues target lanosterol
  C14 demethylase, and amiodarone and dronedarone partially inhibit oxidosqualene
  cyclase. Phospholipid inhibitors block sterol synthesis, inhibit de novo phospholipid
  synthesis via Greenberg’s pathway, and inhibit signal transduction enzymes such
  as phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C. (D) Amiodarone and dronedarone release
  Ca2+ from mitochondria and acidocalcisomes (ACs), which increases Ca2+ levels in
  the cytoplasmic space and compromises cell survival. (E) Cruzipain (CZ) is typically
  located in the Golgi apparatus, flagellar pocket, and glycosomes and is an essential
  cysteine protease involved in parasite differentiation, cell invasion, multiplication,
  and immune evasion. Inhibitors of cruzipain alter the Golgi apparatus, owing to
  the accumulation of unprocessed cruzipain precursors. This figure appears in color
