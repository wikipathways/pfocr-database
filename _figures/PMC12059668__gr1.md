caption: 'S1P and Ceramide synthesis and metabolic pathwayCeramide is central hub
  of sphingolipid metabolism. There is three ways to produce ceramide, one from sphingomyelin
  (SM) by the action of the sphingomyelinases (SMase), one is the de novo biosynthesis
  by the action of the serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT) using serine and Palmitoyl-CoA
  as a substrate, following the production of dihydrosphingosine (dhSph) as an intermediate.dhSph
  is acylated by the action of ceramide synthase (CERS) to produce dihydroceramide
  and finally, ceramide is synthesized by the action of desaturase. Another one is
  salvage pathway by which recycling of free sphingosine produced from the degradation
  of pre-formed sphingolipids by the action of CERS. Sphingosine is phosphorylated
  by the enzyme SphKs to produce S1P. S1P plays a various cellular function through
  its five specific G-protein coupled receptors, i.e. S1P1 and S1P3. Of the S1P receptors,
  S1P1, S1P2 and S1P3 are expressed in sensory neurons, where S1P1 and S1P3 have been
  reported to play important roles in regulating nociceptor function. S1P1 and S1P3
  are also expressed in both microglia and astrocytes. S1P: sphingosine 1-phosphate,
  SPPase: sphingosine phosphate phosphatase, SphKs: sphingosine kinases, CerS: ceramide
  synthase, SMS: SMase: sphingomyelinase SPT: serine palmitoyl transferase'
