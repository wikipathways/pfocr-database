caption: The signaling pathway of necroptosis and its PTMs. (A) Binding of cell surface
  TNFR1, DR3, DR6, and their respective ligands TNF, TLA1, and APP recruits the formation
  of Complex I, which promotes the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, the
  expression of inflammatory genes, and cell survival. After Complex I is destabilized,
  it can form Complex II, including Complex IIa and IIb, which induce apoptosis and
  RIPK1-dependent apoptosis, respectively. When caspase-8 activity is inhibited, a
  ripoptosome can be formed in the cell, which further forms a necrosome and induces
  necroptosis. The PTMs of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL and their corresponding modified
  proteins are also labeled in the figure. (B) On the left side of the figure, FAS
  and TRAILR1/2 bind to their respective ligands FASL and TRAIL1/2 to first form the
  death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which can induce apoptosis and necroptosis
  when caspase-8 is inhibited. After separation from the receptor, a complex similar
  to Complex I can be formed in the cytoplasm as the FADDosome, which can promote
  the expression of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways and cell survival. On the right side
  of the figure, only caspase-8 inhibition is shown. When caspase-8 is not inhibited,
  TLR3, TLR4, and ZBP1 can also form Complex I-like complexes in the cytoplasm upon
  binding to their corresponding ligands, promoting cell survival. When caspase-8
  is inhibited, TLR3 and TLR4 promote its autophosphorylation and the recruitment
  of MLKL through direct binding of TRIF to RIPK3, while ZBP1 binds to RIPK3 directly,
  which promotes necroptosis. Interferon (IFN) can promote necroptosis through multiple
  pathways
