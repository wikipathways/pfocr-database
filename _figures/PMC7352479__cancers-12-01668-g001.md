caption: 'Glucose metabolism. Summarized are the most important players of the pathways
  used by cancer cells: glycolysis pathway (green), gluconeogenesis pathway (blue),
  pentose phosphate pathway (brown), and glutathione cycle (purple). Upregulating
  actions of GPC3 and HIF-1α are visualized with a red dotted arrow. Isoenzyme switches
  are illustrated as wavy arrows. HCC metabolism is shifted towards anaerobic glycolysis
  with an increase in glucose uptake by the activity of the GLUT1 transporter. Once
  inside the cell, glucose is transformed into G6P by HK1/2. Both GLUT1 and HK1/2
  are positively regulated by HIF-1α, which in turn is upregulated by GPC3. In one
  case, G6P could be redirected towards the PPP, to produce metabolic intermediates
  useful for cell survival, and NADPH essential for glutathione reduction and ROS
  control. In the other case, G6P could continue through the anaerobic glycolytic
  pathway until the transformation of pyruvate into lactate by LDHA. The upregulation
  of LDHA enzyme is essential for the glycolytic pathway to remain active. This step
  could be regulated by HIF-1α and GPC3. In this way, cancer cells produce both energy
  and metabolic intermediates for all the macromolecular biosynthesis necessary for
  cell survival and proliferation. Lactate is then released out of the cell through
  the MCT4 transporter, ensuring an acidic pH in the extracellular compartment, which
  in turn maintains a state of inflammation and can modulate the immune system state
  of the tumor microenvironment. Abbreviations: ECM = extracellular matrix; FBP1 =
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1; G6PD = glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAPDH =
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GLUT1 = glucose transporter 1; GPC3 =
  glypican-3; GPx = glutathione peroxidase; GRd = glutathione reductase; GSH = glutathione
  reduced form; GSSG = glutathione oxidized form; GSTs = glutathione S-transferases;
  HIF-1α = hypoxia inducible factor 1α; HK1/2 or 4 = hexokinase 1/2 or 4; LDHA = lactate
