caption: During various pathological conditions, unfolded or misfolded proteins are
  increased in the ER. During oxidative protein folding in the ER, ROS are generated
  during electron transfer between PDI and ERO1α. ROS associated with UPR signaling
  can activate an antioxidant response, such as Nrf2 or can increase ROS generation
  by activating ERO1 or NOX. Furthermore, ROS are increased in the ER through the
  association of PDI with ROS, generating Nox4. Although the major site of calcium
  is in the ER, under stress conditions, calcium may flow to the mitochondrial outer
  membrane through calcium release channels, such as IP3R or RyR. Increased calcium
  overload in mitochondria subsequently increases ROS generation. The increased calcium
  load and ROS in mitochondria may lead to opening of the mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore, which may cause the release of proapoptotic factors. High oxidative
  stress during this condition is critical for inducing mitochondrial dysfunction
  and vice versa. Overall, we suggest that the ER stress response can induce ER or
  mitochondrial dysfunction, which may increase oxidative stress by dysregulating
  disulfide bond formation, impairing oxidative protein folding, or the inducing certain
  UPR genes (e.g., CHOP) where oxidative stress is reversible, which may depend on
  redox homeostasis (see the text for more details). ER endoplasmic reticulum, ROS
  reactive oxygen species, PDI protein disulfide isomerase, ERO1α endoplasmic reticulum
  oxidoreduction 1α, NOX NADPH oxidase, IP3R inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors,
  RyR ryanodine receptors.
