caption: Diagram illustrating pathways targeting amino acid biosynthesis or transport
  for therapeutic applications. LAT1 and ASCT2 are two amino acid transporters important
  in melanoma. Depletion of intracellular amino acid pools, whether by disrupting
  transport or biosynthesis, could alter mTOR and GCN2 signaling, inhibiting mRNA
  translation initiation. Many amino acids regulate cellular processes other than
  protein synthesis. Two examples are arginine and proline. Arginine is used in the
  urea cycle and proline can contribute to glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.
  Lastly, tumor suppressors and oncogenes regulate amino acid biosynthetic pathways
  as evidenced by the role of p53 and MYC in proline biosynthesis.
