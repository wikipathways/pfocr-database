caption: Biased signaling of mGlu1a receptors. Upon agonist (Ago) stimulation, mGlu1a
  receptors activate two independent signaling pathways. Agonists such as quisqualate
  and DHPG activate G protein-mediated signaling leading to the activation of phospholipase
  C, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and protein kinase C (PKC) and resulting in transient
  increases in ERK phosphorylation. This signaling is abolished with mutation of the
  Thr188 residue in the agonist binding pocket and can be disrupted by the PLC inhibitor
  U73122. In contrast, glutarate and succinate activate the β-arrestin-1 (βArr1)-dependent
  pathway, which involves receptor internalization, leads to sustained ERK phosphorylation,
  and is responsible for the cytoprotective actions of mGlu1a receptors. This signaling
  is abolished with mutation of Arg323 or Lys409 residues in the agonist binding pocket
  and can be disrupted through shRNA-mediated inhibition of β-arrestin-1 expression.
  Glutamate, aspartate, and cysteate are unbiased ligands that activate both pathways.
  Amino acid mutations that block one of the signaling pathways do not prevent the
  actions of agonists at the other pathway. MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase.
