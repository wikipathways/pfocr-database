caption: (A) Localization of pMtIRE-gusA expression in wild-type nodulated roots.
  Composite M. truncatula plants with transgenic roots were grown in the presence
  of S. meliloti and stained with X-Gluc (blue) for the localization of MtIRE promoter
  activity. The arrow points to the X-Gluc staining in the proximal side of zone II
  in a 15 dpi nodule. The arrowhead points to root hairs in which no staining was
  observed. Bar = 100 µM. (B) Phospholipid signaling pathway that may activate MtIRE
  protein's presumed kinase activity.
