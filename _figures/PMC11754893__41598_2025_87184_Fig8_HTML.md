caption: Mechanism diagram of MH regulating S100A8-CAMKK2-AMPK axis against cerebral
  IR injury. Cerebral IR injury leads to an increase in the expression of S100A8,
  which inhibits the activity of the CAMKK2/AMPK pathway. This inhibition leads to
  mitochondrial dysfunction, including oxidative damage, decreased membrane potential,
  and loss of mitochondrial criste structure, along with an increase in apoptosis-related
  proteins such as bax and cleaved-caspase3. Consequently, this results in neuronal
  apoptosis. By contrast, MH down-regulates the high expression of S100A8, thereby
  enhancing mitochondrial function via activation of the CAMKK2/AMPK signaling pathway.
  As a result, this inhibits neuronal apoptosis and ameliorates neurological injury
  during cerebral IR in rats
