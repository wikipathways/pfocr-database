caption: 'Synaptic vesicle recycling and PD genes. Schematic representation of a presynaptic
  terminal showing the PD genes (red boxes) and their role in synaptic vesicle recycling.
  (a) During endocytosis, invagination of the clathrin-coated membrane requires endophilin.
  Endophilin harbors several SH3 domains, which can interact with SYNJ1 PRD domain
  and/or parkin. (b) LRRK2 phosphorylates endophilin leading to dissociation of the
  later from clathrin-coated vesicles. (c) Once recruited to the coated vesicles through
  endophilin, SYNJ1 dephosphorylates PI4,5P into PI, shedding clathrin and its adaptor
  from the bilayer. (d) Uncoating of the vesicles also requires auxilin intervention
  and subsequent chaperoning of clathrin molecules. Then, the postendocytic vesicles
  can return to the reserve pool, where they undergo clustering, or return directly
  to the release site and enter in an exocytosis step. (e) Synaptic vesicles are docked
  and then fused to the membrane by means of a multiprotein complex including synaptobrevin
  and αSYN. (f) PTEN is a lipid phosphatase, which is inhibited by DJ-1, and can increase
  levels of the mitochondrial PINK1 protein. This pathway is involved in NMDA receptor
  signaling. (g) Proper mitochondrial functioning leads to ATP synthesis, necessary
  to mobilize the reserve pool of vesicles during synapse stimulation. PI4,5P: phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphates; PI: phosphatidylinositol; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; SYNJ1:
  synaptojanin 1; LRRK2: leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine-protein kinase 2; PTEN:
  phosphatase and tensin homologue; PINK1: PTEN induced putative kinase 1; DJ-1: Parkinson''s
  disease protein 7; αSYN: alpha-synuclein.'
