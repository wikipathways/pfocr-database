caption: Scheme of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)-mediated metabolic effects. 2-deoxyglucose
  (2-DG) inhibits glycolysis by blocking hexokinase and phosphohexoseisomerase. Fatty
  acids and ketone bodies, for example β-hydroxybutyrate, enter the metabolic pathway
  downstream of this block and thus enable the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
