caption: A hypothetical mechanism of action of sedative doses of THIP on the δ-GABAA
  receptors, followed by activation of CRF neurons in the ovBNST and persistent neuroplasticity
  in DA neurons of the VTA. Briefly, THIP selectively activates the ovBNST CRF neurons
  via disinhibition of one of the GABAergic inputs to ovBNST, which are enriched with
  δ-GABAA receptors (e.g., in the central nucleus of amygdala, CeA). The release of
  CRF on VTA DA cells and signaling through CRF1 receptor/PKC/HCN pathway might increase
  firing rate and induce excitatory synapse neuroplasticity in VTA DA neurons.
