caption: 'PFAM biosynthesis. PFAM biosynthesis route is not clearly defined with possible
  routes including the direct conjugation of ammonia to a fatty acid as catalyzed
  by FAAH [], a pathway that might be unfavorable in vivo []. The cytochrome c catalyzed
  reaction of ammonia with oleoyl-Coenzyme A to produce oleamide and coenzyme A was
  reported as one possible in vivo route for oleamide []. Peptidylglycine α-amidating
  monooxgenase-catalyzed cleavage of N-fatty acid glycines to the PFAMs has been proven
  in vivo []. Abbreviations: FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase; NAAA, N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing
  acid amidase.'
