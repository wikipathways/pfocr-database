caption: 'Possible signaling of G. biloba (EGb 761) induced neuroprotection and neurogenesis.We
  propose that neuroprotective mechanism(s) of EGb 761 are mediated via multiple pathways:
  1) EGb 761 activates hemeoxygenase 1 (HO1), which cleaves heme to form biliverdin
  and carbon monoxide (CO). CO increases intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate
  (cGMP) production, which mediates axon branching by activating chemoattractive semaphorin
  3A (SEMA3A) and also by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). GSK-3 inhibition
  increases the activity of collapsing response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), leading
  to cell survival and cell neuroplasticity; 2) EGb 761 activates the vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF)/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/nitric oxide (NO)
  pathway that leads to chemoattractant SEMA3A activation and angiogenesis; 3) EGb
  761 increases Wnt and activates Wnt/β-catenin pathway and, by inhibiting GSK-3,
  leads to neurogenesis, proliferation and migration; 4) EGb 761 directly activates
  brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and increases cell survival and neuroplasticity;
  and 5) EGb 761 activates netrin 1 and its receptors deleted in colorectal cancer
  (DCC) and uncoordinated gene 5B (UNC5B), leading to increased neurogenesis, proliferation
  and migration. Activation (⟶), inhibition (⊣), mutual activation (⟷).(Figure modified
  from Nada et al. Molecular Neurobiology. 2014;49:945-956.)'
