caption: 'Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling through EPRs 1–4. COX-2 conversion of
  arachidonic acid to PGH2, is utilized by mPEGS-1 to synthesize PGE2(A). PGE2 binding
  to EPRs initiates distinct signaling pathways that may lead to alterations in neuronal
  function, or result in neuroprotection or death. PGE2 ligation to EP1R leads to
  PLC-β activation, which hydrolyzes PIP2, DAG and PIP3. PIP3 binds to respective
  receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum leading to further increases in intracellular
  calcium. Alterations in calcium homeostasis as a result of EP1R signaling can lead
  to excitotoxicity and neuronal death (B). PGE2 binding to the EP2R initiates adenylyl
  cyclase activation of cAMP and PKA. PKA activates CREB which is a major transcription
  factor that can lead to synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection (C). PGE2 binding
  to EP3R inhibits ATP catalyzation by adenylyl cyclase, causing a reduction in cAMP,
  as well as an increase in intracellular calcium. This can modulate neuronal excitability
  and firing rate, and lead to cell death. PGE2signaling through the EP4R is similar
  to the EP2R pathway (D). PGE2 binding to EP4R results in similar signaling cascades
  observed following EP2R stimulation (E). Abbreviations: EP1–4, eicosanoid prostanoid
  receptors 1–4; PLC-β, phospholipase C-β; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate;
  DAG, Diacylglycerol; PIP3, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; CREB, cAMP-response
  element binding; mPEGS-1, microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1.'
