caption: Hypoxia-sensing pathway. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is a master
  regulator of hypoxia. In normoxia, HIF-1α is hydroxylated by proline hydroxylase;
  pVHL binds to the hydroxylated form of HIF-1α and serves as the recognition component
  of an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex that comprises elongins B (B) and C (C), Cullin
  2, and ring-box 1; this includes a proteosomal degradation of HIF-1α. In hypoxia,
  HIF-1α accumulates and forms a heterodimer with HIF-1β that will bind to hypoxia-responsive
  elements (HRE) and leads to an increased synthesis of the related hypoxia-responsive
  genes, such as EPO, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter
  1 (Glut1), phospho-glycerate kinase (PGK), transferrin and its receptor, and other
  genes.
