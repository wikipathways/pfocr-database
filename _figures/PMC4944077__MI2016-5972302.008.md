caption: 'Schematic representation of the proposed mode of action of tumor necrosis
  factor α (TNF-α) on the L-type voltage dependent calcium channel (L-VDCC) of the
  guinea pig airway smooth muscle. TNF-α whether exogenous or present in sensitized
  guinea pig serum (Ser-S) activates its receptor 1 (TNFR1). Afterwards, it promotes
  synthetic signaling pathways: it activates receptor interacting protein (RIP), NF-κB-inducing
  kinase (NIK), and IκB kinases (IκKs) that phosphorylate NFκB inhibitors (IκBs) activating
  nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and through TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF), map
  kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1/2), p38 MAPK,
  or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). We demonstrated that a synthetic pathway was not
  responsible for the diminution in the Ca2+ current (ICa, see ). Nevertheless, ERK
  1/2 might be directly phosphorylating serine496  (S496) on the β 2 subunit of the
  L-VDCC, favoring a downregulation of the ICa. Inset illustrates ICa in tracheal
  myocytes and contraction in tracheal rings from guinea pigs. NS implies nonsensitized
  tissues or cells and this indicates the absence of exogenous TNF-α or serum from
  Ser-S. S illustrates original recordings from sensitized tissues or cells in the
  presence of Ser-S; notice that both ICa and contraction are diminished. Other subunits
  of the L-VDCC: α 1, α 2, γ, δ. SR: sarcoplasmic reticulum.'
