caption: Model for signal transduction pathways in N. crassa. A cAMP signaling pathway
  consisting of G protein α subunits (GNA1 and GNA2), adenylyl cyclase (CR1), and
  a PKA regulatory subunit (MCB) is involved in conidiation, morphogenesis, mating,
  and stress tolerance. Ras-, MAP kinase (MAPK)-, and PKA-related kinase-mediated
  signaling pathways also regulate conidiation. How signaling is coordinated between
  these pathways remains to be elucidated.
