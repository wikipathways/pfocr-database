caption: Soluble asTF and membrane-bound flTF induces membrane receptor-mediated signaling.
  Integrins are possible candidates for mediating the effects [], leading - directly
  or indirectly - to the activation of Akt, which in turn activates NFκB. Activated
  NFκB translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of its target genes
  coded within the genomic DNA (gDNA), such as the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2
  family (e.g. Bcl-xL). The induced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members
  alters the ratio of anti- and pro-apoptotic factors towards an anti-apoptotic state.
  This prevents the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and, finally, reduces TNF-α
  induced apoptosis, resulting in increased cell survival of cardiomyocytes.
