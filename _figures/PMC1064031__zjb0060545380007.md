caption: Model of the regulatory network controlling curli production and biofilm
  formation in E. coli. Curli production at low osmolarity results from transcriptional
  activation of the csgD promoter by OmpR. When cells encounter high-salt medium,
  the Cpx pathway is activated. CpxR-P binds to the csgD promoter and consequently
  switches csgD expression off. The involvement of the regulatory systems EnvZ/OmpR,
  CpxA/CpxR, RcsC/RcsB, and H-NS in curli production is illustrated. Activation of
  all of these regulatory proteins is dependent on medium osmolarity. The different
  regulations are indicated by arrows for positive controls or via a line with a bar
  for negative controls. H-NS can exert either activation or repression, depending
  on the environmental conditions.
