caption: The cGAS-STING pathway. cGAS is activated by sensing cytoplasmic DNA. Activated
  cGAS catalyzes the formation of cGAMP. cGAMP activates STING protein, and activated
  STING recruits TBK1 and phosphorylates IRF3. Meanwhile, STING activated IKK kinase
  and phosphorylated IκB, leading to the release of NF-κB. Phosphorylated IRF3 formed
  dimer and translocated with NF-κB into the nucleus to synergistically induce the
  expression of IFN-I and various inflammatory factors. This pathway can be regulated
  by cGAS and STING modulators.
