caption: GPI anchor synthesis. This schematic shows the stepwise pathway for GPI anchor
  assembly, including the reaction and the names of the enzymes and genes involved.
  Known glycosylation disorders are highlighted in red. White and blue squares, glucosamine;
  EtNP (N connected to P with bent lines), ethanolamine phosphate; GlcNAc-PI, N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol.
  This figure was adapted from Ref. .
