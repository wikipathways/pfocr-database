caption: Schematic diagram of calreticulin (CALR) downstream signaling pathway in
  the modulation of macrophages. LPS up-regulates CALR and subsequently suppresses
  the expression and phosphorylation of STAT6, but enhances the phosphorylation of
  p38 MAPK. The improved STAT6/p38 MAPK signaling pathway increases polarization of
  Siglec F-CD206- M1 subtype macrophages and promoting ARDS/ALI through increasing
  expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and
  IL-18, etc. Anti-calreticulin antibody (aCALR) up-regulates the expression of STAT6
  and pY641-STAT6, but reduces the activation of p38 MAPK by neutralizing CALR binding
  activity to macrophages. The suppressed STAT6/p38 MAPK signaling pathway promotes
  polarization of Siglec F+CD206+ M2 subtype macrophages, causing lower expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but higher expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines,
  such as IL-10, ultimately inhibits ARDS/ALI.
