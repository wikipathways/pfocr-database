caption: Schematic representation of neural redox reactions. Stress causes an increase
  in corticosterone which activates cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors (GR). These
  translocate into the nucleus to modulate gene transcription through glucocorticoid
  responsive elements (GRE), or co-localize with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein
  and translocate into the mitochondria. This increases mitochondrial membrane potential,
  calcium holding capacity, and mitochondrial oxidation. The increase in cellular
  metabolic rate promotes ATP synthesis in addition to spontaneous superoxide (O−2)
  production via complex I and III of the electron transport chain. This is dismutated
  to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and can be
  further converted to hydroxyl radical (OH−) or reduced to water by the mitochondrial
  antioxidant pathway. In the cytosol, a major source of superoxide production is
  via the oxidation of NADPH via NADPH oxidase. Cytosolic superoxide is dismutated
  to hydrogen peroxide by copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD). Hydrogen
  peroxide is neutralized by catalase (CAT) or glutathione peroxidase (GPx) which
  oxidizes the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG). GSH
  is then regenerated from GSSG via the glutathione reductase (GSR) enzymatic system.
  Hydrogen peroxide can also interact with superoxide radicals and/or transition metals
  such as Fe2+ or Cu2+ to produce the highly toxic hydroxyl radical by Haber-Weiss
  and Fenton chemistry. An increase in the production of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide,
  and hydroxyl radicals leads to a state of cellular oxidative stress which causes
  oxidative damage to DNA, protein carbonyl formation, and membrane lipid peroxidation
  (LPO). Hydrogen peroxide is membrane permeable and moves freely from mitochondrial
  to cytosolic compartments, in addition to traversing the extracellular space to
  affect neighboring neurons and glial cells. Superoxide radicals can also induce
  oxidative stress in neighboring cells by diffusing through membrane-bound anion
  channels. The majority of neuronal and astrocytic reactive oxygen species are produced
  by mitochondrial oxidation, while other cell types such as microglia rely heavily
  on the cytosolic NADPH-oxidase system to produce a respiratory burst in response
  to invading pathogens. However, in comparison to glial cells, neurons display a
  relatively poor expression of endogenous antioxidants, making them more vulnerable
  to oxidative stress.
