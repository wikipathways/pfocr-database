caption: Relationships between differentially expressed miRNAs, putative target genes,
  and functions. Network and pathway analysis using Pathway Studio 5 shows the relationships
  among the significantly differentially expressed miRNAs, potential target genes
  (expression cutoff log2 ratio ≥± 0.4), and biological functions and disorders implicated
  by the differentially expressed target genes. Up-regulated genes and miRNAs are
  in red; down-regulated genes and miRNAs are in green.
