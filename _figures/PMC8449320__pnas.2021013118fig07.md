caption: An FGF-2 signaling pathway promotes intramuscular adipogenesis in the aged
  skeletal muscle. Binding of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) phosphorylates the
  intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),
  which activates intracellular signaling pathways including MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2)
  to phosphorylate extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2; p44/42 MAPK). MAPK
  activity increases both the abundance of Fosl1 and transactivating capacities of
  the Fos–Jun heterodimer. Phosphorylation of Fos-related antigen (FRA-1) enhances
  its binding to the activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA-binding site located in the miR-29a
  promoter to stimulate transcription. In the aged skeletal muscle, enhanced FGF-2
  signaling increases phosphorylated FRA-1 levels, which in turn promote miR-29a expression.
  Enhanced miR-29a levels stimulate differentiation of FAPs into adipocytes via the
  reduction of SPARC, promoting IMAT formation.
