caption: Summary of nitrate signaling and assimilation. Nitrate is sensed and transported
  by the NRT1.1 transceptor, changing its affinity by modifications of phosphorylation
  status and triggering a signaling pathway. Under low nitrate conditions, CIPK23
  phosphorylates NRT1.1, changing it into a high-affinity transporter. Nitrate sensing
  elicits changes in the phosphorylation status of NRT1.1, and activates, through
  PLC, calcium influx, which acts as a second messenger (A). This cascade mediates
  changes in the expression of transcription factors (TGA1/4*) and genes involved
  in nitrate transport (NRT2.1, NRT2.2 and NRT3.1) and nitrate assimilation (NIA1
  and NiR). On the other hand, AFB3 is regulated by nitrate in a PLC- and calcium-independent
  pathway (B). ABF3 modulates the expression of NAC4 and OBP4, with subsequent effects
  on root remodeling. Finally, nitrate assimilation (C) produces organic N, which
  induces miR393 and represses miR167, regulating the abundance of AFB3 and ARF8,
  respectively. Nitrate-responsive genes are depicted in lilac, transcription factors
  in purple, and microRNAs in pink. For clarity purposes, the cell nucleus is not
  shown. *TGA1 and TGA4 are redundant regulatory factors that mediate nitrate responses
  in Arabidopsis roots. However, the connection between TGA4 and the PLC–calcium pathway
  has not been experimentally validated. Other relevant transcription factors, such
  as HRS1 and NLP7, were not included in this figure because their connection with
  calcium signaling is currently unknown. (This figure is available in colour at JXB
  online.)
