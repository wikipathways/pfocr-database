caption: Initial steps of PR activation. Progestins bind to cytoplasmic PR/ER complexes,
  anchored in the cell membrane by palmitoyl residues, and activate the Src/Ras/Erk
  pathway, leading to nuclear accumulation of activated pErk. The majority of PR is
  nuclear and associated with chaperones (Hsps). Upon binding of progestins, PR homodimers
  dissociate from chaperones, and a fraction of PR is phosphorylated by pErk, which
  also phosphorylates Msk1. A “PR-activated complex” composed of pPR/pErk/pMsk1 is
  formed. Progesterone induction also activates other kinase signaling pathways as
  Janus kinase (JAK)/Stat, phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase
  (Akt), and Cdk2 (red asterisk).
