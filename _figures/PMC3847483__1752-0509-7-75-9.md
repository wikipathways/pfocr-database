caption: 'The integrated map of the starch synthesis process presented on the VANTED
  platform. The microarray data measuring gene expression in fibrous, developmental
  and mature roots of cassava were integrated into the reconstructed pathway. The
  height of the bar graph indicates the level of gene expression, while the colors
  denote the types of roots: black - fibrous root, dark grey - developmental root,
  and light grey - mature root.'
