caption: Current targets and therapies in PAH. The 4 major pathways, endothelin-1,
  prostacyclin, NO-sGC-cGMP, and calcium channel signaling involved in the regulation
  of pulmonary vasomotor tone, are shown. These pathways represent the targets of
  all currently approved and emerging PAH therapies. A, Endothelin-1 (ET-1) stimulates
  vasocontraction and proliferation through activation of both ETA and ETB receptors
  on smooth muscle cells. Either selective (ambrisentan) or nonselective (bosentan
  and macitentan) ET-I receptor antagonists can block the ET-I pathway. B, Prostacyclin
  activates vasodilation and inhibits proliferation of smooth muscle cells through
  cAMP-dependent pathway. Prostacyclin and its derivatives (epoprostenol, treprostinil,
  iloprost, and beraprost) and l-prostanoid (IP) receptor (selexipag) provide therapeutic
  benefit in PAH. C, Nitric oxide (NO) activates vasodilation and antiproliferation
  of smooth muscle cells through cGMP-dependent pathway. Inhalation of NO and administration
  of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) stimulator (riociguat) or phosphodiesterase 5
  (PDE5) inhibitors (sildenafil and tadalafil) have been shown effective in the treatment
  of PAH. D, Subsequent activation of calcium (Ca2+) channels and an increase in cytosolic
  Ca2+ free concentration in smooth muscle cells lead to vasoconstriction and proliferation.
  Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine and diltiazem) have provided therapeutic benefit
  in patients with PAH who demonstrate a positive response to the vasoreactivity test.
