caption: The cell signaling pathways involved in ischemic postconditioning. Reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) eruption after reperfusion causes dysfunction of the Akt cell
  signaling pathway, increases sσPKC activity while decreases εPKC activity. ROS also
  activates JNK and ERK activity. Furthermore, the PI3K/Akt inhibition directly results
  in dephosphorylation of GSK3β and Bad, and indirectly causes cytochrome c release
  from the mitochondria and caspases activity. Akt inhibition also results in activation
  of the transcription factor, FKHR (FOXO1), which increases Fas ligand and Bim expression.
