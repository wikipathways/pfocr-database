caption: The combination of cross-linking antibodies specific for TNFRSF members and
  innate cytokines, such as IFN-1, driven by engagement of PRR, synergize to expand
  conventional effector T cells (Tcon). Additional activity against regulatory T cells
  (Treg) likely compound the efficacy of targeting this pathway. Many members of the
  TNFRSF are inducible, while others are constitutively expressed by both Tcon and
  Treg. Nodes of metabolic activity and survival likely contribute to T cell fate
  decisions that occur after TNFRSF engagement, and could be exploited to sculpt qualities
  of T cell responses for different elements of cancer vaccine implementation, affecting
  efficacy.
