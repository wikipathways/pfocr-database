caption: A schematic representation of the mTOR signaling pathway and the cellular
  functions driven by the formation of its two main complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2.
  mTORC1 is primarily activated by growth factors and nutrients, which in turn triggers
  the activation of the PI3K/PDK1/Akt cascade. Akt promotes mTORC1 activation by inhibiting
  the TSC1/2 dimer, allowing Rheb-mediated activation of mTORC1. Both S6K1/2 and 4E-BP1/2
  are the main downstream targets of mTORC1 signaling which play crucial roles in
  protein synthesis and consequently, promote cell proliferation and growth. S6K1
  prevents continuous activation of mTORC1 signaling by phosphorylating IRS-1 via
  its negative feedback loop. Rag GTPases also promote mTORC1 activity in the presence
  of mitogens such as amino acids. Conversely, under stress conditions or when AMP
  levels increase, AMPK negatively affects mTORC1 activity by promoting the inhibitory
  effects of TSC1/2 on mTORC1. Additionally, rapamycin also acts as a negative regulator
  of mTORC1 by directly inhibiting the mTOR protein itself. Upon mTORC2 activation,
  it phosphorylates its downstream targets Akt and SGK1, promoting cell survival and
  cytoskeleton organization. PTEN negatively regulates mTORC2 activity by targeting
  one of its main components, Rictor, leading to the dissociation of the complex.
