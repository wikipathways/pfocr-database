caption: Methylosystem in the tumor microenvironment. (A) Various cells exist in the
  tumor microenvironment, including cancer cells, immune cells, and cancer-associated
  fibroblasts. (B) Cancer cells possess activated one-carbon metabolism, which comprises
  the folate cycle, methionine cycle, and trans-sulfuration pathway. One-carbon metabolism
  collaborates with the Warburg and Hoffman effects. Cancer cells can secrete microRNAs
  with m6A from the RNA methylation pathway and MNAM from the NAD+ salvage pathway.
  METTL3 function is connected with NNMT in CD44v3 cancer cells []. (C) T cells have
  unique redox regulation as the trans-sulfuration pathway of one-carbon metabolism
  plays a critical role in the maintenance and execution of T cell function []. (D)
  Pathway of one-carbon metabolism plays a role in maintenance of CAFs, which communicate
  with surrounding cells including T cells and cancer cells. CAF, cancer-associated
  fibroblast; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor;
  EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; bv, blood vessels; MNAM, 1-methylnicotinamide.
