caption: GPIb-IX and protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) signaling cooperation.
  GPIbα and PAR-1 reveal a mutual dependence for platelet activation by low thrombin
  concentrations. For full platelet activation, PAR-1 signaling and simultaneously
  a GPIb-IX–specific 14-3-3–Rac1–LIMK1 signaling pathway activation are required
