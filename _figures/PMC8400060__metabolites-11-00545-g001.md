caption: 'Overview of metabolites identified as relevant to decrease the Non-TD risk

  enrichment analysis performed with significant metabolites from . Analysis was performed
  by utilizing the KEGG database. (B). Metabolites in grey were not identified in
  this study; those in blue boxes were identified and the blue shade represents the
  value of the OR from . Abbreviations: ALA, alpha-linolenic acid; LA, linoleic acid;
  EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; DPA, docosapentaenoic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid;
  AA, arachidonic acid; DHGLA, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid; MUFAs, monounsaturated
  fatty acids; PUFAS, polyunsaturated fatty acids; SFAs, saturated fatty acids; E,
  elongase; desaturases are indicated as delta followed by the bond affected; OX,
  peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Eicosanoids with anti-inflammatory properties (resolvins,
  protectins) are indicated with thin green arrows, whereas pro-inflammatory (prostanglandins
  of the series 2 and LTB4) are indicated with thick red arrows. (C). Metabolite–disease
  analysis was performed in MetaboAnalyst.'
