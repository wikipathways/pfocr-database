caption: 'a The roles of retrotransposons in adult neurogenesis. L1 mRNA levels are
  low during NSC self-renewal and gradually increase as NSCs differentiate into neurons
  [78]. L1 is inhibited by the Sox2/HDAC1 complex formed during NSC self-renewal,
  and the inhibitory complex is reduced when NSCs differentiate into NPCs [55]. At
  this time, astrocytes secrete Wnt proteins, which trigger the Wnt-β-catenin signaling
  pathway in NSCs, in which the downstream signaling molecule TCF/LEF binds to and
  activates L1, which has been hypothesized to potentially facilitate NSC to NPC differentiation
  in this process [70–72]. During NPC differentiation into neurons, Sox11 binds to
  and activates L1 and L1 mRNA is thought to bind to the PRC2 protein, which regulates
  gene expression in NPCs and inhibits NPC differentiation [75, 76, 79]. Finally,
  the maturation of neuronal morphology during neuronal maturation is inhibited by
  L1 retrotransposition [78]. b The role of retrotransposons in embryonic neurogenesis.
  HERV-K (HML-2) expresses Env protein, which interacts with NTRK3 and CD98HC, respectively,
  and promotes hESC self-renewal and inhibits hESC differentiation [84, 85]. HERV-H

  HERV-H RNA is regulated in two ways: (1) NAT1 promotes translation of TUT7 mRNA,
  and TUT7 promotes degradation of HERV-H RNA [86]; and (2) HERV-H RNA is extensively
  modified by m6A in hESCs, and YTHDC2 specifically occupies the m6A-modified HERV-H
  RNA by interacting with the LTR7/HERV-H genomic locus. Subsequently, YTHDC2 recruits
  TET1 to prevent epigenetic silencing of HERV-H [87]. During NSC differentiation,
  L1 interacts with lncRNA to inhibit NSC differentiation [88]. It remains to be determined
  whether the mechanism of adult versus embryonic neurogenesis is conserved during
