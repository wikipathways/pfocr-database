caption: Working model for the EF24 mode of action. EF24 efficiently blocks the cytokine-induced
  nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which is important for cell survival and inflammation
  signaling. This EF24 activity is at least in part due to its inhibitory effect on
  IκB degradation and possibly through a direct inhibitory effect on the kinase activity
  of IKKβ.
