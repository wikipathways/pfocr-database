caption: (A) S-nitrosylation/S-nitrosation. This cellular modification can occur in
  different ways. First, NO can form with O2 dinitrogen trioxide N2O3 which isomerises
  to nitrosonium nitrite (NO+NO2 −) (Zakharov and Zakharov, 2009) whose nitrosonium
  NO+ reacts with a protein thiol (P-SH) to produce a nitrosothiol (P-S-N=O). In another
  pathway NO is oxidized to NO2 which reacts with a thiol group to give a thiol radical
  (-S∙) that with NO provides a nitrosothiol. The third pathway is mediated by metal
  which generates with NO a nitrosonium (NO+) (Mn+1 + NO + O2→ Mn-NO+), that adds
  to the thiol group to form a nitrosothiol (Aboalroub and Al Azzam, 2024; Ye et al.,
  2022; Reactive cysteines of proteins and glutathione (GSH) can undergo S-nitrosation
  by the peroxynitrite ONOO¯ to form S-nitrosothiol derivatives, P-SNOs and S-nitrosoglutathione
  (GSNO), respectively. Not all Cys are susceptible to S-nitrosylation. Those that
  are subject to S-nitrosylation lie within a consensus sequence that includes amino
  acids that create a hydrophobic environment. S-nitrosylation depends on several
  factors, including the acid/base and hydrophobic residues in the vicinity of the
  cysteine and the accessibility of the solvent (Marino and Gladyshev, 2010; Doulias
  et al., 2010). Notably, a hydrophobic environment attracts hydrophobic gases like
  NO and O2 and strongly enhances the rate of S-nitrosylation (Möller et al., 2007).
  S-nitrosation refers to a chemical process that occurs under physiological and pathological
  conditions in which peroxinitrite ONOO− reacts non-enzymatically with the thiol
  group to form a nitrosothiol (P-S-N=O); (B) Nitration. The one-electron oxidation
  of tyrosine produces a tyrosine radical Tyr•, which is converted into 3-nitrotyrosine
  by reaction with •NO2. As the pK value of the −OH group of Tyr is 10.3, it is 100%
  protonated at physiological pH, while the pK value drops to 7.3 during nitration
  and the -OH group is almost 50% deprotonated. This can strongly influence the structure
  of the nitrated protein
