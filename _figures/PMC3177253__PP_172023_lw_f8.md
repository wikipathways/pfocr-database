caption: Proposed regulatory pathway for seed coat mucilage biosynthesis. TTG1, EGL3/TT8,
  and MYB5/TT2 form a complex, which regulates GL2 and TTG2. LUH/MUM1 is independent
  of the other transcription factors and can activate MUM2. Since overexpression of
  MUM2 can only partially rescue the mum1 phenotype, LUH/MUM1 may be needed to activate
  other elements (the question mark) for normal mucilage production. Whether MUM2/BXL1/SBT1.7
  is also regulated by AP2 and/or the MYB5/TT2-EGL3/TT8-TTG1 complex remains to be
  determined (dashed arrow).
