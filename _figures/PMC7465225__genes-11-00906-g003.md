caption: 'Anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in the carrot. Structural enzymes of the
  phenylpropanoid pathway participating in the formation of anthocyanins are in green:

  composing theMYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complex are in purple and their regulations of
  anthocyanin-related genes are indicated by purple solid and dashed arrows when the
  regulation is confirmed or potential, respectively. Other metabolic enzymes known
  to influence anthocyanin accumulation are in black: FNS, flavone synthase; FLS,
  flavonol synthase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; ACC, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Related
  branches of competing pathways leading to the production of non-anthocyanin compounds
  are indicated in yellow. For each enzyme family, the number of corresponding coding
  genes identified in carrots (from ) is indicated in the brackets (for MBW enzymes,
  only the number of coding genes orthologous to anthocyanin-related genes from other
  species in indicated). Functionally characterized enzymes are highlighted, and DcbHLH3
