caption: The porphyrin biosynthesis pathway in the normal cell. In normal cells, endogenous
  5‐aminolevulinic acid (5‐ALA) is generated from glycine and succinyl CoA in the
  mitochondria. It is converted into several precursors in the cytoplasm, and protoporphyrin
  IX (PpIX) is synthesized in the mitochondria. Subsequently, ferrochelatase catalyzes
  the insertion of ferrous iron into PpIX to form heme and bilirubin. Heme is an important
  protein that is incorporated into the electron transport chain, which regulates
  the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in aerobic metabolism
