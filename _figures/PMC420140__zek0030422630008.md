caption: 'Schematic drawing of the hypothetical metabolic routes (glycolysis, Krebs,
  and glyoxylate cycles), modified from Tabak et al. (), involved in succinate accumulation
  in the Klsdh1Δ mutant. The major sources of NAD(P)H production during growth on
  glucose and lactate are indicated. The pentose phosphate shunt has been included
  because in K. lactis this pathway is probably constitutively operative. The NADPH
  produced in this pathway can be reoxidized directly via mitochondrial membrane dehydrogenase;
  ACS, PDC, MLS, and ICL indicate the genes coding for the following activities, respectively:
  acetyl-coA synthetase, pyruvate decarboxylase, malate synthase, and isocitrate lyase.
  LDH indicates the mitochondrial activities responsible for lactate oxidation encoded
  by the KlCYB2 and KlDLD1 genes. PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. To indicate
  the block in the SDH route, SDH has been crossed out (×).'
