caption: 'The dysregulation of lipid synthesis and related pro-oncogenic signaling
  pathways involved in BC development. The mitochondrial TCA cycle produces Ac-CoA,
  which is transformed to citrate and delivered to the cytoplasm. Citrate is transformed
  to Ac-CoA by ACLY, entering the lipid synthesis pathway. ACC and FASN convert Ac-CoA
  to SFA in the cytoplasm, constituting the basic structure of cellular membranes.
  Some of these SFAs are converted to MUFAs by SCD1, which increases membrane fluidity
  and flexibility. The Ac-CoA is converted to cholesterol through the mevalonate pathway.
  HMGR and HMGCS further synthesize cholesterol, which forms lipid rafts in the cell
  membrane. Lipid rafts provide aggregation platforms for receptors like EGFR/HER2
  and ER, facilitating the clustering and activation of signaling molecules. Additionally,
  synthesized FAs serve not only structural roles but are also stored in the cytoplasmic
  FA pool. Under high energy demands, FAs are transported into mitochondria for β-oxidation,
  generating steady energy for BC cells metabolism. The lipid metabolic pathway is
  regulated by multiple signaling pathways particularly the mTOR and PI3K/AKT pathways.
  These pathways activate transcription factors, including SREBP1/2 to upregulate
  ACLY, ACC, SCD1, and FASN, maintaining BC cells lipid and energy production efficiency.
  In hormone-dependent BC, estrogen activates the PI3K/AKT pathway via ER, boosting
  lipid production and imparting cancer cells greater proliferative potential and
  drug resistance. Lipid synthesis is a crucial metabolic pathway, promoting BC cells
  proliferation, EMT, and drug resistance, particularly exacerbating malignant traits
  in hormone-dependent BC. Abbreviations: TCA, Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle; Ac-CoA, Acetyl-Coenzyme
