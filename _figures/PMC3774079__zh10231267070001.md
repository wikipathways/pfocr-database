caption: Pathways for the provision of ornithine for citrulline synthesis. The de
  novo pathway synthesizes glutamate semialdehyde (GSA) from glutamine/glutamate and
  proline by means of glutaminase (), pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) synthase (), and
  proline oxidase (). GSA can also be utilized for the synthesis of proline (P5C reductase,
  ) and glutamate (P5C dehydrogenase, ). In the preformed pathway, ornithine originates
  from the hydrolysis of arginine (ARG arginase) or is from extracellular sources
  [ornithine transporter 1 (ORN1)]. Ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) is bidirectional
  and can synthesize or dispose of ornithine. Finally, ornithine is utilized by ornithine
  transcarbamylase (OTC) for the synthesis of citrulline.
