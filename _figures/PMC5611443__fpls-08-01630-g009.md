caption: A genetic model illustrating the role of the ARF3-PALM1 module in dissected
  leaf development in M. truncatula. The MYB domain protein PHAN negatively regulates
  transcription of ARF3 and the trans-acting short interfering RNA, tasiR-ARF, whose
  biogenesis is dependent on the AGO7-SDS6-DCL4-miRNA390 pathway, negatively regulates
  the transcript level of ARF3. ARF3 in turn negatively regulate the expression of
  PALM1, a negative regulator of the Medicago LEAFY ortholog, SGL1, which is required
  for the initiation of lateral leaflets in M. truncatula. A fine-tuned expression
  of PALM1 and SGL1 is crucial for the development of trifoliate leaves in M. truncatula.
  NAM/CUC2, whose expression is repressed directly or indirectly by PALM1, is required
  for the initiation of proximal lateral leaflets (LLp) in the palm1 mutant. Solid
  and dashed lines denote confirmed and unconfirmed molecular interactions, respectively.
  LLd, distal lateral leaflets.
