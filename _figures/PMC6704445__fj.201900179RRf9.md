caption: A schematic illustration showing the interactions between YAP1 and HBEGF,
  gonadotropin signaling transduction, and TGF-β signaling pathways in regulating
  granulosa cell (GC) proliferation and differentiation and, thereby, follicle development.
  In the growing follicle, YAP1 and HBEGF form a feedforward loop to drive GC proliferation.
  Activation of gonadotropin signaling triggers the Hippo pathway and phosphorylates
  YAP1, leading to differentiation of GCs. YAP1 activity is also essential for appropriate
  TGF-β signal transduction in GCs, which is critical for follicle development and
  oocyte maturation. Therefore, our study suggests that timely expression and activation
  of YAP1 is essential for GC function and ovarian follicle development.
