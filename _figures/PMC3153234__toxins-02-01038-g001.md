caption: Schematic of the kinase cascade and resulting cellular responses of the MAPK
  signaling pathways. (A) Generic scheme of the MAPK signaling cascade, whereby an
  extracellular stimulus activates MAPKKK, which phosphorylates and activates MAPKK,
  which phosphorylates and activates MAPK, leading to an intracellular biological
  response. (B) Schematic of the specific MAPK factors within each of the three major
  MAPK pathways. LeTx targets the MAPKK tier in the cascade, cleaving and inactivating
  all the MAPKK (MEK1-2, MKK3-7) with the exception of MKK5, the pathway for which
  is not depicted.
