caption: Schematic representation of the genetic circuits involved in the regulation
  of heparosan production. a. The QS circuit is responsible for initiating the production
  process. b. depicts the overexpression circuit, which produces the necessary enzymes
  for heparosan biosynthesis upon activation. c. illustrates the biosensors that measure
  the levels of precursors in the heparosan pathway. These signals are used by the
  biocontroller d, which generates siRNA to silence the MurA enzyme, reducing utilization
  of UDP-GlcNAc heparosan precursor to restore the balance between the UDP-sugars.
  e. shows the heparosan biosynthesis pathway, demonstrating how siRNA-mediated regulation
  affects precursor utilization. Together, these circuits enable precise control over
  heparosan production in response to cellular signals
