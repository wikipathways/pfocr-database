caption: Crosstalk between intracellular signaling pathways in female reproductive
  behavior. The schematic representation of potential signaling pathways operating
  in the hypothalamus and preoptic areas. (1) Classical genomic mechanism of action
  by progesterone- and ring-A class of progestins, mediated by nuclear PRs, plays
  a predominant role. The ligands allosterically bind to their cognate nuclear receptors
  and activate PRs to promote interactions with coactivator proteins (2) Progesterone
  effects mediated by second messengers (cAMP, cGMP) and extra-nuclear signaling kinases
  (PKA, PKC, CaMKII), activates MAPK signal transduction cascade, leading to plausible
  phosphorylation of nuclear TFs, PRs/PR coactivators, CREB, and/or its associated
  protein CBP. (3) Progesterone and progestins, act via the Src kinase, to interact
  with extranuclear PRs and activate MAPK cascade. (4) Progesterone acting via the
  extra-nuclear PKA/MAPK/DARPP-32 pathway can cause a decrease in phosphatase activity
  and an increase in phosphorylation of PR and/or its coactivators. (5) Mating stimuli
  (VCS) and dopamine D1 agonist can stimulate PKA activation. D1 agonist-stimulated
  PKA-mediated pathway phosphorylates DARPP-32, which inhibits PP1, leading to the
  activation of CREB/PR/coactivators. VCS-stimulated PKA activation can also interact
  with MAPK cascade. (6) Neuropeptides, nucleotides, GnRH and PGE2 can act through
  various receptor- and/or second messengers (cAMP, cGMP, NO) and transmit signals
  to the nuclear PRs or other TFs. Interactions between the signal transduction pathways
  may serve as an amplification mechanism to converge on nuclear TFs and/or coactivators
  to regulate gene transcription and translation to facilitate female reproductive
  behavior.
