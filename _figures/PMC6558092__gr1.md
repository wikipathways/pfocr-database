caption: PD-1 signaling pathway in T cells.When engaged with a ligand, PD-1 becomes
  phosphorylated at its cytoplasmic tyrosine residue, leading to binding of protein
  tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), such as SHP2. SHP2 can dephosphorylate kinases and
  antagonize the positive signals that occur through TCR and CD28 receptors, resulting
  in inhibition of effort T cell function and T cell exhaustion. Additionally, PD-1
  can inhibit T cell functions by increasing the expression of transcription factors
  such as BATF, which can further counter the signals downstream of TCR and CD28 co-stimulation.

  description: PD-1 signaling pathway in T cells.When engaged with a ligand, PD-1
    becomes phosphorylated at its cytoplasmic tyrosine residue, leading to binding
    of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), such as SHP2. SHP2 can dephosphorylate
    kinases and antagonize the positive signals that occur through TCR and CD28 receptors,
    resulting in inhibition of effort T cell function and T cell exhaustion. Additionally,
    PD-1 can inhibit T cell functions by increasing the expression of transcription
    factors such as BATF, which can further counter the signals downstream of TCR
    and CD28 co-stimulation.
