caption: Phosphatidylcholines constitute a major metabolic signature of VAT versus
  SAT. (A) A metabolic map of the glycerophospholipid pathway [modified from the KEGG
  pathway ()]. The gene expression of enzymes of the pathway, as found in the GTEx
  database, is shown as rectangles and the relative lipid accumulation found in our
  lipidomics study is shown as circles. (B–O) The accumulation of phospholipids found
  by our lipidomics study, and key enzymes for differential lipid groups found by
  qRT-PCR experiments. Blue lines represent a change of ≥10% in the SAT:VAT ratio.
  Red lines represent a change of ≤ −10% in the SAT:VAT ratio. Black lines represent
  a similar accumulation ±10%. n = 17; error bars represent SEMs; 1-tailed  paired t
  test. AGPS, alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase; CDP, cytidine diphosphate;
  CEPT, choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase; CHKA, choline kinase alpha; CHPT1,
  choline phosphotransferase 1; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; PCYT1A,phosphate
  cytidylyltransferase 1, choline, alpha;PEMT, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase;
  qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR; SAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue;
  VAT, visceral adipose tissue.
