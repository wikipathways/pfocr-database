caption: 'Regulation of the autophagic pathway by growth factors receptors. Autophagy
  is activated by nutrient deprivation, growth factor receptors (GF-R), infection,
  cancer, or other factors. Autophagy can be divided into several steps: (1) Cytoplasmic
  material is sequestered in a phagophore through the processes of nucleation and
  elongation of the isolation membrane induced by the autophagy-related protein LC3-II.
  (2) The edges of the phagophore then fuse to form the autophagosome. (3) The mature
  autophagosome membrane fuses with a lysosome to form the autolysosome, exposing
  the cytoplasmic content to lysosomal hydrolases. (4) Finally, proteins are degraded
  and recycled to the cytosol. The activation of some GF-R, such as the keratinocyte
  growth factor receptor (KGFR), induces autophagy through upregulation of several
  proautophagic genes or lipidation of LC3. LC3-II and p62 are important autophagy
  mediators, represented as red and green circles, respectively. LC3 is cleaved by
  ATG4 to generate LC3-I. LC3-I is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by
  ATG7 and ATG3. The lipidated form of LC3-II attaches to the autophagosome membrane.
  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase provides the major inhibitory signal
  to autophagy in the setting of nutrient abundance; conversely, miR-338 promotes
  autophagy by inhibiting mTOR. With the exception of miR-338, all microRNAs in the
  figure are involved in inhibition of autophagy. Pirarubicin (THP), an anticancer
  anthracycline, induces autophagy through downregulation of miR-34c-5p which upregulates
  the autophagy-related gene ATG4B. The chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel interacts
