caption: Probiotics provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits for the host.
  This probiotic encourages growth or production of menaquinones. An increase in NO
  and menaquinone (MQ) reduces oxidative stress. Alternatively, outside stressors
  (exercise, physical strain) induce oxidative stress. The microbiome responds to
  these changes by changing the composition or regulation of pathways to promote increased
  production of menaquinones and NO
