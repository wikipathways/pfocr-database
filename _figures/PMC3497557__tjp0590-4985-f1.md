caption: 'When exposed to low O2, membrane-associated haemoglobin releases O2. The
  associated conformational change in the haemoglobin molecule associated with its
  desaturation results in local membrane deformation and activation of Gi. This leads
  to activation of AC and increase in cAMP, the level of which is regulated by PDE3B
  activity. Increases in cAMP activate PKA and, subsequently, CFTR. The final conduit
  for ATP release in this pathway is pannexin 1. Abbreviations: Gi, heterotrimeric
  G protein; PDE3B, phosphodiesterase 3B; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; AMP,
  adenosine monophosphate; AC, adenylyl cyclase; PKA, protein kinase A; CFTR, cystic
  fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; (+),
  activation; (−), inhibition.'
