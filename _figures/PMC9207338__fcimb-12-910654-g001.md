caption: Localization and signaling pathways of nucleic acids sensing TLRs. TLR3,
  TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are localized in endosomes or endolysosomes. Upon ligands ligation
  of each TLRs, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 recruit the adaptor molecules MyD88 to activate
  downstream signaling pathways. MyD88 recruits IRAKs and TRAF6, subsequently activating
  TAK1. TAK1 activates NF-κB, leading to induction of proinflammatory cytokines. TLR7
  and TLR9 induce IRF7 activation by interacting with TRAF3, TRAF6, IRAK1 and IKKα,
  resulting in the induction of type I IFNs in pDCs. TLR3 recruits TRIF to activate
  downstream signaling pathways. TRIF recruits TRAF3 and TRAF6, subsequently, activating
  TAK1 and TBK1, which leads to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and type
  I IFNs via NF-κB and IRF3 respectively. RIG-I and MDA5 recognize cytosolic RNA from
  pathogens. RNA binding to RIG-I and MDA5 causes the exposure of its CARDs domain.
  Activated RIG-I and MDA5 interact with adaptor molecule, IPS-1 (also known as MAVS),
  leading to oligomerization on the mitochondrial membrane and activating downstream
  signaling pathway via TRAF3, TRAF6, TBK1 and IKKs, which leads to production of
  proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs via NF-κB and IRF3, respectively. Cytosolic
  DNA sensor, cGAS, recognize cytosolic DNA. Upon DNA binding, cGAS synthetases the
  cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP. cGAMP subsequently binds to STING on the ER and STING
  traffics to ER-Golgi intermediated compartment and Golgi apparatus, activating downstream
  signaling pathway via TBK1 and IKKs that lead to production of type I IFNs. NLRP3
  and AIM2 inflammasome are also activated by cytosolic DNA. NLRP3 senses mitochondrial
  DNA, leading to the formation of the inflammasome and the release of IL-1β and IL-18.
  AIM2 also senses cytosolic bacterial DNA, leading to the formation of the inflammasome
  and the release of IL-1β and IL-18.

  description: Localization and signaling pathways of nucleic acids sensing TLRs.
    TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are localized in endosomes or endolysosomes. Upon ligands
    ligation of each TLRs, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 recruit the adaptor molecules MyD88
    to activate downstream signaling pathways. MyD88 recruits IRAKs and TRAF6, subsequently
    activating TAK1. TAK1 activates NF-κB, leading to induction of proinflammatory
    cytokines. TLR7 and TLR9 induce IRF7 activation by interacting with TRAF3, TRAF6,
    IRAK1 and IKKα, resulting in the induction of type I IFNs in pDCs. TLR3 recruits
    TRIF to activate downstream signaling pathways. TRIF recruits TRAF3 and TRAF6,
    subsequently, activating TAK1 and TBK1, which leads to the induction of proinflammatory
    cytokines and type I IFNs via NF-κB and IRF3 respectively. RIG-I and MDA5 recognize
    cytosolic RNA from pathogens. RNA binding to RIG-I and MDA5 causes the exposure
    of its CARDs domain. Activated RIG-I and MDA5 interact with adaptor molecule,
    IPS-1 (also known as MAVS), leading to oligomerization on the mitochondrial membrane
    and activating downstream signaling pathway via TRAF3, TRAF6, TBK1 and IKKs, which
