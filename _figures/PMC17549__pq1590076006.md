caption: Model for the role of Hsl7p during filamentous growth. Hsl7p binds to Ste20p
  to repress its activity. In response to nitrogen starvation, Ras2p activates Cdc42p
  and activated Cdc42p interferes with binding of Hsl7p to Ste20p. Two 14–3-3 proteins,
  Bmh1p and Bmh2p, which are essential for the pathway leading to pseudohyphal growth,
  also interact with the C terminus of Ste20p ().
