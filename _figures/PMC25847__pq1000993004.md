caption: The hypothesized effects of ketones on metabolic blocks induced by Aβ1–42
  and MPP+. Usually brain entirely depends for energy on the mitochondrial metabolism
  of pyruvate produced from glucose by the glycolytic pathway. Aβ1–42 is reported
  to stimulate the phosphorylation of the E1a subunit of PDH by glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β (). Phosphorylation of PDH blocks the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl
  CoA, which is required to fuel the TCA cycle, which provides mitochondrial NADH
  needed to power electron transport. Ketones provide the only alternative source
  of acetyl CoA for brain during inhibition of the PDH multienzyme complex. In so
  doing, ketone bodies not only increase mitochondrial acetyl CoA, citrate, and the
  first 1/3 of TCA cycle metabolites but also reduce the free mitochondrial NAD couple
  and oxidize the mitochondrial coenyzme Q couple, causing an increase in the ΔG of
  ATP hydrolysis (). The oxidation of the coenzyme Q couple by ketones would tend
  to decrease the major source of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, the semiquinone
  form of coenzyme Q (), while at the same time relieving product inhibition of NADH
  dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.5.3), accounting for the ability of ketones to decrease MPP+
  toxicity.
