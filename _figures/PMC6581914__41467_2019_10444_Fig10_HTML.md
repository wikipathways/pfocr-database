caption: Scheme and working model. a Schematic of the metabolic changes in β-cells
  overexpressing rIAPP, hIAPP, or hIAPP silenced for PFKFB3. In comparison with INS
  832/13 overexpressing rIAPP, cells transduced with hIAPP show fragmentation of the
  mitochondrial network and upregulation of glycolysis with lactate production. PFKFB3
  siRNA partly reverts these metabolic changes in cells overexpressing hIAPP. b Working
  model illustrating hIAPP toxicity induces increased β-cell cytosolic [Ca2+], initially
  most likely as a consequence of the nonselective membrane permeability at the ER.
  In response to high cytosolic [Ca2+], mitochondria adopt a defensive fragmented
  posture leading to reduced TCA momentum and metabolic pseudo-hypoxia important for
  activation of HIF1α and its target PFKFB3. PFKFB3 enhances the aerobic glycolysis
  that diverts pyruvate into lactate and stimulates the pentose phosphate pathway
  to forge repair. However, glycolysis also produces ATP that may sustain the closure
  of the K(ATP) channels and concomitantly, Ca2+ influx

  the expense of β-cell function.
