caption: The metabolite NAD+ oscillates in a circadian manner. Recent studies (; )
  have shown that the circadian clock machinery controls the cyclic synthesis of NAD+
  through control of the NAD+ salvage pathway. The gene encoding the enzyme NAMPT,
  whose transcription is the rate-limiting step in the NAD+ salvage pathway, contains
  E-boxes and is controlled by CLOCK–BMAL1. A crucial step in the NAD+ salvage pathway
  is controlled by SIRT1, which also contributes to the regulation of the Nampt promoter
  by associating with CLOCK–BMAL1 in the CLOCK chromatin complex (see ). Thus, the
  feedback transcriptional loop of circadian regulation is closely linked to an enzymatic
  feedback loop. Through this regulation, SIRT1 controls the cellular levels of its
  own coenzyme NAD+. NAD+, nicotinamide adenin dinucleotide; NAM, nicotinamide; NMN,
  nicotinamide mononucleotide; ~, oscillation of CCGs (Nampt) and metabolites (NAD+).
