caption: 'A hypothetical model for the role of SbSLSP in abiotic stress tolerance.
  The model represents the established signaling cascade under abiotic stresses. The
  hypothesized plausible role of SbSLSP in stress tolerance was represented by broken
  lines. Constitutive overexpression of SbSLSP protein may leads to increased clathrin
  coated vesicles mediated endocytosis leading to higher accumulation of PtsIns(4,5)P2and
  then PA mediated stress signaling, which increased the efficiency of transporters
  and cell membrane stability. The SbSLSP somehow increased the transcript expression
  of PLC gene which may contribute to the increased Ca2+ mediated signaling pathway.
  Conclusively all these pathways converge together and results in better abiotic
  stress tolerance in the transgenic plants. CCVs: Clathrin coated vesicles; PtsIns(4,5)
  P2: phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate; PLC: phospholipase C; PLD: phospholipase
  D; PA: phosphatidic acid; InsP3: inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate; DAG: diacylglycerol;
  PKC: protein kinase C.'
