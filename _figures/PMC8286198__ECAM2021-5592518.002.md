caption: Accumulation of flavonoids in the three tissues. (a) The heatmap scale ranges
  from −1 to +1 after data homogenization. (b) The biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids.
  The green color text indicates that the relative concentration was higher in the
  roots than in the other tissues, the purple color text indicates that the relative
  concentration was higher in the fruit, and the yellow color text indicates that
  the relative concentration was higher in the leaves.
