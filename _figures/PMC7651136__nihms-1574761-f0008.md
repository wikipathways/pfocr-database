caption: Targeting UV-induced signaling pathways to suppress skin carcinogenesis.
  UV-induced DNA lesions stall DNA replication forks and activate the ATR pathway.
  The ATR pathway maintains genome integrity, allowing cells to survive UV-induced
  DNA damage but possibly with unrepaired lesions that become mutations (‘mutagenic
  survival’). Thus, chronic UV exposure will increase mutation burden, accumulating
  cancer driver mutations that may promote skin cancer development. UV-induced p53
  upregulates XPC, which facilitates DNA repair and prevents metabolic alterations
  that drive cancer. UV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate the EGFR and
  p38 MAPK pathways, contributing to skin cancer development. HMGB1 released from
  UV-damaged keratinocytes activates the TLR4 pathway, which can drive skin cancer
  via inflammation and immunosuppression. Inhibiting ATR (via caffeine), ROS (via
  the tea polyphenol EGCG), or TLR4 (via resatorvid) has been demonstrated to prevent
  UV-induced skin carcinogenesis in vivo.
