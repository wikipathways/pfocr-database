caption: (1) In colonocytes, Cl− secretion is regulated by the concerted action of
  different apical and basolateral membrane ion channels and transporters, which promote
  vectorial apical fluid secretion. (2) E2, acting via a membrane-associated ERα receptor,
  rapidly activates a signalling pathway involving the phosphorylation of PKCδ and
  AMPK. AMPK in turn activates Nedd4.2, which then binds and ubiquitinylates KCNQ1
  to cause its internalization. 17β-oestradiol, via PKCδ, induces the dissociation
  between KCNQ1 and KCNE3 to reduce channel conductance. (3) The ubiquitinylated KCNQ1
  is internalized through a clathrin-mediated mechanism. (4) The combined effect of
  KCNQ1:KCNE3 dissociation and retrieval of KCNQ1 from the plasma membrane reduces
  the electrical driving force for apical Cl− secretion by the inhibition of basolateral
  K+ recycling. The inhibition of Cl− secretion leads to a decrease in fluid secretion.
  (5) KCNQ1 internalization is mediated by Rab5; the channel is accumulated in early
  endosomes (EEs). (6) A subset of KCNQ1 channels is subjected to a fast recycling
  via Rab4. (7) Another pool of endocytosed KCNQ1 is sequestered into recycling endosomes
  (REs) and finally recycled back to the plasma membrane via Rab11. This complex recycling
  mechanism allows the cell to finely tune Cl− secretion via modulation of the KCNQ1
  surface abundance. CCV, Clathrin coated vesicles; CME, clathrin mediated endocytosis;
