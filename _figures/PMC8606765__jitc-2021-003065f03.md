caption: Depiction of CAR and coreceptor constructs utilizing the TLR signaling pathway.
  (A) Third-generation, CD19-targeting, 1928T2z CAR construct incorporating the intracellular
  TIR signaling domain derived from TLR2, alongside the intracellular signaling domain
  of CD28 and CD3ζ. (B) Third-generation, CD19-targeting, CAR.MC.ζ construct incorporating
  a truncated version of MyD88 lacking its TIR domain and the intracellular signaling
  portion of CD40 alongside CD3ζ. (C) CD8α:MyD88, a synthetic coreceptor that fuses
  together the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD8α and the intermediate
  and death domains of MyD88. CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88; TIR, toll/interleukin-1 receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor.
