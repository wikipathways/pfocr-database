caption: 'Schematic illustration vitamin D canonical signalling pathway and its role
  on mechanisms relevant to PAD formation. The biologically active form of vitamin
  D3 is 1,25(OH)2D3, is a ligand for a nuclear transcription factor VDR. VDR is present
  in most cell types and once the VDR is bound with 1,25(OH)2D3, then it translocates
  to the nucleus. VDR has a binding site that recognises the target sequence in the
  genome. VDR binds to genomic DNA after it dimerizes with RXR. The genomic region
  that binds to VDR and 1,25(OH)2D3 is restricted by CTCF protein, which defines the
  TAD. CTCF is a transcription factor which is often found near the TSS on the chromatin.
  For 1,25(OH)2D3 to initiate transcription, the target gene should have its TSS and
  at least one VDR binding site at a location within the same chromatin. The vitamin
  D target genes that fall within the TAD region of a chromatin will undergo gene
  expression. Genes containing a specific promoter region known as VDRE will allow
  the binding of VDR-RXR dimers to the VDRE region and recruit transcriptional machinery
  including transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Abbreviations: CTCF, CCCTC-binding
  factor; PAD, peripheral arterial disease; RXR, Retinoid X Receptor; TAD, Topologically
  Associated Domain; TSS, Transcription Start Site; VDR, Vitamin D Receptor; VDRE,
  Vitamin D Response Elements.'
