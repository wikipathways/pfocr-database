caption: 'Summary of important signaling pathways in BCSCs. (a) The Wnt signaling
  pathway is activated when Wnt ligands bind to the receptor complex, which dissociates
  β-catenin from the destruction complex and activates β-catenin as the transcriptional
  co-activator within the LEF/TCF transcriptional complex. In BCSCs, several frizzled
  receptors are upregulated and several miRNAs are altered in expression. (b) The
  Notch signaling pathway is induced by juxtacrine interactions between Dll or JAG1/2
  and Notch receptors, resulting in the release of NICD as the transcription factor
  for activation of a panel of genes. The expression of Dll and JAG1/2 ligands can
  be elevated from several cellular sources within the BCSC microenvironment to induce
  juxtacrine activation of Notch signaling in BCSCs. MAP17 inhibits NUMB, the antagonist
  of NICD, to activate Notch signaling pathway in BCSCs. (c) The activation of HH
  signaling pathway initiates from HHs binding to the PTCH receptor, leading to the
  de-repression of SMO. The GLI 1/2/3 translocate to the nucleus and form the transcriptional
  complex to activate gene expression. In BCSCs, PTCH1, SMO, and GLIs are upregulated
  to enhance the HH signaling pathway. (d) The canonical NF-κB signaling pathway is
  initiated from various receptors including TNFR, which activates the trimeric IKK
  complex via several steps. The IKK complex induces the ubiquitin-dependent degradation
  of IκBα, which results in the nuclear translocation of canonical NF-κB dimer RelA/p50.
  The non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway can also be initiated by several TNFR
  superfamily members such as RANKL. NIK and IKKα are required for propagating non-canonical
  signaling pathways. This process induces the degradation of p100, leading to the
  generation of the RELB/p52 dimer that translocates to the nucleus. In BCSCs, the
  activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway is associated with BCSC self-renewal and
  the expression level of BCSC markers. Moreover, some crucial transcription factors,
  such as Oct-4, Nanog, and SOX2, are consistently activated in BCSCs to maintain
  their self-renewal capacity. Key abbreviations: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli;
