caption: Vicious cycle of bone metastasis. Tumor-derived factors such as OPN, PTHrP,
  heparanase, IL-1, IL-6 and PGE2 enhance the osteoclasts formation and promote bone
  resorption.,  Resorbed bones release bone-derived growth factors, such as IGF1,
  PDGF, and TGFβ, and calcium, which in turn stimulate tumor growth. Tumor cells that
  reach in the bone microenvironment secrete PTHrP to initiate osteolysis and stimulate
  bone lining osteoblasts. In response, the expression of RANKL is upregulated by
  activated osteoblasts and binds to its receptor RANK to activate RANKL-RANK signaling
  pathway, and leading to bone resorption
