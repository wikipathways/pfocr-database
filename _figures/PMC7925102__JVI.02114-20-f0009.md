caption: Working model depicting how VACV B1 and B12 converge with cellular VRK kinase
  signaling in a manner critical for viral replication. This manuscript elucidates
  that B12 forms a complex with VRK1 and interferes with its downstream signaling.
  The presence of B12 inhibits viral DNA replication and is either mediated primarily
  by BAF in some cell types or likely involves additional VRK1 and VRK2 substrates
  as well in other cell types. The antiviral action of B12 can be observed in the
  absence of B1, indicating that B1 complements for inhibited VRK1 and/or that B1
  may regulate B12 via a posited upstream pathway as suggested by the dotted line.
