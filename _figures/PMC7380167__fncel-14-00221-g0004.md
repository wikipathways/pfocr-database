caption: Schematic representation of neuroprotective effects mediated by the activation
  of the VPAC receptors in glial cells. In astrocytes (A) VPAC2R activation promotes
  the secretion of neurotrophic and neuroprotective factors, in addition to prevent
  neurons from excitotoxicity by enhancing the glutamate re-uptake in astrocytes.
  These actions are associated with adenylyl cyclase (AC)/protein kinase A (PKA) activation.
  In microglia (B) the stimulation of VPAC1R inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory
  agents through the activation of the PKA signaling pathway and protects against
  β-amyloid fibrils enhancing the microglia phagocytic function via protein kinase
  C (PKC) activation.
