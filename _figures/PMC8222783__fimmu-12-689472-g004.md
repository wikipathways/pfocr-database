caption: The B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway and the corresponding germline
  mutations found in man, or only generated in mice (molecules marked with ). Proteins
  marked as  represent Loss-of-Function (LoF) mutations with defects limited to B
  cells, whereas the LoF mutations marked as  cause defects not limited to B cells.
  The corresponding filled symbols mark Gain-of-Function (GoF). CARD11 and SYK, which
  are the only proteins affected by either GoF or LoF, appear as two molecules. LoF
  mutations in the NF-κB pathway cause B cell defects, whereas those affecting AP-1
  signaling result in GoF RASopathies marked as . The single LoF mutation in the NFAT
  pathway affects the ITPKB gene causing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID),
  primarily influencing development of the T cell lineage.
