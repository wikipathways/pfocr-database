caption: 'Schematic diagram of P. aeruginosa Cup fimbriae-mediated T6SS virulence
  activation of host PDE4C leading to cell damage. The RetS-GacS/GacA regulatory pathway
  controls the switch on/off T6SS and T3SS by modulating the levels of small RNAs
  (RsmZ and RsmY) that sequester the translation repressor RsmA. Subsequently, the
  effectors of T6SS thereby activating the PDE4C pathway in host cell A549. The PDE4C
  catalyzes the conversion of the secondary messenger molecule cAMP to AMP, thereby
  modulating the PKA. This process partially elicits the production of inflammatory
  cytokines, ROS, and other cellular responses, ultimately culminating in cellular
  damage. Concurrently, deletion of the retS gene alleviates the repression of hptC-PA0034
  operon expression, thereby enhancing the transcription of the cupC operon. The up-regulation
  of the cupC operon promotes the assembly of Cup fimbriae, which mediate bacterial
  adhesion to host cells and facilitate the contact-dependent delivery of T6SS effectors.

  Dashed line indicates a predicted regulatory role'
