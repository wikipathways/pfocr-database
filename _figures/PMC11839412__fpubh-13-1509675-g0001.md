caption: Roles of the relationship between CD133, AKT, and MAPK signaling in cell
  cycle regulation (By Figdraw.). CD133 directly modulates the AKT, MAPK, and ERK
  pathways, influencing the cell cycle progression of cancer stem cells (CSCs). AKT
  regulates the G1/S phase transition by activating downstream proteins such as mTOR,
  GSK3-β, CCND1, and P27Kip1, while also controlling CD133 expression through GLI1.
  The MAPK pathway, including key molecules such as c-KIT/PDGFRB and Erk1/2, directly
  or indirectly regulates CD133 expression and participates in cell cycle control.
  Notably, proteins such as P21 and TP53 can induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through
  MAPK signaling. Additionally, CD133 interacts with other important molecules, including
  GRP78, MTJ1, and EGFR, further activating PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways,
  which collectively influence the cell cycle
