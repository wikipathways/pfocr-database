caption: According to the data shown in this report, Hic-5 can be induced by ROS-JNK
  pathway and transactivated by c-jun and AP4 which may in turn interact with Rac1
  and Traf4, and Pyk2 triggering activation of NADPH oxidase, ROS generation and JNK
  phosphorylation thus sustaining the signal transduction. In this way, Hic-5 may
  play a central role in mediating the positive feedback ROS-JNK signaling circuit
  which upregulates Snail, Zeb-1, and MMP-9 and downregulate E-cadherin for triggering
  HCC migration and progression of HCC
