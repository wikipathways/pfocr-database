caption: A). FABP1, not detectable in brain, binds and enhances uptake of arachidonic
  acid (ARA) translocated by fatty acid translocase protein (FATP) in the plasma membrane
  in cultured cells and likely also in hepatocytes. Within hepatocytes the FABP1 may
  facilitate transport/targeting of bound ARA to endoplasmic reticulum for incorporation
  into phospholipids from which AEA and 2-AG are subsequently derived. B) Alternately,
  FABP1 mediated hepatic uptake may diminish plasma availability for ARA for uptake
  and conversion into phospholipids from which AEA and 2-AG are derived in brain.
  Most brain ARA is derived from plasma and rapid hepatic ARA clearance accounts for
  nearly 50% of ARA removal from the blood. C) By binding other non-ARA containing
  N-acylethanolamides and 2-monoacylglycerols (EC*s) such as oleoylethanolamide (OEA),
  palmitoylethanolamide(PEA), 2-oleoylglycerol (2-OG), or 2-palmitoylglycerol (2-PG),
  FABP1 may influence their synthesis release at the endoplasmic reticulum, transport
  for efflux at the plasma membrane, re-uptake from the plasma membrane, and targeting
  for degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum analogous to those of AEA and 2-AG
  (). D) By binding other EC*s, FABP1 may exert effects on the SREBP1 lipogenic and
  PPARα oxidative pathways opposite to those of AEA and 2-AG (). For example, the
  EC* ligands may exert their effects through G protein-coupled receptors other than
  CB1/CB2 (GPCR*s). For instance, OEA is known to suppress the SREBP1 pathway to reduce
  lipogenesis while enhancing lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation through the PPARα
  pathway, likely through activation of GPR119 (–, ). Conversely, FABP1 transports
  bound ARA and/or EC* into the nucleus for interaction with and induction of PPARα.
