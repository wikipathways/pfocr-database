caption: Direct and indirect pathways of Basal Ganglia in initiating motor activity.
  In the direct pathway, cerebral cortical input to the striatum causes activation
  of inhibitory neurons in the striatum which then causes an increased inhibitory
  output to the globus pallidus internal [GPi]. There is a decreased inhibitory output
  from GPi to ventral anterior [VA] and ventral lateral [VL] nuclei of the thalamus
  which then projects via excitatory pathways into the premotor cortex. The direct
  pathway is involved in regulating tonic excitation in the premotor cortex which
  is an area involved in planning and initiating movement. The indirect pathway is
  inhibitory to movement when excitatory projection from cerebral cortex facilitates
  inhibitory projection neurons in globus pallidus external [GPe]. These then inhibit
  tonic inhibitory output neurons which decreases tonic inhibition of subthalamic
  nucleus [STN] resulting in increased excitatory output to GPi. Excitatory input
  to GPi increases inhibitory output from GPi to thalamus which then decreases excitatory
  feedback to cerebral cortex leading to inhibition of motor activity. Dopamine promotes
  action of direct pathway while suppressing the activity of indirect pathway.
