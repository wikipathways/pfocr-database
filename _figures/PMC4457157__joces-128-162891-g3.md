caption: Crosstalk between growth factor and adhesion protein signaling. Illustrated
  here are the intracellular signaling pathways and crosstalk between integrin, growth
  factor and cadherin signaling. β3 integrin signals through the same intracelullar
  pathways as TGF-β1, which increase expression of α-SMA and cellular contractility.
  β1 integrin shares pathways with both TGF-β1 and FGF, which may in part explain
  its context-dependent effects on MyoFB differentiation. Cadherins regulate the availability
  of β-catenin to participate in Wnt signaling, a pathway that promotes cadherin switching
  and fibrosis. Both integrins and cadherins mechanically link the ECM and the actin
  cytoskeleton, and are sensitive to increases in applied force from extracellular
  or intracellular sources; therefore, increased expression of α-SMA in MyoFBs forms
  a positive feedback loop to further promote adhesion stability and associated signaling
  pathways.
