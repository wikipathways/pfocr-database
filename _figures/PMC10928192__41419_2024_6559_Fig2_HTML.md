caption: TNF stimulation predominantly induces the formation of TNF/TNFR1 complex
  I, leading to activation of pro-inflammatory NF-κB and MAPK signalling pathways.
  However, TNF/TNFR1 signalling may also trigger apoptosis and necroptosis via complex
  IIa and IIb, respectively. 1 TNF/TNFR1-disrupting agents, such as SMAC mimetics
  and TAK1 inhibitors, can promote the dissociation of complex I and formation of
  complex II. In complex IIa, RIPK1 associates with TRADD, FADD, cFLIP, and pro-caspase
  8. The high local concentration of pro-caspase 8 induces caspase 8 activation through
  autocleavage and trans-cleavage from other active caspases. Caspase 8 then cleaves
  and activates caspase 3, which in turn cleaves downstream components to induce apoptosis.
  2 If caspase activation is inhibited, complex IIb can prevail as the dominant signalling
  pathway. In this pathway, RIPK1 is phosphorylated by RIPK3, causing it to dissociate
  from complex IIa and instead form a RIPK1-RIPK3 pro-necrotic complex. RIPK3 then
  directly phosphorylates MLKL, causing it to oligomerise and translocate to the plasma
  membrane. MLKL binds to phosphatidylinositol phosphates on the membrane’s inner
  leaflet and disrupts the integrity of the cell membrane, resulting in the release
  of intracellular contents. This process leads to cell swelling, rupture, and ultimately
  culminates in cell death by necroptosis
