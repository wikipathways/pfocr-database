caption: This study identifies CaMKII‐α as a therapeutic target for TCL and reports
  the discovery of Evans Blue, a selective small‐molecule inhibitor of CaMKII‐α, through
  high‐throughput screening (HTS). Experiments demonstrate that Evans Blue can inhibit
  TCL cell proliferation by modulating the PI3K‐AKT signaling pathway. These findings
  confirm the efficacy of Evans Blue in treating TCL and highlight its potential as
  a novel therapeutic agent
