caption: Podocyte insulin signaling. Podocytes are the first cells to interact with
  insulin at the nephron and express several proteins of the canonical insulin signaling
  pathway. However, here the podocyte-specific protein nephrin is known to have a
  role in the trafficking of glucose transporters (GLUT1 or GLUT4) to podocyte membrane
  and consequently promote glucose uptake. The trafficking seems to involve Vamp2
  and actin remodeling. On the other branch of insulin signaling, an effect in the
  large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BKCa) is also important for maintenance
  of podocyte integrity and proper glomerular filtration. GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2; GSV, GLUT storage vesicle; VAMP2, Vesicle-associated membrane protein
  2.
