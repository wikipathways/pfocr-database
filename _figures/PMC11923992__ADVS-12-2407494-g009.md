caption: PTM Regulation of YAP in Obesity‐Driven Chemoresistance and the Impact of
  Retatrutide in TNBC. Increased levels of glucose and glutamine in obese states enhance
  the activity of GFAT and subsequently the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP),
  leading to elevated UDP‐GlcNAc levels. Higher UDP‐GlcNAc levels boost the activity
  of O‐GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which facilitates the O‐GlcNAcylation of YAP. Enhanced
  O‐GlcNAcylation leads to reduced ubiquitylation of YAP, by facilitating the interactions
  with deubiquitinase EIF3H. Consequently, stabilized YAP accumulates and translocates
  to the nucleus, where it promotes gene transcription that supports tumorigenesis
  and chemoresistance. The metabolic weight loss drug Retatrutide alters the metabolic
  environment, reducing the levels of substrates necessary for YAP O‐GlcNAcylation.
  This reprogramming diminishes YAP's stabilization, thereby enhancing the sensitivity
  of tumor cells to chemotherapy
