caption: Metabolic pathways of monoamines. (A) 5-HT metabolic pathway. (B) Octopamine/dopamine
  metabolic pathway. Only the monoamines that we could measure in the high-performance
  liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay for the Lymnaea central nervous system (CNS)
  are indicated. This figure was modified from Aonuma et al. (). This article was
