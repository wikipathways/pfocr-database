caption: Mannose inhibits tumor metastasis by relieving epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT). Mannose could reduce the activation of the ERK pathway and increase the phosphorylation
  of GSK-3β. The phosphorylation of GSK-3β will reduce the phosphorylation level of
  tyrosine 654 at β-catenin and inhibit the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. The
  reduction of β-catenin in the nuclear down-regulates SNAIL expression, and the down
  regulation of SNAIL could promote E-cadherin expression. This regulatory mechanism
  results in the inhibition of tumor EMT.
