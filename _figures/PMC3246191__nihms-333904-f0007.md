caption: Chronic morphine decreases VTA DA soma size yet increases neuronal excitability,
  while DA transmission to NAc is decreased. The net effect of morphine is a less
  responsive reward pathway, i.e., reward tolerance. Downregulation of IRS2-AKT signaling
  in VTA mediates the effects of chronic morphine on soma size and electrical excitability;
  the effect on excitability is mediated via decreased GABAA currents and suppression
  of K+ channel expression. Morphine-induced downregulation of mTORC2 activity in
  VTA is crucial for these morphine-induced morphological and physiological adaptations
  as well as for reward tolerance. In contrast to mTORC2, chronic morphine increases
  mTORC1 activity, which does not influence these morphine-induced adaptations.
