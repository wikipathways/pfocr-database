caption: 'The formation of the Bu metabolites is depicted above. Bu is extensively
  metabolized in the liver with about 2% of unchanged drug excreted in the urine.
  Initial metabolism occurs primarily via conjugation with endogenous GSH (both spontaneously
  and by GST catalysis), and to a minor extent hydrolysis. Further metabolism of the
  Bu-GSH conjugate occurs via the mercapturic acid pathway or dissociation to THT
  and EdAG. THT is further metabolized by a sequence of oxidation steps, whereas EdAG
  binds with GSH to form GSG. The enzymes responsible for oxidative transformations
  are lesser understood.Bu: Busulfan; CTH: Cystathionine gamma-lyase; DPEP: Dipeptidase;
  EdAG: γ-glutamyldehydroalanylglycine; GGT: Gamma-glutamyl transferase; GSG: EdAG
  glutathione conjugate; FMO: Flavin-containing monooxygenase; GSH: Glutathione; GST:
  Glutathione S-transferase; MSA: Methane sulfonic acid; THF: Tetrahydrofuran; THT:
  Tetrahydrothiophene; THT-A: Cysteine S-conjugate of Busulfan.'
