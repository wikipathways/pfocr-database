caption: 'The mammalian autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). Under glucose starvation,
  AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) promotes autophagy by directly activating uncoordinated
  51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and transcription factor EB (TFEB) translocates to the nucleus
  to induce the transcription of several lysosomal genes. Under nutrient sufficiency,
  high mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity prevents ULK1 activation and
  phosphorylates TFEB that remains in the cytoplasm. The ULK1 activation leads to
  the formation of ULK1-ATG13-FIP200-ATG101 complex, which in turn triggers the class
  III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex formation. Both complexes participate
  in the formation of the endoplasmic reticulum cradle, from which the IM (isolation
  membrane) grows. Two ubiquitin-like conjugating systems are responsible for autophagosome
  formation: the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 system and the microtubule-associated protein
  1 light chain 3 (LC3) system, while ATG9 transmembrane protein collaborates in the
  delivery of lipids, and in the elongation and closure of the autophagosome. The
  ATG complex is recruited to the pre-autophagosomal membrane by Eva1a/TMEM166. Cargo
  recruitment is achieved thanks to a variety of receptor proteins for ubiquitinated
  proteins such as p62/SQSTM1, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and NBR1. Finally, the
  proteins LAMPs, RAB7 and HDAC6 regulate autophagosome fusion with lysosomes, and
  the lysosomal acidic hydrolases are responsible for degrading the autophagy cargo.
  Autophagy proteins whose function has been analyzed in relation to adult neurogenesis
  are highlighted in red (see also Table ). β-catenin and Notch1 (signaling pathway
  components) are degraded through autophagy during embryonic neurogenesis and are
  shown in green. This figure was produced using images from Servier Medical Art,
