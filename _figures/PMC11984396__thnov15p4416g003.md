caption: 'Diagram of cellular immunity mediated by splenic immunocytes. (A) Intracellular
  antigen presentation occurs via two primary routes: (i) MHC-I pathway: Intracellular
  antigens are hydrolyzed into peptides by proteasomes in the cytoplasm, then transported
  into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen via transporters associated with antigen
  presentation (TAP). There, peptides are loaded onto MHC-I molecules, and the resulting
  peptide-MHC-I complexes are transported through the Golgi apparatus to the antigen-presenting
  cell (APC) membrane. This process activates CD8+ T cells, which, under the influence
  of cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-10, differentiate into cytotoxic T cells, initiating
  cellular immunity. (ii) MHC-II pathway: MHC-II molecules are synthesized in the
  ER and form a complex with the invariant (Ii) chain, which prevents premature peptide
  binding. This Ii-MHC-II heterotrimer is transported through the Golgi apparatus
  to the MHC-II compartment or APC membrane. Endocytosed antigens and Ii-MHC-II are
  degraded by proteases in the endosome. The class II-associated invariant chain peptide
  (CLIP), initially occupying the peptide-binding groove of MHC-II, is replaced by
  a longer antigenic peptide with the aid of HLA-DM. Peptide-MHC-II complexes are
  then transported to the APC membrane to activate CD4+ T cells, which differentiate
  into T helper (Th), regulatory T (Treg), or follicular helper T (Tfh) cells. (B)
  Naive lymphocytes reside in the WP, particularly in subregions such as TCZs, BCZs,
  and BCs. (C) Endogenous or exogenous antigens in the blood enter the MZ or surrounding
  RP via terminal arterioles. These antigens are captured and phagocytized by migratory
  DC (mDC) or Mφ, which process them into APCs. APCs then transport antigens to TCZs
  to activate CD8+ T cells (cellular immunity). Simultaneously, MZBs capture antigens
  and generate GCs in the BCZs, initiating humoral immunity. (D) Cytotoxic T cells
