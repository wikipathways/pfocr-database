caption: Interplay between NS1, inflammasome activation, complement activation, autoreactive
  antibodies and cytokine storm in endothelial dysfunction. 1) DENV and NS1 can directly
  activate CS, the excessive conversion of C3, C4 and C5 to their active forms C3b,
  C4b and C5b will inevitably cause increased level of C3a, C4a and C5a (anaphylatoxin).
  Large amount of anaphylatoxin will cause aberrant activation of mast cells and release
  massive amount of histamine, along with other pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading
  to increase of the vascular permeability and vascular leakage. 2) anti-NS1-specific
  IgM and IgG have been found circulating in the blood stream forming immune complexes
  with the both forms of NS1 proteins. While mNS1 is expressed on DENV infected cells,
  the circulating sNS1 can subsequently bind to surface of infected or uninfected
  cells via heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate E (). These antibodies will then
  bind to NS1 and leading complement-dependent lysis of cell and antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity, damaging the endothelial layer and leading to vascular leakage
  (). 3) Secretion of IL-1β, IL-18 and HMGB1 results from NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
  4) In the circulation, IL-1β and IL-18 binds to their cognate receptors (IL-1R1/acP
  and IL-18Rα/β) expressed on the surface of endothelial cells to activate intracellular
  signaling molecules, involving MyD88, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1/4 (IRAK1/4),
  and TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF), which entails in NF-κB activation. NS1
  can also activate the NF-κB signaling pathway via TLR4. The activation of NF-κB
  signaling pathway increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  to mediate leukocyte adhesion and extravasation (diapedesis). Additionally, the
  binding of HMGB1 to the RAGE receptor leads to the downstream activation of p38
  MAP kinase, resulting in phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein Hsp27 and
  caldesmon, which causes actin stress fibers to form, cytoskeletal remodeling, and
  endothelial contraction. All these reactions increase endothelial permeability by
  altering cell contractility and disruption of intercellular junctions. Given the
  ability of IL-18 to induce the production of various pro-inflammatory mediators
  including TLR4 and RAGE via activation of NFκ-B signaling (, , ), their higher expression
  will condition the endothelial cells to be more responsive to stimulation by NS1
  and HMGB1, to further magnify inflammation and vascular permeability.
