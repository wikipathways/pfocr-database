caption: Proposed pathways for  biosynthesis catalyzed by PGA1 and PGA2. Compounds
  that accumulated in the PGA1-knockdown plants (red circles) and the PGA2-knockdown
  plants (light blue circles) are shown. Solid arrows are indicated as metabolite
  flows of PGA1 (red) and PGA2 (light blue). Dashed and gray arrows are putative.
  OH-CHR, hydroxycholesterol.
