  differential metabolites, and then use Adobe Illustrator 2021 V25.3.1.390 mapping
  software to obtain pathway maps. The white box in the diagram represents an undetected
  metabolite. The pink box represents significant enrichment of metabolites. The green
  box represents a significant reduction in metabolites. The yellow box represents
  the metabolic pathway
