caption: Overview of ferroptosis. The SLC7A11-GSH-GPX4 pathway and GPX4-independent
  pathways (such as AIFM2, GCH, DHODH, and MGST1) inhibit lipid peroxidation, whereas
  ACSL4, ALOX, and POR promote peroxidation of PUFA-containing phospholipids (PUFA-PL).
  Cystine is transported into cells by SLC7A11 and rapidly reduced to cysteine, which
  is utilized for GSH synthesis. GPX4 inhibits lipid peroxidation, the primary driver
  of ferroptosis, by converting GSH to GSSG. The transcription factor NFE2L2 serves
  as a key antioxidant system by upregulating genes involved in both GPX4-dependent
  and GPX4-independent pathways. Lipid peroxidation generates 4HNE, which can induce
  membrane damage and release DAMPs. Conversely, the endosomal sorting complex required
  for transport (ESCRT-III) machinery acts as a protective mechanism that delays membrane
  damage. TFRC increases intracellular iron levels, thereby promoting lipid peroxidation
  and ferroptosis
