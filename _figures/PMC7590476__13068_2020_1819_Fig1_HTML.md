caption: 'Integrated model of monolignol biosynthesis pathway and the underlying regulatory
  mechanism in Miscanthus × giganteus. a The proposed monolignol biosynthesis pathway
  in M. × giganteus. The enzymes beside the arrows are the major monolignol biosynthetic
  enzymes identified in this study. The gray arrows indicate the enzymatic reactions
  are not supported (CSE) or not the main route (from phenylalanine to p-coumaric
  acid). The dashed arrow means the reaction is not yet clear in M. × giganteus (C3H).
  b The transcription factors (TFs) that are predicted to participate in the monolignol
  biosynthesis in M. × giganteus. The lines with arrows and bars at the ends represent
  promoting and suppressing the expression of monolignol biosynthetic genes, respectively.
  The MYBs, WRKYs, and ERFs are likely to directly regulate the expression of monolignol
  biosynthetic genes, while the secondary wall NACs (SWNs) are supposed to function
  indirectly. For each family, the top three TFs are shown in the figure, and the
  rest are listed in Additional file : Table S9'
