caption: 'Galactose metabolism and proposed pathophysiology. Galactose is converted
  to glucose‐1‐phosphate (Glc‐1‐P) through the action of three sequential enzymes:
  Galactokinase (GALK1), galactose‐1‐phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT), and UDP‐galactose
  4′‐epimerase (GALE). Alternatively, galactose can be reduced to galactitol by aldose
  reductase, oxidized to galactonate, presumably by galactose dehydrogenase, or be
  converted into UDP‐Glc, via the pyrophosphorylase pathway, through the sequential
  activities of GALK1, UDP‐glucose/galactose pyrophosphorylase (UGP), and GALE. The
  pathophysiology of classic galactosemia (CG) involves a complex interplay of multiple
  factors. The accumulation of toxic metabolites, aberrant glycosylation, myo‐inositol
  deficiency, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress, and signaling
  pathway alterations plays a central role in the pathophysiology of CG. Elevated
  Gal‐1‐P levels can suppress IMPase1 activity, which is responsible for converting
  L‐myo‐inositol‐1‐phosphate to free myo‐inositol, thus reducing intracellular myo‐inositol
  concentrations. The buildup of galactitol creates osmotic stress, potentially leading
  to decreased SMIT1 transcription, a myo‐inositol cotransporter, further exacerbating
  the intracellular myo‐inositol shortage. This deficiency in myo‐inositol and subsequent
  changes in inositide signaling can disrupt calcium homeostasis and induce ER stress,
  which is linked to apoptosis and reduced PI3K/Akt signaling. Additionally, Gal‐1‐P
  and abnormal glycosylation may contribute to ER stress'
