caption: Overactivation of monocyte-derived macrophages and hyperactivity of inflammation
  in COVID-19. Several mechanisms can cause the overactivation of macrophages seen
  in patients with COVID-19. A delayed response by type I interferons leads to enhanced
  cytopathic effects of microbial threats and promotes the enhanced release of monocyte
  chemokines by alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in the recruitment of blood monocytes
  in the lungs. Monocytes differentiate into TH17-like proinflammatory macrophages
  through the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways. Proinflammatory cytokines, including granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and interferon-γ
  (IFNγ), further promote the recruitment and activation of monocyte-derived macrophages.
  Oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) accumulate in infected lung epithelial cells and
  activate monocyte-derived macrophages through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–TRAF6–NFκB
  pathway. IgG1 is the host antiviral neutralizing antibody, and RNA viruses usually
  mislead the infected host to produce non-neutralizing IgG3 antibodies. The binding
  virus and the IgG3 antibody can be taken up by the Fcγ receptor (CD64 or CD32) of
  macrophages. This process is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This enables
  the virus to gain access in order to infect macrophages and to activate the NLRP3
  inflammasome, causing the secretion of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Interleukin-1β can
  enhance the activation of macrophages in an autocrine or paracrine manner, and it
  also reduces type I interferon production. Activated monocyte-derived macrophages
  contribute to the COVID-19 cytokine storm by releasing numerous proinflammatory
  cytokines. CCL, CC-chemokine ligand; CXCL10, CXC-chemokine ligand 10; ISG, interferon-stimulated
  gene; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; TRAM, TRIF-related adaptor
  molecule.
