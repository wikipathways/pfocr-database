caption: Overview of canonical and alternative Wnt signaling pathways. Canonical Wnt
  signaling is defined by the activation of β-catenin-dependent transcription [via
  T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor(TCF/LEF)] downstream of Wnt receptors. In
  the absence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin is held in the destruction complex of proteins
  that includes Axin, APC, Ser/Thr kinases CK1 and GSK3, and E3-ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP.
  Sequential phosphorylation (by CK1 and GSK3) and ubiquitination (by β-TrCP) of β-catenin
  promotes its proteosomal degradation. Binding of Wnt ligands (classically Wnt3a)
  to frizzled (FZD) and LRP5/6 receptors leads to recruitment of the destruction complex
  to the membrane via Dvl and Axin, which blocks β-catenin ubiquitination by β-TrCP.
  The destruction complex then becomes saturated with β-catenin, allowing newly synthesized
  β-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus where it
  associates with TCF/LEF transcription factors to regulate gene expression. Rspo
  (R-spondin) proteins can enhance Wnt signaling by binding LGR4/5/6 receptors to
  antagonize the RNF43/ZNRF3 transmembrane E3 ligases that remove Wnt receptors from
  the cell surface. The alternative Wnt-YAP/TAZ pathway (as defined by Park et al.,
  ). Wnt5a/b and Wnt3a ligands induce the activation of YAP/TAZ via FZD and ROR1/2
  co-receptors, independently of LRP5/6 and β-catenin. Activation of FZD-ROR1/2 couples
  to Gα12/13 G-protein subunits, leading to activation of RhoA and subsequent inhibition
  of LATS1/2 kinases (major YAP/TAZ Ser/Thr kinases). Inhibition of LATS1/2 leads
  to YAP/TAZ dephosphorylation, stabilization and translocation to the nucleus where
  their interaction with TEAD transcription factors promotes gene regulation. Wnt-YAP/TAZ
  target genes such as DKK1 lead to the inhibition of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
  Wnt/Ca2+signaling. Activation of FZD stimulates the activity of phospholipase C
  (PLC) via Dvl and G proteins, leading to increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels.
  Ca2+ activates calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), protein kinase C
  (PKC) and the transcription factors NFAT and ATF2. Activation of PKC by Ca2+ can
  cause actin cytoskeleton rearrangements via Cdc42 activity. Wnt/PCP (planar cell
  polarity) signaling. Wnt signaling via FZD with co-receptors ROR1/2 or RYK may activate
  G proteins and Dvl to stimulate RhoA (via Dvl-Daam) and ROCK activity, leading to
  rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Activation of G proteins can also stimulate
  Rac1, leading to JNK-mediated phosphorylation of c-JUN and transcriptional activity
  via AP-1.

    Wnt signaling is defined by the activation of β-catenin-dependent transcription
