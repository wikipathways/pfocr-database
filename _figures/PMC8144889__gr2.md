caption: Proposed integrated model of NCC regulation. The Na+–Cl− co-transporter (NCC)
  is the principal salt absorptive pathway in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT).
  The NCC is activated by kinase-induced phosphorylation (P) via the with-no-lysine
  [K] (WNK) and its downstream target kinases, SPS/Ste20-related proline–alanine-rich
  kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress responsive (OSR) and deactivated by phosphatase-induced
  dephosphorylation via protein phosphatase 1-3-4 (PP1-3-4). Activation of SPAK is
  enhanced via attachment of the mouse protein-25 (MO25). The expression of NCC is
  directly regulated via ubiquitination and subsequent endocytosis of NCC via the
  RAS guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP) and its downstream target extracellular
  signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1/2 and NEDD4-2 or indirectly via ubiquitination
  and suppression of WNK by the cullin3 (CUL3)/kelch-like-3 (KLHL3) ubiquitin ligase
  complex. ERK1/2 is inhibited by DUSP6 and the phosphatases are inhibited by an endogenous
  inhibitor 1 (I1). Further studies are required to evaluate the NCC regulatory effects
  of parvalbumin (PV) via modulations of the ATP-induced Ca2+signaling. The modulators
  of these regulatory events include parathyroid hormone (PTH), aldosterone, purine
  receptors and cAMP elevating hormones.
