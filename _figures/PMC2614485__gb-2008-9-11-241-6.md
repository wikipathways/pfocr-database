caption: 'A simplified Hh signaling pathway, constructed from combined Drosophila
  and mammalian data. Hh is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum by its signal peptide,
  is palmitoylated at its amino terminus by Rasp/Skinny Hedgehog (Ski), and autoprocessed.
  Lipidated HhN (M-HhN) is released by Dispatched (Disp) and forms multimers or associates
  with lipoproteins (LP) in the extracellular environment []. A number of molecules
  can interact with M-HhN and propagate or modulate its trafficking: the Dally-like
  protein (Dlp), which is modified by the heparan sulfate (HS) polymerases Tout-velu
  (Ttv), Sister of tout-velu (Sotv), and Brother of tout-velu (Botv), all members
  of the EXT family; the Hedgehog-interacting protein (Hip); and the Growth-arrest-specific
  1 (Gas1) protein. Hip and Gas1 are not present in Drosophila. Megalin (Meg) is most
  probably involved in the recycling of M-HhN. Ihog is thought to function as co-receptor
  for M-HhN. M-HhN acts as an antagonistic ligand that represses the function of the
  receptor Patched (Ptc), a 12-transmembrane protein related to Disp. Binding of M-HhN
  to Ptc results in internalization. Smoothened (Smo) is a seven-pass membrane receptor,
  which is key for the transmission of the signal to the nucleus in the Hh pathway.
  Smo is inhibited by Ptc when not bound by M-HhN. When the inhibitory function of
  Ptc is released by M-HhN, Smo can translocate to the plasma membrane or - in mammals
  - to the primary cilium, and active Smo is phosphorylated (red P). Ptc may secrete
  pro-vitamin D3 or related compounds (D3) to inhibit Smo. Conversely, oxysterols
  (Oxy) can indirectly activate Smo [,]. The Hh pathway downstream of Smo displays
  some important differences between Drosophila and mammals. In Drosophila, when Smo
  is active, the signal passes through a complex comprising the kinesin-like molecule
  Costal 2 (Cos2), Fused (Fu), Suppressor of fused (Su(fu)) and Cubitus interruptus
  (Ci), leading to the release of Ci, which can then enter the nucleus to activate
  transcription. When Smo is inhibited, the Cos2/Fu/Su(fu)/Ci complex remains associated
  with microtubules, Ci is phosphorylated and is cleaved by Cos2. The Ci fragment
  now acts as a transcriptional repressor. In mammals, the targeting of Smo to primary
  cilia is essential for signal transduction. No obvious equivalents of Cos2 and Fu
  exist in mammals. Instead, Su(fu) has a more prominent role in inhibiting the pathway.
  Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 are the mammalian homologs of Ci; Gli1 and Gli2 activate transcription
  when Smo is active, whereas Gli3 is processed and becomes a repressor when Smo is
  inhibited. A number of components in the pathway, in particular downstream of Smo,
  are not shown in this figure.'
