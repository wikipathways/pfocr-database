caption: Schematic of Ca2+signaling pathway activated by alkaline stimuli to dentin
  surface and PLC-coupled receptor activation in odontoblasts. Odontoblasts express
  PLC-coupled P2Y and muscarinic-cholinergic receptors. P2Y receptors are activated
  by endogenous ATP/ADP released from odontoblasts in the dental pulp in response
  to cellular deformation or cellular damage following dentin stimuli. Muscarinic-cholinergic
  receptors are activated by agonist released from intradental parasympathetic neurons.
  Activation of these receptors induces depletion of Ca2+ stores by intracellular
  Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores via ryanodine and/or IP3 receptors,
  resulting in increased [Ca2+]i. Ca2+ store depletion then activates store-operated
  Ca2+ entry (SOCE) via CRAC channels in odontoblasts. Direct alkaline stimuli via
  dentinal tubules to odontoblasts modulate CRAC channel activation and enhance Ca2+
  influx via CRAC channels. The alkaline stimuli also activate TRPA1 channels in odontoblasts
  and evoke Ca2+ influx via TRPA1 channels. Additionally, alkaline stimuli activate
  alkali sensitive-metabotropic receptors, inducing Ca2+ release from intracellular
  Ca2+ stores via ryanodine and/or IP3 receptors. This Ca2+ release may, in turn,
  induce store depletion and SOCE via CRAC channels in odontoblasts. These high-pH-sensitive
  Ca2+signaling pathways may play important roles in tertiary dentin formation by
  odontoblasts, following application of alkali stimuli, such as high-pH dental materials,
  on the dentin surface.
