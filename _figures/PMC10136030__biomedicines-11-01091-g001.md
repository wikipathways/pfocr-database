caption: 'Structure and functions of telomeres. Telomeres are protective structures
  on the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. The terminal DNA represented by oligonucleotide
  repeats and forms a secondary structure of T- and D-loops in a complex with shelterin
  proteins TRF1, TRF2, Rap1, TIN2, TPP1 and POT1. Telomeres prevent the induction
  of DNA damage response through an activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
  and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) signaling pathways that play a
  principal role in the maintenance of genome integrity. Since telomeric DNA shortens
  in every replication cycle, because of the inability of DNA polymerase to synthesize
  the lagging DNA strand from 5′-end, telomere elongation is performed by a special
  enzyme called telomerase. Structurally, telomerase appears to be a complex ribonucleoprotein,
  the core part of which consists of two parts: telomerase RNA component (TERC) and
  telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). Telomerase complex adds multiple oligonucleotide
  sequences (5′-TTAGGGn) to chromosome ends by reverse transcription of TERC template.
  Thus, telomerase activity facilitates evasion of cells from death mediated by critical
  telomere shortage during robust proliferation. The up arrow (red) means an increase.'
