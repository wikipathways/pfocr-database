caption: 'Metabolic pathways involved in the production of plant growth hormones (IAA,
  diacetyl, acetoin, and 2,3-butanediol) found on the genomes of selected endophytic
  bacteria. The metabolic pathways were constructed using PRIAM predictions mapped
  on the KEGG database (http://www.genome.ad.jp). For each organism, differently colored
  arrows are used to indicate the presence of the putative pathways: S. maltophilia
  R551-3 (red), P. putida W619 (green), B. vietnamiensis G4 (orange), Enterobacter
  sp. strain 638 (dark blue), and S. proteamaculans 568 (light blue). Black arrows
  indicate known pathway steps that could not be identified. Dashed arrows correspond
  to the presence of putative enzymes (PRIAM E value below 10−30). In the tryptophan-dependent
  IAA synthesis, the enzymes involved are tryptophan transaminase Lao1 (1), indolepyruvate
  decarboxylase IpdC (2), indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase DhaS (3), tryptophan
  decarboxylase Dcd1 (4), amine oxidase (5), tryptophan 2-monooxygenase IaaM (6),
  deaminase IaaH (7), nitrile hydratase (8), nitrilase YhcX (9), and indole-3-acetaldehyde
  reductase AdhC (10). Besides the production of IAA, the main pathway for tryptophan
  metabolism is via tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase KynA (11). In butanoate metabolism,
  the production of acetoin from pyruvate is catalyzed by the acetolactate synthase
  AlsS (12) and the acetolactate decarboxylase AlsD (13). The genome of Enterobacter
  sp. strain 638 encodes the acetoin dehydrogenase ButA (14) that is able to catalyze
  the conversion of acetoin into diacetyl. It is unknown if this compound has plant
  growth stimulatory effects. The 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase ButB (15) involved
  in the conversion of acetoin into 2,3-butanediol was not found encoded on the genomes
  of the endophytic bacteria but is present on the poplar genome.'
