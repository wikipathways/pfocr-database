caption: 'Core metabolic pathways for T cell survival, activation, differentiation,
  and function. Glucose is metabolized to pyruvate through the glycolysis pathway,
  a process controlled by many positive and negative factors. Pyruvate is converted
  to lactate and exported from the cell or transported into the mitochondria to feed
  into the TCA cycle. The TCA cycle reduces NAD+ to NADH, which is in turn oxidized
  by complexes of the electron transport chain. The transferred electrons are used
  to generate a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Complex V
  uses the proton-motive force of this gradient to generate ATP in a process called
  OXPHOS. Glycolysis nets 2 ATP, whereas OXPHOS can yield up to 36 ATP per molecule
  of glucose. Other substrates, such as fatty acids, can also feed into the TCA cycle.
  Cpt1a regulates the entrance of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where
  they are cleaved to generate acetyl-CoA. Abbreviations: AMPK, adenosine monophosphate–activated
  protein kinase; Bcl-6, B cell CLL/lymphoma 6; Hif-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1
  alpha; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; PD-1, programmed cell
  death protein 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; OXPHOS,
  oxidative phosphorylation; SRC, spare respiratory capacity.'
