caption: Neurospora silencing pathways. The stages of the life cycle of Neurospora
  are presented, indicating points where the various gene silencing pathways are active.
  Quelling is a post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) pathway that is active
  in the vegetative phase of the life cycle, from germination of ascospores or conidia
  to formation of the mycelium and differentiation of conidiophores and conidia. RIP
  and meiotic silencing are silencing pathways that are specific to the sexual cycle
  but differ in their molecular mechanisms. RIP scans for the presence of duplicated
  copies of DNA fragments present in the genomes destined to participate in meiosis.
  Duplicated regions are inundated with a series of transition mutations, and most
  of the remaining nonmutated cytosine bases are methylated. This process occurs in
  the heterokaryotic ascogeneous tissue formed following fertilization but prior to
  karyogamy. Meiotic silencing, like quelling, is a PTGS-like mechanism that is activated
  when a discrete region of DNA fails to sense (i.e., trans-sense) an equivalent region
  in the opposite chromosome. This failure of trans-sensing in turn triggers the silencing
  of all genes contained in the loop of unpaired DNA.
