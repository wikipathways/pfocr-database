caption: Proposed hepatoprotective signaling mechanisms mediated by MaR1 in liver
  I/R injury. MaR1 confers protection against I/R-induced liver damage through interacting
  with ALXR, thus resulting in enhancing downstream p-Akt protein expression. MaR1
  also exerts its protective role during hepatic I/R injury by increasing antioxidant
  enzyme activity (GPX), inhibiting the activation of ERK and suppressing inflammatory
  responses, and finally contributes to decreased apoptotic cell death
papertitle: Maresin 1 protects the liver against ischemia/reperfusion injury via the
  ALXR/Akt signaling pathway.
