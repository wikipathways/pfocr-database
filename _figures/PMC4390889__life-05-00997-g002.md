caption: 'Outline of H2-related metabolic routes in heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria.
  Vegetative cells synthesize saccharides (CH2O) by ordinary photosynthesis with accompanying
  evolution of O2 and uptake of CO2. Heterocysts receive the saccharides, and use
  them (accompanied by CO2 evolution) as the sources of e− for N2ase reaction. For
  efficient net production of H2, H2ase(s) (uptake H2ase Hup and bidirectional H2ase
  Hox) have been inactivated. C6P: hexose phosphate, Fdox and Fdred: ferredoxin oxidized
  and reduced respectively, OPPP: oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, PSI and PSII:
  photosystem I and II, respectively (adapted from [] with modification).'
