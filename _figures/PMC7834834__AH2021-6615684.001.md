caption: 'Figure modified from []. Overview of cellular and tissue mechanisms of metformin
  on inhibiting plasm cell growth. Metformin inhibits at tissue level: the inflammation
  caused by increases in circulating levels of leptin, insulin, IGF, IL-6, IL-1, and
  VGFR, driving by adipocyte differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells
  (AD-MSCs); and a cellular level inhibits mitochondria complex I, stimulates the
  adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, and/or
  inhibits the insulin signaling pathway. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition; IGF, insulin growth factor; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IGF-1R,
  insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor; IR, insulin receptor; IL-1, interleukin 1;
  IL-6, interleukin-6, OCT1, organic cation transporter 1; VGFR, endothelial growth
  factor.'
