caption: A discovery process that derives molecular markers for the bioactivity of
  defined foods through a human intervention trial, and the use of pathway models
  (bottom-up) should be followed by an animal model study to verify the markers in
  vivo. Similarly, the biomarker signature identification of specific nutrients using
  nutri-omics technology in yeast (top-down) will eventually be tested by an intervention
  study in an animal model. The output of this process, which might well be iterative,
  is new knowledge obtained for the biological system, as well as the potential for
  predictive understanding of that system; in the nutritional arena this would lead
  to personalized nutrition.

  description: A discovery process that derives molecular markers for the bioactivity
    of defined foods through a human intervention trial, and the use of pathway models
    (bottom-up) should be followed by an animal model study to verify the markers
    in vivo. Similarly, the biomarker signature identification of specific nutrients
    using nutri-omics technology in yeast (top-down) will eventually be tested by
    an intervention study in an animal model. The output of this process, which might
