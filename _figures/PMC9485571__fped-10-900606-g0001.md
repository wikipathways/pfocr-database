caption: IKBKG/NF-κB pathophysiology in incontinentia pigmenti. The IKBKG gene is
  required for activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
  Under non-stimulated conditions, NF-κB remained inactive in the cytoplasm through
  association with NEMO/IKKgamma (encoded by IKBKG). Phosphorylation of inhibitor
  NF-κB (IκB) proteins by the IKK complex results in their proteosomal degradation
  and subsequent release of NF-κB dimer (composed of p50 and relA subunits). Most
  affected individuals with IP carry a common pathogenic variant on the IKBKG gene
  with exon 4–10 deletion which caused inactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  IKBKG-deficient keratinocytes are susceptible to apoptosis/necrosis due to the loss
  of protection against cell death. DAMPS and ‘find me' signals (ATP/UTP, S1P, LPC,
  TGFβ) are released and serve as activating signals which stimulate immune-inflammatory
  responses. Monocytes, macrophages, T cells, and NK cells have been shown to release
  cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, Lymphotactin) and chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1α,
  MIP-1β, MIP-2, MCP-1, Eotaxin), leading to the recruitment of eosinophils. Recruited
  eosinophils undergo degranulation to release proteases that aid in degrading adhesions
  between keratinocytes. This results in spongiosis and blister formation which can
  be observed frequently in the first stage of clinical manifestation in IP patients.
  Besides the major presentation of skin conditions, IP patients have often reported
  manifesting CNS and ocular abnormalities. NF-κB-deficient endothelial cells and
  other cells throughout the body have overexpression of chemotactic factors, leading
  to eosinophilia, which triggers extensive inflammation. Endothelial inflammation
  will result in vaso-occlusion and ischemia, contributing to the retinal and neurologic
  manifestation.
