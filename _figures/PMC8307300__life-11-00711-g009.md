caption: 'Pathways of glyoxylate, propionyl-CoA and PA/PEP conversion into TCA cycle
  components. I. Pathways of glyoxylate conversion: the conversion into malate by
  two malate synthases differing in stability and activators. (EC: 2.3.3.9)—reaction
  1; malyl-CoA/(S)-citramalyl-CoA-lyase (EC: 4.1.3.24/4.1.3.25) and (3S)-malyl-CoA-thioesterase.
  (EC: 3.1.2.30)—reactions 2–3; pathways of glyoxylate conversion through the part
  of glycerate pathway (reactions 32–35 simultaneously with pathways of PA/PEP conversion
  into TCA cycle intermediates); pathways of glyoxylate conversion through the β-hydroxyaspartate
  cycle (reactions 28–31,28). II. Pathways of propionyl-CoA conversion into succinyl-CoA
  or PA: the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway (reactions 4–6); the methylcitrate pathway
  (reactions 11, 12 (or 12a–12b), 13, 14); and the pathway of propionyl-CoA oxidation
  to PA via lactate (reactions 7–10). III. Pathways of PA/PEP conversion into TCA
  cycle intermediates: PA/PEP carboxylating enzymes (reactions 19, 19a, 20–22); the
  pathway of fumarate (reactions 23–25) or (S)-malate (reactions 23, 26) formation
  from PA; cis-aconitate formation from PA and acetyl-CoA (reactions 15–17, 18 (or
  17a, 18a, 18b)). The scheme is based on the KEGG Pathway database and pertinent
  literature analyzed. The functional numbers of enzymes and the description of each
  function according to KEGG Orthology are presented in the tables under the same
  number as the catalyzed reaction illustrated in this figure.'
