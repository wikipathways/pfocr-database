caption: The canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In this pathway, the WNT ligand binds
  to a receptor complex (a frizzled receptor associated to a LRP co-receptor) on the
  surface of the cell, activating a series of downstream signaling events by disrupting
  the tertiary complex formed by Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), CK1α, and
  GSK-3β, that ultimately result in the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus.
  Once in the nucleus, β-catenin interacts with transcription factors (TCF-Lef transcriptional
  complexes) to promote the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation,
  and survival. However, in the absence of WNT signaling, β-catenin is rapidly degraded
  by the activated tertiary complex formed by GSK-3β, APC, and Axin. Thus, the balance
  between active WNT signaling and β-catenin degradation is critical for proper cell
  function and homeostasis.
