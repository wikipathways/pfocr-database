caption: The figure depicts the pathways activated by 12-LOX in the pancreatic islet
  beta cell in response to elevated glucose levels, saturated free fatty acids, or
  PIC. 12-LOX activation leads to the production of pro-inflammatory lipid intermediates
  (12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 12(S)-HETE). These intermediates trigger
  subsequent inflammatory pathways mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38-MAPK,
  and NOX. 12(S)-HETE prevents translocation of Nrf2 as well. Signaling through these
  pathways leads to increased ROS, oxidative stress, ER stress, which eventually cause
  beta cell dysfunction and death. Although not depicted in this diagram, other lipid
  mediators such as LPA and LPC contribute to MCP-1 mediated chemotaxy; ceramides
  contribute to beta-cell death, etc. FFAR, free fatty acid receptor; PLA, phospholipase
  A2; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; MCP1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1.
