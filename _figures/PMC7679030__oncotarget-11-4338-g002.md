caption: Ligand binding to an EGFR/HER2 heterodimer causes the activation of signalling
  pathways via the phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain of the intracellular
  HER2 molecule. The HER2 homodimer is constitutively activated. The RAS/MAPK and
  PI3K/Akt pathways are activated which culminates in the activation of important
  downstream effectors and transcription factors (TF). Ultimately this signalling
  can alter transcription and modulate gene expression, impacting upon many important
  cellular functions. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition is denoted as EMT. PTEN
  is an important inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Arrows indicate signalling.
