caption: Schematic representation of the molecular mechanisms controlling lymphatic
  specification and sprouting. PROX1 is a key transcription factor that drives lymphatic
  cell fate specification. Lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells expressing PROX1
  arise from the cardinal veins (CV) and intersomitic veins. After specification,
  LECs migrate out from the CV in a VEGF-C/VEGFR3 dependent manner and form lymph
  sac. Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling regulates PROX1 expression during LEC specification
  and sprouting.
