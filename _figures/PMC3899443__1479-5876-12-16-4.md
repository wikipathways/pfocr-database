caption: Interactions between ER-α36 and EGFR in mitogenic signaling. After treatment
  with estrogen, ER-α36 is dissociated from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  and is associated with Src and Shc. Furthermore, E2 induces auto-phosphorylation
  of Src and Src-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR. EGFR activates signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 5(STAT5), which leads to transcription of target
  genes such as Cyclin D1. On the other hand, ER-α36 and EGFR complex mediated non-genomic
  signaling like MAPK/ERK pathway is also involved in the signaling pathway contributing
  to cell proliferation.
