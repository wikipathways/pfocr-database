caption: Control of ATM function by Pdk1-Foxo1 pathway. Pdk1 is regulated by not only
  insulin but also cytokines, including IL-4, which is secreted from CD4+ T cells
  or regulatory T cells. Furthermore, Foxo1 is regulated by not only Pdk1 but also
  oxidative stress through JNK and MST1. Phosphorylation of Pdk1 gradually declined
  during the HFD, but oxidative stress suddenly increased at the prolonged HFD, which
  is consistent with the time for the increased nuclear accumulation of Foxo1 in ATMs.
  Foxo1 directly regulates the expression of Ccr2, which upregulates the recruitment
  of macrophages in adipose tissue. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
