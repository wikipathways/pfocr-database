caption: Signaling pathways required for transformation by v-Src. v-Src activates
  both the Ras-MAPK pathway, which can be inhibited by coexpression of N17Ras or by
  PD98059, and, in parallel, the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, which can be inhibited by
  LY294002 or rapamycin. Inhibition of both pathways is required to block transformation.
  Our data do not exclude the possibility that Src, Ras, and PI3K activate other pathways
  that are also necessary for transformation.
