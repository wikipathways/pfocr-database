caption: (A) Results with siRNAs that target RRAS pathway proteins. Values are means
  and standard deviations observed in the primary screen and in the retest (caspase
  activity values are expressed as percent of non-targeting siRNA control). ND = not
  determined. Colored circles refer to Panel B. Additional results with relevant siRNAs
  are presented in . (B) Diagram showing the relationships of proteins that when inhibited
  in HEK293T cells (red) or STHdh Q111/Q111 cells (blue) by siRNA, or in Drosophila
  by RNAi or loss-of-function (LOF) alleles (olive; see  and ) suppress mutant Htt
  toxicity. Gray lines indicate relationships from published observations that may
  not play a role in these HD cell models. References for the pathway interconnections
  are presented within the text and in . (C) Modifier effects of loss-of-function
  in Ras pathway components on motor impairment in Drosophila expressing mutant Htt.
  S = suppressor. Colored circles refer to Panel B.
