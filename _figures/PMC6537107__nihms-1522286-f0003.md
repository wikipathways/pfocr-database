caption: (a, b) Interaction network pathway analyses of the docosahexaenoic (DHA),
  arachidonic (AA) and eicospentaenoic (EPA) acid bioactive metabolomes in TA muscle
  after CTX (a) or eccentric exercise-induced injury (b). The networks depict both
  the relative changes of each lipid mediator at day 1 compared to day 0 (color of
  circle) and the absolute abundance of the mediators at day 1 (size of circle). Compounds
  that were not detected in the analysis are shown in black, while those that were
  not included in the analysis are shown in grey. n=3 biologically independent muscle
  samples per group per time point. (c) Quantification of selected lipid mediators
  from the AA, DHA and EPA bioactive metabolomes depicted in their biosynthetic pathways
  after EE. Data show mean ± SEM. and n=3 biologically independent animals per time
  point (d) Ratio of LTB4 to total SPM (LXA4, 15R-LXA4, LXB4, 15R-LXB4, 17R-RvD1,
  RvD2, 17R-RvD3, RvD4, RvD5, RvD6, PD1, 17R-PD1, 10S,17S-diHDHA, MaR2, RvE3) at days
  1 and 8 post eccentric exercise injury. *p<0.05 (two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test).
  Data show mean ± SEM and n=3 biologically independent muscles per time point.
