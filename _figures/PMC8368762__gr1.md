caption: 'The molecular signaling mechanisms of pyroptosis and other forms of RCD
  that mediate pathogenesis of CVDsPyroptosis can be triggered by the caspase-1-mediated
  canonical inflammasome pathway, caspase-4/5/11-mediated noncanonical inflammasome
  pathway, and caspase-3- and caspase-8-mediated alternative pathways. Apoptosis mainly
  occurs through three signal transduction pathways: death receptor pathway, mitochondrial
  pathway, and endoplasmic reticulum pathway. Necroptosis can be triggered by the
  activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) and RIP3. RIP1 binds
  and activates RIP3 to form the necrosome that then recruits and activates the mixed
  lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein to translocate to the plasma membrane.
  The mTOR kinase is a critical modulator of autophagy induction and UNC-51-like kinase-1
  (ULK1) acts downstream of the mTOR complex. AMPK can either inhibit mTOR activity
  or directly phosphorylate ULK1 to activate the class III PI3K complex (containing
  hVsp34, beclin-1, p150, and ATG-14 or UVRAG) to activate autophagy. Ferroptosis
  can be triggered indirectly by blocking glutathione synthesis, and directly by inhibiting
  glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) activity, or by intracellular iron (mostly Fe2+)
  accumulation that can effectively catalyze lipid ROS production, thereby initiating
  and propagating lipid peroxidation.'
