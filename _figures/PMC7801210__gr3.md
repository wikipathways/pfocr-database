caption: Nutrient biosynthetic pathways of A. cylindraceaThe arrows represent the
  enzymes that were identified in A. cylindracea, and each dot represents the metabolite
  that was generated by enzymatic catalysis. Different colors represent different
  metabolic pathways of nutrient substances, including carbohydrate (pink), GlcNAc
  (blue), B vitamins (green), amino acids (brown), and unsaturated fatty acids (yellow).
  Highly expressed enzyme-coding genes in fruiting bodies are represented as column
  diagrams (red columns on the left represent the gene expression level in pilei,
  green columns on the right represent the gene expression level in stipes). Enzyme
  EC numbers are provided below the respective column diagrams and P values of DEGs
  are provided above the respective column diagrams. The smaller the P value is, the
  more significant the difference in gene expression between the pilei and stipes
  of the A. cylindracea fruiting bodies. Double-headed arrows represent the expanded
  genes. DEG, differentially expressed gene; Glc, glucose; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate;
  F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphat;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; 3-PG, 3-phospho-D-glycerate; CoA, coenzyme A;
  GlcNAc-1P, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate; DHF, dihydrofolate; THF, tetrahydrofolate;
  NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADP, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; FMN, flavin mononucleotide; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; ACP, acyl
  carrier protein; TMP, thiamin monophosphate.
