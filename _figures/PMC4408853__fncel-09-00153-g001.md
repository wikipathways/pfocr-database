caption: The neuronal Ca2+signalling toolkit. Neuronal Ca2+ signals are shaped by
  the interaction between Ca2+ inflow from the outside and Ca2+ mobilization from
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), their most abundant endogenous Ca2+ pool. At excitatory
  synapses, the signaling cascade is initiated when glutamate is released into the
  synaptic cleft. Glutamate binds to receptor-operated channels, such as α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
  acid receptors (AMPARs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), and to metabotropic
  receptors, such as type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1). AMPAR gates
  Na+ entry, thereby causing the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) that removes
  the Mg2+ block from NMDAR , enabling it to open in response to Glu and to mediate
  Ca2+ inflow. Moreover, the EPSP recruits an additional pathway for Ca2+ entry by
  activating voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCCs). Outside the postsynaptic density
  is located mGluR1, that is coupled to PLCb by a trimeric Gq protein and, therefore,
  leads to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) synthesis. InsP3, in turn, induces
  Ca2+ release from ER by binding to and gating the so-called InsP3 receptors (InsP3Rs).
  ER-dependent Ca2+ discharge also involves ryanodine receptors (RyRs) which are activated
  by Ca2+ delivered either by adjoining InsP3Rs or by plasmalemmal VOCs or NMDARs
  according to the process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). An additional route
  for Ca2+ influx is provided by store-operated Ca2+ entry, which is mediated by the
  interaction between the ER Ca2+-sensors, Stim1 and Stim2, and the Ca2+-permeable
  channels, Orai1 and Orai2. As more extensively illustrated in the text, depending
  on the species (rat, mouse, or human) and on the brain region (cortex, hippocampus,
  or cerebellum), Stim and Orai isoforms interact to mediate Ca2+ entry either in
  the presence or in the absence of synaptic activity to ensure adequate replenishment
  of ER Ca2+ loading and engage in Ca2+-sensitive decoders.
