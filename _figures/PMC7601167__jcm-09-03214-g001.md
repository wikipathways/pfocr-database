caption: Graphical abstract depicting the mechanisms of inherent and acquired resistance
  to PI3K inhibition at different vertical nodes along the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
  Activating mutations and copy number amplifications in PIK3CA result in marked upregulation
  of PI3Kα signaling. Acquired resistance develops via activation of the CDK 4/6–cyclin
  D1 complex that may be blocked simultaneously to overcome this resistance. Alternatively,
  mTOR inhibition may synergize downstream with PI3Kα inhibition. Conversely, PIK3CA
  wild-type tumors are independent of PI3Kα activity, which makes them inherently
  resistant to PI3Kα inhibition. Hence, combining additional inhibition along the
  pathway may overcome this resistance and improve the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors.
