caption: Gene network highlighting the candidate genes and their interaction in potentially
  regulating the calcium-ion transport during eggshell formation derived from QIAGEN’s
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).
  (a) Gene network for molecular transport, cellular function and maintenance, small
  molecule biochemistry. (b) Gene network for auditory and vestibular system development
  and function, organismal injury and abnormalities, cancer. Differentially expressed
  genes in the layers were used in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and significant gene
  networks based on IPA scores were identified.
