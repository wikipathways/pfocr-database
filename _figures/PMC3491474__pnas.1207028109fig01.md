caption: Proposed E. coli biotin synthetic pathway showing the catalytic role of BioH.
  Biotin biosynthesis is initiated by BioC methylation of ACP (or malonyl-CoA) to
  give malonyl-ACP methyl ester, which, after two successive cycles of fatty acid
  synthesis (FAS), becomes pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester. Once pimelate is synthesized,
  BioH hydrolyzes the methyl ester bond to expose the ω-carboxyl group and terminate
  chain elongation. The ACP moiety is subsequently released in the BioF reaction,
  the first step of biotin ring assembly.
