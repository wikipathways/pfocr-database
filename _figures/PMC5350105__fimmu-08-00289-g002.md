caption: 'M2 macrophage metabolism. M2 macrophages mainly produce ATP through an oxidative
  TCA cycle coupled to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). To fuel the TCA cycle,
  M2 macrophages rely on fatty acid oxidation (or β-oxidation) and glutamine metabolism.
  Furthermore, M2 macrophages show a lowered glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP). Moreover, M2 macrophages convert l-arginine into urea and l-ornithine, which
  serves as precursor for l-proline production. All important metabolic reactions
  present in M1/M2 macrophages are shown in black, reactions shown in gray are absent
  or less pronounced. The metabolic pathways strongly upregulated by M1/M2 macrophage
  polarization are highlighted in orange. All metabolic enzymes are indicated in green.
  Dotted lines represent impaired metabolic reactions. Abbreviations: α-KG: α-ketoglutarate;
  ARG: arginase; CD: cluster of differentiation; CPT: carnitine palmitoyl transferase;
  ETC: electron transport chain; LAL: lysosomal acid lipase; PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PFK: phosphofructokinase; SLC: solute carrier.'
