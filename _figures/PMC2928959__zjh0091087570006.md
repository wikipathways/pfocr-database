caption: 'Hypothetical model for EGFR-dependent loss of cell polarity and activation
  of Wnt signaling in CS-exposed human airway epithelium. A: The cell membrane of
  polarized airway epithelial cells is separated into apical and basolateral domains
  by intercellular junctional complexes located at the apicolateral cell membrane.
  MUC1 on the apical membrane, EGFR on the basolateral membrane, and β-catenin in
  complex with E-cadherin at the AJs (as part of junctional complex) form landmarks
  that delineate a polarized epithelial surface. Under normal physiological conditions,
  Wnt signaling occurs via the cell surface receptor, Frizzled (Fz) is off, and intracellular
  β-catenin released from the AJs is targeted by the GSK3β/Axin/APC complex for ubiquitination
  and degradation. B: On CS exposure, basolateral membrane-restricted EGFR is phosphorylated
  and translocated intracellularly. The cytoplasmic tail (CT) of transmembrane-MUC1
  physically interacts with intracellularly translocated pEGFR and is phosphorylated
  either directly by pEGFR or through unidentified intermediates. Via an EGFR-dependent
  mechanism, MUC1-CT is cleaved from its extracellular mucin domain and released intracellularly
  where it forms a complex with β-catenin. MUC1-CT, E-cadherin, and adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC) share a common binding motif structure for β-catenin; thus, MUC1-CT might
  potentially contribute to loss of cell-cell adhesion through competitive binding
  of β-catenin away from its complex with E-cadherin at the AJs as well as stabilize
  β-catenin by preventing APC complex-mediated β-catenin degradation. In complex with
  MUC1-CT, β-catenin accumulates in the cell nucleus and subsequently leads to the
  trans-activation of Wnt downstream nuclear target genes through the binding of its
  cotranscriptional factor, Lef-1 on DNA. The aberrant activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling in response to smoke is distinct from the “conventional” counterpart in
  that the smoke-elicited one is primarily EGFR-dependent (inhibited by AG1478) and
  the conventional counterpart is typically Wnt receptor-dependent (inhibited by Dkk-1).
  Structural molecules related to cell polarity and signaling molecules related to
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in response to CS are highlighted in colors.
  Dotted lines indicate hypothetical pathways that await further study.'
