caption: Multiple stresses promote the unfolded protein response (UPR) in tumor cells,
  such as hypoxia, activation of the oncogenic transcription factor Myc, and inhibition
  of the growth-promoting kinase Braf. In response to these stimuli, UPR-dependent
  activation of the ER-resident kinase, PERK has been most strongly implicated in
  the induction of autophagy as a cytoprotective pathway. Hypoxia activates PERK,
  which phosphorylates eIF2α to suppress global translation and to selectively induce
  ATF4. ATF4 is a transcription factor that promotes expression of the transcription
  factor CHOP. Together, ATF4 and CHOP drive expression of multiple core autophagy
  machinery genes, including ULK1, MAP1LC3B (LC3), and ATG5, which collectively promote
  autophagosome formation (see ). Although the mechanisms by which PERK induces autophagy
  during Myc activation and Braf inhibition have not been determined, activation of
  ATF4 and CHOP downstream of PERK may similarly induce the transcription of core
  autophagy regulators.
