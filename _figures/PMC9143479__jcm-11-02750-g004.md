caption: Representation of the predicted biological pathways associated with INMD
  genes included in the gene-panel design. Gene expression values (p-value < 0.05)
  are represented using Reactome pathway enrichment analysis. The majority of the
  genes included in the INMD gene panel are predicted to be highly expressed in muscle
  contraction, neuronal system, signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, ECM,
  vesicle-mediated transport, and cellular responses to stimuli.
