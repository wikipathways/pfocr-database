caption: Molecular mechanisms of TNF‐induced necroptosis. A variety of signals may
  initiate necroptosis, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) remains the most principal
  trigger of necroptosis. Upon stimulation of TNF, TNFR1 recruits TRADD and binds
  with RIPK1 to form complex I, including TRAF2, cIAP1/2, IKK and TAK1 complexes.
  In complex I, the M1‐Ubi of RIPK1 activates NF‐κB signalling pathway, which is regulated
  by M1‐Ubi enzyme complex LUBAC and the deubiquitinating complex CYLD. On the contrary,
  K63 ubiquitination mediates RIPK1 activation and subsequent cell death signalling,
  which is inhibited by ABIN‐1 and A20 or facilitated by PELI1. Activated RIPK1 connects
  with FADD and caspase‐8 to assemble into complex II, where caspase‐8 cleaves RIPK1
  and triggers apoptosis. When caspase‐8 is inhibited, RIPK1 interacts with RIPK3
  to form the RIPK1‐RIPK3 complex. Multiple ubiquitination of RIPK3 modulated by A20,
  CHIP and PARK2 can suppress RIPK1‐RIPK3 complex formation. Furthermore, RIPK1 and
  RIPK3 phosphorylate each other and create complex called ‘necrosome’. In necrosome,
  MK2 and DAPK1 act as negative regulators of RIPK1 to dampen necroptosis, and Ppm1b
  is identified as a RIPK3 phosphatase that prevents necroptosis through dephosphorylating
  RIPK3. During necroptosis, RIPK3 phosphorylates MLKL, which triggers its oligomerization
  and conveys to plasma membrane to form defined pores that induce plasma membrane
  permeabilization, resulting in the release of cellular contents including damage‐associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines to execute inflammation
