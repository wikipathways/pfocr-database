caption: Suggested PML/RARA-related signaling pathway that leads to cell proliferation
  and the evasion of apoptosis. The PML/RARA oncoprotein is active when interacting
  with JUP, and in-turn interacts with CTNNB1. CTNNB1 is active in the cellular membrane
  or in its free form in the cytosol. CTNNB1 is internalized into the nucleus by TCF/LEF,
  leading to cell proliferation or evasion of apoptosis. For cell proliferation, the
  TCF/LEF protein activates c-Myc which then interacts with CKS1. CKS1 then activates
  SKP1/2, which in-turn inhibits the function of CDKN1B and CDK2/cyclin E. Active
  Rb inhibits E2F, which promotes the constant proliferation of immature promyelocytes.
  For the evasion of apoptosis, TCF/LEF activates survivin to inhibit the function
  of CAS9/3. PML, promyelocytic leukemia; RARA, retinoic acid receptor α; JUP, junction
