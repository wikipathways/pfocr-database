caption: A Model for the Establishment and Elaboration of CNS AsymmetryOn the left
  side of the schematic, events in the epiphysial region of the forebrain from late
  gastrula to 20 somite stage are indicated in the large blue oval. Events in the
  LPM are shown in the green boxes. Black lines and lettering indicate that the gene/pathway
  is active, while gray lines and lettering indicate repression/lack of activation.In
  the late gastrula neural plate, Axin1 bilaterally represses Wnt signaling in the
  epithalamus, allowing the establishment of bilateral repression of epithalamic Nodal
  expression that is carried through to late somite stages. This repression is overcome
  on the left side by Spw activity from the LPM.In the LPM, the Nodal pathway is activated
  by Nodal signals emanating from around KV (or the node—see ), and activation is
  subsequently propagated through the left LPM and is shut down on the right. Manipulations
  to Wnt signaling at this stage (after regression of KV) can disrupt the propagation
  of Nodal expression. Not shown is the ability of Nodal signals on one side of the
  LPM to block activation of the pathway on the other side (). Although Spw normally
  only relieves repression in the left epithalamus, the bilateral symmetry of repression
  in the epithalamus means that any manipulations or mutations that result in right-sided
  Spw activity will concordantly lead to right-sided epithalamic activation of Nodal
  signaling.On the right side of the schematic, events downstream of left-sided activation
  of Nodal signaling are shown. Nodal signaling influences the laterality of parapineal
  and habenular asymmetries, but not their establishment per se. How Nodal does this
  is unknown, and it is not clear whether the pathway exerts its effects primarily
  through actions on the parapineal, the left habenula, or both (dashed arrows). Axin1
  is required for the elaboration of asymmetries downstream of Nodal signaling, both
  for timely migration of parapineal cells (pp) and for the communication between
  habenula and parapineal that ensure concordant elaboration of neuroanatomical asymmetries.The
  spiral symbolises the ciliary flow in KV; lhab, left habenula; rhab, right habenula;

  description: A Model for the Establishment and Elaboration of CNS AsymmetryOn the
    left side of the schematic, events in the epiphysial region of the forebrain from
    late gastrula to 20 somite stage are indicated in the large blue oval. Events
    in the LPM are shown in the green boxes. Black lines and lettering indicate that

    signaling in the epithalamus, allowing the establishment of bilateral repression
    of epithalamic Nodal expression that is carried through to late somite stages.
    This repression is overcome on the left side by Spw activity from the LPM.In the
    LPM, the Nodal pathway is activated by Nodal signals emanating from around KV
    (or the node—see ), and activation is subsequently propagated through the left

    (after regression of KV) can disrupt the propagation of Nodal expression. Not
    shown is the ability of Nodal signals on one side of the LPM to block activation
    of the pathway on the other side (). Although Spw normally only relieves repression
    in the left epithalamus, the bilateral symmetry of repression in the epithalamus
