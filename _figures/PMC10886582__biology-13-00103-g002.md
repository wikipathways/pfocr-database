caption: Ferroptosis manifests through two primary pathways. In the first pathway,
  transferrin (TRF1), a crucial player in iron homeostasis, binds to Fe3+, forming
  a complex, which then binds to the transferrin receptor. Endocytosis of this complex
  occurs, leading to the formation of the endosome. Within the endosome, there will
  be acidification of the environment, causing the dissociation of the complex and
  the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. This Fe2+ is released through the endosomal membrane.
  However, surplus free iron ions form a labile iron pool (LIP), which partakes in
  Fenton’s reactions, causing the generation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  free radical hydroxyl. This cascade of events culminates in the initiation of lipoperoxidation,
  a critical step in the ferroptotic process. In the second pathway, System Xc-, a
  cystine/glutamate antiporter, imports extracellular cystine. Intracellularly, cystine
  undergoes conversion into glutathione (GSH), a vital antioxidant. The availability
  of GSH is integral to the function of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which tackles
  intracellular lipid peroxides, preventing ferroptosis. However, the inhibition of
  GPX4 leads to a disruption in this protective mechanism, resulting in an augmented
  presence of ROS and ultimately contributing to the progression of ferroptosis. [Image
