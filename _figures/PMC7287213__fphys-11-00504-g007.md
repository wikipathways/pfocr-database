caption: 'Binding site, signaling pathway and functional effect of various intracellular
  signaling molecules and co-factors on IKs. Left Table: Functional effect of protein
  kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation, ATP, Ca2+, CaM, CaM1234, and PIP2 on IKs where “+”
  and “–” denotes a stimulatory and inhibitory effect, respectively. “Obligatory”
  indicates ATP is required for channel conductance. Left panel: Cartoon of the single
  transmembrane β-subunit KCNE1 and the α-subunit KCNQ1. KCNQ1 consists of 6 transmembrane
  domains (TM1-4 and TM5-6 form the voltage sensor and pore domain, respectively)
  and 4 helices (A–D). Four KCNQ1 subunits come together to form the channel with
  1-4 KCNE1 subunits. Binding sites for ATP, CaM/CaM1234 and PIP2 as well as sites
  of PKA phosphorylation are depicted using colored arrows (for binding sites) or
  directly on KCNQ1 (for PKA phosphorylation). Ca2+ is known to bind to CaM but not
  CaM1234 however, Ca2+ may modulate the channel by binding and interacting with other
  proteins and/or other locations on the IKs channel complex which are presently unknown.
  Right Table: The impact of KCNE1:KCNQ1 stoichiometry on the phosphorylation of residues
  S27 and S92 by PKA and the consequent functional effect. Checkmarks indicate PKA
  phosphorylation occurs or a functional effect is seen on the respective stoichiometrically
  fixed KCNE1:KCNQ1 complex (EQ, EQQ, EQQQQ, and KCNQ1). The “X” indicates a functional
  effect is not seen despite PKA phosphorylation of KCNQ1. Right panel: Signaling
  pathway for β-adrenergic enhancement of IKs current through PKA phosphorylation.'
