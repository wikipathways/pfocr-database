caption: Biosynthetic pathway for ectoines from aspartate in C. salexigens. The solid
  and dashed lines indicate established and proposed steps, respectively. The enzymes
  involved are Aspartate kinase (Ask), Aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Asd),
  L-diaminobutyric acid transaminase (EctB), L-diaminobutyric acid acetyl transferase
  (EctA), ectoine synthase (EctC), and ectoine hydroxylase (EctD).
