caption: 'The de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway including the steps from
  phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to IMP is shown. Reactions 1, 4, and 8 are catalyzed
  by glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, formylglycinamide ribonucleotide
  synthase, and adenylosuccinate lyase, respectively. Reactions 2, 3 and 5 are catalyzed
  by the trifunctional glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) formyltransferase (GARFTase)
  which contains GAR synthase (reaction 2), GAR formyltransferase (GARFTase; reaction
  3) and 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthase (reaction 5) activities. Reactions
  6 and 7 are catalyzed by the bifunctional phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase/phosphoribosylaminoimidazole
  succinocarboxamide synthetase enzyme, which contains carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide
  synthase (reaction 6) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-(N-succinylocarboxamide) ribonucleotide
  synthase (reaction 7) activities. Reactions 9 and 10 are catalyzed by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
  ribonucleotide formyltransferase (AICARFTase)/IMP cyclohydrolase that catalyzes
  the last two steps in the pathway for de novo synthesis of IMP. Folate-dependent
  reactions (reactions 3 and 9) in which 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate (THF) serves as
  the one-carbon donor are catalyzed by GARFTase and AICARFTase. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
  (AICA) and AICA ribonucleoside (AICAR) can be metabolized to 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
  ribonucleotide monophosphate (ZMP) by either adenine phosphoribosyl transferase
  (APRT) or adenosine kinase (AK), thus circumventing the reaction catalyzed by GARFTase.
  The activation of AMPK that results in inhibition of mTOR is also depicted. Abbreviations:
  AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside; FGAR, formyl glycinamide ribonucleotide;
  FAICAR, formyl 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide; MP, monophosphate.'
