caption: Invertebrate PGRP function in symbiont colonization and symbiosis homeostasis.
  (A) In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, peptidoglycan recognition proteins
  (PGRPs) are important for keeping the balance between activating an immune response
  to pathogenic bacteria and preserving the beneficial microbiota [reviewed in ()].
  Peptidoglycan (PGN) derived from gut microbiota activates basal antimicrobial peptide
  (AMP) production via the PGRP receptor PGRP-LC (shown in orange) and the immune
  deficiency (Imd) signaling pathway. Secreted PGRP-LB (shown in purple) hydrolyzes
  excessive PGN downregulating antimicrobial defenses to promote host tolerance toward
  the microbiota (). (B) In mosquitos, PGRPs mediate gut homeostasis and symbiosis.
  Similar to its function in D. melanogaster, PGRP-LC (shown in orange) detects microbiota
  derived PGN and activates the Imd pathway to promote immune effectors (AMPs, reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), whereas a soluble PGRP (PGRP-LB) (shown
  in purple) hydrolyzes excessive PGN to promote tolerance [see () and references
  therein]. In addition, the receptor PGRP-LD (shown in dark purple) also protects
  the gut microbiota by dampening immune activities, and this action is key to maintaining
  the integrity of the peritrophic matrix (PM), which acts as barrier against parasitic
  infection by Plasmodium (). (C) In the symbiosis between the Hawaiian bobtail squid
  Euprymna scolopes and the bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri, the symbiont
  PGN-derived tracheal cytotoxin (TCT) activates mucus production to promote colonization.
  As symbiont colonization progresses, EsPGRP1 is silenced to induce apoptosis and
  rearrangement of the host light organ. The amidase activity of EsPGRP2 detoxifies
  TCT to promote symbiont tolerance. Figure created with Biorender.com. Silhouette
