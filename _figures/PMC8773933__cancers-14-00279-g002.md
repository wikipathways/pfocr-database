caption: Mechanism of estrogen signaling and its inhibition by endocrine agents in
  breast cancer cells. (A) Classical genomic pathway. Estrogen (E2) upon binding to
  the estrogen receptor (ER), translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to estrogen
  response elements (EREs) within target genes. Coregulators (CoR) recruited to ER
  modulate gene expression. (B) Genomic, non-classical pathway. ER in the nucleus
  binds to target genes indirectly through interactions with transcription factors
  (TF). (C) Genomic, ligand-independent pathway. ER is activated by phosphorylation
  induced by kinases activated upon receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated signaling.
  (D) Non-genomic, ligand pathway. Membrane-associated ER-bound with E2 activates
  RTKs and protein kinase cascades, which can also activate transcription factors
  modulating gene expression. (E) Convergence of non-genomic and genomic signaling.
  Activation of RTKs and protein kinases by ER-E2 complexes lead to the phosphorylation
  of ERs, coregulators, transcription factors regulating target gene transcription
  at multiple regulatory elements (RE). (F) Mechanism of endocrine agents. Aromatase
  inhibitors (AI) block estrogen production. Selective estrogen receptor modulators
  (SERMs), e.g., tamoxifen, competitively bind to ER, blocking the association with
  E2. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERDs), e.g., fulvestrant, inhibit ER
  dimerization. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 5 December 2021).
