caption: Carotenoid biosynthesis. The mechanisms of carotenoid synthesis seem to be
  common to all algae and terrestrial plants. The first connection point is made from
  lycopene. The synthesis of δ–carotene and its derivatives is absent in red microalgae
  and brown algae (grey insert), while the synthesis of β–carotene is also common
  to all organisms. The second point of divergence appears during the first xanthophyll
  cycle (black circle) partially found in red algae. In terrestrial plants, violaxanthin
  is transformed into neoxanthin, the starting point for the synthesis of abscisic
  acid (ABA), among other metabolites. Nevertheless, if this step exists in various
  algal groups, it seems to be carried out by different enzymes. Finally, stramenopiles
  have a second xanthophyll cycle (black square), for which one of the supposed precursors
  is also neoxanthin and whose enzymes remain to be determined (brown insert). Since
  pathways have been hypothesized for diatoms, we extended this hypothesis to brown
  algae. The figure is based on our results and the following references [,,,,,,,,,].
