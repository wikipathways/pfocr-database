caption: 'A schematic overview of key reactions occurring in blood and incited by
  the biomaterial surface. Protein adsorption is often accompanied by cell rupture,
  which initiates the complement system''s intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways.
  Coagulation pathway activation causes the production of a fibrin network. The figure
  includes complement activation and the appearance of complement proteins on the
  biomaterial interface. These represent the classical pathway as well as alternative
  pathway involving convertases that have been shown to participate in complement
  activation following response to the biomaterial. The scheme of eicosanoids biosynthesis
  pathways from arachidonic acid XII, XIIa, XI, Xia, IX, IXa, X and Xa: coagulation
  factors: vWF, von Willebrand factor, IL: interleukin, INF: interferon, IgG: immunoglobulin
  G, LOX: lipoxygenase, COX: cyclooxygenase.'
