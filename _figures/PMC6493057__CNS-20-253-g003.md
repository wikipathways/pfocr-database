caption: Additive mechanism of pathway convergence and divergence in Huntington's
  disease signaling pathway. On the basis of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) knowledge
  base, the overlapping components between T Cell Receptor Signaling of baicalin (BA)
  group and Huntington's disease signaling of BJ group were Ca2+, PIP3, c‐Jun, JNK1,
  PIP2, IP3, DAG, PI3K, GRB2, SOS, hRas, and ERK/1/2; those between ERK/MAPK signaling
  of jasminoidin (JA) group and Huntington's disease signaling of BJ group were CREB,
  SHC, PIP2, IP3, DAG, PI3K, GRB2, SOS, hRas, and ERK/1/2; and the overlapping ones
  among the three groups were PIP2, IP3, DAG, PI3K, GRB2, SOS, hRas, and ERK/1/2.
  Differentially expressed genes in the three groups are marked with pink, blue, green,
  and yellow arrows, up‐ and down‐regulated genes were labeled with the up and down
  arrow, respectively. The overlapping components between the different groups are
  marked with different color stars.
