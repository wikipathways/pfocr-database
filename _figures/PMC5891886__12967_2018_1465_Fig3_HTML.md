caption: Epithelial proteomic networks for TRIM28 high (a) and low (b) ratio cases.
  Both, TRIM28 high (a) and TRIM28 low ratio (b) epithelial tumor tissue proteomic
  networks consist of three main sub-networks (green, pink and light green). Dominant
  nodes in the high ratio networks represent pro-survival pathways. Prominent nodes
  in the low ratio proteomic networks represent pro-apoptotic pathways. Nodes represent
  proteins quantified by RPPA; the bigger the node, the more significant correlations
  relative to that molecule. Each line connecting 2 nodes represents a significant
  correlation between the nodes; the thicker the line, the higher the Spearman ρ correlation.
  Proteins are grouped on the basis of Spearman ρ values and the number of connections
  among a group of nodes; strongly correlated nodes are represented close to each
  other and with the same color
