caption: The various stages during breast tumor development and progression are depicted
  along a single duct, going from normal epithelium, through hyperplasia, DCIS, tumor
  and finally tumor growth and metastasis. STAT1, which is probably activated by interferons,
  is a tumor suppressor. However, STAT1 also promotes tumor resistance to therapy
  by suppressing the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. STAT6, which is activated
  by IL-4, induces the differentiation of T-helper type 2 cells, which promotes tumor
  establishment and metastasis.
