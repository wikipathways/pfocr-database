caption: Predicted metabolic pathways. (A) Fatty acid synthesis, (B) glycerolipid
  synthesis, and (C) hypothetical biosynthesis pathway for 2-butenoic acid ester.
  These pathways were drawn on the basis of the KEGG pathways map00061 and map00561
  and the schematic pathway proposed by Liu et al. []. Pink and light-blue boxes denote
  compounds and enzymes, respectively. Predicted genes of OM-1 are shown by red letters.
  Inserted bar graphs showed relative gene expression under the nitrogen-supplemented
  and nitrogen-depleted conditions. Red and blue bars mean up-regulation under the
  nitrogen-depleted condition and down-regulation under the nitrogen-supplemented
  condition, respectively. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).
