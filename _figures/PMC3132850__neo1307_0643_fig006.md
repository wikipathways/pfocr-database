caption: Model of functional inactivation of merlin by two-step phosphorylation. Under
  growth-inhibitory conditions, unphosphorylated functionally active merlin is in
  a closed conformation. On growth factor signaling, either PKA or PAK phosphorylates
  serine 518, leading to a more open conformation. At this conformation, merlin is
  susceptible to Akt- or PKA-mediated phosphorylation of serine 10, which subsequently
  triggers degradation and inactivation of merlin through the proteasome pathway.
