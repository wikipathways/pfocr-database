caption: Pathway enrichment analysis of the primary pathway-associated differential
  metabolite sets. In these networks, the node indicates the correlated metabolisms,
  and the lines between two nodes represent the biological relationships between two
  metabolites. The size of the node indicates the VIP value, and the color indicates
  the log2FC. The lines represented the metabolic pathway. A indicates the soybean
  seedling stage; B indicates the soybean mature stage; C indicates the soybean profuse
  flowering stage
