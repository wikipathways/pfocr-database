caption: (A) Exponentially growing cultures exhibit aerobic glycolysis and rely on
  elevated glutamine consumption to fuel mitochondrial metabolism. This results in
  increased lactate and ammonium production as cells rewire their metabolism to maintain
  carbon, nitrogen, and redox balance. (B) Stationary phase cultures metabolize glucose
  mainly by oxidation in the TCA cycle, which provides much higher ATP yields and
  reduced byproduct accumulation. An increased proportion of incoming glucose is diverted
  into the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to maintain NADPH levels.
