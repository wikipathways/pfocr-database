caption: Fatty acid, triacylglycerol synthesis pathway, and function of phospholipase.
  (A) A schematic diagram of fatty acid and triacylglycerol synthesis pathway in plants.
  The figure illustrates the acyl-CoA synthesis pathway in the plastid and triacylglycerol
  (TAG) synthesis pathway by acyltransferase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Polyunsaturated
  fatty acids are synthesized in phosphatidylcholine (PC) by desaturase enzymes such
  as fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD2) and FAD3. The FAE1 enzyme elongates the 18:1 fatty
  acid to 20:1 or 22:1, which are very long-chain fatty acids. Red-colored letters
  indicate the enzyme that was studied using Clustered regularly interspaced short
  palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9). The
  dotted lines represent the flow of the fatty acids in fatty acid and triacylglycerol
  synthesis. ACCase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; CoA, coenzyme
