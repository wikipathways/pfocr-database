caption: 'Pathway enrichment analysis of the OAT1-centered metabolic interaction network
  identifies several essential biochemical pathways affected by the absence of OAT1.
  A, graph of pathway enrichment analysis comparing the -log(p) to the impact on the
  various pathways for the network metabolites. Some of the affected pathways are
  indicated with circles colored based on the p value (darker red indicates a lower
  p value, whereas yellow indicates less significance) and sized based on the impact
  on the pathway (larger circles have a greater impact). Pathway impact accounts for
  both the number of affected nodes and its importance with the maximum importance
  of each pathway being 1. B, the TCA cycle pathway is shown as an example of an affected
  pathway as it has the highest percentage of hits with wet-lab support (see ). Affected
  pathway metabolites are highlighted in red and those with wet-lab support for OAT1
  interaction have a green border. The number within the rectangle is the KEGG ID
  for each metabolite, the seven metabolites shown in red are: C00022-pyruvate, C00149-malate,
  C00042-succinate, C00122-fumarate, C00158-citrate, C00311-isocitrate, C00026-2-oxoglutarate.'
