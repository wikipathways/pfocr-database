caption: PRR signaling in testicular cells. Several TLRs, including TLR2–TLR6, are
  expressed and functional in Sertoli cells.,, TLR3, TLR4, MDA5 and RIG-I initiate
  the innate immune response in Leydig cells., TLR3, TLR11 and MDA5 are functional
  in germ cells.,, After ligand recognition, the TLR conformation changes due to the
  recruitment of adaptors, including the MyD88 and/or the TRIF. All other TLRs exclusively
  initiate the MyD88-dependent pathway, except for TLR3 and TLR4. TLR3 exclusively
  triggers the TRIF-dependent pathway. TLR4 initiates both the MyD88- and TRIF-dependent
  pathways. MDA5 and RIG-I activation recruits IPS-1, thus initiating the IPS-1-dependent
  signaling pathway. Different PRR signaling pathways activate multiple transcription
  factors, including AP1 and NF-κB, to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression,
  as well as IRFs, for induction of type 1 IFN-α/β. AP1, activator protein 1; IFN,
  interferon; IPS-1, IFN-β promoter stimulator 1; IRF, interferon regulatory factor;
  MDA5, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  protein 88; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene
  I; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRIF, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein-inducing
  interferon-β.
