caption: 'Schematic representation of the signalling effects of xylose on a the background
  strain line, and b on the ira2∆isu1∆ double deletion. High xylose concentrations
  resulted in a low glucose-signal in all the biosensors in the background strain (a),
  but this was not the case for ira2∆isu1∆ (b). Solid arrows: reactions/transport;
  dashed arrows: induction (arrowhead) or repression (hammerhead). a was adapted from
  our previous work []. HXT1 belongs to the Snf3p/Rgt2p pathway, SUC2 to the SNF1/Mig1p
  pathway and TPS1 to the cAMP/PKA pathway (Fig. )'
