caption: Graphic illustration of ammonium metabolism in a tumor cell, emphasizing
  the role of GNPDA1.Tumor cells are known for surviving in reduced blood supply conditions
  and hypoxic environments. The concentration of NH4+ can reach significantly high
  levels of 0.14–5 mM, compared to the 0.027–0.05 mM found in normal tissues [90].
  The GNPDA1 catabolic reaction releases NH4+, as well as glutaminase 1, and contributes
  to increasing the intracellular concentration of NH4+. On the contrary, the fixing
  NH4+ reactions include (a) carbamoyl phosphate synthase II (CPS-II) and (b) GlcN6P
  synthase (GFAT). CPS-II and GFAT use Gln to synthesize carbamoyl-phosphate (CP)
  and GlcN6P, respectively. CP is used in the pyrimidine nucleotides biosynthetic
  pathway, yielding uridine triphosphate (UTP). Finally, UTP is utilized in the synthesis
  of UDP-GlcNAc. In addition, amino acids, glutathione, DNA, and RNA purine nucleotides
  can also be synthesized from Gln. They are necessary for cell proliferation and
  survival. These mechanisms decrease the potential toxic effects of NH4+
