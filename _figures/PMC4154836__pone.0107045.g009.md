caption: GSPs decrease the expression of Bcl-2 while increasing the expression of
  Bak-1 and result in the enhancement of mitochondrial membrane permeability associated
  with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Subsequently, the release
  of cytochrome c from mitochondria leads to the activation of caspase-9 and -3, finally
  resulting in apoptosis.
