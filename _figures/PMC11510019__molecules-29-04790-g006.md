caption: Illustration of MEHH phenolic acids mitigating oxidative stress by modulating
  various pathways. The arrow (→) indicates enhancement. Oxidative stress denotes
  the physiological and pathological responses of cells and tissues to the accumulation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen radicals (RNS) stimulated
  by harmful internal and external environmental factors. MEHHs phenolic acids counteract
  oxidative stress and improve disorders in glucose and lipid metabolism by activating
  Nrf2, reducing ER stress, and regulating associated oxidative factors
