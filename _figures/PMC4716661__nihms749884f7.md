caption: TGFβ bound TGFβRII recruits TGFβRI (ALK5 or ALK1), forms a heteromeric complex,
  and phosphorylates TGFβRI. The phosphorylated ALK5 and ALK1 phosphorylate Smad 2/3
  and Smad 1/5/8, respectively. Activated Smad2/3 promotes the quiescence of EC, while
  activated Smad 1/5/8 promote EC proliferation and migration. Endoglin is phosphorylated
  by TGFβRII and ALK5/ALK1 complex and phosphorylated endoglin by ALK1 modulates ALK1
  dependent EC growth and adhesion []. In addition, endoglin participate in none-cananical
  signaling pathways such as MAPK pathways. Our recent studies showed that appropriate
  expression of endoglin in EC is essential for attenuation of MAPK/ERKs pathway and
  regulation of their angiogenic properties [].
