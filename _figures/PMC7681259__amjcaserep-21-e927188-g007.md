caption: The working hypothesis regarding the putative pathophysiological link between
  cavernous liver hemangioma and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Blocking
  of calcium egress from the endoplasmic reticulum by defective polycystin-2 leads
  to ERK1/2 activation via the AC6-cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway, and by means
  of hypoxia-inducible-factor-1α mediation, to vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) secretion and autocrine and paracrine stimulation of VEGFR-2. VEGFR-2 activation
  results in activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway, which induces proliferation
  of cells in the tubular epithelium, cholangiocytes, and endothelium. The result
  is generation of cysts in the kidney and cysts and hemangiomas in the liver.

  description: The working hypothesis regarding the putative pathophysiological link
    between cavernous liver hemangioma and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
    Blocking of calcium egress from the endoplasmic reticulum by defective polycystin-2
    leads to ERK1/2 activation via the AC6-cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway, and
    by means of hypoxia-inducible-factor-1α mediation, to vascular endothelial growth
    factor (VEGF) secretion and autocrine and paracrine stimulation of VEGFR-2. VEGFR-2
    activation results in activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway, which induces
    proliferation of cells in the tubular epithelium, cholangiocytes, and endothelium.
    The result is generation of cysts in the kidney and cysts and hemangiomas in the
    liver.
