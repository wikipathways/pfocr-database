caption: 'Mechanisms of ibrutinib resistance in CLL and mutations in pathways governing
  BCR signaling.Notes: (A) The BTK mutation attenuated its binding to ibrutinib, resulting
  in a reduced ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of downstream molecules, thereby
  allowing the BCR signal to continue to be passed down. (B) LYN and SYK kinase bypassed
  BTK to directly activate the mutant PLCG2, which caused increased Ca2+ influx to
  activate different oncogenic pathways, including PIK3–Akt, NF-κB survival signaling,
  and the MAP kinase pathway. (C) The binding of IL-4 and IL-6 released from the microenvironment
  to their corresponding receptors activated JAK kinase, followed by the phosphorylation
  of the STAT6 or STAT3. The activated STAT upregulated the expression levels of anti-apoptotic
  proteins MCL-1 and BCL-xL. (D) The acquired short arm of chromosome 2 (2p+) induced
  the overexpression of XPO1. XPO1 promoted the export of tumor suppressor proteins
  (such as p53 and FOXO) to the cytoplasm, thereby relieving their inhibitory effect
  on the cell cycle. (E) Activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathways might lead
  to overexpression of PD-L1/PD-L2 in patients with RT.Abbreviations: IL-4, interleukin
  4; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT6, signal transducer and activator of transcription factor
  6; MCL-1, myeloid cell leukemia-1; BCL-xL, B-cell lymphoma-xL; XPO1, exportin-1.'
