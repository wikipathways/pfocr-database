caption: 'Pathway for synthesis of native and foreign lipids in E.  coli. The following
  enzymes are indicated with their respective genes  (from E. coli ()  unless indicated
  otherwise): 1, CDP-diacylglycerol synthase;  2, phosphatidylserine synthase; 3,
  phosphatidylserine  decarboxylase; 4, PGP synthase; 5, PGP phosphatase;  6, CL synthase;
  7, PG, pre-MDO  (membrane-derived oligosaccharide)  sn-glycerol-1-P transferase;
  8, diacylglycerol kinase;  9, MGlcDAG synthase (Acholeplasma laidlawii)  (); 10,
  DGlcDAG  synthase (A. laidlawii)  (); 11, PC synthase  (Legionella pneumophila)  ().
  The X in  phosphatidic acid is an OH and is in the position that changes depending
  on  the downstream pathway. The lipids in black (∼5% of total  phospholipids) and
  red are native to E. coli. The lipids in  green are foreign lipids introduced into
  E. coli carrying  the indicated genes.'
