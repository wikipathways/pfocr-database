caption: A schematic of the mechanism of Panax notoginseng root (PNR) in its enhancing
  of antiviral interferon-mediated immune responses and natural killer (NK) cell activity.
  PNR stimulates an antiviral state in murine macrophage cells by modulating the interferon
  (IFN) signaling pathway. PNR leads to the activation of IRF3 through TANK-binding
  kinase 1 (TBK1) and the production of type-I IFN. This secreted IFN can induce the
  inhibition of influenza A virus infection by stimulating the expression of stimulated
  target genes through the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1, and these effects may be attributable to the ability of PNR to induce NK cell
  activity.
