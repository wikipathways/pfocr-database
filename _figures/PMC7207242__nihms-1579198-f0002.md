caption: Bacteria utilize multiple methods to prevent complement-mediated lysis, including
  direct inhibition by preventing complement components from binding the bacterial
  surface and preventing recognition of opsonized bacteria, producing complement inhibitors,
  proteolytically cleaving complement components, and recruiting the host complement
  inhibitors to the bacterial surface. B. nIgM provides protection against invading
  bacteria by activation of classical complement pathway via C1q, increased opsonization
  and phagocytosis by innate like dendritic cells and macrophages, transport of antigens
  to secondary lymphoid organs and activation of adaptive immune responses, and clearance
  of DAMPs (e.g. dsDNA) minimizing the autoimmune responses. C. nIgG mediates the
  pathogen recognition and phagocytosis by acting as a bridge between Ficolins/MBL
  and FcγR1 receptors on phagocytes.
