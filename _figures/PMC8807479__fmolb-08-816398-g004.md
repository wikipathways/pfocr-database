caption: Schematic of the diphtamide modification of eEF2. The first step in this
  modification pathway is catalyzed by [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing protein complex
  Dph1/Dph2; with the help of Dph4/5/6/7. Dph3/Kti13 heterodimer act as electron donor
  for Dph1/Dph2 complex. It has been reported that diphtamide group of EF2 can further
  be ADP-ribosylated by the bacterial diphtheria toxin, leading to a global inhibition
  of protein synthesis as well as an upregulated translation of mRNAs associated with
  oxidative stress response.
