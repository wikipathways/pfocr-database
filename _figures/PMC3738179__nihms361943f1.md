caption: 'Structure of Primary Cilium: The primary cilium contains microtubule bundles
  (9 doublets arrayed as a cylindrical structure) that are nucleated from the basal
  body. The microtubule bundles are enclosed in a ciliary membrane that is continuous,
  but distinct, from the plasma membrane. At the base of the cilium are transition
  fibers localized in the transition zone. This transition zone is known to restrict
  passive diffusion of proteins in and out of the cilium. Kinesin 2 moves the IFT
  complex and its ‘cargo’ (e.g. Gli, Ptch and Smo) towards the plus-end of microtubules
  (ciliary tip). Dynein 2 moves the IFT complex and its ‘cargo’ towards the minus-end
  of microtubules (cell body).Hh Regulation: In the absence of Hh (left side) Gli
  protein is converted to its repressor form (GliR). Also in the absence of Hh, Ptch1
  is localized to the ciliary membrane and Smo is kept out of the cilium. In the presence
  of Hh (right side) Gli protein levels increase in the cilium and Gli is processed
  into the activator form (GliA) for transport out of the cilium and into the nucleus
  where it activates Hh target genes. In the presence of Hh, Ptch1 moves out of the
  cilium and Smo moves into the cilium where it promotes formation of the activator
  form of Gli (GliA).'
