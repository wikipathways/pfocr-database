caption: 'Schematic representation of SRC structure and regulation. The inactive form
  of SRC is illustrated on the left side, with the specification of each SH domain;
  in this closed conformation, the phosphorylation of Tyr530 on C-terminal creates
  a link with the SH2 and the catalytic site, which is positioned on SH1, becoming
  not accessible for the substrates. In the transition to the active form, the phosphorylation
  of Tyr419 is showed with the main pathways that act by downstream and upstream effectors.
  The conformational switch is mediated by many phosphatases, such as PTPα, PTPγ,
  SHP-1 and -2, and PTP1B, able to dephosphorylate SRC. The regulation of activated
  SRC is displayed with the RTKs and integrins signaling. In particular, the downstream
  effectors of RTKs/SRC interaction lead to target genes transcription for survival,
  proliferation, and angiogenesis sustainment. The interaction of integrins with ECM
  components and their localization on cell adhesion sites, determines the modulation
  of cell motility: The SRC signaling pathway induces a cascade that results in the
  phosphorylation of several proteins, such as FAK, talin, and paxillin, with the
  final actin cytoskeleton regulation that is responsible for migration and invasion
  mechanisms.'
