caption: Proposed vulnibactin biosynthesis pathway in V. vulnificus. 2, 3-DHBA and
  SA are synthesized from the common precursor chorismate and are activated by AMP
  ligases encoded by VV2_0836 and VV2_0840 for siderophore assembly. In presence of
  iron and hydroxyl radicals SA can be non-enzymatically converted to 2, 3-DHBA (dashed
  arrow) that then may be routed to synthesis of a yet unidentified siderophore composed
  solely of 2, 3-DHBA. Question marks (?) represent the fact that identity of the
  reaction or the alternate siderophore is yet to be established.
