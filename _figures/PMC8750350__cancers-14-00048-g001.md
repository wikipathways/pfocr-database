caption: 'Programmed cell death pathways initiated by TNF and FAS: (A) The TNF–TNFR1
  cascade simultaneously activates proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signals, and diverse
  signaling complexes are formed. Complex I, composed by the adaptor protein TRADD,
  the receptor RIPK1, and the E3 ligase TRAF2, enables the recruitment of the inhibitor
  NF-ƙB kinase complex, comprising IKKα/β and NEMO. Subsequently, the inhibitor of
  NF-ƙB (IƙBα) is ubiquitinated and NF-ƙB translocates to the nucleus, promoting the
  expression of survival and antiapoptotic genes such as Bcl2 and c-FLIP. (B) In the
  FAS/TRAIL-mediated apoptotic pathway, binding of FASL/TRAIL to their cognate receptors
  results in FAS clustering and binding to FADD. TRADD dissociates from complex I
  and associates with FADD to form complex IIa, which triggers caspase-8 activation
  and, consequently, apoptosis. Complex IIb, or ripoptosome, is highly dependent on
  RIPK1 activity, and represents an alternative death complex that induces apoptosis
  through direct activation of caspase-8. (C) In contrast, caspase-8 can be inhibited
  under certain physiological or pharmacological conditions, promoting the shift from
  the ripoptosome-induced apoptosis to necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis
  via complex IIc or necrosome. RIPK3 mediates the phosphorylation of MLKL, resulting
  in its conformational change and oligomerization. This allows MLKL to bind to plasma
  membrane lipids and form a pore that leads to cell lysis. Release of cellular components
  (cytokines, chemokines and DAMPs) perpetuates liver inflammation and fibrogenesis
  in a pro-tumoral microenvironment, thus promoting HCC development. Abbreviations:
