caption: HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-controlling enzyme in the mevalonate pathway
  and is subject to feedback regulation by downstream products. It is also inhibited
  by statins. FPP synthase converts IPP and DMAPP to GPP and FPP intermediates and
  is inhibited by aminobisphosphonates and alkylamines. Loss of FPP and GGPP leads
  to the loss of membrane anchoring of signaling proteins causing signaling defects
  and, in some cases, apoptosis.
