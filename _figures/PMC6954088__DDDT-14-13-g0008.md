caption: Schematic overview of the proposed mechanism for AAV9-shMyh9 against I/R-induced
  neuronal injury. I/R induces caspase-3 cleavage, the activation of ROCK1, and then
  the phosphorylation of MLC (Ser-19), which activates NMMHC IIA and facilitates its
  association with actin, initiating cell apoptosis. The increased NMMHC IIA-actin
  interaction, in turn, amplifies the activation of caspase-3, sensitizing I/R-induced
  apoptosis. AAV9-shMyh9 could directly interfere with the NMMHC IIA-actin interaction,
  and then inhibit caspase3/ROCK1/MLC signaling pathway activation, attenuate apoptotic
  under I/R.
