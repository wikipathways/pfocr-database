caption: Model on reprogramming the phospholipid biosynthesis pathway by the p33 replication
  protein. (A) In the absence of p33 and when low amount of PA is present in the ER
  membrane, then Opi1p repressor is released from the ER and relocated to the nucleus
  to inhibit transcription by Ino2p/Ino4p. This leads to repression of transcription
  of phospholipid biosynthesis genes and inhibition of phospholipid biosynthesis.
  (B) The tombusvirus p33 replication protein binds to Opi1p repressor and the Scs2p
  VAP protein. These interactions prevent the activation and possibly the nuclear
  relocalization of Opi1p repressor and might lead to degradation of Opi1p. As a consequence,
  Ino2p/Ino4p transcription activators induce the constitutive transcription of the
  phospholipid biosynthesis genes, leading to the production of the corresponding
  mRNAs, followed by new phospholipid synthesis and membrane formation. We propose
  that these new lipids and membranes are hijacked by the virus for replication in
  yeast cells.
