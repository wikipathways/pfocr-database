caption: A schematic representation of how NF-κB DNA binding is regulated by IκB degradation
  and processing following activating stimuli. (A) IκB degradation mechanism that
  depends on site-specific phosphorylation of IκBs mediated by activated IKKβ in the
  IKK complex as well as CKII. Unique intracellular signaling complexes (which contains
  more components as shown, e.g., CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1-Caspase-8-CK1α complex downstream
  of T cell receptor [TCR] ligation []) phosphorylate and activate the IKK complex
  depending on the initial stimulus (e.g., TNF, immunoreceptors, and DNA damage).
  IKKβ phosphorylates serine residues located in the amino-terminus of IκBs following
  TNF and TCR stimulation. In contrast, NF-κB induction by ultraviolet light and select
  chemotherapeutic agents requires the MAP kinase p38 and CKII. CKII phosphorylates
  serine residues located in the carboxyl terminus of IκBs. Phosphorylation of IκBs
  leads to successive ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation. The removal of
  IκBs liberates NF-κB complexes for nuclear translocation and binding to cognate
  regions in target genes. (B) The alternative pathway, which is induced by a few
  stimuli including CD40L, LT-β, and BAFF. NIK and IKKα are critical kinases for the
  phosphorylation of p100 at regulatory serine residues within its carboxyl terminus.
  This causes proteasomal degradation of the carboxyl terminus of the p100 molecule,
  generating a DNA binding NF-κB complex containing RelB and processed p52.
