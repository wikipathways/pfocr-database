caption: 'Model predictions of the central metabolism inferred from the B42 genome
  sequence. Important energy generating reactions are shown expanded on the lower
  left corner. Carbon derived from methane is either completely oxidized to CO2 (dashed
  line) or is assimilated through the RuMP pathway into the glycolysis and TCA cycle.
  A proposed cellular ultrastructure is shown in the top right. The genome also encodes
  genes to the construction of pili, flagella and for the accumulation of polyphosphate
  and glycogen granules. Abbreviations: G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; G1,5LP, 6-phospho
