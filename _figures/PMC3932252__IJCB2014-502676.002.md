caption: Autophagy is negatively regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 K)/Akt
  signaling pathway, which activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in response
  to growth factors and also phosphorylates Beclin 1. The adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) negatively regulates mTOR thereby acting as a positive regulator
  of autophagy in response to AMP levels. mTOR resides in the mTOR signaling complex
  (mTORC1), which regulates the mammalian uncoordinated-51-like protein kinase (ULK1)
  complex, consisting of ULK1, ATG13, ATG101, and RB1CC1. Autophagy is also regulated
  by the Beclin 1 complex, consisting of Beclin 1, class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (VPS34 or PI3KC3) and ATG14L or UVRAG. Stimulation of the Beclin 1 complex generates
  phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), which triggers autophagosomal nucleation.
  Autophagosome membrane elongation is regulated by ubiquitin-like conjugation systems.
  ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 by ATG7 and ATG10 enzymes, which results in the formation
  of the ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L1 complex. The Atg8 conjugation system involves microtubule-associated
  protein-1 light chain 3 (LC3, ATG8). LC3 and other Atg8 homologues are modified
  with the cellular lipid phosphatidylethanolamine. Pro-LC3 is cleaved by ATG4B to
  generate the LC3-I form. ATG4D may similarly process other Atg8 homologs. Lipid
  conjugation of LC3-I occurs from the action of ATG7 and ATG3 activities. The conversion
  of LC3-I (free form) to LC3-II (lipid-conjugated form) is a major step in autophagosome
  formation. Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins can interact with the autophagy machinery
  at the site of Beclin1, resulting in inhibition of autophagy. The tumor suppressor
  protein p53 and activated caspases potentially interact with the autophagy machinery
  at the indicated sites. Caspase processing can result in activation of autophagy
  (e.g., Atg4D) or inhibition of autophagy (e.g., Beclin 1, Atg3). Additionally, Atg12
  and a cleavage product of Atg5 can act as proapoptotic mediators by antagonizing
  antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins.
