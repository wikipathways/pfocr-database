caption: '(A) The meiotic spindle is initially symmetrical and located in the centre
  of the oocyte. (B) The chromosomes emit a RAN‐GTP gradient and induce CDC42 signalling
  to form the polarized cortex (light pink). CDC42 signalling from the polarized cortex
  induces tyrosinylation of α‐microtubulin (light green microtubules) on the side
  of the spindle closest to the cortex. Microtubules emanating from the spindle pole
  towards the centre of the oocyte remain predominantly detyrosylated (dark blue microtubules).
  (C) Asymmetric positioning of the meiotic spindle is accompanied by a series of
  polarization events that culminate in the formation of the spindle actin cap. cdc42
  can regulate its formation via the N‐WASP–Arp2/3 signalling pathway. (D) The active
  region of CDC42 defines the inner boundary of the RhoA loop and is propelled by
  actin filaments generated by the N‐WASP–Arp2/3 pathway to provide the necessary
  polar body efflux. At this point, the oocyte divides into two daughter cells: the
  secondary oocyte (after the first meiosis) or oocyte (after the second meiosis)
  and the polar body. During meiosis, multiple genes such as ING3, Epsin2, Ptdlns(3,4,5)p3,
  ITSN2 and others are involved in coregulation'
