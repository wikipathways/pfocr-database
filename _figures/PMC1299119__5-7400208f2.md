caption: The complexity of signalling with simple sphingolipids. In lipid signalling
  pathways, an input activates (either directly or indirectly) an enzyme that generates
  a lipid product, which results in an output signal as shown in the insert on the
  left of the figure. In the main panel of the figure, individual inputs (indicated
  by positive numbers when affecting a pathway that leads to ceramide and by negative
  numbers when affecting a pathway that leads away from ceramide) are shown in grey,
  the enzymes they affect are in blue, the lipids generated in black, and the outputs
  in red. Note the large diversity of inputs and the relationships between the different
  lipids generated as illustrated in the insert on the right, which shows what might
  happen if both the substrate and product are signalling lipids. This could give
  rise to diametrically opposed outputs, as indicated by the arrows connecting output
  1 and 2. Note also that a number of other pathways, and other signalling sphingolipids,
  are not shown. Moreover, one input may regulate more than one enzyme, and a particular
  cell may receive more than one input at a time. Therefore, cell responses would
  be best described by the integration of responses to these (and other) pathways,
  which provides significant flexibility (but also complexity). The challenge in this
  field is to superimpose  on  so as to explain how the signalling events in  are
  regulated, modulated and affected by the subcellular localizations at which they
  occur, and how this is regulated temporally. Lipids are shown using the same simplified
  structures as in . Cer kin, ceramide kinase; Cer syn, ceramide synthase; Cer1PPase,
  ceramide-1-phosphate phosphatase; cPLA2, phospholipase A2; EDG receptors, endothelial
  differentiation gene receptors; SM, sphingomyelin; SM syn, SM synthase; SMase, sphingomyelinase
  (of which both neutral and acid act as signalling enzymes); S1PK, sphingosine kinase;
  S1PPase, sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PP2A,
  protein phosphatase 2A; cerase, ceramidase.
