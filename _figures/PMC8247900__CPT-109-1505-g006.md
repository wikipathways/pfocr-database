caption: Scheme of the metabolic pathway of metamizole. Metamizole is non‐enzymatically
  hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to N‐methyl‐4‐aminoantipyrine (4‐MAA),
  which has a high bioavailability. Later on, 4‐MAA is enzymatically oxidized to N‐formyl‐4‐aminoantipyrine
  (4‐FAA) or demethylated to 4‐aminoantipyrine (4‐AA). The 4‐AA can be further acetylated
  by N‐acetyltransferase 2 to N‐acetyl‐4‐aminoantipyrine (4‐AAA).
