caption: a, Organization of the putative thiamin biosynthetic gene cluster and proposed
  thiamin biosynthetic pathway in A. orientalis. *The genes encoding MoeZ and ThiL
  are not found in the gene cluster. The gene encoding the ThiS-activating enzyme,
  ThiF, is also absent in the genome. †Two genes encoding proteins homologous to ThiD
  are found in the gene cluster. b, Organization of the putative molybdopterin biosynthetic
  gene cluster and proposed molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic pathway in A. orientalis.
  *The genes encoding MoeZ and MoeA were not found in the gene cluster. The gene encoding
  the MoaD-activating enzyme, MoeB, is also absent in the genome. c, Organization
  of the putative cysteine biosynthetic gene cluster and proposed cysteine biosynthetic
  pathway in A. orientalis. *The gene encoding MoeZ is not found in the gene cluster.
  d, Organization near the moaD homologue, moaD2, found in the A. orientalis genome.
  e, Organization near moeZ found in the A. orientalis genome and the conserved domains
  of AoMoeZ predicted by BLAST analysis.
