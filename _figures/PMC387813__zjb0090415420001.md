caption: Model of σB activation. σB is held inactive in unstressed B. subtilis as
  a complex with an anti-σB protein, RsbW (W). σB is freed from RsbW when a release
  factor, RsbV (V), binds to RsbW. In unstressed B. subtilis, RsbV is inactive due
  to an RsbW-catalyzed phosphorylation (V-P). Physical stress activates an RsbV-P
  phosphatase, RsbU (U), which reactivates RsbV. RsbT (T) is the RsbU activator. RsbT
  is normally bound to a negative regulator RsbS (S), which inhibits its activity.
  RsbR and a family of related proteins (“R”) also bind to RsbS and RsbT and are believed
  to facilitate their interactions. Upon exposure to stress, RsbT phosphorylates and
  inactivates RsbS then activates the RsbU phosphatase. A ribosome-mediated process
  and Obg, a ribosome-associated GTPase that can bind to RsbT, play essential, but
  unknown roles in the activation of RsbT. RsbS-P is dephosphorylated and reactivated
  by a phosphatase RsbX (X) that is encoded by one of the genes downstream of the
  sigB operon's σB-dependent promoter. RsbX levels become elevated when σB is active,
  which may facilitate a return of RsbT to an inactive complex with RsbS. Energy depletion
  activates a separate pathway in which a novel RsbV-P phosphatase (P) and an associated
  protein (Q) are triggered, by unknown means, to reactivate RsbV. The model is based
  on references (, , , , , , , -, ).
