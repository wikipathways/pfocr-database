caption: A speculative model depicting the regulatory events in the expression of
  rsmA in E. carotovora subsp. carotovora. The basal level of rsmA expression (upper
  pathway) is controlled by several factors, including RpoS and RsmC. Increased pool
  of free ExpR but not ExpR-AHL complex (lower pathway) causes overproduction of RsmA,
  which in turn suppresses exoprotein and antibiotic production and pathogenicity
  by controlling mRNA stability.
