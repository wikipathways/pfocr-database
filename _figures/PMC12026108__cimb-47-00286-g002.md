caption: Molecular function of FGFRL1. FGFRL1 is involved in prenatal and postnatal
  growth of cartilage and osteogenesis and the development of embryonic kidney and
  diaphragm. FGFRL1 plays a role in promoting cell proliferation and cell differentiation.
  FGFRL1 can inhibit cell apoptosis. FGFRL1 promotes ENO1 expression and activates
  the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. FGFRL1 activates the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway
  and increases the downstream target genes (Gli1 and Gli2) expression. At insulin
  secretory granules, SHP-1 phosphatase can directly bind to the SH-2 motif in the
  short intracellular sequence of FGFRL1 and increase ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation
  in a ligand-independent manner. FGFRL1 at the plasma membrane can also bind extracellular
  FGF ligands to elevate ERK1/2 phosphorylation by means of an MEK-independent signaling
  cascade. FGF8/FGFRL1, spred-1, and some other molecules work in concert to control
  growth factor signaling during the development of the kidneys. The Ig2 domain can
  bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) located on the cell surface of the neighboring
  cells and promote cell–cell adhesion. The Ig3 domain and transmembrane domain of
  FGFRL1 can bind the target protein of the adjacent cells and mediate cell fusion
