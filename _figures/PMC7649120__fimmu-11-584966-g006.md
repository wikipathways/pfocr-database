caption: 'Scheme of possible pathways by which liposomes can “hit” PIM cells via C
  activation; example for the case of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) and
  other PEGylated NPs. Liposomes bind anti-PEG antibodies, which activate C via the
  classical pathway (CP). The liberated C cleavage products stimulate a variety of
  innate immune and blood cells (e.g., PIM cells, macrophages, mast cells, basophils,
  granulocytes, platelets) via different receptors, illustrated with color-coded arrows
  and surface shapes for different receptors. These signaling pathways represent CARPA,
  but allergy-mediating phagocytic cells could also be activated without the involvement
  of C (i.e., C-independent pseudoallergy, “CIPA.” Outward arrows show the known secretory
  products that can mediate allergic symptoms. Continuous and dotted lines represent
  known and hypothetical activation mechanisms. Abbreviations: ATR, anaphylatoxin
  receptor; C3b “opsonin pathway,” mediated by C3b, iC3b, and C3d(g) via CR1 (CD35),
  CR2 (CD21), and CR3 (CD11b/CD18) (blue); “C1q-C1qR pathway” (brown); “MBL/ficolin-MBL-R
  pathway” (red); “terminal complement complex (C5b-9) direct stimulation pathway”
  (blue); potential additional stimulation mechanisms include Fc-mediated IgG/IgM
  binding to FcγRIIB (CD32)/FcγR (CD351) (violet); and PEG binding to pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs), e.g., Toll-like receptor 2 and/or 6 and/or other PRR, as a consequence
  of mimicking pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (green). Reproduced
