caption: 'The proposed mixed type of C4 photosynthesis, and its NADPH and ATP requirements
  per CO2 assimilation in mesophyll (M) and bundle‐sheath (BS) cells. The red arrows
  show the Calvin cycle and its cell‐type‐specific NADPH and ATP requirements; the
  blue arrows show the C4cycle, where the full arrows show the cycle in the classically
  defined phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP)‐carboxykinase (CK) subtype (see Supporting Information
  Fig. c; reprinted by permission from Springer Nature, Ishikawa et al., ) and the
  dashed ones show the new components added to form the mixed type. For illustrative
  simplicity, it is assumed that there is no leakiness, that the 3‐phosphoglycerate
  (3‐PGA) reduction of the Calvin cycle occurs in 50% in each of the two cell types,
  and that the PEP‐CK pathway where the PEP generated is converted to pyruvate in
  the BS cells possibly by PEP phosphatase (PP) – the pathway denoted as PEP‐CK(PP)
  in Fig.  – does not occur (for detailed algorithms for energy requirement without
  these assumptions, see Table ). The coefficient a refers to the fraction of OAA
  produced by PEP carboxylation in the M cells that is reduced to malate moving to
  the BS mitochondria where malate decarboxylation generates NADH that will drive
  mitochondrial electron transport to produce ATP. This produces na ATP (where n is
  the ATP : NADH ratio). The coefficient b is the fraction of the second decarboxylation
  category defined in Fig. that belongs to the NADP‐malic enzyme (ME) type. If a = 0
  and b = 1, then the mixed type becomes the NADP‐ME subtype (see Fig. a); if a = 0
  and b = 0, then the mixed type becomes the NAD‐ME subtype (see Fig. b). Another
  special case if a = 0 and b = 0 is a hypothetical ‘pure’ PEP‐CK type, where the
  PEP generated will be converted to pyruvate in the BS cells by pyruvate kinase –
  the pathway denoted as PEP‐CK(PK) in Fig. . Numbers represent enzymes involved in
  the C4cycle: 1, PEP carboxylase (PEPc); 2, NADP‐malate dehydrogenase (NADP‐MDH);
  3, NADP‐ME; 4, pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (PPDK); 5, carbonic anhydrase (CA);
  6, aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT); 7, NAD‐malate dehydrogenase (NAD‐MDH); 8,
  NAD‐ME; 9, alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT); 10, PEP‐CK; 11, pyruvate kinase (PK).
