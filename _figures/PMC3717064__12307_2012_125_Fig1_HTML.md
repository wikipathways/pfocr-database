caption: 'NK cell activating and inhibitory receptors and their downstream signaling
  molecules. Signaling pathways downstream of activating NK cell receptors typically
  lead to NK cell cytotoxic responses and/or cytokine production. Central molecules
  involved in NK cell activation are often downregulated in the tumor microenvironment.
  These molecules include: CD3ζ, an adaptor molecule coupled to several activating
  receptors; contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that
  becomes phosphorylated by Src family kinases upon engagement of activating receptor(s)
  by its ligands; Lck kinase that phosphorylates ITAMs of CD3ζ and FcεRIγ adaptor
  molecules; Syk kinase that is recruited to phosphorylated ITAMs and mediates downstream
  signaling; additional downstream molecules such as Vav, PI3K or PLCγ. Inhibitory
  NK cell receptors contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs)
  and recruit phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHIP upon ligand recognition. These events
  lead to the dephosphorylation of active components downstream of activating receptors
  counteracting NK cell activation. Tumor-associated NK cells often upregulate expression
  of inhibitory receptors that result in an enhanced threshold for NK cell activation.
  The network was generated using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity
