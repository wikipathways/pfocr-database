caption: 'Pathophysiological mechanisms of insulin resistance in the vasculature.
  In pathological conditions: 1. High concentrations of saturated free fatty acids
  in the extracellular milieu impair SERCA pump activity, decreasing luminal Ca2+
  levels in the Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum. 2. This condition triggers the unfolded
  protein response (UPR), involved in the activation of IRE-BIP, whose interaction
  with TRAF induces JNK activation. 3. In addition, high concentrations of saturated
  free fatty acids increase mitochondrial β-Oxidation and the generation of ROS, which
  also favors the activation of JNK. 4. JNK phosphorylates the insulin receptor and
  the IRS on serine residues (pS), blocking the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as a mechanism
  of insulin resistance in blood vessels. The decreased bioavailability of NO levels
  reduces the activity of SERCA pump and BKCa channels indirectly by preventing PKG
  activation, which impairs vasorelaxation. Akt, Protein kinase B; BIP, Binding immunoglobulin
