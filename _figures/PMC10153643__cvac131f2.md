caption: Schematic model detailing how thermogenic adipose tissue activation attenuates
  dyslipidaemia and protects from atherosclerosis development. Activated thermogenic
  adipose tissue (i.e. BAT and browned WAT) burns FAs liberated from intracellular
  lipid droplets for heat production. To replenish intracellular triglyceride stores,
  thermogenic adipose tissue takes up FAs from circulating TRLs after liberation by
  LPL-mediated lipolysis (pathway 1), leaving TRL core remnants and TRL surface remnants,
  mainly phospholipids, in the circulation. The core remnants are then efficiently
  taken up by the liver after binding of ApoE on the particle surface to mainly the
  LDLR on hepatocytes (pathway 2), protein levels of which are regulated by proprotein
  convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), resulting in a reduction in cholesterol-enriched
  lipoproteins and therefore attenuating trapping of lipoproteins in artery walls
  and atherosclerosis progression. The surface remnants are sequestered into HDL to
  improve HDL’s cholesterol efflux-inducing capacity from e.g. macrophages in atherosclerotic
  plaques, with subsequent esterification of the acquired cholesterol by LCAT and
  selective delivery of the cholesteryl esters via SRB1 to hepatocytes (pathway 3),
  which can contribute to the atheroprotective effect of thermogenic adipose tissue
  activation. The uptake of cholesterol-enriched TRL remnants and cholesteryl esters
  from HDL combined leads to the accumulation of cholesterol in the liver, which drives
  cholesterol conversion into bile acids (pathway 4) with increased bile acid excretion
  via faeces (pathway 6), an effect that is attenuated upon prolonged stimulation
  of thermogenesis in adipose tissue due to enhanced bile acid re-uptake via enterohepatic
  circulation (pathway 5). See text for more details.
