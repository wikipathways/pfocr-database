caption: Enzymatic reactions catalyzed by PLD. PLD is associated with membrane receptors
  including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), receptor tyrosine kinases, or integrins,
  which all activate PLD. Shown is GPCR-coupled PLD, which, upon activation under
  physiological conditions, hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC) to produce choline
  and phosphatidic acid (PA), a lipid second messenger that binds and activates several
  signaling molecules including RAF, Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K and stimulates several
  cell functions including proliferation, cell trafficking, and cell survival. The
  PLD signaling pathway is disrupted by ethanol, which competes with water leading
  to the formation of phosphatidylethanol (PEth) at the expenses of phosphatidic acid,
  therefore, inhibiting phosphatidic acid-activated signaling and functions.
