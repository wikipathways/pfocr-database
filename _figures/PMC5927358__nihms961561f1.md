caption: 'The canonical Wnt signaling pathway. (a) In the absence of Wnt binding to
  its receptor (Frizzled) and coreceptor (LRP5/6), β-catenin is phosphorylated by
  its destruction complex and targeted for proteasomal degradation by βTRCP. The Frizzled
  receptor is targeted for proteasomal degradation via the activity of ZNRF3/RNF43.
  (b) Upon release of biologically active Wnt from a neighboring cell by cargo receptor
  Wntless, the Wnt protein binds its receptor and coreceptor, which triggers recruitment
  of the β-catenin destruction complex to the plasma membrane through scaffolding
  protein Dishevelled. This interaction is further stabilized by R-spondin binding
  to an LGR receptor. β-catenin cannot be phosphorylated, accumulates in the cytoplasm,
  and translocates to the nucleus to bind the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors
  to induce target gene transcription. Abbreviations: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli;
  β-cat, β-catenin; βTRCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein; CK1α, casein kinase
  1α; Dvl, Dishevelled; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; LGR, leucine-rich repeat-containing
  G protein–coupled receptor; LRP, lipoprotein receptor-related protein; RNF43, ring
  finger 43; TCF/LEF, T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor; ZNRF3, zinc and ring
  finger 3.'
