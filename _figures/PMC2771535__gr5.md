caption: Brain-Specific Biochemical Pathways Connecting Folate and Choline MetabolismDuring
  the conversion of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) to S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH),
  a methyl group (-CH3) is released. This conversion is the key methyl donor for most
  methylation reactions. SAM is regenerated by the methylation of homocysteine to
  methionine. This reaction is mediated mainly by the methyl-tetrahydrofolate (MTHF)
  to tetrahydrofolate (THF) conversion. Alternatively, the conversion of choline to
  dimethylglycine can deliver the required methyl group to regenerate SAM. In the
  case of folate deficiency, SAM is regenerated mainly by the choline-oxidation pathway,
  leading to a secondary choline deficiency. At equilibrium, more than 90% of the
  cellular choline and myo-inositol are anchored in membranes in the form of phosphatidylcholine
  (PCh) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). However, choline and inositol can be released
  from their membrane anchor and supplied to the cytoplasmic compartment. Thus, choline
  deficiency can result in reduced membrane content of phosphtidylcholine (PCh) and
  might also influence the amount of other phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol
  (PI). During brain development, in particular during myelin formation, the choline
  demand for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PCh) and sphingomyelin (SM) is
  very high, and choline deficiency ultimately results in disturbed myelination that
  may affect the amount and composition of myelin. Note that only free, non-membrane-bound
  choline (and other trimethylamine compounds, such as phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine)
  and free myo-inositol can be detected by proton MRS (C–3E).
