caption: Mechanism of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) action against diabetic vascular endothelial
  disease, diabetic vascular endothelial disease, diabetic peripheral neuropathy,
  and diabetic retinopathy. Illustration of the therapeutic mechanism of AS-IV in
  diabetic vascular disease, cardiomyopathy, retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy.
  In diabetic vascular disease, AS-IV improves vascular endothelial lesions by inhibiting
  the P38 and JNK signaling pathways and reducing inflammation via activation of the
  SUMOylation pathway. Similarly, AS-IV can reduce the expression of Bcl2 and pAKT/AKT
  proteins to protect cardiomyocytes and attenuate the expression of TLR4 in bone
  marrow mesenchymal stem cells through the NF-kB signaling pathway. AS-IV regulates
  the release of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGc-1α)
  and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (nrF 1). In retinopathy, AS-IV mainly inhibits
  ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-kB activation and upregulates the expression of miR-128,
  increasing Bcl-2 protein. AS-IV inhibits diabetic peripheral neuropathy mainly by
  elevating Na+/K + ATPase and protects against neuropathy by inhibiting SIRT1/p53
  signaling
