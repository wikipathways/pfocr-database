caption: Illustration depicting the molecular pathways involved in mast cell recruitment
  to neurofibromas. A neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cell (Nf1–/–) secretes five
  times the normal Kit ligand, which serves as a chemoattractant for mast cells expressing
  c-Kit. Mast cell migration is mediated by the Ras/PI3K/Rac2 signal transduction
  pathway, which is enhanced in Nf1+/– cells. Although not shown, endothelial cells
  also play a role in mast cell migration through the interaction of the endothelial
  cell VCAM-1 receptor and α4β1 integrin of the mast cell. Heterozygous inactivation
  of Nf1 promotes rapid mast cell haptotaxis specifically on α4β1 integrins in response
  to KitL. It is known that mast cells are activated in neurofibromas and degranulate;
  however it is yet to be determined if and how the presence of mast cells induces
  tumor progression. Figure courtesy of D. Wade Clapp, Indiana University School of
  Medicine. KitL, Kit ligand.
