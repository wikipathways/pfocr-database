caption: 'Pathways linking IDO-mediated KYN/TRP mechanism to behavioral changes: ethanol
  induced overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, which activated IDO, especially
  IDO1. TRP’s metabolic pathway was altered when IDO1 was activated, causing a decrease
  of 5-HT, which induced a decrease of the 5-HT/TRP ratio and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio, ultimately
  leading to depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. Meanwhile, most of the TRP was
  metabolized into KYN when IDO1 was activated, which broke the balance of KYN’s metabolic
  pathway. In the normal state, KYN’s metabolite is KA, which is an NMDA antagonist
  and is beneficial to memory function. When IDO1 was activated, most of KYN convert
  to QA, which is an NMDA receptor agonist and is a key contributor to increased neurotoxicity
  and cognitive deficits. These imbalances and behavioral deficits induced by drinking
  were improved by treatment of IDO1 inhibitor 1-MT.'
