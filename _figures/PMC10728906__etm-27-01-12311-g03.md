caption: Inflammatory activation of astrocytes and microglia by α-Syn and phenotypic
  switching between astrocytes and microglia. α-Syn induces the expression of CX3CL1,
  CCL5, IL-6 and TNF-α in astrocytes through the p38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.
  α-Syn aggregates also activate astrocytes and trigger neuroinflammation through
  the JNK and NF-κB signaling pathways. This leads astrocytes to express COX-2, iNOS,
  TNF-α and IL-1β. In microglia, α-Syn activates the MyD88-NF-κB signaling pathway,
  leading microglia to generate proinflammatory factors, including IL-6, IL-1β and
  TNF-α. α-Syn can prime and activate the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to
  the generation of IL-18 and IL-1β by microglia. Exosomal α-Syn suppresses autophagy
  in microglia through activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which leads to
  accelerated extracellular α-Syn secretion and increased intracellular α-Syn accumulation.
  These inflammatory responses induced by α-Syn are conducive to DA neuronal death.
  α-Syn PFFs activate microglia into the M1 phenotype, which in turn induces astrocytes
  to develop into a neurotoxic A1 phenotype. The inflammatory responses in astrocytes
  are also capable of converting microglia into an M1-like phenotype. α-Syn, α-synuclein;
