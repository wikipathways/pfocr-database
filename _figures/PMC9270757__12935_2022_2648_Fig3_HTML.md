caption: The mutual roles of DNA methylation and lncRNAs for tumor progression in
  gastric cancer. As shown on the right, abnormal DNA methylation regulates the expression
  of lncRNAs as tumor suppressor genes in gastric cancer. LncRNA Uc.160+ and lncRNA
  linc00086 are hypermethylated in GC cells via, respectively, evoking Src/MEK/ERK
  and p38 pathway and regulating MeCP2 by ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Uc.160+ could
  contribute to the repression of PTEN expression, and MAPK signaling pathway could
  bring about the inactivation of RUNX3 via evoking Src/MEK/ERK and p38 pathway. SPRY4-IT1
  is hypermethylated in GC cells resulting in tumor progression due to the EMT attributed
  to decrease of E-cadherin and increase of Vimentin. C5orf66-AS1 is hypermethylated
  in GCA tissues and cell lines, which is associated with its lower expression possibly
  through abrogating Sp1 binding. LncRNA MEG3, lncRNA AFDN-DT, and LOC100130476 are
  hypermethylated in GC. Their endings are shown in the figure. On the other side,
  lncRNAs regulate the abnormal DNA methylation of tumor-related genes in gastric
  cancer. The PLZF is hypermethylated through regulation of LncRNA ANRIL remarkably
  in GC tissues and cell lines, and the progression derives from EMT that is negatively
  correlated with E-cadherin but positively with Vimentin and N-cadherin. MED18 is
  hypermethylated through regulation of lncRNA SNHG3 by binding to EZH2. PCDH10 is
  hypermethylated by lncRNA HOTAIR through interacting with miR-148 and DNMT1 in GC.
  ACOT7 was hypermethylated by lncRNA NMRAL2P through binding to DNMT3b in GC cells.
  LncRNA LUCAT1 induces hypermethylation of CXXC4 which can regulate Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling closely related to the development and progression of GC. LncRNA HOTTIP
  enabled HoxA13 to be hypermethylated and it can be the target of HoxA13 reversely.
  And IGFBP-3 could interact with HoxA13 as its downstream target in GC and can be
  modulated by p53 pathway. LncRNA AK058003 is upregulated by hypoxia and regulate
  the hypomethylation of SNCG. Similar to AK058003, lncRNA AK123702 is also upregulated
  by hypoxia and capable of regulating the hypomethylation of EGFR in GC cells. Their
  endings are shown in the figure
