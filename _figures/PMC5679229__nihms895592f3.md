caption: 'NO, in the presence of oxygen postranslationally modifies proteins via S-nitrosation.
  S-nitrosation can lead to either enhanced or repressed metabolic pathway activity.
  Excess NO inactivates antioxidant GSH, which leads to build up of ROS and subsequently
  induces HIF-1α. HIF-1α initiates a signaling cascade that regulates glycolytic enzymes
  such as HK, LDH and MCT. NO inhibits the electron transport chain activity and subsequently
  mitochondrial respiration by interacting with complex IV. NO enhances lipid metabolism
  by inhibiting ACO and upregulating FASN to redirect citrate into lipogenic acetyl-CoA.
  NO also affects TCA cycle fluxes by increasing GLS activity, which enhances glutamine
  utilization by the TCA cycle.ROS, Reactive oxygen species; GSH, glutathione; GSSG,
  reduced glutathione; HIF, hypoxia inducible factor; GLUT4, Glucose transporter type
