caption: 'L-arginine (L-Arg) is present in the circulation at >100 times the concentrations
  of the free endogenous methylarginines: asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric
  dimethylarginine (SDMA). ADMA but not SDMA inhibits all three isoforms of nitric
  oxide synthase (NOS), decreasing the production of nitric oxide. L-arginine and
  the free methylarginines are thought to enter the cell (shown on the left) through
  the y+ transporter. ADMA and SDMA are generated intracellularly following the methylation,
  by protein-arginine methyltransferases (PRMT), and subsequent proteolysis, of constituent
  protein arginine residues. ADMA can regulate protein expression through both NO-dependent
  and –independent pathways. ADMA but not SDMA is hydrolysed by DDAH to form dimethylamine
  (DMA) and L-citrulline (L-Cit), which can be reincorporated into proteins. The majority
  of ADMA is metabolised by DDAHs with the product DMA excreted in the urine whereas
  SDMA is excreted intact. Both SDMA and ADMA are substrates for AGXT2, which is expressed
  only in kidney (right) and liver (not shown), leading to the formation of, respectively,
  symmetrical and asymmetrical, dimethylguanidino valeric acid (DGV) that is also
  excreted in the urine. Dotted arrows show metabolic pathways for which limited in
  vivo evidence is available. Acetylation of ADMA has also been described but is not
  shown. Monomethylarginine (not shown for clarity) is thought to have a similar actions,
  distribution, and degradation pathway to ADMA.'
