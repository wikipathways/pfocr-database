caption: PARPi effect in cancer cells and immune cells. Depicted in green are effects
  that are promoted by PARPi treatment, and effects that are inhibited by PARPi treatment
  are shown in red. (A) Synthetic lethality interaction of homologous recombination
  (HR)-deficient cancer cells and PARPi treatment leads to cancer cell death. (B)
  PARPi treatment also inhibits ADP-ribosylation of cGAS in cancer cells, thereby
  enhancing the cGAS/STING signaling pathway. (C) In macrophages, PARPi elevate levels
  of NAD+ and ROS. This shift in metabolism enhances the anti-tumorigenic function
  of macrophages. (D–G) PARPi up- and downregulate the transcription of various cytokines
  in both macrophages and T cells. (H) In cancer cells, PARPi treatment upregulates
  PD-L1 expression, which may have implications for the interaction between cancer
  cells and the immune system
