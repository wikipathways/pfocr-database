caption: 'Schematic representation of three recurrent mechanisms of resistance to
  targeted therapies. RTK: receptor tyrosine kinase. STK: serine/threonine kinase.
  (a) Alterations of the drug target, e.g. mutation, amplification or splice variants.
  (b) Pathway reactivation through (1) RTK activation or (2) mutation or amplification
  of an upstream component or (3) by mutation or amplification of a downstream component.
  (c) Bypass by parallel pathway activation through (1) activation of a second RTK
  (by itself or through feedback regulation) or (2) mutation of a parallel STK.'
