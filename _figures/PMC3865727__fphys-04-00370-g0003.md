caption: Cancer cells express proton-sensing GPCRs such as GPR4, TDAG8, and OGR1 to
  regulate their tumorigenesis and invasion. TDAG8 and OGR1 sense extracellular protons,
  leading to activation of the cAMP signaling pathway. OGR1 is usually coupled with
  the PLC/Ca2+pathway through Gq/11 proteins and GPR4 and TDAG8 are coupled with the
  adenylyl cyclase/cAMP pathway through Gs proteins in the cells to PKA and ERK signaling
  pathway that play pivotal roles in cancer progression.
