  their targets gathered from different data sources (). (b) Key genes with robust
  bio-signatures and key regulatory effects in response to E. coli (Table 2). (c)
  Diseases or biological processes functionally related to mastitis identified by
  using the Pathway Studio web tool (). (d) Drugs and antibiotics relevant to E. coli
  mastitis gathered by literature mining (Table 3). (e) A suitable heterogeneous network
  constructed by integration of data from parts A, B, C, D (f) Running the Heter-LP
  algorithm on the constructed network to predict important relations involved in
  mastitis (described in ). (g) Predicted drugs, ranked according to their score computed
  by Heter-LP (Table 4 and ).
