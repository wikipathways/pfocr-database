caption: 'Schematic representation of the catalytic-dependent and -independent features
  of UCK2 and the therapeutic potential of UCK2 in cancer treatment. (A) As a rate-limiting
  enzyme of the pyrimidine salvage synthesis pathway, UCK2 phosphorylates uridine
  and cytidine to uridine monophosphate (UMP) and cytidine monophosphate (CMP), respectively.
  (B) UCK2 can activate the STAT3-MMP2/9 axis to promote tumor cell proliferation
  and metastasis, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This non-catalytic
  function of UCK2 can be inhibited by a STAT3 inhibitor, WP1066. (C) By inhibiting
  EGF-induced EGFR ubiquitination and degradation, UCK2 can activate EGFR-AKT pathway
  to promote tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. This non-catalytic function
  of UCK2 can be inhibited by EGFR inhibitors: erlotinib and gefitinib. (D) UCK2 can
  be utilized to catalyze cytotoxic ribonucleoside analogs, such as TAS-106 and RX-3117,
  for cancer chemotherapy.'
