caption: The tetraacetlyphytosphingosine (TAPS) biosynthetic pathway in W. ciferrii.
  The serine-palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex composed of Lcb1, Lcb2, and Tsc3 catalyzes
  the first condensation reaction, between serine and palmitoyl-CoA, to produce 3-keto-sphinganine.
  The next step is mediated by 3-keto-sphinganine reductase (Tsc10) and yields sphinganine.
  Sphinganine C-4-hydroxylase (Syr2) adds a hydroxyl group to sphinganine to produce
  phytosphingosine. Sphingoid base N-/O-position acetyltransferase (Sli1p) and O-position
  acetyltransferase (Atf2p) are sequentially involved in acetylation reactions and
  produce TAPS (the final acetylated moiety is highlighted in red) as a final product.
  Three compounds (triacetyl sphinganine, sphinganine-1-P, and phytosphingosine-1-P)
  are destined for other metabolic pathways.
