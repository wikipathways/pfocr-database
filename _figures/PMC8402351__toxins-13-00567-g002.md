caption: Intracellular MAPK signaling pathways activated under extracellular signaling
  and StII action. Membrane perturbation induced by various stimuli provokes the activation
  of the MAPKs cascade. The targets of MAPKs in the cytosol and nucleus are responsible
  for the biological response leading to cell survival or death. Pore formation by
  StII induces ERK1/2 activation through MEK1/2 pathway. In normal BHK cells, the
  inhibition of ERK1/2 increases cell death, suggesting their involvement in cellular
  defense []. However, the ERK1/2 activation in tumor Raji cells is related to cellular
  death []. Pore formation by StII causes K+ efflux through the StII’s pore and an
  increase in intracellular Ca2+ from the external medium and ER []. As a result,
  MAP3K activation takes place, eliciting p38 phosphorylation. The activation of p38
  kinase is associated with cell survival in BHK [] and P3X63Ag cells (unpublished
  results). * Indicates those processes in which the intervention of StII has been
  identified.
