caption: 'Role of the AhR in modulating adaptive immune responses. This figure illustrates
  how the activation of the AhR by chemical ligands can influence the differentiation
  of CD4-positive T cells (CD4+ T cells) into T helper 17 cells (Th17) or regulatory
  T cells (Treg). Through its interaction with different cytokine environments, AhR
  modulates the expression of key transcription factors: RAR-related orphan receptor
  gamma T (RORγT), promoting interleukin-17 (IL-17) production and pro-inflammatory
  responses, or Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), promoting interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming
  growth factor-beta (TGF-β) production and immunosuppressive functions. These pathways
  impact tissue responses, including chemokine production, neutrophil recruitment,
  and the suppression of T cell activity, highlighting AhR’s critical role in immune
  homeostasis and cancer-related immune dysregulation'
