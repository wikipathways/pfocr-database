caption: The molecular mechanism of apoptosis. Classic regulatory pathways of apoptosis
  include extrinsic pathway and intrinsic pathway. Intrinsic pathway is mitochondria
  dependent and regulated by BCL2 protein family which can influence the release of
  cytochrome C from the mitochondria. Cytochrome c can bind to the cytosolic protein
  Apaf-1 and promote the formation of an apoptosome to recruit and activate caspase-9,
  which in turn activates caspase-3 and leads to cell apoptosis. Extrinsic pathway
  is initiated by the transmission of death signals from the cell’s surface through
  the binding of ligands and the death receptors, resulting in the aggregation and
  recruitment of initiator caspases that subsequently activates executioner caspase
  3, leading to apoptosis.
