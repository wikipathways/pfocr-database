caption: FAs, derived from the plasma-free FA pool, from uptake of circulating lipoproteins
  (chylomicron remnants), and from de novo hepatic lipogenesis, are esterified via
  fatty acyl CoA to diacylglyceride (DAG) derivatives and subsequently into TG droplets
  by diacylglycerol acyl transferase 1 (DGAT1). Lipogenic enzyme expression is regulated
  by transcription factors including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c
  (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate response element–binding protein (ChREBP), which can
  be induced in the hyperinsulinemic environment. Mttp gene expression is regulated
  by FoxO1 as described in the study in this issue of the JCI by Kamagate et al. ().
  Insulin acts by binding to its receptor, and activation of the receptor tyrosine
  kinase, which leads to multiple tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS and subsequent activation
  of PI3K to produce PIP3. PIP3, in turn, activates phosphoinositide-dependent kinases
  (PDKs), which phosphorylate and activate Akt, leading to phosphorylation and nuclear
  exclusion of FoxO1. ER membrane–localized apoB and Mttp mRNAs generate corresponding
  proteins through translation on ribosomes into the rough ER lumen. Active MTP, in
  complex with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), transfers lipids (yellow), including
  phospholipids, to stabilize nascent apoB during translation, thereby leading to
  the formation of an emulsion of apoB and lipid in pre-VLDL particles. Cytosolic
  TG droplets are lipolyzed by TG hydrolases (TGHs), resulting in the release of diacylglyceride
  and FAs, which are then esterified by DGAT2 to form TG in close association with
  ER membranes. Pre-VLDL particles fuse with luminal TG droplets, also formed by MTP
  activity, to form large VLDL particles. Insulin is believed to block VLDL assembly
  in a post-ER compartment at the fusion stage, possibly through a mechanism involving
  PI3K-generated PIP3. VLDL particles move through the secretory pathway, where additional
  remodeling may occur, and are eventually secreted into plasma. Failure of pre-VLDL
  apoB to attain a proper conformation and to successfully fuse with TG results in
  the shunting of defective particles (dotted arrow) to autophagolysosomes, the presumptive
  degradation compartment.
