caption: A model for regulation of axonal protein synthesis by miRNA in regeneration.
  The illustration depicts neuronal cell body, axon varicosity and the growth cone.
  Pri-miRNA is transcribed in the nucleus and transported to cytoplasm as pre-miRNA.
  In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNA is processed by Dicer/TRBP complex into mature miRNA,
  which is loaded onto RISC. RISC is a nucleoprotein complex, which may be transported
  to distal regions of neuron including the growth cone. In the growth cone RISC may
  regulate protein translation by silencing specific mRNAs and causing translational
  repression. The repressed mRNAs may translocate into P-body, a specific foci, primarily
  localized to axon varicosities. Axon varicosity is a place of organelle accumulation
  (Bennett and Muschol, ), clustering of excess growth resources (Malkinson and Spira,
  ), mRNA concentration (Lee and Hollenbeck, ), and P-body accumulation (Wu et al.,
  ). The P-body machinery localized to varicosities may regulate the growth resources
  by managing mRNAs pool. In P-body, mRNAs targeted for destruction are associated
  with decapping enzymes Dcp1 and Dcp2, as well as GW182. Translationally repressed
  mRNA might be also stored in P-body. Upon changes in cellular conditions and stimuli,
  some of the stored mRNAs can re-enter the translation pathway (Rana, ).
