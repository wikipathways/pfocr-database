caption: Illustration of molecular pathway for significantly associated single nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNP) loci in the metabolic syndrome genome-wide association study
  (GWAS). The molecules depicted by the significant GWAS loci (reds), functional SNPs
  (expression quantitative trait loci or nonsynonymous SNPs) loci (green), and the
  other intermediate molecules (yellow) are illustrated on the cell organelles.
