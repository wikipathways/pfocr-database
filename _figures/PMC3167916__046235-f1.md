caption: Model of the interactions between the V. cholerae quorum-sensing network
  and the VarS/VarA pathway. The previously described pathway is represented by the
  dotted arrow and the pathway described in this study is depicted with a dashed arrow;
  qrr sRNAs, quorum-regulatory small regulatory RNAs.
