caption: COVID infection and NF-κB signaling. This putative pathway suggests that
  coronaviruses are able to cause inflammation in human brain through nuclear factor
  kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent signaling. Binding of viral SARS-CoV to its receptors,
  such as CD147, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the help of the transmembrane
  serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), allows SARS-CoV to enter into host cells through cleaving/activating
  of viral envelope glycoproteins. Within the endosomes, viral single-stranded RNA
  virus activates the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/8.
  These receptors activate IKK which results in phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic
  inhibitor factor IκBα, which in turn leads to phosphorylation of IκBα, and subsequent
  degradation. As a result, NF-κB p50 and p65 are released from IκBα and translocate
  from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to induce transcription of various genes coding
  for pro-inflammatory proteins such as cytokines and chemokines. Activated NF-κB
  is associated with a variety of cytokine receptor- and TLR-mediated signal cascades,
  including binding of TNFα or IL-1 to their receptors. Excessive NF-κB activation
  triggers production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a chemokine storm. T cells
  such as CD4 and CD8 are then activated at the site of infection by cytokines and
  a chemokine storm and promote further inflammation. Additionally, dendritic cells
  trigger adaptive immunity. This figure was developed using the BioRender online
  software tool
