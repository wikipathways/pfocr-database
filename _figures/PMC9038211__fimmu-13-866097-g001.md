caption: Schematic representation of canonical and non-canonical pathways involved
  in extracellular adenosine formation in airway cells. Classically, extracellular
  adenosine is generated mainly via the dephosphorylation of ATP, ADP and AMP by the
  action of a series of ecto-enzymes. An alternative source of adenosine is the second
  messenger cAMP. In this scenario, intracellular cAMP synthetized by adenylyl cyclases
  can be transported to the extracellular compartment and sequentially metabolized
  into AMP and adenosine by ecto-PDE and CD73, respectively. Increased concentrations
  of adenosine activate adenosine receptors coupled to Gs or Gi proteins, which in
  turn regulates the activity of adenylyl cyclases leading to an increase or decrease
  in cAMP concentrations and stimulation of downstream effectors. AC, adenylyl cyclases;
  Gs, stimulatory G protein; Gi, inhibitory G protein; PDE, phosphodiesterase; PKA,
  cAMP-dependent protein kinase; EPAC, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP;
  CD39, NTPDase-1; CD73, ecto-5’-nucleotidases and Ecto-PDE, ecto-phosphodiesterase.
