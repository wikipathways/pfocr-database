caption: As reviewed in  and , DHA has multiple-reported neuroprotective and anti-Aβ
  effects. These include reducing Aβ production by increasing SorLA/ LR11, and non-amyloidogenic
  processing of amyloid precursor and decreasing γ-secretase. Aβ clearance may be
  improved by induction of transthyretin or IDE. The DHA metabolite NPD1 can also
  be neuroprotective by reducing pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad. Further, DHA
  increases in PS and PDK/AKT docking will potentiate neuroprotective trophic factor
  signaling through insulin, IGF1, BDNF, and other trophic factors. BDNF itself is
  induced by DHA. Downstream from AKT, there are anti-apoptotic effects on Bad and
  caspases, and up-regulation of the Nrf2 pathway to ARE and antioxidant defense enzymes.
  Further, the major tau kinase GSK3 will be inhibited, limiting tau/ tangles, which
  may also contribute to reduced Aβ production. Finally, one in vivo report found
  DHA limited activation of another tau kinase (JNK) and accumulation of tau pathology
