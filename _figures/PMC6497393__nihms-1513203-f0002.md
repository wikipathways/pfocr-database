caption: Non-oxidative and oxidative pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. A. The non-oxidative
  pathway of glycolysis. Glucose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate (glucose-6-P)
  which may be used as a substrate in the pentose phosphate pathway for pyrimidine
  synthesis, or continue down glycolysis to be converted to pyruvate. Lactate may
  be formed from pyruvate under anaerobic conditions. Dietary fructose is converted
  to fructose-1-phosphate, which then enters glycolysis through production of dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (DHAP). B. Pyruvate enters the oxidative steps of the tricarboxylic acid
  cycle (TCA) to produce acetyl CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase or oxaloacetate through
  pyruvate carboxylase.
