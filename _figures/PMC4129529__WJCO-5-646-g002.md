caption: Major mechanisms of epidermal growth factor receptor resistance to epidermal
  growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer cell. Secondary
  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation prevents binding of first-generation
  EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including gefitinib and erlotinib to EGFR,
  resulting in cancer cell survival (A). Afatinib inhibits the ATP-binding site of
  the tyrosine kinase associated with EGFR T790M, leading to apoptosis of cancer cell.
  MET amplification has been shown to confer resistance to EGFR-TKIs by activating
  phosphorylation of ErbB3 with activating of the PI3K/AKT pathway, resulting in cancer
  cell survival (B).
