caption: A model of adiponectin-induced subcellular translocation of LKB1 in muscle
  cells. A, Under basal conditions, PP2A is inactive and dissociated from APPL1, leading
  to activation of PKCζ in cytosol. The activated PKCζ phosphorylates LKB1 at Ser307,
  which promotes LKB1 transporting into the nuclei. B, Adiponectin stimulation induces
  recruitment of both PP2A and PKCζ onto APPL1, leading to activation of PP2A and
  subsequent dephosphorylation of PKCζ by PP2A. The inactivated PKCζ then results
  in less phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser307 and an accumulation of LKB1 in the cytosol,
  which leads to the binding of LKB1 with APPL1 and activation of AMPK. A hypothetical
  nuclear phosphatase (X) may also contribute to LKB1 cytosolic translocation in response
  to adiponectin or metformin response. AdipoR, Adiponectin receptor.
