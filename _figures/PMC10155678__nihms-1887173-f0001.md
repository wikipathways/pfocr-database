caption: Diagrammatic representation of a taste bud containing representative taste
  cells on the right, and the LPS transduction pathway on the left. Briefly, LPS binds
  its receptor (TLR4) located on the taste cell membrane, which activates an intracellular
  signaling pathway ultimately involving formation of NF-κB. NF-κB enters the nucleus
  and binds the promoter region of the iNOS gene to initiate transcription and production
  of iNOS protein. Nitric oxide (NO) gas then diffuses toward the apical membrane
  of the taste bud to modulate taste receptor signaling and cause taste dysfunction.
  The same intracellular signaling pathway is also activated by viruses, including
  COVID-19, but using different receptor mechanisms. Illustration by Dr. Courtney
  Wilson.
