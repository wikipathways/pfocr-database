caption: '(A) A model for the control of wing growth by Wg. Initiation (top): the
  main phase of wing growth begins with segregation of the wing disc into D-V compartments
  and the induction of specialized border cells (dark blue) by DSL-Notch signaling
  (mint green): Notch activity drives expression of both the morphogen Wg (dark green)
  as well as Boundary enhancer (BE) dependent expression of the wing selector gene
  vg. As detailed in (B), Vg activity up-regulates Ft signaling (blue) at the expense
  of Ds signaling (red) to generate the feed-forward (FF) signal. The FF signal then
  acts together with Wg to induce Quadrant enhancer (QE) expression of vg in non-wing
  cells (red), initiating a stable circuit of Wg-dependent vg expression that recruits
  the responding non-wing cell (yellow) into the wing primordium. Early propagation
  (middle): Vg activity in newly recruited wing cells (turquoise) generates new FF
  signal, which acts together with Wg secreted by border cells to induce QE-dependent
  vg expression in neighboring non-wing cells. It also leads to the production of
  an additional “growth” signal (orange arrows) that promotes proliferation of the
  surrounding population of non-wing cells from which new wing cells will be recruited.
  As shown to the right, Vg activity and FF signaling comprise an auto-regulatory
  cycle driven by Wg. Each turn of the cycle corresponds to the recruitment of a non-wing
  cell into the wing primordium and generates a new, non-wing cell for subsequent
  recruitment. Late propagation (bottom): The wing primordium increases in size, propelled
  by propagation of the FF recruitment cycle and proliferation of cells within and
  around the primordium, both fueled by Wg as it spreads from D-V border cells. FF
  forward propagation also depends on Dpp spreading from border cells along the A-P
  compartment boundary, which acts together with Wg to promote the outward growth
  of the wing primordium from the intersection between the D-V and A-P compartment
  boundaries (not depicted; ). (B) The feed-forward circuit. Top: the signaling activities
  of Wg, Ft, and Ds as well as the transducing activities of D, Wts, and Yki are shown
  relative to vg transcription, and the recruitment of non-wing cells into the wing
  primordium (recruitment propagates from left to right, coloring as in A). Away from
  the recruitment interface, Ft and Ds signaling activities are weakly graded or flat,
  D and Yki activities are low, and Wts activity is high. At the recruitment interface,
  Ft and Ds signaling activities are steeply graded and opposite, generating a transient
  pulse in D activity, a dip in Wts activity, and a burst of Yki activity. Middle:
  Wg, Ft, and Ds signals are shown as green, blue, and red arrows. Only the cell undergoing
  recruitment (yellow) receives both Wg as well as steep and opposing Ft and Ds signals.
  Bottom: the regulatory circuits underlying the wing (vg ON; left) and non-wing (vg
  OFF; right) states as well as the transition that occurs during recruitment (vg
  OFF to vg ON; middle) are diagrammed relative to the landscapes of Wg, Ft, and Ds
  signaling upon which they depend. In wing cells, Wg input acts together with Vg
  to drive a positive auto-regulatory circuit of vg expression mediated by the Quadrant
  Enhancer (QE), and Vg up-regulates the expression of Fj while repressing that of
  Ds to enhance Ft signaling at the expense of Ds signaling (blue arrow). In non-wing
  cells, both the absence of Vg as well as the low level of nuclear Yki lead, by default,
  to low levels of Fj and high levels of Ds, enhancing Ds signaling at the expense
  of Ft signaling (red arrow). The box underneath each cell depicts the level and
  asymmetry of Ft and Ds inputs received from abutting cells on either side. Relatively
  uniform inputs (depicted by parallel lines in the boxes under wing and non-wing
  cells) cause modest, or no, polarization of the transducing activities of both proteins
  within each cell, suppressing the capacity of D to inhibit Wts activity and elevate
  nuclear import of Yki. Conversely, steep and opposite inputs (depicted by crossing
  lines in the box beneath the cell undergoing recruitment) cause a strong polarization,
  allowing D to inhibit Wts activity and induce a burst of Yki nuclear activity. Both
  Yki and Vg activate vg transcription via the QE by functioning as transcriptional
  co-activators for the same DNA binding protein, Sd (not depicted). Hence, as the
  level of Vg rises in cells undergoing recruitment, Vg can substitute for Yki to
  generate a stable circuit of Wg-dependent Vg auto-regulation that no longer requires
  Yki or FF input. Note that the depictions of vg expression, as well as of Ft and
  Ds signaling, as uniform away from the recruitment interface are simplifications.
  Instead, vg expression is weakly graded within the wing primordium in response to
  graded Wg signal, and the complementary patterns of fj and ds, upon which the signaling
  activities of Ft and Ds depend, are similarly graded. The resulting shallow differentials
  of Ft and Ds signaling may suffice to polarize cells in the plane of the epithelium
  (PCP). Nevertheless, the expression profiles of all three genes show a dramatic
  increase in steepness at the periphery of the wing primordium, and it is the resulting
  steepness in opposing Ds and Ft signals that we posit is essential to induce the
  burst of Yki nuclear activity upon which recruitment depends.'
