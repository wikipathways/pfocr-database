caption: The complex interplay between cells, inflammatory factors, AGEs and RAGE
  leading to elevated fracture risk in diabetes. Diabetes reduces osteoblast production
  while promoting myeloid skewing from hematopoietic stem cells, notably via RAGE
  signaling, favoring the production of osteoclast precursors. RAGE initiates a self-sustaining
  pro-inflammatory response which promotes differentiation of osteoclast precursors
  into fully mature osteoclasts that express high levels of RAGE. Osteoclast differentiation
  is further facilitated by RANKL up-regulation, initiating osteoclast maturation
  signals when interacting with RANK, which is promoted by RAGE signaling from osteocytes
  and osteoblasts. However (see text for details), AGEs can also negatively affect
  osteoclast maturation via RAGE-independent mechanisms. In contrast, the Wnt pathway
  is inhibited either directly by RAGE signaling or by its upregulation of sclerostin
  produced by osteocytes, therefore provoking an imbalance in favor of bone matrix
  degradation. Glycation of the organic matrix itself leads to structural changes
  such as matrix stiffening, increasing brittle fracture risks and impairing bone
  remodeling.
