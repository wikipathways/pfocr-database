caption: Spleen regulatory networks. Gene networks altered by TBI in the spleen are
  depicted in this figure. On the left C vs T is the gene expression in these networks
  when comparing the control and TBI gene expression showing activation of inflammatory
  pathways TGFB1, IL19, and IL37. BCL2 is activated, likely in response to the impact
  of the brain injury as a compensatory process in the spleen. NUPR1 is a transcriptional
  cofactor involved in apoptosis and is reciprocally inhibited by TBI. In the right
  panel C vs TE, it is shown that exosome treatment returns NUPR1 expression back
  towards control levels. Also of interest is a predicted regulation of these networks
  by beta-estradiol activation following TBI, which is inhibited following exosome
  treatment. A number of genes related to this pathway are the inflammatory changes
  and also mir-322 which is responsive to hypoxia and oxidative stress []. Beta-estradiol
  is known to play a role in splenic response to injury by modulating macrophage and
  dendritic cell function
