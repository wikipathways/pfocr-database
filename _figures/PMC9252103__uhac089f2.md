caption: ABA signaling in A. thaliana and strawberry fruit. a Model of ABA signaling
  pathway in A. thaliana. The PYR/PYL/RCAR-PP2C-SnRK2 signaling module is conserved
  in land plants [, ]. There are 14 Pyr1 and Pyl1-Pyl13 genes in the Arabidopsis genome.
  Their proteins change conformation when they perceive ABA and bind to group A type
  2 C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs, which negatively regulate ABA signaling. This leads
  to activation (de-repression) of downstream genes encoding SnRK2 kinases, resulting
  in the upregulation of transcription factors, ion channels, etc. [, ]. b ABA signaling
  pathways involved in strawberry fruit ripening. Based on current reports, there
  are two ABA signaling pathways, including ABA-PYR-PP2C plus others and ABA-CHLH/ABAR
  plus others, that participate in regulating strawberry fruit ripening [, , –]. Different
  SnRK2 kinases can play contrasting roles in the ABA signaling pathway. For example,
  FaSnRK2.6 negatively regulates strawberry fruit ripening, whereas AtSnRK2s play
  a positive role in the ABA signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. Additionally, when
  ABA signaling is blocked, a feedback loop is activated, which upregulates NCED expression
  to enhance ABA accumulation in strawberry fruit. The red and blue arrows and green
  line terminating in a rectangle represent activation, biosynthesis, and inhibition,
