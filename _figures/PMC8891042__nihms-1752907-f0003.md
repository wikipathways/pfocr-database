caption: Label incorporation from feeedstocks [1-13C] acetate (A), [1-13C] propionate
  (P), [methyl-13C] methionine (M), and [1-15N] glutamate (G) are shown. Ions depicted
  as circles correspond to adducts and fragments of erythrochelin (7). Ions depicted
  as diamond shapes correspond to adducts and fragments of different intermediate
  compounds in the erythromycin biosynthetic pathway. (a) SIL incorporation and expected
  labeled positions in the structure of 7. (b) SIL incorporation and expected labeled
  positions of the erythromycin biosynthetic precursors, erythronilide B (2) and O-α-mycarosylerythronolide
  B (3). (c) SIL incorporation in erythromycin A (1), B (4), C (5), and D (6).
