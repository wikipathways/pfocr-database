caption: Possible mechanism for targeting Pre-RC to eliminate cancer cells via inhibiting
  the cancer stemness. Common anti-cancer treatments block one signal transduction
  pathway to inhibit downstream biological events, including cell proliferation, invasion,
  and migration. However, cunning tumor cells can trigger cancer recurrence and metastasis
  by enhancing the transduction of other signaling pathways. Targeting the replication
  licensing process specifically, which is the foundation for all biological functions,
  could eradicate cancer thoroughly.
