caption: Rickettsia conorii and R. montanensis trigger a differential metabolic signature
  in THP-1 macrophages. (A,B) Prediction model of alterations in host cell metabolism,
  based on changes in the abundance of host proteins induced by infection of THP-1
  macrophages with R. conorii (A) or R. montanensis (B) Increase/decrease in the abundance
  of host enzymes are predicted to contribute with increase/decrease in activity for
  the respective biological enzymatic activity and are represented in red and blue,
  respectively. Enzymes quantified in our analysis but with no alteration in abundance
  upon infection are represented in black (A) In R. conorii-infected THP-1 macrophages,
  glycolysis (i) and pentose phosphate pathway (ii) are predicted to be reduced at
  24 h post-infection. This may impact pyruvate production from glycolysis as well
  as production of riboses, nucleotides and ROS from PPP, globally contributing to
  reduce pro-inflammatory signals. Several TCA cycle enzymes (iii) were found overrepresented
  upon infection, suggesting an increase in TCA cycle activity. Acetyl-CoA production
  from fatty-acid β-oxidation (iv) and glutamine anaplerosis (v) may contribute to
  replenish the TCA cycle which may result in a sustained ATP production via oxidative
  phosphorylation (vi). Accumulation of several inner and outer membrane transporters
  is suggestive of a metabolic configuration with higher needs in metabolic supply
  and demand. (B) In R. montanensis-infected THP-1 macrophages, pyruvate production
  from glycolysis (i) is also predicted to be reduced at this time of infection. However,
  in contrast with R. conorii, unchanged levels of enzymes of the TCA cycle (iii),
  fatty-acid β-oxidation (iv), glutaminolysis (v), and proteins from the respiratory
  complex (vi) found in R. montanensis-infected cells, together with no alterations
  observed in most of the quantified mitochondrial transporters, suggests very distinct
  metabolic requirements between infection conditions (see ,  for details).
