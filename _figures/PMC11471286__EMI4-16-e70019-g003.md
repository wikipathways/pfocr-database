caption: Sulphate reduction at low pH by aSRB with different electron donors and implications
  on sulphide and proton generation. (1) Organic electron donors occur in their protonated
  form outside the cell (pH <3.0). When transported intracellularly, they dissociate
  at the circumneutral pH of the cytoplasm (pH ~ 6.0), releasing protons. Once inside,
  organic electron donors are oxidized completely or incompletely to obtain electrons
  for sulphate reduction. (2) Inorganic electron donors such as H2 use hydrogenase
  and c3‐type cytochrome‐Hmc‐Qcr complexes to transfer the electrons for sulphate
  reduction. (3) Sulphate reduction could be performed by a common (6‐electron transfer)
  or by an alternative trithionate pathway (three 2‐electron transfer steps), resulting
  in the release of HS− outside the cell. (4) H2S is the predominant species outside
  the cell due to the external pH (<3), allowing it to react with metals to produce
  poorly‐soluble metal sulphides (MeS). (5) Intracellular H2S is toxic as it can react
  with iron present in ferredoxin or cytochromes, inhibiting the electron transport
  chain. Finally, (6) protons outside the cell need to enter the cell for ATP generation
  by ATP synthase. However, the low proton permeability in acidophilic cells could
  affect ATP generation. To maintain a proton equilibrium, other ions (such as K+)
  are likely used as counter‐ions. Dashed arrows show electron transfers for sulphate
  reduction. Dashed square represents a hypothetical process (Created with BioRender)
