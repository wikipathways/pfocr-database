caption: Dysregulated Amyloid-β (Aβ) Clearance in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The vasculature
  is the site of a complex amyloid-β clearance system. Pathological Aβ species, including
  Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42, are generated by the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein
  (APP) by the enzyme β-secretase and the subsequent cleavage of the soluble amyloid
  precursor protein-α (sAPPα) product by γ-secretase. Aβ binds to low density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) on the abluminal membranes of vascular cells and
  LRP1 mediates the internalization of the peptide by an endocytotic pathway, thus
  aiding in Aβ clearance and removal from the brain. The receptor for advanced glycation
  endproducts (RAGE), on the other hand, is involved in the transport of free Aβ from
  the systemic circulation into the brain. In AD, Aβ clearance mechanisms are impaired,
  potentially at an early stage. This includes the downregulation of LRP1 and the
  upregulation of RAGE in AD microvessels. Reduced Aβ clearance may contribute to
  Aβ deposition as parenchymal senile plaques or vascular deposits. Vascular Aβ deposition
  may progress to the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in capillaries
  as well as in the smooth muscle layers of arterioles. Aβ peptides exert toxic effects
  on vascular cells, contribute to the dysregulation of vascular tone, induce vascular
  inflammation and contribute to the weakening of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, excess
  Aβ is involved in several mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in AD, which can also
  have serious consequences for disease risk and progression.
