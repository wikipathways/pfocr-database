caption: 'TLR4 signaling: The MyD88-dependent pathway through PDCD4. LPS activates
  TLR4 and stimulates activation of the MyD88-dependent early-phase activation of
  NF-κB, which leads to an increase in miR-21 expression. miR-21 inhibits PDCD4 expression
  via translational regulation. PDCD4 regulates IL-10 expression by post-transcriptional
  regulation, possibly by inhibiting translation. PDCD4 appears to positively regulate
  NF-κB activity and consequent IL-6 expression.'
