caption: The influence of cervical cancer radiosensitivity by modulation of cell cycle
  arrest (A) Overexpression of KLK5 prevents G2/M phase arrest and enhances the radiosensitivity
  of cervical cancer cells through the cyclin B1 signaling pathway. (B) Overexpression
  of ZNF582 induces p27/p21 accumulation, inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway, induces S/G2
  phase arrest, and enhances radioresistance in cervical cancer cells. (C) Radiation-induced
  activation of protein kinase CHK1 leads to phosphorylation of protein phosphatase
  CDc25C at Ser216, which inhibits phosphate removal from Cdc2. Failure to activate
  CDc2 results in G2/M arrest and enhanced radiation resistance. (D) Upregulation
  of Rab12 by E6 and E7 promotes CDc25C phosphorylation and inhibits CDc2 activation,
  inducing G2/M arrest and enhancing radiation resistance. (E) Activated ATM can induce
  G2/M phase arrest through ATM-Chk2 and ATR-CHK1 signaling pathways while also inducing
  G1/M phase arrest through P53 phosphorylation to enhance radiation resistance.
