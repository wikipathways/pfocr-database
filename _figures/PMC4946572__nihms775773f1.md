caption: 'Scheduling PI3K inhibition for ER+ breast cancer: limitations and possible
  solutions.Receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RPTK) activation by growth factor stimulation
  results in the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway, which
  can be inhibited by the pan PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941). However, continuous administration
  of GDC-0941 leads to a low therapeutic index, significant toxicity and potential
  clonal selection of tumor cells resistant to therapy (left panel). Presented on
  the right panel, solutions include two possible options: 1) new scheduling alternatives
  of pan-PI3K inhibitors which can induce less toxicity while preserving efficacy
  or 2) the administration of PI3K alpha inhibitors. PI3K inhibition will be combined
  with the administration of fulvestrant to elicit robust anti-cancer effects in ER+/PIK3CA-mutant
  breast cancer.'
