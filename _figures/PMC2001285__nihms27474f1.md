  critical functionally, as shown by lesions of each of these areas, which abolish
  CS-enhanced feeding. Our studies have further shown that direct projections from
  CEA are not critical; as indicated by lack of selective activation of that pathway
  by the effective CS+, and the fact that lesions of CEA spare CS-enhanced feeding.
