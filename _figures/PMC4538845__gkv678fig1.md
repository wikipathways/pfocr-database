caption: Synthetic cell fate regulation with engineered yeast MAPK signalling. (A)
  Schematic diagram of the yeast Hog1 MAPK pathway consisting of the two-component
  osmosensor signalling system (Sln1 histidine kinase, Ypd1 phospho-transmitter and
  Ssk1 response regulator) and the downstream MAPK cascade (Ssk2/Ssk22 MAPKKKs, Pbs2
  MAPKK and Hog1 MAPK). The Skn7 response regulator regulates an oxidative stress
  response via Sln1-Ypd1 and is an alternative and opposite output of the histidine
  kinase system. Activation of the HOG pathway upon osmotic stress stimulates expression
  of osmoresponsive genes, while constitutive activation of Hog1 causes lethality.
  (B–E) Phosphorylation patterns of Hog1 and Skn7 depend on histidine kinase activity,
  are affected by Flu treatment in cells expressing DhNik1, but remain unaffected
  in cells expressing the Flu-resistant DhNik1ΔH1–4 mutant. See the text for more
  details. Black and grey arrowheads indicate active and silent signalling flows,
  respectively. (F) Genetic engineering of Hog1 MAPK signalling with exogenous stimuli
  to achieve synthetic cell fate regulation.
