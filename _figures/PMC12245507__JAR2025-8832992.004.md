caption: 'Ferroptosis signaling pathway. This schematic diagram outlines the molecular
  cascade of ferroptosis. Cystine uptake via the system Xc⁻ antiporter is inhibited,
  reduced GSH synthesis. This impairs GPx4, an enzyme that detoxifies lipid peroxides.
  The resulting lipid peroxidation is amplified by iron (Fe2⁺)-driven Fenton reactions,
  producing ROS. Tf- mediated iron uptake and its reduction via STEAP3 and DMT1 contribute
  to intracellular iron overload, further exacerbating ferroptosis. Abbreviations:
  GSH-glutathione; GPx4-glutathione peroxidase 4; ROS-reactive oxygen species; Tf-transferrin;
  DMT1-divalent metal transporter 1; STEAP3-six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of
  prostate 3'
