caption: PI3K/AKT/mT0R signaling pathway. Growth factor or ligand binding to a receptor
  tyrosine kinase, including IGF-1R, PDGFR, or EGFR, leads to activation of IRS-1
  which upregulates and activates PI3K by removing the inhibition of the regulatory
  (p85) subunit on the catalytic subunit (p110). PI3K can also be directly activated
  by RTK or RAS. After activation, PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to make PIP3. PIP3 recruits
  PDK1 and AKT to the cell membrane. PDK1 and mTORC2 phosphorylate and activate AKT.
  PTEN negatively regulates AKT activation by converting PIP3 to PIP2. Activated AKT
  can regulate cell growth and protein synthesis by activating mTORC1 through TSC1/2.
  AKT can stimulate cell-cycle progression by modulating cell-cycle inhibitors (p27kip1
  through FOXO and GSK3) and cell-cycle stimulators (cyclin D1 and c-Myc). AKT can
  also regulate programmed cell death by inhibition of FasL, BIM, or BAD, and by degradation
  of p53 through MDM2. mTOR can form two distinct complexes, mTORCI and mTORC2. mTORCI
  is composed of mTOR, GβL, Mlst8, PRAS40, and raptor. mTORC2 is composed of mTOR,
  GβL, mSIN1, and Rictor. mTORCI can regulate protein synthesis and cell-cycle progression
  through phosphorylating p70S6 kinase (S6K1) and 4E-BP1. mTORCI also facilitates
  the elimination of the p27kip1 through interactions with p34cdc2, allowing cell-cycle
  progression by cdks which can phosphorylate Rb. Arrows represent activation. Lines
  with circles represent inhibition. 4E-BP1 = elF4E binding protein; BAD = BCL-2-associated
  death promoter; BIM = BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death; cdks = cyclin-dependent

  description: PI3K/AKT/mT0R signaling pathway. Growth factor or ligand binding to
