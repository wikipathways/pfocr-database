caption: Schematic diagram of IFN signaling pathway suppressed by ADAR1 via the miR-302/367
  cluster. Various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as viral infection, produce
  double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) which lead to the production of IFN-α and IFN-β, which
  in turn act on the downstream counterparts, IFNAR1/2 receptors. The downstream of
  IFN receptor activates JAK1/Tyk2, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9, which subsequently form
  the ISGF3 complex and finally activate the interferon-stimulated genes in the nucleus,
  thereby enhancing the cellular immunity and related cellular functions (indicated
  by arrows). In the condition when miR-302/367 cluster expression is ample, knockdown
  of ADAR1 itself can reduce the expression of miR-302/367 cluster, thereby increasing
  the expression of STAT1 and IRF9 (colored in red).
