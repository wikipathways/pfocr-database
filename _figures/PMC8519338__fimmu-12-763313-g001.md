caption: Non-coding RNAs regulates macrophage plasticity during the pathogenesis of
  Covid 19 disease. 1. N/S/G spike proteins bind to ACE2 receptors on lung cells and
  determine the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 2. miRNA can be direct targets since
  they can regulate the expression of ACE2 in various organs. 3. Infection produces
  an copius amount of IL-6, which drives the fate of CD14 monocytes/macrophages towards
  M2 phenotype via MAPK signaling, which promotes viral replication. 4. In view of
  this virus eliminating inflammatory niche could be achievd by promting M1 phenotype
  in TLR depenedent MYD88/ERK/NF-Kb pathway. 5. This could be fosterd by application
  of MAPK inhibitors like simvastatin in conjuction of TLR antagonist which can help
  immune cells to curb SARS-CoV-2 in the host effectively.
