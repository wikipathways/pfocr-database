caption: Proposed contribution of TSP-1 linked with ERK1/2 and RhoA signaling pathway
  in NSAID-treated cells. Sulindac sulfide usually causes cellular growth suppression
  or cytotoxicity. As the compensatory mechanism, it also induces TSP-1 expression
  via ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Moreover, activated RhoA signals can enhance TSP-1
  induction levels. All of the compensatory signals elevated cellular viability under
  the cytotoxic NSAID action.
