caption: Inflammatory signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells and potential therapeutic
  targets for myeloid malignancies. Interleukin (IL)-1β activates the IL-1 receptor
  (IL-1R), which causes dimerization and intracellular downstream signaling via MYD88
  and IRAK. This activates multiple downstream pathways, including NF-κB and p38 MAPK.
  Two interleukin 6 (IL-6) molecules form a hexamer with two IL-6 receptors (IL-6R)
  and two GP-130 molecules, which signal via the JAK1–STAT3 pathway. The binding of
  IFN-α/β to IFNAR receptors activates TYK2 and JAK1, which phosphorylate STAT1 and
  STAT2. The association of IRF9 and phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 activates transcription
  by binding to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs). IFN-γ binding to IFNGR receptors
  promotes STAT1 phosphorylation by JAK. The STAT1 homodimer translocates to the nucleus
  and activates IFN-γ-activated site (GAS) sequences. IL-8 binds to its receptor,
  either CXCR1 or CXCR2, which can activate various downstream signaling pathways,
  including PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and MAPK. There is extensive crosstalk between tumor
  necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. TNF-α
  binds to its receptor TNFR and activates IKK via RIP and TRAF2 recruitment by TRADD.
  IKK activation promotes IKB phosphorylation and release of NF-κB, which can then
  translocate to the nucleus. TNF-α binding also activates p38 and MEKK. The activation
  of MEKK causes JNK to stimulate AP-1, which binds to TPA DNA-response elements (TRE)
  and ATF2, which binds to cAMP-responsive elements (CRE). Activation of TLR by infectious
  molecules initiates the signaling pathway through MyD88, which recruits IRAK to
  bind TRAF6 and activate NF-κB and JNK pathways. Representative pathways agonists
  (green boxes) and antagonists (yellow boxes) that are either in preclinical or clinical
  investigation are shown.
