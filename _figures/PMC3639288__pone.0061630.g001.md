caption: (a) When the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) are highly methylated
  or unbound (yellow), CheA is activated by phosphorylation. Once activated, it phosphorylates
  the CheY and CheB response regulators. CheB-P demethylates the MCPs and the high
  level of CheY-P interacts with the flagellar motor, increasing the frequency of
  clockwise (CW) rotation, which causes the cell to tumble. (b) MCPs associated with
  a ligand (attractant) or less methylated (orange), maintain the CheA in a non-phosphorylated,
  inactive state. Consequently, the CheB methylesterase is not active and does not
  demethylate the MCPs. CheR methylation of the MCPs, decreases the sensitivity of
  these receptors. In addition, the CheY-P levels are reduced, leading to an increase
  in counterclockwise (CCW) flagellar rotation frequency, causing the cell to run.
