caption: Biochemical reactions, such as protein aggregation, oxidative stress, the
  immune response, and metabolic dysfunction that occur during retinal degeneration
  cause retinal cell death. When gene mutations trigger macromolecular aggregation,
  one leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress, activating the unfolded protein response
  (UPR), but when UPR activation is not sufficient to relieve stress, cell death is
  induced by activating pro-apoptotic pathways (e.g., Caspases activation, Ca2+ release,
  and mitochondrial signaling); second, the oxidative system and antioxidant system
  imbalance and cyclically aggravate retinal oxidative stress. Third, it triggers
  the mechanism’s immune defense, when the active markers are immune cells and immune
  factors. The result of these unsustainable reactions ultimately points to the death
  of photoreceptor cells in various ways. Another pathway of cell death is autophagy,
  while excessive autophagy triggers apoptosis and necrosis. In addition, the accumulation
  of these reactions to a certain extent causes metabolic dysfunction, which is also
  closely associated with autophagy.
