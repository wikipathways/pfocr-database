caption: (A) Summary of central metabolism during anaerobic fermentation (AF) with
  no terminal electron acceptors. (B) Summary of central metabolism during anaerobic
  respiration (AR) with nitrite (NO3−) as a terminal electron acceptor, via the Nar
  pathway. (C) Close up overview of previously proposed mechanisms at the electron
  transport chain site during anaerobic respiration on NO3-. (D) A detailed summary
  of the key metabolites of central metabolism during AF (blue) and AR (red), indicating
  terminal byproducts Lactate and Ethanol or Acetate, respectively.
