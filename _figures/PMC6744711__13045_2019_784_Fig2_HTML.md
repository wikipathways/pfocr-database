caption: The cross-talk between DNA damage and immune response. Following the stimulation
  of cytoplasmic dsDNA, cGAS is activated and catalyzes the generation of cyclic-dinucleotide.
  CDN is a second messenger which promotes the conformational change of STING. Active
  STING mainly initiates the downstream TBK1-IRF3-Type I IFN pathway. Besides, STING
  could activate the NF-κB pathway which cooperates with IRF3 to upregulate the generation
  of type I IFN. Type I IFN has a substantial influence on systemic immune response
  and regulates multiple components in anti-cancer immunity. Moreover, PARPi treatment-induced
  double-strand break could upregulate PD-L1 expression by augmented anti-cancer immunity
  or ATM-ATR-Chk1 pathway. Lastly, after receiving PARPi treatment, accumulated chromosome
  rearrangements generate plenty of neoantigens and elevate the immunogenicity of
  tumor. DSB, double-strand break; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; cGAS cyclic
  GMP-AMP synthase; TMB, tumor mutation burden
