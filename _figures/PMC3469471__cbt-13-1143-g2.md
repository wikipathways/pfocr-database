caption: Figure 2. Apoptotic signaling induced by TRAIL. TRAIL initiates cell death
  by binding to the proapoptotic death receptors DR4 or DR5 that colocalizes their
  intracellular death domains. This clustering recruits the Fas-associated death domain
  (FADD) and pro-caspase-8 that results in its activation through autocatalytic cleavage.
  In type I cells, activate caspase-8 directly activates caspases-3, -6 and -7 to
  trigger the extrinsic cell death pathway. In type II cells, active caspase-8 cleaves
  Bid to a truncated form, tBid, which subsequently interacts with proapoptotic Bcl-2
  family members Bax and Bak. This interaction leads to permeabilization of the mitochondrial
  membrane and release of cytochrome c. Cytosolic cytochrome c then combines with
  Apaf-1 and ATP to form the apoptosome that activates caspase-9 to trigger apoptosis
  through the caspase cascade.
