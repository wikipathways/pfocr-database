caption: Initiation of endoreplication in Drosophila follicle cells. (A) The follicle
  cells that encapsulate the ovary originate from stem cells and undergo three different
  cell cycle variants during their differentiation. Up to stage 6, follicle cells
  undergo normal mitotic divisions resulting in a final number of approximately 650
  follicle cells. During stages 7–10A, follicle cells execute three endocycles. At
  stage 10B, follicle cells switch from endoreplication to gene amplification, in
  which specific loci become amplified by repeated origin activation. (B) At stages
  6–7, up-regulation of the Notch ligand Delta (Dl) in germline cells activates the
  Notch pathway in follicle cells, which results in inhibition of Stg/Cdc25 and activation
  of the transcription factor Hnt. Activation of Hnt prevents the transcriptional
  repressor Cut from inhibiting APCFzr, thereby promoting proteasomal degradation
  of mitotic cyclins and Stg/Cdc25. Down-regulation of Stg/Cdc25 arrests the cell
  in G2 phase, whereas the subsequent degradation of mitotic cyclins suppresses the
  initiation of mitosis.
