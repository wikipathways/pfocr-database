caption: Pathways affected in monogenic hypertensive disease. The location of the
  mutated gene products in monogenic hypertensive syndromes is shown in the context
  of their pathway. Two groups of pathways are affected, pathways affecting the kidney
  (A) and pathways affecting steroid metabolism and the mineralocorticoid receptor
  (B). A selection of important structures (ion channels, etc.) or enzymes are labelled
  in grey. Proteins mutated in monogenic HTN syndromes are marked by a red star. TAL,
  thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle; DCT, distal-convoluted tubule; CD, collecting
  duct.
