caption: Integration of cold, heat, and ROS signaling in CBF-dependent and independent
  pathways for regulating plant cold stress response. Cold stress triggers changes
  in membrane fluidity and rigidity, and activates the expression of cold-regulated
  genes (CORs) through CBF-dependent and independent pathways. The chilling tolerance
  divergence 1 (COLD1) receives external cold stress signal and stimulates rice G-protein
  A subunit 1 (RGA1) activity. This further activates ANNEXIN1, the Ca2+ channels
  that transport Ca2+ into the cell. The COLD1/RGA activity and Ca2+ transmit cold
  stress signal to Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated signaling and Ca2+-dependent protein kinases
  (CDPKs) located in the cytosol. The CDPKs activities further convey cold stress
  signal through cytosolic and nuclear MAPKs signaling pathways, which leads to induction
  of ICE1 activity. ICE1 binds DRE/CRT motif in the promoter of CBF 1, 2, 3, and 4
  and upregulates their expression. Integration of cold signal through Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated
  signaling activates interaction between CAMTAs and CM2 motif located in CBF promoter,
  which further upregulates COR genes expression. The presence of ABRE, SARE, G-box,
  W-box, AuXRE, and DRE motifs in CAMTAs promoters suggests the potential regulation
  of CAMTA by CBFs and other stress-responsive transcription factors (TFs). Accumulation
  of brassinosteroids promotes binding of BZR1 to E-box found in CBF1 or CBF2 genes
  and activates the expression of COR genes. Through CBF-independent pathway, the
  expression of CBF-independent COR genes is regulated through interaction of other
  TFs such as WRKY, MYB, and bZIP. The expression of CBF-independent COR genes could
  also be regulated through ROS signaling pathway, involving ROS produced by RESPIRATORY
  BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG 1 (RBOH1). The ROS further regulate heat shock factors (HSFs)
  and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and hence develop multi-chaperone network that
  controls production of antioxidant enzymes. The multi-chaperone network is also
  involved in controlling HSP90 activity.
