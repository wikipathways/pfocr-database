caption: Schematic model of the role played by GADD34 and the mTOR pathway in the
  suppression of viral replication. GADD34 is induced by VSV infection and plays a
  critical role in the suppression of viral replication. Induced GADD34 interacts
  with TSC2 to inhibit the mTOR pathway, leading to a suppression of viral protein
  synthesis and viral replication.
