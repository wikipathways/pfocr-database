caption: In the corticotrophinoma cell, EGF binds to its receptor which leads to a
  series of auto-phosphorylation and intracellular signalling cascade. c-Cbl, a ubiquitin-protein
  ligase is recruited and ubiquitinates the EGFR, marking it for endocytosis and eventual
  degradation (bottom-left arrow). However, the USP8 mutated protein (USP8-C40) deubiquitinates
  EGFR and promotes its recycling to the cell surface. Here, EGFR stimulates intracellular
  signalling via the ERK1/2 pathway which phosphorylates transcription factors responsible
  for POMC transcription and ACTH synthesis.
