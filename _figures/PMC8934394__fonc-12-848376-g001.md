caption: The connection between CAB39 and miRNAs, as well as their role in human diseases.
  Inhibition of miRNA has resulted in increased CAB39 levels and increased activity
  of AMPK pathway. Cab39 has therefore been found as a miRNAs target, and these miRNAs
  modulate cardiotoxicity, osteoblasts, cytotoxicity, acute lung damage, chemoresistance,
  senescence, and cancer development through this RNA.
