caption: Signaling pathways of TNFα-induced hepatocyte death. After binding of TNFα
  to TNF-R1, complexes I and II are formed. As the amount of caspase-8 activation
  in complex II is not sufficient to induce cell death of hepatocytes, activation
  of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is essential. Activated caspase-8 initiates
  the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by cleaving Bid to tBid. In addition, JNK can
  also activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway though modulation of Bcl-2 family
  members or degradation of c-FLIP. These pathways cooperate to induce cell death,
  while NF-κB and p38 inhibit TNFα-induced hepatocyte death by suppressing JNK activation
  through various mechanisms.
