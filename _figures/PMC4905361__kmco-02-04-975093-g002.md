caption: 'TNFR1 signaling. Upon stimulation with TNF, TNFR1 recruits TRADD and RIPK1,
  followed by cIAP1, cIAP2, TRAF2, and TRAF5. RIPK1 is then K63-polyubiquitylated
  by cIAP1 and cIAP2, which allows docking of the TAK1–TAB2 or TAB3 complex and the
  IKK complex. Assembly of the IKK complex activates the NF-κB pathway, which is enhanced
  by recruitment of the LUBAC through RIPK1 linear ubiquitylation. Subsequently, upon
  internalization of TNFR1, RIPK1 is believed to dissociate from the receptor as a
  result of deubiquitylation by CYLD and interact with FADD, procaspase-8, and FLIPs.
  The long isoform of FLIP (FLIPL) and procaspase-8 form a heterodimeric caspase that
  cleaves and inactivates RIPK1, RIPK3, and CYLD to prevent necroptosis. This TRADD-dependent
  complex (also referred to as complex IIa) allows caspase-8 homodimerization and
  activation, which activates the executioner caspases 3 and 7 resulting in apoptosis.
  However, when caspase-8 is inhibited by chemical caspase inhibitors or virally encoded
  proteins such as CrmA or vIRA, the RHIM domains of RIPK1 and RIPK3 associate in
  microfilament-like complexes called necrosomes. The mutual auto- and transphosphorylation
  of RIPK1/3 induces the oligomerization of MLKL, which initiates necroptosis. Upon
  cIAP inhibition (e.g., by SMAC mimetics) a large TRADD-independent cytosolic complex
  is formed between RIPK1, RIPK3, FADD, and the FLIPL/caspase-8 heterodimer, which
  is referred to as complex IIb. Similar to complex IIa, RIPK1 and RIPK3 are also
  inactivated through cleavage by caspase-8/FLIPL heterodimers, apoptosis is induced
  by release of caspase-8 homodimers, and necroptosis is induced upon defective caspase-8
  function or recruitment. Abbreviations: cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis; FADD,
  Fas-associated death domain; FLIP, FLICE-like inhibitory protein; IKK, inhibitor
  κB kinase; LUBAC, linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex; RIPK, receptor interacting
  protein kinase; RHIM, RIP homotypic interacting motif; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase
  domain-like; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; SMAC, second mitochondria-derived activator
  of caspase; TAB, TAK1 binding protein; TAK, transforming growth factor-β–activated
  kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; TRADD,
  TNF receptor–associated death domain; TRAF, TNF receptor–associated factor; vIRA,
  viral M45-encoded inhibitor of RIP activation.'
