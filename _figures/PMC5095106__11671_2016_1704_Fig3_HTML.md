caption: TNFR1-elicited signaling pathways []. a On tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binding,
  TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) undergoes a conformational change, allowing for the intracellular
  assembly of the so-called TNFR complex I, which includes TNF receptor-associated
  death domain (TRADD), receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1; also known as RIPK1),
  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs), TNF receptor-associated factor
  2 (TRAF2) and TRAF5. On cIAP-mediated Lys63-ubiquitylation, RIP1 can serve as a
  scaffold for the recruitment of transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1
  (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) and TAB3, which initiate the canonical
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation pathway. Riboflavin kinase (RFK) physically
  bridges the TNFR1 death domain to p22phox (also known as CYBA), the common subunit
  of multiple NADPH oxidases, including NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), which also contributes
  to TNFα-induced necroptosis by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conversely,
  on deubiquitylation by cylindromatosis (CYLD; and perhaps also by A20 (also known
  as TNFAIP3), cezanne (also known as OTUD7B) or ubiquitin-specific peptidase 21 (USP21)),
  RIP1 exerts lethal functions, which can be executed by two distinct types of cell
  death. b The internalization of TNFR1 is accompanied by a change in its binding
  partners that leads to the cytosolic assembly of TNFR complex II, which often (but
  not invariably) contains TRADD, FAS-associated protein with a death domain (FADD),
  caspase-8, RIP1, and RIP3 (also known as RIPK3). Normally, caspase-8 triggers apoptosis
  by activating the classical caspase cascade. It also cleaves, and hence inactivates,
  RIP1 and RIP3. c If caspase-8 is blocked by pharmacological or genetic interventions,
  RIP1 and RIP3 become phosphorylated (perhaps by an unidentified kinase) and engage
  the effector mechanisms of necroptosis. FAD flavin adenine nucleotide, FMN flavin
  mononucleotide
