caption: Hypothesized pathway of mitochondrial apoptosis activation induced by HEV
  infection. HEV entry to the brain tissue promoted the release of Substance P (SP)
  to activate microglial cells, while increased production of vasoactive intestinal
  peptide (VIP) negatively regulated activation of microglial cells as a compensatory
  response. Activated microglial cells produced more inflammatory cytokines such as
  TNFα and IL-1β. The release of TNFα and IL-1β further initiated mitochondrial apoptotic
  pathway. During the process, pro-apoptotic protein Bax induced ruptures of the outer
  membranes altered mitochondrial membrane permeability and further induced activation
  of caspase-9. Up-regulated expression of NOX4 and down-regulated expression of ATP5A1
  also contributed to activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 cascade and ultimately
  induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, which might be a potential way to eliminate
  virus but on the other hand caused neurological disorders.
