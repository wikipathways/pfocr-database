caption: Proposed combination treatment strategy to tackle p53‐mutant esophageal squamous
  cell carcinoma (ESCC) tumors with a WEE1 inhibitor. Cotreatment with trifluridine
  (FTD) and MK1775 inhibited ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3‐related protein (ATR)‐checkpoint
  kinase 1 (CHK1)‐WEE1, a compensation DNA damage response pathway in p53‐mutant ESCC
  cells, resulting in cytotoxicity via synthetic lethality.
