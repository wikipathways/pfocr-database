caption: A feedback loop involves the BMP4 signaling pathway and the miRNAs of the
  23a cluster. In ESCs, through the activation of Smads, BMP4 regulates many genes,
  thus affecting several functions, such as self-renewal, differentiation and apoptosis.
  BMP4 signaling also induces the transcription of the miRNAs of the 23a cluster,
  which in turn targets Smad5, thus downregulating the response of the cells to BMP4.
  As a consequence, these miRNAs protect differentiating ESCs from BMP4–dependent
  apoptosis. This effect could be dependent on the direct targeting by miRNAs of pro-apoptotic
  factors under the control of BMP4
