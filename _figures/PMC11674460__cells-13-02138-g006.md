caption: Schematic illustration of the molecular mechanism underlying the pleiotropic
  anticancer activity of tetrandrine against GBM cells and GSCs. Besides autophagic
  cell death induction, tetrandrine not only modulates the expression of pro-apoptotic
  (Bax and Bid) and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, XIAP), but also directly
  induces apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), resulting in apoptosis induction. ROS accumulation,
  because of tetrandrine-meditated mitochondrial dysfunction, can activate MAPKs (p-38
  and JNK) and consequently induce cell death. In addition, tetrandrine suppresses
  EGFR, VEGF, and their downstream targets, resulting in inhibition of migration/invasion
  and angiogenesis, as well as cell cycle arrest in GBM cells. Tetrandrine also can
  suppress the Wnt/β-catenin singling pathway, inhibit the nuclear translocation of
  β-catenin, and ultimately repress neurosphere formation of GSCs. Importantly, tetrandrine
  has been reported to inhibit a multidrug resistance protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp),
  and consequently reverses multidrug resistances, which are closely linked to poor
  prognosis of GBM
