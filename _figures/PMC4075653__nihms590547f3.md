caption: Several different mitochondrial pathways respond to stress or damage and
  are coordinated with mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondria in healthy cells generate
  an electrochemical potential that serves in oxidative phosphorylation and drives
  the import of proteins into the organelle. Damage that leads to a loss (blue) of
  mitochondrial membrane potential can lead to a loss of protein import efficiency.
  In the unfolded protein stress response (UPRmt) pathway, loss of import leads to
  the accumulation of the transcription factor ATFS1 in the nucleus, activating a
  transcriptional mitochondrial repair and metabolic adaptation response. Loss of
  membrane potential also triggers the OMA1-dependent proteolysis of long isoforms
  of the inner membrane fusion DRP OPA1, which attenuates mitochondrial fusion and
  potentially increases ER-mediated mitochondrial division (ERMD), resulting in mitochondrial
  fragmentation. These fragmented mitochondria that have lost the ability to respire
  and import may also accumulate the PINK1 kinase, which triggers mitophagy. In addition,
  under these conditions, the ERMD domain may be altered to directly promote BAX oligomerization
  on the mitochondrial outer membrane, outer-membrane permeabilization and cytochrome
  c release, leading to cell death. Mitochondrial dysfunction and stresses such as
  starvation can trigger mitochondrial hyperfusion, which is dependent on maintenance
  of mitochondrial membrane potential (red) and the presence of both long and short
  OPA1 isoforms. Hyperfused mitochondria can transiently buffer the effects of respiratory
  chain dysfunction and do not enter the mitophagy pathway. The relationship between
  UPRmt and mitochondrial shape has not been explored.
