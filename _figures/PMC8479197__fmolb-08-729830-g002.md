caption: K-RAS4A versus K-RAS4B protein sequence and signalling. RAS proteins contain
  a G domain (residues 1–165) responsible for the catalytic and switching portion
  of the protein that interacts with GDP/GTP, exchange factors, and GTPase-activating
  proteins (GAPs). The less homologous part corresponds to the hypervariable region
  (HVR) domains (final 23/24 residues). RAS are farnesylated on their C-terminal cysteine
  residue (CAAX motif), undergo AAX proteolysis and receive carboxyl methylation at
  the C-terminal prenylcysteine to allow the first step in membrane binding. A second
  motif improves this weak binding, which is a hexa-lysine polybasic stretch (residues
  175–180) that interacts electrostatically with membranes in the case of K-RAS4B.
  Whereas, K-RAS4A membrane binding is stabilised by a monopalmitoylation site (residue
  180), whereas this site is absent in the isoform K-RAS4B (). The KIKK motif (residues
  182–185) was shown to be an additional membrane-targeting motif for K-RAS4A (),
  in addition to other basic motif corresponding to RLKK (residues 167–170) (). The
  binding of growth factors to the extracellular regions of receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs) initiates the signal that will lead to the activation of RAS proteins downstream
  of the receptor. The isoforms can bind to a variety of effectors with variable affinities
  where, for example, hexokinase 1 was shown to bind to K-RAS4A with higher affinity
  than to K-RAS4B; the same was observed for Raf1 (; ). Part of the figure was built
  and adapted from the “Ras Pathway” template, by BioRender.com.
