caption: Gene product interaction network of “Interferon-γ” gene set—an up-regulated
  pathway in subcutaneous fat of OSA subjects relative to those without OSA. A number
  of the most highly connected nodes (known as hubs) have been labeled, including
  interferon-γ (IFNG), FAS, STAT1, STAT3, CASP3, CASP8, and TNFSF10. Note that the
  interactions among these densely connected nodes (shown as green lines) capture
  the majority of the network’s overall connectivity (green and gray lines). These
  hubs represent key drivers of OSA-induced activation of interferon-γ signaling in
  subcutaneous adipose tissue. Full list of network nodes is provided in .
