caption: Schematic representation of the activity of the cortical-basal ganglia circuits
  in normal subjects (a) and in patients with Parkinson's disease/Parkinsonism (b),
  resulting in a possible compensatory upregulation of GABAA receptors in various
  nuclei (STN, GPi, and SNr), which are overactive in PD. In PD, the underactivity
  of GABAergic neurons of the putamen and caudate projecting to GPi and SNr through
  the direct (D) pathway (b) may result in compensatory upregulation of GABAA receptors
  [] in deafferented brain structures, namely, the GPi and SNr (b). Similarly, we
  can hypothesize that in PD the decreased GABAergic inhibition exerted by the external
  globus pallidus (GPe) through the indirect (I) pathway on the glutamatergic neurons
  of the STN and the GABAergic neurons of the GPi and SNr (b) may result in compensatory
  upregulation of GABAA receptors in such deafferented brain structures (STN, GPi,
  and SNr). Such compensatory upregulation of GABAA receptors in deafferented brain
  structures (STN, GPi, and SNr) could be more marked in PD patients who, after the
  administration of zolpidem, show more evident beneficial effects on Parkinsonian
  motor symptoms and show no or minimal drowsiness. White arrows = excitatory connections;
  black arrows = inhibitory connections.
