caption: 'Antiobesity effects of FX through regulating lipid metabolism: FX significantly
  reduces free fatty acid synthesis via controlling many enzymes, which are associated
  with lipid metabolism. It promotes β-oxidation, bile acid synthesis pathway, and
  Sirt1/AMPK pathway and inhibits lipogenesis, mevalonate pathway, pentose phosphate
  pathway, and glycerol phosphate pathway. As a result, plasmatic and hepatic triglyceride
  and cholesterol concentrations are decreased. It reduces lipid accumulation in hepatic
  cells and adipose tissues.'
