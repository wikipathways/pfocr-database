caption: 'ASD proteomic profiles converge on four canonical pathways involved in mitochondrial
  metabolism, neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. (A) The Venn diagram shows the Hallmark
  canonical pathways implicated in seven or more independent datasets (in blue), the
  enriched canonical pathways in the 121 differentially expressed proteins implicated
  in transcriptomic and DNAm datasets (light grey) and the pathways that overlap (in
  bold font). (B) The four pathways implicated in both analyses (A) converge on the
  regulation of the following biological processes (in blue): neural stem cell proliferation,
  neurogenesis, mitochondrial metabolism, and inflammation. The mTORC1 signalling
  pathway induces oxidative phosphorylation via the activation of camp-responsive
  element binding protein 1 (CREB1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A), which regulates mitochondrial metabolism and
  the antioxidant response. PPARGC1A is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma (PPARGy), which acts as a master regulator of lipid metabolism and
  is essential to induce adipogenesis. Adipogenesis is negatively regulated by WNT
  signalling, which inhibits PPARGy, PPARGC1A and mTORC1 signalling to regulate stem
  cell proliferation and differentiation. Mitochondrial metabolism regulates metabolic
  and redox homeostasis which governs the inflammatory profile of microglia. Oxidative
  stress leads to the over proliferation of reactive microglia, which triggers the
  pro-inflammatory complement response.'
