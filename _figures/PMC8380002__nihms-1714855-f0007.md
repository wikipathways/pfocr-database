caption: Glucose metabolism-mediated signal regulation in neurological disease. Disease-related
  gene mutation, aging, or environmental toxins can cause dysfunction of glucose metabolism
  in the brain, which leads to neuronal injury by activating inflammation or promoting
  oxidative stress and the accumulation of glycated toxic proteins (such as α-synuclein,
  Aβ), impairing neuronal function. Aβ, amyloid beta; GLUT, glucose transporter; PPP,
  pentose phosphate pathway; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  GSH, glutathione.
