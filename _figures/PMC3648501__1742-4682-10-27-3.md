caption: Schematic diagram of the Wnt signaling pathway. The diagram was created using
  CellDesigner. The light green rectangle represents protein; the bottle green parallelogram
  represents mRNA; the white rectangle that contains a light green rectangle represents
  a complex; ∅ represents the resultant of a degradation reaction or reactant of a
  combination reaction. The arrow represents the reaction.
