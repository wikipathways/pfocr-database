caption: Macrophage membrane-biomimetic selenylated Poria cocos polysaccharide nanoparticles
  attenuate acute pancreatitis injury. Firstly, selenylated Poria cocos polysaccharide
  nanoparticles (Se-P) formed uncoated selenylated Poria cocos polysaccharide lipid
  nanoparticles (Se-PP) by thin-film hydration method with liposomes, then further
  combined with extracted macrophage membrane (CM) proteins to form macrophage membrane-biomimetic
  selenylated Poria cocos polysaccharide nanoparticles (mSe-PP). Subsequently, different
  formulations were intravenously injected to treat acute pancreatitis in mice. mSe-PP
  accumulated in the pancreatic microenvironment of inflammation, interfering with
  the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils. It alleviated the severity of inflammation
  by inhibiting the expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory factors in macrophages.
  Simultaneously, it reversed autophagy pathway damage by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR
  pathway in macrophages, thereby reducing the production of ROS and cell apoptosis
