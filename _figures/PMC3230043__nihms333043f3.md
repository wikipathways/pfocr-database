caption: Arginine is synthesized endogenously from citrulline primarily via the intestinal-renal
  axis. Arginase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) compete for arginine, their common
  substrate. In sickle cell disease (SCD), bioavailability of arginine and nitric
  oxide (NO) are decreased by several mechanisms linked to hemolysis, and similar
  mechanisms are postulated for thalassemia and other hemolytic disorders. The release
  of erythrocyte arginase during hemolysis increases plasma arginase levels and shifts
  arginine metabolism towards ornithine production, decreasing the amount available
  for NO production. The bioavailability of arginine is further decreased by increased
  ornithine levels because ornithine and arginine compete for the same transporter
  system for cellular uptake. Endogenous synthesis of arginine from citrulline may
  be compromised by renal dysfunction, commonly associated with sickle cell disease.
  Despite an increase in NOS in SCD, NO bioavailability is low due to low substrate
  availability, NOS dysfunction, NO scavenging by cell-free hemoglobin released during
  hemolysis, and through reactions with free radicals such as superoxide. Superoxide
  is elevated in SCD due to low superoxide dismutase activity, high xanthine oxidase
  activity and potentially as a result of uncoupled NOS in an environment of low arginine
  and/or tetrahydrobiopterin concentration or potentially as a result of altered redox
  potential of NADPH, a critical NOS cofactor. Endothelial dysfunction resulting from
  NO depletion and increased levels of the downstream products of ornithine metabolism
  (polyamines and proline) likely contribute to the pathogenesis of lung injury, fibrosis
  and pulmonary hypertension. (Reproduced from Morris et al. [], with permission from
