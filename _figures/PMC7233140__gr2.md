caption: Cumulative effect of elevated CO2 and drought on stomatal behavior.Increased
  CO2 modulates OPEN STOMATA1 through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent mechanisms
  via increased NOX, ROS production and modulation of ion channel activities which
  in turn changes osmotic regulation, pH, protein phosphorylation and turgor pressure
  of guard cells. Additionally, increased rate of photosynthesis and ATP production
  show an additive effect on leaf enlargement and canopy temperature.The molecular
  mechanisms underlying elevated CO2-induced closure and reduction in stomatal density
  involve generation of reactive oxygen species. The pathway essentially has a bifurcation
  involving ABA and PYR/RCAR family of ABA receptors through guard cell ABA signaling
  pathway, acting through a loop-mediated mechanism where CO2 induced an increase
  in ABA, which in turn increases the sensitivity of the system to elevated CO2. CO2
  signal transduction pathway via ABA-OST1/SnRK2.6 shows that basal ABA signaling
  and OST1/SnRK2.6 are required to facilitate stomatal response to elevated CO2. Although
  ABA and increased CO2 induce PYR/PYL/RCAR family of ABA receptors in a stimulus
  specific manner, in the responses to CO2, PYL4 and PYL5 are crucial.
