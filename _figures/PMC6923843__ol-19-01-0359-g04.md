caption: Gene functional and Network pathway analysis of TRAP1, HSPD1, HSPB1, HSPA1L
  and HSPA1A. The Gene functional and Network pathway analysis evaluated in silico
  by STRING database. The circles colors indicate the HSP functions in network. Chaperone
  mediated protein folding, negative regulated of oxidative stress-induced intrinsic
  apoptotic signaling pathway (green), MAPK signaling pathway (yellow), and spliceossoma
  (purple). TRAP1, TNF receptor associated protein 1; HSP, heat shock protein family.
papertitle: HSPA1A, HSPA1L and TRAP1 heat shock genes may be associated with prognosis
  in ovarian epithelial cancer.
