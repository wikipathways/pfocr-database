caption: 'V. anguillarum quorum-sensing phosphorelay model. Solid lines with arrows
  and bars indicate activation and repression of gene expression, respectively. Solid
  lines with double arrowheads indicate the transfer of phosphoryl groups from one
  protein to another. Details of the model are given in the Introduction and Discussion.
  In this study, a model is presented suggesting that the phosphotransferase VanU
  phosphorylates two response regulators: one response regulator, VanO, activates
  Qrr sRNA expression, repressing VanT expression, and a second, predicted response
  regulator (RR-2) is hypothesized to repress Qrr sRNA expression, activating VanT
  expression. The RR-2 is predicted to be phosphorylated via a histidine kinase (HK-2)
  of an independent two-component pathway. Abbreviations: OM, outer membrane; IM,
  inner membrane.'
