caption: Several types of enteroendocrine cell throughout the gut express components
  of nutrient-sensing and signal-transduction systems that were previously thought
  to be selective to taste-bud cells. These include apical G protein–coupled receptors
  for sweet and bitter chemicals; the unusual G protein isoforms Gαgustducin, Gβ3,
  and Gγ13; phospholipase Cβ2; and the TRPM5 Ca2+-activated Na+/K+ channel. Additional
  contributions from plasma membrane delayed-rectifying K+ channels and voltage-gated
  Ca2+ channels that are important for taste sensation in the tongue have not yet
  been confirmed in enteroendocrine cells. In both cell types, the final common pathway
  for activation includes an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. This
  triggers basolateral exocytosis of neurotransmitters from lingual taste-receptor
  cells into synapses with nerve fibers that relay information to the hindbrain. In
  enteroendocrine cells, surges in intracellular calcium concentration trigger release
  from the basolateral membrane of signaling molecules, including satiation peptides,
  which diffuse across extracellular fluids to enter the circulation or to interact
  with nearby afferent nerve terminals from vagal, spinal, and myenteric neurons.
  IP3, inositol trisphosphate.
