caption: Working model for the function of Sulf1 and CG4096 in the Egfr pathway. A
  schematic of the Egfr pathway is shown with Vn binding to the receptor (the other
  ligands are also likely to be involved), which leads to activation of the pathway
  and expression of the Sulf1 and CG4096 genes. Sulf1 blocks binding of Vn to HSPG
  by removing 6-O sulfates. We hypothesize this is inhibitory because binding of Vn
  to HSPG facilitates interaction with the receptor. CG4096 negatively regulates the
  pathway by masking the EGF ligands by an unknown mechanism that may be direct or
  involve an additional factor (X). X could also be a ligand activator that CG4096
  inhibits.
