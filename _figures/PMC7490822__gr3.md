caption: 'Examples of microbial electrosynthesis (cathodic electro-fermentation) based
  on direct EET (A and B) and shuttle-mediated EET (C, D, E, and F). (A) Electricity-driven
  metabolic shift of C. pasteurianum for butanol production from glucose and 1,3-propandiol
  production from glycerol . (B) 2,3-butanediol production in a hydrogenase-deficient
  S. oneidensis using native Mtr proteins and exogenous light-driven proton pump (proteorhodopsin)
  for NADH accumulation . (C) Different effects of neutral red (NR) and the barely
  studied redox mediator brilliant blue (BB) on the growth and product formation of
  C. pasteurianum grown on glycerol in a newly developed bioelectrochemical system
  . (D) Chiral alcohol (R)-1-phenylethanol production from acetophenone in engineered
  E. coli by using methyl viologen (MV) as mediator to achieve EET . (E) Hydrogen-driven
  microbial electrosynthesis from CO2 to acetate and methane in S. ovate and M. maripaludis
  via highly biocompatible transition-metal-based cathodes, respectively . (F) Formate
  dehydrogenase (FDH)-assisted electrosynthesis of (3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) in R.
  eutropha, which overexpressed the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
  (Rubisco) . Formate reduced from CO2 and NR both served as the electron carriers
  to transfer electrons derived from cathodes into R. eutropha. PEM: proton exchange
