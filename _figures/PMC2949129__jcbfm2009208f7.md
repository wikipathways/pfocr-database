caption: 'Putative signaling pathways leading to translational activation and enhanced
  MCT2 protein synthesis after BDNF treatment in cultured cortical neurons. BDNF and
  TrkB can activate distinct signal transduction pathways involving specific kinases
  leading to translation initiation. Two pathways investigated in this study are illustrated
  herein (PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6 and MAPK signaling pathways). The surrounding proteins
  were directly investigated for their level of phosphorylation. First, phosphorylation
  of PI3K can cause the phosphorylation and activation of Akt, which then directly
  phosphorylates mTOR, which in turn phosphorylates p70S6K. The target of p70S6K,
  the ribosomal S6 protein, once phosphorylated, participates in the translational
  machinery as part of the 40S complex. Second, the MAPK cascade is also activated
  by BDNF requiring the activation of MEK. MEK phosphorylates the p44 and p42 MAPK,
  which can activate, among others, MNK1. When activated, MNK1 phosphorylates eIF4E
  on Ser209 that correlates with enhanced rates of translation of capped mRNA. Specific
  inhibitors for some kinases have been used to distinguish the implication of each
  pathway in the effect of BDNF: LY294002, PI3K inhibitor; rapamycin, mTOR inhibitor;
  PD98058, MEK inhibitor; SB202190 and SB203580, p38 MAPK inhibitors.'
