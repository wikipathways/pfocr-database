caption: 'Types of fibroblast memory: (a) positional memory is established during
  development and is largely driven by Hox gene expression. The expression of region
  specific Hox genes is maintained by autoregulatory loops, modifications to DNA and
  histones and by ncRNA inhibiting expression of specific Hox genes; (b) mechanical
  memory: fibroblasts are linked to the external mechanical environment of the ECM
  by integrins and other adhesion receptors. Mechanical strain transmitted via the
  cytoskeleton can directly influence chromatin accessibility and gene transcription.
  Beside chromatin modifications, mechanical memory is maintained through expression
  of miRNAs (e.g., miR-21), sustained TF activity such as NFκB and YAP/TAZ, and positive
  feedback loops such as contraction induced release of latent TGF-β from the ECM;
  (c) inflammatory memory: fibroblasts sense the inflammatory state through pattern
  recognition and cytokine receptors. Memory is maintained through modifications to
  DNA and histones, sustained TF and signalling pathway activity, such as the JAK/STAT
  pathway, and possibly through miRNAs; (d) metabolic memory in fibroblasts is maintained
  by modifications to DNA and histones, sustained TF activity, an autocrine TGF-β
  feedback loop and positive feedback involving altered mitochondrial signalling and
  cellular metabolite levels.'
