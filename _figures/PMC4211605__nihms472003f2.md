caption: Alcohols can be synthesized via the CoA-dependent pathway (purple) or the
  keto-acid pathway (blue). The latter takes advantage of native amino acid biosynthesis
  by decarboxylation and reduction (via the Ehrlich pathway) of the keto-acid intermediates
  of the Val, Leu or Ile pathways. 2-Ketobutyrate can be produced via the native threonine
  or the heterologous citramalate pathway. Elongation using engineered enzymes can
  recursively increase the product length by one carbon each round. The CoA-dependent
  mechanism is similar to ABE fermentation in Clostridium. Replacing the key enzyme
  butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Bcd) with an irreversible trans-enoyl-coA reductase (Ter)
  increases flux to butanol. Successive cycles of this pathway elongate the product
  by two carbons per cycle, producing hexanol from one turn, and octanol from two
  turns of the pathway. Double-headed arrows represent multiple steps.
