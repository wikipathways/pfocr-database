caption: (A) Environmental stimuli can induce different dynamic patterns of Erk activity,
  which are then interpreted by downstream transcriptional circuits to specify cell
  behavior. (B) OptoSOS is an optogenetic method for Ras activation that enables probing
  of how cells filter and respond to dynamic Ras inputs. The light-inducible PhyB-PIF
  heterodimer drives membrane recruitment of the Ras-activating SOS2 catalytic domain,
  which activates Ras at the membrane. Red light (650 nm) induces PhyB-PIF dimerization,
  whereas far-red light (750 nm) dissociates the dimer. (C) We tested the hypothesis
  that some cancer cells may inappropriately filter dynamic Ras-Erk signals. We examined
  how dynamic optogenetic inputs were interpreted by normal or cancer cells through
  a combination of live-cell microscopy, high-throughput optogenetic stimulation (),
  and immunofluorescence.
