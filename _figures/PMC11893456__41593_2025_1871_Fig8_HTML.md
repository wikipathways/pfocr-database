caption: We showed that accumulation of viral antigens in intravascular immune cells
  and perivascular structures is associated with profound vascular inflammation, EPVS,
  impaired BBB function, increased PVM numbers, focal loss of microglial P2Y12R and
  CX3CR1–CX3CL1 axis defects at sites of severe neuropathologies that include disintegration
  of myelin and loss of synaptic proteins. Assessment of inflammatory changes by different,
  complementary approaches reveal the activation of PRRs (NLRs and TLRs), the development
  of an IL-1- and IL-6-related proinflammatory response in line with increased production
  of IL-18 and an antiviral type I IFN response with partially distinct characteristics
  in the CSF and the brain tissue. SnRNA-seq, proteomics and molecular anatomy data
  show markedly impaired cell–cell interactions and metabolic failure in the neurovascular
  unit, loss of core microglial gene signatures, microglial mitochondrial failure
  and cell death. Among these, we identified changes in the NAD biosynthetic pathway
  and the possible regulatory role of TGFα among other potentially contributing pathways,
  including altered SPP1–CD44 interactions or initiation of apoptotic cascades (via
  Caspase 8, EN-RAGE or other pathways). Of note, central viral load and inflammatory
  changes show strong association with those revealed in peripheral organs, including
  an IL-1- and IL-6-related proinflammatory response and production of downstream
  cytokines and chemokines, suggesting marked impact of systemic inflammatory mechanisms
  on central inflammation and related neuropathologies
