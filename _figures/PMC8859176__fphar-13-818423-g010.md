caption: Schematic diagram shows the possible mechanism of FA against depression and
  anxiety in astrocytes and microglia. FA could improve neonatal encephalitis and
  PIA-induced neuropsychiatric disorders through different regulatory mechanisms in
  different glial cells. FA prevents inflammatory events by interfering with NF-κB
  signaling pathway in astrocytes, and both the NF-κB signaling pathway and P38/MAPK
  signaling pathway in microglia. In addition, FA plays important roles in PIA models
  through EZH2/H3K27me3-mediated IL-10 and BDNF in astrocytes, and KDM4A/H3K9me3-mediated
  IL-13 in microglia, respectively.
