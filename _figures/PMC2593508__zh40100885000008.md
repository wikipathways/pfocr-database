caption: Schematic illustrating proposed mechanisms underlying the net effects of
  DA compression on fetal pulmonary blood flow during DA compression, which represent
  an equilibrium between flow-induced vasodilation and pressure-induced vasoconstriction
  (myogenic tone). Rho-kinase pathway is related to calcium sensitization, high vascular
  tone, and myogenic response, which are offset through activation of the nitric oxide
  (NO) pathway, which induces vasodilation. GC, guanylate cyclase; GTP, guanosine
  5′-triphosphate; cGMP, guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; Ca2+, intracellular
  calcium; MLC, myosin light chain; MLC-P, phosphorylated MLC; MLCK, MLC kinase; MLCPh,
  MLC phosphatase (active); MLCPh-P, phosphorylated MLC phosphatase (inactive).
