caption: Phospholipid synthesis. In Buchnera the complete biosynthetic pathway except
  cardiolipin synthase is missing. If cardiolipin synthase is still active, the respective
  precursors, CDP-diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, have to be provided by
  the host. In “Candidatus Blochmannia,” only the glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase
  specific for the first acyltransfer is missing, while in Wigglesworthia the pathway
  is complete. Missing steps are highlighted in grey.
