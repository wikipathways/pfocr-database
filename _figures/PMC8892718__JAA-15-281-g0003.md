caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of PPI efficacy for EoE. (A) Anti-Secretory Mechanism:
  Hypothesizes that the integrity of the esophageal epithelium is compromised by exposure
  to gastric acid leading to ingress of antigens and activation of an immune response.
  Acid suppression by PPIs allows the esophageal epithelium to heal facilitating resolution
  of inflammation. (B) Anti-Inflammatory Mechanisms: 1.) PPIs block expression of
  cell surface adhesion molecules, inhibiting migration of inflammatory cells to the
  esophageal epithelium; 2.) PPIs block STAT6 mediated expression of eotaxin-3 reducing
  recruitment of eosinophils to the esophageal epithelium; 3.) PPIs can stimulate
  the aryl hydrocarbon receptor normalizing expression of genes involved in barrier
  function including, filaggrin, loricrin, and involucrin through inhibition of the
  IL-4/IL-13-STAT6 pathway; 4.) PPIs can inhibit the activity of ATP12A, the non-gastric
  P2-type H+, K+-ATPase. IL-4 mediated induction of eotaxin-3 secretion is sensitive
  to inhibition of ATP12A.'
