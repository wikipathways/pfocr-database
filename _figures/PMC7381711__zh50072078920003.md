caption: Summary of potential therapeutic effects of heparin in coronavirus disease
  2019 (COVID-19). 1) Heparin’s classic function as an anticoagulant, through its
  interaction with antithrombin-III (AT3), may prove beneficial because of the high
  prevalence of coagulopathy and clinically significant thrombosis in the disease.
  2) Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry into both
  endothelial and epithelial cells is believed to be dependent on its interaction
  with cell surface heparan sulfate; thus, heparin (or carefully designed synthetic
  heparin-like drugs) may inhibit this interaction and block viral entry. 3) Last,
  heparin has known anti-inflammatory effects that may confer benefit in COVID-19.
