caption: KDM5C is a SAHA-sensitive marker of a druggable pathway damaged in NDDs.
  (A) Model of the KDM5C-related pathway damaged in NDDs. Mutations in genes encoding
  the transcription regulators ARX (1.), ZNF711 (2.) and PHF8 (3.) damage the KDM5C
  transcription, which protein in turn, through a defective H3K4me3 demethylation
  process (4.), causes a lack of repression of Bdnf, Scn2a, and Syn1 (5.). Treatment
  with SAHA restores KDM5C activity and consequently the downstream signalling (6.).
  (B) In Arx-KO/Kdm5C-depleted cells, SAHA ameliorates neuronal maturation during
  in vitro differentiation (1.). In alr-1(KO)/rbr-2-depleted animals, the SAHA exposure
  during early stage of development rescues touch sensitivity deficit and ameliorates
  VDs maturation (2.).

  of transcriptional axes involved in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders.
