caption: 'Mechanism of activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in TBI, and proposed mode
  of action of small molecule inhibitor MCC950.TBI activates the NLRP3 inflammasome
  by two different mechanisms, first the initial priming signal at the transcriptional
  level which induces the NF-κB pathway. Secondly, the induction mechanism involving
  the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex by direct interaction with TXNIP,
  a Redox-sensitive regulator. Activated NLRP3 induces the oligomerization of ASC
  which eventually leads to the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. The assembled
  complex then catalyses the cleavage of Caspase-1 and the subsequent release of IL-1β
  and inflammatory mediators. Prolonged NLRP3 activation induces proapoptotic molecules
  such as cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3. The specific inhibitor MCC950 blocks
  NLRP3-induced ASC oligomerization, eventually alleviating the NLRP3-induced neuroinflammation
  and proapoptotic signaling caused by TBI. ASC: Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein;
  ATP: adenosine triphosphate; DAMP: damage-associated molecular patterns; IL-1β:

  molecular patterns; P2RX7: P2X purinoceptor 7; TXNIP: thioredoxin interacting protein.'
