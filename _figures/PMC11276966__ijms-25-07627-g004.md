caption: The processes modulated by CLE signaling pathways and their impact on cells.
  CLEs bind to receptors, including CLV2, CLV3, BAMs, TDR, CIK2, and ACR4, triggering
  the recruitment of co-receptors CRN, RPK2, and BAK1 to the complex. These initial
  interactions initiate downstream signaling cascades regulating SAM homeostasis,
  xylem differentiation, cambial cell division, protophloem differentiation, columella
  stem cells, and lateral root development. Arrows and bars represent positive and
  negative regulation, while solid and dashed lines denote direct and indirect regulation
