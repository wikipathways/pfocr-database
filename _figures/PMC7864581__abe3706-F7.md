caption: (A) Immunoblot for USP9X shows significantly reduced S-nitrosylation in aortic
  valves from adults with moderate (AVD-1 and AVD-2) and moderate-severe (AVD-3 and
  AVD-4) CAVD when compared to uncalcified aortic valve (Control). S-nitrosylation
  of GAPDH is also shown. Absence of a band in the ascorbate-negative experiment served
  as the negative control. Total load shows protein expression in the cell lysates
  before purification of S-nitrosylated proteins where USP9X, MIB1, and NICD expression
  is reduced in calcified valves while RUNX2 is increased. GAPDH serves as a loading
  control. (B) Schematic showing the proposed model where S-nitrosylation of USP9X
  leads to MIB1 stabilization via deubiquitination, which increases ligand-mediated
  NOTCH1 activation in neighboring cells and the inhibition of calcification in physiological
  concentrations of NO. This pathway is abrogated under low concentrations of NO.
