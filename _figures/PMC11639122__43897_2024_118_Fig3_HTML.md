caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) in potatoes.
  The figure illustrates the key steps involved in SGA biosynthesis, with solid arrows
  representing confirmed reaction stages and dashed arrows indicating steps that require
  further elucidation. The diagram highlights the distinct glycosidic units between
  α-solanine and α-chaconine, denoted by a green background, and emphasizes the crucial
  chemical differences between spiro- and solanine-type SGAs, indicated by a yellow
  background. For a comprehensive understanding of each step, please refer to the
  detailed description in the main text
