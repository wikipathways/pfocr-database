caption: Protein profile in skeletal muscle biopsies and their association with EV
  miRNAs in GDM. A–C miRNA gene target and gene ontology analysis for selected miRNAs.
  Gene ontology analysis for these gene targets showed enrichment for several biological
  processes. D Volcano plot showing differentially expressed proteins in skeletal
  muscles in GDM compared to NGT. The horizontal axis represents the log2 of fold
  change and the vertical axis represents the p-value. Each grey dot represents a
  protein with dots on the right of the zero are proteins upregulated while on the
  left are downregulated in GDM skeletal muscle. Each red dot represents proteins
  which are significantly differentially expressed with p value < 0.05. The proteins
  which are associated with diabetes and targeted by the exosome miRNAs on Pair Analysis
  are labelled. E On integration of EV miRNA and skeletal muscle protein expression
  profiles, we identified miRNA-targeted networks involved in regulation of skeletal
  muscle insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. Each network displays the genes
  as nodes and the relationships between the nodes as lines. STAT 3 was identified
  to be a significant pathway targeting by multiple proteins (indicated by blue lines)
