caption: Proposed model of the mode of inhibition of stomatal closure by Xcc. The
  DSF (diamonds), which mediates cell-to-cell communication, interacts with the cell
  surface receptor RpfC, which in turn triggers signaling that leads to transcription
  of genes required for the synthesis of the stomatal inhibitory compound (triangles).
  This molecule diffuses to the extracellular space and gets contact with stomatal
  guard cells, where it blocks stomatal closure induced by ABA or PAMPs by interfering
  with some signaling component within a putative signaling pathway branch including
  H2O2 and MPK3. MPK3 is absolutely required for bacterial or PAMP-induced promotion
  of closure pathway, as shown by the failure of MPK3 antisense plants to close stomata
  in response to these stimuli. For ABA, instead, other pathways, including ABA-induced
  cytosolic pH increase, would compensate for the absence of MPK3. The failure of
  the stomatal inhibitor to interfere with promotion of closure by ABA in MPK3 antisense
  plants could be explained by compensatory adjustments within the guard-cell-signaling
  network, indicated by thick arrows, that would make up for the absence of MPK3.
