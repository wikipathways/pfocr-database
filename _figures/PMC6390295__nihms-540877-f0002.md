caption: This illustration describes cells defined as “T memory stem cells” according
  to References [], []. These cells are generated by activating the Wnt pathway during
  the priming phase. They are long-lived, display robust proliferative and effector
  capacities. Murine cells are able to reconstitute an effective immune response in
  immunodeficient hosts. They express low levels of CD44 in mice and high levels of
  CD45RA in humans.
