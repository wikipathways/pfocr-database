caption: Model diagram of the regulatory of IL-17 between gut and hypertension. SCFAs
  can inhibit HDAC in T cells, which promotes the acetylation of kinase p70 S6 and
  phosphorylated rS6, thus promoting the mTOR pathway necessary for the proliferation
  of Th17 cells. HSD could activate the p38/MAPK pathway, involving TonEBP/NFAT5 SGK1
  and subsequently mediate the secretion of IL-17a by naive CD4+ cells. Moreover,
  L.murinus can prevent production of Th17 cells induced by HSD. Th17 cells are also
  mediated by SFB through ROS and SAA. Then IL-17 can promote the reabsorbtion of
  salt/water and inhibit NO-derived from eNOS, consequently lead to elevation of blood
  pressure
