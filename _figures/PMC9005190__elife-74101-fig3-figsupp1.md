caption: Emax values derived from concentration-response curves generated on 100 receptors
  using the 15 ebBRET-based assay are represented as radial graphs. A score of 0 indicates
  no coupling to a given pathway, whereas a score of 1 indicates a coupling. Receptors
  are rearranged according to the number of G protein families activated. Gα15 has
  been considered apart from the Gq/11 family due to its promiscuous nature. See  that
  shows the concentration-response curves of the 100 receptors for the 15 different
  pathways.
