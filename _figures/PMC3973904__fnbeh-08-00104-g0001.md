caption: 'Cholesterol metabolism, lipid rafts and autism spectrum disorders. (A) Lipid
  rafts link cholesterol metabolism to synaptic signaling. Cellular cholesterol is
  synthesized from acetyl-CoA in a multistep pathway, with HMGCR and SQLE as the rate-limiting
  enzymes. In the adult brain, cholesterol synthesis is attenuated in neurons that
  rely on astrocyte derived cholesterol. Cholesterol and ApoE synthesized in astrocytes
  are secreted in an ABCA1 dependent process, forming discoidal lipoprotein particles.
  ApoE is a ligand for LDLR family members, which mediate neuronal lipoprotein uptake,
  thereby providing a supply of cholesterol to neurons. Excess cholesterol is hydroxylated
  by CYP46A1 to 24-OHC, which diffuses into the circulation. In astrocytes, 24-OHC
  binds to LXRs, which upregulate ApoE and ABCA1 expression. Cholesterol synthesis
  is also linked to the mevalonate pathway and produces Farnesyl-PP, which induces
  protein prenylation, a posttranslational modification that is important for the
  function of signaling proteins such as Ras and thus modulates protein synthesis.
  A mutated SQLE attenuates phenotypes of animal model of the ASD Rett syndrome (Buchovecky
  et al., ). Statins act at HMGCR and benefit animal models of Rett syndrome and other
  ASDs including fragile X syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 through inhibition
  of cholesterol synthesis and mevalonate pathway (Li et al., ; Buchovecky et al.,
  ; Osterweil et al., ). Cholesterol is not evenly distributed in cell membranes.
  Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol. A great number of

  of postsynaptic signaling molecules, protein trafficking and communication between
  the cell membrane and cytoplasma. They modulate the function of ionotropic receptors,
  G protein coupled receptors, voltage-gated ion channels as well as neurotransmitter
  transporters. Caveolae, a subset of lipid rafts that are flask-shaped membrane invaginations
