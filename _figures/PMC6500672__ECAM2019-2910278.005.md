caption: Putative suppressive pathway of Pj-ME in displaying its anti-inflammatory
  response. It is considered that Pj-ME targets the activation of protein tyrosine
  kinases such as JAK and Src and Syk linked to the activation of intracellular signaling
  pathway for the nuclear translocation of NF-κBand STAT3. Suppression of this pathway
  leads to the downregulation of iNOS-mediated NO production and the expression of
  other cytokines such as NO and IL-6.
