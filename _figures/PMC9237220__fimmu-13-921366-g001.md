caption: Activin A signaling pathway. A simplified illustration of the canonical and
  non-canonical signaling pathways of activin A. All the pathways are initiated by
  the formation of the activin A-heteropolymer receptor complex. The canonical pathway
  is Smad-dependent, while the non-canonical pathway can be mediated by ERK1/2, p38,
  Wnt, or PI3K. Endogenous ligand follistatin and activin family member inhibin can
  both bind to activin A directly to avoid the formation of activin A-heteropolymer
  receptors complex. Inhibin can also compete for the type II receptor. Antibodies
  targeting ALK4 are able to suppress downstream pathways as well. Created with BioRender.com.
