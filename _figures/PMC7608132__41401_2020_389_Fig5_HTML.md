caption: Proposed metabolic pathway of alflutinib in HLMs. The structure of 13 metabolites
  were showed. Except for M224, M486, M497, M554-1 and AST5902, the exact modified
  positions of other metabolites remained unclear
papertitle: Alflutinib (AST2818), primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, is a potent CYP3A4
  inducer.
