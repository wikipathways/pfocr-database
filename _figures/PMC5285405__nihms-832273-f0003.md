caption: Viruses exploit host proteasome pathway for immune evasion. Intrinsic immune
  response (blue) include proteins of PML-NBs or the DDR that are targeted for proteasome-mediated
  degradation by several viruses (see text). Innate immune (pink) DNA sensors DNAPKcs
  and IFI16 are both targeted for degradation by HSV-1 viral protein ICP0. Immune
  response pathway components (within grey shading of cell) are targeted for degradation
  by several viruses. Viral proteins are represented by red circles. Dotted lines
  represent movement.
