caption: Toll signaling integrates DAMPs and PAMPs. At least four different extracellular
  pathways activate Spätzle proteolytically. The first comprises a cascade of serine
  proteases, which defines dorso-ventral polarity in the developing egg. Gastrulation
  defective (GD), Snake (SNK), and Easter (Ea) induce the hydrolytic cleavage of Spätzle
  on the ventral side of the embryo. DAMPs can be sensed by Persephone (Psh) as shown
  for a model with defects in apoptosis. The proteolytic cleavage of Psh by the fungal
  protease PR1 renders it active as well. The pattern recognition receptor GNBP3 (Gram
  negative bacteria binding protein 3) senses β-1,3 glucan-stretches from fungal cell
  walls parallel to PAMPs. The Toll pathway is also required for resistance toward
  Gram-positive bacteria due to the recognition of polymeric Lys-type PGN by PGRP-SA,
  PGRP-SD, and GNBP1. Whereas the downstream signaling of the Toll-activating pattern
  recognition receptors (PRRs) converge on the modular serine protease (ModSP), the
  Persephone-mediated Damage-signal will be integrated by the secreted Sphinx1/2-,
  Spheroide- and Spirit-serine proteases, resulting in the activation of the Spätzle-activating
  enzyme (SPE). In contrast to the extracellular multistep activation cascade of the
  Toll-pathway, the stimulation of Imd-signaling is achieved by direct binding of
  PGN to receptor dimers. PGRP-LE, PGRP-LF, PGRP-SC1a/b, PGRP-SC2, and PGRP-LB all
  share regulatory functions. Similar to Psh-activation by PR1-hydrolysis, PGRP-LC
  can be activated after cleavage by Der p 1 [modified after (; )].
