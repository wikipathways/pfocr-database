caption: Effects of Zoledronic acid on the bone metastatic niche and the “vicious
  cycle of bone metastases”. Breast cancer cells arrive in the haematopoietic stem
  cell and peri-vascular niches in bone. Stimulation of these niches promotes metastatic
  outgrowth of tumour cells which emit growth factors stimulating activity of osteoclasts
  and osteoblasts. In turn, bone resorption leads to the release of bone bound growth
  factors into the local microenvironment that further stimulate tumour growth and
  expansion of the metastatic niches. ZOL interrupts this process, directly inhibiting
  expansion of the metastatic niches and impeding activity of osteoclasts through
  inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. Blue arrows indicate pro metastatic processes,
  red bars indicate metastatic inhibition by ZOL. (For interpretation of the references
  to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
  article.)
