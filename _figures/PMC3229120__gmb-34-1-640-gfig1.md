caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic routes leading from L-phenylalanine to phenylpropylamino
  alkaloids in khat. A CoA-independent, non-β-oxidative pathway of L-phenylalanine
  side chain-shortening is shown in blue, whereas a CoA-dependent, β-oxidative route
  is shown in purple. Red arrows indicate an alternative CoA-dependent, non-β-oxidative
  route suggested to occur in some plants (; ). Either benzoic acid or benzoyl-CoA
  undergoes condensation with pyruvate, a reaction putatively catalyzed by a ThDP-dependent
  enzyme. 1-Phenylpropane-1,2-dione undergoes transamination to yield (S)-cathinone,
  which is reduced to (1S,2S)-cathine and (1R,2S)-norephedrine. Activity has been
  detected for enzymes highlighted in yellow, and corresponding genes are available
  for enzymes highlighted in green. Enzymes highlighted in red have not been isolated,
  although EST analysis revealed numerous potential candidates (). Catha edulis ESTs
  putatively involved in this pathway have been identified for many steps, and candidates
  are listed in . Abbreviations: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; CoA, Coenzyme A;
  ThDP, thiamine diphosphate; NAD(H), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADP(H),
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.'
