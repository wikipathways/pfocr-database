caption: 'HDL undergoes substantial modification during an acute-phase response. Inflammatory
  cytokines induce the hepatic expression of acute-phase SAA and group IIa sPLA2,
  which leads to the formation of HDL particles that are relatively enriched in SAA
  and depleted of apoA-I and phospholipid. Increased oxidative stress during inflammation
  generates HDL that contains oxidatively modified apoA-I. In addition, HDL remodelling
  during inflammation generates an abundance of triglycerides and a loss of HDL-associated
  proteins such as apoA-II, CETP, LCAT, PAF-AH, and PON. Results from studies investigating
  the effect of inflammation on steps in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway
  have been conflicting. During inflammation, cellular cholesterol efflux by ABCA1
  and ABCG1 might be unchanged, decreased, or increased, and the uptake by SCARB1
  of CEs from acute-phase HDL into the liver for subsequent excretion is either decreased
  or unchanged. Abbreviations: ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; ABCG1,
