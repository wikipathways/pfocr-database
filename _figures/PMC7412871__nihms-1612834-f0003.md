caption: Transcriptional Regulators of Ca2+ Homeostasis. (A) Upon ligand binding to
  receptors such as GPCR/RTK, Gαq activates PLC to breakdown PIP2 into InsP3 and DAG.
  InsP3 binds to InsP3R which facilitates Ca2+ release from ER store into the cytosol.
  DAG activates PKC, which is further activated by increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels.
  PKC. PKC, then, facilitates 3 transcription regulating cascades. First, PKC phosphorylates
  IκK which facilitates the breakdown of p100 into p52 which is an active transcription
  factor within NFκB pathway. Subsequently, p52/RelB dimer translocates to nucleus,
  leading to transcription of NFκB-associated genes. Second, PKC activates calcineurin,
  which complexes with Ca2+/calmodulin regulated protein phosphatase (CaM) to dephosphorylate
  NFAT. Dephosphorylated NFAT translocates to nucleus to facilitate NFAT-associated
  genes, including EGR genes among others. Third, PKC phosphorylates Raf, which activates
  MAPK pathway. ERK translocates to nucleus and binds to Elk1 substrate, facilitating
  transcription of EGR1, among other MAPK-associated genes. EGR1 activates ER Ca2+
  sensor, STIM, which binds to PM Orai Ca2+ channel, which promotes SOCE upon ER Ca2+
  store depletion. (B) NFAT protein broken up by regions (NHR-NFAT Homology Region,
  RHD- Rel-Homology Domain, C-Terminal Domain) which are further broken into sub-domains.
  NHR consists of Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) binding site, Transactivation Domain (TAD),
  Calcineurin Docking Sites (CDS1, CDS2), Serine-Rich Regions (SRR1, SRR2), 4 Serine-Rich
  Motifs (Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and KTS), a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) and Nuclear
  Export Signal (NES).
