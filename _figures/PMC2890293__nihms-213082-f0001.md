caption: The chemoreceptor signaling pathway in E. coli. Components and reactions
  in red promote counter clockwise (CCW) flagellar rotation; those in green promote
  clockwise (CW) flagellar rotation. Components in gray represent inactive forms.
  Solid lines represent enzymatic reactions; broken lines indicate binding interactions.
  CheA-derived phosphoryl groups are shown as blue spheres. Receptor modification
  sites are shown as white (unmethylated) and black (methylated) circles.
