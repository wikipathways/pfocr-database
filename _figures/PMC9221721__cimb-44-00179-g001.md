caption: 'cAMP signalling pathway in biological control. GRCRs: G-protein coupled
  receptors; AC: Adenylate cyclase; PDE: Phosphodiesterase; PKA: cAMP-dependent protein
  kinase A; TFs: Transcription factors; CWDES: Cell-wall-degrading enzymes. Pathogen-related
  signals are transmitted into cells through GPCRs, activate G-proteins, and then
  stimulate AC. The activated AC converts ATP to cAMP, then, cAMP stimulates PKA,
  and finally, the activated PKA regulates the expression activities of downstream
  proteins, such as transcription factors, resulting in the biocontrol of pathogens.'
