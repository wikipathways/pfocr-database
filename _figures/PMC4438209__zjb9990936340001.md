caption: Schematic presentation of the proposed phenylacetic acid (PAA) degradation
  pathway and l-Phg biosynthetic pathway. The PAA degradation pathway and l-Phg biosynthetic
  pathway are indicated by blue and red arrows, respectively. PglA, hydroxyacyl-dehydrogenase;
  PglB, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component α-subunit; PglC, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  E1 component β-subunit; PglD, thioesterase type II; PglE, phenylglycine aminotransferase;
  SnbE, pristinamycin I (PI) synthase 3 and 4; PaaABCDE, ring 1,2-phenylacetyl-CoA
  epoxidase subunits; PaaF, 2,3-dehydroadipyl-CoA hydratase; PaaG, ring 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA
  isomerase, oxepin-CoA forming; PaaH, 3-hydroxyadipyl-CoA dehydrogenase; PaaJ, 3-oxoadipyl-CoA/3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA
  thiolase; PaaK, phenylacetyl-CoA ligase; PaaZ, fused oxepin-CoA hydrolase–3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA
  semialdehyde dehydrogenase.
