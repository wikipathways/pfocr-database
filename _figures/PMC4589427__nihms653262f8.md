caption: (A) TGF-β induces fibulin-3 expression and secretion. Fibulin-3 inhibits
  TGF-β signaling by interaction with TβRI, blocking complex formation with TβRII
  and downstream signaling. (B) Fibulin-3 expression decreases during breast cancer
  progression, with decreased fibulin-3 promoting TGF-β signaling in breast cancer
  cells and endothelial cells, and in turn promoting EMT, migration, invasion in breast
  cancer cells and endothelial permeability, collectively promoting metastasis.
