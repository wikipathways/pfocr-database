caption: AGS genes cooperate to metabolize reverse transcription products of endogenous
  retroelements. A schematic of the retroviral reverse transcription process is shown.
  SAMHD1, an AGS gene and HIV-1 restriction factor, prevents the initiation of reverse
  transcription by controlling dNTP availability to RT enzymes. A speculative role
  for RNaseH2 in degrading the RNA strand of RNA/DNA hybrids is depicted. Trex1 can
  block retrotransposition by metabolizing the reverse-transcribed DNA of retroelements.
  Failure to metabolize these viral nucleic acids may trigger the ISD pathway through
  accumulation of RNA/DNA hybrids or reverse-transcribed DNA.
