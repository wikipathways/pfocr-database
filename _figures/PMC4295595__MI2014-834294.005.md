caption: Schematic representation of the effect of quercetin on obesity-induced skeletal
  muscle inflammation and muscle atrophy. Obesity leads to infiltration of macrophages
  and increases FFA in skeletal muscle. Macrophages release inflammatory cytokines
  and/or directly contact muscle cells, leading to activation of inflammatory signaling
  pathways, which are also induced by binding of FFA to TLRs. The inflammatory signaling
  pathway induces expression of atrogenes. This leads to loss of muscle mass, and
  these changes ultimately contribute to local and systemic insulin resistance. Quercetin
  inhibits macrophage infiltration and activation of inflammatory pathways, leading
  to diminished expression of atrophic genes.
