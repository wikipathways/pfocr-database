caption: The 3 key differences between ISC1 and CG that are shared between genome
  and metabolome. 1. Argininosuccinate (ASS) has a lower genomic copy number in ISC1
  vs CG. More citrulline and less argininosuccinate were detected in ISC1, suggesting
  a corresponding downregulation of the ASS protein. Although the urea cycle might
  be incomplete in Leishmania, links have been established with Trypanothione biosynthesis
  and virulence. 2. Several glycerophospholipid (or precursor) biosynthetic enzymes
  had higher gene copy numbers in ISC1 which could be linked to increased GPL amounts
  (See also ). 3. More copies of a p1/s1 nuclease gene were found in ISC1, associated
  with higher concentrations of several salvage pathway metabolites. Genomic copy
  number information is underlined and in bold. Pathway names are in italics. Arrows
  in grey represent potentially missing enzymes in the urea cycle of Leishmania. Blue = down
  in ISC1, Red = up in ISC1. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
