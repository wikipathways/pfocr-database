caption: Interactions between DNA tumour viruses and the DNA damage response. DNA
  tumour viruses manipulate or harness PIKK signalling for viral benefit. (a) ATM
  signalling is activated in response to double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). The MRN
  sensor responds to DSBs and activates ATM phosphorylation of downstream substrates.
  MRN can be targeted by some viruses (e.g. adenovirus), while other viruses recruit
  the complex to viral replication centres (VRC). Some viruses activate and harness
  ATM signalling for efficient infection. (b) Signalling through DNA-PK is activated
  by recognition of DSBs by the Ku70/Ku80 complex and results in DNA repair by non-homologous
  end joining. Adenovirus suppresses the DNA-PK pathway in multiple ways. (c) The
  ATR pathway responds to prolonged exposed single-stranded DNA. Adenovirus, Kaposi's
  sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) inhibit components
  of the ATR pathway, but ATR proteins associate with replication centres of several
  viruses. (d) The γ-herpesviruses KSHV and EBV activate the ATM pathway for lytic
  reactivation, but inhibit ATM to establish latency. Examples of viral proteins known
  to target these pathways are indicated.
