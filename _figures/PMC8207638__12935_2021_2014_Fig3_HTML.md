caption: Metabolomic profiles related to glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.
  A Changes in the glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)/ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) ratio between
  primary cancer (PC) and omental metastatic cancer (OMC). B Metabolite changes related
  to glycolysis and the PPP. Changes in the concentration of each metabolite in OMC
  are shown relative to the corresponding PC. C Changes in the lactate/pyruvate ratio
  between PC and OMC. Error bars represent standard errors of the mean. F6P, fructose
  6-phosphate; F1,6P, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  Ru5P, ribulose 5-phosphate; X5P, D-xylulose 5-phosphate; S7P, sedoheptulose 7-phosphate;
  E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate
