caption: Myostatin and activin signaling pathway in muscle. (A) Myostatin and activin
  A bind to the activin type IIB receptor (ActRIIB) on muscle cell membranes, resulting
  in phosphorylation of Smad2. The phosphorylated Smad2 induces satellite cell quiescence
  and the dephosphorylation of transcription factor FOXO3a, which consequently moves
  into the nucleus and activates the transcription of E3 ubiquitin ligase, MuRF1,
  and Atrogin-1. These muscle-atrophy enzymes provide the specificity that causes
  the degradation of muscles leading to cachexia. (B) Using a soluble form of the
  activin type IIB receptor, sActRIIB, the effect of myostatin/activin A signaling
  is blocked, resulting in a decrease in phosphorylated Smad2, an increase in satellite
  cell proliferation, and a decrease in ubiquitin enzymes. Blocking this pathway can
  lead to muscle hypertrophy and reversal of cachexia [].
