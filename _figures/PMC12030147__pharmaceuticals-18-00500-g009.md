caption: Ginsenoside Rb1 alleviates ventricular remodeling in HF by regulating the
  Twist1/PGC-1α/PPARα signaling pathway. In the hearts of rats with HF, there is an
  increase in the expression of cTnT and ACTN2. Additionally, there is an elevation
  in atrial and ventricular pressures, accompanied by an increased secretion of ANP
  and BNP. Myocardial cell damage occurs, inhibiting glucose transport (reduced GLUT4
  synthesis), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. This dysfunction manifests as
  a decrease in MMP, reduced ATP synthesis, and decreased ETC productivity efficiency,
  resulting in disordered energy metabolism. Furthermore, an abnormally high expression
  of Twist1 is observed, which inhibits the expression of PGC-1α, PPARα, and PPARγ,
  thereby exacerbating cardiac injury
