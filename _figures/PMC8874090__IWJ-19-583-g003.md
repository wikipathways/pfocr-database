  improves angiogenesis via up‐regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A
  (VEGFA) and heparin binding EGF like growth factor (HBEGF). LncRNA‐H19 combines
  miR‐152‐3p or miR‐29b to increase the protein expression of phosphatase and tensin
  homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) or fibrillin 1 (FBN1), resulting in up‐regulation
  of fibroblast proliferation and migration. Furthermore, lncRNA‐H19 recruits enhancer
  of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) to bind with H3K4, increasing the expression of histone
  H3K4me4, which can bind to the promoter of hypoxia induced factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) and
  promote the transcription of HIF‐1α, thus promoting diabetic wound healing by up‐regulating
  angiogenesis, collagen deposition and fibroblast proliferation. H19 may also elevate
  connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression by recruiting serum response factor
  (SRF) to the promoter region of CTGF, thus accelerating fibroblast proliferation,
  ECM remodelling and wound healing. LncRNA‐ANRIL sponges miR‐181a to reduce its targeted
  inhibition on Prospero Homeobox 1 (Prox1), thus promoting lymphatic angiogenesis.
  LncRNA‐MALAT1 promotes diabetic wound healing not only through sponging miR‐152‐3p
  to ameliorate angiogenesis, but also facilitating fibroblast viability through HIF‐1α
  pathway. LncRNA‐IGF2AS inhibits the proliferation and migration of mMVE to impair
  angiogenesis by negatively regulating insulin‐like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and VEGFA.
  Lnc‐URIDS interacts with protein procollagen‐lysine, 2‐oxoglutarate 5‐dioxygenase
  1 (Plod 1) to reduce its protein stability, thus down‐regulating collagen deposition.
  LncRNA‐TETILA restrains the ubiquitin degradation of TET protein to promote its
  stable expression, and ten‐eleven translocation 2 (TET2) further binds with thymine‐DNA
  glycosylase (TDG) to mediate the demethylation of matrix metalloprotein 9 (MMP‐9)
  promoter, promoting the expression of MMP‐9 protein, decreasing the formation of
  collagen and impairing wound healing. LncEGFL7OS recruits and binds with MAX to
  enhance the transcription of EGFL7/miR‐126 gene, therefore promoting angiogenesis
