  cerevisiae. Genetic modifications are noted by thick arrows. Red arrows indicate
  the heterologous lycopene biosynthetic pathway consisting of CrtE, CrtB and CrtI,
  which starts either from FPP (solid arrow) or directly from IPP and DMAPP (dashed
  arrow). The enzyme overexpressed in the described lycopene-producing strain is highlighted
  in blue. b Construction of plasmids and integration modules. c The rationale of
