caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway for the ganglio-series of glycosphingolipids. Gangliosides
  are named according to the simplified nomenclature of Svennerholm (): the “ganglio”
  core containing four saccharide residues is designated by the letter G, followed
  by a letter designating the total number of sialic acids (M, mono; D, di; T, tri;
  Q, tetra; P, penta; A, asilo, none). The following number represents the length
  of the ganglio core, with 1 representing the full four-saccharide core, and shorter
  structures having higher numbers. Lower case letters designate the number of sialic
  acids linked to the internal Gal residue (a=1, b=2) and Greek letters indicate number
  of sialic acids linked to the GalNAc residue (α=1, β=2). Glycosyltransferase genes
  are represented by boxes. Gangliosides are represented by circles. Shade code represent
  gene expression and ganglioside level changes found in the present study: light
  grey indicates changes in the R6/1 transgenic mouse; black indicates changes in
  human HD caudate; dark grey, indicates changes in both, human and mouse. Based on
  KEGG Pathway Database, reference pathway mim00604 (www.kegg.com/kegg/pathway.html)'
