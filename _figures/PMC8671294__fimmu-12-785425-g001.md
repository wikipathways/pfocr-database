caption: 'Mechanisms underlying purinergic signaling pathways in the regulation of
  gout flares and resolution. A series of purinergic receptor-mediated intracellular
  signaling events in macrophages are involved in gout flare and resolution, with
  the regulation of IL-1β levels being a central event. Gout flare: (A) The binding
  of extracellular MSU to TLR induces intracellular transcription and accumulation
  of the pro-IL-1β gene through activation of MyD88-NFκB signaling. (B) The uptake
  of MSU then activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, releasing active caspase-1, which
  cleaves pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β. (C) Increased extracellular ATP binds to P2X7
  receptors causing Ca2+ influx, which stimulates the NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  in concert with MSU, leading to massive IL-1β secretion. (D) Extracellular ATP and
  ADP stimulate the P2Y1-like receptors coupled to Gq, activating the PLC-IP3/DAG-PKC
  signaling pathway and cAMP-PKA pathway, which promotes the release of IL-1β. The
  stimulation of P2Y12-like receptors coupled to Gi exerts an inhibitory effect on
  the AC-cAMP-PKA pathway reducing the IL-1β production. However, inhibition of IL-1β
  production via other pathways also exists. Gout resolution: (E) In an inflammatory
  hypoxic environment, the activation of CD39 and CD73 during gout flares results
  in the progressive degradation of ATP and ADP to adenosine. (F) The resultant adenosine
  activates P1 receptors, decreasing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β,
  thus, promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF-β1 and IL-10.
  (G) Under the inflammatory conditions of gout, ATP is degraded, which affects the
  sustained stimulation of the P2X7R-NLRP3 signaling pathway. This results in a marked
  reduction of IL-1β secretion by MSU stimulation alone, which is not sufficient to
  sustain gout, and the condition then tends toward inflammatory remission.'
