caption: The accuracy of end joining. (A) The fidelity of C-NHEJ on fully (left panel)
  or incompletely (right panel) complementary ends. Here, examples are given with
  ends generated by the meganuclease I-SceI. The cleavage sites are not palindromic
  therefore 2 I-SceI cleavage sites in the same orientations yield fully complementary
  ends (left panel), whereas 2 I-SceI cleavage sites in inverted orientation yield
  incompletely complementary overhangs (right panel). A-EJ leads to deletions with
  both types of DNA ends. C-NHEJ is mainly error-free on fully complementary ends
  and uses 3 classes of imperfect annealing (3 out of the 4 3′ protruding nucleotides
  generated by I-SceI cleavage) with non-fully complementary ends. Thus, C-NHEJ is
  conservative but adaptable for incompletely complementary ends. (B) The actual accuracy
  of end joining. A-EJ is highly mutagenic in all situations but it is blocked by
  C-NHEJ, which can act on imperfectly complementary ends. In situations producing
  non-ligatable ends, such as hairpins in V(D)J recombination or IR-induced multiple
  damages at DSBs, a preliminary processing step is required prior to end joining.
  Note that in these cases, diversity or mutagenesis is generated by the processing
  step rather than the end-joining machinery. (C) Chromothripsis. The religation of
  shattered chromosomes in small pieces (colored squares) leads to a combination of
  rearranged chromosomes in addition to amplification and loss of the small pieces.
  (D) A model for chromothripsis arising through MMBIR (microhomology-mediated break
  induced replication). Resection of the DNA double-strand end generates a 3′ overhang,
  which can anneal another DNA molecule (in red) through the use of microhomologies
  (blue squares), thus priming DNA synthesis (dotted arrow). This mechanism can lead
  to more complex rearrangements if it is coupled to multiple cycles of disassembly
  and template switches of the replication forks (right panel), still using microhomologies.
