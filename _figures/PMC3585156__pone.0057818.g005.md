caption: Net inhibits the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell by inhibiting
  the expression of c-fos, subsequently inactivating the transcription activity of
  AP-1, followed by activation of p21 to antagonize the effects of Cyclin D/CDK4 on
  cell cycle progression, and ultimately leading to cell death. On the contrary, phosphorylation
  of Net is activated by intra or extracellular stimulation signals through Ras-MAPKs
  pathway, which results in downregulation of Net expression and lack of inhibitory
  ability on c-fos transcription, thus promoting cell proliferation.
