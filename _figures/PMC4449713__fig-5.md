caption: The FOXO transcription factors regulate expression of autophagy genes. Conditions
  that stimulate autophagy, including caloric restriction or glucose deprivation,
  result in activation of FOXO1 and FOXO3 by AMPK and SIRT1. Active FOXOs translocate
  from the cytosol to the nucleus and initiate transcription of autophagy gene products.
  In contrast, suppression of autophagy and FOXO activity via the insulin receptor/PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway leads to acetylation of FOXOs, as well as to phosphorylation of
  FOXOs by AKT. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the web
