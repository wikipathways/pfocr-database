caption: Pro-inflammatory C-X-C motif chemokines (CXCs) play a crucial role in the
  progression and development of breast cancer in aged patients, postmenopausal women,
  animal models, and senescent cells. (A1) The overexpression of CXCL1 leads to invasion
  and migration in breast cancer cells through the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB)/SRY-box
  transcription factor 4 (SOX4) pathway. On the other hand, a high number of CXC chemokines
  are associated with the expression of osteopontin (OPN), which promotes tumor invasiveness
  and progression and reduces the overall survival (OS) rate. (A2) In the breast cancer
  mouse model, the primary breast cancer alters the lipid metabolism of lung fibroblasts
  by acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA) down-regulation. Lung fibroblasts convert
  to a senescent phenotype, which increases the recruitment of granulocyte myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) by CXCL1 production, which induces an inflammatory lung
  microenvironment. (B1) Therapy-induced senescent epithelial cells can secrete senescence-associated
  secretory phenotype (SASP) factors that promote the invasion of breast cancer cells
  through the CXCL11/CXCR3/Ak strain transforming (AKT)/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) pathway. (B2) In older breast cancer patients, the secretion of TILRR
  (FREM1 isoform 2) is positively associated with the presence of immune cells like
  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD86+ M1 macrophages, and the expression levels of CXCL10
  and CXCL11. These factors are believed to be indicative of poor OS and recurrence-free
  survival (RFS). (C) The angiotensin II type I receptor (AGTR1) signaling regulates
  breast cancer migration and lymph node metastasis through the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway.
  AGTR1 increases the level of CXCL12 in the lymph node, which attracts tumors that
  highly express CXCR4 cells. The mechanism behind AGTR1-induced migration and invasion
  of tumor cells involves up-regulating CXC12/CXCR4, Via focal adhesion kinase (FAK),
  and Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) molecules. (D) An aged breast cancer
  patient secretes a significant amount of CXCL13/CXCR5, which leads to lymph node
  metastasis, vascular invasion, and increased breast cancer cell survival
