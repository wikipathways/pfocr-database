caption: 'The two representative networks by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) for
  differentially methylated whole gene set derived from HF-dNK-treated EVT. (a) Extracellular
  signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) was centered in one of the top
  network pathways, and Claudin-4 (CLDN4) was revolved this pathway. (b) Protein kinase
  B (AKT) was centered in another top network pathway, and fucosyltransferase IV (FUT4)
  was revolved this pathway. The analyses indicate that the differentially methylated
  genes from HF-dNK-treated EVT are located in pathways related to cellular development,
  cellular function and maintenance, and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, revolving
  around key cellular proteins AKT and Erk1/2. The color intensity of node indicates
  the degree of hyper- or hypo-methylation. Genes encoding for molecules in red are
  hypermethylated while those in green are hypomethylated relative to control EVT.
  The shape of each node denotes the molecule class displayed beside each figure.
