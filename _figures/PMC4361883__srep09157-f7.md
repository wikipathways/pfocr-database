caption: RuPOP entered into the cells through TfR-mediated endocytosis, accumulated
  in lysosomes in 3 h, and diffused in the cytoplasm from 6 h to 12 h. The internalized
  RuPOP suppressed FAK-mediated ERK and Akt activation, leading to the alternation
  of the expression levels of the downstream metastatic regulatory proteins, including
  uPA, uPAR, MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1. Down-regulation of the levels of the uPA and
  uPAR influenced the activation of plasminogen to plasmin and the cleavage of MMPs,
  resulting in the decrease of VEGF release. In addition, inactivation of ERK and
  Akt promoted TRAIL-induced apoptosis via activation of caspase cascade and cleavage
  of PARP.
