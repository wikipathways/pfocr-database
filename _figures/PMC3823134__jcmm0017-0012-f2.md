caption: Schematic pathway of different steps of autophagy. Autophagy is initiated
  by the nucleation of an isolation membrane or phagophore. Autophagy is subdivided
  into induction, elongation and maturation steps and the role of Atg proteins and
  Bcl2 anti-apoptotic proteins is shown in each step. Beclin1 and its interrelating
  associate, class III PI3-K, are required for autophagy induction. Bcl2 anti-apoptotic
  proteins (Bcl2/Bcl-XL) can attach to Beclin1 and inhibit autophagy. Class I PI3K
  can negatively control autophagy through mTOR. The initiated isolation membrane
  (phagophore) then elongates and closes on itself to form an autophagosome. During
  starvation, this process is initiated by the ULK1/2 complex, the activity of which
  is controlled by the mTORC1 complex. The Beclin1/hVps34/Atg14L complex, Atg9L1 and
  WIPI proteins (human orthologs of the yeast Atg18) contribute to the nucleation
  of the phagophore. Atg12 pathway and LC3 (Atg8) lipidation control the elongation
  and shape of autophagosomes. Atg12 is essential for the formation of autophagosomal
  precursors and membrane isolation. Atg7 activates Atg12; activated Atg12 is transferred
  to Atg10 and conjugated to Atg5 and, finally, a complex is formed with Atg16. The
  Atg12–Atg5–Atg16 complex is required for recruitment of LC3-II. After autophagosome
  formation, Atg4 cleaves LC3-II to generate LC3-I. Atg7 activates LC3-I and transfers
  it to Atg3. The remaining membrane-attached LC3-II is degraded by lysosomal proteases.
  Rab7, SNARES and ESCRT are involved in the intracellular trafficking along the endocytic
  pathway. LAMP-1/2 and ATPases are membrane constituents of the endolysosomal compartment.
  DRAM protein is a lysosomal membrane protein. The Beclin1-hVps34-UVRAG complex positively
  regulates the maturation of autophagosomes. When associated with the protein Rubicon,
  it down-regulates autophagosome maturation.
