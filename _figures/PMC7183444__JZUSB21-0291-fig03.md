caption: Hypoxia/re-oxygenation-related KEGG pathway and differentially expressed
  genes(a) von Willebrand factor (VWF), complement component 1, q subcomponent, A
  chain (C1QA), and complement and coagulation cascades pathway. On the map of the
  complement and coagulation cascades pathway, endothelial cell injury marker VWF,
  which is significantly down-expressed in hypoxia/re-oxygenation group in our database,
  plays an important role in thrombogenesis, endothelial permeability, and anti-inflammatory
  responses. C1QA, which is significantly up-expressed in the hypoxia/re-oxygenation
  group in our database, initiates the complement cascade and is involved in cell
  lysis, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis. The migration, aggregation, and phagocytosis
  of neutrophils are the important mechanisms leading to the large release of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) during ischemia-reperfusion injury. (b) Chemokine (C-C motif)
  ligand 3-like 3 (CCL3L3), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4-like 2 (CCL4L2), chemokine
  (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), and chemokine
  signaling pathway. Significantly down-expressed chemokines CCL3L3 and CCL4L2 and
  significantly up-expressed chemokine receptor CXCR4 are the initiating molecules
  of the chemokine signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial in cellular growth and
  differentiation, cell survival and apoptosis, ROS and nitric oxide (NO) production.
  WAS, which is on one branch involved in regulation of actin cytoskeleton, is significantly
  down-expressed in the hypoxia/re-oxygenation group in our database
