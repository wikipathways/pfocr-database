caption: The figure depicts the action mechanism of anti-cancer drugs which regulate
  directly or indirectly Cyto C expression. The data were obtained from the PubChem
  database and a pathway was analyzed using KEGG pathway analysis. (A) Describes the
  inhibition of Cyto C expression in cancer conditions (B) Activation of Cyto C by
  anti-cancer drugs.
