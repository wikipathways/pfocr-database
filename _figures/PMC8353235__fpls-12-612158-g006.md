caption: Functional complementation of GmPEAMTs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (A,B)
  Heterologous complementation of PCho-dependent growth of the S. cerevisiae cho2
  opi3 mutant. Yeast mutant strain cho2 opi3 harboring empty vectors (negative controls),
  Arabidopsis PEAMT1 (positive controls), GmPEAMT1, GmPEAMT2, AtPLMT, GmPEAMT1+AtPLMT,
  and GmPEAMT2+AtPLMT were grown on agar supplemented with minimal media and 2% (w/v)
  galactose, and 0-mM ethanolamine (CK) or 1-mM ethanolamine (EA) or 1-mM monomethylethanolamine
  (MEA) or 1-mM choline (CHO). These transformants were grown at 37°C for 3 days.
  Different transformants and additives are indicated at the left and the top of the
  images, respectively (C,D). The currently proposed PC biosynthesis pathway in S.
