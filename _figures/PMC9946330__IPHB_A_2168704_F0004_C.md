caption: 'The extended effect of carboxyatractyloside (CATR) on mitochondria. (a)
  In the absence of CATR, the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) is primarily employed as an antiporter
  of nucleotide metabolites, although free fatty acids (FFAs), which are prospective
  activators of H+ leak via AAC and uncoupling protein (UCP), are present in the inner
  mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Efficient active mitochondrial nucleoside diphosphate
  kinase (NDPK) continuously generates ADP and GTP using ATP and GDP as substrates
  via the ''ping-pong'' mechanism. The ADP pool induces oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS), which translates into a low H+ gradient, originally generated by the respiratory
  chain (RC), due to the effect of its consumption by FOF1-ATP synthase (FOF1). Although
  the access of UCP to GDP is limited, this transporter is quite strongly inhibited.
  First, a physiological need for mild uncoupling does not exist under OXPHOS conditions.
  Second, the NDPK-mediated transphosphorylation of GDP produces GTP, i.e., the weaker
  negative regulator of UCP is substituted with the stronger inhibitor in the intermembrane
  space of the mitochondria toward which UCP exposes the PN-binding site. The indirect
  exclusion of UCP activity by NDPK, residing in the intermembrane space, does not
  cause net energy losses in cells. Specifically, NDPK consumes ATP but delivers precious
  GTP and additionally rescues the H+ gradient from dissipation via UCP. AAC-perpetrated
  mitochondrial H+ conductance is not shown for clarity and due to its minor physiological
  significance during OXPHOS. In mammals and possibly many other organisms, NDPK is
  bound electrostatically to cytosolic-facing and matrix-facing leaflets of the IMM,
  but for simplicity, the schematic transphosphorylation reaction is shown only in
  the intermembrane space and outside of the IMM. The phosphoenzyme intermediate of
  NDPK is also omitted. (b) CATR intoxication. When ADP does not enter the mitochondrial
  matrix because CATR binds to AAC, the electrochemical H+ gradient is much higher
  than that in the model shown in (a). This outcome is due to the almost complete
  but indirect inhibition of FOF1-ATP synthase by CATR. This situation creates perfect
  conditions to initiate uncoupling, which is facilitated and driven by a high H+
  gradient. UCP is not necessarily strongly inhibited; although the GDP concentration
  probably increases, this nucleotide apparently shows lower specificity for UCP,
  and GTP (considered the physiologically relevant inhibitor of UCP) deficiency occurs.
  GTP is not formed abundantly because NDPK, such as FOF1-ATP synthase, is indirectly
  quenched by CATR, which limits the access of the kinase to ATP. Moreover, the overreduction
  of RC favors increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and subsequent lipid
  peroxidation, which is depicted as a ''spiral''. In turn, the reactive aldehyde
  4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), one of the most abundant secondary lipid peroxidation
  end products, becomes an activator of AAC/UCP-dependent H+ leak, which may be partially
  reversed by CATR. Potential AAC-UCP heterodimers may feasibly be restrained by CATR,
  which excludes the full contribution of each carrier protein component to H+ conductance.
  The blockade of AAC-UCP heterodimers by CATR additionally exacerbates the metabolic
  crisis as it eliminates the prominent element of first-line antioxidant defenses.
  Some rescue may be achieved by UCP that is not complexed with AAC, which might be
  involved in the HNE-stimulated pathway of H+ leak. Thus, mainly/only AAC-free UCP
  counteracts CATR-induced oxidative stress by catalyzing a low degree of uncoupling.
  However, UCP-driven ''futile'' H+ passage across the IMM may postpone/minimize the
  adverse symptoms of CATR poisoning. Importantly, the scale of beneficial antioxidative
  H+ leak depends on the relative concentrations of effectors implicated in the promotion
  and inhibition of AAC/UCP-dependent uncoupling. Finally, the substantial ATR/CATR-dependent
  attenuation of ATP regeneration via OXPHOS during acute intoxication negatively
  and irreversibly affects organ structures that are highly sensitive to these glycosides,
  such as the kidney and liver, often leading to the death of humans and animals.
  The direction of H+ movement against or down the electrochemical gradient is indicated
  by the colored arrowhead placed above or below a particular protein component of
  the IMM, and violet arrowhead represents RC activity (a and b), brown represents
  UCP activity (b), and green represents FOF1-ATP synthase activity (a). The red ''X''
  (b) indicates indirect inhibition elicited by CATR, and the dashed black ellipse
