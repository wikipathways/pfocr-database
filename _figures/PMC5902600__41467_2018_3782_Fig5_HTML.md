caption: Working model of RV–cohesin interaction. Host genomic DNA damage induced
  by cohesin deficiency led to an increase in the levels of cytoplasmic DNA, which
  feeds into the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing pathway to activate IFN and ISG expression.
  These processes enable the host cells to enter an antiviral status and render them
  resistant to rotavirus infection. Future studies will focus on whether rotavirus
  has evolved strategies to dampen the host DNA damage response and subsequent IFN
  production. Cohesin is multimeric nuclear protein complex that includes STAG2 and
  is associated with vital roles during cell division. Here, in a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9
  screen, the authors identify a novel role of STAG2 as a crucial component of the
  innate immune response to rotavirus
