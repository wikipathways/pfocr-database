caption: Model of the ERO1α-PDI pathway sustaining oxidative protein folding. The
  ERO1α-PDI catalytic cycle proceeds in the following order of events. (i) Reduced
  PDI binds ERO1α through the specific interaction between the hydrophobic pocket
  in the PDI b′-domain and the protruding β-hairpin of ERO1α such that the redox active
  site of the PDI a′-domain is preferentially oxidized by ERO1α. (ii) Once oxidized,
  PDI converts to the conformation with a more exposed hydrophobic pocket through
  the conformational change of the x-linker region and the subsequent relocation of
  the a′-domain relative to the b′-domain. Oxidized PDI has lower affinity for ERO1α
  than for unfolded substrate proteins. (iii) Consequently, an unfolded protein displaces
  ERO1α, and undergoes PDI-catalyzed oxidation. (iv) If correctly folded, the protein
  dissociates from reduced PDI, which can reenter into step (i) for oxidation by ERO1α.
  Should a non-native disulfide be inserted into the substrate, reduced PDI or other
  PDI family member proteins could act as an isomerase.
