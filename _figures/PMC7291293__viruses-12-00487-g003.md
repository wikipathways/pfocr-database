caption: Summary of caveolae/CAV-1 in signal transduction during virus infection.
  A total of 16 caveolae and CAV-1-related signaling pathways from 11 viruses are
  shown in this figure. Different viruses and involved signaling pathways associated
  with caveolae and CAV-1 are represented in different colors to distinguish among
  complex networks. (A,B) The internalization of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)
  into SK-N-SH cells activates the EGFR-PI3K-RhoA-ROCK-CFL1 signaling pathway and
  leads CAV-1 phosphorylation and furthers Rac1 activation, thereby initiating PAK1-CFL1-mediated
  actin polymerization and JEV internalization []. The entry of Avian reovirus (ARV)
  also takes advantage of the phosphorylation of CAV-1 and Rac1 activation, while
  by activating p38 MAPK and Src kinase []. (C) The transient depolymerization of
  the actin stress fibers causes the formation of actin tails, which depends on the
  local tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolae after SV40 infection [,,,,,]. (D) Venezuelan
  equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) successfully
  cross the BBB with the help of IFN and RhoA GTPase signaling pathways via CAV-1-mediated
  transcytosis []. (E) CAV-1 plays a variety of roles during HIV-1 infection. Tat
  protein can activate the Ras signaling pathway, making HIV successfully cross the
  BBB with the dependency on CAV-1 []. The interaction between CAV-1 and Tat also
  results in less occludin and LRP-1 expression and more RAGE and RhoA production,
  thus making Aβ deposition in the brain []. In addition, CAV-1 restricts HIV infection
  in many ways. Firstly, CAV-1 inhibits HIV-1 replication by suppressing NF-κB p65
  acetylation, which is indispensable for inflammatory response activation []. Secondly,
  CAV-1 could interact with HIV Nef protein to activate cholesterol efflux, thus leading
  to an impaired HIV infectivity []. Besides, Nef protein is also involved in inducing
  CAV-1 phosphorylation and further affecting its redistribution []. Lastly, CAV-1
  reduces HIV infection by interacting with gp41, mainly through inhibition of Env-induced
  membrane hemifusion []. (F) CAV-1 plays a role in tumor angiogenesis through participates
  in VEGF-mediated signaling pathways during HBV infection []. In in vitro transfected
  HBx rather than an actual infection, CAV-1 expression was inhibited by promoting
  the methylation of CpG islands on its promoter region []. (G–J) iNOS, ROS, and p53
  construct a complex network since they are involved in different CAV-1-related pathways
  during virus infections. In the case of HSV infection, CAV-1 plays a positive role
  in the infection via interacting with iNOS to inhibit the production of nitric oxide
  []. During PRRSV infection, less CAV-1 and higher levels of HSP90 are found to be
  responsible for the increasing levels of iNOS. Increased iNOS further results in
  higher ROS generation and endothelial dysfunction []. In CAV-1-lack cells, ROS and
  p53 are upregulated and cause an increase of IVA virion yield during IVA infection
  []. Moreover, the E6 protein of HPV16 could downregulate CAV-1 via p53-inactivating,
  which eventually causes malignant transformation []. Numbers in square brackets
  indicate the relative references.
