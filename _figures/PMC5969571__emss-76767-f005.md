caption: Hypothetical ancestral proto-anabolic network consisting of a hybrid of the
  AcCoA pathway and the rTCA cycle, showing the role of its intermediates as universal
  biosynthetic precursors. The 11 steps of the cycle (A-K) have been assigned colour-coded
  labels according to their chemical mechanism.
