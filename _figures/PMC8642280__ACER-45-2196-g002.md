caption: Schematic showing the timing of the effects of ALC on puberty‐related pathways
  in the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH). Animals were administered either ALC or
  control liquid diets from day 27 through day 33. (A) Effects of ALC on the dynorphin
  (DYN) system. ALC increased the expression of DYN protein by day 29 over the control
  animals, an effect that continued through day 33. Furthermore, by day 31, ALC had
  down‐regulated the expression of the neurokinin B receptor (NK3R), suggesting suppressed
  NKB secretion. The overall effect of this ALC‐induced up‐regulation in DYN protein
  synthesis was also associated with an increase in the expression of the dynorphin
  receptor (KOR‐1) on day 33. B) Effects of ALC on pathways regulating the mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR)/kisspeptin (Kp) synthesis. ALC stimulated the phosphorylation
  of the AMP‐activated protein kinase α (AMPKα)/Raptor pathway by day 29, an action
  known to inhibit mTOR and Kp synthesis. This effect persisted through day 33. Additionally,
  on days 31 and 33, ALC caused the suppression of the stimulatory Akt pathway, further
  suppressing mTOR and Kp synthesis. Note that these effects are all known to cause
  suppressed prepubertal GnRH secretion. Green and red arrows show increases and decreases,
  respectively, in expression/secretion
