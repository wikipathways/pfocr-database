caption: GlcN increases the flux toward apoptosis versus inflammation (anti-apoptotic)
  in combination treatment with TRAIL. The addition of GlcN/TRAIL increases overall
  caspase levels and activates molecules associated with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
  (i.e., SMAC and cytochrome C). GlcN/TRAIL also reduces inflammatory pathways by
  reducing NF-kB levels which are typically stimulated by TRAIL treatment alone.
