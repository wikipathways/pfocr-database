caption: Schematic model for the mechanism and role of HOGA1 in ccRCC. The deletion
  of HOGA1 in ccRCC fosters the accumulation of HOG and suppresses the expression
  of GSK‐3β. This suppression results in a reduction in β‐catenin phosphorylation
  at Thr41, Ser33 and Ser37, thereby increasing β‐catenin accumulation in the Wnt
  signalling pathway. Consequently, an increased β‐catenin translocates to the nucleus,
  enhancing the expression of its downstream target genes, c‐Myc and CyclinD1, and
  ultimately facilitating the growth of ccRCC
