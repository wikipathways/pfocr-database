caption: A schematic illustrating some of the factors proposed to affect obesity and
  carcinogenesis. Obesity is associated with hormonal and inflammatory changes summarised
  under “Mechanism” and including insulin resistance. These factors often act via
  specific “Receptors” which regulate key “Pathways” responsible for the control of
  cell viability, proliferation, migration and death. The kynurenine pathway is activated
  by inflammation and acts via the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) to modulate transcription
  factors and microRNAs relevant to BMI regulation as well as regulating feedback
  on inflammation. Kynurenines can affect feeding directly via glutamate receptors
  (NMDAr) in the brain and possibly via the G-protein coupled receptor GPR35. Fatty
  acid metabolism can affect inflammatory cytokine production and T cell balance in
  the immune system.
