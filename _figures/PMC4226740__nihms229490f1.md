caption: Nitric oxide (NO) by activating soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-cyclic guanosine-3′,5′-monophosphate
  (cGMP) signal transduction pathway mediates various physiological/beneficial effects
  including vasodilation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory, anti-remodeling
  and anti-apoptotic effects. In circulatory shock nitric oxide and superoxide (·O2−)
  react to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which induces cell damage via lipid peroxidation,
  inactivation of enzymes and other proteins by oxidation and nitration and activation
  of stress signaling, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Mitochondrial enzymes are
  particularly vulnerable to attacks by peroxynitrite, leading to reduced ATP formation
  and induction of mitochondrial permeability transition by opening of the permeability
  transition pore (PTP), which dissipates the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ).
  These events result in cessation of electron transport and ATP formation, mitochondrial
  swelling and permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, allowing the
  efflux of several pro-apoptotic molecules, including cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing
  factor (AIF). In turn, cytochrome c and AIF activate a series of downstream effectors,
  which mediate caspase dependent and independent apoptotic death pathways. In addition
  to its damaging effects on mitochondria, peroxynitrite, in concert with other oxidants,
  causes oxidative injury to DNA, resulting in DNA strand breakage which in turn activate
  the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1). Activated PARP-1 consumes
  NAD+ to build-up poly(ADP-ribose) polymers (PAR) which are then metabolized by the
  activity of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). Peroxynitrite, at least in part
  via overactivated PARP-1, may also facilitate the expression of a variety of inflammatory
  genes leading to increased inflammation and associated tissue injury. (Reprinted
