caption: 'Schematic representation of the possible activation mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome.
  The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a two‐step process involving priming
  and activation. NLRP3 must be primed before activation. Activation of the NLRP3
  inflammasome primarily occurs through three mechanisms: classical activation, nonclassical
  activation, and alternative activation. In the priming phase, deleterious stimuli
  activate PRRs, such as TLRs, TNFR and IL‐1R, which subsequently triggers NF‐κB signalling,
  leading to the transcriptional upregulation and increased expression of NLRP3, pro‐caspase‐1,
  pro‐IL‐1β, and pro‐IL‐18. The classical activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome involves
  PAMPs, such as toxins and viral RNA, as well as DAMPs, including extracellular ATP,
  and various particles and crystals. This activation process involves several signalling
  events, including K+ efflux, Ca2+ influx, Cl− efflux, lysosomal disruption, production
  of mtROS, and release of oxidised mtDNA. The nonclassical activation pathway involves
  phagocytosed bacteria releasing LPS into the cytoplasm, which activates human Caspase‐4/5
  or mouse Caspase‐11. Caspase‐11 then cleaves GSDMD, inducing pyroptosis and indirectly
  activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. This, in turn, leads to the activation of Caspase‐1
  and the release of IL‐1β and IL‐18. The alternative activation pathway is induced
  by TLR4 receptor activation, such as LPS. This pathway activates the TLR4‐TRIF‐RIPK1‐FADD‐Caspase‐8
  signalling cascade, which subsequently leads to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
