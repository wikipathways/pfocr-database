caption: ROS regulate the transcription of genes involved in autophagy. ROS trigger
  various transcription factors, including HIF-1, Nrf2, p53, and FOXO3, to modulate
  gene transcription. These factors translocate to the nucleus and interact with different
  signaling pathways, including autophagy-related pathways such as the AMPK and mTORC1
  signaling pathways. Autophagy-related proteins such as Beclin1, LC3, ATG proteins,
  and BNIP3 are regulated through these pathways in response to oxidative stress,
  which might regulate the selective autophagic degradation of peroxisomes, known
  as pexophagy
