caption: Schematic showing observed protein level alterations in VSCC proteome in
  the context of HPV infection. The viral proteins E5, E6, and E7 (not detected on
  protein level in the study), responsible for many of the oncogenic features of the
  human papilloma virus (HPV), are indicated in yellow. By inactivation and degradation
  of pRb and p53, E6, and E7 cause proliferation and apoptosis inhibition. Inhibition
  of pRb releases the transcription factor E2F, a key regulator of cell cycle genes,
  which is also under the influence of PA2G4 (ErbB3-binding protein Ebp1) as indicated
  in the figure. We observed reduced levels of the p53-regulated protein 14–3-3, an
  inhibitor of cell cycle progression (), among the majority of the HPV+ tumors in
  our study. Without investigating the connection to HPV, elevated cytoplasmic levels
  of 14–3-3-z have been linked to advanced disease in VSCC by immunohistochemistry
  analysis (). Further, the relative protein levels of two endosomal proteins, Bap31
  and Rab11, were decreased in HPV infected tumors. Viral protein E5 is proposed to
  reduce MHC I levels via Bap31 interaction (, ), and decreased levels of Rab11 in
  cytomegalovirus infected cells has been linked to decreased levels of MHC 1 and
  impaired degradation of EGFR (). The immune response is further suppressed by the
  down-regulation of STAT1 and downstream proteins. We also inserted the IHC validated
  proteins LGMN and PSMA5 in the figure, although there is no known link to HPV infection.
  Protein levels up-regulated relative to the sample mean are indicated with red bars;
  green bars indicate down-regulation. The figure was created using IPA and based
  on a figure by Moody ().
