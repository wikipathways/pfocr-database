caption: (A) IPP and DMAPP are first formed from the mevalonate pathway. IPP and DMAPP
  are the substrates for isoprenyl disphosphate synthases (GPPS, FPPS, and GGPPS).
  IDSs produce isoprenyl diphosphates of varying lengths, depending on the number
  of IPP units added. Isoprenyl diphosphates (GPP, FPP, and GGPP) are themselves the
  substrates used by TPSs to make terpenes of various sizes. For example, monoterpene
  synthases produce monoterpenes, such as ocimene, from GPP. For illustration, (E,E)-α-farnesene
  is used as a representative sesquiterpene, and phytol as a diterpene. (B) Proposed
  biosynthetic pathway in H. melpomene. Reciprocal best BLAST hits are highlighted
  in bold. IDSs are in red and their products, isoprenyl diphosphates, in blue. BLAST,
