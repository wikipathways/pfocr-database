caption: multiple neuropeptides and receptors regulate the activity of neurons in
  feeding circuits. Activation of the NPY/AgRP neuron (pink) or POMC neuron (blue)
  leads to the release of a number of neuropeptides. NPY functions as an agonist of
  Y1-Y5 receptors (). ProSAAS-derived b-LEN is an agonist of GPR171 () and PEN is
  an agonist of GPR83 (). AgRP is an antagonist/inverse agonist of MC4R signaling
  through G proteins but is an agonist at MC4R receptors through the ERK1/2 pathway
  (). POMC-derived αMSH is an agonist of MC4R, as well as other melanocortin receptors
  (). Another POMC-derived peptide, β-endorphin 1-31 (β-End) is an agonist at mu opioid
  receptors (MOR) and also delta opioid receptors. β-endorphin peptides can be N-terminally
  acetylated, which eliminates their ability to bind to opioid receptors (). CART
  is thought to mediate its effects through interaction with a G protein-coupled receptor,
  but the receptor has not been identified (; ; ; ). Other peptides derived from proNPY,
  AgRP, proSAAS, POMC, and CART (or additional precursors) can potentially activate
  a distinct set of receptors indicated here by ‘?’. In this schematic, peptides derived
  from the same neuropeptide precursor are shown to be released from the same nerve
  terminal although this may not always be the case; recently it was reported that
  αMSH and β-End are differentially expressed and released (), and N-terminally-derived
  proSAAS peptides (i.e. SAAS) are sorted into distinct vesicles from PEN and b-LEN
  (). In this diagram, multiple receptors are shown on the same post-synaptic cell,
  with activation of the various receptors leading to activation/inhibition of the
  various signaling cascades resulting in cross-talk among the second messenger systems
  in the postsynaptic neuron (green). In feeding circuits, specific neurons are likely
  to express only a subset of the indicated receptors, as well as receptors for classical
  neurotransmitters like GABA (not shown).
