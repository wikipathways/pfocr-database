caption: The graphic illustration of the mechanism of SHP2-mediated tumor immunosuppression
  in colon cancer defined by single-cell RNA sequencing. All cell types of tumor microenvironment
  (TME) from murine MC38 xenograft tumors upon SHP099 treatment were investigated
  by single-cell transcriptomics. SHP2 negatively regulates type I interferon signaling
  by preventing STING–TBK1–IRF3 signaling pathway in tumor-associated macrophages.
  SHP2 allosteric inhibition remolds the anti-tumor TME, indicating that SHP2 is a
  promising target for colon cancer immunotherapy.
