caption: 'Testosterone signaling pathways in Sertoli cells. Left (Pathway 1): The
  classical testosterone signaling pathway: Testosterone diffuses through the plasma
  membrane and binds with the AR that then undergoes an alteration in conformation
  allowing it to be released from heat shock proteins (HSP70, HSP90) in the cytoplasm.
  AR then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sequences called
  androgen response elements (AREs). AR binding to an ARE allows the recruitment of
  co-regulators (co-activator or co-repressor proteins) that alter the expression
  of genes and eventually cellular function. Middle (Pathway 2): The non-classical
  kinase activation pathway: Testosterone interacts with AR that is then able to bind
  with and activate Src, which is required for sperm release and germ cell attachment.
  Src also causes the activation of the EGF receptor that then activates the MAP kinase
  cascade most likely through Ras resulting in the sequential phosphorylation and
  activation of RAF and MEK and then ERK, which regulates BTB integrity and germ cell
  attachment. ERK may also regulate classical pathway-mediated gene expression through
  pathways that are not yet known for Sertoli cells. ERK also can facilitate non-classical
  pathway mediated gene expression. For example, ERK activates p90RSK kinase, which
  is known to phosphorylate CREB on serine 133. As a result, CREB-regulated genes
  can be induced by testosterone. Right (Pathway 3): The non-classical Ca2+ influx
  pathway: Testosterone interacts with a receptor in the plasma membrane that has
  characteristics of a Gq coupled G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Phospholipase
  C (PLC) is activated to cleave PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. Decreased PIP2 concentrations
  inhibit K+ATP channels causing membrane depolarization and Ca2+ entry via L-type
  Ca2+ channels.'
