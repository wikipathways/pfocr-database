caption: Model of TssS-induced suppression of STING-mediated innate immunity. Yptb
  infection induces Mn2+ release from membrane-enclosed organelles into the cytosol
  of host cells, boosting activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. In host cells infected
  with Yptb WT (Left), the Mn2+-chelating micropeptide TssS was translocated into
  the cytosol via its T6SS. TssS suppresses the Mn2+-enhanced STING-mediated innate
  immune response by chelating Mn2+, thus reducing bacterial clearance. When host
  cells were infected with the ΔtssS mutant (Right), no Mn2+-chelating TssS was translocated,
  and the bioavailability of Mn2+ was higher. Consequently, STING and its downstream
  pathways were activated to a greater extent, restricting infection by the ΔtssS
  mutant.
