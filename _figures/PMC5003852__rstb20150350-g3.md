caption: Main mediators of NVC responses to distinct cortical afferent pathways. Various
  cell types contribute to the changes in diameter of the cortical microvessels that
  lead to the haemodynamic response. Depending on the subcortical pathway, pyramidal
  cells act directly through COX-2 derived PGE2 or indirectly by releasing glutamate
  (Glu) that then acts on perivascular astrocytes and GABA interneurons. GABA released
  from different subtypes of interneurons, depending on the afferent input, modulates
  pyramidal cell activity through GABA-A receptor activation. Astrocytes can dilate
  microvessels by releasing EETs and activation of BK channels, with subsequent activation
  of Kir channels in smooth muscle cells. The black line shows the known contribution
  of mediators, the dotted line indicates that these mediators have not been fully
  characterized (BF) or that their role remains ambiguous (LC), and the interrupted
  line indicated no involvement in the NVC response (BF). Other mediators or modulators
  have been identified depending on the pathway, and involvement of endothelial pathways
  is not illustrated.

  description: Main mediators of NVC responses to distinct cortical afferent pathways.
    Various cell types contribute to the changes in diameter of the cortical microvessels
    that lead to the haemodynamic response. Depending on the subcortical pathway,
    pyramidal cells act directly through COX-2 derived PGE2 or indirectly by releasing
    glutamate (Glu) that then acts on perivascular astrocytes and GABA interneurons.
    GABA released from different subtypes of interneurons, depending on the afferent
    input, modulates pyramidal cell activity through GABA-A receptor activation. Astrocytes
    can dilate microvessels by releasing EETs and activation of BK channels, with
    subsequent activation of Kir channels in smooth muscle cells. The black line shows
    the known contribution of mediators, the dotted line indicates that these mediators
    have not been fully characterized (BF) or that their role remains ambiguous (LC),
    and the interrupted line indicated no involvement in the NVC response (BF). Other
    mediators or modulators have been identified depending on the pathway, and involvement
    of endothelial pathways is not illustrated.
