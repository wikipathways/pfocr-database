caption: 'When the cytokine interleukin 4 (IL-4) stimulates its receptor (labeled
  IL-4R), it leads to the induction of at least two signaling pathways, including
  one involving Akt and mTORC1. Covarrubias et al. found that this pathway promotes
  the activation of an enzyme called Acly that converts citrate in the cytoplasm (shaded
  orange) into acetyl-CoA, which supplies the acetyl groups that are involved (via
  the modification of histones) in the expression of the genes that regulate the activation
  of M2 macrophages. These genes are involved in cell proliferation and chemokine
  production. The same pathway also promotes glucose uptake, glycolysis, and the production
  of acetyl-CoA. The increased levels of fatty acid oxidation in M2 macrophages also
  lead to more acetyl-CoA in mitochondria (shaded blue). It is possible that this
  acetyl-CoA is then converted to citrate via the TCA cycle and exported to the cytoplasm.
  Acly: ATP-citrate lyase;TCA cycle: tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
