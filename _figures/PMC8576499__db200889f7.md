caption: Schematic of proposed signaling pathway for constriction of retinal venules
  to ET-1 under normal conditions and in early type 1 diabetes. ET-1 activates venular
  smooth muscle ETARs and increases Ca2+ influx. The Ca2+-dependent activation of
  ROCK causes JNK activation, leading to vasoconstriction. In early diabetes, the
  elevated ET-1 promotes retinal venular constriction. Moreover, the cellular Ca2+
  in the diabetic venule is further elevated by activating the p38 kinase-dependent
  NHE1/NCX/Ca2+pathway (red rectangular box), causing heightened ROCK and JNK activations
  and, consequently, enhanced vasoconstriction. Created with BioRender (BioRender.com).
