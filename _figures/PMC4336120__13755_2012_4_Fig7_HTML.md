caption: Neighborhood of a tapped node is highlighted. Once a node (reaction or molecule)
  is tapped in the visualization, all nodes within 1-hop distance are shown as is
  and the rest of the pathway is greyed out. This figure also illustrates the ENZYME
  database information related to the catalyzing enzyme of the tapped reaction. Here,
  ENZYME database information for 2-oxoglutarate.ferredoxin oxidoreductase is displayed
  in the sidebar.
