caption: Schematic of Wnt/PCP signaling and its effects on organogenesis. Diagramed
  are the genetic and physical interactions of the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway components
  discussed in this review and shown to be essential for organ formation and proper
  function of the primary cilia. Based on the role of Wnt/PCP signaling in zebrafish
  and other animal models, we surmise that the actin cytoskeleton may be a main target
  of this pathway during organogenesis. Hair cell polarity within the lateral line
  neuromasts is dependent on the vangl2. However, loss of glypican 4, wnt5b, or wnt11
  does not perturb neuromast organization. In contrast, while glypican 4 and wnt5b
  mutant embryos exhibit irregular chondrocyte stacking, the organization of vangl2
  mutant cartilages appears to be normal. Recently, Wnt/PCP signaling has been shown
  to interact with the components of the primary cilia. Proteins involved in the Wnt/PCP
  pathway, such as Dishevelled and Vangl2, can co-localize with the cilia and may
  regulate its localization and function. Primary cilia may be also involved with
  the down regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, similar to Wnt/PCP. Overexpression
  of the Wnt/PCP pathway ligands appears to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling in fin
  regeneration, but the precise mechanisms of this interaction were not explored.
  The neuromast hair cell schematic was adapted from Lopez-Schier et al.,, and the
  chondrocyte stacking schematic was adapted from Topczewski et al. Dub, Duboraya;
  Sea, Seahorse; Pk, Prickle; Vangl2, Van Gogh–like 2; Bbs4, Bardet–Biedl syndrome
  4; Ofd1, oral-facial-digital syndrome 1.
