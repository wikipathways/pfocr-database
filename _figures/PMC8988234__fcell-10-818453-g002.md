caption: The overview of ferroptosis. This figure shows five systems regulating ferroptosis.
  The first one is the anti-oxidative GSH-GPX4 pathway, in which system xc−, transsulfuration
  way, GSH and GPX4 involve. The second one is the mevalonate pathway, where CoQ10
  is produced. The third one is iron metabolism, where the Fenton reaction happens
  and the starter of lipid peroxidation, OH., is produced. The fourth one is mitochondria,
  on whose membrane oxidative CoQ10 is catalyzed into reductive CoQ10 (CoQ10H2) and
  DHODH could inhibit this process. Meanwhile, the increased ROS along with the increased
  TCA cycle may help ferroptosis. The fifth one is lipid metabolism, in which PUFA
  is catalyzed into peroxidative lipid finally. GSH, glutathione; GSSG, glutathione
  disulfide; GSR, glutathione-disulfide reductase; FSP1, ferroptosis suppressor protein-1;
  GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A;
  IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate; FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; TF, transferrin; TFRC,
  transferrin receptor; STEAP3, six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3;
  DMT1, divalent metal transporter 1; LIP, labile iron pool; TCA cycle, Tricarboxylic
  Acid cycle; DHODH, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PUFA,
  polyunsaturated fatty acids; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; ACSL4, acyl-CoA synthetase
  long-chain family member 4; LPCAT3, lysophospholipid acyltransferase 3; LOX, lipoxygenase.
