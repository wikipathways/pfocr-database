caption: A Model for the Integration of PDF in the Molecular ClockworkCLK transcriptional
  activity and neuronal activity indirectly regulates pdf levels (red inhibitory arrow)
  likely through a common pathway involving hr38 and sr (green arrow). PDF feedbacks
  into the s-LNvs to resist its own inhibition by suppressing CLK activity (red inhibitory
  arrow) and inducing its own transcription (dotted green arrow). The model predicts
  that post-translational control over PDF expression/processing/secretion regulates
  pdf transcription.
