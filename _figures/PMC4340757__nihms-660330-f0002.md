caption: '/B> Differences between quiescent and proliferative metabolism. In quiescent
  metabolism (left), cells balance catabolic and anabolic process such as lipogenesis
  and β-oxidation, or protein synthesis and degradation. In proliferative metabolism
  (right), anabolic processes are favored to allow the net production of biomass.
  Red labels indicate metabolic pathways not shown in detail. Green labels indicate
  macromolecules (or protein modifications such as glycosylation) that represent the
  starting points of catabolic pathways and/or the end points of anabolic pathways.
  Broken arrows represent potential fates of the identified nutrients that have not
  been extensively investigated. The mitochondrion is represented in purple to illustrate
  compartmentalized reactions. Abbreviations: AA = amino acids, Asn = Asparagine,
  αKG = α-ketoglutarate, BCAAs = branched chain amino acids, CSA = cysteine sulfinic
  acid, Cys = cysteine, F6P = fructose-6-phosphate, Gln = glutamine, Glu = glutamate,
  Gly = glycine, GSH = reduced glutathione, GSSG = oxidized glutathione, G3P = glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate,
  G6P = glucose-6-phosphate, HBP = hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, NADPH = reduced
  nicotinaminde adenine dinucleotide phosphate, OAA = oxaloacetate, ox = oxidative,
  PPP = pentose phosphate pathway, Pyr = pyruvate, Ser = serine, 3PG = 3-phosphoglycerate.'
