caption: Proposed models of subcellular routes for crocin compartmentation in stigmas
  of C. sativus. (a) Crocins are synthesized in the plastid, and then accumulated
  in plastid-localized small vesicle-like structures, which gradually fuse together
  to form crocinoplasts that could be directly transferred from the polarized end
  of the plastid to the vacuole. This is modified from Gomez-Gomez et al. 2017 . (b)
  CsCCD2 cleaves zeaxanthin in the plastid to produce crocetin dialdehyde, which is
  further converted to crocetin by CsALDH3I1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). CsUGT74AD1
  catalyzes the formation of crocins in the cytoplasm, and then crocins are transported
  into the vacuole through CsABCC4a. This is modified from Demurtas et al. 2018 .
