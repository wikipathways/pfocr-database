caption: Transcription by POLRMT of polycistronic transcripts is initiated from two
  promoters on either strand of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). Processing into
  individual, immature transcripts is performed by the RNase P and RNase Z complexes
  (not indicated), before MTPAP adds short poly(A) extensions to the 3′ ends of both
  sense and antisense RNAs and potentially also to selected tRNAs. Coding RNAs are
  stabilised by the LRPPRC/SLIRP complex, matured and fully polyadenylated in an MTPAP/LRPPRC/SUV3-dependent
  manner. An unknown mechanism targets antisense RNAs directly for degradation by
  the PNPase/SUV3 complex. In the absence of degradation, or polyadenylation, antisense
  RNAs are stabilised allowing for the formation of dsRNAs, which are expelled from
  the mitochondrial matrix by an unknown mechanism. The accumulation of mitochondrial-derived
  nucleic acids and/or an OXPHOS dysfunction triggers an antiviral immune response.
