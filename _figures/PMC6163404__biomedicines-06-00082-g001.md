caption: 'A brief overview of canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation pathways. Canonical signaling pathway: Upon
  receptor engagement, IκB kinase 1 [KK1] (α) and IκB kinase 1 and IκB kinase 2 [IKK2]
  (β) are activated through phosphorylation before proceeding to phosphorylate nuclear
  factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IκB)
  members. Phosphorylation of these residues leads to Skp, Cullin, F-box β-transducin
  repeat-containing protein SCF-β-TrCP complex-mediated rapid polyubiquitination and
  subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. Non-canonical signaling pathway: upon
  receptor engagement, NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) is activated and directly phosphorylates
  and activates the IKK1 homodimer, which goes on to phosphorylate p100, leading to
  the partial SCF-β-TrCP-mediated degradation of p100 to generate the p52-RelB complex.'
