caption: The proposed self-perpetuating cycle links amyloid pathology, inflammation,
  NGF dysregulation, and basal forebrain cholinergic atrophy. The accumulation of
  toxic Aβ peptides oligomers produced from the amyloidogenic processing of APP induces
  an early neuroinflammatory process as well as early NGF dysmetabolism. The latter
  results in an excess of proNGF and depletion of mNGF and a coincident regulation
  of their specific receptors. Aβ-driven overproduction of proinflammatory mediators
  can also itself lead to a dysregulation of the NGF pathway. The reduced bioavailability
  of mNGF then leads to diminished cholinergic trophic support resulting in BFCNs’
  atrophy and loss of function. In turn, the reduced cholinergic tone further promotes
  amyloidogenic processing of APP, as well as neuroinflammation, given the suggested
  inflammatory suppressive effects of acetylcholine. Together, this leads to a self-perpetuating
  cycle promoting further dysfunction of the cholinergic system.
