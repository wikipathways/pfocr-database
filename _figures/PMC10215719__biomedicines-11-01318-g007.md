caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of the effect of Ptn overexpression (A) and the pharmacological
  inhibition of RPTPβ/ζ with MY10 (B) on some of the principal signaling pathways
  implicated in ethanol and/or LPS acute response in adolescent mice. The different
  significant effects found are discernible by color; red: Ptn overexpression effects
  (Ptn+/+ Veh+Sal vs. Ptn-Tg Veh+Sal); light green: Ptn overexpression on LPS actions
  (Ptn-Tg Veh+Sal vs. Ptn-Tg Veh+LPS); blue: Ptn overexpression on EtOH actions (Ptn-Tg
  Veh+Sal vs. Ptn-Tg Veh+EtOH); yellow: RPTPβ/ζ inhibition effects (Ptn+/+ MY10+Sal
  vs. Ptn+/+ Veh+Sal), dark green: RPTPβ/ζ inhibition effects on LPS actions (Ptn+/+
  MY10+Sal vs. Ptn+/+ MY10+LPS). Symbols are combined with the colors. ↑↓ for significant
  effect found in both sexes; ▲▼ for effect found only in one sex;  for expected downregulation
  and  for expected upregulation.'
