caption: Putative mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of TGF‐β1 against
  Aβ‐induced neurodegeneration. Aβ induces neuronal death via an early activation
  of cell cycle, and a late induction of DKK1 leading to an inhibition of the canonical
  Wnt pathway with ensuing activation of GSK‐3β. TGF‐β1 inhibits cell cycle activation
  and rescues the Wnt pathway via a direct activation of the PI3K pathway. Activation
  of the classical Smad‐dependent pathway leading to an enhanced expression of cyclin‐dependent
  kinase inhibitors (p21, p27) and cell cycle arrest is also shown (dotted). Whether
  this pathway may also contribute to the protective effect of TGF‐β1 against Aβ‐induced
  neurodegeneration is unknown.
