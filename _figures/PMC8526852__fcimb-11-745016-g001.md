caption: Adjuvant candidates and their respective receptors. TLR4 and TLR5 are expressed
  on the cell surface, while TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are expressed in endosomes.
  TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 initiate signaling through the MyD88 pathway to
  activate NF-κB, which induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Activated
  Syk elicits the production of proinflammatory cytokines through the NF-κB signaling
  pathway. RIG-1 and MDA-5 are intracellular nucleic acid sensors that induce both
  proinflammatory cytokines and type-1 interferons via MyD88 and IRF signaling pathways.
  cGAS produces cGAMP that activates the cGAS-stimulator STING located on the ER to
  induce production of proinflammatory cytokines through the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  Inflammasomes (AIM2, NLRP1, NLRP3, and NLRC4) cleave pro-caspase 1 into caspase
  1 that subsequently cleaves pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and Gasdermin D into their mature
  forms, respectively. N-terminal Gasdermin D oligomerizes to form pores, inducing
  pyroptosis. Blue text represents adjuvant candidates discussed in this review.
