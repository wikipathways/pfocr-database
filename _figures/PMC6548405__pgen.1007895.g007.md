caption: At the bipotential stage (E10.5), testis- (eg. Sox9) and ovary-determining
  (eg. Lef1) genes are bivalent, marked by both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. Bivalent SD
  genes are co-expressed at low levels, poised for expression of Sry and commitment
  to the testis fate (XY, blue) or in absence of Sry, commitment of the ovary fate
  through the Wnt signaling pathway (XX, pink). Upregulation of SD genes is accompanied
  by loss of H3K27me3. Genes that promote the alternate fate and are repressed after
  sex determination (E13.5) remain bivalent. CBX2 binds to Wnt’s downstream target
  Lef1 in XY gonads, inhibiting its upregulation and stabilizing the testis fate.
  In XX E13.5 gonads, or in XY gonads that lack Cbx2, Lef1 promotes pregranulosa development
  which blocks upregulation of the testis fate (right, pink). It remains unclear whether
  CBX2 maintains H3K27me3 from the progenitor state in XY cells and is removed from
  specific targets in XX cells, or whether it is targeted specifically to ovary genes
  during Sertoli cell development.
