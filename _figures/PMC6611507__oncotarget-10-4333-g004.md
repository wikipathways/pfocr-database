caption: Cancer predisposing risk factors are known to cause cellular injury, which
  in turn activates normal inflammatory response. HCMV can be reactivated as the latently
  infected monocytes differentiate into macrophages during migration as a part of
  this inflammatory response. The classically activated macrophages (M1) carrying
  a re-activated virus infection, can then infect other cell types, such as fibroblasts,
  endothelial and epithelial cells, which are more permissive to lytic HCMV infections.
  HCMV infected cells promote inflammatory and angiogenic secretome, that paracrinally,
  by intercellular signaling through secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, TGFβ, GM-CSF
  and cmvIL-10, induce haemangiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, cell proliferation as
  well as immune evasion/immunosupression. HCMV infection in the epithelial cells
  is evidenced to cause transformation to tumor cells []. The presence of HCMV infection
  in the tissue macrophages (M1) or secretion of GM-CSF by the tumor cells can result
  in activation of M2 macrophage differentiation pathway. Presence of M2 macrophages
  favor a pro-tumoral microenvironment due to their matrix-remodeling and anti-inflammatory
  properties [, ]. These immunosuppressive M2 macrophages display a phenotype that
  is closely related to tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), of which presence in
  the tumors is known to play an important prognostic value. In addition, tumors contain
  a subpopulation of cancer cells, called cancer stem cells or tumor initiating cells
  (TICs), that have undergone an epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). The
  close vicinity of TAMs and cancer cells undergoing EMT at the invasive front of
  tumors, suggests that these cell types might interact mutually [, ]. The TAM-like
  macrophage phenotype secretes CCL5 stimulating EMT and migration of the cancer cells,
  and thereby increases the invasiveness and metastasis of the tumor []. Despite the
  transformation and tumor forming process involving epithelial cells, TAMs, TICs,
  endothelial cells and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the HCMV infection contributes
  to disarm the NK cells and adaptive immune responses (see ). NK cells activation
  of the cytotoxic T-cell responses displays a crucial function in the cell-mediated
  first-line host responses against viral infections and cancer initiation [–]. NK
  cells are also involved in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by B cell activation
  through CD4+ T cells [].
