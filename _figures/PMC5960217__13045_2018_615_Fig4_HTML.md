caption: The Wnt signaling pathway is a central player in MM. MM cells have an active
  intrinsic Wnt pathway. This can be stimulated by Wnt ligands produced by BM cells
  including MSC, or in an autocrine fashion via at least Wnt5a and Wnt11. Canonical
  Wnt pathway activation via Fzd1, Fzd6, or Fzd7 leads to active LEF/TCF mediated
  transcription of Wnt target genes that promote tumor growth. The transcribed Wnt
  antagonist Dkk1 is secreted into the BM microenvironment and inhibits osteoblast
  proliferation, differentiation and survival. Combined with stimulation of osteoclast
  activity, this results in disruption of bone homeostasis and increased osteolytic
  bone resorption. The growth factors IGF-1 and TGF-β that are released from the bone
  matrix, together with osteoclast-secreted factors IL-6 and Annexin II, further stimulate
  MM cells. Expression of the Wnt target gene CD44, together with stimulation of the
  non-canonical Wnt pathways, stimulate adhesive properties of MM cells to BM stromal
  cells. This induces cell adhesion-mediated resistance of MM cells to conventional
  drug therapies
