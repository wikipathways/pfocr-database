caption: 'NAD+ and NMN biosynthesis in yeast cells. NAD+ can be synthesized by three
  pathways: NA/NAM salvage pathways, tryptophan de novo synthesis, and NR-mediated
  synthesis. Nicotinic acid biosynthesis proteins (Bna 2, 7, 4, 5, 1) are involved
  in the spontaneous cyclization that leads to the formation of quinolinic acid and
  NaMN in the tryptophan de novo synthesis pathway. However, this pathway is likely
  inactive when NAD+ levels are sufficient. In the NA/NAM salvage pathway, NaMN is
  produced from NA, which ultimately results in the formation of NaAD. The conversion
  of NaAD to NAD+ is facilitated by Nma1, Nma2, and Qns1. In the NR-mediated NAD+
  biosynthesis pathway, NR is first transformed into NMN by the enzyme Nrk1. NMN is
  then used by the enzymes Nma1, Nma2, and Pof1 to synthesize NAD+. Generally, the
  Nrk1-dependent and Urh1/Pnp1-mediated routes assimilate NR and utilize exogenous
  NR made from NMN by the nucleotidase actions of Sdt1and Isn1 in the cytosol. For
  NMN, rate-limiting enzyme, nicotinamide phosphoribo-syltransferase, converts nicotinamide
  into NMN. NR kinase (NRK)-mediated phosphorylation is also used to synthesize NMN
