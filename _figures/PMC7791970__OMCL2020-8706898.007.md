caption: Schema of the signaling pathway involved in HSP60-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation and subsequent IL-1β production. After MSU crystal stimulation, the secretion
  of HSP60 to the extracellular level is greatly increased, which activates the signaling
  pathway and promotes the transcription of IL-1β and NLRP3. MSU crystal treatment
  also leads to a large amount of HSP60 aggregation in mitochondria, causing mitochondrial
  dysfunction, thereby activating NLRP3 inflammasome and promoting IL-1β precursor
  processing and ultimately leading to IL-1β release and inflammatory response.
