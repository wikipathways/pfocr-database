caption: Proposed model of dopamine dysregulation in the nigrostriatal pathway in
  schizophrenia. Gene expression of multiple DA-regulating molecules (red box) involved
  in autoreception (DRD2), transport (DAT and VMAT) and catabolism (MAO) are changed
  in the substantia nigra in schizophrenia, and together may contribute to DA dysregulation
  at the level of the DA cell bodies and/or at the DA terminals in the striatum. DA
  is synthesised from tyrosine (tyr) by TH and AADC, but these do not appear to be
  changed in level. MAO and COMT breakdown DA to metabolites, DOPAC and HVA and MAO
  mRNA is increased. DAT removes DA from the synaptic cleft and is reduced at the
  mRNA level but not at the protein level in the midbrain. VMAT packages DA into vesicles
  and is reduced at the mRNA level. DRD2 (blue triangle) autoreception inhibits DA
  firing, DA synthesis and DA release, and we found a significant decrease in DRD2S
  mRNA. DRD3 mRNA was unchanged. DA activation of DRD2 (blue triangle) on the postsynaptic
  neuron inhibits AC leading to disinhibition of the inhibitory medium spiny neurons.
  Increased DRD2 expression in the striatum in schizophrenia would further contribute
  to DA dysregulation. AADC, aromatic acid decarboxylase; AC, adenylate cyclase; COMT,
  catechol-O-methyl transferase; DA, dopamine; DRD, dopamine receptor D; MAO, monoamine
  oxidase; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; VMAT2, vesicular monoamine transporter 2.
papertitle: Putative presynaptic dopamine dysregulation in schizophrenia is supported
  by molecular evidence from post-mortem human midbrain.
