caption: The TLR2 signal pathway involved in oxidative stress [,]. The TLR2 signaling
  pathway activates the MYD88 pathway to activate the NF-κB and MAPK pathways under
  the action of the ligand Pam3CSK4. Phosphorylation of MAPK then activates transcription
  factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) and PI3K/protein kinase signaling pathways to
  induce an immune response. AP-1 is a transcription factor that mediates pro-inflammatory
  factors, and NO● levels are regulated by iNOS. Nrf2 can induce the expression of
  pro-inflammatory factors by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory NF-κB,
  which is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the anti-inflammatory reaction and can
  induce oxidative stress. GSH, SOD, and CAT are all in a key antioxidant in the host
  organism. Activated NF-κB reduces cellular SOD activity.
