caption: 'Metabolic pathway of homoarginine (hArg) synthesis and associated substrates.
  Nitric oxide enters cells by diffusion where its products interact with multiple
  enzymes (CPS1, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1; ASS1, argininosuccinate synthase;
  ASL, argininosuccinate lyase) in a homologue urea cycle including ornithine transcarbamoylase
  (OTC) to create hArg. Arginase (ARG1) can then breakdown hArg into lysine. HArg
  is also synthesized from lysine and Arg by the arginine: glycine amidinotransferase
  (AGAT) enzyme. Figure created on PathBank 2.0.23'
