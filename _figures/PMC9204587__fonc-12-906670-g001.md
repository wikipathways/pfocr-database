caption: Cholesterol homeostasis main processes. (1) SREBP processing at the ER membrane
  and Golgi apparatus; in high cholesterol condition, SREBP is retained at the ER
  membrane by INSIG and SCAP, which sense oxysterols and sterols, respectively. At
  low cholesterol condition, SREBP can be transported to the Golgi apparatus and cleaved
  by S1P and S2P proteases. Cleaved SREBP can enter the nucleus and trigger the transcription
  of crucial MVA pathway genes. (2) Main steps of cholesterol synthesis through the
  MVA pathway, of which HMGCR represents the rate-limiting enzyme. (3) LDL-cholesterol
  intake via LDL-receptor mediated endocytosis. (4) Cholesterol efflux by ABCA1 transporter,
  which employs ATP molecules to deliver cholesterol and lipids on apoA-I, triggering
  the assembly of nascent HDL. (5) ACAT enzyme mediated cholesterol esterification
  to fatty acids tightly packaged and stored in the core of intracellular lipid droplets,
  which represent a ready storage of lipids that can be used without investing energy
  in biosynthesis. (6) Cholesterol conversion in its main derivatives, some of which
  may play a role in BC pathology and progression. The main cholesterol homeostasis
  inhibitors and their targets are underlined in blue, while drugs and substances
  used in clinical trials (see ) are shown in green. Created with BioRender.com.
