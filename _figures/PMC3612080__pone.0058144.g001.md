caption: '(A) The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in plants. Enzymatic conversions
  are shown by arrows with the enzymes involved in each reaction. GGPPS: Geranyl-Geranyl
  Pyrophosphate Synthase; PSY: Phytoene Synthase; PDS: Phytoene Desaturase; ζ-ISO:
  ζ-carotene Isomerase; ZDS: ζ-carotene Desaturase; CRTISO: Carotenoid Isomerase;
  Z-ISO: ζ-carotene isomerase, LCYB: Lycopene β-cyclase; LCYE: Lycopene ε-cyclase;
  B-CHX: β-carotene Hydroxylases; E-CHX: ε-carotene Hydroxylases; ZEP: ZeaxanthinEpoxidase;
  VDE: Violaxanthin de-epoxidase; NSY: Neoxanthin synthase, CCD: Carotenoid cleavage
  dioxygenase; NCED: 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase. (B) Lycopene β-cyclase Reaction.
  The LCYB enzyme transforms one molecule of lycopene into one molecule of β-carotene
  or α-carotene (together with LCYE) using NADPH as cofactor.'
