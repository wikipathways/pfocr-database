caption: Mechanisms leading to neuronal degeneration in hyperglycemia involve reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) formation. The diabetic state produces impaired neurotropism,
  axonal transport and gene expression through at least four major pathways. 1) Excess
  glucose is diverted away from glycolysis by the polyol pathway that depletes NADPH
  and cellular antioxidant capacity. 2) Glucose also may become oxidized and form
  AGEs that alter extracellular matrix, activate receptors that produce ROS intermediates,
  and alter intracellular protein function. 3) PKC becomes activated either directly
  by glycolytic intermediates or indirectly as shown as a second messenger for stress
  hormones, leading to increased vascular disease, inflammation, and oxidative stress.
  4) Partial glycolysis causes accumulation of glycolytic intermediates and leads
  to escape of fructose-6-phosphate along the hexosamine pathway that increases vascular
  disease and further ROS generation. These mechanisms are ultimately linked to superoxide
  production through increased glucose respiration that produces superoxide in the
  mitochondria and also activates the superoxide-producing NADH oxidase. GSSG, glutathione
  disulfide; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
