caption: Cell death pathways caused by HU. HU inhibits RNR activity and causes dNTP
  limitation, which in turn results in induction of RNR expression. HU also accelerates
  ROS production via membrane stress response. Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide inactivate
  RNR activity, which also activates pathway II, and the generation of an OH radical
  provokes an SOS response, which induces RNR expression (pathway I). Superoxide generation
  directly from RNR was suggested by analysis of the ΔyfaE mutant (). The indicated
  genes represent mutations that increased HU sensitivity, except for rpsF and rimK,
  which represent mutations that reduced RNR expression. Gene positions represent
  the steps where mutations are supposed to affect the circuits of RNR expression
  from the data, literature, and gene function. Arrows outlined by dotted lines represent
  the pathways suggested in our study but not confirmed.
