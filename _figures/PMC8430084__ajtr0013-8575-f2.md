caption: 'Mechanism of NETs in thrombosis in COVID-19. (1) Increased expression of
  P-selectins and vWF, recruits and adheres to leukocytes (mainly neutrophils) and
  PLTs. Activated platelets interact with neutrophils to promote thrombus formation.
  (2) DNA by contact activation initiates the generation of fibrin (3) Histones mediate
  the mechanism for thrombosis through the upregulation of TF and PS expression. (4)
  Cytokines lead to the release of considerable amounts of MP, released from apoptosis
  of blood cells, promoting thrombus formation by PS exposure. (5) Elevated levels
  of TF expression and PS exposure on ECs after treatment with NETs together enhance
  hypercoagulable state. (6) Hypoxia-induced HIF1α promotes thrombosis by NET generation.
  HIF2α induced by hypoxia mediates the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
  (PAI-1) and microparticles (MP) release. HIF2α also reduces expression of tissue
  factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) on ECs. (7) Exhausted plasmin affects thrombus formation
  by altered fibrinolytic function. (8) Inflammation induced by NETs and the release
  of cytokines results in high levels of FVIII and vWF: Ag and a secondary deficiency
  of ADAMTS13. Defective ADAMTS13 leads to reduced vWF cleavage and enhances platelet-rich
  thrombus. Abbreviations: NETs: Neutrophil Extracellular Traps; COVID19: coronavirus
