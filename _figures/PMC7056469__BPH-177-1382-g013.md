caption: Mechanisms of oxidative stress are targets of antioxidant dietary compounds.
  (a) Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between ROS and antioxidant
  defence mechanisms. ROS target biomolecules such as DNA, proteins and lipids and
  impart oxidative damage which underlies many diseases. (b) Natural antioxidants
  such as vitamin C, vitamin A, EGCG, and genistein can neutralize free radicals by
  donating an electron, thus inhibiting oxidative DNA damage. Lipid soluble antioxidants,
  vitamin E, and curcumin prevent lipid peroxidation by quenching free radicals and
  protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from peroxidation. (c) The interconnection
  of vitamin E, vitamin C, and GSH reductase (GR) is shown, demonstrating the function
  of regeneration of antioxidants when oxidized. Vitamin C regenerates the reduced
  form of vitamin E which utilizes GR to convert GSSG to its reduced form, GSH. EGCG
  promotes cellular redox balance through increasing the activity of GSH. (d) SOD
  catalyses the reduction of superoxide anion (O2•−) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),
  which is subsequently neutralized into water and oxygen by GSH peroxidase (GPx)
  and/or catalase (CAT). Antioxidants including resveratrol (RSV), EGCG, and selenium
  (Se) enhance the activity of specific antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx) to
  contribute to alleviation of oxidative stress. Additionally, genistein scavenges
  H2O2 and free radicals leading to inhibition of H2O2‐induced oxidative damage. (e)
  Three isoforms of NOS, iNOS, eNOS, and nNOS (inducible, endothelial, and neuronal)
  can generate NO. NO can act as a signalling molecule or it can react with superoxide
  anion (O2•−) generating peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−), which is a highly reactive
  nitrogen species. Thus, ONOO− can trigger oxidation of DNA, proteins and lipids.
  Antioxidants such as curcumin and resveratrol promote redox balance by targeting
  NO and ONOO− concentration respectively. (F) Cellular oxidative stress caused by
  generation of ONOO− and O2•− stimulates nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor
  2 (Nrf2) to dissociate from its repressor protein (Keap1) and translocate from cytoplasm
  into the nucleus to bind to antioxidant response elements (AREs) and activate transcription
  of antioxidant‐related genes. Natural antioxidants shown in the grey box have been
  shown to activate Keap1‐Nrf2 pathway. (g) Table of major contributors to oxidative
