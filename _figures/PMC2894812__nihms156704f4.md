caption: The biosynthetic pathway of bacterial murein. The pathway initiates with
  committing steps, generating UDP-acetylmuramic acid (UDP-MurNAc). L-alanine, D-glutamic
  acid, lysine or diaminophenolic acid, and D-alanyl-D-alanine are enzymatically added
  to UDP-MurNAc in a stepwise manner. The formation of UDP-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide
  (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide) occurs in the cytoplasm. Then, the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide
  is transferred to the cytoplasmic membrane where two lipid carriers (Lipid I and
  Lipid II) are involved in the joining of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and UDP-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc) to form a linear murein with protruding short peptide chains. Finally,
  the linear murein chains are cross-linked with each other and to pre-existing murein.
  A few chemical compounds are known to block this pathway. β-lactams are known to
  inhibit the cross-linking, whereas bacitracin inhibits the recycling of undecaprenyl.
  Moenomycin and vancomycin inhibit the function of Lipid II that carries the disaccharide
  peptide monomer units.
