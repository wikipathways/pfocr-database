caption: The scheme illustrates the important role of coordinated handoff of single-stranded
  BER intermediates between pol β and FEN1 in regulating the stability of CAG repeats
  during BER of 8-oxoG in the context of CAG repeats (shown in purple). (Pathway 1)
  The single-stranded repair intermediates are handed off effectively between pol
  β and FEN1. After pol β gap-filling with dGMP insertion and FEN1 removal of the
  sugar phosphate ( ) plus 1 nucleotide, pol β then conducts gap-filling (dCMP insertion)
  and a nicked DNA intermediate is produced. This process occurs without strand slippage
  that could result in hairpin structures. The nicked intermediate is subsequently
  sealed by DNA ligase, and repeat expansion will not occur.(Pathway 2) If pol β and
  FEN1 coordination is disrupted by spontaneous strand slippage, CAG repeat hairpin
  structures will form, the multi-nucleotide gap will be filled by pol β, and pol
  β terminates synthesis at the base of the hairpin. FEN1 flap cleavage activity also
  will be inhibited. Thus, stabile hairpin structures inhibit FEN1 conventional cleavage
  at the 3′-base of the hairpin, as illustrated. Alternatively, FEN1 “alternate cleavage”
  of a short 5′-flap at the base of the hairpin will result in a ligatable nick, ligation
  and repeat expansion.
