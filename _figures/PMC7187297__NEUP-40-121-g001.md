caption: 'Metabolic compartment of glucose between astroglia and neurons in the neurovascular
  unit (NVU). Astroglia are interposed between microvessels and neuronal synapses,
  forming the NVU. Glucose supplied from outside the brain can be transported to and
  utilized by both astroglia and neurons (red lines). Glucose utilization by cultured
  astroglia (2–3 pmol/μg protein: red line) is two times higher than that in cultured
  neurons (1 pmol/μg protein: red broken line), and astroglia produce lactate even
  under normoxic conditions (aerobic glycolysis). Neuronal activation induces glutamate
  release from the pre‐synaptic nerve terminal; the glutamate is then taken up by
  astroglia, and this uptake, in turn, accelerates glucose consumption, leading to
  further lactate release. Lactate, then, serves as an energy substrate for neurons
  (astrocyte‐neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis, ANLSH). The basal pentose‐phosphate
  pathway (PPP) flux measured in cultured astroglia is approximately seven times higher
  than that in cultured neurons. Neuronal activation induces astroglial glycolysis,
  leading to increased flux to the PPP. Increases in NADPH in astroglia serve as a
  redox regulator that maintains the reduced form of glutathione. ① Na+,K+‐ATPase.
