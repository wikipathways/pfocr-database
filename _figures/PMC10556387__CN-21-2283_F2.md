caption: Neuroprotection targeting to signal transduction of apoptosis, necroptosis,
  and autophagy in ischemic stroke. (A) Bcl-2 activators inhibit the intrinsic pathway
  of apoptosis. In multiple forms of cellular stress, proapoptotic BCL-2 family members
  Bax and Bak translocate to the mitochondria, then mediate the release of cytochrome
  c in the cytosol and trigger the apoptosome assembly (Apaf-1 and caspase-9) and
  subsequent activation of caspase-3 and cell death. The extrinsic cell death pathway
  is that death receptors (CD95, TRAIL-R1/2, and TNF-R1) mediate and recruit adapter
  proteins FADD and bind to the death effector domain-containing caspase-8 or -10.
  The activation of caspase-8 mediates cleavage of Bid to tBid or directly activates
  caspase-3, the executioner enzymes of apoptosis. (B) Necroptosis signaling pathway
  in cerebral ischemic stroke. Under conditions of ATP depletion, inhibition of caspase-8
  leads to the formation of a necrosome, including RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, which initiates
  a downstream signal cascade of necroptosis. (C) The process of autophagy in cerebral
  ischemic stroke. Energy stress rapidly activates the AMPK pathway, inhibits the
  mTORC1 and VPS34 complex, and finally activates autophagy. In contrast, growth factor
  signals activate the AKT pathway and mTORC1 through PI3K and then also mTROC1 and
  inhibit autophagy. At the early stage of cerebral ischemic stroke, oxidative and
  ER stresses may induce autophagy, preventing necrosis through catabolic energy production
  and aborting apoptosis via eliminating damaged mitochondria. However, at the late
  stage of cerebral ischemic stroke, a high level of “autophagic stress” leads to
  massive lysosomal activation and ultimately, cell demise. Depending on the interplays
  between necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy, neurons may exhibit mixed features of
  cell death in ischemic stroke.
