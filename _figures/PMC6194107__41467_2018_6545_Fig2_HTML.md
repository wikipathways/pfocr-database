caption: 'Origins of centromeric breaks. Schematic of the possible causes that lead
  to chromosome breaks at centromere. a Segregation errors: merotelic attachment and
  k-fiber accumulation are the sources of lagging chromosome formation and centromere
  distortion in mitosis leading to micronuclei and centromere breaks. b DNA topology:
  the complex DNA topology enriched in catenanes is normally resolved by topoisomerases
  prior to completion of sister chromatid separation. Resolution of UFBs is also crucial
  for maintenance of genome integrity in which a fraction of those results in 53BP1
  nuclear bodies (NB) that are repaired in the next cell cycle. Alterations in the
  centromere decatenation pathway can lead to anaphase bridges and DNA breaks. c,
  d DNA replication and recombination: due to its highly repetitive sequences a non-canonical
  pathway of DNA damage and homologous recombination proteins is implicated in the
  correct completion of centromere replication in order to avoid formation of anaphase
  bridges, unscheduled recombination and, consequently, segregation errors and breaks'
