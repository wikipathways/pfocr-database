caption: 'Molecular mechanism of rosmarinic acid synergistically enhancing gefitinib
  efficacy in EGFR-mutant lung cancer by inhibiting cancer-stromal interactions and
  miR-21 signaling pathway. Schematic diagram illustrating how rosmarinic acid disrupts
  crosstalk between EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells and CAFs within the tumor microenvironment
  to enhance gefitinib efficacy. In the tumor microenvironment, EGFR-mutant HCC827
  cells and CAFs establish a reciprocal signaling network: CAFs promote cancer cell
  survival and EMT progression (decreased E-cadherin/ZO-1, increased Fibronectin/Vimentin),
  while cancer cells stimulate further CAF activation (increased FAP and FSP). This
  crosstalk is mediated by miR-21 upregulation and subsequent suppression of tumor
  suppressors PDCD4 and SPRY2. This tumor-promoting microenvironment reduces gefitinib
  efficacy through EMT transformation and stromal-mediated resistance mechanisms.
  Rosmarinic acid acts through multiple mechanisms to enhance gefitinib efficacy:
  (1) disrupting CAF-cancer cell communication by inhibiting CAF activation, (2) reversing
  EMT by restoring epithelial phenotype, (3) suppressing miR-21 signaling and restoring
  tumor suppressor function, collectively enhancing gefitinib sensitivity'
