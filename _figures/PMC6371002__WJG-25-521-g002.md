caption: 'Schematic of mechanistic cross-connection between the transforming growth
  factor beta pathway and bone morphogenetic protein signaling. Shared signalling
  components between transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) (fibrosis-related) and
  bone morphogenetic protein (iron-related) pathways have been shown in hepatic stellate
  cells and hepatocytes. Previous study demonstrated TGF-β-induced hepcidin expression
  in human macrophages, while Chen et al[] showed that this occurred through TGF-β-RII/RI
  in mouse and human hepatocytes via the non-canonical pathway involving small mothers
  against decapentaplegic protein-1/5/8 phosphorylation. ALK: Activin receptor-like
  kinase; BMPR: Bone morphogenetic protein receptor; HFE: High iron protein; HSC:
  Hepatic stellate cell; mHJV: Membrane-bound hemojuvelin protein; P: Phosphorylation;
  SMAD: Small mothers against decapentaplegic protein; TFR: Transferrin receptor;
  TGF-β-R: Transforming growth factor receptor.'
