caption: Macrophages in pancreatic cancer initiation and progression. (A) Molecular
  mechanisms proposed for macrophage-derived PDA initiation.  show that macrophages
  secrete RANTES and TNF during pancreatitis, thereby activating the NF-κB pathway
  in acinar cells. The latter induces the expression of MMP-9 to promote ADM (green
  arrows). Other mediators that may contribute to macrophage-induced ADM include IL-1α,
  the IL-6–STAT3 axis, and other NF-κB target genes, including SOX9 (red arrows; ;
  ; ; ; ; ; ; ). (B) Cellular evolution in PDA initiation and progression. In addition
  to the role of NF-κB in driving ADM and then PDA initiation (green arrows), it is
  possible that this pathway contributes to additional types of cellular reprogramming
  during PDA progression and metastasis (red arrows). Ub, ubiquitin; P, phosphorylation.
