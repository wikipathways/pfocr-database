caption: Overview of key metabolic pathways in neutrophils. In neutrophil cytosol,
  glycolysis is a primary metabolic route that transforms glucose to pyruvate via
  a number of enzymes and reactions. Pyruvate is converted to lactate and released
  out of the cells during anaerobic glycolysis in absence of oxygen. Pyruvate contributes
  to the TCA cycle after conversion to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl Co A) in the presence
  of oxygen, which results in reducing energy intermediates NADH and dihydroflavine-adenine
  dinucleotide (FADH2) to generate ATP via the electron transport chain (ETC). Neutrophils
  also use the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) to generate NADPH and riboses, which
  are then used to build nucleotides, by employing glucose-6-phosphate, a glycolytic
  pathway intermediate, as an entry point during the oxidative and non-oxidative phases
  to manufacture NADPH and riboses. NADPH modulates redox signaling and is required
  for NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production in neutrophils. Glycogen reserves become
  concentrated in neutrophils when glucose levels rise, providing glucose-based glycolytic
  intermediate supply on demand. Through fatty acid synthesis (FAS), the TCA cycle
  intermediate citrate can be converted to free fatty acids, which can then be transported
  from the extracellular environment through the FAO pathway to produce acetyl-CoA,
  which fuels the TCA cycle and produces significantly more energy in the form of
  ATP. Glutamine helps the TCA cycle by producing α-ketoglutarate through glutaminolysis.
  Neutrophils also use the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle to create NAD+ from NADH,
  which aids in mitochondrial membrane potential. HIF-1α augments the activity and
  expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3, resulting in increased glucose uptake, elevated hexokinase
  2 (HK2) and phosphofructokinase B3 (PFKFB3) enzymatic activities, and enhanced ATP
  production.
