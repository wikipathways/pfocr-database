caption: Mechanisms that ensure the fidelity of chromosome segregation, especially
  the SAC are required to maintain genome integrity and homeostasis of stem and progenitor
  cells. Whereas a growing number of studies demonstrate the activity of the SAC and
  the tetraploidy (post-mitotic) checkpoint in these cells, it is not clear yet, whether
  they also activate a pathway homologous to the DC. Strikingly, many reports illustrate
  that without these mechanisms, stem and progenitor cells may take the route towards
  chromosomal instability, provoking loss of functionality, transformation and, ultimately,
  cancer
