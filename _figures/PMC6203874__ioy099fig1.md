caption: Cholesterol-dependent cytolysin. Schematic illustration of a pore formed
  by pyolysin in a cholesterol-rich domain in the plasma membrane, allowing leakage
  of ions and cytosolic molecules, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Cholesterol
  is derived from the mevalonate pathway that initially leads to the synthesis of
  the isoprenoid farnesyl pyrophosphate, with key enzymes indicated for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A reductase (HMGCR) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS). Conversion of farnesyl
  pyrophosphate to squalene by farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1)
  is the first committed step of cholesterol synthesis, whilst geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  synthase 1 (GGPS1) yields the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. PP, pyrophosphate.
