caption: The Janus kinase 1/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK/STAT3)
  signaling cascade initiated by IL-6 stimulation is shown. Upon IL-6 binding, the
  signal transduction pathway is initiated by glycoprotein 130 (gp130) followed by
  JAK activation (not shown); phosphorylated JAKs in turn mediate the recruitment
  and phosphorylation of STAT3. Phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) is then released from
  the receptor, and pSTAT3 homodimers form and translocate to the nucleus via an importin-α/importin-β1/Ran-mediated
  mechanism or to the mitochondria, where GRIM-19, a component of complex I in the
  electron transport chain, facilitates STAT3 localization to the inner membrane.
