caption: 'Selected examples of the miRNA network regulating IL-8. 1. microRNAs regulating
  the AKT-dependent NF-kB: miR-155-5p expression is potentiated by NF-kB and is elevated
  in CF lung epithelial cells and circulating CF neutrophils biopsied from CF patients.
  High levels of miR-155 specifically reduce the levels of SHIP1, thereby promoting
  PI3K/Akt activation. Phospho-Akt levels are therefore elevated in CF lung epithelial
  cells and can be specifically lowered by either antagomir-155 or elevated expression
  of SHIP1. Elevated miR-155-5p contributes to the pro-inflammatory expression of
  IL-8 in CF lung epithelial cells by lowering SHIP1 expression and thereby activating
  the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (). 2. transcriptional regulation of IL-8 gene expression:
  IL-8 promoter is under the control of transcription factors enhancing IL-8 mRNA
  production (examples are NF-κB, AP-1, C/EBPβ, CHOP, and CREB); furthermore, IL-8
  gene expression is repressed by Oct-1 and by NF-κB repressing factor (NRF). All
  these transcription factors are regulated by microRNAs. 3. post-transcriptional
  miRNA-dependent regulation of IL-8: Fabbri et al. identified miR-93 as a miRNA that
  is decreased in cystic fibrosis IB3-1 and Cufi-1 cells infected with P. aeruginosa.
  The possible involvement of miR-93 in IL-8 gene regulation was validated using luciferase
  vectors and the results obtained indicate that IL-8 protein expression is post-transcriptionally
  regulated by interactions of the IL-8 mRNA with the inhibitory miR-93 (). The involvement
  of microRNAs in IL-8 is also supported by the study of Oglesby et al. () who identified
  miR-17 as a miRNA regulating IL-8. Interestingly, its expression was decreased in
  adult CF bronchial brushings and bronchial epithelial cells chronically stimulated
  with Pseudomonas-conditioned medium (). 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR: 5′ and 3′ untranslated region
  of the IL-8 mRNA; CDS, coding sequences.'
