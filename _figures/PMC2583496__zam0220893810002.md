caption: 'Global regulation of the E. coli K-12 W3110 metabolism during carbon-limited
  growth, derived from a genome-wide transcriptome and metabolic-flux analysis. The
  regulatory processes that are most relevant for utilization of available intra-
  and extracellular resources are proposed. mRNA/flux levels: +, increase; −, decrease;
  =, invariable. Short dashed lines, transcriptional regulation; long dashed lines,
  signaling processes (regulation of protein activities: arrowhead, positive; blunt
  end, negative). (I) A cluster of high-affinity transporters is synthesized (mglBA,
  galP, and lamB), while the activity of medium-affinity transporters is maintained.
  This is due mainly to their regulation by the Crp-cAMP complex but also to the effect
  of the transcriptional regulatory proteins MalT, YeeI, and Mlc (Fig. ). The glucose
  flux entering the cell is directed via transporters that do not use pep for phosphorylation.
  This preserves the pool of this metabolite (homeostasis) and affects the EIIAGlc∼P-dependent
  activation of cAMP synthesis through the enzyme adenylate cyclase (CyaA). (II) These
  transport systems in particular depend on a membrane proton gradient for proper
  function. The expression of the proton gradient-dependent chemotaxis system is reduced,
  thereby enabling the transport system to effectively utilize the energy available.
  (III) The flux through the upper part of glycolysis is favored, whereas the flux
  through the PPP is minimized, which is most likely due to the reduced synthesis
  of gnd mRNA. The flux entering the PPP is used for biosynthesis at the expense of
  the reflux into the glycolysis pathway, which might be regulated by the RpiA/Rpe
  split ratio. The reaction rates in the lower glycolysis decrease due to decreasing
  mRNA levels (cra modulon; signaling through fbp), thereby providing a sufficient,
  though minimal, efflux into the PPP. The carbon flux entering the TCA cycle (influx
  is enhanced via gltA expression) is split into the GS, the PEP-GS, and the full
  TCA cycle. The GS and PEP-GS provide a better pep, pyruvate (pyr), and oac precursor
  supply. It is assumed that the global regulation via the crp and cra modulons is
  the most relevant in this respect. (IV) Cellular growth is regulated predominantly
  by the stringent response (alarmone ppGpp, relA/spoT modulon). (V) No extensive
  induction of the general rpoS-dependent response could be observed (opposing regulation
  via the crp and relA/spoT modulons). It is expected that slow substrate concentration
  changes do not trigger a strong starvation response. However, other stress responses
  were detected. Details are presented in the text.'
