caption: Model of the possible mechanism of JAK2/STAT3 signalling in the apoptosis
  of CRC. Inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 induces CRC cell apoptosis, while changing the
  expression of Bcl-2 and Bax which are involved in regulating the mitochondrial membrane
  permeability. Therefore, a decrease of Δψm accompanied by the generation of ROS
  is detected after down-regulation of JAK2/STAT3 signalling. Moreover, because of
  the lowered Δψm, Cyt c is translocated from mitochondrial to cytoplasmic to activate
  the caspase cascade. Furthermore, as shown by the data in this study, activated
  caspase3 cleaves PARP finally resulting in chromosomal DNA fragmentation and CRC
  apoptosis.
