caption: 'The widely accepted generic pathway consists of black arrows. It leads to
  the biosynthesis of three hydroxycinnamyl alcohol monomers that in turn give rise
  to p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) subunits of lignin. Listed
  next to each reaction arrow are the catalyzing enzymes, which are highlighted in
  bold if considered major. The lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffi contains two bi-functional
  enzymes, SmF5H and SmCOMT, which are shown in blue. Co-expression of these two enzymes
  would permit S. moellendorffi to synthesize coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol directly
  from p-coumaryl aldehyde and p-coumaryl alcohol. By contrast, Medicago truncatula
  has two functionally distinct isoforms of CCR, which are shown in red. The green
  arrow that connects caffeyl aldehyde to coniferyl aldehyde denotes the only non-canonical
  reaction that is likely to be functional in both S. moellendorffi and M. truncatula.
