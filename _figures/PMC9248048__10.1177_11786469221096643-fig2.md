caption: The effect of Ang II and kynurenine pathway on vascular tonicity and blood
  pressure. Ang II stimulates Ang II type 1 receptor on VSMCs, which is a G protein-coupled
  receptor. G protein activates phospholipase C, leading to IP3 production from membrane
  phospholipids. IP3 opens the Ca2+ channels on sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and
  increases cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. In addition, Ang II type 1 receptor stimulation
  leads to inhibition of guanylate cyclase, downregulation of BKCa and extracellular
  Ca2 influx. In the endothelial cells, Ang II upregulates IDO and activates kynurenine
  pathway. Kynurenine metabolites, particularly kynurenine itself and xanthurenic
  acid, activate guanylate cyclase and adenylate cyclase. Guanylate cyclase converts
  GTP into cGMP, thereby activating PKG. PKG activates K+ channels and leads to VSMCs
  hyperpolarization and relaxation. Furthermore, kynurenine pathway can enhance eNOS
  function in endothelial cells to lower blood pressure. In addition to its hypertensive
  effects, Ang II activates kynurenine pathway, which acts as a counter-regulatory
  mechanism. Pharmacological augmentation of kynurenine pathway or attenuation of
  Ang II signaling pathway helps to lower blood pressure. In addition, overactivation
  of kynurenine pathway in the absence of increased concentrations of Ang II such
  as those observed in sepsis leads to hypotension. Interestingly, inflammatory response
  and increased concentration of hydrogen peroxide can lead to cis-WOOH production
  as a by-product of kynurenine pathway in the endothelial cells. Cis-WOOH can readily
  activate PKG1α, induce vasorelaxation and decrease blood pressure.
