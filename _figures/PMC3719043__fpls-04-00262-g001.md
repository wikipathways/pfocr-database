caption: Molecular structures of selected plant volatiles (BVOC) emitted in response
  to a variety of stress factors. Green leaf volatiles (GLV), also called volatiles
  of lipoxygenase pathway (LOX) are formed via the lipoxygenase pathway and constitute
  the ubiquitous stress response (; ; ). Terpenoids comprise the largest class of
  plant secondary metabolites. Various terpenoids are emitted in several constitutive
  emitters, and emissions of specific terpenoids are elicited in response to different
  stresses (; , ; ). Emissions of benzenoids and phenylpropanoids have been less investigated,
  but the constitutive emissions of these compounds are often characteristic to flowers,
  and sometimes to leaves (; ; ; ). Furthermore, methyl salicylate is a characteristic
  stress-induced volatile (; ), and there is evidence that methyl benzoate may also
  be released in response to stress (). Different biochemical pathways are responsible
  for synthesis of different compound classes (Figure ).
