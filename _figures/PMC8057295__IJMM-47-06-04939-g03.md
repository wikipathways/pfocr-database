caption: 'Models of the SHH signaling pathway in cancer. (A) Type I: Ligand-independent
  activation occurs due to either PTCH1 or SUFU inactivating mutations (blue X) or
  SMO activating mutations (yellow star), which lead to the constitutive activation
  of GLI effectors, even in the absence of the N-SHH ligand. (B) Type II: Ligand-dependent
  autocrine activation. Cancer cells both synthesize and bind to the SHH ligand, resulting
  in a positive auto-loop activation of the SHH pathway. (C) Type III: Ligand-dependent
  paracrine activation. Cancer cells secrete the SHH ligand, which is bound by the
  stromal cells leading to SHH pathway activation in the stroma. The stroma reacts
  by secreting back various cancer-stimulating signals, such as growth factors to
  the tumor tissue. (D) Type IIIb: Reverse paracrine activation. Cancer cells receive
  SHH ligand secreted from the stroma, leading to SHH signaling activation in the
  tumor cells and upregulation of survival signals. SHH, Sonic hedgehog; PTCH1, patched
  1; SUFU, SUFU negative regulator of hedgehog signaling; SMO, smoothened, frizzled
  class receptor; GLI, GLI family zinc finger.'
