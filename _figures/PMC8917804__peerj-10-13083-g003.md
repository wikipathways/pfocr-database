caption: SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into the epithelial host cells is mediated by the
  S glycoprotein binding to the cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2)
  via the RBD of the S1 subunit. The binding depends on the type II transmembrane
  serine protease (TMPRSS2) for the S protein priming () . Upon entry, the virus is
  recognized by the innate immune receptors, such as toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3),
  TLR-7/8 and RIG-1/MDA-5, leading to the subsequent production of type I interferons
  (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-7 and tumor
  necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)). Type I IFNs such as IFN-α and IFN-β are crucial
  in suppressing the propagation of the virus and essential in the activation of pro-inflammatory
  and anti-viral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway ()
  . Cytokines produced by infected cells then modulate the adaptive immune response
  via the activation of a plethora of immune cells such as macrophages, natural killer
  (NK) cells, CD4+ T cells and B cells, which produce IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies
  to neutralize the virus (; ; ). However, an unbalanced immune response that leads
  to hyperactivation of the inflammatory immune response causes a phenomenon called
  cytokine storm and its associated macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which leads
  to immune exhaustion and causes severe clinical symptoms of coronavirus disease
  2019 (COVID-19) (). Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection displayed a functional exhaustion
  of NK and CD8+ T cells, associated with an increased expression of the inhibitory
  receptor NKG2A (; ).
