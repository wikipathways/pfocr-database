caption: WEE1 and TP53 synthetic lethal interaction mechanism (by Figdraw). (A) In
  cancer cells with TP53 mutation, when SSB occurs, ATR can activate CHK1, and the
  activated CHK1 can activate WEE1, thereby inhibiting the activity of CDK1 and CDK2,
  arresting the cell cycle in G1/S and G2/M phases, and obtaining more time for cells
  to repair DNA damage. (B) After using WEE1 inhibitors in cancer cells with TP53
  mutations, the blocking effect disappears, and the cells will die due to the mitotic
  catastrophe. Yellow lightning indicates cell cycle arrest. The red arrow indicates
  that this pathway is activated. The grey arrow indicates that the pathway is inactivated.
