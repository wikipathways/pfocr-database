caption: Immune activation in the GBS UTI transcriptome comprises prominent cytokine-cytokine
  receptor signaling (innateDB pathway number 604) (A) in which 12 genes were highly
  active (red circles; expression and significance cutoffs, 2.0 and 0.1). The pathway
  is illustrated according to subcellular localization and includes the total of 255
  genes annotated in the pathway. The bladder transcriptome also includes chemokine
  signaling (innateDB pathway 4351) (B), with activation of the pathway occurring
  via 8 genes (red circles; Cxcl10, Cxcl9, and Stat2 are shown twice) among a total
  of 175 genes in the pathway.
