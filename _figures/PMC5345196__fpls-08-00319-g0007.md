caption: Proposed schematic representation of phenylpropanoid/ benzenoid biosynthetic
  pathway. Phenylpropanoid/ benzenoids are derived from phenylalanine, which itself
  is synthesized via the shikimate biosynthetic pathways. Larger arrows indicate there
  exist genes with strong expression level above 5 thousand of TPM. Each block means
  a fold change for a single gene.
