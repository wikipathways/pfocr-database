caption: Schematic representation of the cLIUS-induced chondroprotective mechanisms.
  cLIUS promoted MSC chondrogenesis by inhibiting the cytokine-induced activation
  of the NFκB signaling pathway by engaging the tIκBα feedback mechanism while upregulating
  the expression of SOX9, the collagen II transcription factor. It is also posited
  that cLIUS acts to preserve the mitochondrial potential, which is impacted by cytokines.
