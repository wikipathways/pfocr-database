caption: Schematic representation of key signaling pathways in the inflammatory process
  and potential strategies for inflammatory inhibition in cartilage repair. Use of
  anticytokine and chondroprotective drugs against IL-1, TNFα, or against their receptors
  is a direct and effective approach in the suppression of inflammation. Strategies
  targeting disturbance or intervention of key signal pathways in cytosol have been
  developed such as blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signal pathways
  or the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Using inhibitors for downstream products
  of degradative enzymes, such as MMPs, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS), and ADAMTS, can also effectively protect cartilage from degradation
  and inflammation. Growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, insulin-like
  growth factor (IGF)-I, or transforming growth factor (TGF)-β may interfere with
  inflammation by blocking the associated signal pathways. Use of growth factors is
  a possible anti-inflammatory strategy in cartilage repair despite the fact that
  growth factors can promote neocartilage formation. Color images available online

  description: Schematic representation of key signaling pathways in the inflammatory
    process and potential strategies for inflammatory inhibition in cartilage repair.
    Use of anticytokine and chondroprotective drugs against IL-1, TNFα, or against
    their receptors is a direct and effective approach in the suppression of inflammation.
    Strategies targeting disturbance or intervention of key signal pathways in cytosol
    have been developed such as blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
    signal pathways or the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Using inhibitors
    for downstream products of degradative enzymes, such as MMPs, cyclooxygenase 2

    protect cartilage from degradation and inflammation. Growth factors such as fibroblast
    growth factor (FGF)-2, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, or transforming growth
    factor (TGF)-β may interfere with inflammation by blocking the associated signal
    pathways. Use of growth factors is a possible anti-inflammatory strategy in cartilage
    repair despite the fact that growth factors can promote neocartilage formation.
