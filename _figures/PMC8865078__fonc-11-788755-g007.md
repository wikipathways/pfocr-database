caption: A working model of TGF-β-activated lncRNA-MUF-driven glioma invasion. LncRNA-MUF
  is activated through the canonical TGF-β pathway, and it in turn regulates the phosphorylation
  of Smad2/3. It sequesters miR-34a from its binding target, Snail1, resulting in
  enhanced Snail1 expression and glioma invasion through the lncRNA-MUF/miR-34a/Snail1
  signaling axis.
