caption: Two models for Gpa2 regulation of Schizosaccharomyces pombe adenylate cyclase.
  (A) Gpa2, in its GDP- or GTP-bound form, binds the N-terminal domain of adenylate
  cyclase. GTP loading onto Gpa2 triggers a change in adenylate cyclase to overcome
  an inhibitory effect of the N terminus on the catalytic domain at the C terminus.
  (B) GDP-Gpa2 binding to adenylate cyclase facilitates binding of the activated GTP-Gpa2
  to both the N-terminal domain and to a site within the catalytic domain that stimulates
  adenylate cyclase activity.
