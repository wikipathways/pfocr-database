caption: Summary of pathways linked to effects of E2 on stem cells of the musculoskeletal
  system. (A) Many effects have been linked to canonical estrogen receptors α and/or
  β. The canonical estrogen signaling pathway is pictured featuring homodimerization,
  although not all the listed effects have been linked exclusively to this pathway
  and the types of dimers formed have not been investigated. Effects seen in studies
  that did not investigate both receptors were omitted. (B) Other cell responses have
  been linked to membrane-bound estrogen receptors such as GPR30 rather than canonical
  estrogen receptors. (C) The PI3K/AKT pathway has been linked to several cell responses
  to estrogen treatment. This pathway can be activated by estrogen signaling through
  routes, including estrogen-stimulated promotion of transcription of PI3K/AKT pathway
  components and the direct binding of the estrogen/estrogen receptor complex to the
  p85 subunit of PI3K/AKT, as previously reviewed. Figure created using BioRender.com
