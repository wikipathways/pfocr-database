caption: Overview of innate immunity against RNA viruses in mammals. Viral infection
  of mammalian host cells is detected by the cell’s recognition of virus-derived double-stranded
  RNA (dsRNA), which initiates two distinct signaling pathways (TLR-3 and RLR). Although
  these two pathways differ with respect to their initiating stimuli and downstream
  effectors, they converge at the point of transcriptional activation (NF-κB or IRF-3/7),
  resulting in the rapid production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines.
  Mitochondrial antiviral immunity depends on activation of the RLR signaling pathway.
