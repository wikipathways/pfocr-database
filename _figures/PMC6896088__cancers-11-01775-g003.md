caption: Associations between the autophagy pathway and MAPK signaling in to tumor
  tolerance against targeted therapies and chemotherapies. (a) Chemotherapeutic agents,
  like 5-fluorouracil, activate the p38 MAPK pathway in response to cellular stress,
  and thus promote cell survival in colorectal cancers. Pharmacological or genetic
  inhibition of p38 MAPK induces the autophagy pathway, and autophagy inhibition in
  p38 MAPK-deficient colorectal cancer cells potentiates the cytotoxic effects of
  chemotherapy []. To date, the relationship between autophagy regulation and the
  p38 MAPK remains poorly understood. (b) Crosstalk between the autophagy pathway
  and the ERK signaling arm of the MAPK pathway has been associated with resistance
  to B-RAF inhibitors (BRAFi) or MEK inhibitors (MEKi) in melanomas. BRAFi or MEKi-mediated
  inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling has been associated with the nuclear translocation
  of ERK2, and stabilization of the transcription factor, Activating Transcription
  Factor 4 (ATF4). This promotes the transcriptional upregulation of ATF4 target genes,
  like autophagy-related genes (ATGs) ATG5 and ATG7, and ER stress response genes,
  Asparagine synthetase 3 (ASN3), Cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF3),
  and C/EBP-Homologous Protein (CHOP) [].
