caption: Sources and clearance mechanisms of circulating T3 in humans. The daily T3
  production in a 70-kg adult individual is ∼30 μg/d. The thyroid gland contributes
  with ∼5 μg/d and the rest is produced outside of the thyroid parenchyma via two
  deiodinase-mediated pathways, D1 and D2; the latter is the most important source
  of circulating T3 in humans. Even though the thyroid contributes with a small fraction
  of the circulating T3, thyroidal T3 secretion is upregulated in response to TSH
  stimulation. This occurs through an increase in the T3/T4 ratio in the thyroglobulin
  and through increased thyroidal conversion of T4 to T3. Through this mechanism and
  the homeostatic changes in deiodinase activity, circulating levels of T3 are maintained
  fairly stable throughout the day. T3 is cleared from the circulation by deiodination
  via the D3 pathway that converts T3 to T2, as well as hepatic glucuronidation and
  sulfation, the latter followed by deiodination via the D1 pathway. In cells expressing
  D1, the T3 residence time inside the cells is relatively short, that is, ∼30 minutes,
  whereas in D2-expressing cells the residence time is several hours. This is probably
  the result of distinct subcellular localization of D1 vs D2, plasma membrane vs
  ER, respectively. Additionally, T3 produced in D2-expressing cells finds its way
  to the cell nucleus and binds to TRs, triggering biological effects. See reviews
  for more details (). [Adapted with permission from “Hypothyroidism, thyroid hormones
