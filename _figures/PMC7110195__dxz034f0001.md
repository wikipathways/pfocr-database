caption: Nucleic acid sensors inducing type I and type III interferons. During viral
  infection, virus-derived nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are mainly targeted by host
  nucleic acid sensors triggering the gene expression of type I and III interferons
  to induce anti-viral activities. As RNA sensors, TLR3 and TLR7/TLR8 sense viral
  RNAs on the endosomal or lysosomal membrane. RIG-I and MDA5 are ubiquitously expressed
  and recognize viral RNAs in the cytoplasmic space. Other RNA helicases DDX1, DDX21
  and DHX36 form an RNA sensor complex in mDCs. The Nod-like receptor (NLR) NOD2 also
  detects the RSV-derived ssRNA genome to activate the MAVS/IPS-1 pathway. In the
  cases of DNA sensing, TLR9 detects DNA containing the unmethylated CpG motif. DAI
  (DLM-1/ZBP1) interacts with dsDNA and activates TBK1 and IRF-3 as a cytoplasmic
  DNA sensor. Cytoplasmic AT-rich dsDNA (B-DNA) is transcribed by host RNA polymerase
  III (RNA pol III) into 5′-triphosphate RNA (3pRNA), which becomes a RIG-I ligand.
  DHX36 and DHX9 intracellularly sense CpG class A and B, respectively, in mDCs. DNA-stimulated
  DDX41 and the ALR IFI16 interact with their adaptor protein STING. STING itself
  also serves as a sensor of CDNs such as bacterium-derived c-di-GMP as well as host-derived
  cGAMP generated by cGAS in response to microbe- and host-derived cytosolic DNAs.
  cGAS is a critical cytoplasmic sensor for the detection of both microbial and host
  DNAs. The cGAS–cGAMP–STING pathway is now recognized as a major intracellular dsDNA
  sensing pathway. DNA-PK, Ku70 and extrachromosomal histone H2B are also reported
  to function as cytosolic DNA sensors. As for Ku70, only type III interferon is induced.
  LRRFIP1 functions possibly as a cytosolic nucleic acid sensor that dually detects
  both RNA and DNA. HMGBs also bind to both double-stranded and single-stranded immunogenic
  RNAs and function as universal sensors for nucleic acid-mediated innate immune responses
  during viral infection.
