caption: 'Factors that increase IL-6 production in response to various stimuli. Increased
  IL-6 production is associated with stimuli such as infection and inflammation. Infection,
  injury, and cancer can all stimulate inflammation that can lead to the increase
  of IL-6-modulating factors such as IL-1β, COX-2, PGE2, and TGF-β. Infection can
  also promote LPS secretion from bacteria, which increases NF-κB-dependent IL-6 levels.
  There are two main IL-6 production pathways: NF-κB-dependent and NF-κBindependent.
  NF-κB-independent pathways upregulate IL-6 secretion via TGF-β or PGE2, which is
  produced downstream of COX-2 activation. In the NF-κB-dependent pathway, LPS or
  IL-1β stimulate NF-κB activity that causes an increase in IL-6 production.Abbreviations:
  COX-2, cyclooxygenase 2; IL-1β, interleukin 1β; IL-6, interleukin 6; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
