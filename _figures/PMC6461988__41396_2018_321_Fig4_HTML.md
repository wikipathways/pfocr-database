caption: Reconstructed key metabolic pathways of Thermoprofundales based on eight
  MAGs (a). Enzymes identified in over half of the eight MAGs are labeled in bold,
  those identified in less than half of the eight MAGs are labeled normally, and those
  for which no genes were found in any MAGs are labeled in gray. The extracellular
  and intracellular peptidases listed are those occurring in more than six out of
  the eight MAGs. Pathways for which no genes were found are drawn with dashed lines.
  The H4MPT C1 carrier-dependent WL pathway and incomplete dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate
  cycle are depicted according to MAG M9B2D and SG8-52-3, respectively. Euclidean-clustering-based
  gene presence heatmap (b). The presence/absence of protein encoding genes are represented
  by the heatmap, and the Euclidean clustering among all the MAGs was based on the
  presence–absence binary matrix of the metabolic genes
