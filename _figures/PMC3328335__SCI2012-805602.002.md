caption: Scheme showing the essential functions of Notch in blood and vascular cell
  types (a) Osteocyte Dll/Jag-induced Notch signaling in hematopoietic stem cells
  (HSCs) is involved in their generation and self-renewal in the adult. (b) Notch
  signaling pathway is required for endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) development
  and function. EPCs from bone marrow niches will, in response to Notch, differentiate
  in endothelial cells (ECs) and populate sites of ischemia participating in vascularization.
  (c) Schematic representation of a growing blood vessel. In angiogenesis, Notch ligand
  DLL4 is upregulated in response to VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling in tip cells, that are
  specified ECs (dark yellow) capable of sprouting by extending filopodia. Upregulated
  DLL4 in tip cells activates Notch in the neighbor stalk ECs (light yellow) inhibiting
  their sprouting capacity. Notch activation in stalk cells will result in further
  DLL4 upregulation, which eventually will activate Notch in adjacent cells. SMCs,
  covering the endothelium are represented in green. (d) Notch induces arterial specification
  of ECs by upregulating the expression of arterial markers, such as EphrinB2. The
  lack of Notch in venous endothelial cells allows the expression of venous markers,
  such as COUP-TFII. Notch regulates also smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation
  by inducing the expression of SMC-specific markers (e.g., αSMA, SM-MHC, SMα22, and
  SM calponin).
