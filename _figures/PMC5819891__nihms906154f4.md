caption: 'This concept diagram conveys a way neurocybernetics and medical biocybernetics
  can be linked. Neurocybernetics is focused on the complex systems biologic network,
  and medical biocybernetics deals with the negative feedback regulation that is necessary
  for homeostasis. This Figure depicts homeostatic regulation of blood pressure during
  infusion of a vasoconstrictor. (A) Reflexive responses to a vasoconstrictor involve
  increased baroreceptor afferent traffic to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS),
  followed by activation of the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM). Release of the
  inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA from the CVLM terminating in the rostral ventrolateral
  medulla (RVLM) inhibits RVLM outflow to the sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons (SPN)
  in the intermediolateral columns of the spinal cord, resulting in decreased post-ganglionic
  sympathetic noradrenergic system (SNS) traffic and decreased delivery of norepinephrine
  (NE) to its receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells. Green positive signs indicate
  positive relationships, and the red negative sign indicates a negative relationship.
  Because there is a single negative relationship in the feedback loop, the blood
  pressure attains a steady-state value lower than that produced by the vasoconstrictor
  in the absence of the feedback loop. (B) Nodes and relationships in the central
  autonomic network that mediate modulation of the blood pressure response. (C) Input-output
  curves at ascending levels of the neuraxis. Locus ceruleus (LC) activation as part
  of vigilance shifts the relationship between activity of rostral ventrolateral medulla
  (RVLM) neurons and blood pressure; a defence reaction evoked at the level of the
  hypothalamus shifts the curve relating LC activity to blood pressure; classically
  conditioned fear shifts the relationship between paraventricular nucleus (PVN) activity
  and blood pressure; and instrumentally conditioned avoidance shifts the relationship
  between cortical activity and blood pressure. (D) Hypothetical pathway by which
  release from cortical restraint exerts a feed-forward inhibition of baroreflex regulation
  of blood pressure. (E) The adjustments in the input-output curves have the net effect
  of resetting a hypothetical “barostat.” Other abbreviations: Class. Cond.=classical
  conditioned; Instr. Cond.=instrumentally conditioned.'
