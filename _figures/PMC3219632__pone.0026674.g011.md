caption: Upon IGF-1 stimulation of neural cells, Jak2 is activated which then activates
  Stat5. Phosphorylated Stat5 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus and acts as a
  transcription factor for SOCS6 which in turn promotes differentiation. SOCS6 then
  binds to IGFR and forms a trio complex with Jak2 leading to the inhibition of further
  Jak2-Stat5 signalling.
