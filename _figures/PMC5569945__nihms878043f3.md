caption: S6K1 acts as a negative regulator of mTORC1 activity by creating negative
  feedback loops. mSin1 and Rictor, two components of mTORC2, are required for mTORC2-dependent
  phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473. S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of mSin1 at Thr-86
  and Thr-398 results in dissociation of mSin1 from mTORC2 thus impairing the overall
  mTORC2 activity and subsequently diminishing Akt activation level. S6K1 could also
  regulate mTORC2 activity by phosphorylating Rictor, another component of mTORC2.
  Following mTORC1-dependent activation, S6K1 phosphorylates Rictor at Thr-1135. Phosphorylation
  of Rictor at Thr-1135 results in inhibition of Akt activity. S6K1 also inhibits
  Akt-mTORC1 activity by phosphorylating IRS-1 on Ser-302, which results in disruption
  of the interaction between IRS-1 and insulin receptor and subsequent inhibition
  of PI3K-mediated Akt activation. Inhibition of Akt activity, an upstream positive
  regulator of mTORC1, results in a reduction in mTORC1 activation.
