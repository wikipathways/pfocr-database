caption: 'Proposed mechanism involved in short-term response (+48h) to the early defoliation
  in mandarin fruit based on q-PCR analyses of gene expression, enzymatic activities,
  and metabolite content. Sucrose and hexose content was near to control values despite
  the carbohydrate limitation. Partial defoliation leads to (1) vacuolar sucrose degradation,
  mediated by acid INV (acid invertase) enzyme associated with (2) enhanced glycolytic
  flux shown through increased PFK (phosphofructokinase) activity. (3) Malate synthesis
  mediated by PEPC (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) is increased during carbohydrate
  limitation to maintain citrate synthesis via the TCA cycle. (4a) The high expression
  level of the transporter CsCit1 and (4b) enhanced NADP-IDH (NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase)
  activity show the mobilization of citrate from the vacuole to the cytosol, where
  citrate is used to form glutamate. (5) The GABA shunt pathway seems to be increased
  during in response to early defoliation to feed the TCA cycle and sustain the respiration
  rate. Orange circles indicate the transporters, blue and red arrows indicate an
  increase and decrease in metabolite or enzyme 48h after the defoliation, respectively.
  Abbreviations: Acid INV, acid invertase, NADP-IDH, NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase,
  P5CS, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase; PFK, phosphofructokinase, SSADH, succinate
  semialdehyde dehydrogenase; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid. (For interpretation of
