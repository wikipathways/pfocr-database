caption: 'Kynurenine pathway and tryptophan metabolism in the central nervous system.
  In the central nervous system (CNS), the kynurenine pathway starts by the conversion
  of tryptophan into kynurenine by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), IDO2, or
  tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). Astrocytes can express both types of enzymes while
  microglia express only IDO [, ]. To a lesser extent, some neurons also possess IDO
  and/or TDO producing a minor portion of kynurenine []. Therefore, kynurenine is
  available in the CNS via the enzymatic activity of astrocytes, microglia, and some
  neurons as well as the kynurenine being actively transported into the brain by the
  large neutral amino acid transporter []. Next, kynurenine can follow either of two
  metabolic branches. First, it can be metabolized into kynurenic acid (KYNA) via
  kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) [, , ] in astrocytes mainly [] and neurons through
  irreversible transamination by KAT []. The other branch leads to the formation of
  quinolinic acid (QUIN) exclusively in both microglia and infiltrating macrophages.
  Both can express kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) which is absent in human astrocytes
  []. However, both astrocytes and neurons can further catabolize QUIN, produced by
  neighboring microglial cells, by the enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase
  (QPRTase) []. They can also form the neuroprotective picolinic acid (PIC) as they
  express the enzyme aminocarboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) []. Molecules:
  3HAA, 3-hydroxyanthranilic; 3HK, 3-hydroxy-kynurenine; AA, anthranilic acid; ACMS,
  2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde; KYN, kynurenine; KYNA, kynurenic acid; NAD+,
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; PIC, picolinic acid; QUIN, quinolinic acid; TRP,
  tryptophan; XA, xanthurenic acid. Enzymes: 3-HAO, 3-hydroxyanthranlic acid oxygenase;
  ACMSD, aminocarboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase; IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase;
  KAT, kynurenine aminotransferase; KMO, kynurenine 3-monooxy-genase; KYNU, kynureninase;
  QPRT, quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase; TDO, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase.
