caption: ER signaling, targeted therapies, and endocrine resistance. (A) ER signaling
  as dominant driver of cell proliferation and survival. The binding of estrogen to
  the ER protein results in its interaction with DNA, either directly at EREs of promoter/enhancer
  regions of target genes (classical nuclear genomic pathway) or indirectly by tethering
  to other transcription factors, including AP-1 and SP-1, at their DNA binding sites
  (non-classical nuclear genomic pathway). Estrogen-activated ER also interacts with
  coactivators (CoA) that facilitate its transcriptional activity. Ultimately, the
  transcription of ER target genes promotes cell proliferation, survival, and invasion.
  A small fraction of the cellular ER pool also resides at, or in proximity to, the
  plasma membrane, where it interacts with and promotes the activity of RTKs and other
  cellular kinases (non-nuclear/non-genomic pathway). Nuclear ER genomic activity
  is predominant in tumor cells with low growth factor receptor signaling and can
  be effectively inhibited by endocrine therapy with tamoxifen (T), fulvestrant (F),
  and Als. (B) Bidirectional crosstalk between the ER and HER pathways and resistance
  to endocrine therapy. In the presence of hyperactive HER signaling (such as in HER2+
  tumors or in case of acquired overexpression of HER receptors during endocrine therapy),
  activated downstream kinases (e.g. Akt and MAPK) reduce ER expression at both the
  mRNA and protein levels. At the same time, these kinases phosphorylate ER and its
  coregulators, potentiating and modulating ER transcriptional activity and negating
  the effect of endocrine therapy. In addition, cytoplasmic/membrane ER non-genomic
  activity is increased, leading to further activation of the HER pathway by direct
  or indirect interaction with the HER receptors, G proteins, and other intracellular
  kinases. Non-nuclear/non-genomic ER activity can be stimulated rather than inhibited
  by tamoxifen. Collectively, these molecular events together contribute to intrinsic
  and acquired endocrine resistance.
