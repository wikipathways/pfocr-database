caption: mTOR pathway and its inhibition by rapamycin (RAPA) and pp242 after spinal
  cord injury (SCI). RAPA, attached to FKBP12, inhibits mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which
  leads to decreased phosphorylation of downstream proteins S6, eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), autophagy activation through ULK1
  and transcription factor EB (TFEB), and reduced inflammation. A negative feedback
  loop through disinhibition of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS) is also induced
  with RAPA inhibition, which leads to activation of AKT, through phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) conversion to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
  (PIP3) by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Akt inhibits tuberous sclerosis complex
  (TSC), which leads to disinhibition of the small GTPase RHEB (Ras homolog–mTORC1
  binding) and RHEB activates mTORC1. Inhibition of mTORC1 and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)
  by pp242 leads to inhibition of AKT and, therefore, more effective inhibition of
  the mTOR pathway. Panels on the right display observed changes in protein modifications
  and physiological responses during inhibition of the mTOR pathway after SCI compared
  to vehicle treated controls. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN); ribosomal protein
  S6 kinase 1 (S6K1).
