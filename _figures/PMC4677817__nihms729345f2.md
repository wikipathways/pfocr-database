caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming of the inflammatory (LPS/IFNγ activated) macrophage
  involves increased expression of HIF1 and PKM2 protein, which increases glycolysis.
  Concomitant suppression of CARKL increases the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  providing antioxidants reducing equivalents (NADPH). ATP generated by glycolysis
  is used to maintain energy demands in the face of concomitantly reduced mitochondrial
  respiration (reduced oxphos), which occurs secondary to inhibition of SDH (which
  is complex II, C2).Glycolysis derived ATP is also used to fuel “in reverse” operating
  ATP synthase in the mitochondria in order to maintain membrane potential and mitochondrial
  integrity. The inhibition of SDH promotes accumulation of succinate, which inhibits
  cytosolic prolylhydroxylases (PHDs) which usually mediate HIF1 degradation, thus
  increasing HIF1 stabilization and thus increased transcription of Il1b and glycolytic
  enzymes, and Arginase1. Succinate also inhibits complex I in the mitochondria which
  promotes ROS generation, which in turn enhances PHD inhibition and cytokine generation
  through stabilization of HIF1. In addition, expression of IDH is suppressed, resulting
  in citrate accumulation. To maintain anerplerosis of TCA cycle intermediates, inflammatory
  macrophages upregulate the argininosuccinate and citrulline-arginine cycle (orange),
  modify the malate aspartate shuttle (green) towards utilization of the argininiosuccinate
  cycle (red). This maintains fumarate anerplerosis and regenerates arginine for NO
  synthesis by iNOS. Furthermore, Arginine can be used for glutamate synthesis to
  replenish the TCA cycle in order to maintain succinate generation. Upregulation
  of the argininosuccinate and citrulline-arginine cycle also makes cells less sensitive
  to extracellular arginine limitation. NO also inhibits the respiratory chain further
  enhancing ROS production and succinate accumulation (not depicted). In the mitochondria,
  disruption of electron transport chain (inhibition of SDH that is Complex2, and
  production of NO) promotes reverse electron transport on complex 1 (yellow line),
  which increase ROS formation. Reduced proton gradient reduced membrane potential
  (not shown), which is prevented from breaking down completely by ATP synthase operating
  in reverse.ASS: Argininosuccinate synthase; ASL: Argininosuccinate lyase; a-KG:
  alpha-ketoglutarate; C1-C4: complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory electron
  transport chain 1–4. PHDs: prolyl hydroxylases; iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase;
