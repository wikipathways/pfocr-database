caption: K-state regulation in domesticated and undomesticated strains. Dotted lines
  indicate weak or absent processes. In domesticated B. subtilis a promoter mutation
  decreases the rate of degQ transcription. The resulting low level of DegQ decreases
  DegU phosphorylation, relieving repression at the srfA promoter. As a result more
  ComS is synthesized and the degradation of ComK by MecA/ClpCP is decreased. It is
  not known whether the effect of DegU-P on srfA transcription is mediated by direct
  binding to the srfA promoter.
