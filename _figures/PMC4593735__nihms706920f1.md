caption: 'Viruses can be detected by one of four classes of pathogen recognition receptors
  in cytoplasm or endosome of CNS cells: TLRs (e.g., TLR3 and TLR7), RLRs (e.g., RIG-I
  and MDA5), NLRs (e.g., NLRP3), or DNA sensors (e.g., cGAS). Engagement of dsRNA
  and ssRNA by TLR3 or TLR7 results in the respective activation of TRIF and MyD88
  dependent signaling pathways to induce expression of proinflammatory cytokines and
  type I IFNs. RLR activation by viruses triggers MAVS-dependent signaling to activate
  the transcription factors IRF-3, IRF-7, and NF-κB to trigger expression of type
  I IFNs and immunomodulatory cytokines. Type I IFN binds to its receptor in an autocrine
  and paracrine manner and induces expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes
  (ISGs) that inhibit different viral infections by a variety of mechanisms. As an
  example, PKR, RNase L, IFIT2, and viperin inhibit WNV infection in the CNS. PKR
  also confers antiviral effects via the autophagy pathway. SARM-1, which is activated
  by MAVS signaling, can induce neuronal apoptosis. cGAS detects DNA viruses and activates
  STING signaling pathways that lead to induction of IRF-3-dependent genes. Several
  miRNA can augment (miR-155/29b) or inhibit antiviral/inflammatory signaling (miR-132/146)
  or promote neuronal survival (miR-135). Finally, virus infection can activate the
  NLRP3 inflammasome through undefined pathogen associated molecular patterns, to
  trigger caspase-1 activation. This protease cleaves pro-IL-β generated by NF-κB
  signaling to its mature form, which is then secreted. Some of the IL-β antiviral
  signaling may be mediated by an IRF-1 transcriptional response.'
