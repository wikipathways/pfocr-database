caption: Production of [13C-1]ribose or [13C3-1,4,5]ribose in the oxidative or non-oxidative
  PPP from [13C2-1,2]glucose. Example scheme depicting generation of singly labeled
  ribose from the oxidative PPP or triply labeled ribose from the non-oxidative PPP.
  Glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) enters the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to produce
  M + 1 ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P), which enters the non-oxidative branch to produce
  xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P) and ribose 5-phosphate (R5P). Transketolase (TK) transfers
  the first two carbons of X5P to R5P to produce [13C2-1,3]sedoheptulose 7-phosphate
  (S7P). Transaldolase (TA) transfers the first three carbons from S7P to glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate (GA3P), which can be derived from glycolysis (arrow) to produce F6P.
  TK then transfers two carbons from F6P to produce X5P and subsequently R5P. Note
  that F6P derived from X5P via TK can re-enter glycolysis to produce [13C1-3]GA3P
  and subsequently [13C1-3]lactate. Striped circles indicate labeled carbons derived
  from non-oxidative PPP. Other isotopomers are possible and are not shown for simplicity.
  E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate.
