caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanisms of action of miR-21 showing the regulation
  of the WNT signaling pathway in NAFLD mice. Red arrows represent inhibition, green
  arrows represent promotion, and the yellow line represents migration from the cytoplasm
  into the nucleus When the classical WNT/β-catenin signal is activated, the expression
  of PPAR-γ is inhibited; however, our experimental results were reversed, and thus,
  we do not know association between PPAR-γ and the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  Thus, due to this uncertainty, question marks (???) were added next to PPAR-γ in
  the figure. NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β;
  LRP6, low-density lipoprotein-related receptor 6; SREBP1/2, sterol regulatory element-binding
  transcription factor 1/2; IGF1, insulin-like growth factor 1; mTOR, mammalian target
  of rapamycin.
