caption: Proposed model for PAO-derived H2O2 participation in stress and development.
  That PAO correlates with development was previously highlighted by Paschalidis and
  Roubelakis-Angelakis, and Paschalidis et al. During development, intrinsic clues
  induce PA catabolism and generation of H2O2. This molecule seems to act as signal
  to activate Ca2+ channels, and stomata closure (herein). Higher Spd titers or increased
  PAO activity results to high levels of H2O2 that activate Ca2+ channels, but the
  Ca2+ influx is either not restricted or the influx is exceedingly high leading to
  deleterious effects. Under stress, PA exodus into the apoplast is signaled where
  it is oxidized by PAO. The generated H2O2 induces either expression of tolerance-effector
  genes or the PCD syndrome. The decision depends both, on the size of the H2O2 and
  on the restoration of intracellular PA homeostasis, which is brought about by the
  simultaneous induction of the PA biosynthetic genes. All the previous reinforce
  the view that only optimal oxidation of Spd by PAO can lead to normal molecular
  responses. Moreover, in the case of the control of cation channels the back-conversion
  pathway seems to possess significant role, but yet a role for this pathway in other
  responses, like effector-genes induction remains to be established.
