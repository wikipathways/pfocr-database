caption: 'The role of SRC kinase during platelet activation. Left side: In circulating
  resting platelets, SRC is maintained in an inactive closed conformation, mediated
  through Y530 phosphorylation by C-terminal SRC kinase (CSK), and is coupled to the
  β subunit of integrin αIIbβ3. Right side: Fibrinogen binding initiates integrin
  αIIbβ3 dimerization and platelet activation. After dephosphorylation of Y530 by
  protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) and (auto)phosphorylation of Y419, SRC becomes
  active and initiates downstream outside-in signaling. SRC activates the focal adhesion
  kinase FAK, that in turn activates α-actinin (ACTN1) or recruits new binding partners
  such as GRB2, talin (TLN1), paxillin (PXN), and vinculin (VCL), which mobilize FAK
  to focal adhesions. SRC can also phosphorylate PLCγ2, which plays an important role
  in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia during platelet spreading by mediating
  calcium signaling and PKC activity. Additionally, SRC can phosphorylate tyrosine
  kinase SYK, coupled to the FcγRIIa receptor, that in turn phosphorylates tyrosine
  kinase PYK2, which further activates PLCγ2 or connects the outside-in signaling
  pathway with class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to mediate thrombus stability
  via the small GTPase RAP1B.'
