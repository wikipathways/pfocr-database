caption: Estrogenoids contribute to the development of uterine fibroids through alterations
  in epigenetic pathways [17, 56]. DES exposure activated the PI3K/AKT pathway in
  cells of MCF-7 and ELT3, in neonatal Eker rats during postnatal days 10, 11, 12,
  phosphorylating EZH2 at S21 and reducing H3K27Me3, leading to gene reprogramming
  of PR and IGFBP5, increasing the risk of uterine leiomyoma. Genistein exposure in
  neonatal Eker rats during postnatal days 10, 11, 12, activated PI3K/AKT signaling,
  phosphorylating AKT at S473/T308 and S6 at S235/236. This leads to EZH2 phosphorylation
  at S21, reducing H3K27me3 levels and increasing estrogen-responsive gene expression,
  promoting uterine leiomyomas. Figure drawn by the author using BioRender based on
