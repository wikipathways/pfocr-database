caption: A putative schematic representation of the mTOR signaling pathway in APS.
  After stimulation with growth factors, cytokines, or aPL, mTORC1 can also be activated
  in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK or PI3K/AKT signaling pathways via the phosphorylation of
  the TSC complex and Rheb binding. pAKT negativity suggests that mTORC1 activation
  occurs via the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway to increase S6 protein. In addition to regulating
  mTORC1, pAKT is also a substrate of mTORC2; therefore, the absence of pAKT may indicate
  that mTORC2 is not activated. Furthermore, mTORC1 inhibits mTORC2 activation by
  negatively regulating PI3K/AKT signaling through the S6 protein. Increased hypoxia
  and oxidative stress may also enhance mTORC1 activity involving HIF-1, REDD1, the
  TSC complex, and Rheb protein. Active mTORC1 and elevated S6 levels mediate increased
  cell proliferation, cell survival, cell growth, and inflammation, which promote
  vasculopathy (APS, antiphospholipid syndrome; aPL, antiphospholipid antibodies;
