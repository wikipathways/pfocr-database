caption: 'Scheme showing how tryptophan plays a role in the development of type 1
  diabetes mellitus (type 1 DM) and type 2 DM. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid.
  Gut bacteria convert tryptophan into indole derivatives: indol-3-acetic acid, indoxyl-3-sulfate,
  indole-3-propionic acid, and indole-3-aldehyde that are ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AHR). Tryptophan indole derivatives activate AHR in gut-resident T cells
  and innate lymphoid cells that produce IL-22, which protects against inflammation.
  Tryptophan metabolites by signaling through AHR influence a type 1 IFN signaling
  pathway that reduces NF-κB-driven inflammation (via SOCS2) and inhibits/ameliorates
  autoimmunity. Thus, tryptophan and its indole metabolites may have a role in autoimmune
  diseases (AID), such as type 1 DM and central nervous system AID. Tryptophan is
  also the precursor of serotonin that has immunomodulatory and cytoprotective actions
  (see Figure ) and enhances lipoxin A4 production (unpublished data) and possibly
  that of resolvins, protectins, and maresins; anti-inflammatory bioactive lipids,
  which prevent type 1 DM (see Figure ).'
