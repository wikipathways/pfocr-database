caption: In normal glucose, endothelial cells take up glucose from the blood via glucose
  transporters (GLUT) and sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLT). Glucose can then be
  metabolized, primarily via glycolysis. Pyruvate is shuttled into the mitochondria
  to be metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or converted to lactate
  and transported out of the cell via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT). Alternatively,
  glucose can be transported to the vessel wall or parenchymal tissue paracellularly
  through cell–cell junctions or transcellularly via GLUTs and SGLTs at the cell abluminal
  surface. In high glucose, endothelial cells take up more glucose and increase glucose
  metabolism via glycolysis. Some of the excess glycolytic intermediate metabolites
  are shunted down glycolytic side branch pathways that contribute to endothelial
  dysfunction, including the polyol, pentose phosphate, hexosamine biosynthetic, and
  methylglyoxal pathways. Side branch pathway metabolism is further increased by superoxide
  overproduction from excess mitochondrial metabolism. Excess glucose also increases
  protein kinase C (PKC) activation, changes microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding
  RNA (lncRNA) expression, and increases extracellular vesicle (EV) release while
  changing EV contents.
