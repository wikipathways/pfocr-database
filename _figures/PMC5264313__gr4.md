caption: Microarray analysis reveals alterations in the expression of major pathways
  of cellular metabolism in response to changes in collagen extracellular matrix density.A.
  Diagram of different enzymes in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transport
  chain and serine synthesis pathway regulated by changes in extracellular collagen
  matrix density in 4T1 cells. Green indicates downregulation in 4T1 cells in a HD
  collagen matrix while red indicates upregulation of gene in a HD collagen matrix.
  (N = 5, Fold change >± 1.2, and filtered for significance p < 0.01). For Complex
  I to IV, the number of genes altered in the complex is expressed as a fraction of
  the total number of genes that contribute to that complex. B. Representative images
  for protein immunoblotting for some enzymes in each metabolic pathway. C. Densitometry
  changes for these immunoblots in 4T1 and 4T07 cells. (HD/LD mean fold change ± 95%
  confidence interval) (4T1 HD/LD confidence interval for PDK1 = 0.130–0.697, pPDH = 0.241–0.752,
  Hexokinase II = 0.539–0.809. p < 0/05 by one-sample t-test.).(PFK1 – Phosphofructokinase
  1, PHGDH – 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, PSAT – Phosphoserine aminotransferase,
  PSPH – Phosphoserine phosphatase, SHMT – Serine hydroxymethyl transferase, PDK –
