caption: Brain lobes and the ring gland are indicated. Ecdysone synthesis is triggered
  when insulin released from the IPCs and PTTH released from the PG-LPs activate the
  PI3K and Ras pathways, respectively, in the PG. These two pathways, acting together,
  activate transcription of the PG-specific “Halloween genes”, which encode the ecdysone
  biosynthetic enzymes, ultimately triggering ecdysone synthesis. Arrows indicate
  activation pathways for which there is experimental evidence in Drosophila, hatched
  arrow indicates a speculative activation pathway.
