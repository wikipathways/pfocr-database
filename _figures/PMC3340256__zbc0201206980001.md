caption: tBID structure and mechanism of action. Death signals mediated by the death
  receptors Fas/TNF activate caspase-8, which cleaves BID at the N terminus and forms
  a truncated active BID fragment (tBID). tBID is recruited by MTCH2 to the mitochondria,
  enabling it to induce activation of Bax/Bak. The activation of Bax/Bak leads to
  cytochrome c release, resulting in an apoptotic response.
