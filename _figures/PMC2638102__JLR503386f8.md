caption: Links between MAP kinase signaling cascades and control of LDL receptor expression
  in HepG2 cells. Stimulation of HepG2 cells with TPA rapidly activates the three
  major MAPK pathways. While TPA is a potent activator of several PKC isoforms, it
  remains possible that some effects of TPA on the MAPK cascades are independent of
  PKC. This may be particularly true for the p38MAPKpathway, because pretreatment
  with the PKC inhibitor BIM did not detectably alter activation of p38MAPK following
  TPA treatment (). Details describing different steps in the induction of LDL receptor
  expression following activation of the MAPK pathways are related in the text.
