caption: Upon binding to their receptors, IFNs induce the activation of the JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway. Type I IFNs first bind to the extracellular part of type I IFN
  heterodimeric receptor complex IFN-α/β R1 and IFN-α/β R2. Receptor engagement subsequently
  activates IFN-alpha/beta R1 and IFN-α/β R2, resulting in conformational changes
  in their associated intracellular tyrosine residues Tyk2 and JAK1 protein tyrosine.
  Both type I and III IFNs use JAK1 for their signaling. Apart from IFNL-R1 receptor,
  type III IFNs also use IL-10 receptor beta (IL-10R2) receptor complex. Following
  JAK activation, STAT1/STAT2 are recruited and activated, which leads to their dimerization
  and binding to IRF9 and ISRE, forming the ISGF3 complex. Upon JAK activation, STAT1
  homodimer complex are also formed, which translocate into the nucleus, and drives
  ISG production. STAT1 homodimers interact with GAS to induce a pro-inflammatory
  response. GAS, gamma activated sequences; IFN, interferon; IRF9, interferon regulatory
  factor 9; ISGF3, interferon stimulated gene factor 3; ISRE, interferon-stimulated
  regulatory element, JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of
  transcription; TYK2, tyrosine Kinase 2. Figure created with BioRender.com (accessed
