caption: Positioning of MAPK signaling cascades upstream of NO and ROS production.
  The P. infestans elicitor, INF1, induces the tobacco MAPK cascade, MEK2-SIPK/NTF4,
  leading to production of NO. NO synthesis is abolished by VIGS of NOA1 even in the
  presence of INF1. However, INF1 does not induce expression of NOA1 suggesting post-transcriptional
  control of NOA1-influenced NO production by MEK2-SIPK/NTF4. Similarly, MEK2 activates
  SIPK, with phosphorylation of NTF4 resulting in ROS production. However, ROS production
  can also occur via the MEK1-SIPK-NTF6 pathway. Both routes lead to activation of
  RbohB, with VIGS of RbohB, SIPK, or NTF6 resulting in the absence of the Rboh-mediated
  oxidative burst. MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK2, MAPK kinase; NTF4,
  Nicotiana Fus-3-like kinase 4; SIPK, SA-induced protein kinase; VIGS, virus-induced
  gene silencing.
