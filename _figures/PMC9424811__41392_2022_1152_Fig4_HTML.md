caption: RNF proteins orchestrate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Upon activation
  by dsDNA, cytosolic cGAS triggers STING activation and translocation through synthesizing
  cGAMP, consequently inducing IFN-I and inflammatory cytokines production. RNF proteins
  can target multiple steps in the DNA sensing signal pathway. Overview of the RNF
  proteins that positively (green arrows) or negatively (red T-shaped solid line)
