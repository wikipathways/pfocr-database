caption: (A-D) We propose a revised Hippo Pathway model. The schematics show a simplified
  model of Drosophila Hippo Pathway core components Hpo, Sav, Mats, and Wts and downstream
  targets DIAP1, Yki, and Rae1. Due to the complexity of the Hippo signaling network,
  not all upstream regulators, downstream targets, or crosstalk with other pathways
  are pictured. (A) When the Hippo Pathway is active (“ON”), DIAP1 is down-regulated
  transcriptionally due to Yki inactivation [] and post-translationally by direct
  phosphorylation by the core cassette [, ]. Inactivation of Yki restricts cell growth
  (for example, due to decreased bantam (ban) transcription [] and myc transcription
  [], not pictured) and impairs S-phase entry by decreasing cyclin E transcription
  []. Down-regulation of Rae1 impairs S-phase entry () and mitotic progression in
  part by promoting cycA and cycB loss (). (B) When the Hippo Pathway is inactive
  (“OFF”), Yki promotes increased ban [] and myc [] (not pictured) and DIAP1 [] transcription
  to promote growth and survival. DIAP1 levels increase further to promote cell death
  resistance due to the absence of de-stabilizing phosphorylation [, ]. Rae1 accumulates
  due to absence of Wts-mediated downregulation ( and ) and together with the Yki-dependent
  increased cyclin E promotes S-phase entry. Rae1 promotes accumulation of cycA and
  cycB to promote proliferation (Figs  and ). (C) When Hippo signaling is lost but
  Rae1 levels are not sufficient to meet the demands of the overgrowing tissue (“OFF
  Rae1 loss”), the subsequent imbalance causes catastrophic tissue loss (). (D) We
  propose a possible model of a Rae1 feedback circuit to explain Rae1 regulation of
  Yki activity. Upstream components Mer and Ex promote activation of the core kinase
  cassette []. The core cassette then inhibits Yki and Rae1. Ex also plays a role
  to inhibit Yki by direct binding (not pictured) [–]. When active, Yki promotes transcription
  of mer and ex to promote pathway feedback. Dotted lines in this simplified, conceptual
  model represent possible interactions between the Hippo signaling components tested
  in  as candidate targets of feedback from Rae1. Our data () clearly shows a role
  for Rae1 to regulate Mer, Hpo, and Wts levels and to promote tubulin acetylation
  either or both of which may explain the Rae1 interactions with Yki (Figs  and ).
  We cannot rule out a role for Rae1 to inhibit Yki directly (dashed line).
