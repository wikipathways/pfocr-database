caption: The JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway. Signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) is activated upon binding of diverse cytokines, hormones, or growth factors
  to their cognate receptors. Ligand-bound receptors undergo conformational changes
  leading to the activation of the Janus kinases (JAK). Activated JAKs trans- and/or
  auto- phosphorylate each other and the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, enabling
  STAT3 to bind via its SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain. JAK-mediated phosphorylation
  of a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue of STAT3 induces dimerization of phosphorylated
  STAT3 and the subsequent translocation to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription.
  STAT3 induces transcription of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which
  can act as a negative regulator by interacting competitively with the receptor.
