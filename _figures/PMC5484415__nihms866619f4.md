caption: GCN2, a serine-threonine kinase with a regulatory domain that is structurally
  similar to histidine-tRNA synthetase, is allosterically activated by uncharged tRNAs

  through its contribution to amino acid pools by aminotransferases , –. To control
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, glutamine supports protein folding and trafficking
  through its contribution to uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc)
  as part of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. Glutamine is the substrate for glutamine
  fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (GFAT), which is the key rate-limiting enzyme
  in the hexosamine pathway, and the downstream product UDP-GlcNAc is a substrate
  for O-linked glycosylation through O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT).
  Thus, glutamine deprivation can lead to improper protein folding and chaperoning
  and ER stress . A key output of both the ISR and of ER stress is activating transcription
  factor 4 (ATF4), which is induced via cap-independent translation downstream of
  eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation by GCN2 or other
  kinases . α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; GLS, kidney-type glutaminase; GLS2, liver-type
