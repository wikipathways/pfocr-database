caption: PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and the respective inhibitors used in TNBC.
  The corresponding receptor activates PI3K in dimerized form (p85 and p110 subunits).
  Activated PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3, activating the Akt signaling cascade,
  which in turn phosphorylates mTOR. PTEN is the main natural inhibitor of this signaling
  pathway, acting upstream of PDK1. PI3K inhibitors are represented by pan-pi3k inhibitors
  (buparlisib, pictilisib and copanlisib) and isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors (taselisib,
  alpelisib and eganelisib). Akt inhibitors are divided between ATP-competitive inhibitors
  (capivasetib and ipavasertib) and allosteric inhibitors (MK-2206). mTOR inhibitors
  are divided between allosteric inhibitors (rapamycin, everolimus and temsirolimus)
  and ATP-competitive inhibitors (TAK-228). Finally, PI3K/mTOR inhibitor are represented
  by gedatolisib and samotolisib
