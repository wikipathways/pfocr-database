caption: Schematic diagram of postharvest abiotic stress of tomato fruit and oxidative
  stress response. Fruit exposure to postharvest abiotic stress conditions such as
  wounding, chilling temperature, CO2/O2 injury, and dehydration, provoke a significant
  increase in ethylene (C2H4) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in low concentration
  serve as signaling molecules to regulate biological and physiological processes,
  whereas in high concentration can cause important damage to molecules and cell structure.
  Fruits organize an elaborate antioxidant network system as a defense mechanism,
  with AsA playing an important role especially by the robust enhancement of the AsA-GSH
  pathway, accompanied by a slower response of AsA biosynthesis.
