caption: Cartoons of PAR-1-dependent signaling by APC and thrombin in endothelial
  cells when EPCR is either free or occupied by protein C. (Left Panel) EPCR interacts
  with caveolin-1 (Cav-1) within lipid-rafts of endothelial cells when it is not occupied
  by the Gla-domain of protein C. Thrombin cleavage of PAR-1 activates RhoA, up-regulates
  the NF-κB pathway and elicits disruptive signaling responses by signaling through
  G12/13 and/or Gq proteins. (Right Panel) The occupancy of EPCR by protein C leads
  to dissociation of EPCR from caveolin-1 and a switch in the specificity of PAR-1,
  presumably by signaling via the Gi-protein. Under these conditions, the thrombin
  cleavage of PAR-1 activates Rac1, inhibits the activation of the NF-κB pathway and
  initiates protective responses in endothelial cells. See the text for more detail.
  The figure is adopted from Ref.  with modifications.
