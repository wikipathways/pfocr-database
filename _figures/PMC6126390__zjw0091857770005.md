caption: Altered enzymes in the fatty acid synthesis pathway of M. tuberculosis (p
  < 0.05) that were shared between laboratory and clinical pair comparisons. Red squares
  represent lower levels of enzymes in the INHr strains. Alternative enzymes (Rv3720
  and FabG4) depicted with quotation marks (?) are added; see main text in the clinical
  pair comparison only to find more details. Reprinted with some adaptations from
