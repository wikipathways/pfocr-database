caption: Effects of chronic nutrient excess on pericyte metabolism and trans-differentiation.
  (A) Chronic exposure to high glucose levels of pericytes disrupts glucose metabolism
  and increases diversion of glycolytic intermediates into the polyol and hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathways, elevates NAD(P)H oxidase activity and increases cellular
  oxidative stress; This gives rise to augmented ROS levels with the exhaustion of
  antioxidant defenses, the formation of harmful AGEs, enhanced glycosylation of proteins
  and fragmentation of mitochondria. Increased fatty acid levels also exacerbate cellular
  oxidative stress, with concomitant disruptions to metabolic pathways including mitochondrial
  function. (B) These disruptions in the metabolism of pericytes increase their detachment
  from the vessel wall, lower their proliferation and increase apoptosis, ultimately
  leading to capillary regression. These pathological metabolic shifts also impact
  pericyte multipotency by promoting their trans-differentiation to myofibroblasts,
  adipocytes and chondrocytes, which contribute to interstitial fibrosis, fat accumulation
  and vessel calcification, respectively. AR, aldose reductase; AGEs, advanced glycation
