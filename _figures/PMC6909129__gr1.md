caption: Pattern Recognition ReceptorsThe anti-adenoviral immune response is triggered
  by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by PRRs. PAMPs
  are adenoviral capsid proteins or viral nucleic acids. PRR activation induces a
  signaling cascade that culminates in transcription factor (i.e., NF-κB, IRF3, IRF7)-mediated
  expression of type I interferons (IFNs), proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines.
  Prior to viral entry, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) recognizes the adenoviral capsid
  and blood coagulation factors complexed with the viral particle (in the murine system).
  After viral entry and viral uncoating within endosomes, TLR9 recognizes viral dsDNA.
  NOD-like receptors (NLRs) such as NOD2 and NALP3 recognize cytosolic dsDNA to activate
  the inflammasome. RIG-1 like receptors (RLRs) recognize cytosolic viral RNAs, including
  RNAs converted from cytosolic DNA through polymerase III, to induce type I IFNs.
  Cytosolic DNA is also recognized by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of IFN
  genes (cGAS/STING) pathway to activate the NF-κB/IRF3/IRF7 signaling pathway.
