caption: Upon cytokine binding, JAK2 molecules are recruited to cytokine receptors
  and phosphorylated, with subsequent recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT proteins.
  Phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they
  are involved in the transcription and regulation of multiple genes involved in cell
  proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The JAK2V617F mutation causes constitutive
  activation of this signaling pathway and activation of STAT5 molecules in MF, as
  well as activation of PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK signaling. JAK2 inhibitors abrogate
  the JAK/STAT pathway through inhibition of the kinase activity of JAK2V617F. Reproduced
