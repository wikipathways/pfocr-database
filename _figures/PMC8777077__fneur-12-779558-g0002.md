caption: Signaling pathways more recently proposed to TLE epileptogenesis and associated
  conditions. (A) Role of miRNA in pharmacoresistant epilepsy (). Binding of miR-153
  blocks the translation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) mRNA. Without limitation
  of miR-153, HIF-1α mRNA is translated, and HIF-1α protein transports to the nucleus,
  binding to the multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) gene as a transcriptional regulator.
  When MDR1 mRNA enters cytoplasm, it translates into P-glycoprotein, which combines
  to the cell membrane pumping antiseizure drugs (ASDs) out of the cell. Existence
  of miR-145 and miR-451 can inhibit translation of MDR1 mRNA by binding to its 3'
  untranslated region, thus decreasing expression of P-glycoprotein. (B) D-serine
  synthesis and release pathway (). Activation of presynaptic neurons induce the release
  of glutamate, which bind to AMPA receptors on neighboring astrocytes to release
  D-serine. D-serine is transformed from L-serine by serine racemase (SR). N-methyl-D-aspartate
  receptor (NMDAR)-containing GluN2A subunits are major binding sites of D-serine.
  Glycine competes with D-serine for the binding of GluN2B. (C) Reactive Oxygen Species
  (ROS) signaling in mitochondria (). Respiratory chain exists on the inner membrane
  of mitochondria and is composed of five subunits (I, II, III, IV, V). Unit IV of
  respiratory chain is also known as cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), it reduces oxygen
  into water through electron transport. Electron transport further produces ATP and
  ROS. The oxidative stress associated with ROS will change the level of NF-kB, AP1,
  and cAMP, and these factors are actively involved in gene translation and expression
  and may result in cell death. AP1, activator protein 1; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  CCO, cytochrome c oxidase; CytC, cytochrome C; H+, hydrogen ions; cAMP, cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa B; NO, nitric oxide. (D) Hypotheses for
  tau pathology on cognitive impairment and epileptogenesis in TLE (). Seizures induce
  the activation of surface receptors, involving excitatory neurotransmitter receptors,
  which further activates the mTOR pathway leading to an increase in endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress and oxidative stress. These chronic stresses will result in neuronal
  death and subsequent cognitive impairment. p70S6K, a ribosomal protein kinase downstream
  of activated mTOR, stimulates the synthesis of tau and BACE1 proteins directly phosphorylates
  tau (circled P). Cellular stress also induce activation of pro-apoptotic JNK, and
  inhibiting PP2A activity. PP2A is a major tau phosphatase and can decrease tau phosphorylation
  upon activation. Figures were modified with permission.
