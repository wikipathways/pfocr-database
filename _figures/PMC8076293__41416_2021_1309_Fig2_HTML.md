caption: Many mechanisms underlying inflammatory signalling, regeneration and unchecked
  proliferation can function in cancer progression, including during dissemination
  from the primary tumour, establishment of a micro-metastases, and finally overt
  macro-metastatic outgrowth. Chromosomal instability leads to the formation of rupture-prone
  micronuclei - a source of chronic inflammatory signalling in tumour cells themselves.
  At the invasive front of a primary tumour (a), chronic inflammatory signalling driven
  by sensing of cytosolic nucleic acids can trigger epithelial–mesenchymal transition
  (insert) and a more regenerative stem-like phenotype. Breakdown of the extracellular
  matrix (ECM) allows mesenchymal stem-like cells to escape the tumour microenvironment
  and seed micro-metastases (b). The innate immune system, especially natural killer
  (NK) cells, can restrict the expansion of latent, metastasis-initiating cells that
  have not yet adapted to evade the deleterious, immune-mediated consequences of chronic
  inflammatory signalling. Cells that enter an immune-evasive, quiescent state might
  eventually form overt macro-metastases under growth-permissive conditions (c), which
  can lead to re-engagement with pro-regenerative immune cells in the new tumour microenvironment.
