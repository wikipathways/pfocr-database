caption: Molecular alterations in signaling pathways associated with neurodegeneration
  in fibroblasts derived from patients with FAD-PS1. The results of gene expression
  of brain samples from patients with ADF allowed for the identification of changes
  at the level of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, as well as of kinases associated
  with hyperphosphorylation of the protein tau and its pathological phosphorylation.
  From the proteomic results, it was identified that fibroblasts with PS1 mutations
  present increased levels of cellular stress proteins, which could represent a compensation
  event through chaperone-mediated autophagy and also regulate the aggregation of
  the Aβ peptide and tau.
