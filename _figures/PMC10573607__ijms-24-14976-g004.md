caption: (A) Soluble sugar, cellulose, and lignin contents. Blue bars (right Y-axis)
  indicate soluble sugar content, while red/green lines (left Y-axis) indicate cellulose/lignin
  contents. (B) Identification of major players within cellulose and xylan biosynthetic
  pathways for secondary wall. Metabolites in each step of the biosynthetic pathway
  are shown in the box, and all related genes are shown to the side. Color gradient
  according to the expression levels (FPKM) was visualized. (C) Identification of
  major players within monolignol biosynthetic pathways for secondary wall.
