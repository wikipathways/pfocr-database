caption: 'A schematic pathway for rosiglitazone induced HO‐1 expression in HPAEpiCs.
  Rosiglitazone attenuated LPS‐induced ICAM‐1 expression and lung monocyte/leukocyte
  accumulation by up‐regulating HO‐1 expression via two manners: PPARγ dependence
  and PPARγ independence. Activated PPARγ directly bound to PPARγ responsive element
  of HO‐1 promoter, which increased the expression of HO‐1 gene. In the PPARγ independent
  pathway, rosiglitazone enhanced NADPH oxidase activity, which resulted in the accumulation
  of intracellular ROS. Imbalance of oxidative stress promoted the phosphorylation
  of c‐Src/Pyk2/Akt and the activation of Nrf2. After nuclear translocation, Nrf2
  binds to the ARE region of HO‐1 promoter and increases the expression of the HO‐1
  gene.'
