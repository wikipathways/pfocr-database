caption: 'Innate recognition of RSV and its immune evasion mechanisms. RSV is recognized
  by TLRs including TLR2/6, TLR4, TLR3, and TLR7; RLRs including RIG-I and MDA5; NLRs
  including NOD2 and NLRP3. NS1/2 mainly mediates the innate immune evasion mechanisms
  caused by RSV converged in interfering with the RLRs signaling pathway by direct
  binding to RIG-I, MDA5, adaptor proteins MAVS, and TRIM25. Besides, NS1/2 also induces
  the decrease of TRAF3, IKKε, and blocks the phosphorylation of IRF3 and its association
  to transcriptional coactivator CBP. Moreover, NS1/2 also prevents the JAK/STAT signaling
  by promoting the degradation of STAT2 and OASL and inhibits the IFNAR synthesis
  via inducing the expression of miR-29a. Besides, NS1 can also induce the expression
  of SOCS1 in a RIG-I and TLR3-independent pathway, which further inhibits the phosphorylation
  of STAT2. The N protein binds to MDA5 and MAVS to inhibit their activation. The
  bovine RSV (bRSV) N protein can also cooperate with P protein to promote the formation
  of IBs-like structures to capture the p65 subunit of NF-κB, which further prevents
  its translocation to the nucleus. On the one hand, the soluble G protein blocks
  the TLR3/4-mediated IFN-β production. On the other hand, it also impedes the ISG15
  expression. The G protein and F protein induce both SOCS1 and SOCS3, which subsequently
  interferes with the JAK–STAT pathway to block the IFN-I response. Abbreviation:
  RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; TLRs, toll-like receptors; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible
  gene I; MDA5, melanoma differentiation associated gene 5; NOD2, nucleotide-binding
