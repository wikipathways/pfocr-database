caption: The Mechanism Diagram of the Article (by Figdraw). The schematic model illustrated
  the underlying mechanism by which SA induced the apoptosis of PSCs, inhibited the
  activation of PSCs and panreatic fibrosis. The figure visually showed the key molecular
  events and pathways involved in SA-induced apoptosis
