caption: Schematic of gut microbiota–bile acid interactions in humans. The primary
  bile acids CA and CDCA are conjugated with taurine and glycine within the liver,
  and secreted through the biliary system into the small intestine. Once entering
  the distal gut, the enzyme BSH (found distributed widely amongst gut microbiome
  members) removes these taurine and glycine conjugates, reforming unconjugated CA
  and CDCA. Following on from this, the complex, multi-step process of 7-α-dehydroxylation
  also occurs through microbially derived enzymes, and converts primary to secondary
  bile acids (specifically, CA is converted to DCA, and CDCA is converted to LCA).
  A range of other microbially derived enzymes are also able to perform biotransformations
  upon primary bile acids, for example, 7 α/β-epimerisation to form ursodeoxycholic
  acid. TCA is the major endogenous trigger to Clostridioides difficile germination
  (with glycine as co-germinant); CA and DCA (at high concentrations) also trigger
  C. difficile germination. However, DCA and LCA at physiological concentrations inhibit
  TCA-mediated C. difficile germination,; these and other secondary bile acids also
  inhibit the vegetative growth and toxin activity of C. difficile.– CDCA also inhibits
  the germination of C. difficile. The altered bile acid milieu found in the CDI gut
  is also associated with reduced signalling via the FXR-FGF-19 pathway, which may
  exacerbate CDI via a number of routes (see main text). Green arrows, microbially
  mediated biotransformations; red dotted arrows, impacts of bile acids upon the life
  cycle of C. difficile; purple dotted arrows, impacts of bile acids upon the FXR
  pathway. Adapted from Mullish et al.BSH, bile salt hydrolase; CA, cholate, CDCA,
  chenodeoxycholate, DCA, deoxycholic acid; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FXR, farnesoid
  X receptor; LCA, lithocholic acid; TCA, taurocholate.
