caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed molecular mechanisms. A schematic diagram
  depicting the molecular mechanism by which Maf1 inhibits blood–brain barrier disruption
  by competing with p65 to regulate NLRP3 expression. Maf1 protects the blood–brain
  barrier by directly targeting NLRP3 to decrease apoptosis, the secretion of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, blood–brain barrier permeability, and nerve injury.
