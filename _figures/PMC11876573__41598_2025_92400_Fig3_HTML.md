caption: Association network of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the tumor
  necrosis factor signaling pathway in the organ of Corti in wild-type mice following
  acoustic overexposure (AO). The network of DEGs in the TNF pathway in wild-type
  mice following AO as compared to wild-type mice before AO. Jun and IL1B are recognized
  as key regulators in the protein-protein interaction network of the TNF signaling
  pathway following AO. The STRING database (https://string-db.org) computed the graphical
  analysis of mutual relationships of the DEGs as evidenced by experimentally verified
  interactions, co-expressions, and co-citations in curated databases and PubMed abstracts.
