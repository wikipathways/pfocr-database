caption: Proposed mechanism of LPS affecting the pathogenensis of AD. AD-related GM
  dysbiosis contributes to an increased level of plasma LPS, which promotes blood
  monocyte/macrophage activation and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines mainly
  through NF-κB pathway. LPS can also cross the BBB, promote neuroinflammation and
  colocalize with Aβ1-40/42 in amyloid plaques and around vessels in the brain, possibly
  affecting Aβ pathology and endothelial function.
