caption: (1), Upon growth factor binding to a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), insulin
  receptor substrate (IRS1) is activated. This stimulates the PI3K and RAS signaling
  pathways. (2), Activation of PI3K and RAS results in phosphorylation and increased
  activity of the effector kinases, AKT and ERK1/2. (3), Activated AKT and ERK directly
  phosphorylate and inactivate the tuberous sclerosis (TSC) 1 /TSC2 complex and thus
  activate mTORC1. (4), When the TSC1/ TSC2 complex is active, it negatively regulates
  mTORC1 by converting RAS homolog enriched in brain (RHEB) from its active GTP-bound
  state to its inactive GDP-bound state. (5), Similar to AKT, the adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) can directly block the activity of TORC1 by phosphorylation
  of Raptor, a TORC1 inhibitor, leading to allosteric inhibition of TORC1. (6), The
  activated RTK can also directly activate TORC2 which phosphorylates AKT at Ser473
  leading to inactivation of the TSC1/TSC2 complex and activation of TORC1. (7), Activated
  AKT also signals TORC1 by phosphorylating and inactivating PRAS40. Inactivating
  phosphorylation causes PRAS40 to disassociate from Raptor which releases inhibition
  on TORC1. (8), Activation of TORC1 leads to phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6K1 which
  in turn promote protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, cellular growth, proliferation
  and survival. (9), When activated by TORC1, S6K1 directly phosphorylates IRS1 leading
  to degradation of IRS and dampening of growth factor signaling. (10), In addition,
  growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (GRB10) another substrate activated by TORC1
  activity reduces the expression of the growth factor receptors (RTKs). (11), Treatment
  with BEZ235 inhibits the activity of PI3K, TORC1, and TORC2 resulting in depletion
  of p-AKT, p-4EBP1, p-p70S6K and cap-dependent translation with concomitant induction
  of BIM, p27 and p21. This leads to cell cycle growth inhibition and decreased cell
  proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. PS treatment modestly inhibits TORC1 activity
  leading to depletion of p-4EBP1 and p-p70S6K. PS treatment also inhibits p-AKT leading
  to nuclear localization of FOXO3A, which induces expression of p21, p27, and BIM.
  Combined treatment with BEZ235 and PS causes greater induction of BIM and increased
  cell death of pancreatic cancer cells.
