caption: Putative Zika virus entry pathway and the secretory autophagy/exosome pathway
  in the trophoblast cell. 3-methyladenine and wortmannin inhibit both autophagosome
  formation and endosomal carrier vesicle formation (Nour et al., ). In the absence
  of these vesicles, Zika virus may either fail to fuse completely with the early
  endosome membrane or it may fuse with as yet unidentified endosomal compartments
  in which the nucleocapsid remains trapped (Nour et al., ). Chloroquine and its derivative
  hydroxychloroquine are lysosomal lumen alkalizers, which inhibit degradative autophagy
  by neutralizing the acidic pH in the lumen of lysosomal vesicles (Vakifahmetoglu-Norberg
  et al., ). Metformin (Fedson, ) and Carbamazepine (Schiebler et al., ) induce autophagic
  killing of pathogenic microbes (degradative autophagy). mTORC inhibitors Torin 1
  and rapamycin stimulate autophagy, but inhibit exosome release evidently (Fader
  et al., ), therefore limiting Zika virus transfer through the placental barrier.
  However, Torin 1 and rapamycin may enhance virus replication (Hamel et al., ). Alternatively,
  exosome-specific inhibitors nSMase2, GW4869 and spiroepoxide (Li et al., ) may prevent
  the transfer, although their drug safeties need further studies.
