caption: Modulation of oxidative stress is a central process in the development of
  obesity-induced insulin resistance. Increasing fat accumulation (Obesity) can generate
  oxidative stress in multiple ways, including increased mitochondria-derived ROS,
  increased activity of NADPH oxidases, decreased antioxidant expression, and promotion
  of a pro-inflammatory environment. By activating stress responsive pathways like
  JNK, increasing cytokine expression, or perhaps through direct oxidative damage
  of signaling proteins, this oxidative stress can lead to decreased insulin response
  of the insulin signaling pathway (right). These data suggest that reduction of oxidative
  stress may be a viable therapeutic or preventative treatment for insulin resistance.
