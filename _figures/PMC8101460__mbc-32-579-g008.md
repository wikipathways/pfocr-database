caption: RhoA signaling can govern lamellipodia formation by acting both upstream
  of and downstream from Rac1. The switch between lamellipodia-dependent and -independent
  protrusions is governed by at least two cross-talk pathways connecting RhoA activation
  to the inhibition of Rac1 signaling. RhoA activity can act upstream of Rac1 to prevent
  the activation of Rac1 and the formation of lamellipodia. This inhibitory cross-talk
  may activate or inhibit a Rac1 GAP or GEF, respectively, as demonstrated for the
  RhoA-Rac1 cross-talk governing the amoeboid–mesenchymal transition (). The second
  pathway prevents Rac1-mediated lamellipodia formation through reciprocal cross-talk
  between Arp2/3 and NMII. Both pathways lead to the generation of intracellular hydraulic
  pressure and the formation of lamellipodia-independent protrusions downstream from
  RhoA activity.

    The second pathway prevents Rac1-mediated lamellipodia formation through reciprocal
