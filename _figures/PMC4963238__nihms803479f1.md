caption: Cellular metabolic pathways include synthesis of lipids, glycogen and nucleotides,
  glycolysis (the breakdown of carbohydrates and sugars to produce ATP and pyruvic
  acid) and the hexokinase pathway, which gives rise to substrates for the synthesis
  of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (the Krebs
  cycle) is the sequence of reactions by which most living cells generate energy during
  the process of aerobic respiration. Glutaminolysis occurs partly in the mitochondrion
  and partly in the cytosol, and is an important energy source in tumour cells. CoA,
  coenzyme A; CTP, citrate transport protein; MPC, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier;
  PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; UDP, uridine diphosphate.
