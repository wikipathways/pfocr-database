caption: (a) Schematic redox cycle for the standard and the fast SCR reaction. Mx
  (blue) denotes the oxidized catalytic metal center, whereas Mx–1 (red) refers to
  a reduced form of the catalytic metal center. (b) Possible simplified reaction mechanisms
  for the SCR reduction half-cycle on the NH3-first pathway (left) and the NO-first
  pathway (right).
