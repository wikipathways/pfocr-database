caption: Innate immune evasion mechanisms of HSV. Several countermeasures against
  the host IFN and proinflammatory response have been established by HSV. For instance,
  the IRF3 pathway is inhibited by ICP0, ICP27, and ICP34.5, through distinct mechanisms.
  Also, the HSV L gene products ICP34.5 and Us11 inhibit PKR activation, with Us11
  exerting its action by direct binding to dsRNA, for which reason Us11 potentially
  also blocks activation of TLR3 and RLRs. The 2′–5′-OAS/RNAse L system is inhibited
  by 2′–5′ A analogs. JAK/STAT signalling and the production of IFN-α/β is counteracted
  by a mechanism involving ICP27.
