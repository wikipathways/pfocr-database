caption: Mechanistic figure of JAK-STAT and DAMPs pathways involving IFP35. In the
  JAK-STAT pathway, the link between type I IFN molecule (IFN-I) and its receptor
  (IFNAR-1/IFNAR-2) induces the ligand-dependent dimerization of intracellular subunits,
  rapidly activating, in turn, the associated Janus kinase (JAK) by auto phosphorylation.
  Then, the activated dimer of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
  undergoes nuclear translocation, resulting in different interferon stimulated genes
  (ISGs) transcription, such as 35-kDa interferon-induced protein (IFP35). In the
  DAMPs pathway, the extracellular IFP35 serves as a damage associate molecular pattern
  (DAMP) molecule, recognized by Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4). The latter utilizes
  both molecular adaptors MyD88 and TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing
  interferon beta (TRIF) to activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) or interferon
  regulatory factor (IRF), respectively. While the IRF activation upregulates IFN
  genes resulting in the antiviral state, the MyD88 activation leads to an interaction
  between NF-kB and IkB kinases (IKK complex). Then, the activated NF-kB is translocated
  into the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor of various pro-inflammatory
  cytokine genes. This results in a pro-inflammatory response based first on the innate
  immune activation, and then on the adaptive one. The immune response elicitation
  finally increases the inflammatory demyelination and axonal loss in the central
  nervous system (CNS) and tissue damage in the other organ-specific chronic inflammatory
  diseases.
