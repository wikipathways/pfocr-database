caption: Schematic summary of the role of targeting Dnmt3a mediated ID2 promoter in
  MMT. In a PD microenvironment, PMCs undergo phenotypic changes, including mesenchymal
  characteristics and the transition to a fibroblast-like morphology. Meanwhile, MMT
  process through DNA methylation was associated with the methylation of ID2 promoter.
  ID2 resulted in recruitment of the Dnmt3a to regulate ID2 expression, which is correlated
  with PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Astragalus ameliorated PF by targeting Dnmt3a mediated
  ID2 promoter via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The figure was draw by software PowerPoint
  for Mac, version number is 16.16.27
