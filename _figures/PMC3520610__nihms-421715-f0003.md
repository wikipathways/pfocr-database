caption: Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) has biphasic actions during tumorig enesis,
  suppressing tumorigenesis at early stages but promoting tumour progression later
  on, which is the underlying paradigm for the action of TGFβ during disease progression
  in general and thus complicates the development of therapies targeting TGFβ signalling.
  The light grey arrows indicate a positive feedforward loop resulting in higher levels
  of TGFβ, which is a feature of non-neoplastic as well as neoplastic diseases. The
  current goal in cancer therapy is to downmodulate excessive levels of TGFβ ligands
  and to target the tumour-progressing versus the tumour-suppressing arm of TGFβ action;
  the latter goal will almost certainly require more-specific second-generation drugs.
