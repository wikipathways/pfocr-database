caption: Schematic representation of light inputs into the brain clock of Drosophila
  larvae. For simplicity, the left hemisphere displays pathways active when only CRY
  is activated (visual system-ablated or rh52;rh61 mutant larvae), whereas the right
  hemisphere displays pathways active when only the visual system is activated (cry
  mutants). Each of the four neuronal groups has its own unique combination of light
  inputs, as indicated by different colors (). The CRY+ neurons are in blue (dark
  blue for PDF+ LNs; light blue for DN1s). In the absence of CRY, the DN1s require
  PDF signaling from the LNs to see light (arrow on right hemisphere). Thus, they
  have no direct connection to the visual system. The DN2s (gray) require PDF for
  entrainment both via the visual system and via CRY (arrow on both sides of the brain).
  The CRY− fifth LN (orange) can see light both via a direct connection to the visual
  system (like the other four LNs) and via a PDF-independent pathway, which enables
  entrainment even in the absence of the visual system. This pathway must originate
  from other CRY+ cells, since CRY and the visual system are the only light inputs
  to the brain clock. The question marks thus indicate the possible involvement of
  a direct connection between the corresponding clock neurons.
