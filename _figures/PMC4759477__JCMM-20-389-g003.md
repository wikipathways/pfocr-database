caption: A schematic representation of platycodin D‐induced G2/M phase cell cycle
  arrest in cancer cells. Platycodin D inhibits G2‐M phase transition by increasing
  the expression of transcription factor FOXO3a, p53, p21 and Weel, and decreasing
  the expression of MDM2 and induces M phase arrest by sustainable tubulin polymerization.
  Binding of ligand such as growth factor (EGF) to the growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  promotes the activation of downstream pro‐survival signalling pathways such as PI3K/AKT
  and MAPK/ERK pathways. Activated AKT and ERK translocate to the nucleus and inhibit
  the transcription of apoptosis promoting (Bim, FasL, TRAIL) and cell cycle regulatory
  genes (p21, p27) by phosphorylating FOXO3a and exporting it out of nucleus. ERK
  regulates the expression of MDM2 that ubiquitinates FOXO3a in response to ERK pathway
  activation leading to proteasomal degradation. Platycodin D induces G2/M phase arrest
  and apoptosis by increasing the expression of FOXO3a in nucleus by inhibiting AKT
  and ERK.
