caption: Butyl acetate production pathway from glucose. Blue arrows represent the
  overexpressed genes for butyl acetate production. The butyl acetate synthesis pathway
  is separated into A, B glycolysis, C formate dehydrogenase reaction, D butanol synthesis
  and E alcohol acetyltransferase reaction. The black box shows the stoichiometry
  of each pathway as well as the overall scenario of either fdh expressed or not.
  ATP equivalents are not shown in this figure
