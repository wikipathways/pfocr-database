caption: Pathway crosstalk regulates YAP and TAZ YAP/TAZ signaling is mainly regulated
  by the Hippo signaling pathway. Activation of the Hippo pathway is associated with
  phosphorylation of the core Hippo kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2, and their cofactors
  SAV1 and MOB. Phosphorylated YAP/TAZ are exported from the nucleus and degraded
  in the cytoplasm. When these kinases are inactive, YAP/TAZ accumulate in the nucleus,
  bind to transcription factors, and promote the expression of target genes. Additional
  regulators that compose the Hippo pathway have been identified. Moreover, YAP/TAZ signaling
  is related to mechanotransduction pathways and is regulated by mechanical forces
  through the actin cytoskeleton
