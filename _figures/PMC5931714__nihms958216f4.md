caption: (A) ChIP-seq profile of SPCH binding at the PIF4 locus. Data are derived
  from [].(B) Expression changes of the indicated genes upon dexamethasone (DEX) induction
  (12 hr) of GR-SPCH1-4A in leaf epidermis derived from RNA-seq analysis.(C) Model
  of the regulatory interplay between SPCH and PIF4 in the high-temperature regulation
  of stomatal development. At high temperature, PIF4 is induced and accumulates in
  the stomatal precursors, where it binds and represses SPCH to inhibit activity of
  the stomatal lineage. In the few cells where SPCH accumulates, it negatively feeds
  back on PIF4 through direct binding of PIF4’s promoter, enabling SPCH to accumulate
  sufficiently to ensure stomatal cell fate. Other environmental signals, such as
  osmotic stress, influence SPCH at the protein level through the MAPK pathway (not
  shown).See also .
