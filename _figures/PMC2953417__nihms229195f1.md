caption: Schematic overview of the NO synthesis pathway, involving both enzymatic
  (via NOS; major pathway) and non-enzymatic pathways. L-arginine is converted to
  NO and citrulline in the presence of NADPH and oxygen. The NOS pathways depend on
  essential cofactors (BH4, FAD, FMN and heme) for their activity; NOS1 and NO3 are
  also Ca2+ dependent. De novo arginine production from citrulline involves the enzymes
  ASS and ASL. Potential factors that can be modified by dietary intake are indicated
  by a gray background.
