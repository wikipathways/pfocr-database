caption: The D-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase HdhA from L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus
  catalyzes the conversion of endogenous 4-HPP 1 to 4-HPL 2, which is subsequently
  meta-hydroxylated by hydroxylase complex HpaBC cloned from E. coli to yield 3,4-DHPL
  3, the intended acceptor substrate for rosmarinic acid synthase (RAS). Donor substrate
  biosynthesis is achieved through the conversion of L-tyrosine 4 to p-coumaric acid
  by a tyrosine ammonia lyase from R. sphaeroides (RsTAL) and hydroxylation of p-coumaric
  acid 5 to caffeic acid 6 by HpaBC. A 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase from Arabidopsis thaliana
  (At4CL2) generates the CoA-ester of the donor substrate, allowing ester formation
  catalyzed by RAS. Both 3,4-DHPL 3 and 4-HPL 2 may be accepted by RAS to form both
  RA 7 and IA 8, respectively.
