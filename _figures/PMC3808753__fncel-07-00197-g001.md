caption: The coordinated action of glial and neuronal purinergic receptors and purines
  in the CNS. Pre-synaptic terminals exocytotically release both glutamate (GLUT)
  and ATP as co-transmitters. Extracellular ATP is broken down by ectonucleotidases
  to ADP and adenosine (ADO), with ATP and ADP acting post-synaptically on P2X and
  P2Y receptors subtypes, while glutamate acts post-synaptically on α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole
  propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and/or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs).
  Conversely, the ATP released and its breakdown products, ADP and adenosine (ADO),
  also act pre-synaptically to modulate neurotransmitter release through the activation
  of P2X, P2Y, and P1 (A3) receptors. Resting microglia express the P2X4 and P2X7
  receptors that are involved in neuropathic pain. ATP promotes IL-1β release through
  P2X7 receptors and it leads to the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF) through the activation of P2X4 receptors that acts on TrkB receptors expressed
  by neurons in the pain pathway. P2X7 and P2Y1 receptors mediate the migration of
  resting microglia after injury, whereas the P2Y6 receptors expressed on the activated
  microglia mediate phagocytosis at the site of damage. ATP is also released from
  astrocytes, together with glutamate and GABA, modulating neuronal activity. Leukaemia
  inhibiting factor (LIF) is released by astrocytes in response to ATP and it promotes
  myelination by oligodendrocytes through P2Y1 receptors. The P2X7 receptors on oligodendrocytes
  mediate apoptosis while ADO protects them through the P1 receptor (adapted from).
