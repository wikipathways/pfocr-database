caption: 'SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell through ACE2 found in the membrane of type II
  pneumocytes. The immune response is initiated through the activation of PRRS (TLR,
  NLR, RIG-1) located in the membrane and cytosol interacting with the viral RNA.
  The stimulation of these receptors leads to the activation of transcription regulating
  factors such as IRF 3/7 and NF-kB, which leads to the production of interferons
  type I/III and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Theophylline modulation of HDAC2
  inhibits NF-kB and inflammatory genes. DNA damage produced by ROS production activates
  PARP1, which leads to NAD+ depletion, decreasing SIRT1 activity. Theophylline inhibits
  PARP1, decreases ROS production, and enhances SIRT1 expression and activity. mTOR
  inhibition by theophylline contributes to attenuating the inflammatory response.
  The production of these cytokines initiates the recruitment of neutrophils and recruitment
  and differentiation of monocytes into alveolar macrophages. The cytokine storm microenvironment
  produced as a result of the viral infection stimulates the activation and differentiation
  of cytotoxic CD8+ and helper CD4+ T cells necessary for viral clearance, initiating
  the production of cytokines, recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils, promoting
  the immune response. The proposed antiviral effects of theophylline are highlighted.
  In order to successfully limit the viral infection in later phases of the disease
  and to prevent future reinfections, the participation of the humoral response and
  production of antibodies is needed. Abbreviations: T—theophylline; PRRs—pattern
  recognition receptors; TLR—Toll-like receptors; RIG-1—gene-I proteins inducible
