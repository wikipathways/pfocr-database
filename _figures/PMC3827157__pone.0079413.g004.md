caption: 'The entire 117 unique gene list was uploaded into the Genomatix Pathway
  System (GePS 2.4.0). Only the 20 genes linked to PPARγ by a PPRE are represented.
  The function of each gene is that proposed by GePS software for receptors and co-factors,
  etc. (for further details see the Genomatix web site; http://www.genomatix.de).
  The pale salmon color represents genes expressed in human placenta (Unigene): 2
  genes (UPK1A and GADD45A) are not mentioned as being expressed in human placenta
  on this web site, but GADD45A expression has recently been described in this tissue
