caption: 'A, The Norrin-FZD4 signaling pathway. In the active form, the binding of
  Norrin (NDP) to FZD4, as part of the receptor complex with low-density lipoprotein
  receptor–related protein 5 (LRP5) and tetraspanin 12 (TSPAN12), results in the release
  of β-catenin and its translocation into the nucleus to induce T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid-enhancing
  factor (LEF)–mediated gene expression. In the absence of Norrin, β-catenin is phosphorylated
  (P) of by the axin-glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)–adenomatous polyposis coli
  (APC) destruction complex resulting in β-catenin–P degradation. B, The change in
  the FZD4 protein for each FZD4 allele presented in this study. FZD4 p.Met105Val
  is located within the frizzled (FZ) cysteine-rich domain, a critical binding domain
  in the interaction with NDP. p.Cys450X results in the loss of the last 87 amino
  acids, including the entire intracellular tail, that contains a critical KTxxxW
  disheveled (DVL) binding motif. The control used in this study, p.Met493_Trp494del,
  results in the loss of 2 residues flush with the intracellular membrane surface.
  The PDZ-domain binds the intracellular proteins to mediate intracellular signaling
  (PDZ combines the first letters of the first 3 proteins discovered to share the
  domain: postsynaptic density protein, Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor, and
  zonula occludens 1 protein).'
