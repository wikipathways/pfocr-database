caption: Model illustrating the relative positioning of aPKC within the NGF signaling
  cascades for survival and differentiation. aPKC can activate MEK and lies upstream
  of JNK. Both Ras and Src lie upstream of aPKC, as does PI3K, whereas aPKC lies upstream
  of NF-κB, directly interacting with IKK. Differentiation requires components of
  both the Src and Ras pathways. The differentiation pathway overlaps with components
  of the survival pathway through Src, aPKC, and PI3K. Survival signaling is Ras independent
  but dependent on PI3K, Src, aPKC, and NF-κB. Our findings support a model whereby
  aPKC occupies a critical node, capable of interacting with Ras-MAPK through modulation
  of MEK and JNK and upstream of NF-κB. NGFR, NGF receptor.
