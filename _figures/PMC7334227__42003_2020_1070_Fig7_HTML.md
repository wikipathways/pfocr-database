caption: Briefly, CSPM@CpG got through the vessel and arrived at tumor microenvironment.
  Then CpG are specifically identified by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in plasmacytoid
  dendritic cells and thus stimulate an immune response to produce helper T cell 1
  (Th1) and a pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and IL-12. IL-12 could promote maturity
  of CTLs and infiltration in tumor site. At the same time, activated CTLs could secrete
  IFN-γ to kill tumor cells. However, tumor cells could induce CTLs exhaustion through
  PD-L1 signaling pathway for immune evasion, which could be effectively blockaded
  by aPD-L1 in turn. So PD-L1 antibody could bind with PD-L1 and remove immunosuppression
  to enhance immunotherapy. At the same time, the nanocomposite with efficient anti-tumor
  efficiency could effectively release lots of heat and ROS under 650 nm laser and
  808 nm laser irradiation, causing apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells.
