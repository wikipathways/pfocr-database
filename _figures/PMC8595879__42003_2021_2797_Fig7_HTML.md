caption: a IL-1β/TNFα stimulation (black arrows) leads to the entry of NF-κB p65/p50
  complex into the cell nucleus and the activation of cytokine expression. The activation
  is controlled by regulatory proteins 14-3-3 and IκB-α (red arrows), resulting in
  the nuclear export of 14-3-3/p65/p50-IκBα complex, , . 14-3-3 remains in equilibrium
  between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. b NiV W protein is imported into the nucleus
  of the infected cell, mediated by its NLS within its CTD. Via its CTD-S449, the
  W protein binds to 14-3-3, resulting in an increased influx of 14-3-3 into the nucleus
  (thicker blue arrow). When the W protein is artificially debilitated by either NLS
  mutation or S449A substitution, it loses, respectively, its ability to enter into
  the nucleus, or to interact with nuclear 14-3-3 and, consequently, to inhibit NF-κB
  activity (not illustrated). Accumulated nuclear 14-3-3 enhances the export of the
  p65/p50/IκB-α complex from the nucleus (thicker red arrow). The increased translocation
  rate of NF-κB p65/p50 out of the nucleus prevents its efficient binding onto the
  promoters of proinflammatory cytokines and results in the inhibition of the host
  inflammatory response. Only details of the intranuclear part of the NF-κB pathway,
  which are critical for the comprehension of the action of the W protein revealed
  in this study, are presented in the figure. Of note, as the molecular mechanism
  used by 14-3-3 molecules to enter the nucleus (passively or actively) is still unknown,
  the 14-3-3 nuclear entry trafficking is not indicated by the classical double inverted
  arrows used to mean (dis)equilibrium. Additional details are described in the Discussion.
