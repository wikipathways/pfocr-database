caption: Illustration of the Slt2-MAPK signaling pathway in A. flavus. Signals are
  initiated at the plasma membrane (PM) through the cell-surface sensors Wscs, Mid2,
  and Mtl1. The extracellular domains of these proteins are highly O-mannosylated.
  Together with PI4, 5P2, which recruits the Rom1/Rom2 guanine nucleotide exchange
  factors (GEFs) to the plasma membrane, the sensors stimulate nucleotide exchange
  on Rho1. Two transcription factors, Rlm1 and SBF (Swi4/Swi6), are activated by the
  pathway. Skn7 may also contribute to the cell wall integrity transcriptional program.
