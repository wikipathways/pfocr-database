caption: 'Effects of GCXX on metabolism of gut microbiota. (A) The volcano plot of
  mice between NC group and UC group; (B) The volcano plot of mice between GCXX group
  and UC group; (C) The abundance of glycine-tyrosine in each group; (D) The abundance
  of phenylalanine-threonine in each group; (E) The abundance of glutamic acid-phenylalanine
  in each group; (F) The abundance of linoleic acid in each group; (G) The bubble
  chart of differential metabolic pathways regulated by GCXX; (H) The pathway of linoleic
  acid metabolism. Red and green respectively indicate up-regulation and down-regulation
  of metabolites. Compared with the NC group, ***P<0.001; compared with the UC group,
  ###P<0.001.'
