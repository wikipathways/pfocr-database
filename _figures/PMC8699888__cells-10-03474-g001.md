caption: The molecular pathway of cellular senescence. The infinite cell division
  and stressful stimuli can finally induce a replicative senescence and stress-induced
  senescence, respectively. Both of those two factors activate the transcription of
  p53 through a DNA damage response (DDR) which subsequently stimulates that of p21.
  On the other hand, telomere shortening and stress can also initiate the transcription
  of p16. Both activation of p16 and p21 then induces the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
  (Rb) protein which induces an increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 2
  (CDK2) or CDK4/6 resulting in cell cycle arrest of the G1/S phase. Adrenocortical
  steroids, such as aldosterone, cortisol and adrenal androgen, were recently reported
  to induce cellular senescence. Cortisol can bind to glucocorticoid receptors (GR)
  leading to an increase in p53 transcription under the involvement of glucocorticoid
  response elements (GRE) []. GR can also mediate p21 transcription in a p53-inpendent
  manner though GRE or a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) [,]. However, the
  mechanisms of aldosterone and adrenal androgen in the development of cellular senescence
  has remained unknown.
