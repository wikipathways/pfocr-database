caption: 'Interplay between the TNFR1 and TNFR2 downstream signaling pathways. TNFR1
  can bind to tm-TNF-α, as well as its soluble form after cleavage by the metalloproteinase
  TACE/ADAM17. TNFR2 binds to tm-TNF-α with higher affinity. Binding of Tm-TNF-α to
  TNFRs induces a positive retro-control loop on its transcription. TNFR1 activation
  can lead to apoptosis and necroptosis through interaction between its death domains
  and the TRADD adaptor. Both TNFR1 and TNFR2 can recruit cIAP1/2, leading to the
  activation of classical NF-κB. TRAF2 weakly binds to TNFR2, leading to activation
  of the alternative NF-κB pathway. The amount of cIAP1/2 and TRAF2 in the cytosol
  is crucial in cells that simultaneously express TNFR1 and TNFR2, as the consumption
  of these molecular actors after TNFR2 activation leads to the preferential activation
  of death pathways under TNFR1 rather than those of proliferation and survival. Red
  arrows indicate inhibition. Green arrows indicate activation. P: phosphorylation.'
