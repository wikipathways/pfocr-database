caption: In response to telomere erosion, Rap1 is released from telomeres, and G‐rich
  TERRA transcription is induced. G‐rich TERRA molecules exert an inhibitory effect
  on telomerase by competing with telomeres for telomerase binding. Moravec et al
  show that G‐rich TERRA molecules are cleaved and polyadenylated, presumably by CPF‐CF,
  thereby generating polyadenylated TERRA molecules containing few or no telomeric
  sequences. In this scenario, the G‐rich TERRA would be degraded by the 5′–3′ exoribonuclease
  Dhp1/Rat1/Xrn2. The polyadenylated TERRA generated by the termination pathway interacts
  with the catalytic subunit of telomerase and promotes the nucleation of telomerase
  at the transcribed telomere. As a result, the short telomere is specifically elongated.
  In this model, we expect mutations affecting the exoribonuclease activity to inhibit
  telomerase activity.
