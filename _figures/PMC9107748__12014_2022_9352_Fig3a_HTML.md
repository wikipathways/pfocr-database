caption: Pathway analysis of hormone-regulated genes identified by RNA sequencing
  of BT474 cells. Enrichment map of the DHT- (A) and PROG- (B) regulated genes. The
  analysis was performed using the Cytoscape software (GSEA 3.0, Enrichment Map plugin,
  q-value < 0.1). Blue color nodes represent downregulated gene sets, whereas red
  color nodes show the upregulated gene sets. The node size corresponds to the number
  of genes included within each gene set. For details see under Section “methods”
