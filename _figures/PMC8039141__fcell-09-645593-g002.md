caption: Schematic of the different mechanisms involved in Senescence Associated Secretory
  Phenotype (SASP) regulation. This figure shows the different pathways involved in
  regulating SASP. Most of the pathways converge to activate the transcription factors
  NF-κB and c/EBPβ in senescent cells. The autocrine feed forward signaling of different
  pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1A, IL-6, and IL-8 is illustrated. ZCAN4 promotes
  the expression of inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB. TAK1 activates p38/MAPK, a kinase
  that subsequently engages PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. mTOR is capable of activating the
  NF-κB signaling directly as well as indirectly via IL-1A. GATA-4 links autophagy
  and DNA damage response to SASP via IL-1A and TRAF3IP2. NAD+, ROS, and DNA from
  damaged mitochondria are also involved in regulating SASP. Increase in transcription
  of LINE-1, a retrotransposable element in senescent cells facilitates accumulation
  of cDNA in the cytoplasm which leads to the activation of cGAS/STING pathway. In
  addition to LINE-1, CCFs, and DNA from damaged mitochondria are recognized by cGAS
  to generate cGAMP which subsequently activates STING to induce expression of SASP
  factors. The triggers for SASP activation can originate within the cell such as
  DNA damage, CCFs, cytosolic DNA or act on membrane receptors such as HMGB1, IL-1A,
  IL-6, and IL-8. Degradation of the inhibitor IκBα which sequesters NF-κB in cytosol,
  leads to nuclear translocation of NF-κB leading to expression of SASP genes. Recruitment
  of the chromatin reader BRD4 to newly activated super-enhancers adjacent to key
  SASP genes is needed for the SASP and downstream paracrine signaling. CCFs, cytoplasmic
  chromatin fragments; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
