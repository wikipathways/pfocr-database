caption: A schematic diagram of the role of several lncRNAs involved in the modulation
  of the main molecular cascades in multiple sclerosis (MS). One of the main pathophysiological
  mechanisms associated with the MS involves T cells subsets [regulatory T cells (Treg),
  Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells]. Dysregulation of these subsets activates inflammatory
  cascades and cytokine secretion and ultimately leads to demyelination within the
  brain and spinal cord and neuronal damage. Lnc-DC has been shown to be upregulated
  in PBMCs of MS patients. Upregulation of this lncRNA activates Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) and TLR9. TLR4 has a central role in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines
  such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-17 and suppresses Treg cells. Also, TLR4 increases the
  differentiation of Th17 through inhibition of miR-30a (, ). Moreover, lnc-DDIT4
  is upregulated in the PBMCs of MS patients. This lncRNA binds to DDIT4 and regulates
  immune response and differentiation of Th17 (). BDNF-AS has a role in the recruitment
  of PRC2 and inhibition of the neuroprotective factor BDNF (). GSTT1-AS1 inhibits
  the progression of MS through inhibition of secretion of IFN-γ and TNF-α (). TUG1
  activates p38 MAPK signaling pathway through suppression of miR-20a-5p, so downregulation
  of TUG1 decreases Th17 differentiation. UCA1 has a role in the regulation of activity
  of PI3K–AKT, ERK1/2, and MAPK cascades and Th17 differentiation. Also, this lncRNA
  has interaction with another lncRNA, namely, CCAT2. CCAT2 induces WNT cascade signaling
  and enhances the production of inflammatory cytokines (, ).
