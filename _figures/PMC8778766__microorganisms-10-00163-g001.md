caption: Engineered biosynthetic pathway in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain LRS6.
  Galactose is converted to the universal diterpenoid precursor, GGPP, via the mevalonate
  pathway. The first enzyme in the paclitaxel pathway, TASY, catalyzes the conversion
  of GGPP to taxadiene and small amounts of its isomer, iso-taxadiene. The second
  enzyme, CYP725A4, coupled with its cognate reductase subsequently catalyzes the
  oxidation of taxadiene to T5αol. The third enzyme, TAT, then catalyzes the acetylation
  of T5αol. The native, overexpressed genes are highlighted in green, whilst heterologous
  genes are highlighted in red. The dashed arrows highlight the undesirable side-products;
  the structures of the two well-characterized by-products, OCT and iso-OCT are shown.
