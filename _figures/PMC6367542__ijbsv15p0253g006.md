caption: Proposed mechanisms of adiponectin-induced growth inhibition of pancreatic
  cancer. The binding of adiponectin to its receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 on pancreatic
  cancer cells inhibits the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, which promotes the degradation
  of β-catenin via enhancing its phosphorylation. Moreover, the activation of adiponectin
  signaling suppresses the expression of β-catenin-associated transcription factor
  TCF7L2 in pancreatic cancer cells. Both of these effects lead to the transcriptional
  inhibition of β-catenin-targeted genes, such as cyclin D1.In consequence, the proliferation
  of pancreatic cancer cells is inhibited. AdipoQ, adiponectin.
