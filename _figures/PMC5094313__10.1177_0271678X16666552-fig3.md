caption: 'Sampling of brain extracellular metabolite levels versus assays of metabolism.
  Glucose is taken up and metabolized by neurons and astrocytes via the glycolytic
  pathway (glucose to pyruvate), pentose phosphate shunt pathway (PPP), and tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle. Glutamine is synthesized in astrocytes via the pyruvate carboxylase
  reaction to generate a “new” molecule of oxaloacetate that condenses with acetyl
  CoA from a second pyruvate molecule to sequentially form α-ketoglutarate, glutamate,
  and glutamine. The glutamine is shuttled to neurons where it serves as precursor
  for the glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter pools. Glutamate released to interstitial
  fluid during excitatotory neurotransmission is avidly taken up into astrocytes,
  and converted (in part) to glutamine for transfer back to neurons. This process
  is called the glutamate-glutamine (Glu-Gln) cycle and the cycle rate is directly
  proportional to the rate of oxidative metabolism over a wide range of brain activity
  levels (reviewed by Rothman et al.). Cerebral metabolic rates (CMR) can be determined
  by assay of arteriovenous differences (A-V) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) rates
  to obtain global rates, use of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography
  (FDG-PET) to assay the hexokinase (HK) step and obtain total glucose utilization,
  or assays of oxidation of 13C-labeled substates using MRS and metabolic modeling.
  Glycogen is contained predominantly in astrocytes and it is a dynamic participant
  in brain metabolism. Microdialysis samples the ECs of compounds in ECF. After entry
  into cells (IC: intracellular concentration), compounds are metabolized via different
  pathways to generate ATP that provides energy for the cells. Note that ECs are the
  net balance of influxes and effluxes to and from blood and brain cells, whereas
  intracellular concentrations are the net balance between transport and metabolism.
