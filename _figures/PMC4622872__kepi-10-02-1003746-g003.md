caption: Epigenetic regulators as central components in melanoma signaling. (A) Epigenetic
  networks. Chromatin modifications are integral to gene regulation at the transcriptional
  level and are guided by lncRNAs acting as specific sequence identifiers or scaffolds.
  PRC and trithorax complexes respectively suppress (red) and induce (green) gene
  expression. Chromatin-modifying enzymes are also regulated by miRNA. DNA methylation
  and demethylation are late events in DNA modification. In the cytoplasm, lncRNAs
  can regulate gene expression by acting as decoys or by undefined mechanisms involving
  ribosome interaction. miRNAs also act as key regulatory molecules in the cytoplasm.
  Each of these transcripts can be regulated through epigenetic events and contributes
  to feedback regulatory loops. (B) Example of an epigenetic intertwine in the melanoma
  signaling pathway. The lncRNA ANRIL may be a transcriptional target of oncogenic
  receptor tyrosine kinase-NRAS-BRAF signaling. ANRIL may recruit PRC2 and PCR1 to
  reduce the expression of tumor suppressor miR-449a and miR-99a. Other miRNAs counteract
  the actions of PRC2-associated EZH2 (miR-101) and DNMT3 (miR-29), and of PRC1-associated
  BMI1 (miR-200c). EZH2 and miR-31 engage in mutual suppression.
