caption: 'Pin1 regulates multiple signal transductions in metabolic organs. Pin1 enhances
  insulin signaling through binding to IRS-1 and suppresses gluconeogenesis by associating
  with CRTC2, CREB and Stat3 in the liver. In addition, Pin1 increases liver fibrosis
  through regulation of the TGF-Smad pathway. In adipocytes, upregulation of insulin
  signaling by Pin1 leads to the induction of lipid synthesis and obesity. However,
  Pin1 suppresses myogenesis via degradation of MEF2C and decreases fatty acid synthesis
  by inhibiting AMPK phosphorylation. Pin1 also enhances osteoblast formation and
  suppresses osteoclast fusion, thereby preventing osteoporosis. Furthermore, Pin1
  is involved in vascular inflammation via the stabilization of p65 protein. Thus,
  while Pin1 clearly operates as a master regulator of metabolism, its roles in certain
  tissues, such as pancreatic islets, the kidney, and brown adipose, remain to be
  determined. (↑): Pin1 positively regulates functions of substrates; (T): Pin1 negatively
  controls functions of substrates; (dotted lines): The regulation by Pin1 have remained
  undetermined; (?): There are no reports which elucidate the roles of Pin1 in these
