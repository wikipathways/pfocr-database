caption: Pathogenicity and factors associated with the disruption of the normal cellular
  activity. Hyper-methylation of the CDH1 gene and mutational alteration in TP53 protein
  causes the impaired synthesis of E-cadherin. The truncated APC causes accumulation
  of β-catenin, which activates the β-catenin-dependent genes and Wnt pathway, altering
  normal cellular functions. The Wnt pathway after its activation causes the accumulation
  of β-catenins in cytoplasm and its translocation into the nucleus where it transcriptionally
  activates the transcription factors belonging to the TCF family. The recurrent mutation
  in RhoA is able to alter the RhoA pathway, which has a deleterious effect on E-cadherin.
