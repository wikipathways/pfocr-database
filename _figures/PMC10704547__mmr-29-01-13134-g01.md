caption: AhR ligand-activated pathways mediate pro-cancer activities in breast cancer
  cells. HAHs (such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), PAHs (such as benzo[a]pyrene)
  and structural analogues (such as chlorpyrifos) may enhance cell motility and promote
  cell migration and invasion via the HDAC6/c-Myc, c-Src/HER1/STAT5b, HER1/ERK1/2,
  Wnt/β-Catenin and PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. (A) In triple-negative breast
  cancer cells, endogenous tryptophan metabolites as AhR ligands also participate
  in distant metastasis of cells. (B) Ligand-activated AhR interacts with a variety
  of signaling molecules to mediate the cancer promoting effect of breast cancer cells.
  (a) The interaction of AhR and GR inhibits apoptosis by inducing the expression
  of Brk. (b) The interaction of AhR with both ERα and NOS promotes the expression
  of VEGF, while the interaction of AhR with NOS promotes the expression of COX-2.
  Subsequently, the increased expression levels of VEGF and COX-2 promotes angiogenesis.
  (c) The interaction of AhR and TNF-α promotes the production of inflammatory factors
  such as IL-6. (d) The interaction of AhR and IL-6 induces DNA damage via the miR-27b-CYP1B1
  signaling pathway. AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; AP1, activator protein 1; ARNT,
