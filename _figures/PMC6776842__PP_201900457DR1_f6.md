caption: 'Schematic representation of the role of FDX5 in specific pathways in Chlamydomonasunder
  S-deprived conditions. Metabolic pathways functioning in the different organelles
  (chloroplast and mitochondria) in Chlamydomonas are presented (). Numbers represent
  the three specific pathways where physiological effects of FDX5 deletion has been
  demonstrated experimentally: 1, PsbA-involving photosynthetic electron transfer
  pathway; 2, starch synthesis pathway; 3, acetate utilization pathway. CBB, Calvin–Benson–Bassham;
  G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; OAA, oxaloacetate.'
