caption: A model for dynamic regulation of Foxp3 expression in Treg precursors and
  differentiated Treg. (a) The signalling and transcriptional landscape of Treg precursors.
  Before Foxp3 transcription is initiated, Treg precursors receive signals from TCR,
  CD28 and TNFRSF. These signals induce transcription factors required for the initiation
  of Foxp3, including NFAT, c‐Rel and AP‐1, which bind the promoter and CNS3 of the
  Foxp3 gene in thymic T‐cells. Here prolonged CD28 signals can also inhibit Foxp3
  transcription through activating Akt and mTOR and thereby inactivating Foxo proteins,
  which have roles in activating Foxp3 transcription. TNFRSF molecules such as GITR,
  OX40 and TNFR2 are expressed in both mature Treg and differentiating Treg including
  Foxp3‐ Treg precursors, and activate the NF‐κB pathway. (b) Maintenance of Foxp3
  transcription through Foxp3 autoregulatory transcriptional circuit in mature Treg.
  Once Foxp3 protein is translated, it will join the regulation of Foxp3 transcription,
  establishing Foxp3 autoregulatory transcriptional loop. CNS2 plays key roles in
  the maintenance of Foxp3 expression, and is bound by both AML1/Runx1 and Foxp3 in
  mature Treg. Thus, it is considered that Foxp3 interacts with AML1/Runx1 in CNS2,
  which triggers DNA demethylation of the region, which is also known as TSDR. In
  addition, IL‐2 signalling may consolidate Foxp3 transcription through STAT5 binding
  to CNS2.
