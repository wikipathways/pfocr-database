caption: The Telomere Checkpoint model. A defect in the telomere, such as a critically
  short telomere, triggers the checkpoint pathway (thick black arrows), which requires
  the activity of Mec3p, Mec1p, and Ddc2p. This leads to cell cycle arrest followed
  by activation and/or recruitment of telomerase to the short telomeres. The DNA damage
  pathway (thin black arrows) signals to Mec3p, Mec1p, and Ddc2p and a parallel pathway
  involving Tel1p is activated. The two DNA damage pathways converge at Rad9p and
  Rad53p. Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint leads to cell cycle arrest and activation
  of DNA repair activities but does not activate telomerase.
