caption: IL-6 transduces signals via membrane-anchored gp130 molecules through a classical
  pathway initiated by binding to membrane-anchored IL-6Rα (mIL-6Rα) or by a transsignaling
  mechanism in which IL-6 associates with a soluble form of IL-6Rα (sIL-6Rα). IL-6/IL-6Rα
  then recruits gp130 into hexameric complexes that initiate activation of the downstream
  signaling molecules STAT3 and ERK-1/2. IL-6 is causal in increasing the adhesive
  potential of both lymphocytes and vascular endothelial cells, which leads to enhanced
  trafficking of lymphocytes to lymphoid organs as well as to sites of acute and chronic
  inflammation.
