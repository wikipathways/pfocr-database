caption: (A) Comparison of NHR signaling in nematodes and mammals. In nematodes, oxidation/epimerization
  in position 3, oxidation in position 7, and side chain oxidation produces ligands
  of DAF-12, whereas similar modification of the steroid skeleton in mammals produces
  bile acids that serve as ligands of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) () and possibly LXR
  (). Colors are used to highlight the functions of known enzymes in this pathway,
  whereas enzymes introducing the structural features highlighted in gray have not
  been described.(B) Biosynthesis model for DAF-12-ligands regulating development
  and lifespan. Enzymes in the XXX cells downstream of insulin and TGF-β signaling
  produce small quantities of DAF-12 ligands, which trigger additional biosynthesis
  of DAF-12 ligands via upregulation of DAF-9 expression in the hypodermis, dependent
  on intestinally expressed DAF-36 and possibly other tissues. Although DAF-9 has
  been assumed to act directly upstream of DAF-12, our results suggest that DAF-9
  may act on a variety of different substrates, including both 3-keto and 3-hydroxy
  sterols. Ligand biosynthesis is additionally regulated by STRM-1 and feedback through
  DAF-12. The lifespan-increasing effects of DAF-12 ligands depend on germ cell removal.
