caption: 'Stress and the regulation of the major metabolic pathway of tryptophan:
  the kynurenine pathway. From the bottom right, in a basal state 5% of dietary tryptophan
  is metabolized into serotonin while 95% of tryptophan is metabolized into kynurenine
  [,]. Chronic stress is known to increase pro-inflammatory cytokines and elevate
  glucocorticoid levels through dysregulation of the HPA axis []. Glucocorticoids
  enhance TDO expression in the brain, liver and gut, while pro-inflammatory cytokines
  enhance IDO expression in the brain and gut as well as KMO expression in the brain
  [,]. Since KMO is the first enzyme involved in metabolizing kynurenine into neurotoxic
  quinolinic acid and since kynurenine is capable of crossing the blood-brain-barrier,
  chronic stress therefore increases neurotoxicity in the brain by upregulation of
  the neurotoxic branch of the kynurenine pathway [,]. HPA—hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
  axis; GR—glucocorticoid receptor; TDO—tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase; IDO—indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase;
  KMO—kynurenine 3-monooxygenase; KYNU—kynureninase; 3-HK—3-hydroxykynurenine; 3-HAA—3-hydroxyanthranilic
