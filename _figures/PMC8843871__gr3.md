caption: Post-translational regulation of lncRNAs in HCC. (A) LncRNAs interact with
  proteins and enhance their stability by preventing the degradation of ubiquitin
  proteasome system. (B) LncRNA could induce proteins degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. (C) LncRNA could modify protein complex assembly to exert various biological
  function. (D) LncRNA promotes phosphorization of target proteins by preventing dephosphorization
  of phosphatase. (E) LncRNA binds to target protein and inhibits its nuclear export.
