caption: 'USP5 participates in immune regulation through a variety of signaling pathways.
  (A): knockdown of USP5, which allows the competitive binding of accumulated unanchored
  polyubiquitin and inhibits proteasomal recognition sites on P53, thereby inhibiting
  the proteasomal-mediated degradation of p53 and increasing its transcriptional activity
  to negatively regulate p53-related pathways. (B): Smurf1 interacts with USP5, promotes
  the degradation of USP5 through the ubiquitin protease pathway, and reduces the
  protein expression of USP5, thereby inhibiting the production of TNF-α. On the other
  hand, USP5 physically interacts with Smurf1 and inhibits the expression of IFN-activated
  antiviral genes by decreasing the level of polyubiquitination of Smurf1 and enhancing
  the stability and turnover capacity of Smurf1. (C): USP5 bridges STUB1 to RIG-I
  and promotes the formation of the K48-linked ubiquitin chains on RIG-I, thus facilitating
  the degradation of RIG-I and inhibiting type I IFN signaling. (D): USP5 selectively
  promotes K48-linked NLRP3 polyubiquitination by recruiting the E3 ligases MARCHF7
  and mediates its degradation via the autophagy lysosome pathway. (E): USP5 enhances
  the stability of MLL5, HIF2α, β-catenin, FoxM1, PD-L1, and other proteins via deubiquitination.
  (F): On the one hand, USP5 interacts with IKKβ and prevents IKKβ ubiquitination,
  which in turn inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway; on the other hand, USP5 promotes
  the NF-κB signaling pathway by deubiquitinating TRAF6. Created using Figdraw.com
