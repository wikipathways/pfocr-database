caption: Figure 4. Ingenuity Systems Analysis of modulated genes upon invasive conditions.
  (A) Functional network connecting the 91 differentially expressed invasive genes
  identified in Cas/B2 vs. B2 acini involved in “cellular growth and proliferation,
  cellular movement, and cancer” from analyses carried on with Ingenuity™ Pathway
  Analysis. Score = 50. (B) Functional network connecting the 232 differentially expressed
  invasive genes identified in Cas/B2 vs. Cas acini involved in “cellular movement,
  skeletal and muscular system development and function, cancer”. Score = 35. Gene
  products are represented as nodes and biological relationships between two nodes
  as a line. Continuous lines indicate direct interactions, while dashed lines represent
  indirect connections. The green and red symbols represent down- and upregulation
  respectively, while the white symbols indicate genes absent in the data set but
  related with the data set genes (A and B).
