caption: LPS activation of the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) induces the
  expression of tissue factor (TF) as well as the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα. LPS
  activation of the MAPKs is also required for the expression of the anti-inflammatory
  cytokine, IL-10. LPS activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt
  signaling pathway inhibits the expression of TF and TNFα by 1) direct Akt-dependent
  inhibition of the MAPK signaling cascades and 2) supporting IL-10 production through
  the activation of mTOR. The relative contribution of each anti-inflammatory mechanism
  likely depends on the degree to which Akt is activated. Our studies in PTEN−/− PMs
  suggest that Akt-dependent MAPK inhibition is a critical anti-inflammatory pathway
  under conditions of exaggerated Akt activation.
