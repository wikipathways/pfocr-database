caption: A model of the inhibitory effect of metformin in PMA-induced migration and
  invasion. This scheme delineates signalling steps identified in the present study.
  Metformin significantly suppressed MMP-9 activation by blocking the Ca2+ influx
  and the PKCα/ERK and JNK/AP-1-signalling pathways, and consequent reductions in
  migration and invasion of human fibrosarcoma cells were identified.
