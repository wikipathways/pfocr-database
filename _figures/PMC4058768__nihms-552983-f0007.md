caption: Induction of EMT and breast cancer progression through aberrant activation
  of Aurora-A kinase activity. Constitutive activation of HER-2/MAPK signaling pathway
  during tumor growth leads to stabilization and accumulation of Aurora-A kinase.
  Aurora-A kinase activation in turn increases the expression levels of HER-2/Neu
  receptor, creating a ‘positive feedback loop’ between HER-2/Neu and Aurora-A tumorigenic
  activity. Aberrant Aurora-A kinase activity induces EMT and the development of a
  mesenchymal phenotype responsible for distant metastases. Targeting Aurora-A kinase
  signaling pathway can be effective for eliminating highly invasive breast cancer
  cells and suppress tumor progression.
