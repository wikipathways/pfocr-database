caption: Glycolysis. Glycolysis consists of two stages, the first stage consuming
  ATP and the second stage generating ATP. There are three crucial reactions in tumor
  cells. First, HK catalyzes the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Second,
  fructose-6-phosphate is converted into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by PFK1, and fructose
  1,6-bisphosphate is converted into fructose 2,6-bisphosphate by PFK2. Third, phosphoenolpyruvate
  is converted into pyruvate by PK. Curved arrows indicate that HK, PFK1 and PK are
  overexpressed in cancer cells. HK, hexokinase; PK, pyruvate kinase; PFK, phosphofructokinase.
