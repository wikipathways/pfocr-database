caption: (i) α1-ARs are G-protein-coupled receptors that couple through Gαq to activate
  phospholipase C (PLC) β and possibly PLCε. PLCβ/ε hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol
  4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce diacylglycerol (DAG) which activates protein
  kinase C (PKC) family members and guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Ras (e.g.
  RasGRP). This results in activation of the ERK1/2 cascade that affects downstream
  signalling and gene expression. (ii) Activation of the small G protein Rac1 results
  in an increase in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via NADPH oxidases
  (NOX). ROS inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), and this may lead to increased
  tyrosine phosphorylation of INSRs/INSRRs, with receptor activation and downstream
  signalling. (iii) Src family kinases (SFKs) may be activated, possibly by phosphatidic
  acid produced by phospholipase D (activated by PKC; pathway not shown). SFKs may
  phosphorylate INSRs/INSRRs directly to cause receptor activation. (iv) α1-ARs increase
  intracellular pHi via an unknown mechanism and this needs to be neutralised. SFKs
  phosphorylate anion exchanger 3 (AE3) to increase exchange of Cl− and HCO3− delivering
  HCO3− to the extracellular space. Intracellular HCO3− is probably generated by carbonic
  anhydrase II (CAII). Simultaneous production of H+ reduces intracellular pHi. Extracellular
  HCO3− may increase extracellular pHo to activate INSRRs via a conformational change
  of the extracellular α-subunit.
