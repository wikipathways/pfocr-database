caption: The large cadherin Dachsous (Ds) acts as an inhibitory ligand for the large
  cadherin Fat. Fat functions to regulate planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling by
  recruiting the transcriptional co-repressor Atrophin (Atro). Atrophin represses
  the transcription of the PCP gene four-jointed. It is unclear at present the identity
  of the transcription factor Atro binds to regulate four-jointed transcription. Fat
  also regulates growth via control of the Hippo kinase (Hpo) pathway. Current models
  suggest that Fat regulates Hpo activity either through the FERM domain protein Expanded
  or the small myosin-like protein Dachs. Dachs has been shown to regulate the stability
  of Wts Wts phosphorylates Yki, leading to its export from the nucleus. In the absence
  of Fat or the other Hpo components, Yki promotes the transcription of Cyclin E,
  the micro RNA bantam and the anti-apoptotic gene Diap1. Sav and Mats are adaptor
  proteins essential for Hpo and Wts activity. Merlin (Mer) is another FERM domain
  protein that functions in parallel to Expanded in controlling activity of the Hippo
  pathway.
