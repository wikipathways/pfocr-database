caption: In the apoB-dependent pathway (black arrows), apoB48 becomes assembled in
  the ER with initially small amounts of triglycerides that are synthesized mainly
  by DGAT2 and transferred via MTP. UC imported from the gut lumen into the enterocyte
  via NPC1L1 and possibly other proteins becomes esterified by ACAT2 and also packaged
  into the newly forming apoB48 lipoprotein. Continued lipidation in the ER inflates
  the particle, requiring stabilization of its surface by phospholipids and apoA-IV.
  The nascent particles are then transferred to the Golgi apparatus in noncanonical
  transport vesicles, further lipidated, and finally secreted as CMs into lymph. Some
  of the absorbed cholesterol and essentially all of the dietary noncholesterol sterols
  are pumped out of the enterocyte, back into the intestinal lumen for elimination
  from the body (blue arrows). In the apoB-independent pathway (green arrows), UC
  is absorbed into the enterocyte, and then ABCA1 facilitates its efflux from the
  plasma membrane onto extracellular apoA-I molecules. Movement onto preexisting extracellular
  HDL also occurs. The apoA-I originates both from local intestinal synthesis and
  from plasma. Absorption of NEFAs, monoglycerides, and lipid micronutrients across
  the brush border and esterification by acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase
  enzymes are not shown here. CE, cholesteryl ester; PC, phosphatidylcholine; Sito,
  sitosterol and other noncholesterol sterols.
