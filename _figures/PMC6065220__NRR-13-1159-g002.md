caption: 'Role of adrenergic receptor on AMPA receptor trafficking-induced synaptic
  plasticity.A schema showing the hypothesis of antidepressant-induced activation
  of α2-adrenoceptor stimulation following the noradrenaline (NA)-reuptake inhibitors
  (NRIs)-blocked NA transporter at the presynaptic side. Enhanced released of NA stimulated
  the β3-adrenoceptor which promotes the induction of brain derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF) expression and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)
  receptor trafficking signaling. β3-adrenoceptor is coupled with Gs protein which
  activates the adenylyl cyclase (AC) on the plasma membrane. AC activation produces
  the cyclic AMP (cAMP) which regulates the protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates
  the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) which regulates the transcription
  of the BDNF. Gs protein coupled receptor activates another signal transduction mechanisms,
  such as phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway which phosphorylates the Akt. Activated
  Akt phosphorylates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) which leads the translation
  of BDNF. A BDNF is capable of increasing the mRNA expression of glutamate receptor
  (GluR)1 and GluR2 subunit of AMPA receptor through interacting with the TrkB, a
  receptor of BDNF and promote the synaptic localization of GluR1 via transportation
  of postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 protein from the soma to the dendritic regions
  to anchor the GluR1 at the synaptic membrane in a PI3K-AKT-dependent process. This
  process also plays a role in maintaining the long-term potentiation (LTP) which
  is thought to be an effect of antidepressants in hippocampus. ER: Endoplasmic reticulum.'
