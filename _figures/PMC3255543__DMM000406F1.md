caption: 'Overview of defensive pathways in Drosophila. (A) The epithelial barrier.
  The epithelial barrier consists of secreted proteins that form the hard outer cuticle,
  which is composed of an inner layer of cross-linked proteins and chitin (a polysaccharide),
  and an outer cuticulin layer. Additionally, a tight barrier between cells, consisting
  of an basolateral adhesive zone [involving adherens junctions (AJs)] and more basal
  sealing junctions [septate junctions (SJs)] prevents free passage of pathogens,
  macromolecules and solutes between cells in the paracellular space. In vertebrates,
  the equivalent of the SJ is the tight junction, which is located apically to the
  AJ (reviewed in ). Proteins such as self-adhesive cadherins (DE-cadherin in Drosophila),
  catenins (not shown) and signaling molecules, such as the Notch receptor and its
  ligand Delta, are targeted to the AJ by the exocyst complex, the formation of which
  is initiated by an interaction between Rab11 and Sec15 (not shown; see section on
  bacterial toxins in the main text, and ). AJ proteins link to the actin cytoskeleton
  to create cytoskeletal continuity between cells, and actin also links to the SJ
  (e.g. via the ZO1 protein Discs-large and Scribble; not shown). Claudins localized
  to SJs (in flies) or tight junctions (in vertebrates) play an important role in
  forming a band-like seal that prevents large molecules or objects from freely passing
  between cells. (B) Pathogen immobilization. There are three types of blood cells
  (hemocytes) in Drosophila: plasmatocytes, which bind to cellular pathogens and phagocytose
  them; lamellocytes, which wrap foreign bodies in sheets to engulf them; and crystal
  cells, which express the enzymes required to produce and secrete melanin to encase
  and immobilize pathogens. (C) Simplified schemes of the Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT immune
  signaling pathways are shown. The Toll signaling pathway mediates the response to
  many Gram-positive bacteria and fungal pathogens, which in many cases are recognized
  when secreted PGRPs initiate an extracellular proteolytic cascade culminating in
  the processing of pro-Spätzle into the mature Spätzle ligand for the Toll receptor.
  (This indirect mechanism of pathogen detection contrasts with that which occurs
  in mammals, in which Toll-family-member receptors directly bind to distinct pathogen-associated
  molecules.) Once activated by binding to Spätzle, Toll recruits a complex of DEATH-domain
  proteins (MyD88, Tube and Pelle), which results in dissociation of the inhibitory
  IκB-like protein Cactus from the NFκB-like transcription factor Dif, allowing Dif
  to translocate into the nucleus to activate expression of Toll-responsive genes,
  as typified by the AMP encoded by drosomycin. In the IMD pathway, Gram-negative
  bacteria are detected by a transmembrane PGRP (PGRP-LE), which signals via the cytoplasmic
  protein IMD. The pathway branches at IMD to activate the dFADD-Dredd complex and
  the MAPKKK Drosophila TAK1 (dTak1), where the pathway splits again. One branch acts
  via the IKK complex in concert with the dFADD-Dredd complex to activate the NFκB-like
  protein Relish by cleaving an inhibitory tail consisting of ankyrin repeats (circles).
  The DNA-binding domain of Relish then enters the nucleus and activates expression
  of IMD-responsive genes encoding AMPs, such as diptericin. The other branch emanating
  from dTak1 activates MAPKKs in the JNK and p38 pathways (at least in mammalian cells).
  In Drosophila, the MAPKK in the JNK pathway is Hemipterous (Hep). JNK (also known
  as Bsk in Drosophila) activation eventuates in activation of the AP1 transcription
  factor. The JAK-STAT pathway: infection of flies with bacteria or viruses leads
  to the production of signals such as the Unpaired (Upd) ligands, which bind and
  activate the Domeless receptor (related to vertebrate IL-6 receptor), leading to
  activation of the fly Janus kinase (JAK) Hopscotch (Hop). Activated Hop phosphorylates
  receptor-bound signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT; STAT92E in
  flies), which then dimerizes, enters the nucleus and activates transcription of
  effector target genes such as totA (; ). (D) RNAi pathway. Once viruses enter the
  cell and shed their protective outer coat, viral RNA molecules are exposed to the
  cytoplasm and form double-stranded secondary structures or double-stranded reverse-transcribed
  RNA-DNA intermediates. These regions of double-stranded RNA are acted on by the
  Dicer complex to generate 21-base-pair double-stranded silencing oligonucleotides
  called viral siRNAs (v-siRNAs), which are then ‘melted’ to generate single strands
  that are complementary to the viral RNA; this, in combination with the RISC complex,
  leads to silencing of the viral RNA.'
