caption: Proposed mechanisms of HGF/c-Met-induced NADPH oxidase regulation. (A) post-translational
  regulation. HGF treatment induces the release of p22 from c-Met-p22 interaction
  leading to NADPH oxidase assembling and activation. In addition HGF/c-Met activates
  PKCδ which can phosphorylate Nrf2 and enable NAPDH oxidase activity. Once activated,
  Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus to drive the expression of survival genes such
  as NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) or γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS).
  Transcriptional regulation. (B) In the absent of HGF/c-Met stimulus, NADPH oxidase
  is functional and can be used by cytotoxic factors such as transforming growth factor
  beta (TGFβ) to induce cell death. (C) The sustained HGF stimulus leads to the transcriptional
  repression of NADPH oxidase subunits; this effect could abrogate the cytotoxic action
  of TGFβ resulting in a survival response.
