caption: Figure 1. Cyanide and the plant immune response. Pathogen attack induces
  the biosynthesis of hormones, mainly jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) in response
  to necrotrophic pathogens and salicylic acid (SA) in response to biotrophic pathogens,
  although biotrophes can also induce ET biosynthesis. In our model, cyanide, which
  is produced concomitantly to ethylene, enters mitochondria where it generates a
  direct and/or indirect a signal that stimulates the SA-dependent response pathway.
