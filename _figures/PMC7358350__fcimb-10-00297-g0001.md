caption: 'The Central Nervous System (CNS) is connected with the gut thought Autonomic
  Nervous System (ANS), that is divided into: Sympathetic (SNS), Parasympathetic (PNS),
  and Enteric (ENS) Nervous Systems. The SNS exerts mainly an inhibitory effect on
  GI tract and regulates GI blood flow. The PNS exerts both excitatory and inhibitory
  control over gastric and intestinal tone and motility. The main component of PNS
  is the Vagal Nerve that affects the peristalsis and the sphincter muscles of gut,
  and by afferent spinal and vagal sensory neurons. It sends feedbacks from the GI
  tract to the brain stem, which in turn engages the hypothalamus and limbic system
  for data processing. Finally, the ENS, located in the walls of the GI tract and
  described as a “second brain” (an extensive system composed of about 500 million
  neurons, exceeding those at the level of the spinal cord), communicates with the
  CNS via SNS and PNS. The ENS displays sophisticated coordination and exhibits plasticity
  and learning in response to changing dietary habits. In the intestine up to 80,000
  vagal afferent nerve terminations are present, which send and receive signals, to
  and from the brain in a rate of 9:1. The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis
  coordinates adaptive responses to stress and activate memory and emotional centers
  in the limbic system of the brain and is also able to influence the composition
  of the gut microbiota and increase GI permeability. In the case of pathogen invasion,
  tissue damage, or homeostatic dysregulation, signals are processed by the CNS and
  sent to sympathetic and efferent vagal nerves, that release catecholamine and acetylcholine,
  respectively, under control of immune cells. The HPA axis through release of corticosteroids,
  with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, regulates brain–immune pathway.
  The Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) comprises 70% of the body''s immune system;
  chronic stress has been shown to alter intestinal permeability (i.e., leaky gut
  syndrome), which is associated with a low-grade inflammation that can be functionally
  linked to several neurological disorders. On the other hand, also gut microbiota
  contributes to connect the gut to the brain compartment. Bacterial products can
  stimulate enteroendocrine cells (EEC) to produce several neuropeptides that can
  enter the bloodstream and/or directly influence the ENS, activate immune cells that
  release cytokines or activate the vagal nerve. This can affect the physiology of
  the brain, including neurotransmission and neurogenesis, but may also be involved
  in neuroinflammation.'
