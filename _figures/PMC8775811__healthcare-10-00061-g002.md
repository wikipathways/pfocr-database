caption: 'The methionine cycle. Methionine is converted to SAM by methionine adenosyltransferase
  (MAT) and subsequently used as a methyl donor in methyltransferase reactions. This
  yields SAH as a byproduct, hydrolyzed to homocysteine. Homocysteine is removed from
  the cycle by conversion to homocysteine thiolactone or through the trans-sulfuration
  pathway to cysteine. Alternatively, it is remethylated by one of two pathways: using
  methionine synthase with B12 as a cofactor and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a methyl
  donor or using betaine homocysteine methyltransferase and betaine as a methyl donor.'
