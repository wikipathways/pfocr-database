  into the heterologous host. , Start of the biosynthetic cluster with upstream region;
  ▨, overlapping region; ▪, end of the cluster and downstream region; P, PacI restriction
  site; Cm, chloramphenicol resistance selection marker; Km, kanamycin resistance
  selection marker derived from Tn903 and Tn5; Zeo, zeocin resistance selection marker;
  tet, tetracycline resistance selection marker, ori, p15A origin of replication;
  oriT, origin of transfer; TA′, fragment of the TA encoding gene from M. xanthus;
  trpE, homologous target from P. putida; Pm, P. putida toluate catabolic pathway
  promoter; xylS, regulator of the promoter.
