caption: 'STAT4 activation and the expression of its downstream genes in the genome:
  TAA1 recognition by ScFv/IL-12Rβ receptor leads to STAT4 activation. Activated STAT4
  binds to its conventional promoters in the T cell genome. This binding automatically
  expresses favorable genes in addition to expressing the inserted vector genes. STAT
  4 conventional genes include IFN-γ and Tbx21 (T-bet), which induces TH1 phenotype
  and cytotoxicity in T cells (). This expression could potentiate T cells’ proliferation
  and survival and attenuate inflammatory processes in the tumor area. JAK2 also activates
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR cell survival signaling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in T cell
  proliferation, survival, and protein synthesis.'
