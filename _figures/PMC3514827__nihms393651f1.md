caption: 1α25 (OH2) D3 maybe promoting a more differentiated phenotype in cancer cells
  by preventing the translocation of β-catenin or its ability to form complexes with
  TCF4, thus decreasing mRNA levels of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation.
  Additionally, 1α25 (OH2) D3 can interact with VDR and promote the mRNA expression
  of cell differentiation and arrest genes. Finally, 1α25 (OH2) D3 can alter Id expression
  in colon carcinoma cells, by increasing the expression of Id1 and decreasing the
  levels of Id2; therefore, promoting colon cancer cell differentiation and decreasing
  proliferation, respectively.
