caption: NF‐κB signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome in AS. The activation of inflammasome
  requires two signals. The first signal is that ammonia and mtDNA bind to TLRs, thereby
  activating NF‐κB signaling and promoting the transcrition of NLRP3, pro‐IL‐1β, and
  pro‐IL‐18. Another signal is that NLRP3 is directly activated by PAMPs and DAMPs,
  and then converts procaspase‐1 recruited by ASC into caspase‐1, which catalyzes
  the conversion of pro‐IL‐1 β and pro‐IL‐18 into their mature products IL‐1 β and
  IL‐18
