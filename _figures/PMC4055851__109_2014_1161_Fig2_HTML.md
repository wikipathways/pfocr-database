caption: Mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR moAbs in mCRC. a Activating mutations
  of EGFR effectors, such as KRAS (by either point mutations or gene amplification),
  BRAF and PI3KCA, or PTEN loss of function, cause persistent activation of downstream
  signaling despite EGFR inhibition. b Aberrant activation (by either receptor gene
  amplification or high ligand levels) of alternative receptors, such as HER2 or MET
  (not shown), can bypass EGFR inhibition and mediate downstream pathway activation.
  c Additional genetic alterations within the target oncogene may abrogate drug binding.
  The EGFR S492R mutation inhibits cetuximab but not panitumumab binding, mediating
  acquired resistance to the former but not the latter in mCRC patients. d Other mechanisms
  of resistance may be “pathway independent,” such as altered angiogenesis (through
  increased secretion of VEGF or activation of VEGFR-1/2), dysregulation of EGFR recycling
  (with consequent increase of EGFR degradation), or tumor-stroma interactions (i.e.,
  through increased release of antiapoptotic growth factors and cytokines, such as
  HGF)
