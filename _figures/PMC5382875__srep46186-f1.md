caption: (a) Preparation of the CNCs. (b) Proposed mechanism for the cancer cell killing.
  The CNCs enter the blood vessel via systemic administration. Then, they accumulate
  in tumor tissue through the EPR effect, are taken up by cancer cells, obtain cytosolic
  delivery, and finally induce cell apoptosis via the synergistic anticancer effect
  of DTX and miRNA-34a.
