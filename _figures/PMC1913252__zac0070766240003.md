caption: Simplified ergosterol metabolism pathway as described for S. cerevisiae (http://www.yeastgenome.org/).
  Genes indicated in red are up-regulated in C. parapsilosis following addition of
  farnesol, genes indicated in green are down-regulated by farnesol addition, genes
  indicated in black show no reproducible change in expression, and genes indicated
  in gray are absent from our arrays.
