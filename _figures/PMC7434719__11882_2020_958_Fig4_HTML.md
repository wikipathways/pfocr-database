caption: 'TGF-β participates in the regulation of airway inflammation and remodeling
  process. Three TGF-β isoforms have been found in the human body, respectively: TGF-β1,
  TGF-β2, TGF-β3.TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3 are localized on chromosomes 19q13, 1q41
  and 14q24, respectively. A promoter for TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 isoforms possesses in
  its structure a classical TATAA box domain and a CRE-ATF terminal region. TGF-β1
  stimulates fibroblast activation and promotes the differentiation of fibroblasts
  into myofibroblasts and accelerates collagen synthesis in tissue remodeling. Differentiated
  myofibroblasts increased the expression of ECM components such as fibronectin, promoting
  massive amounts of ECM deposition, which leads to tissue remodeling. In addition,
  TGF-β1 binds to receptor TGFβ-IIR and activates Smad signal transduction pathway.
  TGF-β1 is an important factor in the transactivate MUC5AC promoter activity through
  Smad4 and Sp1.TGF-β1-Smad3/4 signaling acts as a negative regulator via MAPK14.
  Inhibitor in MUC5AC transcription. (MAPK14:Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14;
  Sp1:specificity protein 1)'
