caption: 'Gene expression fold changes induced by BMP6 in three representative significant
  KEGG pathways. Each pathway shown is at its most perturbed time point: (a) TGF-beta
  signaling pathway at 8h; (b) Focal adhesion at 10d; (c) MAPK signaling pathway at
  24h. Gene expression level fold changes are standardized over the standard deviation
  of fold changes for all genes. The standardized fold changes are visualized by using
  KEGGanim web tool []. Note that one KEGG node may correspond to multiple closely
  related genes with the same function. Relevant other pathways are magnified locally
  for better view. Gene names are intentionally omitted by KEGGanim for clear view
  of the gene expression changes in pseudo-color.'
