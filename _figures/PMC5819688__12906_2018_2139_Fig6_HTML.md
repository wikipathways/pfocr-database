caption: Schematic diagram showing the working hypothesis of Anacardic Acid. As shown
  in the diagram, AA inhibits pancreatic cancer growth by the increase of Chmp1A protein,
  which leads to phosphorylation of ATM, an indication of activation. Phospho- ATM
  then induces activation of p53 via phosphorylation of p53 (shown in short black
  arrows). 5- FU or GEM may utilize the similar signaling pathway as AA for its anticancer
  action, increasing Chmp1A protein to activation of ATM and p53 (shown in short red
  arrows). Subsequently, AA synergizes with 5-FU or GEM (indicated as double headed
  black arrows), and increases the activation of signaling pathway and cancer cell
  grwoth inhibition (shown as black and red arrows together). Black arrows indicate
  signaling activities for both sufficient and necessary action, and red for sufficient
  action only
