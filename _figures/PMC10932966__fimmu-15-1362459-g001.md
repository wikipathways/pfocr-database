caption: The two Sphks play different roles. Sphk1, which exists in the cytoplasm,
  is activated and produces S1P, which can directly act on macrophages, cause the
  production of interleukin 1-β, the release of NLRP3 inflammasome and the activation
  of pro-inflammatory signaling pathway (NF-κB pathway), aggravating inflammatory
  response. At the same time, under the action of SPHK1 in the cytoplasm, S1P increases
  the level of S1P in the blood circulation, oxidative stress leads to increased permeability,
  causes vascular endothelial leakage, and is characterized by pro-inflammatory effect.
  While Sphk2, which exists in the nucleus, is activated and produces S1P, which directly
  acts on intestinal epithelial cells, inhibits the activation of pro-inflammatory
  signaling pathway (NF-κB pathway), and reduces inflammatory response. SPHK2 can
  reduce the level of S1P in the blood circulation, act on CD11b macrophages, inhibit
  the STING signaling pathway to reduce acute lung injury. In addition, up-regulation
  of Sphk2 can increase the level of S1P in the nucleus, leading to M1 differentiation
  of macrophages and the increase of NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, SPHK2 has both
  pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects
