caption: 'Alterations in 2-AG levels may condition placentation through ER-stress
  and apoptosis activation: a proposed model. The endocannabinoid 2-AG through cannabinoid
  receptor 2 (CB2) signalling induces ER-stress and UPR via PERK arm, activating the
  PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP pathway leading to ROS generation and apoptosis. Moreover,
  as we previously reported, 2-AG is also involved in caspase -3/-7 activation and
  plays a role in trophoblast syncytialization. The signalling pathways involved in
  ER-stress and UPR play key roles in the normal trophoblast apoptosis and syncytialization.
  Changes in 2-AG levels/cannabinoid signalling may disturb those processes and therefore
  the normal trophoblast turnover and promote altered placentation and consequently
  pregnancy disorders, such as preeclampsia and IUGR.'
