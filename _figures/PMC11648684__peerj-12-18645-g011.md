caption: 'Neutrophils: METTL3 regulates neutrophil release from the bone marrow to
  the circulation in a TLR4 signalling-dependent manner through surface expression
  of CXCR2. ALKBH5 promotes neutrophil migration to the site of infection by increasing
  the expression of neutrophil migration-promoting molecules CXCR2 and NLRP12, and
  by decreasing the expression of neutrophil migration-inhibiting molecules PTGER4,
  TNC and WNK1. the site of infection. Macrophage: METTL3 promotes M1 macrophage polarisation
  through STAT1 and HDAC5, etc. FTO promotes macrophage polarisation through the NF-κB
  signalling pathway. YTHDF2 induces M2 macrophage polarisation by inhibiting the
  expression of p53 and inhibits M1 macrophage polarisation through inhibition of
  the NF-κB, p38 and JNK signalling pathways. NK cells: FTO inhibits NK cell activation
  and function by inhibiting SOCS JAK/STAT signalling. YTHDF2 promotes NK cell effector
  function through the formation of a positive feedback loop of STAT5-YTHDF2. T Cells:
  METTL3 promotes the differentiation of naïve T cells to Th1 and Th17 cells and inhibits
  the differentiation of naive T cells to Th1 and Th17 cells by regulating the activity
  of the SOCS family and mediating the activation of STAT5. Th17 cells and inhibits
  differentiation to Th2 cells without affecting Treg. In addition, ALKBH5 promotes
  Jag1/Notch2 signalling and inhibits the expansion of thymic γδ T cells. B cells:
  METTL14 mediates pro-B cell proliferation and cell volume increase while regulating
  the transformation of large pre-B cells to small pre-B cells. In addition, METTL14
  has a crucial role in GC B-cell responses. METTL3 mainly affects the ability of
  GC B cells to mount an effective immune response, whereas it has no significant
  effect on B-cell development. Created with BioRender.com'
