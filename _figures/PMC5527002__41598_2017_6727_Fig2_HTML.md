caption: (a) The proposed metabolic pathway of ortho-phenylphenol (OPP) depicted by
  the genomic analysis of the Sphingomonas haloaromaticamans strain P3; (b) the degradation
  of OPP by strain P3, and the formation of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, benzoic acid (BA)
  and catechol in inoculated (■) and non-inoculated samples (□). Each value is the
  mean of three replicates ± the standard deviation.
