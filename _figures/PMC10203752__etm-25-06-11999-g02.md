caption: Potential mechanisms of proanthocyanidins in treatment of HSP. Proanthocyanidins
  inhibit TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling to arrest OS by eliminating oxidants such as
  ROS, MDA and NO, accompanied by an increase of antioxidants, such as HO-1, SOD and
  GSH. By inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, proanthocyanidins cause a decrease
  in Th2/Th17 cells and an increase in the Treg cells, which inhibits release of inflammatory
  factors (IL-1, IL-6, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, IL-21, LTB4 and TNF-α), activation of B
  cells and antibody production, facilitating immune homeostasis. The aforementioned
  alterations improve the vascular endothelial function and vessel integrity, thereby
  potentially contributing to control of HSP. HSP, Henoch-Schonlein purpura; TLR4,
