caption: 'Location of the C-terminal proton release pathway, as suggested by x-ray
  crystallography studies. (a) Schematic representation of SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic
  reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase) transport cycle showing the major biochemical intermediates
  of the pump. Proton transporting events in the cycle are shown in the dashed box.
  Low-Ca2+ affinity (E2) and high-Ca2+ affinity (E1) states of SERCA are shown in
  blue and red, respectively. (b) The pathway is shown inside the red box showing
  the presence of crystallographic water molecules inside this pore (cyan). We show
  the location of the N-terminal (blue) and C-terminal (red) regions of SERCA. The
  yellow spheres show the boundaries of the lipid bilayer. For this figure, we used
  the crystal of SERCA in the E2 state bound to AlF4- and the inhibitor thapsigargin
  (PDB: 3n5k []).'
