caption: Regulation of SMC Proliferation in Insulin Resistance. The sine qua non of
  insulin resistance in adipose tissue, liver, and muscle is compensatory hyperinsulin-emia.
  In the insulin resistant state, tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor
  and signaling via the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2/PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway
  is impaired resulting in diminished metabolic effects. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 MAPK by insulin is maintained and perpetuated by other growth factors
  resulting in SMC proliferation and migration. As demonstrated by Walcher et al C-peptide,
  secreted in equimolar amounts to insulin, activates both the PI-3 kinase/Akt and
  ERK1/2 MAPK pathways via upstream activation of the Src kinase. Activation of these
  pathways results in SMC proliferation through phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
  protein and cell cycle progression.
