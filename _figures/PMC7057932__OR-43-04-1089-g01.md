caption: Cellular signaling pathways associated with the mutated genes of the biliary
  tract cancer (BTC) cases. The mutated genes in 49 patients with BTCs were found
  to be mainly distributed in the (A) ERBB family signaling pathway and (B) cell cycle
  signaling pathway. Genes responsible for somatic cell variants and the proportion
  of mutated genes in 49 patients are indicated in the signal transduction pathway.
  Different types of variants are marked with different colors, such as mutation (green),
  gain (red), and loss (blue). EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERBB2, Erb-B2
  receptor tyrosine kinase; MET, MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase; NF1,
  neurofibromin 1; KRAS, KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase; HRAS, HRas proto-oncogene, GTPase;
  PIK3CA, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit α; PIK3R2,
  phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 2; ARAF, A-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine
  kinase; BRAF, B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and
  tensin homolog; AKT, protein kinase B; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase;
  MYC, MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor; CDKN2A, cyclin dependent kinase
  inhibitor 2A; CDKN2B, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B; MDM2, MDM2 proto-oncogene;
  TP53, tumor protein P53; ATM, ATM serine/threonine kinase; ATR, ATR serine/threonine
  kinase; CDC25A, cell division cycle 25A; CDK4, cyclin dependent kinase 4; CDK6,
  cyclin dependent kinase 6; CCND1, cyclin D1; CHEK1, checkpoint kinase 1; CHEK2,
