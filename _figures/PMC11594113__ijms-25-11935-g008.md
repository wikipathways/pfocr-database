caption: Schematic representation of metformin’s possible interaction with linsitinib.
  The most common pathway involves the activation of AMPK, which regulates energy
  metabolism by modulating complex 1 of the respiratory chain in mitochondria by changes
  in the AMP/ATP ratio, which inhibits Akt and mTOR. Metformin binds with IGF-1 and
  modulates pathways involved in tumor progression. Upon binding, metformin inhibits
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/ERK pathways, leading to reductions in cell proliferation,
  thereby causing tumor cell death. Metformin, through AMPK activation and mTOR inhibition,
  could increase glucose uptake and glycolysis and have better efficiency in low-glucose
  media. The arrows ↑ ↓ indicate upregulation and downregulation, respectively. The
  drug linsitinib blocks IGF-1R (represented by the red *), which helps to block the
  IGF-1 signaling pathway. ADP—adenosine diphosphate; Akt—Ak strain transforming;
