caption: Mechanisms of TRPV4 channels in osteoarthritis. Inflammatory factors such
  as IL-1β and TNF-α can promote TRPV4 channel opening; this causes a large influx
  of Ca2+ into the cell. Activation of TRPV4 channels promotes the expressions of
  Sox9, ACAN, and COL-II through the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) signaling pathway; this
  promotes chondrocyte formation and differentiation. However, the activation of TRPV4
  channels leads to the release of inflammatory mediators (MMPs, IL-1β, IL-6, and
  TNF-α), contributing to the development and persistence of joint pain and inflammation.
