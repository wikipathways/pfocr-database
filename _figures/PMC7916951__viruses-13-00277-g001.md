caption: 'Multiple intracellular pathways triggered by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein–Barr
  virus (EBV) infection converge on expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type
  I Interferon (IFN) response genes. (1) CMV glycoproteins B and H (gB/gH) engage
  surface TLR-2 and trigger an inflammatory pathway leading to AP-1 activation; (2)
  cytosolic CMV-DNA interacts with cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and initiates a
  cascade that targets NFkB and IRF3; (3) CMV nuclear material trafficked to the endosome
  triggers TLR-7 signaling, leading to IRF-3, -5 and -7 activation; (4) in EBV latency
  phase, LMP1 induces expression of IR-5, -7 and NFkB; (5) cytosolic EBER-1 is recognised
  by RIG-1 and MDA-5 and associates with IPS-1 via CARD-like domains, leading to NFkB
  and IRF3 activation; (6) EBV induces IRF2 and activates ISRE, which codes for EBNA
  proteins. Legend: MyD88: Myeloid differentiation primary response 88, IKK complex:
  IkB kinase complex, TRAF: TNF receptor associated factor, AP-1: activator protein-1,
  EBER-1: EBV-encoded RNA-1; ER: endoplasmic reticulum, cGAS: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase,
