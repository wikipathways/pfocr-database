caption: Schematic representation of the innate and adaptative immune systems. The
  innate immune system encompasses neutrophils, eosinophils, antigen-presenting cells
  (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), and natural killer (NK) cells.
  Activation of the innate immune system is achievable through the recognition of
  soluble pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) by pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs), such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), on innate immune cells. TLR-ligand
  binding induces downstream signaling pathway activation, which ultimately leads
  to the production of proinflammatory cytokines. APCs constitute the bridge between
  the innate and adaptive immune systems. APCs activate T cells through the binding
  of CD40 with the CD40 ligand, major histocompatibility class (MHC) II binding with
  the T cell receptor, and cytokine-specific receptor stimulation. T cell differentiation
  is ultimately regulated by the nature of the given cytokine. The figure was partly
