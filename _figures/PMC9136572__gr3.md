caption: BAs and other relevant lipids serve as DAMPs and direct inflammatory triggers.
  BAs (such as DCA and CDCA) are metabolic DAMPs that can activate both signal 1 and
  2 of the NLRP3 inflammasome and thereby promoting the secretion of IL-1β, and at
  high levels, BAs can further open the mitochondrial permeability transition pore
  and facilitates a very fast pryoprototic death of immune cells. In contrast, some
  BA species like LCA can also repress NLRP3 inflammasome via activation of TGR5 signals
  through the cAMP–NF-κB signaling pathway, and can decrease oxidized LDL uptake in
  macrophages and thereby protecting against on atherosclerotic plaque. Cholesterol
  crystal (CC) and oxLDL, both of which are regulated by BA signals, are also important
  DAMPs in activating NLRP3 inflammasome. CC causes lysosomal damage, and thereby
  activating NLRP3 inflammasome; CC also activate the complement system, which promotes
  macrophage priming (signal 1) as well as CC phagocytosis and hence, NLRP3 activation.
  Besides, BAs associated metabolites such as ox-LDL, palmitic acid and saturated
  fatty acid (SFA) contribute to the pro-inflammation of macrophages through TLR2/4
  mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
