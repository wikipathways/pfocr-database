caption: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) inhibits tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF) through the Wnt pathway in a paracrine and autocrine manner. Wnt5, Wnt6, and
  pro-inflammatory cytokines are induced in macrophages in response to mycobacterial
  infection. Secreted Wnt5 and Wnt6 are recognized by FZD receptors expressed on the
  cell surface of neighboring macrophages, impairing TNF and IL-12 expression. Additionally,
  TNF released by the M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages promotes FZD1 expression
  in neighboring macrophages, rendering them susceptible to Wnt3 actions, which inhibits
  TNF expression.
