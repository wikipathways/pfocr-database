caption: Schematic representation of putative metabolic pathways of plant 14-3-3 genes
  involved in abiotic stresses. (A) Metabolic pathway through ABA-dependent signaling
  pathway. (B) Metabolic pathway through ROS-mediated MAPK cascade signaling pathway.
  PYL, Pyrabactin resistance 1-like family; PP2C, type 2C protein phosphatase; SnRK2,
  Snf1-related protein kinase 2; ABF, ABRE-binding factor; AREB, ABRE-binding proteins;
  bZIP, Basic region/leucine zipper motif (bZIP) transcription factor; AP2, APETALA
  2; VP1, Abscisic acid-VIVIPAROUS1; ABRE, ABA-responsive element; RBOH, Respiratory
  burst oxidase homolog; MAPK, Mitogen activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase;
  MAPKKK, MAPKK kinase; MYB, myeloblastosis family of transcription factor. Positive
  regulators are shown in sky-blue, negative regulators are shown in red, signal molecules
  are shown in yellow.
