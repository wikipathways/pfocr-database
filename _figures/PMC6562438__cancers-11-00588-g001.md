caption: Schematic overview of pathways that are involved in desmoplasia in pancreatic
  cancer, including drugs and their targets. The vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) pathway is activated through ligand binding to any of the three receptors.
  Downstream of these receptors are both the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) and
  the Ras/Mek pathway. Anti-angiogenic treatment works through ligand binding or receptor
  blocking. Hyaluronic acid is a component of the extracellular matrix and is involved
  in cell proliferation through the cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) receptor.
  Hedgehog is secreted by the stroma and binds to the Patched (PTCH) receptor, which
  activates the smoothened receptor and, through Glioma-Associated Oncogene (GLI)
  cell proliferation and survival, is activated.
