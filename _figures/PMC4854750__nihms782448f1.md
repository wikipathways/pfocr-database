caption: Heirarchical model of the PCP signaling pathway. The pathway consists of
  three modules, the global, core, and tissue specific effector modules. According
  to the series model, the global module provides directional input to the core module
  (blue arrow) that establishes and amplifies subcellular asymmetry. This subcellular
  asymmetry is used to direct tissue specific effector module function within the
  cell. According to the parallel model, the global module communicates directly with
  the tissue specific effector module (green dashed arrow), without signaling to the
  core module. Directional information for the global module comes from tissue level
  expression gradients of Ds and Fj, but it is likely that other gradients are also
  important, at least in the wing (black dashed arrow). While Wnt proteins seem not
  to play a direct role in PCP signaling in Drosophila, they appear to do so in vertebrates
  (grey dashed arrows). Precisely how Wnt’s affect vertebrate PCP is unclear. Asymmetrically
  segregated core PCP proteins are shown. Various effector modules produce different
  tissue specific responses. Here, effectors establish the distal location for growth
  of a prehair, as on the wing and abdomen.
