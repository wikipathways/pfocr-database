caption: CD30 mediates its effects through a number of diverse signaling pathways,
  which in concert confer a survival benefit to the cells on which CD30 is upregulated.
  Stimulation of the CD30 molecule results in trimerization and signal mediation through
  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated proteins (TRAF), in particular TRAF2,
  but also TRAF1 and TRAF5, to stimulate the nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) pathway.
  In addition to this, CD30 ligation also signals through the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathways, including ERK1 and ERK2, which have diverse anti-apoptotic
  and pro-survival benefits in the neoplastic cell. There appears to be a positive
  feedback loop between the MAPK/ERK pathway and the nuclear transcription factor
  JunB, which not only contributes to cell survival, but also upregulates CD30 expression.
