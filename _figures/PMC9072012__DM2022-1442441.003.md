caption: Intracellular functions of β-catenin. β-Catenin as adherent junction protein
  is (together with γ-catenin) attached to cadherin via δ-1 catenin or p120 protein,
  both are also attached to α-catenin, which is connected to the actin filaments of
  cytoskeleton. Intracellular function of Wnt/β-catenin pathway is shown in the presence
  and absence of Wnt ligand. (a) In the absence of Wnt ligand, β-catenin is phosphorylated
  by the destruction complex containing axin, adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC),
  glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β), and casein kinase 1α (CK1α), ubiquitinated
  by F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 1A (β-TrCP or Fbxw1), and targeted for proteasomal
  degradation. In the absence of β-catenin, the transcription complex T cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor family LEF/TCF remains repressed. (b) When Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled
  (Fzd) receptors and lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) coreceptors the latter
  being responsible for recruiting dishevelled (Dvl) polymers which inactivate the
  destruction complex leading to the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytosol. β-Catenin
  is translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus where it forms and active complex
  with LEF/TCF proteins and other histone modifying coactivators∗∗ leading to transcription
  of multiple genes, involved in the process of cell maturation and proliferation
  [].
