caption: 'Heterochromatin undergoes local changes that facilitate DSB repair. Chromatin
  remodeling and relaxation are orchestrated by chromatin modifiers, including Kap1
  and HELLS in human cells, and Kdm4A in Drosophila. Histone modifications occurring
  in heterochromatin include: i) phosphorylation of H2A variants by checkpoint kinases,
  including the heterochromatin-specific H2A.W.7 variant in Arabidopsis; and ii) increased
  H3K9me1 and H3K56me1. H1 histone loss occurs in response to 405 nm or UV-laser treatments,
  and might similarly promote DSB repair. HP1 reduction at the repair sites could
  also facilitate chromatin loosening and repair progression. These local changes
  might facilitate HR repair by promoting the recruitment of repair factors, affecting
  repair pathway choice, and increasing dynamics, thus promoting repair progression.'
