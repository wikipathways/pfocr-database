caption: Diagram of the mechanisms involved with the TAN-dopamine release interactions.
  Thalamic or cortical excitation leads to membrane depolarization in TANs. In response
  to depolarization, calcium ions enter through voltage dependent calcium channels,
  and the slow after-hyperpolarization current (IsAHP) is activated via the efflux
  of potassium ions through calcium dependent potassium channels. Once the cortical/thalamic
  excitatory input ends, the efflux of potassium ions causes the membrane to hyperpolarize,
  which in turn activates the inward dopamine-dependent h-current (Ih) that increases
  the membrane potential. Furthermore, dopamine (DA) from dopaminergic neurons (DANs)
  in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) binds to D2 receptors on TANs, downregulating
  the h-current. In concert, TANs produce acetylcholine (ACh), which binds to nicotinic
  acetylcholine (nACh) receptors on DAN axonal terminals. This cholinergic pathway
  enables TANs to modulate the release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft. Importantly—since
  the h-current is downregulated via activation of dopamine D2 receptors—the DA concentration
  affects the refractory period of TANs.
