caption: The first module identified by iMCMC in the ovarian carcinoma data and locations
  of the detected genes in known pathways. (A) All pairs of genes in this module are
  highly mutually exclusive with values more than 0.90. (B) The detected genes MYC
  and CCNE1 are in the cell cycle pathway. The dense dashed line represents pair of
  genes with exclusivity more than 0.90 and correlation larger than 0.20. RAD52 plays
  a central role in genetic recombination and DNA repair, and is not only highly exclusive
  but also correlated with MYC and CCNE1.
