  like receptor (TLR) signaling and recruit caspase (CASP) 4 and 5 or CASP1 via inflammasomes,
  including NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing (NLRP) 3. Caspase-driven cleavage
  of gasdermin D induces membrane rupture and pyroptosis. Necroptosis—DNA or RNA fragments
  are recognized by Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP) 1 or TLR, which signal via receptor-interacting
  protein kinase (RIPK) 1. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling through TNF receptor
  (TNFR) 1 also involves RIPK1. ZBP1 or RIPK1 activates RIPK3, resulting in recruitment
  and phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase-domain-like (MLKL), which ultimately
  induces pore formation and necroptosis. Apoptosis—lymphocytes, natural killer (NK)
  cells, or DNA damage (via p53) induce B cell lymphoma (BCL) 2 associated X apoptosis
  regulator (BAX) or BCL2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK). BAX and BAK permeabilize
  the mitochondrial membrane and consecutively released cytochrome C (CytC) binds
  to apoptotic protease activating factor (APAF) 1, thus forming the apoptosome which
  activates CASP9. CASP9 activates CASP3 and 7, thereby inducing apoptosis (intrinsic
  pathway). Inflammatory cells may also directly activate CASP 3 and 7. In an extrinsic
  apoptosis pathway, first apoptosis signal ligand (FASL) is recruited by immune cells
  or Fos proto-oncogene (FOS) and activates CASP8 via FAS-associated death domain
  (FADD). CASP8 then activates CASP 3 and 7. All three processes are closely interacting
  and are additionally regulated by numerous anti-apoptotic, anti-pyroptotic, and
  anti-necroptotic proteins not listed here. ├ inhibit / downregulate; ← activate
