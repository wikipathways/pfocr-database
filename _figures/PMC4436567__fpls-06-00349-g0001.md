caption: 'Effectors interfering with salicylic acid biosynthetic pathway. In plants,
  salicylic acid (SA) is mainly produced via the isochorismate pathway (IC) in plastids
  (green compartment), but can also be synthesized through phenylalanine ammonia-lyase
  (PAL) pathway in the cytosol. HopI1 in P. syringae interacts with plastidic HSP70
  (green), probably affecting SA biosynthesis or transport. Secreted Cmu1 from U.
  maydis is taken up by plant cells and is proposed to rechannel chorismic acid from
  plastids to the cytosol, thus lowering SA levels. The oomycete P. sojae and the
  fungus V. dahliae secrete isochorismatases PsIsc1 and VdIsc1, respectively, converting
  isochorismate into 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DDHB) and pyruvate. A fungal
  hypha is indicated in light pink in the lower part. This hypha is surrounded by
  the apoplast shown enlarged here (light gray) encased by the plant plasma membrane
  (green). Salicylate hydroxylase Shy1 (light blue) residing in the cytosol of U.
  maydis, can degrade SA. Enzymes are abbreviated: chorismate mutase (CM), isochorismate
  synthase (ICS). Fungal and oomycete effectors are indicated by pink ovals and bacterial
  effectors are indicated in dark yellow. Plant proteins are indicated by a green
  square. Solid arrows represent chemical reactions, dotted arrows indicate indirect
  inhibition and blunt ended arrows indicate inhibition (for details, see text).'
