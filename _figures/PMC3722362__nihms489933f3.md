caption: Basal HAMP expression depends upon signaling by interaction between BMPs,
  BMPRs through the downstream SMAD factors. HJV acts as a BMP co-receptor. HoloTF
  also induces HAMP expression through the same pathway. It has been proposed that
  the HFE/β2M/TFR2 and the BMP/BMPR/HJV complexes interact to synergistically increase
  HAMP expression through the SMAD factors. HAMP induction in inflammation results,
  at least in part, from the signaling of IL-6 through its receptor and STAT3. P53
  also activates HAMP transcription. Erythropoiesis represses HAMP transcription directly,
  by GDF15; indirectly, by hypoxia or by other unknown mechanisms. The question mark
  indicates that some of these pathways are not completely elucidated yet.
