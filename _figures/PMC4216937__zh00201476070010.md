caption: 'The MRIP-βcap73 complex governs pericyte contractile phenotype. Left: in
  normal pericytes, MRIP directly binds MLCP and RhoA and indirectly interacts with
  ROCK. Through the novel MRIP-βcap73 interaction and the newly described βcap73-ROCK
  interaction, we propose a novel signaling complex, with MRIP and βcap73 mediating
  the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, which ultimately regulates MLCP activity and pericyte
  contractility. It is likely that there are subdomains containing the 1) novel MRIP-βcap73
  complex, 2) MRIP and MLCP, and 3) myosin light chain (MLC) kinase (MLCK), all working
  toward maintaining a balance of MLC-phosphorylated (P) MLC levels, which results
  in basal pericyte tonus. The pericyte, with normal mechanical stiffness, then relays
  signals to the underlying EC to maintain quiescence (growth arrest, blue nucleus).
  Right: upon MRIP silencing, MLCP is no longer stress fiber-associated. These events
  give rise to a diminution of MLC dephosphorylation; MLCK and ROCK phosphorylate
  MLC without MLCP opposition, which gives rise to the hypertrophic state; MRIP-silenced
  and hypercontractile pericytes cannot sustain contact-dependent EC growth arrest.
  In turn, EC enter the S phase (pink nuclei), “priming” microvascular growth and
  angiogenic activation.'
