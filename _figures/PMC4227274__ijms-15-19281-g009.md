caption: 'The cellular defense mechanisms induced by IPNV infection in CHSE-214 cells.
  After IPNV infection, two cellular defense mechanisms are induced: One is the apoptosis
  pathway, the other is the interferon pathway. Apoptosis is induced in some CHSE-214
  cells via the caspase pathway and the transfer of PS from the inner to the outer
  cellular membrane. The exposed PS acts as an engulfment signal to induce PSR in
  neighboring cells via IRF-1 regulation. PSR is located on the surface of the neighboring
  cell and recognizes the exposed PS on the apoptotic cell. PSR-PS binding promotes
  the clearance of the apoptotic cell and inhibits viral replication to promote anti-viral
  effects. The up and down red arrows indicate the genes which were up-regulated or
  down-regulated by IPNV infection respectively.'
