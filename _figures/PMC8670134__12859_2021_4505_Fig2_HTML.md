caption: 'Biological implication of subnetworks in the context of pathway. A Subnetworks
  from TCGA-LUAD (TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma) are mapped to the RAS pathway. Genes colored
  in red are present in the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census. Blue oval: genes in KRAS-SHC3;
  Red oval: genes in BRCA2-FANCA. B Subnetworks from TCGA-BRCA (TCGA Breast Invasive
  Carcinoma) are mapped to the RAS pathway and associated with survival. Red oval:
  genes in ERBB2-FGFR2; Blue oval: genes in BRAF-SCRIB; Yellow oval: genes in BRCA2-FANCA.
  P-values are combined p-values from gene-pair fisher’s tests. The KM-plot of survival
  analysis is obtained from the comparison of mutated vs. non-mutated samples for
  four genes in the subnetwork ERBB2-FGFR2. Coxph p-values adjusted by sex and age
  for both single gene and a group by subnetwork genes are shown in the table'
