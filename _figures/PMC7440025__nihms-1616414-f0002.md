caption: 'TRIM proteins employ at least three major antiviral mechanisms: (i) modulation
  of autophagy, a cell-intrinsic autodigestive pathway that limits the replication
  of certain viruses; (ii) regulation of cytokine induction and cytokine-mediated
  antiviral innate immune responses; and (iii) direct targeting of viral components,
  which triggers their degradation or inhibits their functions in key steps of the
  viral lifecycle. Of note, while some TRIM proteins utilize one of the three antiviral
  mechanisms, several TRIMs exert immunomodulatory functions and also directly antagonize
  viral pathogens. Exemplary TRIM proteins involved in specific steps of the antiviral
  response are indicated. RBCC, RING-BBox-coiled-coil motif.'
