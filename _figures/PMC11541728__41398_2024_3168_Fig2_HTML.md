caption: SRC family of kinases regulate EphR signalling through phosphorylation. Once
  active, the EphRs then modulate the activity of the Rho family of GTPases. EphRs
  modulate the switch between inactive (GDP) and active (GTP) confirmations of the
  Rho family, or EphRs can cause reversion of the GTP state back to GDP. Influencing
  cell behaviour, shape, and movement is important for cell migration, axon guidance,
  synaptic plasticity, tissue morphogenesis, and cancer metastasis. Figure made with
