caption: Incubation of tumor cells with PI-103 for 24 h prior to IR (A, C) leads to
  a reactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway at the time of IR, most likely due to
  the inhibition of the negative feedback loop mediated by ribosomal protein S6. Subsequently,
  the activated pro-survival kinase AKT prevents radiation induced apoptosis. Beside
  this, 30 min after IR we observed the up-regulation of p-ERK1/2 and p-MEK in 3 out
  of 4 cell lines in the presence of PI-103 used under Schedule I, especially after
  IR. Raf-1 and p-MEK can be also inhibited through the negative feedback loop mediated
  by p-ERK []. Besides this, the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL was moderately
  increased. In contrast, after a short, 3-h incubation with the PI-103, p-AKT is
  strongly suppressed at the time of IR (B, D), which can affect subsequent cell survival.
  Furthermore, incubation with PI-103 for 24 h (A, C) causes a remarkable arrest in
  the G1-phase. In contrast, cells treated with PI-103 according Schedule II (B, D)
  showed a strong G2/M arrest 24 h after IR. Under Schedule II, drug-treated and irradiated
  cells showed a delayed DNA damage repair response (Figure  and ). To summarize,
  long-term pre-incubation with PI-103 (A, C) causes no radiosensitization by the
  substance itself and no enhancement of the radiosensitizing effect of NVP-AUY922
  (C). In contrast, a short-term pretreatment with PI-103 (B, D) gives rise to a radiosensitization
  effect by PI-103 alone and in combination with NVP-AUY922 (D). (Take note of the
  size of the letters/symbols and the thickness of the lines). For details, see text.
