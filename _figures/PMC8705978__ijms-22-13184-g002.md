caption: Sphingolipid metabolic network. Ceramide is biosynthesized from amino acid
  and fatty acid via four steps. It can be degraded in the catabolic pathway into
  non-lipid products. Meanwhile, ceramide can be converted into complex sphingolipids,
  such as sphingomyelin, glycoceramides, acylceramide and ceramide 1-phosphate, in
  a reversible fashion. The majority of ceramide is converted into sphingomyelin,
  the most abundant sphingolipid species, which is replied on CERT-mediated endoplasmic
  reticulum to Golgi ceramide transport.
