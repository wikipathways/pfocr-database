caption: Schematic diagram of FA and glucose metabolism in the heart. FA enter cardiomyocytes
  either through diffusion or transport proteins such as FA translocase (CD36) and
  FA transport protein (FATP). CoA synthetase (FACS) converts FA into fatty acyl CoA.
  Fatty acyl CoA can either be esterified into lipid intermediates such as TAG or
  be converted to acylcarnitine via carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). A majority
  of the fatty acyl CoA enters the β‐oxidation pathway which eventually leads to the
  production of ATP. Glucose enters the cardiomyocytes through GLUT‐family transporters.
  Glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase II to produce glucose‐6‐phosphate (G6P),
  fructose 6‐phosphate (F6P), fructose 1, 6‐bisphosphate (F‐1,6‐P), glyceraldehyde
  3‐phsophate (GAP), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), 1,3‐bisphosphoglycerate (1,3‐BPG),
  3‐phosphoglycerate (3‐PG), 2‐phosphoglycerate (2‐PG), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).
  Pyruvate then enters the mitochondria via mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC),
  where it is converted to acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHK), (Depre et
  al., ) or converted to oxaloacetate (OAA) by mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase
  (PC). During starvation or diabetic conditions OAA can be converted back to phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) by mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK‐M). Acetyl CoA then
  enters the TCA cycle generating reducing equivalents and ATP (Amaral & Okonko, ;
  Depre et al., ; Jitrapakdee et al., ; Fillmore & Lopaschuk, ; Aerni‐Flessner et
  al., ; Longo et al., ; Lopaschuk et al., ; Berg et al., ).
