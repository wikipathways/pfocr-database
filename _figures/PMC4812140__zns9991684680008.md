caption: Possible pathways for ABCA7-related LOAD pathogenesis. ABCA7 dysfunctions
  likely facilitate Aβ production in neurons by activating the SREBP2-BACE1 pathway
  directly and/or by modifying the brain lipid profile indirectly. Furthermore, ER
  stress is also induced by ABCA7 loss of function in neurons, which activates the
  PERK-eIF2α pathway, causing cognitive declines and further activation of the SREBP2-BACE1
  pathway. Excessive activation of the ERK signaling pathway caused by ABCA7 dysfunctions
  may also contribute directly to AD pathogenesis.
