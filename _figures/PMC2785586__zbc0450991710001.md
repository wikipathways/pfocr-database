caption: UFA synthesis in E. coli. Panel A shows the reactions catalyzed by FabA and
  the proposed step catalyzed by FabB. Panel B shows the carbon flow in the UFA pathway.
  The arrows between each intermediate denote in order the 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase
  (fabB or FabF), 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG), the 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase
  (FabZ), and the enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI). The first and last arrows denote irreversible
  reactions. The 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase is truly irreversible due to decarboxylation,
  whereas FabI is reversible but the equilibrium lies very strongly in favor of reduction
  of the trans-2 double bond (). The FabG and FabZ reactions are freely reversible
  ().
