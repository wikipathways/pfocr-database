caption: A working model for the Wnt, TGF-β, and Pax6 signalling in the regulation
  of ciliary body development. From embryonic to postnatal stages, the Wnt signalling
  pathway is mainly involved in cell differentiation and cell maturation in the ciliary
  body. The TGF-β and Bmp4 signalling pathways principally contribute to fate specification
  and morphological folding. However, the specific regulatory mechanism of Pax6 on
  TGF-β and Bmp4 is currently unclear
