caption: Potential mechanisms proposed for the AS-IV action in animal models of cardiovascular
  disorders.Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) reduced the synthesis of the ECM and promoted
  its degradation which led to ameliorated myocardial fibrosis. The reduced level
  of carboxy-terminal propeptide of procollagen type I (I-CTP), procollagen type III
  aminoterminal peptide (PIIINP), carboxy-terminal propeptide of procollagen type
  I (PICP), the ratio of PICP/N-terminal type I procollagen propeptide (PINP) and
  collagen I showed that the synthesis of the ECM was inhibited. AS-IV could also
  reduce the synthesis of ECM via transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1)/Smads signaling
  pathway. While the increased concentration of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and
  tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TMP) contributed to promoted ECM degradation.
  AS-IV also ameliorated myocardial fibrosis by inhibiting the expression of inflammation-related
  indicators which was partially achieved by the attenuation of nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain-like receptor with a pyrin domain 3(NLRP3), Caspase-1, tumor
  necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), IL-18, IL-6 and IL-1. The antioxidant effect of AS-IV
  was expressed by the reduced level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the enhanced activity
  of superoxide dismutase (SOD), which resulted in a reduced level of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). Inhibition of ROS and ROS/Caspase-1/Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) signaling
  pathway could also alleviate myocardial fibrosis. For cardiomyocytes, AS-IV inhibited
  the apoptosis and pyroptosis of them. The expression of pro-apoptotic genes including
  FAS, FASL, cleaved caspase-8, and cleaved caspase-3 were reduced by AS-IV. Long-chain
  acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) and 6-phosphofructokinase-1(PFK1) play important roles
  in the fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis processes, respectively. AS-IV normalized
  the energy metabolism of cardiomyocytes by enhancing the activity of LCAD and inhibition
  of PFK1. After being treated by AS-IV, the expression of endothelial cell marker
  CD31 was increased, and the mesenchymal marker α-SMA was down-regulated, which showed
  that AS-IV inhibited endothelial cells from transforming into mesenchymal cells
  (EMT). Furthermore, AS-IV could regulate gut microbes and senescence, which contributed
  to ameliorating myocardial fibrosis. Figure 2 was drawn by the authors
