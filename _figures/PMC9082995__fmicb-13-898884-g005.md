caption: Changes in transcript levels of the protein synthesis process. The (A) RNA
  transport, (B) Ribosome and (C) Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis pathway belong to the translation
  gene set, the (D) protein translocation, and (E) protein processing and (F) protein
  degradation pathway belong to the folding, sorting and degradation gene set. Among
  the six pathways, the up- and down-regulated pathways are marked with red and blue
  arrows, respectively. The boxes indicate fold-change in gene expression of YlΔA1-FAR
  compared to WT-FAR control. Red boxes indicate upregulated gene expression, and
  blue boxes indicate downregulation gene expression (p < 0.05).
