caption: 'The 257 metabolic pathways of Neurospora are divided into the 35 color-coded
  pathway classes. Biosynthetic pathways are displayed on the left, energy metabolism
  in the center, and degradation pathways are on the right. In addition to the cytosol
  and extracellular space, the model also contains 4 organelles: these are the vacuole,
  the nucleus, and the mitochondrion. The 299 transport reactions enable uptake and
  excretion of 137 metabolites and also exchange between the cytosol and each organelle.'
