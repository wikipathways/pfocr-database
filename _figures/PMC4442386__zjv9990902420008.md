caption: Model for the overall disruption of IFN responses by SFTSV through NSs hijacking
  of signaling proteins in IBs. Type I IFN response is initiated by the recognition
  of viral infection by PRRs, followed by the recruitment and activation of crucial
  kinases, such as TBK1/IKKε. The kinases then activate transcription factors, including
  IRF3, leading to the IFN induction. Secreted IFNs bind to their receptors (IFNARs)
  on the cell surface, initiating JAK-STAT signaling and mounting expression of antiviral
  ISGs. Both TBK1/IKKε in the IFN induction pathway and also STAT2/STAT1 in IFN signaling
  are sequestrated in viral IBs by SFTSV, resulting in an overall disruption of IFN
  responses. PM, plasma membrane.
