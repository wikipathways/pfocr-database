caption: The Toll pathway in fruit fly and the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 pathway
  in the mouse. (A) The Toll pathway in Drosophila melanogaster detects Gram-positive
  bacteria and fungi is activated through an endogenous ligand, namely Nerve Growth
  Factor-related cytokine Spaetzle (SPZ) which is processed by Spaetzle-processing
  enzyme (SPE). Toll receptor activation results in the recruitment of the adaptor
  proteins namely myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (dMyD88), Tube, and
  Pelle, which promotes signaling to Cactus and its ankyrin-repeat domains. Cactus
  is bound to the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factors dorsal-related
  immunity factor (DIF) and Dorsal and following activation of the pathway, it is
  phosphorylated and degraded. The above signaling events result in the nuclear translocation
  of DIF or Dorsal that stimulate the transcriptional upregulation of antimicrobial
  peptide (AMP) genes, such as Drosomycin. (B). TLR4 receptor in M. musculus detects
  lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria. Myeloid differentiation primary
  response 88 (MyD88) is recruited with Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases
  1 and 4 (IRAK1, IRAK4), receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), and tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 is self-ubiquitinated in
  order to recruit transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) activated kinase 1 (TAK1)
  and TAK1-associated binding proteins 1 and 2 (TAB1 and TAB2). The latter leads to
  the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex that in turns phosphorylates the
  inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB). This leads to the release of NF-κB that translocates to
  the nucleus and initiates the transcriptional induction of inflammatory and immune
  response related genes. This leads to the translocation of the NF-κB transcription
  factors p50 and p65 to the nucleus, which in turns initiates the transcriptional
  induction of inflammatory and immune response related genes.
