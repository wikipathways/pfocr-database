caption: Major mechanisms of immune modulation by tolerogenic DCs. DCs modulate the
  immune system by promoting Treg cell generation through various mechanisms. Upon
  stimulation, DCs are able to increase production of various cytokines and inflammatory
  mediators such as IL-10, RA, vitamin D, TGF-β, IL-2, IL-10, TSLP, TNF-α and down-regulate
  expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12p70. DCs, by down-regulating co-stimulation
  and antigen presentation, can favor induction of Treg cells. Various signaling pathways
  program DCs to induce tolerogenic responses. Activation of β-catenin signaling pathway
  promotes induction of anti-inflammatory factors such as vitamin A and is important
  for promoting Treg cell induction and limiting inflammatory responses. TSLPR signaling
  inhibits activation of STAT4 and IRF-8, factors critical for production of the Th1
  polarizing factor IL-12. Triggering of DCs through TLR2-6 leads to Erk activation
  which mediates induction of RALDH and conversion of retinal to RA. TLR9 ligation
  can drive induction of IDO in DCs limiting IL-6 production and differentiation of
  Th17 cells while inducing differentiation of Treg cells
