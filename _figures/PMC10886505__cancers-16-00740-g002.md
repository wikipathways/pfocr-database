caption: 'Photoactive properties of PpIX. PpIX is an extremely hydrophobic molecule
  that binds the plasma membrane and the mitochondrial membrane. Steps 1–3: PpIX absorbs
  energy from light and releases that energy as fluorescence in light of a longer
  wavelength than the activating light. Steps 4 through 6 demonstrate the photodynamic
  effect, in which higher energy PpIX transfers energy to molecular oxygen, creating
  singlet oxygen (ROS). When used for PDT, adjacent membrane lipid molecules in the
  plasma membrane or mitochondrial membrane are oxidized, creating cell death via
  membrane disruption, and programmed cell death (apoptosis) via mitochondrial membrane
  disruption, cytochrome c release, and activation of the caspase-3 pathway, respectively
