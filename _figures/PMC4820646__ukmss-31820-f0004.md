caption: The role of the BDNF-CREB cascade in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) – nucleus
  accumbens (NAc) pathway. Enhanced BDNF-CREB signalling in the NAc in animal models
  of stress and depression is associated with increased dynorphin expression. Dynorphin,
  through a feedback inhibitory loop, activates κ opioid receptors on VTA neurons
  and results in an inhibitory effect on the dopaminergic neurons projecting from
  the VTA to the NAc. Decreased activation of the VTA-NAc pathway is associated with
  the pro-depressive effects induced by overexpression of CREB-BDNF in this circuit.
