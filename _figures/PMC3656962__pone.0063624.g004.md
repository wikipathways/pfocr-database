caption: (A) The serotonin synthesis (5-HT) pathway and kynurenine pathway in tryptophan
  metabolism. The structure in blue indicates the compounds that were significantly
  changed in the CUMS group. (B) The results of Western blot analysis of DDC and IDO
  in the rat’s hippocampus. Each measure was performed with three replicates and was
  expressed as the mean ± SEM (*p<0.05, **p<0.01).
