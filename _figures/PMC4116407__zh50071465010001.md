caption: Flagellar motility is a key bacterial determinant for phagocytic susceptibility
  of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by both murine and human phagocytes, with motile bacteria
  phagocytosed ∼100-fold more efficiently than nonmotile bacteria (top). Although
  the cell surface phagocytic receptor(s) for P. aeruginosa require further elucidation,
  independent reports indicate that bacterial engulfment is actin dependent and controlled
  by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. P. aeruginosa has also been proposed to invade
  epithelial cells (bottom), particularly on the basolateral surfaces of these cells,
  through alterations in cell polarity and in breaches in the monolayer. Proposed
  mechanisms include invasion via cell surface lipid rafts in conjunction with the
  caveolin-2 protein, and via heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). The HSPG-mediated
  pathway is subsequently dependent on intracellular PI3K/Akt activity, and RhoA and/or
  Cdc42 activation. The relationship between the HSPG and lipid raft-mediated pathways
  is currently unclear.
