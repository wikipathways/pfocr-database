caption: Intracellular signaling pathways activated by guidance cues. Members of the
  Rho subfamily of small GTPases, which includes Rac, Rho, and Cdc42, have been well
  established to mediate the chemotropic responses of growth cones through controlling
  cytoskeletal dynamics (). Rac and Rho activate LIM kinase (LIMK) through PAK and
  ROCK, and LIMK regulates the cofilin-mediated actin depolymerization. The mTOR pathway
  is also activated by several cue-induced responses through the PI3K and/or MAPKs
  pathways. mTOR regulates mRNA translation through phosphorylation of downstream
  targets (; ; ). Cue-induced local mRNA translation modulates other guidance pathways
  through the spatiotemporal up-regulation of signaling components such as Rho A and
  cofilin (; ). Arrows do not necessarily indicate direct interactions. Cue, guidance
  cue; Receptor, guidance cue receptor.
