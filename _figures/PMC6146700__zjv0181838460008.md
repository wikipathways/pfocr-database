caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanism by which HIV-1 Vpr promotes KSHV
  latency and cytokine production. In addition to upregulation of cellular miR-942-5p,
  which targets IκBα to activate NF-κB pathway, soluble Vpr also upregulates miR-711,
  which targets Notch1 3′UTR, to inactivate Notch signaling following internalization
  into PEL cells. Vpr inhibition of Notch1 leads to less cleavage of Notch1 into the
  intracellular domain (ICN), which subsequently translocates into the nucleus and
  is incapable of driving IκBα gene transcription and therefore will increase the
  basal NF-κB activity. The outcomes of Vpr-activated NF-κB signaling, whether by
  the miR-711/Notch axis or miR-942-5p/IκBα axis, result in inhibition of the KSHV
  lytic replication program and induction of cytokines.
