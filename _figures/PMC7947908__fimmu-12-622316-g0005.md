caption: The role of circRNA in the pathophysiological process of RA (a) In synovial
  cells of patients with RA, hsa-circ-U0001045 competitively binds miR-30a, resulting
  in the overexpression of beclin-1 and LC3, promoting autophagy and the development
  and progression of RA. The downregulation of mir-671 resulted in the upregulation
  of CIRS-7, thereby reducing the inhibition of mir-7 on mTOR and affecting the pathophysiological
  process of RA through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. (b) In patients with
  RA, EBV, bacteria, and other infectious factors enter the body, and its oligosaccharides,
  lipopeptide fragments, and other components are absorbed by synovium cells to form
  new proteoglycan, change the structure of IgG, and promote the body to produce a
  specific antibodies-rheumatoid factor. IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE can combine with the
  RF to form immune complexes, which can be deposited in joints or local tissues,
  activate the complement, and produce C3a and C5a, prompting neutrophils and monocytes
  to englobe RF-IgG and other immune complexes, synthesize, and release lysosomal
  enzymes and IL-1 and other mediators, thereby causing the occurrence of RA.
