caption: 'A schematic diagram of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signal transduction
  and main downstream effects. Both IGF-1 and IGF-2 could bind with plasma membrane
  IGF-1R and IGF-1/Insulin hybrid receptor leading to autophosphorylation of this
  target receptor in the intracellular β-subunits and thus triggering the catalytic
  function of the IGF-1R, while insulin binds only to the Insulin-R. IGFBPs could
  regulate the bioavailability of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 signaling cascades. The bioavailability
  of IGF-2 could also be regulated via binding to the IGF-2R which results in receptor-triggered
  internalization and endosomal degradation of IGF-2 in the lysosomes. Phosphorylated
  β-subunits could in turn create docking sites for the adaptor proteins IRS-1/2,
  and Shc that modulate the activation of two signaling pathways: PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK.
  Activation of the PI3K and AKT pathway leads to modulation of a variety of cell
  signaling cascades, such as regulation of TSC1/2 to suppress mTORC1 complex and
  modulation of 4EB-P1 and S6K1/2 phosphorylation, promoting cell survival via activation
  or suppression of major effectors like the Foxo transcription factors, BCL-2, BAD,
  and P27, upregulation of transformation of glucose to glycogen through suppression
  of GSK-3β, increasing protein synthesis, as well as suppressing apoptosis and autophagy.
  Activation of AKT family of kinases via PDK1 and mTORC2 leads to the phosphorylation
  at Thr308 and Ser473, respectively. Besides, docking of Grb2 to the phosphorylated
  IGF-1R β subunits could trigger the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK axis. Shc binding to activated
  IGF-1R leads to stimulation of the MAPK/ERK cascade which regulates a kinase signaling
  pathway and eventually results in promoting cellular proliferation via enhancing
  transcription factors activities including ELK1.'
