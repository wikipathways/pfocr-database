caption: SYK as a master regulator of apoptosis in MM TME. The receptor tyrosine kinase
  ROR2 is the receptor for WNT5A, a growth factor that is abundantly expressed in
  the TME of MM patients. WNT5A–ROR2 interactions within the TME promote the adhesion
  of MM cells to the bone marrow niche and activate the anti-apoptotic SYK-PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway, which is critical for the survival of MM cells []. Multiple anti-apoptotic
  signaling molecules and pathways linked to NFκB, PI3-K/AKT, and STAT3 are regulated
  by SYK. See text for detailed discussion.
