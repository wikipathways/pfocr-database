caption: NPR1-mediated signaling pathway in Cymbidium orchid. Stress and phytohormones
  are represented by ellipses; genes are represented by rectangles; and lines before
  rectangles represent the transcriptional regulatory regions. Lines with an arrow
  represent the promotion of mRNA transcript, and those with a perpendicular bar represent
  repression. Red lines indicate the regulation or transportation demonstrated in
  this study.
