caption: The thick grey line in the middle provides an arbitrary boundary between
  the pathways. Anti-AIB1 immunoprecipitated (AIB1-IPed) and anti-pY-immunoprecipitated
  proteins (pY-IPed) are indicated by red or green circles respectively (keys at the
  bottom). The blue circled proteins are AIB1-IPed proteins from MCF-7 (CALM1) or
  MCF-7:5C cells (β-catenin) under both E2-treated and untreated conditions; the purple
  circled one (ITPR3) is an AIB1-IPed protein from both cells only under E2 treated
  condition, while the yellow circled one (TYK2) is an AIB1-IPed protein from both
  cells under both E2 treated and untreated conditions. Proteins circled in grey are
  from known canonical pathways (e.g. ERK in cell growth or BAD in apoptosis) but
  not identified here. Solid line arrows indicate direct interactions (e.g. CDK1 phosphorylates
  Rap1GAP) or translocations (e.g. catenins) of proteins, while dashed arrows indicate
  indirect actions of proteins (e.g. AKT activate MEK through several steps). Hammer-ended
  lines indicate inhibitory effects on the target. Detailled pathways are shown in
  , , , .
