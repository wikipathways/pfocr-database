caption: The toxic mechanisms of AFs-induced hepatotoxicity. AFs damage mitochondrial
  respiratory function through modifying mtDNA and mitochondrial respiratory complexes
  I-IV, which generates ROS and extensive oxidative stress. Comparatively speaking,
  AFs destroy Keap1/Nrf2/ARE antioxidant pathway to amplify oxidative stress of hepatocytes
  further. On the other hand, AFs damage the structure of mitochondria through regulating
  Bax and opening mPTP. AFs induce the translocation of Bax to mitochondria through
  regulating Bcl-2 family proteins and p53 to generate lipid pores within OMM thereby
  damaging the structure of mitochondria. And damaged mitochondria initiate mitophagy
  by COX-2. The AFs-induced opening of mPTP together with the translocation of Bax
  make mitochondria release contents such as cyt c. The activation of death receptor
  (extrinsic pathway) and released cyt c from damaged mitochondria (intrinsic pathway)
  induce apoptosis through activating caspase cascade reaction. Meanwhile, AFs alter
  ER localization of COX-2 by phosphatase PP2A-B55δ to promote NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation, furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome activates caspase-1 (induce pyroptosis
  of hepatocytes) and converts pro-IL-1β into mature form. AFs also activate NF-κB
  signaling pathway to secrete cytokines such as TNF and IL via TLR. Released DAMPs
  and cytokines from hepatocytes interact with KCs (liver innate immunocytes) that
  also have toxic effects for hepatocytes. The interaction between hepatocytes and
  KCs forms a vice feedback loop to exasperate local hepatic inflammatory microenvironment.
