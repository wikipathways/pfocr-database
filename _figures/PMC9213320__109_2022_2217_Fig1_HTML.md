caption: The role of RIPK1 in TNF signaling pathway. RIPK1 is a key upstream regulator
  at the crossroads of inflammation and cell death regulating NF-κB signaling pathway,
  apoptosis, and necroptosis. The recognition of TNF-α by TNFR1 receptor triggers
  the rapid assembly of a multiprotein complex known as complex I, which consists
  of adaptor proteins (e.g., TRADD, FADD, TAB), ubiquitin ligases (e.g., TRAF2, LUBAC,
  cIAPs), and kinases (e.g., TAK and RIPK1) []. In complex I, RIPK1 is ubiquitylated
  by cIAP1/2 (K63 or K11) [] and LUBAC (M1 linked linear Poly-Ub), thereby serving
  as an enzymatically inactive scaffold for the recruitment of TAK1 and NEMO, the
  regulatory subunit of the IKK complex. TAK1 is essential for IKKβ phosphorylation
  that leads to the phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and proteasomal degradation of
  the inhibitory protein IKBα, thereby allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus
  and drive the transcription of pro-survival genes. When the cellular environment
  favors the transition from a state of inflammation to death, the deubiquitylation
  of RIPK1 by CYLD, and its release from complex I promotes the formation of complex
  IIa (), which ultimately results in caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. When caspases
  or cIAPs are inhibited, RIPK1 associates with RIPK3 to form the necrosome (complex
  IIb), which in turn recruits the pseudokinase MLKL. RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation
  of MLKL results in MLKL translocation to the plasma membrane and pore formation,
  causing membrane permeabilization and ultimately leading to necroptosis. cIAPs,
  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins; CYLD, cylindromatosis; FADD, Fas associated
  death domain protein; IKK, IκB kinase; LUBAC, linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex;
  MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase; NEMO, NF-kappa-B essential
  modulator; RIPK, receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase; TAB, TAK1-binding
