caption: The JAK-STAT pathway. The figure and table shows which receptors, JAK and
  STAT subtypes certain cytokines bind to, highlighting proteins encoded by and/or
  affected by causal genes in seropositive RA, based on the multiomics analysis of
  sequence variants associated with risk of seropositive RA (shown in bold). Binding
  of a cytokine to its receptor activates the associated Janus kinases (JAK). The
  JAK in turn phosphorylates (P) the receptor, which provides a docking for signal
  transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and other signalling molecules
  to bind to the receptor. STATs also become phosphorylated and translocate to the
  nucleus, where they regulate gene expression. *Protein targeted by drugs that are
  registered for RA. **Proteins targeted by drugs registered or in pipeline for other
  diseases. RA, rheumatoid arthritis.
