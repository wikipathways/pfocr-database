caption: 'Schematic representation of labeling patterns in end products and pathway
  intermediates derived from the metabolism of [1-13C], [2-13C], and/or [3-13C]Glc
  in B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12. For the sake of simplicity, the metabolic pathway
  shown begins with two fructose molecules. The carbons of one fructose molecule are
  numbered in red, and the carbons of the second fructose molecule are numbered in
  black. These numbers allow the origin of carbon for each product formed in this
  metabolic pathway to be followed. The carbons highlighted with red originate from
  Glc labeled on carbon 1 ([1-13C]Glc), the blue carbons are from [2-13C]Glc, and
  the green carbons are from [3-13C]Glc. To determine the fate of carbon 1 on Glc,
  the products with carbons highlighted with red must be followed. To determine the
  fate of carbon 2 on Glc, the carbons highlighted with blue must be followed; similarly,
  the carbons highlighted with green trace the label originating from [3-13C]Glc.
  End products (and relevant pathway intermediates) derived from [1-13C]Glc, [2-13C]Glc,
  and [3-13C]Glc are boxed in red, blue, and green, respectively. The labeled end
  products from [1-13C]Glc are as follows: two [2-13C]acetate molecules, one [3-13C]lactate
  molecule, and one [2-13C]ethanol molecule. The labeled end products from [2-13C]Glc
  are as follows: two [1-13C]acetate molecules, one [2-13C]lactate molecule, and one
  [1-13C]ethanol molecule. The labeled end products from [3-13C]Glc are as follows:
  one [1,2-13C]acetate molecule, one [2,3-13C]lactate molecule, and one [1,2-13C]ethanol
  molecule. Dashed arrow, lower Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. For abbreviations,
