caption: Initiation of coagulation in DIC. Pathogens, dead cells, and their derived
  molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs and DAMPs) can signal through PRRs to induce
  TF expression and microparticle release from monocytes, and to promote synthesis
  of proinflammatory cytokines that further amplify TF expression, thus initiating
  coagulation via the extrinsic pathway. In parallel, contact activation with FXIIa
  generation can occur on the surface of the pathogens, PAMPs, DAMPs, and cell debris.
  In particular, bacteria-derived long-chain polyphosphates (LC-poly-Ps) and platelet-derived
  short-chain polyphosphates (SC-poly-P), and the extracellular nucleic acids (DNA/RNA)
  can induce contact-mediated autoactivation of FXII and trigger coagulation via the
  intrinsic pathway. Both pathways converge into the common coagulation mechanism,
  leading to thrombin generation and downstream platelet activation and fibrin and
  thrombus formation.
