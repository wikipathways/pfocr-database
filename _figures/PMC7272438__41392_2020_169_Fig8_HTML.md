caption: Proposed model for the involvement of miR-199a-3p and CAV2 in hepatic fibrosis.
  miR-199a-3p expression is induced by Twist1 via binding with the E-Box element of
  miR-199a-3p gene promoter and TGF-β treatment in HSCs. Consequently, increased miR-199a-3p
  inhibits CAV2 expression, which upregulates TGFβRI level and subsequently accelerates
  TGF-β signalling pathway, thereby promoting HSC activation
papertitle: Twist1-induced miR-199a-3p promotes liver fibrosis by suppressing caveolin-2
  and activating TGF-β pathway.
