caption: 'HIFs are involved in crucial aspects of tumor progression and metastasis
  in sarcomas. In the presence of oxygen, prolyl-hydroxylases (PDH) hydroxylate proline
  residues on HIFα subunit. Hydoxylated HIFα interacts with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)
  protein, which is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates the ubiquitination
  (Ub) of HIFα and targets it for proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxia, the α subunit
  is not hydroxylated. The stabilized α subunit moves into the nucleus, dimerizes
  with β subunit, and binds to hypoxia response elements (HRE) on target genes. HIFα
  is additionally up-regulated in a hypoxia-independent mechanism by several oncogenic
  pathways, including the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. A representative HIF-regulated gene
  is shown to illustrate the importance of HIF target genes in many aspects of cancer
  biology in sarcomas. HIF-target genes are involved in: metabolic reprogramming,
  which include glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1); induction of angiogenesis mediated
  by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); promoting cell survival by encoding
  insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2); enhance stem-cell self-renewal ability through
  expression of delta-like 1 (DLK-1); promote metastasis through regulation of extracellular
  matrix genes, such as collagen, type V, α1 (COL5A1); and chemotherapy resistance
  through expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter B1 (ABCB1) that efflux chemotherapy
  drugs from cancer cells. In addition, HIFs indirectly regulate gene and protein
  expression by transactivation of chromatin-modifying genes and microRNAs. As an
  example, HIF1α up-regulates EWS-FL1 onco-protein expression and modulates its transcriptional
  signature towards metastasis-related genes.'
