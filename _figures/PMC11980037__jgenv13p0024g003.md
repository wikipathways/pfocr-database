caption: KEGG disease pathways map analysis displays downregulated DEGs influenced
  by DEX-induced M2c macrophages involved in anti-allograft rejection. (A) The allograft
  rejection pathway mediates allograft destruction. (B) The antigen processing and
  presentation pathways mediate T cell and NK cell activation through the major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC). (C) The C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway mediates helper
  T cells differentiation. (D) The TNF signaling pathway mediates a number of critical
  cell functions, including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, inflammation,
  and apoptosis. The blue color indicates downregulated DEGs within the pathways.
  The green boxes represent the annotated protein found in KEGG database library.
  The white boxes are the unidentified proteins in KEGG database sequences. (E) A
  Venn diagram illustrates the overlap in TNF expression across all four signaling
  pathways
