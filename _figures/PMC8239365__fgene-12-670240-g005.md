caption: A diagram combining prior knowledge about the role of IGFBP2 in GBM and the
  gene regulatory network developed in the study. The hexagons are master regulators
  identified in our analysis. All the intermediates of the gene regulatory network
  are colored red if upregulated in STS and black if not present in the network. Dotted
  black line indicates the knowledge is through literature and continuous black line
  if known through gene regulatory network. Blue dotted lines represent gene regulatory
  connections between master regulators and their corresponding genes transcribed
  by target transcription factors. VEGFA, PDGFA, IGFs, and IL-31 activate RAF/MEK/ERK
  signaling, which mediate cell survival through PI3K-AKT pathway (; ). MEK2/RAF1/ERK5
  and AKT-1 are found to be upregulated in STS, suggestive of activated ERK signaling,
  which can contribute to drug resistance (; ). IGFBP2 activates IGFR either by increasing
  bioavailability of IGFs or by direct interaction with its functional domain. Integrin
  acts as receptor for IGFBP2 extracellular signals (; ) and modulates NF-κB signaling.
  IGFBP2 by nuclear translocation () is involved in transcriptional regulation of
  the VEGF gene and modulates angiogenesis (). STAT3 and NF-κB are said to be the
  two major downstream transcription factors of IGFBP2 that direct tumorigenic intracellular
  signaling () via EGFR signaling. Oncostatin M, a receptor for cytokine IL31, is
  a regulator of EGFR signaling (). FRA-1 is required for AKT activation in cancers
  to promote AKT-dependent cell growth (). NF-κB can regulate AP1 (FOS and JUN) thereby
  VEGF expression in pancreatic tumor cell lines (). All the five master regulators
  have binding sites for FRA-1. In the figure, we depicted the possible positive feedback
  loop between FRA-1 and the master regulators to orchestrate a complex tumorigenic
  program of invasiveness, migration, drug resistance, and angiogenesis.
