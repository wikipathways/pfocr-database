caption: Internal and external mediators that are used in cyanobacterial BPECs. In
  the photosynthetic pathway, electrons are transferred from water via PSII to the
  plastoquinone pool (PQ) and this is inhibited by the herbicide DCMU (dashed red
  line). The PQ pool also accepts electrons from the respiratory pathway which is
  enhanced by the addition of glucose to the cells. The PQH2 donates electrons to
  PSI that photo-reduces NADP+ to NADPH. The NADPH molecules can exit the cyanobacteria
  and reduce the external anode. Then it re-enters the cell to accept additional electrons
  from PSI. The addition of the NADPH binding protein ferredoxin NADP reductase (FNR)
  to the external medium inhibits the current by tightly binding the NADPH molecules
  outside the cell and thereby eliminating the electrical current production (red
  arrow). The photocurrent generation can be enhanced by the addition of exogenous
  NADP+ or Thiamine, both cycle electrons between PSI and the external anode. The
  polymer Me8–PFM and the soluble quinone DCBQ can enter the cells and cycle electrons
  between the PQ pool and the external anode. The artificial added mediator Fe(CN)6
  significantly enhances the current. However, it does not enter the cells and accepts
  electrons from NADPH at the external surface of the cells. Direct electron transfer
  is achieved by a direct linkage between the inner part of the cells and the external
  anode, for example by using nanotubes. Rather than using electron mediators to extract
  electrons from the cells to the anode, it is also possible to internalize electrons
  into the photosynthetic pathway. This can be done by reduction of DQ to DQH2 by
  the cathode, while DQH2 can enter the cells, donate electrons to the PQ pool, and
  re-exit the cell to accept additional electrons from the cathode. A green circle
  represents the cyanobacteria. Blue arrows represent the direction of the electron
  transport between components.

  description: Internal and external mediators that are used in cyanobacterial BPECs.
    In the photosynthetic pathway, electrons are transferred from water via PSII to
    the plastoquinone pool (PQ) and this is inhibited by the herbicide DCMU (dashed
    red line). The PQ pool also accepts electrons from the respiratory pathway which
    is enhanced by the addition of glucose to the cells. The PQH2 donates electrons
    to PSI that photo-reduces NADP+ to NADPH. The NADPH molecules can exit the cyanobacteria
    and reduce the external anode. Then it re-enters the cell to accept additional
    electrons from PSI. The addition of the NADPH binding protein ferredoxin NADP
    reductase (FNR) to the external medium inhibits the current by tightly binding
    the NADPH molecules outside the cell and thereby eliminating the electrical current
    production (red arrow). The photocurrent generation can be enhanced by the addition
    of exogenous NADP+ or Thiamine, both cycle electrons between PSI and the external
    anode. The polymer Me8–PFM and the soluble quinone DCBQ can enter the cells and
    cycle electrons between the PQ pool and the external anode. The artificial added
    mediator Fe(CN)6 significantly enhances the current. However, it does not enter
    the cells and accepts electrons from NADPH at the external surface of the cells.
    Direct electron transfer is achieved by a direct linkage between the inner part

    using electron mediators to extract electrons from the cells to the anode, it
    is also possible to internalize electrons into the photosynthetic pathway. This
