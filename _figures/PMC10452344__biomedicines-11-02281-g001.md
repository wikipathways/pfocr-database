caption: Influence of microRNAs on the hippo signaling pathway in gliomas. Major tumor
  suppressors of the hippo pathway, mammalian STE20-like protein kinases 1 and 2 (MST1/2),
  and major tumor suppressors 1 and 2 (LATS1/2) can be downregulated by the microRNAs
  miR-130b, miR-15a/b, and miR-221 [121,122,123]. The tumor-suppressor protein tyrosine
  phosphatase non-receptor type 14 (PTPN14) can be downregulated by miR-4516 [124].
  In the nucleus, the transcription factor TEA domain member 1 (TEAD1) forms a complex
  with the active (non-phosphorylated) proto-oncogene Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1)
  and the transcription co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), thereby promoting
  transcription activity, proliferation, and cell survival. TEAD1 can be downregulated
  by the microRNAs miR-195-5p and miR-524 [125,126]
