caption: Pathway describing sclareol and carotenoid biosynthesis in yeast. Erg20p
  catalyzes the formation of C15 farnesyl pyrophosphate molecules (FPP) for isoprenoid
  and sterol biosynthesis. A variant (F96C) enzyme was previously engineered to catalyze
  geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthesis (GGPP). Fusion of ERG20 (F96C) to the Cistus
  creticus 8-hydroxy copalyl diphosphate synthase (CcCLS) generates 8-OH-CPP, which
  in turn is converted to sclareol either through spontaneous hydrolysis in the acidified
  culture medium or enzymatically by the Salvia sclarea sclareol synthase (SsSCLS).
  In carotenoid biosynthesis the inserted carotenogenic pathway cassette of X. dendrorhous
  expresses the the GGPP synthase (encoded by the crtE gene), the bifunctional enzyme
  phytoene synthase/lycopene cyclase (encoded by the crtYB gene) and phytoene desaturase
  (encoded by the crtI gene).
papertitle: Iterative carotenogenic screens identify combinations of yeast gene deletions
  that enhance sclareol production.
