caption: MDSCs-mediated inhibition of T cell. MDSCs induce nitration of TCR-CD8 complex
  through hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxynitrite (PNT)
  and nitrate lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) at Tyr394 and CCL2
  chemokine through reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which inhibit T cell recognition
  of tumor antigen, and lead to reduced interleukin 2 (IL2) production and T-cell
  infiltration. MDSCs deplete extracellular L-arginine (L-Arg) by expressing arginase-1(Arg-1)
  and cationic amino acid transporter 2 (Cat2), which block the re-expression of CD3zeta,
  inhibit antigen-specific T-cell proliferation, and result in cell cycle arrest through
  upregulation of cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4). MDSCs also limit
  the availability of cysteine and tryptophan by expressing the xc-transporter and
  IDO, respectively, which block T-cell activation. On the one hand, MDSCs trigger
  apoptosis of tumor-infiltrating CTLs through the Fas/Fas-ligand axis. On the other
  hand, MDSCs express the death receptor Fas and apoptose in response to T-cell-expressed
  FasL. MDSCs induce DNA damage and subsequent p53 pathway activation through an iNOS-dependent
  pathway, thus inducing apoptosis of CD8+ T cells.
