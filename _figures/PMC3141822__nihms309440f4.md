caption: Possible mechanisms that sorafenib and PI-103 differentially inhibits and
  activates key kinases in the Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. (A) In the
  absence of added inhibitors, EGF/EGFR signaling activates Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathways. Activation of S6K in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may induce feedback inhibition
  on Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. (B) When sorafenib is added, sorafenib
  directly or indirectly inhibits Raf, MEK and ERK (shown by rectangles). Sorafenib
  may activate HGF/HGFR signaling via activation of PI3K, thus further activating
  AKT, mTOC1 and mTORC2 and S6K based on the activated levels after EGF stimulation
  (shown by ovals). Activation of S6K still causes feedback inhibition on both pathways.
  (C) Addition of PI-103 directly inhibits PI3K, mTORC1 and mTORC2. PI-103 indirectly
  inhibits AKT and S6K in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (shown by rectangles). Inhibition
  of S6K eliminates the feedback inhibition effect of S6K, thus increasing the signal
  towards the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway and further stimulated the Ras, Raf, MEK and ERK
  phosphorylation based on the activated levels after EGF stimulation (shown by ovals).
  (D) Combination of sorafenib and PI-103 blocks EGF stimulated Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathways. Therefore the combination of sorafenib and PI-103 may have an advantage
  over mono-drug treatment in HCC therapy.
