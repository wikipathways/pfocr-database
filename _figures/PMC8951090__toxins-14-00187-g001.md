caption: Schematic depiction of the cellular uptake and mode of action of PT. PT binds
  via its B-subunit to the cell surface. PT is endocytosed and follows a retrograde
  route through the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The A-subunit PTS1 dissociates
  from the B-Oligomer and is translocated via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD)
  pathway into the cytosol. Here, PTS1 ADP-ribosylates inhibitory α-subunits (Gαi)
  of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) thereby inactivating it. Thus, if the respective
  GPCR is activated, Gαi is no longer able to inhibit the adenylate cyclase (AC) resulting
  in increased and disturbed cAMP signaling [,].

  description: Schematic depiction of the cellular uptake and mode of action of PT.
    PT binds via its B-subunit to the cell surface. PT is endocytosed and follows
    a retrograde route through the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The A-subunit
    PTS1 dissociates from the B-Oligomer and is translocated via the ER-associated

    Thus, if the respective GPCR is activated, Gαi is no longer able to inhibit the
    adenylate cyclase (AC) resulting in increased and disturbed cAMP signaling [,].
