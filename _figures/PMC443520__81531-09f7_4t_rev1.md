caption: Model for the proposed function of AtMYC2 and ERF1 in cross-talk regulation
  of the JA and JA/ET pathways in Arabidopsis. Herbivore and pathogenic attack promote
  a transient increase of both JA and ethylene. JA is involved in systemic activation
  of wound-responsive genes, and ethylene prevents local expression of these genes.
  A positive interaction between JA and ethylene is involved in activation of the
  JA/ET-pathway regulated genes in response to necrotrophic pathogen attack. Whereas
  ERF1 activates JA/ET-regulated gene expression (), AtMYC2 is involved in activation
  of JA-regulated genes and also in repression of JA/ET-induced gene expression. Arrows
  and bars indicate positive and negative interactions, respectively. A possible function
  of ERF1 in repression of the JA-regulated pathway is indicated by a question mark.
  (OGAs) Oligogalacturonides; (JA) jasmonic acid; (ET) ethylene.
