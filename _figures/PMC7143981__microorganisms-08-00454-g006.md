caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed route for formate assimilation in
  D. amylolyticus. The first part of the cycle is formaldehyde production from formate,
  which might be catalysed by formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FoDH), or formyl/acetyl
  transferase (F/AT) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH). The second part of the cycle
  represents formaldehyde assimilation and ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) regeneration
  via ribulose monophosphate pathway (RuMP) and oxidative pentose phosphate pathway
  (OPPP). Formaldehyde could be fixed by Ru5P to form D-arabino-3-hexulose-6-phosphate
  (A3H6P) by 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (HPS) (1) and then isomerized to fructose
  6-phosphate (F6P) by 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (PHI) (2). In the genome of D.
  amylolyticus, only gene was found for an HPS-PHI-fused bifunctional enzyme (1-2).
  F6P is further isomerized to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
  (3). Later, G6P is oxidized to Ru5P by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (4) and
  6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (5).
