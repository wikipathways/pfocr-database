caption: S. cerevisiae phospholipid biosynthetic pathway. CDP–DAG is the common precursor
  for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and PC. PI is made de novo from glucose-6-P
  but can also be synthesized from exogenously supplied inositol. PC is synthesized
  de novo from CDP–DAG via a series of methylation reactions carried out by the products
  of the CHO2 and OPI3 genes. Alternatively, PC can be made via a salvage pathway
  (Kennedy pathway; highlighted in yellow to facilitate discussion) when E, MME, DME,
  or C is supplied exogenously. Genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes are depicted
  in gray boxes.
