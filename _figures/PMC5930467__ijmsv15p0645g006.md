caption: 'Proposed working model for VP in bladder cancer cell. As previous description,
  YAP was highly expressed in some bladder cancer patients and played dominant role
  in bladder cancer progress. However, there is still no efficient YAP-targeted drug
  for bladder cancer treatment. According to our study on VP, we proposed the working
  model: VP suppressed bladder cancer cell growth and invasion via specifically repressing
  YAP activity; As YAP specific inhibitor of YAP, VP was able to efficiently downregulate
  Hippo pathway''s target genes'' expression and then restricted bladder cancer cell
  growth and invasion; VP might become a potential YAP-targeted drug for bladder cancer
  treatment, especially for YAP highly expressed cases.'
