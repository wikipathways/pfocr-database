caption: Schematic illustration of the preparation and mechanism of the function of
  LV-sHDL. (A) Preparation of LV-sHDL. (B) The mechanism of LV-sHDL in tumor tissue.
  sHDL is applied to deliver LEN and vadimezan together into tumor tissue through
  a recognition with the SR-B1 on 4T1 tumor cells. LEN is supposed to induce immunogenic
  cell death (ICD) to trigger antitumor immune response, and vadimezan is expected
  to activate STING pathway to enhance the dendritic cell (DC) maturation and regulate
  the immunosuppressive microenvironment simultaneously, thus improving the antitumor
  effect. Figure was created and reprinted with the permission from with BioRender.com.
