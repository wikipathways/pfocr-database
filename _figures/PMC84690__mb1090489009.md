caption: Model for Cas-mediated activation of the SRE. Kinase-active Src directly
  binds to Cas. This association leads to the coupling of Grb2 with Shc and Shp-2
  by yet undetermined means. The induced association of Grb2 with Shc and/or Shp-2
  may signal to the Ras/Mek/Erk pathway. Activation of the Erk MAPK pathway can then
  lead to SRE-dependent transcriptional activation. Other Src-dependent signaling
  pathways that are not shown may also result in activation of Ras and signaling to
  SREs.
