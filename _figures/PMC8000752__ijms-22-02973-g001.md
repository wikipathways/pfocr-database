caption: Tryptophan Metabolic Pathways. Tryptophan metabolism in hosts occurs via
  the kynurenine pathway or the serotonin pathway to produce bioactive metabolites.
  (A) 90% of kynurenine pathway degradation occurs in the liver via TDO conversion
  of TPH to kynurenine. The remaining kynurenine degradation occurs by IDO in the
  brain, GI tract and liver. Kynurenine is metabolized to kynurenic acid by KAT enzymes.
  It can also be metabolized to quinolinic acid, which is then converted to NAD+.
  Alternatively, kynurenine is converted to 3-HK and subsequently to XA. (B) In the
  serotonin pathway, TPH is converted to 5-HTP by TPH1 in enterochromaffin cells,
  or TPH2 in enteric or central neurons. 5-HTP is decarboxylated to form serotonin.
  Serotonin can be further metabolized to form melatonin, or degraded by MAO to 5-HIAA,
  which is excreted in the urine. (C) In gut microbes, tryptophan is metabolized into
  indole and indole derivatives. Microbes express different enzymes that utilize TPH.
  Conversion of TPH to IPA occurs initially through aromatic amino acid decarboxylase
  to IPYA, which is then converted to ILA and IA prior to conversion to IPA. Through
  other tryptophan-degrading enzymes, microbes can create metabolic end-products IAld
  and IAAld. IAAld, which is formed from tryptamine, can also be converted to IAA
  and subsequently to IAld. Microbes may also convert TPH directly to indole. AAAD
  = aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, ArAT = aromatic amino acid aminotransferase,
  3-HAA = 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, 5-HIAA = 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 3-HK = 3-hydroxykynurenine,
  5-HT = 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HTP = 5-hydroxytryptophan, IA = anholocyclic acid,
  IAA = indole-3-acetic acid, IAAld = indole-3-acetaldehyde, IAld = indole-3-aldehyde,
