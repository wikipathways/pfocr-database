caption: In the neuron, αSyn may exist in an equilibrium between soluble (monomer,
  oligomer) and insoluble species (fibrillar). It could then be degraded by LRRK2-directed
  autophagy (1a) or be secreted into the extracellular milieu (scale of neuronal αSyn
  degradation pathways reduced for clarity). Neuronal αSyn is released via an unknown
  mechanism, and given the numerous ties between LRRK2 function and membrane dynamics,
  this process could be affected by LRRK2 (1b). As in the neuron, αSyn in the extracellular
  milieu may form higher order structures or remain as a monomer, where it can then
  interact with surrounding microglia (2). Extracellular αSyn could re-enter neurons,
  or interact with surrounding microglia. At the cell surface level, αSyn aggregates
  may activate different microglia receptors to initiate cell activation, where as
  monomeric αSyn may be inert. An activation of TLRs, or other as yet unidentified
  cell-surface receptors, would result in phosphorylation and membrane translocation
  of LRRK2 protein (3). LRRK2 recruited to ALP vesicles assist in the microglial activation
  response (4), modulating processes including the production/secretion of cytokines,
  phagocytosis of αSyn, or antigen processing to promote immune tolerance (5). Independently,
  it is believed that αSyn species are internalized by microglia (by a yet unknown
  mechanism) (6), potentially by passive diffusion (monomer), or by more active or
  receptor-mediated means (oligomer/fibrillar). LRRK2 may then regulate the degradation
  of these species through a lysosomal pathway (7). Dysregulation of these LRRK2-implicated
  pathways by pathogenic PD-associated missense mutations could then affect these
  pathways to result in neuroinflammation and accumulation of αSyn, respectively.
