caption: Schematic representation of the role of lncRNAs in host immune system during
  Mtb infection. (A) TB infection causes upregulation of lncRNAs modulating the immune
  system of macrophages. lncRNA MIAT modulates apoptosis and autophagy through the
  miR-665/ULK1 crosstalk. COX-2 modulates inflammatory response by activating NF-κb/STAT3,
  associating with p50 (a repressive subunit of NF-κb), and M1 macrophage polarization,
  and induces apoptosis by activating the PERK-eIF-2α-CHOP signaling pathway. NEAT1
  modulates inflammatory response and apoptosis through targeting miR-377-3p. (B)
  TB infection causes downregulation of lncRNAs modulating the immune system of macrophages.
  LincRNA-EPS inhibited apoptosis and enhanced autophagy by activating the JNK/MAPK
  signaling pathway. GAS5 promotes the cell vitality and inflammatory response by
  sponging miR-18a-5p. PCED1B-AS1 can directly bind to miR-155 to inhibit apoptosis
  and induce autophagy. (C) TB infection causes upregulation of lncRNA-CD244 to interact
  with EZH2 and mediates H3K27 trimethylation at ifng/tnfa loci, thereby suppressing
  IFN-γ/TNF-α expression and increasing bacterial proliferation in T cells.
