caption: Initial contraction and MLC20 phosphorylation induced by LPA involves Gq-dependent
  PLC-β activation, IP3 generation, Ca2+ release and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation
  of MLCK. Sustained contraction and MLC20 phosphorylation involves Gq-dependent activation
  of RhoA and PKC, phosphorylation of CPI-17 and inhibition of MLCP. Although Rho
  kinase was activated, phosphorylation by Rho kinase of MYPT1 at the inhibitory site
  Thr696 was prevented by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Ser695. The pathway
  involves canonical activation of NF-κB and release of the PKA catalytic subunit
  (PKAc) from its binding to the IκBα complex leading to phosphorylation of MYPT1
  by PKA.
