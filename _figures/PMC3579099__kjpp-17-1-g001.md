caption: The calcineurin-NFAT pathway as an integrator of multiple signaling pathways
  in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH). NFAT resides in the cytoplasm
  of resting cells in a phosphorylated and inactive state. Endothelial dysfunction
  occurs early in PH and results in an increased release of vasoconstrictors (Endothelin-1
  [ET-1] and 5-Hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) and decreased vasodilators (Prostaglandin
  [PGI2] and nitric oxide synthase [NOS]). These vasoconstrictors can stimulate phospholipase
  C (PLC) coupled cell surface receptors leading to mobilization of calcium ions (Ca2+)
  from intracellular stores via inositol trisphosphate (IP3). The elevated intracellular
  calcium ([Ca2+]i) can cause further Ca2+ influx via Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+
  channels (CRAC). Addtionally, the down-regulation of Kv1.5 depolarized PASMC and
  will lead to the influx of via L-type voltage dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC). The
  elevated [Ca2+]i activates phosphatase calcineurin which dephosphorylates NFAT allowing
  for its translocation to the nucleus. Here it is involved in the regulation of multiple
  genes. Multiple NFAT binding elements are present in the promoter regions of both
  the Kv1.5 and bcl-2 genes leading to a promotion of cell proliferation and suppressing
  mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Cyclosporin A inhibits calcineurin-ubstrate interactions
  and VIVITs electively inhibits NFAT activation.
