caption: The most significantly modulated pathway in medaka skin was the acute phase
  signaling pathway (IPA z-score 3.2) leading to an increase in the inflammation response;
  other pathways that play a role in the inflammation response such as IL-6 (boxed
  in yellow), ILK signaling (light blue), PPAR signaling (pink) and the Vitamin C
  pathway (dark blue) are also found within the acute phase signaling pathway. Genes
  up-modulated are represented in red; down modulated are in green (Fold Change see
  ).
