  (A) and possible handling of ureidoacrylate (B). (A) Rut pathway. RutG appears to
  be a pyrimidine nucleobase transporter. We infer that RutA catalyzes synthesis of
  ureidoacrylate peracid (see text). Although our work did not address the specific
  role of FMN, it is plausible that flavin hydroperoxide, a well-known intermediate
  in related reactions (), would participate (). We postulate that ureidoacrylate
  peracid is the primary substrate for RutB (see text). Activities of RutC, -D, and
  -E, which have not yet been studied biochemically, were inferred by a variety of
  other means. Whereas YdfG uses NADPH as a cofactor, RutE is predicted to be a flavoprotein
  (, ). Proposed names for Rut enzymes are in the inset. (B) Formation and use of
  ureidoacrylate. If some ureidoacrylate is formed by spontaneous reduction of ureidoacrylate
  peracid (), RutB can hydrolyze it. We believe this auxiliary pathway, which was
  prominent in vitro (Fig. ), plays a minor role in vivo (see text).
