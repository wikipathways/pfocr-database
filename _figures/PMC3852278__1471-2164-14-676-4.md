caption: The ubiquitin dependent degradation system in Ponkan mandarin 1 day after
  infection with X. fastidiosa. Activation of the auxin pathway in Ponkan mandarin
  after infection with the bacteria. Signaling of this hormone happens when, at high
  auxin concentrations, the transcription factor Aux /IAA9 is sent to ubiquitin dependent
  degradation, which leads to degradation of this factor, allowing the release of
  auxin responsive factors (ARFs) from the complex. Log2 fold change of gene expression
  (X. fastidiosa versus mock-inoculated control) was analyzed by MapMan. Blue squares
  represent upregulated genes, red squares represent downregulated genes and grey
  circles represent not differentially regulated genes. The color saturation indicates
  fold change >0.8 and < -0.8. Aux /IAA9, transcription factor Auxin/Indole-3 acetic
  acid 9; DUB, Deubiquitinating enzyme; E1, Ubiquitin-activating enzymes; UBA1, ubiquitin-activating
  enzyme E1; E2, Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes; UBC2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
  E2; RING, C3HC4 RING-domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase; HECT, HECT type E3;
  APC, anaphase-promoting complex; E3, Ubiquitin ligases; Cullin, SKP, FBOX and RBX,
  subunit of the E3 ligase; ARF, auxin responsive factors.
