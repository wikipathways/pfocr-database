caption: 'Biochemical coupling. Mechanosensors: a) Transmembrane proteins termed ‘integrins’
  form focal adhesions with linker proteins, stimulating kinase pathways. b) Voltage-sensitive
  calcium (Ca2+) channels stimulate influx of calcium into the cell. c) Hexagonal
  connexins allow for efflux of newly synthesized prostaglandin 2 (PGE2), and their
  presence is upregulated by PGE2 via connexin 43 (Cx43). d) Primary cilia regulate
  bone cell function in response to fluid shear stress through calcium ion influx
  (activating signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) signalling
  pathways) and prostaglandin release. e) Cadherins span the cell membrane and dissociate
  with β-catenin in response to fluid shear stresses. Signal transduction pathways:
  f) Kinase pathways are activated by integrins and intracellular calcium release,
  resulting in upregulation of osteogenic transcription factors including runt-related
  transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Osterix (OSX). g) An influx of calcium ions stimulates
  PGE2 synthesis via adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and activates kinase pathways.
  h) The wingless integrated (Wnt) signalling pathway is activated following dissociation
  of β-catenin from cadherin receptors. Accumulation and translocation of β-catenin
  to the cell nucleus stimulates upregulation of RUNX2. Akt, protein kinase B; ERK,
  extracellular signal-related kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; OPG, osteoprotegerin; OPN, osteopontin; PKA, protein kinase A.'
