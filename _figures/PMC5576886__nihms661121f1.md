caption: BER is responsible for the repair of cellular oxidative DNA damage. Depending
  on the lesion, the process begins with the action of one of many glycosylases (listed
  left not comprehensive), creating an intermediate AP site. This site is processed
  by the major human AP endonuclease, APE1. BER then branches into two major sub-pathways,
  Short and Long patch BER (SP-BER and LP-BER respectively). SP-BER comprises of four
  core BER proteins; APE1, Polβ (incorporation)and XRCC1/Ligase III (ligation). Knock
  down of any of the core SP-BER genes results in embryonic lethality. Alternatively,
  replicating cells have access to a second robust LP-BER pathway. In comparison to
  SP-BER, the proteins involved in LP-BER are primarily attributed to replication
  but are able to carry out repair function giving the cells alternate overlapping
  repair response.
