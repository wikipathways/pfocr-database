caption: Regulation of RH development by various hormones and their crosstalk.BR positively
  regulates the expression of WER, GL2 (negative regulator of RH development) and
  inhibits BIN2, which is then unable to phosphorylate GL3/EGL3 and TTG1. Presence
  of BR promotes functional TF complex formation between TTG1, GL3/EGL3, and WER,
  promoting GL2 expression, leading to inhibition of the RH development pathway. CK
  induces TF ZFP5, which promotes the expression of CPC (positive regulator of RH
  development), leading to the formation of functional TF complex of TTG1, GL3/EGL3,
  and CPC. The complex inhibits the expression of GL2, thus causing activation of
  the RH development pathway. The presence of auxin liberates the ARFs from AUX/IAAs.
  The ARFs show different specificity to RH development. ARF4-11 inhibits, whereas
  ARF6 promotes, the RH development pathway. ARF5 directly interacts with the promotor
  of RSL4, leading to RH development. Auxin also directly regulates the expression
  of RSL4 target gene ERU via ARF7/ARF19. JA positively influences RH growth via ET
  signalling. Solid black arrows indicate confirmed pathways.
