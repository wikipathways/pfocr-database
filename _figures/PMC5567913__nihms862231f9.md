caption: Graphical summary of the results. Radiation activates latent TGF-β1 by detaching
  it from the latency-associated protein (LAP). Activated TGF-β1 binds to TGF-βR2.
  TGF-βR1 then binds to TGF-βR2. Heterodimerized TGF-β receptors then phosphorylate
  SMAD2 and SMAD3 in the cytosol. Phosphorylated SMADs then localize to the nucleus
  after dimerizing with SMAD4. pSMAD2-SMAD4 and pSMAD3-SMAD4 then bind to the promoter
  region of their target genes and initiate profibrotic and senescence-inducing gene
  expression. Inhibition of NOX4 inhibits expression of extracellular TGF-b1 and total
  SMAD3 as well as phosphorylation of SMAD2. MnTE-2-PyP (T2E) inhibits expression
  of TGF-βR2, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 and the phosphorylation of SMAD2. As a result, in
  both of the conditions, inhibition of NOX4 and T2E treatment, profibrotic- and senescence-inducing
  gene expression is inhibited. As a consequence, inhibition of NOX4 or MnTE-2-PyP-treated
  irradiated cells become protected from radiation-induced fibrosis and senescence.
