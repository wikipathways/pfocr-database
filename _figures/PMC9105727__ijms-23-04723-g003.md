caption: Cell cycle-mediated cell death occurs through non-immunogenic death pathways.
  (a) Cyclin-dependent kinase (CdK) inhibitors act in response to many stressors to
  arrest the cell cycle and increase autophagic flux. When damage cannot be resolved,
  autophagy is terminated and the cell commits to apoptosis. Cell death from mitotic
  catastrophe also proceeds through apoptosis. (b) When the apoptosis pathway is compromised
  or inhibited, as is commonly seen in cancer, cell death may occur through other
  pathways. Prolonged cell cycle arrest can lead to sustained autophagy and presumably
  lead to autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD). During a mitotic catastrophe, spontaneous
  ripoptosome formation could enable necroptosis without TNF signaling. Blue death
  programs are immunogenic; yellow are non-immunogenic.
