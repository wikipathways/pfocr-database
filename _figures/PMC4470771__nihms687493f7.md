caption: Schematic representation of conclusions drawn from current study showing
  upregulation of JAK/STAT3 pathway in response to binding of G-CSF to G-CSFR. Active
  STAT3 translocate to nucleus and upregulate the expression of key target genes that
  are know to be involved in tumorigenicity, metastasis and drug resistance. CSF3R
  (gene coding for G-CSFR) is also a direct transcriptional target of STAT3. Binding
  of STAT3 on CSF3R promoter further upregulate surface expression of the G-CSFR (CD114),
  making a feedback loop mechanism for tumor progression in NB. STAT3 inhibition and
  anti-G-CSF antibody are shown to block this positive feedback loop and therefore
  decrease the cancer stem cell functions in NB.
