caption: Evasion strategies of MM mediated by the microbiota. Mechanically, the microbiota
  facilitates the release of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which subsequently stimulates
  the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). This activation
  further triggers the nuclear factor kappa B (NK-κB) signaling pathway activation
  and induces Foxp3 expression as well as differentiation of Th17 cells, thereby establishing
  a tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile, as NH4+ scavengers, microbiota can utilize
  NH4+ to generate L-glutamine that promotes the growth of multiple myeloma. Simultaneously,
  gut-resident Th17 cells migrate to the bone marrow and secrete cytokines such as
  IL-17 and IL-6, leading to bone destruction and accelerating disease progression
  of multiple myeloma. Moreover, gut microbiota can modify drug-metabolizing enzymes,
  which in turn affects treatment responses by promoting the development of drug resistance
  in multiple myeloma. Created with Biorender.com
