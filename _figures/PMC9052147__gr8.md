caption: The iron acquisition systems of S. lugdunensis.S. lugdunensis can utilize
  heme and non-heme sources of iron to support bacterial growth in iron-restricted
  environments including the mammalian host. The iron-regulated surface determinant
  (Isd) pathway that functions as a high-affinity heme iron acquisition system is
  depicted. The Isd pathway is comprised of peptidoglycan anchored proteins (represented
  by the pink rectangle) that can bind free heme or hemoglobin at the bacterial cell
  surface and extract heme. At the cytoplasmic membrane, heme is bound by the lipoprotein
  IsdE and transported to the interior of the cell through the permease IsdF. Iron
  (Fe) is liberated from heme by the heme oxygenase IsdG (not depicted). Heme can
  also be transported through the cytoplasmic membrane by an ECF-type transporter
  encoded by the lhaSTA genes. While S. lugdunensis does not synthesize siderophore,
  it can also utilize xenosiderophores (i.e., siderophores made by other bacteria)
  to promote growth. The polycarboxylate siderophores staphyloferrin A and staphyloferrin
  B, made by S. aureus, can be taken up by the dedicated ABC-type transporters HtsABC
  and SirABC, respectively. Hydroxamate-type siderophores are transported through
  the FhuDBGC ABC-type transporter. The ATPase FhuC is utilized by Hts, Sir, and Fhu
  transport systems to hydrolyze ATP and provide the necessary energy for siderophore
  uptake. Catechol containing molecules such as norepinephrine, a host stress response
  hormone, are taken up by S. lugdunensis through the Sst1 ABC transporter encoded
  by the genes sstABCD1. The second Sst ABC-type transporter encoded by the sstABCD2
  genes (indicated by the white shapes with dashed lines) does not appear to be expressed
  in S. lugdunensis and does not support S. lugdunensis growth on catecholamines as
  a source of iron. S. lugdunensis can also utilize iron directly from the environment
  through the function of the ferrous iron (Fe2+) transporter FeoAB. Collectively,
  these iron acquisition systems enable S. lugdunensis to access a broad range of
  iron sources, thereby enabling the bacteria to acquire this essential trace metal.
