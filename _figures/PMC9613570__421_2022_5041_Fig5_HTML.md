caption: Shared signalling pathways between circulating factors and the proteins they
  upregulate. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-growth factor
  (IGF-1) both bind to unique membrane receptors (VEGFR1, VGEFR2/3, and IGF-1R) while
  sharing common signalling pathways within the endothelium, via the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase (PI3K) and activation of Akt, as well as through the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathway MEK1/2–ERK1/2. These signalling pathways can induce significant
  upregulation of key proteins including VEGF, heat shock proteins (HSP’s), interleukins,
  and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha. HSP’s and HIF-1α are also seen to be elevated
  in response to environmental changes such hypoxia and hyperthermia, and both proteins
  have to capacity to increase responses to circulating factors via interaction with
  receptor presentation, signal pathways, or both. Created in BioRender
