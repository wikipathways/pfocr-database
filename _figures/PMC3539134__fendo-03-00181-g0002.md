caption: Inhibition of insulin signaling pathway by SOCS1 and SOCS3. SOCS1 and SOCS3
  are induced by cytokines and involved in a negative feed-back loop. SOCS1 and SOCS3
  also inhibit insulin signaling by different mechanisms. They interfere with the
  binding between the insulin receptor and IRS1/2 proteins. SOCS1 also inhibits the
  tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor. Both SOCS1 and SOCS3 can interact
  with the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins leading to their degradation by the
  proteasome. The resulting effect is a decrease in the insulin-induced activation
  of the IRS1/2-PI3K-PKB axis leading to a reduction in the metabolic effects of insulin.
