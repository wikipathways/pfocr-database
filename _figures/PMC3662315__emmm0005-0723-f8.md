caption: Schematic summary of the role of Cdc42 inhibition in the biology of BLBC
  cells.TMX resistance and tumour initiation in BLBC cells is due, at least in part,
  to inhibition of c-Cbl activation. Restoration of c-Cbl function, by perturbation
  of Cdc42, enables increased phosphorylation of c-Cbl, enhanced degradation of c-Cbl
  targeted RTKs (such as the EGFR), increased sensitivity to TMX and loss of TIC function.
