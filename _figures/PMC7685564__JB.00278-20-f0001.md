caption: Schematic of Vibrio effectors activated by ARFs. ARFs cycle off and on membranes,
  depending on their nucleotide-bound state and are mediated by guanine nucleotide
  exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that alter myristoyl
  group exposure. Cholera toxin (CT) is endocytosed by host cells and moves along
  the retrograde trafficking pathway to release its active component, subunit A1,
  into the cytosol. At the plasma membrane, ARF6-GTP stimulates A1 to undergo a conformational
  change that exposes its ADP-ribosyltransferase active site. A1 ADP-ribosylation
  of the stimulatory G protein α subunit (Gsα) constitutively activates adenylyl cyclase
  (AC) to increase cAMP levels, which activates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR) to transport chloride out of the cell. Effector domains
  of multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) polypeptides are translocated
  across host membranes by pores formed from their N- and C-terminal repeats. Within
  cells, the cysteine protease domain (CPD) autoprocesses the large polypeptide into
  individual effectors. However, the CPD does not cleave in front of makes caterpillars
  floppy (MCF) or domain X (DmX) and therefore leaves effector modules instead of
  individual effectors. At the Golgi apparatus, ARF1-GTP stimulates the autoprocessing
  activity of MCF and DmX, and they are released as individual effectors. The Golgi
  stacks and endoplasmic reticulum were drawn using Servier Medical Art, which is
