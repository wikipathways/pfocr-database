caption: 'Leptin-dependent regulation of immune homeostasis and function. In a naïve
  CD4+ T cell, the LEPR-dependent intracellular signaling enhances the differentiation
  toward pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 cells while inhibiting the proliferation of FOXP3+
  T reg cells. Furthermore, at absent/low levels of leptin the growth and function
  of Th1/Th17 is impaired, while T reg cells expand more efficiently and release more
  regulatory-type cytokines. The opposite occurs when leptin levels are aberrantly
  high and enhance Th1/Th17 differentiation and growth on one side and inhibit T reg
  cell proliferation on the other. This different cellular response to leptin depends
  on the different sensitivity of Th1/Th17 and T reg cells to either physiologically
  fluctuating LEPR-mTOR activation (low/normal leptin) or consistent hyperstimulation
  of the same pathway (high leptin). The two opposite situations are correlated with
  either higher susceptibility to infections (low leptin: effector arm inefficient,
  elevated immune suppression) or enhanced susceptibility to autoimmunity (high leptin:
  effector arm hyperactive, inefficient immune regulation). Schematic figures were
  created with images adapted from Smart Servier Medical Art (http://www.servier.fr/servier-medical-art).
