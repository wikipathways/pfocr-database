caption: A schematic diagram of iron‐induced BMP6 expression via Runx3 and the consequent
  regulation of hepcidin. The increasing body iron stimulates the production of BMP6,
  which binds to a complex of type I and II BMP receptors on the plasma membrane of
  hepatocytes.,  This leads to the phosphorylation of SMAD1, 5 and 8 in the cytoplasm,
  which allows the binding of SMAD4. The entire complex is then translocated into
  the nucleus where it binds to BMP responsive elements in the hepcidin promoter,
  stimulating transcription. However, the regulation mechanism of BMP6 by iron stimuli
  has not yet been revealed. Here, we showed that Runx3 KO or KD in mouse primary
  hepatocytes, human hepatocytes and human hepatocellular carcinoma decreased BMP6
  expression and inhibited the BMP‐Smad pathway in human hepatocytes. Therefore, Runx3
  regulates iron metabolism of the liver via modulation of BMP signalling
