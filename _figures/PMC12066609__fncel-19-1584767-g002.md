caption: 'Autophagy, including mitophagy, is a multistep process regulated by numerous
  proteins, many of which represent potential targets for the treatment of neurodegeneration
  and neuroinflammation. The initiation of autophagy is regulated by the activation
  or inhibition of mTORC1, ULK1, and the PI3K complexes. Under conditions of energy
  stress, AMPK is activated by an increased AMP:ATP and ADP:ATP ratio, promoting autophagy.
  Autophagy is initiated when mTORC1 inhibition relieves its suppression of the ULK1
  complex. Physiologically, this occurs during starvation (e.g., glucose deprivation),
  which induces autophagy through the activation of AMPK. The prevailing model suggests
  that AMPK phosphorylates and activates ULK1 (UNC-51 like kinase 1), initiating autophagy.
  However, new evidence indicates that glucose deprivation may suppress ULK1 signaling
  despite AMPK activation. When autophagy is induced, a phagophore membrane structure
  forms and elongates until it fully closes to form autophagosome. The autophagosome
  subsequently fuses with a lysosome to form an autolysosome, where hydrolytic enzymes
  degrade the autophagic cargo in an acidic environment. External autophagy modulators
  that have the potential to treat neurodegenerative diseases by inducing autophagy
  are shown in the scheme: Rapamycin, Everolimus, Temsirolimus (mTORC1 inhibitors),
  Simvastatin (activator of the LBK1-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway), Berberine, Resveratrol
  (activators of AMPK and class III PI3K complex), NMN (increases acidification of
  lysososme). BCN4 prevents Beclin-1 from binding to GAPR-1, maintaining its availability
  for PI3K complex-mediated autophagy initiation. GLUT1, Glucose transporter type
  1; mTORC1, Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; ULK1, Unc-51-like autophagy
