caption: Representation of glutamate, GABA, and DA projections onto direct (D1) and
  indirect pathway (D2) MSNs in HD. In WT (left), DA released by nigrostriatal inputs
  activates glutamate and GABA release onto D1 MSNs while it decreases glutamate and
  GABA release onto D2 MSNs. In early HD (middle), increased DA transmission leads
  to increased release of glutamate and GABA onto D1 MSNs. There is no change onto
  D2 MSNs, suggesting changes in indirect pathway MSNs might occur at a different
  time point or involve other mechanisms. In late HD (right), D1 MSNs display decreases
  in glutamate transmission, presumably due to loss of corticostriatal inputs and/or
  decreased DA transmission. In contrast, D2 MSNs display only a small decrease in
  glutamate synaptic inputs while GABA synaptic transmission is increased, probably
  through altered D2 receptor function.
