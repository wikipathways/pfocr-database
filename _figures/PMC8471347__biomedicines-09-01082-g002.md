caption: Schematic demonstrating the nucleolus as the hub of ribosome biogenesis and
  as a critical regulator of cellular homeostasis. Ribosome biogenesis starts with
  transcription of the 47S pre ribosomal RNA (rRNA) by the PolI preinitiation complex.
  The 47S transcript is cleaved, processed and packaged to eventually generate the
  40S and 60S ribosomal sub-units. The function of the nucleolus is altered by a plethora
  of environmental and oncogenic stresses. This change in nucleolar function alters
  numerous cellular processes to alter phenotype and regulate homeostasis. Dashed
  lines represent movement within the cell. Black stars and yellow dots represent
  assembly factors. Arrows depict the direction of influence.
