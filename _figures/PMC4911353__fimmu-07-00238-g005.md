caption: Interaction and expression pattern of SDEGs involved in canonical interferon
  signaling pathway in Mtb-infected mouse lungs with or without CC-11050 treatment.
  (A) Pathway map showing interaction of member genes involved in Ifn signaling pathway.
  Red color indicates upregulation, and green color indicates downregulation. (B)
  Intensity plot of SDEGs associated with Ifn signaling. UT, untreated; CC, treated
  with CC-11050. Red color shows upregulation, and blue color shows downregulation
  of gene expression. Scale bar ranges from +3 (red) to −3 (blue).
