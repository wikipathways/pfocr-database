caption: miRNA deregulation in cancer. A schematic representation depicting the canonical
  miRNA biogenesis pathway and the general mechanisms whereby normal miRNA expression
  and function can be deregulated in cancer. (A) Deregulation of miRNA gene transcription
  in cancer through genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms. Active transcription
  is indicated by green arrow, blocked transcription by red block arrow. Red crosses
  indicate loss of gene, epigenetic mechanism or transcription factor. Me, methylation;
  Ac, acetylation. [Refer to Sections 3.1–3.3 in main text.] (B) Simplified canonical
  pathway of miRNA biogenesis and processing. Steps commonly deregulated in cancer
  indicated in red. [Sections 1 and 3.4] (C) Mechanisms prevalent in cancer allowing
  mRNAs to escape regulation by miRNAs. RNA binding protein abbreviated as RBP. ceRNAs
  represented in blue. [Section 3.5].
