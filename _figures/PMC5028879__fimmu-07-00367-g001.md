caption: NOD2 senses MDP and elicits immune responses. MDP-derived from bacterial
  cell wall can be transported into the cytosol by endo/phagosome through peptide
  transporters (e.g., SLC15A4). MDP activates NOD2 to initiate RIPK2 recruitment resulting
  in platform formation. This cytosolic NOD2-initiated structure localizes E3 ligases
  (e.g., TRAF6) to ubiquitinate NEMO, for which NEMO and TAK1 forms a complex near
  IKK. In addition to activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,
  TAK1 phosphorylates IKK to initiate the NF-κB signaling pathway. IκB-α is phosphorylated
  by IKK, which targets IκB-α to proteasome degradation. No longer restricted, free
  NF-κB translocates into the nucleus and activates various immune response genes.
  NOD2 also recruits ATG16L1 near the plasma membrane to promote autophagosome formation,
  known to degrade antigenic structures. The release of cytokines and chemokines,
  initiated by NOD2, recruits immune cells to influence Th1 and Th2 responses.
