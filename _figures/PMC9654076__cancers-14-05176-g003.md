caption: 'Mechanisms of p53 transcriptional activation and potential effects of p53
  loss. Schemes follow another format. (A) Regulation of p53 expression in normal
  cells. RAS signaling leads to the activation of NF-κB as well as c-Myc, both of
  which directly bind to the p53 promoter and facilitate its expression. NF-kB also
  binds to the c-Myc promoter and induces its expression. The p53 protein then regulates
  these pathways, by stimulating the production of BTG2 and miRNA-145, which inhibit
  RAS and c-Myc function, respectively. Additionally, p53 protein can directly bind
  to the c-Myc promoter and repress its transcription. (B) Proposed effect that p53
  loss can have on p53 promoter activity. Loss of p53 function can result in persistent
  RAS signaling through NF-κB and c-Myc, both of which will directly bind to and stimulate
  the p53 promoter. In cells with constitutively active mutant RAS and/or c-Myc, this
  pathway may be active even in the absence of p53 mutation/silencing. Legend: Arrows
  represent activation pathways (purple for NF-κB, pink for c-Myc, black for RAS and
  p53, green for phosphorylation event by ERK) and hammers represent inhibition.'
