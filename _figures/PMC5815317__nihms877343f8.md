  strand (TS) and non-transcribed strand (NTS) are repaired by either Apn1-mediated
  BER or homologous recombination pathway (HR). Repair by HR is suppressed by Dst1.
  While Ntg1/Ntg2-mediated BER repairs mostly the AP sites present on TS, Rad26- or
  Def1-mediated TC-NER repairs the AP sites on NTS. Those AP sites left unrepaired
  will invoke mutagenic translesion synthesis (TLS). Grey oval and dotted line represent
  RNA polymerase complex and nascent RNA chain, respectively. AP lesion is denoted
