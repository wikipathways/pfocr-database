caption: The elucidated MIA biosynthetic pathway in Catharanthus roseus. Enzymes catalyzing
  pathways in the aerial parts of the plant are depicted in green, and enzymes in
  the roots are depicted in orange. MIA names highlighted in light blue circles have
  also been identified in Vinca minor. Depicted in the grey box is the rearrangement
  of the T30 epoxide product, forming an eburnamine-vincamine like skeleton, in cases
  where T3R is silenced as described in []. The different MIA scaffold classes are
  depicted by MIA names written in dark blue (iboga-type), light blue (strychnos-type),
  brown (corynanthe) and purple (aspidosperma). Uncharacterized reactions are depicted
  with dashed arrows. MEP, methyl-D-erythritol phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
