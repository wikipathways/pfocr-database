caption: Signaling through the PI-3 Kinase-Akt pathway. Several different types of
  receptors can activate PI-3 kinase-Akt signaling through upstream mediators including
  ILK, Src, and IRS1/2. PI-3 kinase can directly activate Akt or indirectly through
  activation of PDK1 via the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 which is mediated by PI-3
  kinase. Akt phosphorylates numerous downstream signaling proteins resulting in positive
  regulation of mTOR and negative regulation of GSK-3, FKHR, and Bad among other targets.
  Inhibition of PI-3 kinase-Akt signaling includes ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 inhibition of
  IRS-1 as well as Akt inhibition by TRB3. Not shown is the regulation of these pathways
  by phosphatases which include PTEN, SHP-2, and PP2A, among others.
