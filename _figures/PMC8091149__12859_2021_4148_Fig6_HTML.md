caption: Molecular network that may explain how the host pathway “IL6 Signaling” can
  be increased by COVID-19 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 proteins (represented with black
  8-pointed icons) bind to and may affect the activity of host proteins (various shapes)
  leading to increases in IL6 Signaling. The orange color of the host proteins and
  host function indicate predicted increases of activity whereas the blue color represents
  predicted decreases in activity. The network was constructed using the QIAGEN Knowledge
  Graph and machine learning techniques as described herein
