caption: Working model for early events occurring in premutation neurons. Premutation
  neurons exhibit an early chronic elevated [Ca2+]i associated with Ca2+signaling
  dysregulation. This early Ca2+ overload leads to mitochondrial dysfunction yielding
  to an excessive ROS production that can activate ATM. Around 6 weeks of age, elevated
  [Ca2+]i increases the activity of the µ-calpain, inducing a degradation of spectrins
  at the inner membrane and a activation of Cdk5 through the cleavage of p35 in p25.
  Cdk5 migrates then in the nucleus to phosphorylate substrates and among them, ATM.
  P-ATM redistributes in the cytosol where it can act on channels amplifying the Ca2+.
  Later on, P-ATM activates p53 which induces the recruitment and increase in Bax
  and ultimately induces the downregulation of Bcl-2, causing apoptosis via mitochondrial-mediated
  mechanisms. Not shown in this figure are late stages of the neurodegenerative process
  that include the formation of intranuclear inclusions, and the possible participation
  of RAN-mediated events.
