caption: p38MAPK-MK2 axis is activated in response to diverse inflammatory stimuli.
  p38MAPK is a point of convergence for a wide diversity of intracellular signaling
  pathways triggered by pattern recognition receptors and receptors for cytokines
  and other inflammatory signaling molecules. Following activation of RAGE, (A) the
  p38MAPK-MK2 signaling axis is activated downstream of p21Ras, via MKK3/6 (; ). Activation
  of receptors in the IL1R superfamily (B), including the toll-like receptors, signal
  through MyD88 and IRAK, to phosphorylate TRAF6, which in turn activates MKK3/6 and
  then p38MAPK (; ). (C) Activation of TGFβR, meanwhile leads to activation of p38MAPK,
  via TAK1 phosphorylation of MKK3/6 (). This TAK1-dependent pathway is also activated
  downstream of TNFR1 and TLR3 activation, via RIP1 (). (D) Activation of TNF receptor
  1 activates p38MAPK via TRAF2 phosphorylation of MKK3/6.
