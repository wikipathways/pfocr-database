caption: Diagram of functional selectivity in GPCRs in the context of “mixture suppression”
  in mammalian ORs. (A) In the conventional model of GPCR activation, downstream signaling
  results from the OR being in an active or “on” state (R*) or in an inactive or “off”
  state (R). Agonists (Ag, green) increase the time the OR spends in the active (R*)
  state, whereas antagonists and inverse agonists (both represented by Ant, red) reduce
  the ability of agonists to increase the percentage of time the OR spends in the
  active (R*) state. Antagonism and inverse agonism in this model decrease the magnitude
  of activation of a single downstream signaling pathway. Response suppression of
  a single downstream pathway can also arise from weak (partial) agonists competing
  with full agonists (not depicted). (B) In the functional selectivity model of GPCR
  activation, the OR would have multiple distinct “active” states, in this context,
  2 (R*1 and R*2). The 2 active states couple the OR through 2 different G proteins
  (Gα olf; Gα o) to 2 different downstream signaling pathways, one mediating excitation
  and the other opposing it. The ligands activating each active state do so with variable
  efficacy. Stronger agonists (Ag, green, R*1) compete with weaker (partial) agonists
  (Ag, orange, R*1) to activate each state, but with the opposite functionality since
  the 2 states drive opponent signaling pathways. Mixtures of different agonists,
  therefore, result in different active conformations that selectively activate 2
  opposing signaling pathways. The ability to activate multiple pathways to different
  extents qualitatively changes the results of OR activation in a ligand-dependent
  or “biased” manner, with the net output reflecting the balance of signaling. ACIII,
  adenylyl cyclase class III; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Modified from .
