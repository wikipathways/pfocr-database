caption: Schematic representation of signaling pathways involved in the AVP-dependent
  myogenic differentiation. The stimulation of AVP-V1aR signaling in myogenic cells
  results in the activation of the CaMK and the calcineurin pathways. The AVP-dependent
  combined activation of both pathways results in the formation of multifactorial
  complexes on the promoters of muscle-specific genes and strongly stimulates myogenic
  differentiation. The V1aR is a G-protein coupled receptor, whose occupancy activates
  PI3K. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling by LY294002 results in mTOR, MEF2, and myogenin
  downregulation, affects the cellular localization of MEF2 preventing its nuclear
  translocation, upregulates the expression of FoxO3a leading to the activation of
  ubiquitin ligase atrogin-1, thus impinging upon the AVP-dependent myogenic differentiation.
  Additionally, the inhibition of the PI3K pathway by LY294002 represses the AVP-dependent
  HDAC4 nuclear export and, consequently, hampers the binding of multifactorial complexes
  (which include NFATc3 and MEF2) on the promoter region of muscle-specific genes,
  impinging on the full development of the differentiation program. Of note, recent
  evidence highlights that the Ca2+-dependent activation of the CaMK pathway stimulates
  Akt/mTOR signaling in normal and neoplastic B-lymphoid cells, suggesting a crosstalk
  between these signaling which may potentiate the myogenic effect of AVP (T-bars
  represent inhibition).
