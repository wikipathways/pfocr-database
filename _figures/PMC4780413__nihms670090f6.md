caption: 'Panel A. Along with GenePattern-based identification of candidate markers
  for stable function (SF) and rejection/injury (AR, CGI, and common AR-CGI), we used
  IPA for data mining on their interrelations and connections to the kidney-specific
  functions and the allograft-related signaling. Abbreviations for overlays: BM: biomarker;
  CP–canonical pathway, Fx–function, and Tx–toxicology list. Abbreviations for interactions
  (Panel A): A–activation; E–expression; I–inhibition; L–localization; RB–regulation
  of binding; P–phosphorylation; PP–protein-protein interactions; and T–transcription.
  Panel A designates possible interactions and their up-(pink) or down- (blue) regulation
  in corresponding marker category. Panel B shows possible interactions between the
  major identified marker PARP1 and its multiple interacting partners that can be
  related to the graft pathophysiology (PARP1, MAPK1 and NFATC1 highlighted). Both
  networks (Panels A and B) are created using Path Designer, IPA and are shown with
  the Role of NFAT in Regulation of the Immune Response Signaling and other kidney
  graft-related overlays.'
