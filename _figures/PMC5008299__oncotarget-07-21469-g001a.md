caption: Pathways and components include the electron transport chain (complexes I-IV),
  ATP synthase (complex V), uncoupling proteins (UCP), mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter
  (MCU), mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and proton motive force
  (PMF, made up of membrane potential and the proton gradient). A. The moment just
  before ionizing radiation-induced ROS (radROS) and Ca2+ arrive at and cross the
  membranes (blue pathways), showing normal, coupled respiration at moderate levels
  of O2 uptake and ATP synthesis, accompanied by moderate electron leak and mtROS.
  B. The moment just after radROS and Ca2+ (at physiological levels) stimulate transient
  depolarization, ATP synthesis and O2 uptake, leading to electron emission from the
  electron transport chain, mtROS surge on both sides of membrane and UCP partial
  uncoupling (blue pathway). Overload Ca2+ influx and excessive mtROS cause Ca2+ to
  leave the mitochondrion via the MPTP and lead to apoptosis (blue dashed pathway).
