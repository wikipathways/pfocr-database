caption: The model of apoptosis signaling induced by the combination of adenovirus
  5 early region 1A (E1A) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). E1A upregulates
  Bim expression through Egr-1 pathway, whereas SAHA upregulates Bim, as well as Egr-1
  expression by enhancing its promoter acetylation. Bcl-XL is downregulated by SAHA.
  The alterations of Bim and Bcl-XL expression contribute to Bax activation, cytochrome
  c release and subsequent caspase activation.
