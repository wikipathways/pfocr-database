caption: Mechanisms associated with epigenetic regulation/modification whereby iron
  shapes macrophage polarization. Iron supplementation may reduce miR-29a expression
  to block the activation of SOCS1/STAT6 signal pathway, inhibiting TAM polarization
  (A). Iron could promote M1-like macrophage polarization by increasing miR-214 expression
  (B). Iron could increase the enzyme activity of JMJD3 to demethylate H3K27me3, relieving
  the transcriptional silencing of LPS-induced genes and facilitating M1-like macrophage
  polarization (C). Iron might promote macrophages toward pro-inflammatory phenotype
  through demethylating H4K20me3 by enhancing the enzyme activity of HR23A (D). Iron
  deficiency might cause the loss of H3K9Ac and H3K4me3 to reduce hepcidin expression,
  inhibiting M1-like macrophage polarization (E). Iron deficiency inhibits M1 activation
  (e.g., pro-inflammatory responses) possibly through increasing HDAC1 binding to
  the related genes (F). Iron deficiency inhibits M1-like phenotype by lowering hepcidin
  expression via enhancing HDAC3 binds chromatin at the hepcidin locus (G). H3K27me3,
  histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation; H4K20me3, histone 4 lysine 20 trimethylation;
  HDAC, histone deacetylase; SOCS1, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1. “↑”, increase;
  “↓”, decrease. Question mark means that the mechanism needs experimental confirmation.
