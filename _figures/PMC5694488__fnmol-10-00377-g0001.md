caption: Schematic of NAD+ consumption during metabolism of glucose vs. ketone bodies.
  Both glucose and ketone bodies lead to the formation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA
  which subsequently enter the citric acid cycle and participate in energy production.
  Although glucose provides a higher final yield of ATP, the consumption of NAD+ is
  significantly higher in this pathway (4:1). Glucose will reduce 111 molecules of
  NAD+ per 1000 molecules of ATP made, while ketone bodies reduce only 41 to produce
  a comparable amount of ATP. Decreased use of NAD+ by ketone bodies in energy production
  pathways could increase the amount of free NAD+ available as substrate for enzymes
  and cellular signaling processes.
