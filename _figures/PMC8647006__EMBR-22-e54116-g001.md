caption: (A) Protein domain overview for the antagonistic players in DSB repair, 53BP1
  and BARD1‐BRCA1. ARD, ankyrin repeat domain; BRCT, BRCA1 C‐terminal domain; BUDR,
  BRCT domain‐associated ubiquitin‐dependent recruitment motif; CC, coiled‐coil domain;
  Oligo, oligomerization domain; RING, really interesting new gene (RING) ubiquitin
  E3 ligase domain; Tudor, tandem Tudor domain; UDR, ubiquitination‐dependent recruitment
  motif. (B) 53BP1 and BARD1‐BRCA1 are both multivalent chromatin readers, whose reader
  domains decode information about the occurrence of DNA damage (H2AK15ub) and replication
  status of damaged chromatin (H4K20me0 versus H4K20me2). Once recruited to damaged
  replicated chromatin through the BARD1 ARD and BUDR motif, BARD1‐BRCA1 reinforces
  a switch to HR repair through direct competition for 53BP1’s binding mark H2AK15ub,
  and through ubiquitylation of the C‐terminal tail of H2A at K125/127/129, which
  attracts the chromatin remodeler SMARCAD1 to relocate 53BP1 away from the break
  site. In a parallel pathway downstream of RNF8, the polyubiquitin sensor RAP80 promotes
  BRCA1 recruitment as part of the BRCA1‐A complex. (C) Whereas the RAP80‐mediated
  BRCA1 recruitment depends on the BRCA1 BRCT domain, in the absence of RAP80, the
  accumulation of BRCA1 around DSBs becomes critically dependent on its RING domain‐associated
  ubiquitin ligase activity. Combined deficiency in BRCT and RING domain abolishes
  BRCA1 recruitment as well as RAD51 loading and sensitizes cells to PARP inhibitors.
