caption: Pathway of type II de novo fatty acid biosynthesis showing key enzymes (boldface)
  and substrates. Enzymes belonging to the FAS complex are indicated by the box. The
  substrate for FAS, malonyl-CoA, is formed from acetyl-CoA by ACC. Fatty acid elongation
  consists of rounds of priming ACP with a malonyl moiety followed by condensation,
  reduction, dehydration, and reduction reactions that add two carbons to the growing
  acyl chain in each round. The first condensation reaction is catalyzed by FabH,
  and subsequent condensation reactions are catalyzed by FabB and/or FabF. Enzymes
  marked with an “X” are targets for inhibitory drugs that are the subjects of this
  investigation. FabD, malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase; FabB, FabF, and FabH, β-ketoacyl-ACP
  synthases I, II, and III, respectively; FabG, β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; FabZ, β-hydroxyacyl-ACP
  dehydratase; FabI, enoyl-ACP reductase.
