caption: Summary of the terpene and cannabinoid biosynthetic pathways in cannabis
  plants. The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway occurs in the plastid and generates
  isoprenoid pre-cursors, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate
  (DMAPP) from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. IPP and DMAPP can be used
  to produce hemiterpenes and geranyl diphosphate (GPP), which can lead to monoterpene
  and diterpene synthesis. GPP combined with olivetolic acid generated from fatty
  acids initiates the cannabinoid biosynthesis pathway starting with the production
  of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) and subsequent acidic cannabinoids, including cannabidiolic
  aicd (CBDA), cannabichromenic acid (CBCA), and tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA),
  catalysed by respective cannabinoid synthase enzymes produced by the plant. A percentage
  of the native acidic cannabinoids metabolise through decarboxylation to yield non-acidic
  by-products, e.g., cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromene (CBC), and tetrahydrocannabinol
  (THC); the latter of which can be further metabolised to cannabinol (CBN). The cytosolic
  mevalonate (MEV) pathway also produces DMAPP and IPP from acetoacetate-CoA-derived
  precursors to generate farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), which can be used to generate
  sesqui- and triterpenes. Terpenes can be converted to terpenoids via the P450 enzyme
  in the endoplasmic reticulum. The production of mono-, sesqui-, di-, and triterpenes
  involves reactions catalysed by a multitude of terpene synthase enzymes expressed
  by the plant to yield an abundance of different terpene compounds. Therefore, the
  cannabinoid and terpene profile of a cannabis plant is largely determined by the
  expression of its synthase enzymes. “Cannabis Leaves Weed Png” by Clipart.info is
