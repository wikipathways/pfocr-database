caption: Mechanism of GLP-1RAs in reducing macrophage inflammation and foam cell formation.
  Inflammatory factors such as M-CSF, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-18 attract monocytes to
  migrate and infiltrate in the vasculature of AS, differentiate into M1 macrophages,
  and activate the NF-κB signaling pathway, which mediates the generation of ROS.
  M1 macrophages accumulate and phagocytose oxLDL to become foam cells. NF-κB promotes
  the release of more inflammatory factors from the macrophages and activates NLRP3
  inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a crucial component of the innate immune
  system, inducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β/18, activating
  caspase-1 to promote GSDMD-mediated cellular pyroptosis. GLP-1RAs promote mitophagy
  in dysfunctional mitochondria and inhibit ROS production via the SIRT1/NOX4 signaling
  pathway, thereby inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. GLP-1RAs promote
  the transformation of M1 macrophages to M2 through inhibition of the CEBPβ/mTOR
  and MAPK signaling pathways and increase the proportion of M2 macrophages with anti-inflammatory
  functions. In addition, GLP-1RAs directly inhibits foam cell formation by downregulating
