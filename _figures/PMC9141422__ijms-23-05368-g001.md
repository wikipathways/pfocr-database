caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of gangliosides and sulfatide. GlcCerS catalyzes with
  the addition of glucose to ceramide, and LacCerS subsequently adds galactose to
  GlcCer to form LacCer. GalCerS catalyzes with the addition of galactose to ceramide
  to form GalCer, and CST subsequently adds a sulfate group to form sulfatide SM4.
  Red rectangles indicate phenotypes observed in mouse KO models. Expression of globo-type
  GSLs (highlighted by blue rectangle) is elevated substantially in fibroblasts of
  human GM3S-deficiency patients. In contrast, in GM3S KO-mouse brains and fibroblasts,
  expression of globo-type GSLs is only slightly elevated, but that of o-series gangliosides
  (GM1b, GD1α, GD1c: highlighted by yellow rectangle) is elevated substantially (see
  main text).'
