caption: 'Different Pathways of platelet activation in COVID-19.A) Direct interaction
  of virus with platelets: The SARS-CoV-2 - may engage with platelet receptors such
  as ACE2 and CD147 and activate various intracellular signaling pathways. Platelets
  also endocytose SARS-CoV-2 or its RNA, creating an inflammasome in which the AKT
  and P38-MAPK pathways are activated when SARS-CoV-2 RNA interacts with TLR7. Followed
  by TLR7 engagement with virus RNA, an adaptor protein, MYD88, activates other adaptor
  proteins such as IRAK1, IRAK4, TRAF6 (that activate AKT and P38-MAPK pathways),
  and TAK1, IKK, SNAP-23 (that lead to C3 release and C3-induced NETosis). Generally,
  these activating pathways lead to enhanced expression of P-selectin and CD40L, increased
  platelet-leukocyte interactions and PLAs formation. B). The effect of cytokine storms
  on platelets: Overexpression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α
  may activate jak2/STAT3 and its cross-talk with GPVI/collagen signaling, P38/MAPK,
  and NF-κB, respectively, leading to platelet hyperactivation. C) SARS-CoV-2-induced
  tissue/endothelial damage: DAMPs and mt-DNA released by damaged tissues and endothelial
  cells are sensed with TLR4 and TLR9 and activate NF-κB/PKC-ERK and IRAK1/PI3K-AKT
  respectively, leading to platelet activation D). Leukocyte-induced platelet activation:
  Leukocytes may activate platelets through their released mediators. Here, in a conserved
  milieu, leucocyte derived NET components and cathelicidin (interacting with TLR2,
  4, and GPVI, respectively), chemokines/chemoattractants (particularly PAF interacting
  with GPCRs) as well as ROS and proteolytic enzymes (that induce the generation of
  fibrin interacting with GPVI), promote platelet activation and pro-coagulant function.Abbreviations:
