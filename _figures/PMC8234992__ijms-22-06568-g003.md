caption: 'Possible interaction between astrocytes and dopaminergic nerve terminals.
  The optimal dopamine concentration is maintained in the striatum by the 2–4-Hz pace-making
  activity of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, this constant
  activity can elicit mitochondrial overload during oxidative metabolism, leading
  to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROSs). The reduced form
  of glutathione (GSH) plays an important role in eliminating ROSs. The synthesis
  of glutathione requires glutamine (Gln)/glutamate (Glu), which is supplied by astrocytes,
  as well as cysteine (Cys) and glycine (Gly), which are also derived from GSH released
  from astrocytes. Thus, neuronal GSH synthesis is largely dependent on astrocytes.
  After dopamine is released from the presynaptic terminals of dopaminergic neurons,
  it is taken up by Na+-dependent dopamine transporter (DAT) expressed in presynaptic
  neurons. However, the astrocytes that surround the synapses also seem to take up
  dopamine via two astrocytic Na+-dependent monoamine transporters: norepinephrine
  transporter (NET) and serotonin transporter (SERT). Increases in the intracellular
  Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) activate Na+, K+-ATPase, thereby enhancing glycolytic
  metabolism (aerobic glycolysis) in astrocytes. The increased lactate/pyruvate, end-products
  of glycolysis, then fuel the neuronal tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as energy substrates.
  In astrocytes, the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP), a shunt pathway of glycolysis,
  is co-activated; this process facilitates the conversion of NADP+ to NADPH. NADPH
  is necessary for glutathione reductase to eliminate ROSs, since glutathione peroxidase
  requires the reduced form of GSH converted from the oxidized form of glutathione
  (GSSG), which is dependent on NADPH. GSH released from astrocytes also plays an
  important role in diminishing dopamine-derived ROSs, since dopamine produces dopamine
  quinone and ROSs via auto-oxidation in the extracellular space. A rate-limiting
  enzyme of the PPP, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) dehydrogenase, is regulated transcriptionally
  by the Kelch-like enoyl-CoA hydratase-associated protein 1 (Keap1)/nuclear factor
  erythroid 2 p45 subunit-related factor 2 (Nrf2) system, which is a master regulator
  of the anti-oxygen stress response. The pharmacological activation of the Keap1/Nrf2
  system is expected to enhance astrocytic protective mechanisms against ROSs, leading
  to a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.'
