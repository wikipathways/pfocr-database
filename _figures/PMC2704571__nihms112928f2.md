caption: Diagrammatic representation of hormone therapy-induced changes in gene expression
  in the dorsal raphe block. Genes that exhibited a significant increase (p< 0.05,
  ANOVA) are shown in RED and genes that exhibited a significant decrease (p< 0.05,
  ANOVA) are shown in BLUE. Green blocks outline gene changes that were previously
  confirmed with qRT-PCR. Other information is shown in black. Arrows indicate downstream
  drive or activation, whereas t-bars indicate downstream blockade. Significant increases
  in expression were observed in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast
  growth factor receptor 2 (FGF-R2), nerve growth factor receptor associated protein
  (NGFR-AP), Ras protein-specific quanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1(RAS GRF),
  MAP kinase kinase 5 (MAP2K5), superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and in 2 ubiquinases (UCHL1
  and UBCH7). Also, gene expression significantly increased for 3 proteins called
  baculovirus IAP repeat containing 4 (BIRC4 or XIAP), BCL2-related protein (MCL-1)
  and bifunctional apoptosis regulator (BFAR) that are capable of inhibiting caspases.
  Significant decreases in expression were observed in members of the cytokine signaling
  pathway including chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), TGF-β receptor 3 (TGFβ3), tumor
  necrosis factor α induced protein (TNFAIP6), member 21 of the TNF superfamily (TNFRSF21),
  the prostaglandin F receptor (PTGFR) and Fas associated factor 1 (FAF1). Significant
  decreases were also observed in downstream effectors of cell death including p21-activated
  kinase 2 (PAK), MAP kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4) and nibrin (NBSI). The pro-apoptosis
  gene PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4) was significantly decreased as well. With qRT-PCR
  we previously found that expression of kynurenin mono-oxygenase (KMO), which produces
  neurotoxic metabolites of serotonin, and c-jun n-terminal kinase (JNK), which is
  an apoptosis effector, were significantly decreased in this mRNA preparation (green
  outline). We also previously found that E2F1 was significantly increased in this
  mRNA preparation (green outline). (reprinted from [])
