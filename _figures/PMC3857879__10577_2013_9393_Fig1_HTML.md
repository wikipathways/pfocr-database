caption: Schematic representation of the lncRNA-based chromatin silencing mechanisms
  controlling entry into sporulation in S. cerevisiae. Left box is a scheme of S.
  cerevisiae sporulation. When environmental conditions are compatible with rapid
  growth S. cerevisiae proliferates by mitotic divisions in either haploid or diploid
  state. Upon nutrient privation, haploid cells of opposite mating type (a or α) conjugate
  to form a diploid, which then undergoes premeiotic DNA replication and two rounds
  of meiotic divisions to produce an ascus containing four haploid spores. If the
  yeast is already diploid it proceeds directly to premeiotic DNA replication. Right
  box is a schematic overview of the control of sporulation induction at the molecular
  level that focuses mostly on the RNA-based chromatin silencing mechanisms implicated.
  RME1 encodes a transcription factor that binds to, and induces transcription of,
  IME1 promoter. Production of Rme1-dependent lncRNA, IRT1, promotes the recruitment
  of histone methyltransferases Set2 and Set3, to the IME1 promoter and blocks expression
  of IME1 presumably by establishing a repressive chromatin environment. Nutrient
  sensing and mating-type signaling pathways control expression of the master inducer
  of sporulation, the IME1 gene. To allow induction of sporulation the nutrient signaling
  pathways must stop repressing IME1 expression. In parallel, in haploid cells, the
  mating-type signaling pathway, by the intermediary of the a1/α2 heterodimeric transcription
  factor, represses expression of RME1. This leads to a block of IRT1 production and
  the activation of IME1 gene expression. Ime1 transcription factor contributes to
  the activation of a set of genes required for the premeiotic DNA replication. In
  addition, in haploid cells, another gene important for sporulation, IME4, is repressed
  by the production of antisense RNA, RME2. In this case, silencing is imposed by
  transcriptional interference and this silencing is relieved by the direct binding
  of the a1/α2 heterodimeric transcription factor to RME2 promoter, which blocks production
  of RME2. Green is used for pathways promoting sporulation; Red for pathways repressing
  sporulation. Clear gray circle nucleosome; dark gray circle RNA Polymerase II; red
  lollipop histone post-translational modifications H3K4me and H3K36me. See text for
  further explanations
