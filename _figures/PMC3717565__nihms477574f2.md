caption: The vascular •NO signaling cascade and the antagonizing •O2−. Agonist stimulation
  of endothelial cells, including angiotensin II, acetylcholine, serotonin, etc.,
  or shear stress causes activation of endothelial NO synthase by a transient increase
  in intracellular calcium or phosphorylation. •NO as a freely diffusible molecule
  can easily cross cell membranes and activate soluble guanylyl cyclase in smooth
  muscle cells, increasing intracellular cGMP levels. Protein kinase G is activated
  and can cause a decrease in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i and mediates the dephosphorylation
  of myosin light chain leading to vasorelaxation. Superoxide can react with and reduce
  free •NO, impairing the •NO-cGMP signaling pathway. Inactivation of soluble guanylyl
  cyclase by superoxide has been reported, too. Various superoxide sources in the
  endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells have been identified, including mitochondria,
  uncoupled NO synthase, xanthine oxidase, NADPH oxidases, and epoxygenase. Depending
  on the model and pathology, different sources of •O2− can be activated. (Ag = agonist;
  [Ca2+]i = intracellular calcium; NOS-3 = endothelial NO synthase; sGC = soluble
  guanylyl cyclase; •NO = nitric oxide; cGMP = cyclic guanosine monophosphate; Rec
  = receptor; •O2− = superoxide anion)
