caption: 'Integrated schematic of glycolysis, mitochondrial metabolism, and lipid
  pathways in NSCLC cells. This figure summarizes key metabolic processes in NSCLC
  cells, illustrating the interplay and compensatory mechanisms between glycolysis
  and OXPHOS, as well as the integration of lipid metabolism. Glucose is metabolized
  through glycolysis to produce pyruvate, which enters mitochondria to fuel the TCA
  cycle and OXPHOS for ATP production. Under certain conditions, pyruvate is diverted
  to lactate via LDHA. Glutamine contributes to TCA cycle intermediates through glutaminolysis,
  supporting biosynthesis and redox balance. Fatty acid metabolism is also reprogrammed
  in NSCLC: fatty acid synthesis, driven by enzymes such as ACC and FASN, converts
  citrate and acetyl-CoA into lipids, while FAO via CPT1a provides additional acetyl-CoA
  for mitochondrial respiration. Together, these interconnected pathways reflect the
  metabolic flexibility and adaptability of NSCLC cells in response to environmental
  and therapeutic pressures'
