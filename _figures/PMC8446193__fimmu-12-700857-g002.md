caption: Pathogenesis of chronic GVHD. Early after allo-HCT, donor-type CD4+, and
  CD8+ T cells including autoreactive CD4+ T cells are activated by host APCs in the
  lymphoid tissues. The majority of the injected alloreactive T cells differentiate
  into PSGL1hi Th1/Tc1 cells to cause acute GVHD. At the same time, some of the autoreactive
  CD4+ T cells differentiate into PSGL1loCD4+ pre-Tfh-like cells via IL-6-Stat3-BCL6
  pathway, and they interact with activated donor B cells to augment antibody production,
  and some of them remain PSGL1hi. The Th1/Tc1 cells infiltrate GVHD target tissues
  including thymus and bone marrow. Damage of thymic medullary epithelial cells (mTECs)
  leads to decreased generation of thymic Tregs (tTreg) cells and increased release
  of autoreactive T cells that are cross-reactive with donor antigen-MHC complex and
  host antigen-MHC complex. Damage of bone marrow microenvironment results in increased
  production of autoreactive B cells and reduced production of tolerogenic plasmacytoid
  dendritic cells (pDCs). Acute GVHD destroys lymphoid tissues. As acute GVHD subside
  into chronic GVHD, alloreactive pathogenic memory T, especially CD4+ memory T cells,
  that can cross-react with donor APCs become autoreactive CD4+ T cells and gather
  in the GVHD target tissue. The de novo-generated autoreactive CD4+ T cells from
  damaged thymus also infiltrate the GVHD target tissues. The autoreactive CD4+ T
  cells from both sources interact with donor-type APCs and become CD69+ tissue resident
  memory T (Trm) cells in the tissues. The PSGL1hi autoreactive Trm cells interact
  with DCs and macrophages to mediate pathogenesis via their production of cytokines
  such as TGF-β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-17, and IL-22. The pre-Tfh-like PSGL1loCD4+
  helper T cells interact with B cells to augment memory B-cell differentiation into
  plasma cells that produce IgG autoantibodies. IgG autoantibodies enter circulation
  and deposit in the GVHD target tissues such as skin to augment GVHD pathogenesis.
