caption: HSV1 manipulation of apoptosis. Execution of apoptosis restricts HSV1 replication
  and dissemination. The extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways differ with respect
  to the nature of the death signal as well as initiator caspase (see text). HSV1
  encodes an array of anti-apoptotic viral proteins to counteract apoptotic pathways.
  Virus-encoded ICP34.5 or Us11 limits the extrinsic apoptosis pathway by restricting
  dsRNA sensing pathways that would lead to activation of apoptosis through inhibition
  of protein translation. Virus-encoded ICP6 or Us5 block extrinsic apoptosis by preventing
  caspase 8 activation. Virus-encoded Us6 promotes NF-kB-dependent pro-survival signaling.
  Virus-encoded Us3 blocks both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis through interference
  with caspase 8 activity and an unknown step in mitochondrial death signaling, respectively.
  Us3 has also been shown to promote the expression of Bad to limit intrinsic apoptosis
  as does Us11 through restriction of cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Expression
  of the pro-survival BCL-2 gene of the intrinsic pathway also has been shown to be
  stimulated by virus-encoded ICP27 or ICP4. Finally, LAT manipulates the activation
  of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways specifically within the central
  nervous system by blocking inducer caspases 8 and caspase 9, respectively.
