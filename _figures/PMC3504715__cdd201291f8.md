caption: Cytokine-induced CITED2/MYC/E2F3/p21CIP1signaling in lung cancer. (a) Model
  of CITED2/MYC/E2F3/p21CIP1signaling. CITED2 expression is induced by TGF-α/EGFR
  through MYC. Elevated CITED2 levels further recruit p300 to the E2F3 promoter to
  enhance MYC-mediated transactivation, leading to increased G1/S cell cycle transition
  (left). TGF-β downregulates CITED2, and loss of CITED2 prevents MYC from interacting
  with HDAC1, causing activation of the p21CIP1 promoter and cellular quiescence (right).
  (b) Model of cytokine-induced homeostasis and neoplastic development of lung epithelial
  cells. Homeostasis of normal lung epithelial cells is intricately balanced by TGF-α/EGFR
  proliferation and TGF-β/TGFBR quiescence signaling, both of which are fine-tuned
  by CITED2 expression. Activation of MYC/CITED2/E2F3/p21CIP1pathway by abnormal cytokine
  signaling such as EGFR mutation/amplification-activation and TGFBRII silencing contributes
  to neoplastic development of lung epithelial cells
