caption: Schematic diagram illustrating potential mechanisms involved in the synergistic
  activation of cAMP signaling pathway by NO and IM. PDE3 and PDE4 are two major cAMP-degrading
  isoenzymes in mesangial cells. IM inhibits PDE4. On the other hand, NO activates
  sGC, causing the generation and action of cGMP. Combined inhibition of PDE3 and
  PDE4 by cGMP and IM results in increased intracellular cAMP, activation of PKA and
  induction of CRE activity, leading to changes in cell behaviours (such as Cx43 expression
  and growth inhibition). The synergistic activation of cAMP signaling is further
  augmented by IM-elicited expression of iNOS and production of NO.
