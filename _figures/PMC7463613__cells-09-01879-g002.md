caption: The Notch signaling pathway in cancerogenic events. The Notch pathway is
  implicated in a variety of tumorigenic processes. Specific receptors have been reported
  to facilitate tumorigenic events such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT),
  angiogenesis, maintenance of a hypoxic environment, proliferation, cancer stem cell
  self-renewal and immunomodulation.
