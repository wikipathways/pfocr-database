caption: Signaling pathways required for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) to stimulate
  pro-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. The EMCV coat protein, devoid of
  viral RNA, activates CCR5-dependent signaling in macrophages within minutes of treatment.
  The transcription factor NF-κB is required for the expression of iNOS, COX-2, and
  IL-1β, and at least one additional pathway that is selective for one of these target
  genes. iNOS expression is controlled by iPLA2β and occurs through PKA-dependent
  activation of the transcription factor CREB. COX-2 expression is controlled by the
  MAP kinases p38 and JNK, whereas IL-1β expression is controlled by the MAP kinase
  ERK and transcription factor PU.1.
