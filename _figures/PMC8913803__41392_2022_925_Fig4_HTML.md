caption: a Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and targeted therapy post MI. NRF2/HO-1 plays
  a crucial role in combating various oxidative stress responses and heart remodeling
  after MI. It exists in almost all kinds of cells in the body to maintain homeostasis
  and reduce oxidative stress. In addition, this pathway also plays an important role
  in stem cell therapy of MI and prognosis prediction of MI. KEAP1 kelch like ECH
  associated protein 1, NRF2 nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2,
  HO-1 heme oxygenase-1, ARE antioxidant responsive element, ROS reactive oxygen species.
  b RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway and targeted therapy post MI. RhoA switches back and
  forth between inactive GDP state and active GTP state, so as to play its biological
  role. ROCK is a downstream molecule of Rhoa. They all play a role in fibrosis, ventricular
  remodeling, and cardiac repair after myocardial infarction. Many drugs, including
  statins, can play their role in treating myocardial infarction by targeting the
  RhoA/ROCK pathway. RhoA Ras homolog family member A, ROCK Rho associated coiled-coil
  containing protein kinase, HIF-1α hypoxia inducible factor-1α, HMG-CoA hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA,
  GAP GTPase-activating protein, GDI guanine dissociation inhibitor, GDP guanosine
  diphosphate, GTP guanosine triphosphate, GEF guanine nucleotide exchange factor
