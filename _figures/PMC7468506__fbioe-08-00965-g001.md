caption: Schematic view of the metabolic pathway for the production of lipoic acid
  in engineered S. cerevisiae. Apo-Gcv3p is a substrate protein while octanoyl and
  lipoyl-Gcv3p are the two intermediates in the lipoic acid producing pathway. Lipoyl-Gcv3p
  is the lipoic acid bound subunit of glycine cleavage system (GCV). Lip2p and Lip5p
  work as catalyst enzymes. EfLPA is the cleaving enzyme for releasing lipoic acid.
  Sam2p is a cofactor regeneration enzyme required to regenerate the S-adenosyl methionine
  cofactor, as shown in the dotted box. Lip2p, octanoyltransferase; Lip5p, lipoyl
  synthase; EfLPA, lipoamidase from E. faecalis; Sam2p, S-adenosylmethionine synthase
  2. All reactions are in mitochondria.
