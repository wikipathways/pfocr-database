caption: Role of Esrrb in ESC self-renewal and reprogramming. (A) Self-renewal of
  ESCs is maintained by parallel signalling pathways. The primary role of the Wnt/Gsk3
  signalling axis is the activation of Esrrb, by abrogating the activity of its repressor,
  Tcf3. Gsk3i indicates small molecule inhibition of Gsk3. Esrrb is also a key target
  of Nanog, which itself is also regulated by the Wnt/Gsk3 pathway. Overexpression
  of Esrrb or Nanog can confer Lif-independent growth; however, Nanog's effect is
  dependent on the presence of Esrrb. Klf4 is an important target of the largely parallel
  acting Lif/Jak/Stat pathway. (B) Cross-regulation of targets by the pluripotency
  factors Esrrb (E), Oct4 (O), Sox2 (S), Nanog (N), and Tcf3 (T). Many pluripotency
  loci are bound by combinations of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, Tcf3, with or without Esrrb.
  However, Esrrb also has a large number of targets that are not occupied by the other
  four transcription factors. (C) Esrrb and reprogramming. In wild-type cells (‘presence
  of Nanog'), Esrrb expression can replace the function of Klf4 in the context of
  the Oct4-Sox2 reprogramming factor combination. Ncoa3, a co-activator of Esrrb,
  is essential for reprogramming mediated by Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4. Esrrb is also part
  of a recently identified non-canonical reprogramming mixture. In the absence of
  endogenous Nanog, Esrrb overexpression allows the conversion of EpiSCs and pre-iPSCs
  (generated by Oct4-Sox2-cMyc-Klf4 expression) to the iPSC state, and reprogramming
  of NSCs by fusion with ESCs. (D) Esrrb interacts with the basal transcriptional
  machinery through Ncoa3. Esrrb, Oct4, and Sox2 often bind at enhancers of genes,
  where they are recruited through their respective DNA motifs. The interaction of
  Esrrb with Ncoa3 appears essential to engage the transcriptional machinery at the
  promoter.
