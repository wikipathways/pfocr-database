caption: Simplified schematic overview of the BCL2-regulated and death receptor-mediated
  apoptosis and necroptosis signaling pathways. In the BCL2 pathway, interactions
  between pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 sub-family members determine whether the pro-apoptotic
  effectors BAK and BAX become activated. This results in increased mitochondrial
  permeability and cytochrome C (Cyt C) release, which, in turn, favors the formation
  of the death inducing apoptosome and ultimately Caspase-3 (CASP-3) cleavage by the
  initiator Caspase-9 (CASP-9). In the extrinsic pathway, binding of a death ligand
  to its death receptor leads to formation of the death inducing signaling complex
  (DISC) and activation of the initiator Caspase-8 (CASP-8). In the DISC, CASP-8 activity
  is restricted when CASP-8 binds to its inhibitor c-FLIP. Full CASP-8 activity in
  the absence of c-FLIP leads to CASP-3 cleavage, activation, and cell death by apoptosis.
  On the other hand, a minimal CASP-8 activity within the DISC is required to inhibit
  cell death via necroptosis. Loss of CASP-8 or inhibition of its enzymatic activity
  result in the formation of the necrosome including RIPK3, and ultimately activation
  and phosphorylation of the necroptosis executer MLKL. For reasons of simplicity,
  only key molecules of the different signaling complexes are highlighted. For further
  reading, we kindly refer the reader to reference []
