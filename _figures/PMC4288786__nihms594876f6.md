caption: The metabolism of cholesterol, methyl-branched fatty acids and odd-chain
  length lipids will raise the intracellular levels of the C3 compounds propionate
  or propionyl-CoA, which Mtb finds highly toxic. The bacterium has developed three
  different strategies to detoxify propionyl-CoA. Isocitrate lyase (icl1) activity
  has been suborned to fulfill the function of methylcitrate lyase in the last step
  of the methyl citrate cycle to generate the TCA cycle intermediate succinate. The
  methylmalonyl pathway has also been mobilized to metabolize propionyl-CoA to produce
  succinyl-CoA via the VitB12-dependent activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mutAB).
  Finally, intermediates from the methylmalonyl pathway can be incorporated directly
  into the abundant, methyl-branched lipids of the bacterial cell wall, such as PDIM
  and SL-1.
