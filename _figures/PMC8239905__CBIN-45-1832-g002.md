caption: Therapeutic options for treatment of COVID‐19‐related coagulopathy. Low‐molecular‐weight
  heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin which are considered as the first line
  of treatment, inhibit both extrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascades mainly through
  inhibition of thrombin function. Due to the interaction of inflammation and complement
  activation with the coagulation pathway, anticomplement and antiinflammatory agents
  may be also considered as drugs of choice. Anakinra, Tocilizumab, Infliximab and
  Adalimumab inhibit IL‐1, IL‐6, and TNF pathways, respectively, while AMY‐101 and
  Eculizumab function through inhibiting C3 and C5, respectively. COVID‐19, coronavirus
