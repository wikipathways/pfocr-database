caption: Multiple secondary structures at CFSs may progressively impede replication.
  Replication impairment can potentially be resolved by helicases such as WRN and
  RecQ1 (, ). TLS synthesis could also facilitate replication, or gap filling if structures
  are bypassed. If the replisome becomes uncoupled from the replicative helicase,
  ssDNA stretches can result in RPA binding, activation of stalled fork sensors, and
  ATR signaling. A stalled fork (top left side) can result in the approach of a converging
  fork from the opposite direction (top right side) that in turn could stall at other
  DNA structures or due to a transcription-replication collision, leading to an unreplicated
  area. Impaired replication can be resolved by structure-specific endonuclease (SSE)
  cleavage at secondary structures or at stalled and reversed forks caused by secondary
  structures. Cleavage of a stalled fork by MUS81-EME1/Mus81-Mms4 would result in
  a one-ended break that could engage in break-induced replication (BIR) using another
  chromosome as a template for repair (left pathway). Alternatively, broken fork repair
  (BFR) using the other sister chromatid as a template for repair or gap filling will
  result in conservative repair without loss of sequence (middle pathway). Cleavage
  of forks by MUS81/Mus81 at two stalled forks (blue arrows), or across the base of
  a 4-way junction (not shown), will result in a two-ended break, which can heal with
  fidelity (for example using homologous recombination (HR); middle pathway) or in
  a manner that results in deletions (for example by single strand annealing (SSA),
  non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), or microhomology-mediated end joining MMEJ; right
  pathway). Other SSEs (e.g. XPF-ERCC1/Rad1-Rad10 (pink arrows), or SLX1-SLX4/Slx1-Slx4
  (not shown)) may also be involved in cleavage. Gap filling or HR-dependent mechanisms
  require DNA synthesis, which can manifest as MiDAS if it occurs in M phase. Human
  proteins are listed first, with S. cerevisiae homologs after the slash.

  description: Multiple secondary structures at CFSs may progressively impede replication.
    Replication impairment can potentially be resolved by helicases such as WRN and
