caption: WKYMVm with angiogenesis and tissue repair. WKYMVm promotes homing and chemotactic
  migration of ECFCs, thereby accelerating neovascularization in ischemic limbs. WKYMVm
  promotes mobilization and homing of bone marrow CACs to the ischemic heart, which
  is conducive to neovascularization. WKYMVm and sirolimus continuously coated bare
  metal stents recruits circulating endothelial cells, enhances re-endothelialization,
  and inhibits restenosis. WKYMVm stimulates angiogenesis, promotes re-epithelialization,
  accelerates granulation tissue formation, and increases the CD68+ macrophages infiltration
  in early phase during wound healing. WKYMVm reduces ISG15 and TFEB expression, increases
  secretion of exosomes containing miRNA-146 in mBMSCs, and promotes the polarization
  of M2 macrophages. M2 macrophages enhance the formation of new blood vessels to
  promote bone defect repair. In addition, WKYMVm polarizes macrophages into M2 phenotype
  by activating JAK1/STAT6 signaling pathway. ECFCs, endothelial colony-forming cells;
  CACs, circulating angiogenic cells; ISG15, interferon stimulated gene 15; TFEB,
  transcription factor EB; mBMSCs, murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells;
  JAK1, Janus kinase 1; STAT6, signal transducer and activator of transcription 6.
