caption: Nodal signaling functions are partially separable according to the transcription
  factors used by the pathway. (A) FoxH1 is absolutely required for notochord specification
  and for the most anterior trunk somites, while Eomes is essential for nonaxial mesoderm
  induction upon loss of FoxH1 function. These two factors may cooperate in a wild-type
  embryo for normal nonaxial mesoderm induction, as loss of either alone does not
  have a significant impact on early marker expression (). (B) FoxH1 is not strictly
  required for the endoderm specification pathway, although it makes contributions
  to bon expression. Eomes is required both for bon initiation and for proper downstream
  endoderm marker expression, as has been demonstrated previously. (C) In the organizer,
  FoxH1, Eomes, and Bon function meet for full induction of marker expression and
  prechordal plate derivation.
