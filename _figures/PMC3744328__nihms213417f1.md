caption: 'SUMO proteins can be covalently conjugated to targets in the presence of
  SUMO E1 (SAE1/SAE2, heterodimer), SUMO E2 (Ubc9). The addition of SUMO E3 (PIAS
  proteins as an example) promotes the formation of poly-SUMO chains/activates additional
  SUMO site(s). SUMO proteins are released by SENPs from their conjugated state with
  the associated target and are thereby ready for a new round of conjugation (de-conjugation).
  Regulation of cellular activities: The dynamic sumoylation process is implicated
  in a number of cellular activities, including cell cycle, DNA repair, transcription,
  and chromatin remodeling. The factors shown under each category of cellular activity
  are SUMO substrates and described in this review.'
