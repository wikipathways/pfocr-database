caption: Model for the Regulation of STOP1 Function and Stability by SUMOylation.STOP1
  is mono-SUMOylated at three sites, K40, K212, and K395, presumably through the SUMOylation
  pathway. The STOP1 SUMOylation is reversible, and it can be deSUMOylated by the
  SUMO protease ESD4, which is increased in response to Al stress. Mutation of ESD4
  elevates STOP1 SUMOylation levels and consequently increases and decreases the association
  of STOP1 with the promoters of AtALMT1 and AtMATE, respectively, which causes the
  increased AtALMT1 expression and the reduced expression of AtMATE and RAE1, and
  finally contributes to the increased Al resistance. Mutation of STOP1 SUMOylation
  at K40 increases AtALMT1 and decreases AtMATE expression, which leads to reduced
  Al resistance. Mutation at K212 does not affect STOP1 function and Al resistance.
  Blocking of STOP1 SUMOylation at K395 or all three (K40, K212, and K395) sites reduces
  STOP1 protein level and the expression of AtALMT1 and AtMATE, leading to the decreased
  Al resistance.
