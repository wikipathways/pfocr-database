caption: Pathways for therapeutic drug absorption via the oral route. (A) Protein
  therapeutic entering the bloodstream via the transcellular pathway (passing through
  epithelial cells). (B) By altering or disrupting the tight junctions, proteins are
  able to transport to the bloodstream via the paracellular pathway (in between adjacent
  cells). (C) Proteins may also enter the bloodstream via transcytosis or cell receptor
  mediated endocytosis. There is significant literature currently studying this pathway
  of entry. (D) By entering the M cells of the Peyer's patches, protein may be absorbed
  into the lymphatic system. Here, antigens can interact with antigen presenting cells
  (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells), which are critical for elicitation of protective
  immunity.
