caption: A proposed mechanism of action of ER stress‐prolonging agent Salubrinal on
  IBC cells. Cellular stress causes unfolded proteins to accumulate in the ER lumen.
  Chaperone dissociation leads to the activation of the PERK arm of the UPR. PERK
  is a transmembrane protein that serves as an ER stress sensor and activator of the
  UPR. PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, thereby inhibiting global translation and selectively
  promoting ATF4 and CHOP translation, stress-inducible transcription factors. Salubrinal,
  an eIF2α phosphatase inhibitor, activates the PERK arm of the UPR. Upregulation
  of CHOP, a proapoptotic transcription factor downstream of PERK and ATF4, demonstrates
  a potential antitumor strategy of Salubrinal in IBC cells. Salubrinal-treated IBC
  cells are driven to caspase-3 mediated cell death. Salubrinal treatment-induced
  cellular ROS and downregulated IBC cell proliferation, which could be rescued upon
  treatment with antioxidant along with Salubrinal. There may be CHOP-mediated induction
  of ROS or ROS is the outcome of upregulated oxidoreductases and protein oxidation
  in the IBC cells.
