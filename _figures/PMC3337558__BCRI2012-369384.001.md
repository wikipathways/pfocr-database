caption: Mechanistic diagram showing the effect of abnormal regulation of TCTP/Cdc25C/Cdk1
  pathway in HCC development. (Upper panel) Under the normal mitotic progression,
  Cdc25C activates Cdk1 by the dephosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 in Cdk1. The level
  of active Cdk1 is a key factor for maintaining the mitotic state and functions as
  a key switch for cell division. (Lower panel) During the HCC development, TCTP is
  overexpressed in over 40% of HCC cases. Overexpression of TCTP promotes the ubiquitin-proteasome
  degradation of Cdc25C, which leads to the failure in the dephosphorylation of Cdk1
  on Tyr15 and decreases Cdk1 activity. As a consequence, the sudden drop of Cdk1
  activity in mitosis induces a faster mitosis exit and chromosome missegregation,
  which leads to aneuploidy and CIN, finally causing cancer development.
