  A Priming of NLRP3 with TLR. B Activation of the NF‑κB pathway induces the transcription
  of NLRP3 and pro‑IL‑1β. C–H Components of drusen activate the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  C Ox-LDL can induce a large amount of ROS, targeting the CD36 receptor, thereby
  causing lysosomal disruption following cathepsin release, or promoting the ATP/P2X7R/Ca2+
  influx pathway to activate NLRP3. D Complement components: C1Q initiates lysosomal
  rupture and release of cathepsin B to activate NLRP3 assembly, while C5a and C3
  send priming signals to NLRP3 without a clear mechanism. E, F Aβ1-40 increases intracellular
  ROS via NOX4 and mitochondrial electron transport chain to activate NLRP3. G Aβ1-40
  acts as a priming signal to activate the NF-κB pathway, which upregulates the transcription
  of NLRP3, pro-IL-18, and pro-IL-1β. H MicroRNAs: miR-191-5p is downregulated after
  Aβ1-40 stimulation, subsequently leading to an increase in C/EBPβ levels, resulting
  in the upregulation of NLRP3; miR-223 and miR-22-3p suppress NLRP3 expression. I
  Alu RNA due to DICER1 deficiency increases ROS production; Alu RNA-induced NF-κB-mediated
  NLRP3 activation and P2X7R signaling control NLRP3 inflammasome priming and activation,
  respectively. J ATP outflow via connexin43 hemichannels acts as a NLRP3 inflammasome
  signal 2 activator. K A2E, a major fluorophore in lipofuscin, activates NLRP3 by
  causing lysosomal damage and release of cathepsins into the cytoplasm. L Membrane

  inflammasome downstream of the Aβ1-40 priming signal. M The mature form of IL-18
  mediates the activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases 1 and 4 (IRAK1
  and IRAK4), which contributes to RPE cell death'
