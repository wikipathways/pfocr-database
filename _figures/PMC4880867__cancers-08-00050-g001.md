caption: Fzd7 receptor complexes and signalling output. (A) Fzd7 (Fz7) can associate
  with Lrp5/6 to transmit canonical Wnt signaling from ligands including Wnt3. However
  RNF43/ZNRF3 ubiquitylates Fzd7 and targets it for internalisation and protesomal
  degradation, thus resulting in turn-over of the receptor complex and low canonical
  Wnt signaling; (B) In the presence of Lgr4/5, and RSPO it is RNF43/ZNRF3 which is
  internalised and degraded and thus Fzd7/Lrp5/6 remains on the cell surface to transmit
  Wnt signalling and canonical signalling output is high; (C) Fzd7 can associate with
  Ror2 or Ryk to transmit non-canonical Wnt signals from ligands including Wnt5 or
  Wnt 11, either via PCP or Ca2+; (D) Fzd7 can associate with G Protein α (GP α) to
  transmit signals from Wnt8 via the PCP pathway; (E) Fzd7 can associate with Syndican4
  (Sdc4) and R-Spo to transmit Wnt5a signals via internalisation of the whole receptor
  complex and ligand which then activates PCP signaling.
