caption: Schematic overview of polyamine (PA) metabolism with interconnection to other
  metabolic routes. Put biosynthesis may follow three pathways, of which the citrulline
  (Cit) pathway is reported so far only in sesame plants, where arginine (Arg) is
  catalyzed by Cit decarboxylase (CDC). The other two main routes include a direct
  conversion from ornithine (Orn) to Put by the action of ODC, and another indirect
  pathway with three steps, where ADC, AIH, and NCPAH sequentially decompose Arg,
  agmatine (Agm), and N-carbmoyl-Put, to finally generate Put. In both spermidine
  (Spd) and spermine (Spm) synthesize pathways, the aminopropyl moieties derived from
  dcSAM are required, which derived from SAM and catalyzed by the SAMDC enzyme. PA
  oxidases (PAOs, exhibiting apoplastic activity) catalyze an oxidation-back-reversion
  reaction (BC-type reaction) to generate H2O2 that allows “Spm to Spd and to Put”
  retroconversion. Another catabolite of Put is Δ1-Pyrroline triggered by diamine
  oxidase (DAO). In this pathway, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), NO, and proline (Pro)
  are generated, and NO inhibits ODC activity. Regarding cellular PA-homeostasis,
  besides free soluble and non-covalently conjugated forms, PAs may also bind to proteins
  and other molecules to protect the macromolecules, regulate transporter/channel
  activity and gene expression, or interact with some hormones. This metabolism presentation
  of PAs in the plant is partially adapted from the studies by  and .
