caption: Schematic illustration of the hypothesis that Toxoplasma infection alters
  miRNA pathway leading to brain carcinogenesis. The miRNA synthesis pathway is mediated
  by multiple protein complexes that sequentially cleave, export and incorporate miRNA
  into the silencing machinery. miRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II or III and
  this pri-miRNA is processed by Drosha–DGCR8 (Pasha) complex to pre-miRNA, which
  is exported from the nucleus by Exportin-5 to the cytoplasm. The RNase Dicer is
  associated with the double-stranded RNA-binding protein TRBP and the PKR activator
  PACT processes the pre-miRNA hairpin to 22-nt miRNA duplexes. One strand of mature
  miRNA is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) along with Argonaute
  (Ago2) proteins and it directs RISC to silence target mRNAs through mRNA cleavage
  or translational repression while the complementary strand is degraded. This pathway
  is tightly regulated at transcriptional and post transcriptional level. The miRNA
  stability and post translational modifications are used to modulate the functionality
  of the miRNAs. Proteins of miRNA processing complexes also play a crucial role in
  regulating the miRNA processing pathway. We hypothesize that effector molecules
  released by Toxoplasma into the host cell may interfere with miRNA synthesis and
  maturation pathway, which in turn modulate host cell survival or death signaling
  pathways.
