caption: AMPK-mTOR axis in the co-regulation of autophagy and immunometabolism. AMPK
  pathway primarily activates mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation,
  and induces autophagy through the activation of ULK1 and inhibition of mTOR pathway.
  AMPK activation by AICAR, metformin, ornithine or GABA exhibits antimicrobial effects
  against Mtb infection in macrophages. ESRRA is one of the AMPK-downstream signaling
  molecule which functions as an important transcription factor of ATGs and energy
  metabolism. Upon lysosomal damage, cytosolic lectin LGALS9 dissociates deubiquitinase
  USP9X from TAK1 and promotes K63-mediated ubiquitination of TAK1, thus leading to
  the activation of AMPK pathway. Whereas, the mTOR pathway activation promotes aerobic
  glycolysis and contributes Mtb to escape from autophagic degradation in host cells
  by blocking ULK1 complex formation. Meanwhile, mTOR signaling is closely related
  to HIF-1α expression in the regulation of immunometabolism during infection and
  aerobic glycolysis in both normal and cancer cells. Several anticancer drugs, such
  as ibrutinib and everolimus, induce autophagy and repress Mtb growth via inhibition
  of mTOR pathway in macrophages. In addition, succinate, an intermediate of TCA cycle,
  stimulates IL-1β production via HIF-1α activation in LPS-exposed macrophages.
