caption: '(A). Top 10 canonical pathways emerged after IPA core analysis. Threshold
  indicates the minimal significance level [scored as–log (B-H p-value) from Benjamini-Hochberg
  procedure for multiple testing correction]. (B). Overlapping canonical pathways
  that were significantly enriched in this dataset. B-H p-value was listed below each
  pathway. (C). Network #1 from significantly enriched canonical pathways displaying
  proteins involved in the network. Proteins identified in the network were colored
  in red. Blue lines connected interacting proteins in the Coagulation System. (D).
  Network #1 from significantly enriched canonical pathways displaying proteins involved
  in the network. Proteins identified in the network were colored in red. Blue lines
  connected interacting proteins in the Acute Phase Response Signaling. (E). Network
  #2 from significantly enriched canonical pathways displaying proteins involved in
  the network. Proteins identified in the network were colored in red. Blue lines
  connected interacting proteins in the Acute Phase Response Signaling. (F). Network
  #2 from significantly enriched canonical pathways displaying proteins involved in
  the network. Proteins identified in the network were colored in red. Blue lines
  connected interacting proteins in the IL-12 signaling and production in macrophages.
  Significantly different proteins (q<0.2) were marked by *.'
