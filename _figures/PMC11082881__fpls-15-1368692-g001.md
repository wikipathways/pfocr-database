caption: Ethylene biosynthetic pathway. Methionine serves as the precursor of ethylene,
  and it is catalyzed by SAM synthetase to format S-AdoMet (SAM) at the expense of
  one molecule of ATP per molecule (Bürstenbinder et al., 2007). Subsequently, SAM
  is metabolized into 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by ACC synthase
  (ACS) (Pattyn et al., 2021). Additionally, SAM can be diverted to methylthioadenosine
  (MTA), which can be recycled back to methionine via α-keto-γ-methylthio-butyric
  acid (KMB) through the Yang cycle (Bürstenbinder et al., 2007). Finally, the catalytic
  action of ACC oxidase (ACO) converts ACC into ethylene, initiating downstream ethylene
  sensing and signaling (Yoon and Kieber, 2013). Furthermore, various transcription
  factors, ubiquitin ligases, regulators, and environmental stresses are involved
  in regulating the expression of ACS and ACO expression (Lyzenga and Stone, 2012;
  Pattyn et al., 2021)
