caption: Changes that can occur in the glycolytic pathway in COVID-19. When immune
  cells are resting, glucose is metabolised via the glycolytic pathway, yielding pyruvate
  as a product. This substrate is subsequently used in the tricarboxylic acid cycle
  (TCA) to form intermediates that will be processed by oxidative phosphorylation
  to produce 32 molecules of ATP, for each molecule of glucose. When immune cells
  are activated or hypoxic, glucose metabolism is reprogrammed. There is an increase
  in the type 1 alpha hypoxia-inducing factor (HIFa), which inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase
  enzyme complex (PDH). Pyruvate is thus transformed into lactate by the action of
  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). But this mechanism motivates the capture of more glucose
  for the synthesis of further ATP molecules. There is also activation of the pentose
  phosphate (PPP) pathway that produces ribose and NADPH. The latter can be used by
  immune cells through the actions of NADPH oxidase to produce reactive oxygen species
  (ROS).
