caption: Figure 2. Endosomal trafficking of unliganded Notch receptor. A diagram of
  the known endosomal routes of the Notch receptor that was not activated by ligand
  binding. The precise step in the endocytic pathway where the Ubiquitin ligases Su(Dx)
  and Dx function is not clear. Their locations in the diagram are meant to indicate
  the process for which each is required. See text for explanation of diagram. ee
  = early endosome, re = recycling endosome, Hrs protein is required to deliver proteins
  to MVBs. Other abbreviations are defined in the text.
