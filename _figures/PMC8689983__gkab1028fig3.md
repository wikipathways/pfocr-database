caption: The IDG portal incorporates new features to help users visualize potential
  functions of understudied (‘dark’) proteins in the context of Reactome pathways.
  The screenshot shows some of these features, including level of knowledge of each
  displayed protein as a drug target (i.e. Tclin, target of drugs with known mechanism
  of action, Tchem, target of drugs (no mechanism), Tbio, well-characterized protein
  not known to be targeted by any drug, Tdark, poorly characterized protein not known
  to be targeted by any drug, http://juniper.health.unm.edu/tcrd/, overlaying pairwise
  relationships from different resources (e.g. BioGrid, BioPlex and StringDB), and
  a new network view.
