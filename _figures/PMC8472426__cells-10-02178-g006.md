caption: HSPB1 inhibits ER stress-induced cell death by modulating UPR, protein ubiquitination,
  and protein degradation rate via the proteasome. The UPR is activated by stress
  to restore cellular homeostasis. (Upper panel) Under conditions of intense and prolonged
  stress, UPR activates mechanisms of cell death by increasing the expression of proapoptotic
  proteins such as CHOP and proteins of the BH3-only family. (Bottom panel) HSPB1
  overexpression in mouse pancreatic islets promotes increased PERK phosphorylation,
  as well as attenuation of eIF2α phosphorylation, ATF4 and cleaved ATF6 levels, the
  IRE1α pathway, and expression of proapoptotic mediators CHOP and BIM. This process,
  associated with an increase in protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system,
  allows keeping cellular proteostasis under control, thus avoiding the activation
  of proapoptotic signaling pathways.
