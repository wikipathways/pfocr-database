caption: Signal transduction in the SA signaling pathway. When SA level is low, NPR1
  exists as oligomers in the cytoplasm. Upon the rise in SA levels, thioredoxins (TRXs)
  promote NPR1 monomerization and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus. NPR1
  undergoes phosphorylation and then SUMOylation. Phosphorylated and SUMOylated NPR1
  forms a complex with the transcription factor TGACG-binding TF2 (TGA2), ENHANCED
  DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1), histone acetyltransferases (HATs), and Mediator,
  thereby activating the expression of PR genes. TCP7 drives the expression of TGA2.
  NPR1 activity is modulated by NPR3/4, which promotes NPR1 ubiquitination and in
  turn degradation
