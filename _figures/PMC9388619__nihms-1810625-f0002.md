caption: (A) Timeline summarizing discoveries which contributed to the development
  of the canonical regulation of G1/S progression. (B) Basic schematic of canonical
  G1/S control wherein mitogenic and oncogenic signals converge on CDK4/6–cyclin D
  activity. Although these factors support the assembly and activation of the complexes,
  select oncogenic signaling can induce p16INK4A to yield oncogene-induced senescence.
  The activation of CDK4/6 initiates the phosphorylation of RB and enables the subsequent
  activation of CDK2/cyclin E that contributes to the hyperphosphorylation and functional
  inactivation of RB. p27KIP1 plays a complex role in CDK4/6 activation state, but
  is a potent CDK2 inhibitor. With RB inactivation, E2F-mediated transcription elicits
  a program of gene expression to drive progression through the remainder of the cell
  cycle. Adapted from [].
