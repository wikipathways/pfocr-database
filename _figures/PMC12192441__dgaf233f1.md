caption: 'Signaling pathways of activins and other TGFβ related ligands in adipocytes.
  Activin A and B bind to the type II receptors, ACVR2A or ACVR2B. The type II receptors
  phosphorylate the type I receptors, ALK4 or ALK7. The type I receptors then phosphorylate
  SMAD2/3. Phosphorylated-SMAD2/3 complex with SMAD4 and accumulate in the nucleus
  to inhibit Pparγ and Cebp transcription in concert with other transcription factors.
  Activins C and E and GDF3 activate a similar signaling pathway but exclusively utilize
  ALK7 as their type I receptor (Nodal and Cripto contribute to GDF3 signaling but
  are not pictured). BMPs bind to several type II receptors, including ACVR2A, ACVR2B,
  and the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2). These receptors phosphorylate
  the type I receptors ALK1, ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6 to stimulate SMAD1/5/8 signaling
  in adipocyte precursors to promote preadipocyte commitment. Follistatin and inhibins
  are negative regulators of some of these ligands. Figure created in BioRender.Abbreviations:
  ACVR2A, activin type II receptor A; ACVR2B, activin type II receptor B; ALK, activin
  receptor-like kinase; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; GDF, growth differentiation
