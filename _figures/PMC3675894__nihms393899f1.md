caption: Overview of the HH signaling network. HH signaling is initiated upon binding
  of a HH protein to its receptor PTC, which de-represses SMO. In the canonical pathway,
  SMO activation leads to increased transcriptional activity of the GLI family of
  transcription factors. GLI-independent actions of PTC and SMO are collectively known
  as “non-canonical” signaling.
