caption: E2F gene regulatory pathway. Schematic representation of the pathway initiated
  upon stimulation of cell growth that leads to an induction of cyclin D/cdk4 activity.
  A primary target for D/cdk4 is the Rb protein, inactivating its ability to regulate
  the accumulation of E2F proteins. Previously identified E2F targets include replication
  enzymes, proteins that form the initiation complex, and activities that regulate
  the function of the origin complex. The data presented here now identify additional
  genes (indicated in bold) that fall within these previously defined groups as well
  as new groups as indicated. pol, polymerase; Enh, enhancer; Rib. red., ribonucleotide
  reductase; thy., thymidine.
