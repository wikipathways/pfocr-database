caption: 'Putative biosynthetic pathway of cordycepin in C. militaris.The dual biosynthesis
  of cordycepin (COR) and pentostatin (PTN) is initiated by the enzyme Cns3, which
  contains two domains: an N-terminal nucleoside/nucleotide kinase (NK) domain and
  a C-terminal HisG family ATP phosphoribosyltransferase domain. The precursor adenosine
  is phosphorylated by the NK activity of Cns3 to form 3′-AMP, which is then hydrolyzed
  to 2′-C-3′-deoxyadenosine (2′-C-3′-dA) by Cns2, a metal-dependent phosphohydrolase.
  This intermediate is finally reduced to COR by the oxidoreductase Cns1. PTN production
  involves the HisG domain of Cns3, which inhibits adenosine deaminase (ADA) to prevent
  COR deamination to 3′-deoxyinosine'
