caption: Molecular mechanism underlying LINC01133 regulated pancreatic cancer progression.
  LINC01133 expression was enhanced in pancreatic cancer cells. It’s overexpression
  downregulated DKK1 by inducing the methylation of DKK1 promoter. The decrease in
  DKK1 expression activated the Wnt signaling pathway, thus promoting the proliferation,
  migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells.
