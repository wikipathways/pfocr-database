caption: 'Pivotal role of the NGF/TrkA signaling pathway in PDAC. NGF binds to two
  receptors: low-affinity p75NTR and high-affinity TrkA receptors. NGF binding to
  a TrkA receptor mediates proliferation, differentiation, and survival via the activation
  of the Ras/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and PLCγ pathways. NGF binding to the p75NTR receptor
  activates JNK and NF-κB. These mediate opposing effects of survival and apoptosis,
  respectively. Beyond NGF, several other neurotrophic molecules such as BDNF, NT-3,
  and NT-4/5 play a role in nerve growth. BDNF and NT-4 bind to the TrkB receptor
  and NT-3 to the TrkC receptor. GDNF binds to the GFR-α1-RET receptor. Effects of
  NGF increase the nociceptive ion channels, receptors, and peptides, such as BR,
  Na, Ca, K, CGRP, SP, BDNF, TRPV1, ASIC3, and p75. The red arrows show possible sites
  of NGF/TrkA signaling pathway inhibition. 1: NGF antagonists; 2: inhibitors of NGF
  binding to TrkA, and 3: TrkA inhibitors. Abbreviations: TrkA, tropomyosin receptor
  kinase A; NGF, nerve growth factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; neurotrophin-3
  (NT-3); neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5); TrkB, tropomyosin receptor kinase B; TrkC, tropomyosin
  receptor kinase C; GDNF, glial-derived neurotrophic factor; BR, bradykinin receptor;
  Na, sodium; Ca, calcium; K, potassium; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; SP,
