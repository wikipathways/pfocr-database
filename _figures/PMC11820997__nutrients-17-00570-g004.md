caption: Summary of the role of selected olive oil components in T2DM progression.
  Specific components of olive oil, notably oleate, and hydroxytyrosol, inhibit the
  progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by addressing essential risk factors
  like β-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance, and persistent hyperglycemia. These
  compounds decrease inflammation and combat oxidative stress, which are key factors
  in developing T2DM, and enhance insulin sensitivity by activating insulin signaling
  pathways. Components of olive oil protect pancreatic β-cells and improve glucose
  metabolism, slowing the evolution of T2DM and promoting better metabolic health
