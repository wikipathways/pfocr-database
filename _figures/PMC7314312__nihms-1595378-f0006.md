caption: ROS in the form of hydrogen peroxide can activate the PI3K-AKT pathway through
  inactivation of protein phosphatases, including PTP1B, which attenuates the activity
  of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate (IRS), and PP2A, which normally
  dephosphorylates T308 on AKT, thus leading to enhanced AKT phosphorylation and activation
  in response to ROS. ROS also inhibits the lipid phosphatase PTEN, resulting in accumulation
  of PIP3 and activation of AKT. AKT activation can facilitate the adaptation to ROS
  by activating the NRF2 transcription factor, which stimulates numerous enzymes to
  mount an antioxidant response. Downstream of AKT, GSK3 phosphorylates NRF2 and marks
  it for ubiquitination by the β-TRCP E3 ligase, leading to subsequent proteasomal
  degradation. Thus, through its inhibition of GSK3, AKT signaling can stabilize NRF2.
  NRF2 is stabilized and activated by ROS via cysteine oxidation of the E3 ligase
  Keap1, thereby disrupting its binding of NRF2. AKT also directly phosphorylates
  and inhibits the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT, which transports cystine into
  cells that, upon NADPH-dependent reduction to cysteine, can be used to produce glutathione
  for ROS neutralization. xCT and the enzymes of glutathione synthesis are encoded
  by gene targets of NRF2 as part of its anti-oxidant response.ROS, Reactive oxygen
