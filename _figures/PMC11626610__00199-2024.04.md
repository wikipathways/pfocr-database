caption: Genes from the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway remain differentially
  expressed 8 h post 4th dose in MAD cohorts. A KEGG (Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes
  and genomes) diagram is a computerised representation of a biological pathway and
  its components. Genes and gene families within the plot are represented within the
  Pan Cancer Immune Profile Panel shown in colour or are in grey. Genes and gene families
  known to be involved in the pathway but not represented within the panel are shown
  in white. Genes and gene families that are overexpressed in the KEGG pathway are
  shown in shades of orange (log2 fold-differences 0 to 2.5). Representative figure
  for MAD cohort 3 (300 mg dose) D-10 (8 h post-dose). Data on KEGG graph rendered
  in Pathview
