caption: There are two ways that COVID-19 can cause an inflammatory response. COVID-19
  antigens can directly bind onto toll-like receptors, or a COVID-19 infected cell
  can release inflammatory cytokines, which bind to the cytokine receptor on a different
  cell. These two processes lead to the phosphorylation of NF-kB-IkB, which causes
  NF-kB to locate into the nucleus and promote the transcription of inflammatory genes.
  Inflammatory cytokines are then created, which leads to further inflammation of
  other cells. Convalescent plasma can bind to the COVID-19 ACE-2 receptor binding
  domain to prevent COVID-19 from entering cells and replicating. If COVID-19 has
  already entered the cell, the drug remdesivir could be employed to inhibit RNA-dependent
  RNA polymerase, which can prevent the replication of the virus. Finally, glucocorticoids
  could be used to block the NF-kB pathway, leading to decreased expression of inflammatory
  genes.
