caption: Significant metabolic pathways identified from the analysis under high pressure
  and low temperature conditions. Metabolites identified by a comprehensive analysis
  combining metabolomics and transcriptomics approaches are included in the highlighted
  pathways. The change trends in metabolite concentrations and gene expressions are
  shown for further insight
