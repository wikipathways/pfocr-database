caption: 'Potential mechanism of MSCs in the treatment of BLM-induced lung injury.
  ①MSCs reduce BLM-induced epithelial cell necrosis or apoptosis by inhibiting oxidative
  stress response, and further reduce the production of inflammatory mediators such
  as cytokines and chemokines. MSCs promote the expression of TLR-4 in alveolar epithelial
  cells, trigger the lung regeneration signal of HA-TLR-4, and promote the regeneration
  and repair of alveolar epithelial cells. ② Immunomodulatory effects of MSCs: MSCs
  reduce the expression and density of CD80 costimulatory molecules in macrophages
  and dendritic cells, and reduce their ability to induce antigen-specific T cell
  immune response; MSCs promote the transformation of macrophages to M2 phenotype,
  reduces the inflammatory potential, and increases the synthesis and secretion of
  MMP-9, which contributes to the degradation of extracellular matrix, including collagen;
  MSCs reduce macrophages and dendritic cells the expression of chemokine (lymphotoxin,
  CCL21, CXCL12, CXCL13), thus reducing the B cells to recruit; ③Direct induction
  of apoptosis of activated T cells through Fas/FasL signaling pathway alleviates
  abnormal excessive immune response; ④ MSCs inhibit epithelial mesenchymal transformation
  (EMT); ⑤ MSCs inhibit the activation of TGF-β/SMAD-3 signaling pathway, thus inhibiting
  the activation of myofibroblasts and further reducing the synthesis of collagen
  and other extracellular matrix (ECM)'
