caption: 'Hedgehog signaling pathway. In the resting state, PTCH1 inhibits SMO, which
  in turn prohibits the activation of GLI. Upon binding SHH with PTCH1, the surface-membrane
  protein SMO is disinhibited, resulting in the nucleus-bound upregulation of GLI1
  and, consecutively, tumor formation. In the case of HHI binding to SMO, GLI1 upregulation
  is disengaged. Abbreviations: GLI1: glioma associated oncogene 1; HHI: hedgehog
  inhibitor; PTCH1: Patched; SMO: smoothened; SHH: sonic hedgehog'
