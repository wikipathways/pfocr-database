caption: 'Model of two hypothetical signaling pathways whereby eATP could induce an
  increase in [Ca2+]cyt. In this model, two potential receptors could initiate the
  signaling pathway. The one starting with P2K1 is much better documented and supported
  by published data, whereas the one starting with a postulated (and as yet unknown)
  receptor is supported only by indirect evidence. The sequence of signaling steps
  initiated by P2K1 would include: 1, the binding of ATP to the plasma membrane-localized
  P2K1 receptor, thus activating its protein kinase activity; 2, the receptor-induced
  phosphorylation and activation of the RBOHD subunit of NADPH oxidase; 3, increased
  accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the extracellular matrix (ECM);
  4, ROS-induced opening of calcium channels; 5, increase in the [Ca2+]cyt. This increase
  could then further activate RBOHD to synthesize more ROS (Steps 6 and 7). The sequence
  of signaling steps initiated by the postulated unknown receptor would include: 1′,
  the binding of ATP to the receptor; 2′, activation of Gα; 3′, the direct or indirect
  induction of Ca2+ channel activity by Gα; and 4′, increase in the [Ca2+]cyt. There
  is also evidence for an as-yet unidentified pathway whereby receptor activation
  leads to the release of Ca2+ from internal stores, such as vacuoles and mitochondria.
  Dotted lines indicate steps mediated by as-yet unknown mechanisms.'
