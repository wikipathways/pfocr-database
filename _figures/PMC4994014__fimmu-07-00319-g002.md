caption: B-cell activation and differentiation. Plasma cells are the main executors
  of B-cell regulation by the IL-21signal pathway. STAT3 is the dominant member of
  the STAT family in this respect. Transcription Blimp-1 has a positive role and BCL-6
  a negative role in plasma cell maturation. Additionally, CD40L, ICOS, CD86, and
  BAFF can promote B-cell differentiation to plasma cells, while MHC, CIITA, Pax5,
  and c-myc are switched off during B-cell differentiation to plasma cells or memory
  B-cells, and XBP-1 is induced. The transcription factor BCL-6 activates BTB, which
  is required for cell survival and proliferation, while RD2 prevents terminal differentiation
  of B-cells.
