caption: Proposed mechanisms in cisplatin-induced auditory cell damage. Cisplatin
  induces ototoxicity through two different pathways. One is mediated by IL-4 and
  IL-13 cytokine signaling and subsequent STAT6, but NF-κB-independent pathway. Another
  is mediated primarily by TNF-α cytokine, which activates NF-κB signaling.
