caption: Inhibiting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  signaling pathway with napabucasin is illustrated. STAT proteins are located in
  the cytoplasm in resting cells as inactive proteins. Phosphorylation of a specific
  tyrosine residue is essential for STAT activation. Once activated, STAT dimerizes,
  leading to its translocation into the nucleus, which then leads to the initiation
  of transcription. Napabucasin inhibits the STAT3, β‐catenin (β‐CAT), and NANOG signaling
  pathways and inhibits the critical genes necessary for maintaining stemness.
