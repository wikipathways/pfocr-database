caption: 'Inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, are released by activated macrophages
  and other immune cells when TLRs and NLRs are activated upon immune challenge. These
  mediators are detected by sensory components of the afferent arm of the inflammatory
  reflex (red). Neuronal interconnections between the NTS, AP, DMN, NA, and higher
  forebrain regions (not shown) integrate afferent signaling and efferent vagus nerve-mediated
  immunoregulatory output. Efferent vagus nerve cholinergic output to the spleen,
  liver and gastrointestinal tract (blue) regulates immune activation and suppresses
  pro-inflammatory cytokine release (dotted red lines). Efferent vagus nerve fibers
  interact with the splenic nerve to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine release in
  spleen – a major organ source of TNF and other pro-inflammatory cytokines in endotoxemia
  and other inflammatory conditions. This efferent cholinergic arm of the inflammatory
  reflex is termed the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and can be activated
  in the brain through mAChR-mediated mechanisms triggered by M1 mAChR agonists and
  other mAChR ligands, and AChE inhibitors, such as galantamine. Abbreviations: AChE,
  acetylcholinesterase; AP, area postrema; DMN, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus
  nerve; LPS, lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin); mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor;
  NA, nucleus ambiguus; NLRs, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors;
  NTS, nucleus tractus solitarius; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4. (Adapted from [])'
