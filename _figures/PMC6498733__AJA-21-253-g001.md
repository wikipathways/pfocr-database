caption: 'Beta-adrenergic signaling pathway in prostatic cancer. When beta-adrenergic
  receptors on prostate cancer cells are activated by epinephrine or norepinephrine,
  cellular cAMP level is increased. cAMP level in prostate cancer cells is also elevated
  by cancer treatments, such as radiation and hormonal therapies. cAMP activates PKA
  and EPAC. PKA can either directly stimulate or act through PAK4 to increase CREB
  activity. Activated PKA/CREB axis contributes to several biological processes relevant
  for cancer progression, such as (1) promoting angiogenesis through induction of
  VEGF, and repression of TSP1 and PAI2 through inducing HDAC2 and GRK3; (2) promoting
  NED, at least in part through direct induction of ENO2 as well as GRK3 that in turn
  elevates neuroendocrine markers in prostate cancer cells; (3) inhibiting apoptosis
  through CREB-induction of BCL2, and PKA-mediated phosphorylation of BAD (inhibiting)
  and AKT (activating); (4) together with EPAC, regulating cytoskeletal rearrangement
  and cellular migration through regulating ROCK activity via RhoA and PAK4. cAMP:
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA: protein kinase A; CREB: cAMP response element-binding;
  VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; NED: neuroendocrine differentiation; TSP1:
  thrombospondin 1; PAI2: plasminogen activator inhibitor-2; HDAC2: histone deacetylase
  2; GRK3: G-protein receptor kinase 3; BCL-2: B-cell lymphoma-2; BAD: BCL-2-associated
  death promoter.'
