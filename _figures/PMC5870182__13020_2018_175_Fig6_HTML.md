caption: A schematic diagram illustrating the mechanism of WYHZTL formula in regulating
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. When Wnt protein binds to the transmembrane frizzled
  receptor (Frizzled family member, Frz) and co-receptor LRP on the cell membrane,
  cytoplasmic disheveled (Dsh) inhibits activity of the Glycogen synthase kinase 3β
  (GSK3β) which causes the depolymerization of β-catenin destruction complex-Axin/APC/casein
  kinase Iα (CKIα)/GSK3β. The degradation of β-catenin is inhibited, then enriched
  in the cytoplasm and entered into the nucleus, which interacts with transcription
  factor T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer (TCF/LEF) to form a transcription complex
  that initiates downstream target genes expression. The target genes include cyclin
  D1, survivin, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which results in activation
  and transformation of fibroblast to myofibroblast. At last, the excess deposition
  of extracellular matrix (ECM) leads to the occurrence of skin fibrosis. In our present
  study, we reveal a mechanism of WYHZTL formula in inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway which can ameliorate skin fibrosis in Bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model
