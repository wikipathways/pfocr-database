caption: The metabolic pathways in osteoblast affect signal transduction. Glucose,
  fatty acids and glutamine are metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle in
  mitochondria to produce citric acid, which is metabolized into acetyl-CoA in the
  cytoplasm. Part of acetyl-CoA enters the nucleus to participate in the acetylation
  of histones and regulate the expression of related genes. A portion of acetyl-CoA
  participate the ß-catenin acetylation which regulate the expression of osteogenic
  genes. Glucose produces UDPGlcNAc through the hexosamine pathway, which participates
  in the O-GlcNA modification of osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 and regulates
  the expression of osteogenic genes. In addition, ROS produced during mitochondrial
  OXPHOS inhibits osteogenesis by stimulating the expression of adipogenic genes.
  In addition, ROS further influences the energy metabolism phenotype in osteoblasts
  by regulating HIF through multiple pathways. α-Kg produced by glutamine and TCA
  cycles promotes osteogenic differentiation by means of histone methylation and JNK
  and mTOR/S6K1/S6 pathways.
