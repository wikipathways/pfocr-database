caption: Metabolic pathways associated with adaptation to excess glycerol and mycobacterial
  biofilm formation. (A) Slow-growing mycobacteria respond to excess glycerol by reprogramming
  the respiratory chain, downregulating ATP production, and boosting the glycolysis
  [see (B) for details]. The pyruvate is proposed to be assimilated into at least
  four pathways (indicated by box). Proteomics-revealed enzymes participating these
  pathways were colored (green for upregulation and red for downregulation under excess
  glycerol). The uptake of glutamine by GlnQ is proposed to occur in the presence
  of extracellular glutamine. The activation of these pyruvate-assimilating pathways
  not only prevents the overaccumulation of pyruvate (and thus the toxic methylglyoxal)
  but also may promote mycobacterial biofilm growth. (B) Both the glycolytic pathway
  and methylglyoxal detoxification pathway are enhanced in the presence of excess
  glycerol, leading to enhanced production of the end product pyruvate. Related proteins
  identified by proteomic analysis were indicated and colored. In particular, PckA,
  catalyzing predominantly the gluconeogenesis, was downregulated. Mdh, malate dehydrogenase;
