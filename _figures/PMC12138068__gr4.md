caption: Ubiquitination, SUMOylation, methylation and collagen-related diseases. (A)
  S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe) increases the polyubiquitination of collagen I, thereby
  inhibiting its synthesis. Cortisol promotes the ubiquitination of COL3A1. This process
  can be blocked by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitor PYR-41. Smurf2 is recruited
  to the TGF-β1 receptor complex via Smad7, leading to the ubiquitination and degradation
  of the TGF-β1 receptor, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of collagen I. TRIM13 promotes
  the ubiquitination and degradation of CHOP, directly inhibiting collagen synthesis
  and indirectly inhibiting it by suppressing the TGF-β pathway. Monoubiquitination
  of MT1-MMP enhances its degradation of collagen I and increases cell invasion. (B)
  UBC9 can promote collagen expression through the TGF-β and NF-κB signaling pathways,
  while UBC9-shRNA plasmid and siRNA can inhibit this process. Overexpression of SENP2
  reduces collagen expression by inhibiting the TGF-β and Wnt signaling pathways.
  Conversely, siRNA-mediated SENP2 silencing can reverse this process. (C) AMI-1 reduces
  PRMT1 levels, thereby decreasing histone H4R3 methylation, and inhibiting collagen
  expression. PRMT3 increases the levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine in the cytoplasm,
  leading to decreased expression of collagen I. PRMT5 can increase collagen I expression
  through the PRMT5/FGFR3/Akt pathway and the PRMT5/EGFR/AKT/β-catenin pathway, promoting
  cancer cell EMT. G9a binds to the Neuron-Restrictive Silencer Element on the COL1A1
  promoter, catalyzing histone H3K9 dimethylation and reducing collagen I expression.
  Homocysteine (Hcy) downregulates G9a expression, reversing this process. EZH2 promotes
  histone H3K27 methylation, thereby enhancing collagen synthesis. Conversely, JMJD3
  inhibits this process
