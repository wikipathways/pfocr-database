caption: 'Autophagy proceeds constitutively at a low basal rate in most cells, and
  can be induced to high levels in response to starvation, loss of growth factor signaling,
  and other stressors. The TOR signaling pathway plays a central role in many of these
  responses. The kinase activity of TOR is inhibited by Tsc1 and Tsc2, which form
  a complex with GAP activity against the small GTPase Rheb, a direct activator of
  TOR (). The Tsc1/Tsc2 complex in turn is regulated by several upstream protein kinases,
  including Akt in response to insulin signaling and AMPK in response to AMP/ATP levels.
  Downstream of TOR, the protein kinases Atg1 and S6K have important roles in autophagy,
  but the relevant substrates of these kinases have not been determined (; ). In addition,
  both Atg1 and S6K inhibit TOR signaling through negative feedback loops (; ). Signaling
  levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in response to starvation
  and are required for activation of the autophagy-specific protease Atg4 (). Starvation
  also inhibits the association of Beclin 1/Atg6 with Bcl-2, leading to increased
  autophagic activity of Beclin 1 (). Abbreviations: AMP, adenosine monophosphate;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; GAP, GTPase activating
  protein; S6K, p70 S6 kinase; Tsc, tuberous sclerosis complex.'
