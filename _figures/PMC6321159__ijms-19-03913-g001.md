caption: Regulation of bicarbonate secretion in cholangiocytes. Separate signaling
  pathways that regulate secretion have been identified in large and small cholangiocytes.
  In large cholangiocytes, secretin receptors (SRs) on the basolateral membrane link
  to formation of cAMP, which leads to the activation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulators (CFTRs), causing apical Cl− efflux. This also stimulates
  exocytic release of ATP into the ductular lumen, through a mechanism that has not
  yet been identified. Luminal ATP then binds to apical P2Y receptors to stimulate
  intracellular Ca2+ release via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor isoform 3 (ITPR3),
  which in turn activates Cl− secretion through TMEM16A in the apical membrane. The
  resulting Cl− gradient across the apical membrane drives the AE2 Cl−/HCO3− exchanger,
  resulting in net HCO3− secretion. This pathway can also be activated directly by
  biliary ATP secreted from upstream hepatocytes. Alternatively, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (InsP3) formed from the stimulation of the M3 muscarinic receptor can stimulate
  secretion, although there is some evidence that this may act through Ca2+ released
  from ITPR1 and ITPR2 rather than ITPR3. Small cholangiocytes lack SRs and CFTRs,
  but have the same apical calcium signaling machinery to link to HCO3− secretion
  that is found in large cholangiocytes. Figure modified in part from References [,].
