caption: (a) Newly synthesized RHO family GTPases are geranylgeranylated and then
  post-translationally modified by the protease Ras-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1) and
  by isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) at the cytoplasmic face of
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). (b) After geranylgeranylation, RHO proteins associate
  with RHO specific guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RHOGDIs), which sequester
  them in the cytosol and protect them from degradation. (c) Free prenylated cytosolic
  RHO GTPases are unstable and are rapidly degraded by the proteasome. (d) Several
  RHO GTPases can associate with RHOGDI and compete for its binding. Overexpression
  of a GTPase can displace the endogenous RHO proteins from RHOGDI targeting them
  for degradation. (e) The rate of cycling of the RHOGDI -RHO GTPase complex between
  the cytosol and the membrane can be regulated by post-translational modifications
  on both the RHO GTPases and the RHOGDI, which modulate the affinity of the interaction.
  A slower pathway for recycling RHO proteins through vesicle trafficking has also
  been postulated. (f) Once at the membrane, the RHO GTPases can be activated by guanine
  nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and bind to downstream effectors. Following inactivation
  by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), RHO GTPases are extracted from the membrane
  by RHOGDI. (g) Active RHOA can also be targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin
  ligase SMAD ubiquitylation regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1). GGTase, geranylgeranyl
  transferase.
