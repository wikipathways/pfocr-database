caption: Model depicting cascade of the anti-inflammatory effect of ciprofloxacin
  and levofloxacin, targeting TLR4–MD-2 complex. LBP facilitates transfer of LPS monomers
  to CD14, which subsequently shifts the endotoxin to TLR4/MD-2 complex, then leading
  to formation of TLR4/MD2/LPS ternary complex and its subsequently dimerization.
  Dimerization of the receptor complex induces the activation of intracellular signaling
  pathways that involve NF-κB activation and lead to production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (left panel). Fluoroquinolones, such as CPFX and LVFX, exert anti-inflammatory
  activity, through the inhibition of TLR4/MD2/LPS ternary complex formation, receptor
  dimerization, and NF-κB nuclear translocation (depicted in light colors in the right
  panel), resulting in a decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CD14
  cluster of differentiation 14, CPFX ciprofloxacin, IL-1β interleukin-1 β, LBP LPS
