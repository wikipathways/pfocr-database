caption: CP-25 regulates the function of various cells, influencing the numbers of
  B-cell subtypes, Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance, FLS-secreted cytokines and FLS proliferation,
  EC activation, macrophage polarization, and DC maturation. The anti-inflammatory
  and immunomodulatory functions of CP-25 are attributed to its target, GRK2, which
  is a multifunctional hub of signaling networks and GPCR pathways. In addition, CP-25
  can also inhibit the BAFF-induced TRAF2/NF-κB pathway. CP-25 has been proven to
  be effective in improving the clinical manifestations of arthritis in animal models
  and ESS in mice, but further clinical trials are needed. The role of CP-25 in immune,
  inflammatory and GRK2-related diseases is also worthy of further study. BAFF B-cell-activating
  factor, NF-κB nuclear transcription factor-κB, TRAF2 tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
  factor 2, RA rheumatoid arthritis, pSS primary Sjögren’s syndrome, MS multiple sclerosis,
  AS ankylosing spondylitis, ACD allergic contact dermatitis, PsA psoriasis arthritis,
  SLE systemic lupus erythematosus.
