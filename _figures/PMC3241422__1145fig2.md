caption: The CWI signaling pathway. Signals are initiated at the plasma membrane (PM)
  through the cell-surface sensors Wsc1, -2, -3, Mid2, and Mtl1. The extracellular
  domains of these proteins are highly O-mannosylated. Together with PIP2, which recruits
  the Rom1/2 GEFs to the plasma membrane, the sensors stimulate nucleotide exchange
  on Rho1. Relative input of each sensor is indicated by the width of the arrows.
  Additional regulatory inputs from the Tus1 GEF and the Pkh1/2 protein kinases are
  indicated. The various effectors of Rho1 include the β-1,3-glucan synthase (GS),
  β-1,6-glucan synthase activity (not shown), formins (Bni1), Sec3, and the Pkc1-activated
  MAPK cascade. Mlp1 is a pseudokinase paralog of Mpk1 that contributes to the transcriptional
  program through a noncatalytic mechanism. Two transcription factors, Rlm1 and SBF
  (Swi4/Swi6), are activated by the pathway. Skn7 (dashed line) may also contribute
  to the CWI transcriptional program. (Inset) Thin-section electron micrograph of
  a Pkc1-depleted cell that has undergone cell lysis at its bud tip. Conditions were
  as described in .
