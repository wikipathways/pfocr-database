caption: (A) Homoharringtonine (HHT) causes phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor
  4E (p-eIF4E) to SUMOize more fully. Furthermore, the activity of Mcl-1, the target
  molecule of HHT-mediated p-eIF4E degradation, can be significantly decreased. (B)
  The relationship between cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and its partners was broken
  when HHT attached to the CDK2 protein. Subsequent interaction with tripartite motif
  21 (Trim21) led to the autophagy-lysosome system-mediated degradation of the CDK2
  protein. (C) The choline metabolism route is intimately linked to the HHT drug efficacy
  mechanism, and AL162417.1 has been identified as a critical gene. The ether lipid
  metabolism route is intimately linked to the HHT resistance mechanism, and PLA2G2D
  and LPCAT2 have been identified as key genes. (D) Notch, P53, and NF-KB signaling
  pathway-related molecules might be markedly upregulated by HHT alone. In contrast
  to the considerable suppression of HHT-induced activation of the NF-KB pathway,
  arsenic trioxide (ATO) coupled with HHT further increased P53
