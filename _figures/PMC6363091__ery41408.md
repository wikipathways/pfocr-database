caption: Proposed model for ERF19 and NINJA roles in PTI. MAMP perception initiates
  PTI repression signaling, triggering the induction of ERF19, in parallel with PTI
  activation signals. Accumulation of ERF19 may transcriptionally induce negative
  regulators of PTI, which are likely to be involved in the suppression of PTI signaling.
  PTI responses such as callose deposition, induction of PDF and PR genes, and MAMP-induced
  growth arrest are turned down by the ERF19-mediated pathway. The repressor NINJA
  provides another layer of control on PTI signaling through negative regulation of
  ERF19 function.
