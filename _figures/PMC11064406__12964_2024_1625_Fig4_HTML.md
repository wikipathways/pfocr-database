caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of cuproptosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying
  cuproptosis involve several key processes facilitated by copper ions. i. Cu(II)
  outside the cell are reverted to Cu(I) by a reductase enzyme. This oxidization-reduction
  form of copper is then transported into the cell by CTR1. ii. Copper is handled
  by various chaperone proteins to prevent toxic accumulation inside cell. ATP7A/B
  can pump excess copper out of the cell or deliver it to the Golgi apparatus for
  incorporation into copper-dependent enzymes. iii. Copper plays an essential role
  in several biochemical pathways inside the mitochondria. Here, it is involved in
  the ETC, which is a series of protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial
  membrane. iv. The copper chaperone COX17 delivers copper to the mitochondrial enzyme
  complexes, such as COO for their proper function. The mitochondrion matrix contains
  several enzymes, including LIAS and DLAT, which are part of the TCA cycle. v. FDX1
  is involved in the transfer of electrons in metabolic processes and is believed
  to interact with copper ions directly or indirectly affecting the TCA cycle. vi.the
  presence of mitochondrial DNA suggests that changes in copper homeostasis might
  impact mitochondrial genetics and, consequently, the function of organelle. Abbreviation:
  ETC, electron transport chain; IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane; mtDNA, mitochondrial
  DNA; LIAS, Lipoic Acid Synthase;DLAT; Dihydrolipoamide S-Acetyltransferase'
