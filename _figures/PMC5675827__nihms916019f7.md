  . Values were converted to log2 ratios of experimental/control and entered into
  a Comparison Analysis in IPA. The top 2 Networks (interactomes) are shown. Network
  names are also shown. Proteins with elevated values from the array are depicted
  in red. For B, signaling proteins with known involvement in the UPR are highlighted
  in gold. The “scores” listed are -log [p values] and are based on the probabilities
  of random associations of these genes/proteins. The significance threshold is set
  at by default as 1.25. “Focus molecules” refer to nodes from which networks initiate.
  Solid blue lines show direct connections between proteins found in the array; these
  are well-known or literature-documented interactions. Broken lines represent indirect
  connections arising from speculation, or via known intermediaries. Light blue/turquoise
  lines connect identified proteins within the network with other proteins were not
  part of the array. Line lengths (“edges”) between the protein “nodes” correlates
  to the amount of supportive literature documenting those interactions. Please note,
  we have shortened numerous edges to fit the interactomes into the figure.
