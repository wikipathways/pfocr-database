caption: Summarization of biological function by a Concept Ontology. The 38 phrases
  describing the pathway in  were hierarchically clustered based on their semantic
  relations using the CLiXO algorithm. These phrases were organized into six major
  concepts. We list two of the journal articles, Mao et al. and Rotin et al.,, contributing
  to the concepts ‘lung disease’ and ‘epithelial cell’.
