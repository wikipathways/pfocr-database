caption: Major components of the Intestinal Barrier. (A) In the small intestine, Paneth
  cells secrete chemical barrier molecules, including antimicrobial peptides, that
  primarily help to separate gut microbiota from IECs. The gut microbiota triggers
  the activation of NK cells, ILC3 cells and CD4+ T cells by activating DC in the
  intestinal lamina propria. NK cells can secrete various cytokines (such as INF‐γ
  and TNF‐α) that help enhance the function of other immune cells and promote the
  repair of intestinal epithelial cells. The activation of ILC3s and CD4+ T cells
  can promote the secretion of mucus, AMPs and IgA in plasma cells and induce the
  production of chemical barrier molecules from IECs. In addition, CD8+ T cell activation
  induced by CD4+ T cells plays an inhibitory role in intestinal infection. (B) In
  the colon, the mucus layer consists of a polymerized MUC2 mucin mesh structure that
  separates a large number of gut microbiota from IECs. Lypd8 inhibits bacterial invasion
  of the mucosa by binding to gut microbiota, resulting in the separation of microbiota
  from IECs. In addition, connective molecules between intestinal epithelial cells,
  including tight junctions, block microbiota invasion through paracellular pathways
  and also constitute an important physical barrier to the gut. AMPs, Antimicrobial
