caption: 'High: in the absence of FZC18, Wnt3a increases β-catenin signaling. Low:
  FZC18 binds Wnt3a and FZD receptors, blocking Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in
  an SFRP-like mode of action. Rescued: FZC18 inhibitory effects can be partially
  rescued by increasing the number of FZD receptors at the cell surface.'
