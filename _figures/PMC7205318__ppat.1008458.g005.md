caption: 'Model showing the role of Hyd in the expression of the Akirin-dependent
  genes in the IMD pathway. After activation of the pathway, allowed by the K63-polyUb
  chains deposition on the complexes IMD and DREDD by the E3-ubiquitin ligase Diap2,
  Relish is translocated. Hyd is necessary for the K63-polyUb of the NF-κB co-factor
  Akirin and its interaction with the NF-κB factor Relish. This interaction is crucial
  for the expression of Akirin-dependent genes (like Attacin-A and Attacin-C), necessary
  for an adequate innate immune response. DAP-PGN: meso-diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycan
  of Gram-negative bacteria, P-tag: phosphorylation marks.'
