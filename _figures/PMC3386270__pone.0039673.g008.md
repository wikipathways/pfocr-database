caption: Our data showed that the STAT6 and IRS-2 pathways are activated in mouse
  eosinophils in response to IL-4 (black oval) but to a lesser degree by IL-13. Engagement
  of CCR3 by eotaxin-1 (white oval) activates G-proteins leading to activation of
  PI3K isoforms and other signaling pathways. The two pathways may intersect to enhance
  migration in the activation of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which
  leads to cytoskeletal rearrangement and enhanced chemotaxis. IL-4/STAT6 has been
  implicated in spreading/movement of B-cells via Rho GEFs . IL-4 is also known to
  upregulate adhesion molecules involved in extravasation/chemotaxis – this may be
  due to activation of STAT6-mediated transcription or activation of the AKT pathway
  downstream of IRS-2.
