caption: A scheme of the photoperiodic control of nymphal development in the cricket
  Modicogryllus siamensis. NSC; neurosecretory cells. Dark red and blue lines indicate
  long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) pathways, respectively. LDs stimulate Ms’myo expression
  during the fifth to seventh instar stage, which suppresses Ms’jhamt expression and
  reduces JH synthesis, leading to adult emergence. SDs suppress Ms’myo expression
  and stimulate Ms’jhamt expression during the same stage, which increases JH production,
  resulting in nymphal molts, hence leading to slow nymphal development. Temperature
  regulates the growth rate through the insulin/TOR signaling pathway to accelerate
  or slow down at higher or lower temperatures, respectively. Slow development for
  overwintering is most likely maintained by short photoperiods and cold temperatures
  during autumn to winter. For further explanations, see text.
