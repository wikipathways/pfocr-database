caption: Double role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.  Yellow rectangles
  show mediators of the molecular pathway of initiation of  atherosclerosis synthesis,
  the stages between them are connected by brown lines.  Pink rectangles designate
  the atherogenic pro-inflammatory pathway triggered by  IL-6, further stages are
  connected by red lines, the dark burgundy line designate  a stronger signaling pathway
  relative to the weaker pale pink one. Green  rectangles designate the atheroprotective
  anti-inflammatory pathway triggered by  IL-6, further stages are connected by green
  lines. Crosses designate inhibition  of this molecular pathway. TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor alfa; IL,  interleukin; NLRP3, NOD-like receptor protein 3; MAPK, mitogen-activated  protein
  kinase; TIMP, matrix metalloproteinase; gp130, glycoprotein 130; Nf-κB,  nuclear
  factor-κB; sIL-6R, soluble IL-6  receptor; mbIL-6R, membrane-bound IL-6 receptor;
  MyD88, myeloid differentiation  primary response gene 88; TLR, toll-like receptors;
  oxLDL, oxidized low density  lipoprotein; JAK, Janus kinase; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; STAT,  signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling
