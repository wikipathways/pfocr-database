caption: The initiation and activation of inflammasome of NLRP3, and the production
  process of IFN-I. Specific PRRS (such as LPS, IL-1, and TNF-α) activate the NF-κB
  signaling pathway by recognizing PAMPs, and the body’s own DNA or RNA by recognizing
  DAMPs. Activation of NF-κB signaling causes NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18 to upregulate
  and activate NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, recruiting and activating pro-caspase-1.
  Activated caspase-1 cleaves the pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  into mature IL-1β and IL-18. RNA or DNA can also turn on the downstream MyD88, which
  increases the expression of IRF-3 and IRF-7 leading to IFN-I production, and IFN-1
  prompts macrophages to become foam cells. DAMPs = damage-associated molecular patterns,
  IFN-I = type I interferon, IL-1β = interleukin-1β, IL-18 = interleukin-18, IL-1
  = interleukin-1, IRF-3 = interferon regulatory factors-3, IRF-7 = interferon regulatory
  factors-7, LPS = lipopolysaccharide, MyD88 = myeloid differentiation factor 88,
  NF-Κb = nuclear factor kappa-B, NLRP3 = NLR family Pyrin domain-containing protein
  3, PAMPs = pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PRRS = pattern recognition receptors,
  Pro-IL-1β = pro-interleukin-1β, Pro-IL-18 = pro-interleukin-18, TNF-α = tumor necrosis
  factor-α
