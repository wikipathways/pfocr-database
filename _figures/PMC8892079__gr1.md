caption: Eukaryotic heme biosynthesis is initiated by aminolevulinic acid synthase.A,
  aminolevulinic acid synthase (dark blue circle) initiates heme biosynthesis in the
  mitochondrion of nonplant eukaryotes by catalyzing the condensation of glycine and
  succinyl-CoA to ALA (red labels). Other enzymes involved in the pathway are indicated
  in light blue circles whereas intermediates are labeled in black. B, reaction schematic
  for ALAS enzymes in which cofactor pyridoxal phosphate and active site lysine (K391)
  are used for the condensation reaction. Residue numbering is based on human ALAS2.
  ALA, aminolevulinic acid; ALAS, aminolevulinic acid synthase.
