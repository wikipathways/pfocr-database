caption: 'Type I PI3K is composed of the regulatory subunit P85 and the catalytic
  subunit P110. It can be divided into two subtypes, IA and IB, which are activated
  in two major ways: (1) interaction of PI3K with growth factor receptors or ligand
  proteins that have tyrosine residues and are phosphorylated (2) direct binding of
  p110 through Ras. Activated PI3K activates AKT by phosphorylating its substrate
  PIP2 to PIP3. In addition, it activates the mTOR protein through phosphorylation.
  mTOR includes two polymolecular complexes, namely, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which regulate
  protein synthesis and cell growth. Abnormal activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  in lymphoma: 1. Mutations in the PIK3CA gene encoding p110α in patients with DLBCL
  and increased copy number of PIK3CA in patients with MCL lead to aberrant activation
  of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.2 In some patients with lymphoma, the phosphorylation
  of AKT is markedly increased, which leads to the inhibition of the function of the
  activated AKT on the cell-cycle inhibitors P21 and P27, resulting in uncontrolled
  tumour cells growth.3 High expression of AKT directly phosphorylates downstream
  FOX03a, which is associated with poor prognosis in patients with MCL.3 PTEN function,
  which is opposite to PIK3, inhibits AKT function, and inhibits downstream FOX03a,
  which is associated with poor prognosis in patients with MCL. The high expression
  of AKT directly phosphorylates downstream FOX03a, which is significantly associated
  with poor prognosis in MCL patients.3. PTEN functions in the opposite way to PIK3,
  inhibiting AKT activation and blocking signalling, and the lack of PTEN in GCB-type
  DLBCL patients leads to aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway'
