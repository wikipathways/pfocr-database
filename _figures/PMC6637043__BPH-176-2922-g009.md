caption: Schematic diagram showing the proposed signalling pathways for inflammatory
  and autoimmunity‐associated gene expression via Ca2+ and Ca2+‐dependent/‐binding
  proteins. Upper part, colour‐coded representation of the pathways by which the genes
  of interest can be affected by the calcium signalling pathway proteins in response
  to the cytosolic Ca2+ rise induced by celastrol treatment; lower part, network map
  linking the calcium signalling pathway proteins to their effects on the calcium‐modulated
  genes and five RA pathogenic factors (anti‐apoptosis, proliferation, inflammation
  and immunity, angiogenesis, migration, and invasion). Genes and pathways are colour‐coded
  according to the upper part. RA pathogenesis factor colours are only linked to their
  coloured asterisks (*) and are independent of the gene and pathway colour‐coding
