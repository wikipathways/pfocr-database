caption: p38 signaling to the chromatin in muscle progenitor cells. Extracellular
  cues released in the regenerative environment, such as TNFα, Amphoterin or HMGB1,
  and the engagement of the cell-surface receptor CDO [], are transduced in MSCs by
  combinations of intracellular signaling that culminate with the activation of p38
  kinases []. It seems that p38α has a major role in the control of muscle-gene transcription
  []. Important determinants of p38 activity include the combination of external cues,
  the magnitude of activation, the intracellular distribution of p38 isoforms and
  the substrate availability. The nuclear translocation and chromatin localization
  of p38 is controlled by the TGF-β signaling via transforming-growth-factor-β-activated
  protein kinase (TAK), the transforming-growth-factor-β-activated 7 protein-kinase-1-binding
  protein (TAB) and possibly by other intracellular cascades. Potential effectors
  of the p38 pathway are downstream kinases, such as mitogen and stress activated
  protein kinase-1 (MSK-1) and p38-regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK). In differentiating
  muscle progenitors, p38 kinases (and possibly other downstream kinases) are detected
  on the chromatin of target genes, where they control key events leading to the assembly
  of productive muscle transcriptosome []. In particular, the simultaneous recruitment
  of the Ash2L-containing methyltransferase complex (MLL/TrxG) via p38-mediated phosphorylation
  of MEF2D [], and the SWI/SNF CMCs via p38-mediated phosphorylation of BAF60 [] promote
  local H3–K4 trimethylation and chromatin remodeling – two crucial events for activation
  of transcription. It is possible that the formation of the MyoD–E47 homodimer –
  which is stimulated by p38-depndent phosphorylation of E47 [] – contributes to the
  recruitment of MLL/TrxG and SWI/SNF to muscle-gene promoters.
