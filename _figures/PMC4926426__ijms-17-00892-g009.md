caption: A model of the tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthetic pathways. Modified
  from Zhao et al. []. The pathway that AtTGG4 and AtTGG5 are involved in is shown
  in red. Solid arrows indicate that the enzymes catalyzing the steps have been identified;
  Dashed arrows indicate proposed steps, in which enzymes catalyzing the steps have
  not been determined conclusively. TAM, tryptamine; IAOx, indole-3-acetaldoxime;
  IPA, indole-3-pyruvate; IAM, indole-3-acetamide; IAN, indole-3-acetonitrile; TGG,
  thioglucoside glucohydrolase (AtTGG4, AtTGG5).
papertitle: Arabidopsis Myrosinase Genes AtTGG4 and AtTGG5 Are Root-Tip Specific and
  Contribute to Auxin Biosynthesis and Root-Growth Regulation.
