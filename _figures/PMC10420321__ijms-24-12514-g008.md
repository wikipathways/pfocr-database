caption: The molecular mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of FJE in the OVA-induced
  CARAS mouse model. Exposure to allergens induces the release of IL-33 and TSLP from
  epithelial cells and promotes the differentiation of Th0 cells to Th2. This stimulates
  B cells to produce IgE, which binds and activates mast cells. Activated mast cells
  trigger the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Together with
  Th2 cell–released cytokines, leukocytes are recruited and activated, leading to
  allergic inflammatory symptoms. Moreover, the NF-κB pathway is activated to amplify
  the inflammatory condition. FJE exhibited anti-allergic inflammatory effects via
  the IL-33/TSLP/NF-κB signaling pathway
