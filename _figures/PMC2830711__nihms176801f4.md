caption: Models for the function of FANCD2-I ubiquitination. (a) ubiquitination allows
  FANCD2-I binding to a nuclear receptor on chromatin, leading to its accumulation
  in foci and activation of DNA repair. (b) Ubiquitinated FANCD2-I recruit factors
  that organize the repair response and bind other repair enzymes. (c) Modified FANCD2-I
  complexes stabilize, activate, or enhance the enzymatic activities of repair factors.
  (d) Ubiquitination leads to a structural change in FANCD2-I that activates a cryptic
  DNA repair activity of the complex. These models are not mutually exclusive.
