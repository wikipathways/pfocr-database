caption: Data from the current study and the study by  were used to generate this
  figure. Green bubbles represent mRNAs and yellow bubbles denote proteins unless
  accompanied by an orange “P”, which indicates that data for phosphorylation of this
  protein is being considered. Arrows pointing up, down, or sideways denote increases,
  decreases, or no change (respectively) in mRNA, protein, or phosphorylation levels.
  Time course time points where the changes are observed are indicated in black text
  on top of the arrows describing the direction of the change.
