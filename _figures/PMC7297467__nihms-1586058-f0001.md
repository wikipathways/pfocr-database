caption: Key reactions in the biosynthesis of eicosanoids by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)
  and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Arachidonic acid (AA) is the common substrate for
  the synthesis of PGs (COX-2 pathway) and LTs (5-LOX pathway). In the 5-LOX/COX-2
  crossover pathway, both enzymes act sequentially to synthesize HKE2 and HKD2 as
  final products.
