caption: Schematic of potential role of LRG1 in abnormal angiogenesis of diabetic
  nephropathy associated with TGF-β1 signaling pathway. The black arrowhead lines
  represent positive crosstalk interactions and process and red flat-ended lines indicate
  inhibitory effects. (A) ALK5 receptor is widely existed in normal glomerular endothelial
  cell. The phosphorylation of Smad2/3 resulted from TGF-β1/ALK5 signaling would block
  angiogenesis by inhibition of EC proliferation, EC migration, and tube formation.
  (B) Under diabetic-like environment, high glucose leads to upregulation of LRG1.
  The LRG1 directly binds to endoglin and subsequently increases activation of the
  ALK1-mediated Smad1/5/8 pathway. It thus induces abnormal angiogenesis by promoting
  EC proliferation, EC migration, and tube formation. This is beneficial for the development
  of diabetic nephropathy.
