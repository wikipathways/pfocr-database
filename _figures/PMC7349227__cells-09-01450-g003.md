caption: Mechanisms by which exosomes derived from cancer stem cells (CSCs) regulate
  drug resistance in the tumor microenvironment. Exosomal miRNAs secreted by CSCs
  are transferred to sensitive cancer cells and inhibit the pro-apoptotic property
  of FOXO3a and activates the mTOR signaling pathway, which is directly associated
  with inhibition of apoptosis and tumor progression, thereby blocking the drug-induced
  apoptosis. Exosomes can promote drug resistance to sensitive cells by transferring
  ABC transporters (drug efflux pumps) that actively export drugs out of the cell.
