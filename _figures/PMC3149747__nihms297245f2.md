caption: Extensive feedback and feedforward loops between Ras signaling and miRNAs.
  In this simplified view of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, extracellular
  stimulation activates a Ras small GTPase (e.g. K-ras) and a kinase cascade including
  MAP kinase (MAPK), which regulates downstream transcriptional activators such as
  AP-1 and transcriptional repressors such as RREB1. In addition to regulating the
  expression of protein-coding genes, these transcription factors also regulate miRNA
  genes. AP-1 directly activates mir-21, an oncogenic miRNA that blocks multiple inhibitors
  of Ras signaling, including BTG2, SPRY1/2, and PDCD4, thereby establishing a potent
  feed-forward loop. RREB-1 directly represses the mir-143/145 cluster, which in turn
  have tumor suppressor activity by feedback repression of Kras and RREB1. These miRNAs
  also have other targets, many of which contribute to their oncogenic or tumor suppressive
  activities; as well, other miRNAs regulate Ras pathway components.
