caption: 'Pathos: metabolic pathway map. The map window has been decreased in size
  for convenience, and the visible portion chosen to illustrate a clustering of identified
  metabolites, some of which had increased in concentration in the mutant (blue circles).
  The light-green background for the EC numbers of particular enzymes indicates that
  they are predicted to be present in the genome of Leishmania major (a parasite closely
  related to L. mexicana).'
