caption: When Hippo signaling is on, the active Lats1/2 phosphorylates YAP/TAZ and
  leads to their degradation. When Lats1/2 is deleted, the unphosphorylated (active)
  YAP/TAZ translocate into the cell nucleus and promotes Cd274 (PD-L1) expression.
  The active YAP/TAZ also inhibits PTEN expression and thereby increases AKT signaling,
  which also leads to upregulated PD-L1 expression
