caption: Many age-promoting stimuli can lead to activation of p53 pathway through
  ATM/ATR-dependent DDR pathway or a DNA damage independent ARF-HDM2 pathway. ATM
  and/or ATR, together with CHK1 and/or CHK2, facilitate activation of p53 in response
  to DNA damage. In addition, p53 activation can also be induced by ARF in response
  to oncogene activation, PcG loss or other unknown mechanisms. ARF inhibits HDM2
  (MDM2 in mice) and stabilizes p53 expression. Among a suite of p53 targets, p21CIP
  is activated and causes a transient cell cycle arrest. Apoptosis and senescence
  can also be triggered through other p53 downstream pathways. Both apoptosis and
  cellular senescence lead to ageing at the organism level, while transient arrest
  and DNA repair could restore normal homeostasis and delay ageing.
