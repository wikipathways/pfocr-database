caption: Working model for CUX1-induced malignant phenotype in gliomagenesis. Destruction
  complex was the essential step for β-catenin phosphorylation, meanwhile, the phosphorylated
  status of β-catenin was determined for its stability. In the Wnt-off state, β-catenin
  was recruited by the destruction complex and induced degradation in proteasome.
  However, in the state of Wnt-on, due to the disassembly of the destruction complex,
  β-catenin was accumulated in cytoplasm and then translocated into the nucleus. On
  the one hand, DNA-binding dynamics of CUX1 showed a cell cycle-dependent manner,
  our study found that glioma cells with CUX1 overexpression represented the accelerated
  entry into S phase and cell proliferation. On the other hand, we also found that
  transcription factor CUX1 could upregulate the expression of Axin2/β-catenin and
  activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promoted the transcription of downstreamed
  cell motility-related genes (such as CyclinD1, C-Myc and MMP7) and progress of epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT), inducing the malignant phenotype during gliomagenesis.
