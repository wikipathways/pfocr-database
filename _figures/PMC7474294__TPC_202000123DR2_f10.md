caption: KL Signaling Pathway Mirrors the SL Signaling Pathway.A working model of
  karrikin signaling mediated by the D14L-D3-OsSMAX1 complex. Karrikin signaling mirrors
  the SL signaling complex in rice. In the absence of ligands, both OsSMAX1 and D53
  are able to interact with TPR transcriptional corepressors and repress the expression
  of downstream genes. In the presence of ligands, D14L and D14 perceive specific
  ligands (such as GR24ent-5DS and GR245DS) and recruit the SCFD3 complex to ubiquitinate
  OsSMAX1 and D53 for degradation by the 26S proteasome. In turn, this releases OsSMAX1-
  and D53-mediated repression of the activity of their interacting transcription factors,
  thus regulating the expression of downstream target genes. SL signals specifically
  regulate shoot branching, and KL signals might specifically regulate root colonization
  by AM fungi. The specificity of the output of SL signals and KL signals is likely
  determined by transcription factors that interact specifically with D53 or OsSMAX1.
  It is possible that some common transcription factors both interact with D53 and
  are responsible for the expression of a subset of common genes, which could respond
  to both KL signaling and SL signaling. During skotomorphogenesis, KL and SL signals
  act through the D14L-D3-OsSMAX1 complex and D14-D3-D53, respectively, and act in
  parallel and/or additively to trigger the expression of their specific or commonly
  regulated downstream genes, which leads to the inhibition of rice mesocotyl elongation.
