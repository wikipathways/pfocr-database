caption: A schematic diagram illustrating the potential mechanisms by which ponatinib
  induces hypertension through a pathway associated with increased KAT7 expression.
  This increase leads to H3K14 acetylation and NF-κB activation, which mediate cellular
  senescence and inflammatory responses in vascular endothelial cells
