  expressed genes (DEGs) related to MAPK signaling pathway–plant at 6 and 24 h post
  acetoin treatment. KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs related to MAPK signaling pathway–plant
  at 6 (A) and 24 h (B). Red and green indicate up- and downregulated genes, respectively
  and the numbers on the left represent the differential expression of genes. ABA
  represents abscisic acid; PYR/PYL, PP2C, SnRK2, MAPKKK17/18, MKK3/9, ETR/ERS, CTR1,
  EIN3/EIL, ERF1, PDF1.2, CHIB, CALM/CML, RbohD, and OXI1 represent the genes encoding
  abscisic acid receptor PYR/PYL family, protein phosphatases 2C, SNF1-related type
  2 protein kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 17/18, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 3/9, ethylene receptor, serine/threonine-protein kinase CTR1, ethylene-insensitive
  protein 3, ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1, defensin-like protein 16,
  basic endochitinase B, calmodulin/calmodulin-like protein, respiratory burst oxidase
  homologous protein D, and serine/threonine-protein kinase OXI1, respectively. MPK1/2,
  MPK7/14, MPK3/6, and MPK8 represents the genes encoding mitogen-activated protein
  kinase 1/2, 7/14, 3/6, and 8, respectively
