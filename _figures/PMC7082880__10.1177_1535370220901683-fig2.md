caption: 'Wnt signaling pathways. (a) In the absence of Wnt molecules, the canonical
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway is inactivated due to the existence of the β-catenin destruction
  complex, which is made of scaffold protein APC, Axin, Hippo pathway proteins YAP–TAZ,
  and kinases CK1a, GSK3a/b. The destruction complex mediates β-catenin phosphorylation
  for its following proteasome degradation. The canonical Wnt pathway can be negatively
  regulated by extracellular Wnt-binding protein like sFRPs, or by proteins like Dkk1
  that downregulate membrane co-receptors (LRP5/6) of the canonical pathway. (b) In
  the presence of canonical Wnt molecules, Wnt binding to Fzd receptors promotes dimerization
  of the Fzd receptor to its co-receptor LRP5/6. Then, LRP5/6 recruits components
  of the β-catenin destruction complex to its cellular carboxy-terminal tails, which
  dissociates the destruction complex and leads to β-catenin stabilization and accumulation
  in cells to allow β-catenin nuclear translocation for its mediated downstream transcriptional
  responses. Also, the dissociation of the destruction complex prevents GSK3a/b’s
  substrates phosphorylation and degradation, which is called Wnt–STOP mechanism.
  (c) In the presence of non-canonical Wnt molecules, Wnt binding to Fzd receptors
  promotes dimerization of the Fzd receptor to variable types of co-receptors for
  recruitment of the adaptor protein DVL. The recruitment of DVL triggers multiple
  β-catenin independent non-canonical downstream events to mediate cellular actin
  remodeling processes, variable types of transcriptional responses, or canonical
  Wnt pathway downregulations. (d) For multiple types of cancers, a novel Wnt5a-mediated
  non-canonical pathway is found to mediate the EMT. In this pathway, Wnt5A binding
  to Frizzled-2 receptors activates Src family kinases Fyn by promoting its phosphorylation.
  Then, Fyn activates the STAT3 to trigger STAT3-mediated EMT processes. This non-canonical
  pathway is negatively regulated by Abl interactor 1 (ABI1). ABI1 can directly interact
  with either Fyn or STAT3, although roles of these interactions in regulating the
  Wnt5a–STAT3 pathway remain unknown. (A color version of this figure is available
