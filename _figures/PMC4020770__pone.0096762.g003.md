caption: The figure shows the metabolic steps leading from farnesyl-diphosphate to
  ergosterol (in yeast, and in T. cruzi epimastigotes) or to different 24-alkylsterols
  (in T. cruzi amastigotes ), and the corresponding yeast and T. cruzi enzymes that
  catalyze these steps. The two methyl groups at C4 are removed in two rounds of successive
  C4-oxidation, C4-decarboxylation and C3-ketoreduction (*). Gene names used are those
  in  and . Unknown/hypothetical assignments are shown with question marks.
