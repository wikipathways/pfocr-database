caption: Putative protective mechanisms of ACE2 against Ang II-mediated impairment
  of insulin/Akt signalling pathway. On one hand, Ang II induces the expression of
  the NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox, contributing to the enhancement of MDA production
  and oxidative status and MIF expression. On the other hand, Ang II regulates insulin
  signalling via a pathway involving impairment of PI3K-dependent activation of Akt–eNOS
  phosphorylation and NO generation. These inhibitory effects of Ang II can be reversed
  by ACE2 gene transfer and anti-MIF treatment in endothelial cells. These beneficial
  effects of ACE2 are thought to result mainly from blocking the expression of MIF.
  ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Ang II, angiotensin II; e NOS, endothelial
  NOS; MDA, malondialdehyde; MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor; NADPH, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
