caption: Proposed mechanism of septic cardiomyopathy. (Left panel) Sepsis, caused
  by polymicrobial infection leads to an activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting
  in increased conversion of inactive pro‐IL‐1ß in active IL‐1ß, which acts on cardiomyocytes
  via the IL‐1 receptor complex (IL‐1R1/IL‐1RAcP). Binding of IL‐1 to its receptor
  causes an activation of NF‐κB, which leads to increased protein degradation by the
  autophagy–lysosomal pathway (ALP), a decrease in myosin heavy chain content (MyHC),
  a reduced deformability and a decreased cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation.
  This in turn causes septic cardiomyopathy with cardiac atrophy, systolic and diastolic
  cardiac dysfunction and increased expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in the
  heart. (Right panel) In Nlrp3 knockout mice, sepsis can no longer activate the NLRP3
  inflammasome, generation of IL‐1ß is much reduced, and activation of NF‐κB as well
  as NF‐κB signalling is attenuated, which maintains cardiomyocyte size, deformability,
  contraction and relaxation. As a result, Nlrp3 knockout mice show a normal cardiac
  function in sepsis without cardiac atrophy and preserved expression of pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines. Inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome (e.g. haemin, scutellarin, glyburide
  and MCC950), IL‐1ß (anti‐IL‐1 antibody; anti‐IL‐1 Ab), IL‐1 receptor antagonist
  (IL‐1 RA) and NF‐κB (IKKβ‐directed NF‐κB inhibitor BMS‐345541) that hold therapeutic
  potential are indicated.
