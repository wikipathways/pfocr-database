caption: Complexity of sphingolipid biosynthetic pathways. Palmitoyl-CoA serves as
  substrate for the initial and rate-limiting step in de novo sphingolipid synthesis
  to form dihydrosphingosine, followed by acylation of dihydroceramide synthase (CerS)
  to generate ceramide. There are six isoforms of CerS, which play a specific action
  in formation of specifi c chain-length of ceramide. Ceramide can be converted to
  other interconnected bioactive lipid species. Ceramide can be phosphorylated by
  ceramide kinase to generate C1P, or can serve as a substrate for the synthesis of
  glycosphingolipids or sphingomyelin. Ceramide can be metabolized by ceramidases
  to produce sphingosine, which in turn is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase to
  yield S1P, or, by a mechanism termed the ‘salvage’ pathway, undergoes CerS-mediated
  re-acylation back to ceramide.
