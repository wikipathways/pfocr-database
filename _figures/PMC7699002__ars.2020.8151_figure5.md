caption: Redox sensing and metabolic reprioritization by GAPDH. GAPDH, a critical
  enzyme on the energy generating triosephosphate pathway, has a highly reactive Cys-thiolate
  ion in the active site (S−). In normal conditions, GAPDH is active and flux of glucose
  through the triose-P pathway for energetics versus through the pentose-P pathway
  for generating NADPH is balanced. During oxidative stress, H2O2 oxidizes the active
  site thiolate, which inactivates glycolytic activity of GAPDH, lowering glycolytic
  flux and making more glucose available for the pentose-P pathway; and converts GAPDH
  into a nuclear-localized transcription factor that further favors antioxidant activities
  of NADPH arising from the pentose-P pathway. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
