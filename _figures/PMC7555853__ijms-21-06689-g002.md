caption: Photolesion recognition and repair pathways. (a) The direct repair pathway
  (light repair) relies on specific photolyases, which either recognize CPD or 6-4PP.
  The photolyase interne flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, excited by blue
  light, catalyzes photoreversion to restore the initial undamaged sequence. (b) The
  transcription coupled repair (TCR) pathway (dark repair) is specific to transcribed
  genomic regions and depends on the RNA Pol II–CSB (RNA Polymerase II-Cockayne Syndrome
  protein B) complex for the recognition step. RNA Pol II stalls and arrests at the
  damage site. (c) The global genome repair (GGR) pathway (dark repair) primarily
  recognizes the photolesion by the damage sensor complex UV–DDB (DNA damage binding
  protein), which is able to scan DNA in compacted chromatin. (d) Once bound to the
  damage, UV–DDB recruits the Rad4/XPC (Xeroderma Pigmentosum complementation group
  C) complex for a second recognition step. The stalled RNA Pol II–CSB and The Rad4/XPC
  complex recruit the TFIIH (Transcription Factor II H) protein complex. (e) XPD (Xeroderma
  Pigmentosum complementation group D) proceeds to a damage validation step. Upon
  this final recognition step, the damaged DNA region is excised by a dual incision
  process, and the gap is filled by de novo DNA synthesis and nick ligation.
