caption: Selected hormone and ROS interactions in response to high-temperature stress.
  During high temperatures, ABA-regulated kinases such as SnRK2 or TFs activate RBOHs
  to generate ROS. Similarly, in the BR-signaling pathway TF BZR1 activates RBOHs
  to generate ROS. Along with TFs, the generated ROS may activate and induce the expression
  of stress-responsive genes to orchestrate the appropriate molecular and physiological
  acclimation responses to high temperatures. Other plant hormones such as ET, SA,
  and CKs may also play roles in inducing stress responses to high temperatures. Only
  ABA, BRs, and JA were selected to be presented in the mode due to the availability
  of a relatively large amount of data supporting their roles in ROS interactions
  in response to high-temperature stress. Solid arrows and blocked arrows indicate
  confirmed positive and negative regulations. Dashed lines indicate potential interactions.
  The hormones are indicated in yellow, transcription factors in green, ROS in red,
  and ROS-producing and -scavenging enzymes are indicated in brown and blue, respectively.
