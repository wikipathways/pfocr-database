caption: The mechanism of ZOL relieving inflammatory bone loss by reducing autophagy
  level through suppressing NLRP3 signaling pathway to downregulate IL‐1β. The NF‐κB
  signaling pathway is activated by the TLR pathway and further stimulates NLRP3 inflammasome
  assembly and activation. Then the precursor caspase‐1 into an activated form (cleaved‐caspase‐1).
  Activated caspase‐1 cleaves the precursor IL‐1β into mature forms and cause inflammation.
  In the inflammatory bone microenvironment, the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes autophagosomes
  greatly increased, and excessive autophagy aggravates the development of inflammation
  as well. However, ZOL may inhibit the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and downregulate
  IL‐1β to reduce the level of autophagy in macrophages, thus inhibiting the activity
  and function of OCs and alleviating inflammatory bone resorption. IL‐1β, Interleukin‐1β
