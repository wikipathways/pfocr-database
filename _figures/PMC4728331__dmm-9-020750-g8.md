caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed mechanism of action for CB1-mTORC1
  interaction in islets and its physiological relevance in vivo. (A) Rimonabant antagonizes
  CB1 receptors in islets and, probably by uncoupling the Gi subunit at the insulin-response
  element (IRS) of the insulin receptor or another related growth-factor receptor,
  activates the Akt-mTORC1 pathway, increasing phosphorylation of p70S6K1 and of rpS6.
  This activation decreases GSIS and consequently plasma insulin levels, leading to
  glucose intolerance. No changes in peripheral insulin sensitivity were observed
  with rimonabant (= insulin sensitivity). (B) Rapamycin prevents rimonabant-mediated
  activation of the Akt-mTORC1 pathway, thus preventing rimonabant-dependent decrease
  in GSIS; however, insulin plasma levels remain decreased as a consequence of rimonabant-unrelated
  rapamycin actions, probably also mediated through decreased GSIS. In parallel, rapamycin
  increases insulin sensitivity by acting at other peripheral tissues, likely by increasing
  glucose uptake, with the net effect being an appropriate glucose homeostasis. Gi,
  inhibitory G protein; IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3K,
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase.
