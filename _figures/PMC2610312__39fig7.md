caption: Biosynthetic pathway of DHN-melanin and related pentaketide metabolites,  from
  the scheme shown by Bell & Wheeler  (). The first known product  of the pathway
  is I.3.6.8-THN. This metabolite is reduced lo scytalone, which  is then dehydrated
  to 1,3.8-THN. Next, 1.3.8-THN is reduced to vermelone,  which is then dehydrated
  to DHN. The enzyme(s) that catalyze the final  polymerization reaction, oxidation
  of DHN to melanin, have not yet been  adequately studied but it appears to be a
  laccase. Tricyclazole (Tr) inhibits  the reduction of 1.3.6,8-THN and 1.3.8-THN
  to scytalone and vermelone,  respectively. Its strongest inhibitory effect is on
  the reduction of  1.3.8-THN. This results in the accumulation of flaviolin, 2-HJ,
  and their  related shunt products, 1.2.4.5.7-pentahydroxynaphthalene (1.2.4.5.7-PHN),  1.2.4.5-tetrahydroxynaphthalene
  (1.2.4.5-THN), and 1.4.5-trihydroxynaphthalene  (1.4.5-THN) are extremely unstable
  and have not been isolated from fungi.
