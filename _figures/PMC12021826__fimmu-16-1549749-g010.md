caption: Schematic diagram illustrating how AREG triggers macrophage pyroptosis through
  the EGFR/TLR4 signaling pathway during inflammatory responses. Schematic diagram
  was created in https://BioRender.com. Mechanistically, extracellular AREG expression
  is regulated by the translational regulation of RPLP1. When extracellular AREG and
  ATP jointly stimulate macrophages, AREG promotes TLR4 expression by binding to EGFR.
  Expression of TLR4 recruits the adaptor protein Myd88 and further activates downstream
  IκB and NFκB, which promotes the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent pyroptosis. AREG,
  amphiregulin; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ATP, adenosine triphosphate
