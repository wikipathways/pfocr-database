caption: Proposed molecular mechanism of exon skipping caused by aberrant HMGA1a-U1
  snRNP complex. (A) Assembled early spliceosomal complex E commits the pre-mRNA to
  the active splicing pathway (reviewed in references  and ). All protein-protein
  interactions across the introns and exon are indicated by arrows. U1 snRNP binds
  to the 5′ splice site (indicated by GU), while the 65- and 35-kDa subunits of U2AF
  bind to the polypyrimidine tract (Py) and to the 3′ splice site (AG), respectively.
  SF1 recognizes the branch point (A) and forms a bridge to U1 snRNP (through its
  U1C protein and the formin-binding protein). The SR protein (SR), which interacts
  with U2AF35 and U1-70K (70), binds to the exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) and promotes
  exon definition. Significant SR protein-specific ESE elements were identified in
  exon 5 of the PS2 pre-mRNA using ESEfinder software (http://rulai.cshl.edu/cgi-bin/tools/ESE3/esefinder.cgi?process=home;
  data not shown). (B) Overexpressed HMGA1a binds sequence specifically to the target
  site (BS) adjacent to the 5′ splice site and traps U1 snRNP (via U1-70K) to the
  5′ splice site. The HMGA1a-U1 snRNP complex is stably retained on the 5′ splice
  site and impairs active protein interactions with the splicing factors bound to
  adjacent introns (as described in panel A). The resulting defect in exon definition
  allows protein-protein interactions (indicated by arrows) between the distal 5′
  and 3′ splice sites, which lead to the sequestration of the middle exon that is
  skipped from the final mRNA.
