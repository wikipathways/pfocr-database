caption: Mandelate and β-ketoadipate pathways in P. putida. The mandelate pathway
  in Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633 is shown in dark gray, and the conversion of benzoylformate
  to benzaldehyde by a benzoylformate decarboxylase (MdlC) is highlighted. The β-ketoadipate
  pathway (gray) also exists in the majority of all pseudomonads. Additionally, P.
  putida KT2440 and P. putida DSM50198 possess a benzaldehyde dehydrogenase of unknown
  function. The metabolization of succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA via the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle is shown in light gray. MdlA, mandelate racemase; MdlB, S-mandelate dehydrogenase;
  MdlDE, NAD+- and NADP+-benzaldehyde dehydrogenases; BenABC, benzoate dioxygenase;
  BenD, 2-hydro-1,2-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase; CatA, catechol-1,2-dioxygenase;
  CatB, cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme (cycloisomerase); CatC, muconolactone
  isomerase; PcaD, β-ketoadipate enolactone hydrolase I; PcaIJ, β-ketoadipate succinyl-CoA
  transferase subunit; PcaF, β-ketoadipyl CoA thiolase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
