caption: The TLR3 signaling pathway is mediated exclusively by the TRIF adapter. TLR3-TRIF
  interaction and the downstream signaling it induces lead to the activation of IRF3
  and NF-κB. The phosphorylation of IRF3 is mediated by two kinases, TBK1 and IKKε,
  which themselves associate with TRIF through a signalosome complex also containing
  other key molecules, including TRAF3. The activation of NF-κB is thought to be essentially
  mediated by RIP1, and probably also by TRAF6 in some cell types. RIP1 and TRAF6
  subsequently recruit TAB2 and TAK1, which phosphorylates IKKα and IKKβ. These two
  kinases and the IKK adaptor protein IKKγ (NEMO) form the IKK complex. IKKβ, in turn,
  phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκB, eventually leading to its degradation and
  the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Other molecules that have been experimentally
  implicated in the TLR3-IRF3/NF-κB-IFN pathways are also indicated, including BS69,
  TAPE, TRAF2, TANK, TRIL, SINTBAD, TRADD, DDX3X, CaMKII, RAFLIN, GAB1, TRIM21, TRIM56,
  HMGB, ELMOD2, PELLINO1 and TRIS. The activation and nucleus translocation of IRF3
  and NF-κB lead to the induction of antiviral IFNs and other cytokines.

  description: The TLR3 signaling pathway is mediated exclusively by the TRIF adapter.
    TLR3-TRIF interaction and the downstream signaling it induces lead to the activation
    of IRF3 and NF-κB. The phosphorylation of IRF3 is mediated by two kinases, TBK1
    and IKKε, which themselves associate with TRIF through a signalosome complex also
    containing other key molecules, including TRAF3. The activation of NF-κB is thought
    to be essentially mediated by RIP1, and probably also by TRAF6 in some cell types.
    RIP1 and TRAF6 subsequently recruit TAB2 and TAK1, which phosphorylates IKKα and
    IKKβ. These two kinases and the IKK adaptor protein IKKγ (NEMO) form the IKK complex.
    IKKβ, in turn, phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκB, eventually leading to its
    degradation and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Other molecules that have
    been experimentally implicated in the TLR3-IRF3/NF-κB-IFN pathways are also indicated,
