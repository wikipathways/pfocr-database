caption: 'The heme biosynthetic pathway: Eight enzymatic steps lead to the conversion
  of succinyl-CoA and glycine to the end product, heme, which is then transported
  out of the mitochondrion and used for the formation of various hemoproteins. Especially
  in the liver, heme exerts a negative feedback on the first enzyme of the heme biosynthetic
  pathway, ALAS1. While ALAS1 is ubiquitously expressed, its isoform, ALAS2, is erythroid
  specific and is regulated by erythroid-specific transcription factors. Four catalytic
  reactions of the heme biosynthetic pathway occur in the mitochondrion and the other
  four steps in the cytosol. Dysfunction of each enzyme (in blue boxes) results in
  a different type of porphyria (in red boxes) due to accumulation of the different
  heme precursors and porphyrins in various tissues. Abbreviations: enzymes of the
  heme biosynthetic pathway: ALAS1/ALAS2, delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1/2;
  ALAD, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase; HMBS, hydroxymethylbilane synthase;
  UROS, uroporphyrinogen III synthase; UROD, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase; CPOX,
  coproporphyrinogen oxidase; PPOX, protoporphyrinogen oxidase; FECH, ferrochelatase.
  Different types of porphyria: XLP, X-linked protoporphyria; ADP, delta-aminolevulinic
  acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria; AIP, acute intermittent porphyria; CEP, Congenital
  erythropoietic porphyria; PCT, porphyria cutanea tarda; HCP, hereditary coproporphyria;
  VP variegate porphyria; EPP, erythropoietic protoporphyria.'
