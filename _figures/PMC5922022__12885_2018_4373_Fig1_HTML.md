caption: Flow chart illustrating the different computational steps for the analysis
  performed in this study. 1) Histopathology (HP) is used to create balanced and unbalanced
  datasets independently for the Bertilsson (marked green) and Chen (marked red) cohorts.
  2) Differentially expressed genes for the HP-based balanced and unbalanced datasets
  are calculated for the Bertilsson and Chen cohorts. 3) Two stroma gene-sets are
  identified independently based on gene p-value relationships between the HP-based
  balanced and unbalanced datasets in the Bertilsson and Chen cohorts, respectively.
  4) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) scores for all samples in all seven cohorts
  are calculated based on the two stroma gene-sets. These gene-sets are not combined,
  ensuring two independent GSEA stroma predictions for each sample in each cohort.
  5) The GSEA scores are used to separate the five cohorts with both cancer and normal
  samples (including the cohorts from Bertilsson and Chen) into balanced and unbalanced
  datasets. The two remaining cohorts (Sboner and Erho) are only separated into groups
  with high and low stroma content. 6) Differentially expressed genes are calculated
  individually for the five cohorts with both cancer and normal samples. 7) Balanced
  and unbalanced datasets from the five-study-cohort are merged into one meta-analysis
  for differential expression. Balanced and unbalanced datasets from the five-study-cohort,
  as well as high and low stroma datasets from the Sboner and Erho cohorts are merged
  into one meta-analysis of the seven-study-cohort
