caption: Chemical Structures of Phloroglucinol and Subunits of Four Different Structural
  Classes of Phlorotannins.Boxed area shows the biosynthesis of a phloroglucinol by
  a bacterial type III PKS (PhlD) in P. fluorescens from malonyl-CoA as the sole substrate.
  The polymerization steps of phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) condensation
  are not known, and only the phloroglucinol synthesis from the acetate-malonate pathway
  was hypothesized by a process that may involve a polyketide synthase-type enzyme
  complex in brown algae.
