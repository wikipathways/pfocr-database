caption: Tight junction signaling pathway was regulated by vancomycin in HK-2 cells.
  HK-2 cells were treated with 50 μg/mL vancomycin for 24 h and the protein samples
  were subject to quantitative proteomic analysis. Red indicates an up-regulation;
  green indicates a down-regulation. The intensity of green and red colors indicates
  the degree of down- or up-regulation. Solid arrow indicates direct interaction and
  dashed arrow indicates indirect interaction.
