caption: SCFAs inhibit the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway to mediate GH and PRL gene
  transcription in DCAPCs. SCFAs bind to GPCR and lead to dissociation of heterotrimeric
  G protein complex into Gαi and Gβγ subunit. The exchange of GTP from GDP results
  in activation of the Gαi, thereby inhibiting adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity. This
  process results in a decrease of intracellular cAMP levels and a subsequent reduction
  in PKA activity. Inhibition of PKA activity inhibits CREB phosphorylation, thereby
  decreasing GH and PRL gene transcription directly or indirectly. The A-protomer
  of PTX penetrates into the host cells result in inactivation of Gαi, hence, inhibits
  SCFAs mediated signaling pathway. In addition, inhibition of PKA activity may result
  in a decreased of Ca2+ influx through decreased l-type Ca2+ channel mean open time.
  Therefore, SCFAs may also inhibit bovine GH and PRL secretion via Gαi-mediated inhibition
  of Ca2+ channel.
