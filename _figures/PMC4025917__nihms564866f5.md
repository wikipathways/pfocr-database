caption: 'In absence of telomerase, cells containing a critically short telomere are
  allowed to prolong viability. This allows to define a pre-senescent state that can
  be modulated by genetic manipulations: RAD52 and MMS1 deletions abrogate this pre-senescent
  state and TEL1 deletion prolongs it. In the presence of telomerase, this would lead
  to telomerase recruitment and telomere elongation, –. In its absence, telomeres
  become a substrate for a Rad52p-, Mms1p-dependent processes that protect the telomeres
  and might abrogate the signaling pathway that activates senescence (e.g. sister
  chromatid recombination). We demonstrate that Mec1p binds, senses and signals the
  very short telomere. We speculate that pre-senescent cells switch to senescent cells
  when single-stranded subtelomeric sequences are exposed sufficiently to activate
  Mec1p pathway. This is expected to occur first at the shortest telomere.'
