caption: P. aeruginosa uses hierarchical signaling pathways to control specialized
  metabolite production. Gene regulators are represented by blue boxes, biosynthetic
  pathways are represented by green boxes, and structures of key metabolites are shown.
  The hierarchical signaling pathways of P. aeruginosa begin with two HSL-dependent
  regulatory pathways, las and rhl, linked to the AQ system. LasI produces 3-oxo-C12-HSL,
  and RhlI produces C4-HSL. These HSLs interact with the transcriptional regulators
  LasR and RhlR, respectively, to activate target promoters. The rhl signaling pathway
  directly regulates rhamnolipid biosynthesis. Both las and rhl signaling have been
  implicated in regulating AQ biosynthesis through the PqsR (MvfR) regulator. Of the
  AQ metabolites produced, only HHQ, PQS, and HQNO have defined biological activities.
  HHQ and PQS have been implicated in the regulation of production of the phenazine
  molecular family. The two best-studied phenazines are PCA and PYO. PYO has been
  shown to induce SoxR signaling. The link between siderophore biosynthesis and the
  signaling pathways remains unknown. However, PQS has been described as activating
  pyoverdine and pyochelin biosynthesis in a non-signaling-dependent manner.
