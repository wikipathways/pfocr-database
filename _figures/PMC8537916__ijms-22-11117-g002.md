caption: Mitochondrial contribution to aging. Aging process shows dysregulation of
  several pathway involving the direct contribution of mitochondria. Mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (mtROS) accumulate after the impairment of the major antioxidant
  defense systems, consist of Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and Catalase, caused by
  the aged-related loss of FOXO3 and SIRT3 (grey). AKT/mTOR signaling is a key regulator
  of mitochondrial metabolism and, upon aging, its imbalance causes mtROS accumulation,
  mitochondrial biogenesis, and an altered metabolism. Inhibition of complex II of
  the electron transport chain (ETC) leads to oxygen hypersensitivity and premature
  aging of HSCs (pink). The mitochondrial unfolded protein response system (mtUPR)
  is affected by the aged-related loss of SIRT7, leading to accumulation of unfolded
  protein and mitochondrial stress (green). Accumulation of mtROS activates the NOD-,
  LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which triggers the release
  of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18 (orange). Mitochondrial dysfunctions
  include accumulation of mtDNA mutations in aged HSCs (blue).
