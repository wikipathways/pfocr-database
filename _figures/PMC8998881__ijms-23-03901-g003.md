caption: Involvement of cGAS-STING signalling pathway in intestinal inflammation.
  Under normal circumstances, cytosolic DNA is sensed by cGAS-STING signalling axis,
  which is involved in promoting intestinal barrier integrity. Meanwhile, excessive
  inflammation is prevented by cytosolic DNAse enzymes that degrade free DNA. However,
  under inflammatory conditions, the regulatory capacity of these enzymes is overcome
  when a DNA threshold is reached, leading to abnormal levels of cytosolic DNA. Upregulated
  expression of STING protein and elevated pathway activation culminates in sustained
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. (1) This mechanism
  activates the adaptive arm of the immune system and leads to the recruitment of
  T lymphocytes to the site of injury. (2) Perpetual release of inflammatory mediators
  by T lymphocytes leads to aggregations of immune cells and extensive release of
  inflammatory mediators. (3) Surrounding epithelial cells are damaged by the sustained
  inflammatory response, resulting in cell necrosis and tissue destruction.
