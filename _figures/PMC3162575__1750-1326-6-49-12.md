caption: Schematic illustration of Wnt1/Fzd-1/β-catenin signaling as a candidate regulatory
  circuit controlling mesencephalic dopaminergic neuron-astrocyte crosstalk. Crosstalk
  between astrocytes and DA neurons represent a cardinal neuroprotective mechanism
  against inflammation, oxidative stress and growth factor deprivation (10). Here
  astrocyte-DA neuron crosstalk via Wnt1 is emphasized. Astrocyte-derived Wnt, via
  activation of Fzd-1 receptors, may contribute to maintain the integrity of DA neurons
  by influencing Wnt signaling components, including blockade of GSK-3β-induced phosphorylation
  (P) and proteosomal degradation of the neuronal pool of β-catenin. Stabilized β-catenin
  can translocate into the nucleus and associate with a family of transcription factors
  and regulate the expression of Wnt target genes involved in DA neuron survival.
  β-catenin may also function as a pivotal defense molecule against oxidative stress
  (79), and can act as a coactivator for several nuclear receptors involved in the
  maintenance/protection of DA neurons (81). Crosstalk with up-stream survival pathways
  converging to β-catenin stabilization can also be envisaged (26, 27). Neurotoxic
  injury or increased oxidative load as a result of aging may antagonize Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling in DA neurons by up-regulating active GSK-3β, leading to β-catenin degradation
  and increased DA neuron vulnerability, which may underlie a progressive DA neuron
  deficit. Neuronal injury also triggers reactive astrocyte expression of a panel
  of growth and neurotrophic factors, anti-oxidant and neuroprotective mechanisms,
  among which astrocyte Wnt1 via Fzd-1 receptors may function as a vital component
  of DA neurons self-protective machinery shifting the balance towards the programming
  of cell survival/neurorescue.
