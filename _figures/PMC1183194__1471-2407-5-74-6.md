caption: 'Pathway-analyses based on decreased (green) and increased (red) genes detected
  in fibrosarcoma cells after 24 h treatment with doxorubicin. Results shown for FAS-signalling.
  Signaling pathway maps were identified using the software package Pathway Assist.
  A minimum of 3 interacting genes is the required criteria for creation of a map
  (Software: Pathway Assist™ Stratagene).'
papertitle: Response rate of fibrosarcoma cells to cytotoxic drugs on the expression
  level correlates to the therapeutic response rate of fibrosarcomas and is mediated
  by regulation of apoptotic pathways.
