caption: The HOG and mating MAPK pathways in S. cerevisiae. Physical interactions
  are denoted by overlap of the proteins depicted. (A) The HOG pathway responds to
  an increase in external osmolarity and induces the STL1promoter-td-Tomato reporter.
  In isotonic medium, the Sln1 osmosensor phosphorylates Ypd1, which in turn transfers
  phosphate to Ssk1. Hyperosmotic conditions reduce Sln1 activity, resulting in unphosphorylated
  Ssk1, which binds to redundant MAPKKKs Ssk2 and Ssk22, alleviating their auto-inhibition
  (). Also upon hyperosmotic shock, an osmosensor comprising a tetraspanin (Sho1)
  and its associated factors, Opy2 and two transmembrane mucins (Msb2 and Hkr1), recruits
  GTPase Cdc42 in its GTP-bound state, leading to activation of p21-activated kinase
  (PAK) Ste20 (,). Ste20 in turn activates MAPKKK Ste11 brought to the membrane through
  interactions with Sho1, Pbs2, and Cdc42 (indirectly through Ste50) (). Both the
  Sln1 and Sho1 arms converge on Pbs2 (MAPKK), leading to phosphorylation and activation
  of Hog1 (MAPK). (B) The mating pathway (,) is stimulated by pheromone and induces
  the FUS1promoter-eGFP reporter and a pronounced change in morphology (shmoo formation).
  In MATa cells, binding of α-factor to its GPCR (Ste2) causes release of the Gβγ
  complex from its inhibitory Gα subunit. Liberated Gβγ binds Ste20, Far1, and Ste5
  to initiate signaling. Far1 recruits the guanine exchange factor Cdc24 (), facilitating
  formation of GTP-bound Cdc42, activating Ste20. Ste20 phosphorylates MAPKKK Ste11,
  which is delivered to the membrane by association with the Ste5 scaffold protein
  and interaction (mediated by Ste50) with Cdc42. The MAPKK Ste7 and MAPK Fus3 bind
  Ste5, whereas the MAPK Kss1 does not. MATα cells respond to a different pheromone,
  a-factor, through a different GPCR (Ste3), but activate the same downstream pathway.
  Components utilized by both pathways (red) raise the potential for cross talk.
