caption: 'An overview of the SFN-induced ferroptosis pathway. SFN-induced ferroptosis
  observed in small cell lung cancer cells is triggered by the inhibition of SLC7A11,
  resulting in decreased intracellular levels of Cys and GSH. This effect leads to
  the accumulation of iron-dependent lipid ROS. Ferroptosis is inhibited by ferrostatin-1
  and DFO. SFN, sulforaphane; SLC7A11, cystine/glutamate antiporter xCT; Cys, cysteine;
  GSH, glutathione; ROS, reactive oxygen species; DFO, deferoxamine; Glu, glutamate;
  TFR: transferrin receptor; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase4.'
