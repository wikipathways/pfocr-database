caption: Graph presents functional interactomes constructed with Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis tool using lineage specific (B16-MDSCs vs DCs) differentially expressed
  proteins, which shows detailed interaction relationships between the input nodes
  (differentially expressed proteins between MDSCs and DCs), and regulatory kinases
  encircled in blue. This interactome links PI3K with cell cycle, protein synthesis
  and transport, survival and proliferation. Nodes in red, up-regulated proteins.
  Nodes in green, down-modulated proteins. In white, predicted protein nodes. A, activation;
  B, binding; C, causes/leads to; CC, chemical-chemical interaction; CP, chemical-protein
  interaction; E, expression; EC, enzyme catalysis; I, inhibition; L, proteolysis;
  LO, localization; M, biochemical modification; MB, group/complex; P, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation;
  PD Protein-DNA binding; PP Protein-Protein binding; PR Protein-RNA binding; RB Regulation
  of Binding; RE Reaction; RR RNA-RNA Binding; T Transcription; TR Translocation.
  Dash arrows, indirect interactions.
