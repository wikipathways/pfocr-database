caption: Metabolic pathway of significantly changed metabolites between gastric cancers
  and normal controls. The up arrows represent the metabolites increased in the gastric
  cancer tissues in comparison to normal controls. The down arrows represent the metabolites
  decreased in the gastric cancer tissues. Dashed lines surrounding compounds mean
  not measured or not significant between two groups
