caption: . CTNNB1/TERT signaling *Dysregulation of telomerase is an almost universal
  feature of cancer, either through genetic amplification of the gene’s own locus
  or through crosstalk activity with other signaling pathways. In this pathway mutations
  to the promoter site of TERT (C228T and C250T) increase the transcription of TERT
  through the creation of consensus binding sites for ETS transcription factors. Constitutive
  action of the MAPK pathway due to B-RAF or RAS mutations leads to upregulation of
  TERT from ETS transcription binding activity. TERT also possess a role as a transcriptional
  modulator of the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt stimulation at the plasma
  membrane leads to increased levels of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, and translocation
  to the nucleus. In the nucleus β-catenin forms a complex with TERT and the Wnt transcription
  factor BRG1. Once formed this complex binds to the promoters of Wnt target genes
  regulating the expression of these oncogenes.
