caption: Possible mechanistic links between the activation of the PKR-eIF2α branch
  of the ISR and hippocampal/cortical plasticity under physiological and age-related
  neurodegenerative conditions. The diagram represents the potential role of the double-stranded
  RNA protein kinase [protein kinase R (PKR)] in synaptic transmission efficiency
  under physiological conditions (left side) and age-related neurodegenerative conditions
  (right side). PKR-activating stimuli induce a significant increase in the phosphorylation
  (P) of the alpha subunit eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) in a dsRNA-dependent
  manner or via its endogenous activator RAX/PACT. This pathway activation promotes
  the inhibition of mRNA translation and ATF4 dependent gene reprogramming of several
  cellular functions. Altogether, PKR-eIF2α ISR branch activation may lead to cell
  adaptation or cell death. PKR-eIF2α ISR branch loss of function (LOF) under physiological
  conditions (left side) significantly modifies cortical and hippocampal receptor-mediated
  synaptic transmission. Consequently, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
  depression (LTD) are also affected. Under age-related neurodegenerative conditions
  (right side), common stimuli could participate in the activation of PKR-eIF2α ISR
  branch activation in Huntington’s diseases (HD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD). Under this activation, ATF4 translocates to the nucleus and mediates
  degenerative reprogrammation. On the other hand, the eIF2α phosphorylation decreases
  mRNA translation. This decrease in translation induces modifications in the hippocampal
  and cortex LTP and LTD through an unknown mechanism.
