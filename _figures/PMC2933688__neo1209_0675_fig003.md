caption: 'EGFR signaling and NHEJ. The binding of EGF or TGFα to EGFR activates the
  following pathways: (1) PI3K-Akt-1 pathway, (2) Ras/RAF/MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated
  (ERK) pathway, and (3) signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT)
  pathway (only the PI3K-Akt-1 pathway is shown for simplicity). EGFRvIII, a common
  deletion mutant that lacks the ligand-binding extracellular domain, is constitutively
  active and signals preferentially through the PI3K-Akt-1 pathway. In this pathway,
  activated PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) generating
  phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 anchors Akt-1 to the plasma
  membrane, where it is phosphorylated by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2
  (mTORC2) and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Activated Akt-1 phosphorylates
  a variety of downstream targets that enhance proliferation and inhibit cell death.
  The PTEN tumor suppressor negatively regulates PI3K-Akt-1 signaling by reversing
  PIP3 back to PIP2. Two models have been proposed to explain the connection between
  EGFR and NHEJ. In one scenario, wtEGFR translocates into the nucleus in response
  to IR, interacts with DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit),
  and stimulates its DNA repair activity (I). In another scenario, Akt-1 translocates
  into the nucleus in response to IR and interacts with DNA-PKcs (II). Phosphorylation
  of Akt-1 by DNA-PKcs promotes survival (curved arrow) and we hypothesize that reciprocal
  phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs by Akt-1 might promote DSB repair through NHEJ.'
