caption: DNA repair pathways in mammalian cells. A) Double-strand breaks (DSBs) activate
  DNA damage response signaling including checkpoint arrest through ATM, ATR, and
  DNA-PKcs. DSB repair pathway choice is determined by the amount of 5’ end resection
  at the DSB, inhibited by 53BP1/RIF1, promoted by BRCA1/CtIP. MRE11 initiates limited
  end resection, and this is followed by Exo1/EEPD1 and Dna2 nucleases for extensive
  resection. 53BP1/RIF1 and Ku protect DSB ends from resection, promoting classical
  nonhomologous end joining (cNHEJ). PARP1 competes with Ku and promotes limited end
  resection for alternative nonhomologous end joining (aNHEJ). RAD51 catalyzes invasion
  by the resected 3' end into the sister or other homologous sequences, and Pol δ
  catalyzes repair synthesis across the DSB. The amount of 3’ end resection regulates
  DSB pathway choice. cNHEJ requires little or no end resection, aNHEJ requires limited
  resection, and homologous recombination (HR) and single-strand annealing (SSA) require
  extensive resection. DNA polymerase θ (Pol θ) promotes a microhomology search by
  the opposing 3’ single strands after short resection in aNHEJ. The HR subpathway
  SSA requires extensive end resection to expose large homologous regions, usually
  direct repeats, with RAD52 promoting annealing, producing large deletions between
  direct repeats. B) Base excision repair repairs minor lesions (eg, oxidized bases),
  promoted by PARP1. Repair intermediates include an abasic site and nicking of the
  DNA backbone, with short gap filling by Pol β. C) Nucleotide excision repair (NER)
  repairs large helix-distorting lesions and involves excision of about 15 nucleotides
  on either side of the lesion, followed by gap filling. GG-NER and TC-NER differ
  in lesion recognition by XPA or CSA/B, respectively. D) Mismatch repair involves
  recognition of the mismatched nucleotide by MutSα/β, followed by strand nicking
  with MutL, extensive resection with Exo1, and repair synthesis. DNA ligases catalyze
  religation, the final step in all pathways. aNHEJ = alternative nonhomologous end
  joining; cNHEJ = classical nonhomologous end joining; DDR = DNA damage response;
  DSB = double-strand break; HR = homologous recombination; SSA = single-strand annealing.
