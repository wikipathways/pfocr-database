caption: Current and potential treatments for achondroplasia. In the normal growth
  plate, FGF acts on FGFR3, causing the activation of RAS and the MAPK pathway (RAF,
  ERK and MEK), resulting in the inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation
  and a reduction in extracellular matrix synthesis. Drugs for achondroplasia include
  preparations that influence the function of the FGFR3 receptor and MAPK pathways
  and directly act on chondrocytes. The first group includes, among others, drugs
  that inhibit the receptor (ASP5878, which is an inhibitor of FGFR3, and vofatamab,
  an anti-FGFR3 antibody), as well as drugs that reduce the concentration of FGFR3
  (infigratinib, which inhibits receptor phosphorylation, or statins, potentially
  causing proteasomal degradation of this molecule). The drug that competes with FGFR3
  for a ligand is sFGFR3, a soluble receptor that, by binding to FGF, reduces its
  effect on the growth plate. Drugs that inhibit the MAPK pathway are CNP analogs,
  which inhibits RAF-1, and meclizine, which inhibits ERK. By acting on FGFR3 or MAPK,
  all of these drugs consequently increase the proliferation and differentiation of
  chondrocytes, improving bone elongation growth. RhGH and PTH or PTHrP have a direct
  stimulating effect on the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes.
