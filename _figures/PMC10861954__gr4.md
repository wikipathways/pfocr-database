caption: Apoptosis and Inflammatory Signal Pathways Associated with Unremitted ER
  Stress and UPR. Chronic ERS triggers both inflammatory and apoptotic pathways of
  the UPR. IRE–1α and PERK both trigger UPR–mediated inflammation and apoptosis. Dimerization
  of PERK phosphorylates eIF2α which attenuates global mRNA translation. However,
  downstream signalling increases the expression of inflammatory genes. Furthermore,
  the activation of CHOP by p–eIF2α can also initiate inflammation and apoptosis.
  Prolonged IRE–1α activation recruits (TNF–α)–receptor–associated factor 2 (TRAF2)
  and MAP kinase (MAPKKK) (ASK1), causing downstream signalling activation of NF–κB
  and JNK which upregulate the transcription of inflammatory genes. PERK upregulates
  CHOP to promote host cell apoptosis. The formation of IRE–1α and TRAF2 complex induces
  apoptosis via caspase activation. Adapted from Sprenkle et al. (2017)
