caption: 'There is significant cross-talk between these pathways and their downstream
  effectors, which we have classified into 6 pathways for simplicity to account for
  differences in treatment modalities. The additional 4 pathways are: EGFR (blue),
  KRAS (yellow), EML4-ALK (orange), and P53/BCL (purple). It is thought that the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK
  pathway may be constitutively activated by the EML4-ALK fusion oncogene . The complex
  relationship between this pathway and EML4-ALK is indicated with a dashed line.'
