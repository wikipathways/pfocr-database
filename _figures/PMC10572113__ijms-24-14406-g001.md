caption: Nitrate Signaling Pathway. The dual-affinity nitrate transporter NRT1.1 is
  a nitrate sensor or transceptor on the plasma membrane. When the external nitrate
  concentration increases, the interaction between NRT1.1 and CNGC15 weakens, allowing
  CNGC15 to regain its calcium channel activity. PLC activity also plays a role in
  increasing cytoplasmic calcium concentration under nitrate provision. The low-nitrate
  concentration-triggered cytoplasmic calcium waves could be sensed by CBL1/9, which
  interacts with and activates CIPK23 to phosphorylate NRT1.1 at its Thr101 residue,
  switching the transporter from low-affinity to high-affinity mode. ABI2 could dephosphorylate
  and inactivate CBL1 and CIPK23. The activity of ABI2 is inhibited by ABA. CIPK8
  is found to positively regulate the low-affinity nitrate response. The CBL protein
  partner and direct target(s) of CIPK8 remain to be revealed. The nitrate-triggered
  cytoplasmic calcium waves could be sensed by CPK10/30/32. The activated CPK10/30/32
  phosphorylate NLP7 (and NLP6) at the conserved Ser205 residue to ensure its nuclear
  retention. Under carbon deficiency, SnRK1 phosphorylates NLP7 at Ser125 and Ser306,
  which increases the cytoplasmic localization and promotes the subsequent degradation
  of NLP7. Nitrate could release the inhibitory effects of SnRK1 by promoting its
  degradation. As another nitrate sensor, NLP7 directly binds to the promoters of
  the primary nitrate response genes and many downstream transcription factors genes.
  These secondary transcription factors work together with NLP7 to amplify the nitrate-response
  transcriptional cascade. Some transcription factors, such as NRG2 and TCP20, have
  direct interaction with NLP7. NLP2 and NLP6 also interact with NLP7. HBIs not only
  regulate PNR gene expression but also increase the expression levels of a set of
  antioxidant genes to reduce the accumulation of H2O2, which inhibits the nitrate-induced
  nuclear localization of NLP6 and NLP7, thereby forming a feedback regulatory loop
  to enhance the nitrate signaling. ANR1 is induced from the endosome by the Ca2+–CPKs–NLPs
  signaling pathway under high nitrate conditions. In rice, OsNRT1.1B, the postulated
  orthologue of the Arabidopsis NRT1.1 transceptor, interacts with the phosphate signaling
  repressor protein OsSPX4, which suppresses the activity of the master transcription
  factor OsNLP3. Once nitrate is sensed by OsNRT1.1B, OsNBIP1 is recruited to OsNRT1.1B–OsSPX4
  complex to mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of OsSPX4. Hence, OsNLP3 is
  released from interaction with OsSPX4 and translocates to the nucleus to trigger
  the nitrate response. It is still unknown whether the NRT1.1–SPX–NLP module exists
  in Arabidopsis.
