caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed signaling mechanism that stimulates EMT
  and cardiomyogenesis. GSNOR loss of function results in GSNO accumulation and increased
  S-nitrosylation and reduced activity of GSK-3β, a protein that targets Snail/Slug/Twist
  and β-catenin for degradation through the ubiquitin proteosome pathway. This increased
  β-catenin and Snail/Slug/Twist represses E-cadherin, promotes β-catenin association
  with TCL/LEF complexes, augmenting transcription of proliferation, migration, EMT,
  and other target genes, resulting in elevated levels of Nkx2.5 mRNA levels and accelerating
  cardiomyogenesis.
