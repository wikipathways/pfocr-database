caption: Partitioning of processes into discrete compartments enables fine regulatory
  control but presents significant barriers for crosstalk. Accordingly, cells have
  evolved transcellular energetic networks of near equilibrium reactions to facilitate
  transfer from sites of energy production to distant sites of utilization. Developmental
  enhancement of such phosphotransfer circuits, including those mediated by adenylate
  kinase (AK)/creatine kinase (CK), are integral for stem cell lineage specification.
  Beyond metabolic rheostats that can sense metabolic status, intermediary metabolism
  directly interacts with cellular signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators
  through posttranslational modification of proteins with nutrient sensitive metabolites.
  The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is a branch point in glucose metabolism that
  produces UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and is sensitive to glucose, amino
  acid, fatty acid, and nucleotide metabolism. In addition, the cytosolic concentration
  of acetyl-CoA is dependent upon cleavage of TCA cycle-derived citrate (catalyzed
  by ATP-citrate lyase) or ligation of acetate and CoA (catalyzed by acetyl-CoA synthetase).
  UDP-GlcNAc-dependent glycosylation and acetyl-CoA-dependent acetylation of proteins
  enables nucleocytoplasmic crosstalk to regulate transcription and translation, nutrient
  sensing, cell cycle, and energy metabolism that contribute to cell fate decisions.
