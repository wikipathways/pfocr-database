caption: 'Kynurenine pathwayThe kynurenine pathway (KP) constitutes the main route
  of tryptophan (Trp) degradation. More than 95% of dietary Trp is metabolized via
  the KP, and only 1% is converted to serotonin. The rate-limiting first step of the
  KP is the opening of the indole ring by either Trp-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO; liver enzyme)
  or indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO; many cell types, induced by IFN-γ). IL-18 is
  an inducer of IFN-γ, and IFN-γ induces CXCL9. l-kynurenine (Kyn) is the key compound
  metabolized by three different enzymes in mammalian tissues: (1) kynurenin-3-hydroxylase
  (or -monooxygenase [KMO]), which forms 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), quinolinic and
  picolinic acid, and finally nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+ (NAD+); (2) kynureninase
  (KYNU), which forms anthranilic acid (AA) and 3-hydroxy anthranilic acid (3-HAA);
  and (3) kynurenine aminotransferases (KAT I and KAT II), which form kynurenic acid
  (KA). KMO metabolization of Kyn to 3-HK is enhanced by vitamin B2, whereas the conversion
  of 3-HK to 3-HAA is enhanced by vitamin B6.'
