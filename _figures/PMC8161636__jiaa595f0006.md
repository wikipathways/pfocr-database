caption: Babesia microti transmission cycle in natural populations of Peromyscus leucopus
  and Ixodes scapularis based on laboratory experiments and field data. Horizontal
  initial infection of a female host may occur in spring when nymphs are present,
  at the same time these females may become pregnant. Litters (F1 generation) are
  produced in late spring or early summer and 73.9% of these offspring would be infected
  with B. microti through vertical transmission. In mid–late summer, I. scapularis
  larvae feed on infected F1 generation mice and 61.4% of these larvae would acquire
  B. microti through horizontal transmission. Of the larval cohort, 39.0% of them
  survive and molt into the nymph life stage with 57.6% of them maintaining infection
  transstadially. These nymphs overwinter and emerge to infect new hosts and reinfect
  previous year hosts the following spring/summer (April–August). In the fall, originally
  infected female mice and infected F1 offspring could both have litters (second F1
  and F2 generations, respectively); of these offspring 55.6% and 38.2%, respectively,
  could be infected via vertical transmission. Chronic infection persisted on average
  for 9 months, therefore originally infected female mice along with F2 generation
  mice could produce fall litters with some infected offspring, resulting in infected
  individuals in the spring before nymphs are abundant in the environment. Infected
  nymphs may initially infect or reinfect mice in the spring contributing to a new
  generation of highly infected individuals. This scenario does not take into account
  biotic and abiotic variations that may affect host mortality, reproduction, or multiple
  infection events that are likely to occur in a natural system. Red individuals represent
  infection, black individuals denote an uninfected individual, and natural-colored
  individuals depict initially infected individuals.
