caption: Enzyme subcellular localization prediction of two complete metabolic pathways,
  including the TCA cycle (black rectangles) and glyoxylate cycle (grey rectangles),
  and a subset of the ethanol oxidation pathway (white rectangles), given localization
  data for enzymes in other connected pathways (white ellipses) as input. Transport
  reactions are marked by dotted arrows.
