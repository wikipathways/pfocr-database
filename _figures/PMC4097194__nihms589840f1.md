caption: (a) In the prototypical two-component pathway (left), the catalytic and ATPase
  (CA) domain of a histidine kinase binds ATP and autophosphorylates a conserved histidine
  in the dimerization and histidine phosphotransferase (DHp) domain. The phosphoryl
  group is then transferred to an aspartate in the receiver domain (RD) of the cognate
  response regulator, activating its output domain to effect cellular changes, frequently
  through changes in transcription. In a phosphorelay (right), a hybrid histidine
  kinase autophosphorylates and transfers its phosphoryl group intramolecularly to
  a receiver domain. A histidine phosphotransferase (HPT) then shuttles the phosphoryl
  group to a soluble response regulator that effects a pathway output. (b) Common
  domain organizations of histidine kinases and response regulators. For histidine
  kinases, the DHp and CA domains are shown with common intracellular domains, PAS,
  HAMP, and GAF. Note that some kinases have multiple copies of such domains. Two
  transmembrane domains (TM) are shown on the kinases, but kinases can harbor from
  1-13 TM domains. A wide range of sensory domains (not shown) are often found in
  the periplasmic portions of membrane-bound histidine kinases. For response regulators,
  the conserved receiver domain is shown alone or with the common output domains,
  a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a AAA+ and DBD, a GGDEF domain involved in cyclic-di-GMP
  synthesis, or a CheB-like methyltransferase domain.
