caption: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway. (Left) Cells not activated by Wnt signaling
  exist in an “OFF state”. In the “OFF State” a so-called destruction complex is formed,
  comprised of Axin, CK1α, APC and GSK-3β. The complex phosphorylates (P) β-Catenin,
  which leads to its degradation. (Right) Wnt binds to the cell membrane receptor
  Frizzled (Fz), which turns the cell into an “ON State”. Frizzled then forms a complex
  with LRP-5/-6, which results in the recruitment of Disheveled (Dsh), a phosphoprotein.
  Dsh interacts with the destruction complex and translocates it to the membrane.
  Here, Axin binds to LRP-5/-6 and the destruction complex is degraded. This allows
  β-Catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and subsequently enter the nucleus, where
  it activates transcription of the TCF/LEF.
