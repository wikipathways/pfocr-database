caption: 'Hypothetical simplified primary and modulatory neural circuitry underlying
  acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition with presumed or confirmed neurotransmitters.
  In the primary ASR pathway (orange), the startle pulse sound information is transmitted
  via the auditory nerve to cochlear root neurons (CRN) in rodents which give short-latency
  input to the PnC (Pontine Reticular Nucleus, Caudal). These neurons project directly
  to cranial and spinal cord motoneurons to produce the motor response. Multiple pathways
  have been identified for sensorimotor gating modulating ASR. The acoustic prepulse
  is processed through the ascending auditory pathway (gray dotted frame) via the
  cochlear nucleus (CN) and the inferior colliculus. From there the prepulse information
  is transmitted directly or indirectly to the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus
  (PPT) and neighboring region laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. Projections from the
  PPT to the PnC mediate PPI as a form of feed-forward inhibition. The PPT receives
  modulatory input (green pathway) from a variety of brain structures that can influence
  PPI e.g., linked with fear and arousal. Abbreviations: ACh, Acetyl choline; GABA,
  gamma aminobutyric acid; Glu, Glutamate; Gly, Glycine; DA, Dopamine; 5-HT, Serotonine;
