caption: Schematic representation of cell wall recycling and β-lactamase expression
  in Gram-negative bacteria. The remodelling of the peptidoglycan polymer occurs during
  growth and septation, and lytic breakdown can be provoked by antimicrobials. Petidoglycan
  fragments (N-acetylglucosamine (blue)-anhydromuramyl (green)-pentapetide (black))
  are liberated by lytic transglycosylase activity, transported to the cytoplasm through
  the AmpG permease, and hydrolysed by NagZ to create anhydromuramyl peptides. Under
  normal circumstances, the anhydromuropeptides are hydrolysed by AmpD, and through
  a series of reactions reused as cell-wall precursors. If anhydromuropeptides accumulate
  and bind to the regulatory protein AmpR, the production of AmpC β-lactamase is induced.
  The pentapeptide released by AmpD can be directly linked to UDP-muramic acid (orange)
  by mureine peptide ligase Mpl, or a pentapeptide can be assembled in successive
  steps (MurCDEF and Ddl). The Mpl product, UDP-Muramyl-pentapeptide, can be processed
  in the biosynthetic pathway and integrated in the nascent cell wall. UDP-Muramyl-pentapeptide
  also binds to the regulatory protein AmpR as a repressor ligand, decreasing the
  production of AmpC β-lactamase. (Based on references Johnson 2013 [], Calvopiña
  2018 [], and Park 2008 []).
