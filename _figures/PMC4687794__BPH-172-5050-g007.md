caption: Diagram of the signalling pathways downstream of CCK‐8s in pancreatic beta
  cells. CCK‐8s binds to CCK1 receptors on the plasma membrane of pancreatic beta
  cells, promoting the formation of complexes of CCK1 receptor‐Gq and CCK1 receptor‐Gs.
  Activation of Gq produces IP3, which induces intracellular calcium release and is
  critical for insulin secretion. At the same time, CCK1 receptors activate Gs and
  increases intracellular cAMP. cAMP activates PKA and Epac, leading to the translocation
  of phosphorylated ERK2 into the nucleus. The Gs‐mediated pathway also underlies
  the regulation of CCK‐8s‐induced insulin secretion in high glucose condition. In
  addition to Gq and Gs, CCK1 receptors also form complexex with β‐arrestin‐1. The
  CCK1 receptor‐β‐arrestin‐1 complex is responsible for the long‐term cytosol ERK
  activation and initiates the ERK‐pRSK90‐Bad‐Caspase‐3 anti‐apoptotic pathway. The
  interplay between β‐arrestin‐1 and the Gspathway is required for efficient insulin
  secretion.
