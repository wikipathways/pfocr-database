caption: Regulation of apoptosis. Apoptosis can be induced via the death-receptor-dependent
  pathway (extrinsic pathway) or the mitochondria-dependent pathway (intrinsic pathway).
  The extrinsic pathway is initiated in the liver by death ligands such as TNF, Fas
  ligand (FasL, CD95L), and TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), following
  their binding to their relevant death receptors. In contrast, the intrinsic pathway
  is triggered by a variety of intracellular stressors such as DNA damage, growth-actor
  deprivation, and metabolic disturbances from the extracellular matrix and/or surrounding
  cells.
