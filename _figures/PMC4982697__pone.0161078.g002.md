caption: Several genes involved in MVA pathway were up-regulated, whereas none of
  the MEP pathway genes were up-regulated. Products of the MVA pathway appear to be
  targeted to sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis rather than to sterol
  biosynthesis. AACT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
