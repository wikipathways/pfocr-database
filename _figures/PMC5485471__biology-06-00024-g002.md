caption: Metabolically important reactions and side reactions involved in the metabolism
  of 2-oxosuccinamate (2-OSM) (A) and 2-oxoglutaramate (2-OGM) (B). The asparaginase
  II pathway (bottom of panel A) and the glutaminase II pathway (bottom of panel B)
  may be regarded as major metabolic pathways for l-asparagine and l-glutamine, respectively.
  On the other hand, excessive formation of l-2-HSM and l-2-HGM as side reactions
  may be regarded as metabolic mistakes, so that repair pathways for their conversion
  to metabolically useful l-malate/oxaloacetate (Panel A) and 2-OG (Panel B) are required.
  Not shown is the formation of d-2-HG by mutant IDHs and the possible utilization
  of this compound as a substrate of GS (Gln Synthetase). For clarity, some cofactors
  and co-substrates have been omitted from the diagram.
