caption: The 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolism pathway. In tumour cells 5-FU is converted
  to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP) by the action of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase.
  5-FdUMP inhibits the DNA synthesis by competing with deoxyuridine monophosphate
  (dUMP) for binding to thymidylate synthase in a complex that is stabilized by the
  reduced folate 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. 5-FU can also inhibit RNA synthesis
  in a pathway that involves its metabolism by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase to
  5-fluorouridine monophosphate (5-FUMP) and subsequent conversion to 5-fluorouridine
  triphosphate (5-FUTP) via 5-fluorouridine diphosphate (5-FUDP). Extracellular catabolism
  of 5-FU by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase reduces the level of 5-FU for the uptake
  into the tumour cells
