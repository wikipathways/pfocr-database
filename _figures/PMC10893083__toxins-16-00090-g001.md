caption: 'The cellular roles of mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in Fusarium–cereal
  interactions. Plant genes and pathways that are responsive to DON or influence the
  DON response and that are involved in Fusarium disease resistance and susceptibility
  are illustrated (reviewed by [1,14,16]). Detoxification of DON by UGTs and GST (Fhb7)
  [1,14,31] is one of the main cellular mechanisms to counteract the deleterious effects
  of DON, with the possible transport of modified DON into the vacuole. The signalling
  protein complex TaFROG/TaSnRK1α targeted by the Fusarium effector OSP24 is activated
  by DON at the transcriptional level (e.g., by TaFROG) or at a post-translational
  level (phosphorylation of TaSnRK1α) and is thought to be involved in host immunity
  [32,33]. DON-induced cell death is regulated by plant hormone signalling components
  gibberellin (DELLA) and ethylene (EIN2) [34,35]. DON induces the production of ROS
  and several plant defence metabolites (brown hexagons) that can influence plant
  cell wall composition and modulate Fusarium mycotoxin production [36,37,38]. It
  is not known yet if plant VOCs can influence DON biosynthesis. Genes are represented
  by oval shapes, with the inner colour depicting genes involved in detoxification
  (green), signalling (blue), reactive oxygen species and/or cell death (orange),
  or transcription factors (light grey). The green outer ring represents disease/toxin
  resistance genes that have been shown to enhance both DON and Fusarium resistance
  (non-dashed) or only one of the two traits (dashed). FHB susceptibility genes are
  illustrated with red circles. Lines represent known direct/indirect interactions
  (solid lines) and the hypothetical activation of downstream components (dashed lines).
  Black and red arrows, respectively, represent an induction or a repression of gene
  expression. Abbreviations: BX, benzoxazinoid; DON, deoxynivalenol; ET, ethylene;
  GLU, glucosyl; GSH, glutathione; HCCA, hydroxycinnamic acid amide, JA, jasmonic
  acid; PA, polyamine; PhA, phenolic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SA, salicylic
