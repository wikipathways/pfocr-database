caption: 'An overview of EGFR and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. EGFR signaling pathway.
  On binding of specific ligands, the EGF receptor dimerizes, activating an array
  of molecules including kinases, Grbs, and so on, initiating several downstream signaling
  cascades—MAPK, PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT—which upregulate multiple transcription factors,
  anti-apoptotic and prosurvival proteins pushing the cells toward prolonged survival,
  proliferation, migration, and tumorigenesis. Wnt signaling pathway. In the absence
  of Wnt, β-catenin is captured by APC and Axin and forms a destruction complex in
  which its phosphorylation by the kinases CK1α and GSK3β is facilitated, which, in
  turn, allows binding of β-TrCP, which subsequently mediates the proteasomal degradation
  of β-catenin. On binding of the Wnt ligand to its cognate receptors Fzd and LRP5/6
  triggers the formation of Dvl–Fzd complexes and the phosphorylation of LRP by CK1γ,
  facilitating relocation of Axin to the membrane and inactivation of the destruction
  complex. This allows β-catenin to accumulate and enter the nucleus, where it interacts
  with members of the Tcf/Lef family and exerts its transcriptional activity. For
  a more comprehensive and detailed account of these pathways, the readers should
  consult excellent reviews available in the literature.Abbreviations: AR, amphiregulin;
  EPG, epigen; EREG, epiregulin; Cbl E3 ligase, casitas B-lineage lymphoma; mTOR,
