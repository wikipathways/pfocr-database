caption: The anti-inflammatory response initiated downstream of the IL-10R. Binding
  of IL-10 to its receptor activates a major JAK1-TYK2-STAT3 signaling cascade, which
  culminates with the induction of the STAT3-mediated anti-inflammatory response.
  The STAT3 transcriptional reprogramming results in a number of molecules that include
  transcriptional repressors, chromatin modifiers, and post-transcriptional or post-translational
  regulators. Together, these molecules will limit the inflammatory response induced
  for example downstream of PRR activation. Recently, IL-10 has been shown to modulate
  the transcription of several metabolic regulators, including DDIT4, in a STAT3-dependent
  way. As DDIT4 is a regulator of mTORC, the IL-10R signaling limits the glycolytic
  flux downstream of TLR4 activation, which in turn controls the inflammatory response
  of the macrophage. In addition to the JAK-STAT3 pathway, STAT1, STAT5, and the PI3K-Akt
  cascade have also been reported to mediate IL-10 responses. The metabolic regulator
  AMPK has been reported to activate the PI3K-Akt-mTORC cascade, but also STAT3, in
  response to IL-10. STAT3 is moreover activated downstream of receptors for other
  IL-10 family cytokines, IL-6, and a number of other cytokines and growth factors.
  How the cell distinguishes the anti- from the pro-inflammatory reprogramming downstream
  of STAT3 activation is not fully understood, but the IL-10–induced SOCS3 has been
  reported to play an important role by blocking STAT3 at least downstream of the
  IL-6R, but not of the IL-10R. DUSP, dual-specifity phosphatase; Gsk3β, glycogen

    Binding of IL-10 to its receptor activates a major JAK1-TYK2-STAT3 signaling cascade,
