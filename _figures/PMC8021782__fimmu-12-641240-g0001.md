caption: 'Hepatic Dendritic Cells responses in immune tolerance and in hepatic inflammation.
  (A) Immune Tolerance: CD11c+cDC immature HDCs contribute to immune tolerance secreting
  IL10, TGFB, limiting T cell expansion and provoking their deletion, reducing the
  expression of TLR. DCs also contribute to the slot of apoptotic debris. (B) Hepatic
  Inflammation: Mature HDCs (cDC2) provokes a pro-inflammatory environment, recruiting
  macrophages into the liver. The hepatocytes also contribute to the inflammation
  secreting HMGB1, PGE2, NRLP3, and activating NFkB pathway. Activation of the inflammasone
  NLRP3 cause hepatocyte death with the consequent secretion of DAMPS, triggering
  KCs death. Neutrophils activate Kupffer and endothelial cells upregulating ICAM1
  and VCAM1. The complement cascade is also activated contributing to inflammation.'
