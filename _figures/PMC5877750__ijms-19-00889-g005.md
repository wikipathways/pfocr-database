caption: Mechanism of action of temolozamide (TMZ). TMZ methylates guanine (G) paired
  with cytosine (C) in the genomic DNA at the O6 position, yielding O6-methyl guanine
  (MeO6G). The methyl group can be removed from G by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
  (MGMT), otherwise MeO6G can be paired with thymine (T) by DNA polymerase (DNA pol)
  in the next replication round, giving the MeO6G:T mismatch, which can be processed
  by mismatch repair (MMR) system. When these DNA repair mechanisms cannot cope with
  all MeO6Gs and their consequences, the cell is arrested at the cell cycle checkpoint,
  G1/S or G2/M, to have more time for repair. If this fails, the cell can adopt senescence
  or be directed on a programmed death pathway, usually apoptosis. Autophagy is another
  effect, which can be induced by TMZ and it can interact with senescence and apoptosis
  (more details in the main text). Extremely high TMZ concentrations can induce necrosis
  due to general toxicity of this drug. MeO6G is not the only DNA damage induced by
  TMZ.
