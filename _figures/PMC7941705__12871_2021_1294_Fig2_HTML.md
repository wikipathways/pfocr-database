caption: 'Anesthetic affect pro- and anti-cancer miRNA expressions leading to cancer
  biology changes. a. Inhalational anesthetic reagents modulate miRNA expressions.
  Isoflurane exposure to ovarian cancer cells increases glycolysis via PI3K/Akt pathway
  and HIF-1α by miR-21 upregulation, one of oncogenes. Sevoflurane inhibits cancer
  cell proliferation via PI3K/Akt pathway with miR-203 upregulation in breast cancer
  cells. In CRC, sevoflurane reduces cancer invasion and migration via the suppression
  of ERK pathway and MMP-9 by miR-203 upregulation. For glioma cells, sevoflurane
  increases miR-637 expressions resulting in the decrease of cancer migration and
  invasion via Akt pathway inhibition. b. Propofol exposure alters anti-cancer miRNAs.
  Propofol upregulates miR-143 in osteosarcoma cells, decreasing cancer cell proliferation
  by MMP-13 inhibition via PI3K/Akt pathway. In gastric cancer cells, propofol exposure
  induces apoptosis via PI3K/Akt pathway and MMP-2 by miR-218 upregulation whereas
  propofol causes apoptosis by miR-451 in glioblastoma cells. For hepatocellular carcinoma,
  propofol decreases MMP-9 expression by PI3K/Akt pathway suppression via miR-199a
  upregulation. Ov: ovarian cancer cell, BC: breast cancer cell, G: glioma, CRC: colorectal
