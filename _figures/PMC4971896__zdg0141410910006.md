caption: Schematic overview of the regulation of GLUT4 translocation. Insulin stimulates
  Akt phosphorylation and activity, whereas muscle contraction activates AMPK by inducing
  phosphorylation of Thr172 and by allosteric activation by AMP. Muscle contraction
  can also activate Akt, but the importance of this signaling pathway for glucose
  uptake remains unclear. AMPK and Akt are established kinases of the phosphorylation
  sites on AS160 and TBC1D1 investigated in this study, but other kinases activated
  by muscle contraction could also be involved. P, phosphorylation; ?, putative protein
  or mechanism. Solid arrows illustrate established relationships between stimuli,
  signals, and glucose transport; dashed arrows are used for putative interactions.
