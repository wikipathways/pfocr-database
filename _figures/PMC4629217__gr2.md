caption: The roles of FXR in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism. On one hand,
  FXR plays an important role in regulating lipid metabolism. Activation of FXR by
  BAs or synthetic agonists lowers plasma triglyceride levels by a mechanism that
  involves the repression of hepatic transcription factor SREBP-1c expression and
  its lipogenic target genes in mouse primary hepatocytes and liver. FXR activation
  also increases the expression of apolipoprotein Apo CII and AIV and decreases the
  expression of both Apo CIII 112 and ANGTPL3 to stimulate LPL activity. In addition,
  FXR mediates the repression of paraoxonase 1 to inactivate pro-atherogenic lipids
  produced by oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein. Furthermore, FXR
  activation promotes fatty acid β-oxidation by inducing the expression of PPARα.
  Finally, activation of FXR facilitates the clearance of very low-density lipoproteins
  and chylomicrons via repressing the expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer
  protein and apolipoprotein B (Apo B). On the other hand, FXR exerts a critical role
  in regulating glucose homeostasis. Activation of FXR in βTC6 cells increases Akt
  phosphorylation and translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT2 at plasma membrane,
  increasing the glucose uptake by these cells. FXR-KLF11 regulated pathway has an
  essential role in the regulation of insulin transcription and secretion induced
  by glucose. Furthermore, FXR-SHP negative regulatory cascade can regulate gluconeogenesis
  in the liver.
