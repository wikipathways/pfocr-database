caption: Synthesis of DNA precursors in the cytosol and mitochondria. The synthesis
  of dNTPs occurs by two pathways, ribonucleotide reductase-dependent de novo synthesis
  in the cytosol and salvage of deoxynucleosides, performed by two parallel sets of
  kinases in the cytosol and in mitochondria. Ribonucleotide reductase changes its
  subunit composition during S-phase (R1/R2) and outside S-phase or in non-dividing/differentiated
  cells (R1/p53R2). The first step of the salvage pathway is catalyzed by deoxynucleoside
  kinases TK1 and deoxycytidine kinase in the cytosol and TK2 and dGK in mitochondria.
  The R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and TK1 appear at the beginning of S-phase
  and are degraded before completion of mitosis. Several catabolic activities participate
  in the regulation of the pools. The catabolic activity of 5′-nucleotidases (5′-NT)
  counteracts the irreversible reaction catalyzed by deoxynucleoside kinases creating
  regulatory “substrate cycles” both in the cytosol and mitochondria. The newly discovered
  deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1 converts dNTPs to deoxynucleosides ().
  dNTPs move freely across the nuclear envelope creating a single pool of cytosolic
  and nuclear dNTPs, separated from mt dNTP pools by the impermeable mt inner membrane.
  Protein carriers in this membrane (double-headed arrows) establish a bidirectional
  communication between the two pools. The dNTPs are used in the nucleus and in mitochondria
  for DNA replication and repair.
