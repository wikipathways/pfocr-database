caption: B-cell activation and response in the gut shape the gut microbiota through
  IgA secretion. When naïve B cells reach the mature state, they can activate and
  differentiate toward plasma cells (PC) through two pathways in the gut. B cells
  can encounter antigens in extrafollicular areas within the lamina propria, a process
  that induces their transformation into IgM-secreting PC. This pathway constitutes
  the T-independent activation of B cells. This population is characterized by low
  expression of the activation-induced deaminase (AICDA or AID), the reason why they
  do not undergo somatic hypermutation nor class switch recombination. Alternatively,
  B cells can enter the follicular areas located in the Peyer’s patches, where they
  closely interact with previously primed CD4+ T cells. These lymphocytes have already
  been in contact with dendritic cells and have experienced antigen presentation,
  allowing the T cells to activate B cells. This T-dependent activation induces proliferation
  of B cells, giving place to germinal centers (GCs) and expression of AID and BCL6.
  Together, these factors allow activated B cells to undergo somatic hypermutation,
  class switch recombination, and ultimately, IgA synthesis. Newly-secreted IgA binds
  the local bacteria and shapes the microbiota composition. This image has been created
  with Biorender.
