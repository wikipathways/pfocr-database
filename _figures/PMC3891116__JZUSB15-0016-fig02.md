caption: Essential cell signaling pathways for prostate cancer (PCa) development and
  crosstalks between themThe interaction of circulating androgens (T/DHT) with AR
  is critical for PCa growth. Also, estrogens (E) and their corresponding receptors
  (ER) have a prominent role in prostate carcinogenesis, either by genomic or non-genomic
  actions. In advanced PCa, when the amount of available androgens is limited, other
  cytokines and growth factors promote synergic activities of AR. These molecules
  include TGF-β/BMPs, IL-6, EGF, IGF-1, VEGF, and FGF. Thus, androgen-responsive genes
  continue to be produced, although target genes differ between androgen-dependent
  and androgen-independent cells. In addition to their effects on the androgen pathway,
  these cell signals retain the ability to promote PCa overall survival, growth, and
  dissemination through alternative molecular targets. Grey arrows represent the androgen
  signaling in androgen-dependent PCa. Black arrows represent the prominent activated
  pathways in androgen-independent PCa. Dashed black arrows denote the crosslinks
  between cell signaling pathways. Black triangles symbolize up/down-regulation of
