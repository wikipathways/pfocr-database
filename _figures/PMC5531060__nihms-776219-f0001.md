caption: Ribosome biogenesis is a highly dynamic cellular event that determines the
  shift of ribosomal proteins (RPs) between ribosome structural components or unassembled
  RP available for transmitting signals to p53. In response to ribosomal stressors
  such as chemical agents, serum starvation, or nutrient deprivation, RPs translocate
  from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm where particular RPs, such as RPL5 and RPL11,
  bind to MDM2 to abrogate MDM2 E3 ligase activity and activate p53. Oncogenic stimulation
  leads to hyperactivation of RP expression and rRNA synthesis. The elevated de novo
  RP synthesis facilitates ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus and simultaneously
  increases the nucleoplasmic concentration of free RPs which are available to bind
  to MDM2 and activate p53.
