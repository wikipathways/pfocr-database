caption: Assembly of targeting patches and inside–out orientation of the secretory
  pathway. (a) Molecular hardware for assembly of a targeting patch. Targeting patches
  (SNAREs [pink], SNARE-binding proteins [purple, green], and the exocyst [yellow])
  are assembled within distinct regions of the plasma membrane, as defined through
  the interaction of adhesion molecules (blue) with the membrane skeleton (red). Targeting
  patch assembly is further reinforced by cell-adhesion-activated signaling. SNARE
  proteins and components of the exocyst interact with Rab GTPases and other small
  GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily (e.g. Ral and Rho [orange]). (b) Outside–in
  cues and inside–out orientation of the secretory pathway. Budding of vesicles from
  the Golgi complex (pale blue) and their transport along the cytoskeleton (orange)
  can be influenced by the same molecular events that trigger and reinforce the assembly
  of a targeting patch. Rho family GTPases (dark orange; RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42) are activated
  during cadherin-mediated cell–cell adhesion, and Cdc42 has been shown to influence
  protein export from the Golgi complex. In addition, cadherin-mediated cell adhesion
  induces stabilization of the microtubule minus ends; and during the formation of
  the immunological synapse, the MTOC (orange) is drawn vectorially to sites of cell–cell
  contact (dashed arrow).
