caption: 'A) Small intestinal tuft cells sense the presence of helminth worms via
  an unidentified receptor and ligand. Tuft cell-derived IL-25 and CysLTs activate
  lamina propria ILC2s to drive epithelial remodeling, eosinophilia, and worm clearance.
  The calcium-gated cation channel TRPM5, downstream of canonical taste transduction
  in taste cells, is also required for helminth sensing, though Gnat3−/− mice are
  not affected. Additionally, while some helminths can produce succinate as a metabolic
  byproduct, Sucnr1−/− mice have no defect in tuft hyperplasia in response to helminth
  infection. Following initial activation and IL-13 signaling, tuft cells express
  TAS2Rs, which may sense “bitter” substances found in T. spiralis excretory-secretory
  products, and result in additional release of IL-25. G-alpha O/I subunits, as well
  as the G-gamma 13 subunit and PLCB2, have also been implicated in T. spiralis sensing
  and IL-25 release. Potentiating TRPM5 with stevioside is sufficient to cause release
  of IL-25. Specifically in the distal SI, tuft cells monitor the metabolite succinate,
  which can be produced by Tritrichomonas protists as well as dysbiotic bacteria.
  Unlike helminth sensing, GNAT3 is required for the succinate response, as are PLCB2
  and TRPM5, indicating a canonical taste transduction pathway. B) Airway tuft cells
  have been studied most thoroughly in the respiratory and tracheal epithelia. Respiratory
  tuft cells (and olfactory tuft cells) use the receptor P2Y2 to sense ATP released
  from cells via an unknown mechanism following treatment with Alternaria alternata
  or house dust mite. ATP signaling drives increased intracellular Ca2+ and release
  of CysLTs that recruit eosinophils and amplify type 2 inflammation. It remains unclear
  if tracheal tuft cells produce CysLTs. Respiratory tuft cells also express numerous
  TAS2Rs, which bind denatonium and the “bitter” QSMs produced by certain Gram-negative
  bacteria. Signaling activates the canonical taste transduction pathway, resulting
  in release of ACh that signals on peptidergic neurons to rapidly induce a drop in
  breathing rate and neurogenic inflammation. In the trachea, where tuft cells are
  less extensively innervated, sensing of bacterial formylated peptides, QSMs, or
  denatonium activate PLCB2, Ca2+ flux, and TRPM5-dependent ACh release. Via CHRMs,
  ACh signals in both a paracrine fashion on neighboring ciliated cells to increase
  ciliary beat frequency and in an autocrine fashion on tuft cells to enhance or suppress
  the magnitude of Ca2+ flux. While TAS2Rs are assumed to be required for sensing
  QSMs and denatonium, they are not involved in formylated peptide sensing; the actual
  receptor remains unidentified. Dashed arrows indicate unconfirmed pathways. Abbreviations:
