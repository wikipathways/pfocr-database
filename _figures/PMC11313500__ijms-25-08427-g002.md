caption: Molecular pathway mechanisms of cytokines and chemokines associated with
  inflammation for the progression of pulmonary hypertension. TGF-β signaling pathway
  is divided into classical (Smad-dependent) and nonclassical (Smad-independent) pathways.
  After the ligands bind to the complex of type I and type II receptors, type II receptors
  induce phosphorylation of type I receptors, causing the recruitment of Smad. The
  signaling transduction is that Smad1/5/8 or Smad 2/3 translocates into the nucleus
  by forming a complex with Smad4. In the noncanonical way, TGF-β receptor complexes
  activate signals through other factors. IL-6 combines IL-6R (classic) or IL6R with
  soluble IL6R (trans) to mediate the activation of downstream pathways. Through the
  formation of the IL-1 and IL1R (IL1RI and IL-1R accessory protein) complexes, related
  pathways become active after interacting with MyD88. Certain chemokines participate
  in the relevant signal transduction by binding to corresponding receptors, such
  as CCL2/CCR2. Also, the involvement of TLR is regarded as an important factor. The
  downstream signaling pathways consisting of MAPK and Nf-κB contribute to life processes
  by regulating gene expression. The effects of these immune and inflammatory pathways
  on the pathogenesis of PH are of significance for targeted therapy and disease treatment

  description: Molecular pathway mechanisms of cytokines and chemokines associated
    with inflammation for the progression of pulmonary hypertension. TGF-β signaling
    pathway is divided into classical (Smad-dependent) and nonclassical (Smad-independent)
    pathways. After the ligands bind to the complex of type I and type II receptors,
    type II receptors induce phosphorylation of type I receptors, causing the recruitment
    of Smad. The signaling transduction is that Smad1/5/8 or Smad 2/3 translocates
