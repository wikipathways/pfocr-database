caption: Crucial cells and molecules involved in postsynaptic responses in the regenerative
  niche at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In normally innervated NMJs
  (A), agrin/LRP4/MuSK signalling is triggered by nerve terminal‐secreted agrin, which
  leads to Dok7 activation with the subsequent clustering of nAChRs mediated by rapsyn,
  specifically in regions that correlate with presynaptic active zones (a). Importantly,
  nAChR surface levels are stable and are maintained by an active turnover process
  (b). Distinct routes modulate either positively or negatively nAChR levels in the
  postsynaptic membrane, including nAChR recycling, de novo synthesis, or nAChR degradation
  (c). Skeletal muscle fibre denervation (B) leads to the loss of muscle membrane
  organization (d), along with decreased nAChR stability at the cell surface, triggering
  an increase in nAChR degradation over nAChR turnover, thus decreasing nAChR levels
  after long‐term denervation. Moreover, in order to maintain NMJ organization, effectors
  of the agrin/LRP4/MuSK pathway increase their expression after NMJ injury (e), whereas
  the matrix metalloproteinase MMP3 secreted by terminal Schwann cells becomes inactive
  (f) avoiding agrin processing and therefore increasing agrin levels in the synaptic
  region. Also, terminal Schwann cells secrete agrin and neuregulin specifically at
  their extended processes (g), leading to nAChR synthesis in non‐synaptic muscle
  regions. ACh, acetylcholine; AChR, acetylcholine receptor; Dok7, downstream of tyrosine
  kinase 7; LRP4, lipoprotein receptor related protein‐4; MMP3, matrix metalloproteinase
  3; MuSK, muscle‐specific tyrosine kinase receptor; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptor; rapsyn, 43 kDa receptor‐associated protein of the synapse.
