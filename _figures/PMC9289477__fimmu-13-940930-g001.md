caption: PD-1 suppresses T-cell activation by inhibiting several kinase pathways.
  T-cell activation occurs when the TCR binds the antigen (Ag) presented by MHC II.
  This first signal results in ZAP70, Lck, and Fyn recruitment to the CD3-ζ chain
  proximal to the TCR. The first signal promotes the ERK/MAPK and PKC-θ activation.
  The second signal occurs when CD28 binds to B7-1/2 and results in PI3K recruitment
  and downstream AKT pathway activation. PD-1 intrinsically suppresses T-cell activation.
  Upon interaction with PD-L1/2 the ITSM domain of PD-1 recruits SHP-1/2. Activated
  SHP-1/2 inhibit ZAP70 and PKC-θ phosphorylation. The ITIM domain of PD-1 is also
  phosphorylated and recruits SHP-1. This activated SHP-1 inhibits PI3K phosphorylation
  resulting in suppression of the AKT pathway. These mechanisms of PD-1 induced suppression
  results in reduced cytokine production, metabolic activity, proliferation, and B-cell
  lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL) mediated survival.
