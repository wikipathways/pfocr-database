caption: Possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory responses. a) NOD-like
  receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) is activated by virus, Ca2+ influx or ROS (induced via
  viroporins (a1) or TRPV4 (a2)) and binds to the precursor of caspase-1 (procaspase-1)
  through the adaptor protein ASC in the cell to form a multiprotein complex, thereby
  activating caspase-1. b) Entry of danger-associated molecular pattern (self- DNA)
  into the cytoplasm from the nucleus of mitochondria or dead cells activates the
  cGAS–STING pathway. c) Binding of viral PAMPs/DAMPs to the TLRs and activation of
  transcription factors for inducing proinflammatory factors. d) Viral structural
  proteins or binding of virus-Ab complex to FcR can also activate proinflammatory
  responses via MAPK signaling. e) Binding of the spike protein to ACE2 induces ADAM
  17 activity, thereby reducing the number of ACE2 expressed on the cell surface.
