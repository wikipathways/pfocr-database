caption: Sucralose Metabolic Impacts on Differentiated Human Neuroblastoma Cells (SH-SY5Y
  cell line). Cells were differentiated using all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for nine
  days. Differentiated cells were then treated with three different concentrations
  of sucralose (SUC). Afterwards, cells were treated with insulin and/or levodopa.
