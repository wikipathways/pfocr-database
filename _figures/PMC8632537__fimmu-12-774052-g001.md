caption: 'Study design and hypothesis: Expanded Hemodialysis Therapy ameliorates systemic
  Inflammation and endothelial maladaptation and dysfunction. (A) The medical need
  for Expanded Hemodialysis Therapy and clinical study design: The hemodialysis field
  has been shown a near exponential growth in the past decades, with >167.000 publications
  on PUBMED containing the search-term “Hemodialysis” in 2020. Recently, particular
  attention has been placed into lowering chronic treatment-associated adverse cardiovascular
  diseases (CVD) and new optimized treatment concepts, such as “Expanded Hemodialysis
  Therapy” with improved molecular cut-off hemodialyzers (, ). Within the PERCI-II
  study n=48 hemodialysis patients underwent crossover randomized multi-center comparison
  employing novel medium-cut-off (MCO; MCOI-Ci400, Gambro) dialyzers in comparison
  to standard of care high-flux (HF) hemodialyzers (PERCI-II-MCO; ClinicalTrials.gov:
  NCT02084381) (). These novel MCO dialyzers have an improved molecular size cut-off,
  which positively modulates systemic microinflammation (). (B) Goal of the follow
  up study: To Elucidate the Molecular and Biological Mechanisms: In the present study,
  we explore the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying this positive antiinflammatory
  shift and evaluate promising leads identified during the first screen in 2017. In
  particular, we study the modulation of TNF-superfamily members in sera of patients
  undergoing MCO dialysis and how this impacts on uremia- and TNF-α-induced endothelial
  maladaptation and dysfunction (left panel) and the molecular mechanisms (right panel),
  resulting in aberrant VEGF induction and angiogenesis. Our VEGF promoter activation
  studies and adjunct signaling pathway experiments elucidated that this detrimental
  uremia- and TNF-α-induced signaling is mediated via AP-1/c-FOS signaling and that
  alterations in the serum ratio between TNF-α and sTNF-R1, but not sTNF-R2, are potential
  indicators for endothelial maladaptation. These findings provide new avenues for
  molecular targets and treatment modalities to reduce chronic microinflammation in
  the context of hemodialysis.'
