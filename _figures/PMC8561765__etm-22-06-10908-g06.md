caption: Molecular mechanism of TPs protection against H2O2-induced RAW264.7 cell
  injury. The excessive production of ROS in H2O2-injured RAW264.7 cells is alleviated
  and the balance of the oxidoreductase system is maintained by TPs. The expression
  of Nrf2 is directly affected by the change of intracellular ROS levels, following
  the Mst/Nrf2 axis maintenance of cellular redox balance and via Nrf2 binding to
  the ARE in the nucleus and thereby activating HO-1 protein expression. Induction
  via the Mst/Nrf2 axis and the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway appears to represent the antioxidant
  mechanism of TPs. TPs, tea polyphenols; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Nrf2, nuclear
