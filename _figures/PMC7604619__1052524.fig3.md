caption: Kinase pathways deregulated in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (ALL). The diverse signaling alterations observed in Ph-like ALL are grouped
  into JAK-STAT activating lesions (most commonly CRLF2 rearrangement, but also JAK
  mutation and rearrangement, IL7R mutation, truncating rearrangements of EPOR, and
  SH2B3 deletion/mutation), rearrangements involving ABL-class tyrosine kinases; rearrangements
  of genes encoding other kinases (FGFR1, NTRK3, FLT3), and Ras pathway mutations.
  Ras pathway mutations are not restricted to Ph-like ALL and are observed in other
  subtypes of leukemia (e.g., hyperdiploid ALL, PAX5 P80R ALL). They are also observed
  as co-mutations in a proportion of cases with CRLF2 rearrangements. These alterations
  typically activate the logical downstream signaling pathway, as well as other pathways
  that serve as additional avenues for therapeutic intervention (e.g., PI3K, BCL2).
