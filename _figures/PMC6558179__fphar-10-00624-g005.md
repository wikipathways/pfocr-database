caption: The underlying mechanism of SSa on T cell-mediated immune surveillance in
  breast cancer. (1) The naive CD4+ T cells differentiate into Th1 or Th2 under IL-12
  or IL-4 stimulation, respectively. Th1 produces IFN-γ and IL-12, which exerts anti-breast
  cancer activity. Th2 produces IL-4 and IL-10, which exerts promoting breast cancer
  activity. (2) The Th1 differentiation is induced by activation of the IL-12/STAT4
  signaling pathway. The IL-12 binds to IL-12R in the membrane of T cells, inducing
  tyrosine phosphorylation of janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2),
  which in turn phosphorylate IL-12R, providing docking sites for the transcription
  factor signal transducers and activators of transcription 4 (STAT4). Receptor-bound
  STAT4 is phosphorylated, which will then dimerize with another STAT4 molecule. STAT4
  homodimers translocate to the nucleus and promote IFN-γ gene transcription. (3)
  SSa increased Th1 released IL-12 and IFN-γ levels, decreased Th2 released IL-4 and
  IL-10 levels, and promoted Th1/Th2 shifting into Th1 immune response. Furthermore,
  SSa could upregulate IL-12, IL-12R, and STAT4 expression, activate the IL-12/STAT4
  pathway to induce Th1 differentiation, and enhance T cell-mediated immune surveillance
  of breast cancer.
