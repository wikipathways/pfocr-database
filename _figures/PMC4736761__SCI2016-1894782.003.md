caption: Cellular processes common to all nine cancer stem cell- (CSC-) associated
  genes. Pathway Studio was used to identify known relationships and cellular processes
  that are common between the CSC-associated genes. The ⨁ symbol on the arrow represents
  positive regulation of the process whilst a – through the arrow represents negative
  regulation.
