caption: N-linked glycans, assembled by Alg gene protein products (), are transferred
  via the OST complex to proteins translocated into the ER lumen (). Glucosidases
  I and II trim the first two glucoses (blue circles) from the glycan (), generating
  a monoglucosylated glycoform, which is a substrate for calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin
  (CRT) (). Trimming of the remaining glucose by glucosidase II releases the substrate
  from CNX/CRT (). Glycoproteins that do not reach their native folded state can be
  reglucosylated by UGGT1 (), redirecting them to CNX/CRT binding () or trimming by
  glucosidase II (). Glycoproteins that have reached their native state (star) ()
  are trimmed by mannosidases and directed for trafficking out of the ER (). Proteins
  that are terminally misfolded are trimmed by mannosidases and directed for ERAD
  ().
