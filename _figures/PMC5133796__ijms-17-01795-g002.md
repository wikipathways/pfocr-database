caption: 'miRNA methods of translational repression. (a) mRNA is effectively translated
  when it possesses a 5′-cap and 3′-poly(A) tail. At the initiation of translation,
  PABP associates with eIF4G which interacts with the 5′-cap structure forming a circular
  mRNA protected from degradation; (b) In the cap-independent mechanism, IRES binds
  to EIF4G without the need of EIF4E. After miRNA-mRNA binding, translational repression
  is mediated by EIF4A on the 5′ UTR preventing the action of ribosomes; (c) During
  the 5′–3′ decay pathway, GW182 as part of RISC, interacts with PABP and recruits
  the CAF1-CCR4-NOT complex which deadenylates mRNA. After deadenylation, mRNA is
  decapped by DCP2 and finally degraded; (d) mRNA degradation associated to p-bodies
  occurs after binding of RISC containing the miRNA. mRNA is sequestered to cytoplasmic
  P-bodies, which are centres of mRNA degradation containing key proteins necessary
  for translational repression; (e) In the ribosome drop-off model, miRNA associated
  with Argonaute binds to the mRNA target and has a distanced effect on translating
  ribosomes at multiple sites causing the ribosomes to drop-off. eIF4: eukaryotic
  translation-initiation factor 4; PABP: cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein; IRES:
  internal ribosome entry site; DCP2: decapping enzyme 2.'
