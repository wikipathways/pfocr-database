caption: 'Network of TP53-regulated genes. Pathway Explorer was used to build a network
  of all transcriptional targets of TP53 from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IPA) that
  were differentially expressed after irradiation with 2.5 Gy. The nodes were colored
  by overlaying significant expression ratios from the data for 2.5 Gy (panel A) or
  0.1 Gy (panel B), with red indicating upregulation and green downregulation. The
  time after irradiation when a response was observed is indicated by the background
  shading of the figure (blue: 4 h, pink: 16 h, purple: both 4 and 16 h). Additional
  TP53 targets also responded to the higher dose at 24 h, but none of those genes
  responded significantly to the lower dose.'
