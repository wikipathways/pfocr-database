caption: 'Overview of the proteostasis network (PN). The human PN must ensure proteome
  stability across cellular compartments (not drawn to scale). Molecular chaperones
  of the HSP70 (blue spheres), HSP40/DNAJ (red spheres), and HSP90 (green spheres)
  families are found in all major cellular compartments and cooperate with cochaperones
  (gray spheres) to promote folding of nascent chains, assembly of protein complexes,
  refolding of misfolded clients (serrated red spheres), or degradation of terminally
  misfolded substrates by the proteasome. Small heat shock protein (sHSP) homo-oligomers
  bind misfolded proteins and maintain them in a folding-competent state for the HSP70
  machinery. If refolding is unsuccessful, cooperation with the nucleotide exchange
  factor Bcl2-associated athanogene 1 (BAG1) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase C terminus
  of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP) can direct substrates to the proteasome. The
  HSP60 family of chaperones is crucial for mitochondrial proteostasis (in conjunction
  with the “lid” cochaperone HSP10) and for folding of cytoskeletal components via
  the TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC). Certain chaperones and cochaperones perform specialized
  or compartment-specific functions (orange spheres). For example, in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and ER oxidoreductin 1 (ERO1)
  cooperate to promote disulfide bond formation, while calnexin (CANX) and calreticulin
  (CALR) perform calcium-dependent folding of substrates. Upon protein misfolding,
  specific stress response pathways such as the heat shock response (HSR) and unfolded
  protein responses of the ER (UPRER) and mitochondria (UPRmito) can boost chaperone
  levels. Occasionally, misfolded proteins can form aggregates that can be deleterious
  to cells. HSP110 cooperates with HSP70/HSP40 to act as a disaggregase. Alternatively,
  large aggregates can be degraded by the lysosome through autophagy. A modification
  of this pathway (mitophagy) can also be used to remove old or damaged mitochondria.
  Gray arrows indicate pathways that should occur only at low levels in healthy cells.
