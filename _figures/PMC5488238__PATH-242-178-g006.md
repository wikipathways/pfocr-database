caption: Model of BMP–Notch interaction in intestinal homeostasis and CRC disease
  subtypes. In intestinal homeostasis, the BMP and Notch pathways are partially segregated.
  In the stem/progenitor zone at the base of the crypt, Notch signalling regulates
  intestinal stem cells and promotes progenitor cell division. Specific co‐localization
  of BMP and Notch signalling in cells emerging from the transit‐amplifying zone inhibits
  cell proliferation and promotes differentiation. In canonical tumours, loss of canonical
  BMP pathway constituents downregulates BMP signalling, promoting cell proliferation.
  In mesenchymal tumours, impaired pathway segregation, loss of SMAD1 and retention
  of SMAD5 enhance BMP–Notch interaction. In this model, BMP and Notch pathways act
  synergistically via a γ‐secretase‐independent mechanism to promote an EMT phenotype,
  which we postulate is promoted by the mesenchymal tumour microenvironment.
