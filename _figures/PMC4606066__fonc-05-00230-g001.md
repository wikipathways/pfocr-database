caption: Expression and function of the insulin/IGF system in normal and colorectal
  cancer cells. (A) In normal tissue insulin, IGF-1 and IGF-2 bind with high (continuous
  line) or low (dashed line) affinity to their corresponding receptors and activate
  specific IRSs, which modulate several pathways involved in gene transcription, cell
  proliferation, and apoptosis. IGFBPs act as negative regulators that modulate both
  IGF-1 and IGF-2 functions. (B) In colorectal cancer high IR-A and IGF-1R expression
  (upward arrow) as well as IRS-1 and IRS-2 polymorphisms are involved in up-regulation
  of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Moreover, IGFPB3 down-regulation (downward arrow) as well
  as IGFBP2 overexpression (upward arrow) are involved in strengthening IGF-1 functions
  and in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways that contribute to alter
  gene transcription, cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.
