caption: The calcineurin pathway is activated upon antigenic stimulation of the CD3/TCR
  complex in combination with co-stimulatory signals. This in turn activates the signal
  molecules phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) causing
  an influx of calcium and the opening of calcium channels in the membrane to maintain
  intracellular calcium levels. Upon interaction between calcium and the small calcium-binding
  protein, calmodulin, the phosphatase calcineurin is activated, which dephosphorylates
  NFAT. There are 13 phosphorylation sites present on NFAT that are known to be dephosphorylated
  upon activation. Dephosphorylation causes the translocation of NFAT to the nucleus
  where it will initiate gene transcription through the interaction with other transcription
  factors, such as AP-1. The signaling pathway is regulated by other signaling pathways,
  such as the MAPK pathway (JNK) and NFκB pathway. Once in the nucleus, NFAT will
  act as transcription factor and regulates the production of cytokines and the amplification
  of the isoform NFATc1/A in a positive autoregulatory feedback loop. The intracellular
  signaling pathways can also be activated by using PMA/ionomycin as a stimulus, while
  calcineurin inhibitors, such as TAC, are known to inhibit the calcineurin pathway.
