caption: Crosstalk between host autophagy and viruses. a The autophagy pathway functions
  as an intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism by directly engulfing virions and/or
  viral components of HSV-1 or SIN for lysosomal degradation, an activity known as
  xenophagy. b Autophagy can participate in homeostatic regulation of innate immune
  signaling against VSV. The autophagic machinery transfers RNA replication intermediates
  of VSV from the cytosol to the endosomal compartment containing TLR7, promoting
  the production of type I IFNs in pDCs. However, the autophagy pathway and/or autophagy
  genes may suppress RLR signaling and the production of type I IFNs in MEFs and primary
  macrophages either by suppressing the activities of RIG-1 and IPS-1 in MEFs or by
  reducing the intracellular level of ROS associated with dysfunctional mitochondria
  in primary macrophages. c Autophagy also functions in antiviral adaptive immunity
  by facilitating the processing and presentation of viral antigens onto MHC molecules.
  Upon EBV or Influenza A virus infection, autophagosomes target antigens derived
  either from incoming virions or endogenously expressed viral proteins to MHC class
  II loading compartment (MIIC). Notably, nuclear membrane-derived, four-layered autophagosomes
  can target endogenous viral antigens for MHC class I presentation during HSV-1 infection.
  d On the flip side, some viruses subvert and, moreover, enhance the host autophagic
  machinery for replication and pathogenesis. Several herpesviruses have been shown
  to block induction, nucleation, or elongation of autophagic vesicles. Several RNA
  viruses such as poliovirus and CVB3, HIV-1, and HCV induce the formation of vesicles
  resembling autophagosomes to enhance viral replication or non-lytic egress. However,
  it is yet unclear whether these viruses lead to the accumulation of these autophagosome-like
  structures by blocking their fusion with lysosomes
