caption: Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. (A) Non-endosomal Pathway. SARS- CoV-2
  upon contact with host cell surface, spike protein (SP) projecting from the viral
  cell surface, first undergoes proteolytic cleavage by TMPRSS2 and exposes its receptor
  binding domain (RBD) and attaches to the ACE-2 receptor on host cell surface via
  SP. TMPRSS2 also cleaves ACE-2 along with ADAM17 because of which shedding of ACE-2
  ectodomain occurs which can still bind to virus. After its attachment, virus fuses
  with host cell and releases its genome. Viral RNA undergoes transcription, translation
  and form new viral particles, new viral particles then release from host cell. TMPRSS2
  inhibitors may inhibit TMPRSS and thereby exposure of RBD to ACE-2. (B) Endosomal
  Pathway. SARS-CoV-2 upon contact with host cell surface, signals the host cell and
  forms a vesicle enclosing virus–ACE-2 complex. Then endocytosis of virus-ACE-2 complex
  occurs, into the host cell cytoplasm followed by H+ influx into endosome. Decreased
  pH in endosome activates Cathepsin L, which cleaves SP of virus. Then virus fuses
  with endosomal membrane and releases its genome. Viral genome transcribes and translates
  into viral particles, viral particles fuse and release out of host cell. Cathepsin
  L inhibitors may inhibit Cathepsin L cleavage of viral SP.
