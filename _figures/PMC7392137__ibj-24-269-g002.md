caption: Two well-known non-canonical Wnt signalling pathways, including Wnt/Ca2+
  (right) and Wnt/PCP (left). There are results supporting that both pathways are
  dependent on heterotrimeric G-protein signaling[20,21]. While LRP5/6 appears to
  work specifically for canonical Wnt signaling (), the co-receptors for non-canonical
  Wnt pathways belong to the family of RTKs (ROR1/2 and RYK). The Wnt/Ca2+pathway
  functions through the G-proteins that activate certain isoforms of the enzyme, PLC.
  Activation of PLC converts the phospholipid, PIP2, to DAG and IP3, which are two
  very important cellular second messengers. DAG is a direct activator of PKC, a multifunctional
  protein kinase in the cell, involved in the regulation of several cellular processes.
  IP3, on the other hand, interacts with its receptors on endoplasmic reticulum and
  leads to the intracellular release of calcium. Calcium is a co-factor for the activity
  of many important cellular proteins, including PKC, CamKII (Ca²/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II), and Calcineurin. As a protein phosphatase, Calcineurin can activate
  some transcription factors, including NFAT and therefore take part in the regulation
  of transcription of some important cellular genes. The other non-canonical Wnt signaling
  indicated in the Figure is a critical pathway involved in determining PCP. Wnt/Frizzled-mediated
  activation of this pathway with the help of the co-receptors (ROR2/RYK) signals
  through Dvl and heterotrimeric G-proteins (not shown in the Figure) to activate
  small GTPases like RhoA and Rac1. Activation of these small GTPases at least has
  two biological outcomes, reorganization of cell cytoskeleton and transcriptional
  regulation of some very important cellular genes mediated by transcription factors
  like c-Jun and AP1, a heterodimer of c-Jun and c-Fos transcription factors. DAAM1,
  disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  ROCK, Rho-associated protein kinase; PCP, planar cell polarity; PLC, phospholipase
  C; DAG, diacyl glycerol; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  4, 5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
