caption: Seed development regulation and rice quality control under HT. (A) Increasing
  the efficiency of Wxb pre-mRNA processing is an important regulatory mechanism for
  maintaining AC stability at HT. HAC8a and OsMADS7 might be important regulators
  involved in this pathway. (B) α-amylases is in charge of chalky appearance under
  HT and OsbZIP58 seems be a key gene negatively regulating α-amylases expression.
  FLO2 and FLO11/HSP70 are essential genes for chalkiness production under HT. (C)
  PRC2-MADS pathway might be essential for the regulation of rice seed development
  at HT conditions. OsFIE1 might affect seed development through OsMADS87, OsMADS89,
  etc.
