caption: Overview of the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway. (a) In the non-inductive
  phase of JA signaling or in the absence of jasmonates (JAs), JAZ proteins form a
  complex with the co-repressor TPL and TPR proteins []. The association between JAZs
  and TPL–TPR co-repressors is mediated by the NINJA adaptor protein []. The JAZNINJA–TPL–TPR
  repressor complex then binds to the transcription factors (TFs, such as MYCs, EIN3,
  and EIL1) and prevents the induction of JA signaling (i). JAZ proteins also recruit
  the transcriptional co-repressor HDA6 protein, which deacetylates histones (especially
  H4) and inhibits EIN3 and EIL1 to bind to the target gene promoters, leading to
  the subsequent repression of JA-responsive gene transcription [,] (ii). (b) When
  a sufficient level of JA-Ile is present in the cells (induction phase), JA-Ile enters
  into the nucleus through JAT1 membrane transporter [] and binds to COI1 and JAZNINJA–TPL–TPR
  repressor complex, leading to the COI1-mediated polyubiquitination of JAZ. The polyubiquitination
  tags JAZ proteins for 26S proteasome-mediated breakdown, thereby releasing the TFs
  and JA-signaling repressors from the complex. Inositol pentakisphosphate (InsP5),
  a co-receptor for JA-Ile, stabilizes the association of COI1–JAZ complex []. Depending
  upon the nature of infecting pathogens, the JA signaling operates through either
  (i) MYC or (ii) ERF TFs. The regulation of JA signaling in the MYC2 branch involves
  the association of HAC1 with MYC2 and MED25 proteins and binding of various MYC
  TFs []. This activator complex then induces the transcription of the downstream
  JA-responsive gene (e.g., VSP2) (i). The regulation of JA signaling through the
  ERF branch is mediated by ethylene (ET), EIN3, and EIL1. EIN3 and EIL1 TFs induce
  the transcription of ERF1 and ORA59. ERF1 and ORA59 TFs, in turn, recruit MED25
  to the GCC-box motif in the target gene promoters, leading to the activation of
  JA-responsive genes (e.g., PDF1.2) [] (ii). Double-headed bars show mutual repression,
  while dotted arrows indicate the release of TFs from the repressor complex. L-arrows
  and L-bars indicate induction and repression of gene transcription, respectively.
