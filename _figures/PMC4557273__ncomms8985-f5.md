caption: (a) Signalling pathway underlying chemotaxis of A. punctulata sperm. The
  balance of synthesis by the chemoreceptor guanylyl cyclase (GC) and hydrolysis by
  PDE determines intracellular cGMP concentration. cGMP levels set the membrane potential
  of the cell via a cyclic nucleotide-gated K+-selective channel (CNGK). When sperm
  hyperpolarize, intracellular alkalization via a Na+/H+ exchanger (sNHE) and depolarization
  via hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels prime
  the sperm-specific Ca2+ channel (CatSper) to open. When cGMP synthesis ceases, the
  cell quickly depolarizes, more CatSper channels open and a strong steering ‘off
  response' takes place. (b) Relative changes in [Ca2+]i (ΔF/F0; top) and relative
  changes in membrane potential Vm detected with a ratiometric dye (ΔR; bottom) of
  sperm suspensions on release cGMP by light pulses of 180, 500 or 1,000 ms duration.
  Release of cGMP results in a rapid hyperpolarization and depolarization of sperm
  followed by a rise in [Ca2+]i (‘on response'). When photolysis ceases, a second
  Ca2+ signal takes place (‘off response').
