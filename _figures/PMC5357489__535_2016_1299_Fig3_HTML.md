caption: Cross talk of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway with the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways in hepatitis C virus
  (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV promotes Wnt signaling as well as the
  EGFR and FGF pathways. The the Wnt/β-catenin and EGFR pathways activate each other.
  Binding of Wnt ligands with frizzled (FZD) receptors transactivates EGFR signaling
  by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated release of soluble EGFR ligands. EGFR
  signaling transactivates Wnt/β-catenin signaling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/Akt and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase (Erk) pathways but also by releasing β-catenin from β-catenin–E-cadherin
  complexes as a result of Tyr654 phosphorylation. Activated β-catenin forms heterodimers
  with EGFR and in turn promotes the EGFR pathway. On the other hand, Wnt signaling
  stimulates FGF signaling by inducing FGF18 and FGF20 ligand expression. In turn,
  the association of FGF19 with FGFR leads to the release of β-catenin from the β-catenin–E-cadherin
  complexes. FGF2 signaling inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity
  through the PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk pathways. Activated Src homology region
  2 domain containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) in the PI3K/Akt pathway and the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk
  pathway dephosphorylates parafibromin, which acquires the ability to bind β-catenin
  stably, overriding the repression effect on CYCLIND1 and MYC expression and triggering
  downstream signaling
