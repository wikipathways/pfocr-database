caption: The molecular mechanism of ER stress response triggered by arrested axonal
  transport. a The complex APP:Fe65:kinesin-1, normally targeted to neurites, accumulates
  at the ER when transport is arrested. b Recruitment of active JNK kinase complex
  by kinesin-1 leads to phosphorylation of APP. c Phosphorylated APP is cleaved by
  the amyloidogenic pathway to release Aβ into the ER lumen, and Fe65 into the cytoplasm.
  Fe65 then translocates into the nucleus, forming a transcriptionally active complex
  with Tip60 that regulates expression of stress-related genes.
