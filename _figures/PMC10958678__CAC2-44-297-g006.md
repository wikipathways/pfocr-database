caption: Functional activities of mut‐p53 in cancers. (A) In general, p53 mutations
  lead to loss of DNA‐binding ability and impairment of the p53 response (loss of
  function, LOF). (B) A DNE of mut‐p53 over WT p53 occurs through the formation of
  hetero‐tetramers and supramolecular aggregates with WT p53 [18]. (C) Mut‐p53 GOF
  activities impact multiple hallmarks of cancer cells, affecting chromatin structure,
  transcriptional regulation, and miRNA biogenesis; shaping the proteome; and rewiring
  tumor cell metabolic pathways. The impacts also encompass cytoplasmic functions
  and cell‐extrinsic effects, namely, effects on the TME and the inflammatory response.
  Oncogenic GOF of mut‐p53, driving tumor development and dissemination, relies on
  direct interactions of mut‐p53 with transcription factors (TFs, dark boxes) or cofactors
  and other protein effectors (orange boxes), altering their enzyme activity to induce
  cell stemness (blue boxes), or on transcriptional modulation of target genes (light
  boxes). Data were retrieved from and based on [8, 62, 72]. LOF, loss of function;
  GOF, gain of function; DNE, dominant negative effect; TF, transcription factor;
  HIF‐1, hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1; mut‐p53, mutant p53; TME, tumor microenvironment;
  WT, wild‐type; miRNA, microRNA
