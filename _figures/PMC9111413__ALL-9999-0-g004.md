caption: Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and leukotriene antagonists in SARS‐CoV‐2
  infection. Increased levels of eicosanoids have been found in bronchoalveolar lavage
  fluid of patients with severe COVID‐19, with predominance of prostaglandins and
  thromboxane. There are strong grounds to explore eicosanoid inhibition as a potential
  therapeutic target in SARS‐CoV‐2 infections. Prostaglandins amplify innate immune
  responses to pathogen‐ and damage‐associated molecular patterns, enhance the cascade
  of proinflammatory cytokine release, activate Th1 and Th17 cells, and contribute
  to recruitment of macrophages and T cells. Moreover, studies in mouse adapted to
  SARS‐CoV‐2 infection showed that PGD2 inhibition protected from severe disease.
  Despite the initial mixed reports on the use of NSAIDs in COVID‐19, it has been
  concluded that these medications can be safely used to alleviate the symptoms of
  SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This effect is attributed to the disruption of inflammatory
  circuits. Other effects of NSAIDs in COVID‐19 are being investigated, and preliminary
  studies suggest that a non‐selective NSAID naproxen could negatively influence SARS‐CoV‐2
  replication. Furthermore, the efficacy of leukotriene antagonist montelukast is
  being evaluated in a series of clinical trials. The hypothesized mode of action
  in COVID‐19 includes inhibition of leukotriene signaling, as well as direct antiviral
  effect (damage to the viral lipid membrane and genome), as reported for other viruses
