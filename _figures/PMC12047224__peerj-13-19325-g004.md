caption: TRAF2, TRAF6, RIP, MALT1, and NEMO are all K63 polyubiquitinated in response
  to ligand interaction of certain membrane receptors. Through their interaction with
  TAB2 and TAB3, the polyubiquitin chains attract the TAK kinase complex. Activated
  TAK1 may phosphorylate and activate IKKβ, which in turn phosphorylates IκB bound
  to cytosolic NF-κB, causing its destruction by the proteasome and the βTrCP E3 ubiquitin
  ligase. The target genes are subsequently transactivated when free NF-κB moves to
  the nucleus. By removing K63 ubiquitinated chains from active TRAFs, RIP, and NEMO,
  deubiquitinating enzymes CYLD and A20 may prevent NF-κB activation. A20 may also
  stop NF-κB activation brought on by TNF-α by catalyzing the K48 ubiquitination of
  RIP, which results in its proteasomal destruction. The TNF receptor (TNFR1) not
  only encourages survival by activating NF-κB target genes, but it also increases
  antagonistic apoptotic pathways
