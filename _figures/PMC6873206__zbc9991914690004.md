caption: YAP regulation by focal adhesion signaling. Integrin engagement with extracellular
  matrix on stiff substrates triggers activation of focal adhesion signaling driven
  by FAK and SRC tyrosine kinases. FAK and SRC kinases modulate Hippo pathway and
  YAP activity in various ways. Both kinases function to activate YAP to promote cell
  proliferation on stiff substrates. FAK and SRC can directly phosphorylate YAP to
  promote its activity. In addition, FAK and SRK directly phosphorylate MOB1 and LATS1/2,
  respectively, to inhibit their activity. They also inhibit LATS1/2 less directly
  through several signaling pathways. Integrin signaling through a FAK-SRC-PI3K-PDK1
  pathway inhibits LATS1/2 activity, thereby enhancing YAP nuclear enrichment. FAK-dependent
  activation of a RAC-PAK signaling cascade also ensures inhibition of LATS1/2 activity
  by phosphorylating and inhibiting NF2. Another mechanism by which focal adhesions
  regulate Hippo signaling is by modulating PIP2 levels. On stiff substrates, active
  FAK induces PLC, which reduces PIP2. Reduction of PIP2 shuts down the signaling
  cascade that eventually leads to the activation of RAP2. RAP2 acts both to inhibit
  Rho, a known inhibitor of LATS1/2, and to activate LATS1/2 by activating MAP4K kinases.
  Thus, increasing substrate stiffness impedes RAP2 activation by inhibiting upstream
  PIP2, thereby promoting nuclear translocation and activation of YAP.
