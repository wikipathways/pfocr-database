caption: General schematic diagram of molecular events that regulate proliferation,
  differentiation and the initiation of migration in the SVZ. Progenitor populations
  in the SVZ and outer SVZ undergo proliferation, differentiation, polarization, which
  are controlled to achieve either neural population increases or migration. In both
  these populations, collections of cellular processes are regulated to shift balance
  between proliferation and differentiation. Cadherins cause cell-cell interactions
  through Wnt/Akt signaling, which result in altered levels of Pax6 or Sox1 expression.
  Cadherins increase expression of actin dynamic molecules and N-glycan. Resulting
  in axonal growth and migration, which involves incorporation of Tbr2, Nestin, and
  the SFK/Fyn/Cdk5 pathway. Cadherins influence the cell cycle through inhibition
  of the growth factor FGF and EphA4, which results in decreased proliferation and
  increased differentiation to allow migration. E2 is able to increase FGF/EphA4 action
  leading to greater proliferation. This action is achieved through E2 stimulating
  Pax6 through E-Cdk2. Polarization of migrating neurons in the SVZ can be accomplished
  by the coupling of Cdc42 to an aPKC/mPar6/mPar3 complex. SVZ, subventricular zone;
