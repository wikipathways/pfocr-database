caption: Scheme to illustrate the separate functions and regulation of conventional
  nonsarcomeric myosin IIA and myosin IIB. We propose separate pathways to regulate
  the distinctive functions of nonsarcomeric, conventional myosin isoforms, in particular
  with regard to the dynamic process of neurite extension. We have shown (this study)
  that myosin IIA is the motor involved in neurite retraction, a process that can
  be triggered by a number of effectors, including LPA (; Jalink et al., , ; ) and
  thrombin (; ; ). A direct pathway relating cause and effect is shown (LHS) and involves
  Rho activation, which, in turn, activates Rho-kinase (; ; ). When the myosin binding
  subunit (MBS) of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) is phosphorylated by activated
  Rho-kinase (; ), dephosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (RLC) of myosin
  is inhibited, allowing myosin IIA to maintain a level of activity determined by
  the level of phosphorylation at Ser19 on the RLC (). The activity of Rho-kinase
  is inhibited by Y27632 (; ), leading to activation of MLCP, dephosphorylation of
  myosin IIA and a decline in cross-bridge cycling, preventing retraction. Interestingly,
  in vitro studies have demonstrated that the heavy chain of myosin IIA can act as
  a substrate for protein kinase C () and metastasis-associated protein (Mts 1) ()
  so dual, or even triple, regulation at the level of the myosin molecule may also
  be possible. Myosin IIA is also known to be involved in focal contact and stress
  fiber formation (; ; ), processes that can be also be inhibited by Y27632 (). It
  is likely that there are other intermediates in the pathway shown as indicated by
  a requirement for two different tyrosine kinases ().We have shown previously that
  myosin IIB is involved in neurite outgrowth (), a process that can be initiated
  in many neuronal cells by nerve growth factor () or bradykinin () (although not
  required to stimulate outgrowth in the case of Neuro-2A cells). A proposed chain
  of command is shown (RHS) in which agonist binding activates Rac, leading ultimately
  to activation of a myosin heavy chain kinase (MHCK) (). Phosphorylation of the myosin
  heavy chain has been shown to correlate with cell spreading (). We propose that
  myosin IIB is also activated by MHCK in Neuro-2A cells, leading to neurite outgrowth.
  Casein kinase II and protein kinase C have been implicated as possible candidates
  for MHCK by in vitro experiments (). PAK-kinase may also be involved (; ) and has
  been demonstrated to phosphorylate the RLC () in vitro. Once again, the results
  suggest that some form of dual regulation at the level of the myosin molecule may
  occur. Putative cross talk between the pathways has not been included in the interest
  of clarity but may involve reciprocal actions of cAMP (), PAK (), and further actions
  of the small GTPase protein family (; ; ; ).
