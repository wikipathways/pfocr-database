caption: The mechanism of ΔCD2v/ΔMGF360-505R-ASFV inhibits apoptosis after infecting
  PAMs cells. After infection with PAMs, GZ201801-ASFV promotes the release of IL-1β
  to induce cell apoptosis. After ΔCD2v/ΔMGF360-505R-ASFV infection with PAMs, the
  activation of NF-κB pathway and IL-1β are significantly lower than GZ201801-ASFV.
  Therefore, the percentage of apoptosis induced by ΔCD2v/ΔMGF360-505R-ASFV infecting
  PAMs was significantly lower than in GZ201801-ASFV.
