caption: (A) Engineered chondrocytes generate an anti-inflammatory response in arthritis.
  Localized joint inflammation and the release of TNFα are among the main drivers
  for the development of arthritis. Chondrocytes are engineered to express TNFαR,
  and its signaling is routed via the NF-κB pathway to a chimeric promoter that induces
  expression of an inactive soluble TNFαR. This competes with active TNFαR for TNFα
  binding, thereby counteracting the inflammation in a closed control loop. (B) AND
  gate logic-based closed-loop cellular treatment for psoriatic skin patches based
  on the TNFα and IL22 cytokines. Increased TNFα concentration in the blood induces
  the expression of the IL22RA receptor subunit in engineered cells. This enables
  the sensing of IL22, which, together with TNFα, is a signature cytokine in psoriasis.
  Upon activation of this receptor the induced STAT3 signaling is rerouted to a chimeric
  STAT3 promoter for the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 and IL10,
  which suppress psoriatic flares. (C) Closed-loop cellular therapeutic circuit to
  counteract increased blood concentration of urate associated with gout. A fusion
  protein of the HucR urate-sensitive repressor from D. radiodurans with the KRAB
  inhibitory domain is bound to the HucR operator after an SV40 promoter and represses
  transcription under normal conditions. In the presence of inducing urate concentrations,
  the repressor is released from the DNA and A. flavus urate oxidase is produced and
  secreted, effectively reducing the urate concentration, which leads to repression
  of the promoter. (D) Closed-loop anti-allergic response by engineered mammalian
  cells. The presence of allergy-associated cytokines such as IL4 and IL13 can be
  sensed through the type II IL4R, which in turn activates the STAT6 signal transduction
  cascade. A minimal promoter operated by STAT6 induces expression of IgE targeting
  DARPin E2_79 to prevent further degranulation of immune cells and escalation of
  the allergic response. (E) Targeting of senescence phenotypes. Sensing of senescence-associated
  cytokines such as IL6 is enabled in engineered cells expressing a fusion receptor
  consisting of the IL6 extracellular domain and the VEGFR2 intracellular signaling
  domain. Upon activation, the receptor triggers calcium signaling and enables cellular
  migration towards the senescent cells through a modified calcium-sensitive RhoA
  for cytoskeletal remodeling. (F) A fever-inducible response is enabled through a
  genetically encoded thermometer to deliver closed-loop cellular therapies. The temperature-sensing
  transcription factor consists of tTA transactivator DNA-binding domain fused to
  an TlpA coiled-coil temperature sensor domain, which progressively unfolds at temperatures
  higher than 37° and enables transcription from a TetR-operated promoter.
