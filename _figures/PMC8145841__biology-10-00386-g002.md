caption: 'Evolutionary schema showing a possible scenario leading to the appearance
  of mitochondrial PBGD in phototrophic eukaryotes. A pre-eukaryotic cell (A) engulfed
  (or was invaded by) an α-proteobacterium (B). Two complete redundant heme biosynthesis
  pathways were present in an early eukaryotic cell after acquiring the ancestor of
  mitochondria (C). The origins of genes in a pre-eukaryotic cell are unclear. However,
  they are not of archaeal origins, and they rather came from various bacteria through
  LGT. The heme pathway became redundant after the endosymbiotic event, and both the
  host and endosymbiont pathways were reduced. In heterotrophic eukaryotes, the first
  step of the route (synthesis of ALA) is mitochondrial. The next four steps are located
  in the cytosol, and the path is terminated in the mitochondrion again. In the time
  of primary plastid endosymbiosis, the α-proteobacterial pathway was not fully reduced
  yet, and the mitochondrial PBGD was still present in the cell (D). When a heterotrophic
  eukaryote engulfed a cyanobacterium (E), the mitochondrially-cytosolic pathway was
  gradually lost, except for PBGD, which replaced the cyanobacterial homolog in the
  plastid (F). As a result of past endosymbiotic events, photosynthetic eukaryotes
  possess the plastid localized heme biosynthesis pathway composed of enzymes of various
  origins (G). All the genes in question were nuclear-encoded and posttranslationally
  to the place of action. Abbreviations of enzymes: GTR: glutamyl-tRNA reductase,
