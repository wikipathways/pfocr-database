caption: 'Biofilm life cycle and HGT. The typical life cycle of biofilms includes
  attachment to surfaces, microcolony formation, maturation and detachment. MGE-encoded
  factors and MVs enhance attachment and cell aggregation at the early stages of biofilm
  formation. Degradation of the biofilm matrix by phages facilitates cell detachment.
  ARGs can be distributed via three classical mechanisms: conjugation, natural transformation
  and phage transduction (and ASEN), and two candidates for new HGT mechanisms: MVs
  and nanotube (denoted as new candidate) in biofilms. Examples of ARGs transferred
  through each pathway are shown with the respective references. DNA is depicted by
  red lines and circles.'
