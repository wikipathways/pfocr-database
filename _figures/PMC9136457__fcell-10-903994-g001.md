caption: Nuclear phosphoinositide metabolism and involved enzymes with implications
  in DNA damage response and/or tumor suppression. Representative proteins/isoforms
  are shown as full length structures predicted by AlphaFold. Studies indicate that
  PIPKIα, PIPKIIβ, and PTEN might exist as dimers. Whether dimerization is required
  for their kinase activities and in response to DNA damage requires further investigation
  (; ; ). Red dotted circle labels the catalytic site of each protein. The letters
  in the parentheses under each enzyme correspond to the pathways indicated in the
  center panel. Letters in gray represent a minor pathway. Note that PI(3,5)P2 is
  not detected in nucleus.
