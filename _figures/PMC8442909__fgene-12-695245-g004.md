caption: Regulatory network analysis to predict miRNAs and TFs associated with ovarian
  cancer. (A) PPI network construction to analyze DEGs in shNTPCR ovarian cancer groups.
  The red node represent upregulated genes, while the green dot refer to downregulated
  genes. The node with blue aperture indicates genes related to ovarian carcinoma.
  (B) Two clusters of functional modules were identified from the PPI network. (C)
  Functional enrichment analysis results for DEGs in subnetwork modules, and the top
  10 pathway categories were sorted according to the p-value. (D) Regulatory network
  of miRNA–TF–gene was constructed to predict crucial genes correlated with ovarian
  cancer progression. Dots in red and green color represent upregulated and downregulated
  genes, respectively; triangular nodes and V-shaped nodes represent miRNA and TFs.
