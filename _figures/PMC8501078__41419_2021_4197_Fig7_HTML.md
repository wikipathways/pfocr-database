caption: The induction of CKD, caused by reduced renal mass, increased angiotensin
  II and aldosterone, and increased salt consumption, triggers endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This amplifies
  TDAG51 expression in the kidney. The elevated levels of TDAG51 triggers a pro-apoptotic
  signaling pathway and a pro-fibrotic signaling pathway. In the pro-apoptotic pathway,
  TDAG51 induces expression of CHOP, which activates pro-apoptotic genes and, eventually,
  programmed cell death. In the pro-fibrotic pathway, TDAG51 increases expression
  of TGF-β receptor 1, which leads to the splicing of XBP1. Spliced XBP1 leads to
  the activation of pro-fibrotic genes, and the development of renal interstitial
  fibrosis.
