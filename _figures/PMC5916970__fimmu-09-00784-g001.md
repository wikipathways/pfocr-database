caption: When mTNF/TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) is activated, the intracellular domains
  recruit existing cytoplasmic TNF receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF-2)–cIAP-1–cIAP-2
  complexes resulting in the initiation of both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB/Rel
  and MAPK pathways activation. NF-κB/Rel and MAPK pathways activate IL-2 promoter
  and trigger IL-2 expression. NF-κB pathways also transcript genes associated with
  cell survival and cell proliferation. So, mTNF/TNFR2 signaling can enhance expansion
  and stability of Tregs and increase Treg sensitivity to low level of IL-2. It also
  activates the reciprocal PI3K/Akt pathway. Activation of Akt signaling impairs Th17
  differentiation, correlated with an increased phosphorylation of STAT5 (). When
  soluble TNFα (sTNFα)/TNFR1 is activated, the intracellular domains interact with
  TRADD, which receptor interacting protein-1 (RIP-1) and TRAF-2 to form Signal complex
  I, then further triggering extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38, and
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The mechanisms of TNFR1 on Th17 differentiation are
  still unclear. These transcription factors might phosphorylate STAT3, upregulate
  the level of ROR-γt, and increase IL-17 production.
