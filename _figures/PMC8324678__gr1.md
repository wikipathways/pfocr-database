caption: Overview of pathways involved in TAG/LD formation and breakdown. ER-localized
  enzymes catalyze the synthesis of TAG for incorporation into de novo LDs. LDs may
  also grow through local synthesis of TAG and phospholipids on the LD surface, lipid
  exchange with the ER, or through CIDE protein-mediated fusion of two LDs. Ces1d
  directs LDs from the ER to the VLDL synthetic pathway. CMA-mediated degradation
  of PLIN2 is an initial event in the breakdown of LDs. Subsequently, ATGL has access
  to the LD surface and can bind its co-activator CGI-58 to initiate TAG hydrolysis.
  Lipophagy, which is initiated by numerous RAB proteins, is thought to be responsible
  for the hydrolysis of size-reduced LDs. Upon lysosomal degradation, FAs are largely
  effluxed at the plasma membrane. Solid arrows represent metabolite flux and dashed
  arrows represent signaling.
