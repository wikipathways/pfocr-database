caption: '(a). In the canonical Notch signaling pathway, ligand from cell #1 induces
  cleavage and RBPj dependent signal in cell #2. However, Ligand Back Signaling can
  occur concomitantly in cell #1 (black circle). RBPj-dependent activity, and γ-secretase
  dependent, RBPj-independent NICD signals (black circle) are also potentially functioning
  in cell #2. (b). Diagram of Notch1wt, N1CreERT and N1VG receptors. (c). N1CreERT
  receptor is activated by ligands, and thus can trigger LBS. X-gal staining of 4-OHT
  tamoxifen-injected N1CreERT Rosa26R/Rosa26R skin. Bars, 100 μm.'
