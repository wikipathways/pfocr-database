caption: Compared with normal cells (left), the flux of glucose metabolism and glycolysis
  is accelerated in cancer cells (right) by preferential expression of transporters
  and enzyme isoforms that drive glucose flux forward and to adapt to the anabolic
  demands of cancer cells. Enzymes that catalyse the metabolic reactions are shown
  in ovals. Enzymes that are predominant in cancer cells are shown in bold. The thickness
  of the arrows indicates relative flux. 1,3BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate;
