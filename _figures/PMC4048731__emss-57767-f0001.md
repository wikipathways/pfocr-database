caption: 'Relative abundance of different isotopologs of aspartate in procyclic form
  Trypanosoma brucei growing on (A) unlabeled 12C-glucose medium and (B) a 50:50 mix
  of labeled U-13C-glucose and unlabeled U-12C-glucose medium at steady state [].
  Isotopologs elute at the same retention time, but their masses differ by the difference
  in the mass of heavy and light carbon (1.00335 Da). Red circles show the number
  of labeled carbons that each isotope contains. Chromatograms show unlabeled (black),
  one (red; natural isotope abundance), two (green), three (blue) and four (purple)
  carbon-labeled isotopologs. These aspartate isotopologs are synthesized from the
  respective oxaloacetate (OXAC) isotopologs by transamination, and demonstrate active
  glycolysis and succinate fermentation pathways: the predominant three carbon labeled
  OXAC derives from phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity on three-labeled
  (glycolysis-derived) phosphoenolpyruvate and unlabeled (atmospheric) CO2. The two
  carbon-labeled isotopolog commonly indicates formation of two-labeled OXAC from
  the TCA cycle; however, TCA cycle activity is minimal in T. brucei, and in this
  case, two-labeled OXAC is derived from a reversible succinate fermentation pathway
  where the symmetrical structure of fumarate allows labeled carboxylic acid groups
  of dicarboxylic acid intermediates to be replaced by unlabeled (atmospheric) CO2
  through the reversible activity of PEPCK []. The low-abundance four carbon-labeled
  isotopolog derives from addition of labeled CO2 to three-labeled phosphoenolpyruvate
  by PEPCK. The labeled CO2 is generated biosynthetically from glucose by either the
  pentose phosphate pathway or by PEPCK in the reversible succinate pathway. Please
