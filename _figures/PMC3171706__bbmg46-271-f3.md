caption: G2/M transition and G2/M checkpoint induction. Entry into mitosis is triggered
  by an active CyclinB1/Cdk1 complex. The activity of the CyclinB1/Cdk1 complex is
  tightly regulated by opposing feedback loops (indicated in green)—one involving
  the kinases, Myt1 and Wee1, and the other the phosphatase Cdc25, the first phosphorylating
  and inhibiting CyclinB1/Cdk1 and the latter removing these phosphorylations. Plk1
  is involved in both feedback loops. After DNA damage induction, two ATM-dependent
  checkpoint pathways are activated (indicated in blue). The checkpoint kinases, Chk1/Chk2,
  target Cdc25 for nuclear export leading to the accumulation of the inactive CyclinB1/Cdk1
  complex. Further inhibition of CyclinB1/Cdk1 takes place through a slowly activated
  p53-dependent pathway. The lack of activated CyclinB1/Cdk1 interrupts the feedback
  loops (dotted lines), resulting in G2 arrest. (See colour version of this figure
