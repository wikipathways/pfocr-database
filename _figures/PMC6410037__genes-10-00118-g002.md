caption: Telomere length maintenance mechanisms. (A) A simplified view of telomere
  length control by telomerase and the CST-complex. Telomerase adds telomeric repeats
  to the 3’-end of the G-rich overhang. Its activity is controlled by the CST-complex,
  which displaces telomerase, removes secondary structures and recruits the DNA polymerase
  α/primase complex to synthesize the C-rich strand. Note that regulation of telomerase
  by the CST-complex is more complex in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (see text for
  details). (B) A general representation of the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres
  (ALT) mechanism. ALT is currently viewed as the BIR-dependent elongation of telomeres
  after the replication fork stalling, ultimately leading to the formation of a one-ended
  double-strand break. This fork stalling can be due to the formation of unusual secondary
  structures in telomeric DNA (such as G-quadruplexes), the presence of stable DNA-RNA
  structures (R-loops generated during transcription of telomere-specific RNA called
  TERRA) or potent protein barriers (a circle with question mark). The replicative
  helicase is pictured as a red ring, RNA polymerase is a yellow oval and DNA polymerases
  are green and blue torpedoes with rings on their rear ends representing PCNA. One-ended
  DSBs are then channeled into the RAD52-dependent DNA damage repair pathway. This
  pathway is either RAD51-dependent, which involves invasion into a homologous or
  homeologous duplex, or RAD51-independent, which involves single-strand annealing.
  (These two pathways lead to the formation of Type I and Type II survivors in telomerase-deficient
  S. cerevisiae, respectively.) Upon template switching, the replisome is assembled
  and BIR-dependent synthesis of the telomere proceeds. BIR at telomeres requires
  DNA polymerase δ, its accessory subunit POLD3 (Pol32 in S. cerevisiae) as well as
  Replication Factor C (RFC) and PCNA (see text for details). The source of templates
  for RAD51-independent annealing is not limited to single-stranded regions released
  after G-quadruplex formation in the complimentary strand. For a comprehensive review
  of all eligible substrates see []. Importantly, such templates may be represented
  by extrachromosomal telomeric circular DNAs believed to be generated from the resolution
  of recombination intermediates at telomeres. Other sources for template DNA during
  BIR-dependent telomere-lengthening could be T-loops or interstitial telomeric sequences
  (ITSs) (for further discussion of these issues see ).
