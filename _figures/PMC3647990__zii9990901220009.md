caption: Model for Rrp1 regulation of chitobiose metabolism in B. burgdorferi. During
  the feeding process, certain host factors or chitobiose or both serve as a ligand(s)
  to activate the histidine kinase, Hk1, leading to phosphorylation of the response
  regulator, Rrp1. Phosphorylated Rrp1 activates BosR (the oxidative stress regulator)
  and RpoN, which then activate the transcription of rpoS. The expression of RpoS
  is further enhanced via the signaling by Rrp2-RpoN as well as other regulators such
  as DsrABb. An increase in the level of RpoS leads to repression of glycerol metabolism
  genes and activation of the components of the chitobiose metabolic pathway, especially
  the chitobiose transporter gene, chbC. Expression of the chitobiose utilization
  pathway allows B. burgdorferi to utilize chitobiose shed from the peritrophic membrane
  which is formed after a blood meal as a source for GlcNAc, a precursor for cell
  wall synthesis. A switch from glycerol to chitobiose for utilization as the main
  carbon source allows the spirochete to multiply in numbers and completes the transmission
  cycle.
