caption: 'Pexidartinib mechanism of actiona. The proliferation and survival of cancer
  cells and macrophages are regulated by colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). Pexidartinib
  is a selective CSF-1R inhibitor that stimulates the auto-inhibited state of CSF-1R
  by interacting with the juxtamembrane region of CSF-1R, responsible for folding
  and inactivating the kinase domain, and prevents the binding of CSF-1 and ATP to
  the region. Without the binding of CSF-1 to the receptor, CSF1-R cannot undergo
  ligand-induced auto-phosphorylation. Thus, inhibiting the CSF-1/CSF-1R pathway,
  resulting in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and other cells populations
  such as macrophages. Pexidartinib has also been shown to inhibit cKIT, FMS-like
  tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-β,
  all receptor tyrosine kinases that regulate cellular processes such as cell proliferation
  and survival. This illustration was created with BioRender.com. aData from Plexxikon
