caption: Cellular fates of NAD+. NAD+ has numerous fates in the cell; clockwise from
  top. () Numerous metabolic enzymes use NAD+ as redox cofactor, with the reduced
  form (NADH) being a cellular “reducing equivalent” used to drive biosynthetic and
  other reactions. () mARTs and PARPs catalyze the adduction of ADP-ribosyl groups
  onto proteins, either singly or in linear or branched chains. This is an important
  protein post-translational modification that regulates protein function. () NAD+
  can be phosphorylated to make NADP+, which is used as a redox cofactor like NAD+.
  Its reduced form (NADPH) is used to drive many antioxidant enzymes important for
  defense against oxidative stress. () Cell surface CD73 and mitochondrial nudix hydrolase
  13 (NUDT13) enzymes have the pyrophosphohydrolase activity, converting NAD+ to NMN.
  CD73 further converts NMN into NR and plays an important role in cellular uptake
  of NAD+ and NMN. () CD38/CD57/SARM1 enzymes can perform either (i) a cyclase activity
  that generates NAM and cyclic ADPR (cADPR), the latter being an important cell signaling
  second messenger, or (ii) a hydrolase activity that generates NAM and ADPR. CD hydrolase
  is considered an NAD+ degradation pathway. () The SIRT family of lysine deacylases
  use NAD+ as a substrate, generating NAM while removing an acyl group (e.g., acetyl,
  succinyl, malonyl) from a protein lysine residue to form 2′-O-acyl-ADPR. ADPR, adenosine
  diphosphate ribose; mARTs, mono-ADPR transferases.
