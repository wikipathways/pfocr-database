caption: Signaling pathways regulating pyroptosis in breast cancer. (Mechanisms involving
  only mouse cells were drawn in blue indicator lines while human cells were drawn
  in red indicator lines, and mechanisms involving both mouse cells and human cells
  were drawn in black indicator lines.) Caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis is induced
  through activating molecules including Bax, AIM2, caspase-4, caspase-9, DRD2, and
  UCP1 and AMPK/SIRT1/NF-κB/Bax axis and STAT3/ROS/JNK axis involved in the process.
  Besides it, the suppression of TGF-β signaling via MDA5- and RIG-I- also trigger
  caspase-3/GSDME dependent pyroptosis. MEG3/NLRP3, miR-200b/JAZF1, JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  pathway, and NF-κB participate in the caspase-1/GSDMD-pyroptosis.PD-L1 under hypoxia
  switches TNFα-derived-apoptosis to noncanonical pyroptosis triggered by caspase-8
  and is dependent on GSDMC.
