caption: Schematic representation of the flux through the B1 biosynthesis pathway
  in endosperm of WT and engineered rice. A simplified vitamin B1 pathway, with the
  three major enzymes responsible for its biosynthesis, utilized in the metabolic
  engineering approaches, is depicted. Engineered enzymes are depicted in a larger
  font and are accompanied by an arrow pointing up. Similarly, relevant intermediates
  are displayed in the colour corresponding to the branch they are part of (pyrimidine,
  blue; thiazole, orange; B1 vitamers, green). Arrows next to the metabolites indicate
  an increase (full arrow up), decrease (full arrow down) or other potential outcomes
  (hollow arrows) as a result of the engineering strategy. The distribution of thiamin
  in seeds is shown in green, intensified in engineered lines. Higher HET(‐P) levels
  in TT lines is depicted by a more intense orange colouring of the endosperm. Flux
  through the thiamin biosynthesis pathway in WT (a), THIC‐engineered (b), TT‐engineered
  (c), and TTT‐engineered (d) lines.
