caption: A schematic diagram of the IP3 cytoplasmic Ca2+ branch of the PLC-mediated
  GqPCR signaling pathway studied in Dickson et al. (2013) (modified from Fig. 5 A
  in Falkenburger et al., 2013). Elements highlighted in green were monitored in experiments
  described in Dickson et al. (2013), and those in gray are not directly described
  in Dickson et al. (2013).
