caption: A proposed model for AITC-mediated mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. AITC-induced
  cell death in which ROCK1 activation represents the primary insult, leading in turn
  to PTEN activation and PI3K inactivation, resulting in PP1 and PP2A activation,
  and dephosphorylation of cofilin, which binds to G-actin and translocates to mitochondria,
  and culminating in cytochrome c release, caspases activation and apoptosis.
papertitle: Mitochondrial translocation of cofilin is required for allyl isothiocyanate-mediated
  cell death via ROCK1/PTEN/PI3K signaling pathway.
