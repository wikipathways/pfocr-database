caption: Phytohormone-mediated salt stress responses. ABA, one of the most important
  stress response hormones, plays a crucial role in salt stress tolerance. ABA-activated
  SnRK2s regulate stomatal closure, osmotic homeostasis, and gene expression. Salt
  stress negatively regulates the accumulation of bioactive GAs, and the reduced GAs
  levels or inactivated GAs promote plant salt tolerance following germination. JA
  levels increase and JA signaling is activated by high salinity stress. JA is required
  for the inhibition of primary root growth, which may be an adaptive strategy for
  survival under salt stress. BR, a growth-promoting phytohormone, accumulates upon
  salt stress to positively regulate plant salt tolerance. BR induces the formation
  of the BRI1-BAK1 heterodimer, which then initiates the phosphorylation relay cascades
  among BSKs, BSU1, and BIN2, ultimately remodeling gene expression via the regulation
  of BZR1 and BES1. Ethylene also accumulates under salt stress in plants. The components
  involved in ethylene homeostasis or the ethylene signaling pathway play either positive
  or negative roles in salt stress responses. ABA, abscisic acid; GA, gibberellin;
  JA, jasmonic acid; BR, brassinosteroid; ETH, ethylene.
