caption: One major role of the phenotypic plasticity of abdominal pigmentation is
  played by Abdominal-B (Abd-B). Abd-B represses ebony (e) and tyrosine hydroxylase
  (TH), not necessarily directly. The first role is stronger at low temperature and
  the second role is stronger at high temperature. This correlates with the increase
  in melanin production at low temperature and the decrease of all pigments at high
  temperature in the posterior abdomen. Abd-B is known to increase pigmentation in
  A5 and A6 by repressing bab []. Hsp90, BAB, and chromatin regulators, such as Corto
  and Cramped (CRM), are particularly limiting at intermediate and high temperature
  for the expression of TH. Thus, at high temperature they do not counteract as strongly
  as at low temperature the repression of TH by Abd-B. This reduces melanin production
  in the posterior abdomen. Colocalizations on polytene chromosomes suggest that they
  directly regulate TH. Some of them may also regulate together the expression of
  other enzymes, as suggested by the detection of BAB and CRM in the cytological region
  containing the locus of the ddc. Indeed, we showed that BAB represses ddc, at least
  indirectly. Furthermore, the detection of BAB in the cytological region containing
  ebony suggests that it might be also involved in its regulation. The pigment synthesis
  pathway represented here is a consensus pathway between the models proposed by several
  authors (see  for details).
