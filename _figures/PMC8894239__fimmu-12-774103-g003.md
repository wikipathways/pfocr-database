caption: 'mTOR-mediated regulation of immune cells fate in the tumor microenvironment.
  Activation of mTORC2 following CD28 stimulation induces GCK expression. GCK promotes
  the migration of Tregs into tumor tissues via inducing rearrangement of the cytoskeleton.
  Inflammatory stimulus and Foxp3 reprogramming Treg cell metabolism by balancing
  mTORC1 signaling and glucose metabolism to promote the proliferation and suppressive
  function of Treg cells. TLR-mediated activation of mTOR impairs Treg cells suppressive
  capacity. In contrast to the mTOR pathway, Foxp3 reduces glucose uptake, glycolysis,
  and anabolic metabolism while enhancing oxidative and catabolic metabolism. AMPK
  activation following metabolic stresses such as increases in ATP: ADP ratio during
  hypoxia suppresses the expression of Glut1 and glycolysis in Tregs by modulating
  the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which reprograms Treg cell metabolism to promote mitochondrial
  oxidative metabolism rather than glycolysis. Interaction of PD-L1 on tumor cells
  with PD-1 on tumor-specific T cells promotes differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells
  into Tregs. Downregulation of glutamine and leucine metabolism support Tregs differentiation
  while repressing the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 effector. In the TME, the upregulation
  of ARG-1 and iNOS expression in MDSCs results in the depletion of L-Arginine. ARG1-mediated
  hydrolysis of L-Arginine leads to urea production, which subsequently induces metabolic
  reprogramming of various cellular components in TME, especially T cells, by suppressing
  the mTOR signaling pathway. TAMs-derived exosomes enriched ApoE promotes the migration
  of gastric cancer cells by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Additionally,
  PI3K/ Akt/mTOR pathway increases the infiltration of immune-suppressive monocytes
  into tumor sites via inducing the expression of MCP-1 and IL-10, mainly through
  TGF-β1. Hypoxia-induced tumor exosomes that contain let-7a miRNA promote OXPHOS
  activity and downregulate insulin/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in bone marrow-derived
  macrophages and promote polarization of infiltrating macrophages to an M2-like phenotype.
  mTOR inhibition suppressed the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs via blocking
  the iNOS pathway and ARG-1 activity. TAM, tumor microenvironment; GCK, glucokinase;
