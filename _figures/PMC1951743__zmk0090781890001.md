caption: Signaling pathways that are most likely to be implicated in the generation
  of DAG at the Golgi. Enzymes involved in the production of DAG and the inhibitors
  used in this study are shown. DAG degradation enzymes and the metabolites generated
  from this lipid are omitted for simplicity. Cer, ceramide; CerS, CoA-dependent dihydroceramide/ceramide
  synthase; DAG, diacylglycerol; DAGK, dicylglycerol kinase; FB1, fumonisin B1; PA,
  phosphatidic acid; PAP/LPP, phosphatidic acid phosphatase/lipid phosphate phosphatase;
  PC, phospatidylcholine; PI4P, phosphatidylinositol, 4 monophosphate; PI4,5P2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-biphosphate; PC-PLC, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C; PI-PLC, phosphoinositides-specific
  phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; SM, sphingomyelin; SMS, sphingomyelin synthase
  1; S-1-P, sphingosine-1-phosphate.
