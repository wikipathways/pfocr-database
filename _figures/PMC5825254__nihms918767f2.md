caption: In normal conditions, midbrain DA neurons display various firing rates with
  episodes of bursts and tonic activity interspersed with pauses. Subsequent changes
  in extracellular DA will engage different subsets of D1-SPNs in the striatum. D1Rs
  located in the SNr can directly filter D1-SPN GABA output to provide for action
  selection, represented here as inhibition of different SNr projection neurons. In
  PD, DA neurons degenerate and homeostatic plasticity develops which leads to increased
  intrinsic excitability and evoked GABA release from D1-SPN synapses in response
  DA replacement with L-DOPA. Increased output from D1-SPNs and loss of filtering
  by presynaptic receptors, for instance by GABAB receptors (not shown), will result
  in surges of GABA efflux in the SNr. The lack of selection of GABA output from D1-SPNs
  will trigger hyperkinetic responses when extracellular DA is produced by L-DOPA
  administration, such as LID.
