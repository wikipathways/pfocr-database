caption: Targeting Notch signalling pathway regulates angiogenesis in the pathological
  ovary. Interaction of Notch receptors with Notch ligands, such as Delta-like or
  Jagged, between two endothelial tip cells and stalk cells leads to a cascade of
  proteolytic cleavages. Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released from the cell
  membrane by γ-secretase complex. Then, NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it
  interacts with the DNA-binding protein RBP-Jkappa, thus further activating the transcription
  of Notch target genes. Further, endothelial cell are activated and network formation
  is induced during angiogenesis in pathological ovary. Different strategies have
  been used to block Notch signalling by using anti-Dll4 monoclonal antibodies, γ-secretase
  inhibitors, anti-Notch antibodies, or Notch1-trap. Given that crosstalking of VEGF
  and Notch play an important role in angiogenesis in pathological ovary, VEGF could
  be blocked by anti-VEGF antibodies
