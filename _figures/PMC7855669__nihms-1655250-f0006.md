caption: Upon perception of the ligands, several RLKs and RLPs transduce the signal
  into the plant cell employing shared key components. For instance, upon BR perception,
  BRI1 associates with BAK1, which phosphorylate BSK1 and CDG1 and release BIK1 from
  BRI1. Subsequently, BSK1 and CDG1 phosphorylate BSU1 which in turn deactivate BIN2
  allowing the dephosphorylated BZR1 and BES1 to enter the nucleus and induce the
  activation of BR-related genes. EMS1 form a complex with SERK1/2 in response to
  TPD1 regulating anther development. Recent studies have shown that upon EMS1-SERKs
  complex formation, BZR1 and BES1 activate anther development genes. In the presence
  of bacterial infections, FLS2 binds to BAK1/BKK1 and subsequently phosphorylate
  BIK1 resulting in ROS burst. BSK1 and BIK1-dependent BSU1 phosphorylation also occur
  leading to MAPK activation. Besides, PEPR1 and PEPR2 also associate with BAK1 and
  BKK1 in response to Peps and subsequently, phosphorylate BIK1. Later, the MAPK cascade
  is activated in response to both flg22 and Peps perception and results in transcriptional
  reprogramming to activate immunity. Maroon arrows indicate the pathway activated
  by BRI1; meanwhile the purple arrows represent the pathway activated by EMS1. The
  blue arrows indicate the pathway activated by FLS2, while the green arrows represent
  the pathway activated by PEPR1/2. Black arrows indicate converged pathways. Circled
  P represents phosphorylation events. Created with BioRender.com
