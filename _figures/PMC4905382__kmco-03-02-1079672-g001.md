caption: Involvement of SHOT-RNAs in sex hormone-dependent breast and prostate cancers.
  The sex hormone signaling pathway promotes angiogenin (ANG)-mediated cleavage of
  the anticodon loop of mature aminoacylated tRNAs, which causes accumulation of Sex
  HOrmone-dependent TRNA-derived RNAs (SHOT-RNAs). 5′-SHOT-RNAs contain a phosphate
  (P) at the 5′-end and a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (cP) at the 3′-end, whereas 3′-SHOT-RNAs
  contain a hydroxyl group (OH) at the 5′-end and an amino acid (aa) at the 3′-end.
  5′-SHOT-RNAs enhance cell proliferation and thereby may promote tumorigenesis and
  tumor growth.
