caption: Economic evaluations conducted alongside clinical trials provide estimates
  of cost-efficacy. Conventional pharmacoeconomic analysis of new drugs are usually
  performed at the end of phase 3 trials. At this stage, non-establishment of cost-effectiveness
  might delay the approval and marketing of drugs. Early cost-effectiveness analysis,
  informed by comparative effectiveness evidence generated from pharmacometric models
  conducted across the drug development pathway can be informed by the well-established
  MBDD framework. Drug models include the characterization of concentration-time-effect
  relationship. Disease progression models describe the relationship between time
  course of disease and disease-specific biomarkers. Trial model describes protocol-deviations
  such as medication non-adherence and special populations. These analyses can be
  used to 1) provide early estimates of cost-effectiveness to support strategic R&D
  decisions of pipeline drugs (e.g., early termination of uneconomic product, resource
  utilization) and pricing decisions (e.g., consideration of benefit in value-based
  pricing). Additionally, they can help model long-term outcomes from surrogate end-points,
  thus predicting formulations, dosing strategies and patient sub-groups that are
  likely to show cost-effectiveness, especially in scenarios where conducting clinical
  trials is not possible. 2) Design efficient and more informative phase 3 trials.
  3) Assess the impact of real-world scenarios such as non-adherence, dose adaptation
  in response to toxicity or public health care utilization patterns and outcomes
