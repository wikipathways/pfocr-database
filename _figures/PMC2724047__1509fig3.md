caption: Downregulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) by bile acids, cytokines,
  and FGF-15/19. Bile acids are transported into the hepatocyte via the Na+/taurocholate
  cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). In vitro, bile acids activate ASM-generating
  ceramide, which causes the clustering and activation of the FAS receptor. This receptor
  then activates the JNK signaling pathway. Activation of the JNK 1/2 pathway by bile
  acids, TNF-α, IL-1, or fibroblast growth factor-15/19 (FGF-15/19) is hypothesized
  to result in the phosphorylation of HNF4α, decreasing its ability to activate the
  gene encoding CYP7A1. BARE, bile acid-responsive element; MKK4/7, MAP kinase kinase
  4/7; RXR, retinoid X receptor.
