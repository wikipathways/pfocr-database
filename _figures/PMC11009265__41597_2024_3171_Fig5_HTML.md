caption: 'An Overview of the PKT Human Disease Mechanism Knowledge Graph. This figure
  provides a high-level overview of the primary node and edge types in the PKT Human
  Disease Mechanism knowledge graph. (a) illustrates the relationships between the
  core set of Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry ontologies when
  including their imported ontologies (as of August 2022). (b) illustrates the edges
  or triples that are added to the core set of merged ontologies in (a). Shared colors
  between (a) and (b) represent a single resource. For example, chemicals, cofactors,
  and catalysts share the same color (maroon) and are part of ChEBI. This is the same
  for the RO, which is represented in (b) as the black lines between nodes. The green
  and yellow rectangles indicate data sources that are not from an OBO Foundry ontology
  and the specific ontology used to integrate them with the core set of ontologies
  in (a). For example, variant, transcript, and gene data are connected to the core
  ontology set via the SO. Acronyms: CL (Cell ontology); CLO (Cell Line Ontology);
  ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest); GO (Gene Ontology); HPO (Human
  Phenotype Ontology); Mondo (Mondo Disease Ontology); PRO (Protein Ontology); PW
  (Pathway Ontology); SO (Sequence Ontology); VO (Vaccine Ontology); Uberon (Uber-Anatomy
  Ontology).'
