caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the hypothesis of signaling regulation in
  aGVHD. In patients with aGVHD, the expression of Tim‐3 is significantly increased.
  Galectin‐9 binding to Tim‐3 may inhibit the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and
  enhance the function of Treg cells. On the other hand, TGF‐β promotes the differentiation
  of Treg cells through autocrine secretion, while TGF‐β induces the expression of
  Galectin‐9 in a paracrine manner. The increased Treg cells can inhibit the activation
  of Th1 and Th17 cells by secreting TGF‐β, thus alleviating aGVHD by inducing immune
  tolerance. aGVHD, acute graft‐versus‐host disease; IFN‐γ, interferon‐gamma; IL,
