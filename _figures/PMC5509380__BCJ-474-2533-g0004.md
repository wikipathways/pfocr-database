caption: Precursors are imported into the IMS via the TOM complex, where they then
  follow one of two routes. (A) The stop-transfer pathway of TIM23 (translocase of
  the inner membrane 23) embeds proteins in the IM before they are cleaved and subsequently
  released into the IMS (1). Mia40 of the MIA pathway traps proteins in the IMS by
  introducing disulfide bonds which induce folding (2). (B) Unfolded substrate proteins
  enter the IMS and are folded by Mia40, which causes Mia40 to become reduced (1).
  Mia40 is then reoxidized by the homodimer Erv1, containing FAD as a cofactor (2).
  Reduced Erv1 is then reoxidized through the movement of electrons to the final electron
  acceptor cytochrome C (CytC) (3).
