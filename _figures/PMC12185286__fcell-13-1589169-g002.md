caption: The mechanism of BMSCs transplantation on neural plasticity. BMSCs transplantation
  can inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IFN-γ,
  promote the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β, regulate
  Botch signaling pathway, so as to improve neuroinflammation; BMSCs transplantation
  increases SOD content, decreased apoptosis, LDH activity and MDA content, and increased
  the expression of BDNF, CNTF, BCL-2 and GSH. They can regulate oxidative stress
  response; BMSCs transplantation can also promote the release of neurotrophic factors
  and cell migration, including the upregulation of BDNF, GDNF, VEGF and NGF; PI3K/Akt
  and Hippo signaling pathways are also involved; BMSCs-Exos can promote the increase
  of M2 phenotype and the decrease of M1 phenotype, while IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS and other
  cytokines are reduced, IL-10 and TGF-β are increased, and the number of TUNEL positive
  neurons is reduced, so as to promote neural plasticity and neural recovery
