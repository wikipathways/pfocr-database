caption: 'Pathological role of AhR/CYP1A1 in the pancreas: activation of AhR in the
  pancreatic islets upon exposure to ligands such as TCDD, leads to induction of CYP1A1,
  with subsequent generation of ROS and disruption of PKC and mitogen activated protein
  kinases (MAPK) signaling pathways, resulting in impaired insulin secretion and glucose
  intolerance within the islet. In addition, AhR–ARNT complexes formed in the pancreas
  also regulate the expression of specific genes, such as MODY-2 and Akt-2, which
  are critical to glucose metabolism and hemostasis. Created by bioRender.com'
