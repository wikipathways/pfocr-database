caption: Mechanisms of amino acids and lipid metabolism in ferroptosis. Cysteine can
  be transported into the cell, whereas glutamate can be transported out of the cell
  by the Xc-system. Cysteine can be used to synthesize glutathione to maintain the
  balance of the redox state, and it can also be synthesized through the transsulfurization
  pathway blocked by CARS. Glutamate can be converted to a-KG by transaminase or GLUD1
  pathway and participate in TCA, thereby generating ROS. PUFAs derived from cell
  membranes can be catalyzed by ACSL4 and LPCAT to PUFA-PE, and PUFA-PE can be peroxidized
  by the LOX family. FSP1 and coenzyme Q also play an important role in the antioxidant
  system of coenzyme Q.
