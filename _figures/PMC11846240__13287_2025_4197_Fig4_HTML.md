caption: The potential mechanism of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSCs-exo)
  in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Western diet can induce M1 polarization
  of macrophages in liver, release inflammatory factors, and promote the formation
  and progression of NASH. MSCs-exo can induce M2 polarization of macrophages, reduce
  the release of inflammatory factors, and alleviate the formation and progression
  of NASH. The mechanism may be that exosomes-derived miR-24-3p regulates STING signaling
  pathway in macrophages
