caption: PARK2 loss connects AMPK-mediated nitrosative stress to PI3K/AKT activation.
  Parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PRKN, best known as PARK2) loss prevents
  degradation of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy leading to impaired respiration,
  lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and an increase in ROS. Protein kinase
  AMP-activated catalytic subunit α 1 (AMPK) gets activated in response to metabolic
  stress and in turn induces activation of nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3, best known
  as eNOS), resulting in an increase in nitric oxide (NO) levels and concomitant inactivation
  of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) via S-nitrosylation, thereby promoting
  the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT serine/threonine kinase
  1 (PI3K/AKT) pathway. Other proteins in the pathway that could be the target of
  aberrant S-nitrosylation are EGFR and protooncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src.
  AMPK can be activated by various additional modulators including (1) Metabolic stress
  that depletes ATP; e.g., by hypoxia, oligomycin, 2-Deoxy-glucose (2-DG) and dichloroacetate
  (DCA); (2) kinases; Serine/threonine-protein kinase STK11 (STK11, best known as
  LKB1) and Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2); (3) Pharmacological
  activators; e.g., 991, Metfor-min and 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide
  (AICAR); and (4) Adipokines; leptin and adiponectin. Metabolic stress-induced AMPK
  activation was shown to be sufficient to trigger PTEN S-nitrosylation even in the
  presence of functional PARK2.
