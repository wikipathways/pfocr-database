caption: 'Potential mechanism by D206008-mediated melanogenesis in B16 cells.Notes:
  D206008 activates Akt and GSK-3β via phosphorylation and decreases the phosphorylation
  level of β-catenin, which increases its accumulation in cytoplasm, and subsequent
  nuclear translocation. This leads to the upregulation of the melanogenic genes TYR,
  TRP-1, and TRP-2 via MITF. D206008 promoted phosphorylation of Akt and led to increased
  intracellular p-GSK-3β expression, resulting in the accumulation of the β-catenin
  in the cytoplasm by inhibiting the phosphorylation of β-catenin, which translocated
  into the nucleus and activated the transcription of melanogenic genes TYR, TRP-1,
  and TRP-2 via MITF. D206008 activates Akt and GSK-3β via phosphorylation and decreases
  the phosphorylation level of β-catenin, which increases its accumulation in cytoplasm,
  and subsequent nuclear translocation. This leads to the upregulation of the melanogenic
  genes TYR, TRP-1, and TRP-2 via MITF. D206008-induced melanin synthesis was completely
  blocked by GSK-3β and Akt inhibitors. D206008-induced melanin synthesis was completely
  blocked by GSK-3β and Akt inhibitors.Abbreviations: BIO, 6-bromoindirubin-3 ′-oxime;
