caption: Synthetic representation of the main mechanisms leading to BRAF and MEK inhibitors
  acquired resistance frequently present in melanoma and colorectal cancer in vivo
  and in vitro. (1) MEK1 mutation which attenuated the ability of MEK inhibitor to
  prevent extracellular regulated kinases (ERK) activation; some mutation leads to
  cross resistance to BRAF inhibition; (2) amplification of BRAF leads to acquired
  resistance to MEK Inhibitor and to BRAF inhibitor depending on hyper-activation
  of MEK ; (3) NRAS mutant (Q61R) was identified in a progression phase, resistant
  cells in vitro maintained both phospho-active MEK and ERK despite the presence of
  BRAF inhibitor; (4) reduction of ERK-dependent negative feedback on the mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPK) pathway.
