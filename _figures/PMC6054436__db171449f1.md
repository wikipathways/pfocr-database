caption: Synthesis of ceramide and other measured sphingolipids. Shown are simplified
  pathways leading to ceramide, sphingomyelin, glucosyl ceramide, and lactosyl ceramide,
  the four sphingolipids measured in the study. In the de novo synthesis pathway and
  the salvage pathway, ceramide is formed by acylation of a fatty acid (FA) to a “sphingoid”
  backbone, dihydrosphinganine and sphingosine, respectively. There are six ceramide
  synthases in humans with different fatty acid specificities, resulting in multiple
  ceramide species carrying different fatty acids. Synthesis of ceramide by the two
  pathways occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Ceramide can also be formed by sphingomyelinases
  on the plasma membrane. Sphingomyelin is synthesized by sphingomyelin synthase by
  addition of a choline head group to ceramide transported to the Golgi. Glucosyl
  ceramide is synthesized by addition of a glucose head group to ceramide, and lactosyl
  ceramide by further addition of galactose to glucosyl ceramide, also in the Golgi.
