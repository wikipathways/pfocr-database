caption: 'Proposed regulatory pattern for the ‘12.5T’ compared to the ‘FHT’ fruit.
  (A) Integrative perspective of fruit physiology and ripening hormones. Across the
  physiological traits assessed in this study, the ‘12.5T’ fruit exhibited: (a) reduced
  ethylene production, sugars, and IDA; (b) extended ripening time, high firmness,
  ABA levels, and β-carotene content (P < 0.05); and (c) color and other quality parameters
  (see Fig. 1) similar to the ‘FHT’. Hormone regulation: focusing on the ‘12.5T’ fruit,
  transcriptomic analysis suggests differential expression of ABA-related genes (Fig.
  3F). We propose that upregulated NCEDs may lead to increased ABA production, and
  that storage at 12.5°C reduced expression of RCARs, potentially requiring more active
  ABA production to interact with receptor proteins. Contrary to typical ABA signaling
  transduction, our data showed activation of PP2Cs, and no changes in SnRK2s, implying
  an abnormal regulation of the ABA pathways. High ABA contents may contribute to
  the upregulation of ethylene biosynthesis genes [26], sustaining ethylene production
  under low temperatures postharvest. Furthermore, our data suggest that RCARs, PP2Cs,
  ACOs, and ACSs may be regulated by DNA methylation (see Table 2). (B) Chronological
  clocks versus multiple biological clocks in fruit off-the-vine development at 12.5°C.
  The chronological age of the ‘12.5T’ fruit does not align with its biological age.
  We use the term ‘development’ to describe the processes undergone by ‘12.5T’ fruit,
  recognizing it as more than a simple ripening and senescence process. We propose
  the existence of multiple biological clocks by integrating concepts elaborated by
  Jensen et al. in mammals [52] and by van de Poel et al. in tomatoes [53]. Using
  the ‘FHT’ fruit as the standard, our ‘12.5T’ fruit appears ‘young’ in the clocks
  of ‘firmness’, ‘ethylene’ and ‘DNA methylation’. However, it shared the same age
  under the clock of ‘fruit color’ and some master ‘ripening TFs’, i.e. RIN, FUL1,
  and FUL2 expression and is evidently ‘older’ according to the chronological clock.
  This suggests a complex interplay of biological processes governing fruit development,
  under low but non-chilling temperature, with different traits exhibiting varied
  rates of changes over time'
