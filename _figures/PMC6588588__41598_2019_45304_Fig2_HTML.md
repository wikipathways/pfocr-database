caption: T cells are differentiated into multiple T cell subtypes including Th1, Th2,
  T-fh, Th17 and T-reg cells. Each cellular differentiation pathway is known to be
  controlled by key transcription factors. Examples include TBX21, GATA3, BCL6, RORγt,
  and FOXP3 for Th1, Th2, T-fh, Th17, and T-reg cells, respectively. Th1 cells and
  Th2 cells interact with each other to balance immune responses to cancer.
