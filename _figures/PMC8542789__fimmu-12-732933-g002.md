caption: 'Signaling pathway of NLRP3 inflammasome and the role of NLRP3 inflammasome
  in autoimmune diseases. The priming stage: the binding of cytokines or PAMPs to
  its receptors can activate NF-κB signaling pathway, which upregulates transcription
  of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18. The activation stage: this stage is stimulated
  by PAMPs and DAMPs. The activating signals, including K+ efflux, Ca2+flux, Cl− efflux,
  mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS production, lysosomal disruption, and NEK7 promote
  oligomerization of NLRP3, ASC, and pro-caspase-1 to format NLRP3 inflammasome complex.
  The active caspase-1 can cleave proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and promote
  pyroptosis mediated by Gasdermin D. The role of NLRP3 inflammasome in autoimmune
  diseases: inflammation promoted by cytokines IL-1β and IL-18; adaptive immune dysfunction
  caused by cytokines, such as proliferation and differentiation of T cells; pyroptosis,
  which can cause histiocytic death such as insulin β-cells.'
