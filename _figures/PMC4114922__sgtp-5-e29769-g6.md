caption: Figure 6. Trio in physiological processes initiated by Gαq-protein coupled
  receptors. In vitro binding of Gαq to Trio releases the PH2-mediated inhibition
  of DH2, and thereby activates the GEFD2 activity toward RhoA. (A) In C. elegans,
  EGL-30/Gαq binding to UNC-73 isoforms activates RhoA, leading to egg laying, locomotion
  and growth of the animal together with the EGL-8/PLCβ pathway. UNC-73 isoforms are
  therefore major effectors of the Gαq pathway and play a major role in the development
  and the physiology of the worm. (B) In mammals, Trio mediates the Gαq-elicited mitogenic
  response through Rac1 and RhoA activation, by acting on p38 and Jun kinase (JNK),
  which control nuclear AP-1 activity.
