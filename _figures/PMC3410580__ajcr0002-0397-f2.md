caption: Structure and interacting partners of p62/SQSTM1. The structure of p62/SQSTM1
  is composed of domains required for its interaction with autophagic machinery and
  with signaling pathways involved in the antioxidant response, inflammation, metabolism
  and, ultimately, in cancer. The N-terminal Phox and Bpem1 (PB1, aa. 21-103) domain
  is responsible for the self-oligomerization of p62 or the heterodimerization with
  the p62 homolog protein NBR1. This PB1 domain is also involved in the binding of
  p62 to atypical PKC (aPKC) or to ERK1. Next, the central zing finger ZZ domain (aa.
  128-163) and the TRAF6-binding domain (TBD, aa. 225-250) interact with RIP1 and
  TRAF6, respectively, to regulate the NFkB pathway. Between these two domains is
  the region that interacts with the Raptor protein, which is involved in the activation
  of the metabolic kinase mTOR. Through the C-terminal LC3-interacting region (LIR,
  aa. 321-345) and ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA, aa.386-440), p62 links the autophagic
  machinery to ubiquitinated protein substrates to promote the selective degradation
  of these substrates. The affinity of the UBA domain for ubiquitinated lysine residues
  is modulated by caseine kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of serine 403. Finally,
  the Keap-interacting region (KIR, aa. 346-359) binds Keap1 to induce the nuclear
  translocation of the NRF2 transcription factor engaged in the antioxidant response.
