caption: HSCs sense peripheral inflammation or infection induced by bacteria, viruses,
  or fungi (or components thereof, such as the fungal-derived β-glucan, which is a
  prototypical trained-immunity-inducing agonist) and adapt by increasing proliferation
  and skewing toward the myeloid lineage. In β-glucan-trained mice, this agonist induces
  elevated innate immune mediators in the BM, such as, IL-1β and granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). HSCs from β-glucan-trained mice display upregulation
  of genes encoding key regulatory enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, e.g., hexokinase
  3 (Hk3), phosphofructokinase, platelet (Pfkp) and pyruvate kinase (Pkm), as well
  as upregulation of genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, such as the gene
  encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (Hmgcr). In contrast, HSCs from
  β-glucan-trained mice exhibit downregulation of the gene encoding ATP-binding cassette
  transporter A1 (Abca1), which promotes cholesterol efflux. The HMG-CoA reductase
  inhibitor, atorvastatin, inhibits the trained immunity-induced HSPC expansion. Increased
  cholesterol synthesis or downregulation of cholesterol efflux drive myeloid cell
  expansion by increasing HSPC expression of CD131, the common β-subunit of the receptor
  for IL-3 and GM-CSF.
