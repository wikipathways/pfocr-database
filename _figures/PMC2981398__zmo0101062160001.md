caption: Role of the N-end rule pathway in RGS protein degradation. The N-end rule
  pathway of protein degradation is based on destabilizing residues in the N terminus
  of a protein. These are represented with standard one-letter amino acid codes. The
  primary destabilizing residues (green) are ubiquitylated by a series of enzymes
  initially identified in yeast, N-recognin (Ubr1p, E3), Ub-conjugating enzyme (Ubc2p,
  E2), and Ub-activating enzyme (Uba1p, E1), and then are targeted for proteasomal
  degradation. The secondary residues [yellow; Asp (D) and Glu (E)] must first be
  arginylated by R-transferase (mammalian ATE-1) to create primary N-degrons. The
  third secondary destabilizing residue, Cys (C), is oxidized before arginylation.
  Finally, the tertiary destabilizing residues (red) Asn (N) and Gln (Q) are converted
  to secondary residues by the mammalian N-terminal amidases specific for asparagine
  (Ntan1) and glutamine (Ntaq1), respectively. Several RGS proteins are predicted
  substrates for this pathway based on their N-terminal residues (indicated in the
  figure). RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16 (purple) are so far the only RGS proteins confirmed
  to be degraded by this pathway (; ; ). Also shown are native RGS proteins predicted
  to be stable and mutant RGS proteins that are either stabilized or have been shown
  to be degraded through the proteasome ().
