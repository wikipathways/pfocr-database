caption: 'Role of the carnitine shuttle in the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway.
  The shuttle is constituted by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) that converts
  acyl-CoAs into acyl-carnitines; carnitine/acyl-carnitine carrier (CAC) that allows
  the uptake of acyl-carnitines in the mitochondrial matrix in exchange with free
  carnitine, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) that converts acyl-carnitines
  back to acyl-CoAs and releases free carnitine, which is ready to be translocated
  back to the cytosol by CAC. Once in the matrix, acyl-CoA undergoes β-oxidation with
  the production of acetyl-CoA that enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Other
  abbreviations: IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane;
  PM, plasma membrane.'
