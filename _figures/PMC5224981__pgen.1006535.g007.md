caption: Cholesterol was biosynthesized from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), a metabolic
  intermediate of the mevalonate pathway. FPP could be catalyzed into another metabolite,
  geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), by geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS).
  GGPP then was used for the geranylgeranylation and activation of Rho GTPase and
  Rab GTPase. The activated Rho GTPase was responsible for the localization of cell
  junction proteins in the oocyte membrane to maintain physical connection between
  oocyte and granulosa cells. The activated Rab GTPase might account for the secretion
  of oocyte materials such as Gdf9. The two processes were probably important for
  the proliferation of granulosa cells from one layer to multiple layers and ultimately
  promote the primary-secondary follicle transition. The pathway in the box might
  mainly occur in granulosa cells. Dashed arrows depicted possible mechanism of GGPP-regulated
  small GTPase on oocyte-granulosa cell communication.
