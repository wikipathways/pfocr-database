caption: a Circular illustration of cell type enrichments, with nodes sized by Z-score
  and color-coded by FDR. b Scatter plot illustrating enriched functions and pathways,
  with the 10 most significant terms/pathways labelled. Functions are based on Gene
  Ontology (GO) Biological Process and Molecular Function terms, while pathways based
  on KEGG (Environmental Information Processing pathways). Each dot corresponds to
  an individual term/pathway, with the size proportional to the number of its member
  genes. c Forest plot illustrating enriched phylostrata (ancestors) ordered by evolutionary
  history. Genes first created at the ancestor ‘Amniota’ are indicated in the right
  panel, along with their pathway enrichments. Notably, the significance level (FDR),
  odds ratio, and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs; represented by lines) were calculated
  using one-sided Fisher’s exact test
