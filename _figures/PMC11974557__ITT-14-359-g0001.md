caption: Mechanisms of Adipose Tissue Inflammation and Insulin Resistance Mediated
  by TLR4 Activation and Adipokines. Adipose tissue in obesity secretes pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (eg, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and adipokines (eg, leptin, resistin, chemerin),
  which activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. TLR4 is also activated by
  damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α),
  and excess free fatty acids (FFAs), leading to downstream activation of JNK1 and
  IκB kinase β (IKKβ). This signaling pathway activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
  in immune cells, inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis. Simultaneously, reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) generated by these processes amplify the inflammatory response.
  Chronic inflammation interferes with insulin receptor signaling by suppressing IRS1/IRS2
  via the induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins. This disruption
  inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway, impairing GLUT-1 translocation and glucose uptake.
  These processes collectively contribute to immune cell activation, proliferation,
  ROS production, and inflammation, exacerbating insulin resistance and metabolic
  dysfunction. Created in BioRender. Berbudi, (A) (2024) https://BioRender.com/p64z950
