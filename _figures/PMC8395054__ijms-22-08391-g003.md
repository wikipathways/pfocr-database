caption: 'A simplified overview of the role of autophagy and Beclin-1 in CCND1 degradation,
  as a possible mechanism actionable for G 1/S cell cycle arrest in cancer. Radiation
  and chemotherapy are also considered in this domain. Some steps of the pathway are
  indicated, as shown in different tumors. A: Ubiquitation in CCND1 levels is achievable
  by gamma irradiation []. B: Ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy functionally
  cooperate with one another for protein homeostasis []. C: Autophagy is induced in
  response to environmental stress resulting in abnormal or degraded proteins [].
  Beclin-1 (encoded by the BECN1 gene) is an autophagy protein, which has a critical
  role in the autophagy machinery. LC3 is a protein of the late autophagy pathway,
  necessary for autophagosome, biogenesis, and is used as an autophagy marker. D:
  Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus [], rapamycin [,], amiodarone
  []) activate autophagy, also concurrently with radiation or temozolomide chemotherapy
  []. E: The autophagosome engulfs degraded proteins [], subsequently digested via
  its fusion with lysosomes. CCND1 colocalizes with Beclin-1 in the cytoplasm [] after
  cancer therapy and this suggests its autophagy degradation. F and G: CCND1 degradation
  deactivates the formation of the CCND1/CDK4 and CDK6 complex, thus activating the
  Rb1-dependent onco-suppressive pathway [] and hampering cell cycle progression [,].
  In gray: an alternative pathway of CCND1 degradation is through the ubiquitin–proteasome
  mechanism (UPD). Active mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibits both UPD and autophagy
  (dashed lines). PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Image copyright © 2021, The
