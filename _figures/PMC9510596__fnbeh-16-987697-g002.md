caption: Putative ways of gut microbiota – host interactions in the context of the
  tryptophan metabolism influencing depressive behavior. (A) Effects of microbiota
  on serotonin pathway include regulation of tryptophan availability which directly
  influences serotonin and probably melatonin synthesis in the brain affecting depressed
  mood. Microbiota can stimulate TPH1 activity by its metabolites (e.g., butyrate).
  Serotonin produced in the gut could have an impact on brain functioning via stimulation
  of the vagus nerve. On the other hand, host serotonin and melatonin synthesis in
  the gut can affect the commensal bacterial composition, contributing individual’s
  susceptibility to depression. (B) Bacterial effects on the kynurenine pathway include
  down-regulation of IDO activity by H2O2 produced by Lactobacillus. The proliferation
  of pathogenic bacteria that stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production stimulates
  IDO activity and QUIN branch of the kynurenine pathway. Increased QUIN is associated
  with depression. On the other hand, increased KYNA levels could be related to reduction
  of depressive symptoms. (C) Depending on the specific catalytic enzymes that different
  bacterial species harbor, tryptophan can be degraded into various indolic compounds.
  They are absorbed by the host into the circulation and can be further metabolized
  in lever; for example, indole is metabolized to IS, which could, in high concentrations,
  lead to depressive behavior. Various indolic compounds (e.g., IPA, ILA, IAld) were
  shown to have neuroprotective effects, but their effects on depression are still
  unexplored. For more details, see explanations in the text. Black dashed arrows
  represent directions of effects (“+” - represents stimulation, “-” - represents
  inhibition). Gray dashed arrows represent directions of movement of metabolites.
  Black dotted arrows represent effects on depression. Black full arrows represent
  host pathways. Blue full arrows represent bacterial pathways. Question marks represent
  effects that are not still well explored. TRP, tryptophan; TPH, tryptophan hydroxylase;
  5-HTP, 5-hydroxytryptophan; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin); MEL, melatonin;
  SERT, serotonin transporter; EC, enterochromaffin cells; IDO, indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase;
  TDO, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase; KYN, kynurenine; KYNA, kynurenine acid; KMO, kynurenine
  3-monooxygenase; QUIN, quinolinic acid; IAld, indole-3-aldehyde; IPA, indole-3-propionic
  acid; ILA, indole-3-lactic acid; IND, indole; IS, indoxil-3-sulfate.
