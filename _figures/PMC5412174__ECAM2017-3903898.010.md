caption: Antifibrosis mechanisms of QSKL on the RhoA/ROCK and MAPK pathways. The RhoA/ROCK
  and MAPK pathways contribute to fibrosis by promoting the migration and proliferation
  of fibroblasts. During the fibrotic process, Ang II combines with AT-1R, which can
  interact with G-proteins such as RhoA. After receiving a signal from AT-1R, RhoA
  will activate the target proteins, such as ROCK1 and ROCK2, which in turn phosphorylate
  MLC and enhance the cytoplasmic division during fibroblast proliferation. Meanwhile,
  MLC promotes cell migration by accelerating the turnover of focal adhesion plaques.
  RhoA can also activate the raf protein on the upper stream of the MAPK signaling
  pathway. Activated raf stimulates MEK which then phosphorylates the ERK and JNK
  proteins. Phosphorylated ERK and JNK activate certain transcription factors that
  translocate into the nucleus and stimulate fibroblast proliferation. QSKL inhibits
  the proliferation and migration of the fibroblasts by acting on the key molecules
  in the RhoA/ROCK and MAPK signaling pathways, thereby exerting antifibrosis effects.
