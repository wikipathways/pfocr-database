caption: PD-1/PD-L1-maintains immune tolerance in tumors. In lymphoid tissue, APCs
  can dispose neoantigens, and then activate naive T cells through MHC-II/TCR interaction
  and B7.1/B7.2/CD28 co-stimulatory pathways. The CD4+ T helper cells can also contribute
  to the priming of CD8+ T cytotoxic cells via various cytokines. In early stages
  of T cell activation, the T-cell response can be downregulated by B7.1/B7.2/CTLA-4
  checkpoint pathways. The effector T cells can proliferate and migrate to TME, leading
  to tumor eradication via MHC-I/TCR interaction. The PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint pathway
  can maintain immune resistance of tumor cells to T-cell attack. The mechanism of
  action is that PD-L1 results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PD-1 cytoplasmic
  ITIM and ITSM in effector T cells, which recruit phosphatases, particularly SHP-2.
  This leads to the dephosphorylation of TCR proximal signaling molecules, attenuating
  TCR and CD28 signals, which promotes T-cell apoptosis, anergy and functional exhaustion.
