caption: Proposed models for the regulation of innate immunity during the development
  of zebrafish. Sensing of commensals through the TLR/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway
  in newly hatched zebrafish primes neutrophils and induces several genes encoding
  proinflammatory (IL-1β and TNF-α) and antiviral (interferons) mediators, which increase
  the resistance of larvae to viral infection. Although the promoters of genes encoding
  antimicrobial effectors (lysozyme and defensin), which do not have the potential
  to cause tissue damage, are constitutively active at high levels during development,
  the induction of proinflammatory genes requires the methylation and acetylation
  histone H3 to their promoters. This regulatory mechanism prevents the pathologies
  associated with excessive inflammation in early developmental stages but allows
  the activation of innate immunity after hatching. K4me3, trimethylated lysine 4
  of H3; K9ac, acetylated lysine 9 of H3; MAMP, microbe-associated molecular patterns.
