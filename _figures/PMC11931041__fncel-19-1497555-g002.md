caption: 'The diagram of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) signaling pathway. The PAM pathway
  consists of three basic components, namely PI3 kinase (PI3K), AKT and mammalian
  target of rapamycin-like protein (mTOR), as well as various signaling molecules
  in the bypass pathway, which can inhibit ferroptosis. Phosphatase and tension homolog
  (PTEN), as a lipid phosphatase, dephosphorylates PIP3 to generate PIP2, which restricts
  the recruitment and activation of AKT, thus affecting the whole signaling pathway.
  Ndfip1 can also participate in the pathway, though the specific mechanism is unknown.
