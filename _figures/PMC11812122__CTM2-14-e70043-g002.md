caption: 'The proposed molecular mechanism of POI in CG patients. The accumulation
  of toxic metabolites such as galactitol and galactose‐1‐phosphate could induce oxidative
  stress/mitochondrial dysfunction via increased ROS production in the ovary of CG.
  This in turn activates the ER stress signalling leading to apoptosis and autophagy
  of follicles. Oxidative stress can also cause DNA damage in cells thereby activating
  ATM signalling as evident by increased expression of ATM, CHEK1/2 genes leading
  to cell arrest/ apoptosis of follicles. Furthermore, dysregulated PI3K/AKT signalling
  due to reduced phospho‐AKT and increased PTEN can hinder follicle activation and
  survival. All together these dysfunctional signalling pathways may gradually initiate
  early onset of POI in prepubertal CG patients. PMF: primordial follicles, PF: primary
  follicles, POI: premature ovarian insufficiency'
