caption: 'NO–mediated endothelial paracrine signal. NO released by the endothelium
  as result of eNOS activation has a vasodilatation effect on the vasculature and
  cadiomyocytes and dual effect on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Left side: NO inhibits
  myocyte hypertrophy via PKG-induced suppression of NFAT-transcriptional activity.
  PKG activation reduces Ca2+ availability and calcineurin activity by inhibiting
  L-type Ca2+ channels thus preventing NFAT translocation in nucleus and hypertrophic
  gene program induction. Right side: NO increases ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal
  degradation of negative regulators of G-proteins thus sustains the propagation of
  hypertrophic stimulation via activated Gαq. Cytoplasmic levels of RGS proteins is
  controlled by NO through N-end rule pathway. High NO levels favor RGSs ubiquitination
  and maintain Gα-subunit in active form. Gα activates PLCβ which in turn generates
  DAG and IP3. The released DAG activates PKC to initiate protein kinase cascade,
  increases Ca2+ intracellular influx and finally induces hypertrophic gene program
  by NFAT and MAPK pathways. Released IP3 interacts with IP3-receptors that cause
  a localized Ca2+response resulting in activation of IP3-R-associated CAMK. CAMK
  phosphorylates HDAC4/5 and facilities their nuclear exit, and disinhibits growth-related
  gene transcription.sGCs –soluble guanylyl cyclases; GPCR - G-protein-coupled receptor;
