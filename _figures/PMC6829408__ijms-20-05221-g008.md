caption: 'A model of the miR396-controlled network that is involved in auxin-regulated
  SE induction in Arabidopsis: 2,4-D treatment increased the accumulation of miR396
  in the explants by activating the auxin-responsive MIR396 genes. As a result, the
  GRF genes (GRF1/4/8/9) were repressed, the PLT genes (PLT1/PLT2/BBM) were activated,
  and, in turn, the LEC2 gene, which is a positive regulator of the YUC (YUC1 and
  YUC4) genes that are engaged in auxin biosynthesis during SE, was upregulated [,,,].
  A feedback regulatory loop between PLT and miR396 might also be expected [].'
