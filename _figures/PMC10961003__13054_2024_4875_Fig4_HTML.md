caption: In sepsis Ang-2 acts as an antagonist of Tie 2 which results in disruption
  of protective Ang-1/Tie 2 signalling. The antagonistic effects of Ang-2 leads to
  increased inflammation and inhibition of the vascular stabilising Akt signalling
  pathway. Moreover, the vascular barrier protective effects of Tie 2 are abrogated
  by the cleaving properties of MMP14
