caption: At the level of the immune system, 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits the differentiation
  and maturation of dendritic cells and promotes their apoptosis [], preventing their
  transformation into antigen presenting cells which is the first step in the initiation
  of an immune response []. It has been also demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 restores
  the suppressor cells, decreases Th1 cytokine production—responsible for β-cell death—and
  shifts the immune response toward Th2 pathway, leading to benign insulitis [–].
  The addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits the production of Il-6, a direct stimulator
  of Th17 cells [], implicated in many autoimmune diseases, including T1D []. On the
  other hand, 1,25(OH)2D3 exerts antiapoptotic effects on the cytokine-induced pancreatic
  β-cells apoptosis. It induces and maintains high levels of A20 gene protein, which
  leads to decreased nitric oxide (NO) levels. In fact, NO induces directly beta cell
  dysfunction and death, and, indirectly, through the induction of Fas expression
  []; Fas is a transmembrane cell surface receptor and a member of the tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) receptor family. It is stimulated by inflammatory cytokines secreted
  by islet-infiltrating mononuclear cells. It renders the β-cells in T1DM susceptible
  to Fas-Ligand-induced apoptosis mediated by tissue-infiltrating Fas-Ligand-positive
  T lymphocytes []. Decreasing NO levels leads to down regulation of all the aforementioned
  mechanisms and allows cytoprotective effects on islet cells. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3
  has been found to be able to counteract the cytokine-induced Fas expression in human
  pancreatic islets, both at the mRNA and protein levels, modulating the cascade of
  death signals and preventing cell apoptosis [] ().
