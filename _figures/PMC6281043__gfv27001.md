caption: 'Ion transport regulation by mTORC2 and SGK1 in renal principal cells. Principal
  cells respond to a variety of hormonal and non-hormonal stimuli to control Na+ and
  K+ transport. Aldosterone acts through the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) to alter
  expression of various targets that modulate ion transport, notably the serum and
  glucocorticoid inducible kinase SGK1 and the small chaperone GILZ1 (Glucocorticoid-inducible
  leucine zipper protein 1). Other factors, such as insulin and angiotensin II act
  through the master kinases phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR complex
  2 (mTORC2) to stimulate SGK1 activity. mTORC2 directly phosphorylates SGK1 in its
  hydrophobic motif, while PI3K acts through PI3K-dependent kinase to phosphorylate
  SGK1 in its activation loop. Only when phosphorylated at both these sites is SGK1
  fully active. SGK1 phosphorylates a variety of proteins, notably the ubiquitin ligase,
  Nedd4-2, which is an ENaC inhibitor. SGK1 phosphorylation triggers interaction of
  Nedd4-2 with 14-3-3 proteins, hence reducing ENaC internalization and degradation.
