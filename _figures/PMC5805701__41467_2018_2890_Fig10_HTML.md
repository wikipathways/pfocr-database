caption: Model of an atypical IL-6-Stat3-RFX1-IL-17A regulatory pathway in CD4+ T
  cells of SLE patients. IL-6 stimulation causes the phosphorylation of STAT3, which
  binds intron 7 of RFX1 to repress RFX1 gene transcription through increased DNA
  methylation and decreased histone acetylation. Decreased RFX1 leads to the loss
  of recruitment of DNMT1, HDAC1, and SUV39H1 to the promoter of IL17A gene, which
  decreases the DNA methylation and histone H3K9 tri-methylation and increases the
  histone acetylation, thereby inducing the activation of IL17A gene transcription
papertitle: IL-6/STAT3 pathway induced deficiency of RFX1 contributes to Th17-dependent
  autoimmune diseases via epigenetic regulation.
