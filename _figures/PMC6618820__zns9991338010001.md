caption: 'Simulated visually guided saccade task and hypothesized corticobasal ganglia
  circuit. A, The simulated task. On each trial, a target appears pseudorandomly at
  the left or right, and a correct response is followed by either large or small reward.
  Contingency between the target location and the reward amount is fixed for each
  block (20–28 trials) and alternated across blocks. B, Hypothesized structure and
  operation of the corticobasal ganglia circuit. Target location is represented by
  a subset of a major subtype of corticostriatal neurons, CCS cells, that predominantly
  target striatonigral (direct pathway) dMSNs () (left). These CCS cells activate
  dMSNs, which then inhibit the SNr and thereby disinhibit the SC to initiate a saccade.
  Meanwhile, the CCS cells also activate, via unidirectional projections (), another
  major subtype of corticostriatal neurons, CPn/PT cells, which predominantly target
  striatopallidal (indirect pathway) iMSNs (). These CPn/PT cells sustain their activity
  via strong facilitatory recurrent excitation (), whereas the activity of CCS cells
  declines because of their weaker and depressive recurrent excitation. When reward
  is obtained (right), dopamine neurons in the SNc receive excitatory inputs representing
  the value (amount) of the obtained reward from the neurons in the PPN. The SNc dopamine
  neurons also receive inhibitory inputs from the collaterals of SNr neurons, which
  are disinhibited by the iMSNs downstream of the still active CPn/PT cells. Given
  that the CPn/PT cells represent the location of the saccadic target and that the
  iMSNs represent the reward value predicted from that location, the SNr → SNc inhibition
  represents the reversed-sign predicted reward value. Thus, together with the input
  from the PPN, the dopamine neurons compute reward prediction error. The resulting
  phasic dopamine response induces proportional plastic changes of the synaptic strength
  between the CCS cells and dMSNs so that the activity of dMSNs can represent updated
  reward value predictions. At the synapses between the CPn/PT cells and iMSNs, sustained
  inputs from the CPn/PT cells cause adenosine accumulation and glutamate spillover.
  Phasic increase in dopamine then stimulates the signaling cascade downstream of
  the adenosine A2A receptors, leading to LTP, whereas phasic decrease in dopamine
  causes LTD through the signaling cascade downstream of mGluR5. In consequence, the
  activity of iMSNs can also represent updated reward value predictions. Notably,
  molecular mechanisms of plasticity induction, as well as structures between the
  striatum (Str) and the dopamine neurons, including the SNr, were not explicitly
  modeled, and our model can be also compatible with recent findings that the dopamine
  neurons are regulated by the LHb neurons, which are then driven by GPb (A,B). Also
  notably, although not explicitly illustrated here, we implicitly assumed that the
  striatum and the SNr are topographically organized and only a portion of neurons
  having the corresponding saccadic response fields, rather than an entire population,
  is activated in the task. C, Model equations used for the simulations shown in ,
  , and . xCCS and xCPn indicate the activity of the CCS cells and the CPn/PT cells
  that represent the left-target location (value of 1 is arbitrary; for details, see
  Materials and Methods), xdMSN and xiMSN indicate the population activity of dMSNs
  and iMSNs, respectively, xPPN indicates the activity of the PPN neurons, and xDA
  indicates the response of dopamine neurons compared with its baseline activity.
  w(n) indicates the strength of the connections between the CCS cells and dMSNs and
  those between the CPn/PT cells and iMSNs in the nth left-target trial [note that
  we assumed that CCS–dMSN and CPn/PT–iMSN connections are updated in the same way
  and so described their strength by the single variable w(n)]. f1 and f2 represent
  the input–output functions of dMSNs and iMSNs, respectively: these functions are
  assumed to be a threshold–linear function under the presence of tonic dopamine ().
  α represents the learning rate. γ represents the (relative) strength/efficacy of
  the direct pathway over the indirect pathway, and it corresponds to the time discount
  factor defined in the TD reinforcement learning algorithms (C). The gray parts in
  the equations will be modified in the elaborated model used for the simulations
  shown in .'
