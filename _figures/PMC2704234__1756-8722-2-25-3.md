caption: Immune activation induced by β-glucans. β-glucans can act on a variety of
  membrane receptors found on the immune cells. It may act singly or in combine with
  other ligands. Various signaling pathway are activated and their respective simplified
  downstream signaling molecules are shown. The reactors cells include monocytes,
  macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells and neutrophils. Their corresponding
  surface receptors are listed. The immunomodulatory functions induced by β-glucans
  involve both innate and adaptive immune response. β-glucans also enhance opsonic
  and non-opsonic phagocytosis and trigger a cascade of cytokines release, such as
  tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α and various types of interleukins (ILs).
