caption: The involvement of STAT3 in the regulation of ER activity. STAT3 decreases
  cellular death under different conditions through its ER-dependent activity. Following
  I/R, JAK2-STAT3 pathway rescues SERCA expression and activity, which reduces the
  ER stress occurring during I/R injury. This reduces cell death and helps in inducing
  the infarct size. In addition, STAT3 modulates the ER-mitochondrial calcium release
  by directly interacting with IP3R3 and facilitating its degradation. This consequently
  leads to a decrease in the calcium release from ER to mitochondria, and thus causes
  a decrease in apoptotic cell death. The S727 STAT3 residue plays a regulatory role.
  The images of ER and mitochondria were adapted from Servier Medical Art (https://smart.servier.com/).
