caption: Simplified representation of (A) the signal pathway from reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production (P5 induced) to eventual accumulation of β-catenin. Briefly,
  MG-63s respond to P5 with increased production of ROS, which inhibit AXIN-mediated
  degradation of β-catenin through Dishevelled (DVL). The width of the lines is proportional
  to the reaction kinetics (flux) through each reaction compared to Ref. Note that
  β-catenin accumulation typically induces increased AXIN synthesis. However, this
  is attenuated by the specific expression pattern, as shown in (B) the transcriptional
  regulation of β-catenin target gene expression on P5. A briefly elevated gene expression
  of T-cell specific transcription factor 4 (TCF4), inhibitor of β-catenin and TCF-4
  (ICAT) and SRY-box transcription factor 17 (SOX17) leads to attenuated formation
  of the TCF/β-catenin complex (by ICAT) and proteosomal degradation of the β-catenin
  complex (by SOX17). The β-catenin target gene expression is thereby kept level despite
  its intracellular aggregation. The width of the lines is proportional to the reaction
  kinetics (flux) through each reaction compared to Ref.
