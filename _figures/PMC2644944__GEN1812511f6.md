caption: A model for signaling interactions that connect the Ras/cAMP pathway, Ime2,
  Smk1, and the transcriptional program of sporulation. The early (Ime1-inducible),
  and middle (Ndt80-inducible) phases of the transcriptional program of meiosis are
  indicated by horizontal lines. High levels of glucose lead to high PKA activity
  that inhibits IME1 and prevents meiotic initiation (top). The regulation of the
  Smk1 pathway by PKA occurs only in the presence of intermediate levels of glucose
  that are insufficient to prevent meiotic initiation (middle). In the intermediate
  state PKA is shown to negatively regulate Smk1 directly, through Ime2, or through
  both mechanisms as discussed in the text (dotted lines). Ime2 is shown to activate
  the Smk1 pathway through Ndt80-dependent and Ndt80-independent mechanisms. The Ndt80-independent
  mechanism is largely based on the relatively rapid kinetics of Smk1 inhibition by
  Bn-PP1 in the ime2-as1 strain and therefore should be considered provisional (dotted
  lines). Transition to a low PKA state (bottom) is predicted to relieve inhibition
  and increase Smk1 activity through the pathways indicated.
