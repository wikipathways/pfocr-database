caption: Fig. 1. HBP1 inhibits Wnt–β-catenin-activated gene expression. (A) Schematic
  diagram of Wnt signaling (adapted from ; ). The asterisks mark Wnt pathway components
  with known mutation in cancer. (B) HBP1 inhibits Wnt1-activated gene expression.
  HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 µg of TOPFLASH, 2 µg of RSV–β-Gal, 5 µg of
  Wnt1, and 6 or 12 µg of pEFBOS-HBP1. One microgram of FOPFLASH with and without
  5 µg of Wnt1 was also transfected as a negative control. TOPFLASH contains three
  LEF/TCF sites followed by the minimal TATA and luciferase. FOPFLASH contains three
  mutated LEF/TCF sites followed by the minimal TATA and luciferase. Cells were harvested
  48 h after transfection, and luciferase and β-Gal activity were measured. The results
  are normalized for transfection efficiency and are expressed as a relative ratio
  of luciferase to β-Gal activities (denoted as relative activity). (C) HBP1 inhibits
  LiCl-activated gene expression. HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 µg of TOPFLASH,
  2 µg of RSV–β-Gal, and 3, 6 or 12 µg of pEFBOS-HBP1 (indicated by ramp). Cells were
  treated with 15 mM LiCl for 12 h. One microgram of FOPFLASH was also transfected
  as a negative control. Cells were then harvested at 48 h after transfection. The
  results are normalized for transfection efficiency and are expressed as a ratio
  of luciferase to β-Gal activities. (D) HBP1 inhibits β-catenin activation through
  LEF/TCF DNA binding sites. HEK293T cells were transfected with 2 µg of RSV–β-Gal,
  1 µg of TOPFLASH or 1 µg of FOPFLASH as indicated, 2 µg of β-catenin and 7.5 µg
  of pEFBOS HBP1 as indicated. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase
  and β-Gal activity were measured. The results are normalized for transfection efficiency
  and are expressed as a relative ratio of luciferase to β-Gal activities (denoted
  as relative activity).
