caption: Schematic pathway of PIP2 and its possible contribution to the auditory system.
  Stimulation of receptors coupled to Gα activates Phospholipase C (PLC), which leads
  to the release of diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP3. GPSM2 is a regulator of G protein‐coupled
  receptor signalling that, in turn, stimulates phospholipase C (PLC). The C‐terminal
  cytoplasmic TMIE domain contains charged amino acids that mediate binding to phospholipids,
  including PIP2. DAG remains membrane‐associated and activates protein kinase C,
  whereas IP3 diffused into the cell and stimulates the IP3 receptor in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), leading to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. PKC phosphorylates
  the targets and therefore induces cellular responses including. The figure is redrawn
  from Refs [, ]
