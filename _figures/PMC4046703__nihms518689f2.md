caption: 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors (VSP Inhibitors) being tested in human cancer trials.
  While these agents are being referred to as VEGF Signaling Pathway (VSP) inhibitors,
  drugs such as sunitinib inhibit many other receptor tyrosine kinases allowing them
  to be approved for the treatment of other cancers while at the same time creating
  the possibility for a wide range of “off-target” toxicities. (Illustration Credit:
