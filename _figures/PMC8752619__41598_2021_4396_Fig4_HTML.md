caption: Pathway analysis showing upstream regulators associated with gene expression
  of (A) NLRP3 and (B) CXCL8. Red regulators are upregulated compared to unstimulated
  control cells while blue are downregulated. Red/orange lines indicate that the regulator
  leads to a predicted activation of gene expression while yellow lines indicate disagreement
  between the state of the upstream regulator and the predicted function. Grey lines
  indicate that no activation pattern can be predicted.
