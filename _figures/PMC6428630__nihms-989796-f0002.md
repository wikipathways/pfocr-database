caption: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a central intermediary between abused drugs
  and glia. Morphine is a direct agonist of TLR4 and binds to a unique binding site
  in the myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) domain of the TLR4 receptor. Cocaine
  is a direct agonist for TLR4 and binds to a domain in the MD-2 region of the receptor,
  this binding site is the same site of (+)-naltrexone. Alcohol promotes active endocytosis
  of TLR4 receptors by modulating lipid rafts. TLR4 activation causes the translocation
  of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells (Nf-κβ) to the nucleus via the myeloid differentiation primary response
  88 (MyD88) pathway and MyD88-independent pathways.
