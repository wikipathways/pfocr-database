caption: 'Cancer cell metabolic changes linked to hyper-O-GlcNAcylation. The hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP) outlined in orange boxes integrates metabolic intermediates
  to generate the end-product UDP-GlcNAc. Glucose is transported into cells by glucose
  transporters such as Glut1 and then first phosphorylated by hexokinase to generate
  glucose-6-phosphate. Glucose-6-phosphate can be shunted into the PPP which produces
  nucleotides and NAPDH, or converted into fructose-6-phosphate. While most fructose-6-phosphate
  continues through glycolysis to produce pyruvate, some is directed into the HBP.
  GFAT, the HBP rate-limiting enzyme, irreversibly transfers the amino group from
  glutamine to fructose-6-phosphate, generating glucosamine-6-phosphate and glutamate.
  Glucosamine-6-phosphate is ultimately converted to UDP-GlcNAc, which is used by
  OGT to attach O-GlcNAc to hydroxyl groups of serine and/or threonine residues of
  cytosolic and nuclear proteins. O-GlcNAc is removed by OGA. Cancer cell metabolic
  changes including increased glucose uptake (due to “Warburg effect”) and increased
  glutamine uptake (along with elevated UTP and acetyl-CoA production) cooperate to
  maximize flux through the HBP. Oncogenes such as HIF1α, Kras, and c-Myc regulate
  cancer cell shifts to aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis, including upregulation
  of glucose and glutamine transporters and increased expression of GFAT. Additionally,
  the level of OGT is increased and the level of OGA is decreased. In sum, cancer
  cell metabolic reprogramming leads to increased HBP flux, elevated UDP-GlcNAc, and
  ultimately hyper-O-GlcNAcylation. Proteins and metabolic intermediates in red are
  increased in cancer cells. G6P: Glucose-6-phosphate; F6P: fructose-6-phosphate;
