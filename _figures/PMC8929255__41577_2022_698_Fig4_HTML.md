caption: Gene therapy of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is challenged by various
  immune barriers of both innate and adaptive immune systems. a | Innate immune pathways
  that detect gene-therapy reagents include double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-sensing pathways
  such as those mediated by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) (not shown) and the cGAS–STING
  pathway; DNA damage response pathways such as through the kinase ATM and p53, which
  allow for detection of viral episomal DNA in the nucleus; RNA-sensing pathways such
  as through TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR13, or through retinoic acid-inducible gene I
  (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), that allow for detection of synthetic or viral RNA;
  and pathways that allow for the detection of xenogeneic contaminants that can be
  present when gene-editing reagents such as Cas9 are produced in xenogeneic hosts,
  such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which can be detected by TLR4. The ability of HSCs
  to digest proteins via the proteasome and to present peptides from these proteins
  on MHC class I molecules is also shown. b | The adaptive immune system can also
  present significant challenges to the genetic engineering of HSCs, either when genetically
  edited cells are transplanted back into a patient or, potentially, if genetic engineering
  reagents were delivered to cells in vivo. T cells can recognize cells containing
  foreign proteins (either neoantigens introduced into HSCs or proteins used to genetically
  engineer them) through interaction with antigen-presenting MHC class I molecules,
  which leads to T cell activation and destruction of the genetically modified cell.
  Antibodies produced by B cells can neutralize viral vectors or gene-therapy proteins
  present in the bloodstream. AAV, adeno-associated virus; IFNγ, interferon-γ; TCR,
  T cell receptor; TNF, tumour necrosis factor.
