caption: 'Proposed mechanism underlying FGF-mediated inhibition of RhoA after ICH.
  Thrombin, produced through activation of the coagulation cascade, binds on endothelial
  PAR-1, leading to activation of RhoA and ROCK. The latter induces phosphorylation
  and disintegration of adheres junctions proteins, thus facilitating the development
  of vasogenic brain edema after ICH. FGFs suppress RhoA via FGFR-induced activation
  of the PI3K-Akt-Rac1 signaling pathway. Co-administrations of FGFR inhibitor PD173074
  or PI3K inhibitor LY294002, combined with FGF2 were utilized to study the suggested
  signaling pathway. Y27632 was additionally administered to confirm that ROCK inhibition
  confers neuroprotection after ICH. FGFs: Fibroblast growth factors, FGFR: Fibroblast
  growth factor receptor, ICH: intracerebral hemorrhage, PAR-1: Protease-activated
  receptor-1.'
