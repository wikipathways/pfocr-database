caption: 'Noncanonical and canonical ER signaling axis. We hypothesized that the partial
  agonist activity of tamoxifen versus the estrogen depletion effect of letrozole
  might explain the observed and widely different clinical responses [, , , ]. We
  also hypothesized that noncanonical ER signaling might be involved, in which MER
  can drive noncanonical ER signaling [, , ]. We constructed a map of the signaling
  pathway that comprises the described interactions, and we considered each of the
  treatment scenarios and responses. We found that our hypothesized mechanisms could
  potentially explain the diverging responses to tamoxifen and letrozole when combined
  with trametinib in a patient with hyperactivated RAS pathway signaling. (Scenario
  1): MER‐driven noncanonical ER signaling and RAS signaling (replicating baseline
  condition of current case report). MER/E2 activates AKT and ER, which leads to cell
  growth. Activation of EGFR subsequently activates RAS/MAPK pathway, which also leads
  to growth signaling (similar to KRAS mutation). (Scenario 2): TMX functions as a
  partial agonist for MER‐driven noncanonical ER signaling. Thus, no inhibitory effect
  is seen on ER signaling. (Scenario 3): Combination treatment with tamoxifen and
  trametinib is not sufficient to halt the cell growth despite the successful inhibition
  of RAS/MEK pathway with trametinib because ER signaling is not adequately reduced
  with tamoxifen. (Scenario 4): Combination of estrogen depletion (mimicking treatment
  with letrozole) and trametinib successfully inhibits both ER and RAS signaling,
  thus leading to the inhibition of cell growth. (Scenario 5): Combination of estrogen
  depletion (mimicking treatment with letrozole) and erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor to
  reduce RAS activation) successfully reduces both ER and RAS signaling, thus leading
  to the inhibition of cell growth. Abbreviations: E2, estradiol; EGF, epidermal growth
  factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; MAPK, mitogen‐activated
