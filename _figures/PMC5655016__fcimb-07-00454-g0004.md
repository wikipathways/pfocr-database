caption: 'The flagellar regulon cascade. The regulatory cascade which leads to the
  expression of proteins that are needed to construct a functional flagellum is shown
  (Heuner and Albert-Weissenberger, ; Sahr et al., , modified). Specific environmental
  factors lead to the activation of the pathway through alarmone (ppGpp) accumulation.
  Some main players of the flagellar regulon cascade are: the activator protein FleQ,
  the alternative sigma factor 28 (FliA), the two-component system (LetA/S) and the
  carbon storage regulator (CsrA) as examples. FleQ is the master regulator of the
  flagellar genes (Class II and class III). FliA is the regulator of flagellar genes
  of class IV. Black lined, continuous arrows refer to positive regulation events.
  The broken lines in black refer to negative regulatory effects of respective factors.
  Question marks (?) indicate pathway points with putative mode of actions that need
  to be specified by further investigations. RsmXYZ, regulatory RNAs; FlaA, flagellin;
  FlaR, transcriptional regulator (LysR family); FleQ and FleR, sigma factor 54 activator
  protein; FlgM, anti-sigma 28 factor; RpoS, alternative sigma 38 factor.'
