caption: Some metabolic and signalling circuits that intersect with glutaminase isoenzymes.
  This network schematic representation shows both glutaminase isoenzymes, GLS and
  GLS2, executing a dual function. First, glutaminase is the limiting enzyme in glutaminolysis
  to generate glutamate from glutamine, that can be used for GSH synthesis, the most
  important intracellular antioxidant. Second, both isoenzymes can interact with other
  proteins and signalling pathways. GLS is regulated by the oncogenic transcription
  factor c-Myc and activates mTORC1, which is a major positive regulator of the Warburg
  effect. Tumour suppressor factor p53 is hampered by GLS, but stimulates GLS2. GLS2
  blocks PI3K/AKT signalling pathway while interacts and stabilizes Dicer to mature
  several miRNAs which repress Snail favouring Warburg effect of tumour cells, and
  impacting oxidative status. P53 connects GLS, GLS2, microRNAs, ROS homeostasis and
  cancer. GLS glutaminase isoenzyme, GLS2 glutaminase 2 isoenzyme, GSH glutathione,
  LRH-1 nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1, mTORC1 mammalian target of rapamycin
