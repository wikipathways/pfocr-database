caption: Proteolytic processing of APP by secretases and the spatial arrangement of
  APP fragments in neurons (not drawn in proportion). a Schematic depiction of APP
  cleavage by secretases and the main cleavage fragments derived from APP processing.
  α-secretases cleave APP at a site within the Aβ peptide sequence, thus precluding
  cleavage by β-secretase and formation of Aβ peptides. This cleavage event gives
  raise to sAPPα, a soluble amino-terminal APP fragment and the C-terminal stub CTF83.
  BACE1 cleaves APP at the β-secretase site, yielding sAPPβ and a C-terminal fragment
  CTF99. sAPPβ can be processed through an unknown mechanism (question mark) to generate
  a 55 kDa and a 35 kDa peptide termed N-APP. CTF83 and CTF99 stubs derived from α-
  and β-secretase cleavages can in turn be cleaved intramembranously by γ-secretase,
  and their cleavage invariably results in the release of a peptide fragment comprising
  the intracellular domain of APP (AICD) to the cytosol. Whereas cleavage of CTF83
  by γ-secretase yields a p3 peptide, cleavage of CTF99 results in the generation
  of Aβ peptides. b Schematic depiction of the localization and intracellular trafficking
  of APP and APP metabolites. 1 Major trafficking steps of APP at the biosynthetic
  secretory pathway. TGN Trans-Golgi network, PM plasma membrane, E endosome, L lysosome.
  2 Anterograde and retrograde fast axonal transports of APP and CTFs. 3 Localization
  of APP and secretion of APP fragments at the synaptic compartment. See main text
