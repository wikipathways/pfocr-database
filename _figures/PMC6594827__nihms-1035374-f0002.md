caption: Other fatty acid metabolism targets. Upregulation of CD147 activates the
  AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, leading to increased expression of SREBPlc. Increased
  SREBPlc levels increases FASN and ACC expression, thus causing tumor growth and
  metastasis. Upregulation of CD147 also decreases PPAR α, which downregulates CPTlA
  and ACOXl. Tumor growth and metastasis results from downregulation of CPTlA and
  ACOXl. Decreased AMPK activity leads to tumor growth and metastasis by directly
  upregulating SREBPlc, FASN, and/or ACC. Decreased AMPK activity also downregulates
  CPTlA and ACOXl, thus leading to tumor growth and metastasis. Decreased KLF4 1evels
  leads to decreased MGLL activity, thus causing tumor growth and metastasis.
