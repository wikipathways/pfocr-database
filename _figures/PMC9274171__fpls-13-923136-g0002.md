  CLE14 is induced by ABA, JA, and SA, and CLE14 act as a “brake signal” to these
  hormones-induced leaf senescence though repressing ROS level. CLE41/42/44 delay
  leaf senescence by antagonizing with ethylene signaling pathway. Ethylene promotes
  SL biosynthesis via inducing expression of MAX3 and MAX4 during senescence, so ethylene
  and SL coordinately regulate leaf senescence. Phytohormone ABA and the core component
  of ethylene, EIN2, induce the expression of NAP, a positive regulator of leaf senescence.
  Conversely, NAP increases ABA biosynthesis through inducing expression of AAO3.
  JA-induced leaf senescence is dependent on EIN2. WRKY57 is a negative regulator
  of JA-induced leaf senescence. JA inhibits accumulation of WRKY57 protein and auxin
  promotes WRKY57, so that WRKY57 acts as an integrator of JA and auxin. Besides,
  the repressors of JA and auxin signaling pathway, JAZ4/8 and IAA29 both interact
  with WRKY57, which may be another regulatory level of interplay between JA and auxin.
  Ethylene and SA synergistically accelerate leaf senescence through interaction of
  NPR1 and EIN3 and a concomitant promotion of SAGs expression. SA represses the JA-inducible
  protein ESR, and ESR inhibits the functions of WRKY53, a positive regulator of leaf
  senescence. Furthermore, JA reduces the expression of WRKY53 and SA induces WRKY53
  oppositely. Thus, ESR and WRKY53 are integrators of antagonism between JA and SA
  in leaf senescence. Moreover, low concentration of SA can alleviate JA-induced leaf
  senescence. Generally, hormones presented in green ellipses including CK, auxin,
  GA, CLE41/42/44, and CLE14 delay leaf senescence (bold green symbol). Hormones in
  orange ellipses including ABA, SL, ethylene, JA, and SA promote leaf senescence
  (bold orange arrow).
