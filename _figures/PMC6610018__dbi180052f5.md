caption: The association of cGAS-cGAMP-STING signaling with apoptosis. The activation
  of prodeath proteins such as Bax/Bak promotes mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization
  and the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, leading to activation of intrinsic
  apoptosis through initiator and executioner caspases cascade. Defects in apoptosis
  by knocking out caspase-9 or caspase-3/-7 lead to constitutive activation of the
  cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway; however, the precise mechanisms by which caspase-induced
  apoptosis inhibits innate immune remain unknown. Inflammatory caspases including
  caspase-1, which can be activated by mtDNA release–induced formation of inflammasome,
  or caspase-4, -5, and -11 cleave cGAS, thus preventing the activation of immune
  response. Alternatively, activation of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway promotes apoptosis
  via both transcriptional and nontranscriptional programs in a TBK1-IRF3–dependent
  manner.
