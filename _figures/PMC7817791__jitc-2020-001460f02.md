caption: Direct and indirect signaling pathways downstream of PD-1 blockade in myeloid
  cells. PD-1 blockade results in direct (left) and indirect (right) signaling outcomes.
  Direct PD-1 blockade in PD-1 expressing myeloid cells activates NF-κB and pSTAT1
  signaling pathways and reprograms glycometabolism (left). In the indirect pathway,
  anti-PD-1 activated T cells secrete IFN-y which triggers NF-κB and pSTAT1 signaling
  pathways in myeloid cells (right). Arrows indicate downstream outcomes of PD-1 blockade.
  IFN-γ, interferon gamma; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1.
