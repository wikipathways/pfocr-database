caption: The contribution of chemoattractant GPCRs to glioma stem-like cell mediated
  tumorigenesis, invasion and angiogenesis express various GPCRs. Interaction of GPCRs
  with agonists produced by tumor and stromal cells elicit signaling cascades that
  are crucial for GSLC self-renewal, invasion, angiogenesis, recruitment of BMDC and
  EMT transition. In addition, the GPCRs function in GSLCs is mediated in part by
  crosstalk with EGFR through a Src kinase pathway.
