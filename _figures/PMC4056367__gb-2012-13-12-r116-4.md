caption: 'Application of FOCAL to couple SSALx with biomass production. (a) The putrescine
  degradation pathway. FOCAL predicts that the NAD-dependent succinic semialdehyde
  dehydrogenase (SSALx) reaction is coupled with biomass by removing gabD (whose gene
  product catalyzes SSALy) and growing the mutant in minimal media with putrescine
  and NH4+. (b) The feasible region for the ΔgabD mutant under this condition excludes
  points that lie on the x-axis with the exception of the origin (right), while the
  wild-type can grow on glucose without flux through SSALx (left). Metabolite abbreviations
  not reported in the text: α-kg, α-ketoglutarate; glu-L, L-glutamate.'
