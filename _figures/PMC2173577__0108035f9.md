caption: 'Proposed model for the roles of Sos-1 in the signaling pathway leading to
  activation of Rac. Under unstimulated conditions (unstimulated), Sos-1-based complexes,
  PI3K, and the small GTPases, Ras and Rac, are present in the cell in an inactive
  state. Immediately after stimulation (Stimulated: early events) by growth factor
  (G.F.), the S/G complex is recruited to the activated RTK at the plasma membrane,
  leading to Ras activation. GTP-loaded Ras, in turn, mediates signal propagation
  with the ensuing activation of Rac, through the trimeric complex S/E/E8 (dashed
  black arrow). In this pathway, PI3K, which binds to GTP-Ras, plays a key role, although
  it cannot be formally excluded that other Ras effectors may participate in the activation
  of Rac. Activation of Rac can also be achieved through Ras-independent pathways,
  among which the one involving the direct recruitment of PI3K to activated RTK (dashed
  orange arrow). All these pathways converge on the S/E/E8 Rac GEF complex. Activated
  Rac finally mediates actin remodelling. Concomitantly, activated Ras leads to stimulation
  of the ERK kinase via the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade (solid red arrow). ERK can phosphorylate
  Sos-1 (dashed green arrow) with ensuing reduced affinity for Grb2, but not for E3b1.
  This results (Stimulated: late events) in the disassembly of the RTK-Grb2-Sos-1
  complex contributing to the termination of Ras activation. Conversely, the trimeric
  complex S/E/E8 is stable, thus allowing sustained Rac activation through Ras-independent
  pathways (dashed orange arrow), which are most likely PI3K dependent, but could
  also be PI3K dependent.'
