caption: Proposed mechanism for the CD8+-cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication.
  Illustrated is a model for the CD8+ cell noncytotoxic anti-HIV response (CNAR).
  Upon recognition of a cognate antigen presented in the context of HLA class I by
  HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells, a signal is transduced via the T cell receptor (TCR)
  complex on memory CD8+ T cells (Killian and others ) that elicit the secretion of
  type I IFN. The secreted IFN binds to the IFN receptor (IFNAR2) on the CD4+ target
  cell, and the subsequent interaction with IFNAR1 activates the JAK/STAT pathway
  and promotes the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. This activity induces the upregulation
  of multiple IFN-responsive genes, including 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)
  and ribonuclease L (RNase L), which can have downstream inhibitory effects on HIV-1
  transcription and virus replication.
