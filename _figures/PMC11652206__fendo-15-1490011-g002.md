caption: 'Mechanisms by which phthalates affected sex steroids-related pathways. During
  the development of offspring, DBP caused abnormal testicular structure. DBP and
  DEHP hindered testosterone synthesis and androgen signaling through various mechanisms,
  such as downregulating key enzymes involved in androgen synthesis, antagonizing
  AR, and reducing TGFB1I1 expression to inhibit nuclear translocation. This impaired
  androgen pathway may subsequently inhibit the expression of androgen-related genes.
  Simultaneously, DEHP and DBP also activated estrogen signaling by promoting the
  expression of ERβ and ERα, respectively. ARE: Androgen response element. (Solid
  arrows represent mechanisms that have been demonstrated in the included studies).
  Dashed arrows indicate that mechanisms were proposed but were not experimentally
  validated in the included studies. Diamond-shaped icons represent the mechanisms
  that have been validated in vitro experiment in the included studies)'
