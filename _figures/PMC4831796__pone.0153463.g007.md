caption: (A) When ARSB activity is normal, the 4-sulfate group at the non-reducing
  end of the C4S chain is removed from C4S and the binding of SHP2 to C4S is not increased.
  Hence, SHP2 can remove tyrosine phosphate from p38. (B) When ARSB is reduced and
  chondroitin 4-sulfation is increased, SHP2 binding to C4S is increased and SHP2
  activity is reduced. There is inhibition of removal of tyrosine phosphate from p38,
  leading to increased phosphorylation of p38 and of MITF, leading to activation of
  the GPNMB promoter. [ARSB = arylsulfatase B; C4S = chondroitin 4-sulfate; GPNMB
  = glycoprotein (transmembrane) NMB; MITF = microphthalmia-associated transcription
  factor; P = phosphate; S = sulfate]
