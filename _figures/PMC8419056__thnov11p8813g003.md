caption: 'Crosstalk in immune responses induced by pyroptotic cell death. Cytokines
  (e.g., IL-1β and IL-18) and DAMPs (e.g., HMGB1 and ATP) can be released through
  pyroptotic cell death. IL-1β promotes antigen presentation between dendritic cells
  and T lymphocytes and drives the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes toward
  a Th17 phenotype. Castano et al. suggested that IL-1β can inhibit MET in metastatic
  breast cancer cells by inducing the expression of ZEB1. IL-18 interacts with IL-18
  receptors on immune cells, such as NK cells and Th1 cells, further inducing the
  generation of IFN-γ. In addition, IL-18 reportedly drives NK cells to DC-like cells
  through the upregulation of MHC-II and costimulatory molecules. IFN-γ exerts several
  effects on the activation of the immune response: it can block immunosuppressive
  cytokines, such as TGF-β and IL-10 secreted by Tregs; it can promote the activation
  and proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) through the upregulation of
  granzyme B; it can drive naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes toward a Th1 phenotype; and it
  can upregulate MHC-II molecules on tumor cells. Furthermore, Zhou et al. indicated
  that IFN-γ upregulates GSDMB in several cancer cell lines, leading to pyroptosis
  mediated by granzyme A. HMGB1 can upregulate MHC-II molecules on dendritic cells
  and promote their migration. Moreover, it can induce the secretion of tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) from macrophages by interacting with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).'
