caption: The effects of specific versus general oxidants on the astrocytic thiol-based
  redox metabolism. (a) Pathway for thiol-based redox metabolism. PPG, SAS, AβH, Aza,
  ACV, and MK-571 are inhibitors of γ-cystathionase, γ-glutamylcysteinyl synthetase,
  the xC- transporter, the XAG- transporter, ASC neutral amino acid transporter, γ-glutamyl
  transpeptidase (γGT), and the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), respectively.
  (b) Differences in the redox responses elicited by Aβ versus t-BuOOH. Green lines
  and fonts denote metabolites or activities that increase in response to acute or
  repeated treatment conditions; blue denotes a decrease under acute and repeated
  Aβ but not t-BuOOH treatment conditions, and red denotes a decrease only with repeated
  Aβ treatment. Black lines and text represent denote parameters in which no changes
  were observed. (c) Scheme showing the treatment regimens for acute versus repeated
  exposure to Aβ or t-BuOOH. Aβ, amyloid beta; AβH, aspartate-β-hydroxamate; ACV,
  acivicin; Aza, azaserine; PPG, propargylglycine; t-BuOOH, tertiary-butylhydroperoxide;
  SAS, sulfasalazine.
