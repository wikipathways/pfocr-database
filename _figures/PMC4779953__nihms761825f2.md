caption: 'The REM-off region is represented by the vlPAG and LPT, and the REM-on region
  is represented by the PC and SLD. The SLD (or analogous nucleus in humans) +/− PC
  projects to spinal interneurons (“direct route,” denoted by the line from SLD/PC
  to spinal interneurons) and likely represents the final common pathway that causes
  active inhibition of skeletal muscle activity in REM sleep. The “indirect route,”
  denoted by the line from the MCRF to the spinal interneurons, may also contribute
  to EMG atonia. Excitatory projections represented by ⊕, inhibitory projections represented
  by ⊝, with the size of these symbols representing the relative effect of each projection
  on the synapsing nuclei. The net effect of these pontomedullary influences on bulbar
  and spinal motor neurons is to actively inhibit neuronal firing during REM sleep,
  which is reflected by the absence of electromyographic (EMG) activity on polysomnography
  (PSG).Note: the abbreviations for each structure are spelled out in .'
