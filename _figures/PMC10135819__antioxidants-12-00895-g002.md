caption: Diagram illustrating RET and RET-regulated NAD+-dependent sirtuin signaling
  pathway as a contributor and potential therapeutic target for aging, age-related
  diseases, and ischemic stroke. Lack of O2 and accumulation of succinate as in ischemic
  stroke, or impairment of C-III, IV, or V as in aging and age-related diseases can
  lead to a slowdown of FET and acceleration of RET. In addition to damage by RET-generated
  ROS (RET-ROS), RET-induced drop of NAD+/NADH ratio can compromise the NAD+-dependent
  sirtuin-FOXO-autophagy signaling pathway and contribute to general aging, age-related
  diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration, and stroke.
