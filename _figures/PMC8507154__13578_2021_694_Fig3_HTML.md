caption: NGF and BDNF signaling pathways inside neuronal cells. After NGF binding
  to the TrkA receptor, several signaling pathways and down-stream effectors are activated.
  In this cascade, the activation of the PI3K/AKT complex regulates cholinergic differentiation.
  Further, the promotion of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis inhibits the autophagic response.
  In parallel, the activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3 complex leads to neurite expansion.
  Along with these changes, the formation of the NGF/ERK/CREB complex improves learning
  and memory function. In contrast to NGF, BDNF binds to type B Trk. This attachment
  recruits the PLC/PKC increases synaptic activity and plasticity. In this molecular
  pathway, BDNF could inhibit the BIM and reduce apoptotic response in the neurons.
  Further, the regulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis regulates protein synthesis and
  PSD-95 trafficking into the synapses. The BDNF/TrkB improves neuronal survival through
  Erk5/Mef pathway. The neurite outgrowth is controlled via BDNF/TrkB/JAK/STAT pathway
