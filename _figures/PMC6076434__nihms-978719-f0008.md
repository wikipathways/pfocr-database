caption: 'A schematic view of pathways regulating IL-1α expression in hRPE cells.
  LPS induced IL-1α expression is mediated by two signal pathways: the TLR4 receptor
  pathway and the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. After stimulation with LPS,
  TLR4 binds the sorting adaptor TIRAP, forming an early-acting TIRAP/MyD88 complex,
  which activates NF-kB, leading to IL-1α expression. An alternative pathway, also
  involving TIRAP/MyD88, appears to mediate pro-IL-1α expression through TRL2 binding
  by its agonist, PAM3CSK4. However, the pro-inflammatory response by LPS is subject
  to negative regulation by PI3K, which stimulates dissociation and degradation of
  TIRAP and triggers a late-acting anti-inflammatory phase (dotted line), in which
  TLR4 recruits the TRIF/TRAM complex and induces endosomal-internalization. In this
  process, LPS may also to be internalized. The intracellular [LPS]in, as with ER-stress
  and IFNs, mediates non-canonical activation of the inflammasome leading to production
  of IL-1α. The roles of calcium-dependent calpain in IL-1α production may be due
  to its stimulation of IκBα degradation, which promotes pro-IL-1α maturation. The
  inflammasome-mediated release of IL-1β further induces IL-1α expression via an autocrine
  mechanism. The numbers represent corresponding references: 1 (; ); 2 (); 3 (); 4
  (); 5 (); 6 (); 7 (); 8 ().'
