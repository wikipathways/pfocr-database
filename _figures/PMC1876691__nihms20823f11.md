caption: 6-OHDA treatment results in cytoplasmic accumulation of pCREB accompanied
  by repression of CRE-mediated transcription and decreased expression of BDNF and
  Bcl-2. Previous studies have also demonstrated accumulation of pERK and pRSK in
  the cytoplasm of 6-OHDA-injured cells and human Parkinson disease neurons (), suggesting
  a deficit in nuclear localization of activated signaling proteins. Administration
  of cAMP bypasses the effects of 6-OHDA on CRE-mediated transcription, conferring
  significant protection if administered prior to the initiation of cell lysis. Interestingly,
  other studies have shown that inhibition of nuclear import blocks CRE activation
  elicited by the ERK-RSK pathway, but cAMP-PKA-mediated CRE activation occurs independently
  of active nuclear import (, ). Given increasing reports of signaling proteins and
  transcription factors accumulating in the cytoplasm of degenerating neurons (, ),
  strategies to bypass potential translocation deficits may prove promising.
