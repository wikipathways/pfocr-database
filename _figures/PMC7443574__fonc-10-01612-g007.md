caption: Working model for circHIPK3 in HRGC cells. Under a long-term hypoxic microenvironment
  of gastric cancer, circHIPK3 was upregulated by HIF-2α; then circHIPK3 upregulated
  NRP1 by sponging with miR-653-3p and miR-338-3p followed by relieving the transcriptional
  suppress of NRP1; finally, NRP1 promoted metastasis by activating ERK and AKT pathway.
