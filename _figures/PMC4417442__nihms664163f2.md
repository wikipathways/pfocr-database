caption: In contrast to cell-free virus infection, the virological synapse can promote
  the entry of multiple HIV virions into target cells [, , , ]. Virus fusion events
  can be sensed as danger signals (depicted here as red stars) due to the release
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of phospholipase C gamma 1-phosphoinositide
  3-kinase pathway (PLC-γ–PI(3)K pathway), which stimulates the release of Ca2+ culminating
  in stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-dependent Type I interferon (IFN) production
  []. *While the contribution of endocytosis to productive HIV entry remains highly
  controversial [–], it has been best documented in studies of HIV transmitted via
  cell-cell contacts [, , –]. Endocytosis of virions, their transfer to lysosome related
  organelles and subsequent lysis, releases viral RNA contents that can be sensed
  by TLR7 and TLR8 []. TLR7- and TLR8-sensing results in the synthesis of IFN and
  the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β respectively [, , ]. Fusion at the plasma membrane
  or from mature endosomes releases viral capsids into the host cytosol [, ]. The
  released capsids can also be delivered to the lysosome-related organelle by autophagy
  to be sensed by TLR7/8 []. In addition, TRIM5α in the host cytosol senses viral
  capsid as ‘foreign’, inducing IFN and accelerating capsid disassembly [, ]. In contrast,
  cyclophilinA (CypA) and cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 6 (CPSF6) may
  act as ‘cloaking’ factors to prevent premature exposure and sensing of viral RNA
  and reverse transcription (RT) products []. Premature disassembly of viral capsids
  can release the RNA contents of the virus and can be potentially sensed by the cytoplasmic
  RNA sensor retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) to elicit IFN production []. The
  next step of reverse transcription of viral RNA is repressed by APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein
  B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G) packed within the incoming
  virions or SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) present in the
  host cytosol [, ]. SAMHD1 is thought to deplete the nucleotide pool and elevates
  the generation of incomplete RT products. SAMHD1 was also recently reported to have
  direct RNase activity against incoming HIV RNA []. The DNA sensor, IFI16 can sense
  abortive RT products to induce IFN as well as activate caspase-1 and IL-1β, triggering
  pyroptosis and cell death [, , ]. In contrast, the exonuclease TREX1 can degrade
  excess RT products and prevent sensing of viral DNA []. Viral DNA can also be sensed
  by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) to generate cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine
  monophosphate (cGAMP) that activates the STING-dependent IFN pathway []. Pre-integration
  complexes (PICs) generated at the end of RT reaction are transported into the nucleus
  through nuclear pore complex, a step that is inhibited by IFN-inducible factor MX2
  [, ]. PICs mediate integration of HIV DNA into the host chromosome. Multiple double
  stranded DNA breaks and strand transfer reactions into the host chromosomal DNA
  can elicit a DNA damage response pathway that leads to phosphorylation of gamma
  histone 2AX (H2AX) and activation of p53 and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)
  to trigger apoptosis and cell death [].
