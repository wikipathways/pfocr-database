caption: Proposed model for the regulation of ste11+ expression by Rcd1 and other
  known factors. Rcd1 is required for ste11+ induction in response to nitrogen starvation
  and Pat1+s inactivation. In addition to ste11+ induction, Rcd1 controls differentiation
  via a mechanism independent of ste11+ regulation, which is not shown here because
  of ignorance of its molecular target. The Wis1-Sty1/Phh1 stress signal pathway ()
  positively regulates ste11+ expression, and the cAMP-Pka1 pathway () and Pac2 ()
  negatively regulate ste11+ expression. In addition, the Ste11 molecule positively
  autoregulates its own expression ().
