caption: Model depicting how the COP1-SPA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex in C. reinhardtii
  controls the light regulation of qE gene expression through the transcriptional
  regulator CrCO. In low light, ubiquitination of CrCO by the COP1-SPA1 E3 ubiquitin
  ligase targets CrCO for degradation. The low level of CrCO that persists in low
  light activates low levels of transcription from the qE genes (LHCSR1, LHCSR3.1,
  LHCSR3.2, PSBS1, and PSBS2). In high light, a photoreceptor-mediated signal inhibits
  the COP1-SPA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase by an undefined mechanism, allowing accumulation
  of CrCO and its binding to the CO-like binding motif and transcriptional activation
  of the qE gene promoters. In addition, to explain the high-light induction of qE
  gene expression in the crco and crco spa1-1 mutants () we hypothesize the existence
  of a second transcriptional regulator bound to the qE gene promoters that mediates
  a SPA1/CrCO-independent but high-light-dependent regulatory pathway. Whether this
  pathway constitutes a second photoreceptor-mediated pathway, possibly integrated
  with a chloroplast retrograde signaling pathway, is unknown.
