caption: The regulation of metabolic pathway in immune cells. a The activation of
  mTORC1 induced by various factors (cytokines, glucose and oxygen, etc.) up-regulates
  PD-L1 expression, and inhibits the Treg cells, NK cells and T cell infiltration.
  In addition, the growth factors-induced mTORC2 activation could increase AKT expression
  and affect the glutamine metabolism, ultimately causing the ICIs (immune checkpoint
  inhibitors) resistance and promote the cancer growth and development. b AMPK activation
  enhances the uptake of fatty acids and glucose via FAT/CD36 and GLUT4 respectively.
  Meanwhile, the activation of AMPK increases the fatty acids oxidation and oxidative
  phosphorylation in mitochondria to elevate the intracellular ATP level. Ultimately,
  these alterations commonly affect the functions of immune cells, such as inhibiting
  Treg cells differentiation and function, decreasing CD4+ T cell activity, inducing
  MDSC cells (marrow-derived suppressor cells) and elevating the secretion of IL-17,
  IL-1, and IL-18, which ultimately lead to the immunosuppression
