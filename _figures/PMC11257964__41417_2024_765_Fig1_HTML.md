caption: Pro-apoptotic (e.g., BAX, BAK, Bid) and anti-apoptotic factors (e.g., BCL-2,
  BCL-XL, MCL-1) control the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. When only BH3 proteins are
  activated in the pro-apoptotic members, BAX and BAK induce MOMP, leading to the
  release of Cyc.C and the formation of an apoptosome with Apaf-1, which in turn activates
  caspase-9. The extrinsic pathway, mediated mainly by death receptors and their ligands,
  results in the formation of the DISC, which activates pro-caspase-8. A cascade of
  apoptotic processes is triggered by the activation of downstream caspase-3 and -7
  by both caspase-8 and -9. In the classical pathway of pyroptosis, inflammatory sensors,
  such as NLRP3, recruit ASC upon various stimuli to promote pro-caspase-1 activation,
  thereby further facilitating the assembly of the inflammasome and the activation
  of caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD and pro-caspase-1, which forms the
  GSDMD pore and promotes the release of inflammatory factors. The nonclassical pathway
  involves LPS in the cytoplasm, activating caspase-4/5/11 and cleaving GSDMD to initiate
  pyroptosis. Necroptosis typically involves the TNF signaling pathway. Complex I,
  composed of TRADD, TRAF2, RIPK1, the cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (cIAPs), and
  the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), can promote NF-кB signaling.
  After that, FADD and TRADD are recruited to form complex IIa with caspase-8 and
  RIPK1. When caspase-8 is inhibited, RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL are phosphorylated successively,
  resulting in the formation of the necrosome (complex III). The MLKL pore is formed
  when MLKL oligomerizes and moves to the plasma
