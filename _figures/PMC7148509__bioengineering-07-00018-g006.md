caption: Schematic model for MMP24 expression promoted by extracellular matrix (ECM)
  stiffening. Integrins bind to ECM and induce the formation of focal adhesions, leading
  to actin polymerization via the activation of Rho GTPases such as Rho, Rac, and
  Cdc42. Rho GTPases also induce activation of myosin via activation of ROCK. Actomyosin
  contraction enhances activation of this integrin signaling pathway via conformational
  change of the proteins as mechanosensors including integrins and talin in an ECM
  stiffness-dependent manner. Increase in the number of actin filaments promotes YAP
  nuclear translocation, resulting in induction of ROCK2 and MMP24 expression via
  TEAD activation. MMP24 expression attenuates the progression of various types of
  cancers such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and renal cancer.
