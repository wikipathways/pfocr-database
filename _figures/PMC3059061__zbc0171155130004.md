caption: Schematic of principal signaling pathways involved in plasmalemmal TRPM8
  regulation. Each numbered box depicts molecular interconnection related to the specific
  signaling pathway. Box 1, PIP2 depletion pathway. PIP2 is a key lipid co-factors
  in TRPM8 activation, which depletion as a result of Gq-coupled receptor-mediated
  stimulation (PDGF receptor depicted) of PLC reduces TRPM8 functionality. Box 2,
  iPLA2/LPL pathway. The products of iPLA2 catalytic activity, LPLs, act as TRPM8
  activators; stimulation of iPLA2 and consequently enhancement of LPL production
  can be achieved by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ store depletion. Box 3, the cAMP/PKA
  pathway. Decrease of the basal level of cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation of TRPM8
  via recruitment of the α2-adrenoreceptor (α2AR)-coupled Gi/AC/cAMP/PKA pathway inhibits
  channel function; the level of cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation, and consequently,
  TRPM8 activation can be restored via the Gs/AC/cAMP/PKA pathway coupled to β-adrenoreceptor
  (βAR). Box 4, PLC/PKC pathway. The PSA can activate TRPM8 via the bradykinin receptor
  (B2R) signaling pathway involving protein kinase C (PKC) Ca2+-dependent activation
  of PKC may also indirectly contribute to the Ca2+-mediated TRPM8 channel desensitization.
  Box 5, M3 muscarinic receptor-stimulated cPLA2/AA pathway identified in this study.
  AA derived as a result of nonclassical M3 muscarinic receptor-mediated stimulation
  of cPLA2 (marked by ?) acts as a TRPM8 channel inhibitor. DAG, diacylglycerol; ISO,
  isoproterenol; PDGFR, PDGF receptor. Green circles with + and green arrows indicate
  stimulatory action, red circles with − and red arrows indicate inhibitory action;
  and a downward red arrow near PIP2 indicates decreasing of its content.
