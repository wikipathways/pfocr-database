caption: According to Yu et al. (), caveolae and Cav-1 appear to be involved in some
  of the earliest steps associated with the detection of altered shear stress conditions
  in blood vessels. In addition, the vascular response (see Figure ) is induced via
  caveolae and Cav-1, as demonstrated for several signaling pathways. Cav-1 plays
  important roles in regulating eNOS function. In unstimulated cells, eNOS is maintained
  in an inactive state through its association with Cav-1. Upon stimulation (e.g.,
  shear stress), Cav-1 and caveolae may allow for the proper organization of various
  signal transduction pathways or organize the different regulatory proteins necessary
  for rapid and efficient eNOS activation. Calcium channels and the arginine transporter
  CAT-1 are localized to caveolae and may therefore allow for efficient eNOS activation
  (Ca2+ entry and dissociation from Cav-1 in the presence of calmodulin) and availability
  of substrate. Further activation is also possible via the PI3K and Akt signaling
  pathways, which enhance NO production following eNOS phosphorylation. Activation
  of the VEGFR2 signaling pathway is critical for PI3K/Akt activation, but other pathways
  appear to also mediate MAPK activation (ERK1/2 in particular). These pathways also
  involve G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and G proteins. Shear stress is associated
  with increased oxidative stress conditions that lead to the production of ROS. Additionally,
  shear stress may affect EC interactions with extracellular matrix proteins. This
  may in turn activate integrin-mediated signaling pathways via caveolae. Src may
  also directly alter eNOS activity by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation (). Note
  that only the major affected signal transduction pathways are shown.
