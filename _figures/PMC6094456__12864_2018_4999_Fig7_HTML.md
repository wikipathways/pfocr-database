caption: Genes highly co-expressed with genes involved in catechin and theanine pathways.
  a Genes highly co-expressed with F3’5’H, FLS and βG in the catechin pathway. b Genes
  highly co-expressed with GS in the theanine pathway. Coloured circles represent
  genes, and edges represent correlations among genes
