caption: Hypothetical model of Ssk1-, Skn7-, and Hog1-mediated regulation of reproductive
  development in C. heterostrophus. Line width reflects significance of regulation.
  During vegetative growth, active Ssk1 positively regulates asexual sporulation in
  a Hog1-independent manner. During sexual reproduction, in contrast, active Ssk1
  plays a major role in balancing the spore types in a manner that favors sexual development.
  Hog1 acts downstream of Ssk1 to control asexual and sexual development during sexual
  reproduction. It appears that the Hog1 pathway is under the control of active Skn7
  as well, although Ssk1 is the predominant regulator of the pathway.
