caption: Lipid synthesis in yeast. The pathways shown for the synthesis of lipids
  include the relevant steps discussed in this work. A more comprehensive figure for
  the synthesis of TAG and membrane phospholipids via the CDP–DAG and Kennedy pathways
  may be found in Ref. . The CDP–DAG pathway of phospholipid synthesis is highlighted
  in blue, whereas the Kennedy pathway is shown in gray to indicate its minor role
  in phospholipid synthesis in cells grown without choline (Cho) or ethanolamine (Etn).
  The reactions catalyzed by the CHO1-encoded PSS, PAH1-encoded PAP, and DGK1-encoded
  DGK are indicated.
