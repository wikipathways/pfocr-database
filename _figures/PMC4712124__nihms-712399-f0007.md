caption: 'A. The estrogen receptor-dominated cell growth in estrogen-dependent cells.
  E2, estradiol. B-C. The TOB1-related signaling pathways in estrogen-independent
  cells. B: Briefly, Growth factors receptors including EGFR, ERBB family, IGF1R etc.
  activate two pathways to promote estrogen-independent cell proliferation. One is
  mediated by PI3K/AKT, which regulates translation and transcription of proliferative
  genes, and cell cycle progression, then supports estrogen-independent growth. Ras/Raf/MAPK
  mediates the second signaling pathway downstream of growth factor receptors. TOB1
  is phosphorylated by Erk1/2 to promote estrogen-independent proliferation by facilitating
  G1/S cell cycle phase transition. C: In the presence of TOB1 inhibition, up-regulation
  of p21 results in G1/S arrest. Additionally, transcription can be inhibited by TOB1
  knockdown. Reduction of CreB1 phosphorylation by TOB1 inhibition can reduce its
  proliferative target gene transcription, and then inhibit cell growth. However,
  growth factor receptors such as ERBB2 and IGFIR are activated as a reverse feedback
  mechanism, the PI3/AKT pathway is activated by TOB1 inhibition. Inhibition of AKT
  or mTOR potentiates the effects of TOB1 inhibition on cell proliferation in estrogen-independent
  cells.'
