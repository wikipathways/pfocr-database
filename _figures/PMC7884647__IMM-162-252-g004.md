caption: Role of NLRC5 in cancer immunity. NLRC5 expression is crucial for CD8+ T‐cell‐mediated
  anti‐tumor responses through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
  pathway. (a) Under normal circumstances, homeostatic immune surveillance can efficiently
  detect and eliminate cancer cells. (b) However, impaired NLRC5 expression and function
  in cancer cells can occur through multiple mechanisms such as DNA hypermethylation
  of the NLRC5 promoter, somatic mutations in the NLRC5 gene and/or chromosomal copy
  number loss of NLRC5. Subsequent down‐regulation of MHC class I antigen presentation
  allows for immune evasion and unchecked cancer growth.
