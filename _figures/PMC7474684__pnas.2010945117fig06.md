caption: Eco peptides are environmentally triggered inhibitors of Wnt signaling. Microbial
  colonization and low temperature are independent inputs for Eco peptides and are
  able to induce its transcription. Eco peptides are synthesized as small peptides,
  packed into vesicles and secreted into the extracellular matrix of the ectoderm.
  By an unknown mechanism, Eco peptides are recognized, and the Wnt signaling is inhibited.
  The inhibition takes place downstream of the β-catenin (β-cat) stabilization, presumably
  at the expression of Wnt target genes as Eco expression was able to inhibit activation
  of the pathway at the GSK-3β level after ALP treatment (see text).
