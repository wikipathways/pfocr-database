caption: 'Regulation of Pten-dependent pyrimidine metabolism by I3C in prostate of
  Pten KO mice (a) Metabolite enrichment analysis based on I3C diet in Pten KO mice.
  Color coded compounds within the pathway: light blue represents metabolites that
  are not in the data and are used as background for enrichment analysis; other colors
  (varying from yellow to red) represent the metabolites that are in the data with
  different levels of significance. (b) Expression of pyrimidine metabolism metabolites
  in prostate tissues of different experimental groups is shown as mean ± SEM. *adjusted
  p < 0.05, **adjusted p < 0.01'
