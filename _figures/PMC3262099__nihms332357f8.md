caption: Model of the host cell EGF signaling pathway and proteins downstream of the
  EGF receptor that are activated in response to C. jejuni invasion. Indicated in
  blue are components of the focal complex, (FC) and indicated in orange are other
  components that likely participate in C. jejuni internalization. C. jejuni binding
  to Fn results in integrin occupancy and clustering, which in turn, leads to integrin
  activation. The activation of EGFR and FAK then occurs through from the association
  with the tails of clustered β1 integrins. Activated FAK autophosphorylates Tyr397,
  resulting in association of c-Src. c-Src phosphorylates additional residues within
  FAK as well as other members of the FC, including paxillin and p130Cas. This activation
  results in the recruitment of CrkII and Dock180, the latter of which associates
  with ELMO to expose its catalytic domain. The Dock180/ELMO complex activates the
  Rho family monomeric G protein Rac1, leading to a local restructuring of the actin
  cytoskeleton.
