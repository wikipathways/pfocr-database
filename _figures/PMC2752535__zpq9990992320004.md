caption: Common features of host-Flaviviridae interactions. (A) Common network modules
  for HCV-dependency factors identified in siRNA screens for Flaviviridae. The network
  was generated using first-order (direct) interactions between siRNA hits from HCV,
  WNV, and dengue virus screens to identify common functional modules potentially
  used by Flaviviridae. Network clusters obtained were examined for enrichment (P
  < 0.05) in KEGG signaling pathways. (B and C) Common network modules for HCV host
  factors identified in the HCVcc and HCV replicon siRNA screens. (B) Network cluster
  generated using second order interactions for overlapping siRNA hits reveals a significant
  enrichment for the TGF-β-signaling pathway (P = 5 × 10−10). (C) First order interactions
  identify connections between HCV replicon screen hits and a number of TGF-β- and
  VEGF pathway-associated siRNA hits from the HCVcc screen. Other binary or triple-member
  connections include subunits (BCKDHA and BCKDHB) of the branched chain keto acid
  dehydrogenase E1 enzyme complex, and components (TRRAP and YEATS4) of the NuA4 histone
  acetyltransferase complex.
