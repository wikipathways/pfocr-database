caption: Caspofungin-induced CWD regulation by Cas5. Following caspofungin-induced
  CWD, Cas5 is activated via an unknown regulatory pathway involving dephosphorylation
  by Glc7. Cytoplasmic Cas5 then translocates into the nucleus to activate transcription.
  In the nucleus, Cas5 interacts with the SBF complex proteins Swi4 and Swi6 to activate
  transcription of Cas5-dependent genes. Note that the Cas5 DNA-binding motif is currently
  unknown. Cas5-dependent gene activation leads to the upregulation of genes involved
  in cell wall biogenesis/integrity and cellular metabolism, and the downregulation
  of genes involved in cell cycle progression. Dotted arrows represent unknown or
  hypothetical processes, while solid arrows indicate confirmed relationships and
  processes. This figure was adapted from  and  and created with BioRender. com
