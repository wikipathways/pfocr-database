caption: Repair of inter-strand DNA cross links can involve both Fanconi anaemia (FANC)
  and breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA) proteins. When the replication machinery
  encounters cross-linked DNA, replication fork stalling and/or collapsing occurs
  (1). This type of replication stress might signal for the monoubiquitylation of
  FANCD2–FANCI and its consequent association with chromatin, which is mediated by
  the Fanconi anaemia core complex (FANCA–FANCC, FANCE–FANCG, FANCL and FANCM) (2).
  It is thought that the Fanconi anaemia core and FANCD2–FANCI may be involved in
  the repair or removal of DNA cross links. Subsequently, the BRCA1 core complex (BRCA1,
  BRCA2 (also known as FANCD1), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2; also known
  as FANCN) and BRCA1-interacting protein carboxy-terminal helicase 1 (BACH1; also
  known as FANCJ and BRIP1)) would be loaded onto sites of DNA damage (3). This would
  facilitate the accumulation and nucleation of RAD51 filaments (4), ultimately leading
  to the repair of inter-strand DNA cross links and the subsequent reinitiation of
  DNA replication (5).
