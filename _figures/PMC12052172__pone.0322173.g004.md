caption: Annotated genes in eccDNAs were used for pathway enrichment analysis. Each
  enriched pathway was represented as a node. Connected nodes indicated that they
  shared at least one gene from enrichment analysis. (Yellow = contained only CCA-derived
  genes, Blue = contained only MMNK1-derived genes, Green = contained both CCA and
  MMNK1 derived genes)
