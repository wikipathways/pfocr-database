caption: A) Transcription factors p53 and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) can activate
  the transcription of small heterodimer partner (SHP) which inhibits 7-α-hydroxylase
  (Cyp7A1), the first enzyme in the BA synthesis pathway. Liver X receptor (LXR) can
  activate transcriptionally Cyp7A1 to produce more BA. B) The Western diet (WD) activated
  transcription of LXR in WT mice in association with increased Cyp7A1 gene expression.
  Lower p53 expression in p53+/− mice is associated with lower gene expression of
  SHP. While no difference is seen in FXR and LXR, Cyp7A1 gene expression and BA levels
  are elevated.
