caption: 'Pattern Recognition Receptors are involved in regulating DNA damage repair
  processes. Left, The cGAS sensor can inhibit DNA Damage Responses (DDR) via two
  distinct mechanisms in human cells: 1) cGAS inhibits the Homologous Recombination
  (HR) pathway by preventing displacement loop (D-loop) formation. 2) cGAS-PARP1 interaction
  impedes the formation of a PARP1-based complex required for HR-mediated DNA repair.
  Right, STING promotes DDR in human cells through a yet to be elucidated molecular
  mechanism, but may rely on the control of components of the Non-Homologous End Joining
  DNA repair pathway, such as the DNA-PK complex. Dashed arrow between STING and DNA-PK
  represents the reported interaction between the two proteins (, , ). Whether this
  interaction is related to STING-associated DDR control is unknown.'
