caption: Diagram of the effects of HIC and I-mfa on Axin-mediated signaling. (A) Effects
  on the Wnt Pathway. (Top panel) In the absence of HIC or I-mfa, Axin binds free
  β-catenin or β-catenin that is released from E-cadherin and promotes phosphorylation
  of β-catenin by GSK-3β and β-catenin degradation. TCF- or LEF-mediated transcription
  is not activated. (Middle panel) In the presence of HIC, the Axin-mediated decrease
  in the free β-catenin level is inhibited due to effects on Axin complex formation
  or GSK-3β activity. Axin inhibition of β-catenin activation of TCF- or LEF-mediated
  transcription is decreased. (Bottom panel) In the presence of I-mfa, the Axin-mediated
  decrease in the free β-catenin level is inhibited, and β-catenin activation of TCF-
  or LEF-mediated transcription is inhibited. (B) Effects on the JNK pathway. (Top
  panel) In the absence of GSK-3β, Axin binds MEKK, leading to activation of the JNK
  pathway. (Middle panel) HIC binding to Axin does not affect the binding of GSK-3β,
  and the activation of JNK is decreased. (Bottom panel) I-mfa binding to Axin does
  not affect the binding of GSK-3β, and the activation of JNK is decreased.
