caption: 'The role and mechanisms of action of PGRN (Progranulin) and its derivative
  Atsttrin in disease pathogenesis. (A) KO-PGRN not only directly contributes to neurodegenerative
  disorders such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis,
  and Alzheimer’s disease, but also induces neuroinflammation, cellular apoptosis,
  axonal damage, astroglial hyperplasia, and neuronal death through inflammatory responses.
  This cascade mechanism predisposes individuals to cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion
  injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and acute ischaemic stroke. Furthermore, PGRN
  plays a significant role in immune-inflammatory pathologies including rheumatoid
  arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and systemic lupus erythematosus
  by modulating the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg
  subsets. Additionally, PGRN mediates multiple signalling pathways - including PI3K/AKT,
  ERK1/2, PKC, C-myc, MAPK, AKT/mTOR, and PGRN/JAK/STAT/PD-1/PD-L1 - thereby influencing
  the progression of various malignancies such as colorectal carcinoma, osteosarcoma,
  ovarian cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and breast cancer. (B) Furthermore, PGRN exerts
  protective effects against OA by suppressing cartilage degradation through endoplasmic
  reticulum stress, epigenetic regulation, and autophagy. PGRN also maintains mitochondrial
  homeostasis and inhibits cellular apoptosis via autophagy, thereby demonstrating
  protective functions in DN. Through inflammatory responses, PGRN exhibits dual regulatory
  roles: while directly promoting DN progression and suppressing IDD and DOP, it concurrently
  protects against OA and CP by inhibiting cartilage degradation and enhancing bone
  formation. Additionally, PGRN modulates the inflammation-bone coupling axis to suppress
  inflammatory reactions and promote osteogenesis, consequently inhibiting the development
  of RA, DOP, OP, and IDD. By regulating OB-OC equilibrium, PGRN inhibits bone resorption
  while stimulating bone formation, thereby conferring protection against CP and OP.
  (C) Finally, the PGRN derivative Atsttrin demonstrates therapeutic potential through
  dual mechanisms: it promotes anabolic processes and cartilage repair in OA, RA,
  and IDD by activating the TNFR2-Akt-ERK1/2 pathway while suppressing inflammatory
  responses and catabolic activity. Concurrently, Atsttrin enhances bone formation,
  inhibits OC differentiation, and modulates OB-OC balance, offering protective effects
  against bone destructive disorders and pathologies involving bone homeostasis dysregulation'
