caption: Proposed function of HadDMtb in the mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway of
  M. tuberculosis. FAS-II first catalyzes several series of early elongation cycles
  involving HadAB dehydratase, and punctuated by the introduction of two double bonds
  potentially leading to the biosynthesis of diethylenic precursors. These double
  bonds are modified into the appropriate chemical functions (cis/trans cyclopropane,
  methoxy, keto) by dedicated MA-methyltransferases that differentiate the pathways
  of the three main MA classes. The Claisen-type condensation of the resulting dicyclopropyl
  meromycoloyl chains with a carboxy-fatty acyl-CoA by the mycolic condensation system
  generates the trehalose α-MA esters. The formation of the main methoxy- and keto-MAs,
  whose meromycolic chain is longer, requires an additional set of FAS-II late elongation
  cycles, which specifically involve HadBC and HadDMtb dehydratases during the methoxy-MA
  and keto-MA biosyntheses, respectively. HadBC and HadDMtb functions would partially
  overlap. The corresponding mature MAs are then generated by the mycolic condensation
  system. The total carbon number of the meromycolic and MA chains are indicated.
