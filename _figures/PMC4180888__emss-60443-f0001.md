caption: Hypothesised mechanism by which the tetrapeptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyly-lysyl-proline
  (Ac-SDKP) inhibits fibrosisAc-SDKP is generated from the G actin binding peptide,
  thymosin β4, by prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) through one-step enzymatic cleavge.
  Angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) hydrolyses Ac-SDKP into inactive dipeptides.
  ACE inhibitors (ACEi) increase the concentration of Ac-SDKP whereas POP inhibitors
  (POPi) decrease AcSDKP production. Ac-SDKP prevents the galectin-3 induced effect
  on fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad2 signaling pathway. Ac-SDKP may also inhibit
  fibrosis directly by blocking collagen synthesis.
