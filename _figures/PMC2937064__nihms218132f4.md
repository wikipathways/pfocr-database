caption: Reactive oxygen species, UV light or other genotoxic stresses, that induce
  DNA damage, principally, double-stranded breaks, is detected by the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1
  complex, which in turn activates ATM. A key substrate of ATM is p53. ATM phosphorylates
  p53 leading to its stabilization and activation. ATM also phosphorylates the E3
  ubiquitin ligase MDM2 at the Ser395 residue, which inhibits ubiquitinization and
  degradation of p53. One key function of p53 is to inhibit cell cycle and promote
  apoptosis. A second key function is p53 can inhibit expression of an IGF-1 receptor
  (IGF-1R), while at the same time increasing expression of IGFBP-3, which decreases
  IGF-1 signaling. A third key function is to induce cell cycle arrest to enable DNA
  repair. AKT can also phosphorylate MDM2 at the Ser166 and Ser186 residue which blocks
  the effect of ATM phosphorylation of p53, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis.
  Thus, appropriate regulation of DNA damage can lead to inhibition of the growth
  hormone signaling pathway and this leads to lower oxidative stress. Thus, limitation
  of DNA damage by low ROS and control of DNA repair by several mechanisms can promote
  healthy immune aging.
