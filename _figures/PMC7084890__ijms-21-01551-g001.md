caption: Endocrine therapy targeting estrogen and androgen receptors. (A) Estrogen
  receptor (ER) dimerizes and forms a complex with co-regulators after binding to
  estrogen, leading to the transcriptional regulation of ER target genes. Selective
  estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and selective estrogen receptor degraders or
  down-regulators (SERDs) are utilized in endocrine therapy. SERMs modulate ER activity,
  whereas SERDs mediate the degradation of ER, abolishing ER signaling pathway. (B)
  Androgen binding and subsequent androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcriptional
  regulation. AR antagonists and selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) compete
  with androgen and modulate AR activity. Selective androgen receptor degraders or
  down-regulators (SARDs) promote AR degradation. ERE—estrogen response element. ARE—androgen
  response element.
