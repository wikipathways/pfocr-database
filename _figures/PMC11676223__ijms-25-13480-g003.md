caption: The figure depicts the capacity of irisin to affect multiple pathways involved
  in age-associated neurodegeneration and mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. Irisin
  serves as a crucial link between muscle contraction, myokine secretion, and brain
  function, embodying the concept of the muscle–brain axis. It has been shown to have
  potent (1) anti-inflammatory and (2) neuroprotective effects, such as protecting
  against Aβ neurotoxicity, reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like
  IL-1β and IL-6, and inhibiting the expression of COX-2 and NF-κB in astrocytes.
  Irisin’s neuroprotective actions extend to preventing neuronal damage in conditions
  like middle cerebral artery occlusion and brain infarction, as well as mitigating
  microglial activation, neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of TNF-α and
  IL-6 via the ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways. Additionally, it counters the TLR4/MyD88-mediated
  neuroinflammatory response. The integrin αV/β5 receptor, which is highly expressed
  in microglia, plays a key role in irisin’s effects. Irisin has been shown to promote
  the shift from an M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype to an M2-like anti-inflammatory
  phenotype in microglia, leading to changes in their morphology. This shift is associated
  with an increase in AMPK phosphorylation and the expression of the anti-apoptotic
  protein Bcl-2. The interaction between irisin and BDNF signaling is also essential
  in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD). For example,
  FNDC5 overexpression can mitigate the inhibitory effects of Aβ1-42 oligomers on
  BDNF expression. Exercise has been linked to increased (3) lactate levels and elevated
  hippocampal BDNF expression, with SIRT1 histone deacetylase activating the PGC-1α/FNDC5
  signaling pathway to induce BDNF expression. Irisin’s (3) antidepressant potential
  is particularly relevant for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD. Its ability
  to enhance dopaminergic activity (i.e., right side of the figure) may help address
  the pathophysiology of depression. Specifically, irisin-induced BDNF expression
  can activate dopamine D3 receptor-mediated signaling through the Akt and ERK pathways,
  fine-tuning dopamine release and contributing to a reduction in Aβ deposits and
  the overall Aβ burden
