caption: 'Schematic representation of the dysregulation in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
  system caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Renin
  converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin I (Ang I). Angiotensin-converting enzyme
  (ACE) converts Ang I into angiotensin II (Ang II), which binds to its receptors
  Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R). Ang II exerts most
  of its harmful cardiovascular effects through the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis. Usually,
  the major part of Ang II is converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
  to become Ang 1-7, which activates the Mas receptor signaling pathway with protective
  effects in the microcirculatory environment. In coronavirus disease 2019, after
  the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2, its intracellular binding site
  down-regulates ACE2. Disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein
  17 (ADAM17), cleaving the ACE2 terminal, also contributes to the negative regulation
  of ACE2 by spreading it along with the attached virus through bloodstream. The down-regulation
  of ACE2 culminates in Ang II upregulation, corroborating to a pro-inflammatory milieu.
  The kallikrein-kinin system is intensively interwoven with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
  system through many pathways with complex reciprocal interaction metabolites, especially
  des-Arg9 bradykinin (DABK). ACE2 cleaves terminal residue of DABK, resulting in
  its deactivation. The derangement ACE2/DABK/bradykinin B1 receptor (BKB-1R) axis
  activation creates a proinflammatory synergistic effect for SARS-CoV-2 in association
  with ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis activation. The complement system is activated both by
  the Ang II/ACE2 axis and by recognizing SARS-CoV-2 by pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs). The interaction of ACE2 with the coagulation system is indirect and occurs
  by inhibiting fibrinolysis. In this context, the NF-κB pathway receives stimuli
  along three different axes: Ang II/AT1R, DABK/BKB-1R, and SARS-CoV-2/PRRs/complement.
  NF-κB hyperactivation then promotes a positive feedback cycle between cytokine storm,
  endothelial dysfunction, and tissue damage in the microcirculatory environment.
