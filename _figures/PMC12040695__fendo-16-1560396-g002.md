caption: Collagen-mediated pathways in type 2 diabetes mellitus–related sarcopenia.
  In a healthy state, normal collagen levels allow for efficient delivery of insulin
  and glucose to the muscle, maintaining a healthy muscle state. Binding of insulin
  to its receptor and activation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) phosphorylation
  subsequently recruit and activate phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase
  B (Akt), which facilitates the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane and increases
  the efficiency of glucose uptake by muscle. Akt then activates or inhibits multiple
  downstream targets. For instance, Akt activates the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) to promote protein synthesis and inhibits forkhead box protein O (FOXO),
  which inhibits its downstream E3 ubiquitin ligases muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx)
  and muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF-1), thereby inhibiting protein degradation. In addition,
  Akt promotes myogenic differentiation of satellite cells by activating myogenic
  differentiation regulators such as myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD). In T2DM, collagen
  deposition increases the distance of the diffusion path for glucose and insulin,
  reduces the binding efficiency of insulin to receptors, inhibits the IRS1/PI3K/Akt
  pathway, and impedes the transport of GLUT4 to the cell membrane, which reduces
  muscle uptake and utilization of glucose. Akt subsequently activates or inhibits
  multiple downstream targets. mTOR is inhibited, inhibiting protein synthesis, and
  FOXO is activated, promoting MAFbx and MuRF-1 expression, which accelerates protein
  degradation. In addition, myogenic differentiation regulatory factors such as MyoD
  are inhibited, thereby inhibiting myogenic differentiation of satellite cells. Collagen
  deposition can also cause impaired mitochondrial function and increased ROS levels,
  which not only inhibit the insulin signaling pathway but also activate members of
  the FOXO family and their downstream E3 ubiquitin ligases, thereby accelerating
  protein degradation. Muscle loss can also cause continued collagen production through
  inflammatory and fibrotic pathways
