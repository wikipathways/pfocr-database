caption: Innate immunity activation due to mutations in mitochondrial factors is mediated
  in the cytosol via the cGAS/STING pathway (when accumulated and possibly fragmented
  mtDNA is extruded to the cytosol) or the DDX58/IFIH1/MAVS sensors in the pattern
  recognition RLR pathway (when accumulated mitochondrial double-strand RNA is extruded).
  They stimulate the nuclear induction of interferon type I signaling. It is unclear
  if these established mechanisms also are prominent in ClpP-deficient cells, or additional
  pattern recognition receptors (TLR, NLR) and other cytosolic sensors play a relevant
  role. MRG, mitochondrial ribosomal granule; VDAC, PORIN; DDX58, RIG-I; IFIH1, MDA-5;
  STING, STING1, also known as TMEM173; ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element

  database
