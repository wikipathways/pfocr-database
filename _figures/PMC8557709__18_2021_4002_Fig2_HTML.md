caption: Interactions of leptin and ghrelin with the endocannabinoid system (ECS)
  in hypothalamic neurons. Peripheral-derived hormones such as leptin and ghrelin
  stimulate specific areas of the hypothalamus that coordinate the energy balance.
  The ECS is emerging as an important integrator in these signaling pathway. (a) Leptin
  acts in parvocellular neuroendocrine cells of the paraventricular nucleus of the
  hypothalamus (PVN) by reducing the endocannabinoid (eCB) synthesis and release through
  the membranous glucocorticoid receptor (mbGR) blockade. This effect increases glutamate
  release from glutamatergic synapsis to the PVN neurons. (b) In addition to leptin,
  ghrelin acts on parvocellular neurons of the PVN. The bind of ghrelin to its receptor
  triggers an intracellular Ca2+ level increase leading to 2-AG synthesis. The release
  of 2-AG into the extracellular space, activates the presynaptic CB1 inhibiting the
  release of glutamate from the axons innervating PVN neurons. (c) In lateral hypothalamus
  (LH), the activation of leptin receptor (LepR) in prefornical LH neurons results
  in less synthesis and release of eCB. This effect led to an increase in the GABAergic
  inhibitory tone to melanocortin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons to control food
  intake and appetite. (d) Leptin also acts on SF-1 neurons of the ventromedial nucleus
  of the hypothalamus (VMH). Although molecular mechanisms are not fully described,
  CB-1 dependent endocannabinoid signaling interferes in the leptin activation of
  SF-1 neurons. (e) Within the arcuate nucleus (ARC), on the one hand leptin activates
  POMC neurons and reduces eCB synthesis and release. On the other hand, CB1 agonists
  increase the secretion of NPY in AgRP/NPY neurons
