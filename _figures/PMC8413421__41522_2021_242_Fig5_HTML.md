caption: 'We speculate a possible metabolic response analysis of three differential
  metabolites, in which an increase of glyceric acid and L-aspartic acid may indicate
  an acceleration of glycolysis and TCA cycle, and functional analysis of differential
  metabolites also illustrates this speculated (KO2147, KO0131). In addition, tyrosine
  is decomposed into dopamine and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, Eggerthella lenta can convert
  dopamine to m-tyramine, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate is oxidized to p-hydroxyphenylacetic.
  Eggerthella lenta and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate was significantly increased in A53T
  monkeys. G-3-P: oxidation of plyeradehyde-3-phosphate, 1,3-BPG: 1,3-triglyceric
  acid diphosphate, 3-PG: 3-phosphoglycerate. Yellow: metabolites, microbiota, KO
  increased significantly in A53T monkeys.'
