caption: 'Stoichiometry of the glycolytic, fermentative, and tricarboxylic acid  cycle
  (TCA) pathway. We calculated the in vivo fluxes  through glycolysis. In this simplified
  scheme enzymes with the same flux are  boxed together. The numbers next to the boxed  enzymes
  are the calculated in vivo fluxes through the enzymes of 30  째C (underlined) and
  38 째C (normal numbers)  cultivations. Many enzyme abbreviations are defined in the
  abbreviation  footnote. The following abbreviations are used: SC, storage  carbohydrates;
  PPP, pentose-phosphate pathway; FBA,  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase; PYK, pyruvate
  kinase.'
