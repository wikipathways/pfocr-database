caption: Relevant pathways of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This diagram shows
  only a few of the components of the UPR but highlights three central elements that
  were examined here. The UPR begins with the recognition of luminal misfolded proteins
  by the chaperone BiP (GRP78), known to interact with both α and β Na,K-ATPase subunits
  during biosynthesis in Xenopus oocytes (). The UPR initially activates defensive
  programs to expand the folding capacity of the ER. (Left) Activated IRE1α has a
  cytoplasmic nuclease activity needed to splice the XPB1 mRNA to XBP1s, changing
  its reading frame so that it encodes a master transcription factor for the defensive
  arm of the UPR. (Middle) Activated PERK phosphorylates an essential translation
  initiation factor, eIF2α. This attenuates translation, reducing the stress on the
  ER and making it possible for its resources to be redirected to defensive adaptations
  (). (Right) If aggregated proteins nonetheless accumulate, the UPR activates apoptosis
  (). The pathway utilizes the BCL-2 family proteins that regulate the formation of
  mitochondrial pores (black circle) by BAX and BAK to release cytochrome c (). Current
  models hold that BAX and BAK are activated directly by members of one arm of the
  BCL-2 family (the direct activators), in response to various signals. Apoptosis
  is constitutively restrained, however, by BCL-2 itself, which binds and blocks BAX
  and BAK. For apoptosis to proceed, BCL-2 needs to be sequestered (crosshatch) by
  binding to BAD or other members of the sensitizer arm of the BCL-2 family. BAD binding
  to BCL-2 is attenuated by phosphorylation by a variety of prosurvival kinases (,
  ). Dephosphorylation of BAD by protein phosphatase (PPase), for example, by calcineurin,
  the Ca2+-activated phosphatase, will activate proapoptotic signaling (). In sum,
  dephosphorylation of BAD, at Ser99 in this case, is an indication that BAD is free
  to inactivate BCL-2, making it more likely that BAX and BAK will respond to direct
  activators, i.e., sensitizing the cell to apoptosis.
