caption: Methodological workflow of the present research. Two categories of samples
  (carotid atherosclerosis samples, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and organoids) were
  collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected hiPSC-derived brain cells and organoids both
  are included in the GSE157852 dataset and GSE 43292. Identifying common DEGs from
  two datasets using the R programming language. From the common DEGs, GO identification,
  KEGG pathway, PPIs network, TF and miRNA analysis, hub gene identification and module
  analysis was designed and based on those analysis drug molecule identification was
  performed.
