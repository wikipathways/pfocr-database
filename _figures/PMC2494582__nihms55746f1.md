caption: This model shows the interactions between the components of some of the major
  pathways that affect AQP2, and summarizes most of the points outlined in this review.
  The canonical V2R signaling pathway is depicted, with VP stimulation of V2R leading
  to the phosphorylation of AQP2 by PKA and subsequently altering the balance between
  exocytosis and endocytosis, leading to AQP2 accumulation at the apical plasma membrane.
  Also shown are the NO-cGMP pathway and the PGE2 receptor EP3 that can also positively
  and negatively modulate AQP2 trafficking respectively, as well as factors that affect
  AQP2 abundance and the elements and transcription factors that mediate this regulation.
  (activator protein-1 element (AP1), adenylate cyclase (AC), aquaporin-2 (AQP2),
  cAMP response element (CRE), CRE binding protein (CREB), cyclooxygenase (COX), G-protein
  i α subunit (Giα), G-protein s α subunit (Gsα), guanylate cyclase (GC), heat-shock
  protein of 70kDa (hsp70), myelin and lymphocyte-associated protein (MAL), nitric
  oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), nuclear factor of activated T-cells c (NFATc),
  phosphodiesterase (PDE), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostaglandin receptor (EP3),
  protein kinase G (PKG), protein kinse A (PKA), Rho family small GTPase (Rho), tonicity
  response element (TonE), TonE binding protein (TonEBP), vasopressin (VP), vasopressin
  receptor type-2 (V2R))
