  4.0.Notes: hsa-miR-181a-5p can regulate the function of the Notch signaling pathway.
  Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway in multicellular organisms
  that regulates cell fate determination during development and maintains adult tissue
  homeostasis. In mammalian signal-sending cells, members of the Delta-like (DLL1,
  DLL3 & DLL4) and the Jagged (JAG1 & JAG2) families serve as ligands for Notch signaling
  receptors. Upon ligand binding, the NECD is cleaved away (S2 cleavage) from the
  TM-NICD domain by TACE (TNF-α ADAM metalloprotease converting enzyme). The NECD
  remains bound to the ligand, and this complex undergoes endocytosis/recycling within
  the signal-sending cell in a manner dependent on ubiquitination by Mib. In the signal-receiving
  cell, γ-secretase (also involved in Alzheimer’s disease) releases the NICD from
  the TM (S3 cleavage), which allows for nuclear translocation where it associates
  with the CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1) transcription factor complex, resulting in subsequent
  activation of the canonical Notch target genes, including Myc, p21, and the HES-family
  members. Abnormal expression of Notch and related proteins has been observed in
  EC, and the Notch signaling pathway may play a role in the development, growth,
  and metastasis of EC.– Targets of hsa-miR-181a-5p are marked with a red star.Abbreviations:
  EC, endometrial cancer; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.'
