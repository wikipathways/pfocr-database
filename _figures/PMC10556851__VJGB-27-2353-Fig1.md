caption: Phytoene synthase PSY catalyzes the synthesis of phytoene, from which translycopene
  is formed as a result of several successive reactions. Further, the metabolic pathway
  is divided into β,β- and β,ε-branches, which lead to the production of β-carotene
  and α-carotene, respectively, and then β-cryptoxanthin and xanthophylls – zeaxanthin,
  antheraxanthin, violaxanthin (β,β-carotenoids) and lutein (β,ε-carotenoids). The
  modification of β-carotene and violaxanthin under the action of carotenoid-cleaving
  dioxygenases leads to the synthesis of apocarotenoids – strigolactones and abscisic
  acid (ABA), respectively.
