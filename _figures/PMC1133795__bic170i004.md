caption: Stimulation of the Toll pathway by fungi and Gram-positive bacteria induces
  Cactus phosphorylation by an unknown kinase, triggering Cactus degradation by the
  proteasome. This releases Dif and Dorsal NF-κB-like transcription factor to translocate
  into the nucleus and induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides directed against
  Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. The Imd pathway is activated by Gram-negative
  bacteria, which trigger a cell-membrane-bound peptidoglycan recognition protein,
  PGRP-LC. Downstream of this receptor, the Imd signalling pathway bifurcates. One
  branch triggers the activation of the Drosophila melanogaster (dm) IKK complex,
  via the MAP 3-kinase dTAK1, which then directly phosphorylates Relish. The other
  branch regulates the activation of Dredd caspase. This directly cleaves phosphorylated
  Relish, generating the N-terminal transcription factor fragment (Rel-68) that translocates
  into the nucleus and induces the expression of antimicrobial peptides directed against
  Gram-negative bacteria. The IκB-like C-terminal fragment, Rel-49, remains in the
  cytoplasm, but does not prevent nuclear translocation of Rel-68. Imd is an adapter
  protein, containing a DD, which is required for activation of both the IKK and Dredd
  branches. ANK, ankyrin repeat region.

  description: Stimulation of the Toll pathway by fungi and Gram-positive bacteria
    induces Cactus phosphorylation by an unknown kinase, triggering Cactus degradation
    by the proteasome. This releases Dif and Dorsal NF-κB-like transcription factor
    to translocate into the nucleus and induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides
    directed against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. The Imd pathway is activated
    by Gram-negative bacteria, which trigger a cell-membrane-bound peptidoglycan recognition
    protein, PGRP-LC. Downstream of this receptor, the Imd signalling pathway bifurcates.
    One branch triggers the activation of the Drosophila melanogaster (dm) IKK complex,
    via the MAP 3-kinase dTAK1, which then directly phosphorylates Relish. The other
    branch regulates the activation of Dredd caspase. This directly cleaves phosphorylated

    directed against Gram-negative bacteria. The IκB-like C-terminal fragment, Rel-49,
    remains in the cytoplasm, but does not prevent nuclear translocation of Rel-68.
    Imd is an adapter protein, containing a DD, which is required for activation of
    both the IKK and Dredd branches. ANK, ankyrin repeat region.
