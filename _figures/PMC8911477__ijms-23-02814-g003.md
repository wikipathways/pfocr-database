caption: Upstream mTORCs pathways. Solid arrows show direct interactions between proteins
  and dashed arrows indicate the presence of other unrepresented mediators. The canonical
  PI3K/Akt pathway regulates mTORC1 activity through the binding of trophic and growth
  factors (BDNF, VEGF, IGF-1 among others) to RTK/GPCR-specific receptors. PI3K activation
  upregulates Akt by phosphorylation of Thr308. Full Akt activity requires the phosphorylation
  of Ser473 by mTORC2. Active Akt inhibits the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which
  leads to induction of the GTPase Rheb, allowing activation of mTORC1. Amino acid
  availability leads to the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosome membrane, which
  in turn allows its activation by Rheb. The AMPK pathway is activated in low-energetic
  states (AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios increase). This activation requires the phosphorylation
  of Thr172 by LKB1. Active AMPK reduces mTORC1 activity through two distinct mechanisms,
  namely phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser722/792 and phosphorylation of TSC2 at Ser1387.
  Hypoxia induces an increase in REDD1, which downregulates mTORC1 by destabilizing
  TSC. Furthermore, mTORC2 activity is regulated by the presence of growth factors,
  neurotransmitters, and hormones, which all activate PI3K by binding to RTK/GPCRs.

  description: Upstream mTORCs pathways. Solid arrows show direct interactions between
    proteins and dashed arrows indicate the presence of other unrepresented mediators.
    The canonical PI3K/Akt pathway regulates mTORC1 activity through the binding of
    trophic and growth factors (BDNF, VEGF, IGF-1 among others) to RTK/GPCR-specific
    receptors. PI3K activation upregulates Akt by phosphorylation of Thr308. Full
    Akt activity requires the phosphorylation of Ser473 by mTORC2. Active Akt inhibits
    the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which leads to induction of the GTPase Rheb,
    allowing activation of mTORC1. Amino acid availability leads to the translocation
    of mTORC1 to the lysosome membrane, which in turn allows its activation by Rheb.
    The AMPK pathway is activated in low-energetic states (AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios
    increase). This activation requires the phosphorylation of Thr172 by LKB1. Active
    AMPK reduces mTORC1 activity through two distinct mechanisms, namely phosphorylation
    of Raptor at Ser722/792 and phosphorylation of TSC2 at Ser1387. Hypoxia induces
    an increase in REDD1, which downregulates mTORC1 by destabilizing TSC. Furthermore,
