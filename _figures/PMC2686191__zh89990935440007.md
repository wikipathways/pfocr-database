caption: NF-κB activity in MM cells. MM cells express both canonical and noncanonical
  NF-κB activity. In MM cells, both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways are
  activated, and there is possible cross-talk signaling between each pathway. BMSCs
  activate canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways in MM cells. Both canonical and
  noncanonical pathways should be blocked to inhibit total NF-κB activation in the
  context of the MM microenvironment. IKKα knockdown induces down-regulation of β-catenin
  and Aurora-A expression independent of NF-κB inhibition.
