caption: The EGFR-Ras-Raf pathway in hair follicle development and integrity. The
  hair cycle consists of several phases, namely anagen, catagen, and telogen. In physiological
  conditions, cyclical on/off switching of the EGFR-Ras-Raf pathway is required for
  hair cycle progression. Following injury, this cyclical rhythm is temporarily perturbed
  until the wound is repaired; continuous pathway activation, however, can lead to
  tumor formation.
