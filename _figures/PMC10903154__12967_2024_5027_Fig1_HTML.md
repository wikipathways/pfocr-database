caption: 'Hippo signaling pathway and its network. When upstream signals activate
  the Hippo pathway (Hippo ON), the phosphorylation cascade is enabled that ultimately
  induces YAP/TAZ proteasomal degradation (leftside). In Hippo OFF conformation, promoted
  by mechanical signaling and hormones, YAP/TAZ can translocate to the nucleus. Here,
  by interacting with TEAD transcription factors and cofactors, YAP/TAZ activate the
  transcription of target genes. ABCP: apico-basal cell polarity protein; AMOT: angiomotin;
  AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; AREG: amphiregulin; CTGF: connective tissue
  growth factor; CRB: crumbs; CYR61: Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61; KIBRA: kidney
  and brain expressed protein; NF2: neurofibromin 2; RUNX2: Runt-related transcription
  factor 2; SCD1: Stearoyl-CoA-desaturase-1; SMAD: small mother against decapentaplegic;
  TAO: thousand-and-one amino acid'
