caption: Several distinct pathways sense dietary input from nutrients in the environment.
  Amino acids are sensed by the complex TSC1/TSC2 of the TOR pathway. This signal
  is relayed by a series of mediators, including TOR kinase to the downstream effectors
  S6K1 and 4E-BP. S6K and 4E-BP enhance translation, and hence, anabolism. Glucose
  is transported into the cell and converted from ADP and AMP to ATP, which ratios
  are sensed by the AMPK pathway. AMPK interacts with TSC1/TSC2 to ensure cell homeostasis.
  Circulating insulin and IGF (IIS) are sensed by the Insulin Receptor (IR) and transmitted
  to the Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS, chico in flies). The activated IRS relays
  the signal to PI3K, which activates AKT, which in turn leads to transcriptional
  activation of target genes. AKT links the IIS pathway to the glucose sensors and
  TOR signaling and promotes anabolic processes. Reciprocally, signals from the TOR
  pathway are relayed via S6K to the IRS in the IIS pathway. As an organism's energy
  requirements vary throughout lifespan, these signaling pathways operate to maintain
  energy homeostasis during periods of high demand, such as development and reproduction.
  Decay in the relays of signals and/or crosstalk leads to aging and age related diseases
  like insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome
  and cancer.
