caption: 'In the kidney and parathyroid glands, FGF23 signaling requires the presence
  of FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor) and the coreceptor klotho. The binding
  of the FGF23-klotho complex to FGFR triggers auto-phosphorylation of the receptor
  tyrosine kinase. This activation initiates signaling through three major pathways:
  Ras-MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and PLCγ-PKC. These pathways help the kidneys maintain a phosphate
  balance. In chronic kidney disease, when phosphate levels increase in the blood,
  it activates the parathyroid gland to secrete parathyroid hormone, which activates
  bone to release more FGF23, which binds in cardiomyocytes along with the HSP receptor.
  In cardiomyocytes, FGF23 signaling requires FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor)
  and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSP) as a coreceptor. FGF23 binding to FGFR4
  on cardiomyocytes stimulates autophosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase
  independently of klotho. FGF23 increases NFAT, which enters the nucleus of the cardiomyocyte
  and increases the expression of hypertrophic genes, result left ventricular hypertrophy.
  Apart from FGF23, FGF2 also causes hypertrophy by the Ras-MAP signaling pathway'
