caption: Specific nutrients and dietary manipulations affecting insulin/insulin-like
  growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway. IIS pathway activates the kinase mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) and promotes growth and aging. High-glycemic index foods
  as well as high intake of some amino acids (AAs) like leucine are the dietary components
  most involved in increasing insulin levels after feeding. Other AAs like methionine
  and tryptophan act on growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor 1 (GH-IGF1) pathway.
  Moreover, the downstream effector mTOR is directly stimulated by specific AAs including
  leucine and arginine, simple carbohydrates like glucose and fructose, and saturated
  fatty acids like palmitate. Other nutritional conditions suppress IIS pathway. In
  particular, this pathway is downregulated by caloric restriction (CR), protein restriction
  (PR) and by diets having a low ratio between proteins and carbohydrates (CHO), as
  well as by the stress-responsive hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Other
  nutrients such as ω3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3-PUFAs) cause mTOR repression
  by acting as negative modulators of fosfoinositide 3-chinasi (PI3K)/AKT pathway.
  Inhibition of mTOR may be also induced by CR, PR and low protein/CHO diets through
  mechanisms involving AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin (SIRT) activation.
