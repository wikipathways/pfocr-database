caption: Mechanisms of GLP‐1 mediated β‐cell functional enhancement and preservation.
  Activation of the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor on β‐cells by endogenous
  GLP‐1, released from enteroendocrine L cells, leads to an increase in intracellular
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. This rise in cAMP activates protein
  kinase A (PKA) and Exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac), thereby enhancing
  insulin gene transcription mediated by the transcription factor pancreatic and duodenal
  homeobox 1 (PDX‐1), increasing insulin exocytosis, and promoting β‐cell proliferation.
  Additionally, this signaling pathway mitigates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,
  contributing to β‐cell survival. Glucose stimulates GLP‐1 secretion through glucose
  transporter 2 (GLUT2)‐mediated uptake and the closure of K ATP channels, as well
  as the activation of enzymes involved in β‐cell glucose metabolism, thus contributing
  to GLP‐1's glucose‐dependent effects on insulin secretion. The figure further illustrates
  the downstream impact of PKA activation on the phosphorylation of cAMP response
  element‐binding protein (CREB) and the subsequent expression of insulin receptor
  substrate‐2 (IRS‐2), amplifying the insulin signaling cascade (created with BioRender.com)
