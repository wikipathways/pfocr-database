caption: Model of E4orf4-induced cell death in normal Drosophila tissues. E4orf4 in
  collaboration with PP2A and Src induces caspase-dependent and -independent types
  of cell death. At the same time it also inhibits rpr, hid, and grim (RHD)-induced
  apoptosis, although its direct target in this pathway is not currently known. E4orf4
  also inhibits JNK-induced cell death downstream of Hep. Inhibition of JNK signaling
  enhances E4orf4-induced cell death. These features of cell killing by E4orf4 indicate
  that it is a unique form of cell death, distinct from RHD- or JNK-induced death
  signaling. As a result of combined activation and inhibition of cell death, E4orf4
  induces minor damage to normal tissues. Discontinuous arrows represent a weak effect.
