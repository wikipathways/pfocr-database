caption: Quality control of glycoprotein folding in the ER. A, schematic diagram of
  the glycan-processing steps during quality control of glycoprotein folding in the
  ER. During N-glycosylation, a glycan (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2; B) is transferred to the
  Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequence of nascent proteins that are being translocated into the
  ER. The sequential action of glucosidase I (GI) and GII produces monoglucosylated
  glycans able to interact with the lectin chaperones calnexin (CNX) and/or calreticulin
  (CRT). This interaction facilitates both glycoprotein folding and interaction with
  the protein-disulfide isomerase ERp57, thus preventing exit from the ER of misfolded
  glycoproteins until proper folding is achieved (, ). The formation of monoglucosylated
  glycoproteins occurs either by deglucosylation of the transferred N-glycan or by
  reglucosylation by UGGT. UGGT is a glycoprotein folding status sensor that transfers
  a glucose residue to the Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide of glycoproteins that have
  not yet acquired their native structure. Removal of mannose residues by α-mannosidase(s)
  generates a degradation signal on misfolded/slow folding glycoproteins. OS-9 recognizes
  Manα1,6Manα1,6Man on the trimmed C arm via its MRH domain () and facilitates entry
  of misfolded glycoproteins into the ER-associated degradation pathway where the
  misfolded glycoproteins exit the ER and are degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol.
  SEC61, translocon; OST, oligosaccharyltransferase; ribbon diagram representing the
  crystal structure of calnexin is shown (Protein Data Bank code 1JHN ()); α-MAN,
  α-mannosidase; ribbon diagram of human OS-9 is shown (Protein Data Bank code 3AIH
  ()). B, structure of the oligosaccharide transferred to proteins during N-glycosylation.
  Lettering (a–n) follows the order of monosaccharide addition during the synthesis
  of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. Glucosidase I (GI) removes residue n. GII removes
  residues l and m. UGGT adds residue l to residue g.
