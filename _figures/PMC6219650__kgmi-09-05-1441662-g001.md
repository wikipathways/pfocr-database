caption: 'Model of Erdr1 Regulation and Downstream Pathways in CD4+ T Cells : Erdr1
  suppression is regulated by the microbiota via TLR signaling in CD4+ T cells. In
  the presence of commensal microbes, TLR2 signals through a MyD88 dependent pathway
  and suppresses Erdr1, resulting in RankL and Fas activation. Apoptosis is induced
  by Caspase 3 following Fas activation. The data suggests that the working model
  is 1) microbial ligands activate TLR2, which activates MyD88. MyD88 then either:
  A) suppresses Erdr1 independent of NFkB and outside the nucleus, or B) induces activated
  NFkB suppression of Erdr1 from inside the nucleus.  2) Free cytosolic Erdr1 is secreted
  by an unknown channel and works in an autocrine manner on the 3) currently unknown
  Erdr1 receptor, which upregulates RankL and Fas. 4)  Activated RankL activates Fas/FasL
  pathway 5) Activation of FasL/FasR pathway leading to Caspase 8 and 3 activation
  and resulting apoptosis.'
