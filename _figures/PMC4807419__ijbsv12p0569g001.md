caption: The transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of LDLR expression.
  The expression of LDLR is tightly regulated at transcriptional and posttranscriptional
  levels. When the intracellular concentration of cholesterol is high, the sterol
  sensor protein SCAP undergoes a conformational change that permits it to bind to
  Insig-1, which then forms SREBP-2/SCAP/Insig-1 ternary complex. The binding of the
  Insig proteins traps SREBP-2/SCAP in the ER membrane so that the SREBP-2 is not
  able to reach the Golgi apparatus for cleavage, and the LDLR gene expression decreases
  accordingly. As a result, cholesterol uptake is inhibited, and the cells establish
  cholesterol homeostasis. In contrast, when the cells are low on cholesterol, SCAP
  does not interact with the Insig proteins. The SREBP-2/SCAP complex is therefore
  free to leave the ER. After reaching the Golgi apparatus, the transcriptionally
  active domain of the SREBP-2 precursor will be proteolytically cleaved to release
  the mature form of nSREBP-2 in the Golgi membrane, while SCAP returns to the ER
  for recycling. The nSREBP-2 enters into the nucleus and binds with SRE to activate
  LDLR gene transcription. At the posttranscriptional level, the secreted form of
  PCSK9 specifically binds to LDLR to form the PCSK9/LDLR complex. In the presence
  of ARH, the LDLR/PCSK9 complex is internalized into the cells. After entering the
  endosome, the binding of PCSK9 and LDLR is further strengthened, preventing recycling
  of the LDLR from the endosome back to the cell surface and/or directing the LDLR
  to the lysosome where it is degraded. Alternatively, in an intracellular pathway,
  the nascent PCSK9 combines directly with LDLR in the Golgi apparatus, which mediates
  degradation in the lysosomes. LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor; SREBP-2, sterol
  regulatory element-binding protein-2; nSREBP-2, nuclear SREBP-2; SCAP, SREBP cleavage
