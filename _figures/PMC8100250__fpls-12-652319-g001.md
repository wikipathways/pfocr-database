caption: Simplified scheme for fatty acid modification in Brassicas. Fatty acid (FA)
  elongation of 18:1-CoA is carried out by a protein complex containing the FA elongase,
  FAE1. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) shuttles acyl groups between
  PC and the acyl-CoA pool. The polyunsaturated FA pathway involves desaturation of
  18:1 (esterified to PC) by the FA desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3. 18:1-CoA and acyl-PC
  are the substrates for FAE1 and the FA desaturases, respectively. PDCT (phosphatidylcholine
  (PC):diacylglycerol (DAG) cholinephosphotransferase) is also named REDUCED OLEATE
  DESATURATION (ROD1) that modulates polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) content by interconverting
  PC and DAG, transferring 18:1 into PC for desaturation, and 18:2 and 18:3 into the
  triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthetic pathway thereby increasing PUFA content in TAG
  (). Choline phosphotransferase (CPT) may also mediate the interconversion of DAG
  and PC but is not shown here for simplicity.
