caption: Multiple modes of action of Mg2+ in attenuating Pi-induced VC in HAVSMC.
  This figure summarizes all the knowledge from the previous [, , ] and the current
  report concerning Mg2+ from its entry into the cell through TRPM7 and its role in
  crystal composition and structure, modifications of calcification inhibitors, cell
  viability, osteogenic differentiation, inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  and finally the influence of Mg2+ on osteogenes expression (Runx2, Osterix, and
  Smad1) through specific miR modulation (miR-30b, miR-133a, and miR-143). The question
  marks indicate undetermined mechanisms. ECM, extracellular matrix; OCN, osteocalcin;
  MGP, Matrix Gla Protein; OPN, Osteopontin; Ca × Pi, calcium by phosphate product;
  TRPM7, transient receptor potential melastatin-7; Fzd, Frizzled-3 receptor (Wnt
  signaling proteins); CASR, calcium sensing receptor.
