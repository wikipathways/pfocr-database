caption: 'Immunomodulatory activity of FTY720P. FTY720P as functional antagonist indirectly
  diminishes STAT-3 signaling by binding to S1PR1 on the cell surface, resulting in
  the internalization of S1PR1, and preventing S1P from binding to and activating
  this receptor. Binding of FTY720P to the receptor thus causes the receptor to be
  sequestered inside the cell, out of reach of S1P. Solid arrows indicate S1P-dependent
  signaling pathways; dashed arrows indicate the impact of functional antagonist—FTYY720P
  on signaling pathways. Abbreviations: S1P—sphingosine-1-phosphate; S1PR1—sphingosine-1-phosphate
  receptor1; FTY720P—fingolimod phosphate (S)-enantiomer; SK—sphingosine kinase; STAT3—signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3; NFκB—nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; CAC—colitis and cancer; red cross means that this pathway
  is inhibited.'
