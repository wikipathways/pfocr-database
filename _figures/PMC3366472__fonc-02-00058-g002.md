caption: 'TLR-4 signaling in cancer. The TLR-4/MD-2 receptor complex recognizes and
  binds exogenous PAMP (e.g., endotoxins such as LPS) as well as endogenous alarmins
  (HMGB-1, hyaluronan, heat shock proteins). Release of DAMP into the extracellular
  space is achieved by a number of different mechanisms including (i) leakage from
  necrotic cells, (ii) increased synthesis and post-translational modification in
  response to inflammation, and (iii) degradation of inactive precursors into TLR-mimetic
  degradation products in inflammatory environments (Mencin et al., ). TLR-4 induces
  two distinct signaling pathways controlled by the TIRAP/MyD88 and TRAM/TRIF pairs
  of adaptor proteins, which elicit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  type I interferons, respectively. The cytosolic adapter molecules mentioned above
  comprise myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), Toll/IL-1R resistance domain-containing
  adapter inducing IFN-β (TRIF), TIR domain-containing adapter protein (TIRAP), and
  TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM). TIRAP is also termed Mal (MyD88 adaptor-like),
  TRIF is also known as Toll/IL-1R homology domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1),
  whereas TRAM is alternatively entitled TIR-containing protein (TIRP) and TICAM-2,
  respectively. TLR-4-mediated signal transduction occurs via MyD88-dependent and
  MyD88-independent (i.e., TRAM/TRIF-dependent) pathways. Both, MyD88-dependent and
  MyD88-independent pathways induce expression of genes involved in pro-inflammatory
  and anti-microbial responses (Akira and Takeda, ). In TLR-4 signaling, MyD88 up-regulates
  inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB activation. Moreover, the MyD88-independent pathway
  does not only induce inflammatory gene expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner but
  also up-regulates type I interferon expression via the transcription factor IRF-3.
  NF-κB activation and subsequent inflammatory cytokine production are mediated by
  different mechanisms and kinetics in the MyD88-dependent and the MyD88-independent
  pathway: NF-κB activation in the MyD88-dependent pathway is an early event occurring
  with fast kinetics whereas NF-κB activation via the MyD88-independent pathway represents
  a late event occurring with slower kinetics. Unlike TLR-4 signaling in immune cells
  which has been found to enhance anti-tumor immunity by, e.g., IL-12/IFN-γ up-regulation
  and promotion of DC maturation and function, TLR-4 signaling in cancer cells increases
  their tumorigenic capacity under certain circumstances (Oblak and Jerala, ). Noteworthy,
  HMGB-1 which is released from irradiated tumor cells functions as an endogenous
  TLR-4 ligand leading to the development of a tumor antigen-specific T cell immunity
  mediated by an interaction of HMGB-1 with TLR-4 on DC.'
