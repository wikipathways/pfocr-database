caption: Flow diagram showing the major key factors involved in the pathogenesis of
  DR and the clinical symptoms evident at different stages of DR. DR is a multifactorial
  disease involving several pathological mechanisms, including increased oxidative
  stress, inflammation, the polyol pathway leading to sorbitol accumulation, production
  of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and activation of the protein kinase C
  (PKC) pathway. These pathways can in turn activate the production of cytokines and
  many vasoactive factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment
  epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), which are vital in mediating the structural and
  functional changes of DR. Clinically significant diabetic macular edema (DME) can
  occur in the late stages of DR with non-proliferative or proliferative retinopathy
  and is the most common cause of vision loss.
