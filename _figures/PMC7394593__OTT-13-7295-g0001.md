caption: 'Schematic illustration of the roles played by the TCA cycle and the Warburg
  effect in gastrointestinal cancers and normal tissues. Normal tissues: The TCA cycle
  incorporates glucose metabolic products and transform them. Tumors: Under the influence
  of the Warburg effect, glucose metabolism is predominantly shunted towards pyruvate
  and lactic acid. PIM1, PI3K/AKT and HBO1 directly promote the conversion of glucose
  into G-6-P. PFKFB4 enhances the conversion of F-6-P into F-1, 6-DP. With the exception
  of BRD7, multiple factors can promote the production of lactic acid by LDHA.'
