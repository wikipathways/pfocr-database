caption: Mechanism of corneal scarring. This figure represents the keratocytes of
  the stromal layer, the epithelial layer, the disrupted Bowman’s membrane, and the
  stromal layer of the human cornea. The mechanism of corneal scarring is depicted
  in a single keratocyte cell for simplicity; (a) activation of transforming growth
  factor-β (TGF-β) from its latent state; (b) SMAD-dependent TGF-β signaling pathway;
  (c) infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the stromal layer and their
  secretion of active TGF-β; (d) CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) signaling
  pathway; (e) substance-P-mediated activation of the Rho/ROCK signaling cascade,
  leading to actin polymerization and MMP gene expression; (f) increase in intracellular
  Ca level by Substance-P-mediated PCL-β activation; (g) Kca3.1 ion-channel-mediated
  hyperpolarization of the keratocyte plasma membrane and subsequent influx of Ca
  ions; (h) Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2)-mediated antioxidant
  gene production; however, BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4) increases keap1
  expression, leading to the formation of the kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1
  (keap1)/Nrf2 complex and their subsequent degradation; (i) deubiquitylation of integrins
  by the USP10/G3BP complex.
