caption: 'Hypothetical model for direct and indirect effects of zinc on intestinal
  iron absorption and iron homeostasis: During adequate zinc status and dietary intakes,
  the biliary-pancreatic zinc secreted into the intestinal lumen stimulates the intestinal
  iron transport via PI3K-IRP2-DMT1 and FPN1. During inadequate zinc intake, reduced
  pancreatic zinc levels reduces intestinal iron transporter DMT1 and FPN1 expression,
  leading to increased retention and inhibition of absorption. Similarly, excretion
  of zinc from tissues such as liver and bone marrow results in declined tissue zinc,
  and as a consequence reduced FPN1 expression, leading to reduced secretion for erythropoietic
  needs. Alternately, zinc might prevent inflammation and thus negate its inhibitory
  effect on iron absorption. During zinc sufficiency, growth signaling mediated by
  mTORC1 pathway might increase the iron requirements and thus improve iron absorption.'
