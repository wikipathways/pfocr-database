caption: The C/EBPβ/CITED4 pathway in exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy
  and exercise-induced cardioprotection. Exercise leads to downregulation of the transcription
  factor C/EBPβ which is associated with increased AKT activity in the heart. The
  C/EBPβ interacts with SRF binding to the promoters of cardiac genes (e.g., GATA4
  and α-MHC) and CITED4, leading to a negative transcriptional regulation of these
  genes. Increased CITED4 can act as a regulator of mTOR signaling with increased
  phosphorylation of p70S6K, ULK1/2, and 4E-BP, which mediates the beneficial effects
  of CITED4 in promoting physiological cardiac hypertrophy and preventing cardiac
  I/R injury. Increasing CITED4 is also able to prevent pathological hypertrophy through
  activating the mTOR pathway and upregulating anti-fibrotic miR-30d. C/EBPβ CCAAT/enhancer
  binding protein β, SRF serum response factor, CITED4 CBP/p300-interacting transactivator
  with ED-rich carboxyterminal domain 4, α-MHC α-myosin heavy chain, mTOR mammalian
  target of rapamycin, AKT protein kinase B, miR microRNA, LV left ventricle, CM cardiomyocyte,
  I/R ischemia-reperfusion
