caption: A schematic diagram for CO2-mediated CBF-dependent cold signaling and freezing
  tolerance in Arabidopsis. Black arrows indicate a proposed CO2 modulated cold signaling
  pathway (center). Grey arrows represent signaling pathways involved in stomatal
  movement (left) and freezing tolerance (right). This model proposes that CO2-modulated
  CBF-dependent cold signaling is mediated by βCA1/4 and HT1. In response to supra-ambient
  CO2, βCA1/4 suppresses HT1, which decreases both CBF-mediated cold signaling and
  freezing tolerance, while suppression of HT1 by βCA1/4 is reduced in response to
  sub-ambient CO2, and this enhances CBF-mediated freezing tolerance. In addition,
  βCA1/4 mediate suppression of CBF-independent expression of downstream cold-responsive
  genes. A potential new connection based on our preliminary results is shown as a
  dotted line. The question mark indicates that the gene responsible for the indicated
  pathway has not yet been definitely identified.
