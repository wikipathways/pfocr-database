caption: Activation of mast cells initiates a cascade of events resulting in Th2 polarization
  and both positive and negative feedback regulatory loops. Mast cells are activated
  when antigen binds to specific IgE molecules bound to FcεRI receptors on the surface
  of the mast cell. Subsequent crosslinking results in signaling through the IgE receptor
  and activation of multiple pathways, including the JAK–STAT pathway. STAT5 has been
  shown to be required for IgE-mediated cytokine production as well as histamine and
  leukotriene release. Although histamine and leukotrienes cause the early-phase response
  through vasodilation and bronchial constriction, cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13
  mediate the late-phase response. IL-4 and IL-13 share the ability to signal through
  the IL-4Rα, which is associated with JAKs 1 and 3, leading to the activation of
  STAT6. STAT6 activation leads to polarization toward a T helper 2 phenotype, resulting
  in the release of cytokines such as IL-10, IL-6, IL-5, IL-9, IL-4 and IL-13. IL-4
  and IL-13 can both signal through STAT6 in B cells, inducing isotype switching and
  subsequent production of IgE, which can bind FcεRI on mast cells.– Unlike the allergy-promoting
  effects of IL-4 on B cells, IL-10 has an inhibitory effect on mast cells, leading
  to the suppression of both c-kit and FcεRI expression, accompanied by the induction
  of apoptosis.– Mast cell-derived transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) also acts
  as a negative regulator, working in an autocrine manner on mast cells.– IL-5, on
  the other hand, supports the differentiation, survival and proliferation of both
  B cells and eosinophils, partly mediated through JAK2–STAT5 signaling, in conjunction
  with other pathways., Further recruitment of eosinophils occurs through production
  of the chemokine eotaxin, largely by cells of the airway epithelia. Eotaxin can
  be induced by the cytokines IL-4, IL-13 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which
  are derived from Th2 cells and possibly directly from mast cells themselves.–
