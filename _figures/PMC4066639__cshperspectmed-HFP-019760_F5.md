caption: The stress-signaling pathways in C. neoformans and C. gattii. The HOG pathway
  consists of a phosphorelay system (Tco, hybrid sensor histidine kinase [HHKs]; Ypd1,
  a His-containing phosphotransfer protein [HPt]; Ssk1, a response regulator [RR])
  and a MAPK module; (Ssk2, MAPKKK; Pbs2, MAPKK; Hog1K, MAPK). The Mpk1 MAPK pathway,
  which is composed of Bck1 MAPKKK, Mkk2 MAPKK, and Mpk1 MAPK, appears to be activated
  by multiple upstream signaling pathways, including Pkc1 and Rho-type GTPases (Rho1,
  Rho11, and Rho10). Key components of the cAMP/PKA pathway include Cac1 and Aca1
  for cAMP production and PKA, which consist of Pkr1 (a regulatory subunit) and Pka1/2
  (catalytic subunits). Cac1 is activated by Gpa1 (a Gα subunit). Rim101 is a PKA-dependent
  transcription factor, which undergoes proteolysis for activation. Ras1 signaling
  bifurcates into Rac1, a G protein of the Rho family, and Cdc24, a guanine nucleotide
  exchange (GEF) factor. The calmodulin protein Cam1 binds Ca2+ via four EF-hand motifs
  and activates the Ser/Thr-specific phosphatase, calcineurin, which consists of Cna1
  (a catalytic A subunit) and Cnb1 (a regulatory B subunit). The UPR pathway is composed
  of the Ire1 kinase, the bZIP transcription factor Hxl1, and their target genes,
  including KAR2. The described component functions of the signaling pathways are
  mainly derived from C. neoformans var. grubii. The components characterized in both
  C. gattii as well as C. neoformans are indicated in black boxes. The functions of
  these components in C. gattii are marked by a red line. Dotted arrows or line indicate
  potential but unclear regulation.
