caption: 'Each step is mediated by the following enzymes: (1) acetyl-CoA carboxylase,
  (2–3) malonyl-CoA reductase, (4–6) propionyl-CoA synthase, (7) propionyl-CoA carboxylase,
  (8) methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, (9) methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, (10) succinate dehydrogenase,
  (11) fumarase, (12) succinyl-CoA/malate CoA transferase, and (13) malyl-CoA lyase
  (B) TCA cycle. Each step is mediated by the following enzymes: (1) citrate synthase,
  (2–3) aconitase, (4) isocitrate dehydrogenase, (5) 2-oxoacid ferredoxin oxidoreductase
  or 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, (6) succinyl-CoA synthase, (7) succinate dehydrogenase,
  (8) fumarase, and (9) malate dehydrogenase. In the reductive direction, the steps
  are reversed and citrate synthase is replaced by citrate lyase in (1). Diagrams
  are based on KEGG pathway maps and include enzyme classification numbers (EC) for
  each step in boxes when available. Box color indicates the identification status
  of genes encoding a particular step. See  and  for more information.'
