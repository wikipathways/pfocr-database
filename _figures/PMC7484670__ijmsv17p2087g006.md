caption: Proposed mechanism of mTOR-miR-143 signaling axis in the pathogenesis of
  AD. Activated mTOR signaling pathway by IL-13 could down-regulate the miR-143 expression
  and then block the down-regulation of IL-13Rα1 by miR-143, which results in the
  enhancement of IL-13 activity and suppression of epidermal barrier-related proteins.
  The above process could be reversed by rapamycin, which targets both mTORC1 and
  mTORC2, leading to up-regulation of epidermal barrier-related proteins.
