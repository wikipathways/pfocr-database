caption: Differences in baseline levels of metabolites in brain between sham-operated
  wild-type (WT) and HO-2-null mice under normoxia. Comparisons of metabolites in
  the sham-operated contralateral hemisphere of the brain between wild-type (WT) and
  HO-2-null mice. Total summation of metabolic intermediates belonging to glycolysis
  (solid red lines, ∑ glycolysis) and pentose phosphate pathway (solid blue lines,
  ∑ PPP) were significantly elevated in HO-2-null mice, while the sum of metabolites
  of TCA cycle (solid yellow lines, ∑ TCA) was unchanged. To be noted, the sum of
  metabolites leading to glutamate synthesis (dotted green lines, ∑ acetyl CoA~Glu)
  was significantly elevated in HO-2-null mice. On the other hand, the rest of the
  TCA intermediates (∑ succinyl CoA~malate) was not different between HO-2-null mice
  and wild type mice. G1P, glucose-1-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  F1,6DP, fructose-1,6-biphosphate; 2,3DPG, 2,3-diphophoglycerate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate;
  RU5P, ribulose-5-phosphate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; S7P, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate;
  E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate; X5P, xylulose-5-phosphate, GA3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid. *p<0.05 compared with WT using unpaired Student’s t test.
  Values are mean ± SE of 9 separate experiments, and the unit of all data is nmol/g
  tissue.
