caption: Proposed model of miR-146a-5p involved in attenuating the progress of RILD
  via downregulation of TLR4 signaling. MiR-146a-5p downregulates TLR4 pathway to
  suppress irradiation-induced and LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production
  and HSC activation, as well as alleviate radiation-induced hepatocyte injury

  stellate cell activation and hepatocyte apoptosis through inhibition of TLR4 pathway.
