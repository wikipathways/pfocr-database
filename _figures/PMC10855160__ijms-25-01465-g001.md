caption: 'Schematic representation of plant defense activation in response to pathogen
  infection. The plant immune response is a sophisticated defense mechanism involving
  two primary layers: PTI and ETI. Pattern-triggered immunity inhibits the growth
  of most pathogens through the recognition of PAMPs by PRRs, activating signaling
  pathways such as Ca2+ and ROS signaling, as well as the MAPK cascade. However, certain
  pathogens can release pathogenic effectors to interfere with PTI, resulting in effector-triggered
  susceptibility. Effector-triggered immunity is initiated by the interaction of R
  proteins, possessing a conserved NB-LRR domain, with specific pathogenic effectors.
  This recognition often leads to the activation of PCD/HR at the infection site,
  effectively repressing the growth of pathogens once again. Both ETI and PTI engage
  the defense-related hormone signaling pathways, primarily SA and JA/ET, inducing
  downstream transcription factors. The interaction of SA- and JA/ET-dependent signaling
  pathways is generally considered to be antagonistically involved in the regulation
  of immune response to pathogens with different lifestyles. The signaling pathway
  involving SA is generally responsible for avoiding biotrophs or hemibiotrophs, while
  JA/ET-mediated defense responses are more effective against necrotrophic pathogens.
