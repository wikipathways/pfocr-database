caption: 'Postulated routes for the biosynthesis of anandamide and other NAEs: (A)
  A calcium-dependent transacylase (CDTA) converts phospholipid precursors to N-acyl
  phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). (B) Phospholipase D (PLD) then hydrolyzes NAPEs
  to produce NAEs. (C–E) An alternative PLD-independent pathway in which the sn-1
  and sn-2 O-acyl chains of NAPEs are hydrolyzed to generate the intermediates lyso-NAPE
  (C) and glycerophospho (GP)-NAE (D), respectively. Subsequent cleavage of the phosphodiester
  bonds of lyso-NAPE and GP-NAE would then yield NAEs (E). (F, G) A third pathway
  for the conversion of NAPEs to NAEs involves a phospholipase C-dependent conversion
  of NAPEs to phospho-NAEs (F) followed by the hydrolysis of phospho-NAEs to NAEs
  by phosphatase-mediated hydrolysis (G).'
