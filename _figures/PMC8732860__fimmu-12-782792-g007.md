caption: Model of aseptic inflammation caused by HMGB1-mediated pyrolysis in decidua
  tissue of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion. At the maternal-fetal interface,
  macrophages actively secrete HMGB1 and activate the NF-κB signaling pathway through
  its receptor. Then NLRP-3 inflammasome will be assembled, activate the caspase-1
  protein, and release inflammatory factors such as HMGB1, causing aseptic inflammation
  at the maternal-fetal interface and leading to the development of URSA. Meanwhile,
  HMGB1 inhibitor could ameliorates the maternal-fetal interface destruction in unexplained
  recurrent spontaneous abortion.
