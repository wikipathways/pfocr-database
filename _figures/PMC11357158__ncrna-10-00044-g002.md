caption: TGF-β1/Smad pathway mediated by identified ncRNAs. The TGF-β signaling pathway
  involves three isoforms, namely TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3. This discussion will
  focus specifically on the mechanism of TGF-β1. The precursor form of TGF-β contains
  a latency-associated peptide (LAP), which can be cleaved to allow binding to the
  mature TGF-β homodimer. This complex, along with the latent TGF-β-binding protein
  (LTBP), forms the latent TGF-β/LAP/LTBP complex, maintaining TGF-β in an inactive
  state unable to interact with TGF-βR I and TGF-βR II. Upon release of the TGF-β
  homodimer from the complex, it becomes active and can interact with TGF receptor
  II (TGFR II), leading to TGFR I activation and subsequent phosphorylation of Smad2
  and Smad3. The phosphorylated forms of Smad2 and Smad3 form a complex with Smad4,
  translocate to the nucleus, and bind to the promoter regions of fibrotic genes,
  thereby inducing their transcription. Additionally, Smad7, acting as an inhibitory
  Smad, competitively interacts with TGFR I to inhibit the binding between TGFR I
  and Smad2/3, thereby suppressing the activation of the TGF-β1/Smad pathway. Furthermore,
  Smad7 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase and phosphatases to facilitate the degradation
  and dephosphorylation of Smad2/3. Left–right determination factor 2 (LEFTY2) is
  a member of the TGF-β protein superfamily, which can inhibit TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling.
  Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is an inducer of TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling through promoting
  the Smad3 phosphorylation. Some identified ncRNAs can also regulate the TGF-β/Smad
  pathway by targeting various components of this signaling cascade
