caption: Schematic of an adipocyte cell with large red lipid droplets, indicating
  that overexpressed GPS2 binds to TRAF2 and Ubc13 at the level of the TNFR1 membrane
  complex and inhibits their enzymatic activity. Recruitment of cIAP1 is also inhibited,
  resulting in specific downregulation of JNK activity while the canonical NFκB pathway
  is not affected. Inhibition of JNK activation ameliorates insulin signaling, with
  IRS1 being correctly phosphorylated on Tyr residues in response to insulin stimulation
  and with the activation of the AKT kinase leading to correct upregulation of insulin
  target genes (i.e. AdPLA). Conversely, inhibition of the inflammatory response leads
  to downregulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. GPS2 anti-inflammatory
  role contributes also to license PPARγ transcriptional activity by preventing PPARγ2
  downregulation and inhibiting JNK-dependent phosphorylation of PPARγ, whereas GPS2
  recruitment to regulatory units is important for PPARγ-mediated transcriptional
  activation.
