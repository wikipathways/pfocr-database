caption: The long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway from α-linolenic
  (18:3n-3) and linoleic (18:2n-6) acids. Enzymes that are mutated by CRISPR/Cas9
  in the current study are in bold. The activities of the LC-PUFA synthetic enzymes
  in the pathway have previously been deduced in vitro through heterologous expression
  in S. cerevisiae of Atlantic salmon Δ6fads2-a, Δ6fads2-b and Δ6fads2-c, and of elovl2
  and elovl5 (elovl5a and elovl5b),. Additionally, salmon Δ6fads2-b and Δ6fads2-c
  have been shown to encode proteins that possess Δ8-desaturation activity in vitro,
  converting 20:3n-3 and 20:2n-6 to 20:4n-3 and 20:3n-6 respectively. Elovl5 is believed
  to convert 18:3n-3 and 18:2n-6 to 20:3n-3 and 20:2n-6 respectively. PUFAs that are
  affected by the CRISPR/Cas9 mutations in our study are marked with arrows. Fatty
  acids that have accumulated in both of our mutants, Δ6abc/5Mt and Δ6bcMt are marked
  with bold green arrows and those that accumulated mostly in only Δ6abc/5Mt are marked
  with narrow green arrows. LC-PUFA that has shown reduced percentage composition
  in Δ6abc/5Mt is marked with a red arrow.
