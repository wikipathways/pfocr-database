caption: Possible pathways involved in gut inflammation induced neuron death in the
  brain. Gut inflammation may increase intestinal permeability, allowing the leakage
  of bacteria and their metabolites which may trigger pathologic α-syn aggregation
  and pro-inflammatory cytokine production and release in the ENS. Pathologic α-syn
  is propagated to the brain via the vagal nerve, and inflammatory cytokines are transported
  to the brain through the humoral pathway or stimulate the vagal nerve to produce
  pro-inflammatory factors in the brain. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and synucleinopathies
  in the brain may induce neuronal injury and death, which in turn enhance more severe
  inflammatory responses.
