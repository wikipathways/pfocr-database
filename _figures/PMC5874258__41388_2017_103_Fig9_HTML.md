caption: Model for the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in breast cancer cells lacking
  Cdk5. Loss of Cdk5 in breast cancer cells causes opening of the mPTP, followed by
  mitochondrial depolarization and ROS increase, which leads to the activation of
  caspases and cell death. Opening of the mPTP and subsequent mitochondrial depolarization
  in cells lacking Cdk5 also results in calcium release and calcineurin activation
  that causes dephosphorylation of DRP1 at S637, which accompanies mitochondrial fragmentation
  in breast cancer cells lacking Cdk5
papertitle: Loss of Cdk5 in breast cancer cells promotes ROS-mediated cell death through
  dysregulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
