caption: Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of non-conventional aminosugars, decorating
  aglycones of some dalbaheptides. Biosynthetic pathway of l-epivancosamine serves
  as a model, since EvaA-B-C-D-E, coded within cep, are the only enzymes that were
  studied experimentally. Functions of all other enzymes were assigned by in silico
  comparison (is); (abs) indicates that the corresponding gene is absent from BGCs;
  (?) indicates that the assigned function is speculative, having no experimentally
  investigated prototype. Asterisk at DvaE indicates that this protein is mutated.
