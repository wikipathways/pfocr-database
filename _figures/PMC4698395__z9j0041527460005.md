caption: Mechanisms of stretch-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and
  Ca2+ influx in dystrophic muscle. This schematic highlights some of the key deleterious
  pathways that lead to impaired muscle function, resulting from the loss of dystrophin.
  Particular focus is given to the pathways relating to ROS, Ca2+ and NO. During eccentric
  contractions, NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) is stimulated by a pathway involving microtubules
  and activation of rac1 and src kinase (src). This leads to phosphorylation of Nox
  subunits and activation of Nox2. The ROS produced by Nox2 further activates src,
  which triggers the opening of stretch-activated or store-operated channels (SAC/SOC),
  and influx of Ca2+. Increased Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria can also stimulate additional
  ROS production. Both ROS and NO, produced by mislocalized nNOS and/or iNOS, increase
  the opening of the RyR, leading to Ca2+ leak. See text for further details.
