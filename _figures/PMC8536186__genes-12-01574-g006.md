caption: Integration networks of proteins associated with of fractionated seminal
  plasma (SP1 and SP2). (A) Regulation of HSF1-mediated heat shock response for SP1.
  (B) Major histocompatibility (MHC) class II antigen presentation for SP2. Blue nodes
  indicate the selected protein, while green nodes represent proteins from the neighboring
  pathway. Red and brown nodes represent interacting proteins of the enriched pathways
  of existing research. Network interactions were generated from the FunRich software
  tool v.3.1.4 (2 December 2020; http://www.funrich.org).
