caption: Schematic representation of fibrogenesis during skeletal muscle atrophy.
  (A) After skeletal muscle injury, resident fibroblasts or migrated from peripheral
  region proliferated and differentiated into myofibroblasts to produce ECM. Mass
  collagen deposition replaced skeletal muscle regeneration and induced atrophy. (B)
  Skeletal muscle injury induced release of various cytokines activated TGF-β-dependent
  signaling pathway, non-canonical TGF-β pathways and oxidative stress. COX-2 promoted
  AKT activation by increasing its upstream signaling PDK1 and facilitating the interaction
  between TRAF4 and AKT and the subsequent Lys63 polyubiquitination of AKT. Inhibition
  of COX-2 showed significant inhibitory effect on the signaling pathway that were
  positive for fibrogenesis.
