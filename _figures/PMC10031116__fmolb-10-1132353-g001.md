caption: Relationship between the etiology, regulation mechanisms and targeted therapy
  of skin fibrosis. With environmental or genetic pathogenic factors, fibroblasts
  are activated and secrete large amounts of extracellular matrix. This process is
  further enhanced by the matrix stiffness upregulation. The TGF-β signaling pathway
  acts as the center of this positve feedback. Targeted therapies to break this vicious
  circle is a promising pathway in skin fibrosis treatment.
