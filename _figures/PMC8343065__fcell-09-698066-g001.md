caption: The RB-E2F bistable switch, as outlined by . RB represents the pocket protein
  family consisting of RB itself, p130 and p107. E2F refers to all activator forms,
  namely E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a complexed with a dimerization partner DP1 or DP2. This
  simplified view of the RB-E2F pathway continues to be useful and conceptually valid.
  However, see Box 1 for discussion of the distinctive roles of the different RB family
  members that underlie the pathway.
