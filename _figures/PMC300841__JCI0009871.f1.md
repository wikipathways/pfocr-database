caption: Usurpation of the Ras signaling pathway by reovirus. In untransformed, reovirus-resistant
  cells, double-stranded RNA structures in reovirus transcripts activate PKR, which
  subsequently phosphorylates eIF-2α, inhibiting translation initiation of viral genes.
  In cells with an activated Ras signaling pathway, however, PKR phosphorylation in
  response to viral transcripts is inhibited and viral translation proceeds unimpeded.
