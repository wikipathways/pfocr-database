caption: A diagram for the non-canonical MEK/ERK signaling pathway regulating autophagy
  via regulating Beclin 1. Basal MEK/ERK activity maintains the activity of mTORC1
  and mTORC2 by protecting them from being disassembled and thus maintains a basal
  Beclin 1 level incapable of triggering autophagic response. The non-canonical MEK/ERK
  module is activated by upstream regulator AMPK upon autophagy stimuli. Activation
  of MEK/ERK up-regulates the Beclin 1 level through disassembling mTORC1 and/or mTORC2
  with a significantly sustained and elevated Beclin 1 level causing cytodestructive
  autophagy and moderately elevated Beclin 1 causing cytoprotective autophagy. Disassembling
  mTORC1 by MEK/ERK depends on TSC, whereas disassembling mTORC2 does not depend on
  TSC2. Although ERK is implicated in the regulation of autophagy, MEK can bypass
  ERK to trigger autophagic response.
