caption: Mechanisms of ferroptosis in a cell. (A) The regulation of amino acid metabolism
  can be divided into glutathione consumption and reduced activity or abundance of
  GPX4. The decomposition of glutamine, the availability of cysteine is reduced, and
  the high concentration of glutamic acid outside the cell can affect the synthesis
  of glutathione and Eventually trigger ferroptosis through a series of effects. Methionine
  uses the transsulfation pathway to synthesize cysteine to avoid Xc-system effects
  that can affect ferroptosis. The sec-tRNA and CoQ10 produced in the mevalonate pathway
  can also affect ferroptosis. (B) Lipid metabolism can play a role in ferroptosis
  through both enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways. (C) Ferritin autophagy, iron input
  and output, etc. can use Fenton reaction or Fenton-like reaction to trigger lipid
  peroxidation and ferroptosis. Transcription factor Nrf2 is also involved (SLC7A11,
  the glutamate/cystine antiporter solute carrier family 7 member 11; SLC3A2, the
  glutamate/cystine antiporter solute carrier family 3 member 2; GSL2, glutaminase
