caption: The ubiquitination pathway. Ubiquitin (Ub) protein moiety is activated by
  Ub-activating enzyme E1 (such as UBA1, UBA6) through the cysteine (Cys) residue
  of E1. Ub at E1 is transferred to the Cys residue of Ub-conjugating enzyme E2 (such
  as UBE2B, UBE2D2). Ub conjugated with E2 is catalytically transferred to the lysine
  (Lys) residue of a substrate protein by an E3 Ub ligase (such as RNF6, TRAF6, SKP2,
  NEDD4). Ubiquitinated proteins with the poly- (or mono-) ubiquitination linkage
  are subjected to proteasome-dependent degradation, trafficking between subcellular
  compartments, or the regulation of transcriptional activities.
