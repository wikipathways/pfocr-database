caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis integrating differentially expressed genes and
  microRNAs between imatinib-naïve (IM-n) and imatinib-resistant (IM-r) gastrointestinal
  stromal tumor (GIST) samples. As input for an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) the
  significantly differentially expressed transcripts (352 genes, p < 0.008, False
  Discovery Rate (FDR) < 10%) and miRNAs (88 miRNAs, p < 0.03, FDR < 30%) from the
  same set of IM-r (n = 15) and IM-n (n = 14) GIST samples were used. The depicted
  network indicates miRNA–gene interactions relevant in context of the cell cycle.
  Green and red shading indicates relatively low and high expression in the IM-r samples.
  See  for an extended symbol legend.
