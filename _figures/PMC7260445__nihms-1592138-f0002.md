caption: 'Molecular mechanisms that activate membrane damage. The complement system
  is activated by the classic, lectin, or alternative pathway, all of which share
  a common terminal pathway in which C5 is cleaved into the chemoattractant C5a and
  the pore-initiating protein C5b. C5b then sequentially binds C6, C7, and C8, which
  assemble on the target membrane and recruit C9, which oligomerizes to form the MAC
  pore. Killer cells release cytotoxic granules’ contents (perforin, granzymes, granulysin)
  into the immune synapse formed with the target cell. Perforin oligomerizes to form
  short-lived pores in the target cell membrane that trigger membrane repair, which
  activates endocytosis of the damaged membrane with bound perforin, granzymes, and
  granulysin. Perforin then forms pores in the endosome, releasing granzymes and granulysin
  into the target cell cytosol. Cytosolic granzymes induce both caspase-independent
  and -dependent programmed cell death by cleaving and activating downstream effector
  proteins. In target cells expressing GSDME, granzyme B-activated caspase-3 can cleave
  and activate GSDME to convert noninflammatory cell death to inflammatory pyroptosis.
  In response to cytosolic sensing of microbial infection or danger signals, canonical
  or noncanonical inflammasomes assemble to activate inflammatory caspases (caspase-1
  and caspases-4/−5/−11, respectively). Activated inflammatory caspases cleave GSDMD,
  releasing its N-terminal fragment, GSDMD-NT, which forms pores in the plasma membrane
  to cause pyroptosis. Ligand-bound death receptors direct the recruitment and formation
  of distinct complexes that activate necroptosis or apoptosis. Complex I contains
  TRADD, RIPK1 and E3 ubiquitin ligases, which inhibit apoptosis by poly-ubiquitinating
  RIPK1. If RIPK1 is not ubiquitinated, complex IIa activates caspase-8 and initiates
  apoptosis, whereas when caspase-8 activation is blocked, complex IIb assembles when
  RIPK1 recruits and phosphorylates RIPK3, which initiates necroptosis by phosphorylating
  MLKL. Abbreviations: ALR, AIM2-like receptor; CLR, C-type lectin receptor; DAMP,
  danger-associated molecular pattern; GSDMD, gasdermin D; GSDMD-NT, GSDMD N-terminal
  fragment; GSDME, gasdermin E; GSDME-NT, GSDME N-terminal fragment; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  MAC, membrane attack complex; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase;
  NLR, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor; PAMP, pathogen-associated
  molecular pattern; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNFRSF, tumor necrosis factor receptor
