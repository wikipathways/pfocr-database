caption: Molecular mechanism of PGRN in DOP. (A) Compared with non-diabetic WT mice,
  the fracture healing of diabetic WT mice, non-diabetic ko-PGRN mice and diabetic
  ko-PGRN mice was weakened, and TNF-α, IL-1β, NOS2 and COX-2 were significantly increased,
  especially in diabetic ko-PGRN mice. After r-PGRN treatment, the levels of IL-1β,
  NOS2, COX-2 and NOS2 were significantly decreased, while Col II and ACN were significantly
  increased. In normal BMCs, TNF-α induced phosphorylation of P38, JNK and NF-κB,
  which was inhibited by r-PGRN. In addition, compared with normal BMCs, pro-inflammatory
  signalling pathway and P65 were over activated in diabetic BMCs, and this activation
  was further enhanced in the presence of TNF-α, while r-PGRN inhibited TNF-α induced
  signal transduction in normal and diabetic cells. In normal and diabetic BMCs, PGRN
  effectively inhibited the activation of NF-κB signal, and the expression of NOS2
  increased in the presence of TNF-α, while the up regulation decreased after r-PGRN.
  In diabetic BMCs, PGRN effectively inhibited the transcription levels of IL-1β,
  COX-2 and NOS2 induced by TNF-α. In addition, in TNFR1 deficient BMCs, PGRN significantly
  induced Col II and ACAN transcription levels, while in TNFR2 deficient BMCs, these
  effects mediated by PGRN were almost eliminated, and Akt, ERK1/2 and mTOR signals
  were activated by PGRN during PGRN stimulated cartilage formation. (B) In the process
  of fracture healing in T2DM and T2DM, PGRN was significantly increased and BV/TV
  was significantly decreased. After local administration of r-PGRN, BV/TV ratio was
  increased, COL2A1, ACAN, Col II and Aggrecan were significantly increased, and bone
  formation was improved. When TNF-α was present, the expressions of IL-1β, COX-2
  and NOS2 were significantly increased, P65 was transferred from cytoplasm to nucleus,
  and JNK and P38 were activated. PGRN inhibited this reaction mediated by TNF-α,
  significantly increased the levels of COL2A1 and ACAN in T2DM mice, and activated
  Akt and ERK1/2 signalling pathways. When ko-TNFR1 was blocked, the anabolic effect
  of PGRN was abolished, and the effect of PGRN on the activation of Akt and ERK1/2
  disappeared
