caption: Visualization of Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment profiles from DEGs using Cytoscape
  software based on network analysis of ClueGO/CluePedia inferred from MCODE cluster
  1 (A) and cluster 2 (B). The plugin provides a combined enrichment analysis of clusters,
  including the GO biological process, molecular function, and pathway from KEGG.
  The GO term/pathway network connectivity defined by edges and functional clusters
  on genes shared between terms (kappa score ≥ 0.4) and displaying pathways only with
  p≤ 0.05. The size of the node indicates the p-value. The color code of nodes represents
  the functional group that they belong to. The most important functional terms specify
  the pathway names within each class are indicated in bold colored characters. (A)
  The network enrichment analysis of cluster 1. Each node constitutes a precise term
  for cluster 1; (B) The network enrichment analysis of cluster 2. Each node constitutes
  a precise term for cluster 2.
