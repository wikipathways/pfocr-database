caption: Proposed model of Ostf1 in fishes. The model combines all the findings from
  various fishes. Different colors represent different fishes (green for eel, red
  for medaka, brown for Mozambique tilapia, orange for Nile tilapia, and blue for
  zebrafish). It should be noted that the model might not be fitted for all fishes;
  however, it suggests the general signaling flow of Ostf1 in fishes from its regulators
  to downstream functions. Different molecules or stressors could regulate the expression
  of Ostf1. Hyperosmotic stress is one such stressor. In medaka, osmotic stress activates
  the SEK/JNK pathway to stimulate Ostf1b []. In addition, cortisol injection into
  Mozambique tilapia stimulates the expression of Ostf1 []. In an eel gill cell culture
  model, DEX was shown to induce Ostf1 via the Akt-GSK3β pathway []. Furthermore,
  eel gill immunohistochemical staining has shown the activation of p-ERK and Ostf1
  after fresh water to seawater transfer. p-ERK and Ostf1 co-expressed at the same
  time and further experiments are required in order to determine whether pERK stimulates
  Ostf1, or vice versa []. The final regulator in this model is miR429 in Nile tilapia.
  Similar to other miRNAs, miR429 may inhibit the expression of ostf1 mRNA []. The
  induction of Ostf1 leads to different downstream functions. In euryhaline fresh
  water medaka, Ostf1b may further activate the ROCK pathway for cytoskeleton reorganization,
  and cell migration []. Furthermore, at the same time, it may directly stimulate
  the mRNA expression of different ion transporters or channels to maintain water
  and ion homeostasis []. These osmoregulatory processes have been shown to be related
  to the Ostf1b. In the stenohaline zebrafish, Ostf1 functions as a ventralizing gene
  that plays critical dorsal-ventral roles during early embryogenesis []. To summarize,
  Ostf1 has different functions in fishes, ranging from regulating osmotic responses
  (osmoregulation) to playing critical roles in early development (embryogenesis).
