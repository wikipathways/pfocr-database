caption: Cystine import is the rate-limiting step in glutathione biosynthesis. Cysteine
  can be synthesized within the cell through the trans-sulfuration pathway. However,
  this pathway is often insufficient in cancer cells and therefore cysteine must be
  imported. Different transporters are involved in the import of the reduced, cysteine
  (CySH), and oxidized, cystine (CySSCy) form of this semi-essential AA. The heavy-chain
  transporter subunit of system xc-light chain (xCT) seems to play a pivotal role
  in the import of CySSCy, the predominant form of cysteine in circulation. After
  import, CySSCy is reduced by cystine reductase and used for different purposes including
  GSH biosynthesis. Import of cysteine can occur via ASCT (alanine/serine/cysteine
  transporter) and other transporters (x).
