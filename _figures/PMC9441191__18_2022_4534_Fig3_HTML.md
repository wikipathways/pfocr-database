caption: Model illustrating the Urotensin signaling pathway during body axis development
  of zebrafish. The beating of ependymal motile cilia drives CSF flow, which mediates
  the transmission of epinephrine signals and the assembly of Reissner’s fiber. The
  adrenergic signals activate the expression of Urotensin neuropeptides in the CSF-cNs
  (Urp1 and Urp2). Finally, the urotensin neuropeptides may further activate the Uts2r3
  receptor localized to the dorsal muscle fibers and promote body straightening. Abnormalities
  in the Urotensin signaling pathway will induce either body curvature in larvae or
  scoliosis in adult zebrafish
