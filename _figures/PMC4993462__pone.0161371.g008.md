caption: (A) During normal cell growth, Kre5p serves as a chaperone cycle member for
  the proper folding of N-linked glycoprotein required for the cell wall synthesis
  in ER. (B) CgKRE5 repression induces CWI and UPR. The calcineurin pathway acts as
  a coordinating role for maintaining an appropriate chitin content in CgKRE5 repression-mediated
  CWI. (C) FK-506 prevents the calcineurin pathway and induces an imbalance in cell
  wall structure.
