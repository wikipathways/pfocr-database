caption: Many plant and insect vectored animal (+) ssRNA viruses utilize the surface
  of PE/cholesterol rich membranes for genome replication. Organelles with pre-existing
  pools of PE and cholesterol such as mitochondria and peroxisomes are hijacked and
  further enriched in these lipids. In contrast, many human and animal (+) ssRNA viruses
  appear to rely on PI4P and cholesterol enriched membranes for replication. Upon
  infection, these viruses hijack host Type III PI4 kinases and cholesterol trafficking
  pathways to transform the secretory pathway membranes (ER, Golgi, TGN) into replication
  organelles that are highly enriched in PI4P and cholesterol. The PE/cholesterol
  and PI4P/cholesterol enriched membranes facilitate viral RNA synthesis by helping
  dock and concentrate viral replication proteins; by stimulating viral enzymatic
  reactions; and by generating high curvature membrane pockets that can concentrate
  and segregate viral replication machinery from the host innate immune defenses.
