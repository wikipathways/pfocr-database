caption: Extracellular signals regulate downstream pathways by activating G protein
  signaling and, thus, influence cellular behavior.| Different classes of GPCRs sense
  various extracellular factors, which include ligands, environmental cues, and communication
  signals that bind to the GPCR; this causes GDP-GTP exchange on the Gα protein and
  dissociation of Gα and Gβγ. Both the Gα-GTP and Gβγ dimers may trigger respective
  downstream signal cascades, which include the cAMP-activated Protein Kinase A (PKA)
  pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades pathway, and the phospholipase
  C (PLC) pathway. This process influences cellular growth, reproduction, metabolism,
  virulence, and stress responses. GTP hydrolysis by the Gα subunit results in the
  reassociation of Gα-GDP with the Gβγ dimer and GPCR, which completes the G protein
  cycle. The Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS) proteins can inactivate G protein
  signaling rapidly by increasing intrinsic GTPase activity of GTP-bound Gα subunits.
  In this figure, dashed arrows with the question mark (?) indicates hypothetical
  interactions.
