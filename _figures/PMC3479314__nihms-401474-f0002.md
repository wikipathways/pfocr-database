caption: Growth factors activate phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI 3-K) and Akt. Once
  active, Akt can directly phosphorylate proline rich Akt substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40)
  on threonine246 (T246), resulting in its dissociation from the regulatory associated
  protein of mTOR (Raptor) and preventing inhibition of mTORC1. Akt also can also
  activate IκB kinase-α (IKKα) to increase the activity of mTORC1 through its association
  with Raptor. In the extracellular signal related kinase (ERK) pathway, ERK is activated
  following Ras activation of mitogen activated kinase/ERK kinase (MEK). This leads
  to activation of ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), which phosphorylates Raptor on the residues
  of serine719, serine721, and serine722 (S719, S721, and S722) resulting in enhanced
  activation of mTORC1. Nutrient deficiency reduces cellular ATP level and stimulates
  AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), which leads to the phosphorylation of Raptor
  on S722 and serine792 (S792) and results in the binding of Raptor to the cytoplasmic
  docking protein 14-3-3. Amino acids can activate Rag GTPase. In mammalian cells,
  RagA or RagB forms heterodimers with either RagC or RagD. These heterodimers strongly
  bind to Raptor, which is necessary to initiate amino acid signaling for mTORC1.
  Upon activation, mTORC1 phosphorylates its two major downstream targets p70 ribosome
  S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1).
  mTOR also can phosphorylate PRAS40 on the serine residues serine183, serine212,
  and serine221 (S183, S212, S221). Phosphorylation of PRAS40 on S221 or T246 promotes
  its binding to protein 14-3-3. (p = phosphorylation).
