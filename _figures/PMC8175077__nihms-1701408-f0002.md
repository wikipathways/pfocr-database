caption: 'Intracellular free Neu5Ac metabolism comprises three processes:(A) Cytoplasmic
  free Neu5Ac biosynthesis is initiated with the conversion of UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc) in a few enzymatic steps to Neu5Ac, which is activated in the nucleus
  to CMP-Neu5Ac and then transported back to the cytosol [, , ]. Cytosolic CMP-Neu5Ac
  is transported into the Golgi by SLC35A1 [] where it serves as a substrate for sialyltransferases
  that sialylate nascent glycans []. Cytosolic CMP-Neu5Ac also strongly feedback-inhibits
  the first committed enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis, UDP-GlcNAc 2 epimerase,
  providing negative feedback regulation of de novo cytoplasmic Neu5Ac synthesis [,
  ].(B) Intralysosomal free Neu5Ac salvage occurs through recycling of glycans (glycoproteins,
  gangliosides) through endocytosis by the endo-lysosomal system, where lysosomal
  enzymes degrade the glycans into their individual building block molecules, including
  individual monosaccharides. Free Neu5Ac is released from glycans by neuraminidase
  enzymes [, ]. Neu5Ac is then transported from the lysosomal lumen into the cytosol
  by SLC17A5 [].(C) The fate of salvaged free Neu5Ac in the cytoplasm is unclear.
  A portion may be excreted from the cell, recycled in the Neu5Ac biosynthesis pathway
  for direct synthesis of CMP-Neu5Ac, or degraded/catabolized by N-acetylneuraminate
  pyruvate lyase (NPL) [] into ManNAc and pyruvate. The ManNAc generated in the cytoplasm
  can either directly re-enter the Neu5Ac biosynthesis pathway or can be converted
  to N-acetylglycosamine (GlcNAc) for entry in the hexosamine pathway [].Several rare
  genetic disorders are associated with these pathways: (1) GNE myopathy (MIM#605820;
  ~950 reported cases []); (2) N-acetylneuraminic acid phosphate synthase (NANS) deficiency
  (MIM#605202; ~9 cases []); and (3) deficiency of SLC35A1, CDGIIf (MIM#603585; ~3
  cases []) are characterized by decreased sialylation of glycans; (4) Sialidosis
  (MIM#256550; >100 cases []) is characterized by lysosomal accumulation of sialylated
  glycans. Three disorders are associated with increased urinary excretion of free
  Neu5Ac: (5) Sialuria (MIM#269921; ~ 11 cases []); (6) FSASD (MIM#269920, #604369;
  ~200 cases []); and (7) NPL deficiency (2 cases []).'
