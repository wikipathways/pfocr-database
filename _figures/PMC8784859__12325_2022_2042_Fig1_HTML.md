caption: IL-6R system. IL-6 acts through different signal transduction pathways. In
  the classical pathway, IL-6 binds to the transmembrane form of its receptor, IL-6R,
  which dimerizes. The complex formed binds to the membrane protein gp130 and downstream
  signaling and gene expression are activated. In the trans pathway, the complex formed
  by IL-6 and sIL-6R binds to the glycoprotein gp130 and intracellular signal transduction
  begins
