caption: 'IL-15 binds to the IL-15Rα expressed on antigen-presenting cells and then
  is presented in trans to IL-2/IL-15Rβγ heterodimer on NK cells []. IL-15 induces
  activation of JAK1/STAT3 via the β chain and JAK3/STAT5 via the γ chain [–]. Phosphorylated
  STAT3 and STAT5 proteins translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription
  of the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 [] and MCL-1[] and the oncogene c-Myc [,].
  Activated adaptor protein Shc promotes Gab2 phosphorylation through the adaptor
  Grb2, and then induces the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling []. XBP1 is induced
  by AKT and translocates to the nucleus, where it promotes GZMB expression []. mTORC1
  drives the E4BP4-Eomes-CD122 pathway [,]. The third RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway induces
  the activation of c-Fos, c-Jun, and c-Myc, which promote NK cell proliferation [].
  There are also some intracellular checkpoints that negatively regulate IL-15 signaling.
  CIS interacts with JAK1 and inhibits its enzymatic activity []. ZHX2 blocks STAT5
  activation []. SOCS-2 inhibits STAT5 phosphorylation []. OTUB1 inhibits AKT phosphorylation
  []. TIPE2 suppresses mTOR activity []. Foxo1 binds to the Tbx21 promoter and inhibits
  T-bet transcription []. Abbreviations: JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; XBP1, X-box binding protein 1; GZMB, granzyme B;
  E4BP4, E4 promoter-binding protein 4; Eomes, eomesodermin; CIS, cytokine-inducible
  Src homology 2–containing protein; ZHX2, zinc fingers and homeoboxes; OTUB1, OTU
