caption: 'Memory system‐related genes in vertebrates and their roles. Learning induces
  the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and neuronal growth factors such
  as BDNF, which activate various receptor families and allow the recruitment of several
  intracellular signaling pathways, including second messengers and protein kinases.
  These signaling pathways control the following processes: 1) posttranslational modifications
  such as phosphorylation of postsynaptic glutamatergic receptors; 2) activation of
  the CREB‐mediated gene cascade, which triggers the expression of target genes such
  as IEGs (Zif268, c‐Fos, and C/EBP), thereby regulating the expression of late response
  genes, which are essential for long‐term structural and functional neuronal changes.
  The expression of these genes is regulated by many posttranscriptional and translational
  mechanisms, for example, the mTOR pathway, as well as by epigenetic mechanisms involving
  DNA methylation and histone methylation (M) and/or acetylation. This figure was
  modified from Alberini et al., 2017 [].'
