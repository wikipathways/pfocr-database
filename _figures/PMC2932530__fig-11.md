caption: Integration of redox signaling. An increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  can result in either cell survival or cell death, depending on the integration of
  the proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signals. The levels and durations of ROS stress
  determine the activation or inhibition of each signal-transduction pathway. The
  crosstalk between PI3K/Akt and stress-responsive MAPK pathway (SAPK) serves as an
  example. A low level or transient increase of ROS can activate PI3K/Akt, leading
  to cell survival through NF-κB. The predominant survival signals of the Akt and
  NF-κB pathways prevent cell death by inhibiting ASK1 and JNK, respectively. However,
  a high level of ROS causes a sustained activation of the ASK1-JNK cascade and inactivation
  of PI3K/Akt and NF-κB due to protein oxidation, leading to cell death.
