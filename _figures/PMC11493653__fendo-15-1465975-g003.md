caption: 'Role of lncRNAs in main phases of diabetic wound healing. The lncRNAs depicted
  include H19, MALAT1, GAS5, HOTAIR, ANRIL, and KLF3-AS1. H19 participates in all
  phases of wound healing. It promotes inflammation through the regulation of the
  PPARγ/STAT3 pathway. In angiogenesis, H19 regulates PI3K-Akt signaling. H19 enhances
  the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes and inhibits pyroptosis by suppressing
  the activation of NLRP3. Conversely, H19 can also inhibit keratinocyte proliferation
  and migration by targeting miR-17-5p and upregulating RUNX1. MALAT1 promotes an
  anti-inflammatory response by targeting miR-1914-3p and activating MFGE8. Additionally,
  MALAT1 regulates the EMT in keratinocytes through the regulation of TGFβ1-induced
  EMT. GAS5 induces STAT1 to promote M1 macrophage activation, while its reduction
  favors M2 macrophage polarization and benefits wound healing. It also promotes angiogenesis
  by activating the HIF1A/VEGFA pathway. HOTAIR, ANRIL, and KLF3-AS1 are primarily
  involved in promoting angiogenesis: HOTAIR activates VEGF to enhance angiogenesis,
  ANRIL modulates the HIF1A/VEGFA pathway, and KLF3-AS1 promotes angiogenesis by targeting
  miR-383 and upregulating VEGFA expression. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs); extracellular
  matrix (ECM); milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 protein (MFGE8); peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (PPARY/STAT3);
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1); hypoxia-inducible factor
  1-alpha/Vascular endothelial growth factor A (HIF1A/VEGFA); Phosphatidylinositol-3
  Kinase-AKT (PI3K-Akt); Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); Transforming growth
  factor beta 1/Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (TGF-β1/EMT); NOD-like receptor
  family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)'
