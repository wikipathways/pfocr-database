caption: 'Schematic representation of alkane biosynthetic pathways. (a) Conversion
  of fatty aldehydes to alk(a/e)nes by FAR enzymes: CER (plant), CYP4G (insects),
  and ADO (cyanobacteria); (b) terminal alkene production by decarboxylation enzymes:
  OleT, UndA, and UndB; (c) internal alkene biosynthesis by head to head hydrocarbon
  biosynthetic enzyme, OleABCD consisting of thiolase (OleA), dehydrogenase/reductase
  (OleD), and lactone synthetase (OleBC complex); (d) alkene production by PKS pathway
  enzymes, Ols and SgcE-SgcE10. β-oxidation pathway is comprising of FadA (ketoacyl-CoA
  thiolase), FadB (fatty acid oxidation complex subunit alpha), FadD (long chain fatty
  acid CoA ligase), and FadE (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase).'
