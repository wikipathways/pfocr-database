caption: MB is involved in anti-inflammation by suppressing iNOS/NO-NF-κB pathway.
  (A) Basically, MB downregulates both eNOS and sGC that are major factors converting
  GTP to cGMP, ultimately leading to vasoconstriction. (B) Upon tissue injury, iNOS
  functions as a strong inflammatory mediator in different types of cells. It inhibits
  Sirt1 activation by NO-mediated S-nitrosylation, which in turn activates NF-κB and
  p53 to facilitate inflammatory cytokine expression and apoptosis, respectively.
  Of note, NF-κB activation intensifies these events by activating iNOS/NO-NF-κB pathway.
  Conversely, MB directly abates iNOS expression and moreover decreases the binding
  of NF-κB to iNOS promoter, which consequently interrupts this inflammatory signaling.
  (C) Meanwhile, NMDA receptors are activated during nerve injury and induces Ca2+
  influx, which then results in the excessive expression of nNOS and markedly activates
  nNOS/NO signaling. The increased NO production stimulates NMDA receptors and triggers
  NO/cGMP/PKG cascade, which promotes the subsequent BNDF upregulation and neurotransmitter
  release and ultimately induces long-term hyperexcitability and central sensitization.
  Notably, BDNF and peroxynitrite potentiate NMDA receptors, which stimulate nNOS
  expression again. However, MB weakens these responses by inhibiting nNOS and sGC
  activation, thus may prevent the development of persistent pain.LTH, long-term hyperexcitability;
  STZ, sensitization; NT, neurotransmitter; CP, chronic pain.
