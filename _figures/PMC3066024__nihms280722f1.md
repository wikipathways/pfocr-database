caption: '(a) Heteromerization is first involved on maturation, folding and receptor
  expression at the cell surface by modulating its targeting from the endoplasmic
  reticulum or internalization. (b) At the plasma membrane, GPCR heteromerization
  can induce positive (+) or negative (−) cooperative ligand binding leading to specific
  pharmacological profiles. (c) Heteromerization can have a functional role by promoting
  or attenuating the specific G-protein coupling of a single receptor constituting
  the heteromer. In some cases, this regulation can open to a new signaling pathway
  (to a new G protein coupling or to a switch to other signaling protein recruitment
  like β-arrestin recruitment). (R1: receptor 1, R2: receptor 2, L1: ligand 1, L2:
  ligand 2, G1: G protein 1, G2: G protein 2, G3: G protein 3, ER: endoplasmic reticulum)'
