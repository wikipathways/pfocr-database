  assisted mucormycosis in the immunocompromised diabetic individual,,(Created withBioRender.com).
  (a) In COVID-19 severity, (b) uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and overdrive of Corticosteroid
  drugs increases the vulnerability to Mucorales infection due to diabetic ketoacidosis
  (DKA) and hyperglycemia. (c) An elevation in the glucose level of the adipose tissue
  induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, cellular hypoxia, enhanced discharge
  of free fatty acids (FFA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and generate cytokine
  storm. (d) A diversified range of the cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1β), tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF), and various types of chemokines are released to the cellular
  hypoxic environment. (e) These cytokines especially TNF-α recruits the proinflammatory
  M1 macrophages and (f) inhibits the activity of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages.
  (g) The activated M1 macrophage again discharges more pro-inflammatory cytokines
  like IL-1β, FFA and generates ROS. (h) These FFA are also detected by TLR-4 in the
  tissue cells, initiating JNK-AP-I and IKK-NFkB (nuclear factor-kappa B) signalling.
  (i) Simultaneously, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) causes a low pH environment which
  ultimately enhances the cellular H+ ion level. (j) Due to the activity of hyperglycemia,
  iron-scavenging proteins like ferritin and transferrin show increased glycosylation
  in the blood vessel, which lowers their iron affinity. (k) Furthermore, in the attendance
  of an acidotic condition promoted by the creation of ketone bodies (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate
  [BHB]), the low pH environment in the blood vessels substantially restricts transferrin's
  ability to chelate iron. (l) As a result, the accessibility of free iron in the
  blood vessel is stimulated whereas (m) the counts of IFN-γ, CD4+, CD8+, and T-cell
  are sharply declined. (n) A combination of free iron, glucose, and BHB triggers
  epithelial fungal adhesion and tissular hyphal growth or opportunistic fungal infection.
  (o) This combination causes a stress response in ER, which drives to overexpression
  of the GRP78 protein. (p) The MTJ-1 chaperone aids in the translocation of GRP78
  proteins from ER to the cell surface. (q) Fungi battle with the host for the presence
  of iron in the siderophore system. (r) High glucose concentrations, free iron availability,
  and an acid microenvironment boost CotH expression on the fungal cell surface, facilitating
  GRP78/CotH3 contact for epithelial/endothelial invasion and fungal spread. (s) The
  connection between GRP78 and CotH is additionally aided by ROS, FFA, and cytokines.
  (t) Meanwhile, endothelial cells pursue to generate GRP78 in all partitions, and
  the hypha can connect with these proteins on the basal side and become internalized
  in the lumen of blood vessels. (u) They produce cell damage, thrombus formation,
  ischemia, prolonged hypoxia, tissue infarction, and finally necrosis by activating
  the external coagulation pathway.
