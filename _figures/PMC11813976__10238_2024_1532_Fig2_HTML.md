caption: Molecular mechanisms of STAT3 signaling pathway in CRC. Many tyrosine kinases,
  including RTKs with intrinsic enzyme activity like VEGFR, catalyze the phosphorylation
  of STAT3. Non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src and abl also aid in the phosphorylation
  of STAT3 by activating JAKs in combination with cytokine receptors such as the IL6
  receptor. Moreover, insufficient upstream regulation in CRC causes STAT3 activation
  to occur continuously. In colorectal cancer in particular, elevated P-STAT3 levels
  may be linked to a poor prognosis. Created in https://BioRender.com. CRC, colorectal
  cancer; RTKs, receptor tyrosine kinases; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor
  receptor; p-STAT, phosphorylated STAT
