  expression is shown in the heatmaps. One-step reactions are represented with solid
  lines while dashed lines represent multi-step reactions. Circles represent the metabolites
  in pathways and circles filled with red color represent the metabolites that were
  identified and significantly accumulated. FDFT1, farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase;
