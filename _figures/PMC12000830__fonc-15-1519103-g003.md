caption: 'MEG3 lncRNA: a key regulator of tumor suppression across multiple cancer
  pathways. The diagram illustrates the role of MEG3 in various cancers as a prognostic
  biomarker, therapeutic target, and enhancer of cis-platin sensitivity. In renal
  cell carcinoma, MEG3 inhibits the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, reducing tumor growth
  and promoting apoptosis. In ovarian cancer, it blocks angiogenesis and metastasis
  through specific miRNA pathways. MEG3 also induces apoptosis in bladder cancer and
  inhibits metastasis by downregulating oncogenes. In cervical cancer, MEG3 promotes
  apoptosis by inhibiting miR-21-5p and STAT3. It reduces cell growth in testicular
  cancer by regulating miR-1297. In endometrial cancer, MEG3 inhibits tumor growth
  by suppressing the Notch and PI3K/mTOR pathways, while in prostate cancer, it prevents
  metastasis through H3K27 trimethylation'
