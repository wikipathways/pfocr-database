caption: '(Summary illustration): Three USPs regulate Imd activation or stability
  and downstream signalling. Three ubiquitin specific proteases regulate the Imd pathway,
  USP34 is putatively acting at the level of NF-κB like factors associated complexes
  (Rel in the case of Imd pathway) while USP2 and USP36 differentially targets the
  scaffolding molecule Imd by hydrolysing UbK48 (this study) and UbK63 [[]] chains,
  respectively. Imd is subjected to a permanent turn-over via the linkage of UbK48
  ubiquitin chains and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This prevents Imd accumulation
  and constitutive signal activation in unchallenged conditions. The deubiquitinating
  enzyme USP2 is required for both UbK48 hydrolysis and Imd degradation at the level
  of the proteasome. In response to an immune challenge, the activity of the E3 ligase
  would be prevented resulting in the observed Imd stabilisation and accumulation.
  It has been previously described that Imd activation in response to immune challenge
  results in its cleavage by Dredd and linkage of UbK63 by Iap2 [[]]. USP36 deubiquitinates
  Imd linked UbK63 thus preventing inappropriate or excessive signal transduction
  and putatively promoting ubiquitin chain editing through the replacement of activating
  UbK63 by UbK48 degradative chains [[]].'
