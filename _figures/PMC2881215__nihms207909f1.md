caption: Signaling in podocyte apoptosis. Activation of p38 and TGF-β signaling pathways
  leads to the apoptosis of podocytes. TGF-β is activated in podocytes by reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), which are known to accumulate in podocytes exposed to advanced
  glycation end products and hyperglycemia. The level of TGF-β is increased in injured
  kidneys of several chronic kidney diseases. TGF-β increases the expression of proapoptotic
  genes by activating transcription factors such as NF- κ B and p53. Disruption of
  the PINCH-1-integrin-linked kinase and α-parvin complex (PIP) by TGF-β activates
  p38 []. Phosphorylation of p38 leads to the activation of the apoptosis machinery
  in podocytes. Advanced glycation end products (AGE) activate p38 and trigger the
  apoptosis of podocytes in a FOXO4-dependent manner []. AGE also reduces AKT phosphorylation.
  Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by nephrin/CD2AP, darbepoetin-α, and glialderived
  neurotrophic factor (GDNF) protects podocytes from apoptosis.
