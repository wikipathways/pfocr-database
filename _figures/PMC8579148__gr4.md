caption: mTOR and ERK signaling in adhesion and autophagy mTOR is a master autophagic
  regulator, activity of which is activated under nutrient-rich conditions. When energetic
  demands are sufficient, active mTOR associates with the mTORC1 complex to suppress
  autophagy by phosphorylating Atg13 and Ulk1 to reduce Atg13/Ulk1 association, which
  blocks the autophagosome initiation complex. Starvation inactivates mTORC1, preventing
  phosphorylation of Atg13 and Ulk1 and allowing for their association and initiation
  of autophagosome formation. mTOR also associates with the mTORC2 complex, which
  can upregulate chaperone-mediated autophagy. Active mTORC2 phosphorylates the actin
  cytoskeleton to aid in polymerization and rearrangement, which facilitates neuronal
  potentiation. Additionally, mTOR activity intersects with adhesion. IGF-1 is an
  upstream activator of mTOR signaling that activates adhesion through integrins and
  AKT signaling. In various cell types, inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 reduces
  adhesion, perhaps in part through the role mTORC2 plays in stabilization of the
  actin cytoskeleton. Additionally, integrin-targeting antibodies activate AMPK signaling
  that leads to mTORC1 inhibition and mTORC2 activation. ERK signaling, which can
  be initiated by extracellular signals such as Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), intersects
  with the mTOR pathway by inhibiting TSC1/2, an upstream inhibitor of mTORC1. FAK
  phosphorylation inhibits ERK, disinhibiting TSC1/2, which reduces mTORC1 activity
  to increase autophagic activity. These signaling pathways aid in functions related
  to action potential, actin rearrangement, and angiogenesis within the brain. Solid
  arrows are indicative of a direct interaction, dashed arrows an indirect interaction.
