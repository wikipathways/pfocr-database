caption: Postulated mechanism of neuroprotection against endogenous reactive oxygen
  species-mediated oxidative stress and damage by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
  The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide (O2•–), hydrogen
  peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (HO•), occurs via numerous physiological processes
  and is enhanced by some xenobiotics. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a
  cytoplasmic enzyme, catalyzes the first step in the hexose monophosphate shunt,
  also known as the pentose phosphate pathway. The end product of this pathway, ribose-5-phosphate,
  is required for nucleic acid synthesis, and hence is essential for cell growth.
  During the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate, G6PD generates
  reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), essential for catalase
  stability, many reductive biosynthetic pathways including cholesterol and fatty
  acid synthesis, and the regeneration of glutathione (GSH) from its oxidized form,
  glutathione disulfide (GSSG). Catalase and GSH (via GSH peroxidase) are essential
  for the elimination of H2O2, which, if not detoxified, can alter signal transduction
  pathways and/or, directly or indirectly via HO• formation, oxidatively damages cellular
  macromolecules (DNA, protein, lipid), thereby adversely affecting cellular function.
  G6PD protects the developing embryo from the pathological effects of endogenous
  oxidative stress, as well as from xenobiotic-enhanced ROS formation and teratogenesis,
  and may similarly protect the brain from the neurodegenerative consequences of endogenous
  ROS-mediated macromolecular damage that accumulates during aging.
