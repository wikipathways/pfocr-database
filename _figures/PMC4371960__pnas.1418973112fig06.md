caption: Model for E2-induced signal transduction pathways in the uterine epithelium
  leading to DNA and protein synthesis. E2 binds to its receptor, ESR1, thereby conveying
  a signal to stimulate DNA and protein synthesis in the uterine epithelium. In the
  case of DNA synthesis, this is through an IGF1-mediated paracrine pathway (dotted
  red line indicates the interface between stromal and epithelial cells) that results
  in cyclin D1 being accumulated in the epithelial nuclei. This pathway is inhibited
  by P4 (). At the same time E2 stimulates another pathway in either an autocrine
  or paracrine manner, which remains to be determined via PKC to mTOR to stimulate
  protein synthesis. This PKC-stimulated pathway runs in parallel to the IGF1-mediated
  one but unlike the IGF1R pathway, this pathway is not inhibited by P4. Nevertheless
  it too is required for successful entry into DNA synthesis following E2 stimulation.
