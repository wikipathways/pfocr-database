caption: Radiation can stimulate the immune response and induce immunogenic cell death
  in several ways. It activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway
  that induce type‐1 interferon (IFN) response which aids in the recruitment and activation
  of dendritic cells (DCs). Radiation can induce various damageassociated molecular
  pattern (DAMP) molecules including calreticulin, high‐mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)
  and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). All these DAMPs promote activation of DCs and
  increase antigenpresentation to the naïve T cells, which then convert to effector
  T cells. Radiation also increases the expression of major histocompatibility complex
  class I (MHC‐I) that present antigens to T cells, and Fas death receptor that can
  induce apoptotic cell death of the tumour cells. Radiation increases the migration
  of tumour‐infiltrating T cells to the tumour region that is required for tumour
  recognition and anti‐tumour effect. The immunosuppressive effects of radiation are
  mediated by radiation‐induced increase in the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells
  such as regulatory T cells, myeloid‐derived suppressor cells and M2‐type macrophages,
  and increase in the generation of anti‐inflammatory cytokines including transforming
  growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β). The immunosuppressive cells and cytokines can impair
  anti‐tumour immune responses, thus sustaining immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment.
