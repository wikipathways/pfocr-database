caption: 'The phenotypic and seed coat structure and the gene expression profiles
  related to cutin and wax biosynthetic pathways in aerial and subterranean seeds
  in A. edgeworthii. (a) The comparison of the phenotype and seed coat anatomy by
  staining cross‐section and electron microscope scanning of aerial and subterranean
  seeds. The image of aerial and subterranean seeds with bar = 1 cm (top), seed coat
  structure of aerial seeds (middle), and subterranean seeds (bottom) with bar = 10 μm.
  Abbreviations: C = cuticle, H = hourglass cell, Pal = palisade cell layer, Par = parenchyma
  cell layer; (b) The cutin and wax biosynthetic pathways and related gene expression
  in aerial and subterranean seeds. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of plant epidermal
  cells, both cutin and wax synthesis initiate from C16/C18‐CoA. Very‐long‐chain acyl‐CoAs
  resulting from the fatty acid elongase (FAE) complex with CER6, CER10, PAS2, and
  KCR1 and then divides into the alcohol‐forming pathway to produces very‐long‐chain
  (VLC)‐primary alcohols (1’ alcohols) and wax esters and the alkane‐forming pathway
  that leads to the formation of VLC‐alkanes alcohols (2’ alcohols) and ketones. And
  cutin was synthesized through 16‐OH C16‐CoA, 10,16‐diOH C16‐CoA and 10,16‐diOH C16‐Glycerol
  with long‐chain acyl‐coenzyme A synthase (LACS), CYP86 subfamily of cytochrome P450s
  (CYP86Y4), CYP77 subfamily encoded midchain hydroxylase (CYP77A6), and Glycerol‐3‐phosphate
  acyltransferase (GPAT 6). The wax and cutin precursor were exported from the plasma
  membrane (PM) to the extracellular matrix by ABC transporters (ABCG11 and 32) and
  delivered to the cuticle.'
