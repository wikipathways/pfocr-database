caption: HSV-1-mediated evasion of the RLR and TLR signaling pathway. TLRs are located
  at both the plasma membrane and endosomes. They sense different ligands like viral
  dsRNA, dsDNA, and glycoproteins; transduce signals through TRIF and MyD88; and then
  lead the activation of IRFs and NF-κB. RIG-I and MDA5 detect distinct RNA structures
  and signal through the adaptor protein MAVS protein to trigger IRF3 and NF-κB activation.
  The IFN-I and inflammatory cytokines are induced for antiviral immunity. HSV-1 proteins
  can hijack multiple steps downstream of RLR and TLR signaling pathways. Solid lines
  indicate confirmed interactions between adaptors and HSV-1 proteins. Dashed lines
  indicate uncertain interactions or that the underlying mechanism is unknown. CBP,
  CREB-binding protein; P, phosphate; U, ubiquitin.
