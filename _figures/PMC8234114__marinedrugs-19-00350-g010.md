caption: The proposed Avi A biosynthetic pathway (the blue branch is for dichloroisoeverninic
  acid (moiety A), the orange one is for d-olivose (residues B and C) and 2-deoxy-d-evalose
  (residue D), the pink branch is for d-fucose (residue E) and methyleurekanate (residue
  H), while the green one is for d-mannose (residue F) and l-lyxose (residue G); the
  content in the square bracket represents the published year of genes. The genes
  in the Avi A biosynthetic gene cluster mentioned above are experimentally defined
  by proteomic studies.
