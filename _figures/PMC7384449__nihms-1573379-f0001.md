caption: The heme synthetic pathway. Heme is a 4-ring porphyrin molecule that is a
  used as a cofactor in many kinds of enzymes, including hemoglobin. Its synthesis
  requires 8 enzymatic conversion steps (numbered 1–8). The necessary enzymes are
  ALAS, aminolevulinic acid synthase; ALAD, aminolevulinic acid dehydratase; PBGD,
  porphobilinogen deaminase; UCS, uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase; UDC, uroporphyrinogen
  decarboxylase; CPO, coproporphyrinogen oxidase; PPO, protoporphyrinogen oxidase;
  FC, ferrochelatase. In the final reaction step, catalyzed by ferrochelatase, an
  atom of iron is inserted into the protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) molecule. The system
  is normally shut off by negative feedback inhibition at the first step, but this
  can be bypassed by adding large amounts of exogenous 5-ALA, which leads to accumulation
  of high levels of PpIX. Adapted from ref. ().
