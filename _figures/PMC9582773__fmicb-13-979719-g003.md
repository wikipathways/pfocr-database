caption: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) enhances oxidative
  stress and atherosclerosis progression. [1] SARS-CoV-2 structure. [2] SARS-CoV-2
  viruses facilitate oxidative stress and inflammation in the arterial intima. Native
  C-reactive protein (nCRP), a marker of severe SARS-CoV-2 produced in liver, macrophages,
  lymphocytes, smooth muscle cells (SMC) and other cells, promotes inflammation through
  monomeric CRP (mCRP) enhancing intimal oxidative stress. SARS-CoV-2 binds macrophage
  toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and facilitates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADP) H oxidase 2 (Nox2) activity and superoxide (O2−) production causing cysteine
  oxidation, disulfide bridge formation and S-glutathionylation. Xanthine oxidase
  (XO) and inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase further facilitate O2−
  cellular activity and ROS generation. SARS-CoV-2 can bind TLRs 2 and 4 and activate
  transcription factors like nuclear factor (NF)-κB facilitating cytokine storm and
  hyperinflammation. Excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation
  further enhances cytokine production. CRP (nCRP, mCRP) can facilitate macrophage
  and neutrophil uptake of SARS-CoV-2-infected apoptotic cells through Fcγ and Fcα
  receptors, respectively (FcRs). Oxidative stress also activates the Kelch-like ECH-associated
  protein 1 (Keap1)-Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 (Nrf2)-antioxidant
  response element (ARE) redox regulator pathway in monocytes (see [3] and macrophages,
  releasing Nrf2 to regulate the expression of genes that control antioxidant enzymes
  like glutathione S-transferase (GST)), facilitating glutathione (GSH) activity.
  Macrophages, Tlymphocytes, neutrophils and SMCs can generate mCRP increasing inflammation.
  [3] Monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, endothelial cells and microparticles can
  generate mCRP, increase O2− and ROS formation and reactive nitrogen species like
  peroxinitrite (ONOO−), and tissue factor (TF) expression enhancing oxidation, inflammation
  and thrombosis. TLR 4-mediated SARS-CoV-2-binding to platelets promotes thrombosis,
  mCRP binding to lipid rafts and FcγRs enhances inflammation and endothelial activation
  allows intimal cell migration. [4] Foam cells and smooth muscle cells associated
