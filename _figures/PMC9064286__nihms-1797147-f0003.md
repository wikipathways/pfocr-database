caption: 'Diverse factors affect the sensitivity of tumors to GLS inhibitors, and
  specific oncogenotypes and metabolic stresses (shown in orange) can lock cancer
  cells into a GLS-dependent state. High activity of the NRF2-antioxidant response
  pathway has emerged as a conserved biomarker for tumor GLS dependence and can occur
  through genetic activation of the pathway (for example by loss-of-function mutations
  in KEAP1) or through factors that impose sustained oxidative stress, such as IDH1/2
  mutations that lead to neomorphic 2-hydroxyglutarate-producing enzymes. Expression
  of GLS is regulated by c-Myc and c-Jun, and high levels of these transcription factors
  also favor cellular dependence on GLS. The nutrient environment also influences
  sensitivity to GLS inhibitors, and excessive levels of extracellular cystine can
  drive glutamine addiction and GLS dependence by forcing glutamate efflux through
  the cystine/glutamate antiporter xCT/SLC7A11. Other factors promote resistance to
  GLS inhibitors (shown in blue). These factors include compensatory metabolic pathways
  such as pyruvate carboxylation, fatty acid oxidation, and glutamine hydrolysis catalyzed
  by GLS2. mTORC1 can enhance metabolic flexibility by regulating a shift to glucose
  metabolism, and mTORC1 inhibitors synergize with GLS inhibitors.Abbreviations: α-KG,
  α-ketoglutarate; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; GCL, glutamate-cysteine
  ligase; GLS, glutaminase; GPNA, L-γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase;
  KEAP1, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin;
  NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; OAA, oxaloacetate; PC, pyruvate
  carboxylase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TME, tumor microenvironment.'
