caption: ApoE lipidation process. Astrocytic ApoE is the main source of ApoE in the
  brain. To accomplish its functions, after being synthesized, ApoE must be lipidated
  with cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids. The ApoE lipidation process
  begins when ABCA1 translocates lipids to the plasma membrane, binds to the free
  form of apolipoproteins, and promotes their acceptance of the lipids translocated.
  The internalization of ApoE-lipid complexes by neurons is mediated by receptors
  like HSPG, LDLR, and LDLRP. The degree of lipidation, size, and content of ApoE-lipid
  complexes are isoform dependent; ApoE4 is poorly lipidated when compared to the
  other isoforms. When ApoE is not lipidated, it can form toxic aggregates in the
  neurons that can evade the secretory pathway, stimulate tau phosphorylation, and
  cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Lipidated ApoE has higher Aβ binding affinity than
  delipidated molecules, which enhances the clearance of Aβ through the blood stream
  and prevents its accumulation.
