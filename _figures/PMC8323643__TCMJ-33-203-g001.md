caption: Interleukin-10 signaling pathway. Binding of interleukin-10 to its receptor
  causes phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2. Once phosphorylated, JAK1 further phosphorylates
  signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 through AMPK. The signal transducer
  and activator of transcription-3 translocates into the nucleus and upregulates anti-inflammatory
  genes. Interleukin-10 also activates PI3K/Akt/mTOC pathway and inhibits GSK3β to
  promote anti-inflammatory responses. Interleukin-6, on the contrary, also activates
  signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 pathway. However, it upregulates
  pro-inflammatory genes and causes inflammatory response. The signal transducer and
  activator of transcription-3 signaling can be inhibited by the suppressor of cytokine
  signaling 3
