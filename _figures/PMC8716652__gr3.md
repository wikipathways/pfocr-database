caption: Proposed model of 3p21.31 locus influence on progression to type 1 diabetes.
  Individuals with high risk CCR2 genotypes are more prone to increased CCR2 expression,
  increased CCR2/CCL2 axis signaling with subsequent depletion of serum CCL2, increased
  monocyte recruitment, and increased rate of pancreatic islet destruction, resulting
  in an increased rate of progression to type 1 diabetes. Created with BioRender.com.
