caption: 'Biodegradation pathway of MC-LR by Sphingopyxis sp. YF1. A potential connection
  was found between the mlrABCD gene cluster and the paa gene clusters involved in
  the degradation of phenylacetic acid (PAA). The process of degradation proceeded
  as follows: sequentially, MC-LR was broken down into linearized MC-LR, Adda, and
  tetrapeptide. After that, Adda was broken down into PAA, and PAAase was then changed
  into PAA-CoA. PAA-CoA was further broken down to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)
  by PaaA homologs PaaG and PaaZ. Ultimately, acetyl-CoA was entirely transformed
  into CO2 by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Based on available data, it is highly
  probable that PAA is the subsequent metabolic product resulting from Adda’s conversion
  to PAA [141]'
