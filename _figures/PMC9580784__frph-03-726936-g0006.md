caption: Summary of the signaling cascade triggered by cannabinoid receptor activation
  in endometriosis. A summary of the downstream signal alteration upon cannabinoid
  receptor activation is outlined in this schematic representation. Protein kinases,
  such as MAPK (p38) and PI3K/Akt family members, are involved in cell growth, migration,
  and survival under normal circumstances. Endometrial tissues have been identified
  to possess higher activity of kinases such as MAPK and Akt, which contribute to
  increased proliferation. Protein levels assessed in this study show that CB1 and
  CB2 receptor activation by WIN 55 leads to downstream modulation of important MAPK
  family proteins, such as Erk 1/2, p38, JNK, c-JUN, p53 and HSP27, as well as PI3K/Akt
  axis to trigger autophagy and eventually apoptosis through caspase-dependent and/or
  independent pathway. The use of red and green colors within the labeling represents
  downregulation and upregulation, respectively.
