caption: 'Role of guanylate-binding protein-1 in colorectal carcinoma and inflammatory
  bowel diseases. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), guanylate-binding protein (GBP)-1
  expression is associated with a Th1-dominated micromileu and results in an angiostatic
  vasculature. In CRC tumor cells, expression of GBP-1 induces an anti-tumorigenic
  phenotype. Absence of expression in tumor cells in a GBP-1-positive context indicates
  a mechanism of resistance. In T-cells, GBP-1 participates in the modulation of the
  T-cell receptor signaling pathway. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), GBP-1 expression
  is elevated in active disease and inhibits the proliferation of intestinal epithelial
  cells, thereby exerting a protective effect against the loss of barrier function
  and apoptosis. Here again, GBP-1 is associated with angiostasis and T-cell regulation.
