caption: 'Partial mechanisms of M1 and M2 TAMs polarization. i: PTEN-deficient GBM
  cells activate PI3K/AKT pathway, which suppresses IRF1 degradation by phosphorylating
  glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3β) into an inactive form. Then, upregulated Gal-9
  interacts with Tim3 to promote the polarization of M2 TAMs. ii: Chemerin binding
  with CMKLR1 activates NF-κB pathway, which promotes M2 polarization. iii: JMJD1C
  upregulates miR-302a by promoting H3K9 demethylation at the promoter region, then
  negatively regulating the expression of METTL3. Therefore, downregulated METTL3
  inhibits SOCS2 degradation by inhibiting m6A methylation modification to promote
  M1 polarization. iv: CHI3L1 regulated by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in a positive
  feedback loop binds with Gal3-activating NF-κB pathway to promote M2 polarization.
