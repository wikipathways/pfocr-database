caption: The genetic or environmental factors may influence the abnormal expression
  of glycosyltransferase and glycosidase in plasma cells or B cells. The decreasing
  sialylation and core fucosylation as well as increasing the bisecting GlcNAc contents
  within the Fc domain of IgG could activate its antibody-dependent cell mediated
  cytotoxicity (ADCC) by reducing inhibition to ligate Fcγ-RIIIa on natural killer
  (NK) cells, macrophage, and neutrophil which could release proinflammatory factors
  (such as IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, TNF-α, and IFN-γ). Decreased IgG Fc sialylation could
  reduce its complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity via C1q binding, which
  could lead to increase activation of the lectin-initiated complement pathway. These
  changes of the IgG N-glycan may make them possible from anti-inflammatory to proinflammatory
  effects upon antigenic challenge. The central nervous system and peripheral immune
  system exchanged in bi-directional ways. Activated peripheral immune cells that
  can penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) may regulate cognitive impairment, which
  include inhibiting angiogenic, neurotrophic, and neuroprotective mechanisms. Consequently,
  distinct differences in IgG glycosylation pattern in MCI might play a cascading
  role in the progression of dementia. Besides, persistent inflammation related to
  atherosclerosis also might provide a possible explanation for the pathogenesis of
  cerebrovascular disease (such as hypertension in midlife and diabetes), which could
  increase risk of MCI and dementia. Arrows indicate a contributory effect.
