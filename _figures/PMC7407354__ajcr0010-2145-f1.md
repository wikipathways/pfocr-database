caption: 'The scheme of the amino acid (AA)-related energy metabolic pathway shows
  the amino acids and their metabolites in the nontumor and tumor regions. Amino acids
  are categorized as ketogenic AAs or glucogenic AAs, based on their metabolic precursors.
  The former group consists of the precursors of common acetyl-CoA or acetoacetyl-CoA.
  The latter group is further subdivided into the precursors of pyruvate, α-ketoglutamate,
  succinyl-CoA, fumarate, and malate. Some AAs belong to both categories, but in the
  present study, the ketogenic AAs are Phe, Try, Lys, and Leu; the pyruvate precursor
  AAs are Ser, Gly, Thr, Ala, Trp, and Cys; the α-ketoglutamate precursor AAs are
  Pro, Arg, Glu, and Gln; the succinyl-CoA precursor AAs are Val, Ile, Met, and Thr.
  The AA-related energy metabolism occurs in the mitochondria, which have a pink background,
  and in the cytoplasm, which has an uncolored background. The concentrations of AAs
  and metabolites are presented by the tissue total protein level (nmol/mg total protein)
  and as the mean ± the standard error. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, †P<0.001, and ‡P<0.0001
  indicate the significant difference levels, analyzed using the paired Student’s
  t-test. Abbreviation: 2KB, 2-ketobutyrate; 2HB, 2-hydroxybutyrate; 3HIB, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate;
