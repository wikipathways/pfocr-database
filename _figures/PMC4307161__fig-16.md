caption: 'Multiple pharmacological actions of AOAA. By simultaneously inhibiting CBS
  activity and inhibiting glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1), a key enzyme
  of the malate/aspartate shuttle, AOAA acts as an inducer of “synthetic lethality”
  in cancer cells. CBS-derived H2S supports mitochondrial electron transport and cancer
  cell bioenergetics by donating electrons at complex II. By inhibiting CBS, AOAA
  suppresses this bioenergetic pathway. The malate-aspartate shuttle translocates
  electrons that are produced in glycolysis across the semipermeable inner membrane
  of the mitochondrion, in order to support oxidative phosphorylation. These electrons
  enter the electron transport chain at complex I. The shuttle system is required,
  because the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NADH (a primary reducing
  equivalent of the electron transport chain). In humans, the cytoplasmic enzyme (GOT1)
  is one of the key enzymes in the malate shuttle: It functions to catalyze the interconversion
  of aspartate and α-ketoglutarate to oxaloacetate and glutamate using PLP as a cofactor.
  By inhibiting GOT1, AOAA reduces the transfer of electron donors to the mitochondria,
  thereby suppressing cancer cell bioenergetics. By the simultaneous inhibition of
  CBS and GOT1, AOAA interferes with two key pathways of cancer cell mitochondrial
  function. In addition, by inhibiting G0T1 (also termed CAT), AOAA may have additional
  inhibitory effects on mitochondrial H2S production by reducing the substrate level
  of 3-MST and thereby indirectly inhibiting its activity. Moreover, AOAA may also
  inhibit several additional PLP-dependent enzymes in the cell, including the cytosolic
  enzyme CSE. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred to the web
