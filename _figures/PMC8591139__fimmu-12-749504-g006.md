caption: Simplified, working models for metabolic responses to conidia and hyphae
  in airway epithelial cells and their dependency on Nlrx1. (A) Simplified representation
  of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, ROS, and
  superoxide production. Modulation of these pathway in response to (B) conidia and
  (D) hyphae by wild-type cells. Relative modulation of these pathways in response
  to (C) conidia and (E) hyphae by Nlrx1-deficient cells in comparison to wild type.
