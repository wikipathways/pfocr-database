caption: Under normal condition (left column), the MPK3/6 was inactive, and the callose
  was localized in the cell wall. Upon ToCV infection (right column), the MPK3/6 was
  activated. ToCV P7 interacts with NbMPK3/6 and inhibits the entry of NbMPK3/6 into
  the nucleus. P7 then inhibits the immune response mediated by NbMPK3/6 and promotes
  ToCV replication. Subsequently, NbMPK3/6 phosphorylates P7 at S59. The phosphorylated
  P7 and NbMPK3 then localized to the plasma membrane. The phosphorylated P7 targets
  NbREM1.1 at the plasma membrane to inhibit its callose-inducing activity to promote
  ToCV movement in N. benthamiana plants
