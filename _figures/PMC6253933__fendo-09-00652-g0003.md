caption: SIRT7 maintains genome stability through multiple pathways. Under stress
  conditions, SIRT7 participates in the maintenance of genome stability via multiple
  mechanisms. (A) SIRT7 is recruited to DSBs in a PARP1-dependent manner to catalyze
  desuccinylation of H3K122 at DSBs to promote chromatin condensation. (B) SIRT7 can
  deacetylate p53 to inhibit apoptosis. (C) SIRT7 exerts a protective role during
  genomic insults by attenuating the DNA damage response (preventing γH2AX and p53
  accumulation) and the stress-activated MAPK pathway (p38 and JNK activity inhibition).
  The upregulation of Dicer in cytoplasm promotes SIRT7 translocation from the nucleus
  to the cytoplasm, thereby causing a decrease in chromatin-associated SIRT7 and elevated
  H3K18Ac levels. Besides, SIRT7 overexpression increases the efficiency of non-homologous
  end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). The recruitment of SIRT7 to
  sites of DNA damage by a PARP1-dependent manner also modulates H3K18Ac levels, thereby
  influencing 53BP1 recruitment to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to increase the
  efficiency of NHEJ.
