caption: Integration of environmental signals into spikelet initiation through florigen
  pathway. The florigen gene FT plays important role in response to environmental
  signals, including day length and temperature, which in turn promotes plant flowering
  by activating the expression of reproductive identity genes, such as MADS TFs SOC1
  and AP1 in Arabidopsis, OsMADS15, OsMADS14 and OsMADS18 in rice, VRN1 in wheat and
  barley. The nucleotide variations of genes involved in florigen pathway, such as
  Hd1, DTH8, Ghd7 and DTH7 in rice, VRN3 and VRN1 in wheat and barley, as well as
  duplication of FT family genes contribute to environmental adaptation, and could
  be targeted in plant breeding
