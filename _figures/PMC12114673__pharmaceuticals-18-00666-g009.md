caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the mechanism of CCNB1 in melanoma cells resisting
  NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. CCNB1, in complex with CDK1, leads to the phosphorylation
  and activation of STAT3. Activated STAT3 translocates to the nucleus, promoting
  the transcription of immune-suppressive molecules such as IL-6 and PD-L1, thereby
  inhibiting NK cell activity, as evidenced by the downregulation of CD69 and CD107a
  and reduced IFN-γ secretion. In addition, melanoma-derived IL-6 acts on NK cells
  to activate STAT3 signaling, which mediates NK cell dysfunction, including NKG2D
  downregulation. Furthermore, CCNB1 promotes the production of TGF-β in melanoma
  cells, which activates the SMAD2/3 pathway, thereby promoting the expression of
  EMT-related genes and enhancing melanoma invasiveness. By Figdraw
