caption: 'Schematic presentation of signaling mechanisms for the neuroprotective effects
  of NGR1. Hypoxia–ischemia results in the stimulation of PLC and PIP2 hydrolysis
  to IP3 and DAG, which triggers IP3-induced Ca2+ release and GRP78 dissociation with
  PERK and IRE1. This leads to the phosphorylation of PERK and IRE1. Phospho-PERK
  triggers the activation of CHOP, while phospho-IRE1 activates the inhibition of
  BCL-2. IP3-induced Ca2+ release also activates the phosphorylation of CaMKII, which
  leads to the stimulation of the p38/JNK pathway. NGR1 inhibits the stimulation of
  PLC and the above processes in the OGD/R case. PLC: phospholipase C; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; IP3: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.'
