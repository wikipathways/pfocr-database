caption: RNF proteins regulate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and its downstream ISGs.
  The antiviral activities of IFN-I are initiated by binding to their cognate receptor
  IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 to trigger a signaling cascade, namely JAK-STAT pathways. The
  activated JAKs then trigger the assembly of the ISGF3 complex, which imports into
  the nucleus to bind ISRE for ISG production. RNF proteins are responsible for positively
  (green arrows) or negatively (red T-shaped solid line) modulating the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway and its downstream ISGs. P, phosphate
