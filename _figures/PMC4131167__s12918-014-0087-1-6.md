caption: Rewiring of apoptosis pathway in breast cancer patients with and without
  recurrence. Red edges are unique connections in patients with recurrent breast cancer,
  where inflammatory/immune response genes IL1B, NFκB and TNFα that are all linked
  to increased resistance to breast cancer treatment were found. Green edges are unique
  connections in patients with breast cancer that did not recur, where paths to both
  anti-apoptotic XIAP/AKT2 and proapoptotic BAX and BAD were formed.
