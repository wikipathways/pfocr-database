caption: Mechanisms mostly deemed to contribute to the development of APAs. (a) Somatic
  mutations in the genes KCNJ5, ATP1A1, and CLCN2 coding for Kir3.4, Na+/K+ ATPase,
  and ClC-2 channels cause membrane depolarization of zona glomerulosa, with ensuing
  increased influx of Ca2+ into the cells, whereas mutations in CACNA and ATP2B3 genes,
  which code for Cav1.3 and plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPase, directly
  cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. In both cases the final result is
  enhanced CYP11B2 expression and increased aldosterone production. For a list of
  mutations, see . (b) Wnts are secreted proteins that control growth and stem cell
  renewal, acting via canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways. The canonical Wnt signaling
  is activated by the binding of Wnt to a serpentine Frizzled receptor (Fzd) and the
  coreceptor LRP5/6, which lead to recruitment of Dishevelled protein Dsh and disassembly
  of the β-catenin destruction complex. β-catenin, free to move toward the nucleus,
  binds to the TCF/LEF1 proteins, triggering transcription of genes involved in growth.
  When activated by the noncanonical Wnt pathway, Wnt first binds to Fzd and recruits
  Dsh to form a complex that activates the Rho-associated kinase pathway or phospholipase
  C, finally releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The increased Ca2+ can drive
  cell growth or aldosterone synthesis. (c) Hypomethylation of the promoter region
  of CYP11B2 activates gene transcription, thereby promoting aldosterone secretion.
  (d) Elevated levels of miRNA 23 (miR23) and miRNA 34 (miR34) can downregulate KCNJ5
  gene expression, blunting TASK2 synthesis, and finally enhancing aldosterone production.
