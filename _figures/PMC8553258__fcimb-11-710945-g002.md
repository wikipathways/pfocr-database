caption: Effects of microbiota on the trend of CPT11 chemotherapy efficacy and toxicity.
  Schematic presents the dualism’s functional role of microbiota in CPT11 chemotherapy.
  Lactobacillus spp, bifidobacterium spp, oncolytic viruses, and azide-modified phages
  can cooperate with CPT11, respectively, and exert immune activation, synergetic
  anti-proliferative and pro-apoptosis effect on tumor. That eventually enhances the
  anti-tumor efficacy on tumor. However, some microbes, such as Escherichia-shigella,
  Parasutterella, Streptococcus, Lactococcus, Staphylococcus and Clostridium difficile
  elicit a series of inflammation response by activating NF-κB pathway after infection
  of macrophages and epithelial cells, which aggravate the toxic reactions induced
  by CPT11, and impair chemotherapeutic outcome.
