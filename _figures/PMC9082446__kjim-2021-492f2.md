caption: Proposed scheme of indoxyl sulfate-induced neurotoxicity. Indoxyl sulfate
  disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. In addition, indoxyl sulfate
  inhibits organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) and efflux transport of endothelial
  cells, resulting in the accumulation of indoxyl sulfate in the brain. Furthermore,
  indoxyl sulfate increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in astrocytes, inhibiting
  the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and inducing apoptosis. Moreover,
  indoxyl sulfate binds with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and activates the signaling
  of AhR in astrocytes. The activated AhR inhibits the transcription of nitric oxide
  synthase (NOS), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-C motif
  chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), which show antiinflammatory effects. Finally, indoxyl
  sulfate suppresses nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signals in astrocytes, which promote
  inflammation and neurodegeneration in the CNS. NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2.
