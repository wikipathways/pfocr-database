caption: Fabrication of TE-NSPs. In order to create the cell aggregates, cells are
  first obtained from the ventral mesencephalon of transgenic rat embryos. In order
  to enrich the cell population for dopaminergic neurons, the cells are dissociated
  and run through a flow cytometer where fluorescent labels can be used to perform
  FACS. The purified cells are then centrifuged in custom, inverted PDMS wells to
  create cell aggregates. In order to generate the biomaterial micro-columns, agarose
  is gelled in a capillary tube containing a needle. Once the agarose has hardened,
  the needle is removed to create a hollow agarose tube, which is then filled with
  an ECM core. Lastly, the aggregates are inserted into the ends of the tubes, where
  they extend neurites over days to weeks in vitro.
