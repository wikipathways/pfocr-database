caption: '(1) Unmethylated Lefty gene permits high-level expression of Lefty by human
  embryonic stem cells (hESCs). (2) High methylation status of the Lefty gene in nonembryonic
  human adult stem cells (hSCs) and in human trophoblast cells may be responsible
  for the poorly detectable levels (dashed arrow) of Lefty in these cells. (3) hESC-derived
  Lefty is capable of inhibiting Nodal signaling by preventing Nodal from forming
  an active receptor complex with Cripto-1-Alk4/7-ActRIIB, necessary for proper Smad2/3/4-dependent
  downstream signaling. (4) Since the Lefty gene is also highly methylated in human
  aggressive melanoma cells (C8161), it is unlikely that the hESC microenvironment
  can induce Lefty expression in these cells. (5) miR-302a expressed in human aggressive
  melanoma cells after exposure to the hESC microenvironment can target and reduce
  Notch4 expression. (6) Binding of the γ-secretase (γ-SC) cleavage product, NICD,
  with an activator complex and the CBF-1/Su (H)/LAG-2 (CSL) transcription factor
  leads to induction of target genes, including Nodal. Since this Notch signaling
  can regulate Nodal expression during development, the interruption of this pathway
  could negatively affect Nodal expression in human melanoma cells. Epigenomic regulation
  of Nodal signaling by hESC-derived factors via miR302a or other miRNAs (7) would
  represent an alternate mechanism by which the hESC microenvironment could reprogram
  the aggressive phenotype of human aggressive melanoma. hSC: Human adult stem cell;
  NICD: Notch intracellular domain.'
