caption: The interferon-γ signaling pathway and mutations in its components found
  in human uterine leiomyosarcoma. After binding of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to the type
  II IFN receptor, Janus activated kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2 are activated and phosphorylate
  STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) on the tyrosine residue
  at position 701 (Tyr701). The tyrosine-phosphorylated form of STAT1 forms homodimers
  that translocate to the nucleus and bind GAS (IFN-γ-activated site) elements, which
  are present in the promoters of IFN-γ-regulated genes. The IFN-γ-activated JAKs
  also regulate, through as-yet-unknown intermediates, activation of the catalytic
  subunit (p110) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The activation of PI3K ultimately
  results in downstream activation of protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ), which in turm regulates
  phosphorylation of STAT1 on the serine residue at position 727 (Ser727). The phosphorylation
  of Ser727 is not essential for the translocation of STAT1 to the nucleus or for
  the binding of STAT1 to DNA, but it is required for full transcriptional activation.
  IFNGR1, IFN-γ receptor subunit 1; IFNGR2, IFN-γ receptor subunit 2. Investigation
  of human uterine LMS tissues (total of 14 cases of LMS tissue sections and normal
  tissue sections located in same tissue) for somatic mutations in the IFN-γ signal
  cascade, JAK1, JAK2, STAT1 and Lmp2 promoter region.
