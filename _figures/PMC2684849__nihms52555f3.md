caption: RNA polymerase III transcription is elevated during late G1, S, and G2 phases
  and becomes repressed during M and early G1 phases. A role for the protein kinase
  CK2 in M phase repression and S phase activation is indicated whereas RB is proposed
  to act predominately during early G1 phase. Other RB family members, including p107
  and p130, may influence snRNA gene transcription during the cell cycle whereas MAF1,
  a downstream effector of the mTOR pathway, can also repress snRNA gene transcription
  in response to cell stress and changes in nutrient levels (not shown).
