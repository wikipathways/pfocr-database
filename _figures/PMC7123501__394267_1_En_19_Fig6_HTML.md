caption: 'Simplified scenario model of the ferroptotic pathway. This figure shows
  the homeostatic scenario (left) and the oxidative form of a non-apoptotic cell death,
  that is, ferroptosis (right). Ferroptosis is due to disruption of the intracellular
  thiol antioxidant network, caused by loss/inactivity of intracellular GSH, pharmacological
  inhibition of GPX4, and/or loss of the GPX4 protein. Iron-dependent lipoxygenase-mediated
  peroxidation of lipids (predominantly PUFAs) leads to the production of toxic “lipid
  ROS” which lead to subsequent loss of plasma membrane integrity associated with
  passive release of DAMPs. In addition, production of ROS in excess may lead to lipid
  peroxidation. anti-oxid. response antioxidative stress response, Cys 2 cystine,
