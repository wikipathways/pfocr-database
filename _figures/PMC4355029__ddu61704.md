caption: RNA toxicity leads to activation of NF-κB pathway. Schema represents the
  pathway for TWEAK/Fn14 signaling through NF-κB. (A and B) Western blots of mouse
  skeletal muscle protein extracts show increased Fn14 (A), and decreased cIAP1 (BIRC2)
  in DM5-(D+) (induced) mice (B). (C) Immunofluorescence of serial sections shows
  increased Fn14, NIK and NF-κB2 in skeletal muscle from DM5-(D+) mice and absence
  of increased NIK or NF-κB2 in DM5Fn14−/−-(D+) mice. (D and E) Western blots show
  DM5-(D+) mice have increased NF-κB2 p100 processing to p52 (D), and elevated p-p65
  (E). (F–J) In individuals with DM1, western blotting of skeletal muscle protein
  extracts show increased Fn14 (F), decreased cIAP1 (BIRC2) (G), increased processing
  of NF-κB2 p100 to p52 (H), which is quantified in (I); (n = 4 per group); error
  bars are mean ± SEM; *P = 0.037 (Student's t test); and increased p-p65 in DM1 (J).
