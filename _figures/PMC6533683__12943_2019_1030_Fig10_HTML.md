caption: Regulating EMT by targeting autophagy. The autophagy attenuates EMT by inhibiting
  the overexpression of SNAIL and SLUG and activation of ROS-NF-κB-HIF-1α pathway.
  Moreover, ROS-induced NF-κB activation up-regulates SNAIL and MMPs expression to
  promote EMT. Additionally, autophagy accelerates lysosomal- mediated degradation
  of SNAIL and TWIST, resulting in EMT inhibition. On the other side, autophagy activation
  enhances EMT by increasing the expression of HMGB1, metastasis-associated protein
  oncostatin M and MMP-9, facilitating EMT markers expression in both RNA and protein
  levels accompany with promotion of TGF-β2/Smad signaling pathway activity, and up-regulating
  ILK by linking β-catenin and Smad signaling to induce EMT
