caption: Essential metabolic pathways of S. mutans in rich and defined media. Metabolic
  pathways essential in both rich and defined media (blue lines), essential only in
  rich medium (green lines), and essential only in defined medium (red lines) are
  shown. Shaded areas represent major metabolic processes (e.g., carbohydrate metabolism).
  We have also highlighted metabolic pathways that become essential in these environments
  (e.g., acetate metabolism). BCAAs, branched-chain amino acids; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; CoA, coenzyme A; P, phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
