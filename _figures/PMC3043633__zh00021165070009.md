caption: Schematic diagram outlines a signaling pathway that may mediate strain-induced
  migration in intestinal epithelial cells consistent with our present and previous
  observations. Cyclic mechanical strain activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
  and Src, which leads to the activation of ILK. ILK is then required for the activation
  of Akt, FAK, and MLC, which results in increased proliferation of intestinal epithelial
  cells.
