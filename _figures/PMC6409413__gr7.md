caption: Clinical Relevance of miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p with SMAD2, SMAD4, TGFBRI,
  and TGFBRII in Human PCa Tissues(A) Analysis of miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p expression
  with SMAD2, SMAD4, TGFBRI, and TGFBRII in four bone metastatic PCa tissues (T1–4)
  and four non-bone metastatic PCa tissues (T5–8). U6 was used as the control for
  miRNA loading. miR-582-3p or miR-582-5p expression levels were normalized to that
  of miR-582-3p or miR-582-5p expression of T1. Each bar represents the mean ± SD
  of three independent experiments. Loading controls were α-tubulin and p84 for the
  cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. ***p < 0.001. (B) Hypothetical model illustrating
  that miR-582-3p and miR-582-5p repress bone metastasis of PCa via inhibiting the
  TGF-β signaling pathway by directly targeting SMAD2, SMAD4, TGFBRI, and TGFBRII.
