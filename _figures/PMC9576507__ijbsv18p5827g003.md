caption: Regulatory mechanisms of pyroptotic cell death during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  Pyroptosis has been closely linked with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 infection
  coordinates the activation of the pyroptosis pathways through various mechanisms.
  Once SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell, the viral genome is released and starts to
  replicate and manufacture a series of proteins to assemble new virions. Viral NSP6
  and ORF3a trigger NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis by impeding the autophagic
  flux. NSP6 promotes the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome by inducing K+ efflux. SARS-CoV-2
  infection may stimulate the NF-κB signaling pathway, hence driving NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated
  pyroptosis. Moreover, viral attachment protein S and its S1 subunit facilitate the
  activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and induce GSDMD-executed pyroptosis in infected
  cells. These events cause the extravasation of proinflammatory mediators (e.g.,
  IL-1β and IL-18), LDH release and eventually prompt robust immune reactions. S protein
  also has the ability to motivate NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes, suggesting that it
  may affect diverse pyroptosis-related signaling cascades. Viral NSP1 and NSP13 inhibit
  caspase-1 activation, while ORF3a and S1-RBD exert opposite effects. N protein supports
  the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome, while it antagonizes pyroptotic cell death
  in host cell by inactivating the pyroptosis executioner GSDMD. Likewise, NSP5 can
  prevent GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. Instead, NSP5 actuates the NLRP1/caspase-3/GSDME
  pathway. It is followed by the formation of GSDME-N pores on the cellular membrane,
  contributing to lytic cell death and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines,
  DAMPs and alarmins. SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2;
