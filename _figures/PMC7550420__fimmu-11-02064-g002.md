caption: 'The process and regulation of STING trafficking. After stimulated by cytosolic
  dsDNA, STING dimer exist from the ER to ERGIC, Golgi, and endosomes. The process
  of trafficking is mediated by diverse proteins. The thick black arrows indicate
  the pathway that lead to activation and trafficking of STING. The thin black arrows
  indicate the regulators which positively regulates the trafficking of STING. The
  white arrows indicate the regulators which negatively regulates the trafficking
  of STING. Full name of the abbreviations: VPS34 (Vacuolar protein sorting-associated
