caption: Construction of the biosynthetic pathway of 3β,12β-Di-O-Glc-PPT in the engineered
  yeast. The intrinsic Saccharomyces cerevisiae pathway is indicated by black and
  grey arrows. The double arrows show the multiple-step reactions. The Panax ginseng
  pathway is shown by blue arrows; the glycosylation reactions are shown by red arrows.
  The genes in black are up-regulated; the gene in grey is down-regulated; the genes
  in green are from P. ginseng; the gene in magenta is from Arabidopsis thaliana;
  and the gene in red is from Bacillus subtilis. The compounds in blue background
  are aglycones; the compounds in purple background are by-products; and the compound
  in orange background is target product.
