caption: 'Proposed model for the suppression of inflammatory cytokine production by
  globular adiponectin in LPS-stimulated macrophages. LPS stimulates the production
  of various inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-1β through activation of
  TRAF6/p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathway in macrophages. Stimulation of macrophages with globular
  adiponectin results in the inhibition of LPS-stimulated inflammatory cytokines production
  via modulation of TRAF6 expression and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. The modulatory
  effects of globular adiponectin on inflammatory signaling cascade are mediated by
  autophagy induction. Increased p62 cellular level plays a vital role in globular
  adiponectin- mediated autophagy induction in macrophages, while the detailed mechanisms
  underlying autophagy activation by p62 remain to be investigated. Nrf2 plays a crucial
  role in transcriptional activation of p62 and p21 induction enhanced cellular Nrf2
  level by preventing Nrf2 ubiquitination leading to its stabilization, collectively
  indicating that the p21/Nrf2 axis critically contributes to the up-regulation of
  p62 by globular adiponectin. Finally, it appears that anti-inflammation and autophagy
  inducing effects of globular adiponectin in macrophages are mainly generated through
  adipoR2-mediated signaling, rather than adipoR1. AdipoR1: adiponectin receptor type
