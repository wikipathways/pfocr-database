caption: Pathogenic Lipogenesis in RA T cells. Metabolic rewiring in RA T cells, including
  the shunting of glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway, the export of mitochondrial
  citrate and the suppression of mitochondrial lipid oxidation, all favor lipogenesis
  over lipolysis. As a result, RA T cells deposit lipid droplets in the cytoplasm
  and are rich in biosynthetic precursors for membrane lipids. Lowered glycolytic
  activity upregulates a module of motility genes, including the scaffolding protein
  TKS5. As part of their pro-inflammatory phenotype, lipogenesis-biased TKS5hi RA
  T cells spontaneously form actin- and cortactin-rich membrane ruffles, equipping
  them tissue invasion and mobility in extracellular matrix. AcCoA, acetyl-CoA.
