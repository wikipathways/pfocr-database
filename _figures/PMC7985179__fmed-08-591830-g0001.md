caption: This figure shows a genome-wide overview of the results of coronavirus disease-related
  pulmonary fibrosis (COVID-PF) (A) and PF (B). Reactome pathways are arranged in
  a hierarchy. The center of each of the circular “bursts” is the root of one top-level
  pathway. Each step away from the center represents the next level lower in the pathway
  hierarchy. The color code denotes the overrepresentation of that pathway in your
  input dataset. Light gray signifies pathways that are not significantly overrepresented.
