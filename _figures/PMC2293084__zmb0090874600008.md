caption: Schematic illustration of PARP-1 in NFAT signaling pathway. At resting state,
  basal phosphorylation is required to maintain cytosolic localization of NFAT. Upon
  an increase in intracellular calcium, activated calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT
  to promote nuclear translocation. Once in the nucleus, NFAT interacts with NFAT
  partners to mediate gene transcription. Here, we demonstrate that PARP-1 acts as
  coregulator of NFAT. Interaction with PARP-1 promotes ADP-ribosylation of NFAT,
  which increases avidity of NFAT DNA binding, to regulate gene transcription. Transcription
  termination requires rephosphorylation of NFAT, which is mediated by multiple protein
  kinases. Similar to phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation is reversible, and hydrolysis
  of ADP-ribose is mediated by PARG. Given that cytoplasmic PARG accounts for most
  of the cellular PARG activity, it is tempting to speculate that compartmentalization
  of the molecules involved in NFAT phosphorylation (protein kinases and calcineurin
  phosphatase) and ADP-ribosylation (PARP-1 and PARG) provides fine-tuning of NFAT-mediated
  gene transcription. SRR, Ser-rich region; boxes A, B, and C, Ser-Pro motifs; 14-3-3,
  phospho-Ser binding protein; PxIxIT, calcineurin docking site.
