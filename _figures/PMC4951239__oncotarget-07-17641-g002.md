caption: A. Autophagy, regulated by AMPK-mTOR signal pathway, benefits the detached
  cancer cells to overcome anoikis. mTOR negatively regulates autophagy by inhibiting
  Atgs such as Atg13 and Atg1 (ULK1/2). B. Upstream factors, such as SIRT1 or HULC,
  trigger autophagic activation by inducing Atg8 and PE conjugation (LC3-II formation),
  which subsequently promotes EMT and tumor invasion. C. Autophagy, regulated by Atg6
  (Beclin 1) and class III PI3K, enhances tumor angiogenesis. D. Tumor microenvironment,
  such as hypoxia, starvation, and inflammation, may influence autophagic process,
  which in turn shapes tumor microenvironment. The autophagy related proteins were
  highlighted in red. Arrow indicates a stimulatory effect and × indicates an inhibitive
  effect. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition;
  HULC, highly upregulated in liver cancer; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1
  light chain 3; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine;
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SIRT1, silent mating type information regulation
