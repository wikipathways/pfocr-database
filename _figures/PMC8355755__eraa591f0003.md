caption: Alternative oxidase (AOX) modulates nitrogen metabolism and the phytoglobin
  cycle in mitochondria during hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation. Under low-oxygen
  conditions (left side), AOX and complex IV of mitochondria use nitrite (NO2–) as
  acceptor of the electron transport chain, thus enhancing NO production. In parallel,
  electrons from ubiquinone (Q), besides being delivered to AOX, are also delivered
  to complex III, allowing the production of superoxide anion (O2–). NO and O2– react
  to form the nitrating agent peroxynitrite (ONO2–). Both NO and ONO2– trigger post-translational
  modifications (PTMs) such as cysteine S-nitrosylation and tyrosine nitration. During
  the reoxygenation after hypoxia (right side), both AOX and complex IV use O2 as
  electron acceptor and Q delivers electrons mainly to AOX and marginally to complex
  III, thus attenuating O2– production. In addition, the residual AOX-catalyzed conversion
  of nitrite to NO is attenuated by coupling to the phytoglobin (PGB) cycle with NO-dioxygenase
  activity that converts NO back to nitrate (NO3–), which is incorporated into the
  nitrate assimilation pathway.
