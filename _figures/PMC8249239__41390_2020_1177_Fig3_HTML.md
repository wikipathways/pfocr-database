caption: The schematic shows the interaction between the signaling pathways regulated
  by αβ integrins and the VEGF receptor. VEGF-A promotes angiogenesis through VEGF
  receptor-2 (VEGFR2), a tyrosine kinase receptor expressed by endothelial cells.
  When VEGF-A binds to VEGFR2, numerous intracellular signaling pathways are activated,
  such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (Erk), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), c-Src family, and paxillin, a signal transduction
  adaptor protein associated with focal adhesion., Specifically, FAK phosphorylates
  its substrate, paxillin, which activates ERK signaling. When integrins activate
  the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, it binds to signaling structural proteins,
  PI3K, and paxillin. Src family kinases (SFKs) play a critical role in cell adhesion,
  survival, and angiogenesis, interact with VEGF receptor, regulate gene expression
  of angiogenic growth factors, modulate cell proliferation via the mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPK)-ERK pathway, and interact with integrins to regulate cell
  adhesion and migration. ECM extracellular matrix, VEGF vascular endothelial growth
  factor.
