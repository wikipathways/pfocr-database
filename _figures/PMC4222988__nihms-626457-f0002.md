caption: A) Compensatory over-activation of signal transduction pathways induced by
  rapamycin-mediated suppression of negative feedback loops. Rapamycin triggers PI3K
  activation and Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 via suppression of mTORC1/S6K-mediated
  phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Sin1 (loop 1). mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt
  at Ser473 in response to rapamycin can be further enhanced by eliminating negative
  crosstalk from S6K (loop 2). Furthermore, mTORC2 negatively feeds back to IRS-1
  via control of its stability (loop 3). In some cancer cells, rapalogs also induce
  MEK/ERK via PI3K- dependent pathway that could involve Rac/PAK1 and/or PDGFR. B)
  Compensatory over-activation of signal transduction pathways induced by active-site
  mTOR inhibitors. Active-site mTOR inhibitors which block both mTORC1 and mTORC2,
  also eliminate feedback loops that restrain PI3K/PDK1 activation. Specifically,
  these agents disable feedback loops 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10. Active-site mTOR inhibitors
  enhance Akt phosphorylation at the activation loop (Thr308) and consequently these
  agents do not completely block Akt activity. Acute exposure of a variety of cell
  types to active-site mTOR inhibitors induced a striking over-activation of MEK/ERK
  pathway via a PI3K-independent pathway. Chronic exposure to these agents also disables
  the negative influence of Akt on FOXO thereby promoting expression of tyrosine kinase
  receptors and adaptors. For additional details see text. Inhibitory connections
  are in red. Stimulatory connections are in green. Pathways activated by suppression
  of negative feedback loops are highlighted in yellow.
