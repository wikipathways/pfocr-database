caption: 'Canonical transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and noncanonical pathways in
  endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT). The canonical TGF-β pathway is triggered
  upon binding of TGF-β homodimers to a transmembrane heterodimeric TGF-β I/II receptor
  complex in the cell surface. The binding of TGF-β to the heterodimeric receptor
  complex leads to the phosphorylation-mediated activation of the TGF-β receptor I/II
  complex. The active TGF-β receptor I/II complex phosphorylates cytoplasmic Smad2
  and Smad3 proteins resulting in their activation. Activated Smad2 and Smad3 form
  a complex with Smad4 that translocates to the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, the Smad2/Smad3/Smad4
  complex interacts with Smad binding elements (SBE) of TGF-β-responsive genes including
  those encoding profibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules and transcription
  factors such as Snail1 and 2 and Twist and stimulates their transcription. Another
  intracellular Smad protein, the inhibitory Smad7, abrogates TGF-β-induced signaling
  cascades by inhibitory effects on the activated TGF-β receptors and is a potent
  negative regulator of TGF-β-induced gene expression responses. Noncanonical TGF-β
  pathways include the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of serine/threonine-specific
  protein kinases and numerous other kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K), RhoA, Rac, c-Abl, and protein kinase C (PKC)-δ. TGF-β can activate all three
  known MAPK pathways: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK, and
  c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK). Signaling through these pathways mediates Smad2/3-independent
  TGF-β responses. These pathways result in either reduced transcription of endothelial-specific
  genes or increased the transcription of mesenchymal-specific genes effects mediated
  by EndMT-related transcription factors such as Snail1 and 2 and TWIST1.'
