caption: Schematic representation of the carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways in
  mature nodules. Sucrose is first oxidized through glycolysis and oxidative pentose
  phosphate pathway to generate reducing power (NADH, NADPH) and phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP). PEP, on the one hand, supplies pyruvate to the mitochondria to fuel energy
  metabolism and, on the other hand, supplies the carbon skeletons to produce organic
  acids (malate, succinate). Part of the organic acids are supplied to the bacteroids
  and contribute to generating the reducing power and the energy necessary for the
  reduction of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH4+) by nitrogenase. Another
  part is used to produce the α-keto acids involved in the assimilation of NH4+ from
  bacteroids, via the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway. Assimilated
  N is exported, as either amino acids (indetermined nodules) or ureides (determinate
  nodules), to the whole plant. Ala, alanine; Dct, dicarboxylate transporter; e-,
