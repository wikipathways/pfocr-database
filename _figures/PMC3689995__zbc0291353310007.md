caption: Schematic model of the dual functions of Smad2 in the maintenance of hESC
  and mEpiSC pluripotency. Autocrine BMP activity and differentiation upon activation
  of the BMP pathway (green area) need to be suppressed by Smad2. BMP signaling induces
  the expression of master regulators of differentiation, including Cdx2, and drives
  differentiation toward mesoderm, PGC, and trophectoderm. Smad2 directly induces
  Nanog expression and maintains expression of other pluripotency regulators such
  as Oct4 through enhanced Nanog expression (pink area). Suppression of Cdx2 expression
  by antagonizing BMP signaling is essential to maintain Oct4 expression.
