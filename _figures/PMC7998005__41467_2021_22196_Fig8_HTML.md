caption: In normal conditions (left), miR-135a-5p was transcriptionally regulated
  by Foxd3 and suppressed the Rock2 expression, which was essential for normal synaptic
  plasticity. In AD (right), loss of Foxd3 results in the downregulation of miR-135a-5p
  and the overexpression of Rock2, which in turn caused the hyperphosphorylation of
  Add1 in the Ser726 site and the aberrant dendritic morphology, as well as the synaptic/memory
  impairments. Blocking the hyperphosphorylation of Add1 by siP-Add1 partially rescued
  those abnormalities.
