caption: Cytosolic HAV RNA is sensed by RNA helicases (most likely MDA-5) which interact
  through shared caspase-recruitment domains (CARDS) with the adaptor protein, MAVS,
  localized on the mitochondrial outer membrane. This induces formation of a macromolecular
  signaling complex that leads to activation of non-canonical (IKKε and TBK-1) and
  canonical (IKKα/β) kinases of the IκB complex, and subsequent activation of latent
  cytoplasmic transcription factors, IRF-3 and NF-κB. These activated transcription
  factors translocate to the nucleus where they induce the transcription of IFN-β
  mRNA, thereby initiating the production of IFNs and ISGs. TLR3 activates these same
  transcription factors via a parallel signaling pathway that is initiated upon the
  sensing of viral dsRNA (or poly-I:C) by TLR3 within an endosomal compartment. Binding
  of its dsRNA ligand induces the dimerization of TLR3 and subsequent recruitment
  of the adaptor protein, TRIF, to its cytoplasmic domain through shared Toll/Interleukin-1
  receptor (TIR) domains. Additional details of these pathways are available elsewhere
  . Precursors of the HAV 3Cpro cysteine protease block both signaling pathways by
  directing cleavage of the critical adaptor proteins, MAVS  and, as shown in this
  communication, TRIF. These processing intermediates, 3ABC and 3CD, represent products
  of alternative processing pathways by which 3Cpro is derived from the P2P3 polyprotein
  fragment (2B to 3Dpol shown at the top), a product of the primary HAV polyprotein
  cleavage between 2A/2B . MAVS cleavage by 3ABC is dependent upon 3ABC localization
  to the mitochondria, while 3CD cleavage of TRIF, as shown here, is dependent upon
  altered substrate specificity of 3Cpro induced by its fusion to 3Dpol.
