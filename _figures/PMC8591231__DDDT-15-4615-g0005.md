caption: The mechanism of action in the regulation of apoptosis during myocardial
  injuries. In the extrinsic pathway, the interaction between Fas ligand and its receptor
  causes the recruitment of FADD and procaspase-8 to form DISC. In the intrinsic pathway,
  the increases in pro-apoptotic genes and the decrease in anti-apoptotic genes resulted
  from oxidative stress and cellular damage lead to the release of cytochrome c from
  mitochondria. Apoptosome formation ensues, consisting of cytochrome c, deoxyadenosine
  triphosphate (dATP), apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), and procaspase-9.
  The activated initiator caspases (caspase-8 and caspase-9) further activates executioner
  caspases (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7), promoting the cleavage of cellular
  substrate. A. paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees and andrographolide prevent apoptosis by
  suppressing the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. The upstream signalling
  events involved are the activation of IGF-1R and inhibition of PPAR-α. The anti-apoptotic
  effects of A. paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees and andrographolide are indicated (green
  arrows). The arrow pointing upward indicates an increase or activation while the
  arrow pointing downward indicates a decrease or inhibition.
