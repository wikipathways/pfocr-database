caption: Sphingolipid metabolic interconversions in the brain. The de novo pathway
  of ceramide formation consists of consequential generation of 3-keto-DHSph, DHSph,
  DHCer, and Cer. Cer are also produced via catabolic degradation of SM and glycosphingolipids
  by sphingomyelinases and β-galactosidase. Cer is further hydrolyzed by ceramidases
  to Sph, which is consequently converted to S1P by kinases SphK1 and SphK2. S1P can
  be degraded to ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecanal by a S1P lyase or recycled
  (via phosphatases) to Sph and then reacylated to ceramides. Other sources of ceramide
  in brain cells include Cer1P (via a Cer 1P-phosphatase), and C2-ceramide (see the
  Introduction and Ref. ) S1P appears to be protective and Sph and C16/18:0-Cer are
  proapoptotic, as revealed by experimental manipulation of primary cultures on neurons
  and oligodendrocytes and analyses of multiple sclerosis brain tissue.
