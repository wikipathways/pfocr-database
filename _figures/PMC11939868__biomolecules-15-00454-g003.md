caption: LncRNA and Tils in TNBC. TILs serve as markers of an active anti-tumor immune
  response in TNBC. lncRNAs produced by T cells play crucial roles in modulating TIL
  activity. Recent studies have demonstrated that SNHG1, expressed in CD4+ T cells,
  facilitates immune evasion in breast cancer via Treg differentiation through the
  miR-448/IDO axis. The lncRNA NEAT1 influences the proliferation and function of
  Tregs via modulation of the STAT5 signaling pathway. In addition, lncRNA PVT1 has
  been shown to be negatively correlated with Treg-associated cytokine levels, suggesting
  that PVT1 may promote immune escape by inhibiting Treg function. The lncRNA NKILA
  enhances immune evasion by inhibiting NF-κB signaling, which increases T cell vulnerability
  to AICD. Furthermore, lncRNA HEIH modulates T cell activity by regulating the NOS
  pathway, thereby altering the IME of TNBC. LncRNA UCA1 inhibits the cytotoxicity
  of CD8+ T cells by upregulating PD-L1 expression, facilitating immune evasion by
  tumor cells. Conversely, lncRNA GAS5 enhances CD8+ T cell anti-tumor efficacy by
  promoting the secretion of IFN-γ. The lncRNA MIAT has been identified as a potential
  biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis, showing significant correlations
  with NK cells and neutrophils. In contrast, MALAT1 reduces the anti-cancer function
  of NK cells by decreasing the expression of activation-associated ligands (e.g.,
  MICA/B) and inducing immune checkpoints (e.g., PD-L1), thereby promoting tumor growth
  and metastasis. Notably, lncRNA GAS5 enhances NK cell cytotoxicity through the regulation
  of miR-544 expression. Additionally, lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 is upregulated in CD56bright
  NK cells and inhibits glycolysis, leading to impaired NK cell function
