caption: 'Energetic state under normal physiological conditions in human astrocyte.
  Orange arrows show the active metabolic pathways in the normal physiological astrocyte.
  The fluxes were calculated for maximizing the glutamate uptake /glutamine release/
  ATP synthesis, using the uptake rates given in Table  as constraints. Dashed arrows
  indicate the exchange reactions for metabolic transport across the network boundary.
  Only key pathway fluxes are represented here for simplicity. All reactions are listed
  in Additional Files. The abbreviations used for metabolic pathways are: PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway and Tyr, tyrosine; AKG, α-ketoglutarate; GLT, glutamate.'
