caption: 'Examples of two pathways of histone modification by polycomb complexes leading
  to suppression of selected TSG. Two potentially reinforcing pathways (one pathway
  leading from experimentally up-regulated BMI1 expression, in red connecting arrows,
  and the other pathway leading from experimental down-regulation of p16 the gene,
  in orange connecting arrows, respectively.) that could lead to stable TSG repression
  are mapped. Vertical (up or down) arrows beside pathway components indicate experimental
  manipulations that resulted in TSG suppression (p16 down-regulation, in orange,
  BMI1 up-regulation, in red, at the origin of the two large arrows indicating the
  pathways of subsequent effects) (note increased H3K27me3 levels at the p16/INK4A
  gene promoter following from its engineered down-regulation were not confirmed,
  although other gene promoters were affected. In other cell lines, over-expression
  of PRC2 components resulted in p16/INK4A repression). Several points at which chemical
  perturbations affect the pathway and mentioned in the text of the review are also
  indicated (blue arrows). The two reinforcing epigenetic pathways were constructed
  from information in: [,] (small connecting arrows and large Xs indicate the normal
