caption: TIGAR inhibits glycolysis, directing glucose metabolism to PPP. TIGAR thus
  significantly reduces intracellular ROS, and promotes nucleotide synthesis and DNA
  damage repair. In addition to its enzymatic functions, TIGAR also has nonenzymatic
  functions, which affect the cell cycle, cell survival, inflammation, and mitochondrial
  function. TIGAR can also inhibit autophagy. These effects help maintain the energy
  metabolism and the stability of the internal environment. AKT protein kinase B,
  DDR DNA damage repair, glucose-6-P glucose-6-phosphate, G6PD glucose-6-phosphate
