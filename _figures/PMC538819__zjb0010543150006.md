caption: Aerobic glycerol and G3P metabolism in E. coli. Glycerol enters the cytoplasm
  through the glycerol facilitator (GlpF) and can be phosphorylated to G3P by the
  glycerol kinase (GlpK). In the presence of oxygen, G3P is oxidized by the G3P dehydrogenase
  (GlpD) to DHAP, which is further metabolized through the glycolytic pathway. Intracellular
  glycerol can also be oxidized to DHA by GldA. DHA is converted to DHAP by the DHA
  kinase (DhaK), which uses DhaM as a phosphoryl donor protein. G3P is required for
  phospholipid biosynthesis, and in the absence of extracellular glycerol, intracellular
  G3P is formed from DHAP by the G3P synthase (GpsA). In a glpD mutant G3P accumulates
  due to conversion of glycerol to G3P by GlpK. Intracellular G3P accumulation prevents
  cAMP formation by inhibiting the stimulation of adenylate cyclase via phospho-EIIAGlc
  (). As a consequence, cAMP-CAP activation of the lsr operon is inhibited significantly.
  G3P accumulation also inhibits GpsA by a negative feedback mechanism, which leads
  to DHAP accumulation. We hypothesize that DHAP represses the lsr operon by a mechanism
  independent of cAMP-CAP that involves LsrR, the repressor of the lsr operon. The
  solid lines indicate enzymatic reactions, the dashed lines indicate regulatory interactions,
  and the dotted lines indicate the newly proposed regulatory interaction resulting
  from this work. FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; FADH2, reduced flavin adenine
  dinucleotide.
