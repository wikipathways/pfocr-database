caption: MDA-7/IL-24 regulates autophagy mediated through ER stress and ceramide production.
  MDA-7/IL-24 first interacts with its receptors which leads to a downstream signaling
  pathway mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS regulates DICER and through
  this molecule MDA-7/IL-24 downregulates miR-221, which in turn upregulates Beclin-1
  to induce toxic autophagy leading to cell death. The transition of protective to
  toxic autophagy is explained by the cleavage of ATG5 by Calpain, which is also mediated
  by ROS induced from MDA-7/IL-24 treatment.
