caption: The hyperglycemia-induced intracellular AGE precursors, such as MGO, induce
  pathological consequences in four routes, 1) direct intracellular glycation of proteins,
  including proteins involved in the regulation of gene transcription, such as NF-κB,
  2) inhibiting enzymes responsible for protein degradation, such as proteasomal (including
  ubiquitin) and lysosomal systems, 3) the intracellular AGEs precursors can diffusing
  out of the cell and modify nearby cells (even the same cell itself), extracellular
  matrix, such as Bruch’s membrane and choroidal capillary membranes, and 4) the intracellular
  AGEs precursors diffusing out of the cell to modify circulating proteins in the
  blood, which in turn activate RAGE on pro-inflammatory cells or CECs, thereby causing
  the production of inflammatory cytokines and/or growth factors.
