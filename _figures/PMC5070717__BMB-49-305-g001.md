caption: GSK3β in TLR4 responses. GSK3β transcriptionally regulates pro- and anti-inflammatory
  cytokines and IFN-β production in TLR4 signaling pathway. In basal condition, GSK3β
  is constitutively active. GSK3β inhibits the binding of CREB to CBP, whereas it
  promotes the binding of NF-κB to CBP, leading to reduced anti-inflammatory cytokine
  production and enhanced pro-inflammatory production, respectively. GSK3β also inhibits
  AP1, such as c-Jun and ATF2, leading to reduced IFN-β production. Upon increased
  PI3K activation, GSK3β is phosphorylated and inactivated, leading to enhanced anti-inflammatory
  cytokine and IFN-β production and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
