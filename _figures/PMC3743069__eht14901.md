caption: Mechanisms of hyperglycemia-induced vascular damage. High intracellular glucose
  concentrations lead to PKC activation and subsequent ROS production by NADPH oxidase
  and p66Shc adaptor protein. Increased oxidative stress rapidly inactivates NO leading
  to formation of the pro-oxidant ONOO− responsible for protein nitrosylation. Reduced
  NO availability is also due to PKC-dependent eNOS deregulation. Indeed, PKC triggers
  enzyme up-regulation thus enhancing eNOS uncoupling and leading to a further accumulation
  of free radicals. On the other hand, hyperglycemia reduces eNOS activity blunting
  activatory phosphorylation at Ser1177. Together with the lack of NO, glucose-induced
  PKC activation causes increased synthesis of ET-1 favouring vasoconstriction and
  platelet aggregation. Accumulation of superoxide anion also triggers up-regulation
  of pro-inflammatory genes MCP-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 via activation of NF-kB signalling.
  These events lead to monocyte adhesion, rolling, and diapedesis with formation of
  foam cells in the sub-endothelial layer. Foam cell-derived inflammatory cytockines
  maintain vascular inflammation as well as proliferation of smooth muscle cells,
  accelerating the atherosclerotic process. Endothelial dysfunction in diabetes also
  derives from increased synthesis of TXA2 via up-regulation of COX-2 and inactivation
  of PGIS by increased nitrosylation. Furthermore, ROS increase the synthesis of glucose
  metabolite methylglyoxal leading to activation of AGE/RAGE signalling and the pro-oxidant
  hexosamine and polyol pathway flux. PKC, protein kinase C; eNOS, endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase; ET1, endothelin 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NO, nitric oxide;
  MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1;
  ICAM-1, intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1; AGE, advanced glycation end product.
