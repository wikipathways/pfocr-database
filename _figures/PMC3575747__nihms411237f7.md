caption: 'Photic input from the RHT drives the release of the excitatory amino acid
  glutamate and the neuropeptide PACAP. Postsynaptic receptors trigger actuation of
  the MAPK signaling cassette, ultimately leading to the phospho-activation of the
  effector kinase ERK. Three principal ERK-mediated signaling events are depicted:
  activation of MSK1, RSK and mTORC1 signaling. MSK1 stimulates activation of the
  transcription factor CREB, which in turn promotes CRE-dependent transcription of
  rapid response genes, including c-Fos, and the clock gene Period1. MSK1 may also
  facilitate clock gene transcription via epigenetic mechanisms such as histone H3
  phosphorylation. These mechanisms work together to mediate photic entrainment of
  the SCN clock.'
