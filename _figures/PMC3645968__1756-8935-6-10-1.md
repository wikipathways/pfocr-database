caption: Chemical structures of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its oxidation products
  5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC).
  The potential involvement of these modified cytosine bases in several pathways of
  passive (replication-dependent) and active (replication-independent) DNA demethylation
  is indicated. One active demethylation pathway is proposed to include consecutive
  oxidation steps followed by removal of 5caC by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) in
  a base excision repair (BER) scheme or by decarboxylation arriving back at cytosine
  (C). DNMT, DNA methyltransferase.
