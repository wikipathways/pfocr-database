caption: Mitochondrial function in healthy kidneys. Mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation
  (FAO) is the preferred pathway to generate ATP in kidney tubules. Fatty acids are
  converted in acyl-CoA in cytosol; they are conjugated with carnitine in the outer
  mitochondrial membrane (OMM) by carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1A (CPT1A) to cross
  the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). In the mitochondrial matrix, acyl-carnitine
  is reconverted to acyl-CoA, and it enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Reduced
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH2) and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide
  (FADH2) generated by FAO and by the TCA cycle deposit their electrons into the electron
  transport chain (ETC). Electrons released by the ETC react with oxygen to form superoxide
  anion (O2−), which is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by superoxidase dismutase
  2 (SOD2). H2O2 can be reduced to water by antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and
  glutathione peroxidases (GPXs).
