caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of action of Piezo1 in myocardial fibrosis.
  Piezo1 helps cardiomyocytes transduce mechanical stretch into intracellular Ca2+signaling
  and ROS signaling, and mechanical overload leads to increased Piezo1 expression
  in cardiomyocytes, ultimately leading to cardiomyopathy. In vitro, mechanical stretch-induced
  fibroblast Piezo1 opening and promoted IL-6 mRNA expression through the MAPKP38
  signaling pathway. Mechanical stretch induces fibroblasts to increase ECM secretion,
  and increased matrix stiffness may further upregulate Piezo1 expression and promote
  fibrosis progression.
