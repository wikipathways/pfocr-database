caption: Metabolic engineering modification strategy for ectoine and PHB co-production
  by H. bluephagenesis. a The reconstructed ectoine and PHB co-biosynthetic pathway
  in H. bluephagenesis. Modified metabolic fluxes of high efficiency involved in ectoine
  synthesis are shown in black bold lines. Genes doeA and ectD encoding ectoine hydrolase
  and ectoine hydroxylase, respectively, are deleted. b Application of two orthogonal
  inducible systems in ectoine synthesizes related genes. Two orthogonal inducible
  systems and fine-tuning of asd, lysC and ectABC genes
