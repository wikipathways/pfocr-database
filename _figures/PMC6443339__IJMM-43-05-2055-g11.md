caption: Schematic diagram of the regulatory effects of H2S on PCSK9 expression and
  lipid metabolism. Solid lines show the pathway of H2S regulating the LDLR, which
  is concluded by the research results of this study. The dotted line is speculative
  as to why H2S increases LDLR, but does not increase the intracellular lipid content
  of HepG2 cells. H2S, hydrogen sulfide; PCSK9, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin
  type 9; LDLR, low-density lipoprotein receptor.

  signaling pathway to influence lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells.
