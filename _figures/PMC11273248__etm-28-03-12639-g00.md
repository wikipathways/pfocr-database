caption: Mechanisms of flavonoid compounds exerting protective effects against brain
  injury after ICH. (A) Puerarin activates the PI3K/Akt pathway and reduces NF-κB
  activation, increases the expression level of Bcl-2 and inhibits the expression
  of Bax and Caspase-3, thereby inhibiting ICH-induced apoptosis. (B) Calycosin, luteolin
  and isoliquiritigenin protects ICH by modulating Nrf2. They both activate Nrf2 and
  promote its nuclear translocation, thereby inhibiting OS. In addition, calycosin
  and isoliquiritigenin further inhibit NF-κB and/or NLRP3-mediated inflammation through
  promoting Nrf2. (C) Luteolin inhibits the activation of the TLR4/TRAF6/NF-κB signaling
  pathway by binding to TRAF6, thus reducing inflammation. (D) Quercetin, baicalein
  and procyanidins increase the activities of SOD and GSH-Px, while decreasing the
  MDA level, and thus improves oxidative damage after ICH. (E) Baicalein and isoliquiritigenin
  inhibit NLRP3-mediated inflammation by inhibiting ROS production. (F) Didymin upregulates
  the expression of RKIP; RKIP combines with Asc, thus inhibiting the assembly of
  NLRP3 inflammasomes, to inhibit NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response. (G) Quercetin
  inhibits apoptosis mediated by cleaved Caspase-3. (H) Baicalin downregulates the
  expression of PAR-1 to inhibit cellular apoptosis. (I) Baicalin inhibits the expression
  of MMPs to ameliorate the disruption of BBB. (J) Breviscapine attenuates the inflammatory
  response by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB. (K) Eupatilin and pinocembrin lower
  the expression of TLR4 and downregulate NF-κB signaling to inhibit the inflammatory
  response. (L) Hesperidin promotes the expression of TGF-β1 to inhibit expression
  of MMPs, thus protecting the BBB from disruption. ICH, intracerebral hemorrhage;
  OS, oxidative stress; SOD, superoxide dismutase; GSH-Px, glutathione peroxidase;
  MDA, malondialdehyde; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RKIP, RAF kinase inhibitor protein;
  PAR-1, protease-activating receptor-1; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; BBB, blood-brain
  barrier
