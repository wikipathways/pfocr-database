caption: Schematic model of cuproptosis. Cu ionophores such as elesclomol bind extracellular
  Cu and transport it to intracellular compartments. Cu then binds to lipoylated mitochondrial
  enzymes in the TCA cycle such as DLAT, inducing the aggregation of these proteins.
  FDX1/LIAS is an upstream regulator of protein lipoylation, facilitating the aggregation
  of mitochondrial proteins and loss of Fe–S clusters. Together, these aberrant processes
  lead to proteotoxic stress and ultimately cell death. Cu chelators such as TTM inhibit
  cuproptosis, while inhibitors of ferroptosis (Fer-1), necroptosis (Nec-1), and oxidative
  stress (NAC) have no effect on cuproptosis. The solid orange circles in the TCA
  cycle indicate metabolites that are relevant to the lipoic acid pathway. Created
  with BioRender. α-KG α-ketoglutarate, DLAT dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase,
  FDX1 ferredoxin-1, Fe–S iron–sulfur, Fer-1 ferrostatin-1, LIAS lipoic acid synthetase,
