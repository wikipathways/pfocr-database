caption: Breast cancer-bone interactions in skeletal metastasis using the receptor
  activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)/RANK pathway. Expression of RANK enables breast
  cancer cells to migrate to bone where the cognate ligand RANKL is abundantly expressed
  by osteoblasts. Some tumour cells express RANKL, whereas others further enhance
  RANKL expression by cell-to-cell contact of tumour cells with osteoblastic lineage
  cells. This enables breast cancer cells to enter a vicious circle where they stimulate
  bone-destroying osteoclasts that express RANK (first loop). Bone degradation by
  osteoclasts creates further space for expansive tumour growth within the bone microenvironment
  and releases a variety of growth factors and cytokines that have been deposited
  by osteoblasts, including parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), IL-6, and
  transforming-growth factor (TGF)-β, and that serve as tumour survival factors (second
  loop). OAF, osteoclast activating factor.
