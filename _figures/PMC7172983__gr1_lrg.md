caption: The cGAS-STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing. Cytosolic DNA binds to and
  activates cGAS, which catalyzes the synthesis of 2′3ʹ-cGAMP from ATP and GTP. 2′3ʹ-cGAMP
  binds to the ER adaptor STING, which traffics to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment
  (ERGIC) and the Golgi apparatus. After the tansmembrane domain of STING is palmitoylated,
  then palmitoylated STING is clustered to produce oligmerization to recruit TBK1.
  TBK1 phosphorylates STING, which in turn recruits IRF3 for phosphorylation by TBK1.
  Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes and then enters the nucleus, where it functions with
  NF-kB to turn on the expression of type I interferons and other immunomodulatory
  molecules. Furthermore, the ERGIC, which contains cGAMP-bound STING, serves as a
  membrane source for LC3 recruitment and lipidation through a WIPI2-dependent mechanism.
  LC3-positive membranes target DNA and pathogens to autophagosomes, which are subsequently
  fused with lysosomes in a process that requires RAB7 GTPase.
