caption: The methylotrophic pathway of methanogenesis for M. barkeri. In this pathway,
  methyl compounds undergo disproportionation, wherein the oxidation of one methyl
  group to CO2 provides the reducing equivalents for the reduction of three additional
  methyl groups to CH4. In the oxidation portion of the pathway, methyl groups are
  first transferred to coenzyme M by the sequential action of methyltransferases MT1
  and MT2, and then transferred to tetrahydrosarcinapterin by the methyl-H4SPT:CoM
  methyltransferase. The methyl group is oxidized in two successive steps, first to
  methylene-H4SPT and then to methenyl-H4SPT, which produces two reducing equivalents
  in the form of reduced coenzyme F420. The third reducing equivalent comes from the
  oxidation of formyl-methanofuran, which produces CO2 and reduced ferredoxin. In
  the reduction portion of the pathway, methyl-CoM is reduced by coenzyme B, which
  forms CH4 and a disulfide of CoM and CoB. Regeneration of CoM and CoB requires reduction
  of the disulfide by the heterodisulfide reductase enzyme with electrons from reduced
  methanophenazine. The transfer of electrons from the oxidative to reductive portions
  of the pathway occurs via a hydrogen cycling mechanism in M. barkeri. In this mechanism,
  F420red and Fdred are oxidized by Frh and Ech, respectively, which forms H2 on the
  inside of the cell. The H2 then diffuses across the membrane to the Vht active site
  on the outside of the cell, where it is oxidized and electrons are passed to MP,
  thereby completing the cycle. The methyl compound R groups include –OH (methanol),
  –NH2 (methylamine), and –SH (methanethiol). Other examples of methyl compounds include
  dimethylamine, trimethylamine, and dimethyl sulfide.
