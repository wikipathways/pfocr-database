caption: MAPK/ERK and p16/CyclinD-CDK4/6/RB signaling pathways in health and disease.
  (A) In healthy cells, growth factors bind receptor tyrosine kinases on the surface
  of the cell to stimulate proliferation and survival through the MAPK/ERK signaling
  pathway, which is mediated through a cascade of phosphorylation events (NRAS → BRAF
  → MEK → ERK). MAPK/ERK signaling promotes cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complex formation. Inhibition
  of CDK4/6 by p16 prevents CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of RB, thereby allowing
  RB to carry out its tumor suppressive function. (B) BRAFV600 mutations and loss
  of p16 are often seen in melanoma. BRAFV600 is constitutively active and promotes
  aberrant overactivation of MAPK/ERK signaling. In the absence of p16, CDK4/6 phosphorylates
  and inhibits the tumor suppressor RB. These events lead to uncontrolled cellular
  proliferation and survival. (C) Clinical inhibitors against BRAFV600, MEK and CDK4/6
  block MAPK/ERK signaling and CDK4/6-mediated suppression of RB, thereby attenuating
  cell cycle and survival.
