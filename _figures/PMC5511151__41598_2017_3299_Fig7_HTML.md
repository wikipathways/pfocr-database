caption: Schematic representation of mechanisms underlying crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling and insulin signaling via Irs1 during hepatocarcinogenesis. Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling is activated during hepatocarcinogenesis due to somatic mutations of various
  genes related to Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling upregulates
  Irs1 gene and protein expression. Upregulated Irs1, but not Irs2, enhances insulin
  signaling including Akt pathway and promotes the progression of HCC.
