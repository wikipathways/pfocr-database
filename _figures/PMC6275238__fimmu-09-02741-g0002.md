caption: 'The possible model of Leptin and Immune response in malnutrition coupled
  infectious diseases. In malnutrition, low adipocyte mass causes a reduction of serum
  leptin level resultant impairment of normal macrophages and lymphocytes activities.
  Infected macrophages induce the SOCS1 & 3 proteins expression subsequently upregulates
  ROS scavenging enzyme Thioredoxin which leads to activates SHP1/PTPase molecules.
  SHP1/PTP1 negatively regulates the JAK/STAT, and MAP-Kinase pathways thus inhibiting
  IFN–inducible macrophage functions (increased IL-10 and TGF-β level and decreased
  the IL-12 cytokines in infected macrophage). IL-10 suppresses the NO activity and
  improves the parasite survival. TGF-β activates SHP1/PTPase activity in lymphocytes
  through TGF-β receptor (TBR) which leads to lymphocytes apoptosis. In contrast,
  Leptin treatment inactivated SHP1/PTPase directed pathways and reversed the macrophage
  activities by up-regulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, TNF-α, and IL-12)
  secretion and NO expression. IL-12 cytokine released from activated macrophage upon
  leptin treatment inhibits the SHP1/PTPase dependent T lymphocytes apoptosis by activation
  of JAK/STAT pathway. Moreover, Leptin directly inhibits the FasL-dependent T lymphocytes
  apoptosis by the inhibition of the caspase 8 activity. Caspase-8 then promotes mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) by diminishing the inhibitory effect of various
  antiapoptotic and proapoptotic molecules. MOMP results in cytochrome-c release from
  the mitochondria, enabling activation of a supramolecular complex, the apoptosome
  that activates caspase-3 to undertake apoptotic cell death (Suppressors of cytokine
  signaling: SOCS1 & 3; Protein tyrosine phosphatases: SHP1/PTP1, Mitochondrial membrane
  potential drop: MMP drop, and P: phosphorylation) (–).'
