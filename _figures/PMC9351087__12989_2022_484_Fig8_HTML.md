caption: The toxic pathway of hepatotoxicity induced by oral exposure to TiO2 NPs
  through lipid metabolism disorders in gut-liver axis. Due to limited intestinal
  absorption and strong oxidation induction ability of TiO2 NPs, the gut microbiota
  was presumed to be the original site of oxidative stress and disorders of lipid
  metabolism. In fact, TiO2 NPs changed lipidomic signatures of main organs or systems
  in the gut-liver axis including liver, serum and gut. The cluster profile from the
  above biological samples all pointed to the same key metabolic pathway and metabolites,
  which was glycerophospholipid metabolism and Phosphatidylcholines (PCs), respectively.
  Lipid peroxidation characterized by the increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) may be
  the initial step of lipid metabolism disorders, which resulted in hepatic fatty
  degeneration and liver function changes, leading to hepatotoxicity. Most nanomaterials
  (NMs) have oxidation induction and antibacterial properties, so this toxic pathway
  may be primary and universal
