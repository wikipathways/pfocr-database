caption: The influence of MM-EVs on osteolysis and bone formation. Induction of osteolysis
  appears to be one of the roles of MM-EVs. MM-EVs have been shown to reinforce the
  advantage of OCs in the imbalance of OCs and OBs. When incorporated by BM-MSCs,
  a component of MM-EVs, miR-135b, downregulates SMAD5, a protein which, together
  with BMPs, is responsible for the process of osteogenesis. The downregulation of
  SMAD5 disturbs the process of osteogenesis. DKK-1, an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling
  pathway is another component of MM-EVs. When incorporated by the osteoblast precursors,
  DKK-1 blocks the Wnt pathway and leads to the diminished expression of Runx2, osterix
  and collagen1A1, resulting in the disturbance of osteogenesis. lncRunx2-AS1 integrated
  by BM-MSCs targets the gene Runx2 and downregulates it. This results in the downregulation
  of the osteopontin expression and eventually leads to the inhibition of osteogenesis.
  Another important component of MM-EVs is AREG, a ligand of EGFR. It activates EGFR
  in the osteoclast precursors, leading to their differentiation into mature OCs.
  It also promotes the secretion of osteoclastogenic cytokines, such as IL-8 from
  BM-MSCs. Another pathway in which MM-EVs promote osteolysis is linked to the balance
  between RANKL and OPG. miR-21, found in MM-EVs, targets the OPG gene in BM-MSCs
  and lowers its expression. This leads to the imbalance of RANKL/OPG and leads to
  osteoclastogenesis. MM-EVs have also been shown to contribute to the migration of
  OC precursors by producing CXCR4. What is more, MM-EVs promote the bone resorption
  by augmenting the expression of important osteoclastogenic enzymes (TRAP, CTSK,
  MMP9). AREG—amphiregulin, BMPs—bone morphogenic proteins, CTSK—Cathepsin K, CXCR4—CXC
  chemokine receptor type 4, DKK-1—Dickkopf-related protein 1, EGFR—epithelial growth
  factor receptor, IL—interleukin, lncRunx2-AS1—long-non-coding RNAs Runx2-AS1, miR-135b—micro-RNA
  135b, MSCs—mesenchymal stromal cells, MM-EVs—multiple myeloma-derived extracellular
  vesicles, MMP9—metalloproteinase 9, OBs—osteoblasts, OCs—osteoclasts, OPG—osteoprotegerin,

  factor 2, SMAD5—SMAD family member 5, TRAP—thrombospondin-related anonymous protein.
