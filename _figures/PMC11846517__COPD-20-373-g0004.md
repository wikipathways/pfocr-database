caption: A schematic representation illustrating the perturbations in metabolic pathways
  of miscellaneous metabolites during ARDS. During ARDS, the metabolism of purine
  and heme is disrupted, which further instigates the generation of secondary metabolites
  promoting inflammation and ROS production. Generally, the byproducts resulting from
  the metabolic pathway of heme exhibit protective effects on pulmonary cells. For
  additional information, refer to the main text
