caption: 'Phenazine biosynthesis [Figure modified from Mentel et al. ()]. Phenazines
  are derived from the shikimic acid pathway that is highly conserved in most organisms.
  Chorismic acid serves as the phenazine branch point once the phenazine biosynthetic
  genes (phzABCDEFG) are expressed (note phzB, phzD, phzE, phzF and phzG are considered
  the five core genes). PhzC, the third enzyme in the phenazine operon, is a type
  II-3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate that probably ensures sufficient substrate
  flow through the shikimic acid pathway for phenazine biosynthesis. The early steps
  of phenazine biosynthesis are becoming well elucidated while several of the later
  steps are not yet completely understood and differences may reflect variation in
  the final biosynthetic steps among microorganisms. From PCA a number of derivatives
  are formed by additional terminal modifying genes (not shown). For a thorough discussion
  of the pathway please see Mentel et al. ().Abbreviations: DAHP: 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate
