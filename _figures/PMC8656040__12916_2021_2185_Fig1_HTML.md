caption: Overview of the ketogenesis and ketolysis pathways. In cases of limited availability
  of oxaloacetate, beta oxidation of fatty acids in hepatocytes leads to the accumulation
  of acetyl-CoA which is channeled into the ketogenic pathway and converted to acetoacetate,
  the majority of which is reduced to βOHB, another part spontaneously decarboxylates
  to acetone. Secreted βOHB and acetoacetate are taken up by extrahepatic cells and
  converted back to acetyl-CoA. The latter can be entered into the TCA cycle after
  conjugation with oxaloacetate by citrate synthase because there is no gluconeogenesis
  that would drain local pools of pyruvate and oxaloacetate. FFA, free fatty acids;
  mThiolase, mitochondrial thiolase; HMGCS2, hydroxy methylglutaryl-CoA synthase;
  HMGCL, HMG-CoA lyase; BDH1, mitochondrial βOHB dehydrogenase; MCT1/2, monocarboxylate
  transporter 1 and 2; SCOT, succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA transferase; CS, citrate synthase
