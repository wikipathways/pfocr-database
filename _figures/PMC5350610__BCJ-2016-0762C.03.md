caption: (A) The role of CRL4CRBN in mediating protein homeostasis of endogenous substrates
  (Meis2 and glutamine synthetase); the conserved tritryptophan pocket that binds
  IMiDs is highlighted. (B) Known protein substrates of consequence (for example,
  Aiolos, Ikaros, CK1α, and GSPT1) whose rate of degradation is altered in response
  to the binding of thalidomide to the tritryptophan pocket of CRL4CRBN; as yet undiscovered
  substrates are denoted by X and Y.
