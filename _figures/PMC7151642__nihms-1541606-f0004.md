caption: In metastatic tumor cells, the cGAS-STING pathway exerts its role in promoting
  tumorigenesis. Tumors with high chromosome instability generate micronuclei, which
  ruptures and releases DNA to the cytosol. STING serves as a signaling platform for
  a diverse array of tumorigenic programs. Chronic activation of STING signaling leads
  to suppression of type 1 IFN production and concurrent upregulation of noncanonical
  NF-κB signaling, pro-survival programs and metastasis. The release of immune-stimulating
  molecules, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and anti-inflammatory cytokines,
  from tumors allows the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. STING
  may have additional roles in promoting immune evasion and metastasis through regulation
  of PD-L1 expression and induction of autophagy. Apart from cancer cell-autonomous
  roles of cGAS-STING, tumors can directly communicate with their external environment
  through the transfer of cGAMP to neighboring cells through gap junctions, which
  accelerates neoplastic progression. Artwork by Terry Helms, Graphics Department,
