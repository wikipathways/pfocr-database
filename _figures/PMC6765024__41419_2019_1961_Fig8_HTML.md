caption: Concomitant administration of GNF-2 and cyclophosphamide results in the inhibition
  of the AKT-FOXO3a signaling axis and DDR, thereby preventing cyclophosphamide-induced
  apoptosis of oocyte reserve. On the contrary, DPH enhanced the activation of the
  AKT-FOXO3a signaling axis and DDR response following cyclophosphamide injection.
  Oocyte reserve was positive for both p-AKT/p-FOXO3a and p-ATM/γH2AX; thus, the presence
  of the early marker of DDR was consistent with the activation of the AKT-FOXO3 pathway.
  This observation suggests that oocytes leave their follicular quiescence to initiate
  the DNA damage signaling pathway that leads to oocyte apoptosis
