caption: (A) The ‘Hedgehog Signaling Pathway’ page includes a description of the pathway,
  links to sub-groups and other related gene groups. The interactive Physical Interaction
  Network contains pathway gene members as nodes and physical interactions form the
  edges between them. The node size for each gene increases in the range 1–10 supporting
  papers, with no increase beyond 10, showing the relative experimental data for each
  gene's inclusion. (B) The members table for the Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Core
  Components is shown, with columns ordered by the number of references with curated
  supporting experimental data. (C) Gene Reports now feature a ‘Pathways’ section,
  which includes links to FlyBase Pathway pages and other pathway resources.
