caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism by which peripheral CB1R blockade
  improves glucose and lipid metabolism through Sirt1/mTORC2 and LKB1/AMPK signaling,
  respectively.We have shown earlier that both HFD and CB1R agonist treatment inhibit
  hepatic insulin signaling via CB1R-induced ER stress response through serine-307
  phosphorylation of IRS1 and activation of Phlpp1 (). New evidence illustrated here
  indicates that blockade of peripheral CB1R reverses the HFD-induced, endocannabinoid-mediated
  impairment of insulin signaling by activating the Sirt1/mTORC2/Akt/FOXO1 pathway,
  whereas it reverses HFD-induced hepatic steatosis by increasing fatty acid oxidation
  via Sirt1-independent, LKB1-dependent activation of AMPK. Cross-talk between the
  two pathways may be mediated via ROS, production of which is promoted by HFD-induced
  increase in FFA, resulting in mitochondrial damage and inhibition of mTORC2 complex
  formation. Note that CB1R blockade restores insulin-suppression of hepatic glucose
  production but, unlike insulin, it also inhibits hepatic lipogenesis, as documented
  elsewhere (). CB1R agonist and antagonist effects are illustrated by red and blue
  arrows, respectively. Insulin effects are illustrated by black arrows.
