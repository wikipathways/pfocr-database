caption: The mechanisms through which TLRs orchestrate pro‐tumour responses. TLR stimulation
  activates the NF‐κB cascade, which in turn increases the transcription of inflammatory
  cytokines including IFN‐α, IL‐1 and IL‐6. Activation of the NF‐κB axis not only
  promotes anti‐apoptotic factors (Bcl‐XL, Bcl‐2, survivin) but also up‐regulates
  MMPs which are responsible for the degradation of extracellular matrix. Although
  TLR4 activation leads to the production of MMP2 and β1‐integrin overexpression,
  TLR9 stimulation enhances MMP13 level in breast cancer. As represented, increasing
  of PG‐E2 and COX‐2 by TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 and phosphorylation of EGFR by TLR4 are
  the most important mechanisms in TLR‐mediated angiogenesis. Stimulation of TLRs
  in the tumour microenvironment can provoke tumour cells or tumour‐infiltrating cells
  to produce suppressor cytokines and chemokines which not only suppress immune cells
  but also attract more cells to tumour microenvironment—such as MDSC, TAMs and CAFs—to
  fulfil tumour needs. Finally, TLR downstream signalling can make tumour cells and
  tumour‐infiltrating cells to switch their metabolic pathway from oxidative phosphorylation
  to glycolysis
