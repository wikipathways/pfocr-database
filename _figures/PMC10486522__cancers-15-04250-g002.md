caption: Adiponectin and a schematic representation of adiponectin-induced signaling
  pathways. The binding of adiponectin to its receptor leads to the recruitment of
  APPL1 and APPL2, thereby activating a number of downstream signaling pathways. Adiponectin
  effects are mostly mediated via the AMPK and PPARα pathways. Stimulation of AMPK
  results in activation of SIRT1, essential in adiponectin’s regulation of glucose
  and lipid homeostasis, as well as enhanced eNOS activity, through which adiponectin
  interacts with endothelial cells. Moreover, activation of AMPK suppresses PI3K,
  mTOR and IKK/NF-κB signaling, exerting a cytoprotective effect of adiponectin. Adiponectin
  binding to AdipoRs, independently of AMPK, stimulates ceramidase activity and enhances
  ceramide catabolism and the formation of its metabolite—S1P, which is involved in
  angiogenesis. Activation of IRS1/2 by adiponectin causes increased PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  signaling, controlling cell survival, growth and apoptosis. Adiponectin signaling
  also activates other downstream intracellular signaling cascades through PKA, JNK
  and p38MAPK. Via SOCS3, adiponectin inhibits STAT3 activation, which increases proliferation,
  survival and invasion of cancer cells and suppresses anti-tumor immunity. ACC, acetyl-CoA
