caption: The biosynthesis pathway of PGE2. (A) Production of PGE2 is initiated with
  the liberation of AA by cPLA2. Arachidonic acid can then enter one of three pathways.
  (B) Lipoxygenase (LOX) converts AA to hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE) which
  is converted to leukotriene A2 (LTA2) and is further converted in the remainder
  of the leukotriene family (B4–E4) which are mainly responsible for lipid signaling.
  (C) Cytochrome P450 can also use AA as substrate which subsequently produces 16,
  20- hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 14, 15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET)
  which function in autocrine and paracrine signaling. (D) Arachidonic acid is converted
  to PGH2 by die COX isoenzymes. (E) Prostaglandin H2 is the precursor for all the
  other prostaglandins and can be converted into PGE2 (via PGE2 synthase [cPGES, mPGES-1
  and mPGES-2)], PGD2 (PGD2 synthase), PGI2 (Prostacyclin synthase), TXA2 (TX synthase)
  which functions as a vasoconstrictor. (F) PGF2α can be produced from PGH2 directly
  by endoproxide reductase or form PGE2 via 9-ketoreductase. Adapted from Jenkins
