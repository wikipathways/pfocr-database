caption: (A) The orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 is expressed by microglia following
  stimulation of the NF-κB pathway by LPS. Phosphorylation of p65 at S468 by GSK3β
  then acts as a docking site for Nurr1 interaction in the nucleus. Nurr1 then recruits
  the CoREST transcriptional co-repressor complex to DNA bound p65 subunits. CoREST
  is composed of chromatin-modifying enzymes which terminate NF-κB transcription.
  (B) In macrophages CITED2 expression is induced by LPS stimulation in an NF-κB-dependent
  manner. CITED2 localises to the nucleus where it interacts with the NF-κB coactivator
  p300, thereby impairing p65 acetylation, inhibiting retention of p65 at target promoters
  and reducing gene expression. See text for details.
