caption: A diagram of signaling pathway for genistein-induced apoptosis in Bax and
  p53-independent manner. Genistein first induced Akt dephosphorylation. p-Akt decrease
  activated Bid to tBid. Bid cleavage induced the release of AIF and endoG as well
  as Bak activation. Activated Bak triggered caspase-dependent apoptosis, while AIF
  and endoG release initiated caspase-independent cell death. Activated caspase-3
  mediated two positive feedback loops to enhance apoptosis. On one hand, caspase-3
  feedback enhances Bak activation (the blue solid line); on the other hand, caspase-3
  probably strengthened the release of AIF and endoG (the blue dotted line)
