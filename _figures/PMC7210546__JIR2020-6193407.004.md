caption: The possible cross-regulation of RAS and TLR4 in mediating the inflammation
  of DN. By binding to AT1R, Ang II upregulates TLR4 with consequent activation of
  MyD88/MAPK pathway, resulting in NF-κB activation as well as production of proinflammatory
  cytokines, chemokines, and profibrotic factors that contribute to diabetic nephropathy.
  In addition, activated TLR4/MyD88/MAPK signaling cascade enables to induce ACE and
  AT1 expression, Ang II production, and inflammation in DN.
