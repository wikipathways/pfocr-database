caption: The activin signalling pathway. The activin signalling pathway is a subset
  of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway.
  Activins are dimers composed of two inhibin-beta chains (inhibin-βA and -βB) that
  have a high affinity for the type 2 receptors, ACTRIIA and ACTRIIB. Upon binding
  of activin A, activin B or activin A/B, these receptors recruit a type 1 receptor
  (ALK4 or ALK7). This recruitment leads to the phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which
  occurs to varying degrees and durations. The phosphorylated Smad2/3 then translocates
  to the nucleus in complex with Smad4 to regulate the expression of target genes
  involved in various cellular functions. These cellular functions include the modulation
  of endothelial cell activities such as tube formation, the regulation of smooth
  muscle cell contractility, and the recruitment and activation of inflammatory and
  immune cells. The pathway is tightly regulated at multiple levels, starting from
  the formation of activin dimers. The inhibin-β chains can also bind to an inhibin-α
  chain to form inhibin A and inhibin B, which do not induce the phosphorylation of
  Smad2/3. Furthermore, the binding of activin A, B, or A/B dimers can be inhibited
  by follistatin and follistatin-like 3 (FSTL3). Figure created with BioRender
