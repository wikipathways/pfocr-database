caption: The regulatory roles of seed priming with GA in mitigating salt stress. Salt
  enters the plants through the roots, which creates toxic effects on the plants due
  to the accumulation of sodium (Na+). The higher availability of Na+ in soils makes
  the plants more susceptible to osmotic pressure, ion toxicity, and nutrient imbalances.
  Seed priming with GA before sowing can protect the seeds from germination through
  to maturity and enhance the crop yield.
