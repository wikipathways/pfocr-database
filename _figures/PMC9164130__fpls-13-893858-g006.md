caption: Proposed mechanism of AGP-like enriched fraction (AGPs) and ulvan action
  based on transcription of signaling pathway marker genes. AGPs activate the salicylic
  acid signaling pathway via isochorismate synthase 1 and the ethylene signaling pathway
  via ACC synthase. Ulvan activates the ethylene signaling pathway based on gene expression
  of βCHI and probably also jasmonic acid signaling pathway based on VSP expression.
  Full arrows indicate proven involvement of the pathways, and dashed arrows indicate
  likely involvement of the pathways.
