caption: In the setting of diabetes, excess glucose activates several pathways including
  the polyol pathway, hexosamine pathway, as well as signals that lead to activation
  of Rho-kinase (ROCK), PKC and generation of AGEs. All of these activation results
  in oxidant/antioxidant imbalance that proceeds to DKD. AR, aldose reductase; SDH,
  sorbitol dehydrogenase; GFAT, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase; glucosamine-6-P,
  glucosamine-6-phosphate; UDP-GlcNAc, uridine diphosphate-N-acetyl glucosamine; DAG,
  diacylglycerol; PKC, protein kinase C; AGEs, advanced glycation end-products.
