caption: Potential fate of extracellular 8-oxodG, and 8-oxoGua, by metabolic salvage
  pathways. Neither 8-oxodG, nor 8-oxodGMP can be phosphorylated, as they are not
  substrates for deoxynucleoside kinase, or guanylate kinase, respectively. Therefore
  the alternative pathway, discussed by Hah et al. [], relies upon degradation of
  extracellular 8-oxodG to 8-oxoGua, perhaps by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP).
  6-Hydroxypurine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) can catalyse the formation
  of 8-oxoguanosine monophosphate, providing a route for the oxidised moiety, via
  nucleoside-phosphate kinase (NPK) and nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDK), to be
  incorporated into RNA. In this model ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase (RDR)
  is responsible for the conversion of 8-oxoguanine-containing ribonucleotides to
  deoxyribonucleotide equivalents. Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase then catalyses the
  phosphorylation of 8-oxodGDP to 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine triphosphate,
  a substrate for DNA polymerases for incorporation into DNA. Potential sources of
  extracellular 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua are indicated (diet, death, DNA repair) contributions
  from which may have profound implications for the cell, and our understanding of
  what measurement of these biomarkers of oxidative stress really means.
