caption: Proposed biosynthesis pathway for tumor-associated gangliosides. Tumor-associated
  gangliosides are synthesized from lactosyl-ceramide (LacCer) by the action of the
  GM3 synthase ST3Gal V that transfers a first sialic acid residue to form GM3 (precursor
  of the a-series gangliosides). The elongation of GM3 is performed by the sequential
  action of the β4GalNAc T1 and β3Gal T4 to form GM1, which is further fucosylated
  by the α1,2-fucosyltransferases FUT1 and FUT2. Alternatively, the action of the
  GD3 synthase ST8Sia I converts GM3 in GD3, the precursor of the b-series gangliosides,
  which is the substrate of the β4GalNAc T1 that forms GD2. Finally, GD3 and GD2 can
  be acetylated by CASD1 sialate O-acetyl-transferase on the C9 position of sialic
  acids to form 9-O-acetylated GD3 (9-OAcGD3) and 9-O-acetylated GD2 (9-OAcGD2), respectively.
  It has also been proposed that O-acetylated GD3 can be formed by the transfer of
  CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 on GM3 by the GD3 synthase. The effects of β4GalNAc T1 and β3Gal T4
  on OAcGD3 and OAcGD2, respectively, are currently unknown.
