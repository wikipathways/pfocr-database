caption: Graphic pathway diagram depicting altered components (enhanced) of folate
  metabolism in Oat3 knockout kidney generated by Recon 1 analysis. The enhanced pathways
  of DHFR, MTHFC, and MTHFD were also listed in . This diagram is a portion of the
  global overview of predicted global changes in pathways by Recon 1 analysis, which
  can be found in Supplemental Fig. 1.
