caption: Abbreviated pathway for the biosynthesis and turnover of 1-deoxy-sphingoid
  bases and traditional sphingoid bases. This scheme summarizes the steps of de novo
  biosynthesis of traditional sphingoid bases (sphinganine and sphingosine) in red,
  as well as their turnover via phosphorylation and cleavage. The carbons from palmitate
  are shown in blue. The analogous metabolic steps are shown in green, as far as they
  are thought to occur-for 1-deoxysphinganine (produced from alanine) and 1-(deoxymethyl)sphinganine
  (produced from glycine, not shown). The dashed line indicates the known N-methylation
  of sphingoid bases, which might also occur for 1-deoxy-sphingoid bases, but this
  has not yet been established. For more information, see the text and Ref. .
