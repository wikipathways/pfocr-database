caption: Commonly upregulated orthologs in the toll/interleukin signaling pathway
  between Aplysia SN aging and FL LOAD. Each box represents a gene and is subdivided
  into nine sections corresponding to analyzed data sets; the first three are Aplysia
  SN data sets and the latter six are FL LOAD results from Li et al. () as demarcated
  in the Key. Each section is colored to indicate whether the genes were upregulated
  (red), downregulated (blue), or exhibited no change (gray) in the corresponding
  data set. Solid line arrows represent a direct interaction, while dotted lines signify
  indirect interaction via intermediaries. Example genes known to be upregulated by
  NF-kB that were common to both Aplysia SN aging and FL LOAD are listed at the bottom
  of the figure. Commonly upregulated genes include toll/interleukin signaling adapter
  protein MYD88 and several components of the NF-kB signaling cascade (IκΒα, NF-κΒ1,
  TPL2), suggesting that increased proinflammatory signaling is a common feature of
  Aplysia SN aging and FL LOAD
