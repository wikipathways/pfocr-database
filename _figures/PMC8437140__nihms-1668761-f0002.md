caption: Increased H19 expression in cholangiocytes leads to cholestatic liver injury
  and fibrosis through dysregulation of the bile acid pathway. SHP represses H19 under
  normal liver conditions. Following liver injury, BCL2 is upregulated causing SHP
  repression via the caspase 8 pathway. An excess of TCA and estrogen can cause similar
  repression of SHP via the ERK1/2 pathway. The repression of SHP increases H19 expression
  in cholangiocytes and causes repression of ZEB1 and upregulation of EpCAM. Similarly,
  H19 represses PTBP1 causing increased amounts of let7 family precursors. Dysregulation
  of these pathways causes bile acid accumulation, further increasing H19 expression
  in a feed-forward mechanism. As the disease state progresses, cholestasis and fibrosis
  of the liver can occur. Cholangiocytes can produce exosomal H19, that travels to
  hepatocytes, HSCs, and Kupffer cells.
