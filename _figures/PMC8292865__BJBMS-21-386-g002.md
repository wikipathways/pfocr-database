caption: Impact of epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A to cell signaling pathways.
  Red arrows represent disturbed or deactivated, while green ones represent activated
  signaling pathways. When expressed normally, RASSF1A causes repression of cyclin
  A2 and cyclin D1, which results in cell cycle arrest. RASSF1A also modulates apoptosis.
  Interactions of RASSF1A with K-Ras activates the MST2-LATS1 apoptotic pathway, i.e.,
  RASSF1A modulates the RAF-1 activity due to competition with MST2 for RAF-1 binding.
  Also, the interaction of RASSF1A with K-Ras, enhances the interaction of RASSF1A
  and MOAP-1, promoting RASSF1A’s ability to induce BAX translocation to the mitochondria
  and cell death. RASSF1A binds to MST1/2 with adaptor protein WW45 that causes phosphorylation,
  respectively, leading to YAP phosphorylation and inhibition. Additionally, RASSF1A
  plays an important role in microtubule stability, by inhibiting HDAC6 (histone deacetylase
  6), which results in an increase of acetylated microtubules, that are more stable.
  RASSF1A binds to microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) which regulate microtubule
  stability. If RASSF1A is epigenetically inactivated, it causes microtubule instability,
  repression of apoptosis, and progression of the cell cycle, which favors tumorigenesis
