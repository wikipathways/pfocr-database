caption: 'Diagram of the formative process and mechanism of action of miR497/TP-HENPs.
  miR497/TP-HENPs were synthesized by membrane fusion and biomineralization methods.
  First, liposomes were synthesized by assembly with DSPE-PEG1k-cRGD, phosphatidylcholine
  (PC), cholesterol and encapsulated TP. Then, liposomes and exosomes were fused by
  membrane fusion. Finally, CaP adsorbed miR497 on the surface of nanoparticles. The
  mechanisms by which miR497/TP-HENPs operated in OC cells were as follows: a the
  enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect were generated from the nanoscale
  size of the nanoplatforms, b the homing targeting of exosomes and cRGD further enhanced
  the targeting efficiency of nanoparticles, c CD47 on the exosome surface avoided
  nanoparticle clearance by the MPS system, d miR497 and TP synergistically inhibited
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, e TP stimulated ROS production, and f TP modulated polarization
  of M2 macrophages into M1 macrophages, synergistically overcoming OC resistance'
