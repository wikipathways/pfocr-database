caption: 'The figure shows interaction mechanisms between cancer cells and: (1) Hepatocytes:
  overexpression of TIMP (Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase) is presumed to cause
  poor prognosis in patients. At the same time, TWIST1 (Twist Basic Helix–Loop–Helix
  Transcription Factor 1) and FAM27L (Family With Sequence Similarity 27-Like) expression
  disruption, as well as the same probably in case of insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1)
  may lead to metastases formation. (2) Normal healthy cells: overexpression of Wnt
  protein causes the up-regulation of IL-15 (interleukin-15), which is the probable
  cause of the excessive epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). After several
  subsequent processes, the process of carcinogenesis is presumably induced. (3) Interactions
  between cancer cells and pleural/peritoneal cells, as well as between cancer cells
  and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have one significant molecule in common—it
  is TGF-β (transforming growth factor beta), whose overexpression leads to CAFs recruitment.
  The main probable reasons of TGF-β overexpression is the expression of angiopoietin-like
  4 (ANGPT4L) which acts via Smad signalling pathway.'
