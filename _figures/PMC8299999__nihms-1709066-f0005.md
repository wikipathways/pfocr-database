caption: 'Atheroprotective features of the IMA. The intimal layer of the IMA is characterized
  by few fenestrations and low intercellular permeability. Interestingly, intimal
  hyperplasia is almost absent in the IMA even in patients with progressive atherosclerotic
  disease. Enhanced eNOS expression contributes to the accentuated NO release upon
  exposure to calcium-ionophore. Note that the age-dependent decrease in the telomeric
  length is lower in intimal tissue of the IMA compared to the iliac artery. Anatomically,
  the IMA is characterized by well-defined IEL which is rich in heparan-sulfate. The
  tunica media of the IMA is abundant in elastic fibers which VSMCs are embedded in.
  Interestingly, these cells show low TF and tPA expression and display a remarkable
  resistance to migration and proliferation, even if exposed to growth factors or
  pulsatile stress. In stark contrast to vessels with high propensity to develop atheroma,
  the tunica externa of the IMA is almost devoid of vasa vasorum. Abbreviations: eNOS,
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase; IEL, internal elastic lamina; IMA, internal mammary
  artery; NO, nitric oxide; TF, tissue factor; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor;
  tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator.'
