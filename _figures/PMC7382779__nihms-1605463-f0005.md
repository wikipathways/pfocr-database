caption: For each kinase and phosphatase, GO categories enriched among their regulated
  proteins or phosphoproteins were computed.(A) Part of the enrichment analysis results
  on protein effectors using the Uniprot biological pathways database (see  for full
  results). Cells with black borders indicate kinases and phosphatases for which known
  pathways were enriched in their protein effectors.(B) Part of the enrichment analysis
  results on phosphoprotein effectors using the Uniprot biological pathways database
  (see  for full results). Cells with black borders are the same as in (A).(C) Examples
  showed functionally related kinases and phosphatases in regulating proteins involved
  in glucose import, ergosterol biosynthesis, and proteasome.(D) Examples of subnetworks
  of kinases and phosphatases coordinately modulating the TOR signaling pathway and
  glycolysis.See also  and  and .
