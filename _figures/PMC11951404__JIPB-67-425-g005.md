caption: Transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of CONSTANS (CO) CO acts
  as the core regulator of the photoperiod response pathway to integrate external
  and internal signals into the photoperiodic flowering pathway. The transcript (upper)
  and protein abundance (lower) of CO are precisely controlled by circadian clock
  proteins, photoreceptors, and other factors. CO transcription is repressed by CYCLING
  DOF FACTORs (CDFs). This process is induced by CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1)
  and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) but inhibited by PSEUDO‐RESPONSE REGULATORs (PRRs)
  and the FLAVIN‐BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F‐BOX 1–GIGANTEA (FKF1‐GI) complex. PRRs also
  suppress the transcription of CCA1 and LHY. When the inhibition of CO transcription
  by CDFs is relieved, the CO transcriptional activators FLOWERING BHLHs (FBHs) obtain
  access to the its promoter. The chromatin‐remodeling factor JUMANJI 28 (JMJ28) is
  recruited by FBHs to activate CO transcription. Class II TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING
  CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN FACTORs (TCPs) also activate CO transcription in a GI‐dependent
  manner. CO protein stability is regulated by intricate mechanisms. In the dark,
  the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex comprising CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1)
  and SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA‐105s (SPAs) directly binds to and degrades CO. SHAGGY‐like
  kinase 12 (SK12)‐dependent phosphorylation of CO directs this protein toward the
  ubiquitination degradation pathway, whereas FK506‐binding protein (FKBP12) suppresses
  the degradation of phosphorylated CO. Under red light, HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY
  RESPONSIVE GENES 1 (HOS1) ubiquitinates CO. The red‐light photoreceptor PHYTOCHROME
  B (phyB) functions in the degradation of CO, while PHYTOCHROME‐DEPENDENT LATE‐FLOWERING
  (PHL) represses its function. The far‐red‐light photoreceptor PHYTOCHROME A (phyA)
  enhances the stability of CO. The circadian clock component EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3)
  degrades CO. Blue‐light photoreceptors, including CRYPTOCHROMES (CRYs) and FKF1,
  stabilize CO, whereas ZEITLUPE (ZTL) degrades this protein. The circadian clock
  components PRRs stabilize CO. The green and blue lines illustrate CO mRNA and protein
  levels, respectively, in wild‐type plants under different photoperiod conditions
