caption: 'Integration of soluble sugar dynamics and Glc-6-P regulation. Red and green
  filled arrows represent, respectively, positive and negative Pearson correlations
  between directly connected metabolites in a pathway; red and green hatched arrows
  represent, respectively, positive and negative Pearson correlations between indirectly
  connected metabolites. Colourless arrows represent metabolic pathways without significant
  Pearson correlation. For each metabolite, the corresponding cluster (as defined
  in ) is indicated in brackets. Shaded metabolites correlate to physiological parameters
  (). The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) for each pair of metabolites is shown.
  Asterisks indicate significant correlations: *P≤0.05, **P≤0.001, and ***P≤0.0001.
