caption: Main immunological pathways in human antigen presenting cells (APCs) after
  mycobacterial RNA recognition. (a) Mycobacteria are engulfed into phagosomes of
  macrophages and APCs, where RNA is released, eventually stimulating the endosomal
  receptors TLR8 (ssRNA) and -3 (dsRNA). Activated TLR8 with its adaptor protein MyD88
  induces a signal transduction cascade including NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO)
  ultimately leading to the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus. Furthermore,
  mainly interferon response factor (IRF)-5 and to a minor part IRF-7 translocate
  into the nucleus and activate genes. TLR3 with the adapter protein TRIF leads to
  translocation of IRF-3 and -7 into the nucleus. NFκB promotes the synthesis of IL-18,
  IL-12, IFNγ and TNFα, while IRFs promote the production of type I interferons, which
  activate natural killer (NK) cells to further promote IFNγ in the sense of a feed-forward
  loop []. At the same time, activation of TLR8 enhances production of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) through activation of Cytochrome b (-245) beta (CYBB)/NADPH oxidase
  2 (NOX2), which will themselves activate the canonical inflammation pathway through
  Cathepsin B translocating to the cytosol [,]. (b) After transition to the cytosol,
  mycobacterial RNA stimulates NLRP3 of the inflammasome, which lead to caspase-1
  dependent production of IL-18, IL-1β and pyroptosis [,], as well as the RLRs Rig-1
  and MDA5, leading to expression of type I IFNs []. These cytokines will again stimulate
  NK cells to produce IFNγ. (c) Simultaneously, activation of NLRP3 inhibits CYBB/NOX2
  in the sense of a negative-feedback loop [].
