caption: Shown is an illustration highlighting the major features of a model for a
  signaling pathway involved in controlling the initiation of cell constriction by
  the divisome. The transition of FtsA from an OFF to an ON conformation appears to
  be one of the major signals and may involve a change in polymerization state (step
  1). The ON conformation of FtsA may then promote an altered, more stable, form of
  the Z-ring as well as directly or indirectly signaling its altered status to the
  FtsQLB complex (step 2). Because reduced FtsA self interaction bypasses the essential
  functions of FtsN, FtsN may normally facilitate the disruption of FtsA polymers
  to stimulate constriction (step 1). The essential domain of FtsN (E) is also likely
  to either communicate the status of divisome assembly directly to the FtsQLB complex
  to stimulate constriction (step 3) or stimulate the synthesis of septal PG by activating
  the septal PG biogenesis machinery (FtsW and FtsI) directly in a manner that is
  redundant with FtsQLB activity (not shown). Similarly, given that FtsA and FtsL
  variants can bypass FtsK function, FtsK may also play a role in modulating FtsA
  conformation and or the communication of divisome assembly status directly to FtsQLB
  (not shown). The input from upstream signals received by FtsQLB is likely to cause
  a conformational change in the complex that is, in turn, communicated to FtsW, FtsI,
  and the rest of the PG synthetic apparatus to stimulate cell wall remodeling and
  cell constriction (steps 4, 5, and 6). The entire process is likely to be reinforced
  by positive feedback loops involving FtsN recruitment (step 7) and possibly other
  as yet to be identified feedbacks. See text for details, and also the accompanying
  paper from Liu and co-workers for additional support for this general scheme ().
