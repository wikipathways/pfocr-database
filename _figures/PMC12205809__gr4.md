caption: Interleukin (IL)-10/11/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and transforming growth
  factor (TGF) pro-inflammatory cytokines play a role in breast cancer in postmenopausal
  women and senescence cells, as shown in the illustration. (A) There is a correlation
  between higher expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins and IL-10,
  and they contribute to the aggressiveness of breast cancer via signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. The significant activation of
  IL-10 positive is correlated with mammographic density during breast cancer. Aged
  patients secrete a large amount of IL-11 and receptor IL-11Rα, which contribute
  to bone metastasis through the p-STAT3 pathway. (B) Higher levels of the inflammatory
  marker TNF-α are strongly associated with an increased risk of cancer-related mortality
  in elderly patients. TNF receptors, such as TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
  (TRAIL) 1, 2, 3, and 4, play a crucial role in preventing cancer cell apoptosis
  and progression. However, TRAIL activation of death receptor 4/5 (DR4/5) promotes
  apoptosis in breast cancer cells but may also induce senescence. Endothelial cells
  (ECs) down-regulate the expression of TRAIL2, which reduces the apoptosis process
  in breast cancer. (C1) The breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 enhances surface proteoglycan
  syndecan 1 (SDC1) expression in young and senescent breast fibroblasts via TGF-β
  in a paracrine manner. On the other hand, exposure to ionizing radiation in early
  passage human breast stromal fibroblasts can cause premature senescence. This results
  in the formation of an autocrine TGF-β loop that leads to SDC1 overexpression via
  the Smad (small mothers against decapentaplegic) pathway. This suggests that ionizing
  radiation and invasive cancer cells have a synergistic effect leading to the overexpression
  of SDC1, which is a known poor prognostic factor in breast cancer development. (C2)
  TGF-β/connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression in stromal fibroblasts leads
  to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1 (HIF1)-transcription factor. HIF1-activation then promotes the induction
  of autophagy, mitophagy, and glycolysis. Autophagy drives the onset of senescence
  via the autophagy–senescence transition (AST), resulting in the up-regulation of
  cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (p21 and p16 as well as β-galactosidase)
  (a lysosomal enzyme and marker of senescence). Oxidative stress, autophagy, and
  senescence may also contribute to CTGF-induced fibrosis and extracellular matrix
  (ECM) remodeling. The symbol of a red arrow pointing downwards (↓) is used to indicate
  down-regulation
