caption: A recombination event is initiated by a DNA break and leads to crossover
  or non-crossover products. First, the DNA ends are resected to produce single-stranded
  DNA, which in a reaction catalyzed by RAD51 recombinase can then invade the homologous
  duplex DNA to form a recombination intermediate, or D-loop structure. After homologous
  recombination is initiated by RAD51 at one end of the broken DNA, the second DNA
  end may be captured by the unpaired strand of the homologous DNA. The resulting
  recombination intermediate can proceed to form double Holliday junctions (HJs),
  and any remaining gaps may be filled by DNA synthesis. HJs can be cleaved by HJ
  resolvase (center right) or dissociated by the BLM-dependent pathway (center left).
  In mitotic cells, it is argued that the majority of homologous recombination is
  completed without the formation of HJs. Instead, most homologous recombination events
  are completed by synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) to generate non-crossover
  products that result from dissociation of the D-loop after DNA synthesis (left).
  The newly synthesized DNA is available to re-anneal with the second end of the same
  DNA molecule at the break site. DNA synthesis continues to fill the gap and restore
  the integrity of the DNA without crossover. Alternatively, D-loop structure can
  be cleaved to generate sister chromatid exchange (SCE) products (right). Possible
  points of RECQ5 action discussed in the text are indicated by (1), (2), and (3).
