caption: Roles of PAK1 and PAK2 in the regulation of vascular integrity and permeability.
  PAK1 and PAK2 collaboratively modulate vascular integrity and endothelial function
  by targeting VE-cadherin, which affects the stability of intercellular junctions.
  PAK1 exerts its individual influence on platelet activation and apoptosis through
  the Notch signaling pathway and directly impacts vascular permeability via VEGF.
  Meanwhile, PAK2 regulates the formation of cell pseudopodia and adhesion sites through
  interactions with AF6, LIMK, and β-Pix, thereby affecting endothelial permeability
