caption: Synthesis, utilization, and regeneration of glutathione and regulation of
  mTORC1 activity. (A) Diagrammed is the pathway for the synthesis, utilization, and
  regeneration of reduced glutathione, which is needed to rid cells of superoxides
  (O2−) and H2O2. (B) mTORC1 activity is primarily mediated by the PI3K-Akt-TSC pathway.
  In this pathway, activation of PI3K leads to activation of Akt, which phosphorylates
  and inactivates the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1 and −2). This inhibits TSC's
  GTPase-activating protein (GAP) function, allowing the accumulation of Rheb-GTP,
  which activates mTORC1. In HCMV-infected cells, the activity of the TSC is inhibited
  by the viral protein UL38 (). This allows Rheb-GTP levels to be maintained for mTORC1
  activation. The UL38-mediated inhibition of the TSC blocks the effects of stress
  signaling and activated AMPK, which normally activate the TSC. However, ROS inactivation
  of mTORC1 is TSC independent; it has been suggested that this is mediated in part
  by AMPK activation and direct phosphorylation of the raptor subunit of mTORC1, which
  is thought to be inhibitory ().
