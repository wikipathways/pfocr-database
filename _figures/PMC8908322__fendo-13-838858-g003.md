caption: Function of the AR signaling pathway in SCs in spermatogenesis. AR dimers
  in the nucleus can bind to the ARE of GATA-2 to inhibit its expression. Downregulated
  protein levels of GATA-2 downregulate Wt1 and β1-integrin to promote SSC differentiation.
  The AR also promotes SSC differentiation by repressing Wnt5a. However, the precise
  pathway between AR and Wnt5a remains unknown. Through unknown pathway, AR allows
  SCs to secret GDNF for SSC maintenance (shown in green dotted line). Testosterone
  can also induce the expression of Igf3 through a non-classical signaling pathway
  to promote SSC differentiation. Through an unknown pathway, the AR represses the
  expression of Nrg1, Egf, Btc and Ngfr to induce the onset of meiosis (shown in orange).
  To protect GCs from apoptosis during meiosis, AR dimers bind to the AREs in the
  promoters of Rhox5 and Hsf1. Upregulated protein levels of Rhox5 repress Unc5c expression
  (shown in brown). Downregulation of Hsf1 can also protect GCs from apoptosis (shown
  in brown). Also, AR signaling in SCs can inhibit UCHL1 expression in spermatocytes
  to prevent them from apoptosis (shown in brown). In addition, the clearance of apoptotic
  cells is also important. Testosterone inhibits miR-471-5p and thereby upregulates
  the expression of Dock1, ATG12, BECN1 and TFCPR1, resulting in clearance by SCs
  (shown in red). Elmo1 upregulation by AR dimerization can also promote this process
  (shown in red). During spermiogenesis and spermiation, non-classical signaling induces
  the expression of testin, which is needed for proper adherence junctions (AJ) dynamics
  (purple solid line). The residual body from the maturing sperm will be absorbed
  by the concerted action of Stx5a, Picalm and Eea1 (shown in green). AR dimers also
  bind to the coactivator Src1 to induce the expression of Stx5a and to the corepressor
  NCoR1 to repress the expression of Picalm and Eea1. Spermatid development is also
  regulated by AR signaling. AR signaling in SCs induce GRTH and PMCA4 transcription
  and expression in spermatids which will promote their development and motility respectively
  (shown in blue line). Sperm release is facilitated by Src-mediated molecular processes
  (indicated by the purple dotted line). ‘?’ indicates an unknown pathway.
