caption: CBS deficiency suppressed erythropoiesis mainly by disrupting expression
  of heme biosynthetic enzymes and transporter. CBS deficiency could induce a significant
  reduction in the expression of ALAS2 and FECH, two key enzymes involved in the heme
  biosynthetic pathway, and FLVCR, an exporter of heme from the cytosol and mitochondria,
  inhibiting heme biosynthesis and transport of heme from the cytosol and mitochondria
  in the bone marrow. Also, CBS deficiency could down-regulate HIF-2α and up-regulate
  IL-6 expression, and then inhibit EPO expression, and the reduced expression in
  EPO could increase apoptosis of CFU-Es and reduce the number of erythroblasts, which
  may also contribute to the suppressed erythropoiesis in CBS deficiency mice. In
  addition to the reduced iron utilization, the increased iron contents in the erythroblasts
  and bone marrow may be partly associated the reduced Fpn1 expression and then iron
  release from the bone marrow cells in CBS−/− mice. The up-regulation of hepcidin
  in CBS−/− mice may be due to the increased expression of IL-6 (IL-6/STAT3 pathway)
  and reduced contents of HIF2a/EFRE (HIF2a/EPO/EPOR/EFRE pathway). (ALAS2 delta-aminolevulinate
