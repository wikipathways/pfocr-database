caption: BNC1 directly regulates Nf2 expression. BNC1 deficiency downregulates NF2
  expression, which reduces YAP phosphorylation and promote YAP nuclear accumulation.
  YAP activation upregulates Tfrc and Acsl4 expression, followed by increased iron
  uptake and enhanced lipid ROS production, which ultimately leads to oocyte ferroptosis.
