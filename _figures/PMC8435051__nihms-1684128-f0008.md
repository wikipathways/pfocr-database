caption: Upregulation of Fkbp5 expression by ethanol is secondary to downregulation
  of methylation level at its 5′UTR promoter region. FKBP5 is associated with an increase
  in hepatic di- and tri-acylglycerols. It also affects the biosynthesis of hepatic
  PCs leading to worsening hepatic steatosis. FKBP5 can interact with YAP upstream
  kinase, MST1, affecting its ability to phosphorylate YAP and the inhibitory effect
  of hepatic YAP phosphorylation by ethanol leading to YAP nuclear translocation and
  TEAD activation. Activation of TEAD1 led to increased expression of its novel target,
  CXCL1, a chemokine-mediated neutrophil recruitment, causing hepatic inflammation
  and neutrophil infiltration. Taken together, we identified a novel role of the FKBP5-YAP-TEAD1-CXCL1
  axis in the pathogenesis of ALD.
