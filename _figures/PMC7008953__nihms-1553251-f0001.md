caption: 'PC metabolism in mammalian cells. PC is synthesized de novo through the
  Kennedy pathway. Choline is first phosphorylated by choline kinase to generate phosphocholine,
  followed by the formation of CDP-choline catalyzed by CT. Finally, CDP-choline is
  converted into PC by CPT. In liver, PC can also be generated through the PEMT pathway
  in which PE is sequentially methylated by PEMT. De novo synthesized PC undergoes
  remodeling in a process called Lands’ cycle, which determines the acyl chain linked
  to PC species at the sn-2 position. Fatty acyl chains at sn-2 site of PC are hydrolyzed
  by PLA2s. The resulting lysoPC is reacylated by LPCATs. LPCATs catalyze the incorporation
  of another fatty acyl chain into the sn-2 site of lysoPC to produce a new PC species.
