caption: MAPK pathways regulating invasive-filamentous and mating developments. The
  invasive-filamentous pathway is depicted on the left, and the mating pathway is
  shown on the right. Ste5 binds Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3 proteins and is required for
  pheromone-induced signaling (). FRE, filamentation- and invasion-responsive element;
  PRE, pheromone-responsive element; Pbox, Mcm1 binding site. In the invasive-filamentous
  pathway, Ste12 binds to FRE cooperatively with Tec1. Ste12 acts in the mating pathway
  by binding to DNA as a homomultimer or as a heteromultimer with Mcm1.
