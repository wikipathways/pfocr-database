caption: Modular representation of the mechanism of action of genistein in AML, based
  on empirical evidences. Genistein exerts its anti-leukemic effect in AML cells via
  down-regulation of the mTOR pathway leading to repression of protein synthesis,
  induction of cell cycle arrest, and elevation of apoptosis. The only difference
  in the mode of action by genistein between the two AML cell lines is that G1 cell
  cycle arrest is triggered in MV4-11 cells but G2/M cell cycle arrest is triggered
  in HL-60 cells.
