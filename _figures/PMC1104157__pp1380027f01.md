caption: An example of an AraCyc pathway. A pathway evidence, which could be either
  computational (indicated by a computer icon) or experimental (indicated by a flask
  icon), provides assertion of the existence of the pathway in Arabidopsis. Similarly,
  evidence attached to an enzyme provides assertion of its catalytic activity involved
  in a specific reaction. Each piece of evidence is associated with a citation from
  where the source of the evidence can be found. Reactions without any Arabidopsis
  genes or enzymes assigned are called pathway holes. Pathways can be zoomed to show
  various levels of details. Compounds, reactions, enzymes, and genes on a pathway
  page are clickable for more information.
