caption: The 2 metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG).
  The monoacylglycerol (MAG) pathway, also known as the remodeling pathway, begins
  with the acylation of MAG with fatty acyl-CoA catalyzed by monoacylglycerol acyltransferase
  (MGAT). This pathway dominates in the small intestine, a tissue primarily responsible
  for dietary fat absorption. The glycerol 3-phosphate (G-3-P) pathway is a de novo
  pathway involved in TAG synthesis in most tissues. The G-3-P pathway begins with
  the acylation of G-3-P by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) with fatty
  acyl-CoA, producing lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), followed sequentially by further
  acylation by LPA acyltransferase (LPAAT) and dephosphorylation by phosphatidic acid
  (PA) phosphorylase (PAP) to yield diacylgycerol (DAG). The 2 pathways share the
  final step in converting DAG into TAG, which is catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase
  (DGAT). DAG is also used as a substrate for the synthesis of phosphatidic choline
  (PC) and phosphatidic ethanolamine (PE).
