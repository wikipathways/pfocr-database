caption: Model for the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (A) In the absence
  of a Wnt signal, β-catenin is phosphorylated and targeted for proteasome-mediated
  degradation by a destruction complex that contains axin and Gsk3β among other proteins.
  (B) On binding of Wnt to the receptors Fz and LRP, Dvl binds to Fz and recruits
  the destruction complex through interaction with axin. Subsequently, Gsk3β phosphorylates
  critical sites on LRP, which, together with residues phosphorylated by CkIγ, act
  as docking sites for axin. (C) Binding of axin to LRP leads to inhibition of the
  destruction complex and stabilization of β-catenin. CkIγ, casein kinase Iγ; Dvl,
  dishevelled; Fz, Frizzled; Gsk3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β.
