caption: Mechanistic pathways implicated in the human studies of ventilator-induced
  diaphragmatic dysfunction in critically ill patients. Diaphragmatic inactivity induced
  by mechanical ventilation is associated with an increased generation of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and a downregulation of the Akt pathway. This leads to increased
  proteolysis in the diaphragm via activation of the caspase, calpain, ubiquitin-proteasome,
  and lysosomal-autophagic pathways. In addition, downregulation of the Akt pathway
  also inhibits protein synthesis (dotted line). Collectively, all of the above contribute
  to atrophy and injury of diaphragmatic muscle fibers, resulting in functional impairment
  of the diaphragm. Akt-P, phosphorylated (activated) form of protein kinase B.
