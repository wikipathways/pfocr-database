caption: Cytosolic DNA of microbial or self-origin is a potent trigger of type I IFN
  production via STING-TBK1-IRF3 axis, as well as other proinflammatory genes (e.g.
  TNFα and IL-6) by engaging NF-κB signaling. Distinct cytosolic DNA sensors along
  with their select activating conditions are shown, which are discussed in detail
  in text. The DNA-induced signaling pathway converges on the adaptor STING and the
  kinase TBK1, which phosphorylates IRF3 to mediate downstream signaling events leading
  to transcriptional induction of inflammatory genes. Beyond cytosolic DNA, bacterial
  small molecules, c-di-AMP and c-di-GMP acts as a potent stimulator of type I IFN
  a response by engaging STING either as a direct sensor or co-activator (discussed
  in text). Host cells employ distinct nucleases to eliminate both self and non-self
  DNA from extracellular space (DNase I), phago-lysosomes (DNase II) and cytosol (DNase
  III; Trex1) to avoid deleterious effects of excess DNA-induced immune responses.
