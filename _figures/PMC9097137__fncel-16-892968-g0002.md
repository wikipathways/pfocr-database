caption: 'Metabolic factors impacting oligodendroglial development and function. Oligodendrocytes
  (OLs) are metabolically active cells that both myelinate and provide trophic support
  to neurons, as well as supply metabolites to neurons and other cells of the CNS.
  Many metabolic factors can alter OL function including (but not limited to): glucose
  and lipid metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can generate pro- or anti-OL
  effects, autophagy, cell signaling events, and diet. Abbreviations: PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; SOD, superoxide dismutase;
  mTORC1, mammalian target of Raptor complex I. Created with BioRender.com.'
