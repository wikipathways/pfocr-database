caption: The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (A) In the Wnt-off state, the β-catenin
  destruction complex is formed by Axin, APC, GSK3β, and CK1α and promotes the phosphorylation
  of β-catenin. The E3 ligase β-TrCP further induces β-catenin ubiquitination and
  proteasomal degradation. E-cadherin and β-catenin also form complex to enhance cell
  adhesion. (B) In the Wnt-on state, Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled receptor and LRP
  co-receptor and recruit and activate Dishevelled, which further inhibits the activity
  of GSK3β and releases β-catenin from the destruction complex. The stable β-catenin
  subsequently translocates into the nucleus, interacts with TCF/LEF, and promotes
  the transcription of its down-stream target genes. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli;
  β-TrCP, β-Transducin repeat-containing protein; CK1α, casein kinase 1α; GSK3β, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; TCF/LEF,
  T cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor.
