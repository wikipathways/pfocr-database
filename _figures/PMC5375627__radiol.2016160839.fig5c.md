caption: Induction of glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes by M-CSF and
  GM-CSF. Heat map representation of relative messenger ribonucleic acid expression
  (fold-change compared with MΦ0 ) of genes encoding (a) glycolytic and (b) tricarboxylic
  acid cycle enzymes. Transcripts that are significantly upregulated in MΦM-CSF are
  blue and those overexpressed in both MΦM-CSF and MΦGM-CSF are green. (c) Transcripts
  that are differentially overexpressed in MΦM-CSF and MΦGM-CSF are in blue and red,
  respectively, in a metabolic pathway model. * P = .06.
