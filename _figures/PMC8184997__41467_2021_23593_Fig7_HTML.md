caption: Salmonella internalization activates the ER-stress response (1), specifically
  the IRE1 branch, which activates the JNK MAPK pathway (2) leading to E2F1 downregulation
  (3) and a consequent decrease in expression of a significant number of miRNAs (4).
  Given that many of these miRNAs were shown to counteract infection, the net outcome
  of miRNA regulation is an increase of Salmonella intracellular replication (5).
  Infection of cells by Salmonella leads to increased secretion of proteins to the
  extracellular milieu (several of which are related to the ER-stress response), including
  HMGB1 (6). HMGB1 binds to the RAGE receptor at the surface of bystander cells (7),
  triggering an IRE1-mediated ER-stress response in bystander cells (8). This, in
  turn, activates the JNK pathway (9) resulting in a decrease of E2F1 expression in
  bystander cells (10). Echoing the effect in infected cells, E2F1 downregulation
  decreases the expression of numerous miRNAs (11), with a net effect of priming these
  cells for Salmonella infection, by favoring bacterial binding to bystander cells,
  as well as by promoting bacterial internalization and intracellular replication
  (12).
