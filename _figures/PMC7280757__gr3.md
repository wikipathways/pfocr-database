caption: Internalized membrane attack complexes (MACs) activate interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–primed
  human endothelial cells (ECs) by a MAC/endosomal NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK)/nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing three
  (NLRP3) inflammasome/IL-1 signaling pathways and increase their ability to recruit
  and activate alloreactive T cells. Antibody-mediated complement activation leads
  to MAC deposition on the surface of IFN-γ–primed human ECs. MAC is internalized
  by a clathrin-mediated endocytosis and delivered to Ras-related protein Rab5+ endosomes.
  The Rab5/zinc finger FYVE-type containing 21 (ZFYVE21)/SMAD–specific E3 ubiquitin
  protein ligase 2 (SMURF2)/phosphorylated Akt signaling pathway modifies the phosphoinositide
  composition of Rab5+MAC+ endosomes, which recruit and stabilize mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase 14 [alias NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK)], preventing
  its tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3–mediated polyubiquitinylation.
  Endosomal NIK activates noncanonical NF-κB signaling to synthesize pro–IL-1β and
  the assembly of an NLRP3 inflammasome that processes and secretes mature IL-1β and
  IL-18. IL-1β feeds back on the ECs to induce proinflammatory genes through a canonical
  NF-κB pathway that increases the capacity of the ECs to activate alloreactive CD4+
  T effect or memory cells. IL-18 selectively expands alloreactive peripheral helper
  T cells, an IL-21–producing T-cell subset. ASC, apoptosis-associated Speck-like
  protein containing CARD; CCL5, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5; CCL20, chemokine
  (C-C motif) ligand 20; GSDMD, gasdermin D; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule
  1; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1.
