caption: History of the discovery of azulfidine, an oral SARS-CoV-2 RdRp covalent
  inhibitor. (A) Important milestones in the discovery of azivudine from NM-107 to
  the first-in-class dual HIV and SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor. (B) Advances in medicinal
  chemistry led to the discovery of the oral RdRp inhibitor azivudine. (C) Proposed
  mechanism of action of the prodrug azivudine against SARS-CoV-2. (D) Metabolic pathway
  of azulfidine. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication process is blocked by the active metabolite,
  azulfidine triphosphate, through the formation of covalent bonds. Created with BioRender
