caption: Regulatory network of amino acid, phenolic acid, and flavonol derivative
  biosynthesis. (A) The regulatory correlation between the characteristic metabolites
  of the phenolic acid pathway and structural genes and transcription factors. (B)
  The regulatory correlation of the amino acid pathway. (C1) The regulatory correlation
  of the flavonoid pathway (naringenin chalcone and dihydroquercetin). (C2) The regulatory
  correlation of the flavonoid pathway (chlorogenic acid).
