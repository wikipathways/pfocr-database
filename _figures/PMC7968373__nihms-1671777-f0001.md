caption: Signaling is triggered by binding of extracellular ligand to a receptor tyrosine
  kinase (RTK). Activation of the RTK recruits Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor
  type 11 (SHP2) and Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), which subsequently
  recruits RAS guanine exchange factors such as Son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS) to
  the membrane. SOS promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP, activating RAS. RAS-GTP
  initiates the phosphorylation cascade involving Mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase kinases (RAF), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEK) and mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (ERK). Meanwhile, feedback loops modulate signaling. The E3 ubiquitin
  protein ligase CBL mediates degradation of the RTK. Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing
  protein 1 (SPRED1) recruits the GTPase activating protein Neurofibromin 1 (NF1)
  to the membrane, returning RAS to a GDP-bound inactive state. Leucine-zipper-like
  transcriptional regulator 1 (LZTR1) ubiquitinates RAS to prevent its membrane localization.
  A complex of Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), Leucine-rich repeat protein SHOC2, and
  MRAS GTPase dephosphorylates RAF, allowing 14-3-3 protein to switch from stabilizing
  the inactive form of RAF to facilitating active RAF dimer formation. Both activating
  mutations (green) in pathway components and inactivating mutations (purple) in negative
  regulators cause activation of the signaling pathway. Components that do not cause
  RASopathies are not shown unless no alternative protein is associated with disease
  (gray).
