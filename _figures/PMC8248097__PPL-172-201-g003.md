caption: The effect of stem girdling on the phenylpropanoid pathway during autumn.
  Genes coding the enzymes and transcription factors involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
  pathway were upregulated (colored in orange) in the leaves of girdled stem. See
  Table  for a summary of differential gene expression and Table  for statistical
  results of metabolite data. Metabolite data are arbitrary units, mean ± se, n =
  4. DOY, the day of the year
