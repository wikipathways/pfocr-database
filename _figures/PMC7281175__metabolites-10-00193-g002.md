caption: 'Schematic representation of the metabolic pathways in hepatocarcinogenesis.
  An exhaustive analysis of the integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic data identified
  multiple relevant metabolic pathways for further validation and investigation. (A)
  Metabolic pathways associated with glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), and lipid biosynthesis. (B) Metabolic pathways associated
  with cholesterol and bile acid synthesis. (C) Metabolic pathways associated with
  glutathione. The blue- and red-bordered boxes depict the expression-patterns of
  metabolomics and transcriptomics data, respectively. The green bordered boxes indicate
  the expression-patterns of metabolites that were detected directly. The relative
  expression levels of W (green histogram bar), P (orange histogram bar), and T (red
  histogram bar) are demonstrated in boxes; the different height of histogram bars
  indicate expression levels. The asterisk in the upper right corner of DEGs or DEMs
  indicates that these metabolites or enzymes were validated (detailed information
  is given in  and ). Grey word represents the undetected metabolites in the present
  study. TG: triglyceride; NADPH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; GSH:
  glutathione; ROS: reactive oxygen species. Other abbreviations are the same, as
  mentioned in .'
