caption: The hypothesis is that the AtRGS1 level affects the phosphorylation percentage
  in G protein signaling pathway and the level of activation of the G protein pathway.
  (A). The relationship between phosphorylated AtRGS1 and the ratio AtRGS1:WNK kinases.
  The natural variation in expression levels among transformed cells will be used
  to test this hypothesis. (B). Network of G protein signaling pathway. This model
  is taken from Fu, et al 2014. The added red box marks the process affected by our
  hypothesis.
