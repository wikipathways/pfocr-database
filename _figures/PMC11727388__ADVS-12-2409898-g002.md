caption: The aberrant tumorigenic ECM modulates several intracellular signaling pathways
  involved in tumor development and progression. A) The cell membrane is the main
  hub that conveys changes occurring at the ECM level into the cell; receptors on
  the cell membrane such as integrins, hyaluronan receptor (CD44), G protein‐coupled
  receptor (e.g., Frizzled receptor), and TGF‐β receptor play a major role in the
  mechanosignaling cascade. B) Importantly, the ECM directly interacts with these
  receptors and promotes the retention of secreted soluble factors (e.g., Wnt and
  TGF‐βB) at the TME, which can consequently be activated during disease development
  and fuel tumor progression by initiating a signaling cascade that can inhibit growth
  suppressors and pro‐apoptotic proteins (e.g., via FAK‐Src signaling), promote cell
  proliferation and differentiation (e.g., via Wnt/β‐catenin pathway), and enhance
  migration and invasiveness through EMT (e.g., via TGF‐β pathway).[ 1 ] C) ECM stiffness
  also regulates the activity of Piezo1 ion channel, leading to the influx of Ca2+
  ions and subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways that modulate cell
  behavior. Mechanical cues also control the activity of angiomotin (AMOT) proteins
  and neurofibromin 2 (NF2, also known as Moesin‐Ezrin‐Radixin‐Like (MERLIN) tumor
  suppressor), which are negative regulators of yes‐associated protein (YAP). Following
  increased ECM stiffness, the assembly of actin results in the sequestration of AMOT,
  which prevents its interaction with NF2. This leads to the inhibition of the Hippo
  signaling pathway, resulting in the shuttling of YAP to the nucleus, where it promotes
  the transcription of genes encoding proteins that participate in focal adhesion
  assembly,[ 44 ] immune evasion,[ 45 ] resistance to therapy,[ 46 ] and ECM remodeling
