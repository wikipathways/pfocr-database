caption: MAOs as sources of DAMPs through the generation of toxic byproducts ? Monoamine
  oxidases (MAOs) A and B are located in the mitochondrial outer membrane. MAOs metabolize
  monoamines in an oxidative deamination reaction, resulting in the generation of
  aldehydes, ammonia and H2O2 as degradation by-products. H2O2 a reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), can enter the mitochondria and cause cardiolipin peroxidation, which is a
  putative DAMP. Cardiolipin peroxidation can generate 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which
  in turn inhibits the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), allowing further
  accumulation of aldehydes in the mitochondria and alteration of the electron transport
  chain. Inhibition of ALDH2 also results in mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) overload.
  ROS generated by MAOs can also lead to the oxidation/deletion of mitochondrial DNA
  (mtDNA). MtDNA can escape the mitochondria and activate cellular inflammation signalling
  pathways. MAO-dependent ROS can also cause downregulation of nuclear peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α). This will ultimately
  lead to impaired mitochondrial quality control, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy.
  Catecholamines and serotonin can also be degraded and regulate the activity of immune
  cells

  description: MAOs as sources of DAMPs through the generation of toxic byproducts
    ? Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) A and B are located in the mitochondrial outer membrane.
