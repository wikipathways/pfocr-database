caption: The various interactions between RABV proteins and interferon signaling pathway.
  The IFN-signaling pathway is activated by RABV infection, whereas RABV utilizes
  its own proteins to suppress the IFN signaling pathway by interacting with key factors
  in IFN pathways. RABV P interacts directly with tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT (pY-STAT)
  to inhibit the expression of ISGs (interferon-stimulated genes) by affecting its
  localization and reducing its ability to bind to ISG promoters. P protein is also
  able to interact directly with TBK-1 (TANK-binding kinase-1) in a dose-dependent
  manner, inhibiting phosphorylation of the IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3).
  Moreover, the interaction between P and PML (promyelocytic leukemia) alters PML
  protein localization and the structure of PML-NBs (nuclear bodies), thereby regulating
  IFN-induced apoptosis. The encapsulation of RABV RNA by N protein protects viral
  RNA from getting recognized by RIG-I (retinoic acid–inducible gene I), which subsequently
  prevents RIG-I-mediated activation of the downstream IRF-3 pathway. Type-I IFN stimulation
  causes the M to shift toward activated pSTAT1 interaction, which improves the ability
  of P protein to engage with JAK1 to prevent pSTAT1 from activating and with pSTAT1
  to restrain it in the cytoplasm [43]
