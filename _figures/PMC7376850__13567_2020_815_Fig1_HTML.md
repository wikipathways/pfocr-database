  Schematic representation of Brucella (A) LPS biosynthesis steps that occur at both
  sides of the inner membrane (IM), B LPS core, and C central carbon metabolism. The
  proteins corresponding to the mutants investigated are indicated with arrows. WbkF,
  bactoprenol (BctPP, Bactoprenol-P-P) primase for O-chain polymerization; Wzm/Wzt,
  O-chain translocation ABC transport system; WadA, core glycosyltransferase that
  incorporates the terminal glucose (Glc) linking the core to the two O-chain mannoses
  (Man) of the proximal section of the N-formyl-perosamine (NF-per) polysaccharide;
  Pgm, phosphoglucomutase necessary for the synthesis of the UPD-glucose used by WadA;
  WadB, WadC and WadD, glycosyltransferases involved in the incorporation of glucosamine
  (GlcN) and Man to the core-lateral branch; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid;
  Quin, quinovosamine. WboA, WboB, WbkA and WbkE, O-chain glycosyltransferases. F1,6bP,
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
