caption: Summary of candidate theragnostic biomarkers that reflect key drug targets
  in the Alzheimer disease (AD) process. Beta-secretase inhibitors should reduce cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid beta (Aβ) isoforms starting at the first amino acid
  in the Aβ sequence (Aβ1-X). Gamma-secretase inhibitors should reduce Aβ1-40 and
  Aβ1-42 and increase Aβ1-14, Aβ1-15, and Aβ1-16. Both Aβ immunotherapy and anti-aggregation
  agents might be monitored by CSF levels of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42. Therapy-induced Aβ
  degradation might be monitored by CSF levels of different Aβ peptides, depending
  on the proteolytic pathway used for degradation. Aβ efflux from the brain to the
  blood might be monitored by measurement of Aβ in CSF and plasma. Inflammatory markers
  in plasma and CSF as well as CSF levels of CCL2 and chitotriosidase activity are
  putative markers of microglial activity and may change in response to treatments
  that influence microglial activity. Treatment with tau hyperphosphorylation inhibitors
  might be monitored with CSF phospho-tau (P-tau) levels. Downstream effects on axonal
  degeneration from disease-modifying treatments could be monitored by using the axonal
  damage markers CSF total tau (T-tau) and neurofilament light protein (NFL).
