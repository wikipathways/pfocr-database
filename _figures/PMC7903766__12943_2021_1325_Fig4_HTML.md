caption: DDX3X and apoptosis. In the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, DDX3X binds with
  GSK3 and cIAP-1, forming an anti-apoptotic complex to cap major death receptors.
  After death ligands bind to their receptors, the anti-apoptotic complex is destroyed
  by inactivation of GSK3β and cleavage of DDX3X and cIAP-1 by caspases. Cleavage
  occurred in the N-terminus of DDX3X, and the truncated protein can still bind GSK3-β.
  In the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, DDX3X binds wild-type P53 and mutant P53 in
  tumours. When encountering DNA damage, DDX3X binds wild-type P53 and stabilizes
  its protein level, promoting P53/P21 axis-mediated apoptosis. However, DDX3X and
  mutant P53 are separated after DNA damage occurs, which impedes Caspase activation
  in P53-mutant tumours. This disassociation may contribute to the translocation of
  DDX3X to death receptors. However, in HeLa cells, phosphorylated DDX3X reverses
  sanguinarine (SA)-induced intrinsic apoptosis by strongly repressing P21 expression
