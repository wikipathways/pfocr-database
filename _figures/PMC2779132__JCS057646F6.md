caption: Schematics of the proposed participation of Pi4ka and PI3Ks in the FGF  signaling
  cascade in the developing fin bud mesenchyme. Pi4ka contributes to  the generation
  of the PtdIns(4,5)P2 pool that is converted  by the PI3Ks to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in
  the plasma membrane.  Production of this latter lipid activates the Akt signaling
  cascade that  regulates a host of downstream genes important for proliferation or
  protection  of the cells from apoptosis. One of the most important genes regulated
  by this  pathway is the MAPK phosphatase, MKP3 that is a key intermediate in driving  pectoral
  fin development (). This phosphatase keeps a right balance between MAPK and the  Akt
  pathways. The right panel shows the FGF signaling cascade in which the  Fgf24-positive
  cell migration appears to be the first step showing impairment  after Pi4ka depletion.
