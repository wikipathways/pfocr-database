caption: 'Schematic diagram of the neuroprotective effects of blueberry anthocyanins
  extract (BAE) against acrylamide (AA) exposure in rat hippocampus and cortex. BAE
  supplementation attenuated AA-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, while
  improving the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/cAMP response elements binding
  protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway and relieving the
  accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ), which eventually contributed to the neuroprotection
  against AA toxicity. IL-1β: interleukin-1β; IL-6: interleukin-6; TNF-α: tumor necrosis
  factor-alpha; P: phosphorylation.'
