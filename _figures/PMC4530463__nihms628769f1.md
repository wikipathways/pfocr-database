caption: The IL-17 receptor complex (IL-17RA/IL-17RC) is ubiquitously expressed and
  its ligands include IL-17A and IL-17F homodimers, as well as IL-17A/F heterodimers.
  Ligand-induced IL-17 receptor signaling initiates the recruitment of the essential
  adaptor molecule Act1, which in turn recruits tumor necrosis factor-R-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6), a critical upstream activator of the NF-κB pathway. Specifically,
  TRAF6 recruits the kinase TAK1 and its binding partners TAB2 and TAB3 leading to
  activation of the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK) complex and thereby to induction
  of NF-κB translocation. It is uncertain whether TRAF6 is also required for the activation
  of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that link IL-17 receptor signaling
  to activation of the transcription factor activator protein-1. Interleukin-17 receptor
  activation also induces the recruitment of the IKK-related kinase IKKi to the IL-17
  receptor–Act1 complex. IKKi phosphorylates Act1 generating a docking site for recruitment
  of TRAF2 and TRAF5. The resulting Act1-TRAF2-TRAF6 complex sequesters splicing factor
  SF2 resulting in mRNA stabilization of target genes (e.g., chemokines). Another
  important transcription factor activated downstream of Act1 is CCAAT/enhancer-binding
  protein (C/EBP). The activation of NF-κB, transcription factor activator protein-1,
  and C/EBP (C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ) leads to the induction of genes encoding for inflammatory
  mediators and neutrophil-specific CXC chemokines (e.g., CXCL8), antimicrobial peptides,
  and the osteoclastogenic factor RANKL. Tumor necrosis factor signaling can synergize
  with IL-17 signaling through C/EBP to amplify inflammatory mediators such as IL-6
  and CXCL8. Drawn on the basis of information from several sources (, , , ).
