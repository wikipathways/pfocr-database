caption: XIAP's protein domains and their individual specific protein interactions
  and functions. Well-known is that XIAP's BIR2 and 3 domains directly inhibit caspase-3,
  −7 and −9 (, –). BIR1 has been isolated as the BCL10-binding region within XIAP.
  This interaction plays a role in the Dectin-1 signalling pathway (). Furthermore,
  BIR1 recruits the TAB1/TAK1 complex, which is essential for activation of the NF-κB
  and MAPK pathways (–). BIR2 interacts with RIPK2, which forms a necessary step in
  the NOD1/2 signalling pathways leading to NF-κB and MAPK activation (, , ). The
  UBA domain is able to directly bind polyubiquitin chains and is required for activation
  of NF-κB, likely via its binding to polyubiquitinated NEMO (). The C-terminal RING
  finger domain of XIAP has E3 ubiquitin ligase function, enabling XIAP to target
  proteins for proteasomal degradation or alter protein function (). For example,
  the ubiquitin ligase activity of XIAP is critical for NOD2 mediated activation of
  NF-κB, via the polyubiquitination of RIKP2 (). Created with BioRender.com.
