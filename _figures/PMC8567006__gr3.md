caption: Biosynthetic pathways of Vitis vinifera in producing major bioactives as
  a result of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Resveratrol is produced directly from
  the substrate 4-Coumaryl-CoA by stilbene synthase enzyme. The pathway metabolites
  such as flavonols, isoflavonoids, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins are produced
  by the substrate 4-Coumaryl-CoA after several enzymatic reactions (; https://pmn.plantcyc.org).
