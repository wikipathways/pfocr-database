caption: Summary of the mitophagy signaling pathway. When the cell is stimulated,
  the mitochondria will be damaged. Then the mitochondrial transmembrane potential
  (ΔΨm) drops, and mitophagy will be activated. PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, phosphorylates Parkin and recruits Parkin from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria.
  Activated Parkin can ubiquitinate the voltage-dependent anion channels 1 (VDAC1)
  of damaged mitochondria, Then, Parkin is recognized and bound by the signal adaptor
  protein p62/SQSTM1. P62 could recruit ubiquitinated substances into autophagosomes
  by binding to microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3). Bnip3, Nix and
  phosphorylated FUNDC1 can also connect to LC3 to promote mitophagy. Subsequent mitophagosomes
  are formed, which bind to lysosomes, and finally lyse damaged mitochondria.
