caption: 'Estrogen and estrogen receptor-mediated pathways in thyroid cancer. (a)
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: activation of PI3K promotes cell proliferation and differentiation.
  PTEN gene can prevent PI3K phosphorylation and promote apoptosis, while activation
  of Bcl-2 gene promotes cell proliferation; AKT can promote NF-κB nuclear translocation,
  activate target genes, and promote cell survival. (b) Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway: E2 can make mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
  kinase isoenzymes and ERK 1/2 strongly phosphorylated, and then promote the expression
  changes of apoptosis-related factors, such as Bcl-2, Bax, and cyclinD1, increasing
  the ability of cell proliferation and survival. ERα can interact directly with IQGAP1
  to phosphorylate ERK1/2 thereby promoting cell proliferation. (c) Reactive oxygen
  species (ROS)-related pathways: E2 can stimulate ROS production by acting on NOX4
  that may be located in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear membrane,
  and mitochondria, and then ROS induces the overexpression of HIF-1α. (d) E2 increases
  cyclin D1 protein expression and reduces the expression of p27 and β-catenin by
  ERα. Overexpression of ERα or ERβ decreased the activity of PPARγ protein, thereby
  significantly promoting the proliferation and migration of thyroid cancer cells.
  TRIM16 has “anti-estrogen” activity, and its anti-estrogen action is mainly concentrated
  in ERβ.'
