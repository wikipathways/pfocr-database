caption: Pin1-mediated APP processing. Pin1 binds to the pT668-P motif of APP, accelerates
  its isomerization from cis to trans, stabilizes APP at the plasma membrane, and
  ultimately promotes the non-amyloidogenic processing pathway. Moreover, conformational
  changes in APP may affect the binding of Fe65, thus preventing the amyloidogenic
  processing pathway. Furthermore, Pin1 promotes APP protein turnover by decreasing
  GSK3β activity. Under physiological conditions, sufficient levels of Pin1 protect
  healthy neurons against Aβ pathology. When Pin1 expression/activity is inhibited,
  the amyloidogenic processing pathway is dominant, resulting in Aβ production and
  plaques.
