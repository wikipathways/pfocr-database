caption: Comparative representation of stress response pathway in three domains of
  life. In eukaryotes, sHsps bind to the unfolded proteins and prevent aggregation.
  The unfolded proteins can then be transferred to the Hsp70 pr Hsp100 system. They
  can refold a protein back to their native conformations. Additionally, Hsp90 can
  break the deadlock created by Hsp70 and can perform the refolding process. CCT (Hsp60)
  can also refold a protein back to its native conformation. In bacteria, the sHsps
  protect against aggregation by binding to unfolded proteins when subjected to stress.
  Hsp70 displaces the sHsps and takes over the refolding process. Additionally, Hsp100
  (disaggregases) comes into the scenario and gets the final refolding complete. Similarly,
  in archaea, sHsps are the first line of defense. They protect the cell against stress-induced
  aggregation by binding to unfolded proteins. The unfolded protein substrates are
  then transferred by sHsps to Hsp60 (thermosome), which performs the final refolding.
