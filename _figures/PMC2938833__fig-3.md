caption: Pfn gene neighborhood and its interacting pathway. A neighborhood is a network
  consisting of the relationships between a molecule and its nearest neighbors based
  on the connections available in the Ingenuity knowledge base. It displays the molecule
  of interest at the center, with its interacting partners and the biological relationships
  between them. Essentially, the molecules that are displayed in the neighborhood
  regulate, are regulated by, or physically interact with the molecule of interest.
