caption: 'Upon agonist binding: (1) OTR signals via G proteins—the classic signalling
  route for Gαq/11 is activation of phospholipase C (PLC) thereby triggering phosphoinositide
  hydrolysis, calcium mobilisation and protein kinase A (PKA) activation. Gαs activates
  adenylate cyclase (AC), which in turn increases cAMP production, leading to the
  activation of cAMP-dependent PKA. The OTR/Gαspathway (dashed lines) is not fully
  confirmed yet and requires further study. The classical signalling pathway for Gαi
  is inhibition of AC which leads to a decreased cAMP production and decreased PKA
  activity. (2) In addition, OTR can be phosphorylated at the C-terminus or at intracellular
  loops by GPCR kinases (GRK). (3) Once phosphorylated, OTR loses its affinity for
  the G proteins and gains affinity for β-arrestins. β-arrestins bound to OTR prevent
  further coupling of G proteins, a process known as desensitisation. (4) β-arrestins,
  through their interaction with clathrin and adaptor protein 2 (AP-2), target phosphorylated
  OTRs for endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits by scaffolding proteins of the internalisation
  machinery. (5) OTR can also activate β-arrestin-dependent signalling pathways. (6)
  Internalised OTRs move into early endosomes, of which some are sorted into recycling
  endosomes, where the ligand is metabolised and the receptors are dephosphorylated
  and recycled back to the cell surface (7), while others are sorted to late endosomes/lysosomes
  for degradation (8).'
