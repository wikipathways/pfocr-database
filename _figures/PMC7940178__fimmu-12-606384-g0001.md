caption: HCA2 triggers different downstream signaling pathway in different cell types.
  (A) In adipocytes, activation of HCA2 triggers a Gαi-mediated inhibition of adenylate
  cyclase activity, which leads to lower intracellular cAMP levels, reduced protein
  kinase A (PKA) activity, and further reduces the activity of hormone sensitive lipase
  (HSL), an important lipolytic enzyme. This inhibition of lipolysis results in a
  decreased release of free fatty acids into the circulation. (B) In hepatocytes,
  activation of HCA2 mediates the protein kinase C (PKC)-extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, leading to phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). This results in an
  inhibition of hepatic de novo lipogenesis and a remarkable decrease of lipid accumulation
  in liver. (C) In colonocytes, ligand binding to HCA2 suppresses NF-κB activation
  and activates NLRP3 inflammasome, which recruits caspase-1 and promotes the maturation
  of IL-18 for secretion. (D) In retinal pigment epithelium, HCA2 exerts either an
  anti-inflammatory response through the Gαi/cAMP/NF-κB pathway, or apoptosis through
  the Gβγ/Ca2+/NOX4/ROS/JNK pathway. (E) Within Langerhans cells, HCA2-mediated Gαi
  activation primarily results in the Gβγ-complex released from activated Gαi, thereby
  increasing intracellular calcium concentration by mobilizing Ca2+ release from the
  endoplasmic reticulum and ultimately driving the formation of PGD2 and PGE2, which
  are released to the dermal layer and cause cutaneous flushing reaction. (F) In macrophages,
  activation of HCA2 involves inhibition of NF-κB, thereby exerting an anti-inflammatory
  effec. HCA2 activation in macrophages also represses F-actin and blocks Gβγ signaling
  to inhibit chemokine-induced migration of macrophages. HCA2 also shows anti-inflammatory
  effects in Parkinson's disease models by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the NF-κB
  p65 signaling pathway in microglia. HCA2 suppresses LPS-induced NF-κB activation
  in human monocytes, resulting in decreased transcription of IL-6, TNFα, and MCP-1.
  In DCs, HCA2 activation decreases IL-6 level and increases IL-10 level, also upregulates
  expression of RALDH1, which synthesizes RA from retinol. RA and IL-10 promote Treg
  cell proliferation. In neutrophils, niacin-mediated HCA2 activation inhibits PKA
  activity and subsequently increase BAD levels, which drives apoptosis of neutrophils.
