caption: Insulin/IGF-1 signalling map. Non-phosphorylated proteins, non-regulated
  phosphoproteins, and regulated phosphoproteins are mapped to the pathway. The complete
  list of the proteins involved in insulin/IGF-1 pathway can be found in . Proteins
  known to be involved in insulin/IGF-1 pathway are represented in blue color; IRS-1
  and IRS-2 are shown in beige color. Identified phosphosites by MS are shown in light
  orange, previously reported sites; light green, novel sites. The IGF-1 induced upregulated
  sites are shown with the surrounding red dash lines and the downregulated sites
  are marked with dark green dashed-circles. The inhibitory and positive relationship
  between different nodes of the signalling network is shown by orange and solid black
  arrows, respectively. The dashed lines point the same proteins located at different
  cell compartments, and dashed arrows indicate the final functional outputs of the
  pathway.
