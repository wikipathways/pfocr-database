caption: Schematic diagram of HPV16 endocytosis and trafficking to multivesicular
  bodies. After priming and activation of signaling cascades, the HPV16 capsid interacts
  with the entry receptor complex composed of growth factor receptors, laminin-binding
  integrins, tetraspanins and annexins. Upon HPV binding to this complex, a non-canonical
  and clathrin independent endocytic process is initiated, which involves actin, the
  cytoskeletal adaptor protein OBSL1, the annexin A2 heterotetramer and tetraspanin
  CD151. Internalized viruses are then routed to acidified multivesicular bodies.
  This early trafficking again involves annexins, and a complex of tetraspanin CD63,
  syntenin-1 and ESCRT components. Therefore, tetraspanins and annexins might organize
  the spatial accumulation of HPV16-associated molecules and recruitment of cytoplasmic
  trafficking factors until capsid disassembly and L2 membrane insertion/penetration
  ensures virus interaction with cytoplasmic partner proteins and subsequent trafficking
  towards and into the nucleus.
