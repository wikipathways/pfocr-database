caption: ProMeTra visualization of relative metabolite pools and transcript abundances
  during fermentation of the l-lysine producer C. glutamicum DM1730. ProMeTra visualization
  of relative metabolite pools and transcript abundances during fermentation of the
  L-lysine producer C. glutamicum DM1730. The metabolite pool ratios are shown in
  ellipses and the transcript ratios are shown in rectangles as logarithm (base 2)
  of the mean values (M-values) of time points t2 – t6 in comparison to t1. The values
  are shown in a color code form green to red with ± 5 as highest values. The pathway
  map shows glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle and the
  lysine pathway for C. glutamicum and a zoomed L-lysine pathway. The pools of the
  metabolites shown in grey were not determined.
