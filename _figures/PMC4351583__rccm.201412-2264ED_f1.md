caption: The sphingolipid metabolic pathway associated with emphysema (left) and COPD
  exacerbation (right). Circles and rectangles represent the metabolites and enzymes,
  respectively. Red and green colors indicate positive and negative associations,
  respectively. Concentration of Cer, SM, and gangliosides are strongly and inversely
  associated with emphysema phenotype and glycolipids (trihexosylceramides, dihexosylceramides,
  ganglioside). Sulfatides are positively and S1P and SM are negatively associated
  with severe COPD exacerbation phenotype. 3-Keto = 3-ketosphinganine; Cer = ceramide;
  Cer-1P = ceramide-1 phosphate; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DHCer = dihyroceramide;
  EP = ethanolamine phosphate; GSL = glycosphingolipid; SM = sphingomyeline; SMase = sphingomyelinase;
  SMS = sphingomyelin synthase; SP = sphingosine; S1P = sphingosine-1-phosphate; Sph = sphinganine.
