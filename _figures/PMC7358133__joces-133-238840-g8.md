caption: EGFR promotes and organizes integrin mechanics. Model highlighting the role
  of EGFR signaling in cell spreading, FA organization and maturation, and integrin
  tension. (A) In the absence of EGF, integrin engagement of RGD results in low direct
  activation of the integrin signaling pathway. This results in formation of a limited
  number of immature FAs (magenta) with unorganized cytoskeleton (cyan), leading to
  relatively small cell spread areas and limited changes in cell morphology. (B) The
  lowered signaling from direct integrin activation can be rescued in the presence
  of EGF stimulation. Activated EGFR acts as a mechano-organizer, facilitating integrin
  tension (yellow), cytoskeletal rearrangement (cyan) and FA maturation (magenta).
  This results in cells with organized FAs and cytoskeleton, which enhances cell spreading.
  (C) The tension threshold of the underlying substrate plays an important role in
  integrin activation and regulation of FA formation and cell spreading (no EGF).
  However, this effect can be circumvented by activating the ligand-dependent EGFR
  signaling pathway, which in turn influences the cell mechanics (EGF). The blue trendline
  illustrates how the mechanical landscape responds to changes in EGF stimulation
  and tension threshold. EGF stimulation on both the 12 pN and 56 pN TGT surfaces
  results in collaborative amplification of the signaling pathways influencing cell
  mechanics. EGFR and integrin work together in a concerted manner, whereby activated
  EGFR attenuates (tunes) the integrin tension threshold for FA assembly, thus enhancing
  FA protein recruitment to sites of contact formation and resulting in formation
  of organized FAs on softer substrates. This ‘mechano-organizing’ property of EGFR
  regulates FA and cytoskeleton organization, resulting in increased cell spread area,
  irrespective of the TGT tension threshold.
