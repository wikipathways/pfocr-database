caption: The PCP and Wnt pathways act in parallel to establish coordinated hair cell
  polarity and orientation in the neuromast. Model of how the PCP signaling genes
  Vangl2 and Scrib are required to establish individual polarity in the hair cells
  (left part of the box), while the Wnt pathway members Wnt11 (Wnt11f1), Gpc4 and
  Fzd7a/7b interact to establish coordinated support cell alignment (right part of
  the box) in primII-derived neuromasts. The coordinated alignment of support cells,
  which we assume have normal polarity because coordinated alignment is not disrupted
  in PCP signaling mutants, then dictates the individual hair cell orientation

  hair cell orientation.
