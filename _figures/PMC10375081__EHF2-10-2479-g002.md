caption: Pathways of glycogen storage in Danon disease. Glucose entry into cells and
  subsequent conversion into glucose‐6‐phosphate (G‐6‐P) facilitated by hexokinase,
  after which it is targeted for glycolysis or glycogen synthesis by glycogen synthase.
  Glycogen is stored in the cytoplasm as liver glycogen and muscle glycogen and degraded
  through the cytoplasmic pathway and lysosomal pathway.
