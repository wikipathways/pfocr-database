caption: 'CE-TOFMS analysis of intracellular metabolites related to nucleotide and
  to Gly/Ser/Cys metabolic pathway after 24 h of exposure to acidosis: Bar graphs
  show the relative intracellular amount of metabolites. The bars correspond to the
  mean values of the three OS cell lines under neutral and acidic conditions (blue
  and red, respectively), and to the mean of the two normal Fb cultures under neutral
  and acidic conditions (green and orange, respectively), mean ± SD. Metabolic pathway
  maps were first written by VANTED software at HMT, and the copyright has been provided
  to the authors. A. Purine and pyrimidine metabolic pathways; B. Gly/Ser/Cys and
  porphyrin metabolic pathways.'
