caption: cAMP can regulate multidrug-resistance in lung cancer through the regulation
  of plenty of downstream effectors, which is participating in the cAMP signaling
  pathway such as the classical PKA and CREB or some other useful effectors. Through
  the regulation of these downstream effectors, cAMP can modulate cell apoptosis,
  cell survival, cell growth, cell cycle and cell proliferation which will have an
  effect on multidrug-resistance in lung cancer treatment.
