caption: The figure depicts the concept that pancreatic stellate cells and cancer
  cells (including PanINs) secrete factors that are carried by exosomes to (i) activate
  PSCs in and around islets causing islet cell dysfunction and (ii) impair the insulin
  signalling pathway in hepatocytes, adipocytes and skeletal myocytes leading to insulin
  resistance. These effects cause hyperglycaemia/diabetes in the early asymptomatic
  stage of PDAC. Hyperglycaemia can lead to further PSC activation, which in turn
  drives accelerated PDAC progression.
