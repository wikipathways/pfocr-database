caption: In mitochondria, 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate (HOG) is converted into glyoxylate
  and pyruvate by 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase (HOGA1). Glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate
  reductase (GRHPR) converts glyoxylate into glycolate. In peroxisomes, glycolate
  from mitochondrial catabolism and vegetable and fruit is oxidized into glyoxylate
  by glycolate oxidase (GO), whereas glyoxylate and l-alanine are transaminated by
  alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent
  enzyme, to form pyruvate and glycine, respectively. In the cytosol, glyoxylate can
  be converted into oxalate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Deficiency in AGT or GRHPR
  leads to the accumulation of glyoxylate in the cytosol and its increased conversion
  into oxalate by LDH. Different components of the oxalate pathway are mutated in
  primary hyperoxaluria (text highlighted in red). PH1, primary hyperoxaluria type
  1; PH2, primary hyperoxaluria type 2; PH3, primary hyperoxaluria type 3.
