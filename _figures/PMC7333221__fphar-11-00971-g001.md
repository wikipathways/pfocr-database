caption: Origin of B-cell-associated malignant tumors and the anti-tumor mechanisms
  of HDAC6 inhibitors. (A) B lymphocytes originate from HSCs in bone marrow. CLPs
  undergo Pro-B cells, Pre-B cells, immature B cells stages and then transfer to the
  secondary lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes) via blood vessel. Naive B cells continue
  to develop into plasma cells or memory B cells after antigen stimulation. Abnormalities
  in different stages of B cell development can lead to different malignant events.
  MCL, mantle cell lymphoma; BL, Burkitt lymphoma; GCB DLBCL, germinal center B cell-like
  diffuse large B cell lymphoma; ABC DLBCL, activated B cell–like diffuse large B
  cell lymphoma; FL, follicular lymphoma; MM, multiple myeloma. (B) HDAC6 can promote
  c-Myc expression by upregulating FOXO1 or β-catenin. At the same time c-Myc can
  promote HDAC6 expression, thereby promoting the survival of tumor cells. The simultaneous
  target of c-Myc and HDAC6 can effectively induce apoptosis of tumor cells. (C) HDAC6
  is involved in the aggresomal pathway of protein degradation. HDAC6 inhibitors cause
  ER stress by inhibiting this pathway. In addition, HDAC6 can induce UPR by directly
  targeting GRP78, and ultimately induce apoptosis. (D) MM cells achieve immune escape
  through the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. HDAC6 inhibitors can inhibit the expression of PD-L1
  and PD-1, thereby promoting tumor cell death. (E) Tumor cells can survive by upregulating
  cell survival signaling pathways such as NF-κB, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways. HDAC6
  inhibitors can promote apoptosis by inhibiting these signaling pathways.
