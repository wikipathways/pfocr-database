caption: Model for Akt1's regulatory role at the NMJ. Akt1 selectively affects A-type
  glutamate receptor abundance at the NMJ. Compromising Akt1 function reduced the
  levels of Dorsal and Cactus at the NMJ, two potential Akt1 targets that regulate
  GluRIIA levels. Loss of Akt1 also results in GluRIIA mislocalization to intracellular
  membrane compartments, suggesting that other Akt1 targets are involved as well.
  Akt1-dependent subsynaptic membrane expansion is mediated through a separate pathway
  where the Drosophila t-SNARE protein Gtaxin acts downstream of Akt1 function.
