caption: 'De novo synthesis of acyl donors via central carbon metabolism in Streptococcus.
  Activated acyl donors, the substrates for the luxABCDE machinery, are made by the
  breakdown of fatty acids through β-oxidation (denoted as green region) or by the
  synthesis of an activated carrier protein (ACP)-containing metabolites via fatty
  acid biosynthesis (denoted as salmon region). Since S. pyogenes lacks the β-oxidation
  pathway, all substrates for light production in Strep. Xen20 are created by acetyl-coenzyme
  A (CoA)-dependent fatty acid biosynthesis generated by homolactic fermentation (denoted
  as blue box). The asterisk indicates the sole carbon sources tested. Allosteric
  activators, such as inorganic phosphate (Pi), fructose bisphosphate (FBP), and glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P) are shown in green text, and allosteric inhibitors, including adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +), and triose phosphate (triose-P),
  are shown in red text. Abbreviations used in here is as follows: histidine-containing
  carrier protein (HPr), phosphorylated HPr [HPr(Ser-P)], phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP),
  and 1,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid (BPG).'
