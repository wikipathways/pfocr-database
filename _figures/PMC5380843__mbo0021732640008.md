caption: 'Proposed model for activation of IFN by doxorubicin bypassing IFN antagonism
  by Ebola virus VP35 protein. Ebola virus VP35 antagonizes IFN responses triggered
  by RIG-I-like receptors (RLR), which include RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5). RLR detect cytoplasmic double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) or RNAs with
  5′ triphosphate (5′ pppdsRNA), products of RNA virus replication. The activation
  of RLR is further facilitated by protein kinase R activator (PACT). Upon activation,
  RLR signal through the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to activate
  kinases IκB kinase ε (IKKε) and TBK1. These kinases phosphorylate IFN regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF-3) or IRF-7, which then accumulates in the nucleus and promotes expression
  of type I IFNs. Doxorubicin treatment results in IFN induction by two independent
  pathways: the DNA damage repair response pathway involving ATM and DNA sensor machinery
  cGAS-STING. The DNA damage leads to activation of ATM that triggers activation of
  an IRF-3 and/or NF-κB response, thus leading to IFN activation. Furthermore, damaged
  DNA can also be detected by a cytoplasmic DNA sensor, cGAS, which through the STING–TBK1–IRF-3
  axis leads to activation of IFN responses. Interestingly, these DNA-mediated IFN
  activation pathways are not subverted by the presence of Ebola virus VP35 protein.
  Thus, these data suggest novel avenues for developing antiviral therapeutics.'
