caption: Furin action in pituitary gonadotrope cells. Activin and furin  participate
  in a positive feedback loop. Activin stimulation of pituitary  gonadotrope cells
  stimulates the production of both activin B and inhibin B  dimers. A differential
  induction of activin B (bold arrows) over  inhibin B (thin arrow) is observed with
  activin A treatment. Only  activin can stimulate the endogenous expression of furin
  mRNA through a  Smad-dependent pathway. The increased levels of furin lead to an
  increase in  both inhibin α- and βB-subunit protein maturation and  secretion.
