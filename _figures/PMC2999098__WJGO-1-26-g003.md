caption: CKI members in canonical Wnt signaling. In the absence of Wnt ligand, β-catenin
  is phosphorylated by GSK3β after priming at S45 by CKIα and becomes degraded. In
  this state, CKIepsilon phosphorylates APC and stabilizes the β-catenin degradation
  complex. Upon Wnt ligand binding to its receptor, CKIepsilon is fully activated
  through dephosphorylation and contributes to the disassembly of the β-catenin degradation
  complex by phosphorylating Dishevelled (Dvl) and facilitating its interaction with
  Axin and GSK3β. Therefore, even though CKIα still primes β-catenin at S45, without
  additional phosphorylation by GSK3β, β-catenin becomes stabilized and accumulates
  in the cytoplasm. CKIepsilon also promotes β-catenin stability by phosphorylating
  Tcf3 which competes against GSK3β for β-catenin. Stabilized β-catenin then translocates
  into the nucleus, where it contributes to activation of Wnt target genes. CKIepsilon
  also negatively regulates the Wnt pathway by phosphorylating the LRP-co-receptor,
  which is positively phosphorylated by CKIγ. Since epistasis analysis showed that
  CKIepsilon-mediated phosphorylation of LRP was downstream of its phosphorylation
  of Dvl, this is most likely a negative feedback loop to quickly deactivate the pathway
  after propagation of the signal.
