caption: Incorporation of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A (THCA-A), ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol
  (THC), and its metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH) into human hair can occur
  in the hair bulb via the bloodstream, by diffusion from sweat or sebum into the
  hair shaft, or by external contamination (e.g. contaminated fingers or side-stream
  smoke). The main metabolic pathway of THC and the molecular structures of the respective
  analytes are also given.
