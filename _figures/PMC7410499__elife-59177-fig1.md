caption: When ACE is downregulated and ACE2 and the BK pathway is upregulated in the
  lungs of COVID-19 patients it leads to the hypotension, vascular permeability, and
  the Bradykinin Storm that explains much of COVID-19 symptomatology. As can be seen
  broadly across the figure, the resulting dysfunction caused by this imbalance will
  likely have a significant impact on the immune response by increasing processes
  on the right and decreasing those on the left. Genes are hexagons, highlighted colored
  genes of the AGTR1 cluster are associated with vasoconstriction and their connections
  to other enriched features are via pink edges; green highlighted genes in the AGTR2
  cluster are those associated with fluid balance and vasodilation and their connections
  to enriched features are shown as light green edges. Figure is made from two gene
  cluster input to http://toppcluster.cchmc.org using FDR cutoff of 0.05 for network
  output and xgmml output to Cytoscape.
