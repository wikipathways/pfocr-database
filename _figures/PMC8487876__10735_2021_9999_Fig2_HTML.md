caption: Salivary secretion pathway in DM. Consistent hyperglycemia will lead to an
  increased state of oxidative stress that ultimately impacts salivary secretion and
  flow. In diabetes, M3R’s binding sites, affinity and drug susceptibility are decreased
  which in turn result in a lower intracellular Ca2 + ([Ca2 +]i). Combined with a
  decrease in BH4, a cofactor necessary for the dimerization of uNOS into cNOS, NOS
  activation is decreased paralleled by a reduction in NO catalyzation and AQP5 translocation.
  cGMP production is decreased due to NO deficiency and fails to open ion channels
  (i.e. K + channels, Cl- channels, Na + /K + pumps) to initiate salivary secretion.
  The obstruction of this pathway in DM leads to reduced salivary flow, secretions
  and histomorphological changes accompanied by acinar cells degeneration. Administration
  of pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist, slightly alleviates those effects, whereas
  insulin, LLLT and IXD work directly on recruiting and upregulating AQP5 to reverse
  those effects. M3R, Muscarinic M3 receptor; [Ca2 +]i, intracellular calcium; uNOS,
  uncoupled nitric oxide synthase; cNOS, coupled nitric oxide synthase; NO, nitric
  oxide; cGMP, cyclic guanylate monophosphate; AQP5, aquaporin 5; LLLT, low-level
  laser therapy; IXD, ixeris dentata
