caption: The main sources and signaling pathways of interleukin 6. (A) schematic diagram
  illustrating the primary cellular sources of IL-6, including monocytes, macrophages,
  T cells, B cells, fibroblast, and endothelial cells. (B) depiction of the three
  major IL-6 signaling pathways. IL-6 binds to the mIL-6R and activates the classical
  signaling pathway, which exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, IL-6 can
  bind to the sIL-6R, triggering the trans-signaling pathway that promotes inflammation.
  Through cluster signaling, DCs are able to trans-present IL-6 through a complex
  containing DC-expressed IL-6Rα bound to IL-6 that can interact with gp130 expressed
  on T cells, mediating pathogenic T cell differentiation (The figure is created in
