caption: 'Potential strategies for the treatment of brain tumors. The cartoon summarizes
  the main immunotherapeutic approaches currently used in clinical trials, subdivided
  in four major categories: 1) Cancer Vaccine based on Dendritic Cells (DC) pulsed
  with neoantigens or electropored/infected to transfer neo-antigen genes; 2) Checkpoint
  Inhibitors based on the use of antibody blocking relevant exhaustion pathway in
  T cells; 3) Adoptive Cell Therapy based on genetic modification of effector cells
  with expression vector for TCR or CAR; 4) Oncolytic Virus Therapy based on tumor
  cell infection, and the consequent activation of adaptive immunity. DC, Dendritic
  Cells; CAR, Chimeric Antigen Receptor; TCR, T Cell Receptor; MHC, Major histocompatibility
  complex; NK, Natural Killer cells; OV, Oncolytic virus.'
