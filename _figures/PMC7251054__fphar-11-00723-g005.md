caption: Regulation of sinigrin (SG) in cAMP signaling pathway. After stimulation
  with β-agonists, beta-agonist-mediated pathways are activated. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase
  4 (PDE4) by SG leads to an elevation in cAMP levels, activating protein kinase A
  (PKA). PKA mediates a complex processes leading to an impaired ability to promote
  the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), leading to the relaxation of airway
  smooth muscle (ASM).
