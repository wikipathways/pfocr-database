caption: IIV-6 infection activates a protective response through p38b and JAK-STAT
  signaling IIV-6 infection activates p38b through the NADPH oxidase Nox and presumably
  ROS production. p38b triggers the induction of the unpaireds, which encode for secreted
  ligands which activate the JAK-STAT pathway via the receptor, Domeless. JAK-STAT
  signaling leads to induction of the Turandots (Tots), a family of small, secreted
  proteins with no known function. JAK-STAT as well as p38b signaling protects Drosophila
  from IIV-6 infection, and p38b in particular increases tolerance to this virus.
