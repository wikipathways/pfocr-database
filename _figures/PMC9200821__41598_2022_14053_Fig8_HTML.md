caption: A model illustrating the importance of H2B R95 residue in maintaining the
  expression of the pheromone genes required to arrest cells in the G1 phase in response
  to rapamycin. The native H2B R95 residue is required to recruit RNA polymerase II
  and the associated transcriptional activator under normal conditions to maintain
  the expression of the pheromone response genes. Recruitment of RNA polymerase II
  and the associated transcriptional activator is defective by the H2B R95A mutation
  preventing the expression of the pheromone response genes. This allows the dysregulation
  of the G1 cyclins allowing expression of Cln1, Cln2, and perhaps Cln3, as well as
  other factors to promote cell proliferation in the presence of rapamycin. The illustration
  was created with features from BioRender (BioRender.com).
