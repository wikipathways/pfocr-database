caption: Substances regulating various growth stages of ginseng. Solid lines with
  arrows indicate regulatory relationships between them. Dashed lines with arrows
  indicate potential direct or indirect regulatory pathways between them. Dashed boxes
  represent the regulatory mechanisms of GA promoting plant germination that have
  been elucidated, which may also operate in ginseng
