caption: 'Possible scenarios for PanDrugs therapeutic candidates. PanDrugs proposes
  three potential types of druggable candidates. This includes: (1) direct targets,
  a gene that contributes to a disease phenotype and can be directly targeted by a
  drug; (2) drug-resistance biomarkers, a gene which genetic status is associated
  with a drug response from clinical or pre-clinical evidence but its protein product
  is not the direct target of the drug; and (3) pathway members, a targetable gene
  located downstream to the altered one. To illustrate this, tumors mutated in EGFR
  carrying MET amplifications will not respond to EGFR inhibitors (red). PanDrugs
  proposes as therapeutic strategy MET inhibitors and targeting MET downstream proteins
  (green) to drive tumor cell death'
