caption: The function of small plant peptide in regulating growth and development.
  Small plant peptides exert different effects in various parts of the plant, including
  roots, stems, leaves, and flowers. In root regulation, both CLE and CEP can be transported
  from the roots to the stem, acting on mir2111. CLE has an inhibitory effect on root
  nodules, while CEP promotes the formation of plant root nodules. TDIF positively
  regulates lateral root development by promoting the phosphorylation of ARF receptors.
  Additionally, the peptides OsPEP1 and RALF34 have promoting effects on lateral root
  development in rice and in Arabidopsis, respectively. SCOOP stimulates root growth
  by interacting with MIK2, leading to the formation of a co-receptor complex with
  BAK1. In leaf regulation, CLE14 delays leaf senescence by inhibiting the expression
  of genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis, while CLE42 slows down
  leaf senescence by closing the ethylene synthesis pathway. Regarding flower organ
  regulation, IDA inhibits the abscission of flower organs by acting on the receptor
  HAE/HSL2. The arrow and T-line without arrowheads respectively represent positive
  and negative regulation in the signaling pathway. Solid lines indicate direct regulation,
  while dashed lines indicate the presence of multiple steps or unknown components.
  Cross mark represents suppression.
