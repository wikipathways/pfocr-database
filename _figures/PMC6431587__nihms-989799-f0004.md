caption: '(A) Network modulation onto VTA DA neurons in response to nicotine. The
  IL-BNST-VTA circuit (green) increases the spontaneous VTA DA activities following
  voluntary nicotine consumption. mHb-IPn circuit decreases the reinforcing properties
  of high concentration of nicotine by encoding aversive signal. The precise modulation
  of this pathway onto VTA DA neurons remains poorly understood. LHb-RMTg-VTA circuit
  requires further investigation to fully characterize its function in nicotine reinforcement.
  While LHb-RMTg activation inhibits VTA DA neurons, nicotine activation of RMTg neurons
  does not affect VTA DA neural response to nicotine. (B) Network modulation onto
  VTA DA neurons in response to alcohol. Activation of DA receptors in the NAcsh,
  VP, and PFC are involved in mediating the reinforcing effects of ethanol and inhibitory
  projections from the VP to the VTA may control alcohol seeking and reinstatement.
  The LHb-RMTg-VTA circuit has been hypothesized to contribute to aversive conditioning
  of ethanol response and may account for individual differences in drinking behaviors.
  Stress and withdrawal affects of chronic alcohol exposure are highly controlled
  by the connections between VTA and AMG.Abbreviations: AMG, Amygdala; BNST, bed nucleus
  of the stria terminalis; CPu, caudate putamen; IL, infralimbic cortex; IPn, interpeduncular
