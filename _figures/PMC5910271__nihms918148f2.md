caption: Oscillation of NAD+ play an important role in modulating the functions of
  NAD+-dependent enzymes such as SIRT1, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1).
  These molecules part take in the posttranslational modification of clock proteins
  (e.g. BMAL1, PER2). Moreover, NAD+ affects mitochondrial metabolism via SIRT3 activation.
  It has been shown that the level and/or activity of the redox-sensitive transcription
  factor (NRF2) and other antioxidant enzymes that regulate protection against oxidative
  stress response oscillate in a rhythmic manner both in vitro and in vivo. This includes
  glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase, superoxide dismutase
  (SOD) and peroxiredoxins (PRXs) (which peaks during the day). Recently, it has been
  shown that pentose phosphate pathways (PPP), a key pathway in NADPH metabolism,
  also affects circadian oscillations in a redox-dependent manner. Nrf2 plays a vital
  role in the interplay between redox and circadian oscillations (in human cells,
  mouse tissues and flies). The GSH systems is catalyzed by the enzyme GPx which allows
  reaction of two GSH molecules with H2O2 to form H2O and the oxidized form of GSH,
  glutathione disulfide (GSSG). The next step in this reaction is catalyzed by GR
  which requires NADPH as a hydrogen donor that comes from the PPP signaling. Oxidative
  stress-mediated increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) can directly or indirectly
  affect both the NAD recovery pathway and GSH/GSSG redox signaling in the lungs.
  Increased oxidative burden in the lungs (e.g. elevated ROS) can lead to a reduction
  in SIRT1 and Nrf2, both vital contributors to clock function. Modulating the activity
  of clock regulators at particular times using novel chronopharmacological agents
  (e.g. REV-ERB agonists (SR9009, SR9011, GSK4112) and SIRT activators (SRT1720, SRT2183)
  may attenuate or even reverse molecular clock dysregulation during chronic airway
  disease such as COPD, asthma and fibrosis.
