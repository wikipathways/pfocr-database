caption: '(a) The biosynthetic pathway leading to the biosynthesis of the anthocyanidin.
  Anthocyanidin is further modified with glycosyl, acyl, or methyl groups catalysed
  by glycosyltransferase, acyltransferase and methyltransferase as described in the
  text. The typical color that each anthocyanidin tend to give is shown, but the actual
  color depends on various factors as described in the text. Note that though the
  positions of methylation on the B-ring are shown, methyl groups are added to anthocyanins,
  not to anthocyanidins. Abbreviations: CHS, chalcone synthase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; MT, methyltransferase, GT, glucosyltransferase;
  AT, acyltransferase; FNS, flavone synthase; FLS, flavonol synthase. (b) Typical
  blue polyacyl anthocyanins; gentiodelphin from Gentiana triflora and ternatin A1
  from Clitoria ternatea.'
