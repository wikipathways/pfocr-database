caption: 'MAL structure, pathway and dependent immune responses during infections.
  (A) Protein structure of MAL, binding sites (above) and regulation sites (below).
  P, phosphorylation; Ub, ubiquitination; G, S-glutathionylation. (B) Among other
  receptors, MAL affects signals downstream of TLR-2, TLR-4, RAGE and IFNGR. When
  TLR-4 is activated by LPS, MAL is recruited by its PIP2 binding domain to TLR-4
  rich regions of the plasma membrane. MAL then facilitates the recruitment of MyD88
  and the formation of the myddosome, which is important for the activation of the
  NF-κB pathway, thus inducing inflammation. Signaling pathway activated downstream
  of RAGE can also induce NF-κB dependent inflammation. MAL induces the translocation
  of p65-NF-κB to the nucleus through AKT phosphorylation, independently from MyD88
  signaling. Also, independently from MyD88, MAL can activate CREB via p38-MAPK and
  Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) signaling pathways. Another pathway
  involving MAL is downstream IFNGR, which leads to phosphorylation of p38-MAPK. AGEs,
  Advanced Glycation End products; DD, Death Domain; P, Phosphate group; LP, Lipopeptide.
  (C) The Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection model was used to confirm MAL signaling
  from endosomes. TLRs found at the cell surface signal from a PIP2-rich subdomain,
  and MAL is recruited to that location via interactions with PIP2. TLRs found on
  endosomes (TLR-9) signal from a domain rich in PI3P. These lipids direct MAL to
  endosomes to promote TLR-9 signaling after viral DNA recognition. Brucella infection:
  Brucella interferes with immune responses by producing TcpB, which targets MAL to
  inhibit NF-κB activation. TcpB also targets CLIP70 inducing MAL ubiquitination and
  degradation by the proteasome. Staphylococcus infection: Lipoteichoic acid (LTA),
  a toxin produced by Staphylococcus bacteria, is recognized by TLR-2. TLR-2 activation
  induces MAL signaling to eliminate the toxin/bacteria. LTA is also recognized by
  antibodies (aLTA Ab), which are recognized by CD32 (Fcγ receptor II). In patients
  carrying the R121W mutation in MAL, adaptive immunity can compensate for defects
  in MAL function. Mycobacterium infection: Killing M. tuberculosis requires activation
  of TLR-2- and IFNGR-dependent signaling pathways within phagocytes to induce phagosome
  maturation and autophagy.'
