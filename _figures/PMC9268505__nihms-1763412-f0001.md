caption: 'The pathway in the “off” formation follows through these steps: (1) inactivated
  PTCH causes the degradation of SMO intracellularly and prevents its translocation
  to the cell membrane (2) the SUFU-GLI complex is phosphorylated by PKA leading to
  its (3) processing by the proteasome into (4) GLI-R which translocates to the nucleus
  and turns off genes. When the pathway is in the “on” formation (5) a hedgehog ligand
  binds to PTCH which leads to its internalization and degradation as well as stimulating
  (6) SMO translocation to the cellular membrane on the cilia where it is (7) phosphorylated
  by PKA and initiates a cascade passing through intraflagellar transport proteins
  (IFT) leading to (8) the dissociation of SUFU and GLI and the translocation of (9)
  GLI-A to the nucleus where is turns on target genes. Created with BioRender.com.'
