caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism of action of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy-induced
  ferroptosis promoting endothelial injure. NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy-induced
  ferroptosis is a key mechanism promoting endothelial injury. The key upstream regulator
  of NCOA4 expression is associated with cGAS-STING, which is a downstream signaling
  pathway activated by the LOX-1 receptor
