caption: Model of the role of aPKC in the estradiol-induced signaling complex. PKCζ,
  activated by the p85-associated PI 3-kinase, induces recruitment of Ras to the ERα/Src/p85/PKCζ
  complex and allows Ras stimulation by the Src/Shc-SOS pathway. Activation of PI
  3-kinase- and Ras-dependent kinase cascades leads to increased cyclin D1 transcription
  and decreased p27 nuclear localization, respectively. These events are required
  for the G1/S transition of MCF-7 cells.
