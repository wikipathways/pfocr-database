caption: 'The multicomponent processes encompassed in the computational model are
  illustrated as either: enzymes (open circle), inhibitors (hatched circle), zymogens
  (open boxes) or complexes (open ovals). Upon injury to the vessel wall, tissue factor,
  the cofactor for the extrinsic tenase complex, is exposed to circulating factor
  VIIa and forms the vitamin K dependent complex the extrinsic tenase. Factor IX and
  factor X are converted to their serine proteases factor IXa (FIXa) and factor Xa
  (FXa) which then form the intrinsic tenase and the prothrombinase complexes, respectively.
  The combined actions of the intrinsic and extrinsic tenase and the prothrombinase
  complexes lead to an explosive burst of the enzyme thrombin (IIa). The procoagulant
  response is down regulated by the stoichiometric inhibitors tissue factor pathway
  inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin (AT). TFPI serves to attenuate the activity of
  the extrinsic tenase trigger of coagulation. AT directly inhibits thrombin, FIXa
  and factor Xa. The proteins in which the concentrations from individual subjects
  are used are shown in red. Tissue factor in blue is arbitrarily set to 5 pM. Circulating
  FVIIa is set at 1% of the concentration of FVII from each individual.'
