caption: Schematic model for role of FoxO1 in inflammation. After stroke, TRAF5 is
  activated, leading to the suppression of Akt pathway. Then the phosphorylation of
  FoxO1 is inhibited which further leads to the nuclear translocation and activation
  of FoxO1. Activation of FoxO1, resulting in an increase of MMP9, IL-1β, TNF-α at
  the transcriptional level, further leads to the increase of the inflammatory response.
  The solid line represents the pathway that occurs after stroke, and the dotted line
  represents the pathway suppressed after stroke.
