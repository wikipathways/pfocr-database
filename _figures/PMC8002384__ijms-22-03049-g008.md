caption: Red blood cell (RBC) and plasma abnormalities in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
  progression. Uremic RBC showed a compensatory increase of eNOS (endothelial Nitric
  Oxide Synthase, also named RBC-NOS) phosphorylation levels along with intra-erythrocyte
  accumulation of cGMP (cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate). The latter mainly caused
  by decreased ATPase activity of MRP4 (multidrug-resistance-associated protein-4),
  a known cGMP membrane transporter, caused by rising levels of tyrosine nitration
  and cysteine nitrosylation of this transporter (NOTyr-MRP4 and NOCys-MRP4). Moreover,
  plasma levels of cGMP increased, potentially as a consequence of reduced renal clearance,
  while plasma Nitrite levels decreased. Notably, Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) impaired
  these parameters to a lesser extent than other CKD therapies. In parallel, the carotid
  Intima-Media Thickness (IMT), which was measured on the right and left common carotids,
  significantly increased in patients on Conservative Therapies (CT) and Hemodialysis
  (HD), while in patients on PD was comparable to healthy subjects.
