caption: The schematic overview of the classical ATM and ATR DDR. The ATM/CHK2 pathway
  is activated by double-strand breaks, while ATR/CHK1 pathway is induced by single-strand
  breaks or replication stress. Activated ATM or ATR phosphorylates critical targets
  such as p53, CHK2, and CHK1, which are essential for regulating cell cycle checkpoints.
  Activated p53 leads to G1-phase cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis. Phosphorylation
  of Cdc25 mediated by CHK2 and CHK1 results in cell cycle arrest in either S phase
  or G2/M phase. FANCD2 and FANCI, as the key components of the Fanconi anemia (FA)
  pathway, can be activated by ATM or ATR. In addition, activation of the ATM and
  ATR pathways play critical roles in regulation of DNA repair, apoptosis, and replication
  fork stability.
