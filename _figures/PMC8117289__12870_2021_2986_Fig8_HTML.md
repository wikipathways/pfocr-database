caption: A proposed biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanin in the rind of sugarcane. Compounds
  are shown in ovals. The genes that catalyze each chemical reaction is shown above
  or to the right of the arrows. The compounds shown in yellow are those found in
  wide varieties of plant species. They represent the common upstream pathway. The
  compounds shown in peak are those specific for different plant species. The cyanidin
  and glycosylated cyanidin were found to be most abundant in the rind of sugarcane
  samples studied. All the compounds shown in peak were detected in this study. The
  cyanidin and its derivatives are the most abundant in sugarcane (indicated with
  *)
