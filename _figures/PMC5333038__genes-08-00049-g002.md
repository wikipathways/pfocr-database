caption: Replication fork stability by chromatin assembly. Defective nucleosome assembly
  in yeast by a deficit in the pool of newly synthesized histones, or a lack of the
  H3K56Ac/CAF1/Rtt106 histone deposition pathway (symbolized by a dashed red arrow)
  causes replication fork breakage and its rescue by homologous recombination [,].
  Uncoupling DNA synthesis from histone deposition might expose ssDNA fragments to
  nucleases, impair the process of Okazaki fragment maturation or alter the correct
  distribution of cohesins, leading to DNA breaks.
