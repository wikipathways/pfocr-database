caption: Overview of insulin signaling pathway and the shortlisted key mRNA markers.
  Insulin receptor stimulates CAV1 and triggers a series of phosphorylation events
  activating IRS/PI3K/AKT pathway leading to increased GLUT4 translocation, inhibition
  of glycogen synthesis, increased myogenic growth transformation, and increased apoptosis.
  TGFB also appears to significantly contribute to IRS/PI3K/AKT pathway influencing
  cell proliferation, differentiation, and growth. TL4R, cytokines and antigen specific
  responses lead to activation of STAT3 resulting in the translation of PRDM1 to BLIMP1
  protein. Arrow indicates the direction of gene regulation
