caption: Signaling cascades required for TCR-mediated integrin activation. Ligation
  of the TCR activates the proximal tyrosine kinases Lck (not shown) and ZAP-70. These
  kinases can then activate several pathways known to regulate integrin activation,
  including the LAT-ITK-PLCγ1 pathway, required for both TCR-mediated calcium flux
  and activation of the small GTPase of the Ras family, RAP1. Targets of Rap1 (PKD,
  RAPL, MST1) regulate integrin activation primarily through the appropriate clustering
  of integrins on the cell surface. ADAP and SKAP55 are both required for TCR-mediated
  integrin activation and have been shown to affect both cytoskeletal dynamics as
  well as the localization of RAP1. ADAP and SKAP55 have also been shown to be indirectly
  linked to active RAP1 through another RAP1 effector, RIAM, which constitutively
  interacts with SKAP55. Finally, the RHO GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 (while never formally
  shown to be required for TCR-mediated integrin activation) can be activated by VAV1,
  leading to cytoskeletal reorganization, possibly through the activation of WAVE2.
  The integrin scaffolding protein Talin binds to F-actin filaments and also directly
  to the tail of the integrin β chain and has been shown to control both integrin
  affinity and clustering. Importantly, several of these proteins (*) are not required
  for PMA-stimulated integrin activation, suggesting that integrins can be activated
  independently of proximal TCR-stimulated signaling pathways when stimulated with
  PMA. Whether WAVE2 regulates cytoskeletal rearrangement leading to integrin activation
  is the focus of this study.
