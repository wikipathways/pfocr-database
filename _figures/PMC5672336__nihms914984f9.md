caption: Activation of Gq/11 protein-coupled receptors (GqPCR) mobilizes 2-AG through
  the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), generation of diacylglyercol (DAG), and
  conversion of DAG to 2-AG by DAG lipase (DAGL). 2-AG inhibits IA by lipid interaction
  with Kv4.3 channels. 2-AG may be converted to structurally-related metabolites,
  such as arachidonic acid (AA), through MAG lipase (MAGL) or another enzyme. If produced,
  AA can inhibit IA by a similar mechanism. This pathway may be activated by calcium
  entry during high frequency action potential firing, but weakly in comparison to
  activation of GqPCRs. This cell-autonomous, autocrine signaling mechanism enhances
  the excitability of dopamine neurons.
