caption: Schematic representation of CILP function and regulation in NP cells by TGF-β
  and IGF-1. CILP inhibits SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, either directly or by interfering
  with TGF-β binding to its receptor TGFR, ultimately inhibiting the TGF-β/SMAD signaling
  pathway. In addition, CILP can inhibit the binding of IGF-1 and its receptor IGFR1.
  Furthermore, CILP can inhibit the function of the combination of IGF-1 and IGFR1
  in NP cells and interfere with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, eventually leading
  to a decrease in ECM production, aggrecan expression, and growth and differentiation
  of intervertebral disc cells. CILP, cartilage intermediate layer protein; NP, nucleus
  pulposus; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1;
  TGFR, transforming growth factor-β receptors; SMAD, mothers against decapentaplegic
  homolog; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; IGFR1, IGF-1 cell surface receptors;
  ECM, extracellular matrix.
