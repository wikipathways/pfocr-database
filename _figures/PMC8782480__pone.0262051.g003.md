caption: The nodes represent genes/molecules/complexes in a pathway, and the lines
  and arrows between nodes indicate known relationships from the Ingenuity Knowledge
  Base. Nodes with purple outline indicate molecules that were measured as differentially
  expressed in our dataset, with the intensity of coloured infill indicating the level
  of up (red) or down (green) regulation of Holstein relative to Sahiwal. The blue-
  and orange-coloured molecules and lines are predicted activation states generated
  by the Molecular Activity Predictor function in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).
  Blue colour indicates a predicted inhibition, and orange a predicted activation
  state in Holstein relative to Sahiwal. Yellow lines indicate relationships where
  our findings are inconsistent with the state of the downstream molecule. Broad lines
  with explanatory text beside the pathway indicate the cellular location of molecules
  in the pathway. The molecules in the pathway are given shapes that indicate their
  functional class (Nested Circle/Square = Group/Complex, Horizontal ellipse = Transcriptional
  Regulator, Vertical Ellipse = transmembrane receptor, Vertical Rhombus = enzyme,
  Square = Cytokine/Growth Factor, Triangle = Kinase, Vertical Ellipse = Transmembrane
  Receptor, Circle = other). The edges between molecules are also differentiated to
  indicate the type of relationship between them. Solid lines are direct relationships
  and dashed lines are indirect.
