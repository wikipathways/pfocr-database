caption: 'Glucose enters the cell through its glucose transporter, and is phosphorylated
  and metabolized in the mitochondrion as well free fatty acids (FFA). Glucose and
  FFA metabolism leads to an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio, closure of the ATP-sensitive
  potassium (KATP) channels leading to plasma membrane (PM) depolarization that increase
  a calcium influx through the voltage-gated calcium channels and an increase in cytoplasmic
  Ca2+. Other transmembrane channels can also regulate PM potential: K+Kr is the voltage
  gated K+ channel, SOC is the store operating channels, Nab is the Na+ background
  current, NALCN is the specific nonselective cation channel that can be modulated
  by acetylcholine through activation of M3 muscarinic receptors (M3R). Increase in
  cytoplasmic Ca2+ leads to the activation of several calcium dependent enzymes including
  adenylyl cyclase (AC) and phospholipase C (PLC). Phosphoinositides pathway: phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
  (P4P) is synthesized from phosphatidylinositol (PI) by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases
  and its synthesis activates by PKC and Ca2+. Phosphotidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) in turn is primarily formed from P4P by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
  5-kinase I. cAMP pathway: Ca2+/CaM is Ca2+-bound calmodulin, Synthesis and degradation
  of cAMP are catalyzed by adenylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase (PDE), respectively.
  ACc is the soluble AC, ACP is the G-protein controlled AC on plasmalemma that can
  be activated by stimulatory Gαs type G-protein and Ca2+/CaM and deactivated by inhibitory
  Gi/o type G-protein. PDE activity can be enhanced by Ca2+/CaM, cAMP activates protein
  kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein (Epac). The incretins glucagon-like peptide-1
  (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) bind to their respective
  receptors (GLP-1R and GIPR), activate ACP and increase intracellular levels of cAMP.
  Endogenous catecholamines adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine)
  bound with G-protein-coupled α2A-adrenergic receptors (AdR) on plasma membrane and
  inhibit ACP. Phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. PLCC is the cytoplasmic calcium activated
  PLC and PLCP is plasma membrane bound PLC that can be activated by Gq type G-protein.
  Acetylcholine and FFA can bind to their respective receptors (M3R and FFAR1/GPR40)
  expressed at the cell surface and trigger a Gaq-mediated activation of PLCP. PLCC
  and PLCP generate inositol-3-phosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by hydrolyzing
  membrane PIP2. DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER):
  SERCA is the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase, IP3R is the IP3 receptor; that can
  be activated by IP3 and PKA. Solid lines indicate fluxes, and dashed lines indicate
  inhibitory or stimulatory influences on currents or fluxes.'
