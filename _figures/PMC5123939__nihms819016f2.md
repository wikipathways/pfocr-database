caption: Mechanisms of activation for non-canonical and alternative NLRP3 inflammasomes.
  Non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation (left side of the figure) is induced
  by Gram-negative bacteria. LPS is delivered into the cytosol through transfection
  or infection and activates caspase-11. Active caspase-11 triggers the opening of
  the pannexin-1 channel through cleavage, which induces the K+ efflux required for
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation and release of IL-1β. Caspase-11 activation also drives
  pyroptosis through the cleavage of gasdermin D. The gasdermin D N domain disrupts
  cellular functions by forming pores on the membrane. The activation of P2X7 by ATP
  released from the pannexin-1 channel also contributes to pyroptosis. The alternative
  NLRP3 inflammasome (right side of the figure) is activated in human monocytes in
  response to LPS. For this pathway, K+ efflux is dispensable, and molecules RIPK1,
  FADD and CASP8 are required, and no ASC speck formation or pyroptosis is induced.

  description: Mechanisms of activation for non-canonical and alternative NLRP3 inflammasomes.
