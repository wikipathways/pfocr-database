caption: Сomplex interplay between cell cycle-related genes and their influence on
  various signaling pathways in NETs. EPCAM, BCL2, STMN1, and MYCN influence pathways
  involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [[235], [236], [237]], with
  MYCN exerting a particular influence on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway [238]. Additionally,
  MYCN influences the MYCN-PARP-DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and the p-53 signaling
  pathway [239]. EZH2 and UCHL1 also interact with the p53 signaling pathway [240,241].
  BCL2 further influences the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway [235]. CDK4 and UCHL1
  modulate the CDK4/6-pRB-E2F pathway [241], with CDK4 acting as an inhibitor [242].
  STMN1 enhances the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [243], while EGFR, RET, RICTOR, and UCHL1
  exert distinct, yet undefined, effects on this pathway [241,[244], [245], [246],
  [247]]. RET additionally influences the MAPK/ERK and c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) pathways
  [244]. DLK1 and EGFR impact the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways [245,248], with
  DLK1 acting as an inhibitor of both [249,250]. СEACAM5 enhances the MAPK/ERK pathway
  [251]. The green color represents activation of the pathway, the red color represents
  inhibition of the pathway, the white color indicates genes with insufficient information
  for precise evaluation as enhancers or inhibitors, and the gray color indicates
  signaling pathways
