caption: 'Suggested actions of HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 disease. Extracellularly,
  HCQ interferes with the entry of virus in host cell by hindering the binding of
  virus on its membrane receptor ACE2 (a). Intracellularly, HCQ inhibits the replication
  rate of virus by increasing pH in acid compartments of the endo/auto-lysosomal trafficking
  system and blocking endosome/autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This prevents the release
  of viral RNA (grey jagged lines) and proteins (yellow polygons) and their assembly
  in the Golgi complex in order new mature virions be generated and released extracellularly
  via the secretory pathway (b). Ultimately, HCQ could reduce the rate of new infections
  in community by disrupting the vicious cycle of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (c). Furthermore,
  HCQ may exert anti-inflammatory actions. Diminished viral RNA sensing by TLRs, as
  well as reduced presentation of viral epitopes in T-cells attenuate proinflammatory
  cytokine production, whereas in neutrophils HCQ inhibits autophagy-mediated NET
  formation (NETosis) (d).HCQ: hydroxychloroquine; ACE2: angiotensin-converting enzyme
  2; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; NET: neutrophil
  extracellular traps.'
