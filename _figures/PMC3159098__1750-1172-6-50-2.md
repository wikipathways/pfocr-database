caption: 'Different RNA processing events in mammals. 2A: Eukaryotic splicing pathway
  of tRNA splicing in mammals. The TSEN complex is involved in the maturation of premature
  tRNAs and excises the tRNA into two halves; one 5''tRNA half with a 2''-3'' cyclic
  phosphate at one exon-end and a 3''tRNA half with a 5''OH-group at the other exon-end.
  The final processing of tRNA maturation involves either direct ligation of the two
  tRNA halves by ligation through the Archaea-like pathway (by HSPC117, depicted)
  or indirect ligation through the yeast-like pathway (not depicted) []. Adapted from
  Calvin et al. []. 2B: tRNA aminoacylation in mammals. RARS2 can bind to its cognate
  amino acid in an ATP dependent matter. This complex of ATP, RARS2 and arginine binds
  to the mt-tRNA-Arg and arginine will be transferred to its tRNA. Adapted from Antonellis
  et al. []. 2C: Selenocysteine synthesis. Serine (Ser) is aminoacylated to tRNA-Sec
  by a seryl-tRNA synthetase (SARS). This Ser-tRNA-Sec complex is then converted by
  a kinase to a Sep-tRNA-Sec complex. In the presence of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate
  (PLP) and the selenium donor selenophosphate (Se-donor) the SEPSECS enzyme converts
  the Sep-tRNA-Sec to Sec-tRNA-Sec. Adapted from Allmang et al. [].'
