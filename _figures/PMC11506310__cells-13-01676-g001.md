caption: TRAIL-induced pro-apoptotic signaling pathway. The binding of TRAIL to TRAIL
  receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1) and/or TRAIL-R2 recruits FADD and caspase-8, forming the DISC.
  The FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) can compete with caspase-8 for FADD binding.
  The activation of caspase-8 is enhanced through cullin 3 ubiquitylation and, in
  type I cells, can activate caspase-3, leading to apoptosis. In type II cells, the
  processing of effector caspases is inhibited by the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
  protein (XIAP), necessitating additional signaling for apoptosis to occur. Caspase-8
  cleaves the BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID), which translocates to the
  mitochondria, activating BCL-2 antagonist killer 1 (BAK) and BCL-2-associated X
  protein (BAX). This causes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP),
  leading to the release of SMAC (mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) and cytochrome
  C. SMAC can block XIAP’s inhibitory effect, while cytochrome C, together with apoptotic
  protease activating factor 1 (APAF-1), mediates the assembly of the apoptosome,
  which activates caspase-9 and amplifies caspase-3 activity
