caption: Overview of the potential mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of
  magnesium on vascular calcification. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), imbalances
  in calcification inhibitors and inducers promote the formation of amorphous calcium/phosphate
  particles (ACPs). These particles nucleate and mature into hydroxyapatite crystals,
  which are crucial for the osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells
  (VSMC). Mg demonstrates inhibitory effects on hydroxyapatite formation, and studies
  suggest it also hinders vascular calcification by influencing the maturation of
  calciprotein particles 2 (CPP2), which also induces the transformation of VSMCs
  into an osteogenic phenotype, ultimately contributing to vascular calcification.
  In addition, since CPP2 consists of a crystalline hydroxyapatite core, it is possible
  that the prevention of hydroxyapatite crystal formation by Mg might also contribute,
  at least in part, to its effects on CPP2-mediated vascular calcification. The anti-calcifying
  effects of Mg also involve decreased expression of osteogenic transcription factors
  and the prevention of the loss of calcification inhibitors. Mechanistically, the
  divalent cation channel transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7), a major
  Mg channel in VSMCs, plays an important role in the development of calcification.
  Mg uptake by TRPM7 inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is known
  to regulate genes promoting VSMC osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, Mg prevents
  high phosphate-induced VSMC osteogenic differentiation by activating the calcium-sensing
  receptor (CaSR), which acts as a calcimimetic to reduce vascular calcification.
  MicroRNA modulation is another potential mechanism, with Mg counteracting the disrupted
  expression of specific microRNAs (i.e., 30b, 133a, and 143) promoted by high phosphate
  levels, contributing to the inhibition of vascular calcification
