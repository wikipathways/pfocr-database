caption: Diagram depicting pathways of synthesis and degradation of angiotensins in
  classical and nonclassical RAS, with respective receptors for each bioactive peptide.
  Classical RAS is defined as the ACE–Ang II–AT1R axis; the nonclassical RAS is composed
  of the ACE2–Ang1‐7–MasR axis, further metabolism of Ang1‐7, and the angiotensin
  2‐8/angiotensin 3‐8 pathway. The main degradative pathway of Ang II in humans is
  through the sequential actions of plasma aminopeptidases A and N. AT1‐2‐4Rs, angiotensin
  type 1‐2‐4 receptors; MRGD, Mas‐related G protein‐coupled receptor member D.
