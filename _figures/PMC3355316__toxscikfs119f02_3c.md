caption: Suggested mechanisms by which NPs may induce molecular signaling cascades
  leading to upregulation of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway in the liver of exposed
  C57BL/6 mice. We demonstrate that inflammation is induced by pulmonary deposition
  of nanomaterials, resulting in activation of APR. Secretion of APR reactants such
  as SAA into plasma is suggested to induce structural changes of HDL that may increase
  its catabolism and inhibit its capacity to associate with cholesterol, thus potentially
  inhibiting reverse cholesterol transport. Inflammation may also downregulate cholesterol
  efflux genes in lung (for example, Abcg1 and Abca1), thus inhibiting cholesterol
  from reaching HDL. Such molecular changes inhibiting transport of excess cholesterol
  to liver for secretion into bile may lead to activation of the sterol-sensitive
  HMG-CoA reductase pathway in liver, leading to increased terpenoid and cholesterol
  synthesis. Increased SAA and LDL and decreased HDL are associated with cardiovascular
  disease risk.
