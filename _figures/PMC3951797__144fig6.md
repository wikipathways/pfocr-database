caption: 'Postsqualene cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The figure depicts oxidation
  of squalene by the flavoenzyme squalene monooxygenase and subsequent cyclization
  by LSS to form lanosterol, the first sterol (cyclopentanophenanthrene ring) in the
  cholesterogenic pathway. Lanosterol is a major branch point metabolite between 2
  proposed biosynthetic pathways to cholesterol: the Bloch and the Kandutsch-Russell
  pathways. The metabolites in these pathways differ in that Bloch metabolites exhibit
  a Δ24 double bond in the aliphatic side chain as opposed to having a fully saturated
  side chain (Kandutsch-Russell metabolites). Both pathways depend on 2 flavin-dependent
  enzymes: CYP51A1 and DHCR24. The former enzyme conducts demethylations of lanosterol
  and 24,25-dihydrolanosterol–generating sterols: 14-demethyllanosterol and 14-demethyl
  dihydrolanosterol, respectively. These lanosterol derivatives are precursors to
  a series of “sister” metabolites that exhibit the Δ24 double bond (Bloch metabolites)
  or 24,25 dihydro side chain (Kandutsch-Russell metabolites). The latter pathway
  is predominant in most tissues and has cholesterol as its final metabolite. In contrast
  to cholesterol, incorporation of Bloch pathway sterols (especially desmosterol)
  into cell membranes increases their permeability and fluidity. Multiple arrows indicate
  reactions not shown in each metabolic pathway. Other enzymes shared by both pathways
  are EBP, SC5D, and DHCR7. DHCR7, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase; EBP, emopamil binding
  protein (3-β-hydroxysteroid-Δ8,Δ7-isomerase); LSS, lanosterol synthase; SC5D, sterol-C5-desaturase-like.'
