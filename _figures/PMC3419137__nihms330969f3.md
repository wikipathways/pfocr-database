caption: A. The most significant network from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis for upregulated
  proteins in the conditioned media shows evidence of TGFβ-1 regulation. B. Network
  analysis of upregulated proteins combined from conditioned media, cell surface and
  total cell extracts reveals a stronger and more significant node than from the individual
  compartments C. Proteins directly interacting with and regulating TGFβ-1. Network
  objects colored red indicate upregulation and green objects indicate downregulation.
  D. Western blots comparing protein expression in epithelial and mesenchymal NSCLC
  cell lines. E. Microenvironment related proteins downregulated with miR-200 expression.
