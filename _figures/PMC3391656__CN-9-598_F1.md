caption: Proteolytic processing of APP and the NOTCH receptor by γ-secretase. The
  Aβ peptide is derived by sequential proteolysis from APP, a ubiquitously expressed
  type I transmembrane protein. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP molecules are first
  cleaved at the cell surface or in early endosomes by β-secretase (BACE1), a membrane
  bound aspartyl protease, generating a large, soluble ectodomain, APPs-β, and a membrane-bound
  fragment, C99, that defines the N-terminus of the Aβ sequence []. Subsequent cleavage
  of C99 by the aspartyl protease γ-secretase approximately in the middle of the TMD
  generates the C-terminus of the Aβ peptide and releases Aβ from APP. γ- secretase
  generates Aβ peptides of varying length elongated or truncated at the C-terminus,
  with peptides ending after 40 and 42 amino acids being the predominant species.
  In addition to cleavage in the middle of the TMD (γ-cleavage), γ-secretase cleaves
  close to the cytosolic border of the membrane (ε-cleavage). This cleavage liberates
  the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which may have a function in transcriptional
  regulation []. The NOTCH receptor is synthesized as a 300 kDa precursor that is
  cleaved by a furin-like convertase in the trans- Golgi compartment and assembled
  into a mature heterodimer receptor through non-covalent linkage of the resulting
  protein fragments (S1 cleavage) [, ]. At the cell surface, binding of DSL family
  ligands (Delta/Jagged) induces shedding of the ectodomain by the metalloprotease
  ADAM10 (S2 cleavage). The resulting, membrane-bound C-terminal fragment termed NOTCH
  extracellular truncation (NEXT) undergoes cleavage by γ-secretase at the cytosolic
  border of the membrane (S3 cleavage), which releases the NOTCH intracellular domain
  (NICD) into the cytosol. NICD travels to the nucleus where it functions as a transcriptional
  activator [, ]. Interestingly, γ-secretase also cleaves the NEXT fragment in the
  middle of the TMD at sites topologically similar to the cleavage sites in APP that
  generate the Aβ peptides. These cleavages (S4 cleavage) generate the Nβ peptides,
  predominantly Nβ21 and Nβ25, which are released into the extracellular space [].
  In addition to NOTCH receptors, a large number of type-1 membrane proteins including
  NOTCH receptor ligands, APP homologs, ErbB-4, E- and N-cadherin and CD44 have been
  identified as γ-secretase substrates. Whereas the physiological relevance of γ-secretase-mediated
  cleavage events in many of these substrates remains to be clarified, suppression
  of NOTCH receptor processing and signaling has been shown to result in dramatic
  phenotypes in a variety of organisms [].
