caption: 'Left: the KRAS-PI3K pathway, which is activated in BCCs with high lung-metastatic
  potential, induces the c-JUN-mediated transcriptional upregulation of GALNT14. GALNT14-expressing
  BCCs possess the ability to self-renew against lung-derived BMPs, potentially via
  GALNT14-mediated BMPR O-GalNAcylation, which results in the attenuation of BMP responsiveness
  and therefore an increase in SOX4 expression. As a result, GALNT14-expressing BCCs
  can initiate metastatic colonies in the lung parenchyma. Right: To establish macrometastases,
  GALNT14-expressing BCCs secrete chemokines, which creates a favourable microenvironment
  by stimulating macrophage infiltration. Furthermore, the O-GalNAcylation of FGFR1
  by GALNT14 enables BCCs to exploit macrophage-derived FGFs (for example, FGF2),
  ensuring their continuous proliferation within the lung microenvironment.'
