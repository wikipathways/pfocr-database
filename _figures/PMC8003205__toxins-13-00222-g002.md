caption: 'CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9
  screens identified genes involved in Gb3 biosynthesis, with a schematic diagram
  of the Gb3 biosynthesis pathway and a summary of the top genes identified in CRISPR/Cas9
  screens. Cer: ceramide. ACACA: acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha. Acyl-CoA: acetyl-CoA.
  Mal-CoA: malonyl-CoA. Pal-CoA: palmitoyl-CoA. SPT: serine palmitoyl transferase
  complex. 3-KDS: 3-dihydrosphingosine. DHS: dihydrosphingosine. KDSR: 3-ketodihydrosphingominol
  reductase. DHC: dihydroceramide. CERS: ceramide synthase family enzymes. DEGS: dihydroceramide
  Δ4-desaturases. GlcCer: glucosylceramide. UGCG: ceramide glucosyltransferase. LacCer:
  lactosylceramide. B4GALT5: β-1,4-galactosyltransferase 5. A4GALT: α-1,4-galactosyltransferase.
  UGP2: UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2. GALE: UDP-galactose 4-epimerase. SLC35A2
  transports UDP-galactose from the cytosol into Golgi. Four new host factors are
  shown: LAPTM4A (lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 4 alpha) may be involved
  in the synthesis of Gb3 from LacCer; TM9SF2 (transmembrane 9 superfamily member
  2) and TMEM165 (transmembrane protein 165) may play a role in maintaining a suitable
  environment in the Golgi for optimal glycosyltransferase activity; AHR (aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor) can directly bind and activate the promoter of the gene encoding serine
  palmityl transferase subunit A (SPTSSA), which regulates the first step in the biosynthesis
  of new sphingolipids.'
