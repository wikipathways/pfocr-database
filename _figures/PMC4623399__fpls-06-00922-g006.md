caption: Summary of protein and metabolites data at t = 8 h. Up-regulated proteins
  and metabolites in the OE line (vs WT) are indicated in red and down-regulated proteins
  and metabolites are indicated in green color. Undetected proteins and metabolites
  are indicated in black color. Proteins and metabolites without significant changes
  are shown in blue color. Under illumination, the abundances of some enzymes in the
  Calvin–Benson cycle, starch synthesis and sucrose synthesis were higher in the OE
  line, whereas the abundances of some enzymes in the glycolysis pathway and TCA cycle
  were lower or unaltered in the OE line. Regarding the respiratory complexes, some
  Complex I subunits exhibited lower protein abundances, but that of Complex II–V
  were generally unaltered.
