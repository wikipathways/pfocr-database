caption: 'Thiopurine metabolism and proposed mechanisms of action. Green boxes indicate
  three immunosuppressing effects of thiopurines: TdGTP intercalation into DNA, inhibition
  of Rac1 and subsequent T-cell activation, and inhibition of de novo DNA synthesis.
  Red lines indicate inhibition of XO by allopurinol (can be used to shunt the pathway
  away from 6-TU in patients with high TPMT activity receiving low-dose thiopurines).
