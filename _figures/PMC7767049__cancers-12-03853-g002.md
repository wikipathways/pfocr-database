caption: 'Administration of β-AR blockade can enhance the efficacy of RT by modulation
  of tumor microenvironment in irradiated and non-irradiated tumors. 1. For irradiated
  tumors: β-blocker (a) suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis via modulation
  of cell cycle. (b) suppresses neuroendocrine differentiation by blocking cAMP/PKA/CREB
  pathway and inhibits the conversion of prorenin to renin and downregulates RAS which
  is required for cancer stem cell maintenance and differentiation. (c) inhibits HIF-1α
  mediated angiogenesis and LYPD3 induced metastasis, and mitochondrial and glucose
  metabolism in cancer cells. 2. For non-irradiated tumors: β-blocker (d) enhances
  trafficking of effector T-cells by upregulation of CXCR3 and its ligands CXCL9,
  CXCL10 to the non-irradiated tumor, (e) improves expression of IFNγ, TNFα, GzmB
  and T-bet, leading to infiltration of effector T-cells and effective elimination
  of tumor cells in the non-irradiated tumor, (f) decreases the number and immunosuppressive
  function of tumor-associated macrophages, MDSCs and regulatory T-cells, and effectively
  overcomes tumor immunosuppression.'
