caption: CsrB decay is regulated in response to carbon availability through its effect
  on CsrA and CsrD antagonism. The phosphorylation state of the PTS protein EIIAGlc
  serves as an indicator of carbon availability. P-EIIAGlc predominates when a preferred
  carbon source such as glucose is unavailable, and in this form is unable bind to
  CsrD. During glucose transport, EIIAGlc becomes dephosphorylated and able to bind
  to CsrD and potentiate CsrB decay. CsrA binding to CsrB protects it from RNase E
  cleavage in the absence of CsrD-EIIAGlc. A broken line indicates that the molecular
  mechanism of CsrD remains to be determined. RNase E, PNPase and other nucleases
  degrade CsrB to nucleotides (NTDs).
