caption: A proposed biosynthetic pathway for isoliquiritigenin oxidation to hispidol
  and QVE as catalyzed by MtPRX1, MtPRX2, and MtPRX3 enzymes in E. coli cell lysates
  (modified from ). The pathway is initiated with the PRX-catalyzed generation of
  a phenoxy radical (II), and the subsequent steps most likely occur nonenzymatically.
  The additional steps include radical rearrangement (III) followed by oxygenation
  of the α-carbon (IV) and epoxide cyclization with the β-carbon (V). The epoxide
  radical is then utilized for the propagation of an additional substrate radical
  (i.e. conversion of I to II), which initiates a new cycle of the reaction, and it
  is converted to the neutral molecule. The neutral epoxide is then reduced and dehydrated
  to form VIII or the epoxide VII. These products then readily convert to hispidol
  or the QVE. The specific end products observed for each of the M. truncatula PRXs
  are indicated in the final steps.
