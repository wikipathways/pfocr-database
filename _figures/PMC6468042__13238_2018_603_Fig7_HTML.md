caption: A work model for Sox3-Cyp19a1a in ovary development in zebrafish. (A) The
  pathway of 17β-E2 synthesis in ovary. Sox3 binds to the promoter of cyp19a1a and
  up-regulates the cyp19a1a expression, which promotes 17β-E2 synthesis via the two
  pathways, one is that androstenedione is converted to estrone and another is that
  testosterone is converted to 17β-E2. (B) Wild-type juvenile gonads are bipotential
  between 22–28 dpf post fertilization. Cyp19a1a promotes ovary development by up-regulation
  of 17β-E2 synthesis in wild type. In the absence of Sox3, the expression level of
  cyp19a1a is down-regulated, which results in a decrease of 17β-E2, thus leads to
  somatic cell apoptosis in follicles, mostly at early-vitellogenic stage (III) and
  late-vitellogenic stage (IV), and a reduced fecundity
