caption: WNT5A signaling in the embryonic ChP epithelium. Schematic summarizing the
  key aspects of WNT5A signaling in embryonic LV and 4V ChP epithelium. Wnt5a is expressed
  in a region adjacent to both developing ChPs (CH for LV ChP and LRL for 4V ChP)
  with Wnt5a expression being restricted to 4V ChP epithelium and not LV ChP epithelium.
  Meis1 expression is also spatially restricted to the 4V ChP epithelium and not the
  LV ChP. Foxj1 is a marker gene for embryonic ChP epithelium. Epithelial WNT5A, production
  of which is under direct regulatory control of the transcription co-factor MEIS1,
  stimulates in an autocrine manner the transmembrane receptors ROR1 and ROR2. Their
  activation leads to the activation of DVL2 and DVL3. Ultimately, WNT5A signaling
  contributes to the suppression of WNT/canonical signaling, which is re-activated
  upon loss of WNT5A. Key components of the WNT/PCP signaling pathway, namely VANGL2
  and its interacting partner SCRIBBLE also participate in the proper establishment
  of the ChP epithelium.
