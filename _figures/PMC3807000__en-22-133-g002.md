caption: Autophagy-related common pathway in neurodevelopmental disorders. Activation
  of PI3K-Atk signaling suppresses TSC1 and TSC2 complex leading to inactivation of
  Rheb (isoform of Ras superfamily) and release of mTOR from mTORC1 (mTOR complex
  1). Dysfunctions of FMRP as a PIKE (PI3K enhancer) repressor in fragile X syndrome
  and TSC1/TSC2 as an mTOR repressor in tuberous sclerosis produce defects of neuronal
  development and synaptic plasticity with autistic behavioral phenotypes. In autism,
  mutations of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) also
  induce abnormal hyperactivity of PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. Besides mTOR-dependent
  pathway, mTOR-independent pathway such as Epac2-Rap signaling affects neurite formation
  and autism phenotypes. Epac2, autism candidate gene RAPGEF4, is activated by cAMP
  binding and then changes an inactivated form to activated form of Rap which can
  regulate calpain via PLCε pathway. Neurofibromin encoded by NF1 normally leads to
  inactivation of Ras. However, mutations of neurofibromin in Neurofibromatosis 1
  causes overactivation of Ras/ERK and PI3K signaling, leading to inactivation of
  TSC1/TSC2 complex and release of mTOR from Rheb suppression.
