caption: Functions and interactions of CIP2A and the “oncogenic nexus” of CIP2A are
  presented in a schematic representation of the major interacting partners of “oncogenic
  nexus” of CIP2A protein. Oncogene CIP2A is depicted in orange. Other proto-oncogenes,
  oncogenes and oncogenic Transcription Factors (TF) are depicted in red. Tumor suppressors
  genes (PP2A and p53) are depicted in green. Subunits of PP2A are schematically presented
  in different colors. Signaling components of the PI3K-mTOR pathway (AKT and mTOR)
  are depicted in yellow. Functional involvement (post-translational modifications
  etc) via binding of two proteins is shown in blue bidirectional arrows. Remaining
  functions are presented in black unidirectional arrows.
