caption: In the AKI model, β-catenin can be activated and accumulated in cells by
  Wnt agonist and then transferred to the nucleus. With the involvement of CBP and
  LEF/TCF, β-catenin increases the transcription of target genes and finally alleviates
  the early renal function decline and renal structural damage caused by AKI. In the
  CKD-induced fibrosis model, sclerostin, DKK1 or PPAR-α can competitively bind to
  LRP5/6, thereby inhibiting β-catenin and its downstream signaling pathways which
  finally alleviate renal fibrosis. In addition, WIF, Klotho, or sFRP4 can competitively
  bind to Wnt ligands and frizzled receptors, thereby blocking the binding of Wnt
  ligands and frizzled receptors and ultimately inhibiting β-catenin and its downstream
  signaling pathways. Furthermore, ICG-001 competitively binds to CBP, which then
  inhibits β-catenin mediated gene expression.AKI, acute kidney injury; CBP, cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate response-element binding protein; CKD, chronic kidney disease;

  enhancer binding factor; LRP, lipoprotein receptor protein; PPAR-α, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-α; sFRP4, secreted frizzled-related protein 4; TCF, T-cell factor; WIF,
