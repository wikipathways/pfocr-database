caption: Intrinsic pathway. In the resting state, suppressors BCL-2, MCL1, BCL-XL,
  and BCL-W bind to and inhibit effectors and activators, thus preventing downhill
  cascade leading to apoptosis. The site of inhibition of key BCL-2 family inhibitors
  is noted by brackets. In response to stress, sensitizers bind to the suppressors,
  releasing the inhibitory effect of suppressors on effectors and activators. Thus,
  conformational change and oligmerization ensues with subsequent MOMP formation and
  release of cycotochrome C. Cytochrome C and Apaf-1 oligmerize into the apoptosome,
  leading to activation of caspases and, finally, cell death.
