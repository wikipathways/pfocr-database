caption: 'EGFR ligands and signaling pathways activation. A EGFR activation: Seven
  ligands, including EGF, HB-EGF, AREG, TGF-α, epiregulin, EREG, BTC, and EPGN bind
  EGFR, promoting its dimerization and autophosphorylation which activates downstream
  signaling pathways, such as ERK MAPK, PI3K-AKT, SRC, PLC-γ1-PKC, JNK and JAK-STAT.
  These proteins regulate several genes involved in the regulation of different cellular
  process: cell growth, survival, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and
  migration. B, C EGFR trans-activation: G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated
  process leads to EGFR signaling activation by two mechanisms: B Activation of metalloprotease
  group, ADAMs protein that cleave EGFR ligands and release them into the extracellular
  space. These ligands bind EGFR triggering the signaling cascade activation. C Activation
  of intracellular SRC protein tyrosine kinases involved in the phosphorylation of
  EGFR in its cytosolic domain, representing a ligand-independent mechanism. D, E
  EGFR internalization: Upon EGFR activation, it undergoes to two endocytosis mechanism
  due to different EGF concentration. Calcium release from ER helps EGFR internalization.
  D At low EGF level, EGFR is incorporated into clathrin-coated pits and is rapidly
  internalized to endosomes in a complex process named clathrin-mediated endocytosis
  (CME). Then, EGFR is recycled back to the plasma membrane, leading to signal propagation.
  E At high EGF level, EGFR is internalized, ubiquitinated by E3 ligase Cbl and sorted
  to lysosomes for protein degradation through a process named non-clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis (NCE)'
