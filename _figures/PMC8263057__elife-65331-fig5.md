caption: Yeast metabolomics pathway map showing metabolite fold changes following
  40 min treatment with 20 µg/ml cordycepin. Solid circles indicate detected confirmed
  metabolites and dashed circles detected putative metabolites. Coloured circles show
  metabolites with significant fold change after cordycepin treatment with red indicating
  an increase in abundance and blue a decrease in abundance. Darker colour is used
  for metabolites with greater than 50% fold change. Pathways are based on the KEGG
  database and include starch and sucrose metabolism (orange), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  (pink), citrate cycle (TCA cycle) (purple), pentose phosphate pathway (yellow),
  pyrimidine metabolism (green), and purine metabolism (blue). Asterix (*) indicates
  metabolites that appear multiple times on the map. The pharmacological inhibition
  of Imd2 by mycophenolic acid (MPA) is indicated. Data is representative of six biological
  replicates and is available in the .Figure 5—source data 1.Cordycepin metabolomics
  data.IDEOM metabolite list and metadata from HILIC metabolomics study for untreated
  cells and cells treated with cordycepin for 40 min.
