caption: ROS mediates inflammation, mitochondrial damage, and cell death, ultimately
  promoting liver damage. KCs recognize HMGB1, promote the inflammatory response through
  the TRL4-MyD88-NF-κB pathway. At the same time, TNF-α activated by ROS, phosphorylating
  JNK and further producing ROS. Activated TNF-α also form complexes that activate
  caspase 8, leading to mitochondrial permeability transition (MTP) and finally apoptosis.
