caption: Extracellular EGF (red disc) binds to cell surface EGFRs leading to their
  dimerization. Dimerized EGFRs are autophosphorylated and lead to phosphorylation
  of Akt. Active and inactive receptors are removed from the cell surface through
  internalization into endosomes. Asterisk represents phosphorylation and the rate
  constants marked with an asterisk are associated with phosphorylated receptors.
  We only show a subset of all interactions in the model. See  for details of the
  corresponding computational model.
