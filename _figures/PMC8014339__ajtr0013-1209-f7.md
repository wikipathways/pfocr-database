caption: F528 treatment ameliorated smoke-induced inflammation and emphysema through
  NF-κB signaling pathway. Cigarette smoke can induce the inflammation by the phosphorylation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway of macrophages and the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and matrix metallopeptidases, leading to the destruction of the alveolar
  structure and the development of lung emphysema. F528 ameliorates the inflammation
  and emphysema by inhibition of the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway in
  macrophages and attenuates CS-induced recruitment of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and proteinases, such IL-6, TNF-α and MMPs.
