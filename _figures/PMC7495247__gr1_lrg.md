caption: A) Schematic showing how COVID-19 triggers hyper-activation of the immune-response,
  generating a cytokine storm. LTs acting in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner
  could positively regulate and amplify the release and action of inflammatory cytokines,
  which results in a positive feedback loop that further induces LT synthesis and
  the inflammatory process. B) Arachidonic acid metabolism, drugs and key molecular
  targets. The schematic highlights how the use of NSAIDs can shift arachidonic acid
  metabolism towards the 5-LOX and LT biosynthetic pathway. C) Schematic showing the
  shift of arachidonic acid metabolism towards 5-LOX activity after administration
  of NSAIDs.
