caption: Oxylipin biosynthesis pathway and signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana.
  JA biosynthesis initiates in the plastid with release of octadecatrienoic acid or
  hexadecatrienoic acid from membrane lipids by lipases such as DAD1 and DGL. cis-OPDA
  and dn-OPDA are formed following sequential steps catalyzed by 13-LOX, 13-AOS, and
  AOC. cis-OPDA is transported to the peroxisome via the CTS transporter, where after
  reduction by OPR3, OPC-8:0 is formed. This is activated to its CoA ester by OPCL1,
  which then undergoes three rounds of β-oxidation catalyzed by ACX, KAT, and MFP
  to give (+)-7-iso-JA. JAR1 catalyzes formation of the amino acid conjugate JA-Ile
  from JA in the cytosol, which is the active form of the hormone involved in JA signaling.
  JAZ proteins repress expression of JA-responsive genes. In response to JA-Ile, the
  JAZ proteins are targeted by SCFCOI1 for degradation, thus leading to JA-dependent
  gene expression and ultimately the regulation of various physiological processes.
  The model proposes formation of the COI1-JAZ complex in the nucleus. cis-OPDA’s
  regulation of gene expression can be COI1-dependent or COI1 independent, although
  cis-OPDA has not been shown to promote binding of COI1 and JAZ. Enzyme names are
  shown in red. Dashed arrows indicate route to JA biosynthesis via dn-OPDA, where
  these steps are yet to be proven experimentally. DAD1, DEFECTIVE IN ANTHER DEHISCENCE1;
