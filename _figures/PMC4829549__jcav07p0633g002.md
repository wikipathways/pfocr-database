caption: MET signaling pathway. After MET activation, PI3K can bind either to MET
  directly or indirectly with GAB1 and signals through the AKT/protein kinase B axis.
  AKT can inactivate the pro-apoptotic protein BCL-2 antagonist of cell death (BAD)
  and activate the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2, which results in apoptosis suppression
  and cell survival promotion. Moreover, AKT can also activate mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR), which stimulates protein synthesis and cell growth. MET activation
  also signals through the RAS-MAPK pathway. The nucleotide exchanger protein Son
  of Sevenless (SOS) activates RAS by binding with SHC and GRB2 (GRB2-SOS complex).
  This leads to activation of the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (RAF)
  kinases, which subsequently stimulates the MAPK effector kinase (MEK) and results
  in MAPK activation. MAPK phosphorylates ERK, which is the final effector of the
  cascade. The RAS-MAPK pathway is responsible for cell proliferation, cell motility
  and cell cycle progression. A third major downstream axis of MET signaling is the
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. STAT3 can bind
  to MET directly resulting in STAT3 phosphorylation, which regulates cell transformation,
  tubulogenesis and invasion. Finally, the fourth major cascade of MET activation
  is through the IκBα-NF-κB complex. NF-κB is bound to IκBα forming an inactive form.
  The phosphorylation of either PI3K-AKT or SRC activates IκB kinase (IKK) and results
  in degradation of IκBs. NF-κB is then released and translocated to the nucleus to
  stimulate gene transcription.
