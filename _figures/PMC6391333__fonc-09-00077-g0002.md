caption: Model of vitamin E-mediated cell survival in ECM detached cells. Due to loss
  of integrin and PI3K signaling, cell detachment from the ECM results in the reduced
  expression of glucose transporters and low glucose uptake (shown in broken lines
  and gray boxes). This decreases ATP production and cell survival. Moreover, low
  NADPH generation through attenuated PPP flux leads to ROS accumulation which can
  induce cell death. ROS also inhibits fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) an alternative
  ATP generation pathway under glucose limiting conditions. However, treating detached
  cells with exogenous antioxidants like vitamin E neutralizes ROS which activates
  FAO increasing cell survival. Attenuating FAO using etomoxir which inhibits carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase (CPT1), FAO's rate limiting enzyme, abrogates vitamin E's ATP
  rescue ultimately diminishing cell survival.
