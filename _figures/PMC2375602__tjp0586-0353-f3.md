caption: The right side of the figure shows that binding of NPR-C by CNP or cANF activates
  Gi proteins, which inhibit adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity via the α subunit of the
  G protein. This results in a reduction in intracellular cAMP levels and a significant
  inhibition of ICa,L in cardiomyocytes. The left side of the diagram illustrates
  the different signalling pathway activated by NPR-C in cardiac fibroblasts. In fibroblasts,
  the βγ subunits of Gi proteins activate phospholipase C (PLC), which converts PIP2
  to diacylglycerol (DAG) (and IP3; not shown). DAG directly activates members of
  the TRPC subfamily, independently of protein kinase C.
