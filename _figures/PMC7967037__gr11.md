caption: Exosomal miR-155 from M1-polarized macrophages promotes EndoMT and impairs
  mitochondrial function in vascular endothelial cells after SCI. MiR-155 is transferred
  from M1-polarized macrophages to microvascular endothelial cells through exosomes,
  and internalized miR-155 targets and decreases SOCS6 which can ubiquitylate and
  degrade p65 in cytoplasm. The p65 proteasomal degradation is then suppressed and
  p65 nuclear translocation is upregulated, which subsequently promotes EndoMT and
  ROS generation in vascular endothelial cells.
