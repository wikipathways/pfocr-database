caption: Navitoclax, dasatinib and quercetin promote apoptosis through the inhibition
  of pro-survival proteins. During apoptosis, Bax and Bak generate outer mitochondrial
  membrane pores allowing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP) and
  the release of cytochrome-C. Cytochrome-C and apoptotic protease activating factor-1
  (APAF1) form the apoptosome which recruits and activates pro-caspase-9 which in
  turn initiates the caspase cascade which includes caspases 3 and 7. Dasatinib inhibits
  receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as ephrin B and non-receptor tyrosine kinases
  including Src. These tyrosine kinases regulate the pro-survival PI3K-PDK pathway
  and downstream Bcl-2 family protein activity inhibiting Bax and Bak pore formation
  and thereby apoptosis. Similarly, quercetin is an inhibitor of both the PI3K-PDK
  pathway and Bcl-2 proteins, however, quercetin also inhibits PAI, a protein that
  could promote cell survival via the upregulation of Bcl-2 expression and as a result
  of complex formation and inactivation of caspase-3 (Balsara and Ploplis, 2008).
  Navitoclax is a BH3 mimetic target and induces senescent cell apoptosis via inhibition
  of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins allowing MOMP and cytochrome-C release.
