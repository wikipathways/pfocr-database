caption: Molecular defect and phenotype in McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS). The hormones
  MSH (melanocyte stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), TSH (thyroid stimulating
  hormone), GHRH (growth hormone stimulating hormone), and ACTH (adrenocrotical stimulating
  hormone) all signal through the G protein (alpha, beta, gamma subunits) pathway.
  In MAS, the alpha subunit is mutated in such a way as to induce constitutive activation
  of adenylate cyclase, and thus produce high levels of intracellular cAMP. This results
  in increased production of melanin, estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), thyroxine
  (T4), growth hormone (GH), and cortisol. Dysregulated production of these hormones
  results in café-au-lait spots, precocious puberty, fibrous dysplasia, acromegaly,
  hyperthyroidism, and Cushing's disease, depending on the tissue harboring the somatic
  mutation.
