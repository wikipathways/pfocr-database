caption: The lin-4 homolog miR-125a/b represses both Lin28a and Lin28b during stem
  cell differentiation. The core pluripotency transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Nanog
  and Tcf3 can activate Lin28a transcription in ESCs and iPSCs, whereas the growth
  regulator Myc and the inflammation-/stress-responsive NF-κB can transactivate Lin28b.
  A putative steroid hormone-activated nuclear receptor, conserved from C. elegans
  daf-12, might also regulate both Lin28a/b and let-7 expression. Downstream of Lin28a/b,
  the let-7 family represses a network of proto-oncogenes, including the insulin-PI3K-mTOR
  pathway, Ras, Myc, Hmga2, and the Igf2bp’s. At the same time, Lin28a can also directly
  bind to and regulate translation of mRNAs, including Igf2bp’s, Igf2, Hmga1, and
  mRNAs encoding metabolic enzymes, ribosomal peptides, and cell-cycle regulators.
  Together, this broad network of targets allows Lin28 to program both metabolism
  and growth to regulate self-renewal.
