caption: 'Model of regulation of interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in response to
  apoptotic cells (ACs). ACs, through not clearly defined AC-associated molecular
  pattern (ACAMP) interacting with phagocytic receptors, induce IL-10 production by
  macrophages. One of the phagocytic receptors is CD36, the engagement of which by
  ACs induces p38 MAPK phosphorylation and the activation of a yet to be identified
  protein tyrosine kinase (X). Activation of p38 MAPK leads to the assembly of a Hox
  complex, composed of Pbx-1b, Prep-1, and Meis1 as a minimum, on the IL-10 promoter
  via the apoptotic cell response element (ACRE) at −105/−100. Prep-1 tyrosine phosphorylation
  is presumably carried out by the hypothetical kinase X. The Hox complex is the main
  transcriptional factor driving IL-10 expression in response to ACs and it does not
  appear to be variable in human individuals. Two negative regulatory elements (NREs)
  exist: NRE1 at −592 and NRE2 at −1082, which also represent 2 major SNPs in human
  populations. Both NREs interact with PARP-1, which acts as a transcription repressor,
  but the modes of action are different. NRE1 does not bind PARP-1 in resting macrophages
  and the interaction with the 24-kDa cleaved fragment of PARP-1 is induced by ACs
  being ingested by the phagocyte. NRE2 binds the intact, 113-kDa PARP-1 in resting
  cells and the binding is reduced in macrophages in contact with ACs, resulting in
  inhibition of IL-10 transcription. It is possible that the cleavage product of PARP-1
  is actually a transcriptional activator for IL-10, opposing the effect of its precursor.
  This possibility awaits formal confirmation. Both NREs regulate IL-10 transcription
  in an allele-specific manner, resulting in variable levels of IL-10 gene expression
  in different individuals in response to ACs. Note that p38 activation is also inducible
  via the TLR pathway by microbial pathogens, which represents an evolutionarily independent
  route to induce IL-10 production. This pathway leads to the binding of transcription
  factors such as Sp1 to the IL-10 promoter region. Abbreviations: CM, cell membrane;
  NM, nuclear membrane; TATA, TATA box; Y-kinase, tyrosine kinase; ACRE, apoptotic
  cell response element; NRE, negative regulatory element. Solid lines represent proven
  relationship while dashed lines designate hypothetical dependency.'
