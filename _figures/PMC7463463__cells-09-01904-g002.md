caption: 'Targetable vulnerabilities related to serine and 1C metabolism. (A) Metabolic
  pathways linked to serine, glycine, and 1C metabolism are shown. Serine biosynthesis
  requires nitrogen from glutamate and three carbons from the glycolytic intermediate
  G3P. Serine metabolism is directly linked to the folate cycle, which transfers one
  carbon unit between metabolites using THF as a carrier. In the mitochondria, serine
  catabolism produces glycine and 5,10-meTHF in the cytosol 5,10-meTHF is used to
  synthesize serine from glycine. In both compartments, 5,10-meTHF supports dTMP synthesis
  from dUMP, a downstream metabolite of pyrimidine synthesis. In the process 5,10-meTHF
  is converted to the non-carrier DHF, which is converted to THF to re-enter the folate
  cycle. Purine synthesis is also connected to the folate pathway through a one carbon
  transfer from 10-formyl. The most reduced carrier is 5-meTHF, which is derived from
  5,10-meTHF. The oxidation of 5-meTHF to THF biologically functions to regenerate
  Met from HCY in the methionine cycle. This ensures a stable pool of SAM for DNA
  and histone methylation. Through HCY the methionine cycle is connected to the transsulfuration
  pathway, which generates GSH for ROS mitigation. (B,C) Inhibitors targeting enzymes
