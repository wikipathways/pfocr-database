caption: 'PGE-dependent retrograde control of nuclear gene expression. (A) In green
  tissues where chloroplast biogenesis is completed, PEP is responsible for the transcription
  of most plastid-encoded genes (including all PhAPGs: photosynthesis-associated plastid
  genes), while NEP mainly transcribes the rpoB/C1/C2 operon and a few genes containing
  only NEP promoters (e.g. accD, the only plastid-encoded gene involved in fatty acid
  metabolism). Positive regulators such as HY5 and GLKs activate PhANG transcription,
  the resulting mRNAs are translated in the cytosol and the protein products imported
  into chloroplasts through the TOC-TIC apparatus. GUN1 has no function at this stage
  and is rapidly degraded by the Clp protease upon import through the action of the
  chaperone ClpC1 (). Chloroplast-derived redox signals related to PET activity regulate
  cytosolic mRNA stability by promoting the translation of specific mRNAs (e.g. Fed-1),
  thus preventing their ribonucleolytic degradation (). The light green ribosomes
  denote translation of PhAPGs in the chloroplast, the dark green ribosomes represent
  the translation of PhANGs in the cytosol. (B) When PGE is impaired (e.g. upon inhibition
  of translation with Lin), GUN1 interacts with cpHSC70-1, a motor protein of the
  TIC complex, and facilitates import of plastid-targeted proteins to maintain proteostasis
  of the plastid under stressful conditions (and preventing aberrant accumulation
  of preproteins in the cytosol). GUN1 clients (i.e. proteins whose import is GUN1-dependent)
  include proteins involved in various steps of plastid protein metabolism, and several
  enzymes of the TPB pathway (, ). In the absence of GUN1, unimported preproteins
  accumulate in the cytosol, where their presence causes folding stress and triggers
  the accumulation of the cytosolic HSP90/HSP70 chaperone complex, which, in turn,
  derepresses PhANG expression. Thus, HSP90 activity is positively correlated with
  PhANG expression (), and may act by either activating positive or inhibiting negative
  transcriptional regulators in the nucleus. PhANGs and ribosomal proteins were shown
  to be regulated translationally (e.g. RBCS and LHCA4 are translationally repressed
  upon Lin treatment) and/or post-translationally either in a GUN1-dependent or independent
  manner (). GUN1 was also reported to be able to directly bind NEP to promote the
  expression of NEP-dependent genes (), although this possible function is likely
  independent of the gun phenotype of gun1 mutants. The gray ribosomes denote the
  translation of house-keeping genes in the plastid, the dark green ribosomes represent
  the translation of PhANGs in the cytosol.'
