caption: 'Protein-protein interaction networks of lipid metabolism related pathway
  enriched genes. The node size was decided on the basis of the interaction degree
  value of each gene. Triangle node: FPKM < 10 in either the cecum or colon; Circular
  node: 10 ≤ FPKM < 500 in the tissue with the highest expression; Square node: FPKM ≥ 500
  in at least one intestinal tissue. Red: Higher expressed in colon; Blue: Higher
  expressed in cecum; Green: Multiple transcript expression patterns are not consistent.'
