caption: Changes in metabolite levels in ΔaqpZ cells in comparison with the WT grown
  for 48 h under photomixotrophic conditions based on metabolite profiling using GC/TOF-MS.
  A, Venn diagram of annotated metabolites that showed significant interaction effects
  with duration of culture, accumulated glycogen, and cell diameter. The corresponding
  box plots data sets are shown in supplemental Figs. S3–S5. B, diagram depicting
  key steps in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the TCA cycle, and related
  pathways. Increase or decrease of metabolites in the ΔaqpZ mutant compared with
  the wild type is shown as upward or downward arrows, respectively. The data were
  derived from the data set shown in supplemental Fig. S2. 3PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Fru6P, fructose 6-phosphate; Glc6P, glucose 6-phosphate;
  GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid.
