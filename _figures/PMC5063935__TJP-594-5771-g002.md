caption: The gastrointestinal tract has extensive innervation provided by the enteric
  nervous system and by extrinsic fibres from the sympathetic and parasympathetic
  nervous system. A, schematic representation of the intestinal wall with its different
  layers, showing the distribution of the intrinsic and extrinsic innervation and
  their relationship with the intestinal immune cells. Parasympathetic efferent fibres
  innervate the intestinal wall by contacting exclusively the enteric neurons located
  in the myenteric plexus region. Instead, sympathetic efferent fibres are also in
  direct contact with the mucosa and with intestinal immune cells located in the submucosal
  and mucosal compartment. B, in the mucosal villi, several immune cells such as macrophages,
  dendritic cells and T cells are affected by the release of neurotransmitters, such
  as ACh, produced by neuronal fibres. C, in the myenteric plexus, close proximity
  between enteric neurons and resident macrophages has been described in several publications.
  Based on anatomical and functional evidence, it has been hypothesized that secretion
  of ACh by cholinergic enteric neurons influences the phenotype of resident macrophages
  resulting in inhibition of TNF‐α and induction of regulatory T cells.
