caption: A simplified diagram shows our current understanding of the role of insulin
  and curcumin on hepatic lipogenesis. Both insulin and curcumin can repress gluconeogenesis
  via activating the Akt signaling, which inactivates FoxO1 and the hepatic gluconeogenic
  pathway. Curcumin shares with insulin in using the IRS1/PI3K/Akt/TSC1/2/mTORC1 signaling
  cascade in activating SREBP-1c, although we are still unclear whether a yet to be
  defined receptor mediates the function of curcumin (indicated with the question
  mark). Importantly, both insulin and curcumin utilize the newly defined Pak1/MEK/ERK/Oct-1
  signaling cascade in up-regulating ChREBPα transcription, leading to increased hepatic
  lipogenesis. The stimulation of ChREBPβ expression by insulin or curcumin is likely
  mediated by ChREBPα. The existence of possible feedback loop between Pak1 and Akt
  are illustrated with dotted arrows.
