caption: 'Mechanisms of miRNA function in the immune system. miRNAs can have various
  functions within the immune system and can act in different manners. A: For example,
  miR‐146a acts as an anti‐inflammatory miRNA via feedback inhibition of an inflammatory
  pathway. B: miR‐155, on the other hand, is a pro‐inflammatory miRNA that acts in
  a feed‐forward manner bolstering the immune response. C: miR‐181a is also a pro‐inflammatory
  miRNA that acts by inhibiting phosphatases that block the activation of T cell genes
  thus activating T cells. D: Finally, the miR‐17∼92 cluster is involved in promoting
  the differentiation of a subset of inflammatory T cells called T follicular helpers
  cells (TFH).'
