caption: Possible mechanisms through which the gut microbiota could affect the homeostatic
  and hedonic pathways. The homeostatic pathway includes the processing of signals
  from white adipose tissue-derived leptin and GIT-produced peptides, PYY, CCK, GLP-1,
  and ghrelin, directly or through the VN. The hedonic pathway, which includes motivation-
  and reward-driven behavior through dopaminergic signaling, can be stimulated by
  food intake and visual and olfactory stimuli. Although the gut microbiota’s role
  in these pathways is still largely uncertain, several mechanisms have been hypothesized,
  indicated by the red dotted arrows. Altered gut microbiota composition could affect
  plasma leptin concentrations and sensitivity and alter the release of peptides.
  Additionally, microbial dysbiosis can lead to neuroinflammation, which could possibly
  alter both the homeostatic pathway and central dopaminergic signaling. GIT, gastrointestinal
  tract; ARC, arcuate nucleus; NPY, neuropeptide Y; AgRP, agouti-related protein;
  POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin; CART, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript;
  PYY, peptide YY; CCK, cholecystokinin; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1.
