caption: The dysregulation of the VLDL1-TG and apoAI metabolism in obese subjects.
  The plasma triglycerides are determined by the balance between synthesis and removal
  of VLDL1-TG, illustrated by a Synthesis pathway and a Clearance pathway. The Synthesis
  pathway includes liver fat and total fat mass, the two independent predictors of
  VLDL1–triglyceride secretion rate. In the Clearance pathway, plasma concentration
  of the LPL inhibitor apoC-III was tightly linked with plasma TG and catabolism of
  VLDL1-TG. In addition, apo-CIII was closely related to plasma TG concentration (dotted
  arrow). This indirect effect of apoC-III on plasma triglycerides is likely explained
  by effect(s) of apoC-III beyond LPL-independent pathways of triglyceride metabolism
  (Huard et al., ; Sacks et al., ). Increased plasma triglycerides are associated
  with increased HDL catabolism (Pont et al., ; Ooi et al., ; Chan et al., ). Thus,
  increased plasma triglycerides are closely associated with decreased HDL cholest
  erol (Verges et al., ). Figure modified from Borén et al. (). **p < 0.01; ***p <
  0.001.
