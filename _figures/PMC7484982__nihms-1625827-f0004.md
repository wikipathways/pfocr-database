caption: The early steps of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway occur in the ER,
  where acyl-CoAs and amino acids combine to form the dihydroceramides and ceramides
  that are scaffolds for complex sphingolipids. These lipids then move to the Golgi
  apparatus, where additional modifications produce the majority of species comprising
  the cellular sphingolipidome. A subset of studies suggests that some of the early
  biosynthetic steps may occur in mitochondria, though this remains and active area
  of investigation and debate. SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; KDHR, 3-ketodihydrosphingosine
  reductase; CERS ceramide synthase; DES, dihydroceramide desaturase; SMS, sphingomyelin
  synthase; GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; N-SMase, neutral sphingomyelinase; ETC,
  electron transport chain; MOMP, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.
