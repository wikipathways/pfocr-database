caption: Elav1 pathway for mRNA stabilization. Entities are colored according to the
  expression scales when the HF/SD group is compared with the HF/RD group. The key
  elements in the pathway that are upregulated in HF/SL are shaded in yellowish-green
  tones, according to the expression scale. Yellowish tones indicate positive fold
  changes and bluish tones refer to negative fold-changes.
