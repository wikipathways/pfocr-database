caption: Inter-individual mRNA expression variances in the transforming growth factor-beta
  (TGF-β) signaling pathway in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with normal control
  (NC). The graph shows genes affected by significant intra-group inter-individual
  mRNA expression variances in RA compared with NC (P ≤ 0.05; Bonferroni/Holm corrected
  Brown-Forsythe version of the Levene test; labeled in red) in the Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) TGF-β signaling pathway. Among the three TGF-β family
  sub-pathways, the classical TGF-β sub-pathway is significantly affected by gene
  expression variances (P ≤ 0.15, χ2 test; indicated in red). TGF-β-regulated cellular
  processes with potential influence on or relevance for RA pathogenesis (for example,
  angiogenesis and cell survival) are labeled in blue.
