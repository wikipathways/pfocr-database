caption: 'Inflammation-driven lymphomagenesis in coeliac disease (CD). (A) Left panel:
  in active CD, cytokines produced by gluten-specific CD4+ T cells cooperate with
  interleukin (IL)-15 to stimulate the expansion and cytotoxic activation of polyclonal
  CD8+ T intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) that drive a cytolytic attack of epithelium.
  Middle panel: in type 2 refractory CD (RCD2), innate-like T IEL that have acquired
  somatic mutations and notably gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in Janus kinase 1
  (JAK1) or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) can clonally
  expand and outcompete CD8+ T IEL in the cytokine-rich CD intestine. Transformation
  is fostered by the acquisition of additional mutations, notably in TNFAIP/A20, which
  enhances the nuclear factor kappa B pathway, and in epigenetic regulators. Due to
  their natural killer (NK)-like functions, RCD2 IEL can induce severe epithelial
  lesions. Right panel: further accumulation of mutations in the clonally expanded
  RCD2 IEL ultimately lead to enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL). While
  EATL generally develops from RCD2, it can also develop without a prior step of RCD2.
  (B) Schematic representation of the JAK1-STAT3 pathway. Its activation both by cytokines
  produced by CD4+ T cells and IL-15 explains its importance in the activation of
  normal CD8+ T IEL and RCD2 IEL. Created with Biorender.com.'
