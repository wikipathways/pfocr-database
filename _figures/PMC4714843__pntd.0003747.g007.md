caption: Transcriptome array and Real Time-PCR genes mapping to significantly enriched
  pathways and interactions groups show a highly connected and overlapping structure.
  Enriched KEGG pathways (TGF-β signaling, Jak-STAT signaling, Cytokine-cytokine receptor
  interaction and Chagas disease) share multiple genes between them as well as with
  the AP1 transcriptional factor network. Gene nodes are sectioned into three slices
  to denote significant expression changes at the 60, 90 and 120 minute time points.
  Pie slices in red denote a greater than two-fold up regulation, slices in green
  denote less than a negative two-fold down regulation.
