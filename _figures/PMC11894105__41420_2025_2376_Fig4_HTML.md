caption: In canonical pathway, when a pathogen invades the host cell, ASC, NLRP3 and
  caspase 1 recruitment are triggered to form inflammasome, in which caspase 1 is
  activated. Activated caspase 1 directly cleaves GSDMD and the precursor cytokines
  pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, induces pyroptosis, and promotes the maturation of IL-1β
  and IL-18. Lysed GSDMD-NTs form pores in the cell membrane that mediate the release
  of cytoplasmic contents. The non-canonical pathway refers to caspase 4 or caspase
  5 in human cells or caspase 11 in mouse cells that recognize LPS, and these inflammatory
  caspases directly cleave GSDMD and trigger pyroptosis
