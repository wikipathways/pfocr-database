caption: Examples of canonical and non-canonical estrogen receptor (ER) signaling
  pathways. The two major nuclear forms of ER are ERα and ERβ. Via the classical direct
  genomic pathway estrogen-bound ERs dimerize, change confirmation, are shuttled to
  the nucleus, bind estrogen response elements (ERE) on the DNA, and recruit coactivators
  and that promote transcription (denoted by arrow 1). Most regulatory screening in
  vitro ER assays for EDC activity probe only this mechanism of estrogen signaling.
  Non-classical genomic signaling (denoted by arrow 2) is also possible via binding
  with transcription factors (TF) like AP-1 and others to promote transcription through
  transcription factor response elements (TFRF). ER transcriptional activity can also
  be activated by kinases via their receptors and is thus estrogen-independent. Finally,
  GPER and membrane ERs (mER) including membrane forms of ERα and ERβ confer many
  of the rapid effects of estrogen and influence transcription and other cell processes,
  including ion channel activity, via kinases and other intracellular signaling cascades.
  This diagram is by no means exhaustive and illustrates that there are myriad ways
  EDCs can act as ER agonists or antagonists, some of which are just beginning to
  be elucidated. (E2 = estradiol; EGFR = epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK = extracellular
  signal-related kinases; IGFR = insulin-like growth factor receptor; MAPK = mitogen
  activated protein kinase; NFKB = nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; P13K = phosphoinositide 3-kinase)
