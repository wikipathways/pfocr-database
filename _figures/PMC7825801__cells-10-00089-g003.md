caption: 'Overview of fatty acid metabolism. (A) Fatty acid synthesis pathway. Upper
  panel: the processing of malonyl-CoA by multifunctional domains of FASN. Sequential
  molecules and key enzymes are described in a schematic diagram. ACC, acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; FASN, fatty acid synthase; FASN domains: MAT, malonyl-CoA transferase;
  KAS, ketoacyl synthase; KAR, ketoacyl reductase; HTD2, hydroxyacyl-thioester reductase
  type 2; ETR, enoyl-thioester reductase; TE, thioesterase. (B) Fatty acid oxidation
  pathway. Cpt1A (Carnitine Palmitoyl transferase 1A) catalyzes the rate-limiting
  step in fatty acid oxidation. Sequential molecules and key enzymes are described
  in the bottom schematic diagram. ACAD, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; ECH, enoyl-CoA hydratase;
  HADH, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase.'
