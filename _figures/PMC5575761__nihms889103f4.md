caption: In the tumor microenvironment, T cells that are capable of recognizing tumor
  neoantigens produce interferon-γ, which can induce the expression of PD-1 ligands
  on cancer cells and immune cell types, including macrophages, stromal cells, and
  dendritic cells, which become myeloid suppressor cells. The expression of PD-1 ligands
  on cancer cells is also mediated by cell-intrinsic mechanisms that are activated
  by oncogenic events, which result in altered activation of signaling pathways and
  altered gene-expression programs through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms.
  The term pMHC denotes peptide plus MHC (i.e., MHC of either class I or class II).
