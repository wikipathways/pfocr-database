caption: Multiple miRNAs are up- or down-regulated in response to various chemo drugs
  and induce chemo resistance by targeting different components of the Hippo pathway
  (MST1, SAV1, LATS2, MOB1, YAP) in various cancer types. Anti-microtubule treatment
  activates CDK1, which phosphorylates and promotes LATS binding to and inhibition
  of Pin1, an oncoprotein that induces taxane resistance in multiple malignancies.
  Furthermore, CDK1 directly phosphorylates and inhibits YAP/TAZ by disrupting their
  binding to TEADs and destabilizing TAZ, sensitizing tumor cells to anti-microtubule
  drugs. The transcriptional activity of YAP is further modulated by CBP/p300-mediated
  acetylation and SIRT1-mediated deacetylation in response to various chemo agents.
  YAP/TAZ induce the transcription of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, IAP1, Survivin.)
  and ABC multi-drug transporters to promote tumor cell survival and drug efflux,
  respectively. In addition, CTGF and CYR61, two canonical transcription targets of
  YAP/TAZ, can act through integrin receptors to activate MAPK and NF-κB signaling
  to further boost chemotherapy resistance.
