caption: The computed catalytic cycle (top) and reaction coordinate diagram (bottom).
  The pathway that leads to the major product is a concerted asynchronous (2+2) aldol-lactonization
  process while all minor products undergo a spiro-lactonization mechanism that traps
  the forming enolate with the catalyst iminium. Previously postulated pathway, involving
  the formation of the zwitterionic aldol adduct, does not exist on this potential
  energy surface.
