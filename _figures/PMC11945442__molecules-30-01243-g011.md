caption: Proposed mechanism by which ACA affects the TNF-α-induced NF-κB pathway and
  ICAM-1 expression. Upon binding to TNF-α, TNF-R1 recruits TRADD, RIPK1, and TRAF2,
  which are required for the activation of NF-κB. NF-κB translocates to the nucleus
  and promotes the transcription of ICAM-1 as one of its target genes. ICAM-1 mRNA
  is then used to synthesize its translated product, which is transported to the cell
  surface. As an initial step in TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression, ACA downregulates
  TRAF2 expression through proteasome-dependent degradation. Luciferase reporter and
  quantitative PCR assays suggest that ACA inhibits the transcriptional process of
  NF-κB in addition to its effects on TRAF2
