caption: Aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells. (A) Warburg effect. Cancer cells exhibit
  a preference for metabolizing glucose to break down pyruvate, even when oxygen is
  plentiful; a large amount of pyruvate is converted to lactate, that is, aerobic
  glycolysis; a minimal fraction of pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria
  for catabolic processes that result in the formation of CO2. Through the course
  of aerobic glycolysis, 4 mol of ATP is generated from the consumption of 1 mol of
  glucose. (B) Diagram of aerobic glycolysis signaling pathway in tumor cells. Aerobic
  glycolysis in tumor cells promotes high levels of HIF‐1 expression and activates
  multiple pro‐oncogenic signaling pathways; the activation of these signaling pathways
  upregulates the transcription levels of the pivotal glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase
  2, and lactate dehydrogenase A, which in turn promote aerobic glycolysis in tumor
  cells. This figure is drawn by the Figdraw online platform, thanks to Figdraw (https://www.figdraw.
