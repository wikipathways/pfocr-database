caption: Schematic diagram depicting the effects and mechanisms of TPH-1 against renal
  fibrosis and the regulation of PAA on TPH-1 expression. TPH-1 was decreased during
  renal fibrosis, while PAA treatment significantly inhibited renal fibrosis through
  promoting TPH-1 expression. Pharmacological overexpression of TPH-1 by PAA treatment
  ameliorated renal fibrosis through modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  by acting on the protein stability of β-catenin and β-catenin-mediated transcription.
  TPH-1 was required for PAA to exert anti-fibrosis.PAA, poricoic acid A; TPH-1, tryptophan
  hydroxylase-1.

  via modulating protein stability of β-catenin and β-catenin-mediated transcription.
