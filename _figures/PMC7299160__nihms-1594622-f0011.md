caption: Schematic of the signaling pathway interactions in apoptosis, necroptosis
  and ferroptosis. Programmed cell death pathways are not independent pathways but
  are connected at many levels. This scheme demonstrates how the pathways are related
  and why blocking only one pathway may not be adequate to mitigate radiation damage.
