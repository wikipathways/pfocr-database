caption: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 integrate upstream environmental information
  to gate their own activation. Because mTORC1 controls cellular entry into an anabolic
  state that requires copious amounts of energy and macromolecules, activation of
  the complex should only occur when amino acids, insulin/growth factors, ATP and
  oxygen are all readily available. To ensure that all of these requirements are satisfied,
  mTORC1 must translocate to the lysosome by anchoring onto the Rag GTPases, which
  are only competent to recruit mTORC1 in the presence of amino acids. Once localized
  to the lysosomal surface, mTORC1 can be then be activated by the small GTPase Rheb
  in its GTP-bound state. Importantly, GTP loading of Rheb is promoted by growth factors
  and opposed by energetic stress or hypoxia. All of these inputs converge on tuberous
  sclerosis complex (TSC), which acts as a GAP for Rheb. mTORC2 is thought to be primarily
  regulated by growth factors. Although it is not clear where mTORC2 activation occurs,
  the pleckstrin homology domain on MAPK-interacting protein 1 (mSIN1) may recruit
  mTORC2 to the plasma membrane. Positive regulators of the mTORC1 pathway are shown
  in green, while negative regulators of mTORC1 are shown in blue. AMPK, AMP-activated
