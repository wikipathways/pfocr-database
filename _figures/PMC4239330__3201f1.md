caption: 'Reconstitution of the T-cell compartment after UCBT. Conditioning chemoradiation
  prior to UCBT results in profound lymphopenia and immunodeficiency of the host.
  T-cell reconstitution after UCBT is achieved by 2 independent mechanisms: the thymus-independent
  pathway of T-cell reconstitution predominates in the early posttransplant period
  and is mediated by adoptively transferred UCB T cells, which are uniformly naive
  and do not transfer protective immune memory, or recipient T cells that survive
  conditioning. These T-cell populations undergo peripheral expansion in response
  to lymphopenia and high cytokine levels (IL-7, IL-15, etc), or oligoclonal proliferation
  upon interaction with cognate antigen. Overtime, this early peripheral T-cell expansion
  results in late effector memory T-cell skewing and contraction of the T-cell repertoire
  diversity, and is associated with impaired immunologic responses to antigens. Reconstitution
  of a functionally competent T-cell compartment with broad antigenic specificity
  eventually requires the de novo production of naive T cells by the thymus of the
  UCBT recipient. This thymus-dependent pathway of T-cell reconstitution is a prolonged
  multistep process. LMPs contained in the UCB graft or arising from the engrafted
  donor-derived HSCs migrate via circulation and repopulate the thymus with thymocyte
  precursors that can reconstitute thymopoiesis. The thymus provides the essential
  microenvironment (stroma) that supports T-cell proliferation, selection, and differentiation
  into RTEs. Several factors can delay the recovery of thymopoiesis after UCBT, including
  low number of LMPs (as a result of low nucleated cell dose of UCB and delayed engraftment),
  advanced recipient age with resultant thymic involution and thymic damage from the
  conditioning chemoradiation or GVHD. Although slow, the thymus-dependent mechanism
  is imperative for the renewal of peripheral T-cell pool and constant export of new
  naive T cells with broad TCR repertoire diversity, capable of responding to a great
  spectrum of antigens.'
