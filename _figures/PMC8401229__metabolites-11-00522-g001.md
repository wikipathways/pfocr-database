caption: 'The preventive mechanisms for acetyl-CoA accumulation in the mitochondria
  through the acetylation of taurine and carnitine. An excess accumulation of mitochondrial
  acetyl-CoA metabolized from fatty acid and acetate would cause the metabolic stagnation
  of the glycolytic pathway as negative feedback through allosteric inhibition of
  PDH. To prevent the accumulation of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, taurine and carnitine
  play buffering roles on the acetyl moiety of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA. Consequently,
  ACT and NAT are produced from fatty acids and acetate, respectively, and then excreted
  to extracellular fluids. Abbreviations: ACT; acetylcarnitine, ACS; acyl-CoA synthetase,
  ACS2; acetyl-CoA synthetase 2, CACT; carnitine acylcarnitine translocase, CPT; carnitine
  palmitoyl transferase, CrAT; carnitine acetyltransferase, CT; carnitine, GLUT4;
  glucose transporter 4, MCT; monocarboxylate transporter, NAT; N-acetyltaurine, OCTN2;
  organic anion transporter 2, PDH; pyruvate dehydrogenase.'
