caption: 'Gene selection in the TGFß signaling pathway. Schematic representation of
  genes examined in the TGFß signaling pathway. The SMAD mediators can be divided
  into two main intracellular pathways: SMAD2/3 or SMAD1/5. Members of the TGFß family
  (TGFB1/2/3) bind TGFBR2, Type 2 receptor, a specific serine/threonine receptor kinase
  which catalyzes the phosphorylation of Type 1 receptor, TGFBR1, activating the protein.
  TGFß Type 3 receptor, TGFBR3, may enhance the binding of TGFß ligands to TGFBR2
  by binding TGFβ and presenting it to TGFBR2. Activated type I receptors phosphorylate
  specific receptor regulated R-SMADs, the intracellular effectors of TGFß signaling,
  either SMAD2/3 or SMAD 1/5. Activated R-SMADs form heteromeric complexes with SMAD4
  that translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate the expression of target genes
  in conjunction with transcription factors. Inhibitory SMADs, SMAD6 and SMAD7, antagonize
  TGFß signaling by inhibiting activation of R-SMADs. We examined twelve genes (TGFB2,
  TGFB3, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, TGFBR3, SMAD1, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4, SMAD5, SMAD6, SAMD7)
  in the TGFß signaling pathway to examine for association with risk of SCA. TGFB1
  was not included since the only variant on the platform did not meet our criteria
  for a common variant (allele frequency of <0.05) and thus was not analyzed.'
