caption: The formation of the autophagosome depends on the initiation and/or nucleation
  of a specific membrane structure known as the phagophore, and on the elongation
  and closure of the phagophore to form a double-membrane-bound vacuole. The biogenesis
  of autophagosomes requires the ordered intervention of autophagy-regulated (ATG)
  proteins that act on different modules. Some of these modules are shown on the figure,
  including the UNC51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complexes,
  ATG12 (the ATG12–ATG5 complex) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain
  3 (LC3; for example, the LC3–phosphatidylethanolamine conjugates); ATG4B is a protein
  that is involved in the regulation of LC3 lipidation and delipidation. The ULK1
  complex is composed of ULK1 (the mammalian orthologue of yeast Atg1) and RB1-inducible
  coiled-coil 1 (RB1CC1; also known as FIP200; the mammalian orthologue of yeast Atg13,
  Atg17 and Atg101). The PI3K complex is composed of beclin 1 (the mammalian orthologue
  of yeast Atg6 and Atg14), class III PI3K (PIK3C3), PIK3R4 (PI3K regulatory subunit
  4) and AMBRA1 (activating molecule in BECN1-regulated autophagy protein 1). Both
  complexes congregate at the phagophore assembly site to initiate autophagy in response
  to nutrient starvation. The kinase activity of ULK1 is controlled by the kinase
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which is sensitive
  to rapamycin. The protein ATG14 appears to have a key role in the targeting of the
  PI3K complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). How the ULK1 and PI3K complexes
  are coordinately regulated remains to be elucidated. The production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate
  (PtdIns3P) by human PIK3C3 recruits the PtdIns3P-binding proteins ATG18 (also known
  as WIPI1 and WIPI2) and double FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (DFPC1). Cargos
  can be incorporated into autophagosomes in a non-selective manner (known as bulk
  autophagy) or in a selective manner (known as selective autophagy). Maturation occurs
  when the autophagosome fuses with the endolysosomal compartment. The final degradation
  of cargos occurs in autolysosomes. The activity of the class III PI3K complex can
  be manipulated by both activators (such as BH3 (BCL-2 homology 3) mimetics) and
  inhibitors (such as spautin-1; specific and potent autophagy inhibitor 1). PIK3C3,
  which is a component of the class III PI3K complex, is a potential target for drugs.
  Some other potential targets are also indicated on the figure. Autophagosome closure
  can be inhibited by reducing ATG4B activity. Compounds that interfere with LC3-interacting
  region (LIR) motifs could potentially block the selective recruitment of cargos
  such as mitochondria, viruses and bacteria. Inhibitors of lysosomal enzymes (such
  as cystatin B), and lysosomotropic agents that increase the lysosomal pH (such as
  chloroquine and hydrochloroquine) block the degradative activity of autolysosomes.

  sequestosome 1).
