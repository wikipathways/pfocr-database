caption: After initial infection of oropharyngeal epithelial cells (a) EBV primarily
  infects naïve B-cells (b) and subsequently the infected B-cells are growth transformed
  (latency III), expressing the full repertoire of latent antigens (c). EBNA-1 tethers
  viral episome to host chromosome and assists viral replication and segregation (d).
  EBNA-1 blocks the interaction between p53 and HAUSP and induces its degradation
  (e). EBNA-2 regulates a wide range of both viral (f) and cellular (g) gene transcription
  via RBP-Jκ. EBNA-LP promotes EBNA-2 mediated gene transcription (h). EBNA-3 proteins
  (-3A, -3B and -3C) by blocking EBNA-2 association with RBP-Jκ modulate viral gene
  transcription as well as Notch signaling pathway (i). EBNA-3C forms a ternary complex
  with p53 and Mdm2, recruits the Mdm2 E3 ligase activity to ease its degradation
  and blocks p53-dependent apoptosis (j). EBNA-3C binds to and enhances the kinase
  activity of both Cyclin D1/CDK6 (k) and Cyclin A/CDK2 (l) complexes to phosphorylate
  pRb. In addition, EBNA-3C recruits SCFSkp2 E3 ligase activity on hyperphophorylated
  pRb (m) and p27KIP1(n) for degradation, thereby facilitating the transition of G1
  to S phase. LMP-1 inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis by transactivating bcl-2 and A20
  genes (o). LMP-1 augments NF-κB signaling to transactivate numerous cellular genes
  via interaction with tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFR)-associated factors (TRAFs)
  and TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD) (p). LMP-1 also modulates JAK/STAT,
  ERK MAPK, IRF and Wnt signaling pathways (q). LMP-2A blocks B-cell receptor (BCR)
  signaling through interaction with cellular tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk (r). LMP-2B
  regulates LMP-2A function (s). EBERs block apoptosis, bind to La and L22 cellular
  proteins and induce IL-10 cytokine and type I IFN (t). The biological function of
  BARTs is under investigation as to their role in development of B-cell lymphoma
  (u).
