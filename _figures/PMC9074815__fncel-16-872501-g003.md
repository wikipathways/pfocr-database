caption: Peripheral nerve injury induces the activation of nested transcription factor
  networks. Axonal injury leads to the unregulated flow of ions at the breach resulting
  in a propagating wave of depolarization and the opening of voltage gated Ca2+ channels.
  The rise in Ca2+ is further potentiated by Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release from internal
  stores (not shown). Ca2+ then activates adenylyl cyclase leading to a dramatic increase
  in cAMP production. This rise in cAMP promotes axon regeneration through two pathways,
  one initiated by PKA and the other through activation of IL-6. PKA leads to the
  activation of transcription factor hubs AP1 and CREB while the IL-6 pathway leads
  to the activation of STAT3. These three transcription factor hubs induce the expression
  of other regeneration associated genes (RAGs) including ATF3, another transcription
  factor hub crucial to the early injury and regeneration response.
