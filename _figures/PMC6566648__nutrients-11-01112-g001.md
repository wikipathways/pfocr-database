caption: Scheme of the mechanisms involved in the rise of blood pressure in low calcium
  intake by an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. Low calcium intake decreases
  plasmatic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]plasma), stimulating the release of parathyroid
  hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hypertensive factor (PHF), the synthesis of calcitriol,
  and the activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). In vascular
  smooth muscle cells (VSMC), angiotensin II via the angiotensin II type I receptor
  (AT1R)/Gq/phospholipase C (PLC)/inositol trisphosphate (IP3) pathway, PTH via PTHr-1/Gs/3′,5′-cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA), and calcitriol via adenylate
  cyclase (AC)/cAMP/PKA and PLC/IP3 signaling pathways increased the intracellular
  calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The rise of [Ca2+]i leads to vasoconstriction,
  and hence increases in peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure. The PHF
  mechanism of action remains unknown. See text for further details.
