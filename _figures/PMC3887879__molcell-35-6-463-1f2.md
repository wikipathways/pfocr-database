caption: Amino acid signaling to mTORC1. The key mechanisms by which amino acids activate
  mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface are depicted. Under amino acid deficiency, the inactive
  state of the v-ATPase-Ragulator complex is unable to activate Rag GTPases on the
  lysosomal surface, thus mTORC1 cannot be recruited to the lysosome. In addition,
  LRS is inactive due to low level of leucine. Under amino acid sufficiency, the v-ATPase-Ragulator
  complex is activated through a lysosomal ‘inside-out’ mechanism, which in turn promotes
  the GTP-charging of RagA/B via a GEF function of the Ragulator. Activated Rags then
  recruit mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where mTORC1 can be activated by Rheb by
  integrating amino acid signals with other upstream signals converging on the Rheb
  GTPase. Under conditions of leucine availability, activated LRS signals to the Rags
  through the cytoplasmic face of the lysosome.
