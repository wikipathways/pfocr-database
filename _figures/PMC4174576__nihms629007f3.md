caption: Site of action of autophagy enhancer drugs. The normal secretory pathway
  traversed by wild-type α1-antitrypsin (AT) is shown at the bottom and then at the
  far right edge of the figure. α1-Antitrypsin Z (ATZ) aggregates (yellow) being degraded
  by autophagy are shown in the middle. ATZ monomers being degraded by the ubiquitin
  (Ub)-dependent proteasomal pathway are shown on the left. Carbamazepine enhances
  both proteasomal degradation and autophagic degradation. Based on the current data,
  other autophagy enhancers, including fluphenazine, pimozide, and rilmenidine, enhance
  autophagic degradation. Proautophagy peptide Tat-beclin-1 binds to GAPR-1 (Golgi-associated
  plant pathogenesis–related protein 1, which is a Golgi-associated autophagy inhibitor)
  and releases beclin-1 from Golgi, thereby increasing free beclin-1 in the cytoplasm
  to induce autophagy.
