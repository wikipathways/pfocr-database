caption: Tryptophan Metabolism along the kynurenine pathway. a The kynurenine pathway
  within the periphery and brain under healthy conditions. Proper enzyme regulation
  results in a healthy balance of TRP and TRP metabolites. As a result, adequate levels
  of TRP are available for 5-HT synthesis and properly regulated SERT proteins ensure
  that extra-cellular concentrations of 5-HT are not depleted. Healthy levels of TRP
  metabolites within the brain (e.g., QUIN) ensure normal activation of NMDA receptors
  thereby maintaining healthy hippocampal function and proper regulation of the HPA
  axis. b The kynurenine pathway within the periphery and brain in a state of chronic
  inflammation. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines cause upregulation of
  enzymes such as IDO thereby resulting in an increased breakdown of TRP and production
  of TRP metabolites. As a result, reduced levels of TRP are available for the synthesis
  of 5-HT. Pro-inflammatory cytokines also upregulate SERT proteins causing further
  depletion of extra-cellular 5-HT. Elevated levels of TRP metabolites within the
  brain such as QUIN (potent NMDA agonist) result in over-activation of NMDA receptors,
  neuronal damage, and potential atrophy. This may also lead to a loss of inhibition
  of the HPA axis and excessive production of stress hormones
