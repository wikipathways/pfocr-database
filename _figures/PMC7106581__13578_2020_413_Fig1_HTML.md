caption: Schematic representation of the the main physiological activities mediated
  by Fndc5/Irisin through MAP-kinase signaling pathways. The variety of cell differentiation
  and physiological activities of Fndc5/irisin and the MAPK pathways they elicit are
  depicted. As shown, through this signaling pathway, irisin is not only responsible
  for neural cells and osteocytes differentiation but also triggers glucose uptake
  by the muscles and browning of WAT
