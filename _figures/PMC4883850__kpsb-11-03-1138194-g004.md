caption: The proposed model of nitrogen metabolic rearrangement under salt stress.
  The downregulation of P-II nitrogen sensing protein under salt stress would increase
  nitrite uptake and nitrogen metabolism. The decreasing of ribosome subunits L10a,
  P1a, S2 and S18 under salt stress would limit the protein synthesis, and most of
  the accumulated amino acids would be used as compatible solute rather than component
  of protein. On the other hand, the salt stress would limit the degradation of protein
  by decreasing 19S regulatory particle subunits Rpt4 and Rpn9, and necessary protein
  level could be maintained during most of the amino acids were used as the compatible
  solute. In the diagram, green indicates the proteins that were downregulated, real
  line indicates the enhanced pathway, and broken lines indicate the weaken pathway.
