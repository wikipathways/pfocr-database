caption: Inflammasome sensors have diverse roles in tumorigenesis. The NLRP1b, NLRP3
  and NLRP6 inflammasomes facilitate the production of IL-18, which helps protect
  against colorectal cancer associated with colitis. IL-18 also triggers the anticancer
  activity of natural killer cells against metastatic colonic tumor cells, reduces
  the levels of IL-22BP and may prevent the establishment of colitis-inducing microbiota,
  potentially through its impact on MUC2 secretion by goblet cells. The NLRP3 inflammasome,
  along with the IL-1β/IL-1 receptor signaling pathway, drives a T-cell response against
  transplantable tumor cells. In mice, NAIP1-6 proteins regulate STAT3 phosphorylation
  and the transcription of genes involved in anti-apoptotic and cell proliferation
  mechanisms. NLRC4 inhibits melanoma growth by enhancing macrophage inflammation
  and increasing IFNγ production in T cells. AIM2 suppresses AKT and cMyc phosphorylation,
  limiting stem cell proliferation and preventing colonization by colitis-promoting
  microbiota (83). AIM2, absent in melanoma 2; IL-22BP, IL-22 binding protein; MUC2,
