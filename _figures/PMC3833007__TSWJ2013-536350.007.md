caption: Hypothetical schematic signaling pathway of SCRT-induced membrane depolarizations
  on ICCs. SCRT-induced membrane depolarization seems to be mediated by 5-HT3 and/or
  5-HT4 receptor, coupled to G protein, resulting in the activation of PLC pathway,
  which subsequently increases the intracellular Ca2+ level from SR. The data also
  suggest that MAPKs are involved in the SCRT-induced membrane depolarizations.
