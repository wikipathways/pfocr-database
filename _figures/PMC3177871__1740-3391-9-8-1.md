caption: The metabolic pathway converting serotonin to melatonin involves the enzymes
  AANAT and ASMT (previously known as HIOMT). Although AANAT has been believed to
  control the rate-limiting step, recent studies [] imply an effect of ASMT upon the
  metabolic conversion of serotonin to melatonin. The activity of both AANAT and ASMT
  might influence the concentration of N-acetylserotonin, which influences expression
  of TRKB (a BDNF receptor).
