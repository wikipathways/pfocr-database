caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of oestrogen action in cardiac cells, such as endothelial
  cells. Oestrogens can bind and activate the ERs, thereby inducing intracellular
  signalling cascades. Additionally, oestrogens influence other signalling pathways
  in the heart: oestrogens activate (i) the PI3K/Akt pathway, (ii) the Gq-coupled
  receptors, which results in the production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and the
  subsequent triggering of intracellular Ca2+ release and NO production, and (iii)
  the PKC/MAPK signal transduction pathways. All these signalling pathways are triggered
  at the level of the plasma membrane and activate intracellular cascades that converge
  to cytosolic targets and transcription factors and cofactors modulating gene expression.
  Finally, oestrogens can bind to mitochondria-specific receptors, through an increase
  in nuclear transcription of the nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs). MEK, mitogen-activated
  extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; RAF, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
