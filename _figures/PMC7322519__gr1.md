caption: 'Schematic diagram of 5-HTR mediated signalling pathways: Activation of 5-HT1AR
  initiates several pathways including Gαi/o-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-EPAC/PKA and Ras,
  Raf-ERK signalling pathways. When cAMP binds to the subunits of PKA, they phosphorylate
  downstream proteins to regulate key cellular processes. As a result, it increases
  the gene transcription involved in the development of long-term memory which is
  regulated by CREB. Furthermore, it alters the NMDA, AMPA and GABA receptor-mediated
  currents and also plays an active part in modulation of voltage-gated Na+, K+ and
  Ca+2 ion channels. Additionally, 5-HT1R activates Akt via PI-3K-PDK pathways. It
  is a key protein kinase and also regulates phosphor-Ser9-GSK3β. Similarly, activation
  of 5-HT2R initiates PLC-DAG-PDK-PKC/IP3-ERCa+2-PKC pathways. Importantly, the activated
  form of PKC also regulates phosphor-Ser9-GSK3β. Also, 5-HT2R affects β-Arrestin-Akt-PP2A
  signalling pathway. 5-HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine; SERT: serotonin reuptake transporter;
  Gαi/o, Gαs, Gαq: isoforms of the α subunits of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR);
  AC: adenylyl cyclase; cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate; EPAC: exchange proteins
  activated by cAMP; PKA: protein kinase A; CREB: cAMP response element-binding protein;
  Raf: rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase; ERK: extracellular signal regulated
  kinase; PI-3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinases; PDK1: phosphoinositide-dependent kinase1;
