caption: Tentative model of H-1PV cytotoxicity. After parvovirus infection, expression
  of NS1 triggers an oxidative stress with accumulation of intracellular ROS associated
  with DNA damage. As a consequence of DNA damage, cells accumulate in G2 phase and
  then undergo apoptosis and ultimately lysis. NS1 may also induce DNA damage by directly
  nicking DNA, thereby contributing to the cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, ROS may
  also be produced during the execution of the apoptotic pathway, reinforcing the
  cytotoxic activity of the virus.
