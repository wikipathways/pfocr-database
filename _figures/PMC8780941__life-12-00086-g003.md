caption: 'Proposed metabolome view with significant pathways according to the pathway
  enrichment analysis. The meaning of compound colors within the pathways is as follows:
  grey means those metabolites are not detected as significantly different in our
  data and are used as background for enrichment analysis; red means that the metabolites
  are in the data with significantly higher levels in early-onset severe preeclampsia
  compared to controls. KEGG database (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/kegg1.html, accessed
  on 11 August 2021) was the source of the proposed metabolic pathways.'
