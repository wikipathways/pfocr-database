caption: 'A. Increased activity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Left: BET inhibition
  and normal PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. The binding of ligands, such as growth factors,
  hormones, or cytokines, to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activates PI3K. PI3K
  coverts PIP2 to PIP3, and PTEN counteracts PI3K by dephosphorylating PIP3. PIP3
  mediates the phosphorylation, and thus activation, of AKT which leads to the activation
  of mTOR. mTOR signaling normally drives critical cellular process including cell
  growth, translation, and proliferation, but BETi suppress expression of the genes
  responsible for these processes. Right: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway can remain active
  if PTEN is mutated, preventing it from converting PIP3 to PIP2, or if PI3K has an
  activating mutation. Both mutations increase phosphorylation of PIP3, maintaining
  activity of AKT and mTOR and overcoming BETi-mediated suppression of gene expression.
  B. Increased phosphorylation of BRD4. Left: BRD4 is phosphorylated by CK2 and dephosphorylated
  by PP2A. When BETi (blue circle) binds to BRD4, it prevents localization of BRD4
  to the chromatin. BRD4 can thus no longer recruit Mediator to the DNA, silencing
  target gene expression. Right: Reduced PP2A activity increases the abundance of
  phosphorylated BRD4 (pBRD4). Despite the binding of BETi to its BRD regions, pBRD4
  can still localize to the chromatin and interact with Mediator, maintaining transcription
  of target genes.'
