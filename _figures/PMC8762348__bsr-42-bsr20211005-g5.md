caption: Under oxidative stress environment, mitochondrial function was impaired and
  excessive ROS production occurred, which further incurred damage to the mitochondria,
  leading to stress-induced apoptosis. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to
  a decrease in NAD+ levels, which inhibits mitochondrial energy synthesis and Sirt3-mediated
  deacetylation of related proteins. Overexpression of NMNAT3 increases NAD+ remedial
  synthesis, promotes Sirt3-mediated deacetylation of mitochondria-related proteins,
  and increases mitochondrial energy synthesis and activation of antioxidant enzymes.
  Finally, it can improve the function of mitochondria and eliminate excessive ROS
  production, thereby inhibiting cellular stress-induced apoptosis.
