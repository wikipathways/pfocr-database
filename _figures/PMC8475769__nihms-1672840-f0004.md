caption: Schematic depicting the pathways of 3 circRNAs, circRNA_100367, circPITX1,
  circTUBD1, in modulating radiation response. circRNA_100367 sponges miR-217, which
  prevents miR-217 from targeting the Wnt pathway resulting in increased radioresistance.
  By silencing circPITX1, its target miR-329-3p can target Nek2 and results in increased
  radiosensitivity. By silencing circTUBD1, which is upregulated after irradiation,
  its target miR-146a-5p can target TRL4, which leads to increased apoptosis and decreased
  pro-inflammatory cytokines.
