caption: Metabolites, metabolic pathways and related metabolic genes that take part
  in necrosis and necroptosis. Glucose starvation promotes necrosis through the transcription
  factor ATF4. In addition, it can act on p53, which regulates necroptosis by affecting
  the interaction between TRINGS and STRAP. Glucose deprivation also facilitates necroptosis
  by promoting the binding of mitochondrial DNA and ZBP1 to regulate MLKL, a key substance
  in the development of necroptosis. DHA supplementation with docetaxel (TXT) promotes
  necroptosis. As one of the key components of the necrosome that promotes the onset
  of necroptosis, MLKL function can be facilitated by GLTP. Very long chain saturated
  fatty acids participate in necroptosis by targeting MLKL. DMF promotes necroptosis
  by promoting the depletion of GSH, ROS generation and MAPK activation. The red boxes
  represent negative regulators and the green boxes represent positive regulators
