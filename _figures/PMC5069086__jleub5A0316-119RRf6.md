caption: HCV up-regulated ΔNp63 inhibits miR-181a expression, which, in turn, increases
  Sirt1 and DUSP6 expression in CD4+ T cells during chronic HCV infection. This 2
  signaling pathways may regulate T cell senescence in different subsets of lymphocytes
  or at different stage of viral infection, facilitating the establishment and/or
  maintenance of viral persistence. Therefore, reconstitution of miR-181a and/or silencing
  ΔNp63, Sirt1, or DUSP6 may provide a novel approach to regulating T cell responses
  in virally infected individuals.
