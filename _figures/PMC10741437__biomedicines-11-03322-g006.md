caption: PI3K and its downstream signaling proteins. In unstimulated cells, the p110
  catalytic subunit of PI3K is stabilized by dimerization with the regulatory p85
  subunit. Upon activation, the p85 subunit becomes phosphorylated and releases p110,
  which leads to the production of PIP3 and the activation of the signaling kinases
  AKT and PDK1. AKT and PDK1 induce a cascade of downstream phosphorylation. Farnesol
  inhibits the phosphorylation of different members of the PI3K signaling pathway
