caption: Synthetic pathway converts IPP to 3-methyl-3-butenol, 3-methyl-2-butenol,
  and 3-methylbutanol. IPP is produced by coexpression of the mevalonate pathway genes
  (atoB, hmgS, hmgR, mk, pmk, and pmd) in E. coli. Three different reactions convert
  IPP into three different C5 alcohols. Reaction 1 catalyzes the isomerization of
  IPP to DMAPP. Reaction 2 catalyzes the dephosphorylation of IPP into 3-methyl-3-butenol
  and DMAPP into 3-methyl-2-butenol. Reaction 3 catalyzes the reduction of 3-methyl-2-butenol
  to 3-methylbutanol. The synthetic pathway competes with native pathways in E. coli
  that also use IPP and DMAPP as substrates, such as those for quinone and cell membrane
  synthesis (in red).
