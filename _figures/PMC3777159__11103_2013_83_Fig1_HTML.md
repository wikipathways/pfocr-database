caption: Simplified representation of flowering-time regulation adapted from Amasino
  () and Fornara et al. (). The FLC-SVP complex represses FT in the leaf and SOC1
  in the meristem and is regulated by FRI, vernalization, and the components of the
  autonomous pathway (e.g., LD). In short days FT expression remains low, whereas
  in long days FT is upregulated by CO and FT protein moves via the phloem (dashed
  line) from the leaf to the shoot apical meristem where it directly upregulates SOC1
  and AP1. SOC1 upregulates AGL24 and LFY. LFY and AP1 are responsible for the production
  of floral meristems and are repressed by TFL1
papertitle: The floral transition is not the developmental switch that confers competence
  for the Arabidopsis age-related resistance response to Pseudomonas syringae pv.
  tomato.
