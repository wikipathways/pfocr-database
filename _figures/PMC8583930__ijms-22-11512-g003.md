caption: The role of metabolites in exercise-mediated WAT browning. Exercise increases
  BHIBA levels in the liver and skeletal muscle. BHIBA mediates the browning of WAT
  through the mTOR signaling pathway or elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio. Exercise induces
  skeletal muscle to produce lactate. Lactate binds to receptor GRP81 on adipocytes,
  which promotes the phosphorylation of P38, leading to the increased expression of
  PGC-1α and PPARγ. This process ultimately increases Ucp1 expression. Exercise increases
  the level of succinate. Oxidation of succinate can increase the mtROS level and
  enhance the activity of Ucp1. Exercise promotes KYNA release in skeletal muscle,
  which binds to and activates Gpr35 on adipocytes. This process also leads to WAT
  browning.
