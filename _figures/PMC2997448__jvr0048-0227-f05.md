caption: Schematic depicting the effects of ligand-induced RAGE signaling (e.g. by
  S100A11) and sRAGE on Pi-mediated artery calcification in wild-type and Enpp1–/–
  mice. This model depicts the amplification loop by which the effects of RAGE and
  RAGE ligands such as S100A11 increase the capacity of the wild-type artery to calcify,
  in a Pi-mediated manner, and the Pi-mediated calcification pathway is known to be
  regulated by the sodium-dependent Pi co-transporter Pit-1 (which is induced by S100A11).
  The Pi-mediated calcification pathway in the artery is markedly enhanced by ENPP1
  knockout-associated PPi deficiency, in which a secondary deficiency of sRAGE compounds
  the diathesis for artery calcification, since sRAGE normally inhibits the capacity
  of RAGE ligands to stimulate artery calcification.
