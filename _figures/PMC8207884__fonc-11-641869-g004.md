caption: Comparison of somatic alterations between LNM subgroups in signaling pathway
  level. Mutation frequencies of genes in (A) TP53 pathway, (B) RTK-RAS pathway, (C)
  cell cycle pathway, (D) NRF2 pathway and (E) PI3K pathway were labeled with LNM
  negative on the left and LNM positive on the right. Oncogenes were filled with red
  color and tumor suppressor genes were filled with blue.
