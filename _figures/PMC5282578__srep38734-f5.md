caption: Schematic representation of the proposed model of regulation of flp-19::GFP
  expression in BAG neurons. The GCY-9 receptor binds CO2 converting GTP into cGMP.
  cGMP triggers opening of the cyclic nucleotide-gated TAX-2/TAX-4 cation channels,
  allowing Ca2+ to enter the neuron, leading to regulation of an unknown transcription
  factor (TF A) that positively regulates the expression of flp-19::GFP. PDE-1 reduces
  the levels of cGMP, opposing the action of GCY-9. In parallel, CRH-1 regulates the
  expression of flp-19::GFP by a signaling pathway involving the cAMP-dependent protein
  kinase KIN-2.
