caption: 'Canonical and noncanonical pathways of inflammasome activation.Notes: (A)
  Canonical inflammasome activation (canonical pathway). (i) Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
  is detected by TLR4, (ii) initiating the NF-κB signaling pathway. (iii) This upregulates
  transcription of the inactive precursor pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and pro-caspase-11.
  (iv) A second inflammatory signal (eg, a pathogen- [PAMP] or danger-associated molecular
  pattern [DAMP] is detected, (v) triggering the formation of the molecular complex
  – the inflammasome. (vi) This initiates cleavage and activation of pro-caspase-1,
  pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18, (vii) allowing secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 from the cell.
  (B) Non-canonical inflammasome activation (non-canonical pathway). (i) When LPS
  is present in abundance or is contained within vacuoles, it is able to enter the
  intracellular environment independent of TLR4. (ii) GBPs promote vacuolar lysis,
  causing entry of LPS into the cytosol of the cell. (iii) Pro-caspase-11 detects
  cytosolic LPS, (iv) initiating the formation of the inflammasome, as well as (v)
  pyroptosis of the cell. (vi) Formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome also leads to the
  release of cytokines by similar mechanisms to the canonical pathway.Abbreviations:
  ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain;
  NLRP3, The NOD-like receptor pyrin-domain containing 3; TLR4, Toll-like receptor
  4; IL, interleukin; GBPs, guanylate-binding proteins.'
