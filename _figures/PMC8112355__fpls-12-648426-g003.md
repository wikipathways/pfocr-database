caption: 'Ab initio inference of the mozukulin pathway in the Ectocarpale alga Cladosiphon
  okamuranus. In yellow: reactions identical to the late sterol side-chain reductase
  (SSR) biosynthesis pathway. In blue: new variant from the Δ24-reduction, distinct
  from those present in the early or late sterol biosynthesis pathways. In brown:
  reactions variants coming either from other pathways (bacterial steroid degradation
  or brassinosteroid synthesis) or even more distant type of molecular transformation,
  previously defined as “type hIIc homologies” ().'
