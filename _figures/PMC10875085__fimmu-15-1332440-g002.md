caption: Schematic diagram of mechanisms for E protein-induced lung injury. (A) E
  protein forms ion-channeling viroporins for cations and activates NLRP3 inflammasome
  in alveolar macrophages, leading to caspase 1 activation and elevated levels of
  Il-1β and IL-18. IL-1β and IL-18 are the sources of cytokine storm. They also trigger
  apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells, resulting in barrier
  dysfunction and edema. (B) E protein binds with proteins associated with tight junctions
  such as zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and PALS-1, leading to barrier dysfunction in epithelial
  and endothelial cells. (C) E protein binds with TLR2 and activates NF-κB and MAPK
  through activation of the IRAK/TAK1 pathway, resulting in cytokine storm
