caption: Metabolites are linked to fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial/peroxisomal
  function. A) The figure represents the pathway in which Fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial
  function, and urea cycle are involved (,  the direction of change comparing Tg2576
  versus WT mice). Double arrows indicate the involvement of other intermediates in
  the pathway. B) The hAPP695SW transgene is linked to increased FA oxidation, as
  indicated by consistently less medium-chain and long-chain fatty acyl carnitines
  (obtained from the mass spectrum) in Tg2576 mice.
