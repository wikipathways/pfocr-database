caption: 'TGFβ induces tumor-suppressive effects that cancer cells must circumvent
  in order to develop into malignancies. Cancer cells can take two alternative paths
  to this end: (1) decapitate the pathway with receptor-inactivating mutations or
  (2) selectively amputate the tumor-suppressive arm of the pathway. The latter path
  allows cancer cells to extract additional benefits by co-opting the TGFβ response
  for protumorigenic purposes. In both cases, cancer cells can use TGFβ to modulate
  the microenvironment to avert immune surveillance or to induce the production of
  protumorigenic cytokines.'
