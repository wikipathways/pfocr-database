caption: 'A. Mechanisms of Hepatic Steatosis. The fatty acids necessary for triglyceride
  synthesis in the liver come from three sources: (1) dietary carbohydrate (CHO),
  which reaches the liver from the intestine and is converted to fatty acid via de
  novo lipogenesis; (2) dietary fat, which reaches the liver from the intestine; and
  (3) fatty acids released from adipose tissue, which reach the liver through the
  circulation. De novo lipogenesis is emphasized in the schematic because this pathway
  is disproportionately up-regulated in persons with NASH [, ]. Inflammatory signals
  from adipose tissue are important regulators of hepatic steatosis: TNF and CCL2,
  which are induced during obesity, stimulate fat accumulation in hepatocytes, whereas
  adiponectin, through its down-regulation in obesity, permits fat to accumulation
  in “ectopic” organs such as liver. Finally, the genetic background of the host plays
  an important role in the predisposition to and severity of steatosis. Persons inheriting
  the I148M polymorphism in the PNPLA3 gene (adiponutrin) are at increased risk of
  steatosis.B. Mechanisms of Liver Injury in NASH. Liver injury in NASH involves cell
  death, inflammation and fibrosis. The major events leading to cell death are (a)
  lipotoxicity, resulting from intracellular accumulation of saturated fatty acids,
  cholesterol, or other toxic lipids; and (b) oxidative injury, which is the result
  of ROS production by dysfunctional mitochondria or overactive CYP2E1. Once hepatocytes
  die they release danger signals, which activate Kupffer cells and HSC resulting
  in inflammation and fibrosis, respectively; TLRs and the inflammasome are important
  mediators of these processes. Activated Kupffer cells secrete IL-1 and TNF. These
  cytokines act on hepatocytes by accentuating steatosis and promoting further cytotoxicity
  [, , , ]. They can also stimulate hepatic fibrosis by promoting HSC survival [].
  In addition, activated Kupffer cells release chemokines that recruit inflammatory
  macrophages, continuing the inflammatory cycle []. Notably, adipose tissue and the
  intestine continue to be important to the liver as hepatic steatosis progresses
  to NASH. Adipocyte-derived fatty acids can activate TLRs and inflammasomes in hepatocytes,
  Kupffer cells and stellate cells; adipose tissue-derived cytokines can enhance hepatocyte
  steatosis, accentuate hepatocyte death, and contribute to the inflammatory and fibrotic
  milieu of the liver. The intestine is a source of bacterial endotoxin, which also
  signals through TLRs on liver cells promoting a pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic state.
  New data implicate gut bacteria-derived IL-17 as an important mediator of NASH [].'
