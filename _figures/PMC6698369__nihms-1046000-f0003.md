caption: Toll signaling is antiviral in some instances such as Nora virus, flock house
  virus, and cricket paralysis virus infections. The mechanism for detecting viral
  infection is unclear, but spatzle is likely cleaved to engage Toll receptor signaling.
  Although the Toll signaling pathway has been studied in the context of embryonic
  development and bacterial and fungal infections, published work has only begun to
  probe the roles of downstream mediators during viral infection. How Toll signaling
  promotes an antiviral response is unclear.
