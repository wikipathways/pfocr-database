caption: '(A). Ubiquitylation processes. Ubiquitylation is a multi-step process that
  involves three enzymes: E1 (Ub-activating enzyme), E2 (Ub-conjugating enzyme) and
  E3 (Ub-ligase). Initially, Ub is linked to E1 through a high energy thioester bond.
  After, Ub activated by E1 is conjugated to a sulfhydryl group on E2 enzyme. Finally,
  E3 ligase specifically catalyzes the transfer of Ub from E2 to a Lys residue on
  a substrate protein. The formation of a poly-ubiquitin (poly-Ub) chain can lead
  the substrate toward a degradative or regulative pathway. (B). Deubiquitylation
  and DUBs function. Ubiquitylation can be reversed by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs)
  that hydrolyze the isopeptide or peptide bond, leading to Ub deconjugation from
  the ubiquitylated protein. DUBs have many functions. 1. Precursor processing: Ub
  is encoded by four genes and translated as a linear fusion protein consisting of
  multiple Ub copies, which require the cleavage by DUBs in order to generate free
  single Ub; 2. Rescue from degradation: DUBs can rescue protein from proteasomal
  or lysosome degradation; 3. Recycling: DUBs maintain Ub homeostasis preventing its
  degradation following substrate proteolysis; 4. Removal of non-degradative events:
  DUBs can remove Ub chains from substrates that are not committed to degradation;
  5. Editing: DUBs can also affect the fate of ubiquitylated substrates by cleaving
  inter-Ub chains (switching from degradative to non-degradative ubiquitylation).'
