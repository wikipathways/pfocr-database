caption: (A) Heat map and DEGs expression profiles of genes associated with phenylpropanoid
  biosynthetic pathway, (B) heat map showing the different expression profiles of
  genes involved in the terpene biosynthesis pathway. Adapted from Zulak and Bohmanu,
  Liu et al. DEGs with an adjusted p value (padj) < 0.05 were differentially expressed.
