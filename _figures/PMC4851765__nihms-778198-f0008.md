caption: (i) FTase farnesylates cytosolic Ras proteins (lower right). This mediates
  their association with the ER membrane where further processing of the CAAX box
  occurs. Farnesylated Ras then traffics to the Golgi (lower left) where it is palmitoylated
  by a Golgi-associated PAT (ii) and the dually modified protein (dark blue) proceeds
  to the PM via the secretory pathway. At the PM Ras can be activated by guanine nucleotide
  exchange factors (GEFs; (iii)); the active GTP-bound form (green) functions as a
  signaling molecule (orange arrow) until it is inactivated by GTPase activating proteins
  (GAPs; (iv)). PM-localized Ras may also be depalmitoylated by a PPT (v), leading
  to its dissociation from the PM. It then diffuses and samples various cellular membranes,
  rejoining the cycle at the Golgi where its membrane localization is stabilized by
  palmitate addition.
