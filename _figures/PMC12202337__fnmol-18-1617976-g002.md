caption: Schematic of ERK signaling pathway that regulate Schwann cell myelination.
  Schwann cell myelination is a process strongly dependent on instructive signals
  provided by the axons. The major axonal signals include type III NRG1, which signal
  via erbB receptors. Following NGF binding to tropomyosin, receptor kinase activates
  Ras. The MEK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induces their nuclear translocation,
  enabling ERK1/2 to potentially phosphorylate and/or stabilize transcription factors
  and proteins that then alter gene expression. MEK, the kinase directly upstream
  of ERK1/2 induce the phosphorylation of YY1. YY1 drive peripheral myelination transcription,
  such as Krox20. ERK1/2 phosphorylation can upregulate Krox-24 expression. The phosphatase
  Shp2, which activates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, is necessary for Schwann cell
  differentiation and myelination. In addition, MEK/ERK can collaborate with soluble
  Nrg1 type II (GGF) to offer extra inhibitory signals for myelination. During the
  myelination process, basal levels of ERK activity are necessary for differentiation
  of precursors while high levels of ERK activity negatively regulate Schwann cell
  differentiation and myelination
