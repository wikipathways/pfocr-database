caption: Alterations of RBC glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and glutathione
  and one-carbon metabolism in isochronic and heterochronic parabiotic mice. Dots
  represent distinct biological replicates for isochronic young (Y)–young (red) or
  old (O)–old (green), or heterochronic Y–O mice with blood being drawn from the young
  mouse (blue) or the old mouse (light blue). * cross-talk between glutathione homeostasis
  and glyoxylate pathway. ** cross-talk between methionine and one-carbon metabolism.
