caption: Schematic diagram depicting failed efferocytosis mechanisms during aging.
  (A) Efferocytic receptors like MerTK or TIMD4 on young healthy macrophages interact
  with phosphatidyl serine on apoptotic cells to promote efficient clearance. SPMs
  promote efferocytosis and MerTK signaling in a feed forward manner which stimulates
  the synthesis of SPMs. In response to apoptotic cell ingestion, the pro-inflammatory
  p38 MAPK pathway is inhibited and macrophages prevent the production of pro-inflammatory
  programs. (B) In the context of aging, MerTK is cleaved by released factors from
  senescent cells (i.e. factors from the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
  or SASP) which limits apoptotic cell uptake and the feed-forward pro-resolution
  circuit. TIMD4 expression is also significantly decreased on macrophages from aging
  humans which drives the activation of p38 to propagate inflammation.
