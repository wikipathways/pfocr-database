caption: Model illustrating the RstA-mediated regulatory pathway that controls Fur
  activity in Salmonella enterica. When activated under iron-replete conditions by
  unknown signal(s), the RstA protein binds to the feoA promoter to activate transcription
  of the feoAB operon encoding the Fe(II) transporter FeoB. The RstA-promoted FeoB
  expression imports additional Fe(II), elevating the active Fur [i.e., Fur-Fe(II)]
  levels, which in turn represses further transcription of Fur-repressed genes encoding
  other Fe(II)/Fe(III) transporters and proteins involved in iron assimilation.
