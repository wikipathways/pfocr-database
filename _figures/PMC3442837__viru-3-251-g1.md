caption: Figure 1. Regulation of filamentous growth in C. albicans by multiple environmental
  cues and signal transduction pathways. The external inducers may function on the
  cell surface receptors or enter into the cell and directly bind the filamentous
  growth regulators. The transcription factors Flo8, Efg1 and Cph1 play a central
  role in the regulation of phenotypic transitions. Multiple signaling pathways converge
  on the three regulators. The cAMP/PKA pathway and its downstream regulators Flo8
  and Efg1 can also play a negative role in filamentous development under embedded
  growth conditions. The general transcriptional repressor Tup1 is recruited by DNA-binding
  proteins Nrg1 and Rfg1 and targets on the promoters of hypha-specific genes.
