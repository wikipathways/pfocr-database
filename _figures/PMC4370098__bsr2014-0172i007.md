caption: 'Upon HRG binding, ErbB3/4 receptors form hetero- or homo-dimers with other
  members of the ErbB family RTKs. Dimerization and transphosphorylation result in
  activation of two major signalling pathways: MAPK/ERK and PI3K. MAPK/ERK pathway
  activation promotes cell proliferation [,], whereas the PI3K pathway, often activated
  in breast cancer, was described as an anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathway [–].
  In the present study we demonstrate that the PI3K–mTOR axis also mediates phenotypic
  changes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells associated with massive production and accumulation
  of lipids. Akt activated downstream to the PI3K is a crucial element in mediating
  phenotypic changes; it activates ACLY that produces acetyl-CoA and mTORC1, crucial
  for lipids synthesis in these cells. Overall, ErbB receptors activation, leading
  to cell survival, proliferation and metabolic changes, contributes to tumour development
  and progression.'
