caption: Plastids play a central role in the generation of wounding and herbivory
  induced signals. After wounding and herbivory, several different cellular events
  take place at the plasmamembrane [e.g., increased ROS production, changes in ion
  fluxes and plasmamembrane potential, recognition of insect elicitors (e.g., FACs)].
  The perception of pathogen elicitors by specific membrane receptors also activates
  some of these cellular processes. These events lead to the activation of downstream
  components in the cytosol (arrow 1) that transduce the primary stress signals to
  activate enzymes located in the plastid (arrow 2). Changes in ion fluxes between
  the cytosol and the tonoplast may also influence the activity of plastidial enzymes
  (arrow 3). The plastid reacts to these stimuli by activating the synthesis of fatty
  acid-derived signals (e.g., oxylipins and structural fatty acids), SA, and isoprenoid
  volatiles that regulate direct and indirect defense responses (dashed arrows). FAC,
  fatty-acid amino-acid conjugate; FAS, fatty acid synthase; ACP, acyl carrier protein;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; GLA, glycerolipase A; LOX, lipoxygenase; AOS, allene
  oxide synthase; AOC, allene oxide cyclase; HPL, hydroperoxide lyase; SKP, shikimate
  pathway; ICS, isochorismate synthase; BA, benzoic acid (* formation of BA requires
  one cycle of β-oxidation that most likely takes place in the peroxisome); G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; DXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate;
