caption: Mechanisms of Curcumin in the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The
  mechanism of AD by affecting oxidative stress with Curcumin (CU). Curcumin reduces
  the AB and the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins in the brain. In neuronal cells,
  curcumin increases the activity of the SOD enzyme to reduce mitochondrial dysfunction
  caused by oxidative stress. Meanwhile, CU improved the phosphorylation process of
  the AKT/p38 MAPK pathway to reverse neuronal apoptosis caused by oxidative stress
