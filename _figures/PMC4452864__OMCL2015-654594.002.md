caption: TGF-β and ROS interplay. TGF-β is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein.
  The signal peptide (SP), which leads the TGF-β precursor protein through its secretory
  pathway, is cleaved during the transit through the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER),
  this way forming a protein homodimer. Its cleavage by furin convertase produces
  the small latent complex (SLC) in which mature TGF-β remains noncovalently bound
  to latency-associated peptide (LAP). Next, SLC by covalent binding to latent TGF-β
  binding protein (LTBP) produces the large latent complex (LLC). Finally, LLC is
  secreted and stored in the extracellular matrix for subsequent activation. The increased
  levels of ROS induce the release and bioavailability of TGF-β from the LLC through
  the oxidative modification of LAP. Active TGF-β by binding to its cell surface receptors
  induces the activation of downstream pathways, which further regulate ROS production
  by both NOX activation and increased NOX expression or by downregulation of antioxidative
  proteins expression. In addition, increased ROS production may directly induce TGF-β
  expression.
