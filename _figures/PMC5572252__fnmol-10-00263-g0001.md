caption: 'Cross-talk between autophagy and other pathogenic mechanisms in amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis (ALS) (A) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein
  response (UPR) is triggered by mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1), TAR
  DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma (FUS). Accumulation of misfolded
  mutant proteins activates either one or all three UPR pathways—protein kinase RNA-like
  endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling
  1 (ERN1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Each of the pathways stimulate
  autophagy through downstream activators. ERN1 activates autophagy through three
  pathways—(i) the AMPK pathway phosphorylates and activates two proteins—ULK1 and
  tuberous sclerosis protein 1/2 (TSC1/2)—both of which inhibit mammalian target of
  rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) which leads to initiation of autophagy; (ii) ERN1 activates
  mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8), which uses its kinase activity to phosphorylate
  B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) which is in a complex with Beclin-1 (BECN1). This phosphorylation
  disrupts the complex and releases BECN1, which in turn activates autophagy through
  mTORC1 inhibition; (iii) ERN1 also acts an endoribonuclease to splice XBP1. The
  spliced version of XBP1 (XBP1s) promotes expression of BECN1. The UPR activator
  ATF6 activates the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPB)
  that promotes expression of the kinase death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1).
  DAPK1 phosphorylates BECN1 and thus breaks it from its complex with BCL2. The free
  BECN1 now activates autophagy through mTORC1 inhibition. The third UPR activator,
  PERK, activates the expression of two stress response genes—activating transcription
  factor 4 (ATF4) and DNA damage inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3). These genes promote
  the transcription of autophagy-related genes (ATGs) that activate the process. (B)
  Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are complimentary mechanisms that
  are triggered by mutations in optineurin (mOPTN), TDP-43, SQSTM1/p62, SOD1 and C9orf72
  GGGGCC expansion. Mitochondrial dysfunction is the primary source of reactive oxygen
  and reactive nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) that are directly implicated in activating
  autophagy. An alternative mechanism is through the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1 (KEAP1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathways. Oxidative
  stress KEAP1-NRF2 complex is disrupted. This leaves NRF2 free to translocate to
  the nucleus where it induces the expression of several autophagy-related genes.
  Autophagy also acts to clear damaged mitochondria through an organelle-specific
  mechanism called mitophagy. (C) RNA metabolism defect is a major pathological outcome
  of mutations in RNA-binding proteins, especially FUS and TDP-43. These proteins
  are major components of stress granules and mutations in low complexity domains
  of these proteins alter the phase of stress granules to give them a complex liquid
  state. This alters the dynamics of stress granules, in that, they are not cleared
  and potentially act as primers for protein aggregates. Autophagy is a crucial mechanism
  involved in the clearance of stress granules under normal conditions and dysfunction
  in autophagy could be linked to altered stress granule dynamics. (D) DNA damage,
  either caused as a direct result of pathogenic mutation or triggered by oxidative
  stress, is a common pathological feature of mutations in FUS and C9orf72 GGGGCC
  expansion. DNA damage activates autophagy through activation of AMPK pathway. The
  AMPK pathway phosphorylates and activates two proteins, ULK1 and TSC1/2, both of
  which independently act as mTORC1 inhibitors. DNA damage activates the AMPK pathways
  through: (i) Hyperactivation of PARP1, which leads to a depletion of NAD+ reserves
  in the cell. This, in turn, depletes ATP and thus activates AMPK; or (ii) FOXOa3
  dissociation from DNA that allows it to interact with ATM. Activation of ATM by
  phosphorylation leads to downstream activation of AMPK pathway. Alternatively, FOXOa3
  also acts as a transcription factor that regulates expression of autophagy-related
  genes.'
