caption: Cellular and signaling pathway view of gene expression changes during alcohol
  withdrawal. (A) Network layout of processes and molecules of interest. The 145 genes
  measured are represented as light gray squares and are grouped according to functional
  class. Relative positioning is maintained as in . (B) ΔΔCT values were superimposed
  on the map presented in (A) with the color and size scale presented for all 86 genes
  found to have a statistically significant treatment effect by ANOVA regardless of
  whether the post-hoc testing revealed significant changes at that time point. Small
  black points are included for positioning and represent the genes that do not undergo
  significant changes (NS). All ΔΔCT values were calculated relative to the mean expression
  in sacrifice-time matched control animals. Values of 1 and -1 represent a doubling
  and a halving of mRNA levels, respectively. The heavy black arrow indicates the
  progression of alcohol withdrawal from the chronic state through 48 hours of withdrawal
  at each of the 5 measured time points. Size changes are proportional to the absolute
  value of the changes. Positive values (red) indicate an increase in expression as
  compared to control animals whereas negative values (blue) indicate a decrease.
