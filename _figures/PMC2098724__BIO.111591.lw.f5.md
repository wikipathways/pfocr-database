caption: Two-gear dimeric model of Na+,K+-ATPase function. The upper cycle () represents
  the pathway followed at low concentrations of ATP, when only one of the ATP binding
  sites of an α-subunit is occupied. The lower cycle () represents the pathway followed
  at high concentrations of ATP, when both of the ATP binding sites of the (αβ)2 dimer
  are occupied. The arrows indicate the physiological direction of cycling by the
  enzyme.
