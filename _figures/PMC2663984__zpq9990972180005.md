caption: A model for the expanded canonical Wnt/GSK3 signaling pathway. Binding of
  Wnt proteins to receptors triggers canonical (β-catenin and destruction complex
  dependent) or noncanonical (β-catenin and the destruction complex independent) Wnt
  signaling. In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, the stability of β-catenin is
  controlled by destruction complex composed by GSK3, APC, and Axin, etc. In addition
  to β-catenin, the degradation of many different proteins in various functional classes
  is regulated by the destruction complex and Wnt receptor signaling.
