caption: Schematic drawing of the possible signalling events that lead to increased
  root branching in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) plants. In the first stage of colonization,
  fungal exudates induce lateral root (LR) formation through the common Sym pathway
  (Medicago truncatula; ) and/or another as yet unknown pathway (Oryza sativa; ).
  Increased phosphate (Pi) uptake may change the root architecture through different,
  integrated mechanisms and probably plays a central role when colonization is established.
  MicroR399 increases in AM plants (); however, the PHR1–miRNA–PHO2 pathway has not
  been explored to any extent in relation to LR formation. The recently discovered
  Lotus japonicus Meristem and Arbuscular Mycorrhiza Induced (LjMAMI) transcription
  factor could link the AM symbiosis to Pi nutrition and branching (). The increased
  import of sugars into the AM roots and the flux towards the arbusculated cells,
  sustained by C/Pi exchange (high-affinity Monosaccharide Transporter 2, MST2/Pi
  transporter, PT4; ) could also favour LR induction and growth. Arbuscular mycorrhizal
  colonization and the resulting increased Pi tissue content act together with hormone
  homeostasis and signalling. An increased auxin and cytokinin (CK) concentration
  and reduction in strigolactones (SLs) and ethylene (ET) generally have been found
  in both AM and Pi-sufficient plants, in relation to Pi-starved, non-colonized, plants
  (see text). A dominant role for auxin on SL and ET signalling in AM root morphogenesis
  is thus suspected, with CKs probably being involved in the reduction of the root:shoot
  ratio, which generally occurs following AM colonization and high Pi nutrition.
