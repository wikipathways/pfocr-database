caption: 'The pivotal role of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and transforming growth factor
  β (TGFβ) and Wnt signaling pathways in an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  program. Upon loss of E-cadherin expression, β-catenin, which colocalizes with E-cadherin
  at the cytoplasmic membrane, is released and accumulated in the cytoplasm. Under
  normal circumstances, liberated β-catenin is rapidly degraded by proteasomes in
  the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/axin/glycogen-synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) complex.
  However, as in several cases of cancers, APC is not functional or the activity of
  GSK3β is diminished by the activation of Wnt signaling pathway, β-catenin can migrate
  to the nucleus, where it functions as a cofactor for the transcription factor T-cell
  factor (TCF) and potentiates its transcriptional activity in concert with the phosphorylated
  SMAD 2 and 3, triggered by TGFβ signaling, leading to tumor proliferation, EMT,
  migration, and invasion. Similar to β-catenin, p120-catenin can translocate into
  the nucleus, where it binds to the transcriptional repressor Kaiso to deactivate
  this protein, causing the unknown genes to become activated by derepression. GFs:
  growth factors; RTK: receptor tyrosine kinase; TGFβR: TGFβ receptor.'
