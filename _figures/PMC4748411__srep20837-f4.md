caption: 'Differentially expressed genes (P < 0.005 and fold change >1.5) are grouped
  with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify affected pathways and key central regulatory
  genes. (A) Pathway involved in Embryonic development, organ development and organ
  morphology. (B) Pathway involved in Cell cycle and carbohydrate metabolism. Grey
  genes are identified as DE genes in RNA-Seq: 14 and 12 DE genes in the two pathways,
  respectively.'
