caption: 'Molecular basis of Jusvinza’s mechanism of action on neutrophils. Jusvinza
  treatment inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine release and NETosis. Supporting Jusvinza’s
  anti-inflammatory effect, the proteomic profile includes several transcription factors
  (YBX1 and FLI1) and regulator proteins of the heat shock response (HSBP1) and the
  NF κB signaling pathway. The abundance levels of positive regulators of NF-κB signaling
  (LIGHT, MTDH, HMGB1, CDC37, and LRRFIP2) were decreased, while negative regulators
  (APPL2, IKBIP, and ASCC1) were increased in Jusvinza-treated neutrophils. Structural
  components of NETs (histones and HMGB1) were also decreased in response to Jusvinza
  treatment. Furthermore, the peptide could inhibit PAD4 activation dependent on Ca2+/ROS
  and consequently suppress NET release. Additionally, proteins related to lipid metabolic
  pathways (DBI, HELZ2, MBOAT7, and PLIN3) were identified, some of which regulate
  the synthesis of lipid metabolites (LTB4 and PGE2) with immunoregulatory properties.
  Juzvinza treatment also modulates proteins related to neutrophil effector functions,
  such as phagocytosis/endocytosis (CLTA), migration, and priming of neutrophils (HCLS1,
  WIP, and WASP), probably decreasing the over-activation of such cells in chronic
  inflammatory conditions. Proteins are represented as boxes and colored according
  to their expression levels (blue, decreased; red, increased; grey, not identified).
