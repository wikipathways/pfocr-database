caption: Schematic summary of how signal transduction by ET-1 induces CTGF expression.
  ET-1 acts on ETAR to activate the JNK signaling pathway, which in turn initiates
  AP-1 activation and ultimately induces CTGF expression in WI-38 cells. ET-1 stimulated
  the nuclear translocation of HDAC7 to form a transcriptional complex with p300 and
  AP-1, which in turn initiates c-Jun acetylation by p300. ET-1 thus recruits the
  transcriptional complex to CTGF promoter and eventually promotes CTGF production
