caption: 'Model that proposes the form in which physical activity activates the nuclear
  factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)–Keap1 pathway. Under normal conditions,
  Nfr2 is found bound to Keap1 through the DLG and EGTE motifs in the Neh2 domain
  of Nrf2 by the ubiquitin ligase complex Cullin (Cul)3-RING-box protein (Rbx)1 (Cul3).
  This complex ubiquitinizes Nrf2 for its rapid proteosomal degradation. When physical
  exercise is carried out, it increases oxygen absorption, transport, and consumption
  in the entire organism (O2 consumption). In this process, the reactive oxygen species
  (ROS)-producer metabolic pathways are stimulated, increasing oxidative stress (OS).
  The latter induces oxidation of the cysteine residues present in Keap1, favoring
  the conformational change of Keap1; consequently, ubiquitination is impeded and
  Nrf2 dissociates itself from the inhibitor complex. Nrf2 accumulates and translocates
  into the nucleus, and heterodimerizes with musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma proteins
  MAF proteins, bonding in a specific DNA sequence denoted as the antioxidant response
  element (ARE), inducing the expression of the antioxidant genes: (a) phase-II antioxidant
  enzymes; (b) glutathione synthesis; (c) ROS elimination, and d) the synthesis of
  NADPH, among others. In conjunction with these, an increase in cytoprotector cellular
  defenses occurs.'
