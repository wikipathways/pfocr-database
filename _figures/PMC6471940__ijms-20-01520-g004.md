caption: Molecular signaling in cancer. Crosstalk of Notch with other pathways influences
  cellular responses including cancer stem cell self-renewal, proliferation, angiogenesis,
  and EMT. Wnt signaling leads to β-catenin accumulation, which subsequently leads
  to an activation of Notch signaling and target gene transcription. Alternatively,
  aberrant Wnt signaling bypasses β-catenin, ultimately modulating Notch signaling.
  Inflammatory factors lead to an increase in NF-kB, which activates PI3K-Akt signaling
  which in turn triggers p53 ubiquitination and degradation. The expression of HES1
  downregulates PTEN, leading to an increase in PI3K-Akt signaling, ultimately activating
  Notch signaling. Dotted lines indicate Notch pathway regulation. Black arrows illustrate
  activation of the pathway, T-arrows inhibition of the pathway.
