caption: BCR triggering by an antigen induces activation of early kinases, including
  LYN and SYK [], which then transduce the signal to cytoskeletal activators, including
  HS1 protein [, ], and to other early effectors of the signaling response, including
  BTK kinase []. Through the BLNK adaptor, BTK activates PLCγ2, and subsequent downstream
  responses, including calcium signaling (Ca2+), PKC, NFκB and ERK kinase [, ], and
  nuclear transcription factors (TF). The positive co-receptor CD19 contributes to
  the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway and to survival induction []. The signaling
  response ultimately promotes activation of nuclear transcription, including CCL3
  and CCL4 chemokine genes, which are then produced and secreted []. The signaling
  response is tightly modulated by negative coreceptors (e.g. CD22, CD5) and phosphatases,
  including SHP1 and SHIP1/2.
