caption: The interaction between metabolic pathways and signalling involving reactive
  oxygen species, K+ and Ca+2 in fibre development. ROS, K+ and Ca+2 play positive
  roles and mutually regulate fibre development. Ca2+ deficiency (whitening) induces
  K+ accumulation through CIPK6 to regulate fibre development; on the other hand,
  excessive Ca2+ (reddening) promotes calcium sensor CaM7 function and ROS accumulation,
  and increasing ROS also facilitate the K+ accumulation by KT1/KT2 function. Furthermore,
  sucrose functions downstream of ROS to involve the fibre development. Therefore,
  the homeostasis of K+ and Ca+2 contents in the cell is vital for fibre development.
  SPS (sucrose‐phosphate synthase) and SUS (sucrose synthase) regulate the sucrose
  synthesis and degradation, respectively. An annexin, GhAnn2, function upstream of
  the Ca2+pathway in mediating fibre development.
