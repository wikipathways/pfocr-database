caption: A current model of the Neurospora circadian negative feedback loop. WCC functions
  as the positive element of the loop, whereas FRQ and FRH forms the FFC complex to
  function as the negative element. FFC inhibits WCC activity by recruiting casein
  kinases to phosphorylate WCC, resulting the removal of WCC from the DNA and its
  sequestration in the cytoplasm. To restart a circadian cycle, PP4 promotes the nuclear
  entry of WCC, whereas PP2A activates WCC DNA-binding activity. The casein kinases
  also phosphorylate FRQ, which promotes FRQ degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. PP1 and PP4 counter the role of the casein kinases and stabilize FRQ. The
  stability of FRQ determines the period length of the clock. A full-colour version
  of this figure is available at The EMBO Journal Online.
