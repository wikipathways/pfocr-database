caption: The cholesterol and triglyceride-phospholipid biosynthesis pathways. The
  genes in green were found to be decreased in the inducible Huntington disease cell
  model by microarray analysis; the genes in blue were not present on the microarray
  filters. All of the genes bearing an SRE in their promoter, and regulated by sterol
  regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP), are tagged with a red asterisk. Sterol
  C14-reductase, sterol C4-methyl oxidase, NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase, 17β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase-7, 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ-Δ-isomerase, sterol C-5-desaturase and desmosterol
  reductase, localized between Cyp51 and 7DHCRed, are likely also SREBP-dependent
  genes. The triglyceride-phospholipid biosynthetic pathway has not yet been carefully
  analysed in Huntington disease but, based on the findings from Sipione et al. herein
  summarized, it may well be affected. From
