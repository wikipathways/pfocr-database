caption: Diverse pro-inflammatory compounds ingested in the human body are detoxified
  to more water-soluble forms via the liver phase II pathway that include glucuronidation
  by glucuronosyl-transferases (UDPGT). The glucuronidated compounds are mostly excreted
  in bile and finally eliminated in faeces. The GUS activity of the gut microbiota
  releases the lipid-soluble/pro-inflammatory form, able to reenter the enterohepatic
  loop and therefore elevate risk of inflammation and body exposure. In healthy subjects,
  despite individual specificities, the GUS equipment remains compatible with homeostasis.
  In subjects predisposed to CD, a higher potential for GUS activity is hypothesized
  to result from expression of the GUS/FGDFGND C7D2 transporter/AFTR locus. Even if
  all unaffected CDR do not develop CD, this potential GUS-linked damage precedes
  symptoms and may be involved in exacerbation of chronic inflammation in response
  to environmental and/or host genetic signals.
