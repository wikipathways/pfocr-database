caption: Simplified schematic summary of PIF-mediated signaling pathways. phy photoactivation
  (Pfr formation) triggers rapid nuclear-localized proteolysis of the PIF proteins.
  Under long-term light exposure, a direct, mutually negative feedback loop from the
  PIFs to phyB emerges, whereby the PIFs modulate phyB abundance concomitantly with
  the converse, by inducing COP1-catalyzed ubiquitylation and degradation of phyB.
  In addition to this direct regulation of PIF protein abundance, photoactivated phys
  regulate PIF activity indirectly (i) at the transcriptional level via control of
  the circadian clock, which in turn induces circadian oscillations in PIF4 and PIF5
  gene expression in the light, (ii) at the post-translational level via modulation
  of the GA signaling pathway, which controls the abundance of DELLA proteins, which,
  in turn, act negatively on PIF transcriptional activity through binding to the bHLH
  domain, and, potentially, (iii) by an unknown mechanism via the COP1–SPA regulatory
  pathway (broken line). PIF4 and PIF5 are also subject to negative feedback regulation
  via inhibitory heterodimer formation with HFR1, whose gene expression level is promoted
  by PIF4 and PIF5 in response to vegetational shade. These alterations in abundance
  or activity result in activation or repression of PIF target-genes, leading in turn
  to propagation of the cascade of transcriptional changes that drive the overt morphogenic
  responses. High temperature acts specifically through PIF4 by an unknown mechanism
  to induce enhanced elongation growth.
