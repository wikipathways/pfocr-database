caption: Ethylene is perceived by a family of two-component receptors containing a
  consensus (unshaded) or degenerate (shaded) HK domain (H). Three of the receptors
  also contain a C-terminal receiver domain (R). The receptors negatively regulate
  ethylene response together with CTR1 in a complex on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
  Perception results in reduced receptor and CTR1 activities and activation of a MAP
  kinase kinase, which transmits the signal through the EIN2 membrane protein, ultimately
  resulting in the activation of a transcriptional cascade in the nucleus. The EIN3
  and EIL1 transcription factors regulate primary response genes including ERF1, which
  activates a subset of secondary ethylene-induced genes involved in defense responses.
  EIN3/EIL1 abundance is regulated in an ethylene-dependent manner by SCF complexes
  containing F-box proteins encoded by the ethylene-induced genes EBF1 and EBF2. Positive-
  and negative-acting components of the pathway are indicated in green and red, respectively.
  Solid lines indicate regulation that is likely to be through direct interactions.
  Dotted lines indicate speculative interactions based on genetic studies.
