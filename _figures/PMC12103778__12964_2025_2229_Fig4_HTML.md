caption: Cytoneme-mediated self-organization and asymmetric cell division in stem
  cells. (A) Schematic illustration of the self-organization of embryonic stem cells
  (ESCs) and trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). Cytonemes extending from ESCs to TSCs
  mediate Wnt3a signaling through LRP6 and iGluRs, leading to calcium transients and
  activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (B) Schematic illustration of asymmetric
  cell division, showing how the asymmetric distribution of β-catenin between daughter
  cells influences their fates, with one cell maintaining self-renewal capability
  and the other initiating differentiation
