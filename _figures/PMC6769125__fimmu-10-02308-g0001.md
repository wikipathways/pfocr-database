caption: High load of HBsAg suppresses innate and adaptive immune responses through
  different mechanisms. (1–2) Persistent stimulation of HBsAg leads to exhaustion
  of HBsAg-specific T-cell and B-cell responses, which are characterized by upregulation
  of inhibitory molecules, such as PD-1, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein
  4 (CTLA-4), and T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing molecule-
  (TIM-) 3. (3–4) High level of HBsAg attenuates hepatic innate immunity through inhibition
  of TLR-mediated signal pathway and induction of interleukin-10 in LSECs and KCs.
