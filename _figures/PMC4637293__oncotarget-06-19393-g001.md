caption: PD-1 functions to inhibit T cell activation not only by attenuating TCR signaling
  (SHP-1/2), but also by enhancing the expression of genes that impair T cell function.
  PI3K-Akt-mTOR, JNK, and Ras-MEK-ERK signals are crucial regulators for PD-1-mediated
  inhibitory effect on T cell immune. PD-L2 is mainly expressed on B cells. Oct2 can
  regulate PD-L2 gene expression in B-1 cells and at low antigen concentrations, PD-L2-PD-1interactions
  suppressed B cell function by inhibiting TCR-B7-CD28 signals.
