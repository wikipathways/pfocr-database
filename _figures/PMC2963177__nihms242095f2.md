caption: Current data indicates thatTGF-β1 activates two distinct signaling pathways
  that initiate transcription of PAI-1. Rho/ROCK are required for maintenance of SMAD
  phosphorylation as well as ERK activation (through yet to be defined mechanisms)
  while the pp60c-src-activated EGFR (at theY845 site) signals to MEK-ERK initiating
  likely ERK/USF interactions resulting in USF phosphorylation and a subtype (USF-1→USF-2)
  switch at the PAI-1 PE1/PE2 E box sites. Collectively, these two promoter-level
  events stimulate high levels of PAI-1 in response to TGF-βR occupancy. The actual
  mechanism underlying EGFR activation in response toTGF-β1 is unknown but may involve
  direct recruitment of src kinases to the EGFR or the processing and release of a
  membrane-anchored EGFR ligand (e.g. HB-EGF). Similarly, events associated with TGF-β1
  stimulation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway are presently unclear. Rho/Rock may regulate
  the activity and/or function of the SMAD phosphatase PPM1A impacting, thereby, the
  duration of SMAD-dependent transcription of target genes such as PAI-1.
