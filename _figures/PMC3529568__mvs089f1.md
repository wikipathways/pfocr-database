caption: TGF-β latency, activation and signal transduction. Pro TGF-β forms a homodimer
  after synthesis and binds to LTBP via disulfide bonds, followed by a cleavage from
  LAP by furin proteases. LAP remains associated with mature TGF-β and forms SLC and
  LLC, conferring latency. Mature TGF-β is shown as a circle after LAP cleavage. After
  secretion, LLCs are incorporated into ECM, as LTBPs interact with FBNs. Proteolytic
  degradation of LAP or mechanical stretching by cell-surface integrins releases active
  TGF-β molecules that bind to their receptors. Active TGF-β is represented as with
  a blue halo. Cells respond to TGF-β through the canonical Smad-dependent pathway
  and non-canonical pathways, in which the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathways and the activation of RhoA are involved. Activated phosphoSmads form a
  ternary complex and, together with co-factors, induce transcription of TGF-β-responsive
  genes. Non-canonical pathways also influence gene expressions, and the activation
  of Rho kinases induces the polymerization of actin fibres. ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  SRE, Smad response element.
