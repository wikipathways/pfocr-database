caption: SIRT2 promotes metastasis of gastric cancer through RAS/ERK/JNK/MMP-9 pathway
  by increasing PEPCK1-related metabolism.SIRT2 stabilizes the PEPCK1 protein by inhibiting
  its acetylation associated with ubiquitination. PEPCK1 promotes mitochondrial activity
  by increasing cellular uptake of glucose and glutamine. Metabolic abnormalities
  increase migration and invasion by activating the RAS/ERK/JNK/MMP-9 pathway.
