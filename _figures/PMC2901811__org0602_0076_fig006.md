caption: A model of the Fat/Hippo regulation of growth. Dpp signaling may affect signaling
  through the pathway via its effects on Dachsous and Fat. Wingless signaling may
  affect the activity of Yorkie through Vestigial’s interaction with Scalloped, a
  Yorkie co-factor. How Vestigial affects the interaction between Yorkie and Scalloped
  is, however, unclear. Mechanical forces may affect the activity of Hippo through
  their effect on Merlin and Expanded. Solid lines indicate protein-protein binding,
  solid arrows indicate biochemical interactions, dotted arrows indicate genetic interactions,
  gray arrow indicates hypothetical interaction. Data from references 96, 99 and 103.
