caption: The schematic model for the regulation of the transcription of the srf operon
  network involved in two extracellular signaling peptide-mediated quorum sensing
  in B. subtilis. The srf operon was composed of four genes encoding surfactin synthetase
  with comS embedded between gene srfAA and srfAB. Both ComX and CSF activate the
  transcription of the srf operon by stimulating the activity of transcription factor
  ComA through phosphorylation (ComA-P) via two separate pathways, one of which requires
  the ComX peptide to be processed outside by ComQ. Another pathway is mediated by
  CSF, which is encoded by phrC and is initially imported as inactive-form CSF (inact).
  The active-form CSF (act), which interacts with two intracellular targets, is generated
  through processing by the Spo0K gene. At low concentrations, CSF inhibits the activity
  of an aspartyl-phosphate phosphatase, RapC, and is speculated to inhibit the kinase
  activity of ComP at high concentrations
