caption: 'Arachidonic acid (AA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that constitutes the
  phospholipid domain of most cell membranes and is liberated from the cellular membranes
  by cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Free AA can be metabolized to eicosanoids
  through three major pathways: the cyclooxygenase (COX), the lipoxygenase (LOX),
  and the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase pathway. In the COX pathway, the key step
  is the enzymatic conversion of the AA to intermediate PGG2, which is then reduced
  to an intermediate PGH2 by the peroxidase activity of COX. PGH2 is sequentially
  metabolized to prostanoids, including prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes (TXs)
  via specific PG and TX synthases. The MRP gene family is comprised of efflux transporters
  for both PGs while PGT is an influx transporter for PGs. 15-PGDH mainly metabolizes
  the intracellular PGE2 and PGF2α to a stable 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGA2 (PGEM) and
  13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2α.'
