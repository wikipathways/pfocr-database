caption: 'TGF-β signaling pathway and its role in tumor immune microenvironment. TGF-β
  signal is transduced by TGF-β receptor complex which consists of TGF-βI receptors
  and TGF-βII receptors (TGF-βRI and TGF-βRII). Firstly, extracellular TGF-β binds
  to TGF-βRII homodimer which further complex with TGF-βRI homodimer. Following TGF-β
  engagement, TGF-βRII homodimer phosphorylates the intracellular domain of TGF-βRI.
  The engagement of TGF-β receptor complex recruits receptor Smad (R-Smad) molecules
  Smad2 and 3 to the intracellular domain of TGF-βRI. Subsequently, Smad2 and 3 are
  phosphorylated which then form a trimeric complex with Smad4. The trimeric Smad
  complex could translocate to nuclear and regulate gene expression. Besides, phosphorylated
  Smad2 and 3 could also form a trimeric complex with TIF1γ to regulate the expression
  of targeting genes. Apart from classic Smad pathway, TGF-β signal could also be
  transduced by some Smad-independent pathways such as PI3K, MAPK, and Rho GTPase
  pathways. TGF-β signaling pathway has a substantial influence on various immune
  cells including downregulating the cytotoxicity of effector T cells and NKs, promoting
  the apoptosis of effector T cells, inducing the differentiation towards Tregs, hampering
  the antigens presentation of DCs.Abbreviations: NK, natural killer cell; CAF, cancer-associated
  fibroblast; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; IDO, indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase;
  Id1, inhibitor of differentiation 1; Treg, regulatory T cell.'
