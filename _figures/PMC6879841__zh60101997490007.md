caption: Summary of proposed metabolic adaptations in intrauterine growth restriction
  (IUGR) skeletal muscle that conserve energy utilization and result in the release
  of ammoniagenic amino acids (AAs; alanine, glutamine, glycine) and uric acid. Metabolites,
  AA uptake rates, and gene expressions of enzymes (italics) in the IUGR (n = 10)
  fetal skeletal muscle or plasma that were higher (green), lower (red), or unchanged
  (black) when compared with control (CON; n = 8) fetuses. Black and gray-shaded arrows
  and font show proposed increases and decreases, respectively, in metabolic pathway
  flux. Based on these analyses, we propose that reduced oxidative metabolism (through
  glycolysis and the TCA cycle) and reduced availability of phosphate and adenosine
  result in increased entry of ADP into a salvage pathway for ATP generation. AMP
  and ammonia are then overly produced in IUGR muscle. AMP is further processed to
  uric acid via AMP deaminase, and excess ammonia is converted and released into the
  plasma in the forms of glutamine and glycine. Alanine, which is a gluconeogenic
  substrate and released into the circulation, is produced as a result of a series
  of transamination reactions that alleviate the load of pyruvate and glutamate. α-KG,
