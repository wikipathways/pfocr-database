caption: Schematic representation of the two mechanisms for the combined VIP signaling-
  and circadian clock-regulated per1 gene expression. (A) The mechanism represented
  by , where either VIP signaling-activated CREB or the circadian transcription factor
  Bmal1/Clk can activate the transcription machinery to reach its maximum rate. When
  both are present, it is effectively as if only one is binding to the transcriptional
  machinery at a time to reach the maximum rate of transcription. (B) The mechanism
  represented by , where both CREB and Bmal1/Clk can activate the gene transcription
  to their individual respective maxima. When both are present, they both bind to
  the transcriptional machinery and have an additive or synergistic effect on the
  rate of transcription. C, CREB; B/C, Bmal1/Clk; Pol II, RNA polymerase II. The arrow
  denotes the direction of per1 transcription.
