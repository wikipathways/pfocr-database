caption: Trim21 negatively regulates the DDX41-mediated signaling pathway. In the
  early phase, DNA from diverse microbes is sensed by DDX41 in the cytosol of infected
  cells as a danger signal. STING recruits TBK1 to its C-terminal tail, and TBK1 then
  interacts with and phosphorylates IRF3/7. Phosphorylated IRF3/7 dimerizes and translocates
  to the nucleus, thereby promoting the expression of immune and inflammatory genes.
  In the late phase, Trim21 interacts with DDX41 and causes the K48-linked ubiquitination
  of DDX41. After ubiquitination, DDX41 is degraded by the proteasome, thus preventing
  ‘downstream' cytokine induction.
