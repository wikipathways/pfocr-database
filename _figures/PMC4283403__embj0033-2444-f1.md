caption: The newly discovered RESET pathwayMembrane and secreted proteins are synthesized
  in ER membrane-associated ribosomes. Global quality control mechanisms, such as
  the calnexin–calreticulin cycle, allow folded proteins to exit the ER and enter
  the secretory route (generic blue proteins and blue GPI-anchored proteins). Alternatively,
  unfolded proteins are targeted to ERAD for proteasome-mediated degradation (generic
  red proteins). In the RESET pathway, unfolded GPI-anchored proteins (red GPI-anchored
  proteins) bind calnexin and Tmp21. ER stress triggers the dissociation of calnexin
  from GPI proteins, while Tmp21 acts as an export receptor. Unfolded GPI proteins
  reach the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus. Unknown signals and accessory
  molecules target these proteins for endocytosis and lysosome degradation, thus alleviating
  ER protein overload.
