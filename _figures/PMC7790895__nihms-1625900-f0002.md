caption: 'Pathway to translating nonclinical to clinical outcomes for TB. Different
  pathways exist to translate preclinical to clinical outcomes. Two methods reviewed
  here include a PK approach and a systems approach. The PK approach can be used to
  predict equivalent drug exposure between nonclinical models and humans. Here, the
  assumption is that the outcomes will be comparable between species if drug exposure
  is matched. However, with the complexity of TB disease, a more systems-like approach
  may be necessary, as species differences in disease pathology do not capture the
  full spectrum of outcomes in patients. This approach therefore incorporates host-specific
  differences and models host-bacteria-drug dynamics at the site of action to make
  more accurate predictions in patients. Abbreviations: MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration;
  PK, pharmacokinetics; PD, pharmacodynamics; TB, tuberculosis.'
