caption: 'C-terminal truncation of LBR (e.g. in LBR 1600* or 1400TΔ) causes the sterol
  reductase domain (SRD) to misfold, leading to LBR ubiquitylation, membrane dislocation
  and its subsequent degradation via the Ub/proteasome pathway. A minor portion of
  LBR1600* is degraded by the canonical ERAD pathway in the ER, whereas the majority
  will enter the nucleus by virtue of the correctly folded N-terminal domain and be
  retained by binding to the nuclear lamina. Here, a presumably ERAD-independent pathway
  is operative, involving both p97 and the Ub/proteasome. Turnover at the INM can
  be inhibited at the dislocation or degradation step by a dominant negative p97 variant
  (p97 QQ) or the proteasome inhibitor MG132, respectively. Note that several ERAD
  components as well as p97 cofactors are omitted for clarity. ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  INM, inner nuclear membrane; ONM, outer nuclear membrane; Ub, ubiquitin.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16011.019'
