caption: 'Mechanisms of action of TCM prescriptions and natural bioactive molecules
  in atherosclerosis therapy by targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
  (PPARs). TCM prescriptions and natural bioactive molecules including flavonoids,
  natural acids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and phenolic compounds mainly decreases lipid
  accumulation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the subsequent
  signaling pathways including PPARα/carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT)-1 and acyl-CoA
  oxidase 1 (ACOX1)-mediated fatty acid β-oxidation in liver and PPARγ/liver X receptor
  (LXR) α/ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1/ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux
  from macrophages to apolipoprotein (Apo) A1 and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles,
  thereby decreasing foam cell formation. Moreover, some TCM prescriptions and natural
  molecules may decrease cluster of differentiation (CD) 36-mediated lipid absorption
  via suppressing PPARγ, thereby reducing lipid accumulation in macrophages. Notably,
  TCM prescriptions and natural molecules primarily ameliorate inflammation by suppressing
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/nuclear factor kappa B (NK-κB) and phosphoinositide-3
  kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT/PKB)/NK-κB signaling pathways through activation
  of PPARγ. Furthermore, these natural compounds can inhibit Toll-like receptor (TLR)4/myeloid
  differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/NF-κB signaling pathway and promote macrophage
  shift to an anti-inflammatory M2 type through activation of PPARα. Notably, natural
  compounds may stimulate PPARγ coactivator (PGC)-1β–estrogen related receptor α to
  activate PPARβ/PPARγ signaling pathways and enhance protein kinase A (PKA)/AMPK
  signaling pathway to upregulate PPARα in the liver. Except for NF-κB, nuclear transcription
  factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) is involved in the modulatory effects of PPARs
  on anti-inflammation. These beneficial effects of TCMs are supposed to retard the
  development of atherosclerosis. IKK: inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase subunit;
