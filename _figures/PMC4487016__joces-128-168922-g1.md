caption: TORC1 processes numerous signals and controls diverse sets of pathways. TORC1
  is activated by growth factors, nutrients, infectious agents and oncogenes, and
  is inhibited by stress and rapamycin. The axis of amino acid signaling that is controlled
  by the SEA/GATOR complex is highlighted in blue.
