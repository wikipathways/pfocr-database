caption: MC-released mediators and signaling pathways elicited by bacteria. After
  recognition by specific pattern recognition receptors (i.e. TLR4 or TLR2) or specialized
  receptors (i.e. CR1, CR2 and CD48), distinct signaling cascades are activated in
  MCs causing the synthesis and secretion of numerous pro-inflammatory mediators,
  such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4), leukotriene C4 (LTC4), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α,
  interleukins (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, granulocyte and monocyte colony stimulating
  factor (GM-CSF), and preformed mediators, such as β-hexosaminidase and histamine.
  The better-known signaling pathway activated by bacteria is the MyD88-dependent
  cascade leading to cytokine gene transcription after NFκB and AP-1 activation, that
  requires classical IKK and MAPK (ERK1/2, P38 and JNK) phosphorylation, together
  with the recruitment of Huntingtin. IKK also contributes to TNF secretion through
  the phosphorylation of SNAP23 and the ERK1/2-dependent TACE activation. Still controversial,
  TLR4 is internalized upon LPS recognition and translocated to acidic endo-lysosomes,
  inducing IFN-β releasing. A particular mechanism has been described for Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa, that promotes endothelin (ET)-1 release from surrounding cells, triggering
  ETA receptor in MCs. In this scheme solid-lines indicate known pathways and dashed-lines
  show reported effects of receptor triggering in cases where signaling cascades have
  not been described. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PGN, peptidoglycan.

  description: MC-released mediators and signaling pathways elicited by bacteria.
    After recognition by specific pattern recognition receptors (i.e. TLR4 or TLR2)
    or specialized receptors (i.e. CR1, CR2 and CD48), distinct signaling cascades
    are activated in MCs causing the synthesis and secretion of numerous pro-inflammatory
    mediators, such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4), leukotriene C4 (LTC4), tumor necrosis
    factor (TNF)-α, interleukins (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, granulocyte and
    monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and preformed mediators, such as
    β-hexosaminidase and histamine. The better-known signaling pathway activated by
    bacteria is the MyD88-dependent cascade leading to cytokine gene transcription
    after NFκB and AP-1 activation, that requires classical IKK and MAPK (ERK1/2,
    P38 and JNK) phosphorylation, together with the recruitment of Huntingtin. IKK
    also contributes to TNF secretion through the phosphorylation of SNAP23 and the
    ERK1/2-dependent TACE activation. Still controversial, TLR4 is internalized upon
    LPS recognition and translocated to acidic endo-lysosomes, inducing IFN-β releasing.
    A particular mechanism has been described for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that promotes

    In this scheme solid-lines indicate known pathways and dashed-lines show reported
