caption: Effect of different groups of cannabinoids on intestinal permeability after
  apical and basolateral administration to Caco-2 cell culture. Apically administration
  of endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like compounds cause an increase in permeability
  mediated primarily by CB1, CB2, and TRPV1 receptors and through the PPARα signaling
  pathway, while when they are administered basolaterally, cause a decrease in permeability
  via CB1 and TRPV1 receptors and also the PPARα signaling pathway. Phytocannabinoids
  have been found to improve the integrity of intestinal barrier by influencing CB1
  receptors. The figure was created with BioRender.com, accessed on 29 April 2024
