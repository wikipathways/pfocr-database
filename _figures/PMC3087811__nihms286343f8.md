caption: Schematic model for the role of TGF-β signaling pathways in iTreg and Th17
  cell development. TGF-β binding induces heteromeric complex formation of TβR-II
  and TβR-I. This complex activates SMAD2 or SMAD3, as well as the ERK and JNK MAPKs
  pathways, which induces Foxp3 expression and drives the development of induced regulatory
  T cells when IL-2 is present. Conversely, this complex activates STAT3, JNK, and
  p38 MAPKs, promoting RORγt-expressing CD4+ cells to differentiate into Th17 cells
  when IL-6 is present. Foxp3 expression can suppress RORγt+ cells from conversion
  to Th17 cells, but IL-6 signaling pathway molecules, such as STAT3 and SMAD7, also
  have a negative feedback on Foxp3+ induced regulation differentiation.
