caption: Schematic model of the regulatory networks involved in MC formation. In the
  GA signaling pathway, bioactive GAs negatively regulate DELLA transcription factors
  by facilitating proteolytic degradation of DELLAs. SCL3, acting downstream of both
  DELLA and SHR/SCR transcription factors, serves as an endodermis-specific integrator.
  In addition, SEU is involved in the control of MC formation, by positively regulating
  the expression of SHR, SCR, and SCL3. In parallel, the ABA pathway also controls
  the abundance of GAZ mRNA, which plays a role in the transcriptional control of
  GA and ABA metabolism. GAZ is positioned downstream of SCL3, which regulates the
  level of GAZ expression via an unknown transcription factor (TF X). Thus, GAZ acts
  as a point of convergence for the ABA and GA pathways. Together, multiple inputs
  from plant hormone pathways (ABA and GA) and developmental pathways (SHR/SCR and
  SEU) should be coordinately integrated to control maturation of the Arabidopsis
  root GT. Arrows represent positive regulation, and bars denote negative regulation.

  description: Schematic model of the regulatory networks involved in MC formation.
    In the GA signaling pathway, bioactive GAs negatively regulate DELLA transcription
    factors by facilitating proteolytic degradation of DELLAs. SCL3, acting downstream

    integrator. In addition, SEU is involved in the control of MC formation, by positively

    regulates the level of GAZ expression via an unknown transcription factor (TF
    X). Thus, GAZ acts as a point of convergence for the ABA and GA pathways. Together,
    multiple inputs from plant hormone pathways (ABA and GA) and developmental pathways
    (SHR/SCR and SEU) should be coordinately integrated to control maturation of the
    Arabidopsis root GT. Arrows represent positive regulation, and bars denote negative
