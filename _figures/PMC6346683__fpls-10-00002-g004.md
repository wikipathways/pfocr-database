caption: Lipid remodeling during Pi starvation in higher plants. During Pi starvation,
  phospholipids are partially degraded and replaced by the galactoglycerolipid DGDG
  synthesized in plastids. DGDG transport from plastids to mitochondria (Mito) occurs
  at contact sites and is partly mediated by the mitochondrial transmembrane lipoprotein
  (MTL) complex. Inside this complex, Mic60, located in the inner membrane (IM) of
  mitochondria, plays a key role in the import of DGDG from plastids and in the export
  of phosphatidylethanolamine from mitochondria. Mic60 interacts with Tom40 located
  in the outer membrane (OM) of mitochondria at OM-IM contact sites. Whether the transfer
  of DGDG to plasma membrane (PM) and vacuole (Vac) occurs at contact sites or via
  the vesicular transfer pathway is still unknown.
