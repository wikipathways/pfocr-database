caption: Schematic depiction of the signalling pathways stimulated by cholecystokinin
  (CCK) activation of the CCK1 receptor. CCK1 receptor activation by CCK is known
  to result in activation of Gq-initiated pathways with stimulation of classical second
  messengers (bold line) such as phospholipase C (PLC)/phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2)/diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C (PKC)/inositol 3, 4, 5-triphosphate
  (IP3) resulting in the release of intracellular calcium. Additionally, nicotinic
  acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPr) pathways
  have also been implicated in the release of calcium after ligand stimulation of
  the receptor. A number of other signalling pathways have been shown to be activated
  by ligand stimulation of the CCK1 receptor. These include the class I phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) pathway involving Akt and stimulation of mammalian Target of Rapamycin
  (mTOR) that results in downstream activation of transcriptions factors, the NF-κB
  pathway as well as the Gs-initiated adenylate cyclase (AC) pathway. Three mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathways have been shown to be stimulated by CCK1 receptor
  activation, p38-MAPK, extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun amino-terminal
  kinase (JNK). The activation of the CCK1 receptor has also been shown to stimulate
  the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in activation
  of Ras that in turn has been shown to be important in the activation of the JNK
  and ERK pathways. While no direct evidence has shown CCK activation of arrestin
  family proteins, these are known to have various signalling roles in many GPCRs
  and bind and potentially regulate several subsets of proteins from various signalling
  pathways (dashed lines).
