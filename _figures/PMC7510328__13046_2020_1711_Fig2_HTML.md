caption: Mechanisms of MET and/or RON activation, signaling pathway, and biological
  consequence. Activation of MET and/or RON in CRAC cells, in general, is mediated
  through five events including ligand binding, activating mutation, receptor overexpression,
  aberrant splicing/alternative initiation, and transactivation through other RTKs
  such as EGFR and IGF-1R. HGF or MSP-induced MET and/or RON activation, a classical
  model, is functional through phosphorylation of several critical tyrosine residues
  and creates the C-terminal functional docking site, which recruits cytoplasmic molecules
  such as SOS and GRB2. The negative modulator c-CBL, a ubiquitin ligase, also binds
  the docking site and mediates MET and/or RON endocytosis and degradation. Multiple
  signaling pathways, such as RAS/MAP kinase, PI3K/AKT, Wnt/β-catenin, and TGF-β/SMAD
  pathways are activated upon MET and/or RON phosphorylation in CRAC cells, which
  creates a complex intracellular signaling network. The biological consequence is
  induction of EMT in CRAC cells leading to increased cellular survival, invasiveness,
  chemoresistance, and tumorigenic stemness. Briefly, activation of the RAS/MAP kinase
  cascade stimulates MET and/or RON-mediated activities such as cellular survival,
  invasiveness, chemoresistance, and tumorigenic stemness through regulating various
  gene expressions and cellular activities. Activated Erk1/2 also stimulates RSK-2,
  which regulates not only gene transcription but also cytoskeleton re-organization
  to cause the EMT-like phenotype. The PI3K-AKT pathway is essential in MET and/or
  RON-mediated cellular invasive growth and chemoresistance. Activated AKT inhibits
  GSK-3β by phosphorylation, resulting in MET and/or RON signaling cross-talking with
  the β-catenin pathway. AKT signaling is also linked to MET and/or RON-induced mTOR
  phosphorylation, which releases HIF-1α from the VHL. Similarly, mTOR stimulates
  p70S6 kinase, which activates certain transcription factors leading to increased
  gene expression. AKT also stimulates 14-3-3 phosphorylation, which displaces α6β4
  integrin from its location at hemidesmosomes and re-localizes it to lamellipodia
  for cell motility. MET and/or RON activation also collaborates with TGF-β mediated
  Smad2/3 signaling and regulates CRAC cell EMT-like phenotypes, leading to cellular
  senescence, migration, and chemoresistance. Studies also show that MET and/or RON
  activation regulate β-catenin dephosphorylation by activating DVL, leading to β-catenin
  accumulation and nuclear translocation for activating gene transcription. ABL, Abelson
