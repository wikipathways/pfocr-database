caption: Summary of radiation-induced persistent alterations of IGF1 and leptin signaling
  pathways observed in our study. Radiation exposure was associated with decreased
  IGFBP3, increased IGF1 and IGF1R, and activation of PI3K/Akt pathway via IRS1. Radiation
  exposure also decreased adiponectin and Adipo-R, increased leptin and Ob-R, and
  activated JAK2 pathway. Adiponectin antagonizes IGF1 and leptin, and decreased adiponectin
  and its receptors are expected to further promote IGF1 and leptin signaling through
  reduced antagonism. There is also existence of crosstalk between JAK2 and PI3K/Akt
  via IRS1 and combined activation of these two pathways is contributing to intestinal
  cell proliferation with potential for intestinal disorder and colon cancer.
