caption: Pathway analysis derived by comparison of the relative abundance of metabolites
  from sera derived from patients with locoregional CRC and liver-only metastases,
  as determined by GC-MS. More centrally located molecules in the illustrated networks
  have a greater probability of participating in the biological processes involved
  in metastasis, but also represent hubs of diverse known biological functions. (a)
  The first network highlights the contribution of mediators of proliferation, apoptosis
  and energy consumption, as well as a prominent role of inflammatory mediators. As
  indicated, some of the molecules putatively involved are known for their contribution
  to the pathogenesis of metastasis in colorectal cancer. (b) The second network demonstrates
  that inflammatory processes are highly involved in the metastatic process.
