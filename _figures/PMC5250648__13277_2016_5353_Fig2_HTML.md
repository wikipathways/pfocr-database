caption: Ca2+ induces autophagy. The cytosolic calcium concentration can be elevated
  by multiple factors, including Ca2+-mobilizing agents, the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic
  reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) inhibitors, or other autophagy inducers (such as starvation
  and rapamycin). These factors stimulate IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER.
  Stimulus-induced Ca2+ release could be blunted by the Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA, or Bcl-2.
  Increased cytosolic Ca2+ can trigger autophagy through various mechanisms; the activation
  of CaMKKβ by Ca2+ stimulates the AMPK-mediated suppression of mTOR signaling. The
  overexpression of LRRK2 promotes Ca2+ release from lysosomal stores and then initiates
  autophagy through the Ca2+/CaMKKβ/AMPK pathway, but this effect is mTOR-independent.
  Ca2+-activated autophagy can also be AMPK-independent. PKCθ activation followed
  by elevated Ca2+ is required for ER stress-induced autophagy. Ca2+-ERK pathway is
  also involved in autophagy induction, which may be associated with the phosphorylation
  of Bcl-2, thereby resulting in Beclin 1 release from Bcl-2. In addition, Ca2+ can
  activate DAPK, which phosphorylates Beclin 1, thereby mediating its dissociation
  from Bcl-2. Vps34 may also be activated by Ca2+, although this activation is still
  debated. Lysosomal Ca2+signaling could also induce autophagy. TRPML3, a Ca2+-permeable
  channel mainly expressed in lysosomes, facilitates autophagosome maturation by providing
  Ca2+ in the fusion process through a specific interaction with Atg8. MCOLN1 and
  lysosomal Ca2+ channel could induce autophagy by activating the calcineurin and
  its substrate TFEB. Furthermore, the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel MCOLN3 also activates
  autophagy
