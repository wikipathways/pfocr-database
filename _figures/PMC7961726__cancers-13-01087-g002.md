caption: Representation molecular mechanisms underlying the tumoral properties of
  glioma cells. A. Canonical pathway for miRNA biogenesis. miRNA are transcribed by
  RNA Pol II to produce the pri-miRNA that is later processed by the endonuclease
  Drosha/DGCR8 complex resulting in the formation of the hairpin precursor (pre-miRNA)
  that goes under a second cleavage by the endonuclease Dicer and generates a miRNA
  duplex. One of the strains, the mature ~22 nt (guide strain) is later loaded into
  the RISC (RNA Induced Silencing Complex) in association with Ago proteins. Via imperfect
  base-pairing to the 3′ UTR of its target mRNAs, miRNAs regulate the expression of
  its target genes by repressing mRNA translation and/or promoting mRNA degradation.
  B. miRNAs and target genes involved in GBM. Examples of miRNAs found to be downregulated
  or upregulated (indicated with the arrow) in GBM and their target genes involved
  in GBM pathology. C. Metabolic pathways altered in GBM. Metabolic switching towards
  aerobic glycolisis is a hallmark of cancer which controls the properties and functions
  of tumor cells, such as their increased proliferation or resistance to treatments.
  The therapeutic intervention of metabolic pathways, described in this figure, may
  offer new opportunities for the treatment of GBM.
