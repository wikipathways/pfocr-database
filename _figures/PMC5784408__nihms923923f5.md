caption: Naproxen activates UPR signaling and blocks NFκB pathway. Activation of UPR
  signaling was characterized by the enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2α and increased
  ATF4 as well as its transcriptionally regulated CHOP. These pathways together block
  inflammatory response and induce apoptosis in UVB-induced BCC and SCCs. ↑ represents
  enhancement, ↓ represents decrease, → represents activating effect, ⊢ represents
  blocking effect, p – phosphorylation, ER – endoplasmic reticulum, UPR – unfolded
  protein response, ATF4 - activating transcription factor 4, eIF2α - eukaryotic initiation
  factor 2α, CHOP - C/EBP homologous protein, NFκB – nuclear factor kappa B, iNOS
  - inducible nitric oxide synthase, and COX2 – cyclooxygenase2.
