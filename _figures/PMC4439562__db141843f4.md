caption: 'GPCR (or GPR) signaling in the regulation of β-cell proliferation. A: Rodent
  β-cells. The incretin hormones, GLP-1 and GIP, bind to their respective GPCRs, GLP-1R
  and GIPR, releasing the “active” Gαs subunit, which stimulates adenylate cyclase
  (AC) and cAMP synthesis. cAMP signals though either PKA or EPAC pathways. PKA phosphorylates
  CREB, which upregulates transcription of key proliferative β-cell genes (e.g., cyclin
  D1, cyclin A2, Pdx1, Irs2) and downregulates transcription of the cell cycle inhibitor
  p27. IRS2 supports autocrine/paracrine stimulation of IGF/IGF receptor (IGFR)/PI3K-Akt
  (Akt-PKB) signaling. Akt activation enhances proliferation through a dual effect:
  activation of mTORC1 and its target p70 ribosomal S6K1 and phosphorylation and inactivation
  of FOXO1, which allows FOXA activation and PDX1 expression. GLP-1 also inactivates
  FOXO1 by inhibiting SirT1-mediated deacetylation of FOXO1. Through a variety of
  cross-talk mechanisms, GLP-1 activates multiple other signaling pathways: PI3K/atypical
  PKCζ, transactivation of EGFR through c-Src tyrosine kinase activation of its ligand
  betacellulin (BTC), ERK1/2, and Wnt signaling pathway molecules β-catenin and transcription
  factor 7–like 2 (TCF7L2). Another GPCR member, PTHR-1, is activated by PTHrP, leading
  to increased β-cell proliferation through PI3K-atypical PKCζ phosphorylation. Overexpression
  of PTHrP in β-cells induces cyclin D2 expression and reduces levels of the cell
  cycle inhibitor p16. Activation of the cannabinoid receptor, CB1R, by its ligands
  anandamide (AEA) and Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), reduces β-cell proliferation
  via inhibition of the insulin/IGF-1/IRS2/AKT signaling pathway through the heterotrimeric
  G-protein, Gαi. The potential effect of CB1R on proliferation by modulating AC is
  not fully understood. Green arrows indicate activation of pathways and red lines
  denote inhibition of pathways. Signaling pathways are denoted by solid lines downstream
  of GLP-1R, dashed lines downstream of PTHR-1, and dotted lines downstream of GIPR.
  B: Human β-cells. The GPCRs, GLP-1R, GIPR, PTHR-1, and CB1R are all present on human
  β-cells. Whether GLP-1 enhances human β-cell proliferation is unclear, as one report
  reveals a modest increase in proliferation () and another indicates no increase
  in replication with GLP-1 analogs (). PTHrP induces human β-cell proliferation in
  vitro and increases expression of the cell cycle activators cyclin E and cdk2 in
  human islets. In gray are molecules and pathways that are known to be activated
  by GPCRs in rodents but are not known to be downstream of GPCRs in human β-cells.'
