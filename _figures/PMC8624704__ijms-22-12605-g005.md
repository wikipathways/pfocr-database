caption: Schematic summary of long-term radiation-induced effects in the hippocampus
  of WT and Ptch1+/− mice. In WT mice, irradiation with 5 Gy of X-rays at P10 induces
  neurogenesis deficit and astrogliosis, associated with deregulation of genes involved
  in the injury response (A2AR and ep300 upregulated; Alk and Cxcl1, downregulated).
  In Ptch1+/− mice we detected a protective role of constitutive Shh pathway activation
  on neurogenesis deficits and astrogliosis, that was associated with the deregulation
  of a large number of proneural genes and possibly with a switch from astroglia toward
  a neuronal cell fate that might contribute to the restoration of neurogenesis.
