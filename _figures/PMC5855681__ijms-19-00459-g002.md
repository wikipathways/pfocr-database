caption: MicroRNAs regulate gene transcription. Nuclear miRNAs can mediate both transcriptional
  gene silencing (TGS) and transcriptional gene activation (TGA) by targeting gene
  promoters. During the TGS, AGO1, DICER, EZH2, SUZ12, and YY1 proteins can be recruited
  on target promoters to induce the silencing through enrichment of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3.
  Instead, during the TGA, target promoters exhibit the enrichment of the RNA polymerase
  II, H3K4me3, and H3ac, H4ac; moreover, AGO1 was also found to be associated to target
  promoters during TGA. In the figure, black arrows indicate the miRNAs biogenesis
  pathway, and red and blue lines represent miRNAs translocated back to the nucleus
  to mediate TGS or TGA, respectively. Chromatin modifications are represented in
  bold.
