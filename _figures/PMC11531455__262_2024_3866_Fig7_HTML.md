caption: The α5-nAChR and SOX2 signaling cascade is involved in lung cancer progression
  and immune escape. Nicotine and cell surface α5-nAChR bind and interact to activate
  the STAT3/SOX2 signaling pathway, which promotes macrophage M2 polarization by promoting
  CSF-1 secretion in tumor cells, further promoting the metastatic ability of tumor
  cells
