caption: Schematic of the IL7R structure and signaling mechanism. The normal IL7R
  is a heterodimer formed by the IL7Rα and the IL2Rγ chain (γc) upon IL-7 binding.
  Interaction with IL-7 is mediated by residues corresponding to the elbow region
  that connects the D1 and D2 extracellular domains of the receptors. Dimerization
  induces the formation of cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains (lipid rafts)
  and the approximation and reciprocal activation of JAK1 and JAK3, followed by phosphorylation
  of IL7Rα’s residue Y449. FERM proteins mediate anchoring of the receptor to F-actin.
  Microtubules are anchored to actin allowing translocation of STAT5 up to the membrane.
  Once phosphorylated, STAT5 forms dimers and is transported by kinesin along microtubules
  towards the nucleus where it activates transcription of different genes involved
  in cell survival and proliferation programs. Y449 phosphorylation also recruits
  and activates the PI3K pathway, which converts phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol (3–5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PDK1 and AKT bind to
  PIP3, enabling AKT to be phosphorylated by PDK1 on S308. Complete activation of
  AKT requires phosphorylation on S473 by mTORC2. The mechanism of RAS activation
  by the IL7R is unknown, but one can suppose that tyrosine phosphorylation in the
  IL7R, JAK1, or JAK3 provides binding sites for adaptor proteins, such as Shc and/or
  Grb2, that upon phosphorylation recruit SOS to the plasma membrane, which in turn
  activates RAS.
