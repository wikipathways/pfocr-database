caption: The mechanisms of GCN5 in plant hormone biosynthesis and secondary metabolic
  pathways. (A) When ethylene is absent, GCN5 and CLV1 are involved in ethylene signaling
  through regulating some key genes transcription (e.g., ERS1, ERF1, EBF2, CTR1) by
  histone acetylation, which is dependent on the EIN3 factor; meanwhile, GCN5 and
  CLV1 also mediate IAA3 and auxin signaling synergistically, proposing the crosslink
  between ethylene and auxin. But GCN5 and CLV1 show antagonistic actions on the histone
  acetylation of H3K9/14, which results in the up-regulation of ERS1, ERF1, EBF2,
  CTR1 in the clv1-1 gcn5-1 double mutant. Moreover, EIN3 can directly bind the promoters
  of ERF1 and EBF2 to control their transcription too (black curved arrow). (B) GCN5
  regulates downstream targets MYC2, DND2, and WRKY33 expression through histone acetylation,
  which inhibits the SA synthesis and accumulation; on the other hand, GCN5 mediates
  SA synthesis through an unidentified pathway independent of NahG and ICS1 to participate
  in SA-mediated plant immunity. (C) GCN5 can mediate the histone acetylation level
  of GTL1 to affect its transcription and the associated cellulose synthesis. (D)
  In fatty acid synthesis, GCN5 can directly regulate histone acetylation of FAD3
  and others (e.g., LACS2, LPP3) to mediate their transcription expression, and involve
  the different steps of fatty acid synthesis and accumulation. DAG, diacyl glycerol;
  TAG, triglyceride. GCN5 is indicated in the pink oval. The black arrows indicate
  active regulation, and the red bars indicate inhibition. The straight line represents
  the direct action, and the dashed line represents the indirect action. The histone
  acetylation modifications are represented with a graphic histone binding with the
  acetyl group (a red circle).
