caption: 'The signalling pathways of UPR. (a) During normal conditions, Bip/GRP78
  binding to IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6α maintains the three transducers in an inactive
  state. In stressed conditions, Bip/GRP78 dissociates from IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6α
  to help the folding of secretory proteins and allows the activation of the transducers
  []. (b) After the release from Bip/GRP78, IRE1α dimerizes and autophosphorylates
  to activate its kinase and endoribonuclease domains []. Activated IRE1α cleaves
  26 nucleotides from the mRNA encoding the X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) allowing
  the translation of XBP1 []. Bip/GRP78 dissociation enables also PERK activation
  through dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation. Activated PERK phosphorylates
  eIF2α at Ser51 leading to attenuation of protein synthesis, thereby reducing ER
  protein load. During this condition, some mRNA, such as the activating transcription
  factor 4 (ATF4) mRNA, are preferentially translated []. During severe ER stress,
  ATF4 strongly induces CHOP that triggers the apoptotic programme in different ways
  []. The eIF2α-ATF4 axis can also be activated by other cytosolic kinases allowing
  the regulation of global protein synthesis and the preferential translation of specific
  mRNA in response to different stimuli in a convergent signalling pathway known as
  integrated stress response (ISR) [, ]. ATF6α is the third ER stress sensor located
  in the ER membrane. Upon ER stress and release by Bip/GRP78, ATF6α is packaged into
  COPII vesicles and transferred to the cis-Golgi where it undergoes intramembrane
  proteolysis-specific cleavage by site 1 protease (S1P) and S2P to produce a transcriptionally
  active fragment (pATF6α). (c) XBP1, ATF4, and pATF6α migrate into the nucleus to
  activate the transcription of specific UPR genes involved in protein folding and
  trafficking, ERAD, cellular metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis [, ]. Bip: Bip/GRP78;
  uXBP1: unspliced XBP1; sXBP1: spliced XBP1.'
