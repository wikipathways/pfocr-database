caption: 'Melatonin can act through membrane-bound G-protein-coupled receptors (MT1,
  MT2), or in a receptor-independent manner. (a) Melatonin binding to its cell-surface
  receptors can activate Gi proteins (Giαβγ) to cause dissociation into Giα-GTP and
  Giβγ. Increases in Giα-GTP or Giβγ can affect the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) pathway. (b) In certain cell types, Giβγ may act via matrix metalloproteinases
  (MPs) to liberate heparin-bound EGF to activate EGFRs in an autocrine loop (Ref.
  ). Subsequent activation of the downstream effectors MEKs and ERKs may drive cell
  proliferation or differentiation (hence dashed arrow) through nuclear events. (c)
  Also, activation of Gi may result in the internalisation of melatonin receptors
  and binding of β-arrestin-2 (probably to phosphorylated melatonin receptors) to
  activate MEKs and ERKs to target cytosolic proteins leading to differentiation.
  (d) Microtubules (purple rectangle) can directly bind to MEK/ ERK and modulate their
  activity and translocation patterns in a cell. (e) Besides effects on the MAPK pathway,
  activated Gi leads to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase (AC) via Giα-GTP to decrease
  cAMP levels within the cell. Decreases in cAMP leads to decreases in the transcription
  of genes responsive to oestrogen receptors (ERs). Gi can also be activated directly
  by microtubules to increase Giα-GTP through α–β tubulin heterodimers (not shown).
  (f) Melatonin can also act independently of melatonin receptors to drive cellular
  events, as it can easily traverse membranes. (g) It can inhibit the cytosolic protein
  calmodulin, which, in turn, can decrease adenylate cyclases sensitive to calmodulin
  (types I, III and VIII). Decreases in adenylate cyclase activity reduce cAMP levels
  to attenuate the transcription of ER-responsive genes. (h) Melatonin can also inhibit
  telomerase and aromatase to reduce cellular proliferation, and (i) can scavenge
  free radicals, thereby reducing oxidative damage. Other abbreviations: EGF, epidermal
  growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase (also known as MAPK1); MEK, MAPK/ ERK kinase (also known as MAP2K1).'
