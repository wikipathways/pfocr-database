caption: Innate antiviral immune responses against viral infection. The induction
  of the IFN response results from the recognition of characteristic viral patterns
  by cellular membranous or cytoplasmic receptors. Activation of these receptors triggers
  a signalling cascade in the cell, leading to the activation of transcription factors
  involved in IFN alpha and beta and proinflammatory cytokine production. Finally,
  the signalling phase consists of the binding of IFN-alpha and -beta to their receptors,
  which generates an activation signal that is propagated into the cell via the JAK/STAT
  pathway to enable the expression of numerous proteins with antiviral or immunomodulatory
  activity. Created with BioRender.com (accessed on 15 August 2022).
