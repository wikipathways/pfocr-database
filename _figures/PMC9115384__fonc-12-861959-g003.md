caption: 'Autophagy-mediated immune evasion of cancer cells: Knockdown of ATG7, or
  dominant negative expression of ATG4B or treatment of chloroquine leads to the inhibition
  of autophagy, which induces the accumulation of MHC-I on the surface of cancer cell.
  The MHC-I accumulation promotes the recognition and effect of CD8+ T cells on cancer
  cells. Likewise, inhibiting autophagy results in the infiltration of TAMs and the
  conversion of macrophages from M2 to M1 phenotype, thereby enhancing the antitumor
  activity. What is noteworthy is that impairment of LAP results in activation of
  T cells mediated by STING, producing granzyme B and IFN-γ to kill the cancer cells.
  In addition, the combination of PIK3C3/VPS34 inhibitors with anti-PD-1 and PD-L1
  therapy could increase the numbers of NK and CD8+, CD4+ T cells, macrophages and
  dendritic cells along with CCL5 and CXCL10 infiltrating in tumor environment. Moreover,
  SKIL promoted tumorigenesis and immune escape of NSCLC cells by up-regulating the
  TAZ/autophagy axis and inhibition on downstream STING pathway, thereby resulting
  in reducing T cell infiltration and release of chemokines including CXCL10, CCL5
  and IFN-β.'
