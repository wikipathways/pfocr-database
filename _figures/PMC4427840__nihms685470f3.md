caption: Pathway map of the histamine receptor response in dendritic cell. Many of
  the genes identified as significantly different in our dataset are involved in this
  pathway. These differentially expressed factors from experimental data are depicted
  as white columns with red bars, the height of the red bar is proportionate to the
  fold change as a result of TiO2 exposure in pregnant (left) vs normal (right) mice.
