caption: 'Interactive regulation of ferroptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic
  disorders in depression. This figure systematically illustrates the interactive
  regulatory network of ferroptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic disorders
  in the pathological process of depression. The Fe2+-driven Fenton reaction is the
  driving factor, which is amplified in a cascade through the following core pathways:
  (1) lipid peroxidation mediated by the ferroptosis pathway triggers membrane structural
  disruption, which triggers the accumulation of toxic aldehydes, such as 4-HNE; (2)
  mitochondrial damage hubs are characterized by ATP synthesis impairment and abnormalities
  in the AMPK/TSC1/2 regulatory axis, leading to energy metabolism remodeling; (3)
  the mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorders are also affected by the ferroptosis
  pathway. Key hubs of mitochondrial damage are characterized by ATP synthesis disorders
  and abnormalities in the AMPK/TSC1/2 regulatory axis, leading to energy metabolism
  remodeling. Catalytic amplifier exacerbates neurotransmitter synthesis disorders
  and oxidative stress through mTORC1–autophagy imbalance. These three factors cause
  synergistic damage through the ROS–inflammatory positive feedback loop, ultimately
  leading to impaired synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter homeostasis imbalance,
  constituting a multidimensional pathophysiological hub for the development of depression'
