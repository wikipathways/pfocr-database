caption: 'The metabolic pathway analysis. (a) The main metabolic pathways according
  to the MetaboAnalyst. (b) Amino acid metabolism and (c) the level of metabolites
  involved in amino acid metabolism. (d) Lipid metabolism and (e) the level of metabolites
  involved in lipid metabolism. (f) Carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism and (g)
  the level of metabolites involved in carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism. The
  blue rectangle represents being downregulated in the eighth week, and the red rectangle
  represents being upregulated in the eighth week. In the expression of the level
  of metabolites, the ordinate represented the peak area. # indicates a significant
  change between the control and model groups: #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01; ∗ indicates
  a significant change between the model and SFE groups: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01.'
