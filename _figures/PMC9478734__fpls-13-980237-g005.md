  description: Tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and plastid gene expression with key enzymes.
    Retrograde signaling is mediated in part by tetrapyrrole intermediates. The different

    amount of “free” heme control the rate of ALA Synthesis. Protoporphyrin IX can

    branch is mediated by GUN6 (Fe-chelatase), GUN2 (heme oxygenase), and GUN3 (phytochromobilin
    synthase). Heme acts as a positive regulator of photosynthesis-associated nuclear
    genes (PhANGs), but the nuclear components involved in heme signaling, as well
