caption: Downregulated sphingolipid metabolism in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
  lungs. (A) Data for metabolic intermediates in the normal lung (NL) are shown in
  green boxes and data for IPF are represented in purple. Quantities are in arbitrary
  units specific to the internal standards for each quantified metabolite and normalised
  to protein concentration (n=8 for each box). Samples of patients with IPF exhibited
  lower levels of sphinganine, sphingosine and sphingomyelin. (B) The classical sphingolipid is
  shown. (C) Analysis of gene expression for key enzymes of the sphingolipids metabolism;
  data for control lung are shown in open blue boxes and data for IPF lung are represented
  in open green boxes (y-axis label of metabolic changes is shown as counts×106).
  The genes encoding sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) metabolic pathway showed downregulated
  sphingomyelinase (SMPD1 and SMPD4) as well as downregulated delta(4)-desaturase,
  sphingolipid 1 (DEGS1), suggesting a reduced ceramide production, and downregulated
  ACER3 (alkaline ceramidase 3) indicates reduced sphingosine and S1P production.
  Genes encoding DEGS1 (p=1.25e−10), ACER3 (p=2.08e−7), SMPD1 (p=2e−6) and SMPD4 (p=6.67e−14)
  were significantly changed in IPF lungs compared with normal (y-axis label for gene
  expression encoding enzymes is shown as fold changes of relative RNA levels of enzymes).
