caption: The possible mechanisms of lactate in exercise-induced positive effects on
  neuroplasticity and cerebrovascular plasticity. Exercise causes muscles to produce
  lactate, which is then released into the blood and passes through the BBB through
  different MCTs into the brain parenchyma. Meanwhile, astrocytes may also release
  lactate during exercise to supply the neural network in response to activated neurons.
  At the BBB of the microvasculature, lactate binds to HCAR1 to activate it and induces
  increased VEGF-A expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), angiogenesis,
  and neurogenesis of SVZ through an unidentified pathway. In hippocampal neurons,
  lactate is transported across the membrane by MCT, activating the SIRT1/PGC1-α/FNDC5/BDNF
  pathway through an unknown pathway, thereby improving neural plasticity.
