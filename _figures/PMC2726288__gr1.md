caption: DIF-1 biosynthetic pathway. The polyketide skeleton of DIF-1 is assembled
  by the StlB, ‘steely’, polyketide synthase, and then decorated by two successive
  chlorinations (where the chloroperoxidase is only known as an enzymatic activity)
  and a final methylation by the DmtA methyltransferase (). DIF-1 is further metabolized
  by mono-dechlorination to DIF-3 and then by successive hydroxylations/oxidations
  to yield around 10 further metabolites (). These metabolites are all much less active
  than DIF-1 in the stalk cell bioassay, but may conceivably have other activities
  in vivo.
