caption: The multiple effects of arsenic on insulin signaling are tissue-dependent.
  The alterations induced by arsenic exposure on the insulin signaling pathway are
  depicted with red font. Arsenic induces insulin resistance in classical insulin
  targeted organs. (A) In liver, arsenic reduces GLUT2 protein levels and reduces
  glycogen synthesis due to NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome
  activation. This also results in reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Also, it promotes liver lipogenesis and the development
  of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). (B) In muscle, arsenic inhibits GLUT4
  expression. It also reduces insulin signaling by inhibiting IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation,
  reducing insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and decreased glycogen levels, thus
  contributing to hyperglycemia in the postprandial state. Arsenic can also promote
  ectopic fat deposition in muscle. (C) In adipose tissue, this pollutant induces
  adipocyte hypertrophy, impaired adipogenesis, and suppression of mitochondrial biogenesis.
  Arsenic stimulates lipolysis, and oxidative stress due to reduced SIRT3 activity.
  On the other hand, it inhibits GLUT4 expression and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation
  by inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. Akt, protein kinase B; AS160, Akt substrate
