caption: Role of autophagy in spermatogenesis. (a) Role of mTORC1 in spermatogenesis.
  mTORC1, the main gate to autophagy, is crucial for spermatogonia stem cell (SCCs)
  proliferation, differentiation, meiotic progression, inactivation of sex chromosomes
  and spermiogenesis. Firstly, proliferation of SSCs requires phosphorylation of the
  mTORC1 component Raptor at Ser863. Secondly, conditional ablation of Raptor causes
  infertility due to meiotic arrest and impaired inactivation of sex chromosomes in
  the male germline. Thirdly, Rheb, a critical component for mTORC1 activation, is
  required for meiotic progression and spermiogenesis. Consistently, retinoic acid
  (RA), as a requisite driver of spermatogonia differentiation and entrance into meiosis,
  regulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to induce Kit translation during spermatogonial
  differentiation. In addition, Nanos2, an RNA-binding protein, interacts with mRNP
  to repress mTORC1 signaling by trapping mTOR, providing a post-transcriptional buffering
  system for SSCs homeostasis. Apart from germ cells, mTOR also plays a pivotal role
  in Sertoli cells. The regulation of Sertoli cell proliferation by FSH requires the
  PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway. Independent of the canonical Rheb/mTORC1 pathway, Raptor
  dominates Sertoli cell cytoskeletal organization and polarity by affecting cingulin
  expression and Rac1 activity. Consistently, mTOR regulates gap junction alpha-1
  (GJA1) distribution in Sertoli cells and is essential for progression through the
  pachytene spermatocyte stage. Finally, mTORC1 regulates spermatogenesis by inhibiting
  autophagy initiation and autophagosome nucleation. (b) Role of autophagy in spermiogenesis.
  In terms of the role of autophagy in spermiogenesis, autophagy-related genes participate
  in acrosome biogenesis, flagella assembly, head shaping and the removal of cytoplasm
  from elongating spermatids. 1. Acrosome biogenesis. TBC1D20 facilitates autophagy
  flux by its RAB1B GAP function, and regulates the formation of acrosome, which is
  a LRO. Sirt1 regulates spermiogenesis by stimulating autophagy. I. The depletion
  of Sirt1 disrupts LC3 and ATG7 deacetylation, provoking the redistribution of LC3
  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. II. Golgi-derived vesicles fail to recruit LC3.
  And III. nucleus-associated acrosomal vesicles are unable to recruit GOPC and PICK1.
  ATG7 not only partially targets GOPC to control acrosome biogenesis, but also motivates
  LC3, which initiates autophagy. 2. Flagella assembly, head shaping, cytoplasm removal.
  ATG7 is required for spermatozoa flagella biogenesis and cytoplasm removal during
  spermiogenesis. IFT20, as a Golgi transport protein, contributes to the formation
  of autophagosome by delivering ATG16L, and lysosome biogenesis by regulating the
  post-Golgi transport of acid hydrolases. SPEF2 is elementary for microtubule-mediated
  transport in axonemal CP assembly and sperm head shaping. IFT20 interacts with SPEF2
  to regulate the flagella. The autophagy-lysosome pathway regulates spermatid differentiation
  by degrading PDLIM1 to facilitate cytoskeleton organization. LRO, lysosome-related
  organelle; GOPC, Golgi-associated PDZ- and coiled-coil motif-containing protein;
  PDLIM1, PDZ and LIM domain 1; SPEF2, sperm flagellar 2.
