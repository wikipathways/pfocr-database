caption: Underlying mechanisms of LND-mediated antitumor activity. (1) LND inhibits
  the lactate export and the uptake of pyruvate into mitochondria by the inhibition
  of proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier
  (MPC), respectively. (2) LND inhibits complexes I and II by interfering with ubiquinone
  reduction, leading to ATP depletion and ROS production. (3) LND affects the mitochondrial
  permeability transition (PT) pore which is under the control of the members of the
  Bcl-2 family. (4) LND inhibits glycolysis through the inhibition of hexokinase II
  (HK-II), thereby reducing the levels of NADPH and glutathione (GSH) in part by the
  inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux.
