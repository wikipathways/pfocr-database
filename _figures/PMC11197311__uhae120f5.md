caption: 'Metabolic pathways and time-ordered gene expression of anthocyanin and flavonol
  biosynthesis in ZS5801 and ZZB. A Heat map illustrating gene expression values from
  RNA-seq data across fruit developmental stages (labeled S1–S5) for both cultivars.
  Genes are categorized into three groups: ‘flavonol biosynthesis’, ‘early anthocyanin
  biosynthesis’, and ‘late anthocyanin biosynthesis’. Key enzymes highlighted include
  4CL (4-Coumaric acid CoA ligase), ANS (anthocyanin synthase), AT (plant anthocyanidin
  transferase), C4H (cinnamate-4-hydroxylase), CHI (chalcone isomerase), CHS (chalcone
  synthase), DFR (dihydroflavonol reductase), F3H (flavanone 3-hydroxylase), F3’H
  (flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase), F3oGT (flavonol-3-oglucosyltransferase), FLS (flavonol
  synthase), GT (glycosyltransferases), PAL (phenylalanine ammonialyase). B Histogram
  displaying counts of enzyme families across anthocyanin, flavonol, and chlorophyll
  metabolic pathways, with categories labeled as ‘expanding’, ‘stable’, or ‘contractile’
  based on gene fraction criteria. C Count of genes within different metabolic pathways
  for anthocyanins, flavonols, and chlorophyll. D Phylogenetic tree depicting FLS
  and DFR gene families within the ZS5801 and ZZB genomes, with gene IDs distinctively
  marked for each cultivar'
