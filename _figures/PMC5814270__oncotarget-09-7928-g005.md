caption: (A) Leukemia inhibitory factor signaling pathway. The gene group (GO:0048861)
  was taken from Gene Ontology annotations analysis and related miRs from our screening.
  (B) Positive Regulation of Cyclin-dependent Protein Serine/threonine Kinase Activity
  Involved in G1/S Transition of Mitotic Cell Cycle. The gene group (GO:0031659) was
  taken from Gene Ontology annotations analysis. Up- and down regulated miRs were
  added to the network based on our screening. The charts are based on the STRING
  interaction database using all genes in these GO biological processes.
