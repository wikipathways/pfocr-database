caption: Proposed model of role of RNase L in crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis.
  Activation of RNase L by 2–5A induces autophagy as an early stress response by activating
  JNK and PKR and promoting complex formation of Beclin-1 with Vps34. When the stress
  levels exceed a threshold level, RNA cleavage products of RNase L activate caspase
  3 to cleave Beclin-1 to terminate autophagy to promote apoptosis. Translocation
  of the cleaved Beclin-1C and Bax to the mitochondria releases cytochrome C to the
  cytosol and enhances apoptosis. dsRNA like polyI:C activate caspase 3 through multiple
  pathways and induce apoptosis. Small dsRNA produced by RNase L participate in temporally
  regulated signaling pathway by promoting a switch from autophagy to apoptosis by
  targeting Beclin-1.
