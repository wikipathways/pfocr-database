caption: The Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. TLR ligation leads to the
  activation of NF-κB and MAPKs. Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88
  (MyD88), a key TLR adapter protein, associates with IL-1 receptor-associated kinase
  (IRAK)4, which, in turn, phosphorylates IRAK1. After its interaction with TNF receptor-associated
  factor (TRAF)6, the activated IRAK complex phosphorylates transforming growth factor-β-activated
  kinase 1/MAP3K-binding protein 1 (TAB1) and TGF-β-activated kinase-1, which activate
  NF-κB and MAPK pathways. MD-2, myeloid differentiation protein-2; IKK, IκB kinase.
