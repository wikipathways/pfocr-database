caption: Functional interactions network analysis of co-occurring mutations in pre-NAC
  samples. (A) A network of 246 nodes were obtained starting from co-occurred mutated
  genes (highlighted in red) using Biogrid protein-protein interaction data. (B) Most
  representative targeted signaling pathway (represented in violet) were obtained
  from Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases.
