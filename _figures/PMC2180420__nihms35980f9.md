caption: 'The two cell types are shown in the dashed rectangles as indicated. The
  ERK1/2 pathway shown in both cells is the classical pathway.When added to the co-cultures
  hCG binds to the LHR in MA-10 cells and stimulates cAMP accumulation using the classical
  Gs/adenylyl cyclase cascade. Cyclic AMP, acting through PKA, activates Ras (and
  the ERK1/2 cascade) by mechanisms that remain to be investigated (dashed line #1).
  The involvement of this pathway in the MA-10 cell ERK response and its lack of involvement
  in the I-10 cell ERK response is documented by the ability of PDE and PKI to inhibit
  only the hCG-induced ERK1/2 response when expressed in MA-10 cells and also by their
  inability to do so when expressed in I-10 cells.The binding of hCG to the LHR in
  MA-10 cells also activates Fyn by a pathway that remains to be investigated (dashed
  line #2). We propose that Fyn activates the proteolysis of the precursor forms of
  a growth factor (Pro-X, dashed line #3) leading to the release of soluble, diffusible
  forms of this factor (X) that then stimulates the EGFR in MA-10 cells and in I-10
  cells. The stimulated EGFR then activates Ras (and the ERK1/2 cascade) using the
  classical pathway involving the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. The involvement
  of Shc in both cell types is documented by the ability of DN-Shc to inhibit the
  hCG-induced ERK1/2 response when expressed in MA-10 cells or I-10 cells. The involvement
  of Fyn as an upstream activator of the release of soluble factors is documented
  by the ability of Dn-Fyn to inhibit the hCG-induced ERK1/2 response and the phosphorylation
  of the EGFR in I-10 cells only when it is expressed in MA-10 cells but not when
  it is expressed in I-10 cells. The involvement of the EGFR as a mediator of the
  hCG-induced ERK1/2 response is best documented by the inhibitory effect of the EGFR
  siRNA on the hCG-induced ERK1/2 response in MA-10 cells.The hCG-induced activation
  of the EGFR (and the ERK1/2 cascade) in I-10 cells could also involve juxtacrine
  signaling as shown by the juxtaposition of “Pro-X” in MA-10 cells and the EGFR in
  I-10 cells at the bottom of the two cell types.'
