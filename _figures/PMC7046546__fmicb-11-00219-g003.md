caption: Mechanisms of signaling due to A. muciniphila action in obesity. A. muciniphila
  can decrease the serum level of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-12p40,
  and MCP-1. Meanwhile, A. muciniphila decreases the lipid overload process associated
  with the LDL receptor pathway by decreasing apoB48 and apoB100 on LDLs. Moreover,
  short-chain fatty acid production stimulated by A. muciniphila is involved in signaling
  to the host by inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) or by activating G-protein-coupled
  receptors, which triggers other metabolic pathways, together resulting in immune
  stimulation including macrophage transmigration and Treg proliferation changes.
  A. muciniphila regulates the intestinal permeability and gut barrier by tight-junction
  proteins such as Claudin 3 (Cldn3), Occludi(Ocln), and Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (Cnr1)
  and reverses the high enzyme expression of flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3),
  which modulates TMA conversion into TMAO in the liver.
