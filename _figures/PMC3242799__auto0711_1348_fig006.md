caption: Proposed mechanism of DHA-induced autophagy and apoptosis in human cancer
  cells harboring wild-type p53. DHA-induced autophagic activation is mediated by
  the p53/AMPK/mTOR pathway and contributes to apoptotic cell death. DHA causes the
  phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 and activates AMPK by decreasing the expression
  of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This leads to inhibition of mTOR signaling,
  which negatively regulates autophagy, a process defined by the sequestration of
  bulk cytoplasm and organelles in autophagosomes and their subsequent lysosomal degradation.
  This p53-controlled autophagy induced by DHA decreases the viability of cancer cells
  harboring wild-type p53 by promoting apoptosis. Of note, other signaling cascades
  may also contribute to the apoptosis induced by DHA.
