caption: Model of the canonical Notch signaling pathway in mouse and human mammary
  gland epithelial cell development. The Notch pathway has dual functions in mammary
  gland epithelial cells. In basal cells, DLL1 and Notch1 are necessary to maintain
  the activity and self-renewal ability of MaSCs, and inhibition of Notch signaling
  leads to abnormal MaSCs expansion. In addition, Notch2/3/4 and Cbf1 could promote
  luminal progenitor cell differentiation towards the luminal cell lineage
