caption: Schematic description of the early Ca2+signaling pathway initiated by activated
  GPCRs. Activation of phospholipase (PLCβ) immediately downstream of an agonist-occupied
  GPCR is mediated either by the Gαq-subunit of the activated G protein (signaling
  to the left) or by the Gβγ subunit of Gαi-linked GPCRs (signaling to the right).
  PLC hydrolyzes PIP2 to generate DAG and IP3. Binding of IP3 to its receptor on the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in a release of Ca2+ from this storage organelle
  to the cytosol. A depletion of Ca2+ in the ER triggers an opening of store-operated
  Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane (to the far right and left), and a second wave
  of Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm. The Ca2+-dependent PKC may be activated by a combined
  effect of Ca2+ and DAG formed during hydrolysis of PIP2.
