caption: Type I cells release the excitatory neurotransmitter ATP following hypoxia-induced
  membrane depolarization. ATP excites afferent terminals via postsynaptic P2X2/3
  receptors. ATP may also activate P2Y2 receptors on neighbouring type II cells, leading
  to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ and opening of pannexin-1 channels. When open, pannexin-1
  channels cause further release of ATP, thereby boosting the excitatory signal. The
  inhibitory efferent pathway may also be activated by ATP acting on a variety of
  P2X receptors on nNOS-positive, autonomic terminals; stimulation of these P2X receptors
  leads to synthesis and release of NO, which in turn hyperpolarizes type I cells.
  Breakdown of extracellular ATP by ecto-5′-nucleotidase generates adenosine, which
  may also be transported directly from type I cells. Adenosine can further enhance
  excitatory pathways in the CB via presynaptic A2a and A2b receptors on type I cells,
  and postsynaptic A2a receptors on afferent terminals. Some of these receptors, as
  well as other paracrine pathways, have been omitted for clarity. Adapted from Piskuric
