caption: Islet QTLs that co-localize with T2D signals target distinct pathways. a
  STRING v11.5 was used to analyze 106 genes with sQTLs or eQTLs co-localizing with
  T2D or glycemic traits, including previously reported eQTLs. We only considered
  genes with known or presumed protein-coding function, and not exclusively expressed
  in non-endocrine cells according to single cell RNA-seq. We allowed for inflation
  of ≤ 5 interactors, and used default (>0.4) confidence scores. Shown are two networks
  with >3 components, one populated by components of heterotrimeric G protein signaling,
  and another by genes involved in eIF3 translational initiation. Genes are colored
  as indicated in the legend; other interactors added through STRING analysis are
  shaded gray. b Manual curation was used to illustrate the relationship between components
  of the G protein-mediated insulinotropic pathway targeted by islet QTLs linked to
  T2D and related traits
