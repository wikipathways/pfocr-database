caption: The protein–protein interaction (PPI) of identified 28 ERGs by STRING and
  Cytoscape software, and was also widened by adding 9 partners (BCL2L1, BCL2L11,
  HSP90AA1, TP53, MCL1, BAD, BIK, BECN1, and IGF1), which had similar physiological
  function with included DEGs. The intensity of the yellow genes relative with the
  chondrocyte apoptosis, and the PPI reveals that the 28 ERGs coded protein contributed
  to the chondrocyte apoptosis and cell death induced by the Ras, PI3K-Akt, and P53
  signaling pathway.
