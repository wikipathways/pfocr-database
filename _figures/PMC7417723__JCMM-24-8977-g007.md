caption: Proposed mechanisms for the protective effects of ATX against OGD‐induced
  apoptosis. The antiapoptotic effect of ATX is through the inhibition of oxidative
  stress. Our results demonstrated that up‐regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling‐mediated
  GSK3β inhibition enhances Nrf2 expression and nuclear translocation, which further
  activate downstream antioxidant enzyme expression. This activation is involved in
  the antioxidant action of ATX on OGD‐triggered oxidative damage in SH‐SY5Y cells
