caption: Upon stretch, activation of stretch-activated channels (SACs) and changes
  in diastolic and systolic myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (δMyo.) lead to alterations
  in action potential configuration (δAPD) and intracellular Ca2+ (δ[Ca2+]i). There
  follows interaction between changes in electrical activity and [Ca2+]i because of
  the voltage dependence of some calcium-regulating mechanisms (e.g. the Na+-Ca2+
  exchanger) and the Ca2+ dependence of certain ionic membrane currents (e.g. L-type
  calcium current, delayed rectifier K+ current and Na+-Ca2+ exchanger current). This
  pathway would be interrupted (-) by streptomycin by its action on SACs, by BAPTA
  via its action on [Ca2+]i and by action potential clamp (APclamp) via its stabilisation
  of action potential configuration.
