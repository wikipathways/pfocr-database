caption: 'Canonical Wnt signaling pathway. (a) Inactive Wnt signaling pathway (OFF):
  When there are no Wnt ligands bound to the frizzled protein (FZD), the multiprotein
  destruction complex (adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), the glycogen synthase kinase
  3β (GSK3β), axin, and the casein kinase 1α (CK1α)) that reside in the cytoplasm
  bind to and phosphorylate β-catenin, which leads to proteasomal degradation. This
  prevents the translocation of β-catenin in nucleus, where T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) alone halts the transcription of target genes. (b) Active
  Wnt Signaling pathway (ON): When there are Wnt ligands bound to the frizzled protein
  and LRP5/6 co-receptors, the destruction complex is inhibited and that allows for
  the accumulation and stabilization of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and subsequent
  translocation into the nucleus. The β-catenin-TCF/LEF complex drives the expression
  of target genes'
