caption: mTOR signaling components involved in mechanotransduction of cancer cells.
  mTOR pathway integrates signals from alterations of extracellular mechanical cues
  (e.g., mechanical stress, ECM stiffness). mTOR, along with its upstream regulators
  (PI3K, PTEN, Akt) and downstream substrates (S6K1, 4E-BP1), communicates with mechanotransduction
  pathways and tools, such as mechanosensitive ion channels, membrane receptors and
  ligands, integrins, proteins of focal adhesions (e.g., FAK and Src), components
  of the cytoskeleton, and mechano-induced transcription factors (YAP and TAZ). This
  interplay regulates autophagy and promotes EMT, angiogenesis, cell growth, cell
  survival, and drug resistance. EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; FAK, focal
  adhesion kinase; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; mTORC2, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin complex 2; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog; S6K1, ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1; 4E-BP1, eukaryotic
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; YAP, Yes-associated protein.
