caption: 'Effect of FXR activation on triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism in the
  liver. FXR agonists result in a variety of responses modulating triglyceride (TG)
  and cholesterol metabolism. Activation of FXR inhibits triglyceride (TG)/fatty acid
  (FA) synthesis facilitated by suppressing sterol regulatory element-binding protein
  1c (SREBP1c) via activation of short heterodimer partner (SHP). FXR controls assembly
  of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). FXR may increase the clearance of TG by
  stimulating lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity as well as the hepatic uptake of remnants
  and low-density lipoprotein by inducing syndecan 1 (SDC1) and the VLDL receptor
  (VLDLR). FXR agonists may modulate LDL receptor activity via inhibition of proprotein
  convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) and activate the reverse cholesterol transport
  pathway (RTC). FXR activation also impairs high-density lipoprotein (HDL) formation
  and suppresses cholesterol synthesis. apoA1, apoB, apoCII, apoCIII, apoAIV: apolipoprotein
