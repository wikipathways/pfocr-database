caption: Overview of the host light stress response and its impact on Dothideomycete-induced
  disease severity.  highlights the signalling pathway involved in the light stress
  response in the host (left) and the effect of high light (orange) and shade (grey)
  stresses on Dothideomycete-induced disease severity (right). Light intensity is
  perceived by UV-A/B photoreceptors, such as cryptochromes (CRYs), phototropins (PHOTs)
  and the UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8). Excess light leads to photoinhibition of the
  photosystem II (PSII), resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  in the chloroplasts. To prevent photoinhibition-associated damage, photoprotection
  mechanisms include cyclic electron flow (CEF), the xanthophyll cycle (violaxanthin-antheraxanthin-zeaxanthin
  cycle, VAZ), the photorespiratory pathway and ROS scavenging enzymes, such as ascorbate
  peroxidases (APXs), peroxiredoxins (PRXs) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). In response
  to high light, chloroplasts move away from the cell surface to reduce light absorption
  in a process known as chloroplast avoidance. In contrast, under low light conditions,
  chloroplasts accumulate near the cell surface.
