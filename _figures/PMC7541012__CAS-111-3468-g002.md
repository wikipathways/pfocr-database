caption: Roles of cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in cancer chemoresistance.
  CAFs affect anticancer resistance through various mechanisms, including secreted
  factors (red), the promotion of cancer stemness (orange), metabolic modulations
  (blue), and interference with immunotherapy (green). Upon stimulation with factors
  such as annexin A6, WNT16B, IL‐6, IL‐1β, IL‐8, and HGF, chemoresistance is enhanced
  via downstream pathways, including the STAT3, FAK‐YAP, NF‐κB and PI3K/p‐AKT signaling
  pathways. Stemness is increased by activation of ERK1/2, upregulation of GLI2, induction
  of IL‐6 and/or IL‐8 secretion from CD10+GPR77+ CAFs and activation of the SHH pathway.
  WNT5a also induces CAFs to produce stem cell niche factors. Furthermore, Ras signaling
  is facilitated by glutamine from CAFs through macropinocytosis, GFPT2 and HGF from
  CAFs reprograming cancer cells to engage in glycolysis, and GPER from cancer cells
  induced CAFs to produce lactate transporters that support cancer metabolism; all
  these activities eventually lead to drug resistance. Finally, CAFs polarize macrophages
  into the M2 phenotype, which suppress T cell activity. At the same time, CAFs secrete
  TGF‐β, PGE2, and IDO to alter the functions of NK cells and T cells
