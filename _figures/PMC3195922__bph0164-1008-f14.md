caption: Proposed signalling mechanism for the effects of kaempferol on LPS-induced
  neuroinflammation in BV2 cells. Activation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) with LPS
  leads to activation of IKK complex, and MAPKs and AKT pathways. The IKK complex
  phosphorylates IκB, which leads to the degradation of IκBα and the subsequent nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB. Similarly, p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylate and activate AP-1.
  Phosphorylation of AKT also leads to activation of NF-κB. Activation of NF-κB and
  AP-1 results in the expression and production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Kaempferol
  disrupts the neurotoxic pathway and protects against LPS-induced toxicity through
  inhibition of NF-κB, MAPKs and AKT signalling. IKK, inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB
  (IκB)-kinase; Kae, kaempferol.

  kinase B/AKT to elicit protection in a model of neuroinflammation in BV2 microglial
  cells.
