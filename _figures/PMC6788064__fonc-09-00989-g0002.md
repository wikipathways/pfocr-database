caption: Signaling pathways participating in the function of cadherins in cancer.
  (A) E-cadherin loss lead to the upregulation of β-catenin in cytoplasm. After Wnt
  binds to Frizzled, it blocks the effects of CK1α and GSK3 on β-catenin and cause
  the accumulation of β-catenin in cytoplasm and nucleus, which activates TCF/LEF
  and co-activators. N-cadherin could affect tumorigenesis through interacting with
  FGFR and stimulating MAPK/ERK pathway. (B) Wnt-β-catenin pathway also works in tumor
  progression like in (A). E-cadherin could also activate PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK pathways.
  N-cadherin activates Ras-MAPK pathway, TCF/LEF transcription factor, etc. P-cadherin
  could increase tumor migration through interacting with integrin. (C) In endothelial
  cells, VEGF-VEGFR2 activates VE-cadherin and Src, then leads to VE-cadherin phosphorylation
  on tyrosines, which would promote endothelial cell proliferation through PI3K/AKT
  signaling. ERK/MAPK signaling pathway would be stimulated without tyrosines phosphorylation.
  sN-cadherin induces by proteases could bind to FGFR and phosphorylates ERK to stimulate
  angiogenesis. (D) The Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway also works in immune cells,
  which stimulates anti-inflammatory macrophages and tolerogenic DCs. E-cadherin mediates
  anti-inflammatory activation of macrophages and DCs through PI3K/AKT and NF-κB.
