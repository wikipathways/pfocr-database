caption: Principal pathways/compounds that show significant changes after the two
  priming inducers. In priming experiments the stress is usually applied after 48
  hpt. Rows represent the general changes after this period of time. Red shows the
  accumulated compounds and blue rows show the depleted compounds/pathways. TCA compounds
  are the main source for the synthesis of other metabolites playing a major role
  in defense. These compounds belong to the octadecanoid pathway (fatty acids) and
  amino acids. Both pathways are divided in subsequent pathways and compounds that
  are important in defense signaling and decide the final output when the plant meet
  the stress.
