caption: 'Proposed mechanisms for hypoxia-induced vasodilation at rest and during
  exercise. During hypoxic exercise, nitric oxide (NO) is the final common pathway
  for the compensatory dilator response. Systemic epinephrine (E) release, acting
  via β-adrenergic receptors, contributes to the NO-mediated vasodilation at lower
  exercise intensities, but this β-adrenergic contribution decreases with increasing
  exercise intensity. ATP released from the red blood cell (RBC) and/or endothelial-derived
  prostacyclin (PGI2) remain attractive candidates for stimulating NO during higher
  intensity hypoxic exercise. Neuronal NOS and nitrate are also potential sources
  of NO generation and might be another contributor to compensatory vasodilation during
  hypoxic exercise. Adenosine receptor (ADO-R) activation does not appear to be a
  major source of NO production during hypoxic exercise. α1AR, α2AR, and β2AR: α1-,
  α2-, and β2-adrenergic receptors, respectively; NE, norepinephrine; PR, purinergic
  receptor; SNO-Hb, S-nitrosohemoglobin.'
