caption: Apoptosis include extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The first pathway needs
  to be initiated by activation of death receptors, such as TNF receptors or Fas receptors,
  and mediated by caspase-8, which is initiated by various microenvironmental perturbations.
  Intrinsic apoptosis is ignited by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
  (MOMP) that leads to the release of the mitochondrial proteins (e.g., cytochrome
  C, somatic (CYCS), diablo IAP-bindingmitochondrial protein (DIABLO, also known as
  Smac), and HtrA serine peptidase 2 (HTRA2) and subsequent activation of initiator
  caspase CASP9 [,].
