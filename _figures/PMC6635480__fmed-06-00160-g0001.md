caption: Targeting pathways and molecules in the treatment of NMSC. (A) Hedgehog signaling
  pathway. Activation of Hedgehog signaling is initiated by the cell-surface protein,
  SMO, which is inhibited by another cell-surface protein, PTCH1. Binding of the Hedgehog
  ligand to PTCH1 releases this inhibition and thereby activates the pathway. Mutations
  in PTCH1 result in loss of its inhibitory function, while mutations in SMO lead
  to constitutive signaling activation. Vismodegib and sonidegib are oral small molecule
  inhibitors of SMO, which block HH signaling activation. (B) Receptor tyrosine kinases
  and downstream MAPK and PI3-AKT signaling pathways. Aberrant overexpression or mutations
  of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR and HER2, cause activation of downstream
  signaling pathways, thus triggering several tumorigenic processes, including cell
  proliferation, cell survival, and resistance to apoptosis. The monoclonal antibodies,
  cetuximab and panitumumab, and the oral small molecules, gefitinib and erlotinib,
  inhibit the activity of EGFR. The monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, inhibits the
  activity of HER2. (C) Interaction between T cells and tumor cells via the PD-1/PD-L1
  axis. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction inhibits activation of T cell functions, including
  Th1 cytokine secretion, T cell proliferation, and cytotoxicity. Inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1
  interaction with the anti-human PD-L1 antibody, avelumab, and anti-human PD-1 antibodies,
  nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and cemiplimab, releases these inhibitions and thereby
  activates the cytotoxic effects of T cells on tumor cells.
