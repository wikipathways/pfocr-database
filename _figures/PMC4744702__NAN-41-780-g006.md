caption: Simplified schematic of the somatosensory thalamus. In the lemniscal pathway,
  neurons in the principal trigeminal nucleus project to the dorsomedial section of
  the thalamic ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPMdm), which in turn projects to
  the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), where they terminate in ‘barrels’, dense
  clusters of small neurons in layer IV. In the extralemniscal pathway, neurons in
  the caudal part of the interpolar spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5I) are clustered
  into whisker‐related barreletes and project to the ventrolateral domain of the VPM
  (VPMvl). The axons of VPMvl neurons project to the septa between the barrels of
  S1 and to the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). In the paralemniscal pathway,
  neurons in the rostral part of the interpolar spinal trigeminal nucleus project,
  among other targets, to the medial sector of the posterior nucleus (PO) and to the
  zona incerta (ZI). The axons of PO neurons project to layer V of S1, S2 and to the
  primary motor cortex (MC). The ventral posterior lateral (VPL), receives inputs
  from gracile and cuneate nuclei and projects to ‘barrels’ in the somatosensory cortex.
  The medial lemniscal and pyramidal tracts are indicated in blue near the ventral
  surface at each rostrocaudal location. Anatomical schemes (from Paxinos & Watson)
  show the regions specified on the map of sections in different rostrocaudal positions
  relative to bregma.
