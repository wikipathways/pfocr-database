caption: Redox regulation of metabolism and bioenergetics. Mitochondria are essential
  for aerobic respiration and ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation, facilitated
  by the ETC, which consists of four core complexes (I, II, III, and IV) and coenzyme
  Q (CoQ). Electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [reduced form] (NADH)
  and flavine adenine dinucleotide, reduced (FADH2) are sequentially transferred through
  these complexes, ultimately reducing oxygen to form water; however, electron leakage
  at complex I and III can lead to the generation of ROS such as O2•− and H2O2. ROS
  produced by complex III can stabilize the transcription factor HIF1α, enhancing
  cellular adaptation to hypoxic conditions. The intracellular antioxidant system,
  comprising enzymatic antioxidants such as SOD, CAT, plays a critical role in mitigating
  excess ROS and maintaining redox balance. Additionally, the activity of ETC complexes
  and the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics through fission and fusion events are
  pivotal in modulating ROS production. Beyond their role in ROS generation, these
  reactive species are vital in regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism by activating
  or inhibiting pathways, such as AMPK and various metabolic processes, thereby influencing
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), fatty acid β‐oxidation, and mitochondrial
  biogenesis. Together, these mechanisms are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial
  function and optimizing cellular energy homeostasis. This figure was created with
