caption: 'This proposed pathway is simultaneously initiated and performed within nuclei
  and mitochondria. Inside the nuclei, the E2-activated ERα and/or ERβ bind to the
  EREs and other relevant regulatory elements present in the promoter regions of several
  key transcription factors including NRF-1, NRF-2 and PGC-lα and activates their
  transcription. The increased expression of these transcriptional factors, in turn,
  stimulate the cooperate expression of nuclear genes encoding: A) a number of proteins
  factors involved in the replication, transcription and translations of mtDNA; B)
  the MRC proteins and MRC complex assembly proteins and C) several proteins of mitochondrial
  protein import machinery. These proteins are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes,
  and imported into mitochondria via the mitochondrial protein import machinery. The
  enhanced expression of proteins of mitochondrial import machinery facilitates the
  mitochondrial import of proteins involved in the replication- transcription-translations
  of mtDNA, the nDNA-encoded MRC proteins and MRC complex assembly proteins, along
  with other mitochondrially localized proteins. Within mitochondria, the protein
  factors involved in mtDNA replication stimulate mtDNA replication and maintain/protection
  of mtDNA integrity. On the other hand, ERα and/or ERβ are imported into mitochondria.
  Once inside the mitochondria, E2 enhances their binding to the mtEREs within the
  regulatory region (i.e. D-loop) of mtDNA, to form the active transcription complexes
  in association with the transcriptional factors (e.g. Tfam, TFBIM and TFBIIM) and
  stimulating mtDNA transcription. The enhanced levels of protein factors involved
  in translation of mitochondrial mRNAs stimulate the translation of thirteen mtRNAs
  encoding MRC proteins. Both the newly imported, nDNA-encoded MRC subunits and the
  newly synthesized, mtDNA-encided MRC protein subunits are increasingly assembled
  into individual MRC complexes and ATP synthase by the increased MRC complex assembly
  proteins, resulting in increased MRC biogenesis and functions. The consequences
  of these processes are the increased production of mitochondrial energy in form
  of ATP and MRC-derived ROS. NRF-1, NRF-2, PGC-lα and Sp1 are the master players
  involved in the regulation of the majority of proteins and important factors involved
  in almost all aspects of MRC protein biogenesis. E2 and ERs act as the key “directors”
  for the entire pathway.The normal operation of this pathway is of physiological
  importance for the proper functions of a number of cell types and organs. Persistent
  over-stimulation or deficiency of E2/ER-mediated MRC biogenesis and functions can
  cause alterations in mitochondrial functions, resulting in over-abundance or deficiency
  of ATP and ROS. The changes in ATP and ROS levels and abnormal mitochondrial functions
  can also trigger retrograde regulation (e.g. redox-sensitive regulation) of the
  expression of nuclear genes involved a wide variety of physiological processes including
  oxidative response signaling pathways, various kinase-mediated pathways, cell cycle-related
  pathways and cell growth/death-related pathways. The combination of these E2/ER-mediated
  mitochondrial effects and the resulting retrograde regulation of expression of different
  types of nuclear genes have a number of physiological implications in different
  types of cells and organs. Persistent induction of these mitochondrial effects can
  exist in breast cells due to relatively higher levels of E2 and ERs in these cells,
  leading to over-abundance of these effects, which may contribute to increased cell
  proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis as well as resistance to anti-cancer drugs.
  These effects are relevant to estrogen-mediated carcinogenesis in human breast.
  On the other hand, stimulation of MRC biogenesis/functions by E2 and ERs are highly
  beneficial for providing the cells in brain, heart and the eye with sufficient MRC-derived
  energy for their proper functions. Maintenance of cell survival and inhibition of
  induced-apoptosis by E2/ER-mdiated MRC biogenesis and functions in neurons in brain,
  cardiomyocytes in heart and lens cells in the eye confer significant protection
  against AD and PD, heart diseases and the eye diseases (e.g. cataract formation).'
