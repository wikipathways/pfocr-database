caption: Autophagic control of Toxoplasma gondii. (A) CD40 induced autophagy during
  Toxoplasma infection. Toxoplasma enters into host macrophages via an active invasion
  process, the parasite resides in the host cytosol within a parasitophorous vacuole
  (PV). Host autophagy pathways are induced against Toxoplasma via interactions between
  CD40 expressed on the cell surface of infected macrophages and CD4+ T cells expressing
  CD154 (). CD40/CD154 ligation leads to recruitment of TRAF6 to CD40 which triggers
  increased TNFα secretion (; ). CD40 mediated ULK1 activation and TNFR2 mediated
  JNK/Beclin-1 activation leads to the formation of a double membraned autophagosome
  around the Toxoplasma PV (). The host’s autophagic response is actively inhibited
  by the Toxoplasma derived protein MIC which activates host EGFR which in turn activates
  PI3K leading to activation of the autophagy suppressor protein AKT (). Toxoplasma
  is destroyed by recruitment of Rab7 and LAMP1 and the subsequent fusion the PV with
  lysosomes (). The pathway depicted to the left of the dashed line is found in unstimulated
  and CD40-stimulated cells. (B) IFNγ induced autophagy during Toxoplasma infection.
  (I) In mouse cells stimulated with IFNγ the Toxoplasma PVM is disrupted by recruitment
  of GKS-motif containing Immunity Related GTPases (GKS IRG) and Guanylate Binding
  Proteins (GBPs) to the outer surface of the PVM (; ; ; ). Disruption of the PV leaves
  the parasite exposed to attack by host autophagy pathways, characteristic autophagosomes
  (double membrane, LC3 decorated) form leading to destruction and digestion of the
  parasite (). (II) In human cells, the mechanisms responsible for IFNγ mediated destruction
  of Toxoplasma via autophagy are less well-known. Instead of disrupting the PVM,
  human cells target it with ubiquitination which leads to the subsequent recruitment
  of ubiquitin binding proteins, e.g., p62 and NDP52. Recruitment of p62 and NDP52
  leads to autophagosome formation around the PV via an unknown process which leads
  to restriction of parasite growth within the cell (; ).
