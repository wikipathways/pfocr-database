caption: Scheme representing the metabolic scenario in wheat endosperm involving np-Ga3PDHase
  and SnRK1. Suc transported through the phloem enters the heterotrophic cell to provide
  carbon and energy requirements. Glc6P, positioned in the middle, is a key point
  of carbon partitioning in wheat endosperm metabolism. Glc6P can be transported inside
  the plastid to fuel carbon reserve synthesis (mainly starch) or alternatively the
  OPPP metabolism. Alternatively, Glc6P can be metabolized in the cytosol by oxidation
  through the glycolytic pathway or an incomplete OPPP. Glycolysis cans supply energy
  and building blocks for anabolic routes as well as to fuel carbon for respiration
  inside the mitochondria. In the cytosolic pathway, triose-P partitioning is a key
  metabolic step where Ga3P can be used to produce ATP or NADPH. HPT, Hexose-P translocator
  of the plastid envelope; XPT, xylulose-5-P translocator of the plastid envelope;
  PGK, 3PGA kinase; Ga3PDHase, phosphorylating Ga3P dehydrogenase; PK, pyruvate kinase;
  SnRK1, SNF-1 related protein kinase 1.
