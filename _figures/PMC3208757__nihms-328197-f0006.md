caption: A, In the presence of Pak-1, ISO stimulation of the β-adrenercic receptor
  activates protein kinase A (PKA) signaling via activation of heterotrimeric G protein
  (α, β, and γ) and adenylate cyclase (AC). Also, ISO stimulation of the β-adrenercic
  receptor activates Erk1/2 signaling pathway via β-arrestin-mediated transactivation
  of the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (EGFr). Active PKA activates Pak-1 by promoting
  Pak-1 autophosphorylation; in turn, active Pak-1 mediates PP2A conformational change
  and autodephosphorylation leading to PP2A activation. The now active PP2A induces
  dephosphorylation and reduced activation of Erk1/2, resulting in attenuation of
  cardiac hypertrophy. B, In the absence of Pak-1, Pak-1/PP2A-mediated inhibition
  of Erk-1/2 is lost (//), resulting in enhanced, Erk1/2-mediated cardiac hypertrophy.
  The dotted line proposes a potential PKA-mediated mechanism through which PP2A phosphorylation
  and inactivation may occur when Pak-1 is absent.
