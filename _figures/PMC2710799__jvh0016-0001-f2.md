caption: Schematic representation of the HCV replication cycle and steps that can
  be addressed with the various cell culture systems. Upon binding to a permissive
  host cell [], HCV particles enter the cell most likely by receptor-mediated endocytosis
  []. The RNA genome is liberated into the cytoplasm and translation occurs at the
  ER membrane []. Upon processing of the polyprotein, the membranous replication complex
  is formed (membranous web; MW). [] This complex is the site of viral RNA amplification.
  Positive strand RNA progeny is encapsidated [] and virus particles appear to be
  released from the cell by the constitutive secretory pathway []. Steps of the replication
  cycle that can be studied with HCVpp, replicons or the HCVcc system are indicated
  by shaded areas or the outer box respectively. Scheme from Darius Moradpour with
  slight modifications.
