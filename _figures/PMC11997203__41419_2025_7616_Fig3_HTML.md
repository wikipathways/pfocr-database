caption: This figure illustrates the pivotal role of PIPn signaling in regulating
  cell proliferation and migration through its interaction with IFs. Activation of
  cell-surface receptors triggers the production of PIPns (e.g., PtdIns4P, PtdIns(4,5)P2,
  PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), leading to AKT activation. This activation prompts AKT to phosphorylate
  PKP1, causing it to disengage from desmosomal IFs and diminishing cell adhesion.
  The phosphorylated PKP1 then interacts with 14-3-3γ, which fosters cell proliferation
  and migration. The stimulation of S6K and inhibition of 4E-BP by mTORC1-mediated
  phosphorylation downstream of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway promote protein synthesis
  by influencing the eIF4 complex. The phosphorylation of PKP1 enhances eIF4 activity,
  which relaxes the complex structures in the 5’-UTR of mRNA, leading to increased
  protein production and cell growth. Within the nucleus, Lamin A/C interacts with
  PtdIns(4,5)P2, likely generated through the sequential actions of nuclear class
  I PITPα/β, PI4KIIα, and PIPKIα. The binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2 promotes the phosphorylation
  of Lamin A/C, leading to the formation of a complex with NM1. This complex activates
  RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription, thereby driving cell proliferation. This
