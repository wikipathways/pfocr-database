caption: SARS-CoV-2-infection-induced injury to the renal tubular cells. Patients
  with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are more likely to have high suPAR levels. In renal
  tubular cells, suPAR can bind to integrin β6 and activate Rac1 leading to the formation
  of versican V1. suPAR also affects proximal tubular cells, altering mitochondrial
  respiration and inducing oxidative stress. Patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection
  are also more likely to use C3. The increased generation of C3a in severe COVID-19
  is accompanied by the release of activated CD16+ cytotoxic T cells. C3a promotes
  the transcription of versican by activating the AKT/β-catenin pathway. Tubular cell-derived
  versican V1 induces proliferation and collagen synthesis by activating the CD44/Smad3
  pathway in fibroblasts. Briefly, C3a and suPAR can drive versican V1 expression
  in tubular cells, which contributes to fibrosis of renal interstitial tissues.
