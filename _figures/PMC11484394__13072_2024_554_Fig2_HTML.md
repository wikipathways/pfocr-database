caption: Diagram illustrating the regulation of the p53 pathway by miRNAs in prostate
  cancer (WP3982). The figure depicts how elevated levels of specific miRNAs affect
  the p53 signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells. Key elements shown include the
  targeted genes within the p53 pathway, the interactions between miRNAs and these
  genes, and the overall impact on pathway activity. For a detailed view of the pathway,
  refer to (https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP3982.html)
