caption: Protein-protein interaction networks were analyzed among differentially abundant
  proteins. A total of 47 DEPs from 21 immune system-related pathways in the Cp96-vs-Np96
  group with P-value <0.05 and Pearson >∣0.90∣are chosen for network display. The
  yellow nodes in the network represent the top 15 immune-related proteins based on
  Pearson correlation
