caption: 'Molecular and cellular signaling pathways of nucleotide-binding domain,
  leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 in obesity, diabetes,
  and other metabolic diseases. In adipose tissue, interferon (IFN)-g and tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF)-α secreted from T helper (Th) 1 cells can promote macrophage differentiation
  from M2 to M1 phenotype. M1 macrophage infiltration results in the activation of
  nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway to induce nucleotide-binding
  domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) priming.
  Simultaneously, calcium influx and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production can
  increase the recruitment of more macrophages. In addition, excessive levels of TNF-α
  and free fatty acids (FFAs) can activate the NF-kappaB signaling leading to NLRP3
  priming and activation. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OX-LDL) and short-chain
  fatty acid (SFA) can bind with CD36 to accelerate the release of cathepsin causing
  the NLRP3 activation. Lipids such as palmitate, ceramides, and cholesterol can interact
  with toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/4 to inactivate the adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, resulting in mitochondrial ROS and NLRP3 activation.
  Additionally, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-associated imbalance of Na+, Ca2+, and
  K+ also contributes to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 activation
  raises the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, which increases insulin resistance and
  decreases glucose uptake. The cartoons in this figure were prepared using Biorender
