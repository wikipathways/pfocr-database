caption: Ribosome biogenesis serves as a therapeutic target for treating endometriosis.
  The ribosome biogenesis machinery in cells determines energy homeostasis, which
  is critical to maintain cell growth and proliferation. Endometriosis-induced inflammatory
  cytokines, e.g., IL-1β and TNF-α, can activate PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling [], which
  subsequently promotes RNA polymerase I-mediated rRNA transcription and editing/processing,
  resulting in continuous cell growth. Development of endometriotic lesions in peritoneal
  cavity triggers long-term inflammation and neuron fiber formation, leading to chronic
  pelvic pain. Up-regulation of ribosome biogenesis by endometriosis-related effectors,
  such as SNORD116, RPLP2 and RPL38 [], may speed up the whole process and provide
  sufficient energy for further aggressive progression. Blockage of ribosome biogenesis
  by inhibitors against PI3K/mTOR or RNA polymerase-1 can cause genometoxic shock
  due to energy shortage and ribosomal protein imbalance, leading to cell cycle arrest
  and apoptosis via p53/p21 pathway.
