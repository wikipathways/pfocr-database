caption: Schematic indicating dynamics between host cell metabolism and the chlamydial
  response to iron starvation, IFNγ, and antibiotics acting on peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
  Rectangles with blue gradient represent aberrant body (AB) inducers. Following host
  cell immune response by interferon gamma (IFNγ), the cytoplasmic tryptophan pool
  is depleted by the indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzyme (IDO) [59]. The absence of
  tryptophan then activates glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β), an enzyme that
  initiates host cell c-Myc degradation [39]. The consequence of this is a decreased
  production of glutaminases and glutamine transporters necessary for the TCA cycle
  to function. In addition to this reduced function, glycolysis is slowed down resulting
  in a decrease in pyruvate production [39]. Therefore, there may not be sufficient
  pyruvate necessary for bactoprenol synthesis by the methylerythritol (MEP) pathway
  [87]. Bactoprenol is an essential compound of the bacterial peptidoglycan ring,
  so without it, division is halted, leading to the production of aberrant bodies.
  If there is a lack of tryptophan (Trp) available, the trpRBA operon, which is normally
  repressed by both TrpR and YtgR, is activated. TrpR repression is released due to
  the absence of the necessary tryptophan cofactor while YtgR repression stops because
  there is not enough tryptophan available to assemble the unstable 3xTrp motif in
  its sequence [32]. To counteract the effects of tryptophan deprivation, tryptophan-rich
  chlamydial proteins are degraded to refill the pool of bacterial tryptophan, which
  is sequestered from the host cell and isolated from IDO [62]. During iron stress,
  proliferation-favorable homeostasis is disrupted. The absence of free ferrous iron
  prevents the synthesis of peptidoglycan (PG) via the blockage of the MEP pathway
  due to the lack of two iron-dependent enzymes, IspH and IspG [88]. The ytgABCD operon
  then becomes activated due to the lack of a [Fe2+] cofactor which is required for
  YtgR-mediated repression [32]. While the chlamydial response allows an increase
  to the pools of tryptophan and of free iron, this compensation might not be sufficient
  to completely overcome the stress. Phosphomycin and glycopeptide antibiotics such
  as vancomycin and teicoplanin induce aberrant bodies by affecting directly the peptidoglycan
  synthesis pathway [13,76]. Penicillin derivatives target penicillin binding proteins
  (PBP) to prevent the peptidoglycan division ring from expanding or constricting
  [76]. Together, this may create a new metabolic equilibrium that allows bacterial
  survival at the cost of proliferation
