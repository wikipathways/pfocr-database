caption: 'NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) can
  be activated in a canonical (left) or non-canonical (right) pathway to stimulate
  or repress the expression of genes involved in the regulation of cellular response
  to stress, immune response, and inflammation. Either pathway is initiated by a ligand
  bound by its receptor. Some autophagy proteins can be related to both pathways,
  as discussed in . This figure is a simplified representation only and does not contain
  many important details. IKB (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer
  in B cells inhibitor); IKK: IκB kinase; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; NIK:
  NF-κB-inducing kinase; TNFR: tumor necrosis factor receptor; ROS: reactive oxygen
  species. Subunits of NF-κB are shaded with the same, light fiolet color. Sharp arrows
  represent stimulation/induction, while blunt arrows: inhibition/downregulation,
  dashed oval: the nucleus.'
