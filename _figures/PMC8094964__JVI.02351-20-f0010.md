caption: Model depicting viral infection promotion by DDIT3-OTUD1-MAVS pathway activation
  during BVDV infection. The upregulated expression of DDIT3 caused by BVDV infection
  induced increased levels of OTUD1 expression by activating NF-κB, thereby promoting
  the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1. Smurf1 promoted the ubiquitination
  of MAVS, thereby blocking signal transmission by antiviral signaling pathways and
  inhibiting the expression of IFN-I and ISGs.
