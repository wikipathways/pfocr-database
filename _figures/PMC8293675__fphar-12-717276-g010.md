caption: CAV1 attenuated APAP-induced liver injury in NAFLD associated with suppressing
  oxidative stress by activating AMPK/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. APAP exacerbated oxidative
  stress in NAFLD, leading to increased lipid deposition and liver damage. It is known
  that Nrf2 binds to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1) and locates in the
  cytoplasm under physiological conditions. The activation of AMPK mediated by CAV1
  could promote Nrf2 to dissociate from the complex and subsequently enters to the
  nucleus to enhance the expression of antioxidant enzymes in the cell. Thus, CAV1
  attenuated APAP-induced liver injury in NAFLD associated with oxidative stress and
  fat accumulation by activating AMPK/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.
