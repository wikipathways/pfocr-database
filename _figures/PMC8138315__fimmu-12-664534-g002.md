caption: Bioinformatics workflow designed for the pathway enrichment analysis. Starting
  from a miRNA panel (A), dysregulated miRNAs (B) are taken into account for obtaining
  a list of validated miRNA-target pairs (C) from the miRTarBase database. Then, the
  miRNA-target interactions are arranged as a network (D), and genes that are targeted
  by at least a significant number of miRNAs (E) are selected for pathway enrichment
  analysis (F). Finally, enriched pathways are clustered according to their hierarchical
  relationships (as defined in the Reactome database), and the most representative
  pathways (G) are given.
