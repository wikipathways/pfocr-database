caption: Figure 1. Defective CFTR disrupts BECN1 PtdIns3K activity and impairs clearance
  of CF-associated pathogens. Mutations in the CFTR/cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator drive increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) and calcium (Ca2+) leading to increased small ubiquitin-like modification
  (SUMO)ylation of TGM2/ transglutaminase 2. This SUMOylation prevents ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation of the protein, leading to greatly enhanced TGM2 activity,
  which in turns feeds back to drive ROS production. Increased TGM2 also promotes
  crosslinking of the BECN1/Beclin-1 phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PtdIns3K) complex
  leading the generation of BECN1, SQSTM1, HDAC6/histone deacetylase 6 and ubiquitin
  positive aggresomes. Accumulation of BECN1 in aggresomes results in a functional
  sequestration of the PtdIns3K complex that prevents ER translocation necessary for
  the initiation of autophagy, or phagosome localization necessary for LC3-associated
  phagocytosis (LAP). Upon entering the cell, P. aeruginosa can become targeted to
  the autophagy pathway through yet uncharacterized mechanisms. LAP may also play
  a role in the clearance of intracellular P. aeruginosa bacteria. Following phagocytosis
  B. cepacia, H. influenzae and NTM persist within the phagocytic/endocytic pathway
  where they actively inhibit lysosomal fusion with bacteria containing vesicles.
  In healthy macrophages, B. cepacia containing vacuoles are targeted to the autophagy
  pathway for degradation. A similar mechanism is involved in the clearance of M.
  tubercuolosis, which employs the same intracellular life cycle as NTMs. However
  whether or not NTMs are specifically targeted for degradation by the autophagy pathway
  remains undefined. Similarly, the role of autophagy in the clearance of intracellular
  H. influenzae remains unknown. Following phagocytosis, the degradation of A. fumigatus
  spores requires LAP for effective lysosomal degradation. Unlike the other common
  CF-associated pathogens, S. aureus escapes from the phagosome upon entering the
  cell. Cytosolic bacteria, or bacteria contained within damaged phagosomes are subsequently
  targeted to the autophagy pathway where they inhibit lysosomal fusion, creating
  a replicative niche for the bacteria.
