caption: Proposed interactions between progesterone receptor (PR) and β-catenin signaling
  during alveologenesis. In the normal virgin mammary gland, PR induces a non-uniform
  PR expression pattern and competence to respond to β-catenin in alveolar progenitors
  (blue) during ductal maturation. During early pregnancy, PR-Wnt4 signaling induces
  expansion of ductal progenitors (yellow) to form side-branches through βcatenin-independent
  routes. PR and PRL (prolactin) cooperate to induce alveologenesis, a process that
  is β-catenin-dependent. Later in pregnancy, PR restrains and PRL promote alveolar
  differentiation. β-catenin is required for alveologenesis and may participate at
  multiple steps in the secretory differentiation pathway.
