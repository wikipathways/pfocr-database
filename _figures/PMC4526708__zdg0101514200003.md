  leading to a failure of adaptive responses to contractile activity. Excess hydrogen
  peroxide generated by mitochondria in the muscle during aging may influence the
  pathway shown in A at multiple points: prevention of activation of NADPH oxidase;
  a chronic increase in cytosolic hydrogen peroxide; aberrant chronic oxidation of
  glutathione and other redox sensitive signaling proteins; oxidation of the nuclear
  environment leading to a failure of TF to activate transcription. AP1, activator
  protein-1; HSF1, heat shock factor-1; Nrf2, nuclear transcription factor erythroid
