caption: 'Overview of Intermediary Metabolism in the Heart. The myocardium is capable
  of oxidizing diverse sources of energy such as lactate, glucose, glycogen, ketones
  and fatty acids of various chain lengths and degrees of saturation. Four groups
  of reactions, or pathways, support this process: beta-oxidation, glycolysis, the
  pentose phosphate pathway, and the citric acid cycle. In spite of this complexity,
  these pathways are linked by a relatively small number of key molecules. Consequently,
  the rate of appearance of hyperpolarized 13C in lactate or CO2 from [1-13C]pyruvate
  will be sensitive to flux in both beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle. Abbreviations:
  LAC, lactate; PYR, pyruvate.'
