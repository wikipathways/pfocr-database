caption: A schematic diagram summarizing the possible involvement of the GnIH system
  in endocrine axes and peripheral regulation. In the HPG axis (gray), GnIH neuronal
  fibers project to kisspeptin neurons and GnRH neurons in the hypothalamus, as well
  as to gonadotropes in the pituitary. The Gαi-coupled GnIH-Rs specifically inhibit
  the AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, as demonstrated by in vitro GnRH neuron and gonadotrope
  models. In interactions with the HPA axis (yellow), stress-induced GC (high GC)
  can directly activate GnIH neurons via GR, leading to reproductive dysfunction.
  In interactions with the HPT axis (green), hypothalamic GnIH expression is increased
  by hypothyroidism (low TH), resulting in delayed puberty, whereas it is decreased
  by hyperthyroidism (high TH). In metabolic regulation by the GnIH system, GnIH has
  an orexinergic effect to increase food intake, possibly through regulating the activity
  of POMC and NPY neurons in the hypothalamus, as GnIH neuronal fibers make direct
  contact with these neurons. The GnIH system is also found in various peripheral
  tissues, such as adipose tissue, pancreas, GI tract, liver, and skeletal muscle,
  suggesting its involvement in the control of metabolic processes beyond reproduction.
