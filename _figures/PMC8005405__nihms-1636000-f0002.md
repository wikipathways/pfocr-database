caption: Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) display several mechanisms that function to maintain
  low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). LSCs reside in the hypoxic bone marrow
  niche, limiting oxidative stress. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), essential to
  the cellular response to hypoxia, are activated even in normoxia in LSCs and niche
  factors such as thrombopoietin (TPO) and stem cell factor (SCF) promote HIF stabilization.
  FOXO transcription factors also maintain low ROS levels by regulating mitochondrial
  expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and glutamine synthetase. Glutamine, along
  with cysteine, is critical to the production of glutathione, which scavenges free
  radicals and other ROS. FOXO TFs are also required for autophagy and mitophagy,
  which mitigates oxidative stress through removal of toxic proteins and damaged mitochondria.
  AMP kinase (AMPK), which upregulates mitochondrial fission regulator FIS1 and therefore
  mitophagy, is intrinsically activated in LSCs. The PML-PPARδ-FAO pathway, upregulated
  in LSCs, also promotes mitophagy.
