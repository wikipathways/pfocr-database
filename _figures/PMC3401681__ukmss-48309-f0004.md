caption: Synergy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-delivered
  anticancer agents. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy cause DNA damage and cancer cell
  apoptosis by the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, whereas TRAIL leads to cancer cell
  apoptosis by the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can
  enhance the TRAIL sensitivity of cancer cells by (1) activating caspase cleavage;
  (2) inhibiting apoptotic inhibitors (eg, c-Flice-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP));
  and (3) increasing TRAIL receptor number and their location within the lipid raft.
  Radiotherapy can increase the homing of systemically-delivered MSCs to tumours by
  increasing (4) MSC chemokine receptor expression and (5) chemokine release by the
  tumours.
