caption: WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway in adrenal tumorigenesis. (A) In the absence
  of Wnt ligands, b-catenin is phosphorylated by a complex composed of GSK3b, CK1,
  APC, and AXIN. This phosphorylation targets b-catenin to proteosomal degradation,
  thus preventing its nuclear translocation. In this context, the T cell-specific
  factors (Tcf)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (Lef) represses target genes expression
  through association with transcriptional inhibitors. Secreted frizzled related proteins
  (SFRP) can inhibit extracellular Wnt signaling. (B) When WNT signaling is active,
  binding of Wnt ligands to their receptor complex (Frizzled/LRP5/6) induces the recruitment
  of Disheveled (Dsv) to the cytoplasmic domain of Frizzled and the phosphorylation
  of the cytoplasmic tail of LRP5/6 by CK1 and GSK3b. This induces delocalization
  of Axin to LRP5/6 and sequestration of the degradation complex. b-catenin degradation
  is, thus, reduced and it accumulates. Accumulated b-catenin enters the nucleus,
  binds to LEF/TCF transcription factors, and activates transcription of target genes.
  Mutations in several members of WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway have been identified
  in adrenal hyperplasias, adenomas, and carcinomas. Several mouse models have been
  developed to induce constitutive β-catenin activation either through adrenal cortex
  specific loss of Apc () or the expression of a protein resistant to phosphorylation
  and ubiquitin-dependent degradation (). Loss of ZNRF3, a potential Wnt signaling
  inhibitor, has been identified as the major genetic alteration in adrenal carcinoma.
  Mouse model with adrenal specific inactivation of Znrf3 is required to assess its
  causal involvement in ACC.
