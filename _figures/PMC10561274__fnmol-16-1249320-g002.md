caption: Inflammation associated signaling activated by fractalkine. The activation
  of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
  including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), p38-MAPK, and c-Jun
  NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK). MAPKS activate the stress-activated protein kinase-1
  (MSK1), and consequently, activate NFκB pathway, and therefore, the production and
  release of inflammatory mediators. By contrast, the activation of the AKT/ERK signaling
  pathway induces factor 2 related to nuclear factor E2 (Nrf2) to be translocated
  into the nucleus leading to increased transcription of various antioxidant and cytoprotective
  genes such as antioxidant response element (ARE) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which
  increase the phagocytic and anti-inflammatory capacity of microglia. To summarize,
  activation of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis increases NFκB (Galan-Ganga et al., 2019; Liu et
  al., 2019), promotes release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by microglia, and enhances
  the Nrf2 activation that increases anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory response (Lastres-Becker
  et al., 2014; Castro-Sanchez et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Trougakos, 2019). Akt,
