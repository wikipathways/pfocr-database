caption: Blue arrows indicate the regulation among genes in the PI3-kinase pathway
  (arrows with vertical short line segments represent inhibition role of up-stream
  genes). Red arrows indicate regulation interaction between miRNAs and PI3-kinase
  pathway. Minus sign suggests inhibition, and plus sign promotion. Eight target genes
  of 16 miRNAs are involved in the PI3K pathway and regulation of PTEN gene across
  seven cancer types. Different miRNAs in different cancers could regulate the same
  molecular processes through targeting their components. These miRNAs still could
  function similarly across at least eight cancer types.
