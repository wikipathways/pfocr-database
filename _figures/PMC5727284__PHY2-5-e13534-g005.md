caption: 'Graphical visualization of the key KEGG pathways that were considered distinctly
  downregulated: (A) JAK‐STAT signaling pathway, and (B) Cytokine‐cytokine receptor
  interaction. The differential expression analysis results for individual genes were
  shown through color masks on the boxes sanding for the corresponding genes, with
  a color gradient of red to green representing decreased to increased expression
  levels.'
