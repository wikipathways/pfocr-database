caption: Schematic diagram describing how OBP4 regulates root hair growth.  application
  induces OBP4 expression and consequently leads to reduced levels of RSL2, causing
  root hair growth retardation. OBP4 directly binds the RSL2 promoter to repress its
  expression. The OBP4-RSL2 pathway may fine-tune the root hair developmental program
  governed by RHD6 and RSL1 to determine the final length of root hairs. Similarly,
  RSL4, a close homolog of RSL2, also is regulated by developmental signaling, via
  RHD6 and RSL1, and fine-tuned by phosphate signaling.
