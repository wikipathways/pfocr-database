caption: 'Schematic of taste signaling: (A) Sweet/bitter taste signaling pathway:
  Formation of the receptor–ligand complex activates a non-specific cation channel.
  This leads to an influx of cations into the GRNs, leading to their membrane depolarization
  and further transmission of the signal. In addition, bitter tastants such as aristolochic
  acid utilize TRPA1 and opsins to perform a repulsive gustatory response []; (B)
  Salt taste signaling pathway: When D. melanogaster larvae detect a salty ligand,
  the PPK11 and PPK19 channels open up. This leads to an influx of cations into the
  GRNs, leading to their membrane depolarization. Contrarily, in case of adult flies,
  Gr64f, Gr66a, and Ir76b are involved in salt signaling (Modified from []).'
