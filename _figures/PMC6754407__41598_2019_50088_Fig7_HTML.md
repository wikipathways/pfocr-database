caption: Model of SHH induced increase of HELLS. Activation of the SHH pathway leads
  to upregulation and activation of YAP1, a transcriptional co-activator that functions
  in partnership with TEAD family transcription factors. We propose that HELLS is
  a YAP1/TEAD transcriptional target. HELLS is upregulated in SHH-N stimulated CGNPs
  and in murine and human SHH medulloblastoma. This upregulation can be modulated
  by inhibition of the interaction between YAP1 and TEAD family transcription factors
  using the drug verteporfin or by knockdown of YAP1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
  indicates YAP1/TEAD binds to DNA upstream of Hells suggesting that regulation of
  Hells transcription through YAP1 may be direct.
