caption: Functional scheme of the renin-angiotensin system. The protease renin converts
  the precursor angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I (Ang I) and subsequently converted
  to Ang II by dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Ang
  II binds to the AT1 receptor (AT1R) to stimulate inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative
  stress and an increase in blood pressure. Ang II are converted to Ang-(1-7) via
  endopeptidases (NEP) and the monocarboxypeptidase ACE2, respectively. Ang-(1-7)
  binds to the Mas-R to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic actions, stimulate
  the release of nitric oxide and reduce blood pressure. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2
  to stimulate internalization of both the virus and peptidase causing deleterious
  effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/Angiotensin receptor blockers
  (ARBs) regulate the metabolic pathway
