caption: Core apoptosis signaling pathway in cancer. Apoptosis is activated by two
  pathways, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway is triggered
  by death receptors such as TNFR1, Fas, and death receptor (DR) 4/5 by their related
  ligands TNF-α, Fas ligand (FasL), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).
  Ligand binding to these receptors leads to the recruitment of FADD and TRADD, and
  then forms a complex called death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which in turn
  results in the cleavage of procaspase-8 and sends a signal to activate caspase-8,
  thus activating caspase-3, and ultimately leads to apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway
  is stimulated by cellular stress, leading to p53 and BH3 only proteins activation,
  which in turn induces Bak/Bax oligomerization and permeabilization of the mitochondria,
  and ultimately promotes the release of cytochrome C (Cyt-C). Cyt-C forms a complex
  with apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) and procaspase-9 and then activates
  caspase-9. Caspase-9 triggers the caspase-3 activation and induces apoptotic cell
  death. Besides, the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family negatively regulates
  caspase activation and can be inhibited by second mitochondria-derived activator
  of caspase (SMAC)/direct IAP-binding protein with low pI (DIABLO), Omi, and apoptosis-related
  protein in the TGF-β signaling pathway (ARTS). Under certain conditions, cross talk
  from the extrinsic pathway via caspase-8-mediated truncation of Bid to t-Bid can
  also cause mitochondrial permeabilization. Additionally, the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathways also play essential roles
  in regulating apoptotic cell death
