caption: Configuring metabolism to match immune cell function. A, ATP is the key molecule
  that provides energy for cellular processes. Maintaining cellular ATP levels is
  essential for bioenergetic homeostasis and cell survival. Glucose, a key fuel source
  for mammalian cells, can be metabolized via two integrated metabolic pathways, glycolysis
  and OxPhos, that efficiently convert this simple sugar glucose into ATP. Glycolysis
  converts glucose to pyruvate through a series of enzymatic steps that occur in the
  cytosol, generating two molecules of ATP. Following its transportation into the
  mitochondria, pyruvate is further metabolized to CO2 by the Krebs cycle, which drives
  OxPhos and the translocation of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane.
  The resulting proton gradient drives the enzyme ATP synthase, converting ADP to
  ATP, generating up to 34 ATP per molecule of glucose. In addition to the breakdown
  of glucose via glycolysis, cells have the ability to metabolize alternative substrates,
  such as lipids and glutamine, which feed into the Krebs cycle and drive OxPhos.
  Fatty acid β-oxidation and glutaminolysis replenish the Krebs cycle intermediates
  acetyl-CoA and α-ketoglutarate, respectively, thereby fueling OxPhos and the efficient
  generation of cellular ATP. B, aerobic glycolysis supports biosynthetic processes
  of the cell as it allows the uptake of larger amounts of glucose and the maintenance
  of elevated glycolytic flux. Glycolytic intermediates are then diverted into various
  pathways for the synthesis of biomolecules that support biosynthetic processes.
  For instance, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), generated by the first step in glycolysis,
  can feed into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to support nucleotide synthesis.
  This pathway also generates NADPH, a cofactor that is essential for various biosynthetic
  processes including lipid synthesis. Glucose can also be converted into cytoplasmic
  acetyl-CoA via citrate in the Krebs cycle for the production of cholesterol and
  fatty acids for lipid synthesis. Other glycolytic intermediates can also be converted
  into biomolecules used for protein and lipid synthesis. During aerobic glycolysis,
  a significant proportion of pyruvate is also converted to lactate and secreted from
  the cell. Although aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate ATP (generating
  only two ATP molecules per glucose) due to the high rates of flux through the pathway,
  the rate of ATP production can be sufficient to maintain energy homeostasis even
  when mitochondrial ATP synthesis is impaired. Alternative fuels including glutamine
  feed into the Krebs cycle and can also supply biomolecules for biosynthetic processes
  under certain conditions.
