caption: Interference of type I IFN production by PRRSV proteins. Activation of RLR
  pathway and signaling by viral dsRNA is shown. Viral dsRNA is generated during PRRSV
  replication. “P” besides IRF3 and IRF7 indicates phosphorylation. Red-colored blocks
  indicate PRRSV proteins known to inhibit the signaling molecules indicated. PRRSV
  nsp1α inhibits IRF3 association with CBP, enhances CBP degradation, and interferes
  with IκB degradation. And nsp1β inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.
  Also nsp2 inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, interferes with
  IκB polyubiquitination, and prevents its degradation. And nsp11 inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation via degrading IPS-1 mRNA.
