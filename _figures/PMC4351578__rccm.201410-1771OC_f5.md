caption: 'Sphingolipids metabolo-genomic pathway patterns associated with chronic
  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subphenotypes. (A) Detailed sphingolipid metabolic
  pathway with the major ceramide synthetic pathways noted as sphingomyelinase, de
  novo, and recycling pathways (abbreviations list in the text). Individual or classes
  of metabolites measured in the study are identified as precursors and/or products
  relative to synthetic or catabolic reactions with directionality marked by black
  arrows. Catalytic enzymes are noted next to the middle of the reactions arrow. Circled
  are enzymes whose genes were significantly related with COPD phenotypes in genomic
  analyses. In color are classes (arrowheads) or species (arrows) of metabolites that
  were associated with respective (color-coded) COPD phenotypes. Solid arrows indicate:
  16–18 carbon chain sphingolipids; dotted arrows 24–26 carbon chain sphingolipids;
  single dash arrows: 14 carbon chain sphingolipids. The direction of the arrowhead
  or arrow marks the direction of association (i.e., up: increased; down: decreased).
  Closed-headed arrows represent changes with significance levels P < 0.05. (B, C)
  Superimposed on the sphingolipid metabolic pathways are deducted directions of sphingolipid
  metabolic flux, based on the results of the metabolo-genomic study, by disease phenotype,
  as noted.'
