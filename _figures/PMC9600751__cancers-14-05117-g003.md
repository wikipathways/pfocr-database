caption: 'Estrogen non-genomic signaling pathway and estrogen-induced ROS generation
  in thyrocyte. The non-genomic signaling of E2 occurs via the membrane-bound receptor
  mER, which stimulates activation of the MAP kinase and the PI3 kinase signaling
  pathways (left). Due to the chromosomal rearrangement of the tyrosine kinase receptor
  TRKA, PET/PTC genes, BRAF gene, and RAS gene mutation, aberrant activation of the
  tyrosine kinase pathway occurs. Additionally, the PI3K AKT pathway may also be abnormally
  activated by mutational inactivation of PTEN. E2 stimulates these pathways []. In
  addition, E2 stimulates NOX4 to product ROS, as well as generates ROS through its
  own metabolization []. NOX4 located in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum,
  and nuclear membrane. ROS is able to reach nuclear, then promote some alterations
  which help thyroid carcinogenesis. DUOX: dual oxidase; E2: estrogen; NOX4: NAPDH
  oxidase 4; ROS: reactive oxygen species; TPO: thyroperoxidase.'
