caption: . The carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in Phaeodactylum tricornutum from the
  synthesis of phytoene to β-carotene. The functionally assigned carotenogenic genes
  from P. tricornutum are arranged with their numbers from the genome sequence next
  to the reaction which is catalysed by their products. Lcy-b, lycopene β-cyclase;
  Pds, phytoene desaturaser; Psy, phytoene synthase; Zds, ζ-carotene desaturase. A
  gene for the isomerization of prolycopene to all-trans lycopene was not found.
