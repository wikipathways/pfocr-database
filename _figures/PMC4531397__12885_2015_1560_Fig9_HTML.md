caption: Proposed mechanism of action of MFX and CFX induced S-phase arrest and apoptosis.
  MFX and CFX causes S-phase arrest by decreasing the levels of Cyclin-A, Cyclin-E,
  CDK2, p21 and p27 in both the cell lines. Both FQs also leads to activation of extrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis via caspase-8 and ERK1/2 which then disrupts mitochondrial
  membrane potential via activation of Bid and proapoptotic Bak, as well as downregulates
  Bax and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, which finally promotes activation of caspase-9,3
  and leads to apoptosis. Furthermore MFX and CFX also suppresses cell survival pathway
  by downregulating the levels of pAKT and cMYC
