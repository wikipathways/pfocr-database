caption: Proposed anti-inflammatory mechanisms of argan oil. Argan oil exerts anti-inflammatory
  effects through its unique composition by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway
  at multiple points. Upstream, oleic acid and ferulic acid modulate TLR 4 signaling,
  preventing NF-κB translocation, and thereby suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. Additionally, bioactive compounds in argan oil, including polyunsaturated
  fatty acids, tocopherols, ferulic acid, and sterols, act as ligands for PPARα, further
  inhibiting NF-κB translocation. The precise anti-inflammatory mechanisms of spinasterol
  and schottenol, however, remain unclear. Downstream, IL-4 production interacts with
  PPARγ, leading to the inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity. ↑ = increase,
  ↓ = decrease, ? = uncertain mechanism
