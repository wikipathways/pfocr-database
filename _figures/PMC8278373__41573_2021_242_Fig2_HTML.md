caption: Glomerular filtration barrier (GFB), toxic mechanisms that affect podocytes
  and strategies to address podocyte dysfunction currently in development are shown.
  a | Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) inhibition. APOL1 genetic variants G1 and G2 accumulate
  in intracellular membranes and structures, particularly mitochondria (inset), where
  they form oligomers that can function as cation pores and leak cations, such as
  K+, across membranes. Oligomers also bind to mitochondrial inner membrane proteins,
  activating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), depolarizing mitochondria
  and causing mitochondrial dysfunction. VX-147 inhibits these toxic functions of
  APOL1. b | Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) restoration. Mutations in genes encoding components
  of the CoQ10biosynthetic pathway reduce levels of CoQ10, an electron acceptor of
  the inner membrane electron transport chain (inset), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction.
  Pharmacological delivery of CoQ10 or 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4-diHB) bypasses
  the defects and restores CoQ10 levels in the mitochondrial inner membrane. c | Short
  transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) inhibition. Mutant forms of TRPC6, overactivated
  TRPC6 or overactivated TRPC5 increase levels of intracellular Ca2+, which acts via
  calmodulin and calcineurin to activate the transcription factor nuclear factor of
  activated T cells (NFAT). Intracellular calcium activates RhoA (mainly via TRPC6)
  and RAC1 (mainly via TRPC5 and calcineurin). These signalling events remodel actin
  to form stress fibres and disrupt the normal actin–myosin contractile apparatus,
  resulting in foot process effacement, proteinuria and cell dysfunction. GFB-887
  and AM-1473 inhibit TRPC5 and TRPC6, respectively. d | Soluble urokinase plasminogen
  activator surface receptor (suPAR) inhibition. Elevated levels of circulating suPAR,
  particularly a fragment containing the D2 and D3 domains, can bind to and activate
  αvβ3 integrin at focal adhesions on podocytes. This interaction activates focal
  adhesion kinase (FAK), which remodels actin to form stress fibres and disrupts the
  normal actin–myosin contractile apparatus, resulting in foot process effacement,
  proteinuria and cell dysfunction. Antibodies blocking suPAR from binding to αvβ3
  integrin are one potential therapeutic approach when suPAR is the disease driver.
