caption: (A) Proposed model depicting inter-hemocyte crosstalk between Bnl+crystal
  cells and Btl+ lamellocytes. Based on our in vivo data, we propose that crystal
  cells expressing Bnl are important for the differentiation or maturation and possible
  migration or recruitment of lamellocytes towards parasitoid wasp eggs. (B) FGF signaling
  pathway map depicting the enrichment of genes that encode core components of the
  FGF signaling pathway. Triangle, rectangle, circles, diamonds, polygons represent
  ligand, receptor, signaling proteins, transcription factors, and their downstream
  target genes, respectively. Color gradient within nodes represents the number of
  cells a particular gene is enriched. Blue line (edge color) represents protein-protein
  interactions (from PPI network) and red line represents transcription factor-target
  gene networks. Genes that are more enriched in lamellocytes are in black border
  and those that are in blue border represent less enriched genes. Note that some
  genes with white border may be enriched in other clusters and are not marker genes
  of LM2.
