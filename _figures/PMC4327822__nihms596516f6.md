caption: 'Schema for coupling mGluR5 to FMRP-regulated protein synthesis. Several
  lines of evidence suggest that mGluR5 couples to FMRP-regulated protein synthesis
  through multiple pathways. (a) Activation of mGluR5 directly stimulates mRNA translation
  through the ERK signaling pathway. (b) Additionally, activation of mGluR5 can trigger
  dephosphorylation of FMRP by PP2A, which derepresses translation. (c) FMRP is rapidly
  synthesized in response to mGluR5 activation, providing a negative-feedback loop
  to turn off protein synthesis. (d) Several FMRP target proteins are known components
  of mGluR5 signaling pathways, suggesting that positive feedback may occur, particularly
  in the context of FX. Abbreviations: ERK, extracellular signal–regulated kinase;
  FMRP, fragile X mental retardation protein; FX, fragile X; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate
  receptor; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A.'
