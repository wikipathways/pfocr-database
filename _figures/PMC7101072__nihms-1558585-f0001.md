caption: Proposed Molecular Mechanisms Underlying HFpEF(A) Comorbidites are common
  in HFpEF and are thought to lead to systemic inflammation which results in microvascular
  inflammation, widespread endothelial dysfunction (in multiple organs), and coronary
  microvascular dysfunction, leading to abnormal systolic and diastolic cardiac mechanics,
  and poor cardiac reserve. Systemic inflammation also leads to the activation of
  monocytes and macrophages, which release pro-fibrotic cytokines including IL-10
  and TGF-beta, thereby promoting interstitial organ fibrosis, which in the heart
  increases passive myocardial stiffness. (B) Several factors promote a relative natriuretic
  peptide deficiency state in HFpEF, including obesity, sedentary lifestyle, African
  ancestry, insulin resistance, increased androgenicity in women, genetic variation
  in the NPPA and NPPB genes, and a lower amount of wall stress for the severity of
  heart failure (compared to HFrEF). (C) Natriuretic peptides are active in adipose
  tissue, where the relative ratio of the NPRA to NPRC receptors are important in
  dictating whether beneficial natriuretic peptide effects are possible. With increased
  NPRA, there is increased cGMP and PKG production, leading to lipolysis and the brown-fat
  thermogenic program. With increased NPRC, these beneficial effects are minimized,
  as there is increased natriuretic peptide breakdown. (D) Mechanical and metabolic
  stressors on the cardiomyocyte lead to T-tubule disruption and abnormal calcium
  handling within the cardiomyocyte, which leads to intracellular calcium overload
  and inefficient myocardial contraction and relaxation. (E) Natriuretic peptides
  act through a receptor guanylate cyclase pathway that results in the creation of
  cGMP and stimulation of PKG, which has a variety of beneficial effects in the heart
  and multiple other organs. There is also an intracellular, soluble guanylate cyclase,
  that is stimulated by nitric oxide, which also leads to increased cGMP and activation
  of PKG. PDE5 results in the breakdown of the NO-based cGMP pool whereas PDE9 results
  in the breakdown of the natriuretic peptide-based cGMP pool. (F) Multiple mechanisms
  present in HFpEF can result in stiffening of titin, the major molecular spring within
  the cardiomyocyte, thereby leading to increased cardiomyocyte (and subsequently
  cardiac chamber) passive stiffness. Because of insufficient natriuretic peptides
  and nitric oxide, PKG is reduced in HFpEF, which leads to hypophosphorylation of
  key sites within titin and increases its stiffness. ERK-2 (stimulated by increased
  cardiomyocyte stretch), PKA (stimulated by sympathetic stimulation), CaMKII (stimulated
  by reactive oxygen species), and PKCα (stimulated by endothelin-1 and angiotensin-II)
  all can have deleterious pro-stiffening effects on titin. (G) While endothelium-derived
  NO is reduced in HFpEF, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), which is activated by systemic
  inflammation, is upregulated and could be a pathogenic factor leading to HFpEF.
  In a recent study that utilized a novel 2-hit mouse model of HFpEF (Nω-nitro-L-arginine
  methyl ester [L-NAME, which induces hypertension] + high fat diet [obesity]), iNOS
  was upregulated, which resulted in S-nitrosylation (nitrosative stress) of the endonuclease
  inositol-requiring protein 1α (IRE1α), leading to defective splicing of an unfolded
  protein response effector (the spliced form of X-box-binding protein 1 [XBP1s]).
  XBP1s, in turn, was reduced in both the rodent HFpEF model and also in myocardial
  samples from patients with HFpEF, leading to increased levels of unfolded proteins
  within the cardiomyocytes, which are thought to interfere in normal cardiomyocyte
  function.
