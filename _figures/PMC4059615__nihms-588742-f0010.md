caption: Basal ganglia circuitry showing proposed antiparkinsonian activity of 5-HT2A
  receptor antagonists. Excitatory projections are depicted as closed arrows and inhibitory
  projections are shown as open arrows. (A) The striatum is the primary input nucleus
  of the basal ganglia. It receives excitatory glutamatergic input from the cerebral
  cortex. The major output nuclei of the basal ganglia, the internal globus pallidus
  (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), receive information from the
  striatum via two major pathways. The direct pathway consists of monosynaptic inhibitory
  projections from the striatum to the output nucleus. The net excitatory polysynaptic
  projections which include the external globus pallidus (GPe) and the subthalamic
  nucleus (STN), terminating in the output nuclei constitutes the indirect pathway.
  At the striatal level, dopamine acting on dopamine D1 receptors, facilitates transmission
  along the direct pathway and inhibits transmission along the indirect pathway through
  dopamine D2 receptors. It is thought that the delicate balance between inhibition
  of the output nuclei by the direct pathway and excitation by the indirect pathway
  is critical for normal control of motor activity, and that modulation of striatal
  activity by dopamine plays a crucial role in maintaining this balance. (B) In the
  parkinsonian state, loss of dopamine in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)
  leads to an overall increase in excitatory drive in the GPi-SNr, increasing the
  inhibitory output from GPi-SNr and thus decreased activity in the thalamocortical
  motor centers. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors on the terminals of corticostriatal
  neurons increase glutamatergic transmission. (C) Blocking 5-HT2A receptors will
  dampen the increased glutamatergic drive arising from dopamine deficiency and restore
  normal function of the basal ganglia and improve parkinsonian motor deficits.
