caption: 'PS inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome through two different pathways. To activate
  the NLRP3 inflammasome, NF-κB was stimulated in the early stage (1 h after treatment
  with LPS/ATP) and ER stress was stimulated in the late stage (12 h after treatment
  with LPS/ATP); both pathways enhanced Ca2+ accumulation and the subsequent mtROS
  generation, which lead to IL-1β and IL-18 release. PS inhibited the NF-κB signaling
  pathway in the early stage and downregulated ER stress in the late stage, which
  reduced intracellular Ca2+-mediated mtROS production and subsequently inhibited
  NLRP3 inflammasome-induced IL-1β and IL-18 release. NLRP3: NOD, LRR, and pyrin domain-containing
  protein 3; NF-κB: nuclear factor-κB; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; mtROS: mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species.'
