caption: Ubiquitination pathway. The ubiquitin molecule is activated by an E1 ubiquitin
  activating enzyme, in an ATP-dependent step, and a thioester intermediate is formed
  (E1-S-ubiquitin). The ubiquitin molecule is then transferred to an E2 conjugating
  enzyme (E2-S-ubiquitin), and then to the final substrate by an E3 ligase. Ubiquitin
  bound as monomers or polymers with different topologies are associated with different
  biological outputs, such as regulation of enzymatic activity, localization, protein-protein
  interactions, among others. Sequential ubiquitin conjugations form a polyubiquitin
  chain on the substrate, which can be recognized and degraded by the 26S proteasome.
  The deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are responsible for the ubiquitin molecules
  recycling and chain editing.
