caption: 'Extrinsic mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR mAbs in metastatic colorectal
  cancer. Tumour microenvironment plasticity confers resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy.
  Cetuximab and panitumumab suppress tumours through ADCC mediated by NK cells and
  macrophages. Dysfunction of NK cells and macrophages with lower ADCC impairs the
  suppression of EGFR-targeted therapy in cancer. Reduced density of effector T cells
  and increased PD-L1 expression in cancer cells also promote survival from cancer.
  CAFs promote resistance to targeted therapy by secreting growth factors that activate
  the RAS or MET pathway. Abnormal angiogenesis always predicts poor response to anti-EGFR
  mAbs. Therapies focused on the microenvironment are also shown in the figure. Abbreviations:
  CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; NK cells, natural killer cells; ADCC, antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity; PD-1, programmed death 1; PD-L1, programmed death ligand
  1. VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor'
