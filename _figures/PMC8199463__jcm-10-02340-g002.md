caption: The roads of metastasis. (A) Cartoon representing multi-directional pathways
  of metastasis formation. Pathway A. Cancer cells can leave the primary tumor, circulate,
  and eventually return to its origin, i.e., primary tumor []. Pathway B. Cancer cells
  can leave the primary tumor and extravasate at the secondary site (e.g., lungs)
  where they form metastatic foci [,]. Pathway C. From a metastatic focus, cancer
  cells can also re-intravasate and re-seed back to the primary tumor (if still in
  place), or travel and seed tertiary metastatic sites, Pathway D [,,,], enhancing
  metastatic burden. (B) Schematic representation showing that cancer cell re-dissemination
  from metastatic foci drastically enhances metastatic burden, which may contribute
  to cancer patient mortality. Primary tumor that, according to the classic concept
  of metastasis, produce only three metastatic foci (light blue circles), could, after
  only two rounds or re-dissemination originating from these three metastatic foci,
  result in 27 new metastatic foci (yellow circles), provided that the dissemination
  rate is constant. Thus, cancer cell re-dissemination from metastatic foci may be
  a new mechanism of enhancing metastatic burden.
