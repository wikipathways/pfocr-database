caption: 'Roles and mechanisms of ESM1 in tumor angiogenesis. Solid lines indicate
  demonstrated mechanisms and dashed lines indicate possible mechanisms. ESM1 activates
  the NF-κB pathway in two ways: Via the upregulation of TNF-α and IL-8, and via promotion
  of binding between VEGF and VEGFR2. The activated NF-κB upregulates VEGF via the
  transcription factor HIF-1α, thereby promoting angiogenesis. ESM1 also activates
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to upregulate MMPs, VEGF and HIF-1α by facilitating the
  binding of VEGF with VEGFR2. Regarding EGF and its receptor EGFR, ESM1 not only
  directly binds to EGFR but also facilitates the binding of EGF to EGFR, leading
  to activation of the EGFR signaling pathway. The activated EGFR, in turn, increases
  ESM1 expression through the JAK/STAT3 and ERK/ELK pathways, establishing a regulatory
  loop between ESM1 and EGFR. Increased ESM1 also upregulates angiogenesis-related
  factors such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2, EGFR and VWF, thereby promoting angiogenesis. In
  addition, activated EGFR can upregulate HIF-1α and MMPs through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway. In the MAPK pathway, ESM1 increases the expression of VEGF through ERK,
  JNK and p38. As for the Notch pathway, the ligand DLL4 is upregulated by ESM1, thereby
  inhibiting VEGF expression. ESM1, endothelial cell specific molecule-1; NF-κB, nuclear
