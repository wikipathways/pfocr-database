caption: 'Revised model of oncogene-induced senescenceA: In cells that are insensitive
  to oncogene-induced senescence, activation of the Ras pathway leads to hyper-activation
  of well known effector pathways which function to promote tumorigenesis.B: In sensitive
  cells the ultimate response to the aberrant activation of the Ras pathway is the
  initiation of a multi-faceted negative feedback signaling network designed to terminate
  the oncogenic signal. These signals are triggered by the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and
  involve numerous transcriptional and post-translational events, including the suppression
  of Ras exchange factors, and the up-regulation of Sprouty proteins and RasGAPs,
  among others. These inhibitory signals, via the consequential suppression of PI3K,
  can activate Rb and p53 through multiple signals. Thus, we propose that oncogene-induced
  senescence is mediated by this negative feedback signaling program, that functions
  along with other known senescence regulators, such as p16 and ARF, to achieve a
  threshold senescence signal.'
