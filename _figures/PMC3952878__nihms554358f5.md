caption: 'FAK and tumor microenvironment Cancer cells are surrounded by cancer cell
  niche or tumor microenvironment components, such as extracellular matrix, endothelial
  cells, blood vessels; and immune cells, playing a significant role in inflammation.
  FAK plays important role in motility and invasion of macrophages. Macrophages release
  cytokines that affect NF-kappa B and FAK signaling, inflammation and tumor growth.
  TNF alpha binds TNFR receptor, activates I kappa B kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates
  IkBα causing its dissociation from NF-kappa B and activating NF-kappa B. Activated
  NF-kappa B translocates to the nucleus, binds FAK promoter and induces FAK transcription.
  FAK is required for TNF-alpha induced interleukin-6 transcription, MAPK activation
  and IL-6 increased transcription and production. Endothelial cells: VEGF production
  stimulates FAK activation and induces Src-dependent phosphorylation of Y861 FAK
  in endothelial cells, playing important role in motility, angiogenesis and survival
  of endothelial cells. In tumors integrin signals activate FAK Y397, Y576/Y577 and
  Y925 phosphorylation, which leads to binding of Grb-2, Ras/ERK pathway activation
  and secretion of VEGF, which induce endothelial cells function. Tumor microenvironment
  regulate cancer cell EMT, metastasis, invasion and tumorigenesis.'
