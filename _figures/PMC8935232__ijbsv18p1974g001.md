caption: Schematic representation of CD38 in promoting MM proliferation and preventing
  MM death. CD38 directs the cyclization of extracellular NAD+ to intracellular cADPR
  (or ADPR) and triggers Ca2+ release to cytoplasm in MM cells. Intracellular CD38
  contributes to a low level of NAD+ in cytoplasm. The high level of Ca2+ supports
  membrane invagination, cytoskeleton remodeling, and metabolic alteration. The high
  Ca2+ level in cytoplasm with mitochondria dysfunction and the low intracellular
  NAD+ level both leads to the Warburg effect. Besides, CD38 can protect MM cells
  from apoptosis caused by a miRNA, miR-26a. CD38 is also one of the three ectoenzymes
  in the CD38/CD203a/CD73 pathway that produces ADO, which not only regulates immune
  response in hypoxic conditions but also suppresses the antitumor immune response
  by recruiting MDSCs and Treg cells, inhibiting the activity of T effector cells
  and thus favoring tumor progression.
