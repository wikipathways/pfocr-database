caption: The stabilization and modification of GSDMD. (1) Shigella flexneri can secret
  the effector protein OspC3 to inhibit the function of caspase-4/11 via arginine
  ADP-riboxanation modification, leading to the inactivation of GSDMD signaling. (2)
  A novel binding protein of GSDMD called TRIM21 can stabilize GSDMD in quiescent
  cell while it promotes the oligomerization of GSDMD-NT for pyroptosis in stimulated
  cell. (3) In neutrophils, intracellular protease inhibitors Serpinb1a and Serpinb6a
  suppressed GSDMD-mediated neutrophil pyroptosis by inhibiting Cathepsin G (CATG)
  which promoting the cleavage of GSDMD. (4) The absence of NINJ1 in macrophage results
  in impaired plasma membrane rupture, but GSDMD remained the capacity of inducing
  the formation of membrane pores. (5) GSDMD succination not only prevents its interaction
  with caspases but also limits its processing, oligomerization and the ability to
  induce cell death. (6) Rag-Ragulator complex has the capacity to promote oligomerization
  of GSDMD in pyroptosis via mTORC1-ROS pathway. (7) Rag-Ragulator complex was involved
  in FADD-RIPK1-Caspase-8–mediated pyroptosis. RIPK1, Receptor-interacting protein
  kinase 1; FADD, Fas-associating protein with a novel death domain; mROS, mitochondrial
