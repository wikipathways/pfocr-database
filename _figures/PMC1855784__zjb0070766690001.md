caption: Part of the bicyclic autotrophic CO2 assimilation pathway in C. aurantiacus.
  The scheme shows the last two reactions of the first cycle and the known reactions
  of the second cycle. In the first cycle (3-hydroxypropionate cycle), two HCO3− are
  fixed to form glyoxylate as the first net fixation product. In the second cycle
  (glyoxylate assimilation cycle), glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA are condensed to erythro-β-methylmalyl-CoA
  (probably [2R,3S]-2-methylmalyl-CoA), which is converted to acetyl-CoA and pyruvate.
  SmtAB, succinyl-CoA:l-malate CoA transferase; Mcl, l-malyl-CoA lyase/erythro-β-methylmalyl-CoA
  lyase; Mcd, β-methylmalyl-CoA dehydratase; Sct, succinyl-CoA:R-citramalate CoA transferase;
  Ccl, R-citramalyl-CoA lyase.
