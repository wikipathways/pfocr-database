caption: 'This figure depicts only a small number of the hypothesized regulatory pathways
  of Dictyostelium growth and development, focusing on those that were examined experimentally
  in this study. A line ending in an arrowhead suggests that the first element directly
  or indirectly promotes the activity or levels of the second; inhibition is suggested
  by a line ending in a cross-bar. Published works that report on the nature of each
  pathway within the network are as follows: a[], []; b[]; c[]; d[], [], []; e[],
  [], [], []; f[]; g [], []; h[–]; i[], []; j[]; k[], [], []; l[], []; m[]; n[]; o[],
  []; p[]; q[], []; r[]; s[]; t[]; u[]; v[], []; w[], []; x[]; y[].'
