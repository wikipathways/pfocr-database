caption: Simplified models depicting the roles of gonadotropin-release hormone (Gnrh)
  and the kisspeptins (Kiss) in the control of vertebrate reproduction. (A) In rodent
  model species, the Gnrh neuronal system is typically viewed as the key integrator
  of multiple stimulatory and inhibitory inputs that control Gnrh pulsatility, Lh
  synthesis and the Lh surge in females. Gnrh neurons project to and release the Gnrh
  peptide into the median eminence (ME). The hypothalamo-hypophysial portal blood
  transports Gnrh (and other neuropeptides and neurotransmitters) to the anterior
  pituitary where gonadotrophs are randomly distributed. Specific populations of Kiss-expressing
  neurons control specific populations of Gnrh neurons. The Kiss-Gnrh pathway is shown
  as a functional unit framed with a box. In this context, the Kiss and Gnrh systems
  are in series. Numerous other neuropeptides and neurotransmitters (Nx; for simplicity,
  depicted as a single input) are important for the control of Gnrh, kisspeptin and,
  ultimately Lh release and gonadal function. Gonadal steroids such as estradiol-17β
  (E2) exert both positive and negative feedback at the levels of hypothalamus and
  pituitary. Elimination of either Gnrh or Kiss blocks reproduction in a mammal. Experimental
  data have delineated this essentiality of Gnrh and Kiss in the control of Lh release
  in mammalian species. (B) In teleost fish, the ME has been lost to varying degrees
  during the course of evolution, and alternatively there is extensive direct innervation
  of gonadotrophs in the highly regionalized pars distalis of the anterior pituitary.
  The hypophysiotropic Gnrh neuronal system in teleosts is considered as a key element
  in the multifactorial direct control of Lh synthesis and release. The role of Kiss
  is less clear. There is little anatomical evidence supporting the existence of Kiss
  projections to Gnrh neuronal cell bodies, and Gnrh neurons in teleosts do not express
  Gpr54. On the other hand, Kiss fibers and Gnrh fibers share a close relationship
  in the pars distalis. In this context, the Kiss and Gnrh systems (and many others)
  are in parallel. Gonadal steroids such as E2 exert both positive and negative feedback
  at the levels of telencephalic preoptic area-hypothalamus and pituitary. Knockout
  of either Gnrh or Kiss does not block reproduction in a fish. Experimental data
  have delineated that Gnrh and Kiss are therefore dispensible for reproductive control
  in zebrafish. Numerous other neurons producing neuropeptides and neurotransmitters
  (Nx; depicted as multiple inputs. See also Table ) are important for the control
  of Gnrh, Kiss and additionally, project to the anterior pituitary for the direct
  control of Lh and, in turn, gonadal function.
