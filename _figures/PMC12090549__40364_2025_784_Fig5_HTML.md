caption: Potential for combining inhibition of the adenosinergic pathway and other
  cancer immunotherapies. Co-targeting key components of the adenosinergic pathway,
  such as A2AR, A2BR, CD39, and CD73, offers synergistic therapeutic potential by
  modulating both tumor and immune cells. Furthermore, adenosinergic pathway inhibitors
  may be effectively combined with other cancer immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint
  blockade (ICB) and adoptive cellular therapy (ACT), to improve treatment outcomes
  across various cancers. This strategy is under active investigation and will be
  further evaluated in large-scale clinical trials. Additionally, targeting adenosine
  deaminase (e.g., PEG-ADA), which promotes inosine generation, remains a potential
  approach, though it has yet to be tested
