caption: OGT links cancer cell metabolism and cell survival via regulation of HIF-1α.
  Schematic depicting the pathway by which oncogenes increase OGT (and decrease OGA)
  levels and decrease production of α-KG, a key metabolite that regulates HIF-1α hydroxylation
  and stabilization. Once HIF-1α is stabilized, it increases transcription of key
  glycolytic enzymes including GLUT1 that increase glycolytic flux, and blocks ER
  stress-mediated signals and apoptotic factors including Bcl-2 family proteins such
  as Bim, thus contributing to cancer cell survival. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; Bim, Bcl2-interacting
  mediator of cell death; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; Fructose-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; HIF-1α, hypoxia
  inducible factor 1α; HRE, HIF-1 response element; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A;
  OGA, O-GlcNAcase; OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; OH, hydroxyl group; PERK, PRKR-like
  endoplasmic reticulum kinase; PFK-1, phosphofructokinase-1; PFKFB3, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase
  3; Pro, proline; PUMA, p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis; UDP-GlcNAc, uridine
  diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine.
