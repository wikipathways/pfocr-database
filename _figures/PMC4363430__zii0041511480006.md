caption: Model of the immune response against Leishmania mexicana and the role of
  IL-10. (A) Killing of Leishmania requires IFN-γ, primarily from CD4+ Th1 cells,
  and inducible nitric oxide synthase in infected macrophages (MΦ). IL-10 has pleiotropic
  effects on the immune response. It is known to downregulate MHC class II and the
  costimulatory proteins B7-1 and B7-2 on antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages
  and dendritic cells. It also downregulates proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-12,
  which is critical for T cell development into IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells. In addition,
  IL-10 downregulates the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which is
  required for nitric oxide production, which in turn is required for Leishmania killing.
  The immunosuppressive pathway requires IL-10 but also FcγRIII and IgG1. Thus, IL-10
  reduces productive Th1 development and IFN-γ production, as well as directly downregulating
  inducible nitric oxide synthase. I have now shown that IL-10 from macrophages is
  dispensable for the immunosuppressive pathway. TCR, T cell receptor. (Modified from
  reference .) (B) In the indirect model, IgG1-Leishmania immune complexes bind to
  FcγRIII on an unknown cell type, inducing cell surface receptors or soluble factors
  that induce IL-10 production from T cells. This FcγRIII+ cell should lack FcγRI
  and FcγRIV. In the direct model, a T cell subset expresses FcγRIII and secretes
  IL-10 in response to IgG1-Leishmania immune complexes. Other signals, such as TLR
  ligands, may also be required for optimal IL-10 production from T cells.
