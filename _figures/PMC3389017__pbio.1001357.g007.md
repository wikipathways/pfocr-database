caption: Activated Rac (Rac*) at the CpC-GSC interface sets up an intracellular polarity
  within the GSC that couples the control of the plane of cell division to the response
  to the extracellular BMP maintenance signal. Activated Rac concentrates Apc2 at
  the CpC-GSC interface to orient a centrosome during interphase. The GSC will arrest
  in prometaphase if one centrosome is not present at the CpC-GSC interface. These
  two mechanisms act together to ensure that the GSC mitotic spindle is perpendicular
  to the niche-GSC interface. Rac also activates the JNK pathway to promote BMP signaling
  in the GSC, possibly by increasing competitiveness of the GSC for BMP ligands.
