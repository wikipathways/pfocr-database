caption: Proposed mechanism of reorganization. a, ICMS testing defines baseline responses.
  b, Nstim ADC evokes postsynaptic depolarization synchronized to presynaptic inputs
  from Nrec horizontal connections normally activity during movement (dashed red arrow).
  c, Following conditioning, ICMS at Nrec activates strengthened pathways to produce
  responses that incorporate Nstim projections. Similar mechanisms could occur at
  other sites of convergence. d, Putative convergent sites for synaptic strengthening.
  The projections of separate motor cortex populations are illustrated in a hypothetical
  conditioning experiment pairing anatomical agonists FCR and FDP. A stimulating microwire
  terminates in the proximity of Nstim. ADC strengthens synapses shown in red (“x”)
  that mediate connections from Nrec during volitional movements. A proportion of
  the population is activated directly by focal current injection (yellow region).
  Subcortical and spinal sites of convergence are illustrated by red boutons (y and
  z). e, Corticomuscle loop. A schematic of the minimal corticomuscle pathways (left)
  and response patterns of involved neurons (right). CM cells have the most direct,
  monosynaptic connections on spinal motoneurons (MN), although polysynaptic linkages
  via other corticospinal cells exist. The afferent pathway begins with Ia afferents
  whose somas are located in the DRG. The predominant response type of these cell
  populations recorded during a ramp-and-hold wrist movement is shown at right (Adapted
  from ). Additional inputs to the CM cell, including central cells driving the CM
  cell, are represented by the pre-CM cell.
