caption: Schematic mechanisms of the main steps involved in the bactericidal activity
  of antibiotics. When antibiotics interact with their targets, (i) primary damage
  may occur. If this primary damage is severe and independent of oxidative stress,
  (ii) bacteria are not able to repair the damage (iii) and die (red). If the primary
  damage is insufficient to the kill the bacteria directly, the tricarboxylic acid
  cycle (TCA) (iv) may be accelerated, leading to the formation of ROS (v). Accumulation
  of ROS (vi) may cause secondary damage by introducing oxidative lesions in DNA,
  lipids and proteins (vii), resulting in killing of the bacteria (viii). Modified
  from Kohanski et al., 2007, Zhao et al., 2015, Van Acker and Coenye, 2017 [,,].
  In this study, the involvement of the oxidative pathway in the bactericidal activity
  of daptomycin was evaluated by the increased survival (ix) and the decreased ROS
  formation when ROS was removed with catalase or scavenged with thiourea (vi) and
  by preventing interactions with the targets in a resistant isolate (i).
