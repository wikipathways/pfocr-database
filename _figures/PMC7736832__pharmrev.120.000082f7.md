caption: Model of GPCR regulation by glycosylation. GPCRs are extensively modified
  with N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation during biosynthesis and transport through
  the ER-Golgi en route to the plasma membrane. Glycosylation-deficient or misfolded
  GPCRs undergo ER-associated proteasomal degradation pathway. Glycosylation controls
  GPCR folding and maturation in the biosynthetic pathway, transport to the cell surface,
  signaling, ligand affinity, N-terminal cleavage, receptor dimerization, and internalization.
  Importantly, glycosylation controls GPCR biased signaling through direct modulation
  of the GPCR or in some cases the GPCR ligand. Glycosylation also regulates metalloprotease-mediated
  N-terminal cleavage of GPCR to influence biased signaling and modulates ligand-binding
  affinity by providing a larger and potentially more flexible binding surface of
  the GPCR. Dimerization of certain GPCRs is also positively modulated by glycosylation.
