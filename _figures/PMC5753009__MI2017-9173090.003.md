caption: ATX-LPA axis promotes cancer-related inflammation. In CRI, LPA acts on its
  receptors via Gαq/11, Gαi/0, and Gα12/13. Gαq/11 induces NFκB activation through
  PKCδ promoting TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-6 production. Gαi/0 induces the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway culminating in NFκB and HIF-1α translocation to the nucleus. HIF-1α induces
  the transcription of TERT enabling replicative immortality. Gαi/0 can also transactivate
  Src kinase and crosstalk with EGFR, to induce extracellular matrix degrading proteins,
  and STAT-3 signaling pathway to further induce cytokine production. PI3K signaling
  promotes ROS production and activation of AKT, ERK1/2, and NFκB. On the other hand,
  Gα12/13/RhoA/ROCK signaling causes activation of transcription factor ATF2 to induce
  further proinflammatory mediator production. Finally, cytokine production, particularly
  IL-6, can interact with their IL receptors and promote STAT5 and STAT3 activation.
  In all, these pathways maintain a proinflammatory environment that leads to malignant
  transformation. Dashed lines denote that other proteins participate in the pathways
  and were omitted to summarize information. This figure is reproduced from Liu et
