caption: Dimethylsulfoniopropionate degradation through the cleavage pathway. Propionyl-CoA
  synthetase and acryloyl-CoA reductase (in green) were identified in P. bahamense
  using Marinovum algicola reference database. These enzymes are mainly involved in
  the cleavage pathway for the degradation of dimethylsulfoniopropionate. Propionyl-CoA
  synthetase catalyzes the conversion of acrylate to acryloyl-CoA. Acryloyl-CoA is
  then converted to propionyl-CoA through catalysis of acryloyl-CoA reductase. The
  presence of these proteins in the proteome of P. bahamense corroborates the previous
  reports on the role of associated bacteria in this process. This process is also
  likely to contribute to the cellular energetics of P. bahamense through the generation
  of propionyl-CoA, an intermediate for the biosynthesis of precursors in the Krebs
  cycle. Highlighted proteins in green were detected in the present study. Figure
  was adapted from Bullock et al., 2017 [].
