caption: Schematic illustration of SFKs mechanism of action in interferon regulatory
  factor 1 (IRF-1) K63-Ubiquitination. (A) Activation of the TLR7/8 pathway promotes
  the interaction between SFKs and TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) allowing the recruitment
  of both cIAP2 and IRF-1 by TRAF6 with the subsequent K63-ubiquitination and accumulation
  of IRF-1. (B) Preincubation with PP2 impairs the capacity of SFKs to interact with
  TRAF6 and the formation of the TRAF6-IRF1-cIAP2 complex, inhibiting K63-ubiquitination
  of IRF-1, which is, however, K48-ubiquitinylated and it is consequently degraded
  via proteasome.
