caption: Various cell-intrinsic and extrinsic inputs regulate the autophagy-lysosome
  machinery. Organelle damage and impaired protein quality control with dysfunction
  of the ubiquitin-proteasome system activates selective autophagy to remove the damaged
  organelles (mitochondria, ER, golgi and lysososomes) and protein aggregates (reviewed
  in ()). Aging induces ROS upregulation and accumulation of DNA damage, which induce
  senescence in cardiac progenitors through telomere attrition and DNA damage (reviewed
  in (). While SIRT1 expression is increased, experimental evidence indicates that
  further stimulation of SIRT1 function enhances autophagy via activation of FOXO1.
  Serum levels of GDF11, a TGFβ family member, decreases with age in the serum and
  increasing GDF11 levels beneficially affects age-related cardiac phenotypes. While
  GDF11 stimulates autophagy in skeletal muscle; its effects on the heart have not
  been studied. miR-216a increases in the aging heart and is known to downregulate
  Beclin-1, a protein essential for autophagy induction. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl
  transferase (Nampt), a key enzyme in the salvage pathway of NAD+ synthesis in cardiomyocytes
  is down regulated with aging, and restoring Nampt and NAD+ levels restores autophagic
  flux in the heart. Multiple transcriptional pathways intricately regulate the autophagy-lysosome
  machinery (reviewed in ()). The FOXO family of transcription factors are autophagy
  activators and are activated by phosphorylation effected by AMPK, JNK and MST1 kinases.
  However, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 at a different site inactivates FOXO1
  and holds it in the cytosol. Activation of the stress sensor ERN1/IRE1α signaling
  also holds FOXO activity in check. TP53 (tumor protein p53), a transcription factor
  that regulates cell cycle activates autophagy when localized to the nucleus by directly
  activating transcriprion of various ATG genes, but inhibits autophagy when in the
  cytosol. Lysosomal lipases are held in check by mxl3 in C. elegans and by its orthologue
  MAX in mice. Both are transcriptional repressors that bind to the CLEAR response
  element where TFEB binds to inhibit lipophagy and lipolysis for generation of energy
  (reviewed in (). CREB, or cAMP response element-binding protein is held in check
  by its interaction with FXR, farnesoid X receptor in the fed state. Fasting induced
  FXR degradation and binding of CREB to CRTC2, its co-activator to induce TFEB transcription.
  Fasting also causes LYNUS machinery to deactivate mTOR which results in dephosphorylation
  and activation of TFEB. TFEB stimulates transcription of autophagy and lysosome
  pathway genes. Circadian rhythm plays a central role in regulation of the fasting
  feeding responses and controls autophagy-lysosome machinery. Emerging evidence points
  to counter-regulation of TFEB family of transcription factors by circadian rhythm
  regulators either indirectly via mTOR activity or directly via TFEB binding to Per
  genes (reviewed in (). Numerous metabolic influences also regulate autophagy in
  the heart, as shown (and reviewed in ()). Please see section titled ‘Cardiac energetics,
  substrate metabolism and pathophysiology under fasting states’ for a detailed discussion
  of cardiac metabolism under stress. ‘’ indicates , whereas ‘’ indicates inhibition.
