caption: CRISPRe works by promoting transcriptional elongation(A) CRISPRe facilitates
  RNAP elongation. Unlike ordinary operons where the complex regulation is focused
  on transcriptional initiation to activate promoters, the pqq operon in K. vulgare
  regulates gene expression by providing an uneven travel for RNAP. Particularly,
  the GC-rich intergenic region, located immediately downstream AT-rich pqqA gene,
  acts as the roadblocks that prevent the elongation of RNAP and reduces the expression
  of downstream genes in operon. CRISPRe, however, can significantly promote RNAP
  elongation and PQQ synthesis by directional targeting. Hence, CRISPRe plays a role
  by facilitating RNAP elongation. Besides, the pqq operon has evolved a ribosomal
  coupling pathway. Multiple SD-like sequences are placed on intergenic region to
  slow down the translational re-initiation by their high affinity with ribosomes
  and further decrease the translation of downstream genes, thus limiting the synthesis
  of end products.(B) The proposed model for CRISPRe. Presence of iPAM motifs prevents
  Cas3 from cleaving at the desired positions and the targets successfully escape
  interference from CRISPR-Cas immunity. However, Cas3, relying on its helicase domain,
  can still translocate away from Cascade complex along targets to unwind double-stranded
  DNA, thereby facilitating RNAP elongation. Hence, more transcripts are generated
  with the roles of CRISPRe.
