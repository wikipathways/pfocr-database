caption: Pre-beta HDL produced, as a consequence of the interaction of apoA-I with
  the ABCA1 transporter on the liver, obtains additional phospholipid and cholesterol
  from ABCA1 transporters on peripheral cells, such as macrophages. In addition, HDL
  can acquire more lipid by other mechanisms, such as from the ABCG1 transporter,
  the SR-BI receptor or by an aqueous diffusion process. Cholesterol removed from
  cells by HDL is converted to cholesteryl esters by LCAT, which transforms pre-beta
  HDL to alpha-HDL. Cholesterol can be directly returned to the liver after uptake
  by the SR-BI receptor or after transfer to apoB-containing lipoproteins by CETP.
  Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) and hepatic lipase (HL) promote the interconversion
  alpha-HDL and pre-beta HDL.
