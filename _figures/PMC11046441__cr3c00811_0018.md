caption: Evolutionary basis of α-glucan chemistry and metabolic pathway diversity.
  Schematics depict an exercise based on different aspects and models for the evolution
  of metabolic pathways onto α-glucan metabolism. (A) Hypothetical scenario for the
  divergent evolution of one gene into three enzymes with different functions. Considering
  organisms with a coding gene (grey arrow) for an enzyme responsible for processing
  an α-glucoside A into B. Due to gene cumulative mutations and selection by environmental
  pressure (in the same or different organisms) the enzyme gene diverges into three
  distinct gene/enzymes (red arrows and boxes), with a different active site suited
  for different cellular functions involving α-glucosyl bond processing. Over time,
  these mutations became fixed in the population, creating three distinct enzyme lineages.
  This case may reflect the diversification of the GH13 family into different functions.
  (B) Hypothetical case of convergent evolution, involving three different species
  of bacteria that live in similar environments where the processing of an α-glucan
  provides an adaptive advantage to survive. Each species had evolved independently
  and contained genes (grey arrows with different red hatching) that do not share
  a recent common ancestor, encoding enzymes responsible for processing unrelated
  α-glucosides. The selection of mutations in these three genes converges on enzymes
  with the same function. This case may reflect the convergence of enzymes from GH13,
  GH77, and GH57 families into enzymes 4-α-glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.25). (C) A
  speculative scenario of an anterograde evolution pathway581 in which an organism
  utilizes a branched α-glucans using a gene/enzyme (red arrow and box) that processes
  the substrate in linear chains to be able to harvest it. An event of gene duplication
  and posterior divergence results in a second gene/enzyme (pink arrow and box) that
  processes the linear α-glucan into maltose, providing an advantage due, i.e., cluster
  to the same operon for utilization of nutrients. The same process repeats to acquire
  a gene/enzyme (purple) to transform maltose into trehalose, reaching a more efficient
  way to produce the functional disaccharide. (D) Speculative scenario of retrograde
  evolution575 where an extracellular α-glucan is critical for survival, which can
  be produced by an organism gene/enzyme (red arrow and box) from oligosaccharides
  obtained from the environment. An undergoing depletion of the disaccharide generates
  the selection, under growing pressure, of a new gene/enzyme (pink arrow and box)
  originated by gene duplication and divergence, that can synthesize oligosaccharides
  from disaccharides available in the environment. The same process repeats to acquire
  a gene/enzyme (purple) to generate disaccharides from monosaccharides. (E) A hypothetical
  case of an ancestral gene encoding promiscuous enzyme (blue arrow and hexagon),582,583
  i.e., an NSPase produces different sugar donors NDP-glucose. The enzyme through
  gene duplication and subsequent divergence evolves into three differentiated enzymes
  (light, medium, and dark blue arrow and hexagons) with higher specificity to synthesize
  ADP-glucose, UDP-glucose, and GDP-glucose. (F) The differentiation of promiscuous
  enzymes recruited in an ancestral pathway (blue hexagon, and yellow circle) under
  gene duplication and subsequent divergence can lead to the arrangement of specific
  enzymes into different pathways “patchwork”. (G) Hypothetical enzyme-substrate co-evolution
  involving an enzyme (yellow circle) that synthesizes a linear α-glucan in a pathway
  comprising a second enzyme (red box) to generate branched α-glucans. Eventual errors
  or promiscuity lead the first enzyme to generate the byproduct maltose 1-phosphate.
  In a second moment, the new metabolite scaffolds the evolution of a specific enzyme
  (salmon circle). A higher level of maltose 1-phosphate is removed by unspecific
  enzymes by oligomerization. In a third moment, the enzyme (pink box) is recruited
  and evolves to catalyze such reaction specifically
