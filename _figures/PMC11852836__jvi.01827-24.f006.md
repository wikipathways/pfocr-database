caption: KEGG pathway map of differential metabolites in glycerophosphate pathway.
  (A) KEGG pathway map of differential metabolites in glycerophosphate pathway between
  the DMSO and MOCK groups. (B) KEGG pathway map of differential metabolites in glycerophosphate
  pathway between the TMP269 and DMSO groups. Red indicates significantly upregulated
  metabolites in the experimental group, blue represents metabolites detected but
  not significantly changed, green indicates significantly downregulated metabolites
  in the experimental group, and orange indicates both upregulated and downregulated
  metabolites
