caption: Integrated signaling networks and tumor cellular bioenergetics. Tumor cell
  growth and survival require both oncogenic growth signals and sufficient metabolic
  flux that supports both biosynthesis of macromolecules like nucleotides, proteins
  and lipids, as well as ATP production. Oncogenic growth factor receptor signaling
  conveyed through PI3K-Akt can upregulate glycolysis, thereby providing sufficient
  cellular bioenergetics to support mTOR mediated cancer progression. AMPK signaling
  senses cellular energy stress, and downmodulates energy-consuming processes (e.g.
  mTOR driven biosynthetic pathways). The LKB1-AMPK pathway and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway
  have a cross-talk through a molecular convergence point TSC2, consolidating the
  emerging intimate relationship between physiological control of metabolism and cancer
  growth.
