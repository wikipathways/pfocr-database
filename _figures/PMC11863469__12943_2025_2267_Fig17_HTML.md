caption: 'SHH signaling pathway in GBM, particularly in GSCs: In the absence of the
  hedgehog (HH) ligand, the Ptch receptor inhibits Smo, leading to the formation of
  GliR, a repressor that suppresses the expression of target genes. Ptch and SUFU
  act as critical tumor suppressors in this context. When the HH ligand binds to Ptch,
  it induces the receptor''s degradation, relieving the inhibition on Smo. This activates
  a signaling cascade through Smo, resulting in the formation of GliA, a transcription
  factor that drives the expression of genes promoting tumor proliferation and survival.
  Activation of this pathway significantly enhances tumor cell proliferation, fueling
  cancer growth and progression'
