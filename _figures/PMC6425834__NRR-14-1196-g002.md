caption: 'Models for potential interaction between Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and
  protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2).(A) Direct interaction at the plasma membrane
  model. This model proposes that in absence of TLR4, PAR2 activates the myeloid of
  differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) independent signaling culminating
  in expression of its anti-inflammatory target genes. However, this model is based
  on data from experiment involving synthetic activating peptides and does not consider
  the significant differences between membrane-initiated and endosomal PAP2 and TLR4
  signaling (Rallabhandi et al., 2008). (B) Alternative model of direct interaction
  in endosomes. In this model, PAR2 and TLR4 interact in the plasma membrane and,
  after internalisation, within endosomes. Membrane bound heterooligomers of PAR2
  and TLR4 signal via the MyD88-dependent signaling cascade, whereas the endosomal
  heterooligomers activate the MyD88-independent signaling pathway. This model considers
  the proposed direct interaction between TLR4 and PAR2, recognises the differences
  between membrane initiated and endosomal signaling cascades and could explain the
  controversial role of the TLR4/PAR2 interaction in modulating pro- and anti-inflammation.
  (C) Signaling crosstalk model. PAR2 signaling cascade could cross-talk to the TLR4
  signaling pathway through the ability of rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma-1 (raf-1)
  to (cross-) activate tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6)
  which in turn could result in modulation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB) activity. On the other hand, TLR4 could cross-activate
  the PAR2 signaling cascade via transforming growth factor activated kinase-1 (TAK1)-mediated
  activation of extracellular-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and subsequent regulation
  of activating peptide1 (AP1) activity. Overall, this model suggests a signaling
  crosstalk between PAR2 and TLR4-mediated signaling without a direct interaction
  of both receptors. LPS: Lipopolysaccharide; MEK: mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase; IL: interleukin; β-arr: β-arrestins; TRIF: Toll/IL-1 receptor-domain containing
  adaptor inducing interferon; TRAM: TRIF-related adapter molecule; MD2: myeloid of
  differentiation protein 2; IRF3: interferon regulatory transcription factor 3; TNF-α:
  tumor necrosis factor-alpha; NEMO: NF-κB essential modulator; IKK: inhibitor of
