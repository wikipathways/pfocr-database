caption: 'Graphical overview of the molecular mechanisms by which curcumin exerts
  its anti-cancer effect within MDSCs, using in vivo and in vitro assays. iNOS, COX-2,
  CCR7 and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α are among the distinctive
  molecules expressed by M1 macrophages, whereas M2 macrophages express arginase-1,
  YM-1, TGF-β, MMPs and dectin-1. In MDSCs, curcumin downregulated YM-1 expression
  while upregulating iNOS and COX-2 expression. Therefore, one possible pathway for
  the anti-cancer activities of curcumin is the polarization of MDSCs into an M1 phenotype.
  The polarization of MDSCs towards an M1-like phenotype may have been caused, in
  part, by the inhibition of the Stat3 pathway by curcumin. Furthermore, NF-κB and
  STAT3 signaling pathways in MDSCs are inhibited by curcumin, which also reduces
  IL-6 production. This prevents tumor formation and the IL-6/Stat3 pathway in cancer
  cells. Curcumin reduces tumor growth, prevents cancer cells from interacting with
  MDSCs, induces MDSC differentiation, and suppresses MDSC activation. According to
  these findings, curcumin inhibits carcinogenesis by a novel pathway, and targeting
  MDSCs could be a useful approach for cancer treatment and prevention. Abbreviations:
  MDSCs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; STAT3,
