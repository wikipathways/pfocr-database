caption: Proposed mechanism for the male-specific heart phenotype in insulin-resistant
  Pcyt2+/− mice. Both male and female Pcyt2+/− hearts exhibit similarly reduced fatty
  acid and glucose uptake and insulin resistance. The Pcyt2 gene deficiency directly
  alters membrane phospholipid homeostasis and side-chain fatty acid remodeling. There
  is a strong sexual dimorphism in the heart n-6 PUFA elongation/desaturation pathway.
  Pcyt2 deficiency specifically increases the conversion of linoleic acid (18:2n-6)
  to arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) in Pcyt2+/− male heart. This instigates oxidative
  stress in the heart and vasculature and elevates the AceI expression level in the
  Pcyt2+/− male heart, leading to the development of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy.
  Low testosterone levels in Pcyt2+/− males are the result of deregulated steroidogenesis
  and possibly add to cardiovascular dysfunction. On the contrary, Pcyt2+/− females
  are protected from heart disease. Unmodified membrane phospholipids and n-6 PUFA
  and elevated n-3 PUFA levels protect female Pcyt2+/− heart and vasculature from
  oxidative stress, cardiac dysfunction, and hypertension. Although females experience
  reduced substrate uptake as much as the male Pcyt2+/− heart, the female Pcyt2+/−
  heart has more TAG, utilizes TAG more efficiently, and stimulates the expression
  of Scd1 for oleic acid synthesis and Mct1 for lactic and glutamic acid transport
  to compensate for the lack of exogenous substrates.
