caption: A. Liver-derived, systemically circulating complement can be activated through
  the classical, lectin or alternative pathway. Via the formation of C3 convertases
  (C4bC2a for the classical and lectin pathways and C3bBb for the alternative pathway),
  these pathways lead to generation of C3b and C3a. Upon subsequent generation of
  C5 convertase (C4bC2aC3b for the classical and lectin pathways, C3bBbC3b for the
  alternative pathway), C5b and C5a are produced, with surface-bound C5b initiating
  the formation and insertion of the MAC on pathogens (or other target membranes).
  B. Local complement activation is triggered when activating signals (here, TCR stimulation
  or TLR activation on APCs (not shown)) initiate generation and secretion of C3,
  C5, Factor B, and Factor D, leading to C3 and C5 convertase formation in the extracellular
  space and on the cell surface – and ultimately the generation of the complement
  activation fragments C3a, C3b, C5b and C5a (C3 and C5 can also be cleaved by proteases
  in the extracellular space). These complement fragments bind to their respective
  receptors on the T cell surface and induce cellular responses. Note that such autocrine
  activation is also supported by preformed C3 and C5 activation fragments that are
  generated intracellularly (C), and rapidly transported to the cell surface to mediate
  autocrine signaling from that location. C. Intracellular complement activation in
  CD4+ T cells (and possibly other cells) occurs through the action of the C3-cleaving
  protease CTSL for C3, while the protease activating C5 is currently undefined. The
  resulting C3a and C5a fragments engage intracellular C3aR and C5aR1, respectively,
  and mediate effector function. Intracellular C3aR signaling occurs on lysosomes,
  while the intracellular compartment(s) expressing C5aR1 is, respectively are not
  yet defined. Self-tissue is protected from inappropriate complement deposition through
  fluid phase and cell-bound regulators (not shown in this schematic). C3b and C4b
  are inactivated by serine protease factor I, which requires one of several cofactor
  proteins (cell-bound CD46 and CR1 (CD35), or fluid phase factors H and C4bp). The
  C3 and C5 convertases are regulated through disassembly by regulators that have
  decay accelerating activity (DAA) (membrane-bound CD55 and CR1 (CD35), factor H
  and C4bp). The formation of the MAC is controlled by CD59 and protein S (vitronectin).
  CTSL, cathepsin L; MASP2, mannose-binding lectin serine protease 2; TCR, T cell
  receptor.
