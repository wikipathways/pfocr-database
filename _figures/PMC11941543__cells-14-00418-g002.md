caption: 'Schematic illustration of influenza virus interaction with autophagy. Influenza
  virus induces mitochondrial damage through viral NP and PB1-F2 proteins by release
  of ROS and IFN dysregulation that induces viral replication. The NP and M2 viral
  proteins, by attachment to LC3 and NS1 proteins through the interaction of BECN1
  with PK3C3, induce autophagosome accumulation. Upregulation of HSP90AA1 and the
  involvement of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway following viral infection cause autophagosome
  accumulation. This figure was created with BioRender.com. Licensing Right: HP27RKPZNV'
