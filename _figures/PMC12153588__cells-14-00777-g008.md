caption: 'Schematic representation of the PLCγ pathway’s role in cytoskeletal regulation
  during axon guidance. Activated by FGF signaling, PLCγ hydrolyzes PIP2 to generate
  DAG and IP3. DAG activates PKC, which phosphorylates actin-binding proteins (calponin
  and caldesmon) via MAPK to modulate actin polymerization and stress fibers, while
  PKC-MAPK also targets tau to influence microtubule stability. DAG directly regulates
  neurofilament phosphorylation, which is critical for axonal integrity. IP3 elevates
  Ca2⁺ levels via IP3 receptors, engaging Ca2⁺-dependent kinases like GSK3β and AMPK,
  which further modulate cytoskeletal dynamics. RhoA GTPase is involved in coordinating
  actin remodeling. Red arrows: the sequence of signals activation'
