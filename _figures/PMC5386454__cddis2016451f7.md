caption: 'A schematic representation of the proposed model: possible mechanism of
  Gm4419 via the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome central inflammatory pathway induced inflammation,
  fibrosis and proliferation under high-glucose conditions. Gm4419, which increased
  in high-glucose levels, upregulated nuclear NF-κB (p65/p50) expression and nuclear
  translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, led to an enhanced nuclear NF-κB
  expression and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and induced p50 binding to Gm44419
  and NLRP3 inflammasome promoter regions. Subsequently, nuclear p50 promoted the
  transcription of Gm4419, increased the expression of nuclear Gm4419 that raised
  the expression of Gm4419 in cytoplasm of cells. Thus, they formed a positive feedback
  in Gm4419/NF-κB signaling. In the meantime, p50 promoted transcription of NLRP3
  inflammasome and downstream genes: pro-inflammatory cytokines including mcp-1, TNF-α
  and IL-1β, and fibrosis biomarkers including Fn and Col.IV'
