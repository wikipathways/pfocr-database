caption: Proposed roles of RSV NS proteins in suppression of host innate immune responses.
  NS1 and NS2 can target different proteins that are necessary for the host antiviral
  immune response. (A) The existence of an NS degradasome (NSD) complex encompassing
  NS1 and NS2 together with several host factors in RSV-infected cells has been proposed.
  The NSD might be involved in the degradation of RIG-I, TRAF3, IKKε, IRF3, IRF7,
  and STAT2. (B) The binding of RIG-I to MAVS is abrogated by both NS proteins, where
  NS1 interacts with MAVS and NS2 targets RIG-I. This results in a cooperative suppression
  of downstream MAVS signaling. (C) NS1 interacts with TRIM25, which is responsible
  for ubiquitination and subsequent activation of RIG-I. (D) NS2 binds to MDA5, which
  is then less available for binding to MAVS. (E) NS1 can directly interact with both
  IRF3 and its coactivator CBP, attenuating the interaction between the latter two.
  This results in decreased recruitment of IRF3 to the IFN-β promoter, inhibiting
  IFN-β synthesis. In addition, NS1 and NS2 might also disrupt the activation and
  nuclear shuttling of IRF3. In combination with NSD targeting IRF7, these observations
  all result in decreased transcription of type I and III IFNs. (F) NS1 and NS2 activate
  the PI3K/AKT pathway, subsequently leading to NF-κB activation. NF-κB is involved
  in the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes. (G) NS1 and NS2 induce expression
  of SOCS1 and SOCS3, leading to inhibition of JAK activity and downstream signaling.
  (H) Decreased STAT2 expression levels are observed upon expression of NS1 and NS2.
  In addition, STAT2 seems to be a substrate of the NSD complex, leading to impaired
  JAK/STAT signaling and reduced transcription of ISGs. (I) Ectopic expression of
  NS1 results in reduced protein levels of the antiviral ISG products OASL, IFIT1,
  and IFITM3. (J) Nuclear NS1 colocalizes with the Mediator complex and associates
  with chromatin, resulting in suppressed transcription of IFN-induced antiviral genes.
