caption: Schematic (simplified) representation of enzymatic and metabolite components
  of the liver methionine metabolic pathway, and the influence of ethanol consumption.
  MAT requires ATP for the catalytic production of the methyl donor SAM from methionine.
  Methylation reactions that use SAM as a methyl donor produce the byproduct SAH.
  The metabolic ratio of SAM to SAH is modified by GNMT which utilises SAM in the
  catalytic conversion of glycine to sarcosine. Ethanol consumption results in a disruption
  in the activities and metabolite levels of methionine metabolic pathway components,
  and results in a lowering of hepatic SAM levels and an elevation of hepatic SAH
  levels. Collectively, these metabolite changes compromise methyltransferase activity
  from both reduced bioavailability of SAM and enzymatic inhibition by SAH. Inhibition
  of PIMT by this means, results in an elevation of cellular isoaspartate protein
  damage, which is generally detrimental to protein function. Elevated isoaspartate
  protein damage may also arise as a result of protein conformational changes induced
  directly from redox stress. Here we show that betaine supplementation to ethanol-fed
  rats can trigger the concerted upregulation of BHMT-1, MAT-1, and GNMT, which provide
  sequential SAM production, and a normalisation of the SAM:SAH ratio. SAH can be
  hydrolysed by SAH hydrolase (SAHH) resulting in a reversible equilibrium with adenosine
  and homocysteine. Completion of the cycle in reformation of methionine from homocysteine
  arises from either vitamin B12 dependent methionine synthase (MS) activity utilising
  methyl-tetrahydrofolate (THF), or from BHMT activity using betaine and producing
  dimethylglycine (DMG). Homocysteine can also be catabolised through the transsulfuration
  pathway catalysed by cystathionine β-synthase (CβS) using serine to form cystathionine.
  Cystathionine can be further processed via intermediates of cysteine, and then γ-glutamylcysteine,
  for production of reduced glutathione (GSH). Glutathione is the most prevalent cellular
  non-protein thiol critical for resisting cellular redox stress by its conjugation
  to electrophiles thereby forming glutathione disulphide (GSSG). GSSG can subsequently
  be reduced back to GSH by glutathione reductase. GSTs catalyse the conjugation of
  endogenous and exogenous electrophiles to glutathione. CA-III is linked to the methionine
  metabolic pathway via an active formation of two disulphide bonds with glutathione
  molecules, under conditions of a redox stress insult, with an estimate that CA-III
  could bind approximately 10% of the total liver glutathione pool if CA-III was completely
  S-glutathiolated . Acute or chronic ethanol consumption results in a reduction in
  hepatic glutathione levels, and herein we show that ethanol also depletes hepatic
  CA-III protein levels. Hence we hypothesise that their combined reduction may limit
  cellular ability to counter subsequent or sustained ethanol-induced redox stress;
  a component of ethanol-induced apoptotic cell death.
