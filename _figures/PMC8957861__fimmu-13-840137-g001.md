caption: 'Physiological and pathological conditions and treatments involving IIIS
  activation. The IIIS consists of the cascade systems of the blood: the complement
  system (A), the contact or kallikrein/kinin system (KKS) (B), the tissue factor
  (TF) pathway of the coagulation system (C), and the fibrinolytic system (D). Activation
  of IIIS occur in response to physiological stimuli such as microorganisms or necrotic,
  apoptotic or virus infected cells (top in figure), which leads to thromboinflammation.
  But also during pathological or therapeutic conditions such as ischemia during transplantation,
  or treatment with biomaterials e.g. stents, intravascular devices, and extracorporeal
  treatment (bottom in figure) a similar reaction occur. (A) The complement system
  has three activation pathways, which are triggered by different recognition molecules.
  The classical pathway (CP) is initiated by C1q, which binds to antigen bound IgG
  and IgM, but also to negatively charged surfaces and target-bound pentraxins e.g.
  CRP and pentraxin 3. The lectin pathway (LP) is activated by a number of carbohydrate
  binding proteins (lectins) such as mannan binding lectin (MBL), Ficolin-1, -2, -3
  and Collectin 10/11 (). The alternative pathway (AP) is be activated/regulated by
  surface-specific binding of factor H, C3 or properdin to a target, and has its main
  role as an amplifier. Complement activation leads to assembly of two enzyme complexes
  C4bC2a and C3bBb, which cleave C3 into the anaphylatoxin C3a and surface bound C3b
  (opsonization) and cleaves C5, which initiates the formation of the membrane attack
  complex (MAC) and the more potent anaphylatoxin C5a. (B) The primary function of
  the kallikrein/kinin and coagulation systems is in hemostasis but both systems are
  also engaged in inflammation. The recognition molecule in the contact/KK system
  is factor XII (FXII), which is activated, e.g., by negatively charged molecules
  such as LPS, glycosaminoglycans or extracellular matrix molecules exposed to the
  blood stream. The KK system also initiates an amplification loop, which involves
  prekallikrein that cleaves high molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) leading to the
  generation of the proinflammatory mediator bradykinin (BK). (C) The main physiological
  trigger of coagulation, tissue factor (TF), is exposed in a functionally active
  form only after damage to vessels and activation of blood cells including platelets.
  It thereby initiates the extrinsic part of the coagulation cascade, which leads
  to formation of high amounts of thrombin. (D) The fibrinolytic system is initiated
  when urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activate plasminogen to plasmin,
  which degrades a formed fibrin network to soluble fibrin fragments. Please see the
  text for information on the roles of monocytes, PMNs and platelets.'
