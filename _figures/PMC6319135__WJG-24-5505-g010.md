caption: 'Metabolic pathway map of potential biomarkers. The red and blue font represents
  potential biomarkers that were up- and down-regulated by Polygonatum kingianum treatment,
  respectively. The blue, black and green box represents amino acid, sugar and lipid
  metabolism, respectively. A: Phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis,
  and phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism; B: Tryptophan metabolism; C: Valine,
  leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; D: Starch and sucrose metabolism; E: Glycerophospholipid
  metabolism; F: Arachidonic acid metabolism; G: Linoleic acid metabolism; H: Nicotinate
  and nicotinamide metabolism; and I: Sphingolipid metabolism. TCA: Tricarboxylic
  acid.'
