caption: 'IL-17 family and treatments acting on the IL-17 pathway. Illustration of
  the different IL-17 ligands and receptors, and scheme of the intracellular signaling
  cascade (using an example of the activation of the IL-17A receptor). * IL-17D is
  not represented as its receptor remains unidentified; neither is IL-17B for the
  sake of simplicity. SEFIR: SEF/IL-17 receptor; SEFEX: SEFIR extension; CBAD: C/EBPß
  activation domain; and TRAF: TNF-receptor associated factor. Circles mean the blocking
  target of each therapy: those within yellow circles blocked by Brodalumab, those
  within green circle blocked by Secukinumab and Ixekizumab and those within pink
  circle blocked by Bimekizumab. This illustration has been elaborated from information
  available in references [,,,].'
