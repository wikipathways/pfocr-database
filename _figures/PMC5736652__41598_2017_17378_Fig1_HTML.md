caption: Chemogenomics component of the QSP platform. (a) Libraries of mechanism annotated
  probe compounds are screened in a clinically relevant phenotypic assay to identify
  phenotype modulating probes. (b) Targets for the active probes are identified from
  various drug-target databases and then are associated with biological pathways using
  information from protein-pathway databases. (c) Using a systems level analysis of
  all pathways identified, computational analysis is performed to predict the optimal
  modulating pathways/networks based on the activity of the respective probes (i.e.,
  activation or inhibition of pathways in relation to the known effects of the pathway
  on the phenotype). (d) Predicted pathway/network hypotheses are tested in phenotypic
  assays by i) testing additional compounds known to modulate the pathways, ii) testing
  compounds predicted by advanced machine learning methods that will modulated the
  pathway, iii) modulate pathways by knock-down and knock-in approaches, and/or iv)
  evaluate probes in pathway specific phenotypic assays. If pathways are not confirmed,
  then the hypothesis is refined with the new information gained from the testing,
  additional probes are identified, and the new hypothesis is tested. If pathways
  are confirmed, then the active probes are advanced to in vivo testing. (e) At the
  initial screening analysis stage, the heterogeneity of phenotype modulating response
  is assessed. If no heterogeneity is detected, then proceed as above. However, if
  heterogeneity is detected, then hypotheses are developed and tested to characterize
  the basis of the heterogeneity (e.g., effects of combinations of different compounds).
  The information gained from the heterogeneity analysis is used to inform the prediction
  of the phenotype modulating pathways/networks. (f) The outputs of this strategy
  are i) a systems level understanding of the pathways/networks involved in the clinically
  relevant phenotype which enables the design of optimal therapeutic strategies, and
  ii) probes/drugs that can be advanced to in vivo and clinical testing.
