caption: Multiple signaling pathways that p38γ mainly involved in a range of cancer
  diseases. (1) p38γ regulates the ubiquitination of RhoC related to metastasis to
  control cell movement and promote the metastasis of BC. (2) ErbB2/ErbB4/p38γ/GATA3/miR-200b/Suz12
  pathway promotes the acquisition of the EMT phenotype, which may mediate the aggressiveness
  of BC. (3) The silencing of p38γ in intestinal epithelial cells can reduce the expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activity of β-Catenin/Wnt pathway in colon
  tissue, thereby successfully linking inflammation with CRC, leading to tumorigenesis
  of CRC. (4) Upregulated p38γ can phosphorylate Hsp27 protein by activating the downstream
  kinase MK2, which binds to transcription factor proteins such as Sox2, Oct4, and
  Nanog to cause ubiquitination and degradation, thereby inhibiting the cancer stem
  cell characteristics and tumor initiating ability of NSCLC. (5) As the upstream
  of p38γ, K-Ras promotes the activation of p38γ, increases the expression of PFKFB3
  and GLUT2, thus encourages aerobic glycolysis and facilitates the occurrence of
  PDAC. Throughout the process, cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 produced by p38γ
  link the inflammation and cancer; PFD is able to specifically inhibit the phosphorylation
  of p38γ.
