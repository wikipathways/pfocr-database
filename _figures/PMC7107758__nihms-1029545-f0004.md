caption: Examples of mechanisms of resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF-V600E
  melanoma are depicted.,,,,, Inhibitors shown as blue circles. Yellow stars denote
  mutants present prior to drug exposure; red stars denote secondary mutations that
  can happen as a result of inhibitor treatment. Red arrows indicate upregulation
  of protein expression and/or other cellular pathways. Resistance can occur as a
  result of changes within the ERK pathway itself, including BRAF upregulation; upregulation
  and heterodimerization of other Raf isoforms or BRAF splice forms; activation of
  MEK by MLK; MEK mutations; upregulation or mutation of Ras isoforms; and upregulation
  of receptor tyrosine kinases. Suppression of negative feedback in the ERK pathway,
  for example, through mutation/loss of NF1, can result in resistance. Resistance
  can also arise by kinome remodeling at the RTK level and upregulation of alternate
  signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt/mTOR. Changes in the tumor microenvironment, as
  well as metabolic reprogramming to promote glycolysis or MITF overexpression, can
  also overcome ERK pathway inhibition
