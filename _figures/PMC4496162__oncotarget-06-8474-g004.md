caption: Necroptosis is triggered by TNF receptor superfamily members, TLRs, IFNRs,
  TCR, cellular metabolic and genotoxic stresses, and anticancer drugs. In TNF-α-induced
  necroptosis, the engagement of TNFR1 recruits Complex I (composed of TRADD, RIP1,
  TRAF2, CYLD, and cIAP1/2). In this complex, cIAP1 and cIAP2 ubiquitinate RIP1, whereas
  CYLD deubiquitinates RIP1. Polyubiquitinated RIP1 promotes NF-κB activation and
  prevents the formation of Complex II a (composed of caspase-8, FADD, RIP1) and Complex
  II b (composed of caspase-8, FADD, RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL), thus promoting cell survival
  and inhibiting apoptosis and necroptosis. RIP1 deubiquitination enables Complex
  II a formation, but whether the cell undergoes necroptosis is dependent on caspase-8
  activity. Activated caspase-8 cleaves RIP1 and RIP3 and blocks necroptosis. However,
  if caspase-8 is inactivated by a pharmacological inhibitor (e.g., zVAD), an endogenous
  inhibitor (e.g., c-FLIPS) or genetic caspase-8 or FADD inhibition/deletion, it loses
  the capacity to cleave RIP1 and RIP3, leading to the trans-phosphorylation of these
  two kinases and the formation of a filamentous-like complex termed the necrosome.
  The RIP1-RIP3 necrosome subsequently recruits and activates MLKL and PGAM5. MLKL
  is phosphorylated by RIP3 and then forms a homotrimer that translocates to the plasma
  membrane, and this event leads to necrotic plasma membrane permeabilization. Upon
  necrosis induction, PGAM5S recruits and activates Drp1, which leads to mitochondrial
  fission, which is an early and necessary step for necrosis execution. The miRNAs
  involved in the regulation of key components of the necroptotic pathway are shown
  in the diagram in dark blue. TLRs, Toll-like receptors; TCR, T-cell receptor; IFNRs,
  interferon receptors; TNFR1, TNF-α receptor 1; TRADD, TNFR1-associated death domain
  protein; TRAF2, TNF receptor-associated factor 2; CYLD, cylindromatosis; cIAP1/2,
  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1/2; RIP1, receptor-interacting protein kinase 1,
  also referred to as RIPK1; IKK, IκB kinase; c-FLIPS, cellular FLICE-like inhibitory
  protein, short form. PGAM5, phosphoglycerate mutase 5; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase
  domain-like; Drp1, dynamin-related protein 1.
