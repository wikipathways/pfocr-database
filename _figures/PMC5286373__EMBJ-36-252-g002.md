caption: 'The first reaction of the EMP converts glucose (Glc) to glucose 6‐phosphate
  (G6P), which is either converted to fructose 6‐phosphate (F6P) or shunted to the
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which
  converts G6P to 6‐phosphogluconate (6PG). Five steps later in the EMP, 3‐phosphoglycerate
  (3PG) is either converted to 2‐phosphoglycerate (2PG) or shunted to the serine synthesis
  pathway (SSP) by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which converts 3PG to 3‐phosphohydroxypyruvate
  (3PHP). The PPP generates cytosolic NADPH, whereas the SSP can lead to the generation
  of either cytosolic or mitochondrial NADPH. Cellular O2 availability determines
  flux through these pathways in breast cancer cells: Hypoxia represses G6PD expression
  and induces the expression of PHGDH, LDHA, and PDK1. PEP, phospho‐enol‐pyruvate;
  Pyr, pyruvate; Lac, lactate; GLY, glycolytic end‐product.'
