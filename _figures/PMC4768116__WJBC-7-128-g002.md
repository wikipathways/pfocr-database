caption: 'Activation of nuclear factor-κB: Canonical and non-canonical pathways. The
  NF-κB family comprises five members characterized by the presence of a Rel homology
  domain, which mediates DNA binding and dimerization. To allow prompt and efficient
  activation in response to stimuli, NF-κB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm
  in an inactive form via interaction with IκB proteins. Activation of NF-κB quickly
  follows ligand-induced stimulation of a variety of receptors, including TNF, IL-1,
  Toll-like, and BCR and TCR. The two principal signaling mechanisms that lead to
  activation of specific NF-κB heterodimers are the canonical and non-canonical pathways.
  In the case of canonical signaling, receptor-mediated signaling is transmitted via
  recruitment and/or activation of various upstream signaling components that promote
  activation of the IKK complex, which consists of catalytic kinase subunits IKKα
  and IKKβ and a regulatory scaffold protein called NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO;
  also called IKKγ). Once the IKK complex is activated, the steps directing canonical
  NF-κB stimulation are generally shared, regardless of the upstream stimulus. Selectivity
  is thought to reside mostly in the unique, “private” pathways utilized by distinct
  receptors for communication with the IKK complex. In the case of antigen receptors,
  assembly of the CBM signalosome is critical for this to occur. Upon activation of
  the IKK complex, the IKKβ kinase subunit phosphorylates IκBα, marking it for lysine
  (K)48-linked ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the proteasome, which
  represents the commitment step for canonical NF-κB activation. Newly freed NF-κB
  heterodimers, most commonly RelA (p65) and p50, translocate to the nucleus where
  they bind target sites within the promoters of a vast array of responsive genes
  to induce expression. Notably, the gene encoding IκBα is directly regulated by NF-κB
  and its synthesis serves as a negative feedback loop, thus attenuating and resetting
  the canonical NF-κB machinery. In contrast to the multitude of stimuli and signaling
  intermediates that activate canonical NF-κB, a relatively small number of cell-surface
  receptors promote non-canonical NF-κB activation. These include the BAFF, LT-β,
  and CD40 TNF superfamily receptors. Stimulation of non-canonical NF-κB centers on
  stabilization and activation of the critical upstream regulator, NIK. In resting
  cells, NIK is targeted for K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation
  by a complex of proteins that includes cIAP1, cIAP2, TRAF2 and TRAF3, which together
  function as a “destruction complex” and constitutively represses NIK activity. Ligand
  binding to selective TNF superfamily receptors promotes degradation of TRAF3, the
  protein which links NIK to cIAP1/2 and TRAF2, thereby freeing NIK from the destruction
  complex and allowing its stabilization and activation. Then, NIK phosphorylates
  and activates the IKKα kinase subunit, which in turn phosphorylates the NF-κB2 precursor
  p100, targeting it for partial proteasomal degradation to p52. Like IκBα, p100 contains
  C-terminal ankyrin repeats that are responsible for cytoplasmic retention of RelB/p100
  complexes in unstimulated cells. Freed RelB/p52 dimers also undergo nuclear translocation
  and drive transcription of appropriate genes in a manner analogous to the canonical
  RelA/p50 heterodimer complexes. Unlike canonical NF-κB signal termination, negative
  regulation of non-canonical NF-κB is less well-characterized. It appears to depend
  on reciprocal IKKα-dependent phosphorylation of NIK on C-terminal serine residues,
  which leads to TRAF/cIAP complex-independent NIK destabilization. However, more
  work is needed to fully define the mechanism involved in attenuating the non-canonical
