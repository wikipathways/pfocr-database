caption: GM-CSF initially binds to the low-affinity GM-CSF receptor α chain (α), followed
  by association with the affinity-enhancing β chain (β) and constitutively associated
  Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) resulting in assembly of a dodecameric structure signaling
  complex.At low concentrations of GM-CSF (<300 pg/ml), as are normally present in
  normal healthy tissues, signaling occurs through Ser585 of the β chain and results
  in myeloid cell survival and GM-CSF stimulated expression of some GM-CSF-dependent
  TLR-4 signaling pathway components, CD14, RP105, and IRAK-M (dotted lines); other
  components are not affected by GM-CSF. Both GM-CSF-dependent and GM-CSF-independent
  components are required for normal responses to LPS. At high concentrations of GM-CSF
  (>300 pg/ml), signaling via Ser585 is extinguished and signaling occurs exclusively
  via residue Tyr577, activating STAT5 signaling, which enhances NFκB activity and
  the LPS response. Adapted from reference [].
