caption: Schematic representation of cellular mechanisms possibly implicated in miRNA
  dysregulation in prion diseases. The canonical miRNA biogenesis and function pathway
  is indicated in green boxes. Mechanisms possibly contributing to miRNA dyregulation
  in prion diseases are indicated with dashed red lines. miRNA genes, residing in
  exonic, intronic or intergenic regions, are transcribed by RNA polymerase II or
  III (1). Altered miRNA gene transcription rate may impact miRNA levels. This can
  be associated to altered (≠) abundance of Transciption Factors (TF) inducing miRNA
  gene expression (e.g., STAT3), and/or to Single Nucleotide Variants (SNPs) residing
  within miRNA-gene promoter regions (e.g., rs57095329, illustrated as solid red line).
  Upon transcription, pri-miRNAs’ flanking sequences are removed by the microprossesor
  complex, containing Drosha and DGCR8 (2). This processing generates pre-miRNA stem-loop
  structures (3). Pre-miRNAs are exported into the cytoplasm through Exportin5 (EXPO5).
  Dicer removes the pre-miRNA loop, generating a miRNA duplex (4). SNPs in miRNA genes
  may interfere with pri- and/or pre-miRNAs processing by Drosha/DGCR8 (2) and Dicer
  (4) respectively. RNA editing, mediated by ADARs and/or APOBEC1, may occur in pri-
  and/or pre-miRNAs, introducing Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) with the potential
  to affect miRNA maturation (2, 4). Reduced Drosha, DGCR8 and Dicer levels, reported
  in human prion diseases, may impact miRNA maturation (2, 4). Following Dicer processing,
  the miRNA duplex is loaded from the RISC-loading complex (RLC) onto RISC. Ago proteins,
  are core components of RISC, forming the active functional unit of the miRNA-mediated
  gene regulation (5). Abnormal subcellular localization of Ago proteins, reported
  in sCJD, may affect miRNA machinery (5). PrPC-Ago interactions, which stabilize
  RISC, may be affected by PrPSc presence. Similarly, PrPSc could possibly impact
  PrPC-Dicer interactions and thus miRNA maturation and function. Incorporated into
  the RISC complex, miRNAs promote either translational repression or mRNA degradation,
  according to sequence complementary (5). SNPs in miRNA seed sequences and/or RNA
  editing events possibly occurring within miRNA seed sequences may impact miRNA-target
  mRNA interactions and even redirect miRNAs in new targets (5).
