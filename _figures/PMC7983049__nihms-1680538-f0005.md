caption: Metscape-derived Pathway based network of ‘Glycine serine alanine and threonine
  metabolism’; ‘Histidine metabolism’; ‘Purine metabolism’; ‘Urea cycle and metabolism
  of arginine, proline, glutamate, asparatate and asparagine’; with blood Pb associated
  metabolites in dark red Metabolites are shown in hexagons; metabolites from these
  pathways identified as significant in the metabolite ~ blood Pb analysis in 399
  men are in dark red. Reaction numbers are shown along the edges between the metabolite
  nodes.
