  Integrins activate RhoA, MAPK pathways, and actin fibers by FAs (including vinculin
  and talin) in response to mechanical stimulation. MAPK promotes osteogenesis through
  nuclear localization of ERK. The RhoA pathway and actin fibers promote osteogenesis
  through nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ. The mechanosensitive ion channels TRPV4
  and Piezo1 generate an intracellular Ca2+ influx after sensing mechanical stimulation,
  and Piezo1 promote osteogenic differentiation through nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ.

  description: Mechanism of MSCs sensing and responding to mechanical stimulation.
    MSCs sense external mechanical stimulation via integrins and mechanosensitive
    ion channels and transmit the mechanical signals via actin stress fibers and molecular
    pathways. Integrins activate RhoA, MAPK pathways, and actin fibers by FAs (including
    vinculin and talin) in response to mechanical stimulation. MAPK promotes osteogenesis
    through nuclear localization of ERK. The RhoA pathway and actin fibers promote
    osteogenesis through nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ. The mechanosensitive ion
    channels TRPV4 and Piezo1 generate an intracellular Ca2+ influx after sensing
    mechanical stimulation, and Piezo1 promote osteogenic differentiation through
    nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ. MSCs, mesenchymal stem cells; RhoA, Ras homolog
