caption: Schematic representation of the potential implications of IFITM proteins
  in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry at distinct stages of host cell trafficking. SARS-CoV-2
  exploits host cells by entry through an endosomal or a non-endosomal pathway as
  seen in most enveloped viruses, and replicating in newly induced double membrane
  vesicles (DMVs) shielded from host immune responses, as a characteristic of the
  coronavirus family. After binding to the ACE2 receptor, an activation of the S protein
  by pH dependent or pH independent proteases (serine and cysteine-like) is required
  for an efficient fusion. IFITM1 is expressed mainly at the plasma membrane level,
  while IFITM3 is mainly intracellular being integrated in the membranes of the endosomal
  compartments. IFTIM genes overexpression and proteins can act as cellular inhibitors
  of the early phases of the viral infectious cycle such as the entry and the fusion
  steps. (Adapted after Smith et al. []).
