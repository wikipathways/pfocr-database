caption: Design and steps of the epidemiologic analyses. Step 1 provides information
  on changes for 348 specific CpGs found in Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg immune genes
  described in . In Step 1 we checked each CpG of different genes individually. In
  Step 2, we tested whether the 348 CpGs of genes involved in T cell pathways changed
  more frequently from prepregnancy to early or late pregnancy than randomly selected
  CpGs from non-T cell-pathways. The two comparison groups of CpGs included first,
  10 subsets of randomly selected CpGs from all other non-T cell-pathways CpGs, and
  second, 10 subsets of randomly selected CpGs from other CD4+-genes (immune-related
  genes) [].
