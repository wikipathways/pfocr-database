caption: 'DNA damage response (DDR) and putative inhibitors of potential clinical
  importance. Single lightning bolt indicates damage to one strand of DNA. Double
  lightning bolt indicates damage to both strands of DNA. Upon DNA damage, the pathway
  is activated, leading to either G1/S phase checkpoint blockade or S phase prolongation
  and prevention of growth/mitosis. Repair of the DNA strand breaks lead to p53 activation,
  but in those cells with TP53 alterations, checkpoints are bypassed. Targeting the
  DDR pathway upstream of p53 will theoretically lead to cell death due to mitotic
  catastrophe. dsDNA: double stranded DNA; ssDNA: single-stranded DNA; G1/S: restriction
  checkpoint before DNA synthesis phase in cell cycle; S phase: synthesis phase; G2/M:
  growth phase checkpoint leading to mitotic phase. * Given the molecular similarities
  of CHK1 and CHK2, CHK1 inhibitors also have varying degrees of activity against
  CHK2. dsDNA: double stranded DNA; ssDNA: single-stranded DNA; G1/S: restriction
  checkpoint before DNA synthesis phase in cell cycle; S phase: synthesis phase; G2/M:
  growth phase checkpoint leading to mitotic phase.'
