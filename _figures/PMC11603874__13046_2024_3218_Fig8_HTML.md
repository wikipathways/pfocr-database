caption: Signals from Mb-TNF-α/TNFR2 stimulate HIF-1α, CXCR4, and PD-L1. Binding of
  Mb-TNF-α to TNFR2 activates the HIF-1α, CXCR4, and PD-L1 pathways. In the HIF-1α
  pathway, TNFR2 signals activate STAT3, mTOR, MYC, Notch, NF-κB, EGFR/ERK/Akt, PI3K/Akt,
  and PI3K/Akt/mTOR. HIF-1α can also activate BCL9, stimulating Wnt/β-catenin, which
  interacts with TRAF2, leading to TRAF 3, 5, and 6 accumulations inducing NF-κB activation.
  NF-κB subunits bind to specific sequences in the HIF-1α promoter, enhancing its
  stimulation. TRAF 6 can directly mediate HIF-1α activation via ubiquitination of
  K63. EGFR/ERK/Akt-mediated IκBα phosphorylation can also activate HIF-1α, creating
  a positive feedback loop of several signaling pathways. LIN28, activated by HIF-1α,
  upregulates TNFR2 expression. IKKβ and HIF-1α possess shared residues targeted at
  PHD1. FIH inhibits IKKε, preventing its binding to TRAF3/TBK1 proteins. In the CXCR4
  pathway, TNFR2 signals stimulate NF-κB, HER2, PI3K, Akt, mTOR, Wnt/βcatenin, the
  RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, and JAK/STAT. NF-κB subunits bind to CXCR4 and CXCL-12
  promoters, inducing its overexpression. HIF-1α, NF-κB, TGF-β, and HER2 can also
  enhance CXCR4 expression. VHL, a negative regulator of HIF-1α, down-regulates CXCR4,
  but is inactive in most solid tumors, leading to CXCR4 overexpression. In the PD-L1
  pathway, TNFR2 signals activate EGFR/ERK1/2/Akt and PI3K/Akt/ERK1/2, which in turn
  promote NF-κB, HIF-1α, cJUN, STAT3, and JAK/STAT3, up-regulating PD-L1. NF-κB-p65
  binds to the PD-L1 promoter, enhancing its expression. The PI3K/Akt/ERK1/2 pathway
  also stimulates Mucin-1, activating HER2, EGFR, and MYC, which further up-regulate
  PD-L1. Inhibition of NF-κB-p65 via BAY 11–7082 and JSH-23 abolished PD-L1 overexpression.
  These pathways support BC growth, development, immune escape, drug resistance, angiogenesis,
  and metastasis. TNFR2, tumor necrosis receptor type 2; Mb-TNF-α, membrane-bound
