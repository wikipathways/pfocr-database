caption: The role of creatine in the promotion of cancer malignancy. Creatine promotes
  various cancers through different mechanisms. These pathways include ROS manipulation,
  ATP supplementation, and signaling pathway activation. In HeLa cells, CKMT helps
  stabilize ATP levels and charges inside mitochondria, restricts ROS production,
  and stabilizes PT pores to prevent apoptosis [53]. Stabilizing CKMT through phosphorylation
  prevents its degradation and supports breast cancer growth [52]. Creatine’s ability
  to activate pathways such as MPS1, AKT, and MAPK supports lung, breast, and gastric
  cancer growth and migration [43,48,54]. The original energy-storing and boosting
  process also plays a key role in supporting the growth of cancers such as liver
  cancer and colon cancer [42,55]. In the context of pancreatic cancer, Tian et al.
  demonstrated that CARD9 deficiency enhances pancreatic cancer growth by impairing
  dendritic cell maturation through SLC6A8-mediated creatine transport. This finding
  suggests that targeting creatine transport and immune modulation could offer new
  therapeutic strategies for improving immune responses and limiting tumor growth
  in pancreatic cancer [56]
