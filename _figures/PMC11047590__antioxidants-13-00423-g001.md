caption: Redox systems involved in microglia. The NADPH Oxidase (NOX), thioredoxin
  (TRX), and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) systems constitute the redox
  homeostasis of the microglia’s internal environment. NOX2 is the main source of
  ROS generation in microglia. It reduces oxygen molecules to O2− or H2O2 by single-electron
  reduction dependent on NADPH. TRX-associated proteins are disulfide reductases that
  regulate the cellular redox state. Induced by various oxidative stresses, the TRX
  system scavenges ROS in association with TRX-dependent peroxiredoxins. As an endogenous
  inhibitor of the TRX system, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is transferred
  to the mitochondria after induction by ROS produced by NOX2. It activates the inflammatory
  body NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) and induces
  microglia to release the proinflammatory mediator IL-1β. In the meantime, the activation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway down-regulates the expression of antioxidant
  enzymes in microglia, further aggravating cellular oxidative stress. The transcription
  factor NRF2 binds to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) in the resting
  state and is fixed in the cytoplasm. Stimulated by oxidative stress, it separates
  from KEAP1 and translocates into the nucleus, binds to antioxidant response elements
  (ARE), and regulates the transcription-induced expression of multiple antioxidant
  genes
