caption: Schematic representation of G protein regulation of Aβ deposition and tau
  hyperphosphorylation-related signaling pathways. Aβ is derived from the amyloidogenic
  cleavage of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) mediated by α-, β-,
  and γ-secretases. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved by the β-secretase
  (BACE-1), which generates soluble amyloid precursor protein β (sAPPβ) and the β-C-terminal
  fragment (β-CTF, also termed C99). The latter is cleaved by γ-secretase to generate
  the Aβ peptide and the amyloid intracellular domain (AICD). The Aβ peptide aggregates
  to form Aβ oligomers (oAβ) and extracellular amyloid plaques (). In the non-amyloidogenic
  pathway, cleavage of APP by α-secretases [especially A disintegrin and metalloprotease
  9 (ADAM9), ADAM10, and ADAM17] generates sAPPα and carboxy-terminal fragment termed
  C83. Subsequent cleavage of C83 by the γ-secretase complex yields the AICD and a
  short fragment termed P3 (). Tau is an axonal protein expressed in mature neurons
  that promotes the self-assembly of tubulin into microtubules and its stabilization.
  The physiological function of tau depends on its phosphorylation status and is regulated
  by tau protein kinase and phosphatase. In AD brains, tau hyperphosphorylation under
  the abnormal regulation of protein kinases [e.g., glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)]
  results in the formation of NFTs (). Activation of Gαs protein activates adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) and promotes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generation. cAMP
  regulates Aβ deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation via activation of the extracellular
  regulated protein kinase (ERK) (), cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)
  (), silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), and GSK3β interaction
  protein/GSK3 (; ) signaling pathways in a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner
  (), and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC1)/Rap1 in a PKA-independent
  manner (). By contrast, activation of Gαi/o protein inhibits the cAMP/PKA pathway.
  Activation of Gβγ protein may regulate tau phosphorylation through phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB, also termed Akt)/GSK-3β pathway (). Activation
  of Gαq/11 protein activates phospholipase C (PLC) to produce inositol trisphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which in turn increases concentrations of intracellular
  calcium (Ca2+) and activates PKC, and leads to blocking of tau hyperphosphorylation
  and inactivation of GSK-3β (; ). Furthermore, the Gαq/11/PLC pathway can regulate
  Aβ generation through the MEK/ERK/CREB pathway, among others (). Activation of Gα12/13
  protein activates GSK-3β in a manner dependent on Ras homolog gene family, member
  A (RhoA) ().
