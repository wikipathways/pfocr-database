caption: Signaling pathways potentially involved in altered AT1 receptor function
  and enhanced myogenic reactivity in CHF. Evidence provided by  suggests that myogenic
  constriction is enhanced in heart failure and appears to be linked to altered AT1
  receptor function. These authors suggest that preformed and stored Ang II is released
  and local elevated Ang II levels increase myogenic tone. An alternative hypothesis
  is that the AT1 receptor itself, its coupling to Gq and/or phospholipase C (PLC)
  is (are) modified in heart failure leading to constitutive activation of this pathway.
  Future studies should be designed to investigate the possible role of downstream
  events such as smooth muscle membrane potential, voltage-dependent and stretch-activated
  cation and anion channels, mechanisms regulating global intracellular Ca2+ levels,
  the ryanodine receptor (RyR) which is responsible for generating Ca2+ sparks and
  inositol-tris-phosphate (IP3)-Ca2+ release channels, protein kinase C (PKC) and
  other kinases (Rho, Ras, MAPK, Erk, etc.), cytoskeletal and contractile proteins,
  all of which have been implicated to play role in generating myogenic tone ().
