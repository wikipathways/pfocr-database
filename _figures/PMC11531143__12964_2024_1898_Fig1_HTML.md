caption: A PIM kinase family gene structures. The gene structures of the PIM kinase
  family consist of six codons surrounded by large untranslated regions (UTR). Within
  each gene, there are alternative start codons (*) that correspond to different mRNA
  transcripts, resulting in various isoforms. These isoforms contain a serine/threonine
  kinase domain, with molecular weights ranging from 34–44 kDa. The largest isoform
  is depicted in detail, highlighting the locations of the kinase domain, hinge regions,
  and key sites such as K67, H68, P81, P123, and S261 for PIM1; P119, K121, D128,
  and E171 for PIM2; and Q86V86 and S190 for PIM3. B Transcription factors responsible
  for PIM1 gene transcription. Growth factors and cytokines found in cancer cells
  trigger the activation of intracellular tyrosine kinases and receptor-associated
  kinases, such as Janus Kinase. This leads to the activation of STATs through tyrosine
  phosphorylation. Once phosphorylated, STAT3s form dimers through phosphotyrosine-SH2
  linkage and move to the nucleus. In the nucleus, they promote the transcription
  of target genes, such as PIM1, resulting in the upregulation of PIM1 mRNA. Additionally,
  PIM protein levels are increased by hypoxia due to HIF1α. Green and red arrows represent
  activating and inactivating pathways, respectively
