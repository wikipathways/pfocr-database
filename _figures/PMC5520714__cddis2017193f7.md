caption: Schematic diagram on the mechanism of CaSR cardioprotection via attenuating
  high glucose-induced myocardial energy metabolism disorder. The downregulation of
  CaSR expression in cardiomyocytes induced by HG have a crucial role in myocardial
  energy metabolism disorder. The decreased CaSR expression causes upregulation of
  gp78 expression and activation of the ubiquitin proteasome system, which then degrades
  Mfn1, Mfn2, respiratory chain complex protein, Cx43, N-cadherin and β-catenin protein,
  and results in the decrease of ATP synthesis and the increase of ATP leakage through
  damaged gap junction. Therefore, CaSR agonists are expected to be a new target for
  the prevention and treatment of DCM
