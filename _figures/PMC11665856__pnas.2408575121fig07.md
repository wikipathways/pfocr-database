caption: Schematic diagram of a working model of PFOA stimulation of lung cancer metastasis.
  PFOA is significantly accumulated in lung adenocarcinoma patients, particularly
  in those with metastasis. PFOA primarily enters the body through dietary intake.
  This chemical is then transported systemically and accumulates in the lungs. PFOA
  directly influences tumor cells, facilitating the metastasis of lung cancer cells
  by regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular stiffness. The softening of tumor
  cells contributes to the reduced adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), enhanced
  immune evasion, and increased stemness, collectively driving tumor metastasis. Integrins
  on the cell membrane are potential targets of PFOA that activate the downstream
  FAK-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway to promote lung cancer development and metastasis.
