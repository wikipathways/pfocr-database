caption: Alternative splicing and metabolism. A. PKM forms PKM1 and PKM2 isoforms
  via alternative splicing, wherein PTBP1, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2, splicing factors are
  regulated by c-Myc and non-coding RNAs. B. PKM1 and PKM2 play a functional role
  in the glycolysis pathway, and lncRNA CCAT2 and miR23 affect the expression of KGA
  and GAC, thereby regulating the process of glutamine metabolism. NEK2, NIMA-related
  kinase 2; hnRNPA1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1; hnRNPA2, heterogeneous
  nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2; PTBP1, polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1; PKM1,
  pyruvate kinase M1; PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2; GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; SLC1A5,
  solute carrier family 1 member 5; GLS1, glutaminase 1; CFIM, cleavage factor I;
  KGA, glutaminase kidney isoform; GAC, glutaminase isoform C; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
