caption: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) alterations in insulin-like growth factor
  1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway. GDM (black arrows) and preeclampsia (green text and
  arrows) reduce insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) levels, increasing
  IGF-1 bioavailability, that promotes phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein
  kinase B (AKT) cascade (as well as energy-dense diets, orange text and arrows),
  activating mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), that results in cell
  survival and proliferation, motility and an augment nutrient transport, leading
  to fetal overgrowth, macrosomia, fetal adiposity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
  metabolic disorders and predisposition to obesity in adult life. Additionally, soluble
  form of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (sVEGFR-1) can bind to
  α5β1-integrin receptor (blue arrows), expressed predominantly in extravillous trophoblasts,
  activating the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), promoting fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia,
  that lead to β-cell exhaustion, a principal characteristic of GDM. This increase
  in insulin levels cause promote nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and fetal aerobic metabolism,
  both producing hypervascularization in the placenta, that could result in several
  physiological alterations in this organ, such as villous immaturity, villous fibroid
  necrosis, chorangiosis, increased placental weight and thickness, and decreased
  placental efficiency. Also, FAK activation is involved in angiogenesis in several
  organs, e.g., the placenta. Obesity before and/or during pregnancy (brown text and
  arrows) inhibit IGF-1 anti-inflammatory and mitochondrial protection activities,
  resulting in an increase in inflammation, ROS production and, hence, placental alterations.
  High-dense diets (red arrows) exacerbate GDM alterations, such as fetal overgrowth,
  macrosomia, fetal adiposity, inflammation, placental alterations and predisposition
  to disorders in adult’s life. ⊕ means enhancing protein activity.
