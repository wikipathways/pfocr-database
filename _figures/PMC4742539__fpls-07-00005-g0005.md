caption: Putative fructose and mannose metabolic pathway of D.officinale. Putative
  fructose and mannose metabolism of D.officinale was constructed based on KEGG annotation.
  A total of 135 unigenes were involved in the metabolic pathway. These unigenes were
  distributed in the rectangular boxes in the figure.
