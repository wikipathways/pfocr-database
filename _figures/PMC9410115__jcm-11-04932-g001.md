caption: 'The hemostatic pathways include the intrinsic and the extrinsic coagulation
  pathways. In the healthy state, endothelial cells maintain an antithrombotic property
  that ensures normal blood flow. Following vascular injury and the disruption of
  vascular endothelial integrity, FXII is activated by proteolytic cleavage resulting
  in the formation of FXIIa. FXIIa activates FXI into FXIa, which then activates FIX
  into FIXa in the presence of calcium. FIXa activates FX into FXa which binds thrombin-activated
  FVa forming the FXa/FVa complex that activates prothrombin into thrombin. Then,
  thrombin cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin forming the fibrin mesh and causing the
  cessation of blood loss. Thrombin also cleaves PAR1/4 and activates FV into FVa
  and FXI into FXIa, thus reinforcing the coagulation cascade. Thrombin also inhibits
  the binding of the endothelial-derived FVIII to exposed vWF and thus, accelerates
  the formation of the FVIII/vWF complex and the subsequent activation of FVIII into
  FVIIIa, which activates FIX into FIXa. Additionally, thrombin activity can be inhibited
  by ATIII. Parallel to the intrinsic pathway, the extrinsic pathway is activated
  in response to vascular trauma, which results in the secretion of TF. TF activates
  FVII into FVIIa and subsequently forms the TF-FVIIa complex, which activates FIX
  into FIXa. Activated platelets play a major role in the potentiation of both pathways
  by providing negatively charged surfaces following phospholipid bilayer rearrangement,
  which supports coagulation. Following primary and secondary hemostasis, fibrinolysis
  takes place. Fibrin degradation leads to the formation of FDP, which activates plasminogen
  into plasmin. TAFI, which is activated by low TM and the TM/thrombin complex into
  TAFIa, inhibits plasmin activity. TAFIa is inhibited by both high TM and protein
  C. Finally, protein C activates APC, which binds to protein S forming the APC/protein
  S complex, which inhibits the activity of FVa and FVIIIa. Abbreviations: APC, active
  protein C; ATIII, anti-thrombin III; EPCR, endothelial cell protein C receptor;
  F, factor; FDP, fibrin degradation products; GP, glycoprotein; PAR, protease-activated
  receptor; TAFI, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor; TF, tissue factor;
  TM, thrombomodulin; vWF, von Willebrand factor.'
