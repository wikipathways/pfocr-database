caption: Integration of metabolic pathwaysGlucose is metabolized to pyruvate through
  the glycolysis. Pyruvate (and fatty acids) enters the mitochondria where they are
  converted to acetyl-CoA. This enters the Krebs cycle that donates electrons to electron
  transport chain. Through OxPhos, electrons are sequentially transferred to generate
  a H+ gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which drives the synthesis
  ATP. In addition to the glycolysis, cells have the ability to metabolize alternative
  substrates, such as lipids and glutamine. FAO and glutaminolysis replenish the Krebs
  cycle intermediates acetyl-CoA and α-ketoglutarate, respectively, thereby fueling
  OxPhos. PPP generates riboses for nucleotides synthesis.PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  OxPhos, oxidative phosphorylation; FAO, fatty acid β-oxidation; ADP, adenosine diphosphate;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ETC, electron transport chain.
