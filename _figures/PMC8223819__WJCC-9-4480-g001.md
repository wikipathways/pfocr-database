caption: 'Schematic representation of antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infections.
  A: Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE): non-neutralizing
  antibodies bind to virus particles. Upon binding of virus-antibody complexes to
  FcγRII on antigen-presenting cells or B cells, FcγRII signals through an immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motif on its cytoplasmic tail to upregulate pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, downregulate anti-inflammatory cytokines, and suppress antiviral genes
  expression by inhibiting the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
  pathway and subsequent decrease in the antiviral transcription factors such as interferon
  regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2), resulting in increased
  viral replication due to suppression of the intracellular antiviral responses. Following
  internalization, virus–antibody immune complexes in the endosomes initiate signaling
  through toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, and TLR8 to activate immune cells. The
  accumulation of activated myeloid cells in the lung promotes inflammation and acute
  lung injury; B: Complement-mediated ADE: virus-antibody complexes activate the complement
  cascade, resulting in the formation of complement-coated virions and subsequent
  interaction with complement receptor (CR) on CR-bearing cells. The activated CR
  initiates intracellular signaling to promote endocytosis of the virus, suppress
  intracellular antiviral responses and increase viral replication. Furthermore, the
  formation and deposition of immune complexes in the lung can lead to cell lysis
  and tissue damage. ITAM: Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif.'
