caption: Overview of IL-6/JAK/STAT3 Classic, Trans-signaling, and Trans-presentation.
  Classic Signaling (left) occurs when IL-6 binds membrane-bound IL-6Rα leading to
  the subsequent formation of a trimeric receptor complex with signal-transducing
  subunit, gp130. Two trimeric IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 complexes bind through the D1 domain
  of gp130 to form a hexameric receptor complex for intracellular signaling through
  the JAK/STAT3 pathway. JAKs are recruited to the membrane and phosphorylate the
  cytoplasmic tail of gp130 and STAT3. pSTAT3 homodimerizes and translocates into
  the nucleus for activation of transcription. Trans-signaling (middle) occurs when
  IL-6Rα presents in a soluble form through mRNA alternative splicing or proteolysis
  by ADAM10/17. IL-6 binds sIL-6Rα to form a hexameric receptor complex through membrane-bound
  gp130 for signal transduction. Sgp130 antagonizes IL-6 signaling through sequestration
  of IL-6/sIL-6Rα. Trans-presentation (right), or “cluster signaling,” occurs between
  two different cells. A gp130 receptor complex on a receiving cell responds to a
  IL-6/IL-6Rα complex on a transmitting cell to induce downstream STAT3 signaling.
