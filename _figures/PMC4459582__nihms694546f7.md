caption: 'mRNAs that were significantly altered in lungs from Klf5Δ/Δ mice were subjected
  to literature mining to identify potential functional associations and regulatory
  relationships using Pathway Studio 5.0 (Ariadne Genomics). KLF5 influenced the expression
  of genes previously associated with various signaling pathways, including those
  regulated by PDGF, FGF and TGFβ. mRNAs increased in Klf5Δ/Δ mice are framed in red,
  those decreased are framed in green. Each line indicates a regulatory relationship
  between gene nodes based upon literature references. Regulatory relationships are
  denoted by line colors and patterns: purple lines represent binding; blue lines
  represent regulation of expression; the gray lines represent ‘regulation’; and arrows
  with a plus indicate positive regulation.'
