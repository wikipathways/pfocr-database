caption: Glucose metabolism in microglia under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions.
  Under homeostatic conditions, extracellular glucose is transported into microglial
  cells through specialized glucose transporters, where it is converted into pyruvate
  through cytoplasmic glycolysis. Pyruvate is then actively transported across the
  mitochondrial membrane to drive the TCA cycle. The energy and metabolites produced
  in the TCA cycle can then support the expression of the homeostatic microglial genes
  P2ry12 and Tmem119, which facilitate microglial functions of synaptic pruning and
  immune surveillance. In pro-inflammatory conditions, microglia have a broken TCA
  cycle and increase the expression of membrane transporters to facilitate the uptake
  of glucose and glutamine, thus driving enhanced glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Glycolysis
  is supported by increased expression of the rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis
  HK2 and PFKBP3. This leads to the increased generation of lactate and ATP to compensate
  for the broken TCA cycle, and shunting of metabolites into the pentose phosphate
  pathway. The increased glycolysis is sustained by the activation of nuclear transcription
  factors HIF1α and mTOR that support the synthesis and production of cytokines for
  secretion. Green arrows = homeostatic effects. Red arrows = pro-inflammatory effects.
