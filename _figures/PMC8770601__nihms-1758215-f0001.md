caption: 'Right upper panel (grey): Cleavage of vinyl ether bond of pGLP by oxidants
  (eg, hypochlorous acid (HClO) generated by myeloperoxidase (MPO) or peroxynitrite
  (ONOO-) result in the production of unusual lyso-GPLs with the retained sn-2 PUFA
  oxidizable residues. These types of lyso-GPLs can be readily be used as substrates
  of cyclooxygenases (COX) and lipoxygenases (LOX) to yield respective hydroperoxy-lyso-GPLs
  and their secondary oxygenated derivatives (including PGE2-lyso-GPLs) with multiple
  signaling functions.Middle panel (blue) : Canonical PLA2 catalyzed release of free
  PUFA from the sn-2 position of GPLs and subsequent oxygenation of liberated free
  PUFA by COX, LOX and isoforms of cytochrome P450 (CYP450). Among these oxygenated
  molecules formed are prostaglandins, prostacyclins, leukotrienes, lipoxins, hepoxilins,
  protectins, resolvins, maresins.Left panel (green) : LOX-catalyzed oxidation of
  GPL yields hydroperoxy-, hydroxy-, keto-, epoxy- and oxidatively- truncated GPL
  species with signaling functions. Hydrolysis of these peroxidized GPL by Ca2+-independent
  PLA2 (iPLA2) represents a non-canonical pathway leading to the formation of free
  oxygenated PUFA acting as lipid mediators.Right lower panel (white): non-enzymatic
  lipid peroxidation'
