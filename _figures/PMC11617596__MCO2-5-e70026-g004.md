caption: NAT10 plays a critical role in cancer. ac4C plays a positive role in regulating
  the progression of various cancers as illustrated. In bladder cancer, NAT10 is activated
  by NF‐κB signaling, promotes the expression of BCL9L, SOX4, AKT1 through ac4C to
  inhibit apoptosis of cancer cells. It also mediated DNA damage repair and chemotherapy
  resistance through ac4C modification of AHNAK and p21. In breast cancer, NAT10 promoted
  tumor chemoresistance by regulating the activation of EMT and ac4C modification
  of MDR1 and BCRP. Radiotherapy‐ and chemotherapy‐mediated DNA damage activates the
  ac4C modification of MORC2 to regulate the cell cycle, enhancing treatment resistance.
  In cervical cancer, NAT10 is transcriptionally activated by HOXC8, and it regulates
  the expression of GLUT4 and KHK by enhancing the ac4C modification of FOXP1, thus
  promoting tumor lactate production and the development of immunosuppressive microenvironment.
  In addition, NAT10 can be suppressed by circMAST1, affecting the stability of the
  critical transcription factor YAP1. In colorectal cancer, upregulation of NAT10
  promotes ac4C modification of FSP1 to facilitate ferroptosis resistance and stimulates
  WNT/β‐catenin pathway via KIF23. In various tumors, NAT10 mediates tumor progression,
  metastasis, therapy resistance, and the formation of immunosuppressive microenvironment
  by promoting ac4C activation of downstream oncogenic pathways. Khib, lysine 2‐hydroxyisobutyrylation;
