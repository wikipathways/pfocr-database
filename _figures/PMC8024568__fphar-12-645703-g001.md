caption: Schematic representation of IL-10, 13, 17, and 33 interaction mechanism with
  their specific receptors. IL-10 can form a homodimer that binds to the tetrameric
  heterodimer IL-10 receptor and initiates an intracellular signaling pathway involving
  STAT3 as key translocation nuclear factor. IL-13 binding to type II receptor complex
  leads to activation of JAK and phosphorylation of members of the STAT family. The
  IL-17 receptor complex, which consists of IL-17RA and IL-17RC, activates downstream
  signaling pathways by recruiting an adaptor molecule named Act1. IL-33 triggers
  MAPK and NF-κB leading to inflammatory response.
