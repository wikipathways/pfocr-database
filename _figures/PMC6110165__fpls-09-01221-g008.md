caption: 'Signaling pathway proposed for citrate and fumarate induce priming in Arabidopsis
  against PstDC3000. The scheme shows transcriptional and metabolomic changes induced
  by both TCAs during the priming phase and the primed stage (early and late responses
  of primed plants against bacterial infection) as well as phytohormone mutants in
  which citrate and fumarate were impaired in mounting priming. TCA-induced priming
  can be characterized in two branches: citrate and fumarate specific priming. In
  both cases the priming stage and priming phase exhibit distinct transcriptomic and
  metabolomics patterns. Citrate acts over PR1, SA and camalexin and is dependent
  on sid1 for early defenses responses. Late defenses responses relay on JA pathway.
  Fumarate on the other hand relay in SA and JA signaling during early and late responses.'
