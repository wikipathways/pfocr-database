  auris. Linear MAP kinase pathways (MAPKKK→MAPKK→MAPK) are represented in rectangles;
  upstream components are in ovals. Cek1 (green)-, Hog1 (orange)-, and Mkc1 (brown)-containing
  MAPK pathways are color coded. Open rectangles indicate either absence or reduced
  phosphorylation. (A) Lack of Ssk1 protein increases p-Cek1 (upward green arrow),
  reduction or absence of p-Hog1 (downward orange arrow), and partial reduction of
  p-Mkc1 (downward brown arrow). (B) Absence of HOG1 increases p-Cek1 (upward green
  arrow) but reduces p-Mkc1 (downward brown arrow). (C) MAPK signaling pathways such
  as Cek1, Hog1, and Mkc1 are illustrated. Modulation of signaling is indicated with
  either stimulatory arrows (→) or inhibitory arrows (⊣). Amphotericin B (AMB) and
  caspofungin (CAS) treatment triggers Mkc1 phosphorylation (blue and pink arrows,
  respectively). The Ssk1-driven pathway including Hog1 cross talk with Cek1 and Mkc1
  is shown in red arrows. Activating or inhibitory roles of Ssk1 may involve direct
  or indirect interactions with Ste11 or Cek1 (p-Cek1) or with Bck1 (p-Mkc1) (orange
  dashed arrows with question marks).
