caption: 'Schematic representation of apoptosis activation by ALA. (A) Several signals
  can trigger the activation of intrinsic pathway by ALA, for example: (1) generation
  of ROS, induction of SOD activity, and increase in intracellular Ca2+; (2) these
  signals promote mitochondrial depolarization, downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins
  (Bcl-xL and Bcl-2); (3) upregulation of proapoptotic proteins (Bad and Bax), VDAC,
  Apaf, as well as cytochrome c release; (4) proteolytic activation of caspases -9
  and -3; and (5) proteolytic cleavage of PARP. (B) Regarding the extrinsic pathway,
  there has been reported (6) high levels of FasL, activation of caspases-8, -3, -7,
  and DNA damage caused by (7) p-H2A.X. ALA: Alpha-linolenic acid. ROS: Reactive oxygen
  species. SOD: Superoxide dismutase. Bcl-xL: B-cell lymphoma-extra-large. Bcl-2:
  B-cell lymphoma 2. Bad: Bcl-2 associated agonist of cell death. Bax: Bcl-2 Associated
  X-protein. VDAC: Voltage-dependent anion channel. PARP: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.
  FasL: Fas ligand. DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid. P-H2A.X: Phospho-Histone H2A.X. MOMP:
  Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.'
