caption: A simplified representation of signalling pathways triggered by ADAM17 in
  diabetic nephropathy, gastric carcinoma and liver fibrosis. ADAM17 activation is
  required for high glucose (HG)-induced upregulation of the TGF-β1. HG also induces
  maturation of ADAM17 on the cell surface. Furthermore, FAK is identified as a central
  upstream regulator of HG-induced ADAM17 activation through its recruitment of both
  Src and PI3K, with subsequent phosphorylation of ADAM17. In addition, ADAM17, through
  an increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, induces EMT in gastric carcinoma cells.
  Finally, the role of ADAM17 in promoting EMT of HCC cells involves the activation
  of Notch signalling pathway, which occurs through Notch proteolytic cleavage.
