caption: 'Squalene biosynthesis in Y. lipolytica on various carbon sources, such as
  glucose, glycerol, and free fatty acids (FAs) from waste cooking oil (WCO). Black
  arrows indicate the endogenous squalene biosynthetic pathway metabolic pathway;
  target genes denoted in red were overexpressed in this study. The enzymatic activity
  of squalene oxidase ERG1 denoted in blue can be inhibited by terbinafine. Genes:
  HMGR, HMG-CoA reductase; ERG20, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase; ERG9, squalene
  synthase; MFE1, multifunctional enzyme; POT1, peroxisomal thiolase; DGA1, diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase; CAT2, peroxisomal carnitine acetyltransferases; ERG1, squalene
  epoxidase. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
