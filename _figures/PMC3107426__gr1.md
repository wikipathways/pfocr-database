caption: 'Glycolytic pathway and metabolic compartments in bloodstream form T. brucei.
  The shaded inset shows the route to methylglyoxal from dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA-3P) via an enediol intermediate. Each
  mol of NADH generated in step 7 is reoxidised via the glycerophosphate shuttle (steps
  6, 13 and 14) where glycerophosphate exits the glycosome in exchange for dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate. The location of enzymes in the glycosome and mitochondrion are bounded
  by single or double lines, respectively. Enzyme reaction steps are: 1, hexokinase;
  2, glucose 6-phosphate isomerase; 3, phosphofructokinase; 4, aldolase; 5, triose
  phosphate isomerase; 6, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+); 7, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; 8, phosphoglycerate kinase; 9, phosphoglycerate mutase;
  10, enolase; 11, pyruvate kinase; 12, glycerol kinase; 13, glycerol 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (FAD); 14; ubiquinol oxidase (trypanosome alternative oxidase). Other
  abbreviations: UQ9 and UQ9H2 are ubiquinone and ubiquinol, respectively.'
