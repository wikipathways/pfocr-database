caption: Microglia in the M1 Pro-Inflammatory State. M1 Microglia release pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β that propagate the pro-inflammatory response of
  itself and other microglia or inflammatory cells (A). They typically conform to
  an amoeboid morphology to allow for rapid chemotaxis and phagocytosis of cellular
  debris (B). In utilization of glucose, M1 microglia convert glucose to ATP using
  anaerobic metabolism (C), but can also shunt it (D). Shunts such as the pentose
  phosphate pathway can increase production of NADPH (E) and thus reactive oxygen
  and nitrogen species (RONS). Created with BioRender.com.
