caption: The one carbon (methyl group) metabolism in vivo. The interrelationship between
  folate and methionine metabolism and its regulation are displayed. As shown endogenous
  methyl groups originating from serine during its conversion to glycine are incorporated
  into the folate cycle to be transferred to homocysteine for the formation of methionine
  and ultimately s-adenosyl methionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor. The transfer
  of methyl groups is catalyzed by several different methyltransferases and result
  in the formation of s-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) and methylated products of proteins,
  lipids, DNA, creatine, phosphotidyl choline etc. SAH is then hydrolyzed to form
  homocysteine. Homocysteine is the branch point of the methionine cycle, is either
  methylated back to methionine or participates in the transsulfuration pathway whereby
  the sulfhydryl group is transferred to serine to form cysteine. Cysteine is a component
  of the tripeptide, glutathione, the key intracellular antioxidant. The one carbon
  metabolism requires folate, vitamin B12 (B12), and vitamin B6 (B6). Homocysteine
  can lead to protein modification, induce inflammation, endothelial damage, thrombosis
  etc. The formation of SAM from methionine (catalyzed by methionine adenosyl transferase)
  is sensitive to reactive oxygen injury (ROS) (-). Transsulfuration is regulated
  by change in redox state in addition to by hormones such as insulin and glucagon.
  Thus at the time of birth both transmethylation and transsulfuration can be effected
  by the rapid change in redox, by the increased generation of ROS and by the birth
  associated acute surges in several hormones.
