caption: In Silico Analysis of the L. hirsutum Leaf Glandular Trichome EST Databases.(A)
  Analysis of the enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. The frequencies
  of specific cDNAs encoding each enzyme (labeled A to F) and the ACP are in parentheses
  (number per 10,000 ESTs; the number to the left of the diagonal is for PI126449;
  the number to the right is for LA1777). A, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; B, malonyl-CoA:ACP
  transacylase; CI, β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I; CIII, β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III;
  D, β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; E, β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase; F, enoyl-ACP reductase.
  The total number of ESTs in accession PI126449 is ∼5500, and the total number of
  ESTs in accession LA1777 is ∼2500.(B) Analysis of the peroxisomal core enzymes of
  the β-oxidation of saturated fatty acids. The frequencies of ESTs (number per 10,000
  ESTs) encoding each enzyme (labeled A to C) are in parentheses (left number, PI126449;
  right number, LA1777). A, acyl-CoA oxidase; B, multifunctional protein, with BI-2-trans-enoyl-CoA
  hydratase and BII-l-β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase; C, β-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.
