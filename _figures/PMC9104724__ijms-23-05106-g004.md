caption: The calmodulin–calcineurin pathway and its impact on yeast growth in the
  presence of SDS stress. Partial inhibition of calcineurin (Cnb1 + Cna1/Cmp2) activity
  suppresses the SDS-hypersensitivity of vps13Δ cells. Multicopy suppressors MYO3-N
  and RCN2 act by titrating calmodulin or blocking the activity of Cmp2 catalytic
  subunit, respectively. Chemical suppressors EGTA and FK-506 act by chelating the
  calcium ions required for calmodulin and calcineurin activities or inhibiting total
  calcineurin activity, respectively. As full inhibition of calcineurin activity is
  toxic in the presence of SDS stress, both chemical suppressors must be used in moderate
  concentration, indicated by dashed lines. Figure is based on results presented in
  Soczewka et al. 2019 and Wardaszka et al. 2021 [,].
