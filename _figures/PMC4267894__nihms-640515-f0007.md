caption: Activation of HER2/ERK/MKP1 pathway in therapy-resistant breast cancer cells.
  We have previously reported that radiation therapy induces the expression of HER2
  and MKP1 via NF-κB-mediated gene promoter activation in breast cancer cells (, ,
  ). Here we identified that MKP1 mitochondrial relocation is enhanced by radiation
  to target mitochondrial pJNK. The dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK leads
  to the attenuation of the pro-apoptotic signals from JNK, resulting in the inhibition
  of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and radioresistant phenotype of breast cancer
  cells with HER2 status, including the HER2-positive breast cancer stem cells. The
  mitochondrial MKP1 is thus a potential target for therapy-resistant breast cancer
  cells, especially for recurrent/metastatic lesions with adaptive resistance to anti-HER2
  therapy.
