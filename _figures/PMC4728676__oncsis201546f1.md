caption: Molecular and cellular mode of action of energy disruptors. 2-Deoxyglucose
  inhibits glycolysis, it is phosphorylated by the hexokinase (HK) to produce 2-deoxglucose-6-phosphate
  (2-DG-6-P). Biguanides (metformin and phenformin) inhibit complex 1 of the electron
  transport chain (complexes 1 to 4 and the F0F1 ATP synthase). AICAR is converted
  in ZMP which activates the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). The glycolysis converts
  glucose in pyruvate via a sequence of enzymatic reactions. The lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH) catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into lactate. Pyruvate can be addressed
  to the mitochondria and converted into acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH), acetyl-CoA is then processed by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The TCA
  produces important intermediates but also cofactors (NADH and FADH2) required by
  the electron transport chain. The AMPK is phosphorylated by LKB1 or the CAMKK2 and
  activates TSC2 an inhibitor of mTORC1. It also inhibits and phosphorylates the acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that converts the acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA, an
  inhibitor the Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1). Akt is activated by growth
  factors and PTEN is a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Akt phosphorylates
  and inhibits TSC2. CAMKK2, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2;
  GSH, glutathione; PFK-1, phosphofructokinase-1; PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase;
  PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TRX, thioredoxin; TSC2, tuberous sclerosis 2.
