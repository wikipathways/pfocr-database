caption: PCP and SHH Signaling pathways. (a) Core planar cell polarity proteins asymmetrically
  distributed in two epithelial cells. Epithelial cells in contact with each other
  partition one group of proteins (FZD, DSH shown in blue) to the proximal side of
  the cell and another group (VANG, PK shown in orange) to the distal. FMI (shown
  in pink) forms a complex with FZD at the proximal surface of the membrane and VANG
  on the distal. Across cell junctions, FMI from one cell binds to FMI on the adjacent
  cell, which connects each cell within a sheet of epithelium. DSH and PK maintain
  asymmetry in a cell by functioning as inhibitors of each other. (b) In the absence
  of SHH, the pathway is in an “off” state in which PTCH (purple) inhibits SMO (green)
  at the cell membrane. SMO is then held captive on the membrane of vesicles (not
  depicted). This activates a complex of FUSED, SUFU, KIF7, and microtubules to process
  GLI into its transcriptional repressive form. The result is the repression of Hedgehog
  target genes. (c) In the “on” state, Sonic Hedgehog (pink) binds to PTCH, which
  relieves the repression on SMO. After SMO activation, GLI is left unprocessed and
  is able to enter the nucleus to stimulate Hedgehog target gene expression
