caption: Natural products targeting TGF‐β pathway in treatment of colorectal cancer.
  This schematic illustrates the involvement of TGF‐β signaling in colorectal cancer
  and the effects of various natural compounds on this pathway. Colorectal cancer
  cell lines included in the study are HCT‐116, HT‐29, HCT‐8, Caco‐2, HCT‐166, colorectal
  carcinoma RKO, and human fetal colon FHC. The canonical TGF‐β signaling pathway
  involves Smad2/3 phosphorylation, forming a complex with Smad4, which translocates
  to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Natural ingredients that inhibit TGF‐β
  signaling in colorectal cancer include oxyresveratrol (OxReV), ursolic acid (UrA),
  baicalin (BcA), and oxymatrine (OxMaT). These compounds contribute to the activation
  of EMT suppressor genes like E‐cadherin and inhibition of EMT trigger genes such
  as Snail and Zeb. Conversely, compounds like sulforaphane (SuF), tetrandrine (TetaD),
  and curcumin (Crc) induce TGF‐β signaling, influencing various cellular processes.
