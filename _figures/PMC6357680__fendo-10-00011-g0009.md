caption: Selected enriched KEGG pathways among DETs between S41 and S43 during tail
  resorption. (A) Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis pathway. Note that nearly all were downregulated
  between S41 and S43. A rectangle indicates a gene product (an enzyme). The down-regulated
  genes are shown in green. The light blue genes have no change in expression level.
  The numbers in the all boxes correspond to the enzyme commission numbers which are
  associated with a recommended name for the respective enzyme and clear circles indicate
  metabolic products. (B) Alzheimer's disease pathway. Note that all but one DETs
  were downregulated. The exception was CASP9, which is important for inducing cell
  death and not surprisingly upregulated. Green color indicates down-regulated DETs
  and red represents up-regulated DETs.
