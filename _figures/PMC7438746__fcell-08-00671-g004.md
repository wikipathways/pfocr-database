caption: Transcriptional regulation by mTORC1. (a) mTORC1 regulates fatty acid synthesis
  by enabling SREBP1 mediated transcription. Lipin 1 inhibits SREBPs from binding
  to their target genes. mTORC1 phosphorylates Lipin 1 and prevents its translocation
  to the nucleus. S6K1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 is required for cleavage and activation
  of SREBP1c through a yet unknown mechanism. (b) mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K1 and activates
  tripartite motif-containing protein-24 (TIF24) and promotes its interaction with
  Pol I. Phosphorylated S6K1 also promotes the interaction of upstream binding factor
  (UBF) with SL1 regulating rRNA expression. mTORC1 phosphorylates MAF 1 which is
  a repressor of Pol III thereby controlling the expression of 5srRNA and tRNA. (c)
  mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K2 which interacts with nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (nCoR1)
  promoting its translocation to the nucleus thereby inhibiting PPARα. (d) mTORC1
  phosphorylates TFEB in the surface of lysosomes promoting its binding to 14-3-3
  proteins inhibiting its transport into nucleus. (e) Nuclear mTORC1 interacts with
  YY1 which in turn modulates the transcriptional activity of PGC1α. (f) mTORC1 phosphorylates
  STAT5 and promotes SREBP1 transcriptional activity. (g) mTORC1 phosphorylates STAT3
  allowing transcription of STAT3 target genes. (h,i) mTORC1 regulates HIF1α and PPARƔ
  transcription through unknown mechanisms.
