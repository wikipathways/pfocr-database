caption: In uncompensated insulin resistance (upper panel), signalling via the PI3K
  pathway is diminished, glucose uptake by the cell via GLUT-4 transporters is reduced,
  suppression of gluconeogenesis is reduced and glucose levels rise. In compensated
  insulin resistance (lower panel), the pancreas responds to the rise in glucose levels
  with increased insulin secretion, insulin levels rise, signalling through the PI3K
  pathway is restored and cell glucose uptake and gluconeogenesis are normalized.
  However, the increased insulin concentrations increase signalling via the kinases
  of the MAPK pathway {p21Ras, Raf, MEK [MAPK/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase) kinase] and ERK} to increase cell proliferation and survival.
