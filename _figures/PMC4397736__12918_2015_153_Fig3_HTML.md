caption: Comparison between simulations and gene expression data. Comparison between
  selected simulated fluxes, using a combination of molecular weights and thermodynamic
  penalties, and associated gene expression. Plot axes are the same as the ones defined
  in the ptsG plot unless otherwise specified. Multiple genes associated with the
  same reaction are included in the same box. Reaction names are taken from the E.
  coli iJR904 reconstruction []. Yellow boxes indicate Pentose Phosphate Pathway,
  blue indicates glycolysis, green indicates TCA cycle and red indicates other reactions
