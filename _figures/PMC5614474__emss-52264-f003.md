caption: 'Transcriptional programs controlling endocytosis and genetic reprogramming
  by endocytosis. A: activation of HIF1α during hypoxia causes the inhibition of the
  RABAPTIN-5 gene transcription and, consequently, endosomal retention of the EGFR,
  eventually leading to sustained EGFR signaling from the endosomal station and tumor
  progression. B: lysosomal stress causes nuclear translocation of the TFEB transcription
  factor, which induces transcription of a cluster of genes involved in lysosomal
  biogenesis. C: upon different types of cellular stresses, p53 translocates into
  the nucleus and activates the transcription of genes which play roles at different
  stations of the endocytic pathway: DRAM1, a lysosomal membrane protein; TSAP6 and
  CHMP4C, which are involved in exosome release from MVBs; CAV-1, which stimulates
  caveolar endocytosis. D: at the MVB, the ESCRT complex is assembled (CHMP4 being
  one of its components), which is involved in the recognition of ubiquitinated cargoes,
  and in invagination and scission of intraluminal vesicles (see ). Subunits of the
  ESCRT-II complex can selectively bind to mRNAs. MVBs are also platforms for the
  assembly of the RISC complex, which directs the degradation or translational repression
  of target mRNAs. In particular, two components of the RISC are specifically enriched
  at this site, AGO and GW182. All these events participate in the regulation of exosome
  secretion, which in turn is a tool for genetic reprogramming of adjacent cells.
  E: TP53 mutations found in human cancers exert part of their oncogenic potential
  through the P63-dependent (transcriptional-dependent) stimulation of RCP-mediated
  recycling of integrin-EGFR complexes, leading to induced migration and metastasis.
  The molecular mechanism for this remains unclear.'
