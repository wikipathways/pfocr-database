caption: 'PD-related proteins and chaperones involved in proteostasis: Other well-characterized
  PD-related proteins, their cellular localization and functional pathways involved
  are depicted in this figure. These include leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2;
  PARK8), PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1; PARK6), Parkin (PARK2), DJ-1 (PARK7),
  glucocerebrosidase (GBA), Vps35, UCH-L1 and ATP13A2. A role for LRRK2 in vesicular
  trafficking, mitochondrial dynamics and lysosome-autophagy pathways has been reported
  []. Mutations in LRRK2 associated with PD and perturb functions related to above
  cellular pathways are identified. PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy has been extensively
  characterized, and mutations in these proteins are associated with PD. Parkin also
  induces protein degradation via UPS []. DJ-1 regulates mitochondrial function during
  oxidative stress and is also reported to localize to the nucleus [,]. Vps35 is a
  component of the retromer complex and has a role in endosomal trafficking and autophagy-mediated
  degradation []. GBA is an active lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of
  complex molecules and mutations in GBA are likely to accumulate toxic α-synuclein
  aggregates []. Another important protein is associated with lysosomal dysfunction,
  and therefore, cell viability is ATP13A2. Mutations in this protein are identified
  in PD patients []. Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is involved in the
  UPS pathway of proteostasis, and mutations in this protein leading to PD pathogenesis
  have been identified []. Several DNAJ proteins that belong to the Hsp40 family are
  studied for their role in PD. Mutations in one of these chaperones, DNAJC6, resulted
