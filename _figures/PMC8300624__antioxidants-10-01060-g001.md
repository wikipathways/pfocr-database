caption: ASK1 is redox-regulated by Prdx1 in the presence of H2O2. At basal H2O2 levels,
  reduced Trx1 binds ASK1 non-covalently at its TBD, shielding reactive cysteines
  (e.g., Cys250). At increasing H2O2 levels, H2O2 oxidizes Prdx1 and leads to the
  release of oxidized Trx1 from ASK1, exposing the reactive cysteines. Oxidized Prdx1
  then transfers oxidative equivalents to ASK1 (red arrows), wherein ASK1 performs
  a nucleophilic attack either on the intramolecular disulfide bond of Prdx2, or on
  the sulfenylated CysP, leading to the formation of ASK1 disulfide-linked multimers,
  which are required for its kinase activity. Activated ASK1 becomes autophosphorylated,
  and in turn phosphorylates MAPKK, activating the p38/JNK signaling pathway, which
  leads to the expression of regulatory genes related with apoptosis, cell cycle regulation,
  and inflammation. Oxidized Trx1 is reduced via TrxR/NADPH.
