caption: A model for INA (SA)-induced transcriptional reprogramming through genome-wide
  targeting of NPR1 and subsequent transcriptional cascades. Based on the targeting
  activities of NPR1 and HAC1 onto chromatin before and after INA treatment, NPR1
  targets might be classified into four groups. The first group of the NPR1 targets,
  which includes the majority of the NPR1 targets, might be pre-targeted by HAC1 in
  the basal state probably through transcription factor(s) binding to the G-box motif.
  INA (SA)-dependent NPR1 targeting to these HAC1 pre-targets causes an increase in
  H3Ac level and transcriptional activation. Increased expression of transcription
  factor (TF)-encoding genes, which constitute the largest subgroup within the first
  group, triggers transcriptional cascades and subsequent activation of thousands
  of defense genes. Genes involved in defense responses other than transcriptional
  regulation are also included in the first group. In the second group of the NPR1
  targets, the HAC-NPR1-TGA complex might be pre-targeted in the basal state, while
  NPR1 enrichment and H3Ac levels increase upon INA (SA) signaling. These NPR1 pre-targets,
  which mostly encode TFs, are rapidly and robustly induced upon INA (SA) signaling
  and allow for fast and extensive transcriptional cascades. In the third group of
  the NPR1 targets, which generally constitutes defense genes not encoding TFs, the
  HAC-NPR1-TGA complex might be targeted in an INA (SA)-dependent manner and causes
  transcriptional activation along with increased H3Ac levels. In the fourth group
  of the NPR1 targets, which is composed of genes not in the SA-triggered immunity
  pathway, NPR1 is targeted independently of HAC1 upon INA (SA) signaling and results
  in the transcriptional activation of subset of the target genes. In all cases, TGAs
  might target the majority of the NPR1 targets by binding to the TGA or G-box motifs
  independently of INA (SA) signaling.
