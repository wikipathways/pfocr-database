caption: A simplified overview of NK cell activation by the NKG2D pathway. NKG2D upon
  binding to its specific ligands, MICA/B or ULBPs, associates with adaptor protein
  DAP10, which is responsible for transducing intracellular activating signaling.
  NK cell activation depends on the co-engagement of specific activating receptors,
  such as NKG2D and 2B4, or NKG2D and DNAM-1. These co-engagements induce activation
  of SLP-76, resulting in Vav1-dependent activation of ERK. Once activated, ERK activates
  NF-κB or inhibits GSK-3β. NKG2D or DNAM-1 activates another signaling cascade through
  PI3K and AKT, resulting in GSK-3β inhibition and NF-κB activation. Activation of
  NF-κB leads to cytokine production and cytolysis of target cells by granzymes and
  perforins.
