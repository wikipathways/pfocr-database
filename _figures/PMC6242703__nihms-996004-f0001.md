caption: (A) The cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) pathway. Adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) produces cAMP from AMP, activating protein kinase A (PKA). CREB is
  phosphorylated (pCREB) by several kinases, one of which is PKA. Once phosphorylated,
  CREB translocates to the nucleus and binds to cAMP-responsive elements (CRE) in
  the DNA to activate transcription of genes involved in AUD such as Bdnf and Npy.
  One method to activate CREB is to use compounds that inhibit the phosphodiesterases
  (PDE) that hydrolyze cAMP, thus increasing cAMP levels and activating PKA. PDE inhibitors
  have shown efficacy in reducing alcohol consumption in animal models. (B) The peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. PPARs are activated by
  their endogenous ligands, fatty acids (FA), or by synthetic agonists such as the
  thiazolidinediones and fibrates. Upon ligand binding, PPARs translocate to the nucleus
  and interact with retinoid X receptor (RXR) at peroxisome proliferator response
  elements (PPRE) to regulate gene transcription. PPARs can also repress transcription
  by inhibiting the activity of other transcription factors. PPAR agonists have shown
  efficacy in reducing alcohol consumption in animal models. (C) The nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway. NF-κB exists as
  a dimer of different subunits and is complexed with an inhibitory molecule, inhibitor
  κB (IκB) in the cytosol. Activation of various receptors leads to activation of
  IκB kinase (IKKβ) and phosphorylation of IκB. This event targets IκB for degradation,
  releasing NF-κB for translocation to the nucleus to regulate gene expression at
  κB elements. Inhibitors of IKKβ have shown efficacy in reducing alcohol consumption
  in mice. (D) Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) pathway. GR is held in the cytosol by
  chaperone proteins. Once bound to its ligand, cortisol (in humans/nonhuman primates)
  or corticosterone (in rodents), GR translocates to the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid
  response elements (GRE) to regulate gene transcription. The GR antagonist mifepristone
  has shown efficacy in reducing alcohol consumption in rodents and humans.
