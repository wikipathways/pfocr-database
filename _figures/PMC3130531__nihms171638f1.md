caption: Drug combinations that would target the mTORC1 pathway with the concomitant
  inhibition of mTORC1-feedback loops. Detailed information about each compound can
  be found in the text. Components of the different signaling cascades are represented
  in closed boxes and the different families of inhibitors in open boxes.
