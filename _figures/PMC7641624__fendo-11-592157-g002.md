caption: The gut microbiome modulates the development of fatty liver. The gut microbiome
  increases absorption of monosaccharides from the diet, thereby promoting hepatic
  de novo lipogenesis (DNL) by increasing substrate availability. Upon consumption
  of a high fat diet, the gut microbiome increases the production of muricholic acid
  (MCA) in mice. MCA is a potent activator of intestinal farnesoid X-receptor (FXR),
  which, in turn, activates the ceramide synthesis pathway in intestinal epithelial
  cells (IECs). Upon reaching the liver, ceramide promotes the cleavage of Srebp-1c,
  and thus upregulation of the hepatic DNL program. Undigested carbohydrates and fructose
  are processed by the gut microbiome to generate acetate, a substrate for hepatic
  DNL. Lastly, secondary bile acids (BAs) generated by the gut microbiome activate
  the Takeda G protein-coupled receptor (TGR5) expressed in colonic L cells which,
  in turn, increases the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 inhibits
  the development of fatty liver both by driving down DNL, and by increasing fatty
  acid oxidation in hepatocytes (Activation, indicated in yellow; Inhibition, indicated
  in blue).
