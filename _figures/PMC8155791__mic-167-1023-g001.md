caption: Model of NspS-MbaA signalling pathway. (a) When NspS is bound by norspermidine,
  the PDE activity of MbaA is inhibited, leading to accumulation of c-di-GMP and increased
  biofilm formation. (b) Intermediate state of interaction in which NspS interacts
  with the periplasmic domain of MbaA to inhibit the PDE activity of MbaA, leading
  to intermediate levels of c-di-GMP and biofilm formation. (c) When NspS is bound
  by spermine (or spermidine), the inhibition of the PDE activity of MbaA is relieved,
  resulting in enhanced c-di-GMP degradation and low biofilm formation. Black triangles
  represent c-di-GMP and black circles represent 5’pGpG. Nspd and spm stand for norspermidine
  and spermine, respectively. The structure of norspermidine is shown in green and
  the structure of spermine is in blue. OM stands for outer membrane and IM for inner
  membrane.
