caption: Pathway related to pigment synthesis in the leaves of C. japonica and expression
  profile of DEGs. A Chl metabolism route and the expression trend of DEGs related
  to this pathway in different samples. B Expression profiles of DEGs related to the
  carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in different samples. C Photosynthesis pathway and
  the expression trend of DEGs related to this pathway in the leaves of H and M. The
  expression trend of DEGs in different samples indicated by a color change in square,
  and the color change from blue to yellow suggests an increase in expression level
  of genes
