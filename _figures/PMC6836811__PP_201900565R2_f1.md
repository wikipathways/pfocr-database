caption: 'Opiate biosynthetic pathway occurring in opium poppy beginning with two
  molecules of Tyr and ending with morphine. Initial portions of the pathway are shared
  with papaverine and noscapine biosynthetic routes (not shown), which bifurcate at
  (S)-coclaurine and (S)-reticuline, respectively. Enzyme catalysts are indicated
  above reaction arrows. Additional abbreviations: 4′OMT, 3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine
  4′-O-methyltransferase; 6OMT, norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase; CNMT, coclaurine
  N-methyltransferase; COR, codeinone reductase; NISO, neopinone isomerase; TyrAT,
  tyrosine aminotransferase; TYDC, tyrosine decarboxylase.'
