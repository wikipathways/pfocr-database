caption: Conceptual model developed in 2005 illustrating the changes seen in the P2X4R
  – BDNF-KCC2–Cl− pathway. The normal situation is shown in the top panel. Microglia
  maintain a surveillance mode and do not express P2X4 receptors. Dorsal horn neurons,
  shown enlarged on the right, express KCC2 and have normal chloride extrusion capacity,
  thus maintaining low intracellular chloride concentration. Consequently, GABA activation
  produces a net inward flux of chloride and therefore inhibition.Following peripheral
  nerve injury, microglia in the spinal dorsal horn adopt a P2X4R+ phenotype. Activation
  of these receptors causes release of BDNF which subsequently downregulates neuronal
  KCC2. Unable to extrude chloride, intracellular concentrations rise, impairing the
  inhibitory ability of the neuron.
