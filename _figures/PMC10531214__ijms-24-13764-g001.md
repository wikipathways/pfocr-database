caption: 'Schematic illustration of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Ligand binding
  to cytokine receptor leads to the formation of receptor dimerization (1). The dimerization
  induces the transphosphorylation of JAK as well as phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic
  tails of the receptors (2). STAT binds to the phosphorylated site of the receptor
  (3). Subsequently, JAK phosphorylates STAT recruited to the receptors (4). Phosphorylated
  STATs dissociate from the receptors and form a dimer (5). STAT dimers translocate
  into the nucleus and induce the transcription of target genes (6). There are three
  types of negative regulators of the JAK/STAT signaling: suppressors of cytokine
  signaling (SOCS), inhibiting the phosphorylation of the receptor by JAK; protein
  inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS), preventing the activity of STAT transcription
  factors; and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), removing phosphate groups from
  JAKs and STATs.'
