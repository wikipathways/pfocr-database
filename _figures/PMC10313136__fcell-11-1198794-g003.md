caption: Schematic diagram of the nucleotide synthesis pathway and the pathway related
  to ATP generation. Metabolites with significant changes in their levels in aging
  organs are indicated in red font (data from ). The rising trend is indicated by
  the red up arrow, and the decreasing trend is indicated by the green down arrow.
  The levels of IMP, GDP, and uracil were all relatively increased in aging organs,
  as well as ROS, while the levels of ATP, fatty acids, and phosphocreatine changed
  inversely.
