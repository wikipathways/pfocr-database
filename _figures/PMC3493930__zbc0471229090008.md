caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanisms by which AP-1 transcription factor regulates
  LY6K expression, which activates the ERK signaling pathway to mediate cell invasive
  motility and metastasis in human breast cancer cells. Both substituting SNP242 G
  for C (G→C), which creates the PAX3 binding sites and methylation at the CpG site
  are closely localized on AP-1 binding site and reduce AP-1 binding affinity by interfering
  with AP-1 binding, which decreases LY6K gene expression (dotted arrow).
