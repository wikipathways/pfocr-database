caption: Model. Gq activates NCA-1 in a linear pathway via the RhoGEF Trio and small
  G protein Rho. Gq activation of Trio and Rho is direct (solid arrow). Rho activation
  of the NCA-1 channel is likely to be indirect (dashed arrow). Go inhibits Gq via
  the RGS protein EAT-16 (). Thus, loss-of-function mutations in the channel pore-forming
  subunit NCA-1, its associated subunits UNC-79 and UNC-80, or the ER-localized NCA
  channel assembly factor NLF-1 suppress an activated Gq mutant, whereas a gain-of-function
  activating mutation in NCA-1 suppresses an activated Go mutant. Though the NCA-1
  channel has the greatest role in conveying Gq-Rho signals, channels composed of
  the NCA-2 pore-forming subunit are also probably regulated by Gq because elimination
  of both NCA-1 and NCA-2 is required to fully suppress activated Gq and activated
  Rho mutants. RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; RhoGEF, Rho guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor.
