caption: The auxin signaling pathway is modulated by apoplastic ROS. The binding of
  auxin to TIR1/AFB receptors leads to the degradation of AUX/IAA repressors via the
  26S proteasome, allowing the activation of ARF transcription factors and changes
  in gene expression. O3 treatment leads to the production of apoplastic ROS, which
  could suppress the auxin pathway by decreasing the expression of TIR1/AFBs independently
  of miR393 and SA. O3 may affect the stability of Aux/IAAs (e.g. IAA10 and IAA28),
  or ARF activity could be directly modulated independently of auxin F-box proteins.
  ARFs regulate auxin-dependent gene expression, which includes Aux/IAA transcripts.
  Decreased levels of Aux/IAA transcripts provide a feedback mechanism counteracting
  the increased Aux/IAA stability. In addition, apoplastic ROS modulated the expression
  of several genes involved in auxin signaling, polar transport, and biosynthesis.
  Chronic O3 exposure leads to SIMR, which is under negative regulation of the auxin
  signaling pathway.
