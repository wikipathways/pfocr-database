caption: 'Molecular mechanisms driving root system architecture (RSA). (A) RSA is
  the phenotypic result of the interaction of genetic and environment controls (G × E)—Abiotic

  by climate change, affect lateral auxin distribution via multiple molecular mechanisms,

  affects root branching in the elongation zone of the primary root (PR). Environmental
  condition, i.e. water stress and optimal water conditions affect SUMO proteases

  SUMO proteases, in turn allow the formation of the repressor complex (red circle)
  (IAA3‐SUMO‐ARF7), thereby blocking (red arrow) auxin‐responsive gene expression
  associated with LR initiation. On the right of Panel B (optimal water conditions),
  moisture inhibits (red arrow) the formation of the repressor complex (IAA3‐SUMO‐ARF7)
  affecting SUMO. Thus, ARF7 induced asymmetric expression of LBD16 in LRs. Light

  ARF7 and SUMO. (C) Gravitropic set‐point angle (GSA) is shaped by mechanism II—Green

  exocyst factor, EXO70A3, modulate the asymmetric auxin gradient between the lower
  and upper side of the root tip via PIN4 proteins. Gravity stimulus in columella
  cells sets the direction of the root bending according to the allelic variation
  of EXO70A3 determining the threshold of auxin flux. Thus, two models of extreme
  wild‐type phenotypes resulting in a deeper RSA profile (upper side) and in a shallower
  RSA profile (lower side) are proposed. Shallower RSA (in blue) is shared by haplogroup
  C and guarantees exploration of the soil more shallower layers and access to superficial

  and shoot auxin levels, in turn affecting bending of GSA of the LRs and inducing
  a shallower root profile (blue arrow). Auxin flux that affects GSA of the LRs is
  balanced by CK that act as anti‐gravitropic signal at opposing organ flanks. CK
  oxidase 2 (CKX2) affects CK pathway, its natural allelic variation shapes different
  degree of LRs bending. CKX2 mutants and wild type reflect two opposite phenotypes
  respectively showing a shallower and deeper LRs profile. Light green arrow: activation;
  red arrow: inhibition; black arrow: a consequence of a previous activation or inhibition'
