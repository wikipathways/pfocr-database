caption: Multiple roles for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) signaling
  in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology. In the central nervous system (CNS), TNF is
  primarily expressed by astrocytes, microglia and neurons and can stimulate its own
  release via TNFR1. A detrimental role for TNFR1 has been described in the pathology
  of MS. TNFR1 signaling triggers oligodendrocyte (OLG) death and contributes to primary
  demyelination via macrophages. Conversely, TNFR2 has protective effects in the CNS,
  as the interaction with tmTNF on astrocytes stimulates remyelination and neuronal
  TNFR2 protects against excitotoxicity. In the periphery, TNFR2 induces the development
  of effector T cells, but in the CNS, microglial-expressed TNFR2 is protective. TNF,
  possibly via TNFR2, mediates regression of activated myelin-specific T cells. Furthermore,
  TNFR2 signaling also facilitates the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and
  improves their suppressive capacities against effector T cells. Normal arrows indicate
  the action of a mediator or the processes that are induced; bold arrows represent
  mediators produced by a specific cellular subset. T bars represent the inhibition
  of the indicated pathway.
