caption: A schematic overview of the influence of the TME on TI-Treg proliferation
  and function through metabolic reprogramming. 1 The “Warburg effect” characterizes
  the TME as glucose-deficient and lactate-accumulative. The role of glycolysis in
  TI-Treg function is controversial, but it is clear that MCT1-induced lactate uptake
  is increased in Tregs. Lactate is not only converted to pyruvate by LDH to enter
  the TCA cycle, but is also used for the production of PEP, which serves as an intermediate
  for glycolysis. 2 FAO and FAS are both active in TI-Tregs. Since FFA availability
  is upregulated in the TME, the uptake of FA and subsequent FAO are increased with
  the support of FABPs and CD36. CD36-induced FFA uptake also activates PPAR-β signaling,
  which promotes mitochondrial fitness and increases the NAD-to-NADH ratio. The mevalonate
  pathway and FAS are supported by SCAP/SREBP signaling. 3 TI-Tregs show high OXPHO
  and ROS production, which can be scavenged by GSH. IDO is enriched in the TME, and
  the IDO-catalyzed tryptophan metabolite kynurenine curbs the infiltration of Teffs
  by binding to AHR, thus promoting the generation of Tregs by inducing tolerogenic
  dendritic cells. 4 The hypoxic TME activates the HIF-1α pathway, which promotes
  glycolysis. The activity of mTOR-HIF-1α is inhibited by TLR8. Until now, the correlation
  between HIF-1α and Foxp3 expression remains controversial. MCT1 monocarboxylate
  transporter 1, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, PEP phosphoenolpyruvate, FABP fatty acid-binding
  protein, SREBP sterol regulatory element-binding protein, SCAP SREBP cleavage-activating
  protein, IDO indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, AHR aryl hydrocarbon receptor, MDSC myeloid-derived
  suppressive cells, TAM tumor-associated fibroblasts
