caption: Glucose-inositol relationships. High glucose levels inhibit myo-Ins uptake
  by cells, by competing with SMT1/2 transporter systems. Moreover, through the activation
  of the polyol pathway, glucose extrudes myo-Ins from cells, thus “buffering” the
  increased osmolarity due to the augmented sorbitol levels. Biosynthesis of myo-Ins
  begins with G-6P enzymatic transformation into inositol-1-phosphate. However, high
  glucose levels indirectly inhibit myo-Ins biosynthesis, by increasing intracellular
  PA and consequently activating IP6K1, the principal negative regulator of myo-Ins
  de novo synthesis. Ultimately, glucose increases renal tubular catabolism and urinary
  loss of inositol through MIOX activation and overexpression. DAG, diacylglycerol;
  PKC, PKA, protein kinase C and A; G, glucose; G-6P, glucose-6-phosphate; Fru-6P,
