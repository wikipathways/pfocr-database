caption: Expression of MALAT1 is increased in response to inflammatory stimuli in
  CD11c+ cells of tolerized allograft cardiac tissue. LPS-induced transcription of
  MALAT1 was shown to be dependent on the p65- associated activation of the NF-κB
  pathway and to increase secretion of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. DC-SIGN
  (dendritic cell- specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin)
  was also shown to be controlled by MALAT1 and to act as a miR-155 sponge to maintain
  the tolerogenic ability of the tDCs (tolerogenic DCs).
