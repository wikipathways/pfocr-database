caption: 'Apoptosis inducers can either inhibit antiapoptotic proteins or stimulate
  proapoptotic proteins. Their main targets are Bcl-2 family members. In the former
  mechanism, several types of compounds downregulate the expression of prosurvival
  Bcl-2 proteins whereas BH3 mimetics inhibit their activity (via sequestration of
  Bax and Bak, the executioner molecules in the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization).
  In the latter mechanism, apoptosis inducers upregulate the expression of BH3-only
  proteins (the endogenous antagonistic ligands for prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, some
  of which are able to activate Bax and Bak directly). Inhibition of antiapoptotic
  factors and stimulation of proapoptotic proteins can also be achieved indirectly
  by some compounds including multi-targets apoptosis inducers, which are capable
  of interfering with various signaling pathways (e.g., NF-kB, PI3K/AKT, p53). Inhibition
  of other antiapoptotic proteins such as IAP (antagonizinz caspase activity) is not
  sufficient to trigger apoptosis but does amplify the effects of certain apoptosis
  inducers. Blue circles: proapoptotic factors; red circles: antiapoptotic molecules;
  green boxes: apoptotic inducers. NF-kB, nuclear factor-kappaB; PI3K, phosphoinositol-3
  kinase; SiRNA, small interfering RNA; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; HDAC, histone
  deacetylase; IL-21, interleukin-21; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein; Cyt c,
  cytochrome c; Smac, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases.'
