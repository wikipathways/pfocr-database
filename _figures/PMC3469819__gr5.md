caption: Model of the CDK9 Catalytic Cycle(A) Model of the CDK9 conformational states
  adopted during the catalytic cycle. The cyclin subunit is omitted from the scheme
  for clarity. (I) Apo CDK9 has a flexible C-terminal tail. ATP is the first substrate
  bound to CDK9. (II) Upon ATP binding, the CDK9 C-terminal tail adopts an ordered
  structure, partially covering the ATP binding site. (III) The Pol II CTD binds to
  the CDK9/ATP complex to form a ternary complex that is competent for phosphotransfer.
  (IV) After phosphorylation, the CTD substrate is released. (V) ADP is released and
  the kinase returns to its apo state with a flexible C-terminal tail.(B) Reaction
  scheme. k1 and k-1 refer to the rate constants for ternary complex formation, and
  k2 is the rate constant governed by phosphotransfer and product release.
