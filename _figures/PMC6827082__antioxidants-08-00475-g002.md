caption: 'Role of HO as master regulator of cell physiology. Highly active HO shifts
  the balance from heme mediated signaling towards HO product mediated signaling.
  Low activity results in an increased heme mediated signaling. Black arrows indicate
  direct processes associated with HO activity. Green arrows indicate elicited effects;
  red blocks indicate inhibitory actions of the indicated compounds. Interactions
  occurring in specialized cells, such as erythroid cells, or macrophages, are indicated
  by dotted lines. ยง, integrated stress response (ISR) pathway is activated via ATF4
  by heme deficiency, indicating that physiological heme levels repress ATF4 activation.
  Abbreviations: ATF4, Activating transcription factor 4; BKCa, conductance Ca2+-activated
  K+ channels; BV/BR, biliverdin/bilirubin; cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate,
  CO, carbon monoxide; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; DAMPs, danger associated molecular
  pattern; FLVCR, Feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor; FPN1, ferroportin 1;
  PPP, pentose phosphates pathway; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLR, Toll-like receptors.'
