caption: Theoretical model for IL-10 production and its pathogenic role during DENV
  infection. IL-10 is produced in T cells (TH2 and Treg) through an unknown mechanism
  and in Fcγ receptor-bearing cells directly through viral receptors and indirectly
  through an ADE-facilitated manner. The extrinsic ADE pathway occurs through Fcγ
  receptor-facilitated virus contact and entry following viral receptor-mediated endocytosis.
  An alternative intrinsic ADE pathway may trigger Fcγ receptor-mediated signaling
  to activate Syk/PKC/ERK-regulated IL-10 expression. However, the molecular mechanisms
  for IL-10 production remain unclear. Crosstalk between PKC/PKA/PKB-regulated GSK-3
  for the transcriptional regulation of IL-10 and the involvement of genetic factors
  are also summarized. IL-10-regulated SOCS3 expression may benefit DENV replication
  by facilitating IFN resistance.
