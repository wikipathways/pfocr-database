caption: '(a-b) A schematic figure of the possible cross talk between androgen and
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling for genital tubercle (GT) masculinization in mice. Activation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is necessary for GT masculinization. Dkk2
  (Dickkopf-related protein 2), encoding an extracellular antagonist of Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling, is regulated negatively by androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone)
  through the androgen receptor (AR). (a) Dkk2 is highly expressed in female GT mesenchyme.
  (b) In the male GT, Dkk2 is regulated negatively by AR, permitting the activation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. See Reference 9 for details. Abbreviations: ARE,
  androgen responsive element; DHT, dihydrotestosterone. (c-d) Epigenetic regulation
  of murine external genitalia masculinization. (c) Androgen-induced genes that are
  responsible for masculinization of the external genitalia are regulated by androgen
  receptor (AR). (d) Housekeeping transcription factor genes, such as Specificity
  protein 1 (SP1) and Activator protein 1 (AP1) are required as co-factors form modulating
  histone modifications to promote masculinization. Hence such genes are necessary
  to regulate the competency of the sexual differentiation of the GT. See Reference
  10 and 11 for details. Created with Biorender.com.'
