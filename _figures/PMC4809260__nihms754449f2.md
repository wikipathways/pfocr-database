caption: ROS activates inflammatory signaling via activation of redox sensitive transcription
  factors and signaling. The activation of different redox-sensitive transcription
  factors and the resultant biological response is correlated with the levels of ROS
  in the cells. Low sustained ROS level mainly induces the antioxidant and cellular
  detoxification program like the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)–NF-E2-related
  factor-2 (NRF2) regulatory pathway. An intermediary amount of ROS triggers inflammatory
  response through the activation of NF-κB, STATs and AP-1 transcription factors associated
  gene expression. Finally, high levels of oxidative stress trigger disruption of
  electron transfer by inducing mitochondrial pore formation, thereby resulting in
  apoptosis or necrosis. The effects of ROS on the cell are also partly mediated through
  activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). All these mechanism can
  induce multitude of downstream processes including inflammation, survival and apoptosis.
