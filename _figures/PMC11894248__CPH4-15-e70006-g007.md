caption: Scheme illustrating ON and OFF states of the canonical Hippo signaling pathway.
  The right panel of the scheme depicts evidence summarized in the text. Demonstrating
  in the basal homeostatic OFF state, there is relative suppression or restraint of
  phosphorylations in the Hippo pathway, which permits the nuclear transcriptional
  activator complex Yap (yes associated protein) and Taz (transcriptional coactivator
  with PDZ‐binding motif) to move from a cytoplasmic location into the nucleus, relieving
  transcriptional repression by TEAD (targeting transcriptional enhanced associate
  domains). As more fully discussed in the text and summarized in Figure 5, this transcriptional
  activation is important in the homeostasis of the physiologically stable state of
  the myocardium, adipose tissue, and pancreatic β‐cells, as indicated by the scroll
  at the right side of the scheme. Evidence indicates that in dysfunction in these
  tissues, there is a shift in the balance to the Hippo “ON” or unrestrained state,
  shown in the left panel, in which phosphorylated Yap is retained in the cytoplasm
  in a process that depends on a cascade of upstream phosphorylation signals. Activation
  of Mst1/2 (sterile 20‐like kinase 1 and 2) in combination with Sav (scaffolding
  protein Salvador) results in the activation of Lats1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1
  and 2) that, in combination with MOB1A and 1B (Mps one binder 1A and B) promote
  phosphorylation of Yap/Taz, preventing its entry into the nucleus. In a dominant
  ON state, there is suppression of nuclear signaling promoting dysfunction, as listed
  as indicated in Figure 5. As indicated in Figure 1, the cytoplasmic Yap may sequestrate
  in the cytoplasm or be removed by ubiquitin‐related mechanisms involving specific
  forms of 14‐3‐3 proteins

  description: Scheme illustrating ON and OFF states of the canonical Hippo signaling
    pathway. The right panel of the scheme depicts evidence summarized in the text.
    Demonstrating in the basal homeostatic OFF state, there is relative suppression
    or restraint of phosphorylations in the Hippo pathway, which permits the nuclear
    transcriptional activator complex Yap (yes associated protein) and Taz (transcriptional
    coactivator with PDZ‐binding motif) to move from a cytoplasmic location into the

    indicates that in dysfunction in these tissues, there is a shift in the balance
    to the Hippo “ON” or unrestrained state, shown in the left panel, in which phosphorylated
