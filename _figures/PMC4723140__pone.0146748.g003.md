caption: Enzymatic reactions are marked by arrows. Enzyme encoding genes in boxes
  are colored red or blue, respectively, to indicate up- or down-regulation in DUhTP
  compared to control DUC. Different colors in a box for the same gene indicate various
  probe sets with differing expression. Genes with up-regulated fold change >2 are
  colored in pale magenta.
