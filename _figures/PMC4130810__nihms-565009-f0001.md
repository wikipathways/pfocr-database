caption: The glycogen shunt involves passage of blood-borne glucose (Glc) through
  glycogen before the glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) is metabolized further via the
  glycolytic pathway to pyruvate (Pyr) or by the pentose phosphate shunt pathway (PPP).
  The PPP causes decarboxylation of carbon one of glucose and generates 2 NADPH per
  glucose for management of oxidative stress; the rest of the carbon re-enters the
  glycolytic pathway. Incorporation of label from blood-borne glucose into glycogen
  is low and mainly labels the outer tiers; the inner tiers are mainly unlabeled unless
  glycogen is depleted prior to labeling. Most of the label derived from glucose is
  recovered in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-derived amino acids, mainly glutamate.
  However, lactate (Lac) is generated in neurons or astrocytes or both, and some is
  released from brain under resting conditions. Most of the glucose phosphorylated
  by hexokinase (HK) in brain (i.e., total glucose consumed) is oxidized, and the
  ratio of the rate of glucose to oxygen utilization (CMRO2/CMRglc) is close to the
  theoretical maximum of 6; measured values are slightly lower than 6 due to lactate
  efflux and non-oxidative biosynthetic activity.
