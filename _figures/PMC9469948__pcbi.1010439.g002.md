caption: Direct and indirect regulatory effects of venetoclax (ABT-199) and tedizolid
  on the coupled pathway are shown in the left panel. ABT-199 binds to Bcl-2 to form
  a protein-drug complex [, ]. In addition, both ABT-199 and tedizolid perturb ISR-related
  and non-ISR pathways, ultimately exerting both positive and negative regulatory
  effects on c-Myc and Chop (ISR effector protein) expression levels [, ]. The coupled
  apoptosis-ISR pathway is shown in the right panel and depicts the regulatory effects
  of the transcription factors c-Myc and Chop on the Bcl-2 family proteins, including
  both the pro-survival and pro-apoptosis effects of c-Myc [, –, –], as well as the
  pro-apoptosis effects of Chop [, , , , –]. In addition, the interactions between
  the Bcl-2 family proteins [–] are shown, including the binding of anti-apoptosis
  proteins (Bcl-2, Mcl-1) with pro-apoptosis activator (Bim) and effector (Bax, Bak)
  proteins, as well as the binding of activator and effector proteins and the subsequent
  activation of the latter. The activated effector proteins cause Caspase-3 activation,
  which causes cleavage of the anti-apoptosis proteins and promotes apoptosis [, –,
  –]. The pro-apoptosis species are coloured green, anti-apoptosis species are red,
  neutral species are white, c-Myc is orange, and Chop is blue.
