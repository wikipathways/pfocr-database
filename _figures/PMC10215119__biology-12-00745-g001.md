caption: Mechanisms involved in the regulation of macrophage polarization by exosomal
  ncRNA in AS. Exosomes originating from a variety of cells or tissues can target
  macrophages by transmitting ncRNA and macrophages can polarize into different functional
  phenotypes. ECs secrete miR-92a-rich exosomes, which can promote macrophage to polarize
  toward the M1 type by targeting KLF4. With endothelial-specific overexpression of
  ET-1, the exosomal miR-33 directly targets NR4A. The exosomes isolated from VAT
  of obese mice can be absorbed by macrophages and promote the production of macrophage
  foam cells by down-regulating the cholesterol efflux mediated by ABCA1 and ABCG1.
  It can induce M1 phenotype change and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-6
  secretion in macrophages, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of NF-κB and
  a decreased cellular level of LXR-α. EVs derived from adipose tissue mesenchymal
  stem cells can decrease LPS-induced M1 expression by inhibiting JNK and NF-κB pathways,
  and increase M2 expression by activating the STAT3 pathway. MiR-let7 family is highly
  enriched in MSC exosomes, which promotes macrophage M2 polarization through HMGA2/NF-κB
  pathway and inhibits macrophage infiltration in plaques through IGF2BP1/PTEN pathway.
  MSCs exosomal miR-21a-5p can promote macrophage M2 polarization by targeting KLF6
  and suppress macrophage migration by inhibiting the ERK1/2 signaling pathway
