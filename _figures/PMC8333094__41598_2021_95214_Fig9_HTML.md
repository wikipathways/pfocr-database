caption: Summary of the effects of TCDD on fatty acid oxidation. Inhibition of β-oxidation
  in TCDD-induced hepatic steatosis involves the (i) repression of FA binding proteins,
  (ii) repression of FA activation, and (iii) induction of thioesterase activity.
  Acyl-CoA synthetase repression reduces activated FAs available for β-oxidation while
  the repression of binding proteins increases acyl-CoA susceptibility to hydrolysis
  by induced thioesterases. VLCFAs and LCFAs were partially metabolized in peroxisomal
  β-oxidation (green box) to medium-length chain FAs (MCFAs) due to peroxisomal specific
  thioesterase activity which deactivates acyl-CoAs. Peroxisomal CROT transports MCFAs
  out of peroxisomes to the mitochondria (orange box). MCFAs, such as octanoic acid,
  could also diffuse out of peroxisomes and into mitochondria where they undergo oxidation
  following activation by acyl-CoA synthetases. In the canonical pathway, acyl-CoAs
  are first oxidized by acyl-CoA dehydrogenases that were minimally affected by TCDD.
  Two enzymes catalyze the subsequent step of mitochondrial β-oxidation; HADHA (which
  prefers long chain acyl-CoAs) and ECHS1 which prefers short and medium chain acyl-CoAs.
  Peroxisomal and mitochondrial medium chain acyl-CoA species would accumulate, specifically
  octenoyl-CoA, due to substrate overload and inhibition of ECHS1 activity by accumulating
  octenoyl-CoA levels. Octenoyl-CoA accumulation also sequesters free CoASH inhibiting
  other CoASH-dependent reactions including the thiolytic cleavage of the ketoacyl-CoA
  into acetyl-CoA and an acyl-CoA that is 2 carbons shorter. Therefore, TCDD dose-dependently
  induced a futile cycle of FA activation and acyl-CoA hydrolysis leading to octenoyl-CoA
  accumulation that inhibits ECHS1 activity and depletes free coenzyme A required
  by enzymes in other pathways leading to the inhibition of β-oxidation and energy
  depletion. With β-oxidation impaired, accumulating FFAs undergo ω-oxidation leading
  to increases in DCAs. Proteins are denoted with an oval. Red arrows indicate induction
  and blue arrows indicate repression. Solid lines denote reactions while dashed lines
  denote substrate trafficking. The figure was created using Adobe Illustrator (v25.2).
