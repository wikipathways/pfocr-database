caption: Hypothetical model showing how alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) may affect staurosporine
  (STS)-induced apoptosis and autophagy in NSCLC cells. Intracellular entry of AAT
  occurs constitutively based on lipid raft independent pathways, namely clathrin-mediated,
  or lipid rafts-dependent, which include caveolae- and flotilin-dependent endocytosis.
  The AAT could be sequestered into clathrin-coated pits by binding to LRP1 (low-density
  lipoprotein receptor related protein 1) and SR-BI (scavenger receptor class b type
  I). Alternatively, AAT can associate with caveolin or flotilin 1/2-postive lipid
  rafts. All entry pathways might generate AAT-containing vesicles fusing with early
  endosomes and lysosomes from which—by unknown mechanisms - AAT escapes into the
  cytoplasm (green structure). There, AAT could affect cancer cell responses to cytotoxic
  drugs, like STS (staurosporine). STS activates autophagy by inhibiting mTOR (mammalian
  target of rapamycin), which allows Beclin-1/PI 3-kinase complex formation, increases
  LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, p62 degradation in autolysosomes and downregulation of Fli I
  (Flightless I), a controller of p62-LC3 interaction. Indeed, AAT seems to block
  different steps required for STS to induce autophagy. Potentially, AAT may also
  interfere with Atg5-Atg12 complex required for the formation of autophagosomes or
  recruitment of LC-3 to autophagosomes (green structures). As an inducer of apoptosis,
  STS acts through the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. STS causes
  the aggregation of Bax/Bak and the release of cytochrome c that binds to Apaf-1
  (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1) allowing apoptosome assembly and the recruitment
  of procaspase-9 to the apoptosome. In this scenario AAT might inhibit activation
  of procaspases-8, -9, -3 preventing Beclin-1/Atg5 degradation and activation of
  CAD (caspase-activated DNase). A crosstalk between STS-induced autophagy and apoptosis
  is in part mediated by p62 and beclin-1. Finding that AAT by itself strongly reduces
  p62 levels but prevents p62 reduction in STS-treated cells suggests that cancer
  cells utilize AAT to regulate apoptosis and autophagy dependent on the situation.
  Under basal conditions, AAT as a reducer of p62 protein levels (also important for
  the activation of procaspase-8), might activate autophagy as a cytoprotective pathway.
  In the setting when cancer cells face pro-apoptotic activation, autophagy inhibition
  may become a strategy to escape apoptosis.
