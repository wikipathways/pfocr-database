caption: (a) Illustrate the mechanism of the study. When OA occurs, synovial fibroblasts
  secrete the validation factor TNF-α into the articular cavity, which promotes the
  activation of TNF-α signaling pathway in chondrocytes and leads to an increased
  expression of RARγ downstream. The increased expression of RARγ in chondrocytes
  in turn assists the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway, thus forming a positive
  feedback loop that leads to downstream gene expression related to cartilage matrix
  degradation and inflammation, thus aggravating the development of OA.
