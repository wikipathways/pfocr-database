caption: (a) gcm> hopTum-l activates the Jak/Stat pathway exclusively in the hemocytes
  at embryonic stage. This leads to the production of the Upd2/Upd3 pro-inflammatory
  cytokines in those cells and to the activation of the Jak/Stat pathway in the larval
  muscles. This ultimately results in the formation of melanotic tumors and in lymph
  gland histolysis. When gcm> hopTum-l is combined with gcm KD (b), the levels of
  the inhibitors of the Jak/Stat pathway controlled by Gcm (i.e. Ptp61F, Socs36E and
  Socs44A) decrease in the embryonic hemocytes. This leads to a stronger activation
  of the Jak/Stat pathway in embryonic hemocytes, which enhances the production of
  Upd2/Upd3 and the activation of the Jak/Stat pathway in the muscles. As a consequence,
  gcm> hopTum-l, gcm KD animals display stronger phenotypes in terms of lymph gland
  histolysis and melanotic tumors.
