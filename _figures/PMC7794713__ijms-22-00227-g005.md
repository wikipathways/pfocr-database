caption: 'The mechanism of action of soy peptides in HepG2 cells, adapted from Lammi
  et al., 2015 []. Three distinct pathways lead to increased LDLR activity, which
  can bind and transport extracellular LDL into liver cells with final hypocholesterolemic
  effects. (1) Soy peptides, which enter the pathway that stabilizes mRNA levels contributing
  to the increased levels of LDLR protein in the plasma membrane and increased LDL-C
  uptake. (2) Soy peptides activate AMPK which, by phosphorylation inactivates the
  target substrate HMGCR, the key enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis. This step
  is associated with decreased intracellular level of cholesterol. (3) Decreased intracellular
  cholesterol levels activate the transcription factor SREBP-2 which, in turn, activates
  the transcription of genes LDLR and HMGCR resulting in increased levels of proteins
  LDLR and HMGCR, respectively. Abbreviations: AMPK, adenosine monophospate-activated
  protein kinase; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2;
  HMGCR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol;
  LDLR, low-density lipoprotein receptor; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinases
  1 and 2; SREBP, Sterol regulatory element-binding protein. (+), increased effect;
  (−), decreased effect.'
