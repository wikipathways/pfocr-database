caption: Proposed mechanism of LAB-mediated modulation of inflammatory responses in
  bovine mammary epithelial (BME) cells. Being Gram-positive bacteria, immunobiotic
  strains when pre-stimulated to BME cells were recognized by TLR2 and induced a downstream
  signaling cascade of NFkB transcription activation through adaptor protein MyD88,
  initiating the secretion of cytokine and chemokine profiles. The LPS derived from
  Escherichia coli, when used to challenge the immunobiotic-sensitized BME cells,
  was recognized by TLR4 and followed the same pathway for NFkB activation through
  MyD88, inducing inflammatory responses. Thus, having a strain-dependent variation,
  immunobiotic-mediated pre-activation of TLR2 might influence the subsequent TLR4-induced
  inflammation. L. acidophilus CRL2074 and L. rhamnosus CRL2084 showed the highest
  ability to differentially modulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and
  chemokines in LPS-challenged BME cells. In addition, several negative regulators
  of TLR signaling also influenced the resultant cytokine and chemokine profiles.
  The L. acidophilus CRL2074 pre-exposure was able to upregulate A20, SIGIRR, and
  Tollip expression, whereas L. rhamnosus CRL2084 only upregulated the expression
  of Tollip.
