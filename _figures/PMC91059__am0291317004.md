caption: Hypothetical pathway of MCL PHA biosynthesis of PHA polymerase- and ′thioesterase
  I-containing E. coli JMU193 grown on gluconate. Gluconate is degraded via the central
  carbohydrate metabolism (indicated by triple arrows), leading to acetyl-CoA. Via
  four conversions of the fatty acid synthesis pathway, acetyl-CoA is metabolized
  to acyl-ACP; acetyl-ACP, transferred from acyl-CoA, and malonyl-ACP are coupled
  to give 3-ketoacyl-ACP by the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (step 1). 3-ketoacyl-ACP is
  converted to (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-ACP by the β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (step 2). The
  β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase (step 3) yields 2-trans-enoyl-ACP, which is metabolized
  by enoyl-ACP reductase (step 4) to acyl-ACP. Acyl-ACP is hydrolyzed by the ′thioesterase
  I (step 5), resulting in the corresponding fatty acid, which is activated by acyl-CoA
  synthase (step 6) to the corresponding acyl-CoA. Acyl-CoA is degraded in the β-oxidation
  cycle, resulting in 2-trans-enoyl-CoA by the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (step 7) and
  yielding (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA by the action of the enoyl-CoA hydratase (step 8).
  Because of the fadB mutation of E. coli JMU193 (indicated by double sticks), these
  latter intermediates accumulate and can be transferred by either an isomerase (step
  9) or (R)-specific hydratase (step 10) into (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which is converted
  by the PHA polymerase (step 11) into PHA. Reactions enclosed in ellipsoids are carried
  out by genes which were introduced into E. coli JMU193 encoding the ′thioesterase
  I and PhaC1 and PhaC2 proteins. Question marks indicate uncertainties about the
  actual pathway according to data from Pseudomonas.
