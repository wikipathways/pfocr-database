caption: 'Key signaling pathways and related targeted inhibitors in the CSC niche.
  Notch pathway: After twice cleavages by ADAM10/TACE and γ-secretase, respectively,
  Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is finally released. NICD could translocate into
  the nucleus and interact with the transcription complex, promoting Notch target
  gene expression. Wnt pathway: When Wnt proteins bind to the Frizzled family receptors,
  dishevelled protein (DVL) is activated. DVL would inactivate the multiprotein destruction
  complex (including APC, Axin, and GSK-3β), which could lead β-catenin to degradation.
  With the DVL activation, β-catenin starts to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Part of
  β-catenin enters the nucleus to interact with TCF/LEF and CBP, promoting the expression
  of target genes. Hedgehog pathway: Binding PTCH with Hh would translocate smoothened
  (SMO) to the cell membrane and activate it. The activated SMO could easily bind
  to the COS2/GLI/SUFU complex, then GLI releases from the complex, referred to as
  GLIa. GLIa activates the transcription of downstream target genes'
