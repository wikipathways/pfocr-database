caption: Quantitative metabolomic profiling of key metabolites in the butanoate pathway
  in biofilm and planktonic P. aeruginosa grown under static conditions (PLST). The
  box plots (panel A) represent normalized metabolite quantities in biofilm (red)
  and PLST (green) cells. The boxes represent upper and lower quartiles, black circles
  represent independent metabolite quantity values of each sample, black bars within
  the boxes indicate median, yellow diamonds represent the mean value and whiskers
  extend to represent the overall range (minimum and maximum values) of metabolites
  quantities. An emphasized horizontal red line serves as a reference, marking the
  optimal cutoff between the two groups. Metabolite abundances were normalized to
  sample median and auto-scaled (mean-centered and divided by standard deviation for
  each metabolite). “FC” indicates fold change of each metabolite in biofilm compared
  to PLST cells. A metabolic pathway (panel B) illustrating the metabolites of butanoate
  metabolism branch that increased (depicted as green) or decreased (depicted as red)
  in biofilm cells compared to planktonic cells grown under static conditions
