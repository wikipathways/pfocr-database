caption: SLC34A2-Bmi1-ABCC5 signalling pathway hypothesis diagram. Studies have shown
  that SLC34A2 is located upstream of Bmi1, and ABCC5 is a direct transcription target
  of Bmi1. Bmi1 directly binds to and activates the human ABCC5 promoter and promotes
  ABCC5 transcription (Ge et al., 2016). Overexpression of ABCC5 promotes drug efflux
  and induces chemical drug resistance. However, this study has not yet explained
  the mechanism by which SLC34A2 regulates Bmi1. Some articles have pointed out that
  SLC34A2 regulates Bmi1 through the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway to promote the tumorigenic
  ability and self-renewal ability of LCSCs (Jiang et al., 2016). Therefore, we hypothesized
  that β-Catenin accumulates in the cell and enters the nucleus after SLC34A2 activates
  the Wnt pathway, and binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) to
  activate Bmi1 transcription under the combined action of multiple proteins
