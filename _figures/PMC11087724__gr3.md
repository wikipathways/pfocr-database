  Retrieved from https://app.biorender.com/biorender-templates). The mechanism of
  leptin action in chickens may differ from what is known in mammals. In SOCS3-mediated
  inhibition of leptin signaling, chicken SOCS3 probably does not interact with p-Tyr986
  in the intracellular domain of chicken LEPR, but directly binds to JAK2. In contrast
  to mammals, leptin is more likely to affect feeding behavior of chickens through
  the expression of the orexigenic neuropeptide NPY (but not AgRP), without affecting
  the expression of anorexigenic POMC. Note: The pattern of a chicken indicates differences
  in signaling pathway compared to mammals. LEPR = leptin receptor; JAK2 = Janus tyrosine
  kinase 2; STAT3 = signal transducer and transcription 3; SOCS3 = suppressor of cytokine
  signaling 3; NPY = neuropeptide Y'
