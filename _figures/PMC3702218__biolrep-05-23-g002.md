caption: The Gqpathway (blue arrows) proceeds as described in  but can also be activated
  by α1-adrenergic receptors (α1R) and less severe hypoxia than the Gspathway [].
  The Gspathway (green arrows) can be induced by the activation of adenosine type
  2A receptors (A2AR) or serotonin type 7 receptors (5-HT7R), which are coupled to
  Gs proteins. Gssignaling activates protein kinase A (PKA), which stimulates immature
  TrkB to modulate phospho-protein kinase B (pAkt). In other systems, this phosphorylates
  glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and increases sensitivity
  to pre-synaptic glutamate release. Recently, additional pathways (dashed arrows)
  have been described wherein vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)
  or erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) induce LTF via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
  and pAkt, and perhaps pERK. Potential effects of reactive oxygen species on Gs and
  Gqpathway interactions are not shown. Figure 2 is modified from [].
