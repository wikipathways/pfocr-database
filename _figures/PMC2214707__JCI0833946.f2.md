caption: The mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway (blue) is composed of dopamine cell
  bodies in the VTA that project to the NAc. The VTA also projects to parts of the
  PFC and the amygdala (AMY). Central CRF circuitry (yellow) consists of CRF-containing
  cell bodies located in the central nucleus of the amygdala, which projects to the
  BNST. CRF projections from the amygdala also innervate the VTA, thus completing
  the circuit. The hypothalamic CRF projections are directed to the pituitary gland
  (PIT) located outside the blood-brain barrier. CRF in the pituitary gland stimulates
  the endocrine output of the HPA axis (red) including the release of ACTH, which
  acts on the adrenal gland to stimulate the secretion of cortisol in humans and corticosterone
  in rodents. A negative feedback system allows for cortisol-mediated regulation of
  continuous CRF production in the HPA axis.
