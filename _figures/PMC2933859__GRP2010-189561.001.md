caption: 'Blood coagulation pathway and protein C anticoagulant pathway. Thrombin,
  bound to thrombomodulin (TM), activates protein C which binds to endothelial protein
  C receptor (EPCR). Activated protein C (APC) inactivates coagulation factor Va (Va)
  and factor VIIIa (VIIIa) in the presence of protein S (PS). PS circulates in free
  form and in complex with C4b-binding protein (C4BP) in plasma, and the free form
  of PS plays a role as a cofactor of APC. TF: Tissue factor, PL: Phospholipids.'
