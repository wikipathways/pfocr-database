caption: This figure illustrates the toxicity and management strategies associated
  with Wnt-directed therapies in cancer treatment. It highlights the Wnt signaling
  pathway, emphasizing key components such as Wnt ligands, Frizzled receptors, β-catenin,
  and TCF/LEF, which play crucial roles in cancer progression. Various Wnt-directed
  therapies are shown, including Wnt inhibitors, β-catenin inhibitors, tankyrase inhibitors,
  and monoclonal antibodies targeting Wnt receptors. The toxicity profile of these
  therapies is outlined, detailing both acute and chronic side effects, such as gastrointestinal
  issues, hematological toxicity, liver toxicity, and their impact on stem cell populations.
  Management strategies are categorized into pre-therapy, during therapy, and post-therapy
  phases
