caption: Cholesterol metabolism and key oncogenic pathways related to cancer development.
  (a) Cholesterol de novo biosynthesis. Starting from three molecules of acetyl-coenzyme
  A (CoA), cholesterol is synthesized in more than 20 enzymatic steps, whereas 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase (HMGCR) and squalene epoxidase (SQLE) act as rate-limiting enzymes. (b)
  Systematic diagram showing the cholesterol metabolism in relation to key oncogenic
  molecular pathways. Sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) regulates
  the transcriptional activity of cholesterol biosynthesis genes, low density lipoprotein
  receptor (LDLR)-mediated cholesterol influx, and Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)
  inflammasome-associated inflammation. Embedded in SREBP2 gene, microRNA (miRNA)-33
  can positively regulate SREBP2 expression. The over-activated cholesterol biosynthesis
  contributes to uncontrolled cell growth. Overexpressed proprotein-convertase-subtilisin-kexin
  type-9 (PCSK9) facilities the lysosomal degradation of LDLR, induces hypercholesterolemia,
  and eventually leads to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Excess cholesterol
  is exported via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) under liver
  X receptor (LXR) activation. However, in cancercells, ABCA1 is prohibited by the
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. The overall retention of intracellular cholesterol facilitates
  acyl-CoA:cholesteryl acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), converting cholesterol into cholesteryl
  esters, leading to the development of different types of cancer. ABCA1 can also
  be inhibited by miRNA-27 and miRNA-183. TP53-mediated SREBP2 activation increases
  the production of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP) in the mevalonate pathway, resulting in prenylation of small Ras family GTPases
  and their downstream effectors. An increased SQLE level under high nuclear SREBP2
  (nSREBP2) induction inhibits phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) activity and
  sequentially allows the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling cascade. Lastly, cholesterol or
  its oxidative derivatives activate Smoothened receptor (SMO) in the sonic hedgehog
  (SHH) pathway. The overall alterations in these pathways increase the proliferation
  rate and the migration and invasion capacities, allow cell survival, and induce
  tumor formation.
