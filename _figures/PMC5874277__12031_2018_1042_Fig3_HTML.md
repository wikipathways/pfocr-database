caption: Phospholipase D1 (PLD1)-mediated multiple signals contribute to promote neurogenesis
  of neural stem cells (NSCs). At least three different signals are involved in the
  regulation of neuronal differentiation of NSCs. Ca2+-dependent signaling (red arrows)
  is the most important among these signals. Increased intracellular Ca2+ induces
  hippocalcin (HPCA)-protein kinase Cα (PKCα) activation, which facilitates PKCα-dependent
  PLD1 activation. Phosphatidic acid (PA), a functional product of PLD1, affects the
  activation of SH2-domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1). SHP-1 inhibited
  the activation of STAT3 (Tyr 705) activation, thereby inhibiting astrocytic differentiation
  and promoting neuronal differentiation in NSCs. The second proposed model for pathway
  signaling is the PLD1-mediated Bcl-2 expression during neuronal differentiation
  of NSCs (blue arrows). The model suggests that Bcl-2 expression in neuronal differentiation
  of NSCs, including neurite outgrowth, depends on PLCγ/PKCα/PLD1/PA/AA/EP4/PGE2/PKA/p38MAPK/CREB/Bcl-2
  signaling. The final pathway is the binding of Cdc42 to PLD1, which increased PLD1
  activity during neuronal differentiation of NSCs (black arrows). PLD1 activation
  by Cdc42 increased neurite outgrowth, suggesting that PLD1 activity is required
  for neuronal differentiation in NSCs
