caption: 'Differential gene expression in the tibias of 10-week-old male Enpp1asj
  and WT mice analyzed by RNA sequencing, (a) Volcano plots to illustrate the differential
  gene expression in 10-week-old male Enpp1asj mice and WT siblings reveal the most
  upregulated transcript to be FGF23. (b) Transcriptome analysis of bone mineralization
  pathways disrupted by murine Enpp1 deficiency reveals suppression of Wnt due to
  increased expression of the Wnt inhibitors Wif1 in kidney and Sfrp1 in liver and
  decreased transcription of Wnt ligand Fzd8 in liver. Increased FGF23 in bone further
  inhibits bone mineralization through inhibition of trabecular bone (125) and suppression
  of Wnt (126). Abbreviations: ENPP1, ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase
  1; FGF23, fibroblast growth factor 23; WT, wild type. Figure adapted from Reference
  55.'
