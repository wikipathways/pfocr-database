caption: LOXL1 in NSCLC tumorigenicity. NSCLC cells secrete TGF-β that promotes integrin
  α11 expression in CAFs through the Smad signaling pathway. Integrin α11, in turn,
  induces LOXL1 expression in CAFs. Once secreted, LOXL1 cross-links collagen fibers
  that enhance integrin-mediated collagen matrix remodeling. As part of the remodeling,
  alignment of collagen fibers supports tumor growth and tumor progression.
