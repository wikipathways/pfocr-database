caption: The pathway of ecto-F1-ATPase-mediated holo-HDL endocytosis. (1) ApoA-I,
  found on the HDL molecule, binds to the beta-subunit of the ecto-F1-ATPase of a
  hepatocyte; (2) This binding activates ecto-F1-ATPase, causing it to increase the
  production of ADP from ATP; (3) With the extracellular concentration of ADP increased,
  P2Y13, a G protein-coupled receptor, is activated, phosphorylating the GDP molecule
  found on the alpha-subunit of the G Protein. This phosphorylation activates the
  G protein, releasing it from its beta and gamma subunits; (4) The G Protein then
  activates RhoA by phosphorylation, causing the G Protein to become inactive where
  it will return to join its beta and gamma subunits on the inner plasma membrane.
  Activated RhoA will then donate a phosphate group to ROCK1, activating the protein;
  (5) ROCK1 then drives the cytoskeletal modifications necessary for holo-HDL endocytosis
