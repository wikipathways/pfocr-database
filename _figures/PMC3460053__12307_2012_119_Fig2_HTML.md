caption: Mechanism of lymphatic metastasis and its inhibition. a. Tumor cells invade
  into the surrounding tissues and co-opt pre-existing lymphatic vessels. Two important
  events are required for lymphatic metastasis, which are lymphatic vessel sprouting
  and dilation of collecting vessel diameter. These events facilitates tumor invasion
  and spread via lymphatic vessels. Shown in panel a is a representative lymph node
  with metastatic tumor cells overexpressing luciferase, performed using the in vivo
  bioluminescence imaging system (Caliper Xenogen). b. Inhibition of lymphatic metastasis
  can be achieved by employing reagents such as soluble receptors against VEGFR-3
  and TIE-2 signaling pathways. In the case of VEGFR-3 blockade, tumor lymphangiogenesis,
  including lymphatic vessel sprouting and vessel dilation, is inhibited. This results
  in the efficient suppression of tumor cell entry into lymphatic vessels. Interestingly,
  suppression of TIE-2-mediated pathway could also efficiently block lymphatic metastasis,
  but do not have appreciable effects on tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis. The mechanism
  of TIE-2-mediated signaling in tumor metastasis is still to be investigated. Tu,
