caption: Therapeutic potential of BMSC-derived exosomes for PF and the potential molecular
  mechanisms. BMSCs in the PF microenvironment can contribute to myofibroblasts formation
  through self-differentiation and secrete exosomes to facilitate the EMT of type
  II alveolar epithelial cells to promote PF. In contrast, BMSCs from healthy individuals
  can migrate to damaged organs to promote their repair and secrete exosomes to inhibit
  the EMT of type II alveolar epithelial cells via the interplay between the Wnt and
  TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathways. Exosomal cargos such as miRNAs can inhibit β-catenin
  and axin activity. Axin can negatively regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
  inhibiting the phosphorylation of GSK3β and leading to the suppression of β-catenin
  degradation. β-Catenin can promote the transformation of type II alveolar epithelial
  cells into myofibroblasts via EMT. Finally, the downregulation of axin can inhibit
  the EMT of type II alveolar epithelial cells to inhibit PF. The self-differentiation
  of BMSCs may be mediated by miRNAs, caspase, TGF-β1, and Wnt signaling pathways.
