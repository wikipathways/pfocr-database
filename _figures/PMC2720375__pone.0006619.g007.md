caption: 'The main detoxification mechanism for caffeine is extrusion by efflux pumps
  Hba2 and Caf5, which basal expression levels are dependent on the transcription
  factor (TF) Pap1. Pap1 is not activated by caffeine, but it shuttles under basal
  conditions between the nucleus (in pale grey, dotted line) and the cytosol, and
  regulates the basal expression of about 50 genes . Caffeine interferes with cellular
  activities and induces a number of toxic effects (in grey ovals): cell wall damage,
  protein traffic and general fitness impairment, cell cycle arrest and DNA damage.
  Most of the genes we have isolated in our screen code for proteins which can combat
  each one of those deleterious effects of caffeine, and have been grouped accordingly.
  The Sty1 pathway is activated in response to caffeine through an unknown mechanism.
  Activated Sty1 is then essential to activate changes in gene expression through
  the transcription factor Atf1, and these changes may modulate the cellular adaptation
  to caffeine. Chromatin remodelers and regulation of mRNA homeostasis may help regulate
  gene induction in response to caffeine as well. Lastly, proteins such as Moe1 may
  be essential to wild-type tolerance to caffeine due to its role in the regulation
  of Atf1 protein basal levels.'
