caption: 'Assimilation of carbohydrates in H. boliviensis by (A) The starch and sucrose
  metabolism. Numbers and abbreviations for each metabolic step refer to the number
  of alleles and the cluster that the alleles formed with: P, Proteobacteria; B, bacteria;
  T, thermophilic archaea; HA, halophilic archaea; A, archaea (non halophilic and
  non thermophilic) and combinations of these groups of organisms; NC denotes that
  no cluster was formed between proteins of H. boliviensis and proteins belonging
  to the microorganisms used as reference. EC numbers for the enzymes in the metabolisms
  are pointed out as classified in the KEGG pathway database, and are listed in Additional
  file : Table S3 [].'
