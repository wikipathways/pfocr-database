caption: 'Extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway and involvement of E3
  and DUBs. (A) Intrinsic apoptosis. Triggered by stressors like DNA damage, ER stress,
  or growth factor deprivation, intrinsic apoptosis involves activation of BH-3-only
  proteins, which promote pro-apoptotic factors (e.g., p53, Bax, Bak). This causes
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release. Cytochrome
  c forms the apoptosome with Apaf1 and procaspase-9, leading to caspase-9 activation.
  Caspase-9 then activates effector caspases (caspase-3/7), executing apoptosis. (B)
  Extrinsic apoptosis. The extrinsic pathway begins with death receptor activation,
  recruiting FADD and TRADD to form the DISC. Procaspase-8 is activated at the DISC,
  regulated by c-FLIP. Activated caspase-8 then cleaves and activates effector caspases
  (caspase-3/7), driving apoptosis. E3 ligases, represented by green rectangles, ubiquitinate
  specific components in the pathway, while DUBs, depicted as orange rectangles, remove
  ubiquitin modifications to regulate signaling. DUB: Deubiquitinating enzyme; DISC:
  Death-inducing signaling complex; FADD: Fas-associated death domain'
