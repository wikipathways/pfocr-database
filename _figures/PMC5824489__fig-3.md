caption: Dynamic interaction network of sirtuins. A sirtuin interaction network was
  generated via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN) to highlight how sirtuins interact
  among themselves. Molecular interactions are denoted by arrows with solid lines
  showing robust correlation and dashed lines showing less frequent correlations.
  In addition to SIRTs 1–7, several other proteins have also appeared as mediators
  in the sirtuin network (indicated with uncolored background). Blunt-ended lines
  indicate protein/protein interactions and arrowed lines indicate that one is affecting
  the expression of other. The interactions among sirtuins are denoted with blue lines.
  The illustration shows that sirtuins closely interact with each other, either directly
  or through very few intermediaries. This network suggests that the network of ARS
  molecules may be impacted by more than one sirtuin, and that understanding the interplay
  between sirtuins is crucial to understand sirtuin-mediated redox homeostasis. AACS,
  acetyl-CoA synthetase.
