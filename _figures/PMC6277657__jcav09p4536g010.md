caption: 'Proposed pathway of antitumor effects of SDA in PCa cells. The antitumor
  effect of SDA seems to be mediated by several mechanisms that include: (1) inhibition
  of NF-κB and AR nuclear factors that promote PCa cell growth and inhibit apoptosis;
  (2) production of apoptosis initiator caspase 9 and subsequent activation of the
  effector caspase 3, which suggests apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial
  pathway; (3) inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or ABCB1 drug efflux transporter
  encoded by the MDR1 gene causing increased intracellular accumulation of DOC. The
  effect of SDA on P-gp is supported by our group''s previous study  that showed inhibition
  of P-gp in HEK293 cells that stably expressed P-gp.'
