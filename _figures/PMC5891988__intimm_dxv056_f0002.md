caption: The role of ILC3s in the context of cancer. ILC3s can promote tumorigenesis
  and influence tumor progression. In line with the multiple and context-dependent
  roles of ILC3s during the inflammatory process, ILC3s may exert pro- or anti-tumor
  properties in cancer. LTi-like ILC3s can promote formation of ectopic lymphoid-like
  structures in the tumor microenvironment that can drive a protective adaptive anti-tumor
  immune response. Delivery of the cytokine IL-12 can potentiate the anti-tumor functions
  of NCR + ILC3s by inducing adhesion molecule expression and subsequent leukocyte
  recruitment to the tumor microenvironment. Stimulation of ILC3s by IL-23 can promote
  tumorigenesis, implicating the IL-17 pathway. IL-22 production by ILC3s can prevent
  tumorigenesis during intestinal damage by promoting tissue repair; however, IL-22
  also exerts pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative properties that can promote tumor
  progression after tumor establishment.
