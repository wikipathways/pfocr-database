caption: Core C metabolic fluxes of a tomato plant at the vegetative growth stage
  predicted by VYTOP, with xylem fluxes constrained from experimental data. Each pathway
  flux was estimated based on a reaction flux value representative of the pathway
  (listed in ). OAA, oxaloacetate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate. Other abbreviations follow standard abbreviations for
  amino acids.
