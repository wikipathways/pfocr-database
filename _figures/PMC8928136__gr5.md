caption: A) DJ-1’s mechanisms involved in p53 pathway regulation. A) Schematic representation
  of the proteins, their connections, and the outcomes. (1) The DJ-1 C-terminal generated
  by caspase-6 proteolysis is able to repress p53 activity in a PI3K/Akt-dependent
  manner []. (2) Studies indicate that a proper sumoylation of DJ-1 is required for
  the nuclear localization of the protein and subsequent suppression of the p53 apoptotic
  pathway []. (3) In the nucleus, DJ-1 can bind to p53 and inhibit its transcriptional
  activity [,]. Consequently, the expression of p53-related targets, such as (4) the
  Bcl-2 associated X (Bax) apoptotic protein [,] and (5) the Erk1/2 inhibitor Dual
  Specificity Protein Phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) [] are suppressed, resulting in the inhibition
  of apoptosis. (6) Moreover, the interaction between DJ-1 and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1),
  enhances the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 towards p53 inactivation []. (7) Conversely,
  p53 has been shown to have a downregulatory effect on DJ-1 expression and mRNA levels,
  besides targeting the protein for an inhibitory phosphorylation reaction [,]. (8)
  Tumor suppressor p53 is also responsible for the increase of neurotoxic asparagine
  endopeptidase (AEP) activity. DJ-1 is able to suppress this p53-mediated activation
  of AEP by binding to its p53 binding site []. B) The influence of DJ-1 mutations
  and the importance of DJ-1 cysteine residues in the protein’s signaling regulation
  mechanisms.
