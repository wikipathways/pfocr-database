caption: The TGF-ß fibrotic pathway. TGF-ß1 is the most ubiquitous fibrotic cytokine,
  and it can act in several ways to induce ECM production. TGF-ß1 is activated when
  extracellular or membrane bound proteins including MMPs, plasmin, and integrins
  cleave the bound latency-associated protein. Activated-TGF-ß1 binds its heterodimeric
  receptor, initiating two Smad signaling cascades. In myofibroblasts, Smad3 along
  with input from the MKK4/Sapk pathway activates production of additional TGF-ß1
  and extracellular matrix components including collagen and fibronectin. In non-myofibroblasts,
  Smad2 and Smad4 ultimately control transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts, upregulating
  α-smooth muscle actin. Transdifferentiation also requires integrin signaling via
  focal adhesion kinase and the alternatively spliced ED-A fibronectin.
