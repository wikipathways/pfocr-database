caption: Signaling mechanisms in the SHR renal microcirculation. Renal sympathetic
  nerves release norepinephrine which stimulates α2-adrenoceptors (α2-ARs) in renal
  vascular smooth muscle cells, thus leading to dissociation of Gi and release of
  αi and βγ subunits. Angiotensin II engages type 1 angiotensin II receptors (AT1-Rs)
  which results in the release of αq from Gq. βγ subunits arising from Gi-coupled
  α2-ARs bind receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) and localize this scaffolding
  protein to the cell membrane. At the cell membrane, RACK1 also binds phospholipase
  C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC), and PLC binds αq. Together, these interactions
  result in an efficient signaling complex in which activation of PLC by αq is enhanced
  by the simultaneous binding of βγ subunits to PLC. Thus, PLC serves as a coincident
  detector, whereas RACK1 functions here to bring together the stimulating components
  of this coincident signaling mechanism. This coincident signaling mechanism is further
  amplified by the fact that RACK1 localizes PLC with PKC, thus facilitating the activation
  of PKC, which mediates contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition
  to βγ-mediated signaling, release of αi by α2-ARs inhibits the adenylate cyclase/cAMP
  pathway, which further increases contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells. Because
  of the increased pool of Gi-coupled α2-ARs, both the αi-mediated and βγ-mediated
  mechanisms are more engaged in the SHR renal microvasculature, thus leading to renal
  vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and hypertension. The model was tested using
  pressor levels of angiotensin II with renovascular responses (or in some experiments
  contractile responses to isolated preglomerular vascular smooth muscle cells) as
  the outcome measure and, therefore, applies to sympathetic regulation of renal vascular
  smooth muscle cells; however, we hypothesize that similar coincident signaling involving
  α2-ARs may occur in renal epithelial cells and may contribute directly to sodium
  retention and hypertension independent of renovascular changes.
