caption: One-carbon metabolism in the cytoplasm and nucleus. One-carbon metabolism
  is required for the synthesis of purines, dTMP, and methionine. Mitochondrial-derived
  formate can enter the cytoplasm and function as a one-carbon unit for folate metabolism
  through the activity of MTHFD1. At S-phase, the enzymes of the de novo dTMP synthesis
  pathway undergo SUMO-dependent translocation to the nucleus. DHF, dihydrofolate;
  DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; dTMP, thymidylate; MTHFD1, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase 1; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTR, methionine synthase;
  S, C, D, synthetase, cyclohydrolate, and dehydrogenase activities of MTHFD1, respectively;
  SHMT1, serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; THF,
  tetrahydrofolate; TYMS, thymidylate synthase.
