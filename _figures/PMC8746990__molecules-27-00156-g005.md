caption: 'Antitumor effects mediated by AEA on ER+ breast tumors. The sustained activation
  of the Raf-1/ERK pathway, as well as cell cycle arrest, reduces cell proliferation
  and survival. AEA is also able to inhibit aromatase function and decrease its protein
  levels, to downregulate ERα and upregulate ERβ, inducing apoptosis and decreasing
  cell viability. AC: adenylyl cyclase; CB1: cannabinoid receptor 1; ERα: estrogen
  receptor α; ERβ: estrogen receptor β; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase;
  NGF: nerve growth factor; Raf-1: proto-oncogene Raf-1.'
