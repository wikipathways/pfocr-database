caption: Mechanism by which MSCs regulate macrophage polarization in the context of
  SCI. MSCs can promote the polarization of macrophages at the site of SCI by secreting
  soluble proteins including IL-4, IL-13, PACAP, CCL2, CCL5, and ED-Siglec-9. IL-4
  can activate the JNK, JAK/STAT6, and PI3K signal pathways through IL-4R, and ultimately
  promote the expression of M2 related genes. In turn, IL-13 activates IL-10R, thereby
  participating in the process by acting on STAT6. In addition, CCL5 can induce high
  levels of IL-4 by acting on CCL5R, thereby promoting M2 polarization of macrophages.
  CCL2 can induce the expression of MCPIP through CCR2, thereby activating C/EBPβ,
  PPARγ, and inhibiting NF-κB to exert anti-inflammatory effects. ED-Siglec-9 also
  works synergistically with CCR2. Regarding PACAP, its mechanism of action is not
  yet clear. Furthermore, MSCs-exo can also play a similar role, by carrying MiR-216a-5p
  and lncRNAs Gm37494, which will inhibit TLR4/NF-κB and activate PI3K/AKT signaling
  pathway, and downregulate the expression of MiR-130b-3p and upregulate the expression
  of PPARγ, respectively, hence, inhibiting M1 and enhancing M2 marker expression.
  Lastly, MSCs can improve the inflammatory environment of the SCI site and relieve
  its manifestations. AKT, protein kinase B; CCL, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand; CCR,
