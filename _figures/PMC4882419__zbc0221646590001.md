caption: Scheme for a multiprotein complex involved in the TGF-β-JNK signaling pathway
  and neuronal migration. Scaffold proteins POSH and WDR62 organized a protein complex,
  including RAC1, TAK1, MKK4/7, and JNK2. This complex can be activated by TGF-β,
  leading to the activation of JNK2 and neuronal migration during brain development.
