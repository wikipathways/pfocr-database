caption: Here, we show that nicotine functions similarly to a growth factor. The binding
  of nicotine to the nAchRs on RASMCs can regulate cellular proliferation by activating
  the Akt pathway. Akt triggers a network that positively regulates cell cycle progression
  through G1/S by phosphorylating and inactivating GSK3β, resulting in increased Cyclin
  D1. Cyclin D1 translocates into the nucleus and forms a holoenzyme with CDK4/6 to
  phosphorylate RB protein, resulting in the release of E2F. The E2F remains bound
  to the proliferative gene promoters, thereby facilitating S-phase entry. Thus, the
  signaling pathways induced by nicotine in the proliferation of RASMCs resemble those
  involved in growth factor stimulation. (This figure is referred to http://pathwaymaps.com/maps/474_map.png)
