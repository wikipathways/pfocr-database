caption: Non-metabolizable sugar-phosphates including αMG (blue hexagons) and 2DG
  (purple hexagons) are internalized through the PtsG and ManXYZ PTS transporters,
  respectively. αMG-6-phosphate and 2DG-6-phosphate accumulate intracellularly. This
  condition creates an unknown stress signal (orange sun) that is recognized by the
  transcription factor SgrR, which then activates transcription of sgrST. SgrS binds
  Hfq and base pairs with ptsG and manXYZ mRNAs to negatively regulate their translation
  and promote their degradation via RNase E. Production of SgrT inhibits glucose transport
  via a separate pathway. The current hypothesis is that SgrT interacts with glucose-specific
  transport machinery (PtsG) and inhibits its activity. The two functions of SgrS
  promote recovery from stress by reducing the accumulation of growth-inhibitory phosphosugars.
