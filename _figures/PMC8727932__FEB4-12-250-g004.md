caption: Classical and novel pathways for ACh synthesis and the turnover of ACh in
  cholinergic neurons. (A) Classical pathway. The high‐affinity choline transporter
  (CHT1) located on the presynaptic terminal takes up choline. ChAT synthesizes ACh
  from choline and acetyl CoA. ACh is released into the extracellular space as a neurotransmitter.
  Released ACh is degraded into choline and acetate by cholinesterase (ChE) at the
  synaptic cleft. Choline is recycled by CHT1. (B) Novel pathway. The opening of cation
  channels coupled with P2X2 receptors located on presynaptic terminals induces the
  influx of choline. Choline is used as a substrate for ACh synthesis. The turnover
  of synthesized ACh follows the same scheme as that shown in the classical pathway.
