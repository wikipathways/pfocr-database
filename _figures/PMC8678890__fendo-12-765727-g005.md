caption: Schematic depicting the proposed model of FSHR monomer/oligomer-dependent
  modulation of cAMP signaling. (A) Higher physiological concentrations of FSH glycoforms
  (30 ng/ml), mediates the re-organization of FSHR oligomers into monomers at the
  plasma membrane, activating the Gαs-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway and resulting
  in high cre-responsive gene activation. (B) Lower physiological concentrations of
  FSH glycoforms (1 ng/ml). FSHR monomer-homomer populations remain quiescent or further
  associate to promote FSHR oligomerization. This results in lower levels of cAMP
  and cre-responsive gene activation. This may have implications on granulosa cell
  functions including steroidogenesis, granulosa cell proliferation, follicle recruitment
  and selection, and follicle survival. Dashed arrows indicate proteins in the cAMP
  pathway that were not investigated, but are concordant with published literature.
  FSH glycoforms are modelled, FSHR is represented by an alpha-fold model (blue) and
  structural depiction of adenylyl cyclase (green).
