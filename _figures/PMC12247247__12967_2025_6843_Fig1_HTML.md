caption: 'The Relationship Between Oxidative Stress and DNA Damage: DNA damage is
  often accompanied by increased oxidative stress. The accumulation of ROS can directly
  lead to DNA damage and trigger a series of cellular responses, including inflammation
  and apoptosis. This oxidative stress is a significant contributor to cellular aging.
  Promotion of Cellular Aging by Oxidative Stress: Under conditions of oxidative stress,
  chromatin fragments can be released into the cytoplasm. These released chromatin
  fragments are seen as a cellular response to damage and may further trigger inflammatory
  responses and cellular aging. Activation Mechanism of cGAS: Oxidative stress promotes
  the entry of free DNA into the cytoplasm, which in turn activates cGAS. cGAS can
  recognize double-stranded DNA in the cytoplasm, leading to the synthesis of cGAMP,
  which activates the downstream STING signaling pathway. This pathway plays a crucial
  role in regulating the immune response of cells to oxidative damage. Relationship
  Between ROS and Mitochondrial DNA. Increased levels of ROS can lead to changes in
  the intracellular environment, promoting mitochondrial damage and the release of
  mtDNA. cGAS can recognize mtDNA in the cytoplasm, and radiation-induced cellular
  damage is often closely associated with the generation of ROS. Interactions of the
  cGAS-STING Pathway with Cell Death Mechanisms: The activated cGAS-STING pathway
  interacts with mechanisms of cell death, including the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  This interaction leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1β
  and IL-18), which further exacerbate tissue damage'
