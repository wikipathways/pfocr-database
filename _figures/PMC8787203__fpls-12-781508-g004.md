caption: PTMs orchestrate the source-sink relationship. Integrating phosphorylation
  (red circles) and ubiquitination (purple ellipses) of specific enzymes and TFs is
  pivotal to controlling carbon fluxes throughout the plant. (A) SnRK1 integrates
  metabolic information to control carbon/nitrogen (C/N) balance in maize seeds. During
  the night, low sucrose availability in the endosperm activates SnRK1, which in turn
  phosphorylates the E3 ubiquitin ligase RFWD3 to trigger its ubiquitination and subsequent
  proteasomal degradation. Conversely, high sucrose availability during daytime inhibits
  SnRK1 and, consequently, stabilizes RFWD3. RFWD3 ubiquitinates the basic leucine
  zipper (bZIP) O2 transcription factor, promoting O2 interaction with importin1,
  the α-subunit of Importin-1, to enhance O2 nuclear localization and activate the
  expression of zein genes. The activation of zein genes enhances storage protein
  accumulation in maize seeds to balance their C/N status. (B) Phosphorylation of
  TTG1 by SK11/12 modulates TTG1 protein-protein interaction patterns, shifting seed
  metabolism between lipid biosynthesis and the production of mucilage pigments in
  the seed coat. (C) CIPK14 and CBL8 act synergistically to phosphorylate ATL31/CNI1,
  which in turn ubiquitinates 14-3-3s proteins. 14-3-3s degradation might destabilize
  SPSs, NR, and GAPDH, shifting C/N metabolism and possibly modulating growth according
  to C/N balance. This mechanism could also modulate carbon flow to biotic responses
  by adjusting callose deposition, a costly metabolic process, and a strong carbon
  sink. (D) The SUC2 sucrose transport activity is modulated by light intensity by
  the concerted action of UBC34 and WAKL8. While the E3 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
  UBC34 ubiquitinates and targets SUC2 for degradation under normal light, the phosphorylation
  of SUC2 by the wall-associated kinase WAKL8 enhances SUC2 activity in response to
  high light. SUC2 increased activity promotes sucrose transport from source to sink
  tissues to optimize growth under favorable conditions. This mechanism emphasizes
  how ubiquitination and phosphorylation integrate to adjust carbon homeostasis and
  source-sink relationships. Phosphorylation (P), ubiquitination (Ub). Connectors
  ending with arrows = activation; connectors ending with bars = repression. Solid
  connectors = demonstrated pathway; dashed connectors = hypothetic pathway. Green
  upward arrows = induction; red downward arrows = repression.
