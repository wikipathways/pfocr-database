caption: Potential mechanisms by which IFNα disrupts thyrocytes to trigger AITDs.
  Thyroid follicles are composed of a monolayer of polarized thyroid follicular cells
  with the apical surface facing the interior of the follicle containing the colloid
  and the basolateral surface facing the blood vessels. TG is stored in the colloid;
  upon TSH stimulation of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, TG is endocytosed
  and processed in lysosomes to release T3 and T4 into the blood. In response to infection,
  plasmocytoid dendritic cells and other cells produce locally IFNα, which binds to
  its receptor and activates the JAK/STAT pathway (this would also happen in individuals
  receiving therapeutic IFNα). The activation of the JAK/STAT pathway results in the
  stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines, increased expression of HLA class I on
  thyrocytes, and activation of cytotoxic T cells. In addition, IFNα also triggers
  TG mRNA upregulation as well as ER stress and autophagic proteolysis, leading to
  processing of TG by lysosomal hydrolases into immunogenic peptides. Induction of
  ER stress and autophagy stimulates intrathyroidal expression of IFNα and its target
  genes, initiating a vicious cycle of stressed thyrocytes that provoke an autoimmune
  attack. In genetically susceptible individuals (e.g., individuals carrying the TG
  SNP (−1623A→G), these peptides generated from TG will be presented to T cells and
  activate self-reactive T cells, triggering thyroid autoimmunity. CXCL10, C-X-C motif
