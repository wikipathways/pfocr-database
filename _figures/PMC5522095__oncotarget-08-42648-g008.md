caption: During AD, the formation of Aβ deposits not only stimulates the activation
  and aggregation of microglia and astrocytes, but also triggers the neuronal injury
  and synaptic damage, which induces a progressive neuritic dystrophy. This dystrophy
  of the neurons results in the over-production of Chromogranin A (CGA), which is
  released by exocytosis of secretory granules. CGA potentiates the microglial activation
  and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) by binding
  to class A scavenger receptor (SRA) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The astrocytes
  surrounding the Aβ deposits sense the TNF-α and IL-1β by TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)
  and IL1 type I receptor (IL1RI), respectively, which leads to prolonged activation
  leading to neuroinflammatory responses through the released inflammatory factors.
  In turn, these pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the further neuritic dystrophy.
  NLD significantly suppressed the vicious inflammatory response in the hippocampus
  after intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ by protecting neurons against synaptic
  damage, reducing the production of CGA, and suppressing the activation and aggregation
  of microglia and the astrocytes. NLD also inhibits activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway and the ASC-dependent inflammasome (including NLRP3 in microglia, IPAF in
  astrocytes and NLRP1 in neurons) and associated caspase-1/IL-1β axis by lowering
  levels of pIκBα, nuclear p65, ASC and caspase 1 p20 following Aβ-infusion, resulting
  in reduced production of pro-inflammatory factors and thereby exerting anti-inflammatory
  effects.
