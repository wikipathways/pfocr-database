caption: Non-homologous end joining repair mediates the repair of DNA double-strand
  breaks. DNA double-strand breaks can be repaired via c-NHEJ (left), A-NHEJ (middle),
  and single-strand annealing (SSA) (right). 53BP1 is a positive regulator of c-NHEJ,
  and the process usually requires 4-bp microhomology. A-NHEJ, also called microhomology-mediated
  end joining, requires 2–20 bp microhomology for break repair. PARP1 and Pol θ are
  important for A-NHEJ. Higher levels of resection can further promote SSA repair
  pathway, which requires >25 bp microhomology. BLM and EXO1 account for additional
  resections in SSA. Replication protein A binds and stabilizes ssDNA and promotes
  SSA. RAD52-mediated annealing of a homologous sequence is important for SSA. ERCC1/XPF
  cuts the remaining 3′ nonhomologous ssDNA prior to ligation by DNA LIG1.
