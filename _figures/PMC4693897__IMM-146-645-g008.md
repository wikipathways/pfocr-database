caption: A proposed mechanism for zinc‐mediated inhibition of interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β)
  signalling and its role for repression of human T helper type 17 (Th17) responses.
  A schematic figure depicts the effect of IL‐1β derived from activated monocytes
  on Th17 responses in humans. Upon Toll‐like receptor (TLR) stimulation, monocytes
  significantly enhance production of IL‐1β, which can bind to functional IL‐1 receptor
  type I (IL‐1RI) on CD4 T cells, followed by a recruitment of IL‐1 receptor accessory
  protein (IL1RAcP) to form a signalling complex. Activated IL‐1RI initiates the binding
  of intracellular adaptor protein, MyD88, to conserved cytosolic regions of the receptor
  and leads to the recruitment of interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated kinase 4 (IRAK4).
  Subsequently, another adaptor molecule, tumour‐necrosis‐factor‐receptor‐associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6), is activated to form a complex with transforming growth factor
  beta‐activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and in turn activates nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) and
  mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK). NF‐кB pathway is known to be critical for
  induction of IL‐17 gene expression. Neither production of IL‐1β by activated monocytes
  nor the expression of its receptor on CD4+ T cells is altered by zinc treatment.
  Rather, increased cytoplasmic zinc in T cells suppresses IL‐1β signalling by repression
  of phosphorylation of IRAK4, so leading to an inhibitory effect on Th17 responses
  promoted by monocyte‐derived IL‐1β in humans.
