caption: A model showing the overlapping functions of MMR and FA proteins in ICL and
  MMR. MSH2 is likely involved in the detection of ICLs and early signaling events
  leading to the monoubiquitylation and chromatin loading of FANCD2 and FANCI, such
  as recruitment of ATR. MLH1 may play a role in ICL repair downstream of FANCD2 and
  FANCI monoubiquitylation, dependent on its interaction with both FANCD2 and FANCJ.
  Conversely, FANCA and FANCD2, along with other members of the FA pathway, may be
  required for efficient binding between MSH2 and MLH1. This role in the MSH2–MLH1
  interaction renders all FA cell lines tested defective in MMR.
