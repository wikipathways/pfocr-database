caption: 'Crosstalk between ferroptosis and classic signaling pathways. (A) AMPK‐ACC‐PUFA
  pathway. EMP, PPP and TCA cycles all require glucose as a substrate. When glucose
  is lacking, insufficient intracellular energy metabolism will activate AMPK, reducing
  the synthesis of PUFA by inhibiting ACC. (B) HCAR/MCT1‐SREBP1‐SCD1 pathway. Lactate
  enhances cell lipid synthesis by inhibiting glycolysis. Lactate induces the expression
  of HCAR1, MCT1 and inhibiting ferroptosis by directly inhibit ACSL4. Moreover, lactate
  promotes the phosphorylation of AMPK, which inhibits the ability of SREBP1 to promote
  SCD1, which directly inhibit ferroptosis by promoting the production of CQ10 and
  MUFA. (C) MTORC1‐Keap1‐NRF2 pathway. PI3K‐AKT‐mTORC1 signaling pathway activation
  will upregulate SREBP1 and SCD1, promoting MUFA production to resist ferroptosis.
  In addition to degrading SLC7A11, mTORC1 also promotes the accumulation of NRF2
  by phosphorylation of p62, and indirectly regulates NRF2 target genes. mTORC2 directly
  regulates the phosphorylation of SLC7A11. (D) Cadherin‐NE2‐Hippo‐YAP pathway. At
  high cell density, ECAD will send a signal to the Hippo signaling pathway through
  NF2, inhibiting the ferroptosis process by promoting the phosphorylation of YAP
  and TZA. The green box indicates inhibition of ferroptosis, and the red box indicates
  the inducer of ferroptosis. Abbreviations: HCAR1, lactate receptor; MCT1, lactate
