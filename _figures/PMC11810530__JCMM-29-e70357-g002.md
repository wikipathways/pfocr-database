caption: IHD‐mediated pyroptosis occurs through canonical, noncanonical and alternative
  pathways. In the case of canonical pyroptosis, during IHD, several DAMPs bind to
  their respective PRRs, leading to the activation of NF‐κB/NLRP3/caspase 1/GSDMD‐mediated
  pyroptosis. The presence of mtROS and mtDNA produced by damaged and dysfunctional
  mitochondria facilitates the assembly of the inflammasome and subsequent activation
  of caspase 1, leading to canonical pyroptosis. In noncanonical pyroptosis, procaspases
  4, 5 and 11 are activated through the escalation of ROS during I/R or H/R. This
  activation subsequently leads to the cleavage of GSDMD, thereby mediating noncanonical
  pyroptosis. The alternative pathway of pyroptosis is triggered by the binding and
  activation of TNFR1 with TNF‐α, which in turn activates caspase 3. The proteolytic
  actions of cleaved caspase 3 not only induced apoptosis but also initiated GSDME‐mediated
  pyroptosis. However, in association with the pathogenesis of IHDs, only canonical
  and noncanonical pyroptosis pathways were observed, with no evidence of alternative
  pyroptosis. DAMPs, damage‐associated molecular patterns; GSDMD, gasdermin D; GSDMD‐NT,
