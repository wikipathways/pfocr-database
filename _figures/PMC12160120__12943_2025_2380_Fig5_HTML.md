caption: 'The cGAS-STING interaction network with other immune cells and its regulatory
  role in tumor immunity. In NK cells, activation of the cGAS-STING pathway (such
  as via eEF2K inhibition-induced DNA damage) drives the secretion of chemokines such
  as IL-2 and CXCL9, enhancing NK cell recruitment to tumors and cytotoxic activity.
  Intrinsic STING signaling in NK cells further suppresses tumor metastasis through
  autonomous IFN-γ production and synergistic cooperation with CD8+ T cells. For MDSCs,
  STING activation disrupts their differentiation and immunosuppressive functions
  by suppressing STAT3 signaling (such as via reduced IL-6/GM-CSF production). B cells
  exhibit dual regulation: The STING agonist cGAMP induces apoptosis of malignant
  B cells and activates T cell responses. However, excessive STING activation may
  trigger Breg amplification and inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity via IL-35'
