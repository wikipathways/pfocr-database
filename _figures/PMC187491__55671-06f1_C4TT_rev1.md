caption: The Cryptococcus neoformans life cycle. There are three developmental pathways
  for C. neoformans cells. The first pathway, known as mating (A), begins when two
  haploid cells of opposite mating types fuse at 25°C. The haploid cells fuse and
  grow as filaments with distinct nuclei (dikaryons) and special clamp cells that
  are fused to the filaments. In response to unknown signals, the dikaryon produces
  a specialized sporulation structure known as a basidium. It is in the basidium that
  nuclear fusion and meiosis take place. Many rounds of duplication and mitosis lead
  to the production of haploid a and α spore products that extend in long chains from
  the basidial head. The second developmental pathway, known as diploid filamentation
  (B), occurs when cells of opposite mating types fuse and are maintained at 37°C.
  In this case, the haploid cells and their nuclei fuse to create a yeast-form, diploid
  cell that grows as a yeast at 37°C. In response to a decrease in temperature (25°C),
  this a/α diploid differentiates to form monokaryotic filaments with unfused clamp
  cells, basidia, and haploid a and α spores that are indistinguishable from those
  produced during mating. The third possible fate occurs in cells of the α mating
  type. This pathway is known as haploid fruiting (C) and occurs when α cells are
  grown under nutrient-limited, desiccating conditions. In this pathway, haploid α
  cells form monokaryotic filaments with unfused clamp cells, basidia, and haploid
  α spores. In each case, the resulting spores are competent to germinate and grow
  as vegetative haploid cells or initiate one of the three developmental pathways
  (A–C).
