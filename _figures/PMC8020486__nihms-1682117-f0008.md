caption: Schematic model of molecular mechanisms involved in apigenin-induced sensitization
  to doxorubicin in human TNBC spheroids. Apigenin sensitizes TNBC spheroids to doxorubicin
  treatment by inducing double stranded DNA breaks and triggering the caspase-9-mediated
  intrinsic apoptotic pathway leading to caspase-3 activation, without impacting caspase-8
  activity. Thus, apigenin through hnRNPA2 sensitizes TNBC spheroids to doxorubicin-induced
  apoptosis. In addition, through hnRNPA2 dependent and independent mechanisms apigenin
  downregulates the expression of ABC efflux transporters, which may lead to increased
  doxorubicin accumulation.

  spheroids to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and regulates expression of ABCC4 and
  ABCG2 drug efflux transporters.
