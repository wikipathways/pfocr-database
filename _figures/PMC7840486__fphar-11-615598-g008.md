caption: A diagram showing the proposed mechanisms of TQ resists MPTP or MPP+-induced
  oxidative stress via Nrf2/ARE pathway. TQ could inhibit MPP+-induced intracellular
  ROS formation, and inhibit MPP+-induced apoptosis via affecting the caspase signaling.
  TQ maybe stimulate the activation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 for binding
  to ARE, leading to induction of HO-1, NQO1 and GST expression, thereby protecting
  against MPP+ or MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. Arrow indicates stimulation and bar
  indicates inhibition.
