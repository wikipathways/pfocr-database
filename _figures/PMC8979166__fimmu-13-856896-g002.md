caption: Schematic summary of the pathways used by P. salmonis to enter to the cell
  and the immune responses modulated. This information was consolidated with results
  descrbed in different in vitro and in vivo transcriptomic and proteomic studies.
  Phagocytosis, key in the life cycle of P. salmonis, is also its primary mode of
  pathogenesis. The interaction of P. salmonis with host cells has been described
  by different transcriptomic and proteomic studies in vitro and in vivo (–, , , ,
  , –). P. salmonis infection consists of an early or vacuolization stage and a late
  or spreading stage. (1) Several studies have reported that the main route of entry
  of the bacterium into the fish is through the gills and skin and, to a much lesser
  extent, the oral route. (2) P. salmonis is internalized by clathrin-dependent endocytosis
  into phagocytic cells. Pilus proteins, beta-hemolysin, and the T6SS are a characteristic
  finding of the vacuolization stage. The transport of carbohydrates, amino acids,
  peptides, iron, and other nutrients is increased inside the PCVs. (3) Once inside,
  a major reorganization of the cytoskeleton occurs by altering actin filaments, tubulins,
  myosins, and septins, and P. salmonis simultaneously promotes an inactive GTPase
  state. P. salmonis induces a significant inhibition of the antioxidant response
  that would promote the generation of an oxidative niche. Overall, P. salmonis alters
  cytoskeletal remodeling, intracellular transport, organelle organization, vesicle
  and endosome trafficking and early endosomal components. The antigen recognition
  (LPS, flagellin, etc.) is conducted by macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) PRRs,
  such as TLR5, DC-SIGN or CD209, C-type lectin (CD299, Mincle), and NLR. DCs play
  an important role in the response to P. salmonis by modulating NF-kB activation,
  pathogen recognition, phagocytosis and the production of cytokines and chemokines
  led by the IFN-mediated response that promotes Th1 polarization of T cells. At the
  same time, to enhance its survival in infected cells, P. salmonis upregulates IL-10
  but downregulates IL-12, which promotes Th1 polarization. P. salmonis induces flagellin-dependent
  activation of TLR5, resulting in TNFα, IL-1β and IL-8 production. P. salmonis promotes
  the expression of antimicrobial peptides, such as hepcidin and cathelicidin, and
  acute-phase components such as haptoglobin, hemoglobin, collectrins, mannose-bound
  protein C, complement components (C3, C6, C9) and CD163. All these findings confirm
  that P. salmonis creates a specific environment that promotes their survival and
  replication in macrophages. During the propagation stage, the size and number of
  P. salmonis cells and vesicles increase, and nutrient availability is restricted,
  initiating a stringent response. Biosynthetic processes are increased in both P.
  salmonis and host cells, as are iron acquisition, iron transporter proteins and
  acute-phase responses. Expression of Dot/Icm T4SS genes, toxins, effector proteins,
  mobilome, transposons, and phage-related proteins is increased, probably in preparation
  for exiting the cell. Many virulence factors upregulated in both infection stages
  correspond to plasmid-encoded proteins, which supports the hypothesis of the importance
  of P. salmonis plasmids in the infective process. P. salmonis modulates the immune
  response to intracellular pathogens by promoting cell cycle proliferation and suppressing
  apoptosis and by altering vesicle trafficking and paracellular permeability. P.
  salmonis alters peroxisome activity as part of its infection strategy, thereby inducing
  an altered cellular redox balance, inflammation, and immune response. Moreover,
  P. salmonis reduces the rate of protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome
  system related to the response to cellular and endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated
  unfolded proteins as a mechanism to increase its survival within host cells. (4)
  Processing and presentation of antigens. T cells recognize only antigen fragments
  that are bound to MHC-I or MHC-II on APCs. Antigens presented by MHC-I are processed
  through the proteasome and transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum by a transporter
  associated with antigen processing (TAP) where they associate with MHC-I and are
  finally transported to the cell membrane. MHC-II-presenting antigens are incorporated
  into cells by endocytosis, digested in lysosomes and loaded onto MHC-II molecules
  prior to migration to the cell surface. However, P. salmonis inhibits the MHC-I
  pathway (mhc1, cd8, tcra, tcrb gene underexpression) but activates the MHC-II pathway
  (mhc2, cd4), so its strategy is to evade the CD8+ T cell-mediated immune response.
  P. salmonis increases the expression of important co-stimulatory molecules on the
  macrophage surfaces (cd80/86, cd83) and reduces the expression of zbtb46, a transcriptional
  factor that inhibits APCs maturation (5) T cell activation and differentiation.
  CD4+ T helper cells can differentiate into Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg populations,
  which play different roles in the immune response. IL-12 promotes the differentiation
  of CD4 cells into Th1 cells to eliminate intracellular pathogens, while IL-2, IL-4,
  IL-13A, and IL-10 promote the differentiation of Th2 cells in response to bacteria
  and extracellular parasites. However, P. salmonis promotes IFN-γ production but
  reduces IL-12 production, reduces the expression of Th1 polarization-specific transcription
  factors (tbet, eomes) and, while promoting granzyme A expression (gzma), reduces
  perforin (mpeg1) production. In addition, P. salmonis increases the expression of
  Treg polarization-specific transcription factor (foxp3) suggesting the activation
  of an immune tolerance response.
