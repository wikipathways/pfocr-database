caption: 'Overview of arachidonic acid metabolism. Arachidonic acid (AA) is a polyunsaturated
  fatty acid found in the phospholipids of cell membranes. AA is mobilized into the
  cytoplasm mostly by the activation of calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase
  A2 (cPLA2). Free AA in the cytosol can be enzymatically metabolized to eicosanoids
  through three major pathways: the cytochrome P450, cyclooxygenase (COX) and/or 5-lipoxygenase
  (5-LOX) pathways. In the P450 pathway, AA is metabolized to epoxyeicosatrienoic
  acids (EETs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
  acids (HPETEs). In the COX pathway, AA is enzymatically converted to the intermediate
  prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), which is then sequentially metabolized to prostanoids,
  including prostaglandins (PGs), such as PGE2, PGF2, PGD2 and PGI2, and thromboxanes
  (TXs) such as TXA2 by specific prostaglandin and thromboxane synthases. In the LOX
  pathway, AA is metabolized by 12- and 15-LOX to 8-, 12- and 15-HPETE or by 5-LOX
  and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) to intermediary 5-HPETE. 5-HPETE is
  further processed to form leukotrienes (LTs), the first of which is the unstable
  leukotriene A4 (LTA4). LTA4 is subsequently converted to leukotriene B4 (LTB4) by
  LTA4 hydrolase or together with glutathione to leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by LTC4 synthase
  and glutathione-S-transferase. LTC4 is converted by ubiquitous enzymes to form leukotriene
  D4 (LTD4) and leukotriene E4 (LTE4). The members of the multidrug resistance-associated
  protein (MRP) family are efflux transporters for both PGs and LTs. The cysteinyl
  leukotrienes (CysLTs) LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 act via G protein-coupled receptors CysLT1R
  and CysLT2R at the cell surface and induce different signaling mechanisms.'
