caption: (A) Integrated overview modeling general interactions between central nutrient-sensing
  signaling pathways. Arrows and bars convey activating and inhibiting effects, respectively.
  TFs, physiologic signals, and drugs known to modulate this pathway are indicated
  in green, blue, and purple font, respectively. “P” indicates pathway components
  whose activity is modulated by phosphorylation. Red boxes detail physiologic effects.
  (B) Oligomycin-based pharmacologic RC inhibition in human FCLs alters mTORC1 and
  AMPK pathway activities. To confirm primary mitochondrial RC dysfunction was sufficient
  to alter mTORC1 signaling, FCLs from a healthy individual were treated in DMEM medium
  containing 20% fetal bovine serum for 24 hours and either low (1 g/L or 5 mMol)
  or high (4.5 g/L or 25 mMol) glucose, with either the complex V inhibitor, Oligomycin,
  (“O”, 5 uMol), an AMPK activator, AICAR (“A”, 2 mMol), or the mTORC1 inhibitor,
  rapamycin (“R”, 100 nMol). Regardless of glucose concentration, expression of a
  standard readout of mTORC1 pathway activity, phospho-S6 protein level, was reduced
  by oligomycin treatment, while increased phospho-AMPK expression was evident in
  high glucose media. (C) Oligomycin-based alteration of mTORC1 and AMPK pathway activities
  is dose- and nutrient-dependent. The same control FCLs as in (B) were treated for
  24 hours in either low (1 g/L or 5 mMol) or high (4.5 g/L or 25 mMol) glucose media
  with oligomycin in doses ranging from 0.25 uMol to 5 uMol. A general trend is evident
  of overall reduced phospho-S6 and phospho-AMPK at increasing doses of oligomycin.
  See also Fig. S13 in . (D) Pharmacologic RC inhibition increases  FOXO1  expression
  in high-glucose conditions. FCLs were treated for 24 hours in either low (1 g/L
  or 5 mMol) or high (4.5 g/L or 25 mMol) glucose media with a RC inhibitor targeting
  either complex I (rotenone, 0.1 uMol), III (antimycin A, 0.5 uMol), or V (oligomycin,
  1 uMol). As expected, FOXO1 expression was inhibited by high-glucose media. All
  three RC inhibitors increased FOXO1 relative expression in high-glucose conditions,
  whereas FOXO1 expression was decreased by oligomycin in low-glucose media. (E–F)
  Integrated view of detailed gene and sub-gene level transcriptional alterations
  in RC disease among central nutrient-sensing signaling network modulators. Their
  major downstream targets and pathways were presented in separated plots. An overall
  inverse expression pattern is evident in RC disease between (E) skeletal muscle
  and (F) FCL.
