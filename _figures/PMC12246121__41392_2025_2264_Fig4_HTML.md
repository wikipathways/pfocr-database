caption: The signaling pathways mediated by iPRRs and their regulation. iPRRs predominantly
  transmit inhibitory signals through motifs of ITIMs or ITSM located in their cytoplasmic
  tails. Upon receptor ligation, these motifs undergo phosphorylation, triggering
  the recruitment of inhibitory effectors containing SH2 domains, such as SHP-1, SHP-2,
  SHIP, and Csk. The known group of iPRRs currently includes Siglec-10, CD300a/f,
  Siglecs 2,3,5–11, CEACAM1, LILRB1 (CD85j), LILRB3 (CD85a), TIGIT, PVR, LAIR-1, and
  SIRL-1. In scenarios where tolerating damage is advantageous for the host, DAMPs
  or PAMPs can trigger iPRRs to dampen the immune response. Conversely, when damage
  cannot be tolerated, DAMPs or PAMPs signal via activating PRRs to initiate a robust
  immune response. The relative abundance of PRRs and iPRRs, along with their corresponding
  ligands, dictates the intensity of the ensuing immune reaction. This figure is created
