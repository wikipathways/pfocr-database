caption: Proposed signaling pathway involved in the effect of U-II on L-type Ca2+
  channels. U-II binds to U-IIR, which is coupled to the G-protein Gi/o, causing it
  to release the Gβγ subunits. Activation of PI3K by the Gβγ subunit causes an increase
  in PKCβ1 activity and subsequent stimulation of the L-type Ca2+ channels. PI3K catalyzes
  the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which serves as a second messenger that helps to activate
  Akt. Neither PKA, Akt, PKCβ2, nor direct interaction between Gβγ and L-type Ca2+
  channel is necessary for the U-IIR-mediated increase of ICa,L. Whether PKCβ1 directly
  phosphorylates L-type Ca2+ channels or acts on an intermediate protein remains unclear.
