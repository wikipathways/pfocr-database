caption: PRR and signaling pathways that lead to differentiation of antifungal T-helper
  cells. Recognition of fungal pathogen–associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is mediated
  by TLRs and CLRs. The binding of fungi or β-glucan to Dectin-1 recruits SYK to the
  two phosphorylated receptors, which leads to the formation of a complex involving
  Card9, BCL10, and MALT1 (BCM). This results in the release of NF-κB consisting of
  either p65–p50 or REL–p50 dimers into the nucleus (). Syk activation also induces
  the noncanonical NF-κB pathway mediated by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and the nuclear
  translocation of p52–RELB dimers. Dectin-1 enhances TLR2 and TLR4-induced cytokines
  in a Syk-independent manner through the serine/threonine protein kinase RAF1 by
  Ras proteins, which leads to the phosphorylation of p65 (). Among other cytokines,
  these pathways lead to the production of IL-6, IL-23, and IL-12 that induce Th17
  and Th1 cells, respectively. Dectin-1 recognition of C. albicans can also activate
  the NLRP3 inflammasome through a mechanism that involves Syk, ROS, and potassium
  efflux (). Fungus-induced pro-IL-1β is cleaved by active caspase-1 to bioactive
  IL-1β to favor Th17 development. Dectin-2 activation leads to FcR-γ-dependent recruitment
  and phosphorylation of Syk and activated NF-κB and MAPKs (p38, JNK, and Erk) ().
  Card9 is required for the activation of NF-κB and production of cytokines that lead
  to Th17 cell differentiation. Recognition of α-mannose in Malassezia species by
  Mincle activates the FcR-γ-Syk-Card9 pathway and translocates NF-κB into the nucleus
  to induce the activation of proinflammatory cytokines (). *Although fungal PAMPs
  have yet to show the ability to induce a distinct T-helper subset by this pathway,
  the mycobacterial cord factor and its synthetic analog are potent adjuvants for
  the differentiation of Mincle-induced Th1 and Th17 cells (). Dectin-3 (MCL, Clec4d,
  or Clecsf8) also recognizes α-mannan from C. albicans () and TDM from M. tuberculosis
  (). Dectin-3 can dimerize with Dectin-2 () and Mincle (). It is unclear whether
  the induction of Th17 and Th1 cells requires recognition of fungal PAMPs by homo-
  versus heterodimers of Dectin-2. The MR lacks a classical signaling motif in its
  short cytoplasmic tail, but it induces proinflammatory cytokines that have been
  implicated in Th17 and Th1 differentiation (). Although MR-dependent triggering
  of human memory T cells produced IL-17, further studies with naïve T cells will
  be needed to establish the role of the MR in Th17 cell differentiation (). Myd88
  is critical for the signaling of TLR2 and TLR4. Phospholipomannans and O-linked
  mannans are recognized by TLRs at the plasma membrane, whereas fungal nucleic acids
  are sensed by endosomal TLRs and induce NF-κB-, MAPK-, and IRF-dependent cytokine
  production. TLR2 signaling is thought to generate weaker proinflammatory signals,
  but induce strong stimulation of TGF-β and IL-10 that induces Treg cells (; ).
