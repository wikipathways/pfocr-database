caption: PEPC (Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) drives considerable carbon flux (Phosphoenolpyruvate)
  into TCA cycle and eventually control protein synthesis. Phosphoenolpyruvate is
  also the major substrate in the lipid biosynthesis pathway and ACC (Acetyl-CoA carboxylase)
  is the major enzyme that controls fatty acid biosynthesis. Since both protein and
  lipid biosynthesis pathway share the same substrate, the deceased consumption of
  phosphoenolpyruvate of either pathway is helpful to increase the final product (oil
  or protein) in the other pathway. In this report, the PEPC was downregulated via
  RNAi and theoretically decreased the carbon flow into the TCA cycle.
