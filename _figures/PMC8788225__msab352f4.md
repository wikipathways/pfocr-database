caption: 'Pairwise comparisons of immune family expression similarity and evolutionary
  similarity. Evolutionary similarities (based on feature metric medians) of pairs
  of gene families are compared with their expression similarities at (A) fine-scale
  resolution and (B) broad-scale resolution. Pairs of families with significant (P<0.05)
  gene expression co-occurrence scores are shown with purple circles, with nonsignificant
  pairs shown in gray, and with circle sizes scaled by the P value. Family acronyms
  are defined in  and are colored according to categories defined based on their putative
  roles in the principal immune phases: classical recognition (red), other recognition
  (blue), pathway signaling (bright green), pathway modulation (purple), cascade modulation
  (orange), antimicrobial effectors (pink), effector enzymes (olive green), autophagy
  (dark cyan), RNAi (black), cytokines (brown), and toll receptors (dark green).'
