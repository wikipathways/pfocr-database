caption: 'The “heme-mitochondria” relationship and the putative heme-related targets
  for the therapy of neurodegenerative disorders. Heme and mitochondria share a strong
  relationship based on several elements: heme synthesis occurs partly in the mitochondrion
  and acts as a cataplerotic pathway for the Kreb’s cycle; heme is a cofactor for
  cytochromes c and cytochromes in complexes II-III-IV of the mitochondrial ETC [];
  heme influences the ATP translocation between mitochondria and cytosol mediated
  by adenine nucleotide translocases (ANTs); heme export influences calcium (Ca2+)
  flux in mitochondria. Therefore, modulation of heme metabolism can lead to modification
  of mitochondrial functions. The control of intracellular heme levels is achieved
  by a balance among synthesis, catabolism and proper trafficking of heme. Thus, all
  these processes (highlighted with red boxes in the figure) represent putative good
  targets for the therapy of neurodegenerative disorder.'
