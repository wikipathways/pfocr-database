caption: (A) GATA2 plays a pivotal role in both TRH-induced activation as well as
  T3/TR-dependent inhibition. Unlike the PRL gene, transactivation of the TSHβ gene
  is independent of the MAPK pathway. Pit1 competes the binding of SR binding protein
  and protects the function of GATA2 from inhibition and also binds to Pit1-US to
  cooperate with GATA2s to recruit a coactivator, CBP/p300. PIC, pre-initiation complex.
  Pol II, RNA polymerase II. (B) Roles of GATA2, Pit1 and TR in hypo- and hyper-thyroidism.
  Co-expression of GATA2 and Pit1 determines thyrotroph differentiation. With support
  by Pit1, GATA2 maintains the basal transcription of the TSHβ gene and mediates TRH/TRH-R1
  signaling in hypothyroidism while unliganded TR alone is not a transcriptional activator.
  Inhibition by T3/TR is dominant over the activation by GATA2 even in the presence
  of TRH signaling.
