caption: Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway can result
  from numerous glioma-associated genetic changes. Inactivation of the NF1 gene results
  in increased RAS activity, which in turn leads to activation of phosphoinositol-3-kinase
  and Akt. Increased Akt activity leads to increased mTOR activation, either by direct
  activation of mTOR or via phosphorylation and inactivation of the TSC signaling
  complex. Loss of TSC gene function results in increased RAS homolog enriched in
  brain activity, which in turn results in increased mTOR activity. In addition, the
  PTEN tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutationally inactivated in gliomas, leading
  to increased phosphoinositol-3-kinase activity and mTOR activation. Similarly, mutational
  activation or constitutive signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases, such as
  EGFR, results in RAS and phosphoinositol-3-kinase hyperactivation and downstream
  increased mTOR pathway activation.
