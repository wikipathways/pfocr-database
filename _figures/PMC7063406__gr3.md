caption: 'Neutrophil dysfunction: involvement of molecules, indicated through red
  circles which can cause inflammatory bowel disease. a. Subunits of nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase are involved in secreting reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). b. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PT) transports glucose
  from cytoplasm to endoplasmic reticulum. G6PTase-α phosphorylates glucose to continue
  glycolysis. c. Integrin on binding to its substrate, initiates AKT pathway and helps
  in cell survival.'
