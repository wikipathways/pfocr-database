caption: Deficiency of OAT3 affects the concentration of metabolites found in a number
  of biochemical pathways. A–C, metabolites altered in the Oat3KO visualized using
  the Metabolon Metabolync Pathway application for Cytoscape. Metabolites are arranged
  by their associations with the various pathways (Lipid Metabolism (A); Amino Acid
  Metabolism (B); Xenobiotic Metabolism (C)). The size and color of each node (metabolite)
  is based on the magnitude of the change (size) and whether its concentration was
  increased (dark red, p ≤ 0.05; bright red, 0.05 < p < 0.10) or decreased (dark green,
  p ≤ 0.05; bright green, 0.05 < p < 0.10) in the plasma of the Oat3KO. Metabolites
  with concentrations that were trending up (pale red) or down (pale green), but did
  not reach levels of significance (p ≥ 0.1) are also shown.
