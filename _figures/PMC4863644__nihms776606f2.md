caption: 'Mechanisms of glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and suggested
  stimulus/secretion coupling factors. The canonical model of GSIS holds that an increase
  in β-cell glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism of glucose lead to increases in
  cytosolic ATP:ADP ratio, resulting in closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels,
  plasma membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and
  Ca2+-mediated activation of insulin granule exocytosis. β-cells have high capacity
  for anaplerotic influx of glucose-derived pyruvate into the TCA cycle via pyruvate
  carboxylase (PC), which in turn is paired with efflux of citrate and isocitrate
  via the citrate-isocitrate carrier (CIC), and cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase
  (ICDc)-mediated conversion of isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate under generation of
  NADPH, a suggested coupling factor for GSIS. NADPH is also generated to lesser degree
  in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a revived pathway of interest for regulation
  of GSIS. Other suggested metabolic coupling factors include glutamate, GTP, protein
  prenylation and two new candidates, ZMP and GDP-mannose identified from metabolomics
  studies. Fatty acids potentiate GSIS via mechanisms that involve activation of the
  surface receptor FFAR/GPR40 as well as intracellular fatty acid metabolism, and
  fatty acid-mediated coupling factor candidates include glycerolipids such as monoacylglycerol.
  GSIS is also amplified by incretins secreted from the small intestine in response
  to a meal. A recent metabolomics study has identified a novel pathway involving
  cytosolic glutamate derived from glucose to a signal for incretin-induced insulin
  secretion (see text for details). G3P: glycerol-3-phosphate; G6P: glucose -6-phosphate;
  GRX: glutaredoxin; GSH: reduced glutathione; R5P: ribose-5-phosphate; M6P: mannose-6-phosphate.'
