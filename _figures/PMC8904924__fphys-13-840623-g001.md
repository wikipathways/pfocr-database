caption: The chemical reaction between ozone and PUFA (poli-unsaturated fatty acids)
  in the insterstitial water (or plasma) produce several ROS, mainly H2O2, and several
  LOPs, mainly 4-HNE (4-hydroxynonenal). Almost all H2O2 is kidnaped by erythrocytes
  (not reflected in this figure) if present. In nucleated cells, LOPs activates the
  NRF2 pathway, inducing the production of ARE (antioxidant response elements) and
  blocking the NFKB pathway. A small amount of H2O2 stimulates the NFKB pahtway, usually
  balanced with the NRF2 blocking action, producing a inmmunomodulation.
