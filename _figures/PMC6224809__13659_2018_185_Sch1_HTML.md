caption: 'Possible reaction products of glucosinolate hydrolysis and hypothetical
  biosynthetic pathway of macamides. It is assumed that macamides are derived from
  two main substrates: free fatty acids and benzylamine. These two main substrates
  arise from the hydrolysis of membrane and storage lipids, and glucosinolates, respectively.
  The oxidation of free fatty acids bring macaenes out'
