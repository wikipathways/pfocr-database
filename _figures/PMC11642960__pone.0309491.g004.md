caption: STRING analysis of the common interactors between SRF and AR revealed other
  proteins involved in the AR/SRF interactome. A. Common interactors and their known
  interactions with AR and SRF. Common interactor nodes are shown in white. AR and
  SRF nodes are shown in red and green respectively. Yellow nodes represent other
  proteins following network expansion. B) Following network expansion, a list of
  highly significant KEGG pathways were highlighted. Blue nodes represent proteins
  involved in the PI3k-Akt pathways, red nodes proteins involved in prostate cancer
  signalling, and green nodes MAPK signalling pathway. The highlighted pathways all
  have a false discovery ratio below 0.05. The thickness of the lines between proteins
  indicates the strength of data support
