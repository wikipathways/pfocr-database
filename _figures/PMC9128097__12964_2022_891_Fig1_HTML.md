caption: 'The rhythmic disturbance and its consequences in chondrocytes in osteoarthritis
  condition. During osteoarthritis process, the cartilage core rhythmic genes, including
  Bmal1, Clock and Per2 are disturbed. The disturbance of core rhythmic genes in cartilage
  increases the catabolism and decreases the anabolism through Tgfb pathway. Other
  rhythm-related genes, including Col2a1, Mmp13, Adamts5 are also associated to metabolic
  disorder in osteoarthritis cartilage. OA, osteoarthritis; Bmal1: brain and muscle
