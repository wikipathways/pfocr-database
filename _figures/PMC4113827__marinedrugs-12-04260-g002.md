caption: 'The TLR4 signaling pathway. When LPS is bound to the bacterial outer membrane
  or present in intact outer membrane vesicles, its toxic potential is not released,
  and as such, these molecules were termed “endotoxins”. As soon as LPS is released,
  this is changed. Free LPS is bound by LBP and transferred to CD14. MD-2 then binds
  the LPS and forms LPS-MD-2-TLR4 complexes. Dimerization of two of these complexes
  then occurs. Dimerization of TLR4 molecules leads to the recruitment of adapter
  molecules: MyD88, the TIR-domain containing adapter protein-inducing IFN-β (TRIF)
  and the TRIF-related adapter molecule (TRAM). A signaling cascade is initiated,
  which eventually leads to the degradation of the IKK complex, which frees the transcription
  factor, NF-κB. NF-κB then moves into the nucleus and starts transcription of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α. Via a different pathway, initiated by different
  adapter molecules, type I interferon genes are also transcribed, leading to the
  production of IFN-α/β.'
