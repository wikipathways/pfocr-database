caption: Upon energy stress-stimuli, the AMPK signaling pathway is upregulated, resulting
  in the increase of intracellular NAD+ level. At the same time, histone deacetylase
  SIRT1 and/or transcription factors such as PGC-1α are phosphorylated in AMPK-dependent
  manner. The enzymes involved in the pathways are in bold. P in green dots denotes
  for phosphorylation-mediated regulation. De-Ac in blue circles indicates deacetylation-mediated
  regulation. AMPK; AMP-activated kinase, NAMPT; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase,
  SIRT1; sirtuin 1, PGC-1α; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator
  1-alpha, AICAR; 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside.
