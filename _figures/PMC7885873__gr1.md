caption: 'Cytokine regulated alterations to the splenic microenvironment during experimental
  visceral leishmaniasis. Splenic architecture is highly compartmentalised in the
  steady state (left hand panel) and alters significantly post infection (right hand
  panel). Open circled letters A- T indicate key changes or underlying mechanism involved
  in this remodelling process (see text for further details). (A) In the steady state
  red and white pulp are segregated by a marginal zone punctuated by marginal zone
  bridging channels (B) Increased angiogenesis and neovascularisation during infection.
  (C) Neovascularisation of the white pulp was found to be closely associated with
  F4/80hi CD11blo macrophages during infection. (D) TNF mediates killing of MZM (marginal
  zone macrophages) during infection. (E) MZM localisation maintained by CCL21 and
  CCL19 expression under steady state conditions. (F) Excessive TNF production in
  the red and white pulp induces IL-10 production. (G) IL-10 suppresses CCR7-dependent
  DC migration causing spatial segregation between DCs and T cells during infection.
  (H) IRF7 is upregulated in infected macrophages and is a source of TNF, IL-10 and
  MMP-9 during infection. (I) Blimp-1 (encoded by Prdm1) induces IL-10 production
  which serves to protect against TNF-mediated pathology during infection. (J) IFN-I
  suppress protective CD4+ T cell responses but is required for IL-10 production during
  infection. (K) TLR7-IRF5 pathway sensitises IFNγ+ CD4+ T cells to TRAIL-mediated
  cell death during infection. (L) Disorganisation of the white pulp has been associated
  with high levels of MMP-9 during infection. (M) The perivascular stromal system
  (PVS) act as a pathway to guide T cells and DCs into appropriate areas of the spleen
  under steady state conditions. (N) Increased hematopoietic activity and stromal
  cells supports the development of regulatory DCs during infection. (O) CXCL13 production
  by FDCs and the stromal network is required for the maintenance of lymphoid follicles
  under steady state conditions. (P) Increased CXCL12, BAFF and APRIL prolongs plasma
  cell survival during infection. (Q) inflammatory monocytes specifically impaired
  the remodelling of Meca32+ and CD31+ vasculature in the red pulp during infection.
  (R) lymphoid tissue inducer (Lti) cells interact with immune and stromal populations
  to maintain the splenic architecture under steady state conditions. (S) Lti cells
  are displaced from the PALS to the red pulp during infection. (T) Increased production
  of IgG in the red pulp during infection. Abbreviations: FRC (fibroblast reticular
