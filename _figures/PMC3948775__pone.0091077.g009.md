caption: 'Legend: Interactions inside each pathway shows the significant interactions
  from analysis with genes as nodes and significant KEGG pathway interactions as edges.
  Blue diamond nodes: pathways that might be involved in steroidogenesis, but not
  found in results. Cyan colored nodes: chemical compound or molecules synthesized
  in pathways. Purple node: external stimulus in the form of hormone signaling. Grey
  solid edges: hypothetical interactions based on information from literature. Very
  light blue circular nodes: genes involved in significant interactions. Red dashed
  edges: interactions positive and significant in HA samples, positive in LA samples.
  Orange solid edges: interactions positive in HA samples, negative and significant
  in LA samples. Orange dashed edges: interactions negative in HA samples, negative
  and significant in LA samples. Dark green solid edges: interactions positive and
  significant in LA samples, negative in HA samples. Dark green dashed edges: interactions
  positive and significant in LA samples, positive in HA samples. Light green solid
  edges: interactions positive in LA samples, negative and significant in HA samples.
  Light green dashed edges: interactions negative in LA samples, negative and significant
  in HA samples. In HA animals, steroid synthesis and androstenone synthesis might
  be activated by cAMP-PKC signaling and further boosted by de novo cholesterol synthesis
  by virtue of an active fatty acid metabolism pathway and anti lipid peroxidation
  activity of members of glutathione metabolism pathway. In LA animals steroid hormone
  synthesis and androstenone synthesis could have been affected by weak cAMP-PKA signaling
  and inhibition of steroidogenesis by ceramides synthesized from sphingolipid metabolic
  pathway.'
