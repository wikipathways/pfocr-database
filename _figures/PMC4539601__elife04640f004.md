caption: '(A) The generation of the average model. The set of <Wij> averaged over
  the Wij in all models provide the average network model. The signaling processes
  are explained through qualitative analysis of the average model and its functional
  subnetworks (see  for quantitative analysis). (B) The average network model contains
  proteomic (white) and phenotypic nodes (orange) and the average signaling interactions
  (<Wij> > 0.2) over the model solutions. The edges between the BRAF, CRAF, TSC2,
  and AKTpT308 represent the cross-pathway interactions between the MAPK and PI3K/AKT
  pathways (see  for analysis of edge distributions in the solution ensemble) (green
  edges: positive signed, red edges: negative signed interactions). (C) Cell cycle
  signaling subnetwork contains the interactions between the cyclins, CDKs, and other
  associated molecules (e.g., p27/Kip1). RBpS807 and cyclin D1 are the hub nodes in
  the subnetwork and connect multiple signaling entities. (D) ERK subnetwork. MEKpS217
  is the critical hub in this pathway and links upstream BRAF and SRC to downstream
  effectors such as ERK phosphorylation. (E) In the PI3K/AKT subnetwork, the SRC nodes
  (i.e., phosphorylation, total level, activity) are upstream of PI3K and AKT (total
  level, AKTpS473 and AKTp308) and the AKT nodes are the major hubs. Downstream of
  AKT, the pathway branches to mTOR, P70S6K and S6 phosphorylation cascade and the
  GSK3β phosphorylation events. A negative edge originating from mTORpS2448 and acting
  on AKTpS473 presumably captures the well-defined negative feedback loop in the AKT
  pathway (). Note that nodes tagged with ‘a’ (e.g., aBRAFV600E) are activity nodes,
  which couple drug perturbations to proteomic changes.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04640.015'
