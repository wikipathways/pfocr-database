caption: 'Effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of PDHK1 and PKM2 on the fates of pyruvate
  and acetyl-CoA in normal and cancer cells (modified according to []). (Blue frame)
  In normal cells, acetyl-CoA is formed in by glycolytic pathway and fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO). Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) generated during glycolysis is converted into pyruvate
  by the highly active tetrameric isoform M2 of pyruvate kinase (PKM2). Pyruvate enters
  the mitochondria and is transformed into acetyl-CoA by dehydrogenase complex (PDC)
  as a result of irreversible oxidative decarboxylation. Then, acetyl-CoA is primarily
  oxidized to produce CO2 and generate NADH and FADH2 in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle. Reduced nucleotides are the fuel of the mitochondrial electron transport
  chain (ETC) that is used to create cellular energy in the form of ATP. A small fraction
  of acetyl-CoA is used to synthesize FA and cholesterol. (Red frame) Oncogenic tyrosine
  kinases (BCR-ABL, JAK2) highly expressed in cancer cells perform tyrosine phosphorylation
  of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1). PDHK1 phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase
  alpha 1 (PDHA1), which is a subunit of the PDC. The result of PDHA1 phosphorylation
  is the inhibition of the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and an increase in
  lactate production. Additionally, oncogenic tyrosine kinases phosphorylate PKM2,
  which causes a reduction of its activity as a result of the conversion of the tetrameric
  form to the dimeric form. The result of these tyrosine phosphorylation events is
  the suppression of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. Therefore, cancer cells promote
  the utilization of TCA intermediates derived from glutamine metabolism (α-ketoglutarate,
  α-KG) to provide citrate for fatty acids biosynthesis. Additional source of acetyl-CoA
  is the enhanced FAO. (Green frame) Activation of a growth factor receptor involves
  its dimerization and autophosphorylation of key tyrosine residues and leads to the
  activation of downstream signaling cascades, including the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway,
  which promotes cell proliferation. Oncogenic tyrosine kinases overexpressed in cancer
  cells also stimulate PI3K/Akt pathway, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. Oncogenic
