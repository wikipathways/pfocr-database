caption: 'Blood Transcription Module gene expression changes that were correlated
  with metabolite changes. Node color gradient encodes fold change from pre-vaccination.
  In red: up-regulated compared to pre-vaccination; in blue: down-regulated compared
  to pre-vaccination. Edges represent correlation between Blood Transcription Modules
  and metabolite responses. Edge thickness and edge color is scaled with increasing
  correlation. Circles represent Blood Transcription Modules. Boxes are used for metabolites.
  Metabolites are labeled by mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time (rt). In
  addition, mappings to KEGG metabolic pathways are included as part of metabolite
  labels if a matching KEGG compound could be identified. For example, the metabolite
  peak with m/z = 180.087 and rt = 211s is a tentative match to protonated glucosamine
  by accurate mass and was linked to the Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism
  and Metabolic KEGG pathways (). (A): Day 2 IFN-γ signature; (B): Day 2 T cell signature;
  (C): Day 14: B cell signature. KEGG pathway information was added for metabolites
  with an annotation confidence score ≥ 2 based on HMDB mappings.'
