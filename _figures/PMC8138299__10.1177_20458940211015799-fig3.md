caption: 'Complement regulation on endothelial cells: C3, factor B (FB), and factor
  D (FD) are Alternative pathway proteins that are present in plasma. These proteins
  can be rapidly activated on susceptible surfaces. Endothelial cells express several
  different membrane bound complement regulatory proteins, including decay accelerating
  factor (CD55) and membrane cofactor protein (CD46). In addition, factor H is a soluble
  Alternative pathway regulator present in plasma that binds to glycosaminoglycans
  and sialic acid displayed on the surface of endothelial cells. These regulatory
  proteins inhibit complement activation at the levels of the C3 and C5 convertases.
  Another regulatory protein, CD59, is expressed on endothelial cells and blocks formation
  of C5b-9 (membrane attack complex, or MAC). C3a and C5a are soluble peptides generated
  during complement activation. They are rapidly inactivated by carboxypeptidases
  in serum. This system of regulatory proteins ordinarily protects endothelial cells
  from complement-mediated injury. In some diseases, however, impaired complement
  regulation on endothelial cells is associated with vascular injury.'
