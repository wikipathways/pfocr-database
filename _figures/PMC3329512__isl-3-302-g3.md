caption: Figure 3. Generation of cytosolic NADPH by the pyruvate/malate pathway. PC
  catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, which can yield malate catalyzed
  by mitochondrial MDH. Malate export into the cytosol via the dicarboxylate carrier
  can lead to the formation of the coupling factor NADPH through the conversion of
  malate to pyruvate by cytosolic ME. Pyruvate can then re-enter the mitochondria
  for conversion to oxaloacetate. Critically, while the cME is known to generate NAPDH,
  the isoform expressed in the mitochondrion (mME) generates NADH. Thus, it is crucial
  that the TCA cycle intermediates are exported to the cytosol for the formation of
  NADPH for insulin secretion. DIC, dicarboxylate carrier; MDH, malate dehydrogenase;
  ME, malic enzyme; MPC, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier; PC, pyruvate carboxylase;
  PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
