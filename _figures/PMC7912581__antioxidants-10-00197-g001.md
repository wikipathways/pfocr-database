caption: 'A new paradigm in the mechanism of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
  (GSIS): Essential requirement of redox signaling. Upon glucose intake, pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) and redox shuttles supply cytosolic NADPH to increase NOX4 activity
  and thus elevate H2O2, which substantiates redox signaling. The two possible hypotheses
  assume two distinct targets of H2O2: either that (A) KATP is closed exclusively
  when both ATP plus H2O2 are elevated (as supported by the patch-clamp data in Ref.
  []); or (B) that KATP is closed by ATP, whereas the TRPM2 channel (or other nonspecific
  calcium channels (NSCCs)) is activated by H2O2. In both cases, the depolarization
  shift by NSCCs is essentially required for achieving the −50 mV depolarization threshold
  for CaV activation despite 100% of the KATP ensemble being closed. Mechanism (A)
  plus additional H2O2 stimulation of TRPM2 is also plausible.'
