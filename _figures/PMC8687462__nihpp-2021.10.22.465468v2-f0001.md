caption: Mimics and biosynthesis of phosphoserine. (A) Phosphoserine and its mimics
  can be incorporated into proteins via a variety of techniques. Autonomous incorporation
  implies the free amino can be biosynthesized by the expression host and then incorporated
  into proteins during translation. Other mimics such as nhpSer, F2-nhpSer and pCys
  have previously only been installed using the indicated chemical biology approaches.
  (B) Phosphoserine is a biosynthetic intermediate of serine. (C) This pathway can
  be altered for GCE purposes to elevate (for pSer GCE) or eliminate (for nhpSer GCE)
  intracellular concentrations of the free phosphoserine amino acid.
