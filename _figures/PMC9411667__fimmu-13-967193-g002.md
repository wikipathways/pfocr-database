  TGF-βcan interact with phosphorylated type II and type I receptors activating receptor-regulated
  SMADs (R-SMADs, a heterodimer of SMAD2 and SMAD3) to form the heteromeric trimer
  with SMAD4. The nuclear translocation of R-SMAD can promote the M2 polarization,
  while SMAD6 and SMAD7 as the negative regulators of TGF-β signaling transduction
  are also the target genes. Besides, due to the ligation of DAMPs with TLRs, especially
  TLR4, MyD88 and TRIF, TLR adaptors containing a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain,
  can bind directly to TLRs and recruit MAL and TRAM, while SARM negatively can regulate
  the pathways. TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (dependent on
  TRIF) can be recruited and then activates TRAF6, and IκBs (especially IκBα) can
  degrade leading to the release of NF-κB (P50/65) and its translocation to the nucleus,
  which can promote the M1 polarization. TLR signaling cascade can also activate NOTCH
  and NLRP3 signaling, which can regulate pro-inflammatory responses via the regulated
  transcription of NF-κB. However, NOTCH4 can negatively regulate the TLR/NF-κB signaling.
  Finally, STAT/JAK signaling pathway start from tyrosine kinase-associated receptors
  binding various cytokines and growth factors, followed by the phosphorylation of
  these receptors and JAKs, and the initiation of the phosphorylation and activation
  of STATs. Generally, the activation of STAT6 signaling can promote M2 phenotype,
  while STAT1 and STAT3 can perform complicatedly under the effects of various cytokines
  or growth factors. JAKs can also activate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, promoting
  M2 polarization, which can play a collaborative role in JAK/STAT6 signaling pathway.
  In addition, STATs can also be activated by JNK and P38, which belongs to extracellular
  signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), promoting M1 polarization.
