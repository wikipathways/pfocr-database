caption: The mechanisms of gut microbiome delaying cancer progression. Clostridium
  sporogenes-derived IPA suppresses IL-17A in Th17 cells via mTOR/ribosome pathways,
  while its BCFAs/SCFAs enhance Treg activity and IL-22 production. L. intestinalis
  effectively suppressed tumor growth in CRC mice through increasing the infiltration
  of immune cells in the TME, particularly DCs, through NOD1/NF-κB signaling pathway.
  Lactococcus lactis GEN3013 boosts cytotoxic immune cells (CD4+/CD8+ T, NK) in TME;
  Propionates derived from several gut bacteria activate the AMPK/mTOR pathway through
  the vitamin D receptor (VDR), inhibit glycolysis in CRC cells. Butyrate exerts its
  inhibitory effects on tumor growth by enhancing CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity through
  GPR109A/HOPX signaling, inducing lung cancer cell cycle arrest (cell cycle proteins/CD90)
  and apoptosis, modulating thermal apoptosis/metastasis proteins (CD147/VEGF/MMP-9),
  and reprogramming cancer metabolism via pyruvate accumulation and glycolysis suppression,
  Butyrate can also curb the tumor cell invasion/migration by modulating proteolysis
  via suppressing uPA and enhancing TIMP-1/2 activity. Finally, IP6 from yeast/actinomycetes
  inhibits the expression of liver metastasis-linked Tnfrsf1b by restoring the abundance
  of L. helveticus/L. lactis
