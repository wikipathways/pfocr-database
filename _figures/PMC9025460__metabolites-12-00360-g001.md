caption: Electron entrance in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The main entry points
  converging at the Q-junction (ubiquinol/ubiquinone) of the OXPHOS system are illustrated
  here and described as numbers 1 to 8. (1) The NADH pathway provides electrons to
  complex I of the electron transport system. These electrons can be provided—among
  others—by pyruvate (through pyruvate dehydrogenase), and glutamate (through glutamate
  dehydrogenase). (2) The succinate pathway uses succinate dehydrogenase to reduce
  FAD and feed complex II. (3) The electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) pathway
  (in light green) receives electrons from fatty acyl-CoA of various chain lengths.
  The carnitine shuttle system is composed of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1),
  carnitine–acylcarnitine translocase (CACT), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2
  (CPT2). Oxidation of the long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) depends on the carnitine
  shuttle system, whereas the oxidation of short- (SCFAs) and medium- (MCFAs) chain
  fatty acids are largely independent of that system (reviewed by []). Once in the
  mitochondrial matrix, the fatty acids enter the process of long-chain, medium-chain,
  or short-chain fatty acid oxidation. In this process, NAD and FAD are reduced to
  NADH and FADH2; FADH2 is used as a substrate for electron-transferring flavoprotein
  (ETF), while NADH feeds complex I. Both NADH and FADH2 provide electrons into the
  Q-junction. The dashed line links LCFA, MCFA, and SCFA oxidation to the NADH pathway,
  which is not rate-limiting for the ETF pathway. Malate is also provided, with all
  fatty acid substrates, as a metabolite in the citric acid cycle to prevent the accumulation
  of acetyl-CoA and the concurrent inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. Dimethylglycine
  dehydrogenase (DMGDH) and sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH) can also feed electrons
  through the ETF pathway. (4) Glycerophosphate oxidation (in pink) occurs via mitochondrial
  glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGpDH) and shuttles electrons through FADH2 directly
  to the Q-junction. (5) Choline oxidation (in purple) occurs through choline dehydrogenase
  (ChoDH), which reduces FAD. (6) Proline dehydrogenase (ProDH, in blue) catalyzes
  proline oxidation and FAD reduction. (7) The dihydroorotate (Dho, in orange) is
  transformed into orotate by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DhoDH), releasing an electron
  from flavin mononucleotide directly into the Q-junction. (8) sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase
  (SQOR, in grey) oxidizes H2S and transfers an electron into the Q-junction. After
  convergence of electrons from diverse pathways at the Q-junction, they follow a
  linear segment through complexes III and IV before reducing molecular oxygen. Electron
  transfer is coupled with proton pumping into intermembrane space by complexes I,
  III, and IV, generating a proton motive force, and providing the energy required
  to phosphorylate ADP into ATP via ATP synthase (part of the phosphorylation system,
  also supported by the adenine nucleotide translocase, ANT, and the phosphate carrier,
  PiC). All components located in, or peripherally associated with, the mitochondrial
  membranes are in red; solid lines represent those associated with the inner membrane
  and the dashed line represents the one component associated with the outer mitochondrial
  membrane (i.e., CPT1).
