caption: 'Stress and infection lead to two different pathways for stimulation of PMN
  secretion, by release of CgA and CgA-derived peptides from the adrenal medulla,
  as indicated by 1a–6a (black), and by PVL leucocidin stimulation by S. aureus infections,
  as indicated by 1b–3b (grey), respectively. Abbreviated symbols: P (CHR, CAT), P''
  (CAT), CPP (Cell Penetrating Peptide), CaM (calmodulin), iPLA2 (calcium independent
  phospholipase A2) LysoPL (lysophospholipids); GC (Golgi complex); PVL (Panton-Valentine
  leucocidin), R (receptor). The stress-stimulated pathway leads to penetration of
  P into the cytoplasm (2a), resulting in removal of inhibitory CaM, activation of
  iPLA2 to produce LysoPL (3a) and activation of Ca2+ influx through SOC (4a), converging
  on activated docking of secretory granules (5a) and subsequent release of proteins
  of relevance for innate immunity (6a). The negative feedback induced by P'' on nicotinic
  cholinergic receptor of chromaffin cell is also indicated (7a). The infective route
  leads to activation of the putative PVL receptor coupled to opening of Ca2+-channels
  and a rise in intracellular Ca2+ (3b) that converges on docking of secretory granules
  and subsequent secretion of proteins of relevance for innate immunity (6a). Transcription
  of CgA in response to stress and infection is also indicated. Insert.The alignment
  of the two P sequences (CHR and CAT) with that of Penetratin (Cell penetrating peptide,
  CPP).'
