caption: 'Following activation of BK receptors by their respective agonists, a cascade
  of pathways is activated, targeting the mitochondria, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum,
  the nucleus and the BBB leading to various responses of the cells, such as apoptosis,
  neurodegeneration, cytoskeletal reorganization, BBB leakage, survival and proliferation.
  Uncontrolled B2R GPCR-signaling disrupts the integrity of the BBB increasing BBB
  permeability as well as increased apoptosis and subsequent neurodegeneration post-mitochondrial
  overload, the outcome also observed via the JNK/c-Jun pathway. Cytoskeletal reorganization
  is mediated via CaMKII and cdc42. In contrast, inhibition of cAMP common to both
  B1R and B2R, promotes anti-inflammation and neuroprotection. B1R-induced decreased
  apoptosis is mediated via activation of the ERK1/2 (mainly ERK1) and PI3K-Akt pathways.
  BK: bradykinin; BBB: blood-brain barrier; B1R: kinin 1 receptor; B2R: kinin 1 receptor;
  GPCR: G protein-coupled receptor.'
