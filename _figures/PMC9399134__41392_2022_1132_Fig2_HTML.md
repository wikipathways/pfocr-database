caption: Alternative cell death process-dependent BMW pathway for metastasis. The
  metastatic events start with the initiation of the reversible cell death process.
  Upon initiation of apoptosis, an acidic environment, and enhanced endocytosis initiate
  the cell fusion behavior in apoptotic cells. ARAR1 and K-Ras drive the protection
  of anti-apoptotic mRNAs (IAPs) and IRES translation. Membrane fusion initiates the
  reassembly of apoptotic blebs to form blebbishields. Blebbishield-blebbishield fusion
  results in the transformed spheroid state with multiple copies of genomes inside.
  The nuclear membrane disappears during this stage. Depending on mitochondrial dysfunction
  and ATP scarcity, the cells can enter an irreversible secondary necrotic state.
  In parallel, DAMPs (indicated by black or maroon smoky trails from apoptotic and
  secondary necrotic cells, respectively) attract immune cells to the scene promoting
  an immune cell-cancer cell hybrid (analogous to a transformed state). The hybrids
  acquire migratory capacity and use homing signals of immune cells to reach target
  organs (BMW transport) and use immune cell identity to evade the immune system to
  establish metastasis. During the transformed spheroid state, p53 is suppressed from
  expression to suppress apoptosis. The transformed spheres then reorganize their
  fusogenic lipid membranes (retracted inside from the surface) and reform the nuclear
  membrane and release individual polarized cancer cells outside the spheroid (Exit
  phase). The cells released from the transformed state can be polyploid, aneuploid,
  or diploid to augment genomic instability and heterogeneity. The exited cells may
  undergo further round of apoptosis due to reactivation of genomic checkpoints, undergo
  cell division, or undergo cell cycle arrest to augment genomic instability. DAMP
