caption: 'Transcriptional regulation of ALDH1A1.ALDH1A1 promoter can be activated
  by several molecular pathways: 1) Wnt pathway regulating ALDH1A1 through β-catenin
  and T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription; 2) Transforming growth factor β
  (TGF-β) - downregulating ALDH1A1 in Smad4-dependent manner; 3) Mucin 1-C (MUC1-C)
  inducing extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling and phosphorylating
  CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ), which leads to induction of ALDH1A1 expression.TGF-β.
  Negative regulation of ALDH1A1 by TGF-β through Smad4 binding was shown in pancreatic
  adenocarcinoma cells. Suppression of Smad4 by specific si-RNA upregulated the expression
  of ALDH1A1, and overexpression of Smad4 downregulated it, leading to the decrease
  of the ALDH+ population and their tumour-initiating activity .Wnt/ β- catenin. Suppression
  of β-catenin through specific siRNA resulted in a reduction of the ALDH+ cell population
  of prostate cancer progenitors. It sensitized it to radiation, proving that the
  Wnt pathway directly regulates ALDH1A1 through β-catenin/TCF dependent transcription
  . Following study of ALDH+ cervical cancer cells revealed that ALDH expression could
  be triggered by β-catenin through a Wnt/Frizzled-independent mechanism, and this
  effect is downstream of AKT activity. Pharmacological inhibition of AKT reduced
  the active form of the β-catenin and inactive form of GSK3 in ALDH+ cells and reduced
  ALDH protein level and activity .Mucin 1. In breast cancers, MUC1-C induced ERK-mediated
  phosphorylation and activation of the C/EBPβ transcription factor, forming the complex
  on the ALDH1A1 promoter and activating it. .Long ncRNA. The effect of DANCR is described
  in .Abbreviations: C/EBPβ - CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β, ERK - extracellular
