caption: Therapeutic interventions to improve ER function and/or prevent cell death.
  Potential strategies to improve protein folding in the ER and/or prevent cell death
  are depicted. Small molecule chemical chaperones may improve polypeptide folding
  and prevent chronic, irresolvable ER stress (). As the proapoptotic transcription
  factor CHOP plays a causal role in ER stress-induced death, strategies to interfere
  with CHOP induction or function may prevent β-cell failure (). Because there is
  a close relationship between oxidative stress and ER stress, antioxidant therapy
  () may increase insulin mRNA expression and translation, as well as improve proinsulin
  folding to restore GSIS. Finally, JNK activation is a component of the cell death
  response to both oxidative, and ER stress and inhibition of this death signal may
  prevent β-cell death (). It is possible that the reduction of one or more death
  signals would be sufficient to halt progression to cell death and allow the adaptive
  functions of the UPR and antioxidant protective mechanisms to preserve productive
  protein folding within the ER.
