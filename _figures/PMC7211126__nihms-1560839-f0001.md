caption: A large group of genes associated with familial and sporadic PD are strongly
  linked to macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, mitophagy, and downstream
  lysosomal function. Macroautophagy, the main route of cellular degradation, is initiated
  from an isolated membrane (phagophore) forming the double membraned autophagosome
  to sequester cytosolic material. Subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes
  forms the autolysosome for hydrolase-mediated degradation of its contents. In chaperone-mediated
  autophagy, the cytosolic chaperone protein HSC70 targets and translocates unfolded
  proteins directly to lysosomes through binding to the lysosomal receptor LAMP2A.
  Compared to non-selective/bulk macroautophagy, selective mitophagy labels only damaged
  mitochondria for downstream autophagic degradation. See text for more detailed description
  of PD gene-mediated effects on various types and steps of the autophagic-lysosomal
  pathway.
