caption: Pathways involved in the IRE treatment of pancreatic cancer. Released antigen
  after IRE treatment activates CTL and induces IFNγ expression. Binding IFNγ to IFNR
  recruit and phosphorylate JAK1, and JAK2 activates STAT1 by phosphorylation results
  in translocation of STAT1 into the nucleus. In the nucleus STAT1 binds to the GAS
  site and starts the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs not
  only encode cytokines and chemokines, but also phagocytic receptors and antigen-presenting
  molecules. IFNγ also induces PD-L1 expression by tumor cells through the JAK/STAT
  pathway. TLR9 agonists promote antitumor immunity through NK-κB signaling.
