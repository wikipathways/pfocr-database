caption: Metabolic changes in the gut during SIV infection increase vulnerability
  to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Representative networks of metabolites in key pathways
  are highlighted. SIV induced metabolic changes within inflamed gut directly impact
  on SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and receptor binding through modulations of linoleic acid
  and tryptophan transporter-B0AT1. Metabolic pathway of mitochondrial beta oxidation
  of short chain saturated fatty acids is altered in SIV inflamed gut, leading to
  mitochondrial malfunction. Tryptophan metabolism is modulated to impair T cell immunity,
  and dysregulated urea cycle of arginine and proline metabolism leads to intestinal
  inflammatory stress.
