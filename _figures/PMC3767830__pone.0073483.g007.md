caption: Proline can either be taken up into the cells from the environment by Put4
  , or generated in the cell by the conversion of P5C by Pro3. Proline in the cytosol
  induces the expression of Put3 , which activates the transcription of Prodh and
  P5Cdh. Prodh and P5Cdh translocate into the mitochondria where to catalyze glutamate
  biogenesis; glutamate can be converted to proline via P5C when it is transported
  to the cytosol. The conversion of glutamate to P5C can be catalyzed by Pro1 and
  Pro2 , and P5C can then be converted to proline by P5C reductase Pro3 . If the intracellular
  glutamate levels are insufficient for proline synthesis, proline biogenesis can
  be initiated from arginine, as catalyzed by Car1 (arginase), to yield ornithine;
  ornithine is then converted to P5C by Car2 . In this network, P5C and glutamate
  appear to be vitally important for both virulence and sporulation. By suppressing
  Prodh and P5Cdh expression, the hypovirus blocks the biogenesis of P5C and glutamate
  in mitochondria, resulting in hypovirulence and suppressed sporulation. Although
  Pro1 and Pro2 do not appear to be regulated by the hypovirus at the transcriptional
  level, the possibility that they might be regulated at the protein level can not
  be ruled out, as hypovirus-encoded proteins have been detected in mitochondria .
