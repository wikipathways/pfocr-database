caption: Tumor cells produce pro-angiogenic agents including VEGF, bFGF and TGF-α
  by the signaling pathways such as Hh pathway (19) as well as their intermediates
  including oncoproteins such as COX-2 and osteopontin (25, 26). These factors signal
  and activate endothelial cells that produce proteases such as MMPs that facilitate
  invasive properties of the tumor cells. Bevacizumab binds to and squelches the availability
  of VEGF. Cetuximab and Panitumumab inhibit the activities of VEGF receptor (). Tumor
  cells themselves are negatively impacted by Trastuzumab that deprives the effects
  of HER-2. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Erlotinib, Sorafenib
  and Sunitinib block the activity of multiple growth factor receptors () including
  VEGF receptors, PDGF-receptors, RET and Raf-1. Rapamycin targets mTOR. The exact
  molecular targets of other agents including thalidomide and Bortezomib are not fully
  understood.
