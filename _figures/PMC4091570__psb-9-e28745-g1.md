caption: Figure 1. Working model displaying the interaction of transcription factors
  in regulation of the flavonol pathway genes (FPGs). The suppressive effect of flg22-induced
  signaling (MTI) on UV-B-activated FPG expression may be mediated by WRKY TFs via
  downregulating the positive regulator MYB12 and/or upregulating the negative regulator
  MYB4. The two MYB TFs are good candidates to recruit HAT or HDAC activity, respectively,
  thereby being responsible for changes in H3K9 acetylation at the FPG loci.
