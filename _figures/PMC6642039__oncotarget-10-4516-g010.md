caption: Compound 19 concurrently inhibits STAT3 and NF-κB transcription factors in
  colorectal cancer. Both STAT3 and NF-κB transcriptionally activate self-renewal
  genes and telomerase that resulted in enhanced stemness. Compound 19 also arrested
  cell cycle and induced apoptosis in the caspase-3 activated pathway. Our model suggests
  that a novel curcumin analog efficiently inhibits cancer stemness by deactivating
  STAT3 and NF-κB, and consequently decreasing telomerase activity and downregulating
  self-renewal gene expressions.
