caption: Molecular regulations of phytohormone- and wound-induced somatic cell reprogramming
  in plants. The phytohormone-directed cell reprogramming occurs with the reactivation
  of lowly differentiated pericycle or pericycle-like cells within organs (red), during
  which high concentration of auxin triggers the formation of pluripotent callus with
  root meristematic property through a IAA14–ARF7/19–LBDs rooting signaling module
  synergistic with WOX11–LBD16 and PLT3/5/7 pathways, and some epigenetic regulators,
  such as ATXR2, JMJ30, HAG1, and PKL/PcG participate in this regulation by modification
  of key molecular components. By contrast, the wound-induced cell dedifferentiation
  occurs in multiple somatic cells at wound sites (purple), during which wound-induced
  JA signaling and ERF115–WIND1–ESR1 pathway are mainly responsible for early dedifferentiation
  events. Meanwhile, wound-activating cytokinin signaling and wound-induced auxin
  accumulation by JA–ERF109–ASA1 module may act synergistically to confer the pluripotency
  to wound-induced callus cells
