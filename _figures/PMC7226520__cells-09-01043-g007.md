caption: Comparative downstream pathway analysis of the effect of the adipocytokine
  pathway in breast cancer using the SEanalysis web tool [,] for super enhancer associated
  regulatory analysis. STAT3 was used as a search query for downstream pathway analysis
  of mammary gland cancers, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468, the adipocytokine signaling pathway
  was enriched in the mammary gland tissue analysis.
