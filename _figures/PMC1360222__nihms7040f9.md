caption: In the current study, we have demonstrated that TGF-β1 induces rapid activation
  of p38 MAPK followed by a more delayed activation of the PKB/Akt pathway in lung
  mesenchymal cells/fibroblasts. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is mediated by
  p38 MAPK-dependent production of a putative growth factor(s) that functions in an
  autocrine/paracrine manner. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is sufficient to
  confer a pro-survival/apoptosis-resistant phenotype to human mesenchymal cells/fibroblasts.
