caption: The structure of the EP4 receptor and its activation of signaling modules.
  The 488 amino acid sequence of the human EP4 receptor is displayed with color code
  indicating the single residues conserved in all EPs, the binding sites for the native
  ligand PGE2, regions responsible for desensitization and for interaction with EPRAP.
  Binding of an agonist induces Gαs-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase (AC),
  formation of cAMP and either activation of Epac (exchange factor activated by cAMP),
  activation of the PKA-independent AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or activation
  of PKA and eNOS, or alternatively the transcription factor CREB (cAMP-responsive
  element-binding protein). Additionally, cAMP can act through inducible cAMP early
  repressor (ICER). EP4 receptor activation has been found to reduce retinoic acid
  secretion by ICER-mediated blockade of the expression of retinoic acid dehydrogenase
  These signals finally mediate vascular relaxation, angiogenesis and protection against
  cerebral ischemic injury. EP4 receptor becomes rapidly desensitized upon binding
  of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) to serine residues on the C-terminus.
  These residues are phosphorylated and attract β-arrestin initiating receptor internalization,
  and c-Src which leads to transactivation of EGFR and further activation of PI3K/ERK/Akt
  kinases. Alternatively, Pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi can be activated which also
  may induce the activation of PI3K/ERK pathway. These latter signaling pathways enable
  migration and metastasis of colorectal carcinoma and inhibit the activation of eosinophils
  in allergic inflammation. The extended C-terminus of EP4 receptor allows interaction
  with EPRAP which in turn stabilizes the p105 subunit that prevents the activation
  of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK/ERK1/2), and inhibits transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  in activated macrophages.
