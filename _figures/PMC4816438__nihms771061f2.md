caption: 'Succinate and αKG accumulation and signaling via GPR91 and GPR99 in response
  to cell or mitochondrial stress. An accelerated citric acid (TCA) cycle leads to
  significant succinate and αKG accumulation in the mitochondria and to the backleak
  of succinate and αKG into the cytosol and local interstitium via dicarboxylate carriers
  and organic anion transporters for both the mitochondrial and plasma membranes.
  GPR91 and GPR99 activation is linked to Gi/o- and Gq-mediated intracellular signaling
  pathways that involve, for example, IP3 and Ca2+, cAMP, and mitogen-activated protein
  kinases p38 and ERK1/2. Such activation may be involved in the cell stress response
  to hypoxia (parallel to and independent of the classic HIF pathway) and various
  metabolic stimuli. However, the overactivation of these normally protective signaling
  pathways may lead to the development of pathology. Abbreviations: αKG, α-ketoglutarate;
  EPO, erythropoietin; GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor;
  IP3, inositol trisphosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor. Adapted with permission from Peti-Peterdi ().'
