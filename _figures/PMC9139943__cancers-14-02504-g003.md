caption: 'Dysfunction of DDR or PARPis induce the cGAS-STING pathway to activate cytosolic
  immunity. While some DDR dysfunction leads to increased tumor mutation burden (TMB)
  or tumor neoantigen burden (TNB), which enhances tumor antigenicity, other DDR dysfunction,
  such as via PARPis, causes stalled replication forks, triggering ATR/CHK1 activation
  leading to upregulated PD-L1, and replication stress responses inducing fork degradation
  via several nucleases, including MRE11, EXO1, and MUS81, result in the generation
  of cytosolic nuclear acids (cNAs). Fork collapse by the above nucleases induces
  genetic instability and generates micronuclei, which rupture and become cNAs. These
  cNAs are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) as part of the innate
  immune response, triggering cGAS-STING signaling to increase cytosolic immunity.
  These acronyms are defined as follows: ALR, AIM2-like receptors; ATR, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated
  protein kinase; cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; CHK1, checkpoint kinase 1; DDR, DNA
  damage response; DSB, double strand break; FEN1, flap endonuclease 1; HR, homologous
  recombination; MMR, mismatch repair deficiency; PD-L1, programmed cell death ligand-1;
  RLR, RIG1-like receptors; RPA, replication protein A; SSB, single strand break;
  TLR, Toll-like receptors; NLR, NOD-like receptors; STING, stimulator of interferon
  genes; XRCC1, X-ray repair cross-complementing 1.'
