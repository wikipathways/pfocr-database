caption: The binding of leptin to the long isoform of leptin receptor (LepRb) results
  in its dimerization, leading to the formation of the LepRb/Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)
  complex. The activated JAK2 phosphorylates itself and also Tyr985, Tyr1077, and
  Tyr1138 in LepRb. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and
  STAT5 bind to phospho-Tyr1138 and phospho-Tyr1077 in LepRb and are subsequently
  phosphorylated. Active STAT3 and STAT5 dimers then translocate to the nucleus and
  activate the transcription of their target genes, which mediate leptin's anorexigenic
  effect. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a target gene of STAT3, inhibits
  the JAK2/STAT3 pathway by interacting with phospho-Tyr985 or JAK2 and acting as
  a feedback inhibitor of leptin signaling. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B)
  also inhibits leptin signaling through dephosphorylation of JAK2. After JAK2 activation,
  SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) binds to phospho-Tyr985 in
  the LepRb and recruits the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein
  2 (Grb2), leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
  cascade. Leptin activates MAPK independent of SHP2 and also regulates phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase (PI3K) signaling through insulin receptor substrate (IRS) phosphorylation.
  Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and phosphodiesterase
  3B (PDE3B) are important downstream targets of PI3K in the leptin signaling pathway.
  Leptin regulates feeding and metabolism through 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in the brain and peripheral
  organs.
