caption: Proposed scenario of the altered mechanisms driven by HFD/IPA treatment.
  According to our data, nutrient overload results in defective insulin signaling
  both in HFD mice and IPA-treated SHSY-5Y cells, which translate into reduced glycolytic
  and mitochondrial metabolism. In turn, mitochondrial defects are responsible for
  impaired bioenergetic and increased ADP/ATP ratios that activate AMPK, a key GFAT1
  inhibitor, leading to the reduced entrance of nutrients into the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP). GFAT1 inhibition, together with insulin resistance-driven nutrient
  deprivation, is responsible for the impairment of the HBP flux and the consequent
  reduction of the overall levels of O-GlcNAcylated proteins. The disruption of O-GlcNAc
  homeostasis is associated with altered OGT PTMs that could further exacerbate the
  efficiency of O-GlcNAc cycling. In addition, the reduction of Complex I-specific
  O-GlcNAcylation may represent a key aspect involved in exacerbating the alterations
  mitochondrial energetic profile.
