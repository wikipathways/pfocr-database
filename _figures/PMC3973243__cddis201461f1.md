caption: Bcl-2 protein family in apoptosis and hematologic malignancies. Mitochondria
  represent a cellular regulatory node in apoptosis induced by death cues (e.g. DNA
  damage) or by the deprivation of survival signals (e.g. emitted by antigen receptor).
  The pro-apoptotic activity of mitochondria involves the mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization (MOMP), which is tightly regulated by anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
  protein family members. This is in turn is controlled by BH3-only proteins that
  initiate MOMP by either direct binding to the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members or by
  antagonizing their anti-apoptotic counterparts. Upon MOMP cytochrome c is released
  from the mitochondrial intermembrane space and initiates proteolytic activation
  of caspases, culminating in apoptotic cell death. Imbalanced expression of Bcl-2-family
  members has been readily associated with the development of hematologic malignancies
  such as lymphoma, leukemia or myeloma as summarized. PCL, plasma cell leukemia.
  Astrisks indicate the association of the Bcl-2 protein family members (gain- or
  loss-of-function) in chemosusceptibility (green) and/or malignant transformation
  of lymphoid malignancies (red or blue)
