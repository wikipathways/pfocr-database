caption: Class I BRAF mutants can signal as monomers, independent of RAS activation.
  They lead to high ERK activation, which causes negative feedback inhibition of upstream
  signaling. RAS-GTP levels are therefore low in tumors with class I BRAF mutants.
  Class II BRAF mutants signal as RAS independent, mutant-mutant BRAF dimers. They
  strongly activate ERK, causing negative feedback inhibition of upstream signaling
  and low levels of RAS-GTP. Class III BRAF mutants exhibit enhanced binding to RAS
  and CRAF to signal as mutant BRAF-wild-type CRAF dimers. They amplify the signaling
  downstream of RAS and thus require upstream activation to increase ERK signaling,
  either through genomic alterations (RAS mutations or NF1 loss, as shown on the left)
  or receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling (as shown on the right). Tumors with
  these mutations therefore exhibit high RAS-GTP levels.
