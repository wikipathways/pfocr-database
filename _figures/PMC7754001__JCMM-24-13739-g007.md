caption: Schematic diagram for the signalling pathways related to the EMT and airway
  remodelling in response to TGF‐β1. TGF‐β1 binds to its ligands, a heterotetrameric
  receptor complex of two type I (TGF‐βRI) and type II receptors (TGF‐βRII), which
  then actives Smad family members, followed by trans‐locating into the nucleus to
  modulate target genes. This is often termed as canonical Smad signalling pathway.
  TGF‐β1 also activates Smad‐independent signalling pathways, such as p38 MAPK, JNK,
  ERK1/2 and PI3K/ AKT/mTOR. DEK may induce expression of TGF‐β1, which are secreted
  into the extracellular to amplify TGF‐β1 activity by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms
