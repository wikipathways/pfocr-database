caption: Mechanism of endorepellin dual receptor antagonism and block of angiogenesis.
  LG domains 1 and 2 of endorepellin bind to VEGFR2 between Ig domains 3-5, distal
  to the known binding site of VEGFA (between Ig1-3). The interaction between endorepellin
  and VEGFR2 inhibits activation of VEGFR2 by VEGFA as verified experimentally through
  Tyr1175 phosphorylation. Downstream results of this inhibition include blockage
  of endothelial cell migration and transcription of VEGFA, both of which contribute
  to angiostasis. The effects of the LG3 domain of endorepellin also contribute to
  anti-angiogenic signaling in this pathway through direct binding to α2β1 integrin.
  Anti-angiogenic signaling of LG3 involves the activation of SHP-1, which targets
  Tyr1175 of VEGFR2, as well as downstream collapse of the actin cytoskeleton through
  previously identified intracellular regulators. An additional contribution to angiostasis
  is the endorepellin-evoked dual receptor internalization and degradation via a caveosome-mediated
  pathway.
