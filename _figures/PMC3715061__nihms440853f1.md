caption: Hedgehog signaling, vismodegib action, and acquired resistance. The Hedgehog
  pathway is normally regulated through a cascade of primarily inhibitory signals.
  Any of 3 mammalian Hedgehog (Hh) ligands (Sonic, Indian, or Desert Hedgehog) bind
  to cell surface PTCH1. Ligand binding to PTCH1 relieves PTCH1 inhibition of the
  critical activator of Hedgehog signaling, SMO. PTCH1 deficiency, found in the majority
  of BCC and about 30% of medulloblastoma, is associated with constitutive, ligand-independent
  activation of SMO. In mammalian cells, derepression of SMO is associated with its
  translocation from internal vesicles to the cell membrane cilium (not shown). Active
  SMO signals downstream through an intermediary Sufu, promoting the release of Gli
  family transcription factors, which can then translocate to the nucleus to affect
  gene transcription. There are multiple Gli proteins whose functions are somewhat
  cell type dependent; in general, Gli2 seems to be a particularly strong activator
  of downstream gene transcription (along with Gli1), while Gli3 is inhibitory in
  most contexts. Pathway activation and release from Sufu can lead to proteosomal
  degradation of Gli3 and to preferential nuclear translocation of Gli1 and Gli2,
  which activate transcription of multiple target genes, including key regulators
  of the Hedgehog pathway, notably Gli1 and PTCH1. Vismodegib binds to the extracellular
  domain of SMO, markedly inhibiting downstream signaling, even in the absence of
  PTCH1. The first documented mechanism of clinical acquired resistance to vismodegib
  is a secondary mutation in the extracellular domain of SMO, D473H (indicated in
  the inset as a red circle), which prevents vismodegib binding.
