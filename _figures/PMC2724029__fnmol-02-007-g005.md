caption: Signaling networks upregulated in migrating neuroblasts. (A) Growth factor
  signaling network. (B) and (C) MAPK signaling network. (C) is simplified version
  of (B). Networks were identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and subsequently
  modified using Bibliosphere, PathwayArchitect, GO and pathway databases. The intensity
  of the red color indicates the extent of gene upregulation. Connecting lines with
  arrowheads indicate activation of proteins, without arrowheads protein–protein interaction.
  Continuous and dashed lines are direct and indirect activation/interaction, respectively.
  For node description see Figure .
