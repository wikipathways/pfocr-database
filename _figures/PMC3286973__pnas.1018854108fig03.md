caption: Pathway diagrams can be used to predict response to therapies. (A) (Left)
  Basal breast cancer cell lines respond preferentially to the DNA-damaging agent
  cisplatin. Each boxplot represents the distribution of drug response data for basal
  (right) and non-basal (left) cell lines. (Right) Basal cell lines show enhanced
  pathway levels in a subnetwork associated with the DNA-damage response, providing
  a possible mechanism by which cisplatin acts in these cell lines. (B) (Left) ERBB2AMP
  cell lines are sensitive to the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin. (Right) The ERBB2–HSP90
  network is up-regulated in ERBBP2AMP cell lines. Conventions are as in . BCL6, B-cell
  CLL/lymphoma 6; CASP1, caspase 1, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase (interleukin
  1, beta, convertase); CASP6, caspase 6, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase; CHEK2,
  CHK2 checkpoint homolog (S. pombe); DOCK7, dedicator of cytokinesis 7; ERBB3, v-erb-b2
  erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (avian); ERBB4, v-erb-a erythroblastic
  leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4 (avian); EREG, epiregulin; FAS, Fas (TNF receptor
  superfamily, member 6); GADD45A, growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, alpha;
  NRG1B, neuregulin 1; NRG2, neuregulin 2; PLK3, polo-like kinase 3; TP53, tumor protein
  p53; TP63, tumor protein p63.
