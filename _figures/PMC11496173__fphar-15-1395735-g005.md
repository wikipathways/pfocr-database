caption: Probable mechanism of action of ISL on the Nrf2 pathway. ISL alleviated oxidative
  stress, cell apoptosis and inflammation via activating the AMPK/Nrf2 antioxidant
  signal pathway and inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NF-κB pathway.
  The inhibitory effect of ISL on NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB pathway may be through
  both Nrf2 and non-Nrf2-independent signaling events. ISL also phosphorylates MAPKs
  and upregulates the Keap1, which induces the separation of Nrf2 from Keap1, activation
  of Nrf2 signaling, and enhancement of detoxification phase II enzymes activity.
  ISL activates SIRT1 to promote the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway. Moreover,
  ISL also increase its antioxidant ability and decrease in inflammatory, cell apoptosis
  through activating the PGC-1α/Nrf2 pathway. Besides, ISL also can inhibit GSK-3β
  activity by phosphorylation to enhance the Nrf2 related antioxidant gene expression
  and inhibit the NF-κB induced inflammatory gene. (↑) represent positive effect while
  (⊥) represent negative effect on the pathway
