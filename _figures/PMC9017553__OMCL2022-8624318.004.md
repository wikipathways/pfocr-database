caption: Relevant targets during ischemia-reperfusion in renal tissue. The main ways
  to decrease renal oxidative damage during I-R are (1) activation of phospholipid
  proteases, (2) the increment of antioxidant enzyme complex reducing free radicals
  and blocking lipoperoxidation, (3) modulation of Ca2+ and ROS mitochondrial release
  as well as controlling oxidative phosphorylation, (4) PRMT5 protein arginine methylation
  transferase is a regulation mechanism to stop ferroptosis, and (5) the membrane
  receptor Pannexin 1 through that blockaded ROS pyroptosis through Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
  pathway.
