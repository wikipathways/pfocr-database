caption: Sulfur metabolic network. Three major branches of the sulfur metabolic network
  have been defined. First, sulfate is transported into cells via the sulfate permeases
  (SUL1 and SUL2) and is reduced to sulfide (MET3, MET14, MET16, MET5, and MET10).
  Second, sulfide is incorporated in the formation of homocysteine (MET17) from O-acetylhomoserine
  that is derived from homoserine (MET2). Third, homocysteine is converted to methionine
  and SAM in the methyl cycle (MET6, SAM1, SAM2, SAH1) or converted to cysteine in
  the two steps of the trans-sulfuration pathway (CYS4 and CYS3). Glutathione is synthesized
  from cysteine (GSH1, GSH2). The sulfur-containing compounds are written in black.
  The levels of cysteine negatively control the activity of Met4-dependent transcription.
  The genes under positive control by Met4 are indicated in green.
