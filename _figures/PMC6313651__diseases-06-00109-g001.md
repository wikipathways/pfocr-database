caption: 'Summary of five hypothetical pathways of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) in
  promoting colorectal carcinogenesis: (i) FadA in Fn promotes chronic Fn infection
  of colon mucosa that triggers reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proinflammtory mediators;
  (ii) Fad2 activates β- catenin signaling that, through the Wnt signaling pathway,
  results in increased miRNA and NF-κB, and ultimately increases tumor proliferation;
  (iii) Fap2 interacts with TIGIT on natural killer (NK) and T cells to suppress immune
  response and promote tumor growth; (iv) Fn through Fap2 may recruit tumor-infiltrating
  myeloid cells; (v) Fn in conjunction with other microbiota may affect the production
  of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands. AhR mediates the transcription of cytokines
  that regulate immune response and immune-response inhibition promotes tumor growth.'
