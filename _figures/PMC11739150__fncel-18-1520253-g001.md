caption: 'Structures of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system. Insulin,
  IGF1, and IGF2 and their relatively high-affinity receptors, insulin receptor, IGF1
  receptor, and IGF2 receptor, are shown. The relative affinity of each ligand for
  the receptors is represented by the arrow thickness. Insulin, IGF1, and IGF2 can
  cross-bind to their respective high-affinity receptors; however, due to its lower
  affinity, insulin does not seem to bind to the IGF2 receptor. Upon receptor binding,
  a structural change leads to activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain
  and autophosphorylation. Two main signaling pathways are activated: the Akt/PKB
  and the Ras/MAPK pathways. Thus, IGF2 activates CREB and induces IGF2 transcription,
  increases synaptic density and spine maturation, activates the AKT-GSK3β signaling
  pathway, promotes neural precursor cell differentiation and proliferation, and induces
  IGF2 production in the hippocampus to improve memory ability. p, phosphorylation;
