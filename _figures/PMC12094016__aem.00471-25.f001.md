caption: 'Metabolic pathways for target 1-propanol and off-target ethanol in P. furiosus.
  (A) 1-propanol pathway with redox chemistry (right) and off-target ethanol pathway
  (left). Reactions in green are sourced from M. sedula (Msed). Reactions in blue
  are sourced from Thermanaerobacter X514 (TX514). The metabolic pathway for 1-propanol
  production includes the following enzymes: E1 (acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase),
  E2 (malonyl-CoA/succinyl-CoA reductase), E3 (malonate semialdehyde reductase), E4
  (3-hydroxypropionate-CoA ligase), E5 (3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase), E6 (acryloyl-CoA
  reductase), ACSII (acetyl-CoA synthase), AOR (aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase),
  and AdhA (alcohol dehydrogenase). A branching pathway that leads to ethanol production
  is also shown, including ACS, AOR, and AdhA. (B) Constructs used in this study to
  express heterologous enzymes. Constructs are designed for chromosomal insertion
  into GR3 (top) and GR1 (bottom)'
