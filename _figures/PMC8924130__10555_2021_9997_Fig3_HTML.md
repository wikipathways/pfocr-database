caption: 'Hypoxic glioblastoma tumor microenvironment and molecular interactions.
  A hypoxic tumor microenvironment TME influences molecular biological processes in
  the glioma cell on several levels. Methylation of the MGMT, VEGF, and p53-protein
  are activated, which reduces the effect of alkylating agents and promotes angiogenesis.
  p53 is also the central regulator of p21 and CDK4/D1, which reduce microglia recruitment.
  A malfunction of p53 leads to increased glycoprotein concentration in the TME, which
  supports cell migration and immune evasion, and immunosuppression (details in the
  text). Abbreviations: BRAF, proto-oncogene B-Raf; CD133, CD133–prominin 1, PROM1,
