caption: 'DNA repair pathways involved in CRISPR/Cas-induced DNA double-strand break
  repair. A: classical nonhomologous end joining (c-NHEJ) is a Ku-dependent DNA repair
  pathway that is active throughout the cell cycle. In the absence of a donor template,
  c-NHEJ generates insertions or deletions (INDELs; shown in red) in the genome. B:
  when a DNA double-strand break (DSB) is induced in the S or G2 phase of the cell
  cycle, homology-directed repair (HDR) can be triggered if a donor template is present
  (magenta), leading to precise repair of the genome. C: a Ku-independent microhomology-mediated
  end joining (MMEJ) pathway can be used for DNA DSB repair if the DNA breakage site
  shares sequence homology. MMEJ-mediated repair generates INDELs in the genome (red).'
