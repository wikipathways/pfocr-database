caption: Approaches to targeting splicing factor mutations in splicing factor-mutant
  myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myeloid leukemia. Cells harboring splicing factor
  mutations have increased R loops and dysregulation of innate immune and inflammatory
  pathways. The elevated R-loop formation results in activation of the ATR signaling
  pathway and DNA-damage response. Leukemic cells harboring splicing factor mutations
  preferentially respond to ATR/CHK1/WEE1 inhibition and immune targeting agents (Inflammasome,
  Cytokines). In addition, cells with splicing factor mutations are more sensitive
  to splicing modulators that selectively inhibit SF3B1, RBM39, and arginine methyltransferase
  (PRMT) activity.
