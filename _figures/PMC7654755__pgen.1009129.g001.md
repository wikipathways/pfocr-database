caption: The KP is the major route of tryptophan (TRP) degradation in mammals, with
  >95% of the essential amino acid degraded through the pathway. TRP is metabolised
  by IDO1/2 or TDO2 to produce L-kynurenine (L-KYN). L-KYN is metabolised through
  two distinct branches of the pathway; by kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs) to
  produce kynurenine acid (KYNA) or by KMO to produce 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK),
  3-hydroxyanthranillic acid (3-HANA), quinolinic acid (QUIN) and ultimately nicotinamide
  adenosine dinucleotide (NAD+). Genes encoding enzymes in Drosophila are in red text.
  Flies lack homologues for 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAO) and quinolinic acid
  phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), so the pathway is uncoupled from NAD+synthesis
  in flies. 3-HK is converted into the brown ommochrome pigment xanthommatin by phenoxazinone
  synthetase (cardinal) in Drosophila.
