caption: Metabolic engineering methods can be used to improve the production of citric
  acid, which is produced in mitochondria. Enzymes indicated by bold arrows may be
  increased or altered to boost metabolic flux. The rTCA pathway is represented by
  the yellow bold arrow, while the PFK can be modified to alleviate feedback inhibition
  as shown by the green bold arrow. Dotted arrows indicate transmembrane transport.
