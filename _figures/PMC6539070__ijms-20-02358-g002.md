caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of adipogenesis. Adipogenesis can be divided into two
  phases: commitment and terminal differentiation. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)
  induces mesenchymal progenitor cells to the adipocyte lineage as part of the adipogenic
  commitment. As a result of BMP4 signaling pathways, committed preadipocytes express
  the transcriptional activator zinc-finger protein 423 (ZNF423), a fundamental determinant
  of preadipocyte cell fate. The commitment phase also requires coordinated inhibition
  of several pathways [e.g., wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site
  family (WNT) and wnt1-inducible-signalling pathway protein 2 (WISP2)]. During terminal
  differentiation phase, committed preadipocytes arrest their growth and activate
  early differentiation markers, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ
  (PPARγ) and transcription co-activators CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα).
  C/EBPα and PPARγ induce and maintain the expression of key adipogenic genes (GLUT4,
  AP2, and ADIPOQ), which are necessary for normal adipocyte function. WISP2, WNT1-inducible
  signaling pathway protein 2; DKK1, proadipogenic factors Dickkopf 1. LRP5/6, lipoprotein-receptor-related
  protein-5 or -6; GLUT4, glucose transporter type 4; AP2, adipocyte fatty acid-binding
  protein 2.'
