caption: Schematic representations of the results in this study. (HEKs) Salirasib
  inhibited Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and p53 signalling. Inhibited ERK might contribute to
  the down-regulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins. The linkage between p53 and
  MEK was observed. The inhibition of MTOR signalling in response to its upstream
  pathway promoted the conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II. However, the autophagy flux
  was inhibited by salirasib treatment. Decreased expression of the Beclin 1 and PI3KC3
  and formation of the Beclin 1-PI3KC3 complex impeded autophagy flux, in agreement
  with previous findings. Decreased Bcl-2 expression might facilitate apoptosis. (COLO-16
  cells) In cells with a p53-mutation, salirasib treatment decreased the Ras activity,
  but did not lead to the inhibition of Raf/MEK/ERK signalling. Therefore, the inconsistent
  effects on cell cycle regulatory proteins were observed. MTORC is silent in response
  to the upstream signalling. MTORC- and Beclin 1-dependent autophagy processes and
  Bcl-2-related apoptosis were not disturbed under this condition.
