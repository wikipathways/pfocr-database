caption: Trp metabolism-mediated immunosuppressive mechanisms of IDOs and TDO (created
  with biorender.com). More than 95% of free Trp is catabolized through the tryptophan-kynurenine
  (Trp-Kyn) pathway, which leads to decreased Trp levels and increased Kyn levels.
  Trp depletion results in the accumulation of uncharged Trp-tRNA and activation of
  the stress-response kinase (GCN2), thus inducing cell cycle arrest of CD8+ Teff
  cells and promoting differentiation and activity of Treg cells. Trp consumption
  restrains the activity of immune-regulatory kinases mTORC1 and PKC-θ, along with
  the activation of autophagy, which will limit T-cell function in tumor microenvironment.
  Kyn metabolites accumulation activates AHR, and then results in the generation of
  Treg cells. Meanwhile, activated AHR also promotes tumor immune tolerance by upregulating
  PD-1 expression. These mechanisms work together to form an immunosuppressive microenvironment.
