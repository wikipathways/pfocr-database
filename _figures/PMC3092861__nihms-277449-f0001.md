caption: A. eCB-mediated I-LTD mediated is triggered by postsynaptic activation of
  group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR-I), leading to the production of
  diacylglyercol (DAG) by phospholipase C (PLC). Diacylglycerol lipase (DGL) converts
  DAG to the major eCB, 2-AG, which is released from the postsynaptic cell and travels
  back across the synapse to activate type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) on the
  GABAergic terminal. CB1R activation subsequently reduces protein kinase A activity.
  Coincident interneuronal activity increases intracellular calcium via voltage-gated
  calcium channels (VGCCs) and enhances calcineurin (CaN) activity. Combined reduction
  and enhancement of PKA and CaN activity, respectively, may lower the phosphorylation
  status of an unidentified substrate in the release machinery to persistently depress
  GABA release in a Rim1α-dependent manner. B. I-LTP mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF) is initiated by intracellular calcium rise due to opening of either
  NMDARs or VGCCs, or calcium release from intracellular stores, depending on the
  synapse and brain region. Postsynaptic GABABR activation reportedly can lead to
  calcium release from stores via an unknown mechanism. BDNF acts as a retrograde
  messenger to activate TrkB receptor tyrosine kinases on the inhibitory terminal
  to potentiate GABA release through an unclear pathway. C. I-LTP mediated by nitric
  oxide (NO) is induced by intracellular calcium rise in the postsynaptic cell via
  opening of NMDARs to activate nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO readily permeates
  through the membrane and stimulates presynaptic guanylate cyclase (GC), augmenting
  cGMP levels to enhance GABA release. Mu-opioid receptors (μORs) antagonize the ability
  of NO to increase cGMP signaling. D. Glutamate (Glu) can also directly activate
  presynaptic NMDARs on the GABAergic interneuron, without the need for retrograde
  messengers. Depending on the synapse, calcium increase at the terminals can depress
  GABA release through uncharacterized mechanisms or potentiate GABA release in a
  PKA- and RIM1α-dependent manner.
