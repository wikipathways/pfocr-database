caption: Overview of pathways and compartmentation of FA supply for TAG synthesis
  in plants. Different oilseed species utilize different pathways for producing acetyl-CoA
  precursors and cofactors for FA synthesis. Not all are shown. In most oilseeds that
  accumulate large amounts of TAG, sucrose is imported into the cytosol and provides
  the ultimate source of carbohydrate for conversion to acetyl-CoA and then to oil.
  FAs are synthesized in the plastid stroma from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA by a type
  II dissociable FAS complex. Hexose phosphates from sucrose metabolism can enter
  glycolysis in the cytosol or plastid to produce pyruvate (Pyr). PDH provides the
  direct source for acetyl-CoA via a reaction that also provides enough NADH to supply
  half of the reductant needed for FA synthesis. Malonyl-CoA is formed from acetyl-CoA,
  ATP, and HCO3− by ACCase. HCO3− is equilibrated with CO2 in the plastid stroma by
  carbonic anhydrase (CA). The conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to FAs occurs
  through a series of condensation, dehydration, and reduction reactions. Three isoforms
  of ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) cooperate to elongate acyl chains on an ACP platform
  to C16 or C18. KASIII initiates FA synthesis by condensation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP,
  KASI continues elongation to C16:0, and KASII provides the final elongation step
  from C16:0 to C18:0. 18:0 ACP is desaturated by a stearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD)
  to generate 18:1 ACP, and two acyl-ACP thioesterases (FATA and FATB) release newly
  synthesized 16:0 FA, 18:0 FA, and 18:1 FA in the plastid stroma. Depending upon
  the plant species and the presence of thylakoid membranes, requisite NADPH and ATP
  for FAS can be generated by photosystems (PS). The CO2 from PDH can be recaptured
  by Rubisco, which can result in 20% higher yields of acetyl-CoA from sucrose. In
  non-green seeds, NADPH can also be generated by the oxidative pentose phosphate
  pathway (OPPP). Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) is generated from hexose phosphate
  by the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). ATP required for acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase can be produced by pyruvate kinase or imported into plastids from the
  cytosol (not shown). The products of FAS are activated to CoA by LACS in the chloroplast
  outer envelope before export to the ER for TAG synthesis. Export mechanisms are
  uncertain (dashed arrows) and may be via acyl-CoA (possibly involving acyl-CoA-binding
  proteins (ACBP)). Alternatively, after LPCAT activity at the plastid envelope, phospholipid
  (PC) may move to the ER through direct membrane contact sites (stromules or plastid-associated
  ER membranes) or by some as yet unknown mechanism. Glycerolipids are assembled in
  the ER (see details in ), and TAG emerges as lipid droplets (LD) that are stored
  in the cytosol. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Ru5P, ribulose 5-phosphate; 3PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate.
