caption: The interaction of CD200 in cancer cells and CD200 receptor in immune cells.
  CD200 preliminary engages with its CD200 receptor (CD200R), leading to the suppression
  of immune cell function and activation by inhibiting RAS signaling. CD200–CD200R
  binding induces phosphorylation of the tyrosine motif in the cytoplasmic tail of
  CD200R. The adaptor protein tyrosine kinase 2 (DOK-2) is then phosphorylated as
  a result. Subsequently, this leads to the binding of SH2-containing inositol phosphatase
  (SHIP) to DOK-2 and the recruitment of Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP). RasGAP
  inhibits the Ras–MAPK pathway by facilitating GTP hydrolysis from RasGTP to Ras
  GDP. The RAS signaling pathway further induces the transcription of proinflammatory
  cytokines. Anti-CD200 antibody or anti-CD200R antibody induces proinflammation by
  immune cells.
