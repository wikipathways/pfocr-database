caption: Schematic representation of the several mechanisms associated with Alzheimer’s
  Disease (AD) and their possible prevention by some phytochemicals. The main hallmarks
  of AD; amyloid plague and NFT are prevented by curcumin and luteolin via GSK 3β
  pathway. Curcumin, genistin, and luteolin decreases the oxidative stress in the
  neuron. Neuroinflammation is also inhibited by genistin and apigenin. The pathway
  of apoptosis, activated in AD is blocked by the use of apigenin. Apigenin also activates
  BDNF/ERK/CREB pathway leading to neuronal survival.
