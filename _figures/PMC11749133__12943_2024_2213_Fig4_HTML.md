caption: Modulation of immune responses by bufalin in cancer therapy. Basically, bufalin,
  a compound derived from the venom of the toad, inhibit ATP dependent Na+-K+ ion
  channel to induce Ca2+ overload, ulteriorly spur tumor pyroptosis. In liver cancer,
  bufalin influences the NF-κB signaling pathway by interacting with components such
  as NF-κB p50 and p65, which are crucial for the transcriptional regulation of immune
  response genes. This interaction reprograms macrophages from an M2-like phenotype,
  which promotes tumor growth, to an M1-like phenotype, which is tumoricidal. Additionally,
  bufalin enhances the recruitment and polarization of CD8 + T cells, critical effectors
  in anti-tumor immunity. Bufalin could synergize with anti-PD-1 therapy to potentiate
  the anti-cancer immune response in a preclinical model. Additionally, bufalin suppresses
  intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and colon cancer liver metastasis through CAMKK2/Wnt/β-catenin,
  and SRC-3/IL-6 signaling. In pancreatic cancer, bufalin inhibits the NOD2-driven
  NF-κB signaling to overcome chemotherapy resistance
