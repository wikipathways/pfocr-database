caption: 'Diagram summarizing RNA modification regulators in the pathogensis of BCSC,
  metastasis, EMT, glycosis and immune escape of breast caner. BCSC: Binding of AURKA
  to DROSHA transcripts induced by IGF2BP2 to enhance BCSC stemness, meanwhile DROSHA
  interacted with β-catenin to contribute to the BCSC property by activating STC1.
  ALKBH5 or ZNF21 increased Nanog and KLF4 mRNA expression by m6A methylation, which
  led to pluripotency of breast cancer under hypoxic condition. The Lnc RNA KB-1980E6.3
  facilitated BCSC self-renewal by IGF2BP1/c-Myc axis under hypoxic condition. Metastasis:YTHDF3
  enhanced translation of ST6GALNAC5, GJA1, EGFR and VEFG to promote breast cancer
  metastasis to the brain. METTL3 and FTO promoted lung metastasis of breast cancer
  by KRT7 via suppressing YTHDF1/eEf1 complex and increasing IGF2BP1/HuR complex.
  EMT: YTHDF2 induced EMT by activating MAPK pathway. KIAA1429 promoted EMT by SMC1A/SNAIL
  in breast cancer. Glysosis: C5aR1-positive neutrophils secreted IL-1β and TNFα to
  synergistically activate ERK1/2, which resulted in the stabilizing WTAP to affect
  the glycolysis of breast cancer via ENO1. Immune surveillance: METTL3 upregulate
  PD-L1 via IGF2BP3 by m6A-dependent manner to modulate immune escape and T cell exhausition
  in breast cancer.'
