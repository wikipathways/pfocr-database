caption: Scheme of bacillibactin synthesis. The bacillibactin precursors glycine and
  threonine derive from the primary metabolism. The synthesis of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate
  (DHB) and the nonribosomally catalyzed bacillibactin assembly are Fur regulated
  in the secondary metabolism. The numbers shown indicate the numbers of genes that
  were upregulated during iron starvation. The total numbers of activities involved
  in the presented pathway sections are in parentheses. reg., regulation.
