caption: Immunometabolic interplay in obesity. In obesity, immune cells and parenchymal
  cells are in crosstalk as they infiltrate metabolic tissues. Excess fatty acids
  and glucose are sensed by TLRs on macrophages and trigger an IREα response, which
  releases pro-inflammatory cytokines. Metabolic disorders are also characterized
  by the formation of foam cells, which carry a surplus of cholesterol esters and
  other lipids. Cytokines produced by the immune cells are sensed by parenchymal cells
  and trigger the activation of stress kinases such as JNK, which are directly linked
  to insulin resistance. IREα in parenchymal cells is also activated by cytokines
  and leads to transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators. The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway
  is triggered by HFD and enhances inflammatory responses via NF-κB.
