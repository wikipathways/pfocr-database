caption: The putative involvement of GsCYP630B18 is indicated by grey arrows. Triglycerides
  from the host plant in the lipoprotein are broken down to free fatty acids (FFA)
  and glycerol by the action of the lipoprotein lipase (LpL) []. Glycerol is further
  phosphorylated by glycerol kinase (GK) [, ] and enters glycolysis. On the cytosolic
  site, FFAs are activated and coupled to coenzyme A (CoA) by the catalysis of long-chain
  fatty acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs) [] or by different fatty acid transporter proteins
  (FATPs) []. The transfer through the plasma membrane occurs by a protein-mediated
  mechanism. In the cell, FFAs can act at different sub-cellular localizations and
  have functions in energy generation and storage, membrane synthesis, protein modification,
  and activation of nuclear transcription factors []. Oxidation of FFA in fungi occurs
  mainly through β-oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix or peroxisomes, or through
  the ω-oxidation pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. Several acyl-CoA ligases (ACLs)
  [], involved in fatty acid metabolism, then attach CoA to the ends of fatty acids
  to form fatty-acyl-CoA. Fatty-acyl-CoA can pass through the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, but requires carnitine acetyl transferase (CT) [] to cross the inner membrane.
  The multifunctional β-oxidation enzyme FOX2[, ] was induced in Gs mycelia grown
  on fatty acids, indicating possible peroxisomal oxidation. In ω-oxidation, the hydroxylase
  reaction is catalyzed by CYP630 (red bubble) and its redox partner CPR 2. Dicarboxylic
  acids are then subject to further β-oxidation. Gene IDs and respective changes in
  transcript abundance in Gs grown on fatty acids are given in  [, ].
