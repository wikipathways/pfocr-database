caption: Role for PI3Kγ signaling in core symptoms of ADHDPI3Kγ is abundant in noradrenergic
  neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), which constitute the main source of noradrenaline
  in the brain. PI3Kγ gene KO in the mouse leads to increased CREB activation via
  elevation of cAMP levels in the LC and alters the dopamine/noradrenaline (DA/NA)
  balance in projection areas (prefrontal cortex and striatum). Those modifications
  facilitate the development of core ADHD-related phenotypes, including hyperactivity
  and attention deficits, as well as secondary features such as memory and social
  impairments. Overexpression of CREB in the LC of normal animals produces similar
  behavioral changes, and down-regulation of CREB activity in the LC of mutant mice
  reverses the phenotype.
