caption: 'Nimesulide in PANC−1 cells. Nimesulide inhibits proliferation and promotes
  apoptosis of PANC-1 cells (cell line isolated from a ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma)
  via increased expression of PTEN. AKT regulates a series of important effector proteins,
  such as NFkB, COX-2, VEGF, Bcl-2, and Bax. Nimesulide inhibits angiogenesis by inducing
  an increase in PTEN levels and leading to suppression of AKT by decreasing VEGF
  levels. PTEN reactivation appears to be related to a decreased expression of COX-2
  and also acts by suppressing AKT and consequently inhibiting NF-kB, which decreases
  the expression of COX-2. From: Author.'
