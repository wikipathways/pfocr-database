caption: Schematic representation of the crosstalk between sucrose and hormone signaling
  pathways in the regulation of the expression of early (EBG) and late (LBG) anthocyanin
  biosynthesis genes through the activation of the MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) transcription
  complex and down-regulation of MYBL2 expression. The point(s) of convergence of
  the photosynthetic electron transport (PET) dependent light, sucrose, CK, and ethylene
  signaling pathways leading to transcriptional regulation of the MBW complex remain
  elusive. DELLA-independent GA regulation of PAP1 expression is not shown. The HY5-mediated
  light signaling pathway directly regulates the expression of EBGs and LBGs at the
  transcriptional level. Blue and red lines pointing to anthocyanin biosynthesis genes
  (EBGs and LBGs) and MBW complex represent transcriptional and translational control,
  respectively.
