caption: Schematic diagram for the activation of NF-κB pathway by high glucose. High
  glucose is absorbed by SCAPs mainly by glucose transporters (GLUT). High glucose
  can induce the phosphorylation of IkBα in the cytoplasm, which subsequently leads
  to the rapid hydrolysis of IkBα. P65 is then phosphorylated and transported into
  nuclei, which finally causes the activation of NF-κB pathway and odonto/osteogenic
  differentiation of stem cells.
