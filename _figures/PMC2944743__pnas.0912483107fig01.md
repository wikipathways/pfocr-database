caption: Qualitative model of the SRM, showing the glucose induction pathway (green
  lines) and the glucose repression pathway (red lines). Colored ovals indicate which
  pathways regulate transcription of the mRNA for each protein (green, induction;
  red, repression; black, neither one). Each gene is color coded for the pathway in
  which its product serves. Three of the repression relationships marked with an asterisk
  (Mig1 on HXT3 and MIG2 and Rgt1 on MTH1) were revealed as a result of the experiments
  described here.
