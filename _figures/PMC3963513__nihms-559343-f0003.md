caption: Reconfiguration of a signaling network upon drug treatment. (a) Triple-negative
  breast cancer cells show enhanced activity of RAF-MEK-ERK. In the naive cells, c-Myc,
  a transcriptional repressor of multiple RTKs, is protected from proteasomal degradation
  by ERK-mediated phosphorylation. (b) Upon treatment with a MEK inhibitor (shown
  by X), ERK activity is reduced, resulting in decreased proliferation. ERK-mediated
  c-Myc phosphorylation also decreases, causing increased c-Myc degradation by the
  proteasome. As a consequence, several RTKs are overexpressed that reactivate MEK2,
  but not MEK1, within 24 h. (c) Eventually, the AKT and mTOR pathways are activated
  and the ERK pathway is restored, leading to resistance to MEK inhibitors. In this
  manner, a signaling network can be reconfigured after drug treatment. ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin.
