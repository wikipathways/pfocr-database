caption: One-carbon metabolism, DNA/histone methylation, and drug interaction. Folate
  is the center of one-carbon metabolism, which involves three biochemical processes,
  the folate cycle, methionine cycle, and trans-sulfuration pathway. A set of enzymes
  (in bold) and coenzymes (in green boxes) catalyzes the different reactions. DNA
  methyltransferases (DNMTs) control DNA- and histone methylation through methyl groups
  from SAM. Deficits in folic acid and vitamins B12, B6, and B2 increase homocysteine
  levels inhibiting DNMTs. Dopamine replacement therapies supply L-dopamine that is
  converted by either catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) into 3-O-Methyldopa (3-OMD)
  by consuming methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), or aromatic L-amino
  acid decarboxylase (AADC) to generate dopamine. This dopamine can be metabolized
  into two substances, 3-ethoxyxtyramine (3-MT) and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid
  (DOPAC), both converted into homovanillic acid (HVA) and excreted in the urine.
  Both reactions are catalyzed by COMT using methyl groups from SAM, and by monoamine
  oxidase (MAO).
