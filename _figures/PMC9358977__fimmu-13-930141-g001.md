caption: The IL-18 signaling pathway and promising molecular targeted therapies for
  IL-18 and IL-18-related proteins. Pro-IL-8 is constitutively expressed and accumulated
  intracellularly. Inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation induces pro-IL-18 cleavage.
  Mature IL-18 is released through the gasdermin-D pore and binds with low affinity
  to IL-18Rα, thereby recruiting IL-18Rβ. The IL-18/IL-18R complex induces MyD88-dependent
  NF-κB activation, which subsequently promotes IFN-γ secretion primarily from T-cells
  and NK cells. IFN-γ promotes strong proinflammatory signaling through the IFN-γ
  receptor-mediated JAK–STAT pathway. The extracellular IL-18 mostly exists as the
  inactive form of the IL-18/IL-18BP complex. Free IL-18, bioactive unbound form of
  IL-18, is virtually absent in normal and most pathological conditions. The rhIL-18BP
  tadekinig-α is the most well-recognized IL-18-targeting therapy. Humanized anti-IL-18
  monoclonal antibody, called GSK1070806, and IL-18 propeptide can also inhibit IL-18
  signaling. Anti-IL-18Rβ (i.e., IL-1R7) antibody can specifically block IL-18Rβ without
  interfering with anti-inflammatory IL-37 signaling. Inhibiting the IFN-γ signaling
  pathway by using the anti-IFN-γ antibody emapalumab or a JAK inhibitor, is a promising
  therapeutic strategy for IL-18-mediated systemic autoinflammatory diseases. IFN-γ,
