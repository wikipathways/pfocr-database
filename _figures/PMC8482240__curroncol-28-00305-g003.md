caption: Pathways enriched in the RNMC-specific DEPs. MS data presented as the 130/126
  (left) and 131/126 (right) ratios. Up or downregulation of identified proteins is
  indicated by colors in the pathway (upregulated in red, downregulated in green).
  (A) The DEPs mapped to the complement activation pathway. (B) The DEPs mapped to
  EMT in the CRC pathway. (C) The DEPs mapped to the MAPK signaling pathway. The protein
  abundance of tumor tissue relative to normal tissue is indicated in different colors,
  with red indicating up-regulated protein and green indicating down-regulated protein.
