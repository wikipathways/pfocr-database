caption: Epigenetic control is involved in all the hallmarks of tumour initiation
  and survival. Tumorigenesis, propagation and survival are maintained through a complex
  interplay of multiple cellular biological processes, all of which are regulated
  to an extent by epigenetic control of gene expression. Targeting one signalling
  pathway or biological function can result in compensatory modulation of other, off-target
  drivers of cell survival. Epigenetic therapy offers the ability to concurrently
  target, and reverse, multiple aberrant signalling pathways as well as the expected
  compensatory changes in other pathways.
