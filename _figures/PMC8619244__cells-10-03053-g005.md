caption: TRPV4 integrates soluble and mechanical signaling during fibroblast differentiation
  to myofibroblast. TRPV4 senses mechanical forces and activates Rho/Rho kinase pathway.
  Rho/Rho kinase dependent polymerization of actin releases MRTF-A from actin monomers,
  which then translocates into nucleus and induces α-SMA expression by binding with
  CArG sequences together with SRF. Rho/Rho kinase, on the other hand, enables α-SMA
  incorporation into the stress fibers, resulting in fibroblast differentiation into
  myofibroblasts. TGF-β activates PI3K-gamma, which forms complex with TRPV4; the
  complex is translocated to the plasma membrane and activates calcium influx at the
  Rho/MRTF-A pathway. TRPV4/TGF-β was also shown to activate NOX4 via PI3K/Rac1, which
  feeds into Rho pathway. In addition to inducing fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblasts
  and fibrotic gene expression, Rho/Rho kinase pathway activates PAI-1 expression
  and inhibits matrix degradation. Myofibroblasts are hypercontractile and apply tensional
  forces on the ECM and activate integrins, resulting in the release of TGF-β from
  latent complex inducing a positive feedback loop and enhancing fibroblast differentiation
  to myofibroblasts, excessive ECM production, and eventually fibrosis. Since, TRPV4
  integrates soluble (TGF-β) and mechanical (integrin/Rho) signaling required for
  fibroblast differentiation and fibrosis, we propose TRPV4 as the novel therapeutic
  target for fibrosis.
