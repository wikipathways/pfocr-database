caption: Schematic of the working signal pathway. In Cypher deficient cardiomyocytes,
  phosphor Akt-473 is downregulated and leads to a significant increased p-p38 MAPK.
  There it is assumed to activate mitochondria pathway, manifested specifically by
  decreasing the expression of p21 and the ratio of bcl-2 to Bax, while increasing
  the expression of cleaved caspase-3. These lead to an increase of apoptosis, thus
  ultimately leading to dilated cardiomyopathy.
