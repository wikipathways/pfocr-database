caption: Rcs signal transduction pathway. Phosphate (∼P) transfer from the RcsC kinase
  via RcsD to the response regulator RcsB is indicated. H/H2 and D refer to phosphorylated
  histidine and aspartate residues in the signaling proteins. Dotted lines indicate
  a reversal of the pathway due to the phosphatase activity of RcsCD. Acetyl∼P or
  unknown phosphodonors (X∼P) are implicated in phosphorylating RcsB independently
  of RcsC. Pathways positively (arrowhead) or negatively (bar head) influenced by
  RcsB∼P alone, or in conjunction with the coregulator RcsA, are indicated. Lon protease
  degrades RcsA. RcsF and IgaA respond to the indicated known or unknown (?) signals
  to regulate RcsC. OM and IM, outer and inner membrane, respectively. See the text
  for details. Adapted from reference  with the permission of the publisher.
