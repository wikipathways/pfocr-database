caption: Advances in epigenetic therapy. Epigenetic modifiers and modifications provide
  targets for therapeutic intervention in disease. (A) Two histone deacetylase inhibitors
  are FDA approved for treatment of subtypes of leukemia. (B) Inhibitors of a range
  of epigenetic modifiers, including histone methyltransferase enzymes, are in preclinical
  trials. (C) DNA demethylating agents decrease genomic methylation, restoring aberrantly
  silenced gene expression by acting directly to inhibit methylating enzymes or as
  cytidine analogs are incorporated into nucleic acid of dividing cells, preventing
  methylation. (D) Cytidine analogs have the secondary effect of activating the p53
  damage pathway and inducing apoptosis.
