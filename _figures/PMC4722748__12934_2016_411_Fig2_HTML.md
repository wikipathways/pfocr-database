caption: 'Schematic representation of the metabolic pathway in E. coli for the production
  of building block chemicals (d-lactic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, putrescine,
  cadaverine, and phenyllactic acid) for polymer synthesis. Substrate and target chemicals
  are presented in green and red, respectively. Heterologous genes and lines indicating
  the corresponding reactions are shown in blue. The deletion, overexpression, or
  nucleotide substitution of the genes indicated in the metabolic pathways leads to
  improved production of the target chemicals. Corresponding enzymes and functions
  are listed in Additional file : Table S1'
