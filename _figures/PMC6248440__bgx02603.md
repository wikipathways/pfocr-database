caption: 'Schematic representation of t-RF and snoRNA biogenesis: (A) All t-RF-1s
  (including tsRNAs) derive from the maturation of tRNA. After Pol III transcription,
  the tRNA 5′ sequence (leader) is removed by RNase P, whereas the 3′ end (trailer)
  is cleaved by the tRNase Z enzyme. The stress (and starvation)-induced tRNA fragments
  termed tiRNA (tiRs) (or tRNA halves) are the result of the cleavage carried out
  by angiogenin and they are called 5’- or 3’- according to which segment of the anticodone
  loop they include. The enzymes responsible of cleaving all other tRFs are still
  unknown. (B) Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are predominantly located in introns.
  The snoRNA biogenesis pathway is essentially represented by endonuclease cleavage
  after mRNA splicing. Lariats generated after mRNA splicing, and carrying snoRNA,
  are linearized by the Debranching RNA Lariats 1 protein (DBR1). snoRNAs can alternatively
  be directly excised by endonucleases from pre-mRNA before splicing. In both cases,
  exonucleases finally release the mature snoRNA.'
