caption: 'Activation of PI3K signaling by PV. The physical interaction of PV with
  p85α results in the activation of two PI3K downstream pathways: the AKT–ILK–MMP
  pathway and the AKT–mTOR–p70S6Kpathway. The activation of the former leads to the
  degradation of the extracellular matrix involved in cell invasion and metastasis,
  and the activation of the latter results in increased cell proliferation and suppression
  of apoptosis. The bracket indicates that PV did not have an effect on the expression
  of PTEN, suggesting that PV-induced activation of PI3K is not mediated by the repression
  of PTEN.'
