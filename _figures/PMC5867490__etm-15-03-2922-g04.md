caption: Molecular mechanisms by which curcumin regulates the IGF-1R signaling pathway
  and the expression of VEGF in HepG2 cells under CoCl2-induced hypoxia. The arrow
  and blocked arrow (no arrowhead) indicate stimulation and inhibition, respectively.
  The dotted arrow indicates the translocation of HIF-1α and HIF-1β. The dotted blocked
  arrow indicates the potential effects of curcumin not directly examined in the present
  study. It was concluded that curcumin may suppress the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF
  by targeting IGF-1R or its downstream signaling pathways. VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; HIF-1β, hypoxia-inducible factor-1β;
  IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor;
  PI3K, phosphoinositide-3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; MEK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase-Erk kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase.
