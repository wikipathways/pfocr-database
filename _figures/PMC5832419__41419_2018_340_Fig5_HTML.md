caption: Gene overexpressed in A375RIV1 compared to A375-v are visualized in boxes
  (see Fig.  for results). Glucose-related metabolites that have been measured with
  higher concentration in A375RIV1 compared to A375-v are indicated in red and measured
  with lower concentrations are indicated in blue (see Fig.  for results)
