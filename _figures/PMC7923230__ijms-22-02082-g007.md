caption: Functional interaction (FI) between 10 most upregulated and 10 most downregulated
  genes that belongs to the “cell differentiation”, “cell growth”, “cell maturation”
  and “cell development” GO BP terms as well as “signaling pathways regulating pluripotency
  of stem cells” KEGG pathway. In following figure “->“ stands for activating/catalyzing,
  “-” for FIs extracted from complexes or inputs.
