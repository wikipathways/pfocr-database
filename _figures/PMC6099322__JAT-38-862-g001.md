caption: Diagram of postulated mode of action for TBBPA‐induced uterine tumors. (1)
  TBBPA binds to estrogen sulfotransferase (sult1e1); (2) estrogen sulfation pathway
  is inhibited; (3a) bioavailable estrogen can bind the ER, which translocates to
  the nucleus and leads to increased expression of estrogen‐responsive genes, (3b)
  alternative estrogen metabolic pathways (such as CYPs) can generate reactive intermediates
  that can interact with DNA and cause DNA damage; (4) estrogen‐responsive genes contribute
  to cellular proliferation of cells, some of which have increased DNA damage and
  gene mutations. CYPs, cytochrome P450s; ER, estrogen receptor; TBBPA, tetrabromobisphenol
