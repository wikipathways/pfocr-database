caption: Host mucosal responses to C. albicans. Both vaginal and oral epithelial cells
  respond to C. albicans in a biphasic way. During colonisation, C. albicans only
  induces a mild response through MAPK signalling, and this does not result in cytokine
  release. However, a high burden of C. albicans coupled with hyphal growth and candidalysin
  release activates the second stage of the biphasic MAPK pathway, which involves
  activation of transcription factor c-Fos and MAPK phosphatase (MKP1), both depicted
  in red in this figure. MEK1/2 activates ERK1/2, which is the predominant regulator
  of MKP1. The activation of c-Fos, however, is predominantly regulated by p38. The
  ensuing cytokine profiles are distinct between the different sites as indicated
  in the boxes. This leads to immune cell recruitment to the mucosa. While this leads
  to the effective phagocytosis of Candida yeast and NET release to contain and kill
  hyphae in oral candidiasis, neutrophil recruitment causes the aggravation of disease
  in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). In VVC, neutrophil phagocytosis is impaired,
  and this is partly due to reduced complement binding to Candida. This culminates
  in increased cytokine release, causing heightened nonprotective inflammation. In
  contrast to in VVC, innate lymphoid cells, γδ cells and natural killer cells play
  a vital role in Candida control by producing IL-17, known to potentiate the proinflammatory
  response of epithelial cells.
