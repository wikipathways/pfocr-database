caption: Shown above are all members of the MAPK pathway as recorded in KEGG (). Each
  protein is represented as a node containing up to nine squares, each indicating
  presence of phosphorylation in one tissue. Edges represent interactions among proteins
  in the MAP Kinase pathway and are colored when their proteins were phosporylated
  in each tissue. See also –.
