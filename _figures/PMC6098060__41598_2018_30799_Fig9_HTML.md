caption: Schematic of proposed interactions between (a) SHH signaling and HEMF secretion
  of BMP4 and GREM1 and between (b) HEMF secreted factors, epithelial phenotypes and
  BMP signaling. (a) Untreated HEMFs constitutively secrete GREM1 and secrete BMP4
  in response to SHH. GREM1 secretion may interfere with detection of BMP4 in stimulated
  HEMFs. (b) Unstimulated HEMF secreted factors increase epithelial cell thickness
  and basal cell proliferation in part via GREM1 secretion with contribution of additional
  unidentified factors. The effects of GREM1 in this model may be a direct effect
  on the squamous epithelium. Activated BMP signaling in the squamous epithelium may
  be a secondary consequence of unidentified pathway. HEMF, human esophageal myofibroblast.
