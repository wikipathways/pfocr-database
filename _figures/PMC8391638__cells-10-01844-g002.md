caption: The influence of Rho proteins on the endothelial function in sepsis-associated
  experimental models. Rho proteins have been involved in several physiological responses.
  In healthy endothelial cells (A), these responses include Rac1-mediated F-actin
  stabilization and the regulatory effect of the RhoA/ROCK pathway on the activity
  of enzymes such as the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) and the endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The balanced activity of Rho proteins contributes
  to the maintenance of the endothelial barrier function. Under experimental models
  of sepsis (B), systemic or locally produced mediators (i.e., ONNO, cytokines) reduce
  the activity of Rac1 (light gray arrow), contributing to F-actin destabilization,
  and the activity of the RhoA/ROCK pathway is increased (see the enhanced colors
  and ticker red arrows), resulting in reduced inhibition of MLCP and augmented levels
  of phosphorylated myosin (Myosin-P). This unbalanced Rho signaling contributes to
  exacerbating inflammatory responses, endothelial contraction, loss of junction proteins
  (i.e., VE-cadherin), endothelial barrier dysfunction, leukocyte infiltration, and
  vascular leakage, among others. The question mark coming from iNOS in panel B indicates
  that it remains unclear whether the high amounts of NO produced during septic insults
  significantly influence the activity of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in endothelial cells.
