caption: 'Pre-synaptic and post-synaptic mechanisms regulated by PPT1. (A) In developing
  neurons, PPT1 depalmitoylates GAP43 and potentially collapsin response mediator
  protein 1 (CRMP1) at axonal growth cones (insets). Loss of PPT1 causes disruption
  or simplification of extending axons, although the mechanism remains unclear. (B)
  At the presynapse, PPT1 contributes to the local depalmitoylation of its substrates
  as well as to lysosomal degradation of expired proteins. Red lines indicate the
  effect of PPT1-mediated depalmitoylation on localization of proteins. Both VAMP2
  and SNAP25 are trapped in the membrane in the absence of depalmitoylation by PPT1.
  PPT1 is illustrated in color code with its substrates. Pre-synaptic autophagy mechanisms
  also feed into the endo-lysosomal pathway (Liang, ), though the specific roles of
  PPT1 therein remain uncharacterized. (C–F) Loss of PPT1 causes post-synaptic dysregulation
  of dendritic spine morphology, NMDAR function, and calcium dynamics. (C) In the
  WT visual cortex, early-life visual experience triggers GluN2A expression and incorporation
  into synaptic NMDARs that are scaffolded by PSD-95 (Quinlan et al., ,). This incorporation
  generally occurs at the post-synaptic density of maturing dendritic spines, while
  GluN2B receptors are generally further from the synapse (van Zundert et al., ).
  (D) In the Ppt1−/− visual cortex, structurally immature synapses (filipodia and
  thin spines) incorporate primarily GluN2B-containing NMDARs and are scaffolded by
  SAP102. The overrepresentation of GluN2B-containing NMDARs results in higher levels
  of calcium into the extrasynaptic dendritic areas and induces excitotoxicity. (E)
  Magnification of red square in C. In WT neurons, basal GluN2B and Fyn palmitoylation
  maintain appropriate stability of GluN2B at the synaptic surface. (F) Magnification
  of red square in D. Loss of Ppt1−/− causes hyperpalmitoylation of both GluN2B and
  Fyn kinase, which leads to at least two potential mechanisms by which lack of PPT1
  causes a delayed GluN2 subunit switch and disrupted calcium dynamics. Specifically,
  GluN2B-NMDARs may be overly stabilized at the synapse in Ppt1−/− neurons via: (i)
  hyperpalmitoylation of GluN2B may increase its half-life, promoting enhanced retention
  and local assembly of GluN2B-containing NMDARs at or near the synapse or (ii) hyperpalmitoylation
  of Fyn may enhance its local activity at the PSD, phosphorylating and stabilizing
  GluN2B at the synapse by restricting its AP-2-dependent endocytosis (Prybylowski
  et al., ). Protein names are listed next to their respective symbols/representations
  except where denoted with a dotted line.'
