caption: 'The packaging constructs (A) were created by inserting the gag/pro-pol coding
  region from pNL4-3 in pCDNA3 between the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter
  and the bovine growth hormone poly A signal (BGHpA). The plasmid pGP/HIV-1 350 RRE
  contains the HIV-1 RRE; while pGP/1-4xCTE contains either 1-, 2- or 4-copies of
  MPMV CTE, respectively. The RRE or CTE sequences were inserted between the gag/pro-pol
  coding sequence and the BGHpA signal. The gene transfer vectors (B) are derivatives
  of pN-GIT72 or pN- EF1α-EGFP-WPRE. They were modified to contain 1-, 2- or 4- copies
  of CTE. The HIV-1 RRE in pN- EF1α-EGFP-WPRE was replaced with the 1045 nt SIVmac239
  RRE  to create pN- EF1α-EGFP-1x-4x CTE/SIV RRE. The vector pN- EF1α-EGFP-2A-M10-
  4xCTE /SIV RRE is similar to pN- EF1α-EGFP-4xCTE/SIV RRE, but contains EGFP-2A-M10
  fusion protein instead of only EGFP. FS: frame-shift mutation; 5′ss: 5′ splice site;
  3′ss: 3′ splice site, ΔΨ : deletion in encapsidation signal; IRES: encephalomyocarditis
  virus internal ribosome entry site; 2A: foot and mouth disease virus 2A protease
  cleavage factor; CPPT/CTS: central polypurine tract/central termination sequence.'
