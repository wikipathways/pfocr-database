caption: Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)–α expression or stabilization
  by pathways other than hypoxia. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) interacts directly
  with HIF-1α and promotes its stabilization (a) (). HSP90 inhibitors and histone
  acetylase inhibitors promote degradation of HIF-α in a von Hippel-Lindau protein
  (pVHL)–independent manner (). Another pathway is sumoylation of HIF-α (b), but there
  is disagreement as to whether this leads to increased or decreased HIF-α stability
  (). Another method of HIF regulation is reciprocal control of prolyl hydroxylase
  domain proteins (PHDs) and HIF-1α by the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling
  pathway linked to the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and RAC-alpha
  serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt) signaling (c) (,). Hypoxia-associated factor
  (HAF, known also as SART1800) is overexpressed in a variety of tumor types, and
  it binds to and ubiquitinates HIF-1α by an oxygen- and pVHL-independent mechanism
  and targets HIF-1α for proteasomal degradation (d) (). The tumor suppressor protooncogene
  p53 (p53) seems to provide a route for HIF-1α degradation in hypoxic cells (), and
  HIF-1α seems to promote p53 transcription [for a review, see ()]. An important negative
  regulator of p53 is the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) ubiquitin protein ligase (,).
  It was suggested that it promotes HIF-1α degradation by binding to the HIF-1α/p53
  complex (), but the formation of trimeric p53/MDM2/HIF-1α complexes is controversial
  (e) [for a review, see ()]. Conversely, the direct interaction of HIF-1α has been
  shown to increase HIF-1 activity and abundance in hypoxic cells (,). c-Myc = Myc
