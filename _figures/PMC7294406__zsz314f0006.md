caption: Schematic diagram of cholesterol biosynthesis—a pathway that was up-regulated
  in OSA subjects treated with CPAP. Leading edge members of the “cholesterol biosynthesis”
  gene set have been highlighted in yellow background and populate 24 critical steps
  for steroid synthesis and are detailed in . Adapted from Reactome database.
