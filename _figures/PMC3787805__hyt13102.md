caption: Modes of action of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and the deoxyuridine triphosphatase
  (dUTPase) inhibitor, TAS-114 in pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism. 5-FU is metabolized
  in the pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis pathway and exerts its antitumor action as
  fluoronucleotides. 5-Fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, 5′-monophosphate (FdUMP) inhibits thymidylate
  synthase by forming a covalent ternary complex with methylene tetrahydrofolate (THF).
  Another active metabolite, 5-fluorouridine-5′-triphosphate (FUTP) causes RNA dysfunction
  by misincorporation into RNA instead of uridine-5′-triphosphate (UTP). On the other
  hand, 5-FU is catabolized by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) mainly in liver.
  dUTPase selectively catalyzes dUTP and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, 5′-triphosphate
  (FdUTP) hydrolysis and plays an important role in restricting dUTP or FdUTP misincorporation
  into DNA instead of dTTP. TAS-114, a dUTPase inhibitor, promotes 5-FU and uracil
  misincorporation into DNA and enhances 5-FU-mediated cytotoxicity. TAS-114 also
  has a moderate DPD-inhibitory activity in addition to its potent dUTPase inhibition,
  resulting in the effective utilization of 5-FU. FU, 5-fluorouracil; DPD, Dihydropyrimidine
  dehydrogenase; UP, uridine phosphorylase; UK, uridine kinase; OPRT, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase;
  TP, thymidine phosphorylase; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; TK, thymidine kinase;
  TS, thymidylate synthase; dUTPase, deoxyuridine triphophatase; methylene THF, methylene
  tetrahydrofolate.
