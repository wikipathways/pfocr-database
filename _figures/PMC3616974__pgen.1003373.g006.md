caption: (A) Regions in CpG islands D and E that are DNA-methylated in non-malignant
  B-cells (left) become demethylated in the vast majority of CLL patients (right).
  This coincides with relaxed chromatin characterized by absence of macroH2A and enrichment
  of H3K4me2 at the promoters of the lncRNA genes DLEU1 and DLEU2/Alt1. (B) DNA-hypomethylation
  is correlated with transcriptional upregulation of splicing variants of the two
  lncRNA genes DLEU1 and DLEU2 and inversely correlated with the protein-coding genes
  in 13q14.3. No correlation could be found with levels of mature miR-15a and miR-16,
  probably because these transcripts are also deregulated by a posttranscriptional
  processing defect in CLL cells (Allegra, manuscript submitted). (C) Candidate genes
  localized in the critical region in 13q14.3 are functionally related and all modulate
  NF-kB signalling, albeit with different impact. Nuclear transporter KPNA3 is binding
  NF-kB components p65 and p50 and is therefore likely a positive regulator like e.g.
  RFP2. RFP2 binds to C13ORF1 and induces NF-kB activity via the canonical pathway
  components p50 and p65, for which its ubiquitin ligase actvity is required. The
  miRNA genes miR-15a and miR-16-1 were identified together with other members of
  this miR family to be among the strongest activators of NF-kB activity. Previously
  they have been shown to both modulate cell cycle regulators and inhibit NF-kB via
  TAB3/TAK1. DLEU7 has recently also been reported to inhibit NF-kB by binding and
  inactivating the TACI/BCMA receptors.
