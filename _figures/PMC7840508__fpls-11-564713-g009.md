caption: Model of how the shoot-to-bulblet transition is regulated from a starch–sucrose
  metabolism perspective. The quick starch accumulation driven by high expression
  levels of starch synthesis-related genes is required during the key transition stage.
  The starch is therefore the fundamental substance to fill the petiole resulting
  in bulblet scale. The proper starch synthesis is likely triggered by sucrose cleavage
  pattern from invertase catalyzed to sucrose synthase catalyzed, which corresponds
  to a switch from the apoplastic unloading pathway to symplastic one. Nevertheless,
  the shoot-to-bulblet transition defective treatment is characterized by lower starch
  content and an incomplete sucrose unloading switch, with higher expression of LohCWIN
  but lower expression of LohSuSy. TSS, total soluble sugar; AGPS, adenosine 5′-diphosphate
  glucose pyrophosphorylase small subunit; AGPL, adenosine 5′-diphosphate glucose
  pyrophosphorylase large subunit; SS, soluble starch synthase; GBSS, granule-bound
  starch synthase; SBE, starch branching enzyme; CWIN, cell wall invertase; SuSy,
  sucrose synthase.
