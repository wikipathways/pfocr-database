caption: Pyruvate flux is influenced by redox states. Upon entering the mitochondrion
  (shown as a blue box), pyruvate carbon can proceed to acetyl CoA and the Krebs cycle,
  or ultimately return to the cytosol. NAD+/NADH ratios influence this branch point,
  with a high ratio favouring the PDHC-catalysed reaction. If acetyl CoA accumulates,
  biotin decarboxylation occurs and pyruvate carboxylase converts pyruvate to OAA.
  If the NAD+/NADH ratio remains relatively elevated and ATP levels are low, OAA enters
  the Krebs cycle (an anaplerotic reaction). If the NAD+/NADH ratio falls and ATP
  levels are high, OAA is reduced and the pyruvate carbon returns to the cytosol as
  malate. In tissues that perform gluconeogenesis, if the cytosol is adequately reduced
  and contains adequate ATP, the original pyruvate carbon can proceed through that
  pathway.
