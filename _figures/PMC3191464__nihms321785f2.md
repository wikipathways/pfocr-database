caption: A model depicting the pathway of TGFβ-mediated Bim regulation and apoptosis.
  TGFβ binding to its receptor complex leads to activation of Smad3, which translocates
  to the nucleus and induces transcription of the immediate early gene MKP2 (rapid
  induction). MKP2 protein dephosphorylates and inactivates Erk1/2, which prevents
  phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of Bim. Bim interacts with
  pro-survival Bcl-2 family members (i.e., Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL) allowing effectors such
  as Bax and Bak to mediate MOMP and apoptosis. In addition, transcriptional induction
  of Bim, in response to prolonged TGFβ treatment, is achieved by Runx1 and FOXO3
  (sustained induction). Survival factors on the other hand, activate Erk1/2 through
  the Raf/MEK pathway, which in turn phosphorylates Bim, releases it from its binding
  partners, and targets it for degradation.
