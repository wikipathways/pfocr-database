caption: In the absence of MAL (upper part), newly synthesized PLP is transported
  to the myelin membrane via an indirect pathway, involving (i) vesicular transport
  to the apical-like cell body plasma membrane prior to basolateral-like myelin membranes
  and (ii) temporal accumulation in a late endosomal compartment [,]. Along this route,
  PLP partitions in distinct membrane domains, i.e., TX100-resistant or CHAPS-resistant,
  and expose different conformational epitopes during respectively biosynthetic (red,
  ET3) and transcytotic (blue, O10) transport. In the presence of MAL (lower part),
  the distinct partitioning of PLP in distinct membrane microdomains is lost and both
  conformational epitopes are exposed along the entire membrane. These MAL-mediated
  changes allow for lateral diffusion of PLP from the cell body plasma membrane to
  the myelin membrane (green, ET3/O10).
