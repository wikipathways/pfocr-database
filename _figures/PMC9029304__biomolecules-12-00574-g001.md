caption: Proposed targets of the molecular mechanisms of metformin to reduce the proliferation
  and growth of thyroid cancer cells. Metformin acts mainly through nuclear stimulation
  of AMPK, which decreases the activation of TSC2 and the activation of mTOR, with
  the subsequent reduction in cyclin D1 and p70S6K/pS6 signaling, resulting in the
  inhibition of protein synthesis and cell cycle arrest. The blockade of IRS-1 phosphorylation
  decreases the signaling of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which also contributes to the reduction
  in mTOR pathway activation. Likewise, the direct effects of metformin on the mitochondria,
  by reducing Complex 1 or mGPDH, decreases energy production and cell stress and
  leads to cell apoptosis.
