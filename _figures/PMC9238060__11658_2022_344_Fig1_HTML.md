caption: HER2 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling are two essential pathways with essential
  roles in the progression of breast cancer cells. HER2 signaling exerts its function
  via dimerization and thereby activation of various other pathways, such as PI3K/AKT,
  leading to EMT migration and, thus, cancer progression. The function of TGFβ can
  culminate in cytostasis and prevent cancer progression. Even though it can enhance
  phosphorylation as S208 of SMAD3, it amplifies the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to
  promote breast cancer. In addition, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway can act as a breast
  cancer promoter and exacerbate the disease by entering β-catenin into the nucleus
  and affecting TCF/LEF
