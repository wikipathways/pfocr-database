caption: An integrated isotope-assisted metabolomics and 13C metabolic flux analysis
  was was firstly systematically performed in A. niger. In response to enzyme production,
  the metabolic flux in A. niger DS03043 (high-producing) was redistributed, characterized
  by an increased carbon flux directed to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway
  as well as an increased pool size of pentose. The consistency in 13C metabolic flux
  analysis and metabolites quantification indicated that an imbalance of NADH formation
  and consumption led to the accumulation and secretion of organic acids in A. niger
