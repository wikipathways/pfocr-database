caption: 'A: In the adult, the RTN no longer possesses intrinsic pacemaker properties
  (). We postulate that the discharge of RTN neurons is regulated by their “chemical
  drive” (intrinsic pH-sensitivity and inputs from peripheral chemoreceptors) and
  by synaptic inputs that develop along with various behaviors that require large
  changes in respiration (emotions, stress and particularly physical exercise). B:
  In the neonate the RTN, a subset of neurons previously identified as the pfRG, is
  a cluster of pH-sensitive excitatory neurons endowed with intrinsic bursting activity
  (). We hypothesize that the intrinsic bursting properties of these neurons provide
  a background activity that enables these cells to be up and down regulated by the
  local pH and, presumably, also by inputs from peripheral chemoreceptors. C: graphic
  representation of how RTN neurons might regulate arterial PCO2 in the adult. The
  chemical drive of the RTN neurons is represented in blue and the other drives (synaptic
  drives from within the brain) in green. Any small deviation of PCO2 from the set-point
  translates into an increase or decrease in the chemical drive of the RTN cells;
  the effect is to increase or decrease ventilation and bring PCO2 back to the set-point
  (mechanism represented by the curved blue arrows). When metabolic requirements are
  low, the chemical drive may be the predominant factor that maintains the activity
  of the RTN neurons. D: theoretical concept of how RTN might differentially control
  the respiratory rhythm, the inspiratory motor outflow and the activity of expiratory
  muscles. The core components of the rhythm and pattern generating circuit are redrawn
  after . Excitatory neurons that presumably function via fast ionotropic transmission
  are in green. The pre-I glutamatergic neurons are the primary oscillator of the
  preBötC (). Inhibitory neurons that use ionotropic GABAergic or glycinergic transmission
  are in red (). RTN neurons are depicted in magenta to convey the notion that their
  post-synaptic effect may be mediated by a slow signaling pathway (“tonic drive”,
  )). Expiratory pre-motor neurons (E2, i.e. E-AUG) are located in the cVRG. These
  neurons derive their expiratory-augmenting membrane trajectory from inhibitory volleys
  (GABA or glycine) during the I and the post-I (E-DEC) phases of the respiratory
  cycle (). To account for evidence that the RTN region regulates expiration (), we
  hypothesize that a subset of RTN neurons provides a form of tonic excitatory drive
  to the expiratory pre-motor neurons of the cVRG (E2, green). RTN neurons collectively
  innervate the cVRG, rVRG, preBötC and BötC regions but the exact neuronal targets
  within these regions are unknown and it is also unknown whether the cVRG, rVRG,
  preBötC and BötC are differentially innervated by subsets of RTN neurons. Some of
  the ramp-I premotor neurons located in the dorsal respiratory group (not represented)
  may also be targeted by RTN neurons which innervate this region of the NTS. Finally,
  RTN neurons have a respiratory modulation with an intensity roughly proportional
  to that of the central respiratory drive (). This modulation could be a form of
  feedback that originates from inhibitory interneurons with early-I, E-DEC and E-2
  activity (). The location of these inhibitory neurons in the ventral respiratory
  group where indicated is only a guess.'
