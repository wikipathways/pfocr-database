caption: '(A) Wnts are secreted proteins that are lipidated in the ER by Porcupine.
  Wntless/ Evi regulates Wnt secretion. In the signal-receiving cell, many Wnt ligands
  induce the β-catenin-dependent signalling cascade. In the absence of Wnt, β-catenin
  is constantly phosphorylated by the destruction complex and marked for degradation
  by the proteasome. When Wnt binds to its receptor Fzd and the co-receptor LRP5/6,
  Dvl and the destruction complex are recruited to the plasma membrane. This prevents
  phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin, which results in the accumulation
  of hypo-phosphorylated β-catenin in the cytoplasm. β-Catenin travels to the nucleus
  to modulate gene expression by interacting with the transcription factor TCF/LEF.
  Several Wnt target genes function as negative regulators of the pathway, such as
  Axin2, Dkk and Rnf43/Znrf3. Rnf43/Znrf3 marks Fzd for proteasomal degradation. When
  RSPO binds to Lgr, this complex recruits and inhibits Rnf43/Znrf3. This double-negative
  regulation amplifies Wnt signalling activity. (B) Periodic segmentation of mammalian
  embryos or somitogenesis is regulated by oscillations of Wnt, Notch and Fgf signalling.
  Coupling between cells via Notch signalling leads to the formation of signalling
  waves (in orange) travelling from the posterior tip to the anterior side of the
  presomitic mesoderm (PSM), where segment formation is induced. In addition to signalling
  waves, the tissue is organized by antagonistic gradients of Wnt/Fgf and retinoic
  acid (RA). (C) In mouse somitogenesis, Wnt and Notch signalling oscillations are
  coupled and have different dynamics in the segmenting tissue: In the posterior,
  Wnt and Notch signalling oscillate out-of-phase, in the anterior they oscillate
  in phase. This change in phase-relationship is essential for proper segmentation.'
