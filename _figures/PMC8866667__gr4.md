caption: The p38 MAPK pathway, which is activated by a wide variety of stimuli, is
  crucial in inflammation, cell death and cell proliferation, and therefore has been
  implicated in many cellular events relevant to COPD pathophysiology. In particular,
  p38 signaling pathway induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines
  (IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α), which together with other mediators (IL-17A and IL-17 ​F)
  produced by Th17 and ILC3 cells contribute to recruitment and activation of neutrophils.
  These findings support the pharmacological rationale for targeting p38 MAPK.
