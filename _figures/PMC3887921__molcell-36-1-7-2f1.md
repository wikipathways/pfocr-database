caption: Autophagy pathway. The autophagic pathway procedes through a series of sequential
  steps. These begin with the initiation of the pathway and autophagosome nucleation
  (formation of a pre-autophagosomal structure leading to an isolation membrane or
  phagophore). This is followed by autophagosomal elongation, a step mediated by two
  ubiquitin-like conjugation systems (i.e., ATG8, and the ATG5/ATG12 systems). The
  next steps involve autophagosome maturation, including the sequestration of cytosol
  or specific substrates, and autophagosome/lysosome fusion. In the final stage, autophagosomal
  cargoes are digested by lysosomal enzymes, and the contents released for metabolic
  recycling.
