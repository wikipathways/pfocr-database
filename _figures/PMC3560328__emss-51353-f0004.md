caption: In cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle, nucleotide excision repair (NER)
  can remove a subset of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Excision by XPF–ERCC1 is followed
  by translesion synthesis, and excision of the ‘flipped out’ ICL. However, some lesions
  cannot be bypassed in this manner and a futile cycle of repair involving excision
  and ligation occurs. During S phase, a partially processed intermediate may be encountered
  by a replication fork, which leads to the collapse of the replication fork and the
  formation of a one-ended double-strand break (DSB). These collapses are probably
  avoided by FANCM-mediated fork regression and stabilization of the fork by the Fanconi
  anaemia (FA) pathway. This FA-stabilized homologous recombination (HR) intermediate
  (highlighted by beige circles) allows the nascent leading strand of DNA synthesis
  (indicated by a green arrow) to be extended by translesion synthesis polymerases
  (Pol; black dashed arrow). Unhooking of the ICL by coordinated incision by the 5′-
  and the 3′-flap endonucleases allows extension past the lesion. HR is then completed
  and replication can be re-established. If a second replication fork has encountered
  the ICL from the opposite direction, unhooking on the 3′ side cuts the leading strand
  template. The extension of the ‘left-hand’ leading strand would lead to its joining
  with the lagging strand of the right-hand fork, followed by second end capture and
  extension of the right-hand leading strand and the left-hand template strand. This
  process would complete replication without the re-initiation of lagging strand synthesis
  but would generate a double Holliday junction. This structure is resolved by the
  BLM-containing complex or may in some instances be cut by structure-specific nucleases
  (not shown). FAN1, Fanconi-associated nuclease 1.
