caption: Diagram of the sphingolipid metabolism pathway in BV2 microglia. The red
  arrow indicates the sphingolipid components (blue) and sphingolipid metabolism-related
  enzymes (brown) that are upregulated or downregulated after Aβ25-35 oligomer induction;
  the green arrow indicates the sphingolipid components (blue) and sphingolipid metabolism-related
  enzymes (brown) that are upregulated or downregulated after HLJDD treatment.
