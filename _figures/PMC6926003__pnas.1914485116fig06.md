caption: 'Conformational basis of pathway choice of lesion-stalled replisomes. (A)
  Conformational transitions of Pol III core complex during TLS. (a) Pol III core
  (αεθ) occupies both α– and ε–clefts during processive replication. (b and c) Upon
  encountering a lesion on the leading strand, Pol III core swings away from the P/T
  junction while remaining bound to the β2 clamp through the α-cleft interaction.
  This conformational transition is either facilitated or suppressed by the dnaQ(εQ)
  or the dnaQ(εL) mutations, respectively. (d and e) Pol IV binds to the ε–cleft and
  take over the P/T junction and performs TLS past the lesion. (f) After synthesizing
  a short patch, Pol IV swings away from the P/T junction and Pol III core reestablishes
  the ε–cleft interaction and resumes processive replication. Within closed states,
  states a and b, the ε-cleft is occupied by the ε subunit. Within open states, states
  c though f, the ε–cleft is not occupied by the ε subunit. The θ subunit of Pol III
  core is not depicted for simplicity. (B) Pathway choice for lesion-stalled replisomes
