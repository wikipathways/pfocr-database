caption: Ferroptosis regulators and pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and
  colorectal cancer (CRC). Ferroptosis can be a negative regulator of HCC and CRC.
  Various compounds can inhibit HCC and CRC growth by inducing ferroptosis. The blue
  and green patterns correspond to regulators for HCC and CRC, respectively. Sorafenib
  induces HCC ferroptosis by inhibiting SLC7A11. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) triggers
  HCC ferroptosis by activating unfolded protein response and upregulating CHAC1.
  Ketamine increases HCC ferroptosis by inhibiting GPX4. Haloperidol promotes ferroptosis
  via the increase of Fe2+ levels and lipid peroxidation in HCC. IMCA induces CRC
  ferroptosis by inhibiting SLC7A11. β-elemene and cetuximab combined treatment results
  in CRC ferroptosis by downregulating GPX4 and SLC7A11. Apatinib enhances CRC ferroptosis
  by up-regulating ELOVL6/ACSL4 signaling. Tagitinine C induces CRC ferroptosis via
  the up-regulation of the PERK-Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathway. Cetuximab increases CRC
  ferroptosis by downregulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Cytoglobin increases CRC ferroptosis
  through the upregulation of p53 and YAP1.
