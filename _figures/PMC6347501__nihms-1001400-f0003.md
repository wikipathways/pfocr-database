caption: ‘Stemness’ maintenance pathways in CSCs. a) Canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  starts with binding of Wnt ligand to Frizzled receptor (Fzd) and low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein 5/6 coreceptors (LRP5/6). This results in recruitment of
  Axin and dishevelled (Dvl) to the plasma membrane and leads to protection of β-catenin
  from degradation. Free β-catenin in the cytoplasm then translocates to the nucleus
  and complexes with TCF/LEF to regulate Wnt target stem cell genes. b) Hh signaling
  pathway is initiated by binding of hedgehog class of ligands to Patched1 (PTCH1)
  or Patched2 (PTCH2) receptors. The receptor-ligand binding removes Patched receptor
  mediated inhibition of a G-protein coupled protein, Smoothened (Smo), leading to
  the nuclear translocation of Gli family transcription factors (a glioma associated
  oncogene homolog transcription factors). c) Notch signaling is initiated when a
  notch ligand of a cell binds to the notch receptor of an adjacent cell. This results
  in release of the intracellular part of the notch, which translocates into the nucleus
  and acts as a transcriptional co-activator. When the Notch transcriptional co-activators
  bind to target gene promoter regions, this leads to the activation of its target
  CSC genes. d) Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic portion of CD133 leads to the phosphorylation
  of AKT. Activated AKT activates the NF-kB pathway, resulting in activation of stemness
  genes. e) ATP-dependent mechanism of drug efflux by ABC transporters. f) HIF1α and
  cMyc increase glycolysis (or Warburg effect) and inhibit oxidative phosphorylation
  in CSCs for rapid energy production. HIF1α activates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases
  (PDK1–3), which inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and thus inhibits oxidative
  phosphorylation. c-Myc and HIF1α also activate lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) to
  favor Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis). C-Myc also activates the GLUT-1 receptor,
  hexokinase, and phosphofructokinase (PFK) that favor glycolysis.
