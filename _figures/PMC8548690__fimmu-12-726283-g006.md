caption: Competitive inhibition of ACE2 by both anti-A antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 in
  blood group O patients. The SARS-CoV-2 and anti-A antibodies induced ACE2 downregulation.
  Ang-II can activate NF-κB pathway in AT1R-mediated inflammatory response, leading
  to the increased production of multiple inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, SARS-CoV2
  had more difficulties to use ACE2 as the cellular entry receptor because of anti-A
  antibodies.
