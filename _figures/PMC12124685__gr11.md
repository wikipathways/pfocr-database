caption: 'Overview of HIV-1 infection stages, deregulated miRNAs, targeted hub genes,
  and principal enriched signaling pathways in macrophages. The figure illustrates
  the major stages of the HIV-1 replication cycle in macrophages: (1) Binding of HIV-1
  to CD4 and CCR5 receptors, (2) Fusion of viral and host membranes, (3) Initiation
  of reverse transcription, (4) Completion of reverse transcription, (5) Uncoating
  of the viral capsid, (6) Integration of viral DNA into the host genome, (7) Translation
  of viral proteins, (8) Assembly and budding of new viral particles, and (9) Release
  and maturation of virions. Identified deregulated miRNAs following HIV-1 infection
  are shown, with upregulated miRNAs indicated in red, and downregulated miRNAs shown
  in green. Key hub genes targeted by these miRNAs are represented in three groups,
  comprising genes targeted by upregulated miRNAs (red box), genes targeted by downregulated
  miRNAs (green box), and genes targeted by both up- and downregulated miRNAs (brown
  box).The lower panel depicts the principal signaling pathways enriched among the
  miRNA targets, including the MAPK, PI3K-Akt, mTOR, NF-κB, and p53 signaling pathways,
  highlighting their major biological roles such as proliferation, apoptosis, immune
  regulation, cellular metabolism, and inflammation'
