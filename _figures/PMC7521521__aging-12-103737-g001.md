caption: 'Schematic overview of cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) and the NEDD8 conjugation
  pathway. (A) Cullin (CUL) proteins form the scaffold of the CRL E3 ligase complexes.
  CRL1 and CRL7 use SKP1; CRL2 and CRL5 use both Elongin B and Elongin C; CRL4A and
  CRL4B use DDB1; and CRL3 uses BTB as substrate adaptors. CRL1 uses F-box proteins;
  CRL4A and CRL4B use DCAF; CRL2 and CRL5 use SOCSs; and CRL7 uses FBXW8 as substrate
  binding proteins. CRL1-3, 4A/B and 7 use Rbx1; and CRL5 uses Rbx2 as RING-finger
  proteins. (B) Conjugation of the Ub-like protein NEDD8 to a cullin protein is required
  for fully activation of the CRL. The conjugation of NEDD8 occurs in three steps:
  activation by the NEDD8 activation enzyme (NAE; E1N), transference to the E2 enzyme
  (E2N), and conjugation of NEDD8 to the cullin protein in the CRL. UBE2F is the major
  E2N needed for NEDD8 conjugation to CRL5. MLN4924 (Pevonedistat) is a first-in-class
  inhibitor of E1N that can prevent NEDD8 conjugation to CRLs. Abbreviations: Ub,
  ubiquitin; RING, really interesting new gene; DDB1, DNA damage-binding protein 1;
  DCAF, DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor; FBXW8, F-box and WD40 domain 8; BTB, broad-complex,
  tramtrack, and bric-à-brac; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling.'
