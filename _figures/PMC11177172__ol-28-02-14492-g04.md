caption: 'Regulatory associations between protein-protein networks, based on the IPA
  Knowledge Base. The top 35 of the 155 proteins whose expression correlated with
  that of CBR1 were extracted in the order of interaction network robustness and presented
  as a subnetwork. The red and green nodes indicate a positive or negative correlation
  with CBR1 expression, respectively. The node shapes denote enzymes (diamond), transporters
  (trapezoid), and other (cycle) proteins. Solid and dashed lines represent direct
  and indirect interactions, respectively. Nodes involved in eIF2 signaling are highlighted
  by cyan borders. CP: Canonical pathways'
