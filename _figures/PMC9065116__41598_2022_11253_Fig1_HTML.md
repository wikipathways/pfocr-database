caption: The mechanisms of AD and IIA. The mechanisms of apoptosis induction in 208Fsrc3
  transformed cells by (a) autocrine destruction AD, (b) Intercellular induction of
  apoptosis IIA and (c) Radiation-induced intercellular induction of apoptosis. In
  the absence of non-transformed 208F cells, 208Fsrc3 transformed cells at sufficient
  densities undergo autocrine destruction through POD/HOCl pathway. In the presence
  of non-transformed 208F cells, 208Fsrc3 transformed cells experience additional
  apoptosis signaling through the NO·/ONOO−pathway. Irradiation of non-transformed
  208F cells stimulates the intercellular POD/HOCl apoptosis pathway between irradiated
  non-transformed and transformed cells, in addition to augmenting the pre-existing
  NO·/ONOO−pathway, resulting in an overall enhancement in apoptosis induction in
  transformed 208Fsrc3 cells.
