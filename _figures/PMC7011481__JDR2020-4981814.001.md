caption: Overview of the insulin signaling pathway and relevant mechanisms implicated
  in AD. (a) Tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS) allows
  the association of IRSs with the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K). The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway deactivates glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3),
  leading to the activation of glycogen synthase (GYS) and thus glycogen synthesis.
  In addition, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway can affect protein synthesis/metabolism
  and clearance of Aβ by activating the mTOR pathway. (b) The insulin/insulin signaling
  pathway can promote glucose transportation by regulating GLUT, and high levels of
  glucose can lead to Aβ deposition. (c) Disordered glucose metabolism leads to ROS/RNS
  formation and decreased ATP production, which is the main manifestation of oxidative
  stress. Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to impaired cellular energy production
  and reduction in insulin secretion and sensitivity. (d) Impaired insulin signaling
  pathway, Aβ deposition, and mitochondrial dysfunction promote each other to form
  a vicious circle.
