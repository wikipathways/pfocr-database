caption: The biosynthesis and degradation of glycine. Glycine (GLY) is synthesized
  from serine (SER) by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) using tetrahydrofolate
  (THF) as cofactor and generating 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (5,10-MeTHF) and
  water. GLY is also synthesized de novo from CO2 and  by the glycine cleavage system
  that uses 5,10-MeTHF and NADH and generates THF and NAD+. GLY is metabolically removed
  by three pathways, specifically the SHMT-mediated synthesis of SER by SHMT, the
  reverse of the synthetic pathway; the conversion to CO2 and  by the glycine cleavage
  system, utilizing NAD+ and generating NADH, the reverse of the synthetic pathway;
  and a minor pathway to glyoxylate catalyzed by D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), and
  the resulting glyoxylate converted to oxalate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), using
  NAD+ and generating NADH. GLY is also removed by the glycine deportation system
  by acylation with benzoyl-CoA, yielding N-benzoylglycine (hippuric acid; HA), which
  is irreversibly excreted into urine. GLY deportation is the only truly irreversible
  reaction of GLY homeostasis.
