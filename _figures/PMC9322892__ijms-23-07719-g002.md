caption: 'Comparative molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CD and MIS-C by
  activating the zonulin pathway, increasing intestinal permeability, hyperinflammation
  and immune dysregulation (↑ = Increased; ↑↑ = High). (A). The undigested fragments
  of gluten peptides in the intestinal lamina propria are attacked and deamidated
  by tTG, then taken up and presented to HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules by DC and via T-helper
  cells will initiate an adaptive immune response. The gliadin peptides bound to the
  TLR2 receptors will influence the increase in cytokine production through MYD88,
  the key protein involved in the release of zonulin after gluten ingestion. The transactivation
  of zonulin by EGFR through PAR2 stimulates a cascade of biological events that finally
  will lead to the activation of PKCα-dependent TJs disassembly. Zonulin renders inactive
  by proteolytic degradation by trypsin IV. Practically, zonulin will weaken the epithelial
  TJs and increase intestinal permeability. A gluten-specific T-cell response will
  initiate a cascade of events, followed by the activation of B and plasma B cells,
  the release of IgA and IgG antibodies (anti-gliadin and anti-tTG), the mucosal inflammation
  and reshaping, and the initiation of the autoimmune processes. (B). Clinical picture
  and dramatically altered biological data in MIS-C. (C). Following the ingestion
  of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its presence in the lumen of the small intestine, its
  spike proteins and RNA fractions, in conjunction with the intestinal dysbiosis,
  bind to TLR receptors and will influence the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines
  production through MYD88, and the release of zonulin, exactly as described above
  in section A. A zonulin-dependent loss of the intestinal mucosal barrier will lead
  to a “leaky gut” with subsequent trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 antigens into the bloodstream
  and a dysfunctional immune response, i.e., immune hyperactivation, massive cytokine
  production (cytokine storm), huge release of antibodies, complement activation,
  microthrombosis, severe systemic inflammation, capillary leak, endothelial and tissue
  damage, and finally multiple organ dysfunction (MIS-C). [ was imagined and drawn
  by L.M.A. using Microsoft Paint 3D (3D Library—Biology: human heart and brain) for
  Windows 10 and using completely free picture material (human lungs, kidney, intestines,
  and capillaries clip arts) from SeekPNG.com (accessed on 4 June 2022), for which
