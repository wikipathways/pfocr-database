caption: 'Pathway analysis of the proteome landscape generated by the direct comparison
  between cells differentiating in alginate capsules and Matrigel differentiated-cells.
  (a) Analysis workflow and IPA-generated tables of the top canonical pathways predicted
  activated or inhibited at stage 5 of differentiation between S5bead[S0-S5] as compared
  and S5-cells. (b–d) IPA-generated graphical representation of RhoGDI signalling,
  PI3K/AKT Pathway and Integrin Signalling, (e) Analysis workflow and IPA-generated
  tables of the top canonical pathways predicted activated or inhibited at stage 7
  of differentiation between in S7bead[S5-S7] as compared and S7-cells (blue - predicted
  inhibited, orange – predicted activated, green – observed downregulation, red –
  observed upregulation, arrow heads point to integrin involvement, magenta # points
  at shared top pathways between the comparisons). The pathways were generated through
  the use of IPA (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbio-informatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).'
