caption: The mechanism investigation of miR-195 in different stroke mediators, with
  a particular emphasis on the KLF5/ JNK axis. Our findings suggested that treatment
  strategies targeting miR-195 could be performed to suppress neuronal apoptosis and
  enhance brain plasticity by inhibiting KLF5 and JNK signaling pathway after ischemic
  stroke in rat models

  through inhibiting KLF5-mediated activation of the JNK signaling pathway.
