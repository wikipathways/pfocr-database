caption: SAM synthesized from methionine donates methyl groups to various methyl recipients.
  Alternatively, SAM can be decarboxylated for the synthesis of polyamines, and the
  recycling of the byproduct methylthioadenosine is known as the methionine salvage
  pathway. SAM-dependent methylation generates SAH, and the subsequent hydrolysis
  of SAH produces adenosine and homocysteine, which can feed purine metabolism and
  transsulfuration for cysteine and glutathione synthesis, respectively. Homocysteine
  can also be recycled for methionine synthesis. Folate and choline are metabolized
  to provide necessary methyl groups for remethylating homocysteine.
