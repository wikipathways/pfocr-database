caption: Signaling pathways affected in hyperoxia. Excessive ROS modulate intracellular
  signaling, including via nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. In parallel, oxidative damage to DNA activates p53,
  which induces the transcription of target genes. In turn, damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs) upregulated by these pathways are released into the extracellular
  space, where they can bind receptors such as the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and
  further activate the NF-κB pathway. Signaling events orchestrated by these and other
  pathways determine the outcome of hyperoxia-mediated oxidative stress and may include
  cell survival, senescence, death, and inflammation. Created with BioRender.com
