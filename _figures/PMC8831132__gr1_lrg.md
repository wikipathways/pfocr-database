caption: 'NAD+ metabolism and points of pharmacological intervention.Enzymes involved
  in NAD+ biosynthesis and hydrolysis play important roles in inflammation and immunity.
  Biosynthetic pathways include the NAD+ salvage pathway, which recycles nicotinamide
  to form NMN, then NAD+, and the de novo pathway that begins with tryptophan. Hydrolysis
  of NAD+ is largely carried out by PARPs, which tag target proteins with poly- or
  mono-(ADP ribose); sirtuins, which remove acyl groups and create O-acyl-ADP-ribose;
  and CD38, BST, and SARM1, which create (cyclic)-ADP-ribose []. There are multiple
  points of potential pharmacological intervention throughout NAD+metabolic pathways.
