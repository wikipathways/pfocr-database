caption: 'Flavivirus; entry, life cycle, and immune system interaction: (A) Flavivirus
  infections are generally transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito or
  tick. (B) Flaviviruses usually infect host monocytes and dendritic cells. Viral
  replication and assembly of the immature virion occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) followed by generation of mature virions in the trans-Golgi network which is
  then released by exocytosis. (C) Following viral infection, release of type I IFNs
  leads to expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) by the JAK/STAT pathway.
  Release of pro-inflammatory cytokines leads to recruitment of immune cells like
  T cells and NK cells to site of infection. Red ‘No entry’ signs reflect stages and
  pathways of IFN and ISG production that are inhibited by flaviviruses to evade anti-viral
  immune responses'
