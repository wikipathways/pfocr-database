caption: The synthesis and function of estrogen in cell transcriptional regulation.
  The aromatase expressed in liver, placenta, bone and breast promotes the synthesis
  of estrone from testosterone with the stimulation of LH and FSH. Then estrone mediate
  the further synthesis of estradiol including 17α- and 17β-estradiol and finally
  synthesize estriol by hydroxylation. Sequencely, estrogen alternate the immunological
  differentiation by two pathways. (1) Canonically, estrogen promotes the transcription
  of estrogen-target genes by ERα/β activation together with co-factor, including
  GATA3, c-Jun, CBP, and FOXA1. (2) Non-canonically, estrogen enhances the NF-κB,
  ERK and β-catenin pathway by GPER activation
