caption: Mechanism of metastatic brain metastasis. (A‐B) Break away from the original
  tumor and break through the extracellular matrix. (A) Lung cancer. (A①) Genes such
  as RAC1, PMS2, MUC5AC regulate ECM, metabolism, tumorigenesis, and angiogenesis
  to promote brain metastasis. (A②) Hypoxia stimulates the RASSF1A/kinase Hippo pathway,
  exacerbating the formation of brain metastasis. (A③) EGFR mutation promotes brain
  metastasis through ERK1/2–E2F1–WNT5A. (A④) LGALS8–AS1 targets miR‐885‐3p to mediate
  the expression of FSCN1, ultimately leading to the formation of brain metastasis.
  (A⑤) HLA‐G expression is increased, and it acts on adjacent tumor cells through
  SPAG9/STAT3 to promote their self‐renewal ability and growth. (A⑥) CD44+ lung cancer
  stem cells derive vascular pericytes, form metastatic niches, and migrate across
  the endothelium by mediated GPR124. (A⑦) Nicotine induces neutrophils to produce
  exosomal miR‐4466, promoting stemness and invasion properties of lung cancer cells.
  (B) Breast cancer. (B①) Hyal‐1 produces hydrogel to wrap and promote tumor cells
  growth. (B②) Lipocalin‐2 regulates MMP9 and exerts various functions such as angiogenesis,
  ECM reconstruction, BBB disruption, and tumorigenesis. (B③) The loss of Kmt2c/Kmt2d
  promotes tumor growth through the H3K27me3–KDM6A–MMP3 axis. (B④) High expression
  of NDRG1 is associated with stemness and promotes tumor growth. (C) Extravasation
  through blood–brain barrier. (C①‐②) Lung cancer. (C①) MSLN‐overexpressing cells
  achieve brain metastasis by enhancing the ability to penetrate the BBB. Mechanistically,
  MSLN facilitates the expression and activation of MET through the c‐Jun N‐terminal
  kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. (C②) Exosomal LncRNA LINC01356 and miR‐375‐3p derived
  from brain metastatic cells, as well as Lnc–MMP2‐2‐overexpressing or CXCR4+ tumor
  cells, promote the occurrence of brain metastasis by inhibiting the tight junctions
  of the BBB (including Claudin‐5, Occulin, and ZO‐1). (C③‐⑤) Breast cancer. (C③‐⑤)
  Tumor cells enhance BBB adhesion through RET, MUC1, VCAM1, VLA‐4, ICAM1/2, and secretion
  of exosomes. Meanwhile, the EGFR–DOCK4–RAC1 axis regulates cell morphology and facilitates
  their passage through the BBB. (C⑥) Tumor cells and pericytes promote vascular leakage
  and metastasis by mimicking angiogenesis through PDGFRβ and PDGF–BB
