caption: 'Subcellular compartmentation of TIA biosynthesis and inter- or intra-cellular
  transport of TIAs in Catharanthus roseus. TIA biosynthetic pathway in aerial organs
  of C. roseus occurs in four cell types: internal phloem-associated parenchyma (IPAP),
  epidermal cells, laticifers and idioblasts. An ATP-binding cassette transporters
  TPT2 can transport catharanthine from epidermal cells to deposit on cuticle. The
  transporters transport TIA intermediates between these cells, such as desacetoxyvindoline
  from epidermal cells to laticifers and idioblasts for vindoline biosynthesis and
  loganic acid communicates between the epidermal cells and IPAP cells, remain unknown,
  as indicated by question marks. In each type of cells, primarily, the epidermal
  cells, the vacuole, the chloroplast and possibly, the nucleus, are involved in the
  TIA biosynthesis. However, transporters or transport mechanisms for cross-membrane
  communication of these intermediates are largely unknown. How do two important precursors
  secolognain and tryptamine are transported into the vacuole for their condensation
  into strictosidine by vacuole-localized STR? Are they transported by MATE transporters?
  What is it necessary for SGD localization in the nucleus, as reported, since aglycon
  is still need to be transported out of the nucleus? How the product of T3O/T3R is
  transported into the chloroplast for methylation by the granule-localized NMT? All
  these questions need to be answered to give a clear scenario of intermediate transport
  or trafficking during the TIA biosynthesis. Abbreviations are: SGD, strictosidine
