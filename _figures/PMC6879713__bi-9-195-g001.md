caption: It is well known that TME has unique physiological characteristics such as
  irregular acidic pH and hypoxia, which can cause the up- and/or down-regulation
  of certain biomolecules such as enzymes.,- Because of abnormal proliferation of
  cancer cells and irregular vascular network in not being able to supply sufficient
  blood to all cancer cells, cancer cells experience hypoxia, and as a consequence,
  they show an increased dependency on glycolysis for the energy provision instead
  of oxidative phosphorylation that is defined as Warburg effect.,, This glycolysis
  pathway leads to the production of a large amount of lactate and H+ ions. One of
  the adaptive mechanisms of cancer cells to adverse conditions is the activation
  of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which may result in the overexpression of
  the pH-regulating proteins, including isoforms II, IX, and XII of carbonic anhydrases
  (CAs), Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1), and V-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). The expression
  levels of these molecular machinery pieces seem to be strongly enhanced under the
  hypoxic conditions via HIF-1 pathway concurrent with the glycolysis phenomenon.,  represents
  the molecular machinery involved in the pH dysregulation phenomenon in the TME.
  All these events result in the outward transportation of accumulated acidic byproducts
  into the extracellular fluid (ECF) in the TME, which makes the extracellular pH
  of solid tumors become more acidic compared to the normal tissues. Such an acidic
  condition of the TME can influence the integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM),
  and hence, remodel the TME by the degradation of the ECM in favor of further metastasis
  and progression of cancer. The acidic condition in the serial extracellular fluid
  (ECF) of solid tumors may provoke the exocytosis in cancer cells. All these incidences
  create a complex dynamic situation within TME, which result in capricious cacophonous
  functions in cancer cells along with other stromal cells such as the immune system
  cells. Under such circumstances, the rebellious cancer cells develop defense mechanisms
  against anticancer agents and circumvent the immunosurveillance functionalities.
  The emergence of such complexity makes the treatment of solid tumors very problematic.,,
