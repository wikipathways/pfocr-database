caption: Characterization of CXCL14-associated, transcriptome-wide changes in the
  SAE of COPD smokers. (A) Ingenuity molecular pathway analysis. Molecular pathways
  with strong contributions by genes correlating with CXCL14 expression in the SAE
  of COPD smokers (Spearman correlation ρ ≥ 0.4, P < 0.05; Table E1) are shown on
  the abscissa. The “ratio” (the number of pathway genes that correlate with CXCL14
  expression, compared with the total number of genes in the pathway) is plotted on
  the ordinate. The significance of enrichment (P value based on the Fisher exact
  test) is indicated for each pathway. (B) Functional category analysis. Genes correlating
  with CXCL14 in the SAE of COPD smokers, identified as already described, were grouped
  into dominant functional categories, based on a search of the available literature.
  Nodes indicate individual genes; gene symbols and coefficients of correlation with
  CXCL14 (Spearman ρ) are shown. Edges indicate the relationship between the genes
  and associated functional categories.
