caption: Effect of oxygen deprivation and/or nutrient deprivation on fatty acid (FA)
  metabolism in cancer cells. a Cancer cells with a sufficient supply of nutrients
  and oxygen mainly use glucose-derived acetyl-CoA for de novo FA synthesis to support
  rapid cell proliferation. They can also acquire FAs from the environment. b Different
  types of hypoxic cancer cells differentially regulate FA synthesis depending on
  various environmental factors—particularly, nutrient availability. Hypoxia inhibits
  the entry of glucose-derived pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Hence, cells either switch
  to alternative carbon sources (i.e. glutamine or acetate) for FA synthesis or increase
  their FA uptake. FA desaturation is impaired by oxygen deprivation; therefore, the
  uptake of unsaturated FAs is particularly enhanced. FAs are rapidly incorporated
  into cellular triglycerides (TGs) that enhance TG and lipid droplet (LD) accumulation.
  c Under nutrient and lipid restriction cancer cells mainly rely on endogenous FAs
  and desaturation. d When hypoxia is induced in combination with nutrient and lipid
  deprivation, cells cannot acquire FAs from the environment. Hence, they switch back
  to de novo FA synthesis, but fully depend on glutamine or acetate as an alternative
  substrate. Parts (b), (c) and (d) are drawn in comparison to the normoxic state
  depicted in (a). The line thickness represents the level of flux through the pathway.
  Dashed lines indicate biosynthetic pathways that are inactive due to lack of substrates
  or cofactors. The colours of the pathway boxes in (b), (c) and (d) represent upregulation
  (green), downregulation (grey) or differential regulation (green/grey) of the corresponding
  pathway in comparison to the normoxic state (with sufficient nutrient supply) in
  (a)
