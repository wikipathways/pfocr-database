caption: Metabolic regulation of pleotropic autophagy. One mechanism that may contribute
  to the differential effects of autophagy on aging phenotypes is metabolism of S-adenosyl
  methionine (SAM). The enzyme nicotinamide N-methyl-transferase (NNMT) methylates
  nicotinamide (NAM) to N-methylnicotinamide (MNA) SAM as the methyl group donor.
  This reduced cellular concentration of SAM precludes it from functioning in the
  LCMT1/PP2A/NPRL2 pathway, that in turn regulates autophagy. Thus, the relative expression
  levels of enzymes like NNMT during aging can influence autophagy with have profound
  effects on neuronal function and survival. Created with BioRender.com.
