caption: Schematic illustration of the role that estrogens play in mitochondrial bioenergetics.
  Estrogen affects mitochondria bioenergetics through two different pathways. In a
  genomic pathway, estrogen binds to estrogen receptor (ER)α or ERβ, which induces
  dimerization of the receptors and translocation of the whole complex to the nucleus.
  In the nucleus, the dimer of the receptors binds to estrogen response elements (ERE)
  and affects transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. ERα and ERβ have
  been shown to localize in mitochondria, but it is yet unclear if the complex can
  directly regulate transcription of mtDNA-encoded genes. The “nongenomic pathway”
  involves rapid activation of various kinases (for instance, MAPK or phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase) by membrane-associated ERs, which in turn can affect mitochondrial function.
  Both ER-associated pathways regulate different parameters of mitochondrial bioenergetics,
  such as biogenesis, energy balance, antioxidant capacity, formation and stability
  of the mitochondria transition pore (mPTP), ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  production, and Ca2+ handling, all of which are important for renal physiology,
  and especially so in disease states.
