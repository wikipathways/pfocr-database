caption: The figure illustrates the mechanism by which kaempferol enhances sensitivity
  to anti-digestive system tumor drugs. Kaempferol plays a crucial role in overcoming
  5-Fluorouracil resistance by regulating the miR-326-hnRNPA1/A2/PTBP1-PKM2 axis.
  It inhibits 5-Fluorouracil resistance through the modulation of JAK/STAT3, MAPK,
  PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB expression. When combined with TRAIL, kaempferol upregulates
  the expression of TRAIL receptors DR5 and DR4, leading to induced apoptosis in tumor
  cells. Additionally, kaempferol enhances the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells
  to Erlotinib by inhibiting the EGFR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Furthermore,
  in combination with Doxorubicin, kaempferol suppresses the migration and invasion
  of liver cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/mTOR/MMP signaling pathway
