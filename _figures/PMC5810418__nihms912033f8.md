caption: Large Wnt Pathway solutions. (a) The shortest acyclic B-hyperpath in the
  signaling hypergraph, and (b) the same B-hypergraph organized by cellular compartment
  (hyperedges from s not shown). (c) The Steiner tree in the graph with complexes
  connecting s to TCF1 and LEF1 terminals. The Steiner tree was comprised of two of
  the five shortest paths in the graph with complexes representation ().
