caption: IFN-γ stimulates protection in nonlymphocytes against T. gondii infection.
  (A) GKS and GBP pathways in mouse embryo fibroblast cells (MEFs). IFN-γ stimulation
  up-regulates the expression of the glycine-lysine-serine motif containing immunity-related
  GTPase (GKS) proteins and guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs). GKS is activated via
  dimerization/oligomerization and translocated on the parasitophorous vacuole (PV)
  membrane (), which induces ubiquitination (U) of the PV (). Further, GKS recruits
  GBP on the PV membrane (, ), which inhibits growth of the parasite (, , ). Autophage
  proteins (ATG) are required for GKS and GBP recruitment although the mechanism is
  uncertain (). (B) NO pathway in mouse mesenchymal stromal cells (mMSCs). IFN-γ,
  tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and interleukin 1β (IL1β) could induce inducible
  nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but IFN-γ alone is not sufficient (). iNOS consumes
  l-arginine and produces nitric oxide (NO), which inhibits the growth of parasites.
  (C) IDO pathway and an unknown pathway in human foreskin fibroblast cells (HEFs).
  IFN-γ up-regulates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO), which results in depletion
  of l-tryptophan (Trp) and thus causes nutrition restriction of the parasites ().
  Alternatively, an unknown pathway stimulates host cell death in response to the
  early egress of parasite (, ). (D) GBP pathway and IDO pathway in human mesenchymal
  stromal cells (hMSCs). The GBP pathway in hMSCs is functional in a similar manner
  to that in MEF cells, but GKS proteins were not identified in humans. An unknown
  factor (?) is yet to be revealed that may replace the GKS pathway. Alternatively,
  the IDO pathway may also be involved (), but this involvement was not observed in
  our study.
