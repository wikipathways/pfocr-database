caption: Model expressing the distinct molecular pathways of ER transcription factors
  regulatory actions. (A) The classical direct, genomic ligand-dependent pathway includes
  detachment of transcription factors—Estrogen receptors (ER) from complex with heat
  shock proteins (HSP) and shift of E2-ER complex towards estrogen response element
  (ERE), localized in nucleus, where transcription is triggered after recruitment
  of coactivators (CoA) and corepressors (CoR) of transcription process []. (B) Non-direct
  genomic ligand-dependent mechanism—Tethering or cross-talk includes protein-protein
  interaction with other transcription factors (TF) after ligand activation, and thereby
  gene regulation is affected by indirect DNA binding []. (C) Estrogen receptors can
  be phosphorylated at specific serine sites by growth factors (GF) and other plasma
  membrane estrogen receptors, coupled to kinase signaling (ERK-extracellular regulated
  kinase, Akt—Protein kinase B, PI3K—Phosphoinositide 3-kinase). Phosphorylated (P)
  ER can trigger the transcription in a ligand-independent manner []. (D) The non-genomic
  effect includes the activation of receptor, associated with the membrane receptors
  including G-protein-coupled receptor (GPER). Signaling through GPER occurs via transactivation
  of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activated by metalloproteinases (MMP).
  This phenomenon leads to downstream activation of various signaling molecules, triggering
  possible alterations in protein synthesis. Furthermore, cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) and intracellular calcium mobilization (Ca++) are stimulated by E2-mediated
  activation of GPER. This leads to rapid physiological responses without gene regulation.
  Moreover, GPER also regulates transcriptional activity by other signaling mechanisms
  as cAMP, ERK or PI3K [].
