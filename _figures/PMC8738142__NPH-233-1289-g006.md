caption: A working model of the MoErv29‐mediated secretion pathway in Magnaporthe
  oryzae. (a) MoErv29 functions as a coat protein complex II (COPII) cargo receptor
  that binds to the amino‐terminal tripeptide motifs of effector proteins (after removal
  of signal peptide sequences) with different affinities, enabling prioritisation
  of their exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The optimal contribution of that
  residue to binding affinity was a proline in the number 2 position and a hydrophobic
  residue in positions 1 (amino terminus) and 3. High‐affinity occurred when matches
  were found in all three positions, while modest affinity was found when two positions
  matched, and low‐affinity was found when only one position matched. (b) During infection,
  M. oryzae secretes large numbers of effector proteins to manipulate plant immunity.
  The apoplastic effectors are secreted through a conventional process via the ER‐to‐Golgi
  pathway. Here, MoErv29 functions as a COPII cargo receptor that binds to the amino‐terminal
  tripeptide motifs of effector proteins with different affinities. The secreted process
  is regulated by the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway transcription activator
  MoHac1 that controls the expression level of MoErv29. ROS, reactive oxygen species.
