caption: 'Sirtuins and B lymphocytes. B lymphocyte development begins in the fetal
  liver or bone marrow and continues in the periphery. B-1 and B-2 B lymphocytes differentiate
  into ASCs by distinct pathways. The origin of Breg cells is still not precise. Despite
  the role of SIRTs in healthy B lymphocytes have not been adequately investigated,
  some studies have described some functions in a disease context. SIRT1 and 2 inhibition
  are essential to treat CLL, although other studies show that SIRT1 is important
  at some point of ASCs differentiation. Moreover, since AMPK-mTORC1 axis regulates
  GC reactions and antibody production, it suggests that SIRT1 (or SIRT3/4) also coordinate
  this process. Glutaminolysis was shown to be an essential metabolic pathway to enhance
  proliferation of Burkitt lymphoma-derived B lymphocytes. Thus, SIRT3 and 4 might
  play roles in the pathogenesis by activating or inhibiting, respectively, the GDH
  activity. Additionally, HIF-1α was shown to be essential to IL-10-producing Bregs
  development, suggesting that SIRT1/3/6 are downregulated in these populations. The
  question marks indicate speculative roles of SIRTs. AMPK: AMP-activated protein
  kinase; ASCs: Antibody-secreting cells; B: B lymphocytes; BCR: B cell receptor;
