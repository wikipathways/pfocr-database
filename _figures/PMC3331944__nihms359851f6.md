caption: (A) Binding of anti-ICAM carriers to ICAM-1 at cholesterol and SM-rich areas
  of the EC plasmalemma results in recruitment of NHE1, which then interacts with
  ICAM-1. (B) Binding of carriers to ICAM-1 also induces redistribution of ASM from
  intracellular compartments to the EC surface. H+ extrusion by NHE1 at sites of ICAM-1
  engagement creates a pH microenvironment optimal for ASM activity, where SM is hydrolyzed
  to ceramide (Cer). (C) Ceramide induces rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton,
  and favors the formation of endothelial engulfment structures and endocytic vesicles
  at these sites. (D) Uptake of anti-ICAM carriers by cell adhesion molecule- (CAM)-mediated
  endocytosis occurs.
