caption: Phosphorylation of Foxo1 at S253 by Akt promotes Foxo1 cytoplasmic retention
  and ubiquitination, which serves as a central mechanism controlling Foxo1 stability
  and activity (). However, Foxo1 can also be phosphorylated at different serine or
  threonine residues by other protein kinases, enhancing transcriptional activity.
  For example, mammalian sterile 20-like kinase-1 (MST1) promotes Foxo1 phosphorylation
  at S212, which promotes neuronal cell apoptosis () or anti-oxidative stress responses,
  extending lifespan in C. elegans (). In addition to the phosphorylation-based pathway,
  Foxo1 activity can also be regulated by other post-translational modifications,
  including methylation, glycosylation, and acetylation ().
