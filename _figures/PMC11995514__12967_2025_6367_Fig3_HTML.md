caption: 'The core mechanism of pyrotosis and related kinases affect the signaling
  pathway. Pyroptosis is initiated when cytoplasmic sensor proteins, specifically
  members of the NOD-like receptor family (NLRP1, NLRP3, and NLRP4), recruit and activate
  CASPASE1 through ASC in response to PAMPs or DAMPs. This process leads to the secretion
  of the precursor interleukin IL-1β. Subsequently, the high mobility group box 1
  protein (HMGB1) facilitates the cleavage and production of GSDMD-N, which triggers
  pyroptotic cell death by activating both canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes.
  Additionally, the release of GZMB by T cells can transiently stimulate caspase-3
  in leukemia cells, resulting in the pyroptosis of GSDME. Lymphocyte-derived GZMA
  hydrolyzes GSDMB at the Lys229/Lys244 sites, leading to the pyroptotic death of
  tumor cells. TNFR activation induces pyroptosis of GSDMC via caspase-8. Furthermore,
  JAK2 interacts with the STAT3 transcription factor, phosphorylating the Y705 residue
  of STAT3, which promotes its dimerization and nuclear translocation. This activation
  enhances STAT3’s transcriptional activity and the expression of its target genes.
  Inhibition of the EGFR further enhances apoptosis induced by AE-PDT through the
  mitochondrial pathway, while also promoting AE-PDT-mediated focal cell death by
  modulating the caspase-1/GSDMD axis. Given that JAK2-STAT3 signaling is frequently
  upregulated in aggressive breast cancer and is associated with poor clinical outcomes,
  this pathway represents a significant target for cancer drug development. Moreover,
  JNK, a critical component of the serine/threonine MAPK signaling pathway, inhibits
  MFHAS1 to induce pyroptosis in human breast cancer cells by promoting JNK phosphorylation
  and activating the downstream NF-κB/caspase-1/GSDMD signaling cascade. (Red: Tyrosine
  kinase; Yellow: Serine-threonine kinases.)'
