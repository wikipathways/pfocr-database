caption: 'Schematic representation of the role of extracellular vesicles and tumour‐secreted
  factors in establishing pre‐metastatic niche and osteolytic/osteoblastic metastatic
  outgrowth in the bone. Primary tumour‐derived molecular components including tumour‐derived
  secreted factors and EVs play important roles in the modulation of the bone microenvironment,
  thus promoting metastasis. Prior to the arrival of tumour cells in the bone, EVs
  can facilitate the establishment of a pre‐metastatic niche in the bone via mechanisms
  such as the transfer of MET to BMDCs. (a) On establishing a foothold in the bone
  marrow niche, the osteolytic cancer cells (e.g. from breast cancer) secrete growth
  factors and cytokines that act on osteoclasts and osteoblasts in the bone microenvironment,
  such as PTHrP, VEGF, IL‐1, IL‐6, PGE2, TNF‐α, ET‐1 and BMPs. These factors increase
  the production of M‐CSF and RANKL, an osteoclast differentiating factor, while decreasing
  OPG (an osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor) secretion from osteoblasts. The up‐regulated
  RANKL binds to its receptor RANK on the pre‐osteoclast surface and promotes the
  maturation of osteoclast precursors into functional osteoclasts and thus, osteolytic
  activation. Tumour cells also secrete osteolytic factors, most of which act via
  osteoblast RANKL, that further stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption. Bone resorption
  causes the release of PDGFs, BMPs, TGF‐β, IGF‐1 and calcium ions that in turn promote
  cancer cell proliferation, enable continued expression of osteoclast initiating
  factors and eventually perpetuate a cycle of osteolytic macrometastatic outgrowth.
  (b) Osteoblastic cancer cells (e.g. from prostate cancer) that have migrated to
  the bone, adapt to and modify the surrounding microenvironment by secreting osteoblast‐promoting
  molecules which increase osteoblast differentiation and proliferation including
  uPA, TGF‐β, VEGF, BMPs, TNF‐α, IGF‐1, Wnt1, WNT3A, ET‐1, PTHrP and adrenomedullin.
  Activation of the Wnt pathway and the decreased expression of the Wnt antagonist
  DKK‐1 stimulates osteoblast activity. In turn, enhanced osteoblast activity drives
  tumour progression by releasing IGF‐1, IL‐6 and IL‐8. Osteoclast activity is also
  activated in a predominantly osteoblastic lesion through osteoblast‐mediated osteoclastogenesis
  governed by the increased osteoblastic expression of RANKL and M‐CSF. Accelerated
  bone matrix degradation promotes the release of growth factors that further enrich
  the local milieu. Abbreviations: VCAM1, Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1; CXCL12,
