caption: Amino acid pathways rewired in cancer. Illustration depicting amino acid
  pathways linked in an intricate metabolic network. Essential amino acids, including
  the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are imported
  from the extracellular environment, in part via the LAT1 (SLC7A5) transporter. Glutamine
  (Gln) can be conditionally essential and is imported through ASCT2 (SLC1A5). Glutaminase
  enzymes (GLS1/2) convert glutamine to glutamate (Glu), which can further be converted
  to alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) to enter the TCA cycle. The TCA cycle also generates
  intermediates, which give rise to non-essential amino acids, including aspartate
  and arginine. The de novo synthesis of arginine involves the conversion of citrulline
  to aspartate by argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1). TCA-cycle derived aspartate
  is converted to asparagine via ASNS, and GOT1 can convert aspartate to glutamate,
  which is further converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase (GS). Serine, another
  non-essential amino acid, can be imported or synthesized de novo in the serine biosynthesis
  pathway (SBP), which diverts the 3P-glycerate (3PG) intermediate of glycolysis to
  generate serine via the enzymes, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), phosphoserine
  aminotransferase (PSAT1), and phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH). Serine can further
  be converted to glycine by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) (cytosolic SHMT1
  isozyme shown above) to generate one-carbon units to fuel the folate cycle and the
  methionine cycles. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in the folate cycle catalyzes
  the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate (THF). Cysteine is another non-essential
  amino acid that can be synthesized in the transsulfuration pathway or imported as
  cystine via the cystine/glutamate antiporter, system xC-. The SBP, transsulfuration
  pathway, along with ASS1 and glutamine metabolism have been implicated in sarcoma
  biology. Figure was created with BioRender.com.
