caption: Agonism on cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1r) by 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG),
  N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA) and eicosapentaenoyl
  ethanolamide (EPEA) is able to desensitize transient receptor potential cation channel
  subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) (yellow arrow) and, via the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR)/MAPK, to promote human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) migration
  and proliferation (violet pathway). The activation of transient receptor potential
  vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) elicit TAK1-JNK1 signaling cascade, which in turn is responsible
  for the promotion of tissue immune infiltration, fibrosis and neovascularization
  (blue pathway).
