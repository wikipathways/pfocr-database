caption: Schematic diagram of the formation and function of the mitochondrial complex
  I. NDUFS4 is synthesized in the nucleus and transported to the cell cytosol. In
  the cytosol, PKA can phosphorylate it before it is transported into the mitochondria
  (not shown) or NDUFS4 is transported into the mitochondrial cytosol where it is
  phosphorylated by PKA. NDUFS4 then assists in the assembly of the mitochondrial
  complex I. The mitochondrial complex I can then oxidize NADH to 2NAD, transferring
  electrons via an electron chain to Ubiquinone (Q). Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) is
  the entry point for electrons from NADH; electrons are then transferred to iron–sulfur
  clusters with several different enzymes involved. The pathway of electron transport
  is indicated by the blue arrows. Ubiquinone is the final electron acceptor and is
  then reduced by coenzyme Q (coQ) to ubiquinol (QH2) [,]. Image created by DA Gomes
