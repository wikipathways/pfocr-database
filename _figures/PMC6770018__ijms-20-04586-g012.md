caption: 'A molecular regulatory hypothesis of the dmc. Red: up-regulated; green:
  down-regulated compared to WT. Lower photosynthesis from the leaves produces fewer
  energy substances for transport to tiller nodes (). Differentially expressed miRNAs
  regulated their target genes in the carbohydrate metabolism pathway and resulted
  in lower sugar content in tiller nodes ( and ). Differentially expressed miRNAs
  also regulate transcription factor genes such as SPL, GRF, and plant hormone metabolism
  genes, such as ARF and A-ARR (). Transcription factors, in turn, regulate other
  metabolisms such as carbohydrate and plant hormone metabolism pathways. In the end,
  the key substances that guarantee normal wheat tillering are in significant deficit,
  such as plant hormones IAA and ZA, soluble sugars, and proteins. These are the major
  factors restraining tillering in dmc.'
