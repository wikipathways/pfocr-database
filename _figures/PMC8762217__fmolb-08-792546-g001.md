caption: 'Endogenous activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and its regulation through
  natural inhibitors. PIASs act mainly by suppressing STAT-regulated gene expression
  and inhibiting STAT binding to DNA. Hyperactivation of the JAK-STAT pathway also
  activates its own negative feedback regulators: SOCS proteins. SOCS1 and SOCS3 inhibit
  signaling by different mechanisms: SOCS1 forms a binary complex with JAKs (phosphorylated
  or unphosphorylated) and inhibits their catalytic activity; SOCS3 inhibits JAK activity
  through the formation of a ternary complex, binding simultaneously to the cytokine
  receptor and JAKs. Cavin-1 and CUEDC2 inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway by interacting
  with SOCS1,3 via an SH2 domain PEST sequence.'
