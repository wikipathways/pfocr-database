caption: 'Model depicting the role of OPN in tumor immune microenvironment (TIME):
  (A) Role of OPN in shaping immunosuppressive TME: tumor-derived OPN activates stromal
  cells by trans-differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, resulting in expansion
  of tumor. OPN-regulated PD-1/PDL1 interaction inhibits T-cell activation. Further,
  tumor cells downregulate the expression of IRF8, resulting in overexpression of
  OPN, thus leading to T-cell suppression. OPN, via the NF-κB pathway, upregulates
  PD-L1 expression, aiding in immune therapy escape. OPN induces the polarization
  of macrophages and the recruitment of monocytes. It activates TAM, leading to angiogenesis,
  metastasis and enrichment of CSCs via upregulation of various tumor-promoting factors
  such as MMP-9, N-cadherin, vimentin, ICAM-1, COX-2, PGE-2, VEGF, Sox-2, Oct-3/4,
  Nanog and ALDH. The polarity ratio of CXCL9 and OPN (SPP1) determines the anti-
  and pro-tumorigenic properties of TAMs. (B) Involvement of OPN in tumor immunity
  continuum: OPN is primarily associated with inflamed and immune-excluded tumors,
  whereas its role in immune-desert tumor remains elusive. (C) Schematic representations
  to identify OPN-regulated immune cell heterogeneity in cancer: OPN-regulated immune
  modulatory genes may be identified in TIME by CRISPR technology in breast cancer
  using scRNA-seq based platform'
