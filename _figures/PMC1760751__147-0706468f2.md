caption: Development of the intracellular signalling mechanisms involved in smooth
  muscle contraction and relaxation, between 1975 and 2005. In 1975 (a), acetylcholine
  (ACh) activated a muscarinic receptor (M) in the smooth muscle cell membrane, causing
  a rise in the intracellular concentration of free calcium and hence contraction
  of the smooth muscle. After 30 years (b), this simple pathway has at least six identified
  components (blue arrows) and there are other, separate, pathways (such as those
  initiated through G12/13, yellow arrows) that influence the final cellular response.
  Note that PKA and PKG (red arrows) exert inhibition of both the Gq/11/PLC (blue)
  pathway and the G12/13/Rho (yellow) pathway. M3, M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor;
  PLC, phospholipase C; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, protein kinase A; PKG, protein
  kinase G; Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate; CaM, calmodulin; CPI-17,
  smooth muscle-specific phosphopeptide; MLC, myosin light chain; MLCK, myosin light
  chain kinase; MLCP, myosin light chain phosphatase; HSP-20, heat shock protein 20.
