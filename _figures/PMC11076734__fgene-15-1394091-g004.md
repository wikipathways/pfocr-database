caption: Schematic representation of PINs-mediated auxin transport regulation during
  salt stress. Responses to salt treatment involve different pathways that regulate
  the expression of PINs to modulate auxin distribution in roots. Arrows indicate
  positive regulation, and T-bars indicate negative regulation
