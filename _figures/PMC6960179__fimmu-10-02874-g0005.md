caption: Molecular evidence of inflammatory response and resolution of inflammation
  during MAP infection. In the context of infection, the presence of MAP and/or its
  associated PAMP in the extracellular space is recognized at the plasma membrane
  of macrophage by TLR2, TLR4, TREM1, and mannose receptors. The TLRs and mannose
  receptor induce the MAP phagocytosis. The activation of canonical NF-κB pathway
  depends on the IKK complex, which contains two catalytic subunits (IKKα and IKKβ)
  and a regulatory subunit/IKBKγ (alias NEMO). Ubiquitination of IKBKγ activates these
  two associated kinase enzymes. Catalytically active IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα, signaling
  its ubiquitination toward its proteasomal degradation allowing the p65/p50 NF-kB
  heterodimer to translocate into the nucleus and to bind specific recognition sequences
  in genes (referred to as kB sites) to modulate transcription. Tight control of the
  IKK complex fate is controlled by numerous members. Members of the pro-inflammatory
  NFκB pathway (represented in blue) are activated by the TLR signaling with the help
  of IRAK proteins like IRAK2. Many genes that encode inhibitor (represented in red)
  of the NFκB pathway were upregulated and contribute to the resolution of the inflammation
  by avoiding overactivation of the NFκB pathway. Detection of intracellular MAP by
  the complex NOD2-RIP2 contributes to release NOD2. In turn, RIP2 contributes to
  the ubiquitination of IKKγ and SOCS3 induced by NOD2 activation, which further facilitates
  its degradation process and thus limiting NOD2 sensing capability. As TNF was greatly
  upregulated during infection, TNFα might activate TNF pathway that in turn supports
  linear ubiquitination between RIP1 and IKKγ, which are regulated by the inhibitor
  TNIP2. IRAK3 is a downstream negative effector of TLR signaling. The TLR activation
  triggers the p38/MAPK signaling that impacts the PI3K activation of anti-inflammatory
  (represented in purple) AKT signaling and STAT3 signaling. TREM1 pathway is involved
  in the innate inflammatory response to microbial infections and amplifies the TLR-mediated
  inflammation signaling pathway. In addition, TREM1 pathway induced the activation
  of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) inflammasome. While the translocation of p65/p50
  NF-kB heterodimer specifically upregulated NFκB target genes, overexpression of
  transcription silencers p50 homodimer stabilized in the Bcl3 complex negatively
  controls NFκB target genes. Several genes associated with the formation of foam
  cells were upregulated and may support the foamy phenotype observed in MAP-infected
  macrophages. The significant upregulation observed in RNA-seq of the genes associated
  to the proteins represented is indicated by a green arrow.
