caption: ' Acetylation in IBD. Butyrate produced by bacteria increases the acetylation
  of histones, which in turn regulates T cells. A series of Th17-related genes are
  significantly downregulated, and the NF-‍κB signaling pathway is inhibited, thereby
  alleviating IBD; MIMP increases the expression of HDACs, inhibiting histone acetylation,
  the transcription of IL-6 and other inflammatory factors, and TLR-4 related signaling
  pathways. Norepinephrine and adrenaline promote the acetylation of histones at the
  IL-1β gene promoter, leading to an abnormal increase in IL-1β expression; SMAD7
  is highly acetylated on lysine residues and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation
  is inhibited; SMAD7 binds to the TGF-β1 receptor and inhibits its signal transduction.
  IBD: inflammatory bowel disease; Th17: T helper 17; NF-‍κB: nuclear factor-‍κB;
  MIMP: micro integral membrane protein; HDAC: histone deacetylase; IL: interleukin;
  TLR-4: Toll-like receptor-4; SMAD7: recombinant mothers against decapentaplegic
  homolog 7; ROR: retinoic acid receptor (RAR)‍-related orphan receptor; TGF-β: transforming
  growth factor-β.'
