caption: Activation of the non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome involves interferon-inducible
  caspase-11. Induction of IFN-β expression by Gram-negative bacteria relies on activation
  of endosomal/phagosomal TLR4 and the signaling pathway downstream of the adaptor
  TRIF. Secreted IFN-β then activates IFNAR, notably in an autocrine manner, which
  promotes expression of pro-caspase-11 and additional IFN-inducible proteins such
  as GBPs. Caspase-11 is activated by direct binding of intracellular LPS, released
  from the phagosomes, to the CARD domain of caspase-11. GBPs are recruited to the
  phagosome and participate in phagosomal lysis and release of LPS in the cytoplasm.
  Active caspase-11 directly cleaves Gasdermin D to induce pyroptosis, and also leads
  to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via uncharacterized mechanisms.
