caption: Schematic view of the life cycle of SNJ1. (i) SNJ1 proviral genome resides
  in J7-1 cytoplasm as plasmid pHH205 with relative copy numbers 1 to 3. ORF4 represses
  the expression of the lytic pathway genes, presumably by binding to the viral DNA
  as a dimer, thus maintains SNJ1 in the lysogenic state. (ii to v) Upon MMC treatment,
  ORF4 was inactivated by an unknown mechanism, resulting in expression of the lytic
  pathway genes and replication of viral genome by the RepA protein. Host cells are
  lysed, and assembled progeny viruses are released into supernatant. (vi to x) Released
  SNJ1 viruses infect CJ7 either by entering the lysogenic state as a plasmid or by
  replicating actively in a process controlled by ORF4. (xi) A lysogen of SNJ1 (J7-1)
  was immune to superinfection of SNJ1 because ORF4 represses replication of the ejected
  gDNA.
