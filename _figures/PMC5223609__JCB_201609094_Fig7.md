caption: 'A model for App function in Ft signaling. Ft activity in repressing Dachs
  is regulated by two opposing posttranslational modifications: phosphorylation mediated
  by Dco and palmitoylation mediated by App. Dco phosphorylates and activates Ft.
  App suppresses Ft activity in part by palmitoylation and in part by recruiting Dachs
  to the AJR through forming a protein complex. Active Ft represses growth by preventing
  Dachs localization to the AJR. C, cysteine residue; P, phosphorylation.'
papertitle: The palmitoyltransferase Approximated promotes growth via the Hippo pathway
  by palmitoylation of Fat.
