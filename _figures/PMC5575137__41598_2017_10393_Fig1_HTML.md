caption: 'Production of anti ß-sheet secondary structure conformational monoclonal
  antibodies with specificity to oligomeric toxic conformers present in neurodegenerative
  diseases (NDD). (A) Color coded pathways to oligomeric forms and fibrillar deposits
  of self-antigenic protein/peptides associated with pathology on most common NDD:
  Aß (red) and tau (brown) for Alzheimer’s Disease; α-synuclein (orange) for Lewy
  Body diseases, and PrP (grey) for prionoses. Black shape represents common to all
  ß-sheet secondary structure acquired during pathological conformational change.
  Electron microscopy (EM) of oligomers and fibrils on the left and immunoblots of
  oligomeric forms detected by specific antibodies on the right, all color coded (also
  in Figs ,  and ). (B) One letter code of the 13 amino acids sequence of the non-self
  ABri peptide (purple boxed). Bottom pathway shows the normal conversion of ABri
  peptides to oligomers and fibrils (purple). Top pathway shows the controlled polymerized
  reaction with glutaraldehyde (see methods) leading to p13Bri the immunogenic, non-self,
  soluble and stable ß-sheet oligomers of 10–100 kDa molecular weight (from purple
  to green frame). Black shapes represent common to all ß-sheet structure. On the
  left, EM of the oligomeric p13Bri (green frame) and the oligomer/fibrils of the
  aged ABri peptide (purple frame). On the right Immunoblot with rabbit polyclonal
  anti-Bri and circular dichroism analysis of both forms (color coded and also in
  Supplementary Fig. ). (C) The p13Bri (green boxed) inoculated into mice to produce
  hybridomas (Methods and Table ); horizontal blue arrows show the selection process
  of monoclonals by the oligomeric β-sheet conformers of (A) antigens (thick black
  frame and arrow); framed in blue the selected anti-conformational monoclonal antibodies
  that recognize ß-sheet secondary structure common to (A) and (B) pathways. The thick
  blue arrows from the framed blue antibodies signal possible interactive sites with
  pathological conformers on NDD (also in Figs ,  and ).'
