caption: Mechanisms of Lp(a)-induced CAVD. Schematic diagram depicts the mechanism
  of Lp(a)-induced CAVD. The main pathophysiological processes involving Lp(a) in
  CAVD include endothelial dysfunction, indirect promotion of foam cell formation
  through OxPL, valvular calcification and so on. Valvular calcification of VICs plays
  an important role in the occurrence and development of Lp(a)-mediated CAVD. This
  process of phenotypic transformation is mainly including the Notch signal pathway
  and NF-κB receptor activator pathway, and is also partially mediated by inflammation,
  oxidative stress, and the Wnt signal pathway. OxPL, oxidized phospholipids; Lp(a),
  lipoprotein (a); ATX, autotaxin; Lp-PLA2, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2;
  MCP-1, monocyte-macrophage chemoattractant protein-1; CCR2, C-C chemokine receptor
  type 2; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; LysoPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPAR, lysophospholipid
  receptor; GLUT1, glucose transporter type 1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1;
  ICAM1-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; IL-6, interleukin 6; BMP-2, bone morphogenetic
  protein-2; IKKα, IkappaB kinase-alpha; TLR,; Toll-like receptor; VECs, endothelial
  cells; VICs, valvular interstitial cells.
