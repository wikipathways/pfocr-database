caption: ceRNA Network of m6A-modified circRNAs in OSA-induced Cardiac Injury. The
  ceRNA network demonstrates the interactions between m6A-modified circRNAs, miRNAs,
  and their target mRNAs in the context of OSA-induced myocardial injury. Key circRNAs
  identified, including mmu_circRNA_22543, mmu_circRNA_29768, and mmu_circRNA_34841,
  are shown in the network, interacting with miR-5134-5p, miR-1896, and other miRNAs.
  These miRNAs regulate downstream target genes such as Clip2, Fadd, and Hacd2, which
  are involved in myocardial injury and heart disease pathways. The figure highlights
  the potential regulatory role of these circRNAs in modulating gene expression through
  miRNA sponging, impacting key cellular processes like inflammation and fibrosis
  in OSA-induced cardiac injury. The arrows represent direct interactions, with color
  coding indicating the strength of correlation, and the size of nodes indicating
  the importance of each gene in the network
