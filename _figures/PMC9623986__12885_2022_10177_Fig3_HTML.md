caption: Activation schemes of KEGG Bladder cancer Main Pathway (a-c) and NCI p73
  transcription factor network Pathway apoptosis and DNA repair (d-f) in experimental
  (ad), TCGA (be) and Syn2623706 (cf.) CRC samples. Color indicates log10-transformed
  ratio of mean gene expression values in patients with poor prognosis normalized
  on gene expression in patients with favorable prognosis. Bold margins indicate most
  strongly up/downregulated nodes. Patients were divided into poor and favorable prognosis
  groups by median survival for experimental and TCGA datasets. Because median survival
  was undefined for Syn2623706 dataset, poor and favorable prognosis was determined
  relatively median of survival time for non-censored patients
