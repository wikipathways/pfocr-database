caption: The serine synthesis pathway (SSP) uses glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate
  (3-PG) in three sequential reactions to generate serine. First, phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase (PHGDH) catalyses the NAD+-dependent oxidation of 3-PG to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate
  (3-PHP). Second, phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) converts 3-PHP into 3-phosphoserine
  (3-PS) in a glutamate-dependent transamination reaction. Third, phosphoserine phosphatase
  (PSPH) generates serine through hydrolysis of 3-PS. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT) converts serine into glycine by donating a one-carbon (1C) unit to tetrahydrofolate
  (THF). Glycine functions as a precursor for glutathione. Folate is reduced to dihydrofolate
  (DHF) and THF through dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-mediated NADPH-dependent reactions.
  THF serves as a carrier of 1C unit through the folate cycle. The folate cycle contributes
  to mitochondrial protein synthesis, NADPH regeneration and nucleotide synthesis.
  The folate cycle is coupled with the methionine cycle that generates the universal
  methyl-donor SAM for the methylation of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids and provides
  cysteine, a precursor of glutathione. Tryptophan, choline, sarcosine, glycine and
  formate can all generate 1C units
