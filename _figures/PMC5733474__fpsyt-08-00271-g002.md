caption: Enriched PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  based on 300 differentially expressed genes (nominal P values < 0.05) detected exclusively
  in both week 8 and week 12 topiramate (TPM) groups. Symbols with a single border
  indicate single genes. Those with a double border indicate complexes of genes or
  the possibility that alternative genes might act in the pathway. Red color symbols
  indicate upregulated gene clusters, and green color symbols represent downregulated
  gene clusters. At both time points, GYS1, HSP90B1, NFKBIE, PPP2R5D, RRAS, and TP53
  were consistently downregulated, and PTEN was consistently upregulated. If a gene
  was detected by both the ordinary Student’s t-test and the empirical Bayes moderated
  t-test in either the week 8 TPM group or week 12 TPM group, that gene’s corresponding
  symbol was highlighted in bold font.
