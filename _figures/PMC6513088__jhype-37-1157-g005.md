caption: Proposed altered metabolic pathway in the black group. The lower glucose
  levels along with the higher pyruvate and alanine levels may indicate increased
  flux through the glycolysis pathway. One of the intermediates of the glycolysis
  pathway, 3-phosphoglycerate can be used to actively synthesize serine (more abundant
  in the black group) and during one-carbon-metabolism serine acts as an one-carbon
  donor to the folate cycle, during which 1,5-methylene tetrahydrofolate and glycine
  (higher in the black group) are formed. In turn, the folate cycle is coupled to
  the methionine cycle in which both methionine and dimethylglycine was found to be
  more abundant in the black group. The methionine cycle is coupled to the transulfuration
  pathway leading to the formation of cysteine. Cysteine along with glutamate which
  can be synthesized from glutamine (more abundant in the black group) and glycine
  are involved in the synthesis of glutathione. Alternatively, if not used for glutathione
  synthesis glutamate can be converted to proline and upon hydroxylation 4-hydroxyproline
  is formed. Both glycine and 4-hydroxyproline are important for collagen biosynthesis
  and stability. Metabolites in blue and red text indicate lower and higher abundance
  respectively. SAH, S-adenosyl-homocysteine; SAM, S-adenosyl methionine; THF, tetrahydrofolate.
