caption: Schematic representation of the NGF metabolic pathway and its altered state
  in Alzheimer’s and Down syndrome pathology. (A) In the healthy brain, proNGF is
  co-released in the extracellular space with zymogens and convertases involved in
  its maturation and degradation. proNGF is cleaved to yield mNGF by plasmin, itself
  derived from the cleavage of plasminogen by tPA, a process regulated by neuroserpin.
  mNGF then dimerizes and binds to p75/TrkA receptor complexes on presynaptic terminals
  of BFCNs, followed by the retrograde transport of mNGF to their cell bodies in the
  basal forebrain. Receptor-unbound mNGF is rapidly degraded by MMP-9 and MMP-3, which
  are produced from their pro-proteins under the control of TIMP-1. (B) In Alzheimer’s
  disease and in Down syndrome brains, increased neuroserpin and decreased tPA lead
  to reductions in the maturation of proNGF to mNGF by limiting plasmin concentrations.
  Further, decreased TIMP-1 and increased MMP-3/MMP-9 result in the excessive degradation
  of unbound mNGF. These changes result in impaired trophic support to BFCNs, leading
  to their atrophy.
