caption: Schematic representation of mechanism of action of GW583340 in sensitive
  (a) and acquired resistance (b) IBC models. (1) GW583340 binds to and inhibits phosphorylation
  of ErbB1 and ErbB2 and subsequently decreases p-AKT expression in both sensitive
  and acquired resistance models [, , ]. However, in sensitive cells, GW583340 treatment
  causes an acute stress by increasing ROS (3), which in turn can increase AMPK activation
  (2) []. Both a substantial increase in ROS [] and activation of AMPK [, ] and changes
  in metabolism [] can independently lead to apoptosis of sensitive cells (4, 5).
  Treatment of sensitive cells in the presence of a SOD mimic can reverse this ROS-induced
  apoptosis (6). In contrast, cells with acquired GW583340 resistance have higher
  antioxidant expression (7) corresponding with no change in ROS accumulation or p-AMPK
  activation (9) in the presence of GW583340 and cell survival. Modulation of the
  redox pathway using 2-ME or DETC can sensitize these cells to ROS-generating agents(8)
