caption: The possibly mechanisms underlying dihydromyricetin (DMY) against sodium
  nitroprusside (SNP) in the HUVECs. DMY treatment activates PI3K/AKT/ FoxO3a pathway
  and subsequently drives FoxO3a out of nuclei, which inhibits apoptosis. SNP, a nitric
  oxide donor, creates oxidase stress and subsequently down‐regulates PI3K/AKT/FoxO3a
  pathway. Additionally, DMY may modulate others signal pathway such as mTOR, STAT3/NF‐κB
  to antiapoptosis in the HUVECs

  nitroprusside through activating PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a signalling pathway.
