caption: Ire1 signaling pathway. Ire1 exists as a BiP-bound monomer in the absence
  of ER stress. When unfolded proteins accumulate, BiP is released, and Ire1 forms
  homodimers that autophosphorylate and activate an endonuclease activity encoded
  in its C-terminus. Activated Ire1 removes 26 bases from the XBP1 transcript, which
  is relegated and now encodes a fully active transcription factor, XBP1(S). XBP1(S)
  transactivates a number of UPR targets and, later in the response, is negatively
  regulated via heterodimerization with the unspliced form of XBP1 [XBP1(U)]. (For
  interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred
