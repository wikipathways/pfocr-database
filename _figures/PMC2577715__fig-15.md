caption: 'The Notch, Wnt, and SHH signaling pathways. (A) Notch pathway: Ligands (Delta
  or Jagged) binding to the receptor trigger proteolytic cleavage by γ-secretase,
  resulting in release of intracellular domain of the receptor (NICO), which subsequently
  forms a complex with the transcription factor CSL and cofactor Mastermind-like (MAML)
  family to activate target-gene expression. (B) Wnt pathway: In the absence of Wnt
  ligand, β-catenin is complexed with a group of proteins, including adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC) and Axin, where it is phosphorylated by casein-kinase 1a (CK1a) and glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). On activation by the binding of Wnt ligand to the Frizzled
  and lipoprotein-related protein (LRP) receptors, Frizzled then binds to disheveled
  (Dsh), resulting in LRP phosphorylation, and Axin is translocated to the cell membrane.
  β-Catenin is accumulated and translocated to the nucleus and interacts with the
  T-cell factor (TCF) transcription factor (adapted from ref. ). (C) SHH pathway:
  the receptor of SHH is the tumor-suppressor gene product, PTCH, which represses
  the activation of smoothened (Smo). Binding of SHH releases this repressive effect
  on Smo by PTCH, activating glioblastoma transcription factor (Gli1, 2, or 3 family),
  which than activates the transcription of target genes.'
