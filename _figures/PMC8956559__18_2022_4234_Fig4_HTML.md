caption: Posttraumatic adipocyte dysfunction. After trauma, adipocytes are exposed
  to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs), released locally and from neighboring damaged tissues. DAMPs,
  PAMPs and free fatty acids (FFA) activate receptors on the adipocyte surface, such
  as toll-like receptors (TLR). Thus, proinflammatory pathways as the NF-κB signaling
  pathway are upregulated, resulting in production and secretion of proinflammatory
  interleukins (IL), high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF) and procoagulant factors such as tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator
  inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). These cytokines activate immune cells, aggravating the inflammatory
  response. The procoagulant state facilitates thrombus formation, worsening hypoxic
  conditions. Thus, aerobic pathways (e.g. fatty acid (FA) oxidation) are downregulated,
  whereas anaerobic pathways such as glycolysis are upregulated, resulting in the
  generation of lactate, which is shuttled outside the cell via monocarboxylate transporter
  1 (MCT-1), resulting in tissue acidosis. Hypoxia activates the hypoxia-induced 1
  factor (HIF-1) pathway, upregulating glucose uptake via glucose transporter (GLUT)
  1, and lactate release. Lipolysis is induced by epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine
  (NE) via β-receptors (βAR). After trauma, insulin sensitivity is impaired, further
  enhancing lipolysis and liberating FFA. By releasing complement factor D (CFD),
  adipocytes also activate the complement system, strengthening the posttraumatic
  response
