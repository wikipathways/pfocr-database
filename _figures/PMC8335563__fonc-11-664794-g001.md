caption: 'Conversion an ANNA in vivo from its pro-drug (Lamivudine) to the active
  triphosphate form (Lamivudine-TP). (A) The example of Lamivudine is shown and similar
  conversions take place for the other ANNAs. Left: Lamivudine in its pro-drug form.
  Right: Lamivudine triphosphate (Lamivudine-TP). Color codes: C, cream; N, blue;
  S, yellow; O, red; P, Orange. H´s are omitted for simplicity. The black arrows indicate
  three phosphorylation steps shown in red in (B). Constructed in Chimera. (B) Transport
  and metabolism of Lamivudine (3TC) inside the cells. 3TC is the pro-drug that may
  be transported inwards (blue arrows) through passive diffusion or active transporters
  SLC22A1, SLC22A2, and SLC22A3 (SC22, 1,2,3). In the nucleus, 3TC is phosphorylated
  sequentially (red arrows) by Deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) to form Lamivudine-monophosphate
  (3TC-P) and by UMP-CMP kinase (UCK) to form Lamivudine-diphosphate (3TC-DP). In
  the cytosol, Lamivudine-diphosphate (3TC-DP) is phosphorylated by Nucleoside diphosphate
  kinase A (NDK) or by Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) to form Lamivudine-Triphosphate
  (3TC-TP). These three phosphorylation steps involve the dephosphorylation of ATP
  to form ADP (orange boxes). The high ATP/ADP ratio inside the cells drives the overall
  reaction “forward” in the sense of Lamivudine-TP or 3TC-TP formation (red box).
  3TC-TP is the functional inhibitor of the viral (HIV and HBV) Reverse Transcriptase.
  On the other hand (left reactions) 3TC-TP and 3TC-P may be dephosphorylated by phosphatases
  (PPT), and by 5’(3’)-deoxyribonucleotidase (53D) to form 3TC-DP and 3TC, respectively,
  in “reverse” reactions. 3TC-TP may be metabolized (right side reactions) by Choline-phosphate
  cytidylyltransferase A (CPC) or by Ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EPC)
  to form Lamivudine-phosphate-choline (3TC-PC) or Lamivudine-diphosphate-ethanolamine
  (3TC-DPE), which are transformed to lamivudine-phosphate (3TC-P), with the former
  reaction catalyzed by Cholinephosphotransferase 1 (CPT) in the inner membranes of
  the Golgi apparatus. The extrusion of Lamivudine (3TC) and Lamivudine-phosphate
  (3TC-P) (blue outward arrows), can be achieved actively by one to six different
  multidrug resistance proteins or ABC transporters (ABC, 1–6). On the other hand,
  Lamivudine or 3TC may also be transformed to Lamivudine sulfoxide (3TC-SO) by Sulfotransferase
  1A1 (ST1), and 3TC-SO may be extruded by ABC transporters (blue discontinuous arrow).
  This figure was constructed according to the metabolism of Lamivudine as described
  in the references on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine (–), and from the link of
  metabolism and action pathway (https://smpdb.ca/search?q=Lamivudine). Other ANNAs
  are metabolized similarly from the prodrug to the functional triphosphate form.
