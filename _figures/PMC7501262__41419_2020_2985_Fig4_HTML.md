caption: a The secretion of mature forms of IL-1β, IL-18, and HMGB1 is the result
  of activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. These mediators possess properties of pro-inflammatory
  activation. Therefore, NLRP3 inflammasome can induce a potent inflammatory response,
  oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis. b Inflammation
  and oxidative stress can induce endothelium DNA damage, activate NF-κB signaling
  pathway, increase P53/P21/P16 transcription, and inhibit autophagy, which may promote
  the process of endothelial cell senescence. Senescent cells can secrete senescence-associated
  secretory phenotype (SASP), including pro-inflammatory mediators, which may promote
  endothelial dysfunction and eventually lead to vascular sclerosis. c IL-1β binding
  to its cell surface receptor IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) recruits IL-1 receptor accessory
  protein (IL-1RacP) to activate intracellular signaling molecules, including myeloid
  differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1/4 (IRAK1/4),
  and TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF), which then causes NF-κB activation. IL-18
  binding to its cell surface receptor IL-18 receptor α chain (IL-18Rα) recruits IL-18
  receptor β chain (IL-18Rβ) to activate similar intracellular signaling molecules.
  HMGB1 can also activate the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is downstream of toll-like
  receptor (TLR)2/4 activation. The activation of NF-κB signaling pathway increases
  the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines to
  mediate the adhesion of leukocyte and promote leukocyte extravasation. Additionally,
  the binding of HMGB1 to the RAGE receptor leads to the activation of downstream
  p38 MAP kinase, resulting in phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein Hsp27
  and caldesmon, which causes actin stress fibers to form, cytoskeletal remodeling,
  and endothelial contraction. All of these reactions increase endothelial permeability
  by altering cell contractility and disrupting intercellular connections.
