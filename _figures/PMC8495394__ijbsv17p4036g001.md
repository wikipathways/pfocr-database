caption: p38γ participates in the biological process of various cancers by regulating
  the cell cycle process. (1) p38γ/p-Rb/Cyclin (E1/A) pathway could encourage tumorigenesis
  and proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma by promoting G0-G1 phase transition;
  (2) p38γ/p-Rb/Cyclin (E1/A) pathway could promote the transition of the cell cycle
  from G1 to S phase, and is affiliated to tumorigenesis, proliferation, and motility
  of pancreatic ductal carcinoma; (3) p38γ/p-Rb/Cyclin (E1/A) pathway could promote
  the transition of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase, connected with tumorigenesis,
  proliferation, and invasion of osteosarcoma; (4) As a downstream target of transcription
  factor REST, p38γ can be restrained by REST and may promote the transition of G1-S
  phase, resulting in the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma; (5) p38γ causes
  G2-M phase arrest and maintains breast cancer cell survival under conditions of
  DNA damage; (6) p38γ/p-Rb/Cyclin (E1/A) pathway may play a crucial part in the proliferation,
  development and migration of human renal cell carcinoma cells; (7) p38γ/p-Rb/Cyclin
  (E1/A) pathway may play a vital role in the proliferation, development and invasion
  of human colorectal cancer cells; (8) Hyaluronan-dependent p38α/β activation induces
  GO-G1 phase arrest, leading to growth inhibition of breast cancer; (9) Blocking
  G1-S phase conduction by p38α also inhibits the tumorigenesis of breast cancer;
  (10) p38α blocks G2-M phase transmission and weakens the tumorigenesis of colorectal
  cancer.
