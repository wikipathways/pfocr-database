caption: '(A) Tracing experiments were performed by incubating RBCs with [1,2,3-13C3]glucose,
  a heavy substrate that can be metabolized in RBCs through (B) the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
  (EMP) glycolytic pathway (generating isotopologue M+3) or through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), generating isotopologue M+2 of lactate, (C) owing to the release
  of the first carbon atom of heavy glucose in the form of 13CO2 at the oxidative
  phase reactions of the PPP. (F) Schematic overview of glucose uptake and consumption
  in RBC supernatants and cells, in fresh, or deglycerolized RBCs, either untreated,
  or treated with the superoxide generator (SOTS-1), (D) demonstrating in both RBCs
  and media similar glucose consumption rates. (E) Total lactate, i.e., sum of lactate
  isotopologues (unlabeled M+0, M+3 generated via glycolysis, or M+2 generated via
  the PPP), in fresh and DG RBCs, either untreated or treated with the superoxide
  generator (SOTS-1), demonstrating in both RBCs and media similar lactate accumulation.
  (G and H) Schematic overview of expected isotopologues and relative ratios of lactate,
  from glycolysis (EMP, M+3 isotopologue) or PPP (M+2) and relative ratios in fresh
  and DG RBCs, either untreated, or treated with the supoxide generator SOTS-1. (H)
  Fresh RBCs were characterized by significantly higher levels of supernatant–but
  not intracellular—M+2 lactate. Conversely, deglycerolized RBCs were characterized
  by faster glycolysis than fresh RBCs. Lower lactate M+2 export in deglycerolized
  RBCs following SOTS-1 was observed, while intracellular glycolysis to pentose phosphate
  pathway ratios were comparable between fresh and deglycerolized RBCs following treatment
  with SOTS-1. Continuous lines indicate median, while dashed lighter lines are representative
  of interquartile ranges, according to the color legend left. Symbols indicate p<0.05
