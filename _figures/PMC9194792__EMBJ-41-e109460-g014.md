caption: Accumulation of PINK1 leads to phosphorylation of ubiquitin on damaged mitochondria
  and recruitment of inactive parkin. Parkin can be activated through one of two ways.
  It can bind a second phosphorylated ubiquitin molecule or it can be phosphorylated
  on its Ubl domain. In the first case, the activation signal (pUb) is fixed and pre‐set,
  while in the second, it depends on the interaction between PINK1 and parkin. Both
  paths lead to a conformational change in which binding of pUb or pUbl to RING0 releases
  the catalytic RING2 domain (R2). Upon activation, parkin adds more ubiquitin molecules
  to the mitochondrial surface, which generates a positive feedback cycle of PINK1
  activity and parkin recruitment. Phosphorylation sites are represented by red circles,
  and the parkin active‐site cysteine by yellow sphere when inactive and a star when
  active.
