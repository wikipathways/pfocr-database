caption: NAD+ metabolism is compartmentalized. Schematic representation of the location
  of the different components of the NAD+ salvage pathway in different cellular compartments.
  The main metabolic pathways involved in the interconversion between the reduced
  and oxidized forms of NADH are indicated for each cellular compartment. NMNAT1–3,
  nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1–3.
