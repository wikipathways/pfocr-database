caption: Summary of signalling pathways. In the inflammatory environment, multiple
  signalling pathways play crucial roles in regulating the osteogenic differentiation
  of PDLSCs. These signalling pathways include Wnt/β-catenin, Wnt/Ca2+, NF-κB, MAPK,
  BMPs, PI3K/AKT, and others. The interaction between the Wnt/β-catenin signalling
  pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ signalling pathway also influences the osteogenic differentiation
  of PDLSCs. Moreover, the BMP signalling pathway is involved in regulating the osteogenic
  differentiation of PDLSCs through various signalling pathways, such as the canonical
  Smad pathway as well as non-canonical pathways like MAPK, PI3K, and PKC.
