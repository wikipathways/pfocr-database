  endocrine and paracrine organs, maintaining tight reciprocal control and communication.
  Osteoporosis and sarcopenia often co-exist in obese patients with visceral adiposity,
  a condition known as osteosarcopenic obesity. This figure illustrates how irisin
  helps counteract and rebalance these pathological conditions by promoting muscle
  growth and bone formation. Physical exercise increases circulating irisin levels,
  as well as PGC-1α and FNDC5, leading to beneficial effects on bone health, particularly
  by stimulating pro-osteoblastic mechanisms and enhancing bone formation. Adiposity,
  characterized as a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, involves excessive lipid
  infiltration in skeletal muscle, which induces lipotoxicity and inflammation associated
  with myosteatosis. This fat deposition triggers the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, affecting the osteoprotegerin pathway and promoting osteoclastogenesis
  and bone resorption. Irisin, by reducing inflammation and lipotoxicity (indicated
  by green arrows), can decrease bone resorptive factors, activate the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, and stimulate osteoblast differentiation. Lipid accumulation
  also contributes to insulin resistance. Irisin reduces adipose tissue inflammation,
  improving the inflammatory impact of lipid deposits and lowering the risk of insulin
  resistance. Since insulin signaling deficiency is linked to alterations in bone
  microarchitecture, β-cell dysfunction is associated with osteoporosis, highlighting
  the direct relationship between insulin resistance and bone metabolism. Irisin acts
  as a hormonal messenger capable of counteracting insulin resistance and myosteatosis,
  thereby connecting insulin metabolism with muscle and bone homeostasis. Specifically,
  irisin can decrease NLRP3 inflammasome activity, promote GLUT4 translocation in
  muscle, and upregulate GLUT4 via the AMPK signaling pathway
