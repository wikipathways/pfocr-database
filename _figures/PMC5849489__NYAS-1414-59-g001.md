caption: Folate‐mediated one‐carbon metabolism. Dietary folic acid is metabolized
  to tetrahydrofolate, which is then activated with a one‐carbon unit to form 10‐formyltetrahydrofolate,
  5,10‐methylenetetrahydrofolate, and 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate. Each of these folate
  cofactors supports a biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of purines and thymidylate
  and the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Synthesis of methionine requires
  5‐methyltetrahydrofolate and vitamin B12. Folic acid is converted to dihydrofolate
  and then tetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase, which is dependent on NADPH.
