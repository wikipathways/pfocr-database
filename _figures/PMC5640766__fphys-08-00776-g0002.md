caption: 'Zebrafish animal model reveals Pth4 acting in a new brain to bone pathway
  and the possible signaling routes through Pth receptors. (A) Left top panel displays
  pth4:eGFP reporter transgenic fish and a schematic picture of a cross section (denoted
  by “a”) of adult transgenic zebrafish. (a) Confocal imaging shows Pth4 neuropeptide
  produced by a specific subset of neurons in the dorsal part of the periventricular
  hypothalamus and multiple branched projections. (B) From the hypothalamus, Pth4
  signals bone probably through Pth1ra and/or Pth1rb. Gray dashed lines denote possible
  signaling pathways via Pth1ra, Pth1rb and Pth2r, which are present in other mineral
  balance-related organs. Abbreviations: hy, hypothalamus; hd, dorsal hypothalamus;
  hv, ventral zone of periventricular hypothalamus; TPp, periventricular nucleus of
  posterior tuberculum. Scale bar: 50 μm (A); 200 μm (a).'
