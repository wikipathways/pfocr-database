caption: 'Impairment of diabetic photoreceptors and their subsequent contribution
  to DR may arise from a variety of interrelated and cumulative events and insults
  pictured here: Vascular and pro-inflammatory changes in DR are halted by long-term
  cessation of phototransduction (i.e. by deletion of transducin/Gnat1), underscoring
  a critical role of the phototransduction pathway in the development of DR. Loss
  of insulin signaling and pro survival pathway activation may increase susceptibility
  to low-level and bright light stress and other metabolic insults. Prolonged hyperglycemia
  and dyslipidemia may lead to chronic fuel overload, impairing photoreceptor energy
  metabolism by reducing mitochondrial efficiency and contributing to increases in
  oxidative stress and subsequent upregulation of inflammatory agents. Hypoxia, caused
  by a decreased oxygen supply from the choroid may be insufficient for the high energetic
  demands of photoreceptors. These factors individually or together may lead to changes
  in circulating current, phototransduction, synaptic transmission and pigment regeneration
  in the photoreceptors of diabetic patients and animals.'
