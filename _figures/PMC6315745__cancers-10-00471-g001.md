caption: Mechanisms of chemoresistance. (A) Drug availability. Drugs (yellow triangles)
  move from blood vessels (right) to cells. A low pH can promote charged drugs that
  interact with negatively-charged extracellular matrix (ECM) components (grey), slowing
  their transit. Charged drugs are also hindered in their ability to cross the hydrophobic
  plasma membrane. Inside the cell, drugs can move to the nucleus to achieve their
  cytotoxic effects. Alternatively, drugs can be transported out of the cell by ABC
  transporters, and degraded by the cytochrome P450 system (CYP), glutathione-S-transferase
  (GSH) superfamily or uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) superfamily.
  Drugs also enter endosomes, and charged drugs are retained more within these acidic
  vesicles. (B) EMT. The epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) involves the loss
  of cell–cell adhesion from the epithelial phenotype (above) to the mesenchymal phenotype
  (below). E-cadherin and keratin are more abundant in the epithelial phenotype. β-catenin,
  N-cadherin, and vimentin, and the transcription factor families Snail, ZEB, bHLH,
  and FOX, are more abundant in the mesenchymal phenotype. Collagen and fibronectin
  secretion is also increased in the mesenchymal phenotype. (C) Oncogenic signaling
  pathways. The main oncogenic signaling pathways that lead to the expression of pro-survival
  genes. Cytokine receptors promote NF-κB and STAT signaling, receptor tyrosine kinases
  promote PI3K and MAPK signaling, and cell–cell contact inhibits YAP signaling (Hippo
  pathway). The orange outline indicates a component that is involved directly in
  promoting transcription. IKK = IκB kinase, NF-κB = nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells, IκBα = inhibitor of kappa B, JAK = Janus kinase, STAT3 = Signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3, STAT3-P = phosphorylated STAT3, PI3K
  = Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, Akt = protein kinase B, FOXO1
  = forkhead box protein O1, ERK/MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase, MST1/2 =
  mammalian ste20 homolog 1/2, LATS1/2 = large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2, YAP =
  Yes-associated protein, YAP-P = phosphorylated YAP. Dotted arrow = multiple reactions.
