caption: The two-step ethylene biosynthesis pathway in plants. In the first committed
  step, which is generally the rate-limiting step, ACC is synthesized from SAM by
  the enzyme ACS. SAM is produced from methionine in the “Yang cycle” of methionine
  cycling (named after Shang Fa Yang and colleagues, who elucidated the ethylene biosynthesis
  pathway in the 1970s). In the second step, ACC is converted to ethylene by the enzyme
  ACO
