caption: Pyruvate, the final product of the glycolytic pathway, is the main precursor
  of acetyl-CoA synthesized by a PDH-catalyzed reaction in mitochondria. Pathologic
  signals associated with AD and other cholinergic encephalopathies lead to prolonged
  depolarization of glutamatergic terminals and excessive release of glutamate and
  Zn. This causes an increased accumulation of zinc ions in postsynaptic neurons yielding
  direct inhibition of PDH activity. As a result, the synthesis of acetyl-CoA and
  its utilization in the TCA cycle are reduced. It leads to inhibition of ATP synthesis.
  In cholinergic neurons, the most significant fraction of the cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA
  pool is consumed for the synthesis of the acetylcholine. TPP deficits increase the
  permeability of plasma neuronal membranes for Zn leading to aggravation of its inhibitory
  effects on PDH and other enzymes of acetyl-CoA metabolism.
