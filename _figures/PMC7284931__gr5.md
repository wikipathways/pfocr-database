caption: Aging process is associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  and inflammation resulting in muscle dysfunction. Decreased levels of insulin-like
  growth factor (IGF-1) are related to aging with the subsequent diminished protein
  synthesis and muscle growth via phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Exercise may exert potent anti-inflammatory
  and anti-oxidative stress (i.e., through nuclear erythroid-2 like factor-2 (Nrf-2)
  activation) effects and consequently improve muscle function. In addition, exercise
  increases protein synthesis via activation of IGF-1 pathway and target myokines
  reducing protein degradation. An increased signaling of the transcription factor
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is also induced
  by exercise, improving mitochondrial function and reducing inflammation mediated
  by nuclear factor κB (NF-κB).
