caption: Analysis overview. Transcriptomic, mutational, and clinical data for breast
  cancer (BC) patients were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.
  The GSVA tool was used to assess the enrichment scores (ESs) of 10 oncogenic signaling
  pathways in each patient. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were extracted based on
  the annotation information in GENECODE, and the correlation coefficients between
  the lncRNA levels and ESs of each prognostically relevant pathway were calculated.
  Only the top 5% of relevant lncRNAs were retained for each oncogenic signaling pathway
  and further combined with clinical data to screen for lncRNAs significantly associated
  with prognosis, resulting in the retention of 29 lncRNAs. The weighting coefficients
  for these lncRNAs were estimated using multivariate Cox regression to generate the
  OncoSig signature. Lastly, BC and pan-cancer cohorts were used to assess the potential
  biological characteristics of the signatures as well as their broader clinical value.
