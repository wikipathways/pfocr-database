caption: The role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in lung cancer cells. (A) The
  blockade of FOXO1/3/4 by Akt could lead to the accelerated transition from the G1
  phase to S and the inhibition of apoptosis. Also, the inhibition of Akt not only
  can induce the up-regulation of BAX and down-regulation of Bcl-2/xL but also lead
  to the lower phosphorylation of GSK3β and the regulation of the lung cancer cell
  cycle. The loss of PTEN and PIK3CA mutations are the most important alteration related
  to drug resistance, particularly anti-EGFR treatments in lung cancer cells. Indeed,
  these alterations could lead to Akt overactivation and consequently, the lung tumor
  cells become immortal. B) The loss of PTEN up-regulates CXCR4/CXCL12 and CXCR1/CXCL8
  and promotes the metastasis process in lung tumor cells. Also, the loss of PTEN
  and the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin activation in lung cancer cells can reduce E-cadherin
  and elevate N-cadherin and vimentin expression which account for the induction of
  EMT. The blockade of mTORC1/2 via treatments could diminish the activation of S6K,
  RhoA, and Rac1 which reduces the ability of migration and invasion of lung tumor
  cells. The stimulation of Akt could up-regulate HIF-1α and consequently VEGF which
  ultimately cause the induction of the angiogenesis process.
