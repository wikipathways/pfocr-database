caption: 'Schematic representation of the microfilament signaling pathway. Actin cytoskeletal
  remodeling is driven by Rho GTPases (RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42), which act as molecular
  switches to regulate cell motility. RhoA activates ROCK kinases, phosphorylating
  LIMK1/2 to inhibit cofilin’s actin-severing activity, thereby stabilizing F-actin,
  while phosphatases restore cofilin function for dynamic turnover. RhoA also activates
  mDia formins, which cooperate with profilin to deliver ATP-G-actin for linear filament
  elongation at the barbed ends. Conversely, Rac and Cdc42 promote branched actin
  networks via WRC-Arp2/3 activation, with feedback regulation that ensures pulsatile
  dynamics. The balance between RhoA-driven linear assembly (mDia-profilin) and Rac/Cdc42-mediated
  branching (Arp2/3), coupled with cofilin-phosphatase cycling, orchestrates actomyosin
  contractility. Red arrows: the sequence of signals activation; black arrows: the
  direction of actin filament dynamics'
