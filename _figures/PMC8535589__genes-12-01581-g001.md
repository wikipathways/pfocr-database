caption: 'Role of ATM in various pathways of apoptosis. Pathways of apoptosis and
  its regulation by ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM). (a) Extrinsic apoptosis
  and intrinsic apoptosis are two major pathways of apoptosis. In the intrinsic pathway,
  a panel of mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS)-resident proteins, such as cytochrome
  c (cyt c) and Smac/DIABLO (direct IAP binding protein with low pI) [,], are released
  into the cytoplasm in response to the dysregulation of mitochondrial function, including
  a loss of mitochondrial outer membrane potential (ΔΦm), an increase in mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeability (MOMP), or the generation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), through pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane composed of oligomers of
  bax and bak [,] to activate caspase-9 [,]. Caspase-9 then activates caspase-3 to
  execute the downstream events of the entire apoptotic process. In contrast to the
  intrinsic pathway, the extrinsic pathway is initiated by the ligation of so-called
  death ligands, such as FasL, to cell surface receptors [,,]. Although the ligation
  of the receptors to death ligands typically results in caspase-8 activation, this
  caspase also leads to the activation of caspase-3 [,]. The DNA damage response (DDR)-induced
  activation of ATM results in the subsequent activation of p53 via direct phosphorylation
  as well as checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2)-mediated phosphorylation. p53 transactivates
  bax gene expression, which facilitates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. (b)
  ER stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) also leads to apoptosis. UPR is
  executed via three pathways: the inositol-requiring enzyme1α (IRE1α), PKR-like ER
  kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor6 (ATF6) pathways. c-Jun N-terminus
  kinase (JNK) and C/EBP homologues protein (CHOP) serve as the mediators of apoptosis.
  All three of these pathways are regulated by the ER resident chaperon, binding immunoglobulin
  protein (BiP). ATM facilitates ER stress and subsequent apoptosis through the protein
  phosphatase 2A (PP2A)/Akt/ glycogen synthase 3β (GSK-3β)-dependent degradation of
  nascent polypeptide-associated complex α-subunit (αNAC)/ γ-taxilin (γTX). In this
  case, cytoplasmic ATM serves as a platform for the activation of the PP2A/Akt/GSK-3β
  axis [].'
