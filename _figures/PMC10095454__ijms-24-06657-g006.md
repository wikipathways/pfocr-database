caption: Summary of the mechanism by which SDC3 cooperates with the regulation of
  milk fat synthesis and inflammatory response. The overexpression of SDC3 can promote
  the synthesis of milk fat in BMECs by inhibiting the activation of AMPK, downregulating
  the expression of downstream gene SIRT1, and upregulating the expression of PPARG.
  In addition, the overexpression of SDC3 inhibits the expression of NF-κB p50 and
  P-IκBα, increases the expression of IκBα, and inhibits the NF-κB pathway, reducing
  the expression of downstream inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and COX-2)
  and ROS generation—and, finally, inhibiting the inflammatory response of BMECs.
