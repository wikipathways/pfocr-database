caption: VNN1 expression and function can be regulated by Ox-LDL to promote atherosclerosis.
  These harmful effects are accompanied by decrease of cholesterol efflux, promotion
  of inflammatory molecule expression, and decrease of macrophage apoptosis, thus
  promoting atherosclerotic plaque formation. Ox-LDL upregulates VNN1 expression through
  ERK1/2/COX-2/PPARα signaling pathway. Then, VNN1 could inhibit cellular cholesterol
  efflux through reducing expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, SR-BI, and NPC1 by inhibiting
  expression of PPARγ and LXRα. In addition, VNN1 could promote inflammation through
  inducing expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. Moreover, VNN1 might
  reduce macrophage apoptosis through inhibiting P53 expression and inducing BCL-2
  expression.
