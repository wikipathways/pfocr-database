caption: 'A schematic illustration of signalling within the type I interferon (IFN)
  system. Circled gene names have confirmed association to SLE: STAT4, IRF5, IRF7,
  IRF8, TNFAIP3 (A20), TNFSF4 (OX40L), FCGR2A, TYK2, IFIH1 (MDA5), IRAK1, as well
  as IKBKE and IL8, identified in this study. Genes with dashed circles are TANK and
  TRAF6, which we find associated with SLE in the Swedish but not US cohorts, and
  STAT1 that has an association signal, which cannot be distinguished from that of
  STAT4. Left: Induction of inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN genes in response
  to viral RNA/DNA by the helicases IFIH1 (MDA5), DDX58 (RIG-I) and the DNA sensor
  ZBP1 (DAI), or by bacterial LPS through toll-like receptor 4. These pathways signal
  using TANK that interacts with IKBKE or TBK1, which together can mediate phosphorylation
  of the interferon regulatory factors IRF3 and 7, leading to the transcription of
  type I IFN genes. Activation of this pathway can be inhibited by TNFAIP3 (A20).
  Middle: Induction of IFN production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) by endogenous
  immune complexes. Immune complexes are endocytosed through FCGRIIA, which leads
  to activation of TLR7/9. After a signalling cascade, which includes IRAK1 and TRAF6,
  the interferon regulatory factors IRF5 and IRF7 are activated leading to the transcription
  of type I IFN genes. Also IRF8 can contribute to this activation. Right: IFN signalling
  through the type I IFN receptor IFNAR. Association of type I IFN to the receptor
  activates the kinases TYK2 and JAK1, which signal through STAT1 and STAT2. Also
  other STATs, including STAT4, are activated in this process. The STAT1/STAT2 complex
  associates with IRF9, which in turn binds to interferon-stimulated response elements
  (ISREs) and induces expression of IFN-induced genes, such as IRF5, IRF7 and indirectly
  IL8. Far right: Membrane proteins expressed on pDCs. TNFSF4 (OX40 L), together with
  endogenous type I IFNs provide a means for the pDCs to control the T-cell response,
  specifically to profile it towards a TH1 response. Activation of the NFκB pathway,
  and thus production of inflammatory cytokines, also occurs through TLR7/9 (not shown).
  Proteins are denoted by their corresponding gene names.'
