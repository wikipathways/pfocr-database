caption: Main mechanisms by which active skeletal muscle can impact the brain. (1)
  Cathepsin B transcription is upregulated in brain and skeletal muscle, and its concentration
  increases in the blood in response to exercise. Cathepsin B is able to cross the
  BBB and may induce BDNF transcription in hippocampal neurons. (2) During exercise,
  glycolysis converts glucose into pyruvate to produce ATP. Lactate is produced from
  this reaction and accumulates in the blood. Lactate can cross the BBB and activate
  the PGC1α/FNDC5 signalling pathway and promote BDNF expression. (3) Exercise increases
  the release of irisin into the circulation. Irisin can cross the BBB and/or trigger
  several signalling pathways (including the cAMP/PKA/CREB) to activate BDNF production.
  (4) Kynurenine aminotransferases are increased in ‘trained’ skeletal muscles. These
  enzymes convert Kyn into kynurenic acid (KynA). Consequently, peripheral Kyn-to-KynA
  conversion is increased and prevents the accumulation of Kyn and its related neurotoxic
  metabolites (3-hydroxykynurenine or quinolinic acid) in the brain.
