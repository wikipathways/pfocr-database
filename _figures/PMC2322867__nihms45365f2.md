caption: This schematic diagram illustrates proposed mER-mediated mechanisms that
  can mediate rapid estradiol-induced ERK1/2 activation. Pathway 1 represents G-protein-like
  transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) proposed to occur via
  GPR30 or ERα induction of MMP-mediated heprin-bound EGF (HB-EGF) shedding; Pathway
  2 shows the mechanism proposed to involve direct interaction of ERα with Shc which
  acts to couple the activated ER to the ras/ERK pathway; Pathway 3 is a cascade involving
  the interaction of the ER with the adaptor protein PELP/MNAR 1, or directly interacting
  with c-Src to stimulate c-Src kinase, which in turn activates Ras to link the activated
  ER to ERK-MAPK pathway; Pathway 4 shows the G-protein and Src-kinase dependent,
  EGF-receptor independent pathway operative in cerebellar granule cells. The site
  of inhibition for specific antagonists used to elucidate the pathway of rapid cerebellar
  signaling are indicted. The dotted arrow indicates the identified rapid intracellular
  estrogen signaling pathway that stimulates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity
  in granule cells. This phosphatase pathway is independent of Gαi-signaling and is
  also PKA independent. PP2A activation is required, along with rapid ERK-activation,
  for estrogen to induce calpain-mediated cell death in granule cell precursors. Key
  protein kinase activation phosphorylation sites are indicated with a red P. The
  PI3K pathway is included to illustrate that EGF-receptor activation in granule cells
  activates both the ERK & PI3K pathways, but estrogen only stimulates ERK-signaling.
