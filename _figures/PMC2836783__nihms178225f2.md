caption: Model of CD62L regulation by T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and γc-cytokines.
  Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are activated following engagement of the TCR with
  cognate peptide antigen presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex
  (MHC)-I. This leads to the activation of numerous signaling molecules, including
  the p110δ subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI[3]K). This leads to activation
  of Erk1/2, which will then phosphorylate the TACE/Adam17 protease. Following phosphorylation
  the TACE/Adam17 protease will translocate to the cell membrane where it can cleave
  CD62L from the cell surface. This results in the transient early downregulation
  of CD62L. More sustained modulation of CD62L expression occurs at the genetic level
  and appears to be regulated, at least in part, by the γc-cytokines IL-2 and IL-15.
  IL-2 strongly activates the p110δ subunit of PI(3)K that will subsequently activate
  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex, while IL-15 only weakly activates
  this pathway. mTOR then regulates Klf2 activity, which is known to enhance the expression
  of CD62L, CCR7, and S1P1.
