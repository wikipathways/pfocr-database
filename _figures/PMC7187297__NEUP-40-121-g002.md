caption: Glycogen deposits in astroglia are a potential source for lactate production.
  An astroglia‐specific enzyme, glycogen phosphorylase, degrades glycogen deposits
  in astroglia. In addition to glucose‐derived glucose‐6‐phosphate (pink arrow), glycogen‐derived
  glucose‐1‐phosphate (green arrow) is metabolized in a glycolytic pathway, producing
  lactate. When astroglia are cultured under high glucose conditions, the glycogen
  content and lactate production both increase.
