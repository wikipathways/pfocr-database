caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. When the Wnt pathway is activated, Wnt ligands
  are recognized by FZD and LRP5/6. This leads to the recruitment of AXIN and GSK-3β
  to the cell membrane by activated DVL, causing the disassembly of the β-catenin
  destruction complex and removing its ability to degrade β-catenin. Subsequently,
  β-catenin translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it activates its
  target genes by interacting with TCF/LEF. When the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is inactive,
  the β-catenin destruction complex, composed of AXIN, APC, GSK-3β, and CK-1α, leads
  to the phosphorylation of β-catenin by CK1α and GSK3β, followed by its degradation
  by the proteasome
