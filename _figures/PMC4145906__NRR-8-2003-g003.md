caption: 'The role of mitochondria in Parkinson''s disease[]. Complex I (C-I) activity
  is decreased in Parkinson''s disease, and inhibition of C-I by mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore or rotenone causes Parkinsonism. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA
  (mtDNA)-encoded C-I subunits and mtDNA polymerase γ (POLG) also cause Parkinsonism.
  Many genes associated with Parkinson''s disease (such as α-synuclein, parkin, DJ-1,
  PINK1, and LRRK2) also implicate mitochondria in disease pathogenesis. α-synuclein
  overexpression can impair mitochondrial function and enhance the toxicity of the
  mitochondrial permeability transition pore.Parkin associates with the outer mitochondrial
  membrane and protects against cytochrome c release. It may also associate with mitochondrial-transcription-factor
  A (TFAM). Physical associations have been reported between DJ-1 and α-synuclein,
  DJ-1 and PINK1, and DJ-1 and parkin, and there is genetic evidence that DJ-1, PINK1
  and parkin are functionally linked in the same pathway. About 10% of the kinase
  LRRK2 is localized to mitochondria, and Parkinson''s disease-related mutations augment
  its kinase activity. A mutation in high temperature requirement protein A2 was found
  in 1% of sporadic Parkinson''s disease patients. CR: Control region.'
