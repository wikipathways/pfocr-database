caption: Bacterial manipulation of host pro-survival pathway. M. tuberculosis activates
  host anti-apoptotic signaling by up-regulating the anti-apoptosis genes Mcl-1, bfl1,
  and FLIP. NuoG dampens Nox2-mediated host signaling, resulting in the inhibition
  of apoptosis. Legionella deliver LegK1 and LnaB, which enhance the pro-survival
  activity of NF-κB. Shigella invasion of the epithelium results in mitochondria permeability
  transition (MPT)−dependent ROS production and necrosis-like cell death, which is
  counterbalanced by the NOD1−RIP2−NF-κB−Bcl2 pro-survival pathway. PGN, peptidoglycan.
  Salmonella deliver SopB and AvrA via the T3SS, and they inhibit apoptosis by activating
  the PI3K–Akt pro-survival pathway via inositol phosphate activity and by preventing
  JNK pro-cell death signaling via acetyltransferase activity, respectively. EPEC
  also targets JNK signaling by delivering NleD, which uses its metalloprotease activity
  to cleave JNK, thereby inhibiting cell death.
