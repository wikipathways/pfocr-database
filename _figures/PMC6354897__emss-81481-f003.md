caption: 'Schematic representation of the processes underlying the proposed hypothesis
  of the temperature and CO2 effects on isoprene synthesis. (A) and (B) correspond
  to the sub-optimal temperature of photosynthesis, and (C) and (D) to the temperature
  above the thermal optimum of photosynthesis at low (A, C) and high CO2 (B, D) concentrations.
  Under low [CO2], the light-saturated photosynthesis is Rubisco limited (Jmax>Vcmax;
  see  for definition), while under high [CO2], photosynthesis it is limited by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
  (RuBP) regeneration or triose phosphate utilization (Jmax<Vcmax), especially under
  low temperatures. The energy in excess to that used for CO2 assimilation is available
  for isoprene production and photorespiration. The energy partitioning to CO2 and
  O2 reduction in the Calvin-Benson (CB) cycle, and MEP pathway is represented by
  white arrows. The Pi pool size is higher at low [CO2] than at high [CO2] and this
  could favor enhanced involvement of extrachloroplastic PEP sources via PEP/phosphate
  translocator (PPT). The cytosolic PEP pool size is lower at higher temperatures
  due to the greater activity of PEP carboxylase enzyme. However, heat stress can
  trigger enhanced starch and sucrose turnover and, thus, a greater net release of
  Pi from sugar phosphates. Under higher temperature and supra-optimum [CO2], greater
  availability of carbon intermediates and photosynthetic energy can increase MEP
  pathway activity. This results in increases in DMADP availability and, together
  with the strong effect of temperature on isoprene synthase activity (IspS), this
  enhances the rate of isoprene synthesis. Note the thicker arrows indicate a higher
  flow of intermediaries (black arrows) and energy (white arrows) in response to the
  change in temperature and CO2 concentration. Metabolites: 2-PG, 2-phosphoglycolate;
  F16BP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Explanations of other abbreviations are given
