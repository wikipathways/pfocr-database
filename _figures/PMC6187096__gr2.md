caption: Ginsenoside Rh2 epigenetically affects genes in the cell-mediated immune
  response pathway. The 850K microarray analysis identified 40 hypermethylated and
  34 hypomethylated CpGs in promoter regions (Δβ ≥ 0.15 and |fold change| ≥ 1.5),
  and these were submitted for the construction of the highest confidence Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA) network. The highest confidence network in the Rh2-treated
  MCF-7 cell was the “cell-mediated immune response” pathway. Shaded in red and green
  are those that are hypermethylated and hypomethylated, respectively, with intensity
  signifying the magnitude of the methylation change. Solid and dashed lines denote
  direct and indirect interactions, respectively.
