caption: a) The branched pathway obtained by using overlapping rule. b) The branched
  pathway obtained by using non-overlapping rule. In the compounds bn1 and bn2, a
  circle represents an atom and the edges connecting atoms represent bonds. The red
  and blue partitions in the compounds bn1 and bn2 are the conserved atom group transferred
  from the source compound. The partition circled with green dashed line in the compound
  bn1 is the overlapping part of the conserved atom group for pathways 1 and 2.
