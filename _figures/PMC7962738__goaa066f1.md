caption: 'Schematic of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycogen metabolism, the hexosamine
  pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, and the TCA cycle. Glycolysis and its opposing
  pathway, gluconeogenesis, serve as a central hub for the utilization of glucose
  in multiple pathways such as glycogen metabolism, the hexosamine pathway, the TCA
  cycle, and downstream oxidative phosphorylation. Tumors require energy to grow and
  proliferate, and the glycolysis–TCA cycle–oxidative phosphorylation axis provides
  significant amounts of cellular energy in the form of ATP. These pathways feature
  significantly in HCC and their dysregulation provides insight into tumorigenic mechanisms
  that can be potentially targeted with precision therapeutics. Metabolite nomenclature:
