caption: Schematic representation proposed for the plausible mechanisms of action
  of 10058-F4 in APL-derived NB4 cells. Through inhibition of c-Myc, 10058-F4 augmented
  the intracellular level of ROS and induced caspase-3-dependent apoptotic cell death
  in NB4 cells through suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This favorable
  anti-leukemic activity could be attenuated through activation of the PI3K signaling
  pathway. Suppression of the PI3K axis using CAL-101 eliminated the compensatory
  effect of this pathway on 10058-F4-induced cytotoxic effect and promoted a more
  significant apoptotic cell death in NB4 cells
