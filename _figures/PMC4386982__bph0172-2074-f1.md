caption: 'Reperfusion signalling pathways underlying ischaemic conditioning. The diagram
  provides a simplified scheme of some of the potential reperfusion signalling pathways
  linking ischaemic conditioning to the MPTP. These can be categorized into: (i) ‘Active
  MPTP inhibition’ (light blue shaded box): this includes those mechanistic pathways
  in which a signal transduction pathway has been implicated. This begins at the cardiomyocyte
  plasma membrane with the activation of the G‐protein coupled or cytokine receptor
  by autocoids such as adenosine, bradykinin or opioids, which result in the recruitment
  of complex signal transduction pathways many of which terminate on the mitochondria,
  and involve in some cases the translocation of protein kinases to the mitochondria.
  For the sake of clarity only the components of the RISK (PI3K‐Akt and MEK1/2‐Erk1/2),
  SAFE (JAK‐STAT) and the PKG pathways are shown on this diagram. These reperfusion
  salvage pathways have been shown to activate downstream mediators such as eNOS,
  GSK‐3β, HKII, PKC‐ε, the mitochondrial ATP‐dependent potassium channel (KATP), which
  then mediate the inhibitory effect on MPTP opening. (ii) ‘Passive MPTP inhibition’
  (purple shaded box): this includes mechanisms that result in MPTP inhibition as
  an indirect effect of ischaemic conditioning on factors that are known to induce
  MPTP opening at the time of myocardial reperfusion such as attenuating detrimental
  ROS production, preserving ATP levels, delaying pH correction at reperfusion, and
  reducing mitochondrial calcium and phosphate overload. Clearly, these two categories
  are not mutually exclusive and there may overlap, for example, both PKG and PI3K‐Akt
  have been reported to influence intracellular calcium regulation by promoting the
  uptake of calcium via SERCA into the sarcoplasmic reticulum [modified from Hausenloy
  et al., ).'
