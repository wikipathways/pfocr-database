caption: 'How ERF5 and ERF6 regulate leaf growth and stress defense under osmotic
  stress. A, Immediately upon exposure to osmotic stress,  accumulates in the actively
  growing leaves, where it is converted to ethylene. Ethylene further activates the
  signaling pathway involving MPK3 and MPK6. These kinases phosphorylate the basal
  amount of ERF5 and ERF6 proteins present in the cell prior to stress exposure. The
  activated ERF5 and ERF6 then execute their dual functions: on the one hand, the
  activation of the stress defense transcriptional cascade with direct transcriptional
  activation of WRKY33, STZ, and MYB51, and on the other hand, the activation of leaf
  growth inhibition. This occurs through the transcriptional activation of the gene
  encoding the GA-inactivating enzyme GA2-OX6, thereby decreasing the bioactive GA
  concentration and stabilizing the DELLA proteins. B, In accordance with the model
  presented in A, ERF6 transcript levels and stress-mediated activity inversely correlate
  with leaf growth (for discussion, see text). Bar = 1 cm. [See online article for
  color version of this figure.]'
