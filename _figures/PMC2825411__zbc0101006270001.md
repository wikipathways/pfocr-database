caption: The FAS-II pathway in M. tuberculosis and the structures of several natural
  product KAS inhibitors. In M. tuberculosis, the FAS-II pathway elongates the C18+
  acyl-CoAs from the FAS-I pathway to C54-C56 fatty acids. The pathway is primed by
  the CoA-dependent β-ketoacyl-AcpM synthase FabH, which condenses the acyl-CoA with
  malonyl-AcpM to generate a β-ketoacyl-AcpM. The β-ketoacyl-AcpM is converted into
  a saturated enoyl-AcpM by the sequential actions of a β-ketoacyl-AcpM reductase
  (MabA), a dehydrase, and a trans-2-enoyl-AcpM reductase (InhA). Subsequent rounds
  of elongation are initiated by the KasA or KasB β-ketoacyl-AcpM synthases. KasA
  is thought to be responsible for the early rounds of fatty acid elongation. Also
  shown is the malonyl-CoA AcpM transacylase (FabD) responsible for the synthesis
  of malonyl-AcpM. β-Ketoacyl-AcpM synthase inhibitors include the natural products
  thiolactomycin, cerulenin, and platensimycin.
