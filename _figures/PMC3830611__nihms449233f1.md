caption: Activation of several receptors on the cell membrane including (but not limited
  to) ephrin, growth factor receptor, mGluR, and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) leads to inhibition
  of the hamartin/tuberin/TBC1D7 (TSC1/TSC2) complex. By contrast, hypoxia, AMP/ATP
  ratio, metabolic stress, and genotoxic stress lead to increased TSC1/TSC2 complex
  activity. Inhibition of the complex activity relieves a block on Rheb activity by
  allowing it to become GTP-bound (active)_resulting in mTORC1 activation. Upon activation,
  mTORC1 phosphorylates 4E-BP1 and S6K1 leading to CAP-dependent translation.
