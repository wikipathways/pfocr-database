caption: Additional mechanisms by which Wnt/β-catenin signaling can be modulated in
  cancer. (A) In hepatocytes, β-catenin can be released from an additional membrane
  bound pool associated with the receptor C-MET. When engaged by HGF (hepatocyte growth
  factor), C-MET releases β-catenin into the cytoplasm with its eventual translocation
  into the nucleus. (B) Membrane-bound NOTCH1 can bind activated β-catenin and cause
  its lysosomal destruction, thereby inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. A decrease
  in NOTCH1 expression may therefore potentiate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in certain
  types of cancer. (C) Interactions with numerous proteins can modulate Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling at various levels in the pathway. SULF-1 (Sulfatase-1) can increase the
  efficiency of Wnt ligands by modulating their interactions with heparin sulfate
  proteoglycans in the extracellular environment. ATDC (Ataxia telangiectasia group
  D-complementing) protein can potentiate pathway activation through its interaction
  with DVL (Dishevelled). SMO (Smoothened) can increase Wnt/β-catenin signaling by
  an unknown mechanism. Undoubtedly, novel mechanisms will be uncovered to explain
  the complex context dependency of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
