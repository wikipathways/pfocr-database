caption: New model for a novel role of p38 MAPK in the DNA damage response in cancer
  cells. DNA damage elicits the activation of cell cycle checkpoint, DNA repair, and
  cell survival signaling pathways. In response to DNA damage, the Chk1-mediated G2
  DNA damage checkpoint is activated to prevent entry into mitosis with damaged DNA,
  whereas the p38-mediated cell survival pathway is activated to keep cells alive.
  Together, these two pathways afford cell the time to repair DNA damage and ultimately
  to allow recovery from DNA damage.
