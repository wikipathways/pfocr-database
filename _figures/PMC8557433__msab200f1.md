caption: Comparison of the photosynthesis pathways at the C3–C4 intermediate stage
  and the C4 stage. (A) At the C3–C4 intermediate stage, a photorespiratory CO2 pump
  is established for transferring CO2 from M cells to BS cells. At this stage, C4
  enzymes may be recruited to establish a basic C4cycle to balance nitrogen metabolism.
  Glycine derived from photorespiration is shuttled from M cells to BS cells. Then,
  the BS-restricted GLDP decarboxylates glycine to release CO2 and ammonia in BS cells.
  The increased CO2 concentration enhances the carboxylation of BS-Rubisco and reduces
  photorespiratory CO2 loss. BS-ammonia is refixed to alanine by GOGAT (glutamine
  oxoglutarate aminotransferase) and ALAAT (alanine aminotransferase) and alanine
  is shuttled from BS cells to M cells, which sustains the photorespiratory activity
  in peroxisome. (B) At the C4 stage, C4 enzymes involved in the NAD-ME subtype C4
  photosynthesis are upregulated in expression to enhance the concentration of CO2
  in BS cells. Because Rubisco is restricted in BS cells at the C4 stage, the increased
  CO2 concentration limits photorespiration activity, making the photorespiratory
  CO2 pump obsolete. The pathway in (A) was modified from the model of . Glu, glutamate;
  2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; OAA, oxaloacetate; Asp, aspartic
  acid; AspAT, aspartate aminotransferase.
