caption: Metabolic channeling of glucose within a highly glycolytic tumor cell. Glucose
  brought across the plasma-membrane by glucose transporters is rapidly phosphorylated
  by HK-2 bound to VDAC located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. VDAC channels
  ATP generated by the ATP Synthasome complex (ATP synthase; adenine nucleotide translocator,
  ANT; inorganic phosphate carrier, PiC) on the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating
  direct access of ATP to VDAC-bound HK-2. To maintain the high rate of glycolytic
  metabolism in tumors, and their proliferation capacity, the product G-6-P rapidly
  distributes primarily across two key metabolic routes; (a) entry of G-6-P into the
  pentose–phosphate shunt for biosynthesis of nucleic-acid precursors, and (b) conversion
  of the G-6-P via the glycolytic pathway to pyruvic acid. Most of the pyruvic acid
  is reduced to lactic acid and transported out of the tumor cell via lactate transporters
  {B}. This promotes an unfavorable environment for the surrounding normal cells with
  concomitant regeneration of NAD+ within the cells to maintain glycolysis. Some pyruvate
  is directed to mitochondria across VDAC and via the “as-yet-uncharacterized” pyruvate
  transporter on the inner mitochondrial membrane {A}. This provides substrates for
  the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy generation, as well as lipid and
  amino acid biosynthesis (not shown).

  description: Metabolic channeling of glucose within a highly glycolytic tumor cell.
    Glucose brought across the plasma-membrane by glucose transporters is rapidly
