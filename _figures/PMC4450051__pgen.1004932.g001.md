caption: The schematic depicts our experimental approach for investigating the effect
  of SF3a1 inhibition on mRNA splicing and innate immunity. Mouse RAW264.7 cells were
  treated with either SF3a1 siRNA or control siRNA and subsequently exposed (or not)
  to LPS. These mRNA samples were then subjected to poly-A mRNA sequencing (A). The
  sequence data were then analyzed using MISO (B) to determine the global effects
  of SF3a1 on alternative pre-mRNA splicing and to investigate intron sequences that
  mediated these alternative splicing effects (C). The sequence data also were analyzed
  using DESeq, DEXSeq, and Cuffdiff to identify genes and isoforms whose expression
  was regulated by SF3a1 (B). This gene- and isoform-level analysis was in turn used
  for pathway analysis (D) and to identify specific TLR signaling pathway genes that
  mediate the effects of SF3a on innate immunity (E).
