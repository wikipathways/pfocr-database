caption: DNA mediated inflammation via DAMPs receptors and STING signaling. Double-stranded
  DNA and DNA fragments were released from dying acinar cells. DsDNA activated the
  NF-KB and MAPK pathway through toll-like receptors to induce AP-associated inflammation.
  DNA fragments worsen AP-associated inflammation through STING signaling pathway
  in macrophages.
