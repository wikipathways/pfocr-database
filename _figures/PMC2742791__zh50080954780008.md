caption: Antigen challenge releases eosinophil MBP onto neuronal M2 receptors on airway
  parasympathetic nerves, causing M2 receptor dysfunction. Loss of M2 receptor function
  increases ACh release onto airway smooth muscle and increases bronchoconstriction
  (solid arrows and lines). Airway hyperreactivity and neuronal M2 receptor dysfunction
  are protected by depletion of eosinophils with antibody to IL-5 (Ab IL-5). NGF does
  not play a role in this pathway, since Ab NGF does not prevent antigen-induced airway
  hyperreactivity. In contrast, NGF, the source of which is unknown (?), becomes important
  when muscarinic receptors are blocked. Muscarinic blockade with atropine at the
  time of antigen challenge increases eosinophil activation and granule protein release,
  leading to airway hyperreactivity that is not mediated by M2 receptor dysfunction
  (dashed lines). Depletion of eosinophils (Ab IL-5) or inhibition of NGF (Ab NGF)
  decreases eosinophil activation and prevents atropine-enhanced antigen-induced airway
  hyperreactivity. One possible mechanism involves a negative regulatory pathway that
  is controlled by ACh. Inhibitory muscarinic receptors (MiR) limit NGF and, subsequently,
  inhibit release of a eosinophil factor. This factor (which may be NGF or another
  neuromediator) induces a change in parasympathetic nerve activity leading to hyperreactivity
  through a mechanism that does not involve neuronal M2 receptor dysfunction.

  description: Antigen challenge releases eosinophil MBP onto neuronal M2 receptors
    on airway parasympathetic nerves, causing M2 receptor dysfunction. Loss of M2
    receptor function increases ACh release onto airway smooth muscle and increases
    bronchoconstriction (solid arrows and lines). Airway hyperreactivity and neuronal
    M2 receptor dysfunction are protected by depletion of eosinophils with antibody

    Muscarinic blockade with atropine at the time of antigen challenge increases eosinophil
    activation and granule protein release, leading to airway hyperreactivity that

    This factor (which may be NGF or another neuromediator) induces a change in parasympathetic
