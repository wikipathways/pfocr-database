caption: 'Schematic representation of the dual molecular mechanisms by which OPC ameliorates
  cadmium-induced senescence of osteocytes: (i) suppression of oxidative stress and
  ROS accumulation through modulating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, and (ii) inhibition
  of pro-inflammatory cytokine production via regulating the NF-κB signaling. (Red
  downward arrows represent decreased levels of antioxidant enzyme activity, and red
  up arrows represent increased levels of inflammatory factors)'
