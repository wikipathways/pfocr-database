caption: Residual tumors after insufficient MWA were affected by thermal intervention,
  which influenced EMT-related markers (down-regulated E-cadherin, up-regulated vimentin
  and N-cadherin) via snail activated by β-catenin, resulting in EMT of residual tumor,
  while targeting β-catenin pathway by special inhibitor ICG001 neutralized the EMT
  phenotype and enhanced metastasis caused by insufficient MWA.
