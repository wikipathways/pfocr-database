caption: Schematic representation of stilbene biosynthesis (Adapted from KEGG Pathways).
  The heatmap represent the expression profile of the identified DEGs associated to
  the ENTREZ IDs of the enzymes implicated in this biosynthesis pathway. The color
  key represents the log2 relative gene expression values. Each line represents one
  gene, and each column represents one condition.
