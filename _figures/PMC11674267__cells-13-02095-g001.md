caption: 'Mechanistic pathway of methuosis-induced vacuolization. The numbered regions
  within the cell (1–4) represent the distinct stages in the methuosis process: (1)
  initiation of macropinocytosis: methuosis inducers activate pathways that trigger
  macropinocytosis, resulting in the formation of small vesicles (pinosomes) within
  the cytoplasm; (2) accumulation of pinosomes: cells progressively collect these
  pinosomes, accumulating them in the cytoplasm; (3) vesicle fusion: the pinosomes
  fuse to form larger vacuoles, marking an advanced stage of methuosis; (4) membrane
  rupture and cell death: large vacuoles continue to grow, eventually leading to membrane
  rupture and cell death. NGF—nerve growth factor; EKC—epimedokoreanin C; JB—jaspine
  B; METH—methamphetamine; TBM-2—tubeimoside 2; DMBP—methyl 2,4-dihydroxy-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)-6-phenethylbenzoate;
  mAbs—monoclonal antibodies; TrkA—tyrosine kinase receptor A; MKK4—mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase 4; CK2—casein kinase 2; HOPS—homotypic fusion and vacuole
  protein sorting complex'
