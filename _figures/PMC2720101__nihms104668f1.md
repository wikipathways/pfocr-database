caption: The p16 pathway blocks the CDK4-CDK6-cyclin-D complex which increases the
  phosphorylation state of RB, causing it to release the transcription factor E2F.
  Free E2F mediates the transcription of several cellular genes that are involved
  in G1/S progression, including ribonucleotide reductase (RR). In normal non cycling
  cells there is no cellular RR hence Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) strains with mutations
  in viral ICP6 gene (encoding for viral counterpart of cellular RR), can not promote
  DNA synthesis and viral replication. Loss of p16 or RB function frequently found
  in neoplastic cells dys-regulates E2F activity, and leads to increased production
  of cellular proteins such as RR. This is exploited by HSV-1 defective in ICP6 to
  replicate in cancer cells.
