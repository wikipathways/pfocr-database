caption: (A) Sorting of β-barrel proteins. The precursors of β-barrel proteins are
  initially transported via the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM complex) into
  the intermembrane space (IMS). IMS chaperone complexes transfer the precursors to
  the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex). The two essential subunits, Sam50
  and Sam35, cooperate in insertion of the precursors into the outer membrane. Steps
  1–3 show the general pathway for sorting of β-barrel proteins. Steps 4 and 5 depict
  specific additional steps of the assembly pathway of the β-barrel protein, Tom40.
  Mim1 supports integration of the Tom40 precursor into the outer membrane; Tom40
  then associates with Tom5 and a further Tom40 molecule, followed by Mdm10-supported
  assembly of the oligomeric TOM complex.(B) Insertion of α-helical proteins. Mitochondrial
  outer membrane proteins with α-helical transmembrane segments that typically function
  as sorting signals are imported by different pathways, depending on the location
  of the sorting signal. For different precursor proteins, a dependence on Mim1, Tom70,
  the TOM complex and/or SAM has been reported, but the mechanisms of membrane integration
  have not yet been defined.(C) Evolutionary conservation of β-barrel sorting from
  Gram-negative bacteria to mitochondria. Bacteria synthesize the precursor proteins
  in the cytoplasm. The precursors are translocated through the Sec machinery to the
  periplasm and guided by chaperones to the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) of the
  outer membrane. For mitochondrial β-barrel proteins, the site of synthesis and the
  initial translocation through the TOM complex are different from bacteria, yet the
  subsequent steps of chaperone-guided transfer through the IMS and insertion into
  the outer membrane by the SAM complex share characteristics with the bacterial system.
  Sam50 is homologous to the central BAM component BamA (Omp85/YaeT). However, differences
  are also apparent as the other SAM and BAM subunits, as well as the chaperones of
  the IMS and periplasm, are not homologous to each other, and the lipid composition
  of the mitochondrial outer membrane is different from that of the bacterial outer
  membrane.
