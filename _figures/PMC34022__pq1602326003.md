caption: Proposed SA- and NO-mediated pathway for activation of certain defense  genes
  and elevation of intracellular free Fe2+. Key  signaling molecules in the cascade
  include NO, cGMP, cADPR,  Ca2+, and SA. Important enzymes are NOS, GC, cGMP-dependent  protein
  kinase, and ADPRC. PAL and PR-1  are two important defense genes activated by pathogens.
  Activation of  NOS by TMV infection increases NO levels, which activate GC and lead
  to  elevated cGMP levels. cGMP activates ADPRC, via a cGMP-dependent  protein kinase,
  which results in rising cADPR levels. cADPR activates  ruthenium red (RR)-sensitive
  Ca2+ ion channels, which leads  to higher cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Ca2+ induces  SA
  biosynthesis, perhaps by activation of PAL gene  expression. The SA-induced MAP
  kinase, SIPK, may play a role in SA  signaling through NPR1. NPR1 transmits the
  SA signal to the  PR-1 gene via its interaction with members of the  TGA/OBF family
  of transcription factors, which bind the  SA-responsive TGACG element of the PR-1
  promoter. In a  separate branch of the pathway, NO inhibits cytosolic aconitase
  and may  convert it into a iron regulatory protein (IRP), thereby facilitating  an
  increase in intracellular free Fe2+. GSNO and SNAP are  NO donors whereas PTIO is
  an NO scavenger.
