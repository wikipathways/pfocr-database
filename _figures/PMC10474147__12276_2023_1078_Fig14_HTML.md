caption: This figure illustrates the key features of oxeiptosis. Oxeiptosis is activated
  in response to oxidative stress induced by ROS or ROS-generating agents, such as
  viral pathogens. The KEAP1/PGAM5/AIFM1 signaling pathway plays a central role in
  oxeiptosis, in which AIFM1 is dephosphorylated under oxidative stress conditions
  via the regulatory action of PGAM5. Dephosphorylated AIFM1 is translocated from
  mitochondria to the nucleus, leading to chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation,
  ultimately resulting in cell death.
