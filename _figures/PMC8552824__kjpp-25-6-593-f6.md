caption: The biological production of H2S in the kidney is mediated by the transsulfuration
  pathway. CSE and CBS generate H2S by using L-cysteine and homocysteine as substrates.
  PAG and CBS are inhibitor of CSE and CBS respectively, and NaHS is the exogenous
  H2S donor. H2S elongates primary cilia by activating ERK with concomitant upregulation
  of Sec10 and Arl13b. H2S, hydrogen sulfide; CBS cystathionine β-synthase; CSE, cystathionine
  γ-lyase; HA, hydroxylamine; PAG, propargylglycine.
