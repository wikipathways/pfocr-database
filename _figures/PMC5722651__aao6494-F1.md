caption: (A) Fossil versus renewable pathways to value-added amines. The nonrenewable
  path proceeds via the Haber-Bosch process and uses petrochemicals as reaction partners
  to obtain simple amines, which are further functionalized. The alternative pathway
  uses natural amino acids, which are directly coupled with alcohols derived from
  renewable resources to obtain fully bio-based N-alkyl amino acids. The fundamental
  challenge is the development of efficient and sustainable catalytic methods to enable
  this step. ee, enantiomeric excess. (B) Various areas of application of N-alkyl
  amino acids.
