caption: The central role of hepatocyte apoptosis in liver injury. Vulnerable hepatocytes
  undergo apoptosis when stressed. Apoptosis can be initiated via Kupffer cell release
  of TNF-α, leading to activation of JNK. Activated NK and NK T cells release Fas
  or TRAIL, and interferon gamma, which up-regulates Fas or TRAIL release, leading
  to death receptor–mediated hepatocyte apoptosis. Hepatocyte apoptosis can also occur
  via activation of the intrinsic pathway (not shown here). Apoptotic hepatocytes
  are engulfed Kupffer cells, leading in turn to their activation. Activated Kupffer
  cells secrete TNF-α, interleukins, and interferon to promote the inflammatory response.
  They also secrete transforming growth factor β, leading to activation of stellate
  cells. Stellate cells can also be directly activated by apoptotic bodies. Activated
  stellate cells secrete collagen type I, leading to liver fibrosis. Attenuation of
  hepatocyte apoptosis, or forced apoptosis of activated stellate cells, such as with
  proteasomal inhibitors or TRAIL, can lead to resolution of fibrosis.
