caption: Cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ inhibits WNT target gene expression via DVL phosphorylation
  and β-catenin activation, whereas nuclear YAP promotes WNT signalling by cooperating
  with β-catenin. YAP/TAZ may also be activated by activated β-catenin. MST1 and YAP
  can indirectly inhibit the regulatory subunit IKKγ, leading to the inhibition of
  NF-κB. Besides, YAP and NF-κB can both inhibit and activate each other indirectly
  in different situations. In addition, YAP/TAZ may activate Notch signalling through
  transcriptional regulation. Arrows and blunt ends indicate activation and repression,
  respectively. The dotted line represents the indirect regulation. Fz, frizzled;
