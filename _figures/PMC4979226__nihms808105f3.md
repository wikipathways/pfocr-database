caption: Schematic illustration of the D2 participation on the feedback system regulation
  of hypothalamic–pituitary axis (HPT). In the hypothalamus, D2 is strategically located
  on the lining floor and infralateral wall of the third ventricle (III), near TRH-expressing
  hypophysiotropic neurons located in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In the anterior
  pituitary gland, D2 is co-expressed with TSH in pituitary thyrotrophs. The drop
  in serum T3 is sensed by TRH-expressing hypophysiotropic neurons in the PVN and
  the pituitary TSH-secreting thyrotrophs, de-repressing the expression of TRH and
  TSH-β genes, respectively. In contrast, the drop in serum T4 can only de-repress
  TRH and TSH thanks to D2, which translates the serum T4 signal by locally converting
  it to T3 in the PVN and in the pituitary thyrothrophs, therefore establishing an
  important signaling pathway that controls thyroid hormone economy.
