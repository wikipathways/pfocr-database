caption: Models of the alphavirus life cycle and the virus-induced structures in mammalian
  (A) and insect (B) cells. Following attachment and receptor binding (steps 1 and
  2), SINV is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (step 3). Low-pH-mediated
  fusion (step 4) in the late endosome releases nucleocapsid (NC), and after disassembly
  (step 5), nonstructural polyproteins are translated (step 6) from viral mRNA. Replication
  proteins and host proteins along with the viral RNA form replication complexes (step
  7) that replicate and transcribe (step 8) viral RNA and induce spherule structures
  on endosomal and plasma membranes. Internalization of replication spherules from
  the plasma membrane via vesicles and subsequent fusion of these vesicles with lysosomes
  generate CPV-I structures. Structural polyprotein translated from the subgenomic
  RNA (step 9) is processed into capsid protein (CP), and envelope polyproteins that
  are translocated (step 10) to the ER, processed by signalase (step 11) and glycosylated
  and transported through the Golgi complex, where fuin cleavage removes E3 from E2
  (step 12) to the PM via the secretory pathway. CP binds genome RNA to form NC (step
  13) that binds the glycoprotein spikes on the PM and virus buds from PM (step 14).
  CPV-II structures that contain glycoprotein spikes and attached NCs originate from
  the Golgi complex and accumulate in the cells at the late stage of infection. In
  mosquito cells, replication spherules are present only on large internal vesicles
  that also contain NCs and internally budded virus particles. Glycoprotein-containing
  vesicles are internalized from the plasma membrane, and fusion of smaller internalized
  vesicles produces large cytopathic vacuoles. Virus particles bud into the large
  cytopathic vacuoles (step 15), which also contain replication spherules and nucleocapsid
  cores. Internally budded virions accumulate in large vesicles. Spherules on the
  plasma membrane and structurally distinct CPV-I and CPV-II structures are not observed
  in mosquito cells.
