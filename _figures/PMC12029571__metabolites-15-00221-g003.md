caption: 'Schematic representation of the main metabolic pathways involved in cancer.
  The red line indicates the reduction in xanthine oxidase (XOR) expression, which
  is correlated with various forms of cancer. Folate, as 5-MTHF helps convert homocysteine
  to methionine, essential for DNA methylation. However, folate deficiency or excess
  can disrupt DNA repair and cell replication. Additionally, folate receptors (FR-α
  and FR-β) are overexpressed in many tumors. In cancer cells, purine nucleotides
  are synthesized via the de novo biosynthetic pathway: PRPP is generated directly
  to form IMP, which in turn contributes to the production of various intermediates
  such as AMP, GMP, and inosine. Hypoxanthine, a key purine derivative, is linked
  to tumor progression. Loss of xanthine oxidase (XOR) expression is related to various
  forms of cancer. The exDNA acts as a ligand for Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and
  activates the NF-kB pathway, enhancing tumor-promoted inflammation. Cyclic GMP-AMP
  (cGAMP), synthesized in response to DNA damage, activates the STING pathway, supporting
  tumor inflammation. Created with BioRender.com'
