caption: '(A) The key aspects of glycogen and trehalose metabolism, their connections,
  and the enzymes involved. Trehalose synthesis and cryoprotectant production pathways
  are highlighted. It involves two key enzymes: Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS):
  Which catalyzes the formation of trehalose-6-phosphate from glucose-6-phosphate
  and UDP-glucose. Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP): Converts trehalose-6-phosphate
  into trehalose by removing the phosphate group (Silljé et al., 1999; Badaruddin
  et al., 2013; Seo et al., 2018). (B) This diagram illustrates glycolysis, a vital
  metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, producing ATP. The process
  includes ten enzymatic steps, regulated by three key enzymes that manage its flow
  (Kunieda et al., 2006; Harris and Harper, 2015)'
