caption: Upon phagocytosis, the phagosome acquires the GTPase Rab5 via fusion with
  early endosomes. The Rab5 effector ALS2 was also upregulated. Rab5 acts to recruit
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), which generates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate
  (PI3P) and recruits early endosomal antigen (EEA1) from endosomes. EEA1 is a Rab5
  effector protein and its upregulation triggers fusion of the phagosome with a late
  endosome. During the phagosome maturation process, Rab7 replaces Rab5 and the intermediate
  phagosome fuses with late endosomal vesicles, acquiring a suite of proteins that
  includes the proton-ATPase pump (V-ATPase), lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein
  1 (LAMP1), CD63, and lysosomal hydrolases. Vacuoles containing Chromera fuse with
  late endosomes/lysosomes as indicated by the upregulation of genes encoding Rab7,
  LAMP1, and CD63 (plus late endosomal/ lysosomal adapter, SNAP-associated protein
  and vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 (VAMP7) “not shown”). The observed upregulation
  of the lysosomal V-ATPase signals the formation of phagolysosomes, which are typically
  rich in hydrolytic enzymes and have an extremely low pH, presumably in order to
  eliminate Chromera. Genes in red text are downregulated, while those in blue are
  upregulated
