caption: Ciliary signaling pathways. (A–B) Hedgehog signaling pathway (A) In the absence
  of hedgehog (Hh) ligand the intraflagellar transport machinery moves the transcription
  factor glioma-associated oncogene (GLI) and suppressor of fused (SuFu) to the ciliary
  tip. Patched-1 (PTCH1) located in the surface of the ciliary membrane inhibits Smoothened
  (SMO), which is located in the cytoplasm, keeping GLI in an inactive form (GLIR).
  The inactive transcription factor is transported back to the cell body and enters
  the nucleus where represses the expression of genes such as CCND1, N-MYC, GLI1,
  GLI2, and PATCH1. (B) Binding of ligand (Hh) to PTCH1 leads to the formation of
  oligomers, which are degraded in endosomes, reliving the repression of SMO, and
  causing its re-localization to the ciliary tip. SMO interacts with SuFu leading
  to the maturation of GLI into its active form (GLIA). GLIA is transported back to
  the cell body and enters the nucleus where activates transcription of target genes.
  (C, D) Canonical Wnt signaling pathway. (C) Without Wnt ligands, β-catenin is ubiquitinated
  and degraded by the proteasome. The initial events of this pathway are regulated
  by a destruction complex composed of casein kinase 1α (CK1α), glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β (GSK-3β), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC),
  and Axin 1. In the absence of β-catenin, the nuclear T cell-specific transcription
  factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (TCF/LEF-1)-responsive elements are associated
  with transcriptional suppressors, such as Groucho (Gro) and Transducin-like enhancer
  of split-1 (TLE-1), keeping the pathway inactive. (D) When Wnt ligands bind the
  Frizzled (Fz) family receptors and its coreceptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein-5/6 (LRP5/6), Fz recruits Disheveled (Dvl) to inactivate the β-catenin destruction
  complex. Thus, β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus
  where replaces Gro/TLE, and acts as a transcriptional co-activator with TCF/LEF-1,
  inducing transcription of Wnt target genes. (E, F) Planar cell polarity signaling
  pathway. (E) In the absence of Wnt ligands the pathway is inactive. (F) When a signal
  is received by the Fz receptor a complex of proteins, including Dvl, is recruited
  at the plasma membrane. Dvl activates RHO-associated coiled-coil forming kinase
  (ROCK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JUNK) in parallel, resulting in cytoskeletal
  organization and regulation of ciliogenesis. This figure was created using Servier
