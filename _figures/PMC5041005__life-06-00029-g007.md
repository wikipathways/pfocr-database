caption: Stepwise improvement of a circular network of CMIO. The overall rate of the
  circular network was very slow with different reaction rates, where the slowest
  rate limits the overall rate of the circular network. If the slowest process were
  accelerated where the slowest reaction became faster than the second-slowest process,
  the second-slowest pathway became the limit of the overall rate of the network.
  Thus, the second-slowest process will be the next target, for which a second new
  gene emerging by a random mutation in CCSI would have accelerated the second-slowest
  reaction rate faster than other reaction processes. Repetitive step-by-step accelerations
  in the circular network by gene mutations in CCSI could have improved the whole
  metabolic circular processes, which gradually replaced the narrow arrows, indicating
  slow rates with the bold arrows indicating fast rates.
