caption: 'Overview of the kynurenine pathway (KP). Protein is first ingested and travels
  to the gut where is broken down into tryptophan (TRP) and other amino acids. Then,
  it travels to the large intestine where it is absorbed by the B0AT1 epithelial amino
  acid transport system. TRP, then, travels through the hepatic portal system to the
  liver where it is used or secreted into the blood stream for use in the peripheral
  or brain tissues. TRP has three major metabolic pathways: incorporation into proteins,
  production of serotonin, or the breakdown via the KP. The various KYN metabolites
  are either neurotoxic, neuroprotective, and/or immunomodulatory. Within the KP,
  there are two major breakdown areas: the hepatic route where TDO is the rate-limiting
  enzyme and the peripheral route where IDO-1/IDO-2 are the rate-limiting enzymes.
  Within the peripheral route, only dendritic cells, macrophages, microglia, eosinophils,
  fibroblasts, and endothelial cells have been show to contain IDO. In recent years,
  there have been a number of links between IDO, KYN, and various KP metabolites to
  various allergic diseases. Recently, Ruas et al., have also shown a connection between
  activation of skeletal muscle PGC-1α1 and modulation of the KP resulting in resiliency
  to stress-induced depression. Although this pathway may be a critical link between
  depression, allergic disease, and exercise, it has yet to be elucidated.'
