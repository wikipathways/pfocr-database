caption: Model showing feedback regulation of Syk upon GPVI and GPIbα activation in
  human platelets. Clustering of GPVI and GPIbα upon agonist binding activates platelets
  initiated by src family kinases (SFKs) and the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). SFK
  activation leads to dual phosphorylation of the “immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motifs” (ITAMs), which represents a docking site for the two src homology 2 (SH2)
  domains of Syk. The interaction between Syk-(SH2)2 domains and dually tyrosine-phosphorylated
  ITAMs recruits and translocates Syk to lipid rafts of the platelet cell membrane.
  Syk tyrosine phosphorylation of Y525/526 (kinase domain) and Y352 (interdomain-B)
  by autophosphorylation and SFKs leads to a fully activated kinase. Consequently,
  specific Syk substrates and regulatory proteins, such as LAT, PLCγ2, SLP65, vav,
  and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3k) are tyrosine-phosphorylated and recruited to
  a “LAT signalosome” complex. Activation of the Syk substrate PLCγ2 produces the
  release of ADP (from platelet δ-granules) and of TxA2 via elevation of InsP3 and
  Ca2+. These secondary messengers enhance platelet activation via specific GPCRs,
  which also involves activation of distinct PKC isoforms. GPVI/GPIbα not only induce
  Syk tyrosine phosphorylation but also Syk phosphorylation on S297, which is located
  within the interdomain-B. GPVI/GPIbα-induced Syk S297 phosphorylation is mediated
  by PKC and decreases Syk tyrosine phosphorylation/activation. The cAMP/PKA pathway
  reduces the PKC response. It is proposed that Syk S297 phosphorylation represents
  an important mechanism for Syk feedback inhibition.
