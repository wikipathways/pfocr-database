caption: (A). Schematic representation of HA synthesis. The figure illustrates the
  synthesis of UDP-GlcA by the enzyme UGDH, which catalyzes the double oxidation of
  carbon 6 of glucose to glucuronate, eventually producing 2 NADH molecules. The synthesis
  of UDP-GlcNAc is achieved through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) or by
  recycling GlcNAc during HA turnover. The enzyme UXS1 catalyzes the decarboxylation
  of UDP-GlcA to UDP-Xylose. (B). Schematic representation of CD44, the main HA receptor
  on the cell surface, and the alternative signaling pathways downstream of CD44,
  including Ras, PI3K, and Rho. These signaling cascades ultimately lead to the activation
  of ABC transporters in the nucleus
