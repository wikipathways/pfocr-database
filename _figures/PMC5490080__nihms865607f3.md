caption: ROS are associated with the generation of CIN. (For interpretation of the
  references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
  of this article.) ROS can interfere with multiple aspects of the mitotic pathway
  leading to changes in ploidy (green box). ROS can also induce oxidative post-translational
  modifications (OPTMs) of proteins important for mitosis and/or cytokinesis, which
  can result in protein unfolding and malfunction. Thus, oxidative damage to mitotic
  components could affect their proper activity, leading to abnormal mitosis and CIN.
  Proteins of the cytoskeleton, molecular motors, kinetochore and centrosomal proteins
  are found oxidized in a context of oxidative stress (yellow box). It remains to
  be determined if components of the SAC signaling or the chromosome passenger complex
  (CPC) are also prone to OPTMs.
