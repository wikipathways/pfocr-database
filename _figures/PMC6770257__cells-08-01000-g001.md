caption: 'Stress assemblies and the inhibition of trafficking in the early secretory
  pathway. In growing conditions, COPII (Coatomer complex II) coated vesicles (blue)
  bud from ER (budding yeast) and ER Exit Sites (ERES) (Drosophila S2 cells) whereas
  COPI (Coatomer complex I) coated vesicles (red) bud from the Golgi. (A): In yeast,
  a subset of secretory transport mutants causes inhibition of trafficking in the
  early secretory pathway and leads to the formation of multiple P-bodies. These mutants
  are more sensitive to salt leading to an increase of calcium in the cytoplasm and
  triggering the formation of specific P-bodies containing Pat1 and Scd6 in a calmodulin
  dependent manner. (B): In Drosophila S2 cells, the nutrient stress of amino acid
  starvation also inhibits protein transport in the early secretory pathway and leads
  to the formation of Sec bodies. Amino-acid starvation appears to lead to dPARP16
  activation that MARylates the Sec16 SRDC (Serum Responsive Domain Conserved) leading
  to Sec body formation. Whether Ca++ imbalance is also important remains to be established.'
