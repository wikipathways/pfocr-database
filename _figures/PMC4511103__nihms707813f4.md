caption: In different model organisms apoptosis and caspase activity have been observed
  to induce secretion of mitogenic factors, thereby promoting hyperplastic overgrowth
  or tissue regeneration. Mitogenic factors are indicated in pink and question marks
  indicate uncertainty. A. In Drosophila inhibition of caspases by P35 renders cells
  in an “undead” state unable to complete apoptosis. This results in the activation
  of p53 and JNK, triggering the release of the Wg and Dpp mitogens, thereby promoting
  hyperplasic overgrowth. B. In Drosophila, temporal and spatial apoptosis (in-dependently
  of p35) induces tissue regeneration via compensatory proliferation by secretion
  of Wg. A dP53/JNK positive feedback loop is essential for the apoptotic response.
  C. In Drosophila differentiating neurons induce a different compensatory proliferation
  pathway, via hedghog (Hh), in a manner requiring both DrICE and Dcp-1. Hh stimulates
  the proliferation of non-neuronal cells. D. In Hydra, head regeneration post midgut
  bisection is dependent upon caspase activity, where apoptotic cells secrete Wnt3
  promoting CP. E. In newts and planaria, amputation is characterized by apoptosis
  and caspase activity in the wound site. However it still unknown whether this apoptotic
  response is responsible for the release of Wnt and Hh. F. In Xenopus, amputation
  of the tail results in caspase activity, whereas inhibition of caspase-9 and 3 prohibits
  cell proliferation and the regenerative process. It remains to established whether
  this form of CP is mediated by Wnt signaling. G. In mice, wound repair and liver
  regeneration is dependant upon caspase -3 and -7 which are necessary for proper
  induction of these processes. Caspase-3 mediates the proteolytic processing of iPLA2,
  which in turn produces archidonic acid the precursor of PGE2, a known stimulator
  of stem cell proliferation, tissue regeneration and wound repair.
