caption: Mechanisms of regulated necrosis in the intestine of FADDIEC-KO mice. (A)
  In the colon of mice bearing an intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion
  of Fadd (FADDIEC-KO mice), the bacterial flora elicits Toll-like receptor (TLR)
  signaling, resulting in the MYD88-dependent synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-6. These
  stimulate immune cell infiltration of the intestinal mucosa. Moreover, by binding
  to TNF receptor 1 (TNFR) on the surface of IECs, TNF activates a signaling pathway
  that involves the deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD) and receptor-interacting
  protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIP1 and RIP3), resulting in the necrotic death of IECs.
  Altogether, these molecular and cellular cascades underlie the severe colic disease
  that characterizes FADDIEC-KO mice. (B) FADDIEC-KO mice also manifest the RIP3-dependent
  loss of IECs in the small intestine and develop enteritis. However, this does not
  appear to be triggered by the bacterial flora, nor to rely on MYD88-dependent gene
  transactivation. Interestingly, the small intestine of FADDIEC-KO mice is characterized
  by a consistent reduction in the Paneth cell compartment. This results in impaired
  secretion of antimicrobials, in turn allowing for increased bacterial proliferation
  and (at least theoretically) facilitating the development of the concomitant colic
  disease. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive the activation of RIP3 in
  the small intestine of FADDIEC-KO mice remain obscure. In IECs from wild-type (WT)
  mice, FADD operates as an endogenous inhibitor of RIP3-driven regulated necrosis,
  thus preventing both colitis and enteritis. LPS, lipopolysaccharide.
