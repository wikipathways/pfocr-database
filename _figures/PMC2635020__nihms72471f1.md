caption: After the induction of apoptosis, selective permeabilization of lysosomal
  membrane results in the release of mature CD into cytosol. This leads to mitochondrial
  dysfunction. The release of CD may cause mitochondrial dysfunction either directly
  []; by ability of CD to cleave Bcl-2 family member Bid, subsequent formation of
  active Bax conformation and insertion of active Bax in the outer mitochondrial membrane
  []; or by interaction with unknown member of apoptotic machinery where CD enzymatic
  activity is not involved []. CD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction results in release
  of cyt c from mitochondria followed by activation of caspase-9 and -3 [,]. Alternatively,
  CD may trigger Bax activation via Bid-independent pathway resulting in release of
  apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and caspase-independent apoptosis []. In cancer
  cells, secreted pCD is recognized by a yet unidentified cell surface receptor. This
  interaction activates MAPK signaling pathway [,] leading to differential expression
  of important regulators of apoptosis [] and may therefore affect sensitivity of
  cancer cells to chemotherapeutics.
