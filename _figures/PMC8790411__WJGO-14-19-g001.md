caption: 'Brief overview of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related biomarkers in gastrointestinal
  cancers and some novel biomarkers being developed. A: Tumor genome-related biomarkers.
  The biomarkers in this category are divided into three groups: DNA damage and alteration,
  including tumor mutation burden, mismatch repair deficiency/high-microsatellite
  instability (dMMR/MSI-H), POLE, and copy number alteration (CNA); specific mutation
  genes, including IFN-γ pathway and MDM2; epigenetic alterations, including neoantigen-hypermethylation,
  CXCL9 epigenetic modification, TET1, and miRNAs; B: TME (tumor immune microenvironment)
  related biomarkers. PD-L1 expression and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are involved.
  In this review, CD8+ and CD39+CD8+ cells are mainly mentioned; C: Liquid biopsy
  biomarkers. CTCs, ctDNA, and exosomes are grouped into one group. Inflammatory markers
  taken from peripheral blood are divided into a separate subcategory, including lactate
  dehydrogenase and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; D: Patient’s characteristics.
  The patient’s gender, age, and intestinal microbiota are classified in this category.
  ICI: Immune checkpoint inhibitor; GI: Gastrointestinal; POLE: Polymerase gene epsilon;
  MDM2: Murine double minute 2; CXCL9: Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9; TET1: Ten
  eleven translocation 1; PD-1/L1: Programmed cell death-1/Ligand 1; ctDNA: Circulating
  tumor DNA; CTC: Circulating tumor cells; LDH: Lactate dehydrogenase; NLR: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
  ratio; TIL: Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.'
