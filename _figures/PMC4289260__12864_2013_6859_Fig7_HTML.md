caption: 'General flavonoid biosynthetic pathway adapted from Bowsher, et . al .,
  2008 []. The pathway showing synthesis of major flavonoid groups which include chalcones,
  flavanones, flavones, flavan-4-ols, flavan-3-ols, flavanols, isoflavones and anthocyanins.
  Panduratin A, a chalcone-derived compound was proposed to derive from pinocembrin
  chalcone with dotted arrows. Abbreviations: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H,
  cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumaroyl:coenzyme A ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; FS1/FS2, flavone synthase 1 and 2; IFS, isoflavone synthase;
  DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; F3H, flavanone-3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase;
  ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase and ANR, anthocyanidin
  reductase. Green box indicate that the unigenes mapped to the corresponding enzymes.
  The green boxes with green border consist of both up- and down-regulated unigene
  while green box with red border indicate down-regulated unigene. Brown border indicate
  that there were no unigene mapped to the corresponding enzymes, whereas the dotted
  borders indicate that the enzyme or the entire isoflavonoid pathway does not exist
  in Boesenbergia rotunda.'
