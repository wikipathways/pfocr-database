caption: RNA-sensing TLRs predominately localize to the endosome and include TLR3,
  TLR7, TLR8 and TLR13. TLR3 recognizes dsRNA. TLR7 and TLR8 contain one binding site
  with specificity for guanosine and uridine, respectively, and the other binding
  site for ssRNA. TLR13 recognizes bacterial 23S rRNA. All RNA-sensing TLRs form homodimers
  upon activation. TLR7, TLR8 and TLR13 engage MyD88 as an adaptor protein to form
  the ‘Myddosome’, which is a multi-protein complex of MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK2 and IRAK4.
  The ‘Myddosome’ recruits TRAF6 and TAK1 to activate MAPKs, NF-κB, and IRF5. TLR3
  signals through the adaptor protein TRIF to activate IRF3 via the TRAF3-TBK1–IKKε
  axis, or to activate MAPKs and NF-κB via the TRAF6-RIPK1-TAK1 axis. In plasmacytoid
  DCs, TLR7 activates IRF7 through TRAF6. It is noted that, for simplicity, this cell-type
  specific pathway is not illustrated separately. Nuclear translocation of activated
  transcription factors ultimately drives the expression of proinflammatory cytokines
  and type I and III IFNs. The RLR family members RIG-I and MDA5 localize to the cytoplasm
  and preferentially recognize 5’ di-or tri-phosphorylated short dsRNA and long dsRNA,
  respectively. ZCCHC3 facilitates RNA binding of RIG-I and MDA5. Structurally, RIG-I
  is held in an auto-repressed, closed conformation, while MDA5 likely adopts an open
  and flexible conformation. Cognate RNA-ligand binding induces conformational changes
  in RIG-I and MDA5 that expose their N-terminal CARDs, which are then subjected to
  posttranslational modifications (PTMs). PP1α or PP1γ-mediated dephosphorylation
  and TRIM25-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination at the CARDs induce further activation
  of RIG-I, which subsequently engages the chaperon protein 14–3-3ε for cytosol-to-mitochondrial
  translocation. Riplet modifies the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RIG-I with K63-linked-polyubiquitin
  chains. TRIM65 mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of MDA5 in its helicase domain,
  which induces MDA5 activation. The cytosol-to-mitochondria translocation of MDA5
  is facilitated by 14–3-3η. Both RIG-I and MDA5 interact with and activate MAVS on
  mitochondria (and also other organelles), which subsequently activates IRF3 via
  TBK1 or IKKε and NF-κB via the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. LGP2 has been shown to
  facilitate MDA5 activation, whereas it inhibits antiviral signaling by RIG-I. Type
  I IFNs induced by TLR or RLR signaling bind to the type I IFN receptor (consisting
  of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and activate the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer of activators
  of transcription (STAT) pathway to transcriptionally upregulate many ISGs including
  TLRs and RLRs themselves.
