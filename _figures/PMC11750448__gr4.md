caption: A network view depicting hub metabolites, their associated miRNAs, and the
  target genes within the corresponding metabolic pathway. In mediation analysis,
  five metabolites and their associated miRNAs (N = 59) showed a significant mediation
  effect on all three asthma outcomes—peripheral blood eosinophilia, AHR, and airflow
  obstruction—at a 5% FDR. The network view also integrates the genes targeted by
  the associated miRNAs within the metabolomic pathways of the respective metabolites
