caption: Men operon in E. coli. Part of the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway is shown
  on the left. The genomic region containing this operon is shown on the right. Inside
  the enzyme nodes (rectangle) of the pathway, the names of the matched genes are
  shown in brackets, e.g., b2264 encodes a bifunctional protein with two enzymatic
  activities (). The gene filled with gray (b2263) encodes a product that is currently
  annotated as a hypothetical protein.
