caption: A model in roots for PIN2 polar distribution via a ROP signaling mechanism.
  Data indicate that the auxin-mediated inhibition of polar PIN2 internalization is
  regulated by the SPK1–ROP6–RIC1 pathway. Auxin is proposed to activate the SPK1–ROP6–RIC1
  pathway and inhibit PIN2 internalization. The localized inhibition of PIN2 internalization
  via ROP6 signaling causes PIN2 to be retained in the PM, which generates a positive
  feedback mechanism for maintaining polar PIN2 distribution to the PM.
