caption: The regulations of iron metabolism and redox homeostasis in cancer cells.
  Cancer cells display higher iron transporting, storage, and bioavailability as well
  as increased levels of glutathione (GSH) and GPX4 for detoxification in contrast
  to normal cells. Iron regulatory proteins (IRP1/2) play a central role in maintaining
  an adequate iron homeostasis in cancer cells by regulating the stability of each
  mRNA differentially [increasing for transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) and SLC11A2, while
  decreasing for light chain (FTL)/H protecting cells]. The classical marker of hypoxia,
  HIF-1α, also supports the stabilization of TFRC, IRP1/2, as well as FTL/H to promote
  both iron absorption and availability in cancer cells.
