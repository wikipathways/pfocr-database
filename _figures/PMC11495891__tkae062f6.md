  EVs promote vascular regeneration through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; adapted
  with permission from ref. [92], copyright 2023, the authors; (b) schematic diagram
  of P-EV fabrication and targeted therapy for angiogenesis; adapted with permission
  from ref. [93], copyright 2021, the authors; (c) schematic diagram of the assembly
  of engineered artificial stem cells (Tβ4-ASCs) and their cardioprotective effects
  on the sustained release of Tβ4 exosomes in myocardial infarction; adapted with

  genetic editing enhance phagocytosis and mitigate inflammation for the I/R; adapted
