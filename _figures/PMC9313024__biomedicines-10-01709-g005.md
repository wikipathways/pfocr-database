caption: Consequences of PLP1 point mutations on the cellular physiology. The mutant
  PLP1 accumulates inside the oligodendrocytes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
  and they cannot be delivered to the cell membrane. The accumulation is caused by
  the stable biding of a PLP1 transmembrane domain with calnexin, an ER chaperon protein.
  The prolonged binding of these two proteins prevents the proper functioning of the
  ER-associated protein degradation pathway to correctly eliminate the misfolded proteins.
  Moreover, the cytoplasmic accumulation of misfolded PLP1 and DM20 activates the
  unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway that aims to rescue the cell by stopping
  protein translation, degrading misfolded proteins, and increasing the production
  of chaperon proteins responsible of protein folding. When all the rescue mechanisms
  of the UPR are in vain, the ultimate response is to induce apoptosis by the activation
  of the CHOP pathway.
