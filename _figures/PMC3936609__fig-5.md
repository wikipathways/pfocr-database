caption: IL-6-mediated Jak-STAT3 signaling pathway. IL-6 signals through a cell-surface
  type 1 cytokine receptor complex composed of the ligand-binding protein of IL-6Rα
  and the signal-transducing component gp130 (glycoprotein of 130 kDa). IL-6 can also
  bind to soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), which lacks a membrane-signaling domain,
  and then with gp130 to mediate Jak phosphorylation and activation. Activated Jak
  family tyrosine kinases further phosphorylate STAT3, which in turn translocate to
  the nucleus and regulate target gene transcription. Many types of growth factors,
  such as EGF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), FGF, and insulin-like type
  I growth factor (IGF), can aggregate with respective receptors and activate STAT3
  signaling pathways.
