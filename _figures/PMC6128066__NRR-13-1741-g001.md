caption: 'Effects of energy metabolism and lactate-mediated responses in inner retinal
  synapses.Müller cells receive energy substrates from either blood glucose or from
  extracellular lactate within the retina. Both energy substrates are able to enter
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle as Acetyl coenzyme A (AcetylcoA) formed
  by pyruvate, resulting in production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the mitochondria.
  Lactate, however, is also shuttled to surrounding nerve cells, such as BPCs and
  RGCs, where it may be used as an energy substrate. Moreover, lactate may also function
  as a signaling molecule by G protein-coupled receptor 81 (GPR81) activation, which
  results in a Gi-mediated pathway inhibition of adenylate cyclase (AC) followed by
  reduced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. In turn, this will result
  in diminished neurotransmitter release. Additionally, Müller cells take up extracellular
  glutamate to prevent excitotoxic damage of the RGC. GLUT: Glucose transporter; MCTs:
  monocarboxylate transporters; EAAT: excitatory amino acid transporter; NMDA: N-methyl-D-asparate;
  RGC: retinal ganglion cell; BPC: bipolar cell.'
