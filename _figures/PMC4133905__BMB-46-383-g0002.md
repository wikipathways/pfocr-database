caption: A normal, physiological insulin signaling transduction (left) and an altered
  pathway following insulin withdrawal (right) in adult hippocampal neural stem cells.
  Insulin signaling enhances cell survival through activation of PI3K and Akt, which
  inhibit GSK3 and disinhibiting mTOR at normal state. In contrast, insulin withdrawal
  leads to inactivation of PI3K and Akt, and subsequent disinhibition of GSK-3 and
  inhibition of mTOR, triggering autophagy induction.
