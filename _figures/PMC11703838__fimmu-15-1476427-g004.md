caption: Crosstalk pathways between TCSCs and immune cells. (A) soluble molecules
  Both TCSCs and immune cells can release soluble molecules that facilitate information
  exchange and control one another’s reactions and behaviors, creating a dynamic web
  of interactions. (B) Metabolite Metabolites between TCSCs and immune cells can change
  each other’s phenotypic and functional states, further controlling their interactions.
  (C) EVs Immune cells and TCSCs can both release exosomes, which are microscopic
  vesicles that carry particular proteins and genetic information that are transferred
  from one cell to another to facilitate information sharing and function regulation.
  (D) Immune checkpoint TCSCs and immune cells recognize each other through ligands
  and receptors, forming signaling pathways that regulate immune responses and shape
  the immune microenvironment
