caption: Simplified scheme showing the critical role of Class IA PI3Ks in multiple
  cellular functions. Upon PI3Ks activation, PI(3,4,5)P3 is produced and recruits
  Akt at the cell membrane where it becomes phosphorylated at The308 by PDK1 and at
  Ser473 by mTORC2. Fully activated Akt phosphorylates a variety of effector molecules
  including the TSC1/2, BAD, FOXO, GSK-3β, and p27 which then control cell growth,
  metabolism, survival, cell cycle, or migration. PI(3,4,5)P3 also activates GEFs
  or GAPs which then regulate the activity of small GTPases controlling cell motility.
  The PI(3,4,5)P3 levels produced by PI3Ks are regulated by the PTEN phosphatase which
  counteracts the PI3K reaction by dephosphorylating the 3-position of the inositol
  ring of PI(3,4,5)P3 yielding back PI(4,5)P2.
