caption: RAS/SKP2-driven K63-linked ubiquitination of LKB1 modulates LKB1 activation.
  We demonstrated that SKP2-SCF is a direct ubiquitin ligase for liver LKB1 and that
  oncogenic RAS protein is an upstream regulator of the LKB1/AMPK axis, in which AMPK
  exists in a heterotrimeric complex (α/β/γ subunits) and is activated by LKB1-mediated
  Thr172 (T172) phosphorylation of AMPKα. Mechanistically, RAS/SKP2-mediated K63-linked
  polyubiquitination of LKB1 regulates LKB1 activity by maintaining the integrity
  of the LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex and thus the function of LKB1 in cancer cell survival
  following energy stress. Interrupting the RAS/SKP2/LKB1 pathway by administration
  of a SKP2 inhibitor may be a potential strategy for cancer treatment, and further
  studies are required to fully understand how this pathway relates to cancer development.
