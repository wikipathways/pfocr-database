  Previously established pathway. (B) Pathway proposed in this study. (C) Glutamine
  regeneration step. Glu, glucose; Gly, glycerol; PYR, pyruvate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate;
  G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; E4P, erythrose 4-phosphate;
  DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phophate; DHQ, 3-dehydroquinate; DDH, 3-dehydroshikimate
  dehydratase; PDC, protocatechuate decarboxylase; CDO, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase;
  ADO, anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase. ppsA encodes phosphoenolpyruvate synthase; tktA
  encodes transketolase; aroG encodes DAHP synthase; aroB encodes DHQ synthase; aroE
  encodes shikimate dehydrogenases; aroL encodes shikimate kinase; trpEG encodes anthranilate
  synthase; glnA encodes glutamine synthase.
