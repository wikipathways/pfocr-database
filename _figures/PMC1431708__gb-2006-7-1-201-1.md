caption: Well characterized drugs that inhibit prenylation can also be used to inhibit
  viruses. The biosynthetic pathway from acetyl CoA to squalene and then on through
  multiple other steps (not shown) to ubiquinone, cholesterol and dolichol is shown.
  Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and thereby prevent the synthesis of mevalonate
  and subsequent downstream lipids; statins also inhibit the replication of HIV [17].
  Farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranyl pyrophosphate are the substrates for farnesyltransferase
  and geranylgeranyltransferase I and II, respectively. These enzymes catalyze the
  prenylation of proteins (blue hexagons), with farnesyltransferase catalyzing the
  addition of the 15-carbon farnesyl prenyl lipids to the cysteine of the tetrapeptide
  CXXX (where X is one of a possible three amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of
  the protein) and geranylgeranyltransferase I and II catalyzing the addition of 20-carbon
  geranyl prenyl lipids to CXXX, CC or CXC motifs. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors
  (FTI) block the farnesylation of proteins such as Ras and also inhibit the replication
  of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) [18,19]. Similarly, geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitors
  (GGTI) block the geranylation of proteins such as Rho and also inhibit the replication
  of HIV [17]. The prenylation of Ras and Rho proteins promotes their association
  with membranes and is therefore necessary for the targeting of these proteins to
  the plasma membrane, where they function.
