caption: Mitochondrial versus cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations and their ability to activate
  matrix dehydrogenases. Action potential firing is reflected by cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations,
  which determine the steady-state increase in matrix [Ca2+]m with superimposed [Ca2+]m
  oscillations and concomitant activation of matrix dehydrogenases. Activation due
  to the PKA pathway is also indicated, demonstrating phosphorylation (red circles)
  of (i) IF1 hypothetically forming bridges (yellow) between the neighboring dimers
  of the ATP synthase within a row of dimers (four dimers are depicted with the indicated
  H+ backflow that leads to ATP synthesis); (ii) NCLX promoting activation via the
  ΔΨm decrease; (iii) KATP channels (setting their sensing of ATP to ∼1 mM [ATP]);
  (iv) CaV channels, thus activating them. Similarly, the EPAC2A pathway (“EPAC”)
  reportedly activates TRPM2 and RyR. The dashed arrows, pointing to NADH, illustrate
  the sites where NAD+ is made from NADH due to pyruvate redox shuttles (). CaV, voltage-dependent
  Ca2+ channels; EPAC, exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP; FUM, fumarate;
  IC, isocitrate; MAL, malate; NCLX, mitochondrial sodium calcium exchanger; RyR,
  ryanodine receptor; SUCC, succinate.
