caption: Schematic representation of the TLR4–RAGE crosstalk participates in the HG-enhanced
  LPS-induced inflammation in BAMs (created with BioRender.com). HG firstly upregulated
  the levels of RAGE and TLR4 genes and protein expression in the BAM membrane and
  the secretion of pro-inflammatory-related mediators (such as HMGB1, S100A8/9, and
  AGEs) through the ROS/NF-κB pathway. Then, pro-inflammatory-related mediators bind
  to RAGE and TLR4, causing RAGE–TLR4 crosstalk (increasing the levels of RAGE and
  TLR4) to synergistically activate the downstream MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway and
  promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. When HG
  acts together with LPS, HG upregulates the levels of RAGE and TLR4 genes and protein
  expression, which can provide more receptor sites for LPS binding, and the LPS also
  upregulates the levels of RAGE and TLR4 genes and protein expression that can offer
  more receptor sites for pro-inflammatory-related mediators. The combination of HG
  and LPS through RAGE–TLR4 crosstalk further activates the downstream MyD88/NF-κB
  signaling pathway and exacerbates pro-inflammatory cytokine release in BAMs.

  description: Schematic representation of the TLR4–RAGE crosstalk participates in

    HG firstly upregulated the levels of RAGE and TLR4 genes and protein expression
    in the BAM membrane and the secretion of pro-inflammatory-related mediators (such

    pathway and promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and

    genes and protein expression, which can provide more receptor sites for LPS binding,
    and the LPS also upregulates the levels of RAGE and TLR4 genes and protein expression
    that can offer more receptor sites for pro-inflammatory-related mediators. The
    combination of HG and LPS through RAGE–TLR4 crosstalk further activates the downstream
