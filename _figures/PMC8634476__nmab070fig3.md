caption: The proposed molecular mechanisms by which fatty acids regulate placental
  angiogenesis. Fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (AA), EPA, and DHA, activate
  G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) on trophoblasts, thereby inducing activation
  of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In the downstream cascade, the binding of peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) to the PPAR-response element (PPRE) in
  the vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) promoter region is specifically
  enhanced (purple arrow). Note that fatty acids can directly activate PPARγ to enhance
  the transcription and release of VEGF-A. VEGF-A induces the expression of fatty
  acid-binding protein 4 (FABP-4) through delta-like ligand 4 (DLL-4)-Notch signal
  transduction between endothelial cells and is negatively regulated by forkhead box
  protein O1 (Foxo1) phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation induced by AKT
  activation (blue arrow). Additionally, fatty acids activate the GPR18 and mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and regulate the expression of angiopoietin-like
  4 (ANGPTL4) and FABP-5, which may also affect placental angiogenesis, although their
  exact molecular mechanisms have not been determined. AKT, V-Akt Murine Thymoma Viral
  Oncogene Homolog; CSL, CBFl/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1; NICD, Notch intracellular
  domain; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C. Dashed arrows
  indicate hypothetical relations not studied directly.
