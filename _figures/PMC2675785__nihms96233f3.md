caption: The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. A target protein degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway is first covalently modified by multiple ubiquitin (Ub) molecules in a three-stepped,
  highly regulated enzymatic process involving an Ub-activating (E1), Ub-conjugating
  (E2), and the Ub-ligating (E3) enzymes. The ubiquitinated protein is then escorted
  to the 26S proteasome, recognized by the 19S cap, de-ubiquitinated and then degraded
  by the catalytic 20S core into oligopeptides. The ubiquitin molecules are released
  and recycled.
