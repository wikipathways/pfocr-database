caption: (a) The protein cargos are transported from the Golgi to the basal body by
  vesicle trafficking in the cellular cytoplasm. In order to move ciliary cytosolic
  and membrane proteins, kinesin 2 and dynein 2, motor proteins associating with intraflagellar
  transport (IFT) complex, travel along the axoneme between the base and the tip of
  the cilium in an anterograde and retrograde direction respectively. (b) The primary
  cilium modulates several signal transduction pathways. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling
  is activated by binding of Shh to patched (Ptc1), releasing smoothened (Smo) and
  the downstream target gene transcription from inhibition. Canonical wingless (Wnt)
  signaling through low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)5/6 and
  Frizzled (Fzd) is inhibited by the primary cilium, whereas noncanonical Wnt signaling
  [planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway] requires the primary cilium to be activated
  by Dishevelled (Dvl) interacting with either Fzd or Inversin (Inv)/other PCP components
  such as Vangl2. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling through PDGF receptor
  (PDGFR) requires ciliary localization of the receptor to activate downstream targets.
  In response to fluid flow, calcium signaling is activated through mechanosensing
  by polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2) localized in the ciliary membrane.  ,
