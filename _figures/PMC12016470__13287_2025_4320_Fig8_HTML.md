caption: Sildenafil promotes osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs and suppresses bone
  loss by affecting TGF-β signaling. The appropriate concentrations of sildenafil
  enhanced the proliferation and migration of hMSCs in vitro, and promoted osteogenic
  differentiation of hMSCs both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, 10 mg/L sildenafil
  reduced bone loss in both OVX and TS mice. Sildenafil may promote osteogenic differentiation
  of hBMSCs by influencing the TGF-β signaling pathway. hMSCs, human mesenchymal stem
  cells; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; OVX, ovariectomized; TS, tail-suspended;
  hBMSCs, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells
