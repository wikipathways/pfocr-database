caption: Overview of the models used in this work. Starting with a choice of reactor
  (A), mass transfer for both the gas substrate uptake rates (B) and the volatile
  product recovery are modelled (C). For a chosen production organism (D), a model
  based on general microbial growth, overall stoichiometry and reaction thermodynamics
  is built (E), complemented with a more detailed stoichiometric pathway analysis
  (F). These models are used to run a process simulation (G) of which the learnings
  (H) are used to reevaluate the initial choices
