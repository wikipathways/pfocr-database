caption: Basic lipophilic compounds (B) pass through cell membranes and enter lysosomes.
  The acidic environment within the lysosome causes the majority of the compounds
  to become protonated (BH) and trapped. Compound accumulation can induce lysosome
  membrane permeablization and cause cell death. Concurrently, lysosomal dysfunction
  can potentially occur from a decrease of lysosomal enzyme activity due to either
  pH changes or direct enzymatic interactions. As a result, the autophagy process
  could be hindered. An increase of SQSTM1/p62 resulting from autophagy inhibition
  could further modulate activity of the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
