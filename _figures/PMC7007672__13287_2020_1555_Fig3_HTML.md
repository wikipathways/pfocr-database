caption: Molecular pathways in embryogenesis of the liver. Production of the liver
  parenchymal cells starts from the anterior part of the primary liver bud. FGF from
  cardiac mesoderm and BMP, which is mediated by SMAD4, interfere in hepatic induction
  through RAS/MAP kinase pathway and BMP signaling. GATA4 regulates expression of
  the secreted BMP4, which is highly expressed in the STM mesenchymal cells at the
  8-somite stage. At early somite stages WNT signaling acts around 7–11 somites to
  repress the expression of Hhex. At around 21 somites, the matrix surrounding the
  basal surface of the epithelium is degraded, and E-cadherin expression is downregulated
  in the hepatic cells by the action of MMPs. GATA4 and/or GATA6 cause hepatoblast
  development by transactivating the Hhex promoter. Around 25 somites, Onecut-1 and
  Onecut-2 are redundantly essential for hepatoblast migration. Prox1 also promotes
  hepatoblast proliferation and migration from the primary liver bud. Tbx3 normally
  promotes a hepatocyte fate and represses a cholangiocyte fate through the expression
  of Hnf4a and c/EBPa. FGF fibroblast growth factor, HNF hepatocyte nuclear factor,
