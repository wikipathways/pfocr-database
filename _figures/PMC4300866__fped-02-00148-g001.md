caption: 'Biological functions of the complement system. Inflammation: the activation
  of the complement system generates many anaphylatoxins, among which C3a, C4a, and
  C5a. The binding of C3a, C4a, and C5a to receptors on mast cells and basophils leads
  to the release of histamine and other vasoactive mediators. In response to the activation
  by anaphylatoxins, neutrophils release prostaglandins (PG), reactive oxygen and
  nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) as well as increase the expression
  of adhesion molecules, and chemokinesis. Monocytes and macrophages show similar
  response and secrete interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1 and IL-6). Phagocytosis: iC3b, C4b,
  and mainly C3b coat microorganisms and immune complexes, having opsonizing activity.
  Neutrophils and macrophages express complement receptors (CR1, CR2, and CR4), which
  bind C3b, C4b, and iC3b. This promotes the adherence of the microorganism to phagocytic
  host cells leading to phagocytosis. B cell activation and differentiation: the recognition
  of C3-tagged antigen plays an important role in B cell activation and differentiation.
  Cross-linking between complement receptor 2 (CR2) and B cell receptor (BCR) through
  C3d–antigen complexes lowers the threshold of B cell activation leading to migration,
  T cell/B cell interaction and antibody class-switch. Cell lysis: specific antibodies,
  MBL/ficolins, and spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 activate the complement on the surface
  of infectious microorganisms and lead to the formation of membrane-attack complexes
  (MAC), which cause their lysis. Immune complex clearance: immune complexes activate
  the complement system. The generated C3b binds to the complexes and to CR1 present
  on the surface of erythrocytes. During erythrocyte traffic through sinusoids in
  liver and spleen, resident phagocytes remove bound immune complexes leading to their
  clearance. Apoptotic cell removal: Mannose-binding lectin, ficolins and C1q bind
  debris of apoptotic cells, which are subsequently removed through binding to the
  C1qR and CR1 receptors on phagocytic cells.'
