caption: Summary of the main findings on HMEC-1. GlcN is incorporated into the cell
  by glucose transporters (purple line), then is incorporated into the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP), where the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-GlcNAc substrate
  is used by the OGT enzyme for O-GlcNAc (blue box) several proteins, while the enzyme
  OGA removes it. GlcN treatment increases O-GlcNAcylation (blue lines), reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production, and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2
  (Nrf2) expression in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells-1 (HMEC-1). The
  inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation, with OSMI-1, prevents (orange lines) ROS production
  and Nrf2 expression, suggesting that these processes are related. In addition, GlcN
  also could scavenge some ROS. Biorender.com GPx = glutathione peroxidase, CAT = catalase,
