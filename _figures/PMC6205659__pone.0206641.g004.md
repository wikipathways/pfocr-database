caption: The black, red, blue, light blue and crimson full and dotted box indicates
  that metabolites were detected by GC-MS from the alfalfa leaves, and the dotted
  box presents significant regulated metabolites in the inoculated leaves compared
  with the controls (VIP>1.0 and p<0.05). Yellow dotted box indicates that the metabolites
  were not detected by GC-MS from the alfalfa leaves, but were involved in the corresponding
  pathway. Green dotted ovals indicates that the metabolic pathway was associated
  with the regulated metabolites. (VIP, the variable importance for the projection;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle). Red color indicates
  that the compound was significantly upregulated at later infection stages. Blue
  color indicates that the compound was significantly downregulated at later infection
  stages. Light blue color indicates that the compound was significantly downregulated
  over time. Crimson color indicates that the compound was almost significantly upregulated
  over time.
