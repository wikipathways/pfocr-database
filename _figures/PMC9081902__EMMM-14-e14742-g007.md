caption: 'A pool of triglycerides (TG) resynthesized from the apically delivered free
  fatty acids (FA) is directed for storage in cytosolic lipid droplets (LD). Hydrolysis
  of TG in LD is mediated by several lipases: adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL),
  hormone‐sensitive lipase (HSL), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL). ATGL preferentially
  hydrolyzes lipids derived from the blood (via basolateral membrane of the enterocyte)
  and cleaved FAs are directed toward mitochondria for oxidation. Carboxylesterase
  2c (CES2C)‐mediated TG lipolysis also provides FAs for mitochondrial energy production,
  while the other product, diacylglycerol (DG), is designated for chylomicron (CM)
  synthesis. Another pathway leading to LD catabolism is lipophagy. Lysosomal acid
  lipase (LAL) digests TG within autophagosomes and released FA serve as a substrate
  in various metabolic pathways. Hypothesized toxicity of FA extensive LD mobilization
  results in elevated FA concentration—potential toxic outcomes of that event are
  discussed in the relevant chapter.'
