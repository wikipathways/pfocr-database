caption: mTORC1 pathway and regulation. mTORC1 is activated by insulin. Insulin/Akt
  signaling inhibits TSC1/2, thereby permitting the activation of the GTP-binding
  protein, Rheb. Rheb is the proximal activator of mTORC1. AMPK inhibits mTORC1 activity
  through indirect and direct mechanisms, phosphorylating TSC1/2 and the Raptor regulatory
  component of mTORC1. (Other trophic factors and pathways beyond insulin/Akt and
  AMPK, not shown for simplicity, also regulate mTORC1). mTORC1 downstream targets
  include proteins involved the mRNA translation, 4E-BP1 and p70S6K1, and those involved
  in autophagy, such as the initiator of autophagy, ULK1, and the master regulator
  of lysosomal biogenesis, TFEB. By regulating the activity of these and other proteins,
  mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis, which is required for synaptogenesis, learning,
  and memory, but can also impair autophagy, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction
  and neurotoxic protein aggregation (Aβ, phospho-tau, α-synuclein, etc.). Black arrows
  and red lines respectively represent positive and negative regulation.
