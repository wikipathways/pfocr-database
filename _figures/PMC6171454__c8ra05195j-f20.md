caption: . The proposed neuroprotective and geroprotective mechanism of EISO and its
  active components on C. elegans. EISO and santalol isomers likely acted through
  AKT-1 and ERK-MAPK mediated SKN-1 dependent pathway, which transactivates the stress-responsive
  genes gcs-1 and gst-4 that enhanced the tolerance to stress and extend the mean
  lifespan. The direct antioxidant activity, α-synuclein inhibitory potential, antiapoptotic
  activity, and CLK-1 dependency of EISO, α- and β-santalol can also contribute for
  the reduction of neurodegeneration and longevity extension in C. elegans.
