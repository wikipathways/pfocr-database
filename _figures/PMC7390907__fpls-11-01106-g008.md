caption: Genetic model of the Cu effects on Fe homeostasis in COPTOE. Deregulated
  Cu+ entrance by constitutive COPT overexpression under high Cu increased the Fe3+/Fe2+
  ratio in roots. COPTOE displayed Fe deficiency symptoms probably as a consequence
  of the lack of Fe assimilatory response (IRT1/FRO2), since under high Cu conditions
  COPTOE plants activated the expression of the bHLH-Ib factors but not FIT. Cu excess
  increased ROS that could activate FEP2/FEP3 expression, which up-regulate bHLH-Ib
  factors. BTS affected bHLH-IVc stability and expression of its target genes (FER1,
  FER3 and At-NEET). Fe deficiency affected tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway and
  O2 consumption that could further increase ROS production and inhibit Fe uptake
  through retrograde signaling.
