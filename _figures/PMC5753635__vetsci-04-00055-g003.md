caption: Glucose metabolism in feline hepatocytes. (1) Minimal to absent hepatic glucokinase
  activity [,,,], and no glucokinase gene expression []. No regulation of glucokinase
  by glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). Although the GCKR gene is present, GCKR
  mRNA expression and GKRP activity are absent [,]. (2) Upregulation of other hexokinases
  seems unlikely due to inhibition by glucose-6-phosphate, which is continuously formed
  by gluconeogenesis; (3) activities of rate limiting enzymes of gluconeogenesis (i.e.,
  pyruvate carboxylase, fructose-1,6-biphosphatase, and glucose-6-phosphatase) are
  upregulated [,]; (4) glucose-6-phosphate-mediated inhibition of hexokinase I, II
  and III may be overcome by activation of glucose disposal pathways that occur distal
  to the glucokinase-mediated phosphorylation step, promoting glucose oxidation pathways
  such as glycolysis (i.e., pyruvate kinase), fructolysis (i.e., fructokinase), pentose
  phosphate pathway (i.e., glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and anaerobic glycolysis
  (i.e., lactate dehydrogenase) [,] and stimulate glycogenesis; (5) minimal activity
  of hepatic glycogen synthase has been assumed []. However, glycogen content in the
  feline liver is similar to in dogs and humans []. Activation of glycogenesis by
  protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) may allow synthesis of glycogen when glucose
  is lacking, using gluconeogenic precursors such as amino acids [].
