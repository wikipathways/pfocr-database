caption: 'The differential network for the pathway “InlA-mediated entry of Listeria
  monocytogenes into host cells” in neuroblastoma tumors between HR and non-HR patients.
  Tan edges are associations that are stronger in non-HR patients, and red edges are
  stronger in HR patients. The edges are scaled proportionate to the DC score, and
  the nodes are scaled proportionate to the fold change in expression between the
  two groups. If the monotonized p-values are preferred, then two edges remain significant:
  SRC-CTNND1 and UBB-UBC.'
