caption: Membrane-trafficking pathways in polarized epithelial cells. Proteins, lipids
  and fluid are internalized from the apical (step 1a) or basolateral (1b) surfaces,
  and delivered to apical early endosomes (AEEs) or basolateral early endosomes (BEEs).
  Cargoes can recycle to the cell surface (2a/b), be delivered to multivesicular bodies
  (MVBs) (3a/b), from which they will be delivered to lysosomes (not shown), or they
  can be delivered to the common recycling endosome (CRE; 4a/b). There may be a direct
  pathway from the AEE to the apical recycling endosome (ARE; 4c). CRE cargoes are
  shuttled to the basolateral cell surface (5), or delivered to ARE (6), from where
  they gain access to the apical cell surface (7a). Apical-to-basolateral transcytosis
  may involve cargo transit from the ARE to CRE (7b). On synthesis in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (not shown), proteins are delivered by way of the Golgi stacks to the
  trans-Golgi network (TGN), to take either direct routes to the apical (8) or basolateral
  (10) surfaces, or indirect routes through the ARE (9) or CRE (11). Endocytic pathways
  are shown with black arrows; biosynthetic ones with red arrows. The inset shows
  a magnified view of the apical junctional complex (JC), which is comprised of the
  zonula occludens (ZO), the zonula adherens (ZA) and the macula adherens (MA).
