caption: Model. We propose that Wnt signaling acts to maintain lin-39 expression in
  all VPCs to prevent them from adopting the Fused fate. PRY-1 Axin and APR-1 APC
  act negatively to regulate the Wnt pathway, and BAR-1 β-catenin and POP-1 TCF act
  positively. In a cell in which the Ras pathway is inactive like P4.p, LIN-39 is
  required to adopt the 3° uninduced cell fate. In a cell in which the Ras pathway
  is active such as P6.p, we propose that the activity of both pathways leads to higher
  levels of LIN-39 expression, as has been reported by . We propose that this higher
  level of LIN-39 and/or other Wnt pathway targets is instructive in causing the VPC
  to adopt an induced cell fate. In a cell in which the Wnt pathway has been hyperactivated
  (e.g., pry-1 loss-of-function), higher levels of LIN-39 and/or other Wnt targets
  allows adoption of an induced cell fate in the absence of input from the Ras pathway.
