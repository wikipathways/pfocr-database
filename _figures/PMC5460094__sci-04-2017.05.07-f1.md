caption: UFAs regulate stemness of ovarian cancer cells through NF-κB. UFAs increase
  NF-κB activity, which upregulates mRNA expression of ALDHA1 and SCD1 desaturase.
  Increased SCD1 in turn promotes UFA synthesis from SFAs, forming a positive feedback.
  Inhibition of desaturases suppresses sphere formation with reduction in stem cell
  markers, although direct roles of UFAs in ovarian cancer stemness remain unclear.
  Thus, the UFA synthesis pathway regulates stemness of ovarian cancer cells, which
  can be responsible for cancer initiation, metastasis, drug resistance, and tumor
  relapse. UFA, unsaturated fatty acid; SFA, saturated fatty acid.
