caption: The BRAF pathway. a Activated BRAF-mutated protein leads to phosphorylation
  and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)1/2 proteins, which subsequently phosphorylate and activate
  ERK1/2 proteins. After activation, ERK proteins phosphorylate a variety of substrates,
  including multiple transcription factors and regulate several key cellular activities,
  such as proliferation, differentiation and angiogenesis, to promote tumour growth.
  b Inhibition of BRAF suppresses the ERK-mediated negative feedback of the epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in EGFR activation, formation of RAF protein
  dimers and CRAF-mediated reactivation of the MAPK signalling pathway. c Preclinical
  studies have shown efficacy with combination drugs targeting BRAF (BRAF inhibitor),
  MEK (MEK inhibitor) and EGFR (anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody); this triplet combination
  might be an interesting therapeutic approach in patients with BRAF-mutated mCRC.
  d Crosstalk between the RAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTor) signalling pathways after BRAF inhibition could play a determinant role in
  cell survival. Combining BRAF, EGFR and PI3K inhibitors could constitute another
  interesting therapeutic approach in patients with BRAF-mutated mCRC
