caption: The schematic shows that loss of PTEN activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which
  in turn upregulates SREBP and LDLr. LDL is then hydrolyzed to free fatty acids and
  free cholesterol (FC) in lysosome. The excess FC together with the fatty acyl CoA
  substrate is converted to CE by ACAT-1 and stored in LDs. LDL also serves as an
  important carrier of ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), such as AA, which promotes
  cell proliferation and tumor growth. The red arrows depict the consequences of CE
  depletion. Depletion of CE storage by ACAT-1 knockdown or ACAT inhibition disturbs
  cholesterol homeostasis by elevating FC levels and consequently downregulating expression
  levels of SREBP and LDLr. Subsequently reduced uptake of ω-6 PUFA from LDL suppresses
  cancer proliferation.
