caption: '(A–E) Graphical representation of the metabolic flux distribution in the
  central carbon metabolism at the indicated time points. Reaction names are taken
  from the model used for the flux variability analysis (). The arrow thickness is
  related to the average of the maximal and minimal value of the flux through each
  reaction relative to the growth rate at each time point, as follows: dashed lines
  for fluxes lower than 0.2 mmol/gDW, for values between 0.2 and 20 mmol/gDW the thickness
  is proportional to the flux and for fluxes higher than 20 mmol/gDW the thickness
  increments every 5 mmol/gDW (exact values are provided in ). Reactions that are
  far from equilibrium (i.e., with a Gibbs-free energy of at least 5 kJ/mol in either
  direction) are indicated with filled boxes, while empty boxes denote reactions that
  are close to equilibrium (i.e., with a Gibbs-free energy of at most 5 kJ/mol in
  both directions). The three main events of the adaptation process are indicated
  with roman numerals: I, decreased glycolytic flux and production of storage compounds;
  II, onset of the glyoxylate cycle; III, halting of the PP pathway. (F) Flux ranges
  through the reactions shown in (A–E). The reactions are grouped according to the
  pathway to which they belong and each group is separated by solid lines. The pathways,
  from top to bottom, are alternative carbon metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis,
  PP pathway, pyruvate metabolism, TCA/glyoxylate cycle and anaplerosis. The relative
  fluxes were scaled within each group to fit the interval between −1 and 1, taking
  into account the maximal and minimal values within each pathway. The maximal and
  minimal values for the reactions labeled as ‘(m+c)'' make reference to the net flux
  through that reaction in the cytoplasm plus the same reaction in the mitochondria,
  and the fluxes labeled as ‘Storage'' represent the amount of glucose residues being
  consumed (or produced) by trehalose and glycogen synthesis (or hydrolysis).'
