caption: αvβ3signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells. Ligation of αvβ3 with multiple
  ligands (i.e., osteopontin, BSP, or vitronectin) activates FAK, which interacts
  and activates PI-3 kinase []. The products of PI-3 kinase activity recruit PKB/Akt
  to the cell membrane where it is activated by phosphorylation and it phosphorylates
  several substrates to elicit a variety of biological responses, including cell survival,
  adhesion, and migration. Although NF-κB is potentially involved in the αvβ3 signal
  transduction pathway [], its role in this signaling pathway is not known for prostate
  cancer cells.
