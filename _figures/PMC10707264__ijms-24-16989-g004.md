  A possible signal transduction model of the chilling tolerance mechanism. After
  signal reception, stress-activated ROS signaling and hormone signaling modulate

  abscisic acid receptor PYR/PYL family; MKK: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase;
  MAPKKK17_18: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 17/18; MPK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; MEKK1: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1; CAT1: catalase;
  OXI1: serine/threonine-protein kinase OXI1; ACS1: 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate
  synthase 1; ETR/ERS: ethylene receptor; CTR1: serine/threonine-protein kinase CTR1;
