caption: 'Simplified representation of the NMD pathway in mammalian cells. (A) The
  Exon Junction Complex (EJC; composed by eIF4A3, RBM8A and MAGOH) is formed during
  splicing and deposited 20–24 nucleotides (nts) upstream of exon–exon junctions,
  remaining associated with the mRNA during its transport to the cytoplasm. (B) In
  the cytoplasm, the mRNA is translated by the ribosome. If the mRNA carries a premature
  translation termination codon (PTC), during the pioneer round of translation, i.e.,
  while the mRNA is still bound to the cap binding complex CBP80/20, the ribosome
  stops at the PTC. If the PTC is located more than 50–54 nts upstream of the last
  exon–exon junction, the ribosome is not able to displace downstream EJCs. Instead,
  when the ribosome stops at the PTC, UPF1 can interact with eRF3a, inducing premature
  translation termination that triggers NMD. For that, the SURF complex is formed
  by UPF1, eRF1, eRF3a, the SMG1c kinase complex and DHX34 associated with RUVBL1
  and RUVBL2. At this stage, both PYM1 and UPF3A can act as NMD repressors. (C) UPF2
  and UPF3B, either diffused in the cytoplasm (in case of EJC-independent NMD) or
  bound to the EJC, interact with UPF1, favoring its phosphorylation by SMG1 and the
  formation of the DECID complex. (D) Phosphorylated UPF1 recruits SMG6, which cleaves
  the mRNA near the PTC, and the SMG5-SMG7 dimer, which recruits the decapping complex
  DPC2-DCP1a through PNRC2 and the deadenylation complex CCR4-NOT through CNOT8. SRSF1
  and SMG5-SMG7 independently recruit PP2A, which dephosphorylates UPF1. NMD-targeted
  mRNAs are further degraded by 5′-to-3′ and 3′-to-5′ exonucleolytic activities of
  XRN1 and the exosome, respectively. (E) Model of the ER-NMD pathway. The NMD model
