caption: '(A) Types and effect of radiation according to linear energy transfer (LET):
  Low-LET radiation produces sparse ionization along its track, homogeneously within
  a cell. High-LET radiation causes dense ionization along its track. Mixed beam—
  both effects observed within a single cell (, , , ). (B) Radiation-induced DNA damage:
  DSBs induced by low-LET radiation are repaired by non-homologous end-joining pathway
  (NHEJ) alone or NHEJ and homologous recombination (HR). Mechanisms of repair of
  complex DSBs induced by high-LET radiation are not fully determined (). Created
