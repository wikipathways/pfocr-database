caption: 'The Hippo signalling pathway: key components and regulatory mechanisms.
  The Hippo pathway is highly conserved in Drosophila and in mammals, for example,
  mammalian sterile‐20‐like kinase (Mst) is the orthologue of Hippo, as listed in
  the diagram for comparison (right). The effector of the Hippo pathway is yes‐activated
  protein (YAP) and its paralogue transcriptional coactivator with PDZ‐binding motif
  (TAZ). As transcription co‐activator or co‐repressor, nuclear YAP/TAZ interacts
  with numerous transcriptional and epigenetic factors (indicated as “×”) controlling
  expression of target genes to promote cell proliferation and survival. A number
  of factors have been shown to regulate Mst1/Lats (large tumour suppressor homologue)
  kinase cascade through complex signalling mechanisms currently only partially understood
  (left, ➜, activation; ⊣ inhibition). Mst1/2 and Lats1/2 mediates YAP/TAZ phosphorylation/inactivation.
  This leads to cytoplasm retention of YAP/TAZ after binding with 14‐3‐3 or proteosomic
  degradation. ECM: extracellular matrix; MOB1/2: Mps one binder kinase activator
  like 1/2; mTORC: mammalian target of rapamycin complex; NF2: neurofibromin 2 (also
  known as merlin); PCMT1: protein‐L‐isoaspartate(D‐aspartate) O‐methyltransferase;
  PHLPP: PH domain and leucine rich repeat protein phosphatase; RAP2: Ras‐related
  GTPase; RASSF: Ras association domain‐containing proteins; RhoA: a small GTPase;
