caption: Characterization of tumor cells regulated by FGL1. FGL1, which is expressed
  in tumor cells, regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, EMT, drug resistance and
  radiation sensitivity. FGL1 regulates downstream signaling pathways related to cell
  proliferation by modulating the AKT-mTOR pathway. FGL1 mediates EMT by regulating
  epithelial markers (E-cadherin and ZO-1) and mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin,
  Snail, Twist, MMP12 and fibronectin). In addition, FGL1 mediates PARP1-caspase apoptotic
  pathways by affecting EGFR phosphorylation. Radiation sensitivity may be pertinent
  to TGFβ signaling. The processes of EMT and tumor cell apoptosis are closely related
  to drug resistance
