caption: Lignin biosynthetic pathway, simplified schematic. Not all of the pathways
  or enzymes are necessarily known or distinct. CAD is a generic term (cinnamyl-alcohol
  dehydrogenase) for the enzyme class that catalyzes the final reduction to hydroxycinnamyl
  alcohols—CAD′ may or may not be different from CAD and CAD". Similarly for CCR (cinnamoyl-CoA
  reductase).
