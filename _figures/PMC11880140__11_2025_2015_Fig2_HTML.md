caption: Schematic diagram of the roles of five types of decidual innate immune cells
  in the regulation of labor initiation and PTB. a Decidual neutrophils release inflammatory
  mediators and MMPs that degrade the extracellular matrices of the fetal membrane,
  thereby promoting fetal delivery [37, 38]. Higher TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression on
  the surface of maternal neutrophils is associated with sPTB through triggering an
  inflammatory response [21]. In addition, neutrophils play a central role in cervical
  maturation [39]. b Compared with the TL group, the PTL group presented a reduced
  number of M2 macrophages and increased TNF-α expression in proinflammatory M1 macrophages
  in the decidua [40]. In a mouse model of sPTB, decidual macrophages were found to
  be polarized to the M1 subtype through activation of the Notch signaling pathway
  [41]. c In the third trimester of pregnancy, mast cells can secrete histamine and
  serotonin through degranulation to regulate myometrium contraction, alter microvasculature,
  triggers type I hypersensitivity reactions and degrade proteins [42]. MCAS is a
  chronic multisystem disease that mediates abnormal accumulation of mast cells and
  abnormal secretion of mediators [43]. d In human, the abundance of CD56dimCD16+ dNK
  cells increased during the third trimester, whereas the abundance of CD56brightCD16−
  dNK cells did not change significantly [44]. In mouse models, the TNFα-IL-10 axis
  of uterine NK cells plays an important role in the occurrence of sPTB [45]. e DEC-205+ DCs
  can activate iNKT cells. DCs regulate the Th1/Th2 balance to maintain Th2 polarization,
  with an increase in the production of IL10. Uterine DC activation was found in T
  and B cell-deficient (Rag1−/−) mice given LPS injections to trigger PTB. MCAS, mast
  cell activation syndrome
