caption: (A) The MAPK/ERK pathway activation by growth factors and receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs). RTKs signal through GRB2-Sos and Ras to activate Raf-MEK-ERK signaling
  cascade. Active ERK phosphorylates numerous substrates, both nuclear and cytoplasmic,
  to affect gene transcription, protein translation, cell growth, proliferation, and
  survival. Both RTKs and Ras also activate PI3K-AKT pathway that affect cell survival
  and growth. Conventional PAKs (PAK1-3) phosphorylate c-Raf and contribute to its
  activation. (B) eIF3 subunits forming the PCI/MPN octamer are indicated by the grey
  background. The rectangle marks the seven α-helices involved in formation of the
  7-helix bundle. The Yeast-Like Core (YLC) comprising the eIF3 subunits a, b, g,
  and i is depicted, and so is the eIF3-associated factor eIF3j. Arrows indicate subunits
  targeted by siRNA and subjected to Ribo-Seq in this study; eIF3 subcomplexes generated
  in individual knock-downs are boxed (adapted from Figure 6 of Wagner et al., 2016).
