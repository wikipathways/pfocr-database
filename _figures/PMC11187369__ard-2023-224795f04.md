caption: 'Druggable toll-like receptor (TLR) cascades. Drug–pathway interactions within
  TLR cascades associated with definitions of remission in systemic lupus erythematosus
  (DORIS) remission (from: https://idg.reactome.org, with modifications); only selected
  parts of pathways are shown, and irrelevant pathways or parts of pathways are omitted.
  The complete pathways are detailed in online supplemental figure S2. Panel A depicts
  TLR 7/8 and TLR9 pathways; pathway–drug interactions with TLR7 and TLR9 are highlighted
  with red squares (the number of related drugs is indicated) and demonstrated in
  panels B and C. Parts of the MyD88:MAL(TIRAP) cascade initiated on the plasma membrane
  belonging to the druggable TLR cascades are detailed in panel D; this cascade constitutes
  the terminal effector of TLR2, TLR5, and TLR10 pathways. Within this pathway, Bruton
  tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key druggable component, whose inhibitors are shown in
  panel E'
