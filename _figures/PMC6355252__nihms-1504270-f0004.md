caption: As shown in the top part of the figure, RAGE is a pattern recognition receptor
  that participates in primary immunity and has a variety of ligands. Important for
  our topic are the AGE, AGE-proteins, AGE-peptides and adducts from primary AGE catabolism
  and dietary AGEs. RAGE activation leads to a signaling cascade that produces NF-kB
  coordinated inflammatory responses that can lead to target tissue injury. Soluble
  forms of the receptor (esRAGE and sRAGE) are released to the circulation. Some authors
  suggest they serve to modulate the response acting as decoy ligands. They are useful
  as biomarkers of the whole-body AGE-RAGE axis.
