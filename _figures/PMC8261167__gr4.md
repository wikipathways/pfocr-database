caption: The effect of ferroptosis in the tumor microenvironmentFirst, lactate in
  the tumor microenvironment activates HCAR1 receptors on the cytoplasmic membrane
  of cells and facilitates the MCT1-mediated uptake of lactate to further deactivate
  AMPK and downregulate the expression of SREBP1 and its target SCD1, thus inhibiting
  lipid peroxidation. Second, active CD8+ T cells release IFNγ to inhibit SLC7A11
  expression by activating the STAT1 pathway in cancer cells, thereby inducing tumor
  cell ferroptosis. Third, ferroptotic cell death releases DAMPs (e.g., HMGB1) or
  lipid oxidation products (e.g., 4HNE) from immune cells via different intracellular
  signal transduction pathways.
