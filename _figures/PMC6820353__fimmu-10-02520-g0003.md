caption: miRNA-mediated control of Treg-cell development. Thymic-derived Treg-cell
  development begins at the CD4 SP stage of development and proceeds via one of two
  different pathways. The first Treg precursors to arise are the CD25+ population.
  CD25+ precursors require strong TCR signals and IL-2 signaling to mature into CD25+Foxp3+
  Tregs. The alternative pathway of Treg-cell development is characterized by the
  generation of Foxp3+ precursors. Foxp3+ precursors develop from comparably weaker
  TCR signals to CD25+ precursors and share little TCR repertoire overlap. As they
  mature into Tregs they upregulate CD25 and require both IL-4 and IL-15 signaling.
  Mature Tregs emigrate from the thymus to join the peripheral T cell pool. Total
  (Dicer/Drosha) and individual miRNAs acting on distinct developmental transitions
  are indicated. Single positive (SP) and T cell receptor (TCR).
