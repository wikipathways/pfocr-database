caption: Modulatory Roles of the mPFC-Amygdala Pathways in Fear Extinction After fear
  extinction, excitatory synaptic efficacy in the mPFC projections to principal neurons
  in the BLA (BLA/PN) decreases (1), resulting in a reduced balance between excitation
  and inhibition in this pathway. Projections from the mPFC also activate local GABAergic
  interneurons (BLA/IN, 2), which, in turn, induce heterosynaptic inhibition of the
  AC-BLA pathway, an auditory CS input. Synaptic efficacy in direct mPFC inputs to
  intercalated neurons remains unchanged following extinction training (3). Therefore,
  increased activity of the mPFC during recall of extinction memory (; ) would induce
  more efficient heterosynaptic inhibition in the AC-BLA pathway and more frequent
  activation of ITC neurons, resulting in robust inhibitory responses in the CeA (specifically,
  CeM), the output nucleus of the amygdala. Through these mechanisms, the mPFC could
  attenuate the spiking output of the amygdala during the CS presentation, thus suppressing
  the conditioned fear response after fear extinction.
