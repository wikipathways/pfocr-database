caption: 'Engineered lutein synthesis pathway in Synechocystis. (A) Endogenous carotenoid
  and engineered lutein synthesis pathways in Synechocystis. Two plant lycopene cyclases
  (AtLCYe and AtLCYb) and two hydroxylases (AtCYP97A and AtCYP97C) create a novel
  synthesis pathway that diverges from the CruA/CruP branch and converts lycopene
  to lutein. The endogenous Synechocystis and introduced Arabidopsis enzymes necessary
  for lutein production are marked in blue and green, respectively. Abbreviations:
  IPP: isopentenyl diphosphate, DMAPP: dimethylallyl diphosphate, GGPP: geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate, CrtE: geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, CtrB: phytoene synthase,
  CrtP: phytoene desaturase, CtrQ: zeta carotene desaturase, Z-ISO: 15-cis-ζ-carotene
  isomerase, CrtISO: cis-to-trans carotenoid isomerase, light: photoisomerization,
  CruA/CruP: CruA/CruP-type of lycopene cyclases (CruA: β-cyclase activity, CruP:
  not proven β-cyclase activity), CrtO: β-carotene ketolase, and CrtR: β-carotene
  hydroxylase. A more detailed overview of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in
  cyanobacteria is given elsewhere (; ). (B) Schematic representation of the four-gene
  pKS-LUT construct used for lutein synthesis in Synechocystis. The construct is designed
  to integrate into a neutral site (slr0168) in the Synechocystis genome, via double
  homologous recombination mediated by the two flanking sequences HR1 and HR2. AtLCYe:
  ε-cyclase, AtLCYb: β-cyclase, AtCYP97A: β-hydroxylase, and AtCYP97C: ε-hydroxylase.
  Each Arabidopsis gene is under the control of either the Pro1 (psbA2, slr1311 derived)
  or the Pro2 (rbcL, slr0009 derived) promoter. After each open reading frame a specific
  terminator was set. Ter1 and Ter2 (slr0012 derived), Ter3 (sll1389 derived) and
  Ter4 (slr1311 derived). See the NCBI BioProject: PRJNA731655. The pKS-LUT vector
  includes a double selection cassette that confers kanamycin resistance (nptI) and
  sucrose sensitivity (sacB).'
