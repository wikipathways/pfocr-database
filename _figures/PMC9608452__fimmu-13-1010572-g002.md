caption: 'The intestinal microbiome and its metabolites may contribute to AS pathogenesis.
  (A) The interaction of gut microbiota and HLA-B27 may increase the risk of AS through
  two mechanisms. Firstly, HLA-B27 provides specific peptides, such as certain bacterial
  antigenic components (e.g.polypeptide structures of Klebsiella and Shigella), to
  APCs (e.g., CD8+ T or DC cells), resulting in cross-react on molecularly similar
  self-peptides. Secondly, misfolding of HLA-B27 within ER leads to ER stress, which
  triggers the UPR or autophagy, activating IL-23/IL-17 axis in the bowel and joints
  and simultaneously activating B cells to secrete IgA. However, the role of UPR in
  HLA-B27-driven inflammation has not been demonstrated in humans. (B) Dysbiosis leads
  to increased permeability between IECs, associated with reductions in cathelicidins
  and mucins, disruption of TJ proteins, impairment of GVBs, etc. Bacteria and bacterial
  products subsequently enter the bloodstream, inducing inflammation of the colonized
  tissue. However, it is uncertain whether there is bacterial translocation in AS
  patients. (C) Many immune cells (e.g., Th17, Treg, ILC3, MAIT, γδ T, NKT, LTi-like
  cells, DCs, macrophage et al.) reside in the intestinal mucosa. Dysbiosis triggers
  these cells to increase pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-17, IL-23, TNF-α,
  IFN-γ, IL-7, IL-22, et al.) and decrease anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10).
  This activates the IL-23/IL-17 pathway and increases the Th17/Treg ratio, ultimately
  triggering or exacerbating inflammation in the gut and joints. AS: ankylosing spondylitis;
  HLA-B27: human leukocyte antigen B27; APCs: antigen-presenting cells; DC: dendritic
  cell; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; UPR: unfolded protein response; IECs: intestinal
  epithelial cells; TJ: tight junction; GVB: gut vascular barrier; Th17: T helper
  17 cells; Treg: T regulatory cell; ILC3: innate lymphoid cell 3; MAIT: mucosal-associated
  invariant T cell; NKT: natural killer T cell; IL-17: interleukin 17; TNF-α: tumor
  necrosis factor-α; IFN-γ: interferon-γ; SCFAs: short chain fatty acids; Trp: tryptophan.'
