caption: The main molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor effects of C. sativa
  phytocannabinoids on glioma cells and glioblastoma stem cells. Phytocannabinoids
  inhibit cell viability and motility through various cannabinoid receptor (CB)-mediated
  mechanisms. THC acts as an agonist of both CB1 and CB2 receptors; CBD may act as
  a CB1 antagonist. The activation of CB1 or CB2 stimulates the synthesis and accumulation
  of ceramides (orange shape) and, as a result, triggers the induction of p8. This
  leads to the inhibition of cell migration and invasion through the downregulation
  of MMPs. Furthermore, p8 promotes the upregulation of ER-stress-related genes ATF-4,
  CHOP, and TRIB-3, followed by inhibition of the Akt-mTORC1 axis and initiation of
  autophagy, which is upstream of apoptosis. In addition, inhibition of Akt leads
  to the overexpression of BAD and consequently induces apoptosis via the intrinsic
  mitochondrial pathway. Another signaling pathway activated by ceramides is p38-MAPK,
  which involves both apoptosis activation and inhibition of CSC self-renewal through
  the downregulation of stemness regulators, such as p-STAT3, Id1, and Sox2 (yellow
  shapes). Green arrows represent upregulation and red arrows represent downregulation
  of biological processes. Purple shapes represent genes or proteins, and blue shapes
  represent biological processes.
