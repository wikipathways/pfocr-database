caption: Growth status of tea plants under drought stress with and without the exogenous
  application of tea polyphenols. The proposed model illustrates the role of CsMYB77
  in directly targeting CsPOD44 to enhance drought tolerance in tea plants. Tea polyphenols,
  secondary metabolites in the flavonoid pathway, can activate the phenylpropanoid
  biosynthetic signaling pathway, thereby increasing peroxidase (POD) activity within
  this pathway. This elevation in POD activity facilitates the scavenging of excessive
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately improving drought tolerance in tea plant
  roots. Additionally, this process may promote the accumulation of downstream phenylpropanoid
  products, contributing to ROS elimination. Further experimental verification is
  required to confirm this mechanism
