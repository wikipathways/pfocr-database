caption: (A)—Distribution of fluxes at a lower thiamin level, when it mainly acts
  as the coenzyme of ThDP-dependent enzymes (Kd ∼ 10−6–10−7 M). (B)—Metabolic switch
  to increased flux through the TCA cycle in the presence of an excess of thiamin
  and derivatives exerting a non-coenzyme action (Kd ∼ 10−5 M). Stimulation and inhibition
  of the enzymes by thiamin and/or derivatives are shown by plus and minus annotations
  near the corresponding reactions. Effects on MDH 1 and MDH2 refer to low saturation
  of the enzymes with oxaloacetate. Effects on GDH depend on saturation with substrates
  and the present thiamin derivative, as shown in  and described in the text.
