caption: The cAMP/PKA pathway in C. neoformans contains core components including
  a G-protein coupled receptor Gpr4 [activated by methionine (Met)], a Gα protein
  Gpa1, a Gβ-like/RACK1 homolog Gib2, Gγ proteins Gpg1 and Gpg2, an RGS protein Crg2
  and a GEF Ric8. These proteins along with CO2/HCO3- regulated by the carbonic anhydrase
  Can2 influence the activity of adenylyl cyclase Cac1 and the production of cAMP.
  Gib2 potentially promotes cAMP levels through the inhibition of Ras1 functions on
  Cac1. Unknown GPCRs and the tetraspanin protein Tsp2 sense external glucose and
  may participate in cAMP/PKA activation. The level of cAMP influences the dissociation
  of the catalytic (Pka1 and Pka2) and regulatory (Pkr1) subunits of PKA leading to
  activation of the kinase and downstream signaling. The phosphodiesterase Pde1 influences
  intracellular cAMP levels.
