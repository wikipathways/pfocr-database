caption: MiR-100 is highly -expressed in TAMs and overexpression of miR-100 can promote
  TAMs phenotype by regulating mTOR signaling pathway and upregulate IL-1ra secretion
  via Stat5a transcriptional regulation, which could enhance the stemness and migration
  property of 4T1 tumor cells through activating Hedgehog signaling pathway. Inhibition
  of miR-100 could significantly decrease lung metastasis in mouse breast cancer
