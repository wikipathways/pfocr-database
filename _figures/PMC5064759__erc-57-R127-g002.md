caption: Role of the CaSR, Gα11 and AP2 complex in the regulation of PTH secretion
  and renal tubular calcium reabsorption. The binding of calcium (red filled-in circle,
  Ca) to the extracellular bilobed venus fly trap (VFT) domain of the CaSR (grey)
  results in Gα11 (yellow)-dependent stimulation of phospholipase C-β (PLCβ) (dark
  blue) activity, which catalyses the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). An accumulation
  of IP3 mediates the rapid release of calcium into the cytosol from intracellular
  stores, whereas DAG activates the MAPK cascade. These intracellular signalling events
  lead to a decrease in PTH secretion from the parathyroid chief cell and reduction
  in renal tubular calcium reabsorption. CaSR cellsurface expression is regulated
  by agonist-driven insertional signalling (ADIS) (not shown) () and also by an endocytic
  complex comprising clathrin, β-arrestin (green) and the AP2 complex (orange), which
  traffic this GPCR to the endosomal-lysosomal degradation pathway (light blue) or
  recycle the CaSR back to the cell surface (). Loss- and gain-of-function mutations
  of the CaSR lead to FHH1 and ADH1, respectively, whereas loss- and gain-of function
  mutations of the Gα11-subunit are associated with FHH2 and ADH2, respectively. Loss-offunction
  mutations of the AP2σ-subunit lead to FHH3.
