caption: A schematic model for IL-6-stimulated Cyr61 expression and its role in FLS
  migration and invasion. IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor complex stimulate Cyr61 expression
  via the ERK/ EGR3 signalling pathway. Secreted Cyr61 protein activates FLSs in an
  autocrine or paracrine manner and the resulting increase in extracellular Cyr61
  protein enhances FLS migration and invasion. IL-6, interleukin-6; FLS, fibroblast-like
  synoviocyte; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; EGR3, early growth response
