caption: 'Model for bivalent gene regulation in ESCs: Bivalent, lineage-specific developmental
  regulatory genes remain silent in ESCs due to the presence of multiple, redundantly
  functioning repressive complexes, which likely collaborate to maintain a repressive
  environment to prevent gene activation. However, the coexistence of positive regulatory
  features at these genes allows for rapid activation during differentiation when
  appropriate signals for specific bivalent genes appear. This is facilitated by rapid
  exit of the repressive complexes from bivalent genes undergoing activation (A).
  The bivalent features remain associated with the gene when ESCs are induced to differentiate
  along a different pathway, and the gene remains inactive under these circumstances,
  which argues that the spurious activation of poised genes is prevented due to the
  presence of bivalent features which continue to allow the gene to remain in the
  poised state while preventing its inappropriate activation (B). Finally, crucial
  lineage-specific developmental regulators are kept under tight control via the existence
  of multiple layers of redundantly functioning mechanisms, and, in this way, loss
  of a single repressive complex is insufficient to allow gene activation due to the
  presence of other repressive mechanisms (C).'
