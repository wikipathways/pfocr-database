caption: 'Abnormally glycosylated MPL and mutant CALR C-domain could be used as a
  neoantigen targeted by T-cell Receptor Therapy (TCR). Due to aberrant CALR functions,
  CALR-mutated cells have been shown to be sensitive to BFA: Brefeldin A or other
  glycosylation inhibitors. Similarly, inhibitors targeting the JAK/STAT signaling
  (JAKi: JAK1/2 inhibitors, Erki: ERK inhibitors, MAPKi: MAPK inhibitors) pathway
  have been shown to efficiently target CALR-mutated cells. CALR instability could
  also be used to define specific and innovative therapeutic strategies for MPN patients
  harboring CALR mutations.'
