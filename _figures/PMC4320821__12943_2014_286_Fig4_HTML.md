caption: 'Network graph showing interactions between ID2 and ID3 and their MIC-inferred
  ‘target’ genes regulating cell death. MIC-inferred apoptosis target genes, denoted
  by green nodes connected to ID2/ID3 by blue edges, were compiled from apoptosis
  pathway target genes in Additional file : Table S4. Green edges define protein-protein
  interactions, curated from the String database []. Pink edges denote literature-validated
  regulatory interactions mined from the UniHI database [] that have been expanded
  to include first-neighbour interactions with additional targets as either pink nodes
  (not MIC-inferred target genes) or as grey (ID3) or white (ID2) MIC-inferred target
  genes listed in Additional file : Table S3. A Cytoscape network graph circle layout
  is shown.'
