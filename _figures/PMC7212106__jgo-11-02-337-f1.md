caption: 'Hand-drawn picture of interactions among PD-L1, Met, and IL-10. (A) Met
  protein structure diagram: Met is formed by extracellular alpha chain, transmembrane
  beta chain via disulfide bond heterologous body. The Met receptor includes three
  functionally distinct domains. That is, the extracellular region, the transmembrane
  region, and the intracellular region. The intracellular zone includes 3 more functions:
  intracellular proximal membrane junction domain, a tyrosine kinase catalytic structure
  with tyrosine kinase activity domain, a C-terminal domain that interacts with a
  variety of downstream signaling molecules. (B) Dynamic interactions among PD-L1,
  Met, and IL-10. Over-expression of PD-L1 upregulates IL-10 expression in esophageal
  carcinoma and cells by positive feedback regulation. IL-10 down-regulates the expression
  level of PD-L1 in esophageal carcinoma by negative feedback regulation. (C) IL-10
  acts on the HGF (hepatocyte growth factor)/Met signaling pathway, thereby affecting
  its downstream akt, MAPK signaling pathway, and then down-regulating PD-L1 expression.'
