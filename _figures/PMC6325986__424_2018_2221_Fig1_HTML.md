caption: Potential adaptations in intestinal phosphate absorption in response to changes
  in dietary phosphate intake, or treatment with phosphate binders or the NHE3 inhibitor,
  tenapanor. a Ingestion of a normal or high-phosphate diet provides a luminal phosphate
  gradient that favours the paracellular pathway, with NaPi-IIb likely functioning
  at its maximal rate. Renal adaption occurs in response to the high dietary phosphate
  intake in order to maintain phosphate homeostasis [, ]. b In contrast, during ingestion
  of a low-phosphate diet, the luminal phosphate gradient is reduced and the contribution
  of the paracellular pathway diminishes. NaPi-IIb protein levels increase and this
  pathway becomes the dominant route for phosphate absorption []. Studies from NaPi-IIb−/−
  mice suggest that the adaptation in NaPi-IIb is required to protect bone during
  phosphate restriction []. c Phosphate binders reduce the luminal phosphate concentration
  and therefore the gradient for paracellular phosphate absorption. Recent studies
  in NaPi-IIb−/− mice have shown a potential compensatory upregulation in NaPi-IIb
  following sevelamer treatment []. d Tenapanor has been proposed to reduce paracellular
  phosphate absorption via changes in trans-epithelial electrical resistance. Interestingly,
  the inhibitor also induces a downregulation in NaPi-IIb protein levels as a means
  of preventing compensation by this pathway []. The basolateral pathway responsible
  for phosphate efflux from the enterocyte is unknown and whether it adapts during
  these conditions requires investigation
