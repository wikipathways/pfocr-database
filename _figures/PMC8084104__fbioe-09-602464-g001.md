caption: Possible fate of linuron and 3,4-DCA in SRS 16. Reactions in black were included
  in the automatic reconstruction. Reactions in red were manually added to the model.
  Pathway 1 (modified ortho-cleavage pathway) was retrieved from BioCyc based on direct
  evidence for Variovorax SRS 16 strain (https://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-7496).
  Pathways 2 and 3 (ortho- and meta-cleavage pathways, respectively) were completed
  by following the generic KEGG pathways.
