caption: '“Working hypothesis” schematic showing the proposed signaling pathways and
  molecules involved in the ischemic tolerance achieved by the different preconditioning
  stimuli tested in this study (green), as well as the pharmacologic manipulations
  used (red) to elucidate this cascade. Both primary and secondary responding cells
  are shown to highlight the potential autocrine and paracrine actions of S1P, FTY720-P,
  and CCL2. Estimated time periods over which the expression of some of the primary
  mediators in the signaling cascade changes are also shown. Evidence for the inclusion
  of each numbered molecule or numbered interaction in this signaling pathway is derived
  from the present study, or others, as follows: [1] Extensive literature supports
  an increase in HIF expression in response to hypoxia or CoCl2 treatment (, , , ,
  , , ). [2]  showed that HPC leads to a microvascular SphK2 increase 2–4 h later,
  and that inhibition of this increased activity blocks HPC-induced protection. [3]
  HPC-, CoCl2-, and FTY720-induced protection is blocked in SphK2-null mice (). [4]
  Inhibition of SphK2 activity blocks preconditioning ( and ), so presumably S1P or
  FTY720-P formation is required for this process. The timing of increased microvascular
  SphK2 activity shown in  suggests S1P increases around 4 h after HPC. [5] FTY720
  preconditioning is blocked by HIF inhibition (), indicating it acts on HIF either
  via an autocrine feedback loop, or [6] via paracrine signaling on another cell.
  [7] Competitive antagonism of S1P1 with W146 blocked preconditioning-based protection
  by HPC, CoCl2, and FTY720 (). [8] Increased CCL2 expression following HPC or FTY720
  treatment did not occur when the S1P1 receptor was antagonized with W146 (). [9]
  CCL2-null mice exhibited larger baseline infarcts than naïve mice following tMCAO
  ().  showed increases in CCL2 expression 12–24 h following HPC, primarily in neurons.
  [10] CCR2 is the predominant receptor for CCL2, so the involvement of this receptor
  in CCL2-mediated preconditioning is presumed. However, paradoxically, CCR2-null
  mice have reduced baseline infarcts relative to naïve mice (); this latter effect
  may be due to the activity of a different CCR2 ligand, or maybe CCL2-mediated protection
  functions via a receptor other than CCR2. [11] Synthesis of new proteins secondary
  to changes in gene expression is known to be required for establishing the preconditioning-induced,
