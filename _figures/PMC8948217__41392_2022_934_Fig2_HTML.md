caption: Overview of the NOTCH signaling pathway and therapeutic targets. In signal-receiving
  cells, NOTCH receptors are first generated in the ER and then trafficked to the
  Golgi apparatus. During trafficking, NOTCH receptors are glycosylated at the EGF-like
  repeat domain (red curves). Then, in the Golgi apparatus, NOTCH receptors are cleaved
  into heterodimers (S1 cleavage) and transported to the cell membrane. With the help
  of ubiquitin ligases, some of the NOTCH receptors on the cell membrane are endocytosed
  into endosomes. Endosomes contain an acidic environment with ADAMs and γ-secretase.
  The NOTCH receptors in endosomes can be recycled to the cell membrane, cleaved into
  NICD, or transported into lysosomes for degradation. In signal-sending cells, NOTCH
  ligands are distributed on the cell membrane and can bind to NOTCH receptors on
  signal-receiving cells. However, the ligands are inactive before ubiquitylation
  by Neur or Mib. After ubiquitylation, ligands can be endocytosed, thus producing
  a pulling force for the binding receptors. Without the pulling force, the S2 site
  (red marks) of NOTCH receptors is hidden by the NRR domain, and thus, the NOTCH
  receptors are resistant to cleavage by ADAMs. With the pulling force, the NRR domain
  is extended, therefore exposing the S2 site for cleavage. ADAMs and the pulling
  force are both necessary for S2 cleavage. After S2 cleavage, the remaining part
  of the NOTCH receptor is called NEXT. NEXT can be further cleaved on the cell membrane
  by γ-secretase or endocytosed into endosomes. In the former mode, NICD is released
  on the cell membrane. In the latter mode, NEXT can be cleaved into NICD or transported
  into lysosomes for degradation. In total, there are three approaches to generate
  NICD, classified as ligand-independent activation, ligand-dependent endocytosis-independent
  activation, and ligand-dependent endocytic activation. NICD can be translocated
  into the nucleus or remain in the cytoplasm to crosstalk with other signaling pathways,
  such as NFκB, mTORC2, AKT, and Wnt. The classical model proposes that, in the absence
  of NICD, CSL binds with corepressors to inhibit the transcription of target genes.
  Once NICD enters the nucleus, it can bind with CSL and recruit MAMLs, releasing
  corepressors, recruiting coactivators, and thus promoting the transcription of NOTCH
  target genes. There are two main approaches to inhibit NOTCH signaling for therapy.
  One is designing inhibitors of the key components of the pathways, including the
  enzymes that participate in S1 cleavage, ADAMs, γ-secretase, and MAML. The other
  one is producing antibody-drug conjugates against NOTCH receptors and ligands. The
  protein structures of NOTCH ligands and receptors are shown in the top left corner.
