caption: In response to increased in unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, three sensors
  located in the ER membrane, PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 activate the unfolded protein response.
  Under homeostatic conditions, PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 are bound by BiP, which suppresses
  their activity. In response to ER stress, BiP is recruited away from PERK, IRE1
  and ATF6 to promote protein folding, which leads to activation of these ER stress
  sensors. PERK is a kinase, that auto-activates, dimerizes and phosphorylates its
  target eIF2, thereby preventing assembly of functional 80S ribosomes. Further, eIF2
  directs selective translation of the transcription factor ATF4, which activates
  transcription of genes involved in the unfolded protein response. IRE1 is a bifunctional
  enzyme with kinase and endonuclease activity. In response to ER stress, IRE1 auto-phosphorylates
  via its kinase domain, which leads to dimerization and activation of its endonuclease
  activity. The endonuclease function of IRE1 degrades mRNA at the ER to decrease
  protein biosynthesis and also splices the transcript encoding XBP1, a second transcription
  factor directing expression of genes involved in restoring cellular homeostasis.
  ATF6 is a transcription factor that is anchored in the ER membrane, but in response
  to ER stress, it translocates to the Golgi, where the transcription factor domain
  is released from the membrane by sequential action of Site 1 (S1) and Site 2 (S2)
  proteases, allowing its translocation to the nuclease to activate transcription
  of UPR target genes. ATF4, XBP1 and ATF6 direct a transcriptional program that upregulates
  chaperones, components of the ERAD pathway, and factors involved in autophagy and
  apoptosis that act to restore cellular homeostasis or if the disruption to ER function
  cannot be resolved, initiate programmed cell death.
