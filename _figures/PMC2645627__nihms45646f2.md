caption: 'Interleukin (IL)-6-signaling pathways with potential drug targets. Two different
  pathways: phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), phosphorylation and dimerization
  of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) with successive translocation
  of STAT3 to the nucleus, and transactivation of target genes (STATs remain in the
  cytoplasm until they are activated by JAK); activation of the Ras-Raf pathway, which
  regulates phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), whose substrate
  is nuclear factor IL-6 (NF-IL-6). Note that two different IL-6-responsive elements
  exist in the promoter region of the acute-phase protein genes targeted by NF-IL-6
  and STAT3 (–). The numbers in red indicate the potential drug targets and are discussed
  in the text.'
