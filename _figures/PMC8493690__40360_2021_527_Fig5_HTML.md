caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed mechanism behind mitigation of sunitinib-induced
  disruption of sarcomere by inhibition of the Hippo pathway (A) Stimulation with
  sunitinib causes reduction of nuclear localization of YAP1 as well as disruption
  of sarcomere in iPSC-CM probably through activation of the Hippo pathway. (B) Washout
  of sunitinib normalizes the activated status of the Hippo pathway and the extent
  of nuclear localization of YAP1 as well as sarcomere disruption returns to normal
  level possibly as a result of sarcomere synthesis. (C) XMU-MP-1 is considered to
  mimic the condition of sunitinib washout as it is an inhibitor of kinase MST1/2.
  Indeed, XMU-MP-1 suppressed the sunitinib-induced disruption of sarcomere
