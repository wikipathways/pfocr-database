caption: TF–FVIIa–driven PAR2 activation triggers EV generation from human TNBC cells,
  which promotes EMT in non–metastatic breast cancer cells, leading to the induction
  of proliferation, migration, invasion, and anti–apoptosis. TF–FVIIa–mediated cleavage
  of PAR2 in human TNBC cells leads to the intracellular activation of AKT, ROCK,
  and ERK1/2 pathways independently, which promotes the release of EVs packaged with
  miR–221 via actomyosin reorganization. TNBC–EVs are taken up by non–metastatic breast
  cancer cells, thereby delivering miR–221 into the recipient cells. In recipient
  cells, miR–221 targets PTEN, leading to the activation of AKT/p65–signaling pathway
  in which the activated (via phosphorylation) p65 enters the nucleus to stimulate
  the upregulation of N–cadherin and vimentin while downregulating the expression
  of E–cadherin. As a result of this, EMT is induced, which ultimately leads to the
  promotion of proliferation, migration, invasion, and anti–apoptosis of EV–fused
  recipient cells. Red arrows indicate decreased and green arrow indicate increased
  levels.
