caption: Possible insights on MeCP2 epigenetic regulation in bone-related pathways.
  During the canonical WNT signaling pathway, WNT ligands interact with FZD receptors
  and LRP co-receptors, activating the canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling cascade and
  leading to the transcription of WNT-responsive genes and to bone formation. SFRP4,
  an inhibitor of the WNT/β-catenin cascade, is epigenetically repressed by MeCP2.
  Thus, loss of MeCP2 or the presence of 8-OHdG-mutated nucleotide in CpG islands
  adjacent to the SFRP4 promoter region may induce an epigenetic de-repression of
  the SFRP4 gene, with consequent impairment of WNT signaling and reduction in bone
  formation (a). MeCP2 loss is even involved in gene downregulation of Runx2 (an essential
  factor for osteoblast differentiation and a direct target of canonical WNT pathway)
  and Opg (an important element in bone metabolism) (b). Decreased levels of MeCP2
  SUMOylation, an important post-translational modification, are related to reduced
  Wnt6 mRNA levels (c). Then, an altered methylation status of CpG island (indicated
  with red flag) in the promoter region of Opg and Rankl genes has been shown to be
  implicated in osteoporosis pathogenesis (d). MeCP2 mut, mutated methyl-CpG binding
  protein 2; MeCP2 WT, wild-type methyl-CpG binding protein 2; FZD, family of frizzled
  receptors; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins; SFRP, secreted
