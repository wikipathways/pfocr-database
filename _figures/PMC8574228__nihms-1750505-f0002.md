caption: In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, endothelial
  cells produce factors that induce inflammation and recruit monocytes for transendothelial
  migration. These factors include interleukins (IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8), colony-stimulating
  factors (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and
  chemotactic factors (C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2)). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such
  as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1 and IL-6 are involved in the initiation and
  propagation of inflammatory signals. This inflammatory signalling stimulates monocytes
  and endothelial cells to initiate weak interactions and the subsequent rolling of
  the monocytes over the endothelial cells, mediated by adhesion molecules (such as
  vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM1) and E-selectin). Finally, monocytes migrate
  through the intercellular clefts between the endothelial cells to the underlying
  tissue. Macrophage-derived mediators and pro-inflammatory cytokines drive the transformation
  of quiescent fibroblasts into proliferative and matrix-synthesizing active myofibroblasts.
  The communication between inflammatory cells and resident fibroblasts occurs through
  direct cell–cell interactions and through paracrine signalling. Sustained activation
  of myofibroblasts produces structural extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and matricellular
  proteins. Crosslinking of collagen molecules by matrix-crosslinking enzymes, such
  as lysyl oxidase (LOX), prevents the enzymatic degradation of collagen, leading
  to an increase in collagen content and stiffness. The dynamic alterations in the
  composition of the ECM and the prolonged deposition of ECM modulates cardiac function.
  Both canonical transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)– mothers against decapentaplegic
  homologue 2 (SMAD2)–SMAD3 signalling and non-canonical TGFβ signalling through Rho-associated
  protein kinase (ROCK), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 contribute
  to the development of pathological hypertrophy and fibrosis. Phosphorylation and
  activation of ERK, p38, Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of
  transcription (STAT) by activation of G-protein-coupled receptors also leads to
  the development of fibrosis. Activation of the calcineurin–nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT) pathway by cardiac transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs)
  also has a major role in fibrotic remodelling. Mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs)
  are ligand-activated transcription factors that induce transcription of profibrotic
  genes upon aldosterone binding. AngII, angiotensin II; AT1R, angiotensin II receptor
