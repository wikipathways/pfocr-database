caption: Notch1 signaling is major pathway down regulated by TWEAK in C2C12 myotubes.
  Genes represented in green boxes are those which were found to be significantly
  down-regulated in our microarray experiment. The genes shown without color are intermediate
  to the network and are not found in our microarray data. The solid lines connecting
  molecules here represents a direct relation and dotted lines an indirect relation.
  This network was obtained from IPA using differentially regulated genes by TWEAK
  with p-values ≤0.05 and ≥1.5-fold and was superimposed with the miRNAs (blue colored
  boxes) having their putative targets.
