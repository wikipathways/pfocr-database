caption: Obstructive airway disease medications and their interactions with cAMP signaling
  pathway. Cyclic AMP is a key messenger, with a critical role in airway relaxation,
  synthesized by adenylyl cyclase (AC) that are activated by Gαs and inhibited by
  Gαi. β2AR agonists (SABA and LABA) and muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) contribute
  to increasing cAMP levels. Some Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) isoforms,
  coupled to Gαq activate phospholipase C (PLC), stimulate increases in intracellular
  Ca2+ and promote contraction. Intracellular increase in cAMP activates protein kinase
  A (PKA), exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac), and other effectors. cAMP signaling
  in airway smooth muscle cells ultimately leads to the phosphorylation of a myriad
  of downstream targets by PKA. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) regulates cell contractility
  by phosphorylating myosin light chains, which enables myosin to interact with actin,
  leading to muscle contraction. When MLCK is phosphorylated by PKA, there is a reduction
  in its ability to phosphorylate myosin light chains, thus decreasing muscle contraction.
  Phosphodiesterase isoforms (PDE) hydrolyze cAMP and brings down the intracellular
  cAMP levels. Using PDE inhibitors is a strategy to sustain increased cAMP levels
  to generate beneficial effects as seen in studies with Ensifentrine, a dual PDE3/4
  inhibitor. In addition to the PDE-based reduction of cAMP, there ABCC1 (ATP-binding
  cassette [ABC] subfamily member C 1) membrane transporters that are vital for β-agonists
  evoked cAMP efflux to the extracellular environment. Another mainstay therapy is
  ICS, which acts through the glucocorticoid receptor and produces anti-inflammatory
  responses. Created in BioRender. Sherpa, RT (2025) https://biorender.com/z0tepql
