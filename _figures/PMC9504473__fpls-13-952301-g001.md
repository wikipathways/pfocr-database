caption: Arabidopsis thaliana salicylic acid network map. The salicylic acid defence
  network is initiated with the induction of genes involved in hormone biosynthesis
  (blue boxes). Once salicylic acid has been produced, genes involved in the modification
  of salicylic acid (orange boxes) alter hormone structure. The production of metabolically
  active salicylic acid induces the expression of early (green boxes) and late (purple
  boxes) responsive genes. Regulatory genes (red boxes) modify the activity of genes
  involved at each stage of the signaling cascade. The intracellular location of the
  components of the signaling pathway are indicated by the bold text. Connections
  between genes are indicated by arrows whereby black arrow indicate positive interactions
  (upregulation) and red arrows indicate negative interactions (downregulation). While
  additional members of the pathway are known, only genes mentioned in this review
  are included in the network map.
