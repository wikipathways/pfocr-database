caption: The point of action of the inhibitory activity of the mentioned biologic
  drugs. Dupilumab acts against the alpha subunit of the IL-4 receptor (IL4Rα), blocking
  IL-4 and IL-13 receptors and, therefore, the type-2 inflammation pathway. Mepolizumab
  is an anti-IL-5 antibody and acts by blocking Th2 cytokine expression mediated by
  IL-5 and eosinophils. Tezepelumab binds TSLP, preventing its interaction with the
  receptor complex, and etokimab binds IL-33; therefore, tezepelumab and etokimab
  act upstream of effector Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31. Nemolizumab
  is a humanized monoclonal antibody that acts against the IL-31 receptor, and it
  is essential in mediating itching. Lebrikizumab and tralokinumab are monoclonal
  antibodies that bind soluble IL-13, preventing heterodimerization of IL-13Ra1/IL-4Ra
  and the following signaling, are they are implicated in the Th2 immune response.
  Ligelizumab and omalizumab are monoclonal antibodies that act against IgE. Benralizumab
  is a monoclonal antibody that acts against the IL-5-receptor alpha.
