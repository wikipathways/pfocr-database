caption: '1A: Base excision repair (BER) pathway targets DNA damaged during replication
  or by environmental agents. The single damaged base in DNA caused by endogenous
  metabolism or environmental oxidizing agents result in DNA adducts. Base excision
  repair involves removing the mutated base out of the DNA and repairing the base
  alone. 1B: Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is associated with the repair of bulky
  adducts induced by several suspected environmental prostate cancer carcinogens.
  The NER pathway is a complex biochemical process that requires at least four steps:
  (a) damage recognition by a complex of bound proteins including xeroderma pigmentosum
  complementation group C (XPC), XPA, and replication protein A (RPA); (b) unwinding
  of the DNA by the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex that includes XPD(ERCC2);
  (c) removal of the damaged single-stranded fragment (usually about 27–30 bp) by
  molecules including an ERCC1 and XPF complex and XPG; and (d) synthesis by DNA polymerases.
  1C: Double-strand breaks are produced by replication failure or by DNA damaging
  agents. Two repair pathways exist to repair double strand breaks. The homologous
  recombination repair relies on DNA sequence complementarity between the intact chromatid
  and the damaged chromatid as the bases of stand exchange and repair. 1D: The non-homologous
  end-joining repair pathway requires direct DNA joining of the two double-strand-break
  ends.'
