caption: 'Overview of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Activation (blue arrows) of
  growth factor (GF) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), resulting in autophosphorylation
  on tyrosine residues, recruits Phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) to the cell
  membrane. Direct binding of PI3K to the tyrosine residues causes activation via
  the PI3K catalytic subunit[]. Activated PI3K in turn phosphorylates secondary messenger
  phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-bisphospate (PIP2) which converts to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3). PIP3 is responsible for the recruitment of the protein kinase AKT to the
  cell surface where its subsequent activation/inhibition by multiple molecules leads
  to involvement in numerous downstream signaling pathways[,]. AKT is activated via
  phosphorylation at two key residues: S473 and T308[]. Protein serine/threonine kinase-3’-PDK1
  and PDK2, recruited to and activated at the cell surface are responsible for activating
  AKT, along with protein kinases ATM and ATR, and HSP90. DNA-PK, a nuclear serine/threonine
  kinase essential for non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair, activates AKT via
  phosphorylation at S473 in response to cisplatin-induced DNA damage in platinum
  resistant EOC cells[]. PTEN, tuberous sclerosis protein 1 (TSC1) and TSC2 are the
  main negative regulators (yellow arrows) of the pathway, with phosphorylation of
  TSC2 by AKT releasing the inhibitory effect on mTORC1 via the GTP-binding protein
  Rheb[]. mTORC1 activates p70S6K and inhibits 4E-BP1, resulting in protein synthesis
  and cell growth, and mTORC2 activates AKT itself; overall mTOR activation leads
  to cell growth and survival. Inactivation of pro-apoptotic molecules YAP, Procaspase
  9 (Casp9) and BAD, as well as inhibiting Forkhead transcription factors [e.g., Forkhead
  box protein O1 (FoxO1)] result in increased cell survival[,]. AKT is an essential
  part of the insulin signaling pathway. Activated in response to insulin stimulation,
  AKT causes Glucose Transporter 4 (GLUT4) to translocate to the cell surface, facilitating
  glucose uptake. Additionally, the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta
  (GSK-3β) by AKT increases glycogen production[]. The role of AKT in glucose metabolism
  is again apparent through its inhibition of FoxO1, which suppresses hepatic glucose
  production[]. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway includes points of cross-regulation
  and communication with other common signaling pathways, e.g., JNK and RAS-ERK. The
  AKT substrate c-RAF is activated by RAS and initiates a kinase cascade leading to
  ERK activation[]. The phosphorylation of c-RAF by AKT inhibits its activity and
  subsequent downstream activity in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade known for
  its role in apoptosis and cell differentiation[]. AKT involvement with the JNK pathway,
  a stress- and nutrient-response pathway, directly modifies activation of target
  genes, many of which are involved in adaptations to extra-cellular stresses[].'
