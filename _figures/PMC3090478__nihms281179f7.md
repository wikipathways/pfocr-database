caption: In the NOX-ROS independent pathway (left), TNFα binds to the TNF receptor
  1 (TNF-R1) located on the plasma membrane of target cells, thus activating IκB kinase
  (IKK). Activated IKK phosphorylates IκB, leading to its ubiquitylation and subsequent
  degradation. This releases NFκB and allows its translocation to the nucleus, where
  it binds to DNA promoter regions and induces inflammatory gene transcription. TNFα
  binding to TNF-R1 may also induce phosphorylation of p47phox and activation of Rac1,
  which activates NADPH oxidase, thus increasing intracellular production of ROS and
  enhancing NFκB activation. The results presented in this paper do not support the
  notion that NOX-ROS play a significant role in TNFα-induced NFκB activation in non-lung
  tissues in vivo (arrow marked “?”). In the NOX-ROS dependent pathway (right), TNFα
  binds to TNF-R1 located on the plasma membrane of PMNs, which in turn activates
  NOX2 and produces extracellular ROS. The ROS from PMNs, in particular hydrogen peroxide,
  diffuse into target cells and serve as signaling molecules for NFκB activation,
  thereby enhancing acute inflammation in the lungs of TNFα-exposed mice.
