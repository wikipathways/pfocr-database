caption: (a) Micronucleus model of cGAS-STING activation. Disruption of the micronucleus
  NE causes accumulation and activation of cGAS, which initiates interferon and pro-inflammatory
  responses via cGAMP production and STING activation. (b) Senescence model of cGAS-STING
  activation. Increased NE instability during senescence leads to budding off of nucleus
  material, association of chromatin with autophagosomes, and generation of cytoplasmic
  chromatin fragments that accumulate and activate cGAS, which initiates the senescence-associated
  secretory phenotype via STING. CCF = cytoplasmic chromatin fragments; cGAMP = cyclic
  GMP-AMP; cGAS = cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase; IFN = interferon response; Infl = pro inflammatory
  pathway activation; MN = micronuclei; NE = nuclear envelope; SASP = senescence-associated
  secretory phenotype; STING = stimulator of interferon genes.
