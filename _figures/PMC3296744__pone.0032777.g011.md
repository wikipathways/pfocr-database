caption: '(A) Evolutionary timeline summarizing key events in chordate/vertebrate
  evolution. Key evolutionary events are shown, including the divergence of protostomes
  (solid grey line) from deuterostomes, the subsequent divergence of urochordates
  (broken grey line) from other chordates, and finally ray-finned fish (including
  teleosts) (dotted black line) from lobe-finned fish (including terapods) (black
  line), with relevant present-day groupings (insect, urochordate, teleost, and tetrapod)
  indicated. Whole genome duplications (1R, 2R, 3R) are indicated with short red lines.
  (B–D) Model for the evolution of JAK-STAT pathway components: JAK (B), SHP (C),
  and PIAS (D) families. Red ovals indicate the likely core members at the time of
  protostomes/deuterostomes and urochordate/chordate divergence, while the grey shaded
  rectangle represents ray-finned/lobe-finned fish ‘core’ signaling components present
  at the time of divergence. Lineage-specific/local duplications are indicated by
  red dots and gene conversion indicated by a red square.'
