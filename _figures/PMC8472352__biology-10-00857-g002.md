caption: 'Schematic representation of the Vav2–Rac1-dependent pathway promoting blood
  vessel vasodilatation (red color). The previously known signaling elements of the
  NO signaling route in vSMCs are shown in black. The vasoconstriction pathway is
  shown in brown. Activation steps are indicated by arrows. Inhibitory steps are indicated
  by blunted lines. See further details in main text. Abbreviations used are: sGC,
  soluble guanylate cyclase; cGKI, cGMP–dependent protein kinase type I; GMP, guanosine
  monophosphate; MLCK, MLC20 kinase. The rest of the abbreviations have already been
  described in the main text.'
