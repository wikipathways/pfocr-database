caption: 'Overview of the altered glucose and lactate metabolism identified in myeloma.
  Glucose and lactate metabolism have been targeted in MM at several stages during
  the metabolic process; uptake, enzymatic conversion and export. Glucose transport
  in myeloma was blocked by targeting GLUT transporters (8-aminoadenosine, phloretin,
  STF-31, compound 20, ritonavir and siRNA/shRNA) or limiting the amount of glucose
  present for uptake (deprivation). Apart from the uptake, several glycolytic enzymes
  have also been targeted to reduce glycolytic function by inhibitors (3-bromopyruvate,
  2-DG, 5MPN, PFK158 and JX06, dichloroacetate) and/or shRNAs. Moreover, serine metabolism
  can be inhibited by affecting PHGDH through shRNA, CBR5884 and NCT503. Serine deprivation
  also reduced MM viability. Lactate import through MCT1 was blocked by several metabolic
  inhibitors: AR-C155858, α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid and syrosingopine, while
  lactate production and export has been targeted through shRNA and syrosingopine.
  ACSS2 targeting by shRNA inhibited acetyl-CoA production. Used inhibitors, genetic
  approaches (siRNA/shRNA) and deprivations to affect these metabolic pathways are
  shown in red. Purple arrows indicate increase or decrease in a hypoxic environment.
