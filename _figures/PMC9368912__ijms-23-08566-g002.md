caption: Functional analysis of HPV E6 variants. (a) Gene expression profiles of HPV-16
  and -18 E6 variants expressing cells. HPV-16 E6 E-P regulates the expression of
  266 genes, while the other E6 variants together induced 436 genes, mainly involved
  in cell signaling, transcription, and adhesion. Furthermore, E6 AsAi and Af from
  HPV-18 induce the expression of 1945 genes and 2236 genes, respectively, affecting
  different cellular processes. (b) E6 AA-c increases the expression of MINCR, a competitive
  endogenous RNA of miR-28-5p, preventing the degradation of RAP1B transcript. (c)
  HPV-18 E6 AsAi and E variants exhibit different E6 splicing patterns, being E6 full-length
  the most prevalent isoform, in contrast E6 Af showed a higher proportion of the
  small-spliced isoform E6*I, impacting p53 and p14ARF protein levels. (d) HPV-18
  E6 Af variant induces higher TCF-4 transcriptional activity than E6 AsAi. Both variants
  bind to TCF-4/β-catenin and induce Cyclin D1 and Axin2 expression. (e) HPV-18 E6
  AsAi and E variants promote overactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway compared to E6
  Af, differentially impacting proliferation. When indicated, up arrows mean augmented
  levels, where enlarged arrows refer to higher levels than the short arrows. Down
  arrows indicate decreased levels. Figure created in BioRender.
