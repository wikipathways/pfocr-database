caption: 'Opioid receptors are both pre- and post-synaptic and are coupled to the
  Gi/Go proteins. In contrast to morphine, oxycodone is speculated in this review
  to interact with sodium (Na+) allosteric sites on the mu opioid-receptor (MOR) and
  to act as an “efficacy-switch” in the receptor signal transduction. In acute pain
  conditions, the activation of MOR by either morphine or oxycodone triggers the classical
  intracellular Gi/Go-protein signaling pathway that leads to analgesia (; ; ) and
  the Protein Kinase C (PKC)-mediated signaling pathway that is responsible for the
  receptor desensitization. The classical Go/Gi-protein signaling pathway has already
  been extensively described in the literature: it leads to (1) the inhibition of
  the adenylyl cyclase (AC)/cyclic AMP (cAMP)/ protein kinase A (PKA) or the exchange
  protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) pathways (), (2) the stimulation of G
  protein-couple inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) and (3) the inhibition
  of voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca2+ conductance) causing a decreased neurotransmitter
  release from the pre-synaptic nerve terminal. After receptor activation, there is
  a progressive reduction in signal transduction which corresponds to MOR desensitization
  (). MOR desensitization by morphine and oxycodone is mainly PKC-dependent as it
  minimally engages GRK-ß-arrestin regulation like fentanyl (; ). However, unlike
  morphine, we hypothesize that oxycodone requires other pathways in addition to that
  of PKC to induce MOR desensitization. These potential additional PKC-independent
  pathways need to be determined, although specific signal transduction activated
  by oxycodone has already been demonstrated, such as the Epithelial growth factor
  receptor (EGFR)/ERK/Akt pathway in the context of oxidative stress ().The mechanism
  by which PKC mediates morphine- and oxycodone-promoted MOR desensitization is still
  not clear. Strong evidences suggest that morphine induces MOR desensitization through
  low level of receptor phosphorylation and activation of PKCα, γ and ε to induce
  ERK phosphorylation and tolerance (; ; ). After MOR activation, PKC can be stimulated
  by second messengers such as DAG and calcium made available thanks to PLC activation
  by GBßγ subunit, non-coupled tyrosine kinases, or small G protein (). Many substrates
  of PKC have been proposed including Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1)
  which inhibits the MAPK/ERK pathway, scaffold proteins such as annexin 6 which also
  inhibits ERK activation, neurogranin and calmodulin whose stimulation by PKC leads
  to activation of CAMKII and TRPV1. These PKC-signaling signaling cascades of events
  are involved in the development of tolerance both in the spinal cord and the nucleus
  accumbens (NAc) (). PKC has also an important role in inhibition of receptor recycling
  (; ).'
