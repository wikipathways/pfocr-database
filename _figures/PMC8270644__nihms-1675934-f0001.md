caption: (A) Pregnant mothers can be exposed to environmental thyroid disrupting chemicals
  via inhalation, oral, or dermal routes. Maternal metabolism can transform the parent
  compound into a metabolite, which may or may not possess thyroid disrupting activity.
  If this maternal exposure affects her ability to synthesize and/or transport THs,
  this will result in reduced TH contribution to the fetus. In addition, the parent
  compound and/or metabolites may also cross the placenta. Thus, the fetus can also
  be directly exposed to thyroid disrupting chemicals, an additional consideration
  when evaluating TH-mediated developmental neurotoxicity. (B) Triiodothyronine (T3)
  canonically activates thyroid hormone receptors α and β (pictured here as TR). T3
  binds to TR, and TR heterodimerizes with other nuclear receptors (like retinoic
  acid receptors (RXRs)). These complexes translocate to the nucleus, recruit various
  signaling coactivators (not pictured), bind to genomic DNA, and regulate transcription.
  Both T4 and T3 can also activate the membrane-bound receptor integrin αVβ3 (noncanonical
  signaling). This leads to activation of the map kinase pathway (MAPK, ERK1/2), and
  result in both rapid signal transduction and control of transcription factor activity
  via phosphorylation.
