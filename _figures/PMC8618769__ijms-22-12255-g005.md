caption: 'Phytosterols exert a multitarget approach to ameliorate symptoms of AD.
  (A) Some prevent amyloid-beta aggregation by inhibiting cleavage of the amyloid
  precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE-I). This causes a shift in the non-amyloidogenic
  pathway and reduces the levels of Aβ produced. (B) Aβ can self-aggregate to form
  oligomers and eventually amyloid plaques. Some phytosterols are able to inhibit
  the formation of amyloid plaques by binding to Aβ, inhibiting aggregation, and thereby
  promoting the formation of nontoxic oligomers. Toxic Aβ monomers and oligomers have
  been shown to induce microglial activation and proliferation. Activated microglia
  secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6. (C) Some phytosterols
  have been shown to reduce the levels of these cytokines. Some phytosterols reduce
  oxidative stress by increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes and reducing lipid
  peroxidation. (D) Acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter essential for processing
  memory and learning, is decreased in both concentration and function in AD. Decreased
  levels of ACh can be restored by anticholinesterase activity of various phytosterols.
  (E) ROS irreversibly oxidize DNA and are important mediators of Aβ-induced neuronal
  cell death in the development of AD. Abbreviations: APP: Amyloid Precursor Protein;
