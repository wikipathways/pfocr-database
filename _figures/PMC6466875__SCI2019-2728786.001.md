caption: 'Timeline for cell culture procedures. Cells were obtained by exfoliation
  of the human olfactory epithelium and cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with
  10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 1% streptomycin-penicillin, at 37°C with 5% CO2. A
  clonal culture was obtained through the limiting dilution procedure. Red arrows
  indicate the precise passages from where samples were taken for experiments. hONPC:
  human olfactory neuronal precursor cell.'
