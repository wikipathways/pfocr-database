caption: Transcriptional response of Mtb intermediary metabolism in channeling cholesterol
  degradation metabolites when cholesterol is utilized as a sole carbon source. DGE
  analysis of the main pathways of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate amelioration
  in Mtb and ∆prpR mutant. The two datasets represent DGE analysis comparing growth
  in glycerol vs cholesterol of the Mtb wild-type strain (W) and ΔprpR mutant (∆).
  Transcriptional changes that were not cholesterol-specific (were present also in
  standard 7H9/10% OADC medium) were excluded from the analysis. See the color key
  for log2FC values. TCA tricarboxylic acid cycle, GC glyoxylate cycle, MCC methylcitrate
  cycle, MMP methylmalonyl pathway. Up-regulated and down-regulated pathways are shown
  in red and blue, respectively.
