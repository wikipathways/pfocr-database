caption: 'SHP2 inhibition improves the tumor growth suppression of celastrol in CRC.
  (A) Background activation of the RTKs-SHP2-AKT/ERK pathway in normal and CRC cells.
  (B) CRC under high-dose celastrol treatment. Activation of AKT/ERK was strongly
  suppressed. (C) CRC under low-dose celastrol treatment. Feedback reactivation of
  AKT/ERK through the RTKs-SHP2-ARK/ERK axis showed a dominant effect. (D) CRC under
  combined treatment of low-dose celastrol and SHP099. SHP099 and low-dose celastrol
  cooperatively reduced p-AKR/p-ERK and resulted in a synergic anti-CRC effect. Red:
  activated; black: suppressed.'
