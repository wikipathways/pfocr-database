caption: 'The interactome space of the edible plants associated to colon cancer. (A)
  (i) The pie chart offers information for the compounds present in these edible plants;
  phytochemicals found as exact match in ChEMBL (orange), phytochemicals having at
  least one similar small molecule present in ChEMBL (blue) phytochemicals that do
  not fulfill any of the above criteria (green); (ii) A graphical representation of
  how the interactome map between edible plants and candidate colon cancer protein
  targets was generated: (a) an edible plant (orange circle; Px) contains a phytochemical
  (box; Cx) which interacts directly with a target protein (green diamond; TPx) or
  through a first-degree neighbor (yellow diamond; Py) of TPx, (b) the phytochemical
  Cx is structurally similar with a compound (Cy) that interacts with the target protein
  (TPx). Straight lines represent verified interactions while dashed lines represent
  predictions; (iii) The Venn diagram shows the overlap between the proteins in the
  three candidate colon cancer target sets; (B) A plant-protein interaction network
  based on the interactions between phytochemicals, FDA approved colon cancer drug
  targets and their first-degree neighbors. The size of the plant node is proportional
  to the number of proteins that its molecular components target. The width of the
  edge connecting two plants reflects how many protein targets the plants share. (C)
  A plant-protein interaction network using as a candidate target space the KEGG colon
  cancer pathway. (D) A plant-protein interaction network using as a candidate target
  space the colon cancer prognostic gene signatures (Oh et al., 2012) []. The color
