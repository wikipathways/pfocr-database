caption: a Heatmap of metabolites significantly changed in the brains of MET newborn
  pups (P < 0.05). b Volcano plot of metabolites significantly changed in the brains
  of MET newborn pups (P < 0.05). c Venn diagram of differentially expressed metabolites
  showing the metabolite subfamilies. d Effect of prenatal MET on the one-carbon metabolism.
  Increased metabolites in green, and decreased metabolites in red. e Changes of metabolites
  related lipid synthesis/metabolism. Increased metabolites in green, and decreased
  metabolites in red. f Metaboanalyst pathway analysis of metabolites substantially
  changed in the newborn MET pups (Supplementary Table  shows details of number of
  compounds, hits and p values). g–h changes of metabolites related to g purine metabolism,
  h carnitine synthesis and citric acid cycle. Increased metabolites in green, and
  decreased metabolites in red. i Volcano plot showing differentially expressed metabolites
  in brains from adult MET versus SAL mice. j Metaboanalyst pathway of metabolites
  substantially changed in the adult MET pups (Supplementary Table  shows details
  of number of compounds, hits and p values).
