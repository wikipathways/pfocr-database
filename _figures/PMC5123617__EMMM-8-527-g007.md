caption: 'In normal cells (left panel), the newly synthesized histone variant H2AX
  is predominantly incorporated into the chromatin, where it acts as a major component
  of DNA repair pathway. Following DNA damage, H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated (hereafter
  referred to as γ‐H2AX), γ‐H2AX foci forms at the damaged sites and participate in
  DNA repair, which allows cell survival. In situations of chronic oxidative stress
  (middle panel), associated with reduced activity of the redox sensors JUND or NRF2
  (due to junD or nfe2l2 genetic inactivation, ageing, aggressive BC or following
  chemotherapy), H2AX degradation is increased in the nucleoplasm resulting in reduced
  H2AX content at chromatin. Indeed, ROS induce an enhanced interaction with the E3
  ubiquitin ligase RNF168, which indirectly leads to poly‐ubiquitination of K119,
  followed by H2AX degradation by the proteasome. As a consequence, γ‐H2AX levels
  are also reduced, cells become more sensitive to DNA‐damaging agents and are prompted
  to die. Consistently, in TNBC (right panel), successive cycles of chemotherapy cause
  a persistent oxidative stress, which modulate NRF2 response and decrease H2AX and
  consequently γ‐H2AX levels. This response varies from one patient to another: some
  patients show a defective NRF2 activity with an efficient downregulation of H2AX
  following chemotherapy (major H2AX decrease), while some others show a mild or absent
  reduction in H2AX protein levels (minor H2AX decrease). Tumours with major H2AX
  decrease are significantly enriched in oxidative stress signatures, demonstrating
  the role of redox imbalance in that process. In this group of patients, the efficient
  downregulation of the H2AX protein following chemotherapy prevents DNA repair and
  enhances tumour cell death. Consistently, these patients survive better than the
  ones with minor H2AX decrease, the latter exhibiting resistance to treatment.'
