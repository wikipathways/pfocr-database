caption: Gene expressions in the glycerolipid metabolism pathway (Ko00561) in response
  to Bgt infection. The red color indicates gene expression induction in H24 group;
  the green color indicates gene expression reduction in H24 group; the blue color
  indicates that the expression patterns of some annotated genes were induced and
  some homologous genes were reduced in H24 group.
