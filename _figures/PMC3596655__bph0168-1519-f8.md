caption: Proposed molecular mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effects of allosteric
  SHIP1 activation. PI3Ks are a family of critical intracellular enzymes that catalyse
  the addition of a phosphate molecule specifically to the 3-position of the inositol
  ring to generate the D3 phosphoinositides including PIP3. PI3K initiates signalling
  pathways that regulate, among others, vesicular trafficking, cell proliferation,
  differentiation, protein translation, proinflammatory mediator production, cell
  survival, actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell migration. Two major PIP3 degradation
  pathways have been defined, namely, the 3′-phosphatase phosphatase and tensin homolog
  (PTEN; deleted on chromosome 10; ubiquitously expressed) and 5′-phosphatase SHIP1
  (expressed primarily in haematopoietic cells), which convert PIP3 to PI(4,5)P2 and
  PI(3,4)P2, respectively. Although the PTEN pathway is generally considered a constitutively
  active pathway, SHIP1 activity is dynamically regulated by the cellular environment.
  Pharmacological activation of SHIP1 selectively redirects PIP signalling in haematopoietic
  cells from PIP3-mediated responses to PI(3,4)P2-mediated responses. Although PIP3
  promotes degranulation, pro-inflammatory mediator production and chemotaxis via
  a variety of complex intracellular signalling pathways (solid arrows), PI(3,4)P2
  modulates these responses differentially (dashed arrows). Consequently, after SHIP1
  activation, the cellular response is shifted to an anti-inflammatory phenotype as
  evidenced by reduced activation of Akt signalling, attenuated inflammatory mediator
  production and inhibition of chemotaxis. Akt, protein-serine/threonine kinase activated
  by PIP3; Btk, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; PDK-1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1;
  PIP, phosphatidylinositol phosphate; PLCγ, phospholipase C gamma; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10.
