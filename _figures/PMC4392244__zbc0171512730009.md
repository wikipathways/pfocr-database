caption: Comparing CGN death induced by NSC23766 and ToxB. The schematic illustrates
  the Rac-dependent signaling cascades examined in this study. A, pathway regulated
  by the Rho GTPases Rac, Rho, and Cdc42. B, pathway regulated by the specific pool
  of Rac activated by the GEFs Tiam1 and Trio. Dashed lines represent hypothesized
  effects. Our findings suggest that targeted inhibition of the specific pool of Rac
  activated by the GEFs Tiam1 and Trio promotes CGN death through an alternative pathway
  to that employed by the broad-spectrum Rho family inhibitor ToxB. These pathways
  diverge downstream of PAK, with NSC23766 repressing the MEK5/ERK5 signaling cascade,
  whereas ToxB inhibits MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. ToxB also induces the activation of JNK/c-Jun,
  a pathway that is not activated by NSC23766. ToxB ultimately results in decreased
  degradation and enhanced transcription of Bim, whereas NSC23766 promotes the dephosphorylation,
  mitochondrial localization, and induction of Bad.
