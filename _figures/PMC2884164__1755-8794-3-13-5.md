caption: 'Significant signaling pathway networks mined from pituitary adenoma comparative
  dataset. Significant signaling pathway networks that are involved in human pituitary
  adenoma differentially expressed proteins and that function in (A) cancer, endocrine-system
  development and function, organ morphology (Network 7); (B) lipid metabolism, molecular
  transport, smallmolecule biochemistry (Network 8); and (C) hematological-system
  development and function, tissue morphology, hematological disease (Network 9).
  An orange solid edge denotes a direct relationship between two nodes (molecules:
  proteins; genes). A black unsolid edge denotes an indirect relationship between
  two nodes (molecules: proteins; genes). A red node denotes an up-regulated protein,
  and a green node denotes a down-regulated protein in our studies [,], with different
  color levels that reflect the fold-change of protein differential expression (Additional
  file , Table S2). The various shapes of nodes denote the different functions (Additional
  file , Table S2). A duplicated shape means this node contains multiple components.
  A curved line means intracellular translocation; A curved arrow means extracellular
  translocation.'
