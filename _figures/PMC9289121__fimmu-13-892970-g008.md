caption: Depiction of proteins significantly expressed in osteoclasts of RA donors.
  Proteins with blue frame represent proteins of ATP biosynthetic processes pathway,
  proteins with red frame represent proteins of regulation of T cell mediated cytotoxicity
  pathway. Blue filling shows downregulation of proteins in RA osteoclast samples
  compared to healthy ones, red filling shows upregulation of proteins.
