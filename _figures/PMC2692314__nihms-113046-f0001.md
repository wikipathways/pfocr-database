caption: Chan et al. provide evidence indicating that AngII stimulation of neurons
  in the RVLM increases NADPH oxidase-derived ROS, which in turn damage mitochondrial
  ETC complexes leading to an increase in mitochondrial-produced ROS (solid-line arrows).
  Additional experiments utilizing mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants, such as SOD2,
  are needed to determine the downstream signaling events mediated by mitochondrial-produced
  ROS. Possible targets of mitochondrial-produced ROS include redox sensitive transcription
  factors (TF) and/or ion channels (broken-line arrows).
