caption: (A) Innate immune cells such as DCs dependent upon glycolytic metabolism
  during activation while M2 macrophages rely upon FAO via the scavenger receptor
  CD36. In Addition, amino acid catabolism plays an important role in mediating immunosuppression
  in these cells. Engagement of CD80/CD86 and pro and anti- inflammatory cytokine
  signaling induces IDO and Arg-1 that reduces the bioavailability of tryptophan and
  arginine in the local microenvironment and subsequently results in the release of
  downstream metabolites that blocks metabolic activity in responding T cells. (B).
  ERRα signaling stimulates glycolytic metabolism that includes the upregulation of
  Glut1, glucose uptake and increase in metabolic gene expression in activated T effector
  cells. During this process GAPDH, a bifunctional glycolytic enzyme that usually
  binds to the 3′UTR of cytokine transcripts and prevents their translation is engaged
  in the glycolytic pathway, thereby relieving the inhibition on cytokine translation
  and promoting T cell effector function. (C). Tregs are capable of degrading extracellular
  ATP (indicator of tissue injury) into adenosine (via CD39 and CD73) that activates
  A2AR (adenosine receptors) on Teff cells (B) to generate immunomodulatory signaling
  cascades (such as cyclic AMP [cAMP] production and NFκB (nuclear factor kappa light
  chain enhancer of B cells) inhibition [not shown]) in Teff cells. In contrast to
  Teff, Tregs utilize exogenous fatty acids (FA) to fuel their mitochondrial metabolism
  during differentiation. They also utilize the lipid biosynthetic pathway for the
  expression of CTLA4 and ICOS required for their optimal suppressive function. (D).
  CD8 memory T cells also utilize FAO similar to Tregs. However, in contrast to Tregs
  they depend upon glucose to synthesize lipids (such as cholesterol esters and triacylglycerols)
  that are subsequently hydrolyzed in the lysosome via lysosomal acid lipase (LAL)
  and used for FAO.
