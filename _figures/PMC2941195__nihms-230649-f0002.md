caption: The putative biosynthetic pathway for stephacidin A (14) and notoamide natural
  products. (a). The early stage in stephacidin and notaomide biosynthesis. 25 serves
  as the common precursor to 13 and 14. 13 is then converted into 11 and 12. Substrates
  used in NotC studies were labeled in blue. (b). Notoamide A (9) and B (10) are possibly
  derived from 14. The solid arrows represent reactions that have been confirmed with
  bioinformatic analysis, biochemical analysis, or precursor incorporation experiments,
  while the dashed arrows indicate proposed biosynthetic steps. The red symbol X indicates
  the reaction is not supported by the current study.
