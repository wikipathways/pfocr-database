caption: Convergence of WNT signalling and mechanics. (A) Diagram illustrating how
  both canonical WNT signalling and tension at cellular junctions regulate the intracellular
  level of active β-catenin. Once in the nucleus, β-catenin activates mesodermal genes
  (Meso). F indicates force applied at the cellular junction. (B) Mechanism of patterning
  in WNT-treated gastruloids. Although WNT is provided uniformly, cell responsiveness
  is highest at the periphery, where the cells fail to form a mature epithelium (a).
  WNT positively regulates its expression at the same time as promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) (downregulating E-cadherin) (b). As secreted WNT diffuses, it activates
  the pathway in neighbouring cells. Concomitantly, EMT in the first cell destabilises
  junctional β-catenin in neighbouring cells. This phenomenon propagates from cell
  to cell in an inward direction until a sufficiently high level of secreted WNT inhibitor
  (DKK) terminates the process (c). (C) Comparative diagram of the patterning in embryos
  and BMP4-treated human PSC colonies, whether these colonies are micropatterned on
  stiff plastic dishes or soft hydrogels.
