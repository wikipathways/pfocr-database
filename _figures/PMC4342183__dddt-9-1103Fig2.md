caption: 'Wnt signaling pathway in the target list of hsa-miR-181a-5p, based on TarBase
  6.0.Notes: hsa-181a-5p is a regulator of Wnt. Three Wnt signaling pathways have
  been characterized: the canonical Wnt pathway, the noncanonical planar cell polarity
  pathway, and the noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway. All three Wnt signaling pathways
  are activated by the binding of a Wnt-protein ligand to a Frizzled family receptor,
  which passes the biological signal to the protein Dishevelled inside the cell. The
  canonical Wnt pathway leads to regulation of gene transcription, the noncanonical
  planar cell polarity pathway regulates the cytoskeleton that is responsible for
  the shape of the cell, and the noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway regulates calcium
  level inside the cell. Wnt signaling pathways are highly evolutionarily conserved.
  Wnt signaling has been implicated in the development of breast cancer, EC, and other
  types of cancer., Changes in CTNNB1 expression, which is the gene that encodes β-catenin,
  can be measured in, not just breast cancer but also, colorectal cancer, melanoma,
  prostate cancer, lung cancer, EC, and several other cancer types. Increased expression
  of Wnt ligand-proteins, such as Wnt 1, Wnt2, and Wnt7A, has been observed in the
  development of glioblastoma, esophageal cancer, EC, and ovarian cancer. There is
  clinical and experimental evidence that Wnt/β-catenin pathways are deregulated and
  play an important role in the initiation, development, growth, and metastasis of
  EC.– Targets of hsa-miR-181a-5p are marked with a red star.Abbreviation: EC, endometrial
  cancer.'
