caption: When naïve CD4 T cells interface with cognate antigen-MHC complexes, the
  presence of co-stimulatory (CD28) and co-inhibitory (CTLA-4) activation along with
  type of polarizing cytokines present will determine the helper T cell (Th) subset
  differentiation. Regulatory T cells (Treg) and Th2 polarization favors a more suppressive,
  immune tolerant state (left); whereas Th1 in and Th17 polarization favors a more
  pro-inflammatory state (right). Various immune modulating medications have been
  developed to promote differentiation into Treg and Th2 subsets and to inhibit inflammatory
  Th1 and Th17 differentiation or inhibit resultant cytokines. Schematic for the level
  of Th pathway activation is represented for healthy pregnancy (upper squares) and
  in preeclampsia (PE, lower squares) and separated by local decidua T cell activation
  (left squares) and peripheral T cell activation (right squares). Levels of Th subset
  activation are increased (red), decreased (blue), or unchanged (purple) depending
  on the disease state and location in pregnancy. Created with BioRender.com
