caption: Uses of antibody-based biologics. The type of Fc optimization undertaken
  for an antibody depends on the desired function of the antibody in vivo. Antibody-based
  biologics are principally used as adaptor molecules for effector cell recruitment
  to targets, inducers of the classical complement pathway, agonists, or antagonists.
  (A) Antibody biologics can be used to opsonize target cells or pathogens and recruit
  effector cells to kill or phagocytose the target cell or pathogen. (i) Antibodies
  bind to the antigen via their Fabs and recruit effector cells via their Fc interacting
  with Fc receptors. Recruitment of the effector cell to the target cell and release
  of cytotoxic molecules, such as granzyme and perforin results in target cell killing.
  Alternatively, (ii) effector cells can bind to the Fc of an antibody that has opsonized
  a pathogen, and subsequently phagocytose the pathogen via antibody-dependent cellular
  phagocytosis (ADCP). Much of the Fc engineering effort has been focused on improving
  Fc affinity for various activating FcγRs. The improvement of Fc affinity for FcγRs
  has led to augmented ADCC and ADCP activity for the optimized antibody-based biologic.
  (B) Antibodies can kill target cells through the initiation of the complement pathway.
  The initial step in initiating the complement pathway is the binding of complement
  protein 1q (C1q). (i) C1q binds to the Fc of antibodies in complex with antigen.
  Specific mutations have been introduced into the Fc of antibodies to enhance Fc
  binding affinity to C1q. (C) Agonistic antibody-based molecules are designed to
  bind to ligand and induce signaling by crosslinking a membrane-bound receptor. (i)
  Binding of both Fab arms crosslinks the cell receptor and (ii) subsequent phosphorylation
  of intracellular signal transducers potentiates the receptor signaling. These types
  of antibody-based biologics do not require Fc function; hence these molecules are
  prime candidates for Fc optimization that silences FcγR and complement binding.
  (D) Antagonistic antibody-based biologics bind to a target molecule and prevent
  the function of that protein either directly or by blocking its ligand from binding.
  (i) Typically the ligand binds to its receptor, (ii) but in the presence of the
  antagonistic antibody the receptor binding site is competitively or allosterically
  blocked. The lack of ligand binding prevents intracellular signaling by the membrane-bound
  receptor. In this instance, Fc effector functions are not needed and thus mutations
  that silence Fc effector function can be employed to optimize these types of biologics.
