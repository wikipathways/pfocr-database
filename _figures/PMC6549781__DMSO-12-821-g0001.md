caption: Fructose metabolism via fructokinase. This pathway is uncontrolled and can
  deplete ATP and is involved in uric acid production (as highlighted in the figure).
  Consequently, the fall in ATP and increase in uric acid can cause oxidative stress,
  inhibition of protein synthesis, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which can further
  induce obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver that eventually manifest in
  global metabolic syndrome.
