caption: Schematic illustration of cholesterol metabolism homeostasis and potential
  drugs. (i)Cholesterol bio synthesis. (ii) Cholesterol uptake. (iii) Cholesterol
  storage. (iv) Cholesterol conversion. (v) Cholesterol efflux. (i) De novo cholesterol
  synthesis involves nearly 30 enzymatic reactions, in which HMGR and SQLE are two
  key rate-limiting enzymes. FPP and GGPP, intermediates in this process, contribute
  to the prenylation of RAS and Rho proteins, which is necessary for RAS and Rho signaling
  activation. (ii) Cholesterol uptake is mediated by LDL-LDLR binding, which is followed
  by endocytosis of LDL by cells. However, high cholesterol accumulation leads to
  intracellular lipo-toxicity. High intracellular cholesterol levels suppress SREBP2
  transcription factor activity, thereby restricting the expression of enzymes involved
  in cholesterol synthesis or cholesterol uptake. (iii) Excess cholesterol is converted
  into cholesterol ester by SOAT1 enzyme, then stored in lipid droplets. (iv) Excess
  cholesterol is converted to oxysterol through multiple enzymatic or non-enzymatic
  process. (v) Oxysterol activates LXR-RXR signaling and results in expression of
  ABCA1, ABCG1, and IDOL, which promote the cholesterol efflux pathway.
