caption: '(A) The network “Cancer, Endocrine System Disorders, Gastrointestinal Disease”
  had a highly significant score of 24 after UVA irradiation. (B) After UVB irradiation
  the network “Reproductive System Disease, Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease” with a
  score of 35 is shown. (C) Network analysis of miRNAs similarly changed after UVA
  and UVB radiation identified “Connective Tissue Disorders, Inflammatory Disease,
  Inflammatory Response” as most significant network (score 14). A solid line represents
  a direct interaction and a dashed line indicates an indirect interaction. Colored
  molecules represent miRNAs found to be deregulated in our study (green: down-regulated;
  red: up-regulated).'
