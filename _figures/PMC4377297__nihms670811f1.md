caption: (A) In the CRISPR-mediated immunity, a short segment of DNA from a virus
  or an invading plasmid is integrated into the CRISPR locus containing an array of
  short direct repeats (DR), separated by short spacer sequences. This locus is transcribed
  as a long primary transcript (pre-crRNA) containing multiple repeat-spacer elements
  and processed into short crRNAs by specific Cas (CRISPR-associated) endoribonucleases.
  CrRNAs are assembled in large protein complexes containing Cas proteins, which can
  recognize and cleave the foreign DNA. (B) The piRNA pathway in Drosophila melanogaster.
  A single-strand primary precursor targeting active transposons is transcribed from
  piRNA loci. After processing, it associates with Aubergine (AUB) or Piwi proteins.
  This generates secondary piRNAs that are bound by Argonaute 3 (AGO3), which in turn
  targets and silences transposons and generates new antisense piRNAs from primary
  transcripts. This amplification process is also referred to as a “ping-pong” cycle.
  (C) This illustrates siRNA and antiviral defense. Virus-derived siRNAs are processed
  from viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) arising from replication intermediates by
  members of the Dicer family of endonucleases. These viral siRNAs are then incorporated
  into the RISC, containing an AGO protein, and guide the targeted cleavage of viral
  RNAs. (D) The canonical miRNA biogenesis starts with the transcription of a long
  primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) that can fold back on itself to form a stem
  loop structure. The stem loop is then released from the primary transcript following
  cleavage by a protein complex containing the RNase III Drosha. The resulting precursor
  or pre-miRNA undergoes further processing by Dicer to release a miRNA duplex. Finally,
  one strand is loaded onto the RISC complex and guides the complex to block translation
  or degrade the target mRNA.
