caption: In mammalian cells, the FA pathway is the predominant activity orchestrating
  ICL repair during S-phase, although a role for NER is not excluded. A role for NER
  in the repair of ICLs in G1-phase of the mammalian cell cycle has been demonstrated,
  but it is unclear whether the FA pathway can contribute outside of S-phase. The
  work of Mulderring and Garaycoechea underlines the important role for TC-NER in
  response to ICLs. The extreme sensitivity of XPF-ERCC1 deficient cells, outside
  of its role in either NER and FA pathways, implies the existence of additional repair
  pathway(s) for counteracting ICLs. These could involve (in a nonexclusive manner),
  MMR, FAN1, SNM1A, CSB, and HRR events initiated by alternative endonucleases. CSA,
