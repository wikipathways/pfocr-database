caption: The antioxidant signaling pathway is regulated by quercetin. Environmental
  factors increase the production of ROS. The mitochondrial electron transport chain
  is another robust source of intracellular ROS generation. Quercetin can regulate
  the enzyme-mediated antioxidant defense system and the non-enzyme-dependent antioxidant
  defense system. It can also restrict signal pathways such as NRFB, AMPK, and MAPK
  caused by ROS to promote the antioxidant defense system and maintain oxidative balance.
  ROS, in turn, enhance the production of APE1/Ref1 and the activation of several
  signaling events, including p53-mediated apoptotic events, MAPK pathways, the NF-E2-related
  factor (NRF2)-mediated activation of genes containing antioxidant response element
  (ARE), and NF-κB [67,154,155]
