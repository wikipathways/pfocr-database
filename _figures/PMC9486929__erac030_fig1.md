caption: Fe transport processes in leaves. Leaves of dicot plants such as Arabidopsis
  primarily receive Fe through the vasculature via root-to-shoot Fe translocation
  in the xylem vessels or from source–sink Fe redistribution processes operated by
  the phloem. Fe(III)-Cit is the dominant species of Fe in the xylem (1) that reaches
  the leaf tissues. Fe-carboxylates originating from the xylem sap are thought to
  infiltrate the intracellular spaces and the apoplast (2). Although under the slightly
  acidic environment in the apoplastic spaces Fe(III)-carboxylates have a high stability,
  ligand exchange towards NA has not been clarified yet. Parenchyma cells around the
  vasculature (3) express YSL1 and YSL3, thus Fe-NA uptake is also suggested. Mesophyll
  cells (4) primarily operate a reduction-based method of Fe acquisition. FRO family
  enzymes can utilize Fe(III)-carboxylate complexes; Asc-mediated reduction and photoreduction
  of Fe(III)-carboxylates might be also involved, as shown by the redundant nature
  of the ferric chelate reductase activity of the mesophyll. In addition to Fe translocation
  in the xylem, the phloem (5) is also involved in the redistribution and transport
  of Fe, although the magnitude of xylem transportation is supposedly significantly
  higher. In all cytoplasm-filled environments, including the phloem, the presence
  of Fe-NA species is suggested to keep Fe soluble. Moreover, the transport of Fe
  species involved in long-distance Fe signalling may also use the phloem transportation
  pathway. The nature of phloem unloading with respect to Fe species has not been
  clarified yet. Cells that are symplastically connected through plasmodesmata might
  not need special Fe transporters. Indeed, the presence of YSL transporters, especially
  during leaf development and at senescence initiation, indicate that the transport
  of Fe-NA species is also important in the phloem transport of Fe. For abbreviations
  and further details see the text.
