caption: 'The anti-cancer mechanisms of leeks and their active compounds. Allicin
  or quercetin isolated from Allium extract exerts its anti-cancer effects mainly
  through the following pathways: activating apoptosis and autophagy mediated by AMPK/mTOR
  and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways, changing the expressions of Bax/Bcl-2, releasing
  cytochrome c from mitochondria and increasing cleaved Caspase 9 and Caspase 3, thus
  promoting the apoptosis of cancer cells. Inhibition of mTOR can significantly promote
  the expressions of Atg 5, Atg 7, Beclin1 and LC3B, which can promote the autophagy
  of cancer cells'
