caption: Molecular pathways mediate CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity. Efficient CTL-mediated
  lysis of target cells requires cell-cell interaction and CTL activation mediated
  by signaling via the TCR triggered by recognition of the class I MHC/peptide complex
  (not shown). T cell activation leads to polarization of the T cell and development
  of an immunological synapse between the CTL and the target cell. CTL induction of
  target cell death can be mediated by three distinct molecular pathways. The cytotoxic-granule
  exocytosis pathway is dependent upon perforin, a pore-forming protein, which facilitates
  the entry of granzymes into the target cell cytosol, where they induce apoptosis.
  Although this is the principal mechanism by which CTL kill target cells, activated
  CTL also express CD95L (FasL) which can bind to CD95 (Fas) on the target cell surface
  and initiate Fas-induced apoptosis. Finally, expression of membrane TNF or secretion
  of TNF by CTL can promote TNF receptor induced death of the target cells.
