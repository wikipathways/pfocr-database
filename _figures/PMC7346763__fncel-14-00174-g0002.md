caption: 'Schematic of the transmembrane receptors for CSPGs and myelin-associated
  inhibitors and the signaling pathways downstream of two receptor protein tyrosine
  phosphatases (RPTPs). CSPGs induce growth inhibition by binding and activating several
  transmembrane receptors, including PTPσ, leukocyte common antigen related (LAR),
  NgR1, and NgR3. (A) Intracellularly, activation of PTPσ and LAR by CSPGs activate
  RhoA/ROCK signaling and inactivate Akt and Erk pathways. However, the two receptors
  use distinct pathways downstream of RhoA/ROCK, Akt/GSK-3β, and Erk signals to mediate
  inhibition of axon growth by CSPGs. CSPGs also can bind NgR1 and NgR3 to inhibit
  axon growth. Intracellularly, NgR functions are mediated mainly by the Rho pathway.
  Red-filled: signals conveyed by PTPσ. Green-filled: signals conveyed by LAR. Yellow-filled:
  signals shared by both PTPσ and LAR. Ig-like, immunoglobulin-like domains; FN-III,
  fibronectin Type III domains; D1, D1 domain; D2, D2 domain; S6K, S6 kinase. (B)
  Myelin-associated inhibitors (NogoA, MAG, and OMgp) interact with NgR1 (for all
  three) and NgR2 (for MAG) to suppress axonal growth through RhoA activation or other
  pathways.'
