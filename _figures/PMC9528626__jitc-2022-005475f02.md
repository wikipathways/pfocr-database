caption: Role of MIF in activation of anti-apoptotic, pro-angiogenic, and pro-proliferative
  pathways. MIF binds the ligand-binding protein CD74 and the signal transducer CD44.
  The MIF-CD74-CD44 complex activates transcription factors that regulate the Src
  proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) and ERK-MAPK pathways, which
  control gene expression and cellular proliferation. The MIF-CD74 interaction activates
  the AKT pathway via the mediation of kinases SRC and PI3K. MIF also interacts with
  JAB1 to activate the JNK and works as a co-activator of the transcription factor
  AP-1. MIF also limits the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoid and revokes
  the glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of PLA2 and arachidonic acid production.
  MIF can inactivate p53-mediated apoptosis and growth arrest, and many pieces of
  evidence connect MIF with inflammation and tumorigenesis. AP-1, activator protein
  1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; IκB,
  inhibitor of NF-κB; JNK, JUN N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
