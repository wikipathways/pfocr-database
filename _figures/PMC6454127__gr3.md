caption: 'Comparison of fluxes between the wild-type case and glycan-producing strain
  of type EcGM3 as calculated by flux balance analysis. (A) Fluxes through key nodes
  of metabolism. Top fluxes correspond to the wild-type case, bottom fluxes are for
  strain EcGM3. Fluxes are normalized by the glucose uptake rate. (B) Total flux into
  each amino acid, normalized to glucose uptake rate. Inset shows fluxes associated
  with glutamate and glutamine synthesis along with the pathway to glycan precursor
  UDP-GlcNAc. The dotted arrow represents a lumped pathway of multiple enzymes leading
  to the glycan precursor. (C) Total flux into selected cofactors, normalized to glucose
  uptake rate. Inset shows the primary modes of NADPH production in each strain. Abbreviations:
  Pentose phosphate pathway, PPP; Extracellular glucose, Glcxt; Glucose-6-phosphate,
  G6P; Fructose 6-phosphate, F6P; 6-phospho D-glucono-1,5-lactone, 6PGL; Glucose 1-phosphate,
