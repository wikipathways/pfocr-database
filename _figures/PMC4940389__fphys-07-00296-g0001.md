caption: Regulation of HH and Wnt/β-catenin signaling by 1,25(OH)2D/VDR and calcium/Casr.
  The keratinocyte expresses VDR and is capable of making its own 1,25(OH)2D3 from
  the vitamin D3 produced from 7-dehydrocholesterol (DHC) under the influence of UVB,
  as it has both Cyp27a1/Cyp2r1 (which convert vitamin D3 to 25OHD3) and Cyp27b1 [which
  converts 25OHD3 to 1,25(OH)2D3]. The keratinocyte also expresses the calcium sensing
  receptor Casr required for calcium induced differentiation. 1,25(OH)2D/VDR suppresses
  Shh and Gli1 expression, inhibiting the HH pathway in keratinocytes. 1,25(OH)2D/VDR
  binds CTNNB1(β-catenin) and increases CDH1(E-cadherin) levels in the plasma membrane
  reducing the amount of β-catenin available for binding to TCF/LEF in the nucleus
  limiting its transcriptional activity. Calcium acting through its receptor is required
  for the formation of the E-cadherin/catenin complex in the plasma membrane. In combination
  these actions reduce the proliferative actions of Shh and Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  in keratinocytes, limiting their ability to induce tumors in the skin.
