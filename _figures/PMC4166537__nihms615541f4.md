caption: A, The third most significant network (Fisher's Exact Test, p<10-42) constructed
  by IPA from genes with confirmed somatic mutations in BC, including KDM6A and RB1
  (highlighted in blue). The number of independently identified mutations is listed
  above each respective gene. Evidence of direct (solid lines) or indirect (dashed
  lines) relationships between gene products is shown. Colored genes indicate decreased
  (green) or increased (red) gene expression in tumors compared to normal bladder
  samples in at least two out of three patient cohorts (FDR < 5%). B, The network
  was created using the co-mutation rate and the frequency of mutation to plot the
  mutations in 3D space. The size of each gene (node) is representative of the times
  it was mutated in different tumors. The connection lines (edges) in the network
  indicate whether the genes were found mutated together in the same tumor, with the
  length and thickness of each line shorter and wider with an increasing co-mutation
  rate. The nodes and edges of our model have been filtered to show only those genes
  found mutated in five or more tumors and edges between genes that were mutated together
  more than once. Node color corresponds to a gene's relative centrality score, with
  genes closer to the center of the network red and genes farther away turning to
  yellow then green at the periphery.
