caption: Metabolic regulation of pulmonary vascular redox signaling. The redox status
  of cytosolic NADH generated primarily by the GAPDH in glycolysis and cytosolic NADPH
  redox derived from PPP by G6PD influence the signaling mechanisms by providing NAD(P)H
  as substrate to Nox and promote ROS generation, production of H2O2 from Nox and
  mitochondria by SOD. Glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx) are oxidized to GSSG
  and Trx-S2, respectively, and are regenerated in a redox cycle by the NADPH-dependent
  enzymes GR or TR. Some of the signaling mechanisms regulating pulmonary vascular
  function, interactions by these metabolic redox control systems, including cGMP
  signaling, potassium (Kv) channels, and processes controlled by NADP(H) redox that
  coordinate the lowering of cytosolic calcium (Ca2+), are included. Several metabolic
  interactions such as favoring glycolysis, inhibition of TCA, activation of PPP,
  signaling mechanisms activating Nox enzymes, depletion of SOD that are potentially
  regulated during the pathophysiology of PH are also shown in the model. COX, cyclo-oxygenase;
  ETC, electron transport chain; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; GR, glutathione reductase; H2O2, hydrogen
  peroxide; Lac, lactate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NO, nitric oxide; Nox, NADPH
  oxidase; ONOO, peroxynitrite; PG, prostaglandin; PH, pulmonary hypertension; PKG,
  protein kinase G; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; Prx, peroxiredoxin; Pyr, pyruvate;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase; SOD, superoxide dismutase;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid; TR, thioredoxin reductase.
