caption: Effect of the Hh signaling pathway on the regulation of proliferation and
  differentiation of SSCs in mammals. (Arrowhead in red in this figure) Hh secreted
  by SCs can promote the expression of various factors in SCs, which helps to maintain
  SSC proliferation. (Arrowhead in blue in this figure) Dhh produced by SC is crucial
  for LCs for maintaining the number of LCs and expression of testosterone, which
  is favorable for the differentiation of SSCs. LCs also produce some undefined inhibitory
  factors that inhibit SSC differentiation. (Arrowhead in black in this figure) as
  SSCs differentiate, the expression of SuFu (a negative regulator of the Hh pathway)
  constantly increases. It inhibits the activity of the Hh pathway, which is beneficial
  for the differentiation of SSCs (arrowhead in black in this figure).
