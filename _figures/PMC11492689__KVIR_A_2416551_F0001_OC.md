caption: 'Schematic diagram of the roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in host response
  to PRRSV infection. The innate immune response serves as the first line of defence
  against viral infections, involving the activation of multiple antiviral signalling
  pathways and the activation and expression of antiviral factors. PRRSV infection
  can induce or suppress the expression of host ncRnas, which can, in turn, indirectly
  inhibit viral replication and proliferation by regulating relevant antiviral factors
  and affecting the expression of antiviral innate immune molecules. The target gene
  sites involved in regulating non-coding RNAs in the innate immune response signalling
  pathways are concentrated in the RLR signalling pathway, nf-κB signalling pathway,
  and JAK-STAT signalling pathway. IL-6: interleukin 6; SOCS1/3: suppressor of cytokine
  signalling 3; tnf-α: necrosis factor alpha; STAT1: signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 1; MYH9: myosin heavy chain 9; SRP14: signal recognition particle
