caption: The effects of bfr mutation on the acyl-CoA pools and energy-related metabolic
  pathways. The metabolic network pathway diagram was constructed based on quantitative
  proteomics data and KEGG analysis. The more DEPs in the bfr mutants were those involved
  in central carbon metabolism, β-oxidation, amino acid degradation and oxidative
  phosphorylation pathways. Short-chain acyl-CoA pools are framed by rectangles
