caption: 'Positive feedback loops of amyloid β hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease in
  connection with disturbance of the kynurenine pathway. The amyloid beta (Aβ) cascade,
  inflammation, tau phosphorylation, and neuroplasticity hypotheses lie in one downward
  cascade, and the glutamate and calcium hypotheses lie in another branched downward
  cascade of pathological events leading to dementia. Positive feedback loops are
  located between inflammation and increased Aβ accumulation, between increased oxidative
  stress and increased Aβ accumulation, and increased glutamate and decreased cadherin
  1 CDh1). Kynurenine (KYN) pathway enzymes are activated by inflammation: the tryptophan
  dioxygenase (TDO) by the glucocorticoid stress hormone, cortisol and indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase
  (IDO1) by pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IFN-γ,
  and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. IFN-γ also activates formamidase and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase
  (KMO) in human microglia and macrophages. KYN pathway metabolites, 3-hydroxykynurenine
  (3-HK) and quinolinic acid (QUIN) are highly reactive free radicals. In addition,
  QUIN is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) agonist, causing excitotoxicity.
  Thus, disturbance of the KYN pathway potentiates inflammation, oxidative free radical
  attack, and excitotoxic glutamate production (partly adopted from Doig, 2018).'
