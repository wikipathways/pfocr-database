caption: Graphical illustration of the interaction between the gut microbial SCFA-induced
  Nrf2 redox signaling pathway and LPS/ROS facilitated systemic inflammatory cytokines.
  Ryegrass upregulates SCFAs and SCFA-producing bacteria, which enhances the GPCR-induced
  AMPK pathway. This pathway causes the dissociation of Keap1 and Nrf2, dependent
  on HDAC inhibition, and then regulates the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Next, the increased
  concentrations of redox signaling Nrf2 pathway-regulated enzymes such as HO-1, T-SOD,
  GSH-Px, CAT, and T-AOC with an exception of MDA and anti-inflammatory cytokines
  (IL-4 and IL-10) collectively ameliorate LPS-induced ROS-mediated NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome
  formation. The downstream regulation of NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome formation resulted
  in reduced systemic inflammation in the spleen tissues of AGF geese. AA, acetic
  acid; BA, butyric acid; PA, propionic acid; VA, valeric acid; IVA, isovaleric acid
