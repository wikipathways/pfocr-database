caption: Reaction pathway models of the nucleotide addition cycle. Four variants of
  the Brownian ratchet model for elongation are presented. Each model differs in the
  placement of the force-dependent translocation step in relation to the NTP-binding,
  catalysis, and phosphate-release steps. Equilibrium constants (for reversible steps)
  and forward rate constants (for essentially irreversible steps) are shown. Groups
  of states corresponding to the translocation event(s) are shaded (orange).
