caption: Role of immune cells and TNF family members in regulating drug-induced liver
  damage. Xenobiotics are absorbed in the gut and transported to the liver, where
  they become metabolized. During the metabolization, toxic intermediates may be generated,
  inducing damage to liver parenchymal cells, most importantly hepatocytes, via activation
  of the Bcl-2-regulated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. This can lead to apoptosis
  via permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, cytC release and subsequent
  apoptosome formation, or necrotic CD if ATP levels are too low. Resulting DAMP (danger–associated
  molecular pattern) release by necrosis or late apoptosis can initiate sterile inflammation
  by activation of liver-resident immune cells, e.g., KC. DAMPs and PAMPs can stimulate
  immune cells, resulting in the release of effector molecules, e.g., cytokines and
  chemokines, which recruit and activate other immune cells. Additionally, DR ligands
  induce the extrinsic CD pathway. In hepatocytes already affected by xenobiotics
  DR activation promotes synergistic CD at otherwise sublethal concentrations. This
  crosstalk between DR and xenobiotics involves caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid,
  DR-induced activation of JNK and Bim, and xenobiotic-induced induction and activation
  of other BH3-only proteins. Resulting neutralization of pro-survival Bcl-2-like
  and activation of Bax-like molecules results in mitochondrial apoptosis or necrosis.
