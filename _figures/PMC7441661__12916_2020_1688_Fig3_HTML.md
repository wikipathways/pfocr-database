caption: Signaling of insulin during insulin resistance. During insulin resistance,
  signaling through AKT kinases is partially impaired. Not all AKT-dependent pathways
  are affected, as well as other signaling pathways, indicating that insulin resistance
  is selective. Therefore, hyperinsulinemia, in the presence of insulin resistance,
  promotes anabolic cell activities via the MEK–ERK pathway and via mTORC1. Although
  the PI3K/AKT pathway is impaired during insulin resistance, and provides only insufficient
  translocation of GLUT4 for glucose uptake and deficient activation of eNOS, there
  appears to be a normal activation of mTORC1. In addition to the anabolic consequences
  of signaling via the MEK/ERK pathway depicted in the figure, there is enhanced expression
  of ET-1 and PAI-1 (not shown), as well as inhibition of autophagy and of the nuclear
  factor Nrf2, which compromises cell constituent turnover and cell defense mechanisms
  to radical stress, respectively. Hyperinsulinemia downregulates glucose uptake not
  only via dampening the PI3K/AKT pathway (“insulin resistance”) but also via as yet
  unknown other pathways
