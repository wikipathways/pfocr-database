caption: RAS pathway (A) and cancer genome landscape overview (B). (A) The RAS pathway
  is activated by EGF and EGF antibody binding to its receptor, EGFR. This binding
  leads to a signaling cascade which includes PI3K-RAS-mTORC and RAS-RAF-MEK ultimately
  leading to cell growth, proliferation, and migration. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
  (TKI) (gray burst), such as erlotinib, used for treatment of non-small cell lung
  cancer, and EGF antibodies, such as cetuximab (red burst), used for treatment of
  colorectal cancer, block the signaling cascade, ultimately halting cancer cell proliferation.
  (B) Cancer genome landscape overview. Multiple passenger mutations (blue array)
  and driver mutations (yellow rectangles) form the base of the triangle and will
  ultimately lead to cancer proliferation (short blue arrow) through multiple molecular
  pathways, including RAS pathway (red circle).(For interpretation of the references
  to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
  article.)
