caption: Enzymatic and spontaneous reactions are performed in the cytosol to produce
  yellow betaxanthins and violet betacyanins that are transported to the vacuole for
  storage. In grey, represents the production of muscaflavin due to the additional
  2,3-L-DOPA-extradiol-dioxygenase activity performed by G. diazotrophicus DODA
