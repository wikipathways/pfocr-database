caption: Schematic representation of a proposed model for Cdc5-dependent regulation
  of Ndt80. In unperturbed meiosis (left), basal levels of Cdc5 would contribute to
  trigger the Ndt80 autoactivation loop that, once engaged, also induces CDC5 expression
  itself as a middle sporulation gene and other genes required for meiotic divisions
  (i.e., CLB1). In contrast, when synapsis or recombination is defective (i.e., zip1
  mutant; right) the checkpoint sensors relay the signal to the Mek1 effector kinase,
  which, in turn, directly or indirectly, affects the two main regulatory branches
  of the checkpoint. Our results indicate that Cdc5 acts specifically on the Ndt80
  branch. It is possible that when the checkpoint is triggered, Cdc5 function is inhibited
  to prevent activation of Ndt80, thus contributing to the meiotic cell cycle delay.
  Alternatively, Cdc5-independent inhibition of Ndt80 by the checkpoint is also plausible.
  See Discussion for additional details.
