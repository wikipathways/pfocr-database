caption: DHA is converted by human 12-lipoxygenase through a lipoxygenase reaction
  involving the abstraction of hydrogen and the antarafacial addition of molecular
  oxygen at carbon 14 to produce 14S-HpDHA, which is also converted to the 13,14-epoxide
  by the same enzyme () denoted 13S,14S-epoxide-maresin, which is further converted
  to the bioactive Maresin 1, which promotes resolution, reduces pain signaling, and
  promotes tissue regeneration. See text for further details and refs. (, , ). The
  epoxide 13,14S-epoxy-maresin is also bioactive and inhibits LTA4 hydrolase, limiting
  the production of LTB4 as well as the conversion of arachidonic acid to 12S-HpETE.
  These actions of the maresin epoxide indicate that activation of the pathway leads
  to down regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators during resolution.
