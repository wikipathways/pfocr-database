caption: Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling pathway network. Genes included are
  from the IPA canonical pathway, and all of them are in differentially accessible
  regions (DARs) in weaning. Red edges represent significant co-expressed genes (>0.8)
  using RNA-seq data. The ITGB1 was selected as the hub gene for the network.
