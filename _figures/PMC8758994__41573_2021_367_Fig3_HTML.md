caption: Regulatory mechanisms of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) involve allosteric regulation,
  covalent modifications and transcriptional changes. Allosteric activators include
  citrate, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) while oxaloacetate
  (OAA) and long-chain fatty acyl (LCFA)-CoAs are allosteric inhibitors. Regulatory
  phosphorylation is facilitated by several enzymes including AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK), AKT, branched-chain α-keto dehydrogenase kinase (BDK), glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 (GSK3) and protein kinase A (PKA), whereas caspase 10 and constitutive
  photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) facilitate the degradation of ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY)
  and fatty acid synthase (FAS), respectively. Transcriptional modifications are regulated
  by two major transcription factors, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c
  (SREBP1c) and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP). Additional
  transcription factors, such as liver X receptor (LXR) are also implicated in the
  transcriptional regulation to varying degrees of importance depending on the cell
  type. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; CIC, citrate/isocitrate carrier; FAS, fatty acid
  synthase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; X5P, xylulose
  5-phosphate.
