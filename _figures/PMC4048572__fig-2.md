caption: Metabolic pathways for ATP production in skeletal myofibers. (A) Skeletal
  muscles require a high amount of ATP for contraction. The main sources of energy
  are Glu and FFA. Glu uptake into the sarcoplasm from blood occurs, among other things,
  through the GLUT4. Once in the cytosol, Glu is phosphorylated by HK and forms Glu-6-P.
  One molecule of Glu-6-P can be converted into two molecules of Pyr through glycolysis,
  a metabolic anaerobic pathway involving 10 enzymes (the enzyme phosphofructokinase
  is an important control point in the glycolytic pathway). Depending on the energy
  needs, Glu-6-P can also be stored as glycogen. In anaerobic conditions Pyr is reduced
  to lactate by LDH. Alternatively, in aerobic conditions, Pyr might be transferred
  into the mitochondria matrix, where it is decarboxylated into acetyl-CoA by the
  PDH complex. Acetyl-CoA is then metabolized through the TCA cycle. The first enzyme
  acting in the TCA cycle is the citrate synthase that forms citrate from acetyl-CoA
  and oxaloacetate. The TCA cycle produces reducing equivalents (NADH, FADH2) and
  CO2. In addition to Pyr, another important source of acetyl-CoA is the β-oxidation
  of FFA. FFA enter the myofiber through a passive flip-flop or through a protein-mediated
  mechanism such as the FAT/CD36. In the cytosol, FFA undergo esterification and form
  triglycerides stored as lipid droplets that are surrounded by mitochondria. Alternatively,
  at the mitochondrial OM, they can be condensed with CoA to form FFA-CoA and, through
  the CPT1, they can cross the mitochondrial IM and reach the mitochondrial matrix
  where they undergo β-oxidation. β-oxidation is a cycle of four reactions. Each cycle
  produces a molecule of acetyl-CoA which, in turn, enters the TCA cycle. Along with
  acetyl-CoA, during β-oxidation, FADH2 and NADH are also formed. In skeletal muscles,
  at rest, excess of ATP produced is stored as PCr. ATP is converted into ADP and
  Pi by ATPase, and the Pi is used to convert Cr in PCr whose amount is roughly 10
  times higher than the amount of ATP. During intense activity, PCr can anaerobically
  donate a phosphate group to ADP and form ATP for quick regeneration of ATP. PCr
  is, therefore, a rapid system to supply energy during contraction. The reversible
  phosphorylation of Cr is catalyzed by several CK. Once ATP also produced by PCr
  is consumed, the AK (myokinase) catalyzes the formation of ATP and AMP from two
  ADP molecules. During exercise, the amount of ATP produced by the myofiber increases
  enormously. However, the stores of ATP that can be detected in the myofiber are
  not as high, as ATP is stored in the form of PCr. (B) Reducing equivalents (NADH
  and FADH2) generated mainly during TCA, β-oxidation, and glycolysis are oxidized
  by the complexes of the respiratory chain (Complex I, II, III, and IV) in the oxidative
  phosphorylation pathway. Electrons are transferred from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen
  (which is reduced to H2O) by means of the enzyme complexes and by the electron carriers
  Ub and Cyt c of the respiratory chain. The energy released by reducing equivalent
  oxidation as electrons pass from one complex to the next is used to pump protons
  (H+) across the IM into the intermembrane space. This creates an electrochemical
  proton gradient across the IM, which is highly energetic. Protons can flow along
  this gradient through ATP synthase (ATPase or complex V); this backflow releases
  the energy of the proton gradient, which is used by ATP synthase to phosphorylate
  ADP and to form ATP. This phosphorylation of ADP is called oxidative, as it is coupled
  to the presence of oxygen that enables the oxidation of reducing equivalents. By
  this mechanism, nutrients are oxidated and their energy is stored in usable energy
  as ATP. ATP is also produced in a lower amount during glycolysis. OM, outer membrane;
