caption: The regulatory mechanism of ERK1/2 signaling in promoting insulin secretion
  and insulin resistance. High glucose can activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway by
  increasing Ca2+ influx and ROS production, leading to the entry of activated ERK
  into the nucleus. ERK1/2 in the nucleus can then activate downstream promoters,
  promoting the proliferation of islet β cells and the secretion of insulin. Activated
  ERK1/2 can lead to increased serine phosphorylation and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation
  of RS1, thereby inhibiting the downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway of insulin
  and ultimately causing insulin metabolism disorders
