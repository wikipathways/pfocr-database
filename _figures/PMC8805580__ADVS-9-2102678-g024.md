caption: 'Schematic illustration of some possible effects of ion‐incorporated MBGs
  for cancer therapy. Apoptosis can be induced by triggering mitochondrial damage
  and upregulating proapoptotic factors such as caspases. Furthermore, DNA damage
  and molecular pathways involved in cancer proliferation such as Akt, MAPK, and STAT3
  can be modulated. As a major mechanism involved in cancer metastasis, angiogenesis
  of cancer cells can be regulated by MBGs by affecting HIF signaling pathway. Abbreviations:
  MBG, mesoporous bioactive glass; HIF, hypoxia‐inducible factor; TRP, transient receptor
  potential; CaSR, calcium‐sensing receptor; Cyt C, cytochrome C; STAT3, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3; Akt, protein kinase B; MAPK, mitogen‐activated
  protein kinase; DOX, doxorubicin.'
