caption: Schematic model of the MK2/HuR pathway in the post-transcriptional regulation
  of TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression. The present results show that HuR nucleo-cytoplasmic
  shuttling mediated by TNF-α stimulation results in the stabilization of ICAM-1 mRNAs
  and increased protein production. The possible mechanism is that MK2 induces HuR
  cytoplasmic translocalization, which leads to an increase in stability of HuR-mRNA
  complex formation, and therefore increases ICAM-1 expression. TNFR, TNF-receptor;
  sICAM-1, soluble ICAM-1
