caption: Feedback excitation and post-inhibitory rebound hypothesis for the swimming
  circuit. (A) Responses of a single dIN illustrate the fundamental mechanisms. (1)
  Fast short excitation at time 0 makes dIN fire but short inhibition at 20 ms does
  not lead to rebound from the resting potential (black line). (2) when dIN feeds
  back long NMDA excitation, it holds the dIN depolarized but it does not fire (red).
  (3) if inhibition occurs during depolarization it leads to rebound dIN firing and
  a new cycle can start (blue). (B) The model network with populations equivalent
  to 30 of each type of neuron in each half-center. A skin stimulus to one RB neuron
  activates the network via sensory pathway interneurons. (C) Example of network swimming
  activity following a single RB impulse. (based on Sautois et al., ).
