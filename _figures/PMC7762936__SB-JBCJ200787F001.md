caption: Branches and alternative end products of the cholesterol synthesis pathway.
  Cholesterol synthesis proceeds via the early pathway, which converts acetyl-CoA
  to lanosterol, and the post-lanosterol pathway, which converts lanosterol to cholesterol
  through the Bloch or modified Kandutsch–Russell pathways. Double-headed arrows indicate
  multiple enzymatic steps. For the effect of cholesterol on the post-translational
  regulation of pathway enzymes, refer to . Alternative end products are formed by
  branches of the cholesterol synthesis pathway. The early pathway intermediate farnesyl
  diphosphate is the precursor to isoprenoids such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate,
  which augments the sterol-induced degradation of HMGCR. The Kandutsch–Russell pathway
  intermediate 7-dehydrocholesterol is the precursor to vitamin D, which promotes
  the degradation of the downstream enzyme DHCR7 in keratinocytes. Cholesterol itself
  can be converted to other products such as bile acids, steroid hormones, and oxysterols.
