caption: Figure 2. p53 and cell cycle regulation. With DNA damage there is upregulation
  of wild-type p53 protein. This leads to increased transcription of p53-regulated
  genes (e.g., p21, bax-1, bcl-2), which inhibit the cell cycle. This facilitates
  DNA repair, or the cell enters the apoptotic pathway. In this way p53 provides genomic
  stability. Mutations in the p53 gene render the p53 protein inactive, and the damaged
  DNA is transmitted.
