caption: Potential mechanisms underlining the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)/sphingosine
  kinase 1 (SphK1)/S1P receptor (S1PR) 2 signaling axis in pulmonary arterial hypertension
  (PAH). Hypoxia and other potential stimuli, such as growth factors and inflammatory
  mediators, up-regulate SphK1 expression, increasing S1P production in pulmonary
  artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). S1P ligates S1PR2 on the PASMC surface, leading
  to the phosphorylation of both ERK and signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) 3, both known to induce cell proliferation. Abnormal PASMC proliferation
  leads to pulmonary vascular remodeling, thereby increasing pulmonary vascular resistance
  (PVR), which results in PAH.
