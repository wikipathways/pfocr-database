caption: Flow diagram showing health states, treatment outcomes and the passive and
  active case-finding care pathways followed by patients in the compartmental model
  of tuberculosis. (a) Compartments labelled in red denote infectious health states.
  Dashed lines represent the process of diagnosis and treatment initiation, following
  pathways represented in (b) and (c). Panel (b) shows the radiology based case finding
  pathway and (c) the radiology followed by GeneXpert case finding pathway. MDR TB*
  disease presumptively treated with DS TB drugs switched to MDR TB treatment after
  DST results.
