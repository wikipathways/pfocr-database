caption: NETs formation pathways. Generally speaking, Neutrophil extracellular traps
  (NETs) form via two pathways depending on the stimuli. The first involves neutrophil
  death termed as NETosis. Activated neutrophils in response to PMA, LPS and IL-8
  induces NADPH Oxidase (Nox2)-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  ROS then triggers the downstream signalling cascade for chromatin decondensation,
  including neutrophil elastase (NE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), which translocate
  into the nucleus and cooperate for chromatin decondensation. ROS also activates
  protein-arginine deiminase type 4 (PAD4), which hypercitrullinates histones, contributes
  to chromatin decondensation. Decondensed chromatin are then released into the cytoplasm,
  mixing with granule proteins and forming NETs. Finally, the plasma membrane permeabilizes,
  allowing for NETs expulsion while the neutrophil dies. The second pathway is non-lytic
  NETs formation that occurs in response to calcium ionophores or Staphylococcus aureus
  in the absence of cell lysis. Similar to the budding of extracellular vesicles,
  this process involves the release of nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) bound
  vesicles into the extracellular space where they are ruptured, leaving the neutrophil
  alive without nuclear or loss of mtDNA
