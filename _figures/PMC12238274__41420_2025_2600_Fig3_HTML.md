caption: 1.The exogenous and endogenous ROS generation mediated by ApoE4 and Aβ can
  activate inflammatory signaling pathways, primarily through NF-κB [65, 88–90]. ApoE4
  can also directly influence NF-κB transcription [57]. 2.Excessive ROS production
  and lysosomal damage (leakage of hydrolases) induced by ApoE4, Aβ, tau, and other
  factors can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, promoting the cleavage of Pro-IL-1β
  and Pro-IL-18 [71, 90]. 3.TREM2 not only promotes phagocytosis, suppresses inflammation,
  and reduces lipid accumulation, but also supports aerobic glycolysis via the mTOR
  pathway to provide energy for the inflammatory response; however, its signaling
  may be negatively regulated by ApoE4 [39, 95, 98]. 4. ApoE4-mediated lipid metabolism
  dysregulation can also enhance MHC-II-dependent antigen presentation and T cell
  activation in microglia, while upregulating neuronal MHC-I expression, thereby amplifying
  immune signaling [129]. 5.Under inflammatory conditions, ApoE4 increases GLS activity,
  further inducing microglial activation and promoting glutamate production and release,
  exacerbating neurotoxicity [137]. ATP adenosine triphosphate; DAP12 DNAX-activating
  protein of 12 kDa; HMGB1 high mobility group box 1; Gln glutamine; GLS glutaminase;
