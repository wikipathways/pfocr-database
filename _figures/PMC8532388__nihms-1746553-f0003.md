caption: A unified biosynthetic pathway for the anthraquinone-fused enediynes, featuring
  intricate A-ring hydroxylation by tailoring enzymes as exemplified by DynOrf19 and
  DynE10 for DYN A (1), YpmL for YPM A (3), and TnmL for TNM A (4), as well as TnmH
  that catalyzes regiospecific methylation of the C-7 hydroxyl group. Blue arrows
  were supported by the isolation of 9 and 10 from the ΔtnmH mutant strain S. sp.
  SB20002 and in vitro characterization of TnmH-catalyzed formation of TNM G (11)
  from 9 and TNM D (12) from 10. The dotted-arrow, proposed previously based on the
  isolation of 12, as well as shunt metabolites supporting the intermediacy of 11,
  from wild-type S. sp. CB03234, is disproved by in vitro characterization of TnmL
  in the current study. Red arrows, supported previously by the isolation of TNM B
  (7) and TNM E (8) from the ΔtnmL mutant strain S. sp. SB20020, are now confirmed
  by in vitro characterization of TnmL in the current study. The green arrow highlights
  TnmL-catalyzed demethylation of 11 to 9, thereby channeling 11 back to 4 biosynthesis,
  representing a rare proof-reading logic for natural product biosynthesis discovered
  in the current study.
