caption: 'B-cell receptor signaling in CLL. (A) The BCR is composed of membrane immunoglobulin
  bound to CD79a/CD79b. Antigen binding induces CD79a/CD79b ITAM recruitment of Syk
  and Lyn initiating the signaling cascade. (B) Signalosome complex. Phosphorylation
  of CD79a/CD79b recruits a number of kinases and adaptor proteins, which form the
  initial signaling complex of the BCR. (C) Intermediate activation. Signalosome activation
  recruits a number of additional kinases leading to activation down 3 main pathways:
  Btk, PLC-γ2, and PI3K. Btk is phosphorylated by itself; Syk, and Lyn, which lead
  to phosphorylation of PLC-γ2, activation of NFκB; and recruitment of PIP5K. PLC-γ2
  is phosphorylated by Btk and Syk and leads to production of DAG and IP3. PI3K activation
  leads to phosphorylation of PIP2 to PIP3.'
