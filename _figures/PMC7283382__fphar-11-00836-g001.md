caption: The RAAS balance between AngII/AT1-R and ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Ang(1-7)R axes. The
  former is enhanced in CVD conditions triggering various intracellular pathways via
  MAPK signaling, which ultimately leads to cardiac and vascular remodeling, endothelial
  dysfunction, and atherosclerosis. ACE2, on the other hand, decreases inflammation
  by countering the effect of the ACE/AngII/AT1-R axis. ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Ang(1-7)R signaling
  pathway not only ameliorates cellular proliferation, hypertrophy, oxidative stress,
  and vascular fibrosis but also reduces the activation of the downstream MAPK cascades.
  AT1-R activation triggers p38 MPAK-dependent ACE2 excision and shedding leading
  to a reduced cell surface expression. As demonstrated in other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2
  replication might be enhanced as a result of increased MAPK activity downstream
  of AngII in CVD patients.
