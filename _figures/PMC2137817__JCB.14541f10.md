caption: A model for the alternative routes of transport of Gap1p from the late-Golgi
  controlled physiologically by nitrogen source, and genetically by SEC13 and PEP12.
  In cells grown on either ammonia or urea, Gap1p is packaged into Golgi-derived vesicles
  destined for the plasma membrane. On glutamate, or in a sec13-1 mutant, Gap1p is
  diverted to the vacuole. This model is based on the idea that a specialized class
  of vesicle carries Gap1p to the plasma membrane and that unregulated permeases and
  other plasma membrane proteins are transported by a general class of vesicles. Alternatively,
  loading of Gap1p into general secretory vesicles could be regulated by both Sec13p
  and in response to the nitrogen source.
