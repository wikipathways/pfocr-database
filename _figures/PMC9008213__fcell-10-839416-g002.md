caption: Relationship between autophagy and endometrial cancer. (A). Endometrial carcinogenesis
  and autophagy. Frequent mutations of autophagy-related genes and activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway, which result in autophagy attenuation, are observed in endometrial cancer.
  Autophagy attenuation may lead to type 1 endometrial carcinogenesis, indicating
  a potential tumor-suppressive role of autophagy inducers such as calorie restriction,
  exercise, and metformin. In contrast, type 2 endometrial cancer develops from atrophic
  endometrium due to TP53 mutation, which triggers an increase in p16 increase and
  autophagy. (B). Endometrial cancer development and autophagy. Cytotoxic chemotherapy
  fails to kill cancer stem cells (CSCs) with increased autophagy, leading to cancer
  relapse. However, autophagy inhibitors can efficiently eliminate CSCs.
