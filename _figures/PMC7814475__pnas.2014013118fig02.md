caption: 'Schematic of the supply窶電emand model of early and late fermentation and
  mechanisms for maintaining FBP, G6P, and ATP homeostasis during early (Upper) and
  late (Lower) fermentation under high-glucose aerobic conditions. The glycolytic
  pathway, the glycogen trehalose/shunt, and FBPase are grouped into a supply窶電emand
  pathway. For the supply portion of the pathway, the following enzymes are grouped
  together: HK, GT and HK; PFK, phosphoglucose isomerase, PFK, and PFK-2/FBPase 2,
  which regulates the level of the allosteric effector F2,6BP (see SI Appendix, section
  3 for a detailed description); and FBPase. The demand pathway, PK, consists of all
  of the glycolytic enzymes after FBP. Allosteric regulation of each group of enzymes
  is indicated by dashed lines and arrows. Velocities of each enzyme group are represented
  by VHK, VPFK, Vshunt, and VPK and are normalized to the velocity through HK in the
  early fermentation state (VHK1), which is set to 100. (Upper) Early fermentation
  state (glycogen/trehalose synthesis). Under nitrogen starvation conditions, G6P
  and FBP concentrations are regulated by storage of the excess flow from glucose
  into G6P through glycogen synthesis (Vshunt, mechanism 1). ATP consumption due to
  glycogen synthesis and futile cycling between PFK and FBPase balances ATP synthesis
  by the demand pathway (VFBPase, mechanism 2). Based on flux-balance analysis, the
  relative fluxes shown are required to maintain steady-state levels of G6P, FBP,
  and ATP, in good agreement with experimental measurements (, ). (Upper) Early fermentation
  state (no glycogen synthesis/trehalose futile cycling). Under conditions when nitrogen
  sources are present during early fermentation, yeast do not synthesize glycogen
  and trehalose. The glycolytic flux imbalance is compensated for by inhibition of
  HK velocity due to an increase in the concentration of the intermediate in the trehalose
  shunt pathway T6P (mechanism 3) (). ATP homeostasis is maintained through trehalose
  and futile cycling (mechanism 4) (), which also helps regulate Pi levels allowing
  the velocity of PK to increase to match the supply velocity. Once these velocities
  reach steady state, trehalose futile cycling declines. (Lower) Late fermentation
  state. Changes in gene expression and increased posttranslational enzyme degradation
  results in suppression of the glycogen/trehalose shunt and FBPase activity. The
  concentrations of G6P and FBP, and the fluxes through HK and PFK, remain constant,
  but there is a fivefold drop in the concentrations of the allosteric modulators
  T6P and F2,6BP (). The predominant glycolytic enzyme isoforms due to gene expression
  become HK2, PFK2, and PK1 (, , , ). These changes result in enhanced allosteric
  sensitivity for activation of PK by FBP (mechanism 5) and, due to higher T6P and
  F2,6BP affinity, compensate for the drop in their concentration maintaining the
  elasticity of HK at early fermentation levels (mechanism 4) while increasing the
  elasticity of PFK to F6P (mechanism 6). Additional homeostatic regulation, by balancing
  the supply and demand relative glycolytic intermediate levels, is provided by F2,6BP
  (mechanism 7).'
