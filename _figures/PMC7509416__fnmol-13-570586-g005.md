caption: p38 functions in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Mechanisms involving
  p38 kinases have been described for a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.
  (A) In ischemia or traumatic brain injury, microglial p38α and p38β contribute to
  neuroinflammation by targeting MAPKAP kinase-2 (MK2), which promotes the release
  of proinflammatory cytokines. This mechanism is relevant to other conditions associated
  with neuroinflammation. Hypoxia is a key stimulus activating p38α and p38γ in neurons
  and microglia. (B) In nociception and pain, p38α in nociceptive neurons promotes
  the expression of TRPV1 channels that contribute to nociception. p38β in spinal
  cord neurons promotes nociception, while microglial p38β has an inhibitory role
  in nociception. (C) In ALS mouse models based on mutant SOD1, p38α downstream of
  ASK1 or MST1 is activated and impairs retrograde transport. (D) In Alzheimer’s disease,
  neuronal p38α can be activated by a variety of stimuli, including amyloid-beta,
  RAGE or aberrant glutamate receptor engagement. p38α activity promotes amyloid aggregation,
  LTP and neuroinflammation. p38γ inhibits the toxic function of tau in neurons by
  direct phosphorylation of tau. Interestingly, microglial p38α reduces amyloid plaque
  load in models of AD by promoting phagocytic activity. (E) In Parkinson’s disease,
  p38α in dopaminergic neurons is activated by alpha-synuclein aggregates. p38α promotes
  DA neuron loss by direct phosphorylation of Parkin-1. Activity in DA neurons is
  regulated by ASK1 upstream of p38α. This pathway can be inhibited by survival factors
  CIB1 and klotho.
