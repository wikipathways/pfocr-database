caption: The biosynthesis pathways of menaquinone in isoforms from Bacillus subtilis,
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. coelicolor [, , ]. Menaquinone biosynthesis is a
  complex process involving multiple metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, the pentose
  phosphate pathway, the shikimate pathway, the MEP or MVA pathway, as well as the
  classical MK pathway or futalosine pathway. a The important intermediates chorismate
  and polyisoprene are synthesized from the precursors G3P, pyruvate and E4P. b The
  classical pathway and the futalosine pathway for the biosynthesis of menaquinone.
  Enzymes are displayed in different colors in different pathways. Red typeface indicates
  several important intermediate metabolites
