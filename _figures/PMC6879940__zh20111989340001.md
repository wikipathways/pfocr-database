caption: Proposed mechanisms of podocyte susceptibility to lipid-mediated injury.
  1) Upregulation of free fatty acids (FFA). The CD36 pathway leads to the accumulation
  of triglyceride (TG)-enriched lipid droplets and activation of inflammasome pathways,
  which causes mitochondrial damage and podocyte injury. 2) Overexpression of sphingomyelin
  phosphodiesterase acid-like 3b (SMPDL3b) leads to the accumulation of ceramide (Cer)-1-phosphate
  (C1P) and disruption of insulin receptor (IR)/caveolin-1 (Cav1) interactions, which
  results in decreased phosphorylation of PKB (Akt) and increased podocyte injury.
  3) Local TNF-α causes activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and
  its translocation to the nucleus, where it blocks transcription of ATP-binding cassette
  transporter A1 (ABCA1), resulting in the accumulation of cholesterol and esterified
  cholesterol-enriched lipid droplets, leading to mitochondrial damage and podocyte
  injury. NLRP3, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and
  pyrin domain containing 3; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TNFR, TNF receptor; SOAT1,
  sterol O-acyltransferase 1.
