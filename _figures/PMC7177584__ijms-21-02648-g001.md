caption: PRDM proteins contribution in the mechanisms related to invasiveness and
  metastasis. This scheme illustrates the proposed molecular mechanisms involving
  some PRDMs during invasion and metastasis. (A) Higher PRDM1 expression is detected
  in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-negative breast cancer cells and primary breast
  tumors. Mechanistically, Bcl-2, induced by RelB, interacts with and activates Ras
  in the mitochondrial membrane. In turn, Ras induces the expression of PRDM1/BLIMP1,
  which downregulates ERα gene expression by direct binding to its promoter, thus
  promoting a reduction in the levels of E-cadherin and γ-catenin and a corresponding
  increase in the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells. The lymphocyte lineage-restricted
  transcription factor Aiolos negatively regulates PRDM1 and p66Shc transcription;
  in addition, loss of PRDM1 expression reduces the expression of p66Shc. Thus, the
  absence of PRDM1 protein promotes cancer cell invasion and at the same time confers
  anoikis resistance to the cancer cell. (B) TGF-β1 promotes PRDM1/BLIMP1 gene transcription
  via c-Raf and AP-1 pathway. Blimp1, in turn, by reducing the expression of BMP-5,
  induces the expression of SNAI1, the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) master
  regulator. (C) The miR-23b downmodulation and the ErbB2/p130Cas/MAPK axis activation
  increases the expression of the transcriptional repressor PRDM1/Blimp1, thus mediating
  cell invasion. (D) PRDM3 synergizes with FOS in expression regulation of gene products
  controlling cell invasion. PRDM4 mediates cell invasion by interacting with YAP
  at ITGB2 gene promoter. PRDM13 upregulates DLC1 and ARHGAP30 proteins thus inhibiting
  cell invasion. (E) PRDM2 controls the expression of several genes involved in EMT,
  with vimentin being the most significantly regulated gene. PRDM16 inhibits EMT by
  repressing the transcription of MUC4. (F) The miR-424→cdc42→prdm14 axis controls
  cell invasion. In particular, miR-424 knockdown induces expression of Cdc42 that
  in turn positively regulates PRDM14 through the activation of Pak1 and Stat5. PRDM14
  promotes cell migration by regulating the expression level of matrix metalloproteinase
  (MMP)/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). Knockdown of PRDM14 reduced
  cancer stem cell phenotypes via miR-125a-3p and Fyn expression regulation in pancreatic
  cancer (see text for additional details).
