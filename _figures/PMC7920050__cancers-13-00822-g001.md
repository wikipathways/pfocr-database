caption: Biogenesis of exosomes. (A) Endocytosis begins at the cytoplasmic membrane.
  Early endosomes (EEs) form by the fusion of uncoated endocytic vesicles. EEs either
  return to the plasma membrane (recycling endosome) or convert into late endosomes/multivesicular
  bodies (LEs/MVBs). Protein sorting of ILVs (intraluminal vesicles) occurs through
  endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) dependent or independent
  mechanism. ESCRT 0, ESCRT I, ESCRT II, ESCRT III are four components of ESCRT machinery
  that ubiquitinate the substrates on the part of the inward budding endosomal membrane.
  ILVs are ready to be degraded by lysosome or rescued by de-ubiquitinating enzymes
  (DUBs) through Rab GTPases (Rab27A and Rab27B) which allow the MVBs to move to the
  cell periphery. Finally MVBs through the SNARE complex fuse with the plasma membrane
  and lead to exocytosis (release of ILVs as exosomes to the extracellular space).  Extracellular
  protein;  Receptor;  Lipid;  RNA. (B) Ectosomes derive from the plasma membrane
  by direct gemmation. Large oncosomes, as microvesicles originate from plasma membrane
  []. Exosomes are derived and secreted through a “classical” pathway. ER = endoplasmic
  reticulum.  Microvesicle;  Apoptotic bodies;  Exosome;  Exomere;  Oncosome.
