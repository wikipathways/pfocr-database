caption: Simplified model of signaling pathway governing basal thermotolerance in
  plants. Important pathways involving heat shock proteins (HSPs), reactive oxygen
  species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes (such as ascorbate peroxidases (APXs)), hormones,
  and multiprotein bridging factor 1c (MBF1c) might be modulated by a feedback loop
  of Ca2+, ROS, and nitric oxide (NO). Rectangles indicate proteins; ellipses indicate
  other signaling molecules, e.g., Ca2+ ions, hormones, ROS, and NO; black arrows
  indicate positive regulation; T-shaped lines indicate negative regulation; blue
  dotted arrows indicate activation of gene expression; yellow circle indicates nucleus.
  Heat stimuli and key signaling molecules (Ca2+, ROS and NO) are indicated in red
  characters. Names of cellular components are indicated in underlined characters.
  The pathways that can be hypothesized but not clearly evidenced in previous studies
  are marked with “?”.
