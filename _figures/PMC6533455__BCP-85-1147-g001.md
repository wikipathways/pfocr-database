caption: Schematic representation of Wnt signalling pathway components reported to
  be mutated in disorders of bone development and skeletal homeostasis. Activation
  of the canonical Wnt pathway increases bone mass, and this is mediated by the binding
  of extracellular Wnt ligands (dark green) to a transmembrane receptor complex comprising
  the Wnt co‐receptor LRP5 or LRP6 (LRP5/6, light blue) and a member of the frizzled
  (FZD) family (dark blue). In contrast, inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway decreases
  bone mass , . This inhibition is mediated by extracellular factors such as sclerostin
  (SOST, orange) and Dickkopf‐related protein 1 (DKK1, yellow), which bind to the
  LRP5/6 co‐receptor thereby preventing activation by Wnt ligands, as well as recruiting
  inhibitory transmembrane proteins such as LRP4, which is a SOST‐interacting protein
  (light green), and the Kremen proteins (pink), which are high‐affinity DKK1 receptors
  that functionally cooperate with DKK1 to decrease Wnt signalling . Secreted‐frizzled‐related
  proteins (SFRPs, purple) also inhibit the canonical Wnt pathway by sequestering
  Wnt ligands. The importance of the canonical Wnt pathway for the regulation of bone
  mass has been highlighted by loss‐of‐function mutations affecting SOST and LRP4,
  and by gain‐of‐function mutations of LRP5 and LRP6, which lead to the disorder called
  high bone mass , , , ; and also by loss‐of‐function mutations of LRP5 and the Wnt1
  ligand, which lead to monogenic osteoporosis disorders ,
