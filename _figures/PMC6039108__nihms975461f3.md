caption: 'Double stranded break (DSB) is induced by a targeted nuclease (represented
  by scissors). DSB ends may or may not be resected (dashed or solid line, respectively),.
  The ultimate gene editing outcome (light blue boxes on the bottom) depends on several
  factors: the type of donor template provided (yellow box), the phase of cell cycle
  (light green box) and the presumed DNA repair proteins available (pink box). Gray
  boxes indicate the names of the repair mechanisms. It should be noted that the figure
  illustrates the common pathways described to date, however modification of DNA repair
  pathways and their utilization for gene editing purposes is an area of active research.
  (From left to right). A DSB with no end resection and no donor available is likely
  to result in insertions and deletions (indels) and lead to gene disruption via the
  non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. NHEJ may occur in any phase of cell cycle.
  Exogenously providing a double-stranded donor (dsDonor), which contains nuclease
  cut sites (scissors) around the gene of interest (green rectangle), may result in
  homology-independent targeted integration (HITI). The presence of microhomology
  on opposite strands of DNA around the cut site may result in gene disruption via
  the microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway. A recently reported method
  of gene integration, termed precise integration into target chromosome (PITCh),
  utilizes MMEJ machinery to integrate a gene of interest, which is provided by dsDonor
  with short homology arms (HA) to the DNA (HA are highlighted in orange and blue).
  The three pathways on the right are generally only active in S/G2 phases of cell
  cycle and may be used to correct a single nucleotide mutation in the DNA (represented
  by a red line). Exogenously providing a dsDonor with long homology arms may lead
  to either gene integration or gene correction via homologous recombination (HR)
  mechanism, depending on the length of the donor template. A new type of repair mechanism
  for gene correction was recently described, termed single stranded template repair
  (SSTR). Although resulting in the same outcome as HR-mediated gene correction, SSTR
  is presumed to utilize the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway and be RAD-51 independent.'
