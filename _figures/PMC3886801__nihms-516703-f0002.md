caption: Members of the IL-6 cytokine family bind to a common receptor subunit, gp130,
  which either homo-or hetero-dimerizes upon ligand binding. JAK proteins are auto-
  and trans-phosphorylated and phosphorylate one of four tyrosine residues on the
  intracellular portion of the gp130 subunit. JAK protein activation results in downstream
  signal transduction through both the MAPK and STAT-3 pathways. Receptor interactions
  with the adaptor proteins SHC and Grb2 activate the MEK-ERK pathway. Alternatively,
  STAT-3 monomers are recruited to the receptor, become tyrosine phosphorylated and
  dimerize through their SH2 domains. STAT-3 dimers translocate to the nucleus and
  bind to consensus sequences in the promoters of genes including VEGF, MMP-9, IL-6,
  and SOCS-3.
