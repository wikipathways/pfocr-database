caption: The Hippo/YAP pathway is physiologically initiated via GPCRs. The Hippo pathway
  takes place following the phosphorylation of Ltats1/2 by Mst1/2 which leads to the
  phosphorylation of YAP and its anchoring localization in the cytoplasmic compartment.
  YAP is activated by inhibition of the Hippo pathway via the de-phosphorylation of
  YAP, resulting in YAP nuclear localization and its function as a co-transcription
  factor.
