caption: Clavata pathway model. The receptor-like kinase protein, CLV1, and the receptor-like
  protein, CLV2, are localized to the plasma membrane. The putative ligand, CLV3 is
  produced as a propeptide and then cleaved to release the mature signaling molecule.
  Upon activation, the CLV1/2 complex blocks the activity of the PP2C proteins, POL
  and PLL1 via an unknown mechanism. When CLV3 is not present, POL and PLL1 are active
  and through unidentified signaling intermediates upregulate the homeodomain transcription
  factor, WUS, which is required for the maintenance and specification of the stem
  cells.
