caption: Schematic of the C4cycle. Black arrows show the main reactions enabling the
  fixation of atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds in mesophyll cells until its
  release in bundle sheath cells, where it feeds the photosynthetic carbon reduction
  (PCR) cycle. Dashed arrows show the reactions allowing the regeneration of the carbon
  acceptors. Boxes indicate the enzymes. Those that were recruited in parallel across
  the three C4 origins are in red. Note that PCK is encoded by only a single gene
  lineage, which was recruited across two C4 origins. A more detailed schematic of
  the C4pathway is shown in supplementary figure S1, Supplementary Material online.
