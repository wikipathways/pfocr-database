caption: Mechanisms by which AEG-1 induces MASH. By using LXXLL motif, AEG-1 binds
  to RXR, thereby inhibiting PPARA and decreasing fatty acid β-oxidation. AEG-1 binds
  to mRNAs encoding lipogenic enzymes, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN), and increases
  their translation, resulting in increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Together, these
  events lead to steatosis. Multiple mechanisms activate NF-κB signaling pathway by
  AEG-1. AEG-1 binds to p65 subunit of NF-κB and functions as a bridge between NF-κB
  and basal transcription machinery. AEG-1 is phosphorylated by IKKβ facilitating
  nuclear translocation of NF-κB. AEG-1 interacts with upstream ubiquitinated molecules
  of NF-κB pathway, such as TRAF2 and RIP1. Activation of NF-κB leads to increased
  inflammation. Figure created in BioRender (https://www.biorender.com/)
