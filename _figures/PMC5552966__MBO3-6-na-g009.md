caption: A general diagram of Cu‐responsive paths in the cells of filamentous fungi
  at the proteome level. This diagram depicts the paths and components that respond
  to Cu stress and indicates how the fungi change their proteomes to address changes
  in Cu concentration. The details have been described in the Discussion. The broken
  lines with arrows suggest the Cu stress signaling paths and involved components.
