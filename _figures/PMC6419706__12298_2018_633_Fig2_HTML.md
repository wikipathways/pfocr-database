caption: Role of chitosan mediated responses in stomata closing mechanism via ABA
  biosynthesis at cellular level. The signaling induced by chitosan involves hydrogen
  peroxide via octadecanoid pathway and nitric oxide. Hydrogen peroxide induces both
  the ABA synthesis and ROS scavenging mechanism while nitric oxide regulates phosphatidic
  acid (PA) via phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglyceral kinase (DGK) (PLC/DGK) pathway,
  and initiates ABA synthesis leading to closure of stomata and activates biotic and
  abiotic stress responsive genes (Pichyangkura and Chadchawan )
