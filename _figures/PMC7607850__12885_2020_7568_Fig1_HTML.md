caption: ZA inhibits the RANKL/RANK pathway. The RANKL is thought to bind with RANK,
  and their complex recruits TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAF6), activates phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mTOR pathway and subsequently nuclear factor
  kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, as well as nuclear factor of activation of T cells-1 (NFATc1),
  JNK, Erk and p38MAPK. ZA decreases the expression of RANKL to inhibit osteoclastogenesis,
  in addition, it is reported that ZA also inhibits NFATc1, suppresses NF-κB pathway,
  as well as inhibiting the phosphorylation of the nuclear translocation of p65, besides,
  ZA also inhibits non-canonical Wnt signaling through decreasing the signaling protein
  levels of Wnt5a, CaMKII, and the Ca2+ levels, and finally inhibits osteoclasts survival,
  proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis
