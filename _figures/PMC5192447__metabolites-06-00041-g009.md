caption: Key results of metabolic alterations and deduced pathways involved during
  infection. The summary graphic shows metabolic differences between control cells
  and cells after exposure to S. aureus measured at indicated time points. Names of
  metabolites are written in regular font, metabolic pathways in bold font and cellular
  processes in italic font. Green coloured labels indicate increased concentrations
  or higher activity and red labels indicate decreased concentrations or reduced activity.
  The pentose-phosphate pathway (PP-pathway) is coloured blue to indicate a changed
  flux of carbon during infection, which was only detectable when azaserine is present.
