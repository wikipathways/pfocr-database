caption: Hypoxia regulates intracellular signaling through multiple mechanisms. Under
  hypoxic conditions, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) stabilizes in the
  cytoplasm, dimerizing with HIF-1β to form HIF-1, which translocates to the nucleus,
  binding to hypoxia response elements (HREs) to promote the transcription of downstream
  genes, such as CTGF, EPO, and VEGF that regulate the process of tumor cells. CTGF
  can interact with ROS generated in the hypoxic environment via TGF-β pathway, MAPK
  pathway, and AKT signaling, ultimately affecting the upstream molecules of the Hippo
  signaling pathway and modulating YAP/TAZ function. Created with BioRender.com
