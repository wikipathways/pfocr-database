caption: Data in the current manuscript are consistent with normal interaction of
  IFN-α and IFN-β with the heterodimeric IFN receptor at the cell surface. However,
  activation of signal transduction appears to be reduced by HTLV Gag, particularly
  through effects on TYK2 and STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, ISRE-stimulated
  gene expression through ISGF3, complexes of STAT1 and/or STAT2 proteins with IRF9
  are generally reduced, whereas GAF-stimulated gene expression of IRF1 is largely
  unaffected by HTLV-1.
