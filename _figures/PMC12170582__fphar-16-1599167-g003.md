caption: This figure reveals important factors in anti-inflammatory signaling pathway
  of Rut in the CNS microenvironment. Rut regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory
  factors such as IL-1β, COX2, iNOS and TNF-α by acting on signaling pathways such
  as TLR4/NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome. Rut can also promote the clearance of A β
  peptide, maintain the stability of β-catenin, and protect the tight junctions between
  cells from damage. In microglia, Rut may alleviate inflammatory response and promote
  tissue repair by regulating its polarization state (M1 to M2 transition)
