caption: 12/15Lipoxygenase (12/15LO) modulates Aβ production through the β-secretase
  by acting on the transcription factor Sp1. 12/15LO also modulates tau phosphorylation
  by acting on cdk5 and SAPK/JNK. As an end result, overexpression of 12/15 LO protein
  exacerbates the Alzheimer’ disease (AD) phenotype, while its knockout of pharmacological
  inhibition ameliorates synaptic dysfunction, memory impairments and cognitive decline
  in mouse models of the disease. Direct modulation of 12/15LO by PD146176 has demonstrated
  success in mitigating its effects on the AD phenotype.
