caption: The molecular network of differentially expressed proteins in CAVD generated
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Core Analysis-based
  network displays interactions between proteins that were differentially expressed
  in stenotic valves as compared to control valves. Up- and down-regulated proteins
  are in red and green, respectively. Molecules not marked with a color were not altered
  in the data set but they are possible connections suggested by IPA. Molecules are
  represented with various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene
  product. A solid line represents direct interactions and a dashed line represents
  an indirect interaction. The full names of the molecules are given in Table
