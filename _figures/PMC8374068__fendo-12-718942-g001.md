caption: Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex 1. In this schematic, metformin
  is transported into the cell via the organic cation transporters, OCT 1, 2 and 3
  and the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT). The transport of metformin
  out of the cell is mediated through the multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE1/2)
  transporters. Metformin is thought to mediate most of its cellular effects via activation
  of AMPK and, in this schematic, metformin inhibits the electron transport chain
  of mitochondrial complex 1, which leads to a reduction in ATP levels, increasing
  the AMP/ATP ratio, thus increasing AMPK activation and also reduces the generation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS). AMPK activation leads to an inhibition of the
  mTOR pathway, which would contribute to the antitumor effects of metformin. Metformin
  also has been shown to activate AMPK via the serine-threonine liver kinase B1 (LKB1)
  where phosphorylation (p) (activation) of AMPK occurs. The protein product of SIRT1,
  sirtuin1, is an upstream deacetylase, which activates LKB1 via deacetylation as
  indicated in the figure by loss of ac, at times of cellular stress and decreased
  cellular energy, when NAD+/NADH ratio is high and is also a putative site of action
  for metformin.
