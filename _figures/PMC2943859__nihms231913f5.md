caption: Death receptor signaling and its interdigitation with the mitochondrial pathway
  of apoptosis. Ligation of a death receptor by its ligand results in the recruitment
  of pro-caspases 8 and 10 to a receptor complex via homotypic interactions with FADD
  (or the other adaptor protein TRADD). Within this complex, caspases 8 and 10 undergo
  auto-activation. Active caspase 8/10 can directly activate caspase 3, an executioner
  caspase (type I cells), or cleave Bid, a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family, to
  generate truncated Bid (tBid) which in turn induces mitochondrial dysfunction (type
  II cells). X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) determines which pathway results
  in cell death. In hepatocytes, activation of the mitochondrial pathway is necessary
  to overcome resistance by XIAP.
