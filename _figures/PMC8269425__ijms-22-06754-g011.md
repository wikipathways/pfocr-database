caption: Mechanisms for “bypass Sec14”. Loss-of-function mutations in specific non-essential
  genes restores cell viability in the face of functional ablation of the normally
  essential Sec14. These “bypass Sec14” mutations affect the individual metabolism
  of both phospholipid binding ligands of Sec14. The affected pathways are shown in
  simplified form. Mutations that affect PtdCho metabolism specifically inactivate
  the CDP-choline pathway for PtdCho biosynthesis, the enzymes of which are highlighted
  in red. Interestingly, ablation of the de novo phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn)
  methylation pathway for PtdCho biosynthesis, even under conditions where this pathway
  is the sole pathway for net production of PtdCho, has no effect on the cellular
  requirement for Sec14 function. Loss-of-function mutations that impact inositol
  phospholipid metabolism do so via inactivation of antagonists of PtdIns(4)P signaling.
  These include mutations that functionally ablate the Sac1 PtdIns(4)P phosphatase
  Sac1 and or the PtdIns(4)phosphate/sterol exchange protein Kes1/Osh4—also highlighted
  in red.
