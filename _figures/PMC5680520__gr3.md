caption: Flavonoid antioxidants possess several distinct of cellular neuroprotection.
  Flavonoids reduced the amount of inflammation and oxidative stress in the cellular
  environment through multiple means. Flavonoid compounds directly scavenge free radicals
  and ROS, increase intracellular concentration of GSH and antioxidant molecules,
  modulate NF-κB signaling pathways to reduce apoptosis, and reduce glutamate mediated
  Ca+2 intracellular influx. These actions of flavonoids directly enhance the glyoxalase
  pathway.
