  Red represents overexpressed genes targeted by downregulated miRNAs, and green represents
  repressed genes targeted by upregulated miRNAs. Orange and pea green represent genes
  targeted by both downregulated and upregulated miRNAs, although the former was primarily
  overexpressed and the latter was repressed. miR, microRNA; T2DM, type 2 diabetes
