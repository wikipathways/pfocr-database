caption: Schematic representation of regulation of the mexXY operon in P. aeruginosa.
  (A) Wild-type strain grown in drug-free medium. During bacterial growth, a translation
  attenuation mechanism involving a small peptide, PA5471.1, prevents transcription
  of PA5471, a downstream gene of unknown function whose product directly or indirectly
  modulates the activity of MexZ, the local repressor of the mexXY operon. (B) Growth
  of wild-type strain in the presence of MexXY-inducing antibiotics. Following bacterial
  exposure to ribosome-targeting antimicrobials, MexXY is produced at high levels
  conferring intrinsic resistance to the inducer, provided that it is a good substrate
  for the efflux pump (as is the case for aminoglycosides but not for chloramphenicol).
  This MexZ-dependent induction process is linked in part to increased levels of the
  PA5471 protein modulating MexZ repressor activity. A second pathway leading to drug-dependent
  overexpression of mexXY is independent of both the MexZ and PA5471 proteins. Our
  results demonstrate that polycationic antibiotics (colistin and polymyxin B) are
  able to promote expression of the pmrAB, arnBCDTEF-ugd, and mexXY operons and to
  coordinately downregulate the oprD gene through the activation of ParRS. This regulation
  results in multidrug resistance.
