caption: Model summarizes the possible pathways of intracellular calcium dynamics
  after stimulus. The activation of receptor/channel leads to release of calcium from
  the ER-like structures into the cytosol. Second messengers such as Ins(1,4,5)P3
  helps in the release of the internal Ca2+ pool in the cytosol. CaBPs, calpain-like
  protein, Ca2+-nucleotidase, CaM kinases, and other proteins modulates these Ca2+
  signals into cellular response. Later on, Ca2+ is sequestered back into the internal
  sources by Ca2+-ATPase pumps such as SERCA and PMCA, which are located on the membrane
  of ER-like structures and in vacuoles, respectively. CCXs and SPCAs are other pumps
  localized on the vesicles of many organisms. Dotted arrows (in red) show the speculated
  Ca2+ ion flow. Because of the lack of evidence, it is difficult to speculate on
  the localization of different pumps on the vesicles, and the schematic diagram has
  been simplified for clarity. CaBP, Ca2+-binding protein; CaM kinases, Ca2+ modulated
  protein kinases; CCX, Ca2+/cation exchanger; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Ins(1,4,5)P3,
  inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; SER, smooth endoplasmic
  reticulum; SERCA, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase; SPCA, secretory pathway calcium
  ATPase.
