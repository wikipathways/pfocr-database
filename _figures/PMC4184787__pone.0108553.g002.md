caption: (A–H). Heat maps show mean expression in neutrophils from blood (BL), synovial
  fluid (SF), or peritonitis induced by uric acid (UA) or thioglycollate (TG). Mean
  expression across all four conditions was placed at the center of the gradient (white)
  for each gene. Red indicates increased expression, and blue indicates decreased
  expression. The full color gradient for each gene represents an 8-fold difference
  in expression. Lists of genes of interest were compiled using the KEGG and Ingenuity
  databases as well as literature reviews; only genes showing at least 2-fold differences
  in expression comparing conditions and with Q<0.05 by ANOVA are shown. In the pathway
  diagrams, up-regulated genes are shown in red, and down-regulated genes are shown
  in green. A. Uptake and metabolism of lipoproteins. B. Nr4a-family transcription
  factors. C. Glutathione metabolism. D. Synthesis of and response to leukotrienes
  and prostaglandins. E. Antigen processing and presentation via MHC class II. F.
  Genes related to apoptosis. G. NFκB subunits and proximal regulators of NFκB. H.
  Genes related to signaling by innate immune receptors for microbial products. I.
  Expression of H3 histone genes (Hist1h3a, b, c, d, e, g, h, I, and Hist2h3b and
  3c1) in neutrophil populations. Mean ± SD of these 10 genes (black) declined after
  release from bone marrow (BM) to blood (BL) and further after activation (SF, UA,
  TG). Mean ± SD among 198 non-neutrophil populations is shown for comparison. Although
  it is not apparent from this plot, the lowest expression among non-neutrophils exceeded
  the highest expression in UA or TG neutrophils. Expression of genes for the “replacement”
  H3 histones, shown in red and blue, was maintained after neutrophil maturation and
  activation, at levels similar to non-neutrophils.
