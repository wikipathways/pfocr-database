caption: 'Caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis pathways utilized by cytotoxic
  T-cells (CTLs) and NK-cells and mechanisms of bone marrow microenvironment-mediated
  immune resistance. Apoptosis, the programmed cell death that is a consequence of
  DNA damage in the nucleus, occurs through caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
  Cytotoxic immune cells such as CTLs and NK-cells (not depicted) utilize both mechanisms
  to kill cancer cells. The most important elements of both caspase-dependent and
  -independent pathways are depicted with green backgrounds. The molecules depicted
  with red backgrounds are the negative regulators of these pathways. Green arrows
  depict the activation, red arrows depict the inhibition/inactivation of the indicated
  molecules/processes. In caspase-dependent apoptosis, the DNA-fragmentation is executed
  by caspase-3 and -7, which are activated through two main pathways: i) the Extrinsic
  Pathway that is initiated by triggering of death-cell receptors and is mediated
  by caspase-8, and ii) the Intrinsic pathway that involves mitochondrial destabilization
  and is initiated by activation of BIM/BID by caspase-8 and granzyme-B. CTLs and
  NK-cells mediate the caspase-independent apoptosis mainly by granzyme-A, which causes
  the release of ROS through activation of the mitochondrial Complex I Protein Ndufs3.
  In this pathway, the enzyme NM23-H1 ultimately causes single stranded DNA damage
  by making DNA nicks. The indicated soluble factors produced by MSCs and osteoclasts,
  but mainly the stroma-MM cell interactions via integrins and NOTCH can significantly
  upregulate the negative regulators of apoptosis via the activation of the indicated
  survival/proliferation pathways. The final result of these interactions between
  MM- and accessory-cells is the development of resistance against the cytotoxic machinery
  of immune killer cells, in a similar fashion how drug resistance is induced.'
