caption: Regulatory signaling pathways in MDSC development and functions. Several
  signaling pathways are involved in the expansion of MDSCs. JAK2/STAT3 signaling
  enhances the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs by activating S100A8/9/NOX2 and
  iNOS to promote the generation of ROS. The pathway also protects MDSCs from apoptosis
  by expressing Bcl-XL, cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Moreover, this pathway promotes the activation
  of C/EBPβ. In addition, JAK1/STAT1 signaling accelerates the expansion of MDSCs
  by inducing the expression of ARG1, iNOS and TGFβ. Similarly, the proliferation
  of MDSCs can be accelerated by increased production of PGE2 through JAK2/STAT5 signaling.
  Furthermore, the TLR family also regulates the activation of MDSCs by activating
  NK-κB to generate protumor cytokines. CHOP is activated by ER stress and is involved
  in the activation of MDSCs. Additionally, TNFα-TNFR2 signaling is crucial to MDSC
  expansion by c-FLIP upregulation and caspase 8 reduction. JAK, Janus activated kinase;
  STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; ARG1, arginase 1; TLR, toll-like
