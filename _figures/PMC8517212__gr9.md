caption: 'The putative role of RD3 in preventing two different types of rapid photoreceptor
  degeneration.A, in normal photoreceptors, RD3 plays a dual role: (i) it facilitates
  RetGC delivery to the outer segment and (ii) protects the cells against aberrant
  activation of guanylyl cyclase in the inner segment until the enzyme reaches its
  destination in the outer segment, where GCAPs displace RD3 and control RetGC activity
  via Ca2+ feedback. B, in RD3-deficient photoreceptors such as in rd3 mice and LCA12
  patients, the RetGC content sharply declines and the production of cGMP in the outer
  segment becomes insufficient to maintain the normal inward current through CNG channels,
  which reduces responses to light and possibly provokes a slow component of the degenerative
  process. The remaining RetGC is no longer protected against aberrant activation
  by GCAPs, and such activation causes rapid degeneration of the RD3-deficient photoreceptors.
  C, in photoreceptors expressing GUCY2D dominant gain-of-function mutations (RetGC1∗),
  such as CORD6-linked mutation R838S, the higher affinity of the RetGC1∗ for GCAP
  causes a “phototransduction disease” by deregulating the suppression of the RetGC1∗
  activity by Ca2+ in the outer segment, which in turn causes excessive cGMP production
  and abnormal elevation of Ca2+ influx in the dark, promoting the apoptotic process.
  The increased affinity of RetGC1∗ for GCAP also hinders RetGC1∗ silencing by RD3.
  The aberrant stimulation of the cyclase, possibly in the inner segment, activates
  the secondary pathway of degeneration, similarly to that in RD3-deficient photoreceptors.
  D, the increase of RD3 levels by overexpressing RD3GFP enables RD3 to compete with
  GCAPs for RetGC1∗ more effectively and offsets the secondary, RD3-related, pathway
  of the apoptosis. Therefore, the dominant photoreceptor degeneration driven now
  only by the primary apoptotic pathway of deregulated Ca2+ feedback in R838S+ outer
  segment becomes slower. CNG, cyclic nucleotide–gated; CORD6, cone–rod dystrophy
