caption: 'General overview of disease progression. A: Virus detected by innate immune
  cells (macrophage, dendritic cell). Innate immune cells show immune response by
  secretion of major pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and TNF. GC and IL-10 are also
  activated by negative feedback system. B: Apoptotic proteins activated by GC, IL-10
  and TNF. Necrosis/apoptosis results in lymphocytopenia. ADAM-17 is activated. C:
  Two different signaling pathway of IL-6. Trans signaling (marked in red arrow) continues
  the pro-inflammatory response. Classical signaling (marked in blue arrow) facilitates
  anti-inflammatory response. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)'
