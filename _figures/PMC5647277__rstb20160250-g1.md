caption: Current view of the mechanisms responsible for activation and modulation
  of the reproductive axis in birds and mammals. Changes in photoperiod or the circannual
  clock activate the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis via the EYA3-TSH-Dio-T3 pathway.
  In mammals, this occurs via the melatonin signal whereas deep brain photoreceptors
  (DBP) also play a role in birds. Metabolic state influences timing via effects of
  glucocorticoids (GCs), leptin and ghrelin on the RF-amides kisspeptin (KISS), and
  GnIH; reproductive inhibition in response to these signals is also probably occurring
  at the level of the gonads. Dashed black arrows from T3 indicate multiple pathways
  that may vary across taxa. The KISS signalling pathway, for example, appears to
  be non-functional in birds. Ambient temperature is also hypothesized to influence
  timing via transient receptor potential (TRP) thermoreceptors. Solid coloured arrows
  indicate effects of physical cues (photoperiod—orange; temperature—red) or metabolic
  cues (blue) on hormones/neurons that in turn influence the reproductive axis (via
  connections shown in dashed lines). GnRH-II (not shown) also appears to have a neuromodulatory
  role in affecting feeding and reproduction.
