caption: Angiopoietin-1 regulates endothelial cell gene expression via FKHR. Ang-1,
  via activation of the Akt pathway, inhibits FKHR-dependent changes in the expression
  of genes that regulate vascular remodeling and endothelial cell apoptosis. The induction
  of Ang-2 expression by FKHR (or by other signals) might initiate a positive feedback
  loop in which Ang-2, by blocking Ang-1/Akt signaling, induces further increases
  in its own expression and in the expression of genes like semaphorin 3C and slit2,
  which may directly promote vessel destabilization and remodeling.
