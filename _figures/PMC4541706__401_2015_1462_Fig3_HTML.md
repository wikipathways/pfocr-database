caption: The adaptive and maladaptive PERK pathway in neurodegenerative disease. In
  several neurodegenerative diseases, the PERK pathway is activated. The adaptive
  PERK pathway (left) functions to restore ER proteostasis. In contrast, in pathology
  (right) prolonged activation in neurodegenerative disease leads to loss of regulatory
  feedback and turns the adaptive UPR maladaptive, leading to accumulation of aberrant
  Aβ en tau proteins and loss of synaptic proteins. It may be beneficial to stimulate
  the PERK pathway (e.g., by Sephin1) in the adaptive state, however, this may worsen
  the situation in the pathological state. Inhibition (e.g., by GSK2606414 or ISRIB)
  rather than stimulation of the pathway may therefore be beneficial for neurodegenerative
  diseases associated with persistent UPR activation. See text for further details
