caption: Metabolic pathways enriched by DEGs between the EPG and PPG. A Enriched metabolic
  pathways involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis, vitamin metabolism,
  VFA metabolism, and methane metabolism in the rumen microbiome. B Enriched metabolic
  pathways involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis, N-glycan biosynthesis,
  and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis shared by the rumen and meconium microbiome
