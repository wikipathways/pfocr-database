caption: Hippo signalling pathway. Left, cells grow in low density; the Hippo signalling
  pathway is closed. YAP/TAZ enter nucleus to promote expression of EMP1, TFRC and
  ACSL4, thus cells are sensitive to ferroptosis. Right, cells grow in high density;
  the Hippo signalling pathway is activated. Phosphorylated YAP/TAZ is impeded in
  cytoplasm, thus cannot promote the expression of EMP1, TFRC and ACSL4 and cells
  exhibited resistance to ferroptosis
