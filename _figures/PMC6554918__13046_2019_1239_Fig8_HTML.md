caption: The molecular mechanism involved in lncRNA DLX6-AS1 affecting LCSCs by regulating
  STAT3 signaling pathway through affecting CADM1 promoter methylation. Down-regulation
  of lncRNA DLX6-AS1 inhibited CADM1 promoter methylation, increased CADM1 expression,
  and suppressed the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway, and finally the expression
  of CD133 and CD13 in LCSCs were decreased and the progression of LCSCs was repressed.
