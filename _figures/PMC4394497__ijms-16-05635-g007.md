caption: The hypothetical model for shifting β2-AR signaling from the canonical pathway
  towards the non-canonical pathway in immune cells is illustrated. We propose that
  signal transduction switching towards β-arrestin-mediated signaling occurs under
  conditions of unchecked immune cell activation or chronic or severe stress, both
  of which increase the firing rates of sympathetic nerves (red lightning bolts) and
  elevates local NE concentrations. These conditions favor the phosphorylation of
  the receptor by GRK 5/6 rather than GRK 2, thus promoting β-arrestin-2-mediated
  signaling via the MAPK, ERK1/2.
