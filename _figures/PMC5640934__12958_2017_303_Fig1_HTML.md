caption: Schematic illustration of TGFβ superfamily signaling and its involvement
  in decidualization. a A diagram of TGFβ superfamily signaling. TGFβ superfamily
  ligands (e.g., TGFβs, activins, and BMPs) induce the formation of membrane-associated
  receptor complexes comprising type 1 and type 2 receptors. Activated receptor machinery
  phosphorylates SMAD proteins (i.e., SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/9), which cooperate with
  SMAD4 to function in a canonical pathway. The non-canonical pathways generally include,
  but are not limited to, ERK1/2, JNK, P38, and PI3K/AKT, the activation of which
  is SMAD-independent. b TGFβ signaling components and uterine decidualization. Experimental
  evidence, particularly those from genetically modified mouse models, has revealed
  critical functions of various TGFβ signaling elements in the process of uterine
  decidualization. Disruption of BMP2, ACVR1, BMPR1A, BMPR2, SMAD1/5/4, SMAD3, or
  FST leads to defects in uterine decidualization. In contrast, LEFTY seems to be
  a suppressor of uterine decidualization. Further clarification of the function of
  TGFβ superfamily ligands (e.g., TGFβs and activins) and the usage of type 1 and
  type 2 receptors by different signaling molecules is warranted. Studies are also
  needed to assess the role of the non-canonical TGFβ signaling branch in decidualization
  and potential interactions between TGFβ superfamily signaling and epigenetic modifications
  and microRNAs in this key remodeling event. As decidualization is a highly orchestrated
  process regulated by hormonal, cellular, and molecular mechanisms, this diagram
  focuses on highlighting molecules associated with the TGFβ signaling pathway
