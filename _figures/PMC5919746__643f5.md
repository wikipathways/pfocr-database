caption: The calcineurin-Crz1 pathway and Had1 control growth at high temperature,
  stress response, and virulence via parallel pathways. The calcineurin signaling
  network acts via Crz1 to control Cryptococcus thermotolerance, cell-wall integrity,
  and virulence. Had1 also contributes to these functions in a pathway parallel to
  Crz1, and possibly regulated by calcineurin. Dotted line arrow and question mark
  denote a pathway step as yet not well defined, as it remains to be determined whether
  Had1 is an authentic calcineurin target.
