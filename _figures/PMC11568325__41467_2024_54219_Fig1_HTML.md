caption: a Under physiological conditions, mature PG is processed into GlcNAc-1,6-anhydroMurNAc
  peptides (primarily tetrapeptides) that are transported across the bacterial inner
  membrane to the cytosol by AmpG for recycling. An intermediate in this normal PG
  biosynthetic pathway, UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, binds to AmpR, which represses production
  of the class C β-lactamase AmpC. However, in the presence of β-lactams, inhibition
  of PBPs leads to an accumulation of hydrolyzed PG pentapeptide fragments, which
  are transported to the cytosol by AmpG, converted to 1,6-anhydroMurNAc-pentapeptides
  by NagZ, bind AmpR and induce expression of ampC. Secreted AmpC hydrolyzes β-lactams,
  providing antibiotic resistance10. b Chemically synthesized GlcNAc-1,6-anhydroMurNAc
