caption: Representative pathway showing the biosynthetic events of benzylisoquinoline
  alkaloids (BIAs) in Papaver somniferum. Genes responsible for (S)-reticuline biosynthesis
  from L-tyrosine are loosely clustered in the poppy genome. (S)-reticuline is converted
  to noscapine by a set of enzymes; berberine bridge enzyme (BBE), P. somniferum methyltransferase
  1 (PSMT1), Tetrahydroprotoberberine N-methyltransferase (TNMT), P. somniferum acyltransferase
  1 (PSAT1), PSMT2&3, P. somniferum carboxylesterase 3 (PSCXE3), and P. somniferum
  shortchain dehydrogenase 1 (PSSDR1). BBE and TNMT genes are not present in the noscapine
  gene cluster due to their additional function in sanguinarine biosynthesis. Thebaine-producing
  genes are clustered and occur adjacent to the noscapine gene cluster. Thebaine biosynthesis
  is initiated from (R)-reticuline. (S)-reticuline is converted to (R)-reticuline
  by (S)- to (R)-reticuline (STORR) enzyme. The formation of thebaine occurs through
  the activity of salutaridine synthase (SALSYN), salutaridine reductase (SALR), salutaridinol-7-O-acetyl
  transferase (SALAT), and thebaine synthase (THS). Genes involved in morphine biosynthesis
  are not clustered. Thebaine is converted to codeine by two subsequent steps catalyzed
  by thebaine 6-O-demethylase (T6ODM), and codeinone reductase (COR). Finally, codeine
  is converted to morphine by Codeine3-O-demethylase (CODM). Genes of plant metabolic
  gene cluster encoding enzymatic reactions are indicated in red arrows. Dotted arrows
  represent a multi-step pathway.
