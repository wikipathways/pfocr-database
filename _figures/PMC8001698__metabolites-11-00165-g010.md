caption: Pathways flagged from metabolomics analysis using MetaboAnalyst software.
  Signatory metabolites involved in each pathway are illustrated in the form of a
  pie chart according to their relative intensities and presence across the different
  cultivars. (A) Phenylpropanoid pathway, (B) flavonoid pathway overlapping with the
  phenylpropanoid pathway (*) and (C) linoleic acid pathway that showed the highest
  impact after pathway enrichment analysis. Some limitations in MetaboAnalyst prevented
  the mapping of all annotated metabolites (). The respective metabolite codes (e.g.,
  C00079-Phenylalanine) indicate KEGG unique identifiers.
