caption: Proposed model for persistent fibrosis in mice after lung injury. NOX4-derived
  ROS facilitates TGFβ-mediated fibrosis by inducing differentiation of fibroblasts
  into myofibroblasts and by synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. Our studies
  indicate that NOX4 increases HAS2 expression, and LMWHA enhances NOX4/ROS activity,
  which provides evidence for a positive-feedback loop between HA and NOX4 activation.
  ROS then induces cell invasion through the Akt → MMP pathway. Our study also provides
  evidence that in response to lung injury, CD44V6 induces NOX4 through regulation
  of TGFβ1/SMAD3 signaling in myofibroblasts, and NOX4 also regulates HAS2 production
  as well as AP-1-mediated CD44V6 expression. This suggests that the CD44v6 variant
  and HA are up-regulated by TGFβ1/SMAD3 signaling through a feedback loop requiring
  the presence of NOX4. These studies thus show the involvement of CD44V6 in TGFβ-induced
  NOX4 expression, myofibroblast activation, and profibrotic responses.
