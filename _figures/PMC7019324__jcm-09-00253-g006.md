caption: Toll-like receptor 4 signalling. Activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
  by danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), like high mobility group box-1
  (HMGB-1), heat shock proteins (hsp) and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, leads
  to downstream signalling via the MyD88 (Myeloid differentiation primary-response
  protein 88) dependent and MyD88 independent pathway. The MyD88-dependent pathway
  in which MyD88 and TIRAP (toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain containing adaptor
  protein) or MyD88 adapter-like (Mal) recruits and activates members of the IL-1
  receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family is considered to be the dominant pathway.
  IRAK activation leads to recruitment of TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6)
  and subsequently activation of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase
  1 (TAK1). Activation of TAK1 then leads to the activation of inhibitor of nuclear
  factor-κB kinase (IKK), which results in the release of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB) from its inhibitor, promoting translocation to the
  nucleus. The MyD88 independent pathway is mediated by the adapter molecules TIR-domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)/TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) and downstream
  signalling leads to activation of 2 inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase (IKK)
  homologs IKKε and TANK-binding Kinase-1 (TBK1), which possibly form a complex together
  and activate transcription factors NF-κB and IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). From
  here, proinflammatory gene transcription is initiated. TLR4 signalling is inhibited
  by Eritoran and TJ-M2010-2.
