caption: The schematic representation of the canonical Pal/Rim pathway. Differentially
  expressed Fusarium sp. associated with KSBH genes which were identified after comparing
  the evaluated conditions (pH 5.0, pH 6.0, and pH 7.0) and which are involved in
  this signaling pathway, are represented in the figure. The left panel shows the
  expression profiles from each of these nr-unigenes. These expression profiles are
  represented as transcripts per million (TPM). This figure was modified from [].
  Please note that since transcript levels calculated for each unigenes are different,
  the Y axis at the left of the bar graphs was scaled to the values of a particular
  profile
