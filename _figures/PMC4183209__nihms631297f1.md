caption: A putative pathway from cAMP to ERK in PACAP-mediated neurite outgrowth in
  PC12 cells. Pharmacological experiments show that PACAP acting through the PAC1
  G protein–coupled receptor stimulates neurite outgrowth through a pathway that requires
  ERK but is independent of PKA. Some other aspects of PC12 cell differentiation stimulated
  by PKA are also ERK-dependent () and therefore blocked by UO126. AC, adenylate cyclase
