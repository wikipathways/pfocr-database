caption: MiRNAs regulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and EMT in CRC. In the absence
  of Wnt, β-catenin forms a complex with APC, GSK3 and Axin. The β-catenin is phosphorylated
  by GSK3β and targeted for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. This figure
  summarizes the interaction between miRNAs and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  in CRC and a subset of downstream miRNAs that are involved in the EMT process. During
  the process of EMT, the expression of mesenchymal markers, including N-cadherin
  and vimentin, is up-regulated, and the expression of the epithelial markers, including
  E-cadherin and ZO-1, is down-regulated. miR, microRNA; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition; APC, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli; TCF, T-cell factor.
