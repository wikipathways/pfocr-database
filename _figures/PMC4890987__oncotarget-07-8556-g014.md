caption: In the aging process, DDIT3, MAX, TAOK3, TRAF6, MAP2K3, MAPKAPK2, RPS6KA5,
  and FOS are involved in the MAPK signaling pathway and TRAF6, MAP2K3, MYD88, TLR9,
  and FOS are involved in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. In order to overcome
  the dysfunction caused by accumulated genetic mutations during the aging process,
  the transcription factor FOS and DDIT3 can be activated by a wide variety of stress
  signals, including the MAPK signaling and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways.
  This results in various cellular responses, including immune system activation,
  cell proliferation, metabolism, cell communication, cell transport, biological regulation,
  and response to stimulus. In this figure, the light blue blocks represent the proteins
  involved in the indicated pathways, the deep green nodes represent the TFs, the
  deep blue blocks represent the TFs target genes, the light green nodes represent
  the miRNAs, the red nodes represent DNA methylation of genes, the yellow nodes represent
  the mutation of genes, arrows represent activation of proteins, and the link represents
  interaction between these two proteins.
