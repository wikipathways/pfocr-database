caption: A hypothetical model proposing maintenance of glutathione homeostasis as
  a common effector for various interventions that support the survival of NADPH-depleted
  OPCs including physiological levels of DHEA, stimulation of GPER or activation of
  the cAMP pathway. Increased de-novo glutathione synthesis or its lower use may,
  at least temporarily, provide sufficient supply of reduced glutathione (GSH) despite
  disruption of the NDAPH-dependent reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). In this
  way, the requirement of NADPH (and the PPP) for maintenance of redox homeostasis
  can be bypassed, and OPCs may survive the metabolic stress. We propose that such
  a protective mechanism may promote white matter sparing or repair following central
  nervous system injuries that are associated with oxidative stress-mediated death
  of OLs/OPCs. At least some of these insults may directly affect NADPH supply by
  lowering activity of PPP (see the Discussion section for more details).
