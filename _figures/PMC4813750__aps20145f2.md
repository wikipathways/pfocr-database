caption: ABA biosynthesis and catabolism. The ABA biosynthetic pathway is shown in
  the left panel. ABA is derived from C40 epoxycarotenoid precursors through oxidative
  cleavage reactions that occur in the plastid. The C15 intermediate xanthoxin is
  exported into the cytosol, where it is converted to ABA through a two-step reaction
  involving an abscisic aldehyde intermediate. The ABA biosynthetic enzymes zeaxanthin
  epoxidase (ZEP), 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase
  and abscisic aldehyde oxidase (AAO3) are shown in pink. In the right panel, three
  catabolic pathways involving C-7′, C-8′, and C-9′ hydroxylation are shown. ABA is
  fully inactivated after the formation of the biologically inactive compound DPA.
