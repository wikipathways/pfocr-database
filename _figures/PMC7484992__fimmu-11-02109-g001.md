caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways activated by CXCR4. Ligand
  binding to CXCR4 activates G protein subunits and the downstream Ca2+ mobilization
  from intracellular stores and PI3K/Akt, PLC, and ERK1/2 pathways. This results in
  gene transcription, cell migration, proliferation and survival. CXCR4 oligomerization
  can also activate the G-protein independent JAK/STAT pathway. β-arrestins are recruited
  following GRK phosphorylation of CXR4 and mediate its internalization. ACKR3 is
  another receptor for CXCL12 that can induce β-arrestin-mediated signaling both by
  itself or as a heterodimer with CXCR4.
