caption: Functions of Membrane-Associated Mucins at the Human Ocular Surface.The graphic
  depicts some of the focus areas of this article.Left. Sagittal section of the eye
  and eyelids is represented, with epithelia highlighted in light pink. Goblet cells
  can be observed in the conjunctival epithelium (purple). Meibomian glands (yellow)
  can be found at the lids, with their ducts opening at the lid margin.Top right.
  Detail of the barrier functions of MAMs. Multiple MUC16 are showed protruding from
  the plasma membrane as the main elements of the glycocalyx barrier. LGALS3 (galectin-3)
  pentamers can be found interacting with mucin glycans. This barrier is responsible
  of the exclusion of different substances, such as the clinical dye rose bengal.
  Bacteria and viruses can be excluded also by shed mucins, as it is the case of MUC1,
  represented here.Mid right. Detail of the interactions of MAMs with elements of
  the cytoskeleton. MUC16 participates in the formation of membrane microplicae and
  tight junctions (represented here with the transmembrane protein occluding and ZO1
  in blue). Some of these functions have been related to their interaction with actin
  filaments.Bottom right. Detail of the immunomodulatory functions of MAMs. A question
  mark is used to indicate functions that have not been demonstrated in the eye to
  date. Inhibitory effect on Toll-like receptors (fuchsia) has been described for
  MUC1 (left) and MUC16 (right) at the ocular surface, reducing the activation of
  NF-kappaB. Previous studies showed that MUC1 acted by inhibiting recruitment of
  MyD88. Studies in airways have demonstrated that MUC1-CT interacts with the glucocorticoid
  receptor (NR3C1), facilitating its migration to the nucleus, while MUC4 (right)
  can inhibit its translocation. Finally, studies in different systems have described
  interactions between MUC1-CT and different regulatory elements of the NF-kappaB
  pathway, although the final result of these interactions is not clear.
