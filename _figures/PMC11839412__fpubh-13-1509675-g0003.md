caption: Crucial miRNAs impacting CD133 and cell cycle regulation (By Figdraw.). In
  the G1 phase, CD133 is positively correlated with miR-150, which interacts with
  CDKI to influence the cell cycle. miR-150 and miR-142-3p down-regulate CCND1 expression,
  while miR-142-3p and miR-134-3p are negatively correlated with CD133 expression.
  In addition, miR-150 down-regulates c-MYB protein levels, and miR-134-3p inhibits
  RAB27A expression. During the S phase, miR-363-3p and miR-95 regulate each other
  along with CD133. Overexpression of HIF-2α increases miR-363-3p expression, and
  miR-95 negatively regulates DUSP5. DUSP5 can activate MAPK pathway. A small amount
  of curcumin can suppress CCND1, CDK4, and CD133 expression, resulting in G2/M phase
  arrest. Moreover, CD133 inhibits miR-374a, which in turn suppresses CCND1 and CDK4
  expression. Knocking out METTL3 caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/S phase in CD133+
  cancer stem cells
