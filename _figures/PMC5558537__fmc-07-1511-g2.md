caption: 'In ER-positive breast tumors, genomic ER activity meditated by nuclear-initiated
  steroid signaling always predominates (see ), although some nongenomic signaling
  on acting ER that resides at the membrane and/or cytoplasm also occurs. This situation
  is usually upon acquisition of tamoxifen resistance or adaptation to hormone deprivation.
  Therefore, several tyrosine kinase receptors such as HER2 and EGFR as well as IGFR
  signaling become activated. Tyrosine kinase receptor-induced kinases phosphorylate
  nuclear ER and its CoA, thus promoting genomic ER activity and enhancing gene expression.
  As a result, genomic and nongenomic activities of ER and their crosstalk with growth
  factor tyrosine kinase pathways cooperative in promoting gene transcription, thus
  leading to endocrine resistance. Targeting the growth factor receptor pathway at
  different nodal points using antibodies (trastuzumab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors
  (gefitinib, erlotinib and lapatinib) or other signal transduction inhibitors (e.g., mTOR
  inhibitors and MEK inhibitors) can eliminate the molecular crosstalk and overcome
  endocrine resistance.CoA: Coactivator; ER: Estrogen receptor; ERE: Estrogen response
