caption: The minor intron splicing pathway. (A). U12-type intron sequence characteristics
  [,,,,,]. These sequences were initially described in the literature based on DNA
  nomenclature. These were changed in the figure as the transcript depicted is an
  RNA transcript. The commonly observed 3′ and 5′ sequences of minor introns are shown
  in the boxes. The conserved sequences are shown at the 5′ ss and branchpoint (B).
  Spliceosomal assembly and the splicing reaction [,,,,,] occur as a two-step reaction.
  The interaction of the preformed U11/U12 di-snRNP leads to the formation of Complex
  A. U4atac/U6atac.U5 tri-snRNP allows the formation of Complex B, which carries the
  first transesterification reaction after the release of U4atac and U11. This reaction
  leads to the formation of Complex C, which carries the second transesterification
  reaction producing ligates exons and a minor intron lariat. (C). U12-type intron-associated
  diseases classification [,,,,,,,,]. The diseases are depicted in association with
  the affected step. Diseases not shown in the figure include amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis associated with mutations in fused in sarcoma (FUS) RNA-binding protein
  [], and Noonan syndrome due to U12-type intron retention in LZTR1, a regulator of
  RAS-related GTPases [].
