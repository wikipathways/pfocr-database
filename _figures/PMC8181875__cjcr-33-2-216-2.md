caption: Mechanisms of novel strategies targeting IL-37, RER1 and RAD51 under hypoxic
  environment. 1) HIF-1α directly binds to HREs which as a result reduced IL-37 transcription
  in PC. Moreover, IL-37 can suppress HIF-1α expression through STAT3 inhibition;
  2) RER1 induces the development of PC via enhancing EMT and CSC pathway. RER1 can
  induce PC cells to convert to CSCs. Moreover, HIF-1α can increase RER1 expression,
  and hypoxia-induced PC cell progression may be activated by RER1 with the help of
  HIF-1α; 3) RAD51 positively regulated cell proliferation, decreased intracellular
  ROS production and increased the HIF-1α protein level. KRAS/MEK/ERK activation increased
  RAD51 expression; 4) PC modulate the CA9 to regulate pH. CA9 is a down-stream of
  mutant KRAS. Intra-tumoral hypoxia leads to HIF-1α-mediated metabolic regulation
  by PC and the production of acidic metabolites. Glycolysis can create an acidic
  microenvironment via lactate accumulation, resulting in extracellular matrix destruction
  that favors metastasis. IL, interleukin; RER1, retention in endoplasmic reticulum
  1; RAD51, recombination protein A D51; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; HRE, hypoxia-response
  element; PC, pancreatic cancer; CSC, cancer stem cell; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  CA 9, carbonic anhydrase 9.
