caption: Dual Effects of Autophagy on Immune Response and Alveolar Bone Metabolism
  in a Diabetic Environment. Hyperglycemia influences neutrophil and macrophage autophagy
  through NADPH oxidase and mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathways, which either exacerbate
  or alleviate periodontal inflammation. The diabetic environment disrupts the balance
  between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, activating autophagy to regulate alveolar bone
  metabolism and leading to bone metabolic disorders. Red upward arrows denote increasing,
  whereas red downward arrows indicate reducing. Figure 4 was independently designed
  by the authors using Affinity Designer 2, with all elements created using native
  software features
