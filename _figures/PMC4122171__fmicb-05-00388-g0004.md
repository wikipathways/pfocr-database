caption: IRE1 pathway under viral infection. In addition to mediating Xbp1 mRNA splicing,
  studies demonstrated that Ire1 activates RIDD to promote the degradation of mRNAs
  encoding ER-targeted proteins to reduce the load of ER client proteins during ER
  stress. The mammalian IRE1–TRAF2–JNK pathway, independent of XBP1 splicing, may
  lead to the activation of apoptosis after prolonged ER stress. HCV and its structural
  proteins E1 and E2 play an important role in the activation of the IRE1–XBP1–ERAD
  pathway. Overexpression of ORF2 of HEV can upregulate antiapoptotic protein Hsp72
  to activate XBP1 splicing. However, further study is required to determine whether
  HEV infection can activate XBP1 via Hsp72. DENV2 infection activates CHOP and GADD34
  expression downstream of IRE1–XBP1 signaling. However, apoptosis activation by JNK,
  but not CHOP, is essential for DENV2 infection.
