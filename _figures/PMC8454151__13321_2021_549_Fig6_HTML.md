caption: Workflow diagram of drug similarity evaluation based on pathway fingerprints.
  Left part shows network schema, meta-path, path instance of drug-target-pathway
  network. In the middle, the explanation of PathSim algorithm was shown using calculation
  of similarity of drug1 and drug2 as an example. First, based on the ‘drug-target-pathway’
  Heterogenous network, metapath between drug1,2 and metapath for themselves were
  retrieved. Then the metapath is used for calculation of similarity between drug
  1 and drug 2. Right part shows the workflow diagram of this study
