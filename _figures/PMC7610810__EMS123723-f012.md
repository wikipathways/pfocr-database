caption: Bacterial infection (or bacterial toxins, SEB) can trigger break of oral
  tolerance to food antigens leading to food-induced VHS upon food-antigen re-exposure.
  OVA-specific IgE antibodies bind to and sensitizes tissue-resident mast cells, which
  are activated upon re-exposure to OVA during feeding and release mediators that
  sensitize afferent neurons via H1R-mediated pathway.
