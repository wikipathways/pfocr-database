caption: Regulation of oxygen sensing and downstream signals in plants and mammals,
  with a focus on ubiquitination and sumoylation. Oxygen sensing is mediated by oxygen-dependent
  enzymes (PCOs in plants, and ADO, PHDs, and FIHs in mammals) that regulate cellular
  responses to oxygen (O2) levels. These enzymes contribute to the regulation of the
  stability of transcription factors that act as master regulators of hypoxia response
  genes (i.e., ERF-VIIs in plants and HIF1α in mammals). Oxidation of N-terminal cysteine
  residues by PCOs and ADO (in plants and mammals, respectively) results in the degradation
  of target proteins via the evolutionarily conserved N-degron pathway. In plants,
  this includes the ERF-VII transcription factors, following their arginylation by
  ATE enzymes and ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRT6. In mammals, PHDs
  and FIHs hydroxylate specific proline and asparagine residues, respectively, on
  HIF1α, which can then be ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL. A conserved
  group of E3 ubiquitin ligases, SINAT1/2 in plants and SIAH1a/2 in mammals, also
  regulate the stability of hypoxia master regulators in plants and mammals. Sumoylation
  is involved in the regulation of HIF1α; however, there are conflicting reports on
  its effect on HIF1α.
