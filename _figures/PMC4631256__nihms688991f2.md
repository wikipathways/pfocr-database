caption: Activity-dependent NMDA signaling induces the CREB signaling pathway, which
  upregulates the expression of miR-132 and BDNF. Both NMDA signaling and miR-132
  expression are significantly reduced in schizophrenia, and BDNF expression is dysregulated.
  MiR-132 inhibits multiple genes including DNMT3A, which causes hypermethylation
  and reduced gene expression of target genes, and MECP2, which regulates both DNA
  methyltransferase and histone modification activity. MECP2 also inhibits expression
  of the schizophrenia-associated miRNA miR-137, and inhibits BDNF expression via
  interaction with the transcriptional repressor REST.
