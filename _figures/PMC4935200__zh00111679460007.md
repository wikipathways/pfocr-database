caption: Potential mechanism of PDGF-induced SphK1 expression and proliferation of
  hPASMCs in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The PDGF/PDGFR signaling pathway
  is upregulated in PAH. Activation of this pathway induces phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK,
  expression and nuclear translocation of the EGR1 transcription factor, and subsequent
  upregulation of SphK1 gene expression. Increased intracellular SphK1 may then lead
  to S1P production in hPASMCs, resulting in enhanced proliferation. Abnormal hPASMC
  proliferation leads to pulmonary vascular remodeling and increased pulmonary vascular
  resistance in PAH.
