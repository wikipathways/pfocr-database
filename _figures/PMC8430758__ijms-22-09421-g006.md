caption: 'Anti-proliferation mechanism of limonene against cancer cells (modified
  from Shojaei et al. 2014 []). Limonene not only induces apoptosis by modulating
  the bcl-2 gene family and up-regulating pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAD and down-regulating
  anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL2, but also by G1 arrest through SMAD regulation
  and by inhibiting metastasis through suppression of Myc caused by the vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) receptor/Akt pathway. : to inhibit the follow action.'
