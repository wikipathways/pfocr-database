caption: '. Apoptosis induced by arsenic trioxide by way of changes in mitochondrial
  membrane potential and increased H2O2 in cells; this lowers the mitochondrial membrane
  potential, leading to the release of cytochrome c and the activation of the caspase
  pathway. Abbreviations: ψM, mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential; Apaf-1,
  apoptotic protease-activating factor 1; GPx, glutathione peroxidase 1; GS, glutathione.
