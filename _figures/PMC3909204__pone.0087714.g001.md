caption: (A) Schematic of EGFR pathway genes in this study. The EGFR ligands Vein
  (vn) and Spitz (spi) are synthesized as precursor peptides, which are cleaved to
  an active form by the protease Rhomboid (rho). These processed ligands are then
  secreted, and bind the receptor, Egfr. Bound receptor dimers initiate signaling
  that can activate a number of downstream pathways, most notably ERK and JNK MAP
  kinase cascades. (B) Schematic of FGFR pathway genes. Two FGFR receptors, Breathless
  (btl) and Heartless (htl) are activated by separate ligands – Heartless by Pyramus
  (pyr) or Thysbee (ths), and Breathless by Branchless (bnl). FGFR activation can
  also initiate multiple downstream signaling pathways, including MAPK cascades.
