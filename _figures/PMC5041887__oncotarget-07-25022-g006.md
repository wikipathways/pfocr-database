caption: Polarity proteins localize to the leading edge, where they regulate Rho GTPases.
  At the leading edge, Cdc42 and Rac are activated, whereas the RhoA protein level
  is reduced as RhoA is degraded by Smurf. The Rho/ROCK pathway is stabilized at the
  cell rear by a positive feedback loop comprising lipid phosphatase PTEN and PIP2.
  In mesenchymal cells Par and Crumbs complexes co-localize with PIP3 (and PI3K) to
  the cell front, in contrast to epithelial cells, where the Par and Crumbs complexes
  co-distribute with PIP2 to the apical region. The Scribble complex, which is found
  basolaterally in epithelial cells, localizes to the leading edge, where it regulates
  Rho GTPases. Note that in mesenchymally migrating cells Rho could also be activated
  at the cell front (not shown, see text for details).
