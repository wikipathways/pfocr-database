caption: 'NAD + metabolism and TIME. A NAD + is synthesized by three pathways: Kynurenine
  pathway, Preiss-Handler pathway, and salvage pathway. Under the action of key synthetases
  such as NAMPT and consuming enzymes such as sirtuins, PARP, and CD38, NAD+ is continuously
  synthesized and consumed, which generates a large amount of ATP for the maintenance
  of cell life activities. B The cells in the tumor immune microenvironment mainly
  include anti-tumor cells and pro-tumor cells. The former mainly include cytotoxic
  T cells (CTLs), NK cells, dendritic cells (DC), M1 macrophages, and N1 neutrophils.
  The latter mainly includes M2 macrophages, bone marrow-derived inhibitory cells
  (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg). These cells influence tumors through a variety
  of signaling pathways and cytokines'
