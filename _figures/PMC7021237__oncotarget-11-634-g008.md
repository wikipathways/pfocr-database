caption: (A) DAF-2 deactivation by antagonists inhibits phosphorylation of DAF-16
  hence promoting its nuclear entry and transcription of the stress responsive genes
  resulting in decreased α-syn aggregation. (B) DAF-2 receptor activates a cascade
  of protein kinases which ultimately terminates at the phosphorylation of downstream
  transcription-factor DAF-16 by AKT protein kinase. DAF-2 activation by agonist phosphorylate
  DAF-16 to prevent its nuclear entry and transcription of the stress responsive genes
  are switched off resulting in increased α-syn aggregation.
