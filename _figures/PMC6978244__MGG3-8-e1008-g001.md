caption: '(a) Schematic of PPA2''s biological functions, as a pyrophosphatase located
  in the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane. Pyrophosphate is generated by nucleotide‐dependent
  reactions, including DNA and RNA synthesis (including tRNA aminoacylation reactions
  and cAMP/cGMP synthesis), protein and lipid synthesis, and activation of fatty acids
  and amino acids. With Mg2+ as a cofactor, PPA2 hydrolyzes inorganic pyrophosphate
  (PPi) to inorganic phosphate (Pi); this reaction is inhibited by calcium. This reaction
  energetically favors ongoing nucleotide‐dependent reactions, and inorganic phosphate
  is used for phosphate metabolism. Biological roles served by PPA2 include the following:
  mtDNA maintenance; oxidative phosphorylation and generation of ATP; ROS (reactive
  oxygen species) homeostasis; mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) regulation; and
  possibly, communication between mitochondria and nucleus (retrograde signaling pathway).
  (b) BioGRID showed 49 total interactors (nodes) and 63 interactions (edges), with
  48 unique interactors representing diverse mitochondrial and cellular processes
