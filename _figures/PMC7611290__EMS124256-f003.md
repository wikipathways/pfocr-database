caption: Overview of the wide range of processes in which REV7 is involved through
  interactions with various proteins. See text,  and  for details. a. REV7 functions
  in TLS by forming Polζ together with REV3, POLD2 and POLD3. Polζ also contributes
  to DNA repair synthesis after HR. b. The shieldin complex, consisting of REV7, SHLD3,
  SHLD2 and SHLD1, counteracts resection at DNA DSBs and thereby contributes to NHEJ.
  c. REV7 contributes to the cellular response to DNA damage. Upon DNA damage exposure
  by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), REV7 contributes to MAP kinase pathway activation
  through the transcription factor Elk-1. Additionally, UV-damage induces degradation
  of REV7. d. REV7 binds to and sequesters the APC/C-coactivator CDH1, and thereby
  contributes to the correct timing of mitotic progression. e. REV7 interacts with
  CAMP, RAN GTPase and CLTA that colocalize with REV7 at the mitotic spindle. f. REV7
  contributes to primordial germ cell development and chromatin regulation. In this
  context, REV7 was found to interact with G9A/GLP methyltransferases and Cdk1. g.
  REV7 contributes to somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin genes and immunoglobulin
  class-switch recombination (CSR) through functioning in TLS and shieldin. Additionally,
  REV7 interacts with IpaB and ADP. Together, REV7 thereby contributes to the cellular
  response to pathogens. h. REV7 is dysregulated in various cancer types. In addition,
  REV7 interacts with NCOA3, TCF4, SIM2, HCCA2 and PRDX2 in various cellular contexts
  or related to cancer development and treatment. The interaction of REV7 with PRCC
  contributes to REV7 subcellular localization.
