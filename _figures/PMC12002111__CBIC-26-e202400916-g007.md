caption: 'The rufomycin BGC from Streptomyces atratus features a hybrid RiPP‐NRPS
  biosynthetic pathway. The BGC contains genes encoding the precursor peptide BytA
  (MRYLH), the P450 enzyme RufO, NO synthase RufN, peptidase RufB, and nonribosomal
  peptide synthetase RufT. The biosynthetic pathway proceeds in two distinct phases:
  First, in the RiPP pathway, the precursor peptide BytA undergoes selective nitration
  at its tyrosine residue through the combined action of RufN and RufO, followed by
  RufB‐mediated peptide hydrolysis to release 3‐nitrotyrosine. Subsequently, in the
  NRPS pathway, the RufT synthetase incorporates this modified 3‐nitrotyrosine building
  block into the final rufomycin A scaffold, yielding a potent antitubercular cyclic
  peptide. This new biosynthetic logic exemplifies how RiPP machinery can be leveraged
  to generate noncanonical amino acids that serve as building blocks for nonribosomal
  assembly lines'
