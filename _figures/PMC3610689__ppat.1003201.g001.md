caption: (A) The conventional model is that KdpD/KdpE stimulates transcription of
  the Kdp-ATPase in response to cytoplasmic ionic and ATP concentrations and possibly
  also turgor pressure . (B) In S. aureus KdpD is affected directly or indirectly
  by QS systems, and KdpE regulates many downstream genes including virulence factors
  by directly binding to their promoters , . (C) In EHEC, KdpE can also be activated
  by the QseC histidine kinase, which senses host adrenergic signals as well as bacterial
  quorum sensing (QS) signals . In vitro its regulatory targets include the ler gene,
  which controls the “locus of enterocyte effacement" (LEE) genes. Under gluconeogenic
  conditions, KdpE interacts with Cra to optimally regulate ler; both proteins bind
  to the promoter, perhaps through bending of the DNA . The downstream regulatory
  cascade is integral to lesion formation in the host gut , . (D) Recently identified
  accessory components in nonpathogenic E. coli link the pathway to additional input
  stimuli or modulate KdpD activity , , .
