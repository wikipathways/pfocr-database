caption: Model of three cell death signaling pathways in plasma-treated cancer cells.
  Plasma exposure increases aquaporin transporters in cancer cell membranes that allow
  the transport of H2O2 into the cells. Additionally, plasma treatment oxidizes cellular
  membranes, leading to cell death signaling. The excessive intracellular ROS contribute
  to the initiation of the cell death signaling (e.g., apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis,
  and ferroptosis) in cancer cells, partially through the activation of the MAPK pathway.
