caption: Upon disassembly of the cytoplasmic cell-adhesion complex, catenins are released
  and accumulate in the cytoplasm. β-Catenin (β) is then sequestered by the adenomatous
  polyposis coli (APC)–axin–glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) complex and phosphorylated
  by GSK-3β. Phosphorylated β-catenin is specifically bound by βTrCP, a subunit of
  the E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex, which ubiquitylates β-catenin and thereby marks
  it for rapid proteosomal degradation. However, on activation of the WNT signalling
  pathway, GSK-3β is repressed, and β-catenin is no longer phosphorylated. β-catenin
  translocates to the nucleus where, together with the TCF/LEF1 transcription factors,
  it modulates the expression of several target genes. Transcriton factor KLF4 interacts
  with β-catenin and inhibits Wnt signaling pathway.
