caption: 'Exposure paradigm. HD was administered to Fischer 344 rats as a 0.33% solution
  in the drinking water ad libitum for 17 days. X-ray was given as a single dose of
  0.5 Gy, 1 Gy, or 2 Gy on the 17th day. Animals were divided into two time point
  groups, depending on downstream endpoints. For the 3 hr time point, the animals
  were exposed to all doses and dose combinations (n = 5; seven groups: 0.33% HD,
  0.5 Gy x-ray, 1 Gy x-ray, 2 Gy x-ray, 0.33% HD + 0.5 Gy x-ray, 0.33% HD + 1 Gy x-ray
  and 0.33% HD + 2 Gy x-ray) and testes were taken at 3 hrs following x-ray exposure
  for LCM and qRT-PCR arrays. For the 12 hr time point, a group of animals was dosed
  only with the highest doses (n = 5; 0.33% HD, 2 Gy x-ray, and 0.33% HD + 2 Gy x-ray
  and the testes were taken for transillumination dissection and western blotting.'
