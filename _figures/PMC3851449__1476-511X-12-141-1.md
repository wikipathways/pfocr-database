caption: Pathways for metabolism of n-6 (left) and n-3 (right) PUFAs in humans. The
  pathway depicts the synthesis of 20 and 22 carbon PUFAs from the essential, dietary
  PUFAs, α-linolenic acid (n-3) and linoleic acid (n-6). The PUFAs derived from borage
  oil (linoleic and gamma-linolenic acids, both n-6) and echium (α-linolenic, n-3;
  stearidonic, n-3; linoleic and gamma-linolenic acids, both n-6) would be expected
  to enter the pathways at the indicated points.
