caption: Points of inhibition for ibrutinib, idelalisib, fostamatinib, and Lck-i in
  the BCR signaling pathway. Illustration of proximal signals initiated during BCR
  engagement and points where well described inhibitors act. (a) Lck-i acts to inhibit
  the most proximal signaling event of SFK-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine residues
  within CD79. Ibrutinib acts to inhibit the ability of Btk to phosphorylate and activate
  PLCγ2. (b) Fostamatinib acts to inhibit Syk kinase activity as well as that of Lyn.
  Idelalisib works to inhibit PI3Kδ to limit the formation of PIP3 and has the effect
  of blocking membrane interaction of signaling proteins containing PH domains such
  as PDK1, Akt, and Btk.
