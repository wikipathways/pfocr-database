caption: SESN2 upregulation activated mitophagy in PC12 cells by hypoxia treatment.
  Mitophagy receptor FUNDC1 plays a vital role in hypoxia-induced mitophagy. Moreover,
  SESN2 upregulation may function through synergistic regulation with other pathways,
  such as SESN2/AMPK, to mediate cellular adaptation to hypoxia. Therefore, SESN2
  plays a critical role in regulating neural cell response to hypoxia.
