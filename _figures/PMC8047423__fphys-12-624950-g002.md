caption: Molecular mechanism governing cell quiescence and torpidity in contrast with
  cell proliferation and euthermia. Quiescent and torpid cells feature a metabolic
  shift from glucose fueled OXPHOS to FAO. Low nutrient supply leads to depletion
  of ATP which is detected by LKB1 that in turn activates AMPK, eliciting a downstream
  cascade including the activation of TSC1/2 that suppresses PI3K/Akt pathway and
  downstream ATP-expensive processes. AMPK further shuts down gene expression via
  activation of HDACs which tightly pack histone-DNA complexes into heterochromatin.
  Also, AMPK promotes autophagy by activating ULK1/ATG7, lipolysis and fatty acid
  oxidation via activation of OXPHOS regulator FOXOs proteins and PGC-1α. In addition,
  PGC-1α, a transcriptional coregulator of PPAR target genes, promotes the upregulation
  of PPARδ. The PML-PPARδ-FAO further promotes β-oxidation of lipids and the metabolic
  shift toward FAO. HIF-1α promotes FAO via upregulation of PDK4 and inhibition of
  the first step in the TCA cycle, and promotes resistance to hypoxia stress and ROS
  damage. HIF-1α can be activated by its upstream regulator the Meis1 protein, which
  is activated by the elevation of intracellular ROS, and by low levels of O2. Dotted
  lines represent a restricted generation of molecules pointed at. Solid lines represent
  activated pathways. T lines indicate the suppression of the pathway. AMPK, AMP-activated
