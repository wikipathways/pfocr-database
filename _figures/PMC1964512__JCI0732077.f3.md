caption: 'Each network is graphically displayed with genes/gene products as nodes
  (different shapes represent the functional classes of the gene products; see Node
  legend) and the biological relationships between the nodes as edges (lines). The
  length of an edge reflects the evidence in the literature supporting that node-to-node
  relationship. The intensity of the node color indicates the degree of up- (red)
  or downregulation (green) of the respective gene. IPA networks were generated as
  follows: Upon completed uploading of genes and corresponding fold-change expression
  values (done separately for Ad-IFN-γ and Ad-null differentially expressed genes),
  each gene identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the IPA Knowledge
  Base (part of the IPA algorithm). Fold-change expression values were then used to
  identify genes whose expression was differentially regulated; these “focus genes”
  were overlaid onto a global molecular network contained in the IPA Knowledge Base.
  Networks of these focus genes were then algorithmically generated based on their
  connectivity and scored according to the number of focus genes within the network
  as well as according to the strength of their associations. We focused on IFNG-
  and IL-2–associated networks obtained after Ad-IFN-γ infection. To show the difference
  in genes expressed after infection with Ad-null, these networks were overlaid with
  Ad-null data. It is of note that the networks obtained after Ad-null infection lacked
  expression of several genes (white nodes) differentially regulated by Ad-IFN-γ.'
