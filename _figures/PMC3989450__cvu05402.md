caption: Canonical Wnt signalling. (A) In the absence of Wnt ligand, β-catenin is
  bound to the destruction complex of Axin, APC, and GSK3β and is phosphorylated and
  targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. SFRP directly binds to Wnt outside
  the cell preventing it from binding to the frizzled (Fz) receptor, while Dkk competitively
  inhibits the binding of Wnt to LRP5/6 co-receptor. SFRP can also bind to Fz preventing
  Wnts from binding to Fzd. (B) Wnt binding to Fz and LRP5/6 receptor can initiate
  the canonical Wnt pathway. Dishevelled (Dsh) is phosphorylated and Axin relocates
  to the cell membrane with inhibition of the β-catenin destruction complex. β-Catenin
  accumulates within the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus where it associates
  with the TCF group of transcription factors to initiate Wnt-dependent target gene
  transcription.
