caption: Model for the role of PN/α5β1 integrin-mediated Fak-Rac1-Cdc42-Pak1-FLNA
  signaling in VIC survival and remodeling functions. The figure summarizes our findings
  in a model that proposes how periostin and FLNA function as a central regulatory
  axis for valve morphogenesis. Overall, we conclude that a PN/α5β1 integrin interaction
  with FLNA engenders a unique signaling pathway that is transduced through the activation
  of Fak1/S6K signaling to Cdc42-Pak1-dependent activation of FLNA (–). This results
  in changes in adhesion and cytoskeletal organization that are linked to morphogenetic
  remodeling and maturation of valve primordia.
