caption: 'Figure 1. Model for the dual role of the Abl family kinases in angiopoietin/Tie2
  signaling. The secreted glycoprotein angiopoietin-1 (Angpt1), which is produced
  by perivascular cells, including pericytes, binds to and activates the endothelial
  receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, activating intracellular signaling pathways to promote
  responses including endothelial cell survival and migration. In contrast, angiopoietin-2
  (Angpt2) is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells and functions as a context-dependent
  Tie2 antagonist or weak agonist. The Abl kinases (Abl and Arg) positively regulate
  Tie2 mRNA expression and are required for maximal Angpt1-mediated pro-survival signaling,
  primarily through the PI3K/Akt and, to a lesser extent, Erk signaling pathways.
  In addition, the Abl kinases are activated downstream of the Tie2 receptor. The
  Abl kinases may also modulate Angpt1-mediated endothelial cell migration through
  effects on signaling proteins, including Dok-R, Nck, and PAK. The pathway linking
  the Abl kinases to regulation of Tie2 mRNA expression remains to be defined. Abbreviations:
  EC, endothelial cell; Tie2, tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth
  factor homology domains-2; Angpt, angiopoietin; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
  Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Dok-R, downstream of tyrosine kinase-related
  protein; PAK, p21-activated kinase.'
