caption: Functions of extracellular S100A4 protein. S100A4 can be released into the
  extracellular space by fibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes and myeloid cells.
  The expression of extracellular S100A4 leads to increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2
  and activation of NF‐κB through the RAGE‐dependent regulation, which is associated
  with cell motility, invasion, cell survival and inflammation. The consequent sustained
  release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines and MMPs promote angiogenesis. Besides, extracellular
  S100A4 interacted with RAGE exerts an inhibitory effect on autophagy through activating
  β‐catenin signalling pathway. On the other hand, extracellular S100A4 activates
  TLR4/ERK1/2 pathway to abrogate caspase‐9‐dependent apoptosis. Meanwhile, extracellular
  S100A4 induces inflammatory response partly mediated by TLR4 and through the activation
  of NF‐κB axis, the kinases p38 and ERK1/2. In addition, extracellular S100A4 increases
  the expression of α‐SMA through activating of c‐Myb and S1P pathway. Extracellular
  S100A4 also can affect T cell differentiation by the alteration of T cell polarization
  balance toward the Th2 phenotype. RAGE, receptor for advanced glycosylation end
  products; TLR4, Toll‐like receptor 4; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; ERK1/2, extracellular
  signal‐regulated kinase; NF‐κB, nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated
