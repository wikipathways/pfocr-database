caption: Schematic overview of the dosage-dependent transcriptional responses during
  encystation. (Top) Timeline for encystation that includes 7 h marked by ESVs (closed
  pink circle) that traffic CWPs; the 18-h middle stage, with ESVs and ECVs (closed
  blue circle) that traffic the GalNAc sugars; the 24-h middle-late stage, with cysts
  that have begun disassembly of their cytoskeletons; and the 48-h late stage, with
  mature cysts. (Middle) Expression profiles of GLP4 (magenta), MYB2 (green), CWPs
  (red), and GalNAc enzymes (black) in response to encystation stimuli. GLP4 increases
  rapidly within 30 min and decreases at 4 h, MYB2 increases within 2 to 4 h, CWPs
  increase within 2 to 4 h, and enzymes in the GalNAc pathway increase by 7 to 18
  h. (Bottom) Regulatory relationship of GLP4, MYB2, CWPs, and enzymes of the GalNAc
  pathway in G1+S and G2+M cells after exposure to encystation stimuli. (Bottom left)
  GLP4 and MYB2 are not up-regulated in the trophozoite (preencystation). CWPs and
  GalNAc enzymes remain uninduced. (Bottom right) Giardia cells accumulate in the
  G2+M phase in response to encystation stimuli (accumulation is depicted by the size
  of the blue arrows). MYB2 has been shown to bind the promoter regions of CWP1 to
  CWP3 and G6PI-B, as well as function as an activator in previous studies. In the
  G1+S phase, GLP4 is up-regulated to repress MYB2; hence, CWPs and GalNAc enzymes
  are down-regulated. In the G2+M phase, GLP4 is down-regulated and MYB2 is up-regulated.
  Therefore, CWPs and GalNAc enzymes are up-regulated.
