caption: Working model for PD-L1 in the regulation of ciliogenesis. Enriched expression
  of receptors on the ciliary membrane makes the primary cilium a specialized organelle
  for receiving and transducing extracellular stimuli into cells. Vesicles carrying
  ciliary proteins leave the Golgi and move toward the basal body of the primary cilium.
  Active forms of Rab8, a master modulator for the ciliary protein trafficking, and
  the BBSome complex, regulates the entry of protein cargo to the cilium. The activities
  and basal body localization of Rab8 are modulated by Golgi-associated Ift20 and
  the BBSome. Knockdown of PD-L1 enhances ciliogenesis by modulating the localization
  of proteins important for ciliary protein sorting, trafficking, and cilia sensory
  signaling. Depletion of PD-L1 increases cilia length and increases the ciliary recruitment
  of Rab8a and BBS5. Also, knockdown of PD-L1 increases the ciliary localization of
  cilia sensory receptor PC-2, and Gli3 which results in the repression of the Hh
  signaling pathway
