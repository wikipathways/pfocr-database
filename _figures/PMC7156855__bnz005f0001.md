caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways of neurosteroid formation. HMG-CoA is the precursor
  for cholesterol synthesis. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the production of mevalonic
  acid from HMG-CoA, with a reaction that is rate-limiting for cholesterol synthesis.
  Mevalonic acid is then converted via the the mevalonate pathway to lanosterol, which
  is, in turn, converted to cholesterol via either the Bloch pathway or the Kandutsch–Russell
  pathway. CYP11A1 (P450 side-chain cleavage, named P450scc in rodents), more expressed
  in females than in males, catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone
  through the first rate-limiting step of de novo steroidogenesis. Further steroid
  conversions are catalyzed by 3β-HSD, CYP17 (P450c17), 5α-R, and CYP19 (aromatase).
  Full-line arrows indicate active steroidogenic biosynthetic pathways in the brain.
  Dashed line arrows represent undetermined steroidogenic biosynthetic pathways. Steroidogenic
  enzymes are represented by dashed line boxes. The color codes indicate their distribution
  in brain cells; cyan: neurons; green: microglia; orange: astrocytes.'
