caption: Overview of the Wnt signaling pathway. (A) In the canonical Wnt pathway,
  secreted Wnt ligands (usually Wnt3A and Wnt1) bind to Frizzled (FZD) receptors and
  LRP co-receptors. These receptors are then activated via CK1 and GSK3B mediated
  phosphorylation, which further recruits Dishevelled (DVL) to the plasma membrane
  and initiates activation. The DVL signalosome results in sequestration and inhibition
  of β-catenin destruction complex (Axin and APC) allowing stabilized β-catenin levels
  in the cytoplasm to increase. β-Catenin translocates into the nucleus where it forms
  an active complex with lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF), T-cell factor (TCF), and
  other histone-modifying co-activators such as CBP/p300 and BCL9, resulting in transcriptional
  activation (as represented by red arrow) of Wnt target genes which in turn causes
  an increase in cellular processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation
  and stem cell renewal. (B) In the Wnt/PCP pathway, Wnt ligands bind to FZD and co-receptors
  such as ROR1/2 and recruit DVL to the plasma membrane. DVL interacts with small
  GTPases such as RHO and RAC to further trigger activation of JNK. This results in
  activation of cytoskeletal rearrangements by transcriptional responses via JUN and
  ATF2 (activating transcription factor). (C) The Wnt/Ca2+pathway is initiated by
  Wnt-FZD-ROR complex and G-protein-triggered phospholipase C (PLC) activity that
  results in intracellular Ca2+ influx. This further activates CDC42 and triggers
  calcium-dependent cell movement and polarity via various transcriptional responses
  (red arrow).
