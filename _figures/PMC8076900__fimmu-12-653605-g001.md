caption: Effects of cytokine signaling on T cell metabolism. IL-2 bound to the IL-2
  receptor (IL-2R) is able to promote the activity of mTOR through PDK in CD8+ T cells
  and PI3K/Akt in CD4+ T cells. IL-2 promotes the expression of SLC7A5 at the cell
  surface leading to influx of amino acids, further promoting the activity of mTOR
  and glycolysis. IL-7 also signals through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, as well as
  promoting GLUT1 expression to sustain glycolysis. In CD8+ memory T cells, IL-7 increases
  glycerol uptake and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis to enhance fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO). IL-15 and IL-21 have very similar action in promoting antioxidant production,
  FAO, mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in T cells.
  IL-15 and IL-21 have also been shown to increase mTOR activity in CD8+ memory T
  cells and Tregs, respectively. IL-1β drives mTOR activity and glycolysis in CD4+
  T cells, typically promoting a Th17 cell phenotype. The anti-inflammatory cytokine
  TGF-β inhibits glycolysis in CD4+ T cells via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and inhibits
  OXPHOS in CD4+ memory T cells. Created with Biorender.com.
