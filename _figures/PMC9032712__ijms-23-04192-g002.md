caption: 'Upstream: “Damage signals”, represented by the red arrow, activate the microglia
  that release cytotoxic compounds such as cytokines, as demonstrated by the theory
  of neuroimmunomodulation []: (1). These proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1
  and IL-6, signaled by red circles, activate membrane receptors in the neuron (2)
  which activates a signaling pathway that promotes the formation of the CDK5/p25
  complex, which is mainly responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation (3). Downstream:
  Hyperphosphorylated tau increasing the number of binding sites for phosphates in
  the same molecule (4). Structural changes occur as a result of post-translational
  modifications, facilitating the formation of oligomers in neurons. Therefore, the
  ‘native’ protein is altered, and subsequently tau folds abnormally (misfolding)
  (5). Hyperphosphorylated tau, not bound to microtubules, binds in pairs, forming
  paired helical filaments (PHF). The polymerization of tau requires inductor molecules
  such as polyanions (6). Consequences of this pathological process include neural
  dysfunction or death from apoptosis. In this case, the PHF moves to the extracellular
  fluid accessing the nearby cell, acting as a nucleation seed and forming new aggregates
  of tau, and AD disease is observed (7). Symbology: 1.—Red arrow: damage signal.
  2.—Red circle: cytokines. 3.—Gray key: hyperphosphorylation process. 4.—Chain: the
  missing link.'
