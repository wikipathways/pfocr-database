caption: Schematic representation of CRC progression along the three different pathways
  according to the Fearon and Vogelstein model. CIN, chromosomal instability; MSI,
  microsatellite instability; CIMP, CpG island methylator; MMR, DNA mismatch repair;
  LOH, loss of heterozygosity. Independently of the pathway, a defect in the APC/beta-catenin
  axis marks the onset of the transformation process from normal epithelia to early
  adenoma. A defect along the KRAS/BRAF pathway is required to progress to intermediate
  adenoma. Loss or silencing of different tumor suppressor genes finally determines
  the progression to late adenoma and then to carcinoma. In the CIN pathway, the transition
  to the carcinoma stage is marked by the inactivation of the tumor-suppressor gene
  TP53, whose product is pivotal in regulating DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, senescence,
  apoptosis and metabolism in response to a variety of stress signals. Therefore,
  its loss contributes to drug resistance and to the propagation of damaged DNA to
  daughter cells, increasing the mutational load. TP53 mutation or loss of it has
  been reported in 50–75% of CRC cases and it is associated with the progression and
  outcome of sporadic CRC [,].
