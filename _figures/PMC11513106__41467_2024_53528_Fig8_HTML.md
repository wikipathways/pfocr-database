caption: Aberrantly elevated metabolite FPP in BD patients promotes PMN hyperactivation
  via a calcium-TRPM2-dependent pathway, evidenced by the excessive production of
  proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, and NETs, which exacerbates vascular endothelium
  inflammation and damage. In addition, excessive levels of TNF in BD serum triggered
  the upregulation of TRPM2, which further induced hypersensitivity to FPP in BD-PMN.
  All these led to significantly increased serum levels of NETs and proinflammatory
  cytokines, including TNF, ultimately resulting in proinflammatory positive feedback
  loops in BD. Created in BioRender. Ji, Z. (2024) BioRender.com/d22k224
