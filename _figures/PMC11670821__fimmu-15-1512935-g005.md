caption: Roles of H. pylori OMVs and infected cell exosomes in the extra-gastric diseases.
  CagA-containing exosomes enhance NLRP12 expression in intestinal epithelial cells,
  inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway and reducing the levels of chemokines like
  MIP-1α and MCP-1, ultimately improving colitis symptoms. Extracellular secretion
  of CagA by CDX2-dependent mechanism from GES-1 modulates transcriptionally, correlating
  with claudin-2 protein expression to facilitate intestinal mucosal repair delays.
  CagA secretion from H. pylori in vascular endothelial cells induces ROS formation,
  leading to endothelial cell activation, JAK-STAT3 activation factor signaling disruption,
  promoting macrophage foam cell formation, and atherosclerosis development. Circulating
  miR-25-containing exosomes can modulate the NF-κB signaling pathway by targeting
  the transcription factor KLF2, subsequently increasing the expression of ICAM-1,
  MCP-1, VCAM-1, and IL-6, thus accelerating atherosclerosis in vascular endothelial
  cells. Furthermore, OMVs produced during chronic H. pylori infection in the intestinal
  tract activate microglia and astrocytes to promote their migration. This activation,
  along with the enhancement of amyloid β or tau, can trigger inflammation in the
  central nervous system, potentially elucidating the higher prevalence of Alzheimer’s
  disease in individuals with H. pylori infection. Lastly, H. pylori infection induces
  the expression of α-SMA, TIMP-1, β-catenin, and vimentin (α-SMA, TIMP-1, β-catenin,
  and vimentin ↑) in hematopoietic stem cells derived from hepatocytes, while downregulating
  the expression of E-cadherin at both the gene and protein levels (E-cadherin ↓),
  ultimately contributing to liver fibrosis
