caption: Benzoyl-coenzyme A metabolism. (A) Reconstruction of the anaerobic degradation
  of phenolic compounds via the benzoyl-coenzyme A pathway. Significantly represented
  enzymes are shown in red, the enzymes represented equally in the reference and in
  the A04_AAIW metagenome are shown in pink, and the enzymes that are better represented
  in the reference metagenomes are shown in gray. The key enzymes related to benzoyl-coenzyme
  A are shown blue. Pink circles represent the compounds found in the KEGG aminobenzoate
  pathway, and brown circles represent those of the benzoate pathway. (B) Metabolic
  network reconstruction of the anaerobic conversion of benzoyl-coenzyme A. The significant
  enzymes are shown in red; the enzymes represented equally in the reference and the
  A04_AAIW metagenome are shown in pink, and the enzymes that are better represented
  in the reference metagenomes are shown in gray. A group of enzymes annotated in
  the reference and A04_AAIW (purple circles) with EC numbers “. -” are presented.
  One enzyme annotated only in the reference yellow circle and another annotated only
  in the Gulf metagenome (blue circle) are also shown (the EC list is included in
  ).
