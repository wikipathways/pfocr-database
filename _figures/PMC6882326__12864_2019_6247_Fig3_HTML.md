caption: Anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and expression of related genes during bract
  development in poinsettia varieties. (left) Differentially expressed genes (FDR ≤ 0.05)
  in the three stages of bract development are depicted by S1, S2 and S3 (Stages 1,
  2 and 3, respectively) symbols next to the genes. Stages colored in red indicate
  a higher expression of the respective gene in the red poinsettia variety. Stages
  colored in blue indicate a higher expression of the respective gene in the white
  poinsettia variety. (right) Heatmap of the genes involved in each process of the
  pathway. Gene expression is represented by Log10(FPKM+ 1). FPKM = Fragments per
  kilobase per million. For gene abbreviations refer to Table
