caption: 'Schematic overview of the key players in ISP-mediated control of female
  insect reproductive physiology. Solid lines represent a consensus, a process that
  has been demonstrated in several insect orders. [It needs to be emphasized that
  the role of ISP in honeybee reproduction strongly deviates from the consensus. Therefore,
  information from the honeybee is not taken into account in this overview.] Dashed
  lines represent processes that have only been demonstrated in a limited number of
  insect species or orders, or that may possibly act more indirectly than suggested
  on the figure. These lines go accompanied by a remark, indicated by a superscript
  character. Nutrient-related (signaling) pathways (red arrows): Upon digestion of
  food in the midgut, nutrients are absorbed by the midgut cells and subsequently
  released into the hemolymph. They are either directly used by the tissues as a source
  of metabolic energy or as a substrate in anabolic reactions, or they are stored
  in fat body cells. The fat body''s nutritional stores may then be mobilized for
  the production of vitellogenins, energetic substrates and other metabolic products
  that serve the process of oogenesis within the ovary. The TOR signaling pathway
  constitutes a conserved cellular nutrient (amino acid)-sensing system (Hietakangas
  and Cohen, ) and is therefore indispensable in the control of vitellogenin synthesis
  in the fat body. (a) Glucose availability stimulates the in vivo release of bombyxin
  from the silkworm brain, although a direct effect on the brain has so far not been
  proven (Masumura et al., ). Although the isolated fruit fly brain does not seem
  to release ILPs in response to glucose in vitro (Geminard et al., ), it is worth
  noting that some electrical properties of ILP producing brain cells appear to be
  affected by the glucose (Fridell et al., ; Kreneisz et al., ). (b) A hitherto unknown
  humoral factor that stimulates ILP release from the fruit fly brain is released
  from the fat body via a TOR-mediated response to the presence of amino acids (Colombani
  et al., ; Geminard et al., ). (c) Similarly, the cytokine-like factor Unpaired 2
  is produced in the fat body in response to dietary fats and sugar. Remarkably, Unpaired
  2 also appears to induce the release of ILP from the fruit fly brain. Although Unpaired
  2 has so far not been demonstrated in the fruit fly hemolymph circulation in vivo,
  the authors of the corresponding report suggested that this protein may act as a
  humoral factor (Rajan and Perrimon, ). Lipophilic hormone signaling (green arrows):
  Ecdysteroids are in adult insects mainly synthesized by the gonads. In females they
  fulfill auto- and paracrine roles in ovary and oocyte development. In addition,
  ecdysteroid conjugates are stored in the eggs as an embryonic source of these lipophilic
  hormones. Juvenile hormone is produced by the CA. It stimulates vitellogenin production
  by the fat body, as well as vitellogenin sequestration by the developing oocytes.
  (d) In dipteran species, an endocrine function for the ecdysteroids in the regulation
  of vitellogenin synthesis has been demonstrated (Huybrechts and De Loof, ). An endocrine
  role seems to be attributed to ecdysteroids in B. mori too, since in this insect
  they are capable of stimulating ILP synthesis in the fat body (Okamoto et al., ,
  ). Remarkably, the decline of ecdysteroids appears to be crucial for termination
  of vitellogenesis in both A. aegypti and B. mori, indicating that the outcome of
  ecdysteroid action in reproductive physiology is stage-dependent and species-specific
  (Dhadialla et al., ; Swevers and Iatrou, ; Bryant and Raikhel, ). (e) In the beetle
  T. castaneum a stimulatory effect of JH on expression of some ILP genes in brain
  and fat body was shown (Sheng et al., ). ILP signaling (blue arrows): A stimulatory
  role of insulin signaling on JH biosynthesis has been shown in several insect orders,
  (f) although it is not clear whether ILPs are directly delivered to the CA by projections
  of the CC or whether they are received from the circulating hemolymph (Tu et al.,
  ; Belgacem and Martin, ). (g) A stimulatory effect of ILPs on ovarian ecdysteroidogenesis
  has so far only been demonstrated in dipteran species (Tu et al., ; Brown et al.,
  ; Wen et al., ). (h) Direct ILP-mediated positive control of oogenesis has hitherto
  only been shown in D. melanogaster (Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling, ; LaFever and
  Drummond-Barbosa, ; Richard et al., ) and T. castaneum (Parthasarathy and Palli,
  ). (i) Similarly, direct ILP-mediated stimulation of vitellogenesis has so far only
  been observed in Diptera (Roy et al., ; Gulia-Nuss et al., ) and in T. castaneum
  (Parthasarathy and Palli, ; Sheng et al., ). (j) In some insect species, ILP synthesis
  also occurs in the fat body (Badisco et al., ; Okamoto et al., ). In the desert
  locust, S. gregaria, the expression levels in this tissue are temporally regulated
  during the reproductive cycle (Badisco et al., ). It is therefore possible that
  ILP produced by the fat body also acts, at least in this insect species, as a paracrine
  messenger that signals information about the nutritional status within this tissue
  and stimulates vitellogenin production (Badisco et al., ). Abbreviations: CA, corpora
  allata; CC, corpora cardiaca; ILP, insulin-like peptide; JH, juvenile hormone; TOR,
  target of rapamycin.'
