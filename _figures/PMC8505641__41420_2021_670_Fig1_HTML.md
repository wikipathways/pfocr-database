caption: Microvesicles are generated after formation by budding from the plasma membrane.
  Exosomes are essentially intraluminal vesicles(ILV), which are formed in multivesicular
  endosomes (MVE). Cargoes sorting to MVEs originate from endocytosis at the plasma
  membrane or to early sorting endosomes. Proteins are transported from the Golgi
  or internalized from the cell surface, and nucleic acid can be endocytosed and transferred
  into the early endosomes. Then early endosomes maturate into MVE, which follows
  either the secretory or degradative pathway. Microvesicles are secreted upon the
  fusion of MVEs with the cytomembrane. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) may also be internalized
  by multiple pathways, such as direct signaling through ligand/receptor molecules,
  the direct fusion of their membrane, endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and even phagocytosis.
  MicroRNA carried by EVs can uptake into receptor cells and combine with target genes
  to regulate inflammatory response. Hypoxia can activate HIF-1α signaling and alter
  the biogenesis of EV, and Rab GTPases and ROS are also involved in this process.
