caption: (a) A schematic model for transcriptional regulation of tarsal repatterning
  genes to form the tarsal segments. After leg amputation, epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) signaling and Gb'dac induce a high level of Gb'Dll expression in
  the blastema. Then, low Gb'Dll expression induces Gb'dac expression in the proximal
  presumptive tarsal segment 1. In the distal presumptive tarsal segments 2 and 3,
  high Gb'Dll activity represses Gb'dac expression and induces the expression of Gb'Egfr,
  Gb'al, Gb'BarH, and Gb'bab, which establish the pattern of tarsal segments 2 and
  3 along the proximodistal axis. Gb'dac expression represses Gb'bab expression in
  the distal tarsal segment 1. (b) A schematic illustration of the Ds/Ft signaling
  cascades in regeneration of the tibia to regulate tibial cell proliferation. Ds/Fat
  and Hippo signaling suppresses the activity of the Yki/Sd and Yki/Mad complexes,
  where Mad activity is regulated by Dpp signaling. Both complexes control growth
  in part by regulating bantam and Cyclin E, which regulates cell proliferation. Expression
  of Gb'dac in the presumptive tibia is regulated by downstream genes of the Hippo
  signaling pathway. Gb'dac activated by formation of a complex with unknown factor(s)
  may induce cell proliferation.
