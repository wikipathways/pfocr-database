caption: Transcriptional regulatory interactions controlling trichome development.
  Activators are connected to their targets by arrows, proteins are indicated as circles
  in the same color as the corresponding genes. Question marks indicate identities
  that need yet to be established. Dotted arrows indicate the predicted movement of
  the small single MYB-repeat proteins TRY, CPC, and ETC1 from one cell to another.
  A, Two identical epidermal cells prior to either one adopting a trichome identity.
  B, The cell on the left has entered the trichome pathway while the cell on the right
  will remain a pavement cell.
