caption: 'Specific signaling pathways maintain the resting platelet state (a) or initiate
  platelet activation (b). Prostacyclin (PGI2) is primarily produced via the COX-2
  pathway by endothelial cells and binds to stimulatory Gαs-coupled and GTP-GDP exchange
  factor (GEF) proteins through prostacyclin receptors (IP, green arrows). The resting
  platelet state (a) is maintained by IP-mediated Gαs-protein coupled stimulation
  through the synthesis of cyclic-AMP (cAMP) by adenylate cyclase (AC 3, 6, or 7).
  cAMP elicits a variety of effects including: inhibition of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)
  and Rho/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway. cAMP also directly stimulates exchange
  protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) and Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1) signaling,
  along with PKA. Protein kinase A, in turn, phosphorylates cAMP myosin light chain
  kinase (MLCK) that maintains an inactive actin cytoskeleton and prevents granule
  release as well as maintaining integrins in an inactive state. Resting platelets
  also accumulate ADP in dense granules via granule membrane multidrug resistance
  protein 4 (MRP4). Calcium stores and microtubules also remain stabilized in resting
  platelets. Activating platelets by contrast can involve a variety of different signaling
  pathways depending on the stimulus (b). Thromboxane A2 is a potent activator of
  platelets through the G12/13 protein coupled thromboxane receptor (TP; teal arrows).
  Likewise, thrombin activates protease-activated receptors (PAR) 1 and 4 through
  G12/13 coupled proteins. Both G12/13 coupled receptors activate Rho/ROCK kinase
  activity leading to MLCK phosphorylation and thereby myosin activation, and LIM
  domain kinase (LIM-K) that phosphorylates cofilin, which triggers actin filament
  disassembly. These cytoskeletal changes are accompanied by the destabilization of
  microtubules. TP and PAR1,4 along with ADP activation of the purinergic G-protein
  coupled receptor (P2Y) act upon Gaq proteins (red arrows). This activity stimulates
  PLCγ and the release of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphophonate (PIP2) and activation
  of IP3 in combination with diacyl-glycerol (DAG). These events trigger calcium release
  and protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Ca2+ and diacylglycerol-regulated guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor I (CalDAG-GEF-I) catalyzes GDP for GTP exchange in Rap1B.
  These events activate Rap1-GTP-interacting adapter molecule (RIAM) that stimulates
  talin and kindlin interactions between integrin β subunits and F-actin and integrin
  activation. A different inhibitory Gi protein coupled receptor, P12Y, is activated
  by ADP and inhibits AC 3, 6, or 7. ADP is released from platelet-dense granule fusion
  with the plasma membrane or OCS MRP4 that transports TXA2 and ADP. These activation
  events initiate the synthesis of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) or
  TXA2 from arachidonic acid (AA). TXA2 is synthesized after conversion of AA and
  oxygen (O2) by cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) to prostaglandin G2 and then H2 (PGG2, PGH2)
  followed by the final conversion by thromboxane A synthase (TXAS)'
