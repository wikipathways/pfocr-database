caption: Selected essential fatty acids molecular mechanisms. In the liver, apolipoprotein
  B100 (ApoB 100) is synthesized and translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  for appropriate folding and stabilization. After proper lipidation, primordial VLDL
  (pre-VLDL) particles are formed and transported to the Golgi for further maturation.
  VLDL are further lipidated and mature VLDL are secreted to the circulation as a
  triglyceride rich lipoprotein (mature VLDL). DHA produces a post-ER, pre-secretory
  proteolysis of apoB 100 which lowers VLDL secretion and reduce hypertriglyceridemia.
  DHA-induced lipid peroxides have been suggested to induce ApoB 100 aggregation and
  further degradation by autophagy. Superoxide radicals (SO) might be a major player
  in DHA-induced ApoB 100 degradation. In macrophages and fat cells, saturated fatty
  acids induce inflammation and insulin resistance. The G protein-coupled receptor
  120 (GPR120) is the receptor through which DHA inhibits multiple inflammation cascades
  in macrophages and reverse insulin resistance. Long chain ω-3 fatty acids, including
  DHA, activate GPR120 which through the β-arrestin pathway finally inhibit the NFκB
  and JNK-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. The specific isomer trans-9,
  trans-11 of conjugated linoleic acid (t9, t11 CLA) is proposed to activate the nuclear
  receptor liver X receptor (LXR) and induce cellular cholesterol efflux by increasing
  the expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Certain
  unsaturated fatty acids degrade ABCA1 protein through the phospholipase D2 and protein
  kinase C delta (PKCδ) pathway. The isomer cis-9, trans-11-CLA induce the scavenger
  receptor CD36 expression in macrophages and repress its expression in adipocytes.
  In adipocytes different CLA isomers have been proposed to induce the expression
  of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) or the glucose transporter type 4
  (GLUT4) and repress the expression of CD36, cAMP responsive element binding protein
  5 (CREB5) or ABCA9. CLA effects through the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator
  activated receptors (PPARs) which trigger multiple biochemical pathways have also
  been described.
