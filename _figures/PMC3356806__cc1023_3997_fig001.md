caption: Molecular roles of CS proteins. CSA and CSB operate in DNA repair as components
  of the TC-NER pathway which removes RNA polymerase blocking lesions and in repair
  of endogenous DNA damage in the nucleus and mitochondria by interacting with BER/SSBR
  proteins and stimulating removal of base damage. CSB acts in basal nuclear transcription
  by promoting elongation by RNAPI and RNAPII and plays a larger overall role in transcriptome
  regulation/programming. CSA and CSB both physically interact with p53 and stimulate
  Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53. In the absence
  of CSA or CSB, Mdm2 ubiquitination of p53 is lower, stabilizing p53 and promoting
  pro-apoptotic signals through p53 dependent transcriptional programming.
