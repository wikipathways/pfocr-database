caption: The intensity of the stimulus that induces DNA damage and the degree of activation
  of PARP1 determines the fate of a cell toward survival or death. Destination 1.
  When a slight damage occurs in DNA by endogenous or exogenous agents, PARP1 recognizes
  these damage points; PARylates itself, histones, and structural chromatin-related
  proteins; and finally promotes recruitment of DNA repair enzymes. If the DNA is
  repaired successfully, cells will survive. The effect on nuclear NAD+/ATP never
  leads to energy collapse. Destination 2. Multiple intense damage that despite the
  activity of PARP1 never will be repaired successfully. The cell enters in irreversible
  apoptosis, effector caspases 3 and 7 degrade PARP1 as the main competitor for the
  ATP, and the “eat-me” signal will appear on the cell surface. Destination 3. Excessive
  DNA damages, though not necessarily lethal, produce a phenomenon of overactivation
  of PARP1 and over-PARylation in nucleus. The energy consequences are lethal for
  cells, and the nuclear pool of NAD+/ATP will be seriously affected. Poly(ADP-ribose)
  glycohydrolases and ADP-ribose hydrolases mediate a rapid turnover and recycling
  of the bulk of PAR modification on nuclear PARylated proteins, autoPARylated PARPs,
  and free chains of ADP-ribose. The free monomers and little PAR chains are exported
  to cytosol to induce mitochondrial AIF translocation to nucleus. Finally, cell will
  die in a non-caspase-dependent process or PARthanatos. Overactivation of PARP1 consumes
  both NAD+ and ATP in nucleus triggering a high imbalance in the total pool of energy
  in the cells. This total energy collapse alters the functions of the main energy
  organelles such as mitochondria, ribosomes, or endosomes, favoring a total energy
  imbalance. At the same time, the presence of PAR chains and free ADP-ribose monomers
  in the cytosol modifies enzymes such as RIP1, triggering necroptosis. As an alternative
  to death by necroptosis, autophagy appears as an adaptive pathway to try to alleviate
  the energy crisis and prevent cell death arising. The nature of the stimulus and
  its durability will determine recycling of damage organelles, misfolded proteins,
  or lipid aggregates. PARylation could be considered a highly dynamic posttranslational
  modification of several proteins forming the autophagosome core or targeting intracellular
  components to be degraded. At the same time, cells are given an alternative source
  of energy until the damage is repaired or the stress situation ceases.
