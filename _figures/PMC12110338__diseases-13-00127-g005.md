caption: Potential GLP-1RA influence on Hsp70 in skin cells. The figure shows a cross-section
  of skin highlighting keratinocytes and the proposed effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists
  on Hsp70 expression. GLP-1RAs bind to the GLP-1 receptor, activating the ERK signaling
  pathway, which may lead to increased Hsp70 production. Hsp70, shown both inside
  and outside cells, functions in cellular protection and immune signaling. While
  direct skin evidence is lacking, the diagram illustrates a speculative pathway linking
  GLP-1RA, ERK activation, and heat shock protein-mediated immune modulation
