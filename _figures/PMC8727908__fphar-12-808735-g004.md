caption: Cross-talk of innate inflammation with the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)
  regulates the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP). The rnase activity of the IRE1α
  kinase mediates splicing of the XBP1 mRNA transcript forming XBP1s. Recent advances
  have shown that activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) interfaces with the UPR. Here
  IKK is required for phosphorylation of XBP1s on Ser 48 (pXBP1). In addition, IKKβ
  forms a complex with pXBP1s; the complex translocates into the nucleus. The IKK-pXPB1s
  complex is required for HBP activation, necessary for GFPT2 expression, restoration
  of proteostasis, and maintenance of XBP1 expression through an autoregulatory loop.
