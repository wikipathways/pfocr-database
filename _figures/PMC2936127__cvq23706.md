  Central to the control of mitochondrial fission is the protein, Drp1, whose activity
  is regulated by phosphorylation. Cytosolic calcium overload (such as in ischaemia)
  induces mitochondrial fission by two mechanisms: (i) increasing the activity of
  calcineurin mediated dephosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser637 or (2) by increasing the
  activity of CaMkII which phosphorylates Drp1 at Ser637. In addition, in both the
  diabetic heart and the non-diabetic heart, hyperglycaemia induces mitochondrial
  fission through Drp1,, through a mechanism which is dependent on reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). Mitochondrial fission results in mitochondria which are more susceptible
  to mPTP opening, which results in cell death at the time of myocardial reperfusion.
  The phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser637 by PKA prevents the translocation of Drp1
  to the mitochondria and inhibits the process of mitochondrial fission. PKA can be
  activated using cAMP analogues, or by exercise or β-adrenergic stimulation using
  isoproterenol., Our recent preliminary data suggest that the cytokine erythropoietin
  can also induce mitochondrial fusion through the activation of Akt in cardiac cells,
  but the mechanism downstream of Akt remains underdetermined. However, one downstream
  target of Akt is the eNOS–NO–cGMP–PKG pathway which has recently been reported to
  phosphorylate and inhibit the pro-fission activity of Drp1. The mitochondrial division
  inhibitor-1 (mdivi-1) is a recently described small molecule inhibitor of Drp1,
  which has been demonstrated to limit both myocardial and renal ischaemic injury.
  In addition, the over-expression of Mfn1, Mfn2, and Drp1K38A can inhibit mitochondrial
  fission and promote survival in a cardiac cell line. However, both OPA1 and Mfn2
  have a number of pleiotropic effects which appear independent of their pro-fusion
  effects. The inhibition of mitochondrial fission or the promotion of mitochondrial
  fusion prevents mPTP opening at reperfusion promoting cell survival. Recently, the
  mPTP has been demonstrated to play a role in signalling to the cell that a mitochondrion
  needs to be removed by autophagy.'
