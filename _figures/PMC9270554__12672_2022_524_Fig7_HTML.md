caption: A simplified diagram representing some relevant anabolic and catabolic pathways
  intersecting at mitochondria that may be relevant in metabolic plasticity of BC-K562
  cells and the paradoxical effects of drugs under hypoxia. The Krebs cycle can operate
  as a source of biosynthetic precursors through cataplerotic pathways such as citrate
  efflux, but must be compensated by anaplerotic pathways such as glutaminolysis as
  a source of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG). A truncated Krebs cycle may operate in reverse
  sense even under complete absence of oxygen (anoxic glutaminolysis), or may operate
  in forward sense, generating FADH from succinate at ETC complex II, even with very
  low oxygen (forward Krebs glutaminolysis). However, forward Krebs glutaminolysis
  coupled to citrate efflux requires continuous supply of acetyl-CoA. This is inhibited
  by ATO and improved by DCA. In addition, ATO partially inhibits 2-oxoglutarate-dehydogenase
  (2-OGDH). ROS-mediated damage to the ETC by ATO and CCCP may be reduced under lack
  of oxygen. The graph shows in light pink some genes significantly upregulated under
  hypoxia compared to normoxia (p-value < 0.05) in untreated BC-K562 cells (GSE144527),
  and how citrate efflux appears coupled to cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis.

  hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA, and the remaining are conventional gene symbols (https://www.genecards.org)
