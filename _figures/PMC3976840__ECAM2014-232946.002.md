caption: FASN related metabolic and signal transduction pathways. De novo fatty acid
  synthesis is an important hallmark of cancer cells, differentiating it from normal
  cells. Palmitate is the primary synthesized 16-carbon fatty acid, from which other
  lipids are also formed. FASN is the key enzyme for the synthesis of palmitate and
  it affects the amount of palmitate formed. The overexpression of FASN allows for
  the de novo synthesis of essential lipids for the formation of cell membrane and
  for the production of extra energy via beta-oxidation and lipid modification of
  proteins. The binding of the growth factor and the growth factor receptor results
  in the activation of their downstream PI3k-Akt and ERK1 (and ERK2) signal transduction
  pathway. The FASN expression is regulated by several growth factors, including epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, steroid hormone, and steroid hormone receptors
  (such as ER, PR, and AR). However, there is complicated regulation of FASN expression
  by these growth factors. FASN expression and growth factor-dependent signaling are
  coregulating.
