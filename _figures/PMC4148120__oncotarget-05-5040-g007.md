caption: 'A: In absence of MEK inhibitor, BRAFV600E activation leads to the ERK1/2-dependent
  induction of SPRED genes, which block RAS signaling downstream of RTKs in melanoma
  cells. This results in low PI3K pathway activity. When cells are exposed to genotoxic
  stress, PUMA is induced and cells undergo apoptosis. B: Application of MEK inhibitor
  abolishes the expression of SPRED1 and SPRED2 and thereby relieves the negative
  feedback on RTK signaling. As a result, the PI3K pathway is activated. This prevents
  the induction of the apoptosis promoter PUMA in response to genotoxic stress and
  allows enhanced survival and protection from apoptosis.'
