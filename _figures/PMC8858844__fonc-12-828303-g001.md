caption: Four prestigious pathways indicated in mechanisms of pyroptosis. Of note
  is that the canonical pathway is composed of inflammasomes, caspase-1, and GSDMD.
  Moreover, the inflammasome complex consists of PRRs (NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, and AIM2),
  procaspase-1, and ASC, with the last one being dispensable in NLRC4 inflammasome.
  Different PRRs constitute corresponding types of inflammasomes and recognize different
  types of PAMPs or DAMPs. After recognition of PAMPs or DAMPs, the assembled inflammasomes
  activate caspase-1, thus cleaving GSDMD. The gasdermin pore formed by N-terminus
  of GSDMD results in pyroptosis characterized by outlet for IL-1β and IL-18, influx
  of sodium with water, swelling of cells, and finally osmotic lysis. In the non-canonical
  pathway, LPS derived from gram-negative bacteria could trigger pyroptosis through
  activating caspase-4, -5, and -11 to cleave GSDMD. Besides, the activated caspase-11
  could also inspire the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. As for the caspase
  3/8-dependent pathway, activated RIPK1 by inhibition of TAK1 helps caspase-8 to
  cut GSDMD and to mediate pyroptosis while the activated caspase-3 by chemotherapeutic
  drugs could split GSDME, leading to pyroptosis as well. In the granzyme A/B-dependent
  pathway, Gzm B released by CAR T cells could induce GSDME-modulated pyroptosis by
  both direct cleavage of GSDME and indirect cleavage of GSDME via activation of caspase-3,
  while cytotoxic lymphocyte-released Gzm A cleaves GSDMB to induce pyroptosis.
