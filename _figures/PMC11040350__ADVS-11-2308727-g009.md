caption: Schematic illustration of PL720 cascade targeted therapy for MI/R in mice.
  When PL720 is administered at ischemia‐ reperfusion phase, it effectively targets
  the site of injury. Upon reaching the lesion site, the encapsulated L‐arginine is
  released to facilitate the production of NO for timely vasodilation. Simultaneously,
  the slow‐released FTY720 within the injured myocardium activates the AKT pathway
  in cardiomyocytes to alleviate cardiomyocyte apoptosis. When administered at the
  late perfusion inflammation phase, the PL720 captured monocyte (monocyte‐PL720 aggregates)
  is recruited to the heart lesion. Recruited monocytes in the heart differentiate
  into macrophages, and subsequently, the macrophages phagocytize PL720. With the
  sustained release of FTY720, the STAT3 signaling pathway of macrophages is activated,
  thereby promoting macrophage polarization. This process reduces sprouting vessel
  degeneration caused by long M1 subtype macrophages while increasing M2 subtype macrophages
  to promote the maturation and quiescence of sprouting vessels.
