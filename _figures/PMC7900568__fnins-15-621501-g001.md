caption: cGAS-STING pathway and type-I IFN signaling. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
  released from damaged cells or following pathogen infection is taken up cells into
  the cytosol where it is detected by the enzyme cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) which
  synthesises the cyclic di-nucleotide 2′3′-cGAMP from GTP and ATP. 2′3′-cGAMP is
  detected by stimulator of interferon genes (STING) residing on the endoplasmic reticulum,
  and once activated, STING oligomerises and translocates to the Golgi apparatus where
  it recruits kinases tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IκB kinase (IKK). TBK1 recruits
  and phosphorylates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IKK recruits and phosphorylates
  nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). IRF3 and
  NF-κB translocate to the nucleus and upregulate the production of type-I IFNs, which
  through their receptors interferon alpha and beta receptor subunits 1 and 2 (IFNAR1
  and IFNAR2) activate Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). JAK1 and
  TYK2 activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1 and
  STAT2), which phosphorylate IRF3, IRF7 and IRF9 to stimulate the transcription of
  interferon stimulated genes (ISG) in the nucleus. Image created with BioRender.com.
