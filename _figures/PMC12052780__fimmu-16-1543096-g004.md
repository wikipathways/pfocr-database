caption: The figure illustrates how various molecular factors drive TAM polarization
  and chemoresistance in the OC microenvironment. pGSN, secreted by OC cells, promotes
  chemoresistance by inhibiting M1 macrophages’ anti-tumor functions and favoring
  M2 dominance. FPR2 activates RhoA, enhancing cell migration and fostering an immunosuppressive
  M2-supporting environment. GATA3, highly expressed in HGSOC, promotes M2 polarization,
  aiding tumor growth and chemoresistance. St3gal3 supports immune evasion by increasing
  M2 macrophages, while ADM drives M2 polarization through RhoA signaling. TRAIL,
  on the other hand, induces M1 polarization, boosting anti-tumor immunity. CPNE1
  and POSTN further increase M2 prevalence, supporting tumor progression. Various
  ncRNAs (miR-21, miR-141-3p, miR-217, LncRNA-Xist) and circITGB6 regulate polarization
  and chemoresistance by targeting key pathways, with miR-21 enhancing M2-related
  chemoresistance via PI3K/AKT. These factors collectively establish a tumor-promoting
  environment, revealing potential therapeutic targets to improve OC treatment
