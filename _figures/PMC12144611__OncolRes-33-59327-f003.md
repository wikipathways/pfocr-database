caption: Intrinsic mechanisms in CD24-mediated chemoradiotherapy resistance. (A) p38
  MAPK pathway. In the CD24-dependent MAPK pathway, the sustained activation of the
  ERK and p38 MAPK genes promotes the expression of the Bcl-2, which in turn enhances
  the drug resistance and migration capabilities of tumor cells. (B) STAT3 pathway.
  The expression of CD24 can activate the phosphorylation of STAT3, inhibit E-cadherin,
  and regulate EMT, which leads to the loss of intercellular adhesion in tumor tissue
  and promotes tumor metastasis. (C) PI3K-AKT pathway. CD24 facilitates chemoresistance
  in cancer cells by recruiting PTEN to the lipid raft domain and activating autophagy
  through the PTEN/AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway. (D) The activation of the Hippo signaling
  enhances the activity of transcription factors YAP and TEAD, promoting the expression
  of the CD24 gene. High expression of CD24 competitively binds to GIT2 with Arf-6,
  increasing the stability of Arf6/GTP, activating the downstream ERK pathway, and
  promoting tumor cell metastasis and macrophage phagocytosis. Figure created with
