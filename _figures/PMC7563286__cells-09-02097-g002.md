caption: Central metabolic pathway mapping of the results obtained from the comparison
  of simulated metabolic flux when the cells were grown at (A) low temperature (22
  °C) and (B) high temperature (40 °C), in comparison to that of the control (35 °C),
  on the template of KEGG -map01100, https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html#global,
  by using the KEGG Mapper tool. The key enzymes (star-shaped nodes) are annotated
  with numbers, which are in the list of . Major metabolites (black-bordered white
  circles) are labeled in gray boxes, while the pathway names are labeled in violet.
  The blue, red and light green lines represent upregulated, downregulated and unchanged
  or insignificantly changed fluxes. The gray line represents the reaction with a
  simulated flux level of ≤0.
