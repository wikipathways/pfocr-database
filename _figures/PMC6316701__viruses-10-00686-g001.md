caption: 'The SUMO cycle. SUMOylation is processed in five major steps: 1. Maturation:
  The immature form of SUMO is processed by specific proteases (SENPs) (to expose
  its C terminal diglycine (GG) motif (X: any amino acid). 2. Activation: in an ATP
  consuming reaction, the E1 activating enzyme (SAE1/2) activates the matured SUMO
  to form a high energy thioester bond. 3. Conjugation: SUMO is then transferred to
  the E2 conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) and form a thioester bond. 4. Ligation: SUMO is
  conjugated to its substrate with the help of an E3 ligase and 5. DeSUMOylation:
  SUMO can be removed from its target substrate by SENPs and engage in a new cycle.'
