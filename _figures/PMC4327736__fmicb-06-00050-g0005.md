caption: Proposed model of negative regulation of autophagy during Yp infection. Pathway
  map for regulation of the autophagy process highlights proteins that were identified
  by the RPMA analysis (Yellow star). Red lines depict inhibitor signals and green
  lines depict activation. The RPMA results demonstrate activation of AKT and p53,
  and inhibition of AMPKα-1, during Yp infection. In addition, immunofluorescence
  data (Figure ) shows a dramatic increase in cytoplasmic localization of p53 protein
  during Yp infection, and also the LC3-I to LC3-II conversion is significantly reduced
  (Figure ). These findings together suggest coordinate negative regulation of autophagy
  in human bronchial epithelial cells following infection with Yp.
