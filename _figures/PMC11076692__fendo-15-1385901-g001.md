caption: Genes and mechanisms of sex determination. The proliferation of cells from
  the mesonephros and coelomic epithelium leads to the formation of an undifferentiated
  and bipotential gonad. This process is regulated by several factors, including GATA4,
  EMX2, CBX2, LHX9, and WT1. These factors, in turn, regulate NR5A1, SIX1, SIX4, TCF21,
  and members of the IGF family, leading to the formation of an undifferentiated gonad.
  The process continues until the fate of the gonad is established, resulting in the
  formation of either an ovary or a testis. Ovarian differentiation. In the XX fetuses
  (absence of SRY), the expression of SOX9 remains low and other factors such as NR0B1,
  FOXL2, WNT4, and RSPO1 become dominant. The upregulation of WNT4 and RSPO1 leads
  to the activation of the canonical WNT signaling pathway, which in turn upregulates
  and stabilizes β-catenin. The activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway plays a crucial
  role in the differentiation of the female gonad. NR2F2 has a role in maintaining
  a multipotent state in early supporting gonadal cells, which seems to be necessary
  for commitment to ovarian development. After birth, FOXL2 continues to suppress
  male-specific factors, including SOX9 and DMRT1. Testicular differentiation. In
  XY fetuses, the expression of SRY is triggered by MAP3K4, GATA4, WT1, and NR5A1.
  The presence of SRY and NR5A1 initiates the expression of SOX9, which leads to the
  differentiation of pre-Sertoli cells and subsequent Sertoli cells. Other members
  of the SOX family are also upregulated. SOX9 expression is maintained through positive
  feedback loops involving FGF9 and PGD2, as well as the regulation from WT1 and NR5A1.
  The increased expression of SOX9 prevails over NR0B1, FOXL2, WNT4, and RSPO1, promoting
  testicular differentiation. After birth, DMRT1 suppresses the female-specific factor
  FOXL2. These interactions between the male and female pathways remain essential
  throughout adulthood to maintain the gonadal identity
