caption: Diagram of crosstalk between the MAK-2 pathway, the CWI/MAK-1 pathway and
  the STRIPAK complex. A cyan “P” indicates canonical MAPK cascade phosphorylation,
  and a yellow “P” indicates MAK-2-dependent phosphorylation. MAPK pathway proteins
  are purple, the STRIPAK complex is blue, and pink transcription factors (PP-1 and
  ADV-1) are downstream of all three signaling components. MAK-2 is required for activation
  or de-repression of PP-1, and MAK-1 regulates ADV-1 in a PP-1-independent manner.
