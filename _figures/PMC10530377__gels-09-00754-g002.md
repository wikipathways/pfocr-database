caption: It is commonly accepted that dysregulation of NF-κB can lead to autoimmune
  diseases, chronic inflammation, and cancer. This scheme demonstrates the especially
  important role of ECM stiffness. Advanced age, bacterial and viral infection, and
  particles from air pollution reinforce the ECM, and increased stiffness activates
  the NF-kB pathway and causes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, leading to cancer
  initiation. The polyphenol curcumin can inhibit NF-κB due to Nrf2 activation and
  can retard cancer initiation.
