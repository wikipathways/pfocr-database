caption: Map showing relationship between genes positively correlated with plasma
  estradiol superimposed on Ingenuity map. Pathway analysis was carried out on 98
  positively correlated genes (P < .005), and functional annotation revealed a network
  of 29 genes related through known estradiol- and progesterone-related signaling
  pathways. Genes correlated with plasma estradiol are shown in red, and the intensity
  of red coloration reflects the degree of correlation.
