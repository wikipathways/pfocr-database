caption: Metabolites identified in the PHA synthesis pathway during batch cultivations
  of R. eutropha H16 and R. eutropha Re2058/pCB113 with nitrogen limitation occurring
  after 24 h and 30 h, respectively. Identified metabolites are highlighted by green
  boxes, whereas not identified metabolites are surrounded by red boxes. Enzymes involved
  in PHA synthesis are indicated at the respective reaction steps (Re = Ralstonia
  eutropha, Pa = Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ra = Rhodococcus aetherivorans). The asterisk
  indicates that R/S- forms were not differentiated. Concentration profiles are shown
  as boxplot diagrams (n = 3) showing the median (solid line), the standard error
  (box), the mean value (yellow square) and the minimum and maximum values (whiskers).
  Different colors are indicating different sample time points.
