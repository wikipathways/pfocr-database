caption: Conservation of signalling pathway proteins in Myxococcaceae. Regulatory
  proteins are shown as ovals. Positive regulation is shown with pointed arrows, and
  negative regulation with blunt-headed arrows. (A) Carotenoid production. In the
  dark (top), CarQ is held inactive by CarR, while CarA and CarH repress expression
  of the constitutively active crt promoter. In the light (bottom), CarH is directly
  inactivated while CarF inactivates CarR, releasing CarQ to direct transcription
  of carQRS, producing CarS which binds to CarA, relieving repression of the crt genes,
  which encode enzymes for the biosynthesis of carotenoids (lycopene shown as an example).
  (B) Fruiting body formation. Gene products work together in modules (dark grey boxes).
  Starvation triggers the production of the secondary messengers c-di-GMP and (p)ppGpp
  and activates the EBP (enhancer binding protein) cascade and the Mrp module. The
  A-signalling, C-signalling, FruA and Nla24/DmxB modules are stimulated by secondary
  messengers and regulatory modules. Various ‘development timer’ proteins regulate
  the timing of fruiting, and the DevTRS/CRISPR module modulates the timing of sporulation.
  ‘Other’ proteins regulate fruiting, but their relationship to other modules is not
  clear. (C) Quorum signalling. Four common Gram-negative bacterial quorum signals
  (AI-I, AI-II, CAI-I and HAI-I), and their corresponding synthase and receptor/regulator
  proteins, are shown. Also shown is the quorum-quenching AHL acylase, PvdQ. Whether
  regulatory proteins are core, conserved, or dispensable, is indicated based on their
  pattern of evolutionary conservation. Core proteins are found at a constant number
  per genome across the Myxococcaceae and are highlighted in bold text. Conserved
  proteins are found in all groups of Myxococcaceal genomes, but in variable numbers,
  and are indicated with a pale grey background and dashed outline. Dispensable proteins
  are absent from some groups of Myxococcaeal genomes and are shown with a transparent
  background, and grey text.
