caption: Proposed mechanisms involved in in vitro anticancer activity of surfactin.
  The anticancer activity of surfactin is associated with growth inhibition, cell
  cycle arrest, cell death (apoptosis), and metastasis inhibition. Surfactin treatment
  can inhibit cancer cell viability by inactivating the cell survival signaling pathways.
  Besides, surfactin regulates cell cycle-regulatory proteins, which are pivotal for
  cell cycle phase transition to block the proliferation of cancer cells. The apoptotic
  effect (intrinsic mitochondrial/caspase pathway) of surfactin is mediated by two
  different pathways that are triggered by high intracellular ROS formation, namely
  ERS/[Ca2+]i/ERK1/2 and JNK/ΔΨm /[Ca2+]i/Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio/cyt c pathways. Surfactin-induced
  apoptosis is also associated with the changes in phospholipids composition that
  leads to a significant decrease in unsaturated degree of cellular fatty acids. Apart
  from these, surfactin also inhibits the invasion, migration and colony formation
  of cancer cells in the virtue of MMP-9 expression change that involves the inactivation
  of NF-κB, AP-1, PI3K/Akt, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.
