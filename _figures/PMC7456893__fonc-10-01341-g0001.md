caption: The canonical and the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. (A) In canonical
  Wnt signaling, β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3β and CK1α in the absence of
  Wnts, followed by ubiquitination by β-TrCP and targeting for proteasomal degradation,
  without nuclear β-catenin; a repressive complex containing TCF/LEF and Groucho/TLE
  subsequently recruits HDACs to inhibit the transcriptional activation of β-catenin
  target genes. Conversely, the activation of canonical Wnt signaling is initiated
  from the binding of Wnts to Fzd and co-receptor LDL receptor-related protein (LRP5
  or LRP6); then, the DVL is phosphorylated by GSK-3β and CK1α and begins to form
  a polymer that can inactivate the destruction complex through recruiting AXIN and
  GSK3β. Thereby, the accumulated β-catenin in the cytoplasm localizes to the nucleus
  and forms complexes with co-regulators of transcription factors such as TCF/LEF
  by removing Groucho/TLE complexes and recruiting transcriptional co-activators,
  including CBP/p300, BRG1, BCL9, and Pygopus. Next, downstream genes including cyclin
  D, MMPs, c-Myc, COX2, CD44, etc., are activated and give rise to the changes of
  the series of cellular activities, such as excessive cell proliferation, motility,
  and polarity. (B) The β-catenin-independent non-canonical Wnt signaling is initiated
  by binding certain Wnts and could regulate cellular polarity and migration-related
  signaling pathways. In the Wnt/PCP pathway, Wnts bind to the ROR1/2-Fzd complex
  to activate DVL, DVL binds to small Rho GTPases such as RAC1 and RhoA, RhoA and
  RAC1 together trigger JNK, and RhoA activates ROCK alone. This leads to the asymmetric
  cytoskeletal organization and/or coordination of cellular polarization via activating
  the transcription factors, such as c-JUN and ATF2. The Wnt/Ca2+signaling triggers
  PLC activity and subsequently induces calcium influx; then, elevated Ca2+ activates
  several calcium-dependent signaling pathways, such as PKC and Ca2+/CAMKII, which
  finally leads to the accumulation of transcription factor NFAT in the nucleus. ATF2,
  activating transcription factor 2; BCL9, B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9; BRG1, brahma-related
  gene 1; β-TRCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein; CAMKII, calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II; CK1α, casein kinase 1; COX2, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2;
  DVL, disheveled; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase; HDACs, histone deacetylases;
  JNK, JUN N-terminal kinase; LEF, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor; MMPs, matrix
  metalloproteinases; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; PCP, planar cell
  polarity; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; ROCK, rho kinase; ROR1/2,
  receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1/2; TCF, T-cell factor; TLE, transducin-like
  enhancer protein.
