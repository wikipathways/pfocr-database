caption: 'Flow diagram of the comoRsoftware. Step 1: comoR takes as input preliminary
  diagnosis data of a patient. Step 2: It preprocesses and updates required databases,
  performs statistical computation (hypergeometric and semantic similarity tests),
  and calculates relative risks and ϕ-correlation (Pearsons correlation for binary
  variables) between diseases. Step 3: Comorbidity scores and disease network are
  provided as a result to the user. Step 4: Causal inference graphical models with
  the R package pcalg. Step 5: Visualisation of the comorbidity map and survival probability
  of patient considering comorbidity4. This map could be extended to incorporate diet
  and exercise as in []. Symbols D, g, P and DOID are used to indicate disease, gene,
  pathway and disease ontology id respectively.'
