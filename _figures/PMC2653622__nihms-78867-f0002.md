caption: (A) In the absence of Shh, Ptch localizes to the primary cilium and, through
  an unknown mechanism, prevents Smo from entering the cilium. Gli2 and Gli3 are phosphorylated
  by kinases, including PKA, CKI and GSK3, to generate phosphopeptide binding motifs
  for β-TrCP, which recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Ubiquitination of Gli2
  and Gli3 targets these proteins to the proteasome, which processes Gli3 into a carboxy-terminal-truncated
  repressor form and degrades Gli2. Gli3 subsequently enters the nucleus and inhibits
  transcription of downstream Hh target genes such as Ptch1 and Gli1. (B) In the presence
  of Shh, Ptch is internalized, allowing Smo to traffic into the primary cilium. It
  is unclear whether Smo traffics directly to the cilium, or accumulates first in
  the plasma membrane. At the cilium, Smo inhibits the formation of Gli3 repressor
  and activates Gli2, which enters the nucleus to promote transcription of Ptch1 and
  Gli1, whose protein products negatively and positively feed back on this pathway,
  respectively.
