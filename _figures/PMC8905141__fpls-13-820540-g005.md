caption: Metabolic pathways and the mutual regulation relationships in different treatments.
  The pathway notes and arrows in different colors represent the regulation pathways
  for different treatments. Red represents the common regulation pathway of NaCl treatments
  (YCK and YP treatment) and Na2CO3 treatments (JCK and JP treatment), yellow represents
  the regulation pathway of NaCl treatments (YCK and YP treatment), and blue represents
  the regulation pathway of Na2CO3 treatments (JCK and JP treatment). The ellipse
  indicates the obviously changed transcription factors, and the bold font indicates
  the differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs). The data in the box represents
  the average expression of metabolites for the two treatments (log2FC), in which
  red indicates upregulation, and blue indicates downregulation.
