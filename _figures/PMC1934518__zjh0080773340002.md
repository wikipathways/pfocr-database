caption: Schematic representation of ligands identified for EpCAM and possible functions
  related to them. (1) The extracellular domain of EpCAM interacts with a second EpCAM
  molecule resulting in homotypic cell-cell adhesion, hence, the name epithelial cell
  adhesion molecule. (2) EpCAM directly interacts with claudin-7, a protein required
  for the formation of tight junctions, again implying a role of EpCAM in cellular
  adherence. (3) EpCAM directly interacts with CD44v4-v7 (carcinoma-associated variants
  of CD44). The exact consequence of this interaction remains to be elucidated. (4)
  EpCAM indirectly associates with E-cadherin. The adaptor proteins that facilitate
  this complex formation have yet to be identified. (5) EpCAM forms a primary complex
  with CD9 in the tetraspanin web. (6) Direct interactions of α-actinin with the intracellular
  domain of EpCAM links this molecule to the cytoskeletal organization. (7) EpCAM
  modulates the expression of NF-κB, c-myc, and E-FABP. The molecular pathway of this
  modulation has not yet been found. We propose that a proteolytic cleavage in the
  extracellular domain may initiate a signaling cascade that results in the augmented
  expression of NF-κB, c-myc, and E-FABP. The interplay of EpCAM with E-cadherin (4)
  and CD9 (5), as well as the influence of EpCAM on NF-κB, c-myc, and E-FABP (7) provides
  a link for its involvement in cell migration, metastasis, and cell signaling. ECM,
  extracellular matrix; E-FABP, epidermal fatty acid-binding protein.
