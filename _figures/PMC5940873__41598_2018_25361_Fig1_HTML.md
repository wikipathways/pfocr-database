caption: Biosynthetic pathways for BCAA. In the first reaction acetolactate synthase
  (ALS) condenses one pyruvate with another into 2-acetoacetate (for valine and leucine)
  or with 2-ketobutyrate to form 2-aceto-2-hydroxybutyrate (for isoleucine). Both
  products are then isomerized and reduced via keto-acid reductoisomerase (KARI) to
  form 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate and 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylvalerate, respectively.
  In this unusual two-step reaction, each substrate undergoes Mg2+-dependent alkyl
  migration followed by NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of the 2-keto group. Dihydroxyacid
  dehydratase (DHAD) converts two products of the second step to 2-ketoisovalerate
  and 2-keto-3-methylvalerate, respectively. The final step in the parallel pathway
  is conducted catalysed by amino transferase, which yields the final products of
  valine from 2-ketoisovalerate and isoleucine from 2-keto-3-methylvalerate. In contrast,
  a series of more additional enzymes are necessary to sequentially divert 2-ketoisovalerate
  to the leucine production pathway.
