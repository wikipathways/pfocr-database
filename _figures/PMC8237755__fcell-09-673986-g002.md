caption: WIP controls neurite initiation and extension in primary neurons. The scheme
  represents some of the signaling involved in the contribution of WIP in neurite
  extension. The WIP knockdown increased neurite protrusion and elongation in a neuronal
  model in which the high level of insulin is the main growth factor. WIP not only
  has a cytoskeleton dependent role, but also governs signaling through mTORC1- and
  Abl family kinases-dependent modulation of the S6K pathway, which controls neuritic
  extension and branching.
