caption: 'Figure 5. Involvement of AMPK in mitotic progression. The activity of AMPK
  progressively increases as cells move from G1-phase toward the G2/M stage of cell
  cycle. During M-phase AMPK is described to phosphorylate key substrates that regulate
  mitotic progression, including PAK2, PPP1R12C, and ACC. The AMPK α2β2γ2 enzymatic
  complex is believed to be responsive for this action. Phosphorylation of MLRC leads
  to regulation of the mechanical cytoskeletal events participating in mitosis. Abbreviations:
  PAK2, p21-activated protein kinase; PPP1R12C, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit
  12C; MRLC, myosin regulatory light chain; ACC, acetyl-CoA-carboxylase.'
