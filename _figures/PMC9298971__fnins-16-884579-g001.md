caption: 'Brain insulin resistance. Peripheric insulin reaches its targets in the
  brain mainly through three approaches: (1) passive extravasation of the fenestrated
  capillaries and ependymal cells of the median eminence; (2) transcytosis from the
  blood-brain barrier; (3) tanycyte-mediated transport from cerebrospinal fluid. However,
  under the overnutrition condition, brain insulin transportation is declined. In
  the CNS, insulin exerts its effects via central insulin signaling cascade. Insulin
  binds to insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) or insulin receptors (INSR) expressed
  on the endothelial cells. After receptors recognition, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway is activated. PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3),
  while Akt promotes the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and represses the
  expression of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) within the neuron. This brain insulin
  signaling is impaired during central insulin resistance, which is appeared to be
  reduced phosphorylation of insulin receptors, insulin receptor substrates, and Akt.
