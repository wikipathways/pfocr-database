caption: (1) Binding of recombinant TGF-β1 to TGFBR2. (2) Receptor activation and
  heterotetramer formation by TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 dimers. (3) Phosphorylation of TGFBR1
  by TGFBR2. (4) Stimulation of the Smad signaling pathway by Smad2/3 phosphorylation
  via TGFBR1. This step is efficiently blocked by the inhibitor SB431542 resulting
  in loss of Smad2/3 phosphorylation. (5) Association of Smad4 with p-Smad2/3 and
  transport to the nucleus. (6) Binding of the p-Smad2/3-Smad4 complex to transcription
  factors (TFs). (7) Enhanced mesenchymal gene expression and (8) repression of epithelial
  gene expression. (9) Messenger RNA production of mesenchymal genes. (10) Transport
  of mRNA and translation of mesenchymal proteins in the cytoplasm. (11) Secretion
  of latent TGF-β and matrix metalloproteases (e.g. MMP2). (12) Cleavage of latent
  TGF-β e.g. by MMP2. (13) Binding of active TGF-β to its cognate receptor.
