caption: The ES-EB system has made possible the identification of multipotent progenitors
  for both hemato-vascular and cardio-vascular derivatives. As indicated in the schematic,
  pluripotent Oct4+ ES cells commit to an early bipotential germ layer phenotype called
  mesendoderm that is brachyury (Bry) positive. The initial Flk1/Vegf receptor positive
  cells that emerge (Flk+) generate tri-potential hemangioblasts (Hgb) that are capable
  of generateing hematopoietic (HM), endothelial (EN), and smooth muscle (SM) cells,
  which are Gata2, CD31, or smooth muscle actin (Sma) positive, respectively. Subsequently,
  a second wave of Bry+/Flk+ cells gives rise to a distint cardio-vascular progenitor
  (CVP) that can generate EN or a more restricted Nkx2.5+ and cKit+ bipotential CVP.
  The latter is capable of generating CM or SM progenitors. Canonical Wnt signaling
  acting through beta-catenin (Wnt/beta-cat, dashed lines), functions throughout these
  transitions enhancing both early Hgb and CVP devlelopment, and in both cases subsequently
  repressing their generation. In the case of the CVP, endoderm that develops in association
  with the precardiac mesoderm expresses antagonists of this Wnt/beta-cat pathway
  and thereby induces cardiogenesis. The Hemato-vascular studies are primarily from
  G. Keller and colleagues, while the identification of CVPs is described in the text.
