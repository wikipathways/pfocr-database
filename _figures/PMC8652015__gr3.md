caption: Amino acid neurotransmitters regulate the pathological mechanism of breast
  cancerA. GABAA and GABAC receptors are ionotropic channels, whereas GABAB receptors
  are metabotropic. ABAT is a key enzyme in GABA metabolism that catalyzes the degradation
  of GABA to produce succinic semialdehyde and l-glutamic acid, thereby contributing
  to reducing GABA levels. The downregulation of ABAT expression in basal cell-like
  breast cancer may be due to GABA-mediated activation of the Ca2+-NFAT1 axis. In
  addition, GABAB1e (GB1e) may significantly enhance the cloning and microsphere formation
  ability of MCF-7 cells through endoplasmic reticulum stress and further activates
  the MAPK/AKT/ERK signaling pathway to promote breast cancer cell proliferation,
  migration, and invasion. B. Neuronal nAChRs are categorized as heteropentamers and
  homopentamers. Their structures and pharmacological functions are different. When
  activated by an agonist, the influx of Na+ and Ca2+ and the efflux of K+ occurs,
  regulating the expressions of MAPK, PKC, VEGF, etc. These proteins are closely associated
  with the occurrence and development of breast cancer.
