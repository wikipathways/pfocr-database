caption: Disulfide HMGB1 binds to MD-2 and activates the TLR4 receptor complex via
  two separate intracellular signal pathways. Proinflammatory cytokines are formed
  when the adapter molecule TIRAP gets associated with toll-like receptor 4 and the
  myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) that activates the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  Interferon-β is produced when TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule) associates with
  TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β).
