caption: Metabolic pathways and relative levels of metabolites in cucumbers from two
  different soils. The relative levels of metabolites are represented as fold changes
  normalized using the average of all values. The metabolic pathway was modified based
  on the KEGG database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/). L, low-nutrient soil; H, high-nutrient
  soil
