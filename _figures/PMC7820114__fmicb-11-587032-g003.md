caption: 'Metabolic changes within the TCA cycle during growth of S. solfataricus
  P2 on phenol. Relative metabolite concentrations (squares) were expressed as fold-changes
  compared to the reference D-glucose. transcript abundance (solid circles) and flux
  distributions (dashed circles) were expressed as Log2 fold-changes compared to the
  reference D-glucose. Dotted arrows indicate multiple enzymatic reactions. Note that
  the fold-changes of spermidine and norspermidine exceeds the color scale with values
  of 28 and 30, respectively. This pathway is available at MetaboMAPS (accession:
  P103).'
