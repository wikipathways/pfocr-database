caption: a Populations of, and transitions between, key species involved in the stereodetermining
  steps of the reaction. PC photocatalyst, SET single-electron transfer. b Lowest
  energy constrained transition states for Si-E TS-8′ and TS-8′-H, showing the most
  important non-covalent interactions between the sidechain and pyrrolidine substituents,
  calculated at the [SMD(DME)-B2GP-PLYP-D3BJ/def2-TZVPP//SMD(DME)-PBE0-D3BJ/def2-SVP]
  level of theory. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. Blue = hydrogen bonding.
  Green = dispersion interactions.
