caption: 'Mammalian sex determination: a molecular view. Factors implicated in formation
  of the bipotential gonad and differentiation of the ovary and testis are shown.
  Testis determination is initiated by SRY; however, molecular downstream targets
  of SRY and direct connections of SRY with other regulatory factors are undetermined.
  During testis differentiation, Sox9, SF-1 and WT-1 regulate MIS. SF-1 also directs
  expression of steroidogenic enzymes to produce testosterone and the Insl-3 factor,
  which is required for proper testis descent. Mutation of SRY, SOX9, SF-1, or WT1
  leads to 46,XY sex-reversed females. An additional dose of the DAX1 gene (or increased
  DAX1 protein) is postulated to result in 46,XY sex reversal by direct antagonism
  of SF-1. By contrast, Wnt-4 blocks production of testosterone and therefore may
  block segments of the male program in the ovary. The placement of DMRT1 in this
  pathway remains uncertain. Cross-regulation of SRY, SOX9, SF-1, WT-1, and DAX1 may
  occur at multiple levels and is not depicted here.'
