caption: Immunopathological interactions in tuberculosis-associated hemophagocytic
  lymphohistiocytosis (TB-HLH). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) infects macrophages
  (M), leading to an antigen presentation to CD8 + T cells via Major Histocompatibility
  Complex Class I (MHC-I). This interaction stimulates CD8 + T cells to produce interferon-gamma
  (IFN-γ), which further activates macrophages. These activated immune cells release
  a range of cytokines including IFN-γ, CXCL9, TNF-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6,
  IL-10, IL-12, and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), contributing to the clinical symptoms
  of HLH. Natural killer cells and/ or CD8 +, which are typically involved in the
  clearance of infected or activated cells, are shown to be dysfunctional, as indicated
  by the cross symbol. This dysfunction, and a lack of granzyme and perforin, exacerbates
  the ongoing inflammatory response. Of particular note is the role of IL-18 and IL-12,
  which are thought to enhance the production of IFN- γ by CD8 + T cells, feeding
  into a self-amplifying cycle of immune activation [2, 51–54]. In disseminated TB
  infection, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) on macrophages, initiating the NF-κB signaling pathway and augmenting
  the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-18, and
  IL-12. This cascade leads to the activation of CD4 + T cells, which contribute to
  the pool of IFN-γ and further perpetuates the inflammatory cycle [5–8, 55]. The
  convergence of these pathways may precipitate a cytokine storm integral to the pathogenesis
  of both disseminated TB and HLH. This hyperinflammatory state can resemble HLH,
  complicating the distinction between primary HLH and TB-induced HLH. Consequently,
  the application of anti-tuberculosis treatment emerges as a critical therapeutic
  measure. The question mark (?) depicted in the schematic indicates the potential
  involvement of IL-12 and IL-18 in activating HLH via the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  This hypothesis remains to be fully elucidated, pointing to a gap in our current
  understanding and necessitating further research
