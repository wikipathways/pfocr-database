caption: The Chronic effect of exercise on the ER stress-associated apoptosis and
  inflammation. Regular exercise reduces phosphorylation of the three ER stress sensors
  and inhibits or decreases ER stress-associated apoptosis and inflammation signaling
  pathways. Exercise training ameliorates ER stress-mediated CHOP signaling, in turn
  reducing apoptosis. Exercise training also reduces IRE1α-mediated p38 MAPK/JNK and
  NF-κB-associated inflammasome regulating the expression of caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-6,
  and MCP-1, mitigates the IRE1α/TRAF2/ASK1 complex that links to caspase-12, and
  mediates apoptosis in cardiovascular disease. As a result, these signaling pathways
  systemically mediate eNOS expression through the decreased apoptosis and inflammation,
  which increase NO bioavailability and improve endothelial function. The yellow arrows
  represent the exercise-induced changes in ER stress-mediated apoptosis and inflammatory
  pathway.
