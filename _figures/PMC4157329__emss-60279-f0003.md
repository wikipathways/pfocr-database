caption: 'Prior pathology and superimposed systemic inflammation interact to produce
  acute and transient working memory deficits: towards reconciling cholinergic and
  inflammatory hypotheses of delirium. This scheme shows the basal forebrain cholinergic
  nuclei (BFCN), illustrating the septohippocampal pathway, the ventral diagonal band
  projections to the amygdala and piriform and insular cortices and the nucleus basalis
  projection to the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices (after Wolff 1991). Intracerebroventricular
  injection (left panel) of the ribosomal toxin saporin, linked to an antibody against
  the p75 neurotrophin receptor, which is enriched on BFCN cells, induces selective
  neuronal death in these regions. This approach facilitates targeted, selective and
  limitable lesioning of this area and consequently decreased cholinergic tone (shown
  in grey, right panel) in these projection fields. In lesioned animals, LPS induces
  acute and transient working memory deficits, resembling delirium. Neither lesion
  nor LPS alone were sufficient to induce such deficits. LPS-induced CNS inflammatory
  responses were equivalent in lesioned and non-lesioned animals and the acetylcholinesterase
  inhibitor donepezil could block these deficits (). This model serves as a useful
  exemplar of how systemic inflammation in ‘vulnerable’ animals may be used to interrogate
  aspects of delirium pathophysiology.'
