caption: Defects and mutations resulting in mucocutaneous candidiasis. Candida albicans
  is recognized by dectin 1/2 in dendritic cells, which induces the CARD9-mediated
  transcription of IL-23. IL-23 is recognized by IL-23R, which is expressed by TH17,
  innate lymphocyte and γδT cells. This induces IL-17A and IL-17F expression, which
  modulate the immune response by inducing the expression of antimicrobial peptides
  and chemokines through binding to IL-17RA. TH17 differentiation and IL-17 cytokine
  expression is positively regulated by STAT3, whereas STAT1 activation antagonizes
  TH17 cell differentiation. Mucocutaneous candidiasis is caused by various defects
  in this immune response pathway, including (i) IL-17RA deficiency, (ii) autoantibodies
  for IL-17, (iii) lack of expression of IL-17F, (iv) mutations resulting in the dominant-negative
  form of STAT3, (v) expression of a hyperactivated (Act) form of STAT1, or (vi) CARD9
  deficiency. CARD, caspase recruitment domain family; DC, dendritic cell; Dec, dectin;
  IL, interleukin; ILC, innate lymphocyte; STAT, signal transducer and activator of
  transcription; TH, T helper.
