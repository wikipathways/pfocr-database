caption: . The proposed mechanism through which electric stimulation hyperthermia
  treatment (ESHT) improves prostatitis. With ESHT, levels of HSP70 and suppressor
  of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) significantly increase, leading to binding and inhibition
  of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/MyD88 polymers. With the TLR4-nuclear factor
  kappa B (NF-κB) pathway blocked, the expression of NF-κB also decreases. Without
  the regulation by NF-κB in the nucleus, inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin
  (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) will not be generated
  by target cells.
