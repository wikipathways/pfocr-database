caption: Fig. 5. Schematic illustrating the difference in the telomere damage signaling
  pathways in human and mouse cells. Telomere damage created by telomere shortening
  or removal of TRF2 is proposed to activate the same signaling pathway. The sensor(s)
  upstream of p16 and p53 have not been identified. In human cells, cell cycle arrest
  in response to telomere damage can be transduced through either the p53 or the p16/Rb
  pathways. In mouse cells, the telomere damage signal is transduced only through
  the p53 pathway. In the absence of p53, the p16/Rb pathway alone is insufficient
  to induce cell cycle arrest in response to telomere damage (shading). The arrow
  from p16 to p21 illustrates the ability of p16 to displace p21 from the CDK4/6 complex,
  resulting in a release of a latent pool of p21 that can inhibit cycE/A-dependent
  CDK2.

    The sensor(s) upstream of p16 and p53 have not been identified. In human cells,
    cell cycle arrest in response to telomere damage can be transduced through either
    the p53 or the p16/Rb pathways. In mouse cells, the telomere damage signal is

    p21 from the CDK4/6 complex, resulting in a release of a latent pool of p21 that
    can inhibit cycE/A-dependent CDK2.
