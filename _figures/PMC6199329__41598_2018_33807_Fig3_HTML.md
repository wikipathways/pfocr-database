caption: The resultant DE miRNAs were analyzed through the use of IPA (Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis, QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis)
  to explore the inversely correlated miRNA-regulated pathways and mRNA expression
  in preovulatory granulosa cells. This analysis revealed that both (A) miR-21 and
  (B) let-7 are involved in the downregulation of several important genes. (C) Putative
  crosstalk between the FOXM1 signaling pathway and miR-21 signaling. A number of
  genes and pathways are reciprocally regulated by these negatively correlated transcription
  regulators. mir-21 expression is upregulated, whereas FOXM1 expression is downregulated
  during the ovulatory process.
