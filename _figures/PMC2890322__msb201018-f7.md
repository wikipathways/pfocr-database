caption: 'Examples of the condition specific associations between metabolites and
  transcripts (A–C). Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) reveals condition-dependent
  association between response dynamics on the transcript and metabolite level: comparison
  of metabolite–transcript associations of central metabolism between control growth,
  heat stress, and stationary phase. Metabolites and genes displaying a close association
  in the CCA were extracted (; ) and projected on a schematic representation of the
  TCA cycle, glycolytic pathway, and p.p.p. Dotted lines indicate optional anaerobic
  pathways. Measured metabolites are indicated in bold. Biosynthetic genes are circled
  and regulatory genes are displayed in diamond shape. Transcripts and metabolites
  showing a close association in the CCA are indicated by the same color. With respect
  to heat stress, a selected part of the associations are shown.'
