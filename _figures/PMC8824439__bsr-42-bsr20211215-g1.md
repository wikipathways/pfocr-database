caption: The network shows metabolic intermediates; reactions for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis,
  anaplerosis (ANA), the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), methyl citrate cycle (MCC),
  methylmalonyl pathway, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and glyoxylate shunt; various
  carbon substrates including glucose, glycerol, cholesterol, and fatty acids; red
  circles as carbon atom numbers participating in CCM. Metabolites shown are MALOAA
  (malate + oxaloacetate), SUC (succinate), SUCSEM (succinate semialdehyde), ACCOA,
  PYR (pyruvate), ICIT (isocitrate), GLX (glyoxylate), OXG (α-ketoglutarate), SUCCOA
  (succinyl-CoA), FUM (fumarate), G6P (glucose-6-phosphate), F6P (fructose-6-phosphate),
  FBP (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate), GAP (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), PGA (phosphoglyceric
  acid), PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate), PYR (pyruvate), P5P (pentose-5-phosphate), E4P
  (erythrose-4-phosphate), and S7P (sedoheptulose-7-phosphate), METCIT (methyl citrate),
  METICIT (methyl isocitrate), MMCOA (methylmalonyl-CoA), ISOBUTCOA (isobutyl-CoA),
  OXBT (oxobutanoate). Figure was created with Biorender.com
