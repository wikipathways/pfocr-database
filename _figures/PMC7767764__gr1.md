caption: Lipofuscin and drusen in the RPE. A, Generation of lipofuscin bisretinoids
  in the RPE. Absorption of a photon of light by 11-cis-retinal results in its isomerization
  to all-trans-retinal. This all-trans-retinal reacts with phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) in the photoreceptor outer segment disc membrane to form a Schiff base adduct,
  N-retinylidene-PE (NRPE). The ATP-binding cassette transporter A4 (ABCA4) transports
  NRPE across the lipid bilayer to the cytoplasmic side, where it is hydrolyzed to
  release all-trans-retinal, which is then reduced to all-trans-retinol by retinol
  dehydrogenases like RDH8 in the photoreceptor cytosol. Both the all-trans and 11-cis
  isomers of NRPE are substrates of ABCA4, which limits the levels of reactive aldehydes
  in the photoreceptor disc membranes. When ABCA4 is nonfunctional, as in Stargardt
  disease, NRPE can react irreversibly with a second molecule of all-trans-retinal
  to form bisretinoids such as A2E. The precursor, A2PE, is formed from two molecules
  of all-trans-retinal and one molecule of phosphatidylethanolamine. B, Upon outer
  segment phagocytosis, phospholipase D in RPE lysosomes hydrolyzes A2PE to generate
  phosphatidic acid and A2E. In contrast to the well-characterized pathway that leads
  to lipofuscin accumulation in the RPE, mechanisms involved in the formation of sub-RPE
  and sub-retinal drusen remain to be understood.
