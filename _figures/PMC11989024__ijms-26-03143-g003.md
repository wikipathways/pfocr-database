caption: Cellular signalings and mechanisms of integrin-mediated drug resistance in
  cancer cells. Activated integrins promote multiple intracellular signaling pathways
  in cancer cells. Interaction of β1 integrin with annexin A6 secreted by cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) stabilizes β1 integrin on the cell surface of cancer cells, which
  activates the FAK/YAP signaling pathway. Interaction of α-actinin 1 with β1 integrin
  activates β-catenin signaling through the β1 integrin-mediated FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway.
  Stanniocalcin 1 binds directly to β6 integrin to activate the αvβ6 integrin-mediated
  PI3K signaling pathway. The interaction of lipocalin 2 with β3 integrin results
  in increased αvβ3 integrin stability, which in turn triggers the activation of the
  Src/Akt/ERK signaling pathway. These signals then induce pro-survival and anti-apoptotic
  signals, resulting in the acquisition of drug resistance in cancer cells
