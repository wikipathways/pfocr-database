caption: Architecture of the Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex, with FAAPs (Fanconi
  anemia–associated proteins) indicated by numbers. The FAAP20-FANCG-FANCA subcomplex
  (red dotted line) is a link between the translesion synthesis (TLS) complex and
  the FA pathway through a direct interaction between FAAP20 and REV1, which interacts
  with REV3-REV7 (purple dotted line). FANCA gains its stability by binding to FAAP20,
  a small UBZ4-containing zinc finger protein that prevents its SUMOylation and RNF4-mediated
  degradation. The ternary complex FANCF-FANCC-FANCE (orange dotted line) bridges
  FANCD2, the substrate to the ICL-recognizing anchoring complex consisting of FANCM
  and FAAPs (gray solid line). Current understanding of mechanisms of FANCD2 monoubiquitination
  derived from biochemical and genetic approaches suggests that the FANCB-FANCL-FANC100-UBE2T
  complex (yellow dotted line) is a minimum module for FANCD2 and FANCI monoubiquitination.
