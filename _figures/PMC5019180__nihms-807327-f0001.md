caption: 'Glycolysis, braking down glucose to pyruvate, is yielding low amounts of
  ATP, yet provides important intermediary metabolites for anabolic reactions and
  shapes T cell immune functioning. In mitochondria, full oxidation of pyruvate greatly
  increases the bioenergetic efficiency of cells. C3b–CD46-medited signaling enhances
  both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration (1). Oxygen is toxic and inevitably
  linked with oxidative molecular damage brought by reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  However, evolution has incorporated ROS as indispensible signaling molecules, and
  triggering intracellular C5aR1 via C5a during T cell activation impacts on oxygen
  metabolism and mediates increased production of ROS (2). Mitochondria are furthermore
  key organelles in orchestrating programmed cell death, which is triggered by the
  release of cytochrome c and increased ROS production. In T cell homeostasis, complement
  drives pro-survival pathways. Specifically, C3a generated intracellularly binds
  it receptor, C3aR, expressed on lysosomes, thereby maintaining constant low-level
  activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which in turn controls
  glycolysis and mitochondrial function and biogenesis (3). Yet, context specifically,
  complement also plays critical roles in the regulation of apoptosis: While C3b–CD46-mediated
  signals counteract apoptosis in stimulated cells via Bcl-2 expression induction
  (4), local generation of C5a can activate the same anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 pathway
  but also promote apoptosis via autocrine C5aR1 signaling via the extracellular signal
  regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (5). Of note, the role(s) of the alternative C5aR2
  in these pathways is currently least well understood. Gluc=glucose; G6P=glucose-6-phosphate;
