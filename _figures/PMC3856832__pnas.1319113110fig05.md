caption: Dynamics of starch biosynthetic enzymes during seed development. Heat maps
  depict the relative abundance of individual proteins throughout development. The
  green “P” denotes tissues in which the corresponding phosphoprotein was detected.
  The starch biosynthesis pathway was adapted from Comparot-Moss and Denyer ().
