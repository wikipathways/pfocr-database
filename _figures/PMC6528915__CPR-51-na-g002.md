caption: Overview for the regulatory mechanisms upstream and downstream of ZEB1‐AS1
  in cancer progression. The hypomethylation of ZEB1‐AS1 promoter upregulates ZEB1‐AS1
  expression. ZEB1‐AS1 increases ZEB1 expression by competitively binding to miR‐200s,
  which directly targets ZEB1. ZEB1‐AS1 also enforces ZEB1 expression by recruiting
  MLL1 or p300 to the promoter region of ZEB1. ZEB1‐AS1 induces the EMT by increasing
  ZEB1, N‐cadherin, MMP2, MMP9 and integrin‐β1 expression, and decreasing the expression
  of E‐cadherin. ZEB1 inhibits miR200c expression, and miR200c suppresses BMI1 expression,
  suggesting that ZEB1‐AS1/ZEB1/miR200c/BMI1 pathway exhibits a pivotal role in tumor
  development. ZEB1‐AS1 also activates IL‐11/STAT3 signalling. In addition, ZEB1‐AS1
  can impact apoptosis‐related proteins (e.g., Bcl‐2 and Bax) and cell cycle regulators
  (e.g., Cyclin D1, CDK2 and p15) to accelerate tumor progression. ZEB1‐AS1, zinc
  finger E‐box binding homeobox 1 antisense 1. EMT, epithelial‐mesenchymal transition.
  MLL1, mixed‐lineage leukemia 1. BMI1, B cell‐specific Moloney murine leukemia virus
  insertion site 1. CDK2, cyclin dependent kinase 2. MMP2/9, matrix metalloproteinase
  2/9. IL‐11, interleukin‐11. STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription
