caption: Overview of metabolic pathways of L-arginine. Pathway players not investigated
  in the current study are indicated by the grey color, while the analyzed pathway
  metabolites are depicted in rectangular frames, and enzymes in elliptical frames.
  Inhibitory effects are marked by black blunt-ended arrows—dashed if the effect is
  weak. ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine; SDMA, symmetric dimethylarginine; DMA,
  dimethylamine; ASL, argininosuccinate lyase; ARG1,2, arginase 1 and 2; ASS1, argininosuccinate
  synthase 1; CATs, cationic amino acid transporters; DDAH1,2, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase
  1 and 2; NO, nitric oxide; NOS2, nitric oxide synthase 2; ODC1, ornithine decarboxylase
  1; PRMT, protein arginine methyltransferase.
