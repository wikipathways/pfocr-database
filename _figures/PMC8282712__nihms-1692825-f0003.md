caption: 'Incorporation of 15N from 15N-ammonia into different 15N-metabolites is
  indicated in green. Incorporation of 13C from [1,2-13C2]-Glucose into different
  metabolites is indicated in red and blue. [1,2-13C2]-Glucose can be converted to
  [1,2-13C2]-G6P, which can be metabolized through the glycolysis and produce [13C]-metabolites
  (indicated in red). [1,2-13C2]-G6P can also be metabolized through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP). The [1,3-13C2]-F6P and [1-13C1]-F6P produced in the PPP can enter
  into the glycolysis and contribute to the synthesis of [13C]-metabolites (indicated
  in blue). Not all the possible reactions between unlabeled, [13C]-metabolites, and
  [15N]-metabolites are represented in this figure. Abbreviations: α-KG, α-ketoglutarate;
