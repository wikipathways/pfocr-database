caption: (A) RT induces local immunogenic effects. Radiation stimulates the generation
  of damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in cancer cells, including CRT,
  extracellular ATP, histones, and HMGB1. These factors interact with immune cells
  like DCs and macrophages to further induce antitumor immune responses mediated by
  Th17 cells and CTLs. (B) The microbiota affects the antitumor response induced by
  RT. Radiation causes translocation of microbiota, while the components change. This
  disrupts the local immune balance and promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines,
  leading to mucositis. CRT, calreticulin; HMGB1, high mobility group box 1 protein;
  CTLs, cytotoxic T lymphocytes; Th17, T helper 17 cells; IL‐1, interleukin‐1; IL‐6,
  interleukin‐6; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IFN‐γ, interferon‐γ. (C) Intratumoral
  bacterial Fusobacterium nucleatum could be involved in the 5‐FU chemoresistance
  by activating the innate immune pathway TLR4/MyD88. (D) Microbial β‐glucuronidases
  can give rise to an increase of the irinotecan active metabolite (SN‐38), which
  is associated with the occurrence of severe diarrhea. (E) Mycoplasma hyorhinis can
  directly degrade the pyrimidine nucleoside analogues (PNA) by its thymidine phosphorylase
  activity. (F) Bacteroides, dominant members of intestinal microbiota, have a high
  activity of sorivudine conversion to an intermediate (BVU), which inhibits the degradation
  of 5‐FU and results in its accumulation in the blood and then in a higher toxicity.
