caption: a | Stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-driven inflammation-associated
  cancer. Carcinogens such as 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (DMBA) cause DNA damage,
  which can result in the leakage of DNA into the cytosol and the intrinsic chronic
  activation of the STING pathway. This event attracts phagocytes that engulf damaged
  cells. The self-DNA from engulfed cells can extrinsically activate STING in the
  phagocytes, which results in the production of more cytokines and growth factors
  that can activate tumour growth-promoting pathways as well as attract more immune
  cells to the region. b | STING and wound repair function. Carcinogens and inflammatory
  agents such as azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) also cause DNA
  damage that can result in the leakage of DNA into the cytosol and cause activation
  of the intrinsic STING pathway in intestinal cells. This event produces cytokines
  such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or IL-18 that enable wound repair to commence. Loss
  of STING prevents wound repair from occurring and may enable the infiltration and
  growth of genotoxic bacteria that trigger STING-independent inflammation and perhaps
  cancer (not shown). c | STING-dependent antitumour cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)
  priming. Dying tumour cells are engulfed by antigen-presenting cells such as CD8α+
  dendritic cells (DCs). DNA from the engulfed cell triggers STING-dependent cytokine
  production in the phagocyte, which facilitates cross-presentation and antitumour
  CTL responses. Agonists of STING have been shown to exert potent antitumour activity.
  CDN, cyclic dinucleotide; cGAS, cyclic GMP AMP synthase; IFN, interferon; TCR, T
  cell receptor.
