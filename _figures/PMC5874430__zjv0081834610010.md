caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) diagram of the cell cycle control pathway.
  IPA software was used to identify pathways that are enriched in the set of 1,433
  genes that were present in three of three biological replicates for WT-infected
  TIVE-EX-LTC cells. Genes that are targeted by KSHV miRNAs are highlighted in purple.
  Ovals, transcription regulators; downward-pointing triangles, kinases; upward-pointing
  triangles, phosphatases; dotted squares, growth factors; circles, other; double-walled
  shapes, complexes/groups; diamonds, enzymes. TGF-β, transforming growth factor β;
  HDAC, histone deacetylase.
