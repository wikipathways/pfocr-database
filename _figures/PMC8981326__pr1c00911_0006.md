caption: Biosynthetic pathway of GSLs with related genes encoding for the GTs involved
  in the biosynthesis. The three main GSL groups of globosides, (neo)lacto-series,
  and gangliosides are highlighted in pink, purple, and blue, respectively. GTs that
  showed a positive correlation with a relevant GSL group or glycosylation trait are
  given in red. TFs in the boxes showed a positive correlation with the corresponding
  group of GSL glycans. Double arrows imply the further elongation of GSLs.
