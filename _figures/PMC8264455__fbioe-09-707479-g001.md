caption: Nrf2 pathway and related antioxidant therapy. Nrf2 pathway and related antioxidant
  therapy. This figure shows the activation of the Nrf2 pathway and effects of antioxidant
  therapy targeting this pathway. Under unstressed conditions, Keap1 interacts with
  Nrf2 and the cell’s actin cytoskeleton to keep Nrf2 inactive in the cytoplasm and
  promote ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. Oxidative stress causes Nrf2 to
  detach from Keap1 and translocate to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with Maf.
  The Nrf2-Maf heterodimer binds to ARE to induce the expression of antioxidant and
  metabolic genes including NQO1, MnSOD, HO-1, GCL, and GSTs. Oxidative stress can
  be regulated by activating the Nrf2 pathway. siKeap1 downregulates the levels of
  Keap1 by incorporating into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and inducing
  degradation of the complementary mRNA of Keap1. Nrf2 activators, such as SF, CA,
  DMF, RTA408 and genistein, stimulate the Nrf2 pathway and ameliorate oxidative stress.
