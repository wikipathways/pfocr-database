caption: The mechanisms of action of neuroprotective agents that are in clinical trials.
  Rasagiline shows neuroprotective properties by suppressing mitochondrial apoptosis
  stopping the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPT) opening by inhibiting
  caspase-3, nuclear poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) activation, stopping
  the translocation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and halting
  nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Rasagiline increases the expression of the anti-apoptotic
  proteins B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) through
  the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, in addition to down-regulating the pro-apoptotic
  Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). Minocycline
  inhibits the inflammatory response to prevent cell death and it chealates metals.
  Creatine inhibits activation of the MPT and represses iron (Fe2+) accumulation.
