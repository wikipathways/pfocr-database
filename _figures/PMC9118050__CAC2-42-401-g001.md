caption: 'Potential therapeutic role of fibroblasts in in vitro studies. Tumor cell‐derived
  Hh activates fibroblasts via the PTCH/SMO pathway, which is a target of the SMO
  inhibitors Vismodegib and Sonidegib. HA secreted by CAFs reshapes the ECM and protects
  tumor cells from drugs. Hyaluronidase degrades HA, exposing tumor cells to therapeutic
  drugs. CAFs promote tumor growth by secreting PIK3Cδ, which can be inhibited by
  CAL‐101. The angiotensin inhibitor losartan suppresses tumor growth by binding to
  ACE2 receptor. TGF‐β is a critical mediator between CAFs and tumor cells. Binding
  between TGF‐β and TGF‐βR can be blocked by IN‐1130, Ki26894 and YR‐290. The FGF
  inhibitors lucitanib, erdafitinib, AZD4547 and Futibatinib block the binding of
  FGF and FGFR, suppressing tumor growth and overcoming resistance to fulvestrant
  and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Abbreviations: Hh, hedgehog; SMO, smoothened, frizzled class
  receptor; HA, hyaluronan; ECM, extracellular matrix; CAF, cancer‐associated fibroblast;
  ACE2, angiotensin converting enzyme 2; TGF‐β, transforming growth factor beta; TGF‐βR,
  transforming growth factor beta receptor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast
  growth factor receptor; CDK, cyclin dependent kinase'
