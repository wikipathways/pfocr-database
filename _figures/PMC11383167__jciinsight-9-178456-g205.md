caption: (A) Schematic depicting the IFN signaling pathway, which is constitutively
  activated in Aicardi Goutières Syndrome and other genetic interferonopathies. Stimulation
  at the IFN receptor results in expression of IFN signaling genes via the JAK/STAT
  pathway. The STAT/IRF9 complex binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE),
  leading to the transcription of IFN-signaling genes (ISG). The mRNA levels of these
  ISGs can be quantitated and combined as an “IFN-stimulated gene expression score,”
  a surrogate for IFN pathway activity. Various mathematical approaches have been
  used to calculate this score. AGS, Aicardi Goutières Syndrome; JAK, janus kinase;
  JAKi, JAK inhibitor; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; ISRE,
  IFN-stimulated response elements. Made with BioRender. (B) Concert Diagram for sample
  ISG testing and validation
