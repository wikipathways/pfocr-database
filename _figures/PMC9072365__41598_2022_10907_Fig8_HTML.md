caption: Signaling pathway overview. Hyperglycemia stimulates mesangial production
  of IL-1β which activates PDGF-BB secretion. In turn, PDGF-BB promotes IL-1β secretion,
  sustaining and boosting the pathway activation. IL-1β and PDGF-BB stimulation give
  rise to the production of phosphorylated sphingoid bases, activating COX-2 transcription.
  At the same time, IL-1β and PDGF-BB stimulate cPLA2 activation. Arachidonic acid
  (AA) released by cPLA2 is converted into prostanoids by COX-2 and downstream enzymes.
  The other product of cPLA2, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), is converted into lysophosphatidic
  acid (LPA) by autotaxin. Thus, hyperglycemia triggered the activation of an interplay
  between IL-1β and PDGF-BB which stimulates the secretion of lipid hormones (prostanoids
  PGE2, PGI2, but also lysophosphatidic acid) with hemodynamic, proliferative, and
  migratory effects at glomerular level. Inhibition of the cPLA2 reaction with AACOCF3
  blocks the supply of AA for the COX-2 reaction, thus resolving the inflammatory
  stimulus. In addition, LPC is not produced, and this blocks the supply for the autotaxin
  reaction and LPA mediated proliferative response.
