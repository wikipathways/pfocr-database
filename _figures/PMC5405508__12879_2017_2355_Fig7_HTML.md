caption: 'Network analysis of inflammatory genes modulated in response to V3000 and
  V3034 infections in spleen. Genes significantly modulated against (a) V3000 and
  (b) V3034 infection in the spleen were used to perform in silico network analysis
  using the Ingenuity Pathway analysis software. V3000 infection resulted in increased
  inflammation by upregulating the genes associated with activation of myeloid cells,
  antigen presenting cells, phagocytes/macrophages and leukocytes unlike V3034, which
  only resulted in activation of leukocytes at 24 h pi. Legends: : leads to activation,
  : effect not predicted, : upregulated, : downregulated, : not expressed; intensity
  of the color is directly proportional to the level of modulation'
