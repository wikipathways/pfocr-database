caption: Rab GTPase Ryh1 cross-activates the cell integrity pathway (CIP) through
  two independent mechanisms. TORC2 target Gad8 cooperates with TORC1 target Psk1
  to increase Pck2 protein levels and promote activation of MAPK Pmk1during growth
  and stress. Alternatively, Ryh1 elicits plasma membrane targeting and/or stabilization
  of several upstream activators of the CIP (Ksg1 (PDK), Rgf1 (Rho1 GEF), and Pck2).
  PI kinase Its3 and PI(4,5)P2 promote Ryh1-TORC2 signaling and activation of the
  CIP, and in this later case might act as Ryh1 effector. In addition, activated Pmk1
  decreases TORC2-Gad8 signaling in response to stress by downregulating Ryh1 activation
  cycle. Coordinated activation/deactivation of TOR and CIP signaling allows precise
  cell adaptation to multiple environmental cues.
