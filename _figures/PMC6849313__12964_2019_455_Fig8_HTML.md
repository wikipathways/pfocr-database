caption: Injury-induced epithelial and interstitial Notch1 activity contributes to
  myofibroblastic phenotype and fibrosis. Injury stimulates the activation of the
  Notch1 signalling pathway in TECs and fibroblasts. Activated Notch1 signalling starts
  with a TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signalling cascade, which induces the EMT and FMD response,
  promotes myofibroblastic phenotype and ECM deposition, and results in interstitial
  fibrosis. Pharmacologic or genetic blockade of Notch1 signalling decreases TGF-β1
  expression and abolishes injury-mediated EMT/FMD, myofibroblastic phenotype and
  fibrosis
