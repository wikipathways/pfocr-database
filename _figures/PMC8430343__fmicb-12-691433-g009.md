caption: Regulation of pyomelanin synthesis in A. alternata. Here, we report that
  when A. alternata is grown in MM medium, no precursor of HGA is present, thus there
  is no formation of pyomelanin and the DHN-melanin pigment is formed. In MMT medium,
  L-tyrosine leads the production of large concentrations of HGA that accumulates
  in the cell and is released into the medium leading to the formation of pyomelanin.
  There is inhibition of DHN-melanin synthesis. The fungus turns brown. In MMP medium,
  L-phenylalanine, a L-tyrosine precursor is progressively converted into L-tyrosine
  by PhhA and also leads to the formation of HGA, but to a lower extent than with
  L-tyrosine supplemented into the medium. This is probably due to the progressive
  conversion of L-phenylalanine into L-tyrosine. As L-tyrosine is formed, it is converted
  into hydroxyphenylpyruvate that is then converted into HGA. This compound is degradated
  into fumarate and acetoacetate (catabolism of L-tyrosine pathway) leading, consequently
  to low HGA accumulation and efflux out of the cell and low pyomelanin formation.
  The DHN-melanin synthesis is inhibited leading to an albino-like phenotype.
