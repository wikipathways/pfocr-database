caption: 'Differentially methylated genes enriched in the adipocytokine signaling
  pathway. (A) Genes differentially methylated in the promoter region. (B) Genes differentially
  methylated in the gene body regions. The colors of the ellipses were shaded according
  to significance level. Red: the DNA methylation levels of the control group were
  significantly higher than those in the high carbohydrate (HC) group [log2ratio(control/HC)
  ≥ 0 and corrected p ≤ 0.05]. Green: the DNA methylation levels of the control group
  were significantly lower than those in the HC group [log2ratio(control/HC) ≥ 0 and
  corrected p ≤ 0.05]. Gray: not significantly changed.'
