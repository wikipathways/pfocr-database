caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanisms underlying the secretome of hDPSCs
  in protecting C2C12 myoblasts against hypoxia-induced injury. Left: Under normoxic
  conditions, Wnt ligands are bound to receptors on the cell membrane, followed by
  the inactivation of GSK-3β after phosphorylation at S9 and β-catenin gradually accumulates
  and is transferred into the nucleus to promote the transcription of downstream target
  genes. Middle: Under hypoxic conditions, the relevant Wnt ligands do not bind to
  the receptor and β-catenin is phosphorylated to degrade after binding GSK-3β, thereby
  inhibiting cell proliferation and myogenic differentiation. Right: The secretome
  of the hDPSC-activated Wnt1/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway is at least partly
  responsible for these protective effects under hypoxia. The hDPSC secretome can
  attenuate hypoxia-induced myoblast injury by alleviating the inhibition of viability
  and promoting myogenic differentiation. GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; hDPSCs, human
  dental pulp stem cells; HIF, hypoxia inducible factor.'
