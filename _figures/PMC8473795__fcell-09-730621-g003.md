caption: The role of glycocalyx in endothelial dysfunction and inflammation NLRP3
  inflammasome activates to release IL-1 1L-18, and destroys endothelial glycocalyx.
  These mediators possess properties of pro-inflammatory activation. IL-1 and IL-18
  binding to its cell surface receptor to activate intracellular signaling molecules
  MyD88, which then causes NF-κB activation. The activation of NF-κB signaling pathway
  increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines
  to mediate the adhesion of leukocyte and promote leukocyte extravasation. All of
  these reactions increase endothelial dysfunction by altering cell contractility
  and disrupting intercellular connections.
