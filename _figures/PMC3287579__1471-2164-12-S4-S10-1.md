caption: Adapted from []. Molecules including protein, hormones and second messengers
  in signal transduction pathways during ABA response. Small black filled circles
  represent putative intermediary nodes mediating indirect regulatory interactions.
  Arrowheads represent activation, and short perpendicular bars indicate inhibition.
  Light blue lines denote interactions derived from species other than Arabidopsis;
  dashed light-blue lines denote inferred negative feedback loops on pHc and S1P.
  Nodes involved in the same metabolic pathway or protein complex are bordered by
  a gray box; only those arrows that point into or out of the box signify information
  flow (signal transduction). The variable elements of the wild network are marked
  with colored ellipses and those with same color are in the same boolean State. The
  nodes that are held in a fixed state are marked with uncolored ellipses.
