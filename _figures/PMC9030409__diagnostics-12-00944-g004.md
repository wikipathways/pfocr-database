caption: 'Current and future activators of NIS symporter in treating radioiodine refractory
  disease: MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) (RAS/RAF/MEK) and Phosphoinositide
  3-kinases (PI3K/protein kinase B, AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)) are
  key signaling pathways in thyroid cancer pathogenesis. Signaling cascades can be
  blocked by new targeted therapies. The crosstalk between MAPK and PI3K through RAS
  represents a tumor escape mechanism from known multi-kinase inhibitors and selective
  inhibitors of BRAF. The PI3K-AKT pathway activation leads to suppression of NIS
  glycosylation and surface translocation. The inhibition of mTOR promotes redifferentiation
  of thyroid cancer cells by upregulation of NIS mRNA and protein expression through
  increased transcription of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1). Another important
  positive regulator of NIS expression is Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). TSH
  signals through the heterotrimeric G-protein complex and through activation of cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) increase transcription of the NIS gene. Aberrant
  activation of the MAPK signaling pathway inhibits Phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor
  biosynthesis class U protein (PIGU) expression and NIS basolateral transport. Pituitary
  tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) and pituitary binding factor (PBF) overexpression
  results in decreased NIS levels in thyroid cancer. Genetic and epigenetic alterations
  in the RTK/BRAF/MAPK/ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways by acquired point mutations,
  chromosomal rearrangement, or aberrant gene methylation underlies the diminished
  NIS signaling central to RAI refractoriness. First, BRAF activates TGFβ-transforming
  growth factor β)/Smad3 signaling, which directly impairs the ability of the thyroid-specific
  transcription factor paired box gene 8 (PAX8) to bind the NIS promoter in follicular
  cells. Second, BRAF epigenetically regulates NIS by driving histone deacetylation
  of the H3 and H4 lysine residues of the NIS promoter, directly preventing its transcription
