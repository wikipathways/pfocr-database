caption: The plotted KEGG model represents the microvillus of a photoreceptor cell
  with the major proteins in the pathway shown by rectangles. Photoreceptors use the
  pigment rhodopsin (bottom grey panel) to absorb light, after which phospholipase
  protein C (PLC), upon activation via rhodopsin and the G-protein Gq, hydrolyzes
  phosphatidyl-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate diacylglycerol (DAG),
  inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and a proton, resulting in the activation of
  two classes of Ca2+-permeable cation channels, TRP and TRPL () (top right). Several
  components of the cascade, including TRP, PLC, and protein kinase C (PKC), are assembled
  into multimolecular signaling complexes by the scaffolding protein INAD (), which
  has been suggested to be linked to the central F-actin filament via the ninaC class
  III myosin () (bottom centre). The electrical impulses generated by light absorption
  reach the brain through the visual fibres of photoreceptor cells, which extend into
  the optic lobes (; ). Results of Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 are shown in separate
  panels with quadrants within each protein-rectangle showing differences in the expression
  of the underlying coding genes of the first treatment group in each pair-wise comparison,
  relative to the second treatment group as shown above each of the figure panels
  (red for up-regulation, green for down-regulation, grey if no significant difference
  between treatments was detected but the gene was expressed in our datasets, white
  if the gene was not expressed).10.7554/eLife.45009.009Figure 2—source data 1.Table
