caption: The potential role of NETs in tumor progression and metastasis. As scaffolds,
  NETs capture cancer cells and provide a microenvironment in which protumor genic
  proteins can be delivered to cancer cells. As part of NETs, HMGB1 is released, activating
  TLR9-dependent pathways in cancer cells. The NE released by NETs triggers the TLR-4
  receptor on cancer cells, resulting in the upregulation of PGC-1, increased mitochondrial
  biogenesis, and accelerated growth. The transmembrane protein CCDC25 on cancer cells
  senses extracellular DNA and activates the ILK-parvin pathway to enhance cell motility.
  In turn, certain factors secreted by many primary tumors have been shown to promote
  NET formation, such as cytokines (HIF-1, IL-8, IL-6), exosomes and proteases (CTSCs).
