caption: 'Interplay of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 (ACE2), the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
  system (RAAS), sex hormones, and the immune response: a potential mechanism of coronavirus
  disease (COVID) toes. Used with permission of M.A. Cappel, MD. Circled numbers indicate
  steps in the mechanism. Step 1: The cellular receptor ACE2 is critically important
  in SARS-CoV-2 infection., In addition, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)
  is essential because by cleaving cell-bound ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit
  1 (S1) from spike protein subunit 2 (S2), it facilitates viral cellular entry.,,Step
  2: Androgens and estrogens have generally opposing downstream effects on ACE2 processing,
  providing an explanation for more severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
  male patients. TMPRSS2 activity increases with androgen sensitization through dihydrotestosterone
  activation of the androgen receptor (AR). On the contrary, estrogens increase the
  expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), which competes for
  processing of ACE2 and releases a circulating form of active ACE2., Therefore, increased
  ADAM17 activity may be protective in female patients, resulting in an increased
  proportion of circulating ACE2 that binds any circulating SARS-CoV-2 and prevents
  further cell infection. Step 3: When cells are infected by SARS-CoV-2, the resulting
  virus-receptor internalization results in the decreased cell expression of ACE2
  and a relative deficiency of ACE2. In the RAAS, a delicate balance exists between
  ACE and ACE2. ACE converts angiotensin (ANG) I (ANGI) to ANGII and, with aminopeptidase,
  to ANGIII, both of which contribute to endothelial dysfunction through binding the
  angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R). On the contrary, ACE2 converts ANGI to ANG1-9
  and ANGII to ANG1-7, both of which promote healthy endothelial function through
  binding the AT2R. At baseline, because of sex hormone differences, the ACE–ANGII–AT1R
  pathway is favored in male patients whereas the ACE2‒ANG1-7‒AT2R pathway is favored
  in female patients.Step 4: These RAAS predilections may account for increased endothelial
  dysfunction in male patients compared with female patients; AT1R stimulation decreases
  nitric oxide (NO) and is vasoconstricting, prothrombotic, and pro-inflammatory;
  AT2R stimulation increases NO and is vasodilatory, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory.
  Angiotensin II–AT1R activation also potentiates endothelial dysfunction by stimulating
  aldosterone synthesis and subsequent mineralocorticoid receptor activation, with
  similar vasculopathic and pro-inflammatory effects.Step 5: Aldosterone stimulates
  mineralocorticoid receptors on dendritic cells, and ANGII stimulates AT1Rs on T
  cells and on dendritic cells; all these actions promote T-cell activation and proliferation.
  This leads to activation of interleukin 6 family (IL-6) cytokine receptors (IL-6Rs),
  which signal through the Janus kinase (JAK)‒signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) 3 pathway, and activation of the type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFN-IR),
  which signals through the JAK-STAT1 pathway., Tissue hypoxia from the related AT1R-induced
  endothelial dysfunction may also contribute through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α
  subunit (HIF-1α) in conjunction with STAT3 to increase pro-inflammatory helper T
  cell 17s (TH17s) and decrease anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs). Owing
  to sex hormone and genetic differences, female patients have a more robust IFN-I‒STAT1
  response than do male patients., Younger individuals have a stronger IFN-I response,
  which favors the development of COVID toes; in older individuals the IL-6 pathway
  may predominate, which is associated with more severe COVID-19. 5αRI, 5α-reductase
