caption: 'Schematic illustration of PSPM-NPs and SLERCC in RCC progression. High DNMT3A
  was recruited at the SLERCC promoter, which induced aberrant hypermethylation, leading
  to downregulation of SLERCC expression in RCC. PSPM-NPs transfer SLERCC plasmids
  into cells by recognizing MUC12 molecules on the RCC cell membrane surface. Elevated
  SLERCC can directly interact with UPF1 to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
  which in turn inhibits RCC metastasis and angiogenesis. Abbreviations: PSPM-NPs,
  Plasmid-SLERCC@PDA@MUC12 nanoparticles; RCC, Renal cell carcinoma'
