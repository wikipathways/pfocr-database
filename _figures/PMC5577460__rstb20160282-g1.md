caption: Schematic representation of DSB repair by NHEJ and HR. The broken DNA double
  strand ends are bound by the Ku70/80 heterodimer, which protects them from extensive
  end resection. (a) Binding and subsequent phosphorylation by DNA-PKcs marks the
  decision for repair via NHEJ pathway and the broken ends are juxtaposed. The broken
  ends are mildly processed by different nucleases, helicases and slightly extended
  by DNA polymerases, to prepare them for re-ligation via the XRCC4-LigIV-XLF complex.
  This repair mechanism is cell cycle-independent and considered to be error-prone.
  (b) Extensive end-resection by MRE11 (part of the MRN complex) and CtIP nucleases
  initiates repair via the HR pathway. The 3′-ssDNA overhangs are protected by ssDNA-binding
  protein RPA, which is consequently replaced by the recombinase RAD51 which is loaded
  by BRCA2. RAD51 initiates the homology search on the sister chromatid and strand
  invasion to copy the lost DNA region and thus perform error-free DNA repair. This
  pathway is mainly executed in late S- and G2-phases of the cell cycle, when a sister
  chromatid is available.
