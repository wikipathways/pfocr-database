caption: The relationship between zinc finger proteins and hippo pathway in cancers.
  MZF1 promote osteosarcomas through stimulation of YAP1 expression. ZFP226 was able
  to induce apoptosis by activating hippo signaling in human breast adenocarcinoma.
  Cooperation of ZEB1 and YAP stimulates and increases risk in breast cancer. CIZ1
  interacted with the transcriptional factor YAP in hepatocellular carcinoma and enhanced
  cancer growth
