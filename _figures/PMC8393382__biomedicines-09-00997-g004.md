caption: Lipid-mediated and possible direct effects of ANGPTL3 inhibitors on endothelial
  function. Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is characterized by increased apoptosis,
  expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), and impairment of nitric
  oxide (NO) synthesis. ANGPTL3 inhibitors, such as the antibody Evinacumab and antisense
  oligonucleotide (ASO), reduce circulating low density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides
  (TG), hence contrasting lipid-mediated ED. In addition, ANGPTL3 inhibitors may directly
  protect from ED by impeding the binding of ANGPTL3 to endothelial integrin αvβ3,
  thus inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling and restoring protective Notch signaling
  pathway.
