caption: We recently found that sodium-butyrate (NaBu) profoundly decreased promoter
  I.3/II-specific aromatase mRNA expression induced by PGE2 or a surrogate hormomonal
  cocktail made of dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) plus the PKC activator phorbol diacetae
  (PDA). MCM, Bt2cAMP+PDA or NaBu regulated aromatase mRNA levels or enzyme activity
  only specifically via promoters I.3/II but not other promoters. Recruitment of phosphorylated
  ATF-2 by a CRE (-211/-199) in the promoter I.3/II region conferred the response
  to malignant epithelial cells conditioned medium, PGE2 or Bt2cAMP+PDA. Malignant
  cell-conditioned medium, PGE2 or Bt2cAMP+PDA stabilized a complex comprised of phosphorylated
  ATF-2, C/EBPβ and CBP in the common regulatory region of promoters I.3/II. The inhibitory
  effect of NaBu on transcription was not accompanied by comparable changes in overall
  histone acetylation patterns of promoters I.3/II. NaBu treatment, however, consistently
  decreased ATF-2 phosphorylation and disrupted the activating complex. Taken together,
  these findings represent a novel mechanism of NaBu action and provide evidence that
  aromatase activity can be attenuated in a signaling pathway- and tissue-specific
  fashion. Our data also suggested that malignant cells secreted substances other
  than PGE2. These unknown substances were associated with signaling pathways other
  than cAMP-PKA in the activation of aromatase promoters I.3 and II.
