caption: 'E− larvae have perturbed aerobic metabolism when compared to E+ larvae.
  The outlined metabolic pathway diagram (left) shows the relationship of the metabolites
  shown in the bar chart. Solid lines indicate direct reactions and dashed lines denote
  several reaction steps between metabolites. Boxes shown in Red (increased in E−
  or Blue (increased in E+) represent metabolites that were higher in E− or E+ larvae,
  respectively. Black boxes indicate relative levels of a given metabolite are not
  shown in the figure. Data were analyzed as in . Abbreviations: CIT, citrate; ISO,
  isocitrate; AKG, α-ketoglutarate; FUM, fumarate; MAL, malate; OXO, oxaloacetate'
papertitle: Vitamin E deficiency during embryogenesis in zebrafish causes lasting
  metabolic and cognitive impairments despite refeeding adequate diets.
