caption: CD73-generated adenosine orchestrates the tumor-stroma interplay to promote
  cancer growth. The concerted action of CD39 and CD73 represents the main pathway
  for extracellular adenosine production in the tumor microenvironment. These two
  ectonucleotidases are expressed not only by tumor stromal cells (such as endothelial
  cells or tumor-associated regulatory T cells) but also by certain cancer cells,
  allowing for the conversion of extracellular ATP (released by dying tumor cells)
  into adenosine. Adenosine exerts its tumor-promoting effects in paracrine and autocrine
  fashion by activating adenosine receptors expressed by tumors cells, endothelial
  cells, or immune cells. Activation of A2A adenosine receptors inhibits IFN-γ production
  and cytotoxic killing by CD8+ T cells and promotes CD4+ cells differentiation into
  T-regulatory cells. This immunosupressive effect is strengthened by adenosine action
  on the tumor-surrounding endothelium which consists in repressing T-cell homing
  to tumors through the downmodulation of adhesion proteins such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1
  or P-selectin. Simultaneously, A2A and A2B engagement on endothelial cells also
  enhance the production of proangiogenic factors including VEGF, b-FGF, and IL-8.
  This effect is mediated by HIF-1 and synergizes with the hypoxic tumoral microenvironment.
  Finally, CD73-generated adenosine also promotes tumor development by directly acting
  on cancer cells through A2A and/or A2B adenosine receptor activation and subsequent
  enhancement of invasiveness and chemotactic response.
