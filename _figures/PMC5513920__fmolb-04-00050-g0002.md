caption: Roles of tunneling nanotubes and extracellular vesicles in pathogenesis of
  diseases. (A) TNTs and EVs transport neuropathogenic proteins and genetic content
  between neurons, astrocytes and pericytes and result into neurodegenerative pathology
  such as tauopathies and synucleinopathies including Alzheimer and Parkinson's disease.
  (B) Viruses highjack both TNTs and EVs for the propagation of viral infection. Viral
  RNA/proteins are incorporated into EVs via endosomal pathway and are transferred
  to unaffected na誰ve cells; whereas viruses may use direct transfer to na誰ve cells
  via TNTs. In both modes of propagation, the recipient cell may undergo cell death
  or transformed into infected cell pathology further spreading the infection to other
  cells. TNTs, Tunneling nanotubes; EVs, Extracellular vesicles.
