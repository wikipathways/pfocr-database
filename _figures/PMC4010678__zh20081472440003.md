caption: 'Effects of oxalate: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the IL2-R pathway. For
  these studies, renal epithelial cells were exposed to oxalate and global gene expression
  changes were monitored using the Affymetrix platform. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  software was used to analyze gene expression data and model the IL2-R signaling
  pathway by comparing global expression patterns with third-party biological databases
  to compile the complex pathways and interactions taking place in the IL2-R pathway.'
