caption: Schematic diagram of the jasmonic acid signalling pathway of T. media and
  its regulation of the paclitaxel biosynthesis pathway gene by the MYC transcription
  factor. The yellow solid line indicates that the upregulation or regulation is activated,
  the red solid line indicates a large upregulation, and the dark red solid line indicates
  a very large upregulation. The yellow dotted line indicates that there may be regulation,
  and the blue solid line indicates inhibition.
