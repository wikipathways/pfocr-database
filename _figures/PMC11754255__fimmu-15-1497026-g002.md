caption: The primary role process of CCL2 in fibrotic diseases. CCL2 facilitates the
  mobilization of monocytes from the bone marrow into the bloodstream and guides their
  migration to targeted inflammatory fibrotic areas. Once there, these monocytes differentiate
  into macrophages to address tissue damage (as exemplified by atherosclerotic plaques),
  this process is frequently associated with the activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway (as exemplified by systemic mastocytosis). Additionally, the regulation
  of CCL2 secretion is often influenced by various receptors, which in turn modulate
  the release of inflammatory mediators (as seen in fibrosis associated with chronic
  kidney disease). This figure was created with biogdp.com
