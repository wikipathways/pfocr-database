caption: Schematic representation of molecular pathways underlying the severe acute
  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) cellular invasion and injury. SARS‐CoV‐2
  invasion is mediated by the S protein binding to its ligand angiotensin‐converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is primed by type II transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS2)
  through cleaving S protein into S1 and S2 subunits to facilitate the exposure of
  receptor‐binding domain (RBD) on S1 subunit. The binding of RBD to ACE2 is followed
  by receptor‐mediated endocytosis. Activation of the renin–angiotensin system, up‐regulation
  of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α pathway and the Ras pathway following ACE2
  attachment can injure cells/tissues that highly express ACE2. *These mechanisms
  are speculated based on SARS‐CoV studies and the similarity of two viruses. AP‐1,
  activator protein 1; CCL2, C‐C motif chemokine ligand 2; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated
  kinase; TACE, tumour necrosis factor‐α‐converting enzyme.
