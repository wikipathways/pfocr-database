caption: Model of canonical and noncanonical Sap-induced inflammasome activation.
  Sap2 and Sap6 activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway through early and late signals.
  Sap2 and Sap6 induce an early cascade of events (within 30 min), causing upstream
  NLRP3 inflammasome activation and downstream caspase-1-mediated cytokine production
  (early signal). Sap endocytosis induces the translocation of NF-κB (p50/p65) into
  the nucleus, leading to pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 synthesis. Sap2 and Sap6 subsequently
  induce, through type I IFN production, caspase-11 activation (within 2 h) that cooperates
  with the NLRP3 inflammasome, triggering downstream caspase-1-mediated cytokine production
  (late signal).
