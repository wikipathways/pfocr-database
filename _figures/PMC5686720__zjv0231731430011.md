caption: Work model for NLRX1-mediated MAVS degradation during viral infection. NLRX1
  recruits PCBP2 to MAVS and induces the K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation
  of MAVS, leading to the negative regulation of the IFN signaling pathway activated
  by HCV infection, and eventually promoting persistent viral infection.
