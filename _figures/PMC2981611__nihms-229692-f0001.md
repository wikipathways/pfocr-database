caption: Wnt signaling is broadly divided into ß-catenin-dependent and ß-catenin-independent
  pathways. The ß-catenin-dependent pathway is involved in the stabilization of ß-catenin
  by the dissociation of a destruction complex that normally phosphorylates and targets
  ß-catenin for degradation. These signals require Fzd receptors to recruit the LRP
  co-receptor. ß-catenin-independent pathways encompass a broad range of outputs,
  dictated by the receptor context and downstream signals chosen. The newly discovered
  receptor tyrosine kinases Ror and Ryk provide another level of Wnt regulation in
  addition to Fzd. Within the Wnt family, there are 19 individual Wnt genes along
  with 10 different Frizzled receptors, illustrating the complexity governing this
  pathway and the multitude of Wnt-receptor combinations. The secreted Wnt inhibitors,
  Sfrps and Wifs, can regulate signaling in the extracellular space by sequestering
  Wnts away from their receptors. Wnt/ß-catenin-independent pathways can antagonize
  the ß-catenin-dependent pathway, revealing that these pathways are far more integrated
  than originally thought.
