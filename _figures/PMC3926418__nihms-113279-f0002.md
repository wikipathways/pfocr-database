caption: Models of RB/E2F and RNA processing control. (A) RB is bound to gene promoters
  through E2F. RB may inhibit splicing factors at promoters to suppress splicing of
  nacent RNA transcripts. Alternatively, RB may directly recruit splicing repressors.
  As the cell cycle proceeds toward S phase RB is phosphorylated and released from
  the promoter, which relieves splicing suppression and allows E2F to stimulate transcription.
  (B) RB interacts with several RNA processing factors that may serve to regulate
  diverse cellular processes. The role of RB in RNA processing control is a relatively
  unexplored area of research that may yield many insights into RB function.
