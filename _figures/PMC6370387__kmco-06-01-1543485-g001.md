caption: EMT-TFs metabolically reprogram normal lung epithelial cells towards a neoplastic-prone
  state. Upper-right panel – Aberrantly activated mutant RAS protein (purple colored
  protein) leads to premature cellular senescence of lung epithelial cells as shown
  by blue cells that is enforced by p53 (TP53, best known as p53, aqua colored protein)-dependent
  oncogene-induced senescence. Lower-right panel – epithelial-mesenchymal transition-transcription
  factors (EMT-TFs) TWIST1 and SNAIL1 (violet and salmon colored proteins, respectively)
  reprogram epithelial metabolism towards a tumorigenic permissive state by upregulation
  of the final product of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc), and the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) – the enzyme responsible for adding
  GlcNAc molecules onto proteins (blue colored protein). This metabolic shift leads
  to increased global O-GlcNAcylation that in the background of activated mutant RAS
  protein (purple colored protein) results in increased KrasG12D-induced lung tumorigenesis
  (neoplastic collection of cells invading through the basement membrane).
