caption: Stabilization of Cytoneme Contacts. A Cytoneme stabilization through additive
  contact. Stability can be conferred by protein–protein interactions in trans. Cytoneme-localized
  transmembrane proteins can bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (green). For
  Hh (dark purple), HSPGs contribute to Ihog (blue) interactions in trans to stabilize
  cytoneme-cytoneme contacts (left). HSPGs in the ECM or on cytoneme membrane can
  also cooperate in the higher affinity Ihog–Hh interaction (center). Highest affinity
  interactions are achieved between the Ihog, ligand, and Hh receptor Ptc (orange)
  to allow for morphogen transfer and pathway activation. B Stability of cytoneme
  contact through CAMs. HH co-receptors BOC/Boi and CDON/Ihog also function as CAMs
  to stabilize these points of interaction. Dpp transport is supported by wing disc
  expression of CAM Capricious (Caps)/Tartan (Trn) and by ASP expression of neuronal
  CAMs Neuroligin 2 (Ngl2) and Neuroglian (Nrg) at cytoneme tips
