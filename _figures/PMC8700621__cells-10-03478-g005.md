caption: Interaction between most important DEG IPSC and DEG NP based on Pathway Studio
  data. Genes, overexpressed in NPC derived from twins with PD, as compared to NPC
  derived from healthy twins are highlighted red. Genes, underexpressed in NPC derived
  from twins with PD, as compared to NPC derived from healthy twins are highlighted
  green. Non highlighted genes are underexpressed in IPSC, derived from twins with
  PD as compared to IPSC, derived from healthy twins.
