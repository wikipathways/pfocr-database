caption: PepT1 is upregulated during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) causing the
  transport of bacterial di- and tripeptides in the lumen, such as N-formylmethionylleucyl-phenylalanine
  (fMLP), muramyl dipeptide (MDP), and L-Ala-γ-D-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid (tri-DAP),
  into the intestinal epithelial cells. Due to the accumulation of bacterial di- and
  tripeptides, the NFkB pathway is stimulated leading to the activation of proinflammatory
  cytokines. In addition, IBD can cause the disruption of barrier function leading
  the transport of bacterial di-tripeptides (fMLP, MDP, tri-DAP) via paracellular
  pathway. Once they are in the lamina propria, the di-tripeptides can be taken by
  macrophages which also express PEPT1. The binding of PEPT1-Di-Tripeptide will signal
  the macrophage to upregulate major histocompatibility class I molecules. MCP, monocyte
  chemoattractant protein. Redrawn from ().
