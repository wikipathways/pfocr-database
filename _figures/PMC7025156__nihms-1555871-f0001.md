caption: The various environmental cues that can either stimulate or repress mating
  are in the blue shaded box to the left. Schematic depicts the signaling pathway
  that is initiated when pheromone binds to the Ste3 GPCR. An identical signaling
  pathway is controlled by the constitutively activated pheromone-like receptor Cpr2.
  Following GPCR activation, signaling proceeds through a mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) cascade, which activates the key high-mobility transcription factor
  Mat2. Mat2 signals in concert with other transcription factors and also directly
  binds the pheromone response element (PRE), initiating transcription of the pheromone-encoding
  gene MFa/α, and also STE3a/α, SXI1α, SXI2a, GPA2, GPA3, as well as many other genes
  (). In addition to signaling mediated by the Mat2 transcription factor, pheromone-response
  genes are upregulated in response to signaling from the transcription factor Znf3.
