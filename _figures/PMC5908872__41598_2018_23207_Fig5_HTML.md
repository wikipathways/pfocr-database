caption: 'Pathway analysis of genes differentially expressed in the canine B-cell
  receptor signaling pathway (“cfa04662”) in the (A) lymphoma and (B) lymphoid cell-line
  sample groups. The boxes representing the genes are uniformly divided by the number
  of sample groups–. Sample groups are laid out from left to right as follows: (A)
  B-cell lymphoma and probable T-cell lymphoma, and (B) CLBL-1, CLBL-1M, GL-1, OSW,
  and CL-1. The logarithm in base 2 of the fold change relative to controls for the
  genes involved is indicated in yellow (up-regulated) or blue (down-regulated). White
  boxes represent genes whose expression was not detected. Fold changes were determined
  based on the average (regularized-logarithm) transformed expression values generated
  with the “DESeq2” R/Bioconductor package for each sample group. The “Pathview” R/Bioconductor
  package was used to generate the graphical representation of the pathway and indicate
  which genes are differentially regulated.'
