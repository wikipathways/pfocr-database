caption: Adapted from . Schematic drawing of the pre-mRNA splicing pathway. The assembly
  of an activated spliceosome onto a nascent transcript is necessary for pre-mRNA
  splicing to occur. Assembly begins when U1 and U2 bind to the 5′ and 3′ splice sites,
  respectively (Complexes E and A). The U5/U4/U6 tri-snRNP then binds (Complex B),
  followed by rearrangement of the spliceosomal complex which releases U1 and U4 (Complex
  B*). The first catalytic step of splicing occurs next, resulting in the release
  of the intron at the 5′ splice site, and subsequent formation of the lariat intermediate
  (Complex C). The second catalytic step then occurs, completely excising the intron
  and associated splicing complexes (post-splicing complex), resulting in fully spliced
  exons, which then undergo further processing and export from the nucleus. The post-splicing
  complex undergoes disassembly, and the cycle can begin again. The C. elegans splicing
  factor orthologs that display overproliferation and/or Mog phenotypes () are listed
  near the step(s) where the yeast/human proteins have been shown to act (boxes),
  or listed in circles (to indicate those that function in processes not shown). YTD
  = the splicing step(s) in which these genes function is yet to be determined.
