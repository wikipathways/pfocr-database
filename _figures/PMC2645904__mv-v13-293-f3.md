caption: Schematic representations of potential signaling pathways involved in serum-deprived
  retinal ganglion cell-5 cells. Pathways were identified by incorporating the microarray
  results (differentially expressed genes identified at 8, 24, 48, and 96 h of serum
  deprivation) into PathwayAssist software. The pathway connects the proteins (blue
  color) and cell processes together. Three major biological processes of cell survival,
  apoptosis, and DNA fragmentation, regulated by these genes are represented by yellow
  color squares.
