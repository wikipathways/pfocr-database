caption: 'Heavy metals and oxidative stress in neuronal cells: the disruption of BBB
  through metal neurotoxicity and molecular mimicry. (A) Mn, Fe and other toxic metals
  accumulate within the mitochondria by utilizing the MCU. An increase in oxidative
  stress insults leads to a dysfunction of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
  Metals that are able to bind to ADP via ATP-synthase uniquely uncouples oxidative
  phosphorylation and ATP formation within the mitochondria. Pb2 has an inhibitory
  effect on the activity of calmodulin and, consequently, leads to the avoidance of
  synaptic vesicles release [,,,,,,,]. (B) In the neuronal synapses, PB, Cd, and Mn
  impair Ca2+ channels (voltage-gated Ca2+ and Ca2+ ATPase) leading to Ca2+ ion avoidance
  and alterations in ion signaling. Pb2 has an inhibitory effect on the activity of
  calmodulin and consequently leads to the avoidance of synaptic vesicle release [,].
  In the binding sites of postsynaptic cells at the NMDA-receptor/channel, and AMPA
  disturbances of the postsynaptic potential, leads to the synaptic plasticity and
  induction of LTP[,,]. (C) Glial cells further increase the production of ROS by
  mitochondrial damage. Specifically, alterations in antioxidant levels and metal
  reactions further promote the activation of the NF-kB pathway by the release of
  proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6). Increased cellular damage associated
  with the accumulation of metals promotes α -synuclein formation in astrocytes leads
  to the suppression of protective functions and a decrease in glutamate uptake, leading
  to excitotoxicity in neurons [,,,,,,,]. (D) In endothelial cells, the increase in
  ROS production promotes the release of metalloproteinase-9 and PGE-2 by endothelial
  cells. This factor then stimulates both pericytes and glial cells to further promote
  pro-inflammatory signals and, as a consequence, degrades the extracellular matrix
  of both tight junctions and BBB permeability [,,]. (E) The interaction of glial
  cells with ROS leads to mitochondrial damage and the release of proinflammatory
  cytokines, which are further bolstered by the additional burden of heavy metals.
  This impairs the essential roles of neuron maintenance by disrupting glutamate/GABA-glutamine
  shuttling. The expression of EAAT1 and EAAT2 and the activity of glutamine synthetase
  can be downregulated by the excess of intra-astroglial heavy metals [,,,]. Thus,
  glutamine catabolism and elevated extracellular glutamate further induces excitotoxicity
  and neuronal damage, finally leading to neurodegeneration[,,]. Abbreviations: AMPA:
