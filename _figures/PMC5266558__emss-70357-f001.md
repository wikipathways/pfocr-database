caption: 'The physiological, pharmacological and toxicological characterisation of
  stem cell-derived hepatocytes is necessary before the cells can be fully utilised.
  This will include the use of toxicity/stress reporters, and a small panel of well-defined
  chemicals, thereby defining the toxicological purpose for which each line is suitable.
  This will position the new cells within a screening toolbox that could be validated
  for drug/chemical safety evaluation. The use of iPSC lines with drug toxicity-relevant
  mutations and the use of CRISPR technology to edit genes involved in drug metabolism
  may also be important in this regard.Abbreviation: AOP = Adverse Outcome Pathway'
