caption: ZnONPs disrupt lysosome activity and impair autophagic flux to facilitate
  exosome secretion in keratinocytes and macrophages. Under UVB exposure, ZnONPs lead
  to autophagosome accumulation and lysosome dysfunction, which activate the NLRP3
  inflammasome and enhance the release of exosomes by HaCaT cells. Moreover, exosomes
  secreted by HaCaT cells stimulated M1 macrophage activation, and further exposure
  to ZnONPs upregulated the NFκB signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome-autophagy-exosomal
  pathway. Cytokines and exosomes released from macrophages further accelerated inflammatory
  responses in keratinocytes, which affected UVB-induced skin injury
