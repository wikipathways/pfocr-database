caption: Comparison of mechanisms of muscle uptake and oxidation of circulating glucose
  and fructose in humans, nectar bats and hummingbirds. (A) Pathway for uptake and
  oxidation of mainly glucose into human skeletal muscle fibers, highlighting key
  regulatory steps (e.g., sarcollemal transport, regulation of transport capacity
  via insulin and contractile activity; (B) Glucose and fructose uptake and oxidation
  in nectar bats highlighting enhancements (in bold; those hypothesized are noted
  by asterisks) to various pathway elements; (C) Glucose and fructose uptake and oxidation
  in hummingbirds highlighting key upregulated steps (bold and asterisks used as in
  (B)). Details regarding functional enhancements are discussed in the main text and
  in Welch and Chen []. Figure from [].
