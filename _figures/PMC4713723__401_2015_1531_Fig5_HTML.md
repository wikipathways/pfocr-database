caption: Mechanisms involved in Escherichia coli K1 manipulation of macrophages. The
  outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of E. coli K1 interacts with chitobiose moieties
  (GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc) in CD64 for inducing actin rearrangements to the sites of bacterial
  attachment for internalization of E. coli. During this process, the intracellular
  domain of CD64 triggers the upregulation of B cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL),
  an anti-apoptotic protein by an unknown mechanism to prevent apoptosis of the infected
  macrophages. In addition, toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) ligands such as peptidoglycan
  (PGN) interaction with TLR2 also induces inducible nitric oxide (NO) production
  by activation of iNOS. Parallel to Bcl-XL upregulation, OmpA interaction with CD64
  also enhances guanidine cyclohydrolase I (GCH1), which in turn produces biopterin.
  The biopterin subsequently acts as a co-factor for more inducible nitric oxide synthase
  (iNOS) activation and produce greater amounts of NO, which triggers the expression
  of CD64 to the cells surface. Thus, more E. coli bind to the receptor and enter
  the macrophages. The OmpA-CD64-mediated entry also avoids the fusion of lysosome
  with endosome, thereby finding a niche for survival and multiplication. To prevent
  the hostile conditions for bacterial survival, E. coli also suppresses mitogen-activated
  protein (MAP) kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), and p38,
  thereby the activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). This arm of signaling prevents
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. Red lines indicate
  inhibition of specific signaling pathway
