caption: (A) Simplified schematic of the adenine biosynthesis pathway. Circles represent
  metabolic intermediates; AIR is the toxic metabolic intermediate phosphoribosylaminoimidazole.
  Annotations represent the number of fixed nonsynonymous mutations in each gene (note
  that ADE5 and ADE7 are both products of the same gene). (B) Schematic of a fitness
  landscape with four possible states defined by whether ADE2 is functional and whether
  the ADE pathway upstream of ADE2 is functional. The small insets represent the state
  of the pathway in (A) at each position. Elevation in the landscape represents putative
  fitness differences, and the width of the arrows represents the putative mutation
  rates between the different states.
