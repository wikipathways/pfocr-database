caption: The CoA biosynthetic pathway for E. coli. The pathway for the biosynthesis
  of CoA is defined for E. coli and consists of a series of five enzymes (). Pantothenate
  (Pan) is transported into the cell by a sodium-dependent transporter (PanF), and
  efflux occurs by a separate mechanism using a yet unidentified protein(s) (, , ).
  Pantothenate kinase, the product of the coaA gene (, ), catalyzes the first step
  in the pathway, and this enzyme is potently feedback inhibited by CoA (, ). The
  next two steps are catalyzed by the bifunctional phosphopantothenoylcysteine (P-PanCys)
  synthase/P-PanCys decarboxylase encoded by the coaBC gene (formerly dfp) (). The
  coaD gene produces the P-PanSH adenylyltransferase (, ), and the coaE gene encodes
  the last enzyme in the pathway, dephospho-CoA (deP-CoA) kinase (). CoA is degraded
  by a phosphodiesterase to 3′,5′-ADP and P-PanSH (), but the gene encoding this activity
  is unknown. P-PanSH exits the cell by an unknown mechanism, but E. coli cannot incorporate
  extracellular P-PanSH into CoA (, ).
