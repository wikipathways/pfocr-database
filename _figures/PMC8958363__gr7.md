caption: Diversity of UPR and DNA damage response in different host lineages(A) Heatmap
  showing differences in RNA expression and CNV for genes involved in different function
  of UPR including chaperone-mediated protein folding, ERAD, and glycosylation. Note
  that the MK-1 GS−/− cell line exhibited significantly upregulated expression at
  both DNA and RNA levels across all subsystems.(B) Gene set enrichment analysis of
  representative gene set for UPR showing enriched UPR in MK-1 GS−/− compared with
  MK-2 GS−/− cell line. UPR pathway schematic showing upregulation of genes involved
  in protein folding, lipid biogenesis, ERAD, and glycosylation in MK-1 GS−/− cell
  line (thermometer-1) compared with MK-2 GS−/− (thermometer-2). (C) Heatmap showing
  differences in gene expression and CNV for genes involved in DNA repair. Genes are
  categorized by the distinct repair pathway. Note that MK-1 GS−/− cell line exhibited
  increased homologous recombination (HR) but not other pathways such as base excision
  repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), or nonhomologous
  end joining (NHEJ). (D) Gene set enrichment analysis of representative gene set
  for homologous recombination (HR) genes in MK-1 GS−/− compared with MK-2 GS−/− cell
  line. A schematic depicting the HR pathway in MK-1 GS−/− cell line (thermometer-1)
  compared with MK-2 GS−/− (thermometer-2). Red and blue thermometers represent upregulation
  and downregulation of mRNA level, respectively. All CNV and RNA differential expression
  were compared with CHO-K1 LC78. See also  for cell phenotype relating to genetic
  changes.
