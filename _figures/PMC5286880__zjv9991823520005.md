caption: The interferon signaling pathway as differentially regulated by ZIKV and
  HCMV in maternal-decidual and fetus-derived chorionic villus tissues. Pathway enrichment
  of differentially expressed genes (FDR of <0.1) in decidual tissue (A) and placental
  villus (B) was carried out with ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Gene upregulation
  is depicted in shades of red, from white (not significantly changed, to dark red
  (highly upregulated).
