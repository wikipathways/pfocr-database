caption: Immunologic properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs escape immune surveillance
  by altering immunomodulatory molecules. CSCs avoid recognition by immune cells by
  downregulating MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules and antigen processing machinery (APM)
  molecule [antigen processing 1/2 (TAP1/2)]. CSCs evade NK-mediated killing by decreasing
  the expression of and shedding activating NK ligands (ULBP1-6, MICA/B, Nkp30L, and
  Nkp44L) and increasing inhibitory NK ligands (KIR2DL1-5 and KIR3D1-3), and carcinoembryonic
  antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). High levels of MICA/B are secreted
  through membrane vesicles facilitated by increased levels of charged multivesicular
  body protein (CHMP2A) in CSCs. CSCs also express high levels of immune checkpoints,
  such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which interact with corresponding receptors
  on immune cells and thereby impede the activation and proliferation of immune cells.
  The expression and stability of PD-L1 is regulated by multiple signaling pathways,
  including Notch, mTOR, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, signal transducer,
  and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), as well as interleukin and interferon-γ
  (IFN-γ). IFN-γ is released by CSCs or other immune cells. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) can
  be secreted by CSCs and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). IL-8 induces phosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation of hexokinase 2 (HK2) by AKT. Phosphorylated HK2 and hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) promote the transcription of CD274 by binding the promoter.
  PD-L1 also binds to Frizzled 6 to activate β-catenin signaling and further upregulates
  PD-L1. IL-8 enhances O-GlcNAcylation by upregulating glucose uptake transporter
  3 (GLUT3) and glutamine fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (GFAT), which contribute
  to stemness in CSCs. Moreover, CSCs secrete cytokines, chemokines, and triphosphate
  RNAs to recruit immunosuppressive immune cells. Sox9/C-C motif chemokine ligand
  1 (CCL1) axis recruits neutrophils through PI3K/AT and ERK1/2 signaling. CSCs release
  triphosphate RNAs to recruit neutrophils. Additionally, CSCs secrete CCL2/5, IL-13,
  and CSF1 to recruit inhibitory Tregs and TAMs. TAMs release milk-fat globule-epidermal
  growth factor-VIII (MFG-E) and IL-6 to maintain the stemness of CSCs. Moreover,
  the increasing CD47 in CSCs interacts with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα)
  to exert a “don’t eat me” signal. SIRγ is highly expressed in CSCs to provoke a
  “don’t eat me” signal
