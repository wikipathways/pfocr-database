caption: 'Increased iron metabolism drives CSC expansion and maintenance (compared
  to non-CSC counterparts). Expression of key proteins involved in iron trafficking
  are differentially expressed between cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Cancer
  cells or non-CSCs: low levels of TFR expression (regulated by IRP2, which is itself
  regulated by the iron status of the cells to maintain iron homeostasis) in charge
  of iron uptake, and high levels of FPN (regulated by hepcidin, iron master regulator)
  and/or hephaestin (ferroxidase) expression involved in iron export, collectively
  lead to low level of intracellular iron. CSCs: High level of CD44 (stem cell marker)
  via its interaction with iron-bound hyaluronates and TFR via Tf/2Fe3+ increase iron
  uptake, whereas a downregulated FPN level decreases iron efflux. This leads to a
  higher intracellular iron level, directly supporting the expression of some stem
  markers (including CD44 or CD133 regulating the endocytosis of TFR/Tf), the Wnt
  pathway (activator of CD44, SOX2, NANOG, and OCT4 expression), and STAT3-FOXM1 signaling.
  Thus, this increasing iron metabolism leads to CSC proliferation and supports CSC/stemness
  behavior. Arrowhead or stop lines indicate promotion/activation or inhibition, respectively.'
