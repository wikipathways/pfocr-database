caption: Schematic representation of insulin signaling pathway Insulin works mainly
  through two pathways, the PI3K and MAPKs. As for PI3K signaling pathway, insulin
  binds to the α-subunit of the INSR on the cell membrane of target tissues, leading
  to phosphorylation of the β subunit tyrosine site in the cytoplasm. Then activated
  IRS-1 binds to the regulatory p85 subunit of downstream PI3K, thereby leading to
  the phosphorylation of Akt, which in turn phosphorylates AS160 and promotes the
  transport of GLUT4 from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane, increasing
  transport of glucose into the cell and promoting synthesis of hepatic glycogen,
  inhibiting glycogen decomposition, and reducing blood glucose concentrations. Akt
  also can inhibit the activity of nuclear transcription factor FoxO, thereby inhibiting
  gluconeogenesis. Regarding another MAPK signaling pathway, after insulin binding
  with INSR, the activated IRS-2 can bind to the SH2 segment of Grb2, and then acts
  on the signaling protein GDP/GTP exchange factor to convert the inactive Ras-GDP
  into active Ras-GTP. Activated Ras recruits Raf serine kinase, which can phosphorylates
  MAPKK serine, a MAPK kinase that activates MAPK. Activated MAPK can induce phosphorylation
  of various target proteins that participate in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 to
  regulate cell proliferation, cell variation, angiogenesis, DNA repair, etc.
