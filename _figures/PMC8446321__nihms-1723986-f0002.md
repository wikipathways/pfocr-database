caption: (a) The mechanically interlocked structure of lasso peptide MccJ25 (L1) with
  highlighted stopper residues Phe-19 and Tyr-20 (cis/trans configuration of amide
  bonds is not taken into account). (b) Schematic representation of the synthesis
  protocol for MIPs made from engineered lasso peptides. After selective substitution
  of lasso peptide L1 by Cys residues, enzymatic cleavage of a Cys-decorated variant
  in its loop region yields [2]rotaxane intermediates which undergo dynamic self-assembly
  into topologically complex MIPs via disulfide bonding. The positioning of Cys residues
  controls the pathway selection and thus the product distribution in the resulting
  DCL. A desired MIP can be isolated from the DCL, is stable and can be subsequently
  modified and functionalized in aqueous solution.
