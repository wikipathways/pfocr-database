caption: Digestion and absorption of three major polar lipids in milk. Lipids in the
  milk are organized in the milk fat globule (MFG) with polar lipids in the membrane
  and triacylglycerol (TAG) in the core. The secretory pancreatic phospholipase A2
  IB (sPLA2 IB), sPLA2, and sPLA2X hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysoPC and
  may release arachidonic acid (ARA) for both phospholipid (PL) and prostaglandin
  (PGD) synthesis. Phospholipase B (PLB) can degrade both PC and lysoPC to glycerophosphocholine
  (GPC) and then by GDE5 to choline. Both lysoPC and choline are absorbed. Absorbed
  lysoPC may release choline that can, in turn, be phosphorylated to choline phosphate
  (ChP) in mucosal cells. Sphingomyelin (SM) is sequentially hydrolyzed by alkaline
  SMase (alk-SMase), neutral ceramidase (N-CDase), and bile salt-stimulated lipase
  (BSSL) to ceramide (Cer), sphingosine (Sph), and fatty acid (FA). The cleaved ChP
  is degraded to choline by intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP). Then, Sph, choline,
  and FA are absorbed. The Sph in mucosa may be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase
  (SPK) to S1P, most of which is degraded by sphingosine lyase (SPL) to palmitaldehyde
  and further converted into palmitic acid. This reaction generates ethanolamine phosphate
  (ethanolamine-P). Both ethanolamine and choline are substrate for synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) and PC, respectively, via the Kennedy pathway or transported via portal vein.
  PE is degraded by sPLA2 IB, sPLA2 IIA, PLRP2, and PLB to lysoPE for absorption.
  LysoPE can be degraded by PLB to glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) and then to ethanolamine
  likely by GDE5 for absorption and resynthesis of PE. Meanwhile, polyunsaturated
  fatty acid (PUFA) can be formed during PE hydrolysis. Furthermore, transport and
  metabolism of PUFA from PE, FA from SM, and ARA from PC hydrolysis are not shown
  in the figure (For other abbreviations, see the text).
