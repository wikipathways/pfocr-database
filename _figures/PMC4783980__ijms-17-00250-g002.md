caption: Inhibition of Calcium-induced T Lymphocyte Apoptosis pathway. Based on overlap
  of identified DEGs to Calcium-induced T Lymphocyte Apoptosis pathways, IPA had predicted
  its inhibition. CD3, CAMK4, TRGV9, NFAT, ZAP70, LCK, PRKC, HLA-DOB, ITPR1 genes
  involved in this pathway were downregulated as shown by the purple circles. XXXX
  line indicate DNA strand. The white end arrow means “translocation” and the dark
  end arrow means “acts on”.
