caption: Regulatory pathways for SREBP-1c signaling. Insulin, in an LXR and S6 kinase-dependent
  manner, promotes the site-specific cleavage of pSREBP-1c. This releases transcriptionally
  active nSREBP-1c, which goes to the nucleus and binds sterol response elements (SRE)
  in the DNA to modulate target gene expression. Numerous other stimuli and regulators
  of SREBP-1c gene expression are not shown for brevity. Multiple types of sterols,
  AMPK signaling, lipins, and p53 can inhibit the cleavage/translocation event. SIRT1
  and GSK3 are known to promote SREBP-1c degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
  In the current work, RNF20 is shown to cause the proteasomal degradation of nSREBP-1c,
  and this can be induced by PKA signaling, forskolin, or glucagon. Metformin, through
  PKA inhibition, is predicted to block SREBP-1c degradation, although formal demonstration
  of this remains to be seen. AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; RNF20, Ring finger
  protein 20; LXRs, Liver X receptors; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; pSREBP-1c,
  precursor SREBP-1c; nSREBP-1c, nuclear SREBP-1c; Ub, ubiquitin; SRE, sterol response
  element.
