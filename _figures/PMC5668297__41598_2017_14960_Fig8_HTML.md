caption: Schematic – activation of SIRT1/AMPK pathway by metoprolol is required to
  inhibit AF induced by chronic OSA. Chronic OSA causes structural, sympathetic nerve
  and metabolic remodeling of the atria. Metoprolol inhibits sympathetic hyperinnervation,
  acts as a positive modulator of Sirt1 activity, and initiates an adaptive response.
  (i) Sirt1/AMPK can act as a potent suppressor of HIF-1α and cause mitochondrial
  damage; (ii) decreased expression of FAT/CD36 and GLUT4 on the cell membrane was
  reversed, thus rescuing impaired uptake of glucose and FA; and (iii) metoprolol
  inhibits atrial apoptosis and fibrosis, perhaps partly through the Sirt1/AMPK pathway.
