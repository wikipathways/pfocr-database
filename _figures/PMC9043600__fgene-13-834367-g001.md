caption: LncRNAs regulating cellular processes in cerebrovascular endothelial cells.
  The cerebrovascular endothelial cells of the neurovascular unit are governed by
  signaling pathways that respond to distinct cues from luminal and abluminal sides.
  Several lncRNAs have been discovered to regulate the protein coding gene players
  in cerebrovascular endothelial cells at post-transcriptional and post-translational
  levels within the signaling involving tight junction turn over, VEGF pathway, PI3K-Akt
  pathway, STAT3 activation, autophagy and apoptosis. LncRNAs are mentioned in yellow
  font in the figure; the ones in boxes negatively regulate their cognate pathways,
  while the rest have a positive role in their cognate pathways. All the references
  to the mentioned lncRNAs can be found in .
