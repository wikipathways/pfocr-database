caption: Phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ under hypoxic conditions. Under normoxia environments,
  phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ increases the expression of genes related to tumor growth
  through the combination of transcription activators; YAP/TAZ bind to TEAD and acts
  as a transcriptional activator through the Hippo-Off signaling pathway, mediating
  the translocation of the YAP/TEZ complex into the nucleus by inducing phosphorylation
  of Rho, MST1/2, and LAST1/2, in sequence, depending on the GPCR or GCGR signaling
  system. Once translocated into the nucleus, YAP/TAZ bind to TEAD and activate cell
  proliferation and the cell cycle, and changes in cellular structure, including hypertrophy
  of heterogeneous cells, leading to tumor development. However, under hypoxic environments,
  YAP and TAZ bind to HIF differently through a variant phosphorylation process. Hypoxia-mediated
  HIF-1a translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus, where it binds to unphosphorylated
  YAP and binds to TEAD. YAP/HIF binds to DNA, inhibits DNA damage and apoptosis,
  and induces the expression of a variety of genes involved in cell proliferation,
  angiogenesis, and metastasis. In addition, interaction of HIF-1α with TAZ also stimulates
  TAZ/TEAD transcriptional activity. TAZ and HIF-1α interact and function as mutual
  transcriptional cofactors. HIF-1α acts as a cofactor of the TAZ/TEADs complex for
  the transcription of target genes, and TAZ acts as a cofactor of HIF-1α for the
  transcription of target genes such as PAI1, BIRC5, CTGF, PDK1, and LDHA in the hypoxic
  tumor microenvironment. Moreover, TAZ also regulates the mechanism by which HIF
  binds to and regulates TAZ expression. These different hypoxic mechanisms of YAP/TAZ
  affect tumor formation and patient mortality and are involved in sensitivity to
  anticancer drugs and development of tumor metastasis
