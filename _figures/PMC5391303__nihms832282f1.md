caption: BTK in involved in the signaling of multiple receptors that together control
  cell migration, adhesion, survival and proliferation. Activation of BTK is triggered
  upon BCR stimulation, for example, after antigen (Ag) binding, as shown on the left
  hand side. The BCR signaling pathway is thought to play a major role in mediating
  B-cell survival and proliferation in normal and neoplastic B-cells. In addition,
  BTK mediates signals derived from chemokine receptors, such as the CXCR4 receptor,
  which binds to the chemokine CXCL12 (SDF-1) to mediate homing and migration. Both
  CXCR4 and the BCR also regulate adhesion molecules such as integrins, which are
  essential for tissue homing and retention. Consequently, inhibition of BTK results
  in redistribution of tissue-resident CLL cells into the blood and inhibition of
  re-homing. Reproduced, with permission, from [].
