caption: 'Autocrine ATP signaling pathway controls astrocyte glutamate release and
  neuronal activity. Schematic drawing summarizing the presented data: (1) photoactivation
  induces release of ATP from astrocytes; (2) released ATP activates P2Y1R via autocrine
  mechanism; (3) P2Y1R signaling pathway amplifies Ca2+ release from Ca2+ store; (4)
  increase in Ca2+ triggers release of glutamate (Glu) from astrocytes probably through
  bestrophin-1 channels (Best1); (5) Glu activates presynaptic mGluR and postsynaptic
  NMDAR, the latter being responsible for the increase in action potential firing
  of CA1 pyramidal neurons. (1′) ChR2 activation may directly mobilize Ca2+ stores
  and cause glutamate release; (2′) released ATP is also hydrolyzed in adenosine (Ado)
  that activates A1 receptors and induces inhibition of CA1 firing.'
