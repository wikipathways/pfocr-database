caption: 'Functions of GUN1 in plastid biology and retrograde control of nuclear gene
  expression. Left panel: in the dark, by interacting with NEP, MORF2, FUG1, and PRPS1,
  GUN1 controls plastid gene expression (PGE). GUN1 is also involved in plastid protein
  import by interacting with HSC70-1 and the TIC/TOC complex. When GUN1 is not present,
  preproteins and, consequently, cytosolic chaperones (HSP90 and HSP70) are accumulated
  in the cytosol. The HSP90 is thought to be involved in the induction of the expression
  of the PhANGs, either by repressing negative or activating positive transcription
  factors. GUN1 can also bind the haem and the enzymes of the TBP, such as the D-subunit
  of Mg-chelatase (CHLD) and FC1, and thus may affect the flux through the TBP. Moreover,
  GUN1-mediated signals might influence the expression of GLK1 and GLK2, which modifies
  the expression of the PhANGs and the essential TBP genes. Most of the molecular
  functions of GUN1 were identified using the plastid translation inhibitor lincomycin
  (LIN) or the inhibitor of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, norflurazon (NF).
  Right panel: in the light, levels of GUN1 proteins are strongly decreased by the
  action of the plastid CLPC1 protease, leading to the expression induction of PhANGs.'
