caption: 'Model for supraphysiologic AAS use, other substance use disorders, and biological
  mediators in the causation of Alzheimer’s Disease and its Related Dementias. AAS
  use and other substance use disorders, which develop by young adulthood, induce
  premature hypogonadism and/or excess oxidative stress, effects that are associated
  with increased Aβ and tau-P burdens in later life. Accordingly, substance use disorders
  may constitute early, modifiable causal factors for the development of AD/ADRD.
  Treatments that optimize sex steroid hormone levels, that reduce excess oxidative
  stress, or that inhibit GSK3β activity may exert powerful multi-targeting benefits
  on key mediators in the causal pathway to AD/ADRD. Legend: AAS: supraphysiologic-dose
  anabolicandrogenic steroid abuse; Aβ: beta-amyloid protein; AD/ADRD: Alzheimer’s
  Disease and its Related Dementias; GSK3β: Glycogen synthase kinase 3β; Meth: methamphetamine;
  Nrf2: Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2.'
