caption: Mitochondria participate in neural differentiation in neural stem cells (NSCs)
  and committed cells. (A) Intermediate metabolites generated in the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle, such as α–ketoglutarate (αKG), can regulate neurogenesis through
  histone/DNA demethylation for the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency. Reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) generated through NADPH-oxidase (NOX) can regulate the proliferation
  of NSCs via the PI3K/AKT pathway. (B) In committed cells, the metabolic pattern
  gradually switches from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). ROS generated
  through the electron transport chain (ETC) can activate self-renewal-inhibiting
  and neural differentiation-promoting genes via NRF2-dependent retrograde signaling.
  In contrast, ROS can also facilitate the SIRT1-mediated inhibition of Mash1 expression,
  thereby guiding NPCs to an astroglial fate.
