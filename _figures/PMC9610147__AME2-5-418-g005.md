caption: The various interactions between RABV (rabies virus) proteins and interferon
  signaling pathway. The IFN (interferon) signaling pathway is activated by RABV infection,
  whereas RABV utilizes its own proteins to suppress the IFN signaling pathway by
  interacting with key factors in IFN pathways. RABV P interacts directly with tyrosine‐phosphorylated
  STAT (pY‐STAT) to inhibit the expression of ISGs (interferon‐stimulated genes) by
  affecting its localization and reducing its ability to bind to ISG promoters. P
  protein is also able to interact directly with TBK‐1 (TANK‐binding kinase‐1) in
  a dose‐dependent manner, inhibiting phosphorylation of the IRF3 (interferon regulatory
  factor 3). Moreover, the interaction between P and PML (promyelocytic leukemia)
  alters PML protein localization and the structure of PML‐NBs (nuclear bodies), thereby
  regulating IFN‐induced apoptosis. The encapsulation of RABV RNA by N protein protects
  viral RNA from being recognized by RIG‐I (retinoic acid–inducible gene I), which
  subsequently prevents RIG‐I‐mediated activation of the downstream IRF‐3 pathway
