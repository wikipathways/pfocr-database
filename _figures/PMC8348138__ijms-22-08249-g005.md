caption: 'Three branches of MEP pathway include carotenoids biosynthesis, the biosynthesis
  of the phytol side chain of chlorophylls, and of diterpenoids such as gibberellins
  in the Narcissus flower. The red line and arrowhead in the up panel represents the
  terpenoids metabolic pathway, and the black line and arrowhead represents carotenoids
  biosynthesis; the biosynthesis of the phytol side chain of the chlorophylls pathway.
  The heat map shows the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes related
  to three branches of MEP pathway in tepals and coronas at different periods (left
  down). Enzyme names are shown in the gray background circle. The FPKM values of
  genes are labeled on the heat map. The color bar from blue to orange is upregulated;
  from orange to blue is down regulated: AS, anthranilate synthase; ZFPS, cis,cis-farnesyl
  diphosphate synthase; DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; DXR, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose
