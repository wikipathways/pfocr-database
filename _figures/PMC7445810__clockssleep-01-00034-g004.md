caption: Interactions between the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and circadian pathways.
  (A) Under normal oxygen conditions, HIF-1α is degraded through an oxygen-dependent
  degradation pathway. In hypoxic conditions, like that in a tumor, HIF-1α is no longer
  degraded and translocates into the nucleus where it binds to HIF-1β and p300 to
  form the HIF complex. The complex binds to the hypoxia response elements (HRE) in
  the promoter region of >1000 genes to generate the hypoxic response. (B) Simplified
  version of the molecular clock. For further details see . (C) Several interactions
  between the HIF and circadian pathways have been proposed. Given that tumors are
  commonly hypoxic with disrupted circadian rhythms, it is possible that HIF activation
  may be interfering with clock gene expression, generating the disrupted rhythms.
  Arrows indicate activation or increased expression, while T-arrows indicate blocking
  activity. Parts of the figure modified from [].
