caption: A network of genes that are somehow involved in the functioning of transport.
  Pathway Studio was used to build this network. Cellular processes are marked with
  a yellow box, genes and protein structures under study are marked with a red ellipse,
  disease (PD) and related processes are marked with a purple box, and a cell (neuron)
  is marked with light blue. Interactions between the gene and the object are indicated
  by arrows.
