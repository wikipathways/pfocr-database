caption: A, in the retina, photoreceptors (PRs, purple) transduce the visual input
  into an electrical signal and feed into bipolar cells (BCs, green) that provide
  input to the retina's output neurons, the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs, blue). This
  vertical excitatory pathway is extensively modulated by inhibitory amacrine cells
  (ACs) in the inner retina. Here, wide‐field ACs (red) mainly transfer information
  laterally within individual synaptic layers, while small‐field ACs (orange) predominantly
  mediate vertical signalling across synaptic layers. Arrows indicate main signal
  flow. HC, horizontal cells (yellow). B, ACs form a complex and dense synaptic network
  in the inner plexiform layer. In mammals, wide‐field ACs use GABA as neurotransmitter
  (light blue vesicles), while small‐field ACs use glycine (purple vesicles). Bipolar
  cells use glutamate (green vesicles). C, ACs provide inhibitory inputs to BC axon
  terminals (presynaptic inhibitory inputs), RGC dendrites (postsynaptic inhibitory
  inputs) and other ACs (serial inhibitory inputs).
