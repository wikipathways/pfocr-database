caption: 'An outline of the biosynthesis and reactions of ascorbate in plants covered
  in this Special Issue. The diagram illustrates the d-mannose/l-galactose biosynthetic
  pathway and the proposed main flux controlling step (GDP-l-galactose phosphorylase).
  Uronic acids can be converted to ascorbate if made available by feeding or by overexpression
  of relevant enzymes, and d-galacturonate derived from pectin breakdown could provide
  a minor route in wild-type plants. The green box includes the biochemical reactions
  of ascorbate enabling it to act as an antioxidant/radical scavenger, enzyme substrate
  (VDE), enzyme cofactor (myrosinase), or a chaperone preventing inactivation by overoxidation
  of active site Fe in 2-ODDs. The primary oxidation product, monodehydroascorbate,
  is a relatively stable radical which is regenerated to ascorbate or disproportionates
  to dehydroascorbate (DHA). Ascorbate is regenerated from DHA in the ascorbate–glutathione
  cycle (blue box) which links ascorbate to the wider thiol system. Other ascorbate-derived
  compounds are shown. Proteins and small molecules can be (dehydro)ascorbylated,
  but little is known about these products. Abbreviations: AO, ascorbate oxidase;
  APX, ascorbate peroxidase; DHAR, dehydroascorbate reductase; l-GalDH, l-galactose
  dehydrogenase; l-GalLDH, l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase; d-GalUR, galacturonate
  reductase; GME, GDP-mannose-3’,5’-epimerase; GMP, GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase;
  GPP, l-galactose 1-P phosphatase; GR, glutathione reductase; GSSG, oxidized glutathione;
  MDHAR, monodehydroascorbate reductase; MIOX, myo-inositol oxygenase; 2-ODD, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent
  dioxygenase; VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase'
