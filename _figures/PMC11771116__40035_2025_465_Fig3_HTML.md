caption: The putative pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the incidence of amyloid-related
  imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease
  (AD). a The schematic diagram shows the occurrence of ARIA by the classical complement
  cascade in the vasculature. Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (MABs) induce the
  formation of C1 complex. The C1 complex disrupts the blood brain barrier (BBB) by
  forming the membrane attack complex (MAC) C5b-9 through multiple complement signaling
  pathways. b The schematic diagram shows the incidence of ARIA by the FcR-mediated
  signaling pathways in the brain. During the removal process of Aβ aggregates by
  antibodies, detritus, such as soluble Aβ, is transported towards the BBB by ApoE.
  This transported Aβ contributes to the formation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy
  (CAA). The antibody-mediated clearance of formed CAA not only damages the BBB but
  also activates macrophages through the FcR-mediated signaling pathway. The activated
  macrophages induce inflammatory signaling, such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1
  (TIMP1) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), leading to an increased recruitment
  of monocytes around the BBB. The BBB is damaged by this inflammatory response
