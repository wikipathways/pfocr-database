caption: The mechanisms underlying chemoresistance in lung CSCs. Extracellular Wnt5a
  initializes the Ca2+ pathway by interacting with Rho-kinase 2 (Rock2) and dishevelled
  on the membrane. Ca2+ then activates CamKII and protein kinase C (PKC), which induce
  nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-mediated transcription of stemness-related genes
  and inhibit the transcription of apoptosis-related genes. Upon cisplatin treatment,
  Notch1 is upregulated in CSCs. Notch1 promotes stemness in a hairy and enhancer
  of split (HES1)-dependent manner and triggers cisplatin resistance by increasing
  ATP-binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2) and ABCB1. p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1)
  activates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in CSCs, followed by the elevated transcription
  of Gstp1 or activation of β-catenin signaling regulated by phosphorylation of GSK3β
  at Ser9, which leads to cisplatin resistance. Moreover, Yes1-associated transcriptional
  regulator (YAP1) and PI3K/AKT-induced PD-L1 are reported to cause cisplatin resistance.
  Euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase (EHMT), which catalyzes the methylation
  of H3K9, is reduced in CSCs. Nuclear transcription factor Y subunit A (NFYA) is
  then recruited to DNA and initializes transcription of ALDH2, which results in paclitaxel
  resistance through RAS/RAF signaling. Several microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-128,
  miR-129-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-200, and let-7, impede chemoresistance in CSCs
