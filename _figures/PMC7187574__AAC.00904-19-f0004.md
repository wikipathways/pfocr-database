caption: 'Arginine and methionine metabolism in different strains of L. donovani.
  A pathway map for arginine, proline, methionine, and cysteine metabolism is shown.
  The map also includes glutathione and trypanothione biosynthesis. Boxed metabolites
  were detected in the metabolic profile of the L. donovani strains by LC-MS. Yellow
  shading indicates that metabolite identities were confirmed by retention times matching
  those obtained with authentic standards; unshaded metabolites were putatively identified
  by accurate mass only. Unboxed metabolites were not detected by LC-MS but are presumed
  to be present. Abbreviations: SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  MTA, 5-methylthioadenosine; OAS, O-acetylserine; GSH, glutathione; GSSG, oxidized
  glutathione; T(SH)2, reduced trypanothione; T(S)2, oxidized trypanothione; P5C,
  pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Filled arrows represent enzyme reactions known to occur
  in Leishmania spp. Dotted arrows show reactions that have not been confirmed. a,
  the urea cycle is not thought to be complete in Leishmania; b, nitric oxide synthase
  activity was detected in L. amazonensis, but the gene has not been identified in
  any Leishmania species; c, the oxidation of thiols may occur in situ during cell
  extract formation and LC-MS.'
