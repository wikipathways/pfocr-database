caption: The left side of panel (a) depicts the three main regulatory pathways (DegS–DegU,
  Spo0A phosphorelay, and ComP–ComA from left to right, respectively) affected by
  Rap proteins. The right side of panel (a) indicates the Rap–Phr pathway, where processed
  and secreted Phr acts as a quorum sensing signal, which after uptake inhibits the
  function of the corresponding Rap proteins. T-ended lines depict inhibition, black
  arrows indicate activation, blue arrows symbolize transcription and translation.
  Panel (b) represents the main steps of the competition experiment performed in this
  study; created with Biorender.com.
