caption: The glutaminolysis pathway. The succinyl-CoA ligase reaction, metabolizing
  succinyl-CoA to succinate, produces high-energy phosphates (ATP) in the absence
  of oxidative phosphorylation through the process of substrate-level phosphorylation
  in the mitochondrial matrix. Provision of succinyl-CoA by the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
  complex is crucial for maintaining the function of succinyl-CoA ligase thus preventing
  the adenine nucleotide translocase from reversing. Succinate contributes to inflammation
  and stabilizes Hif-1a, a key transcription factor that contributes to the aerobic
  fermentation (–).
