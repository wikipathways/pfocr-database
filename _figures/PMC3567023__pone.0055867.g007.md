caption: In response to estrogenic stimulation or to atherogenic stress induced by
  elevated serum cholesterol levels, HSP27 is released into the extracellular space
  via an exosomal pathway. Once available in the extracellular space, HSP27 may alter
  gene transcription in target cells (e.g., vascular smooth muscle cells or monocyte/macrophages).
  Shown here is HSP27-induced activation of NF-κB, resulting in candidate genes expression
  and the altering of scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) expression, thereby reducing cholesterol
  uptake and foam cell formation. The search for a putative HSP27 cell surface receptor
  is ongoing.
