caption: 'The chemotaxis system in E. coli. (a) E. coli chemotactic response. Cells
  in a liquid environment alternate between smooth swimming and tumbling, which are
  regulated by the rotational direction of flagellar motors. Cells swim smoothly when
  all the motors rotate counterclockwise (CCW) and flagellar filaments form a bundle.
  Cells tumble when the motors switch to clockwise (CW) rotation and the bundle is
  disrupted. E. coli cells swim against the gradient of the concentration of an attractant
  by regulating their smooth swimming and tumbling via the chemotaxis system. (b)
  The chemotaxis molecular pathway. Chemotactic signals, such as chemicals, pH, and
  temperature, are detected by chemoreceptors located primarily at one of the cellular
  poles. Thousands of receptor proteins cluster in patches with CheA and CheW. Receptors
  increase CheA autophosphorylation when they sense a repellent or a decrease in attractant.
  The phosphoryl group on CheA is transferred to a response regulator, CheY. Phosphorylated
  CheY (CheY-P) binds to the flagellar motor and increases the probability of its
  CW rotation. The binding of attractant chemicals to receptors inhibits CheA autophosphorylation.
  In addition to this inhibition, CheZ reduces the intracellular concentration of
  CheY-P. As a result, the motor continues to rotate CCW. CheR and CheB regulate chemotaxis
  via the methylation and demethylation of receptors, respectively. Decreased attractant
  levels (or a sensing of repellent) induce the phosphorylation of CheB to demethylate
  receptors, which decreases CheA autophosphorylation. The binding of attractants
  to receptors reduces the phosphorylation and activity of CheB, and the receptors
  are methylated by CheR; this methylation increases CheA autophosphorylation. This
  negative feedback is called adaptation. (c) E. coli flagellar motor structure and
  properties. The motor consists of a rotor and several stator units, which act as
  torque generators that convert H+ flux energy into motor rotation. Several kinds
  of proteins assemble to form ring structures within the rotor: approximately 26
  copies of FliG, 34 copies of FliM, and over 100 copies of FliN assemble to form
  the C-ring. The motor rotates, repeating 26 angular steps per revolution. In the
  absence of CheY-P, the motor rotates CCW. The binding of CheY-P to FliM (and FliN)
  increases the probability of CW rotation.'
