caption: Chaperone mediated autophagy mechanism. The scheme shows the principal events
  in CMA mediated translocation of proteins through the lysosomal membrane and known
  regulatory mechanisms. (A) LAMP-2A exist as an inactive oligomer at the lysosomal
  membrane. CMA protein substrates containing KFERQ motifs and HSC70 can bind to the
  cytosolic tail of LAMP-2A with similar affinity. The short C-terminal tail of LAMP-2A
  exposed to the cytoplasm and conformed by 12 amino acids probably binds to the chaperone
  and the substrate in a competitive manner. However, on the substrate, binding sites
  for HSC70 and LAMP-2A do not overlap allowing the HSC70-substrate complexes to interact
  with LAMP-2A oligomer in a substrate dependent manner. (B) In a dynamic fashion,
  GFAP favors the formation of high molecular weight aggregates of LAMP2A. Somehow,
  coupled and simultaneous binding of the substrate to HSC70 and LAMP-2A is sensed
  by the transmembrane domains of the LAMP-2A for rearrangements in the supramolecular
  complexes. Next, substrate unfolding and translocation to the lysosomal lumen occurs.
  A lysosomal-HSC70 (Lys-hsc70) collaborates in this process. (C) A signaling pathway
  involving phosphorylating and dephosphorylating signals, where AKT, MTORC2, PHLPP1,
  RAC1, and GFAP, regulate the stabilization of the LAMP-2A complex at lysosomal membranes.
