caption: Glycolysis, TCA cycle, and gluconeogenesis in the different endosymbiotic
  bacteria. In Buchnera and “Candidatus Blochmannia,” glucose is oxidized to acetyl-CoA,
  while in Wigglesworthia, the pathway works in the opposite, gluconeogenetic direction.
  In Buchnera the TCA cycle is reduced to α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity only,
  while in “Candidatus Blochmannia” and Wigglesworthia, most energy-yielding steps
  are conserved. Transport systems for sugars and glutamate are indicated by colored
  circles or boxes. Features missing in the respective organism are highlighted in
  red. Steps between glycerol-3-phosphate and PEP are conserved in all endosymbionts
  and are not shown in the figure. Steps generating reductive power in the form of
  NADH or leading to ATP formation by substrate-level phosphorylation are indicated
  in green. αKG, α-ketoglutarate; Mqo, malate:quinone oxidoreductase; AspC, aspartate
  aminotransferase.
