caption: Hypothesis of AhR-mediated regulation of intracellular ROS. Different pathways
  of the AhR are activated at the same time, one leading to an increase in cellular
  ROS and the other(s) resulting in an antioxidant response. Possible antioxidant
  mechanisms are AhR-triggered activation of Nrf2, SOD, PONs, Srxn, CYP1A1/2, or,
  very likely, other enzymes which remain to be identified. Depending on the cell
  type, organ, ligand, or additional factors, either the prooxidant or the antioxidant
  AhR pathway predominates.
