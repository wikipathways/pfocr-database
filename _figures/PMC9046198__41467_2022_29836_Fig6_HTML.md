caption: MraY exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium with dimerisation favoured in
  the presence of endogenous C55-P and lipid I. MraY binds lipid substrates to stabilise
  its dimeric state. Synthesis of lipid I via MraY can be effected in vitro from C55-P
  and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, and a change in mass confirms that endogenous lipid
  I was displaced by its biosynthetic counterpart. Tunicamycin binds to MraY and inhibits
  lipid I formation. MurG binds to lipid I with a higher affinity than MraY, to drive
  the passage of lipid I along the pathway, and forms lipid II in the presence of
  UDP-GlcNAc. The flippase MurJ then outcompetes MurG and MraY to bind lipid II, forming
  the binary 1:1 complex. Lipid II is flipped into the periplasm where its polar disaccharide
  peptide head is incorporated into the peptidoglycan polymer.
