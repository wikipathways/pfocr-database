caption: Protein-Protein interaction network. The proteins encoded by the validated
  target genes of the selected up- and down-regulated microRNAs were used as input
  in STRING software (https://string-db.org). Proteins are represented with nodes
  and the physical direct interactions with continuous lines. Line thickness indicates
  the strength of association amongst individual partners. The colour present in some
  nodes indicates the pathway in which the protein is involved. Endocrine resistance
  refers uniquely to endocrine resistance within specific treatments for cancer based
  on the data contained in the database.
