caption: 'Common mechanisms underlying megaloblastic anemia and drug-induced megaloblastic
  anemia. Major causes of megaloblastic anemia (MA) include deficiencies of vitamin
  B12 and folic acid due to inadequate dietary intake or malabsorption. MA due to
  drug exposure is also known as drug-induced megaloblastic anemia (DIMA). DIMA can
  be caused by a variety of drugs that inhibit DNA synthesis at different points of
  the DNA synthesis pathway. a Drugs can cause MA by reducing cellular availability
  of vitamin B12 or folic acid through reduced absorption, plasma transport, or delivery
  of folate or vitamin B12 or physical destruction of the vitamins (mechanisms #1
  and #2). b Additional mechanisms of DIMA include inhibition of key enzymes such
  as dihydrofolate reductase resulting in tetrahydrofolate deficiency (mechanism #3)
  and drugs acting as purine and pyrimidine antagonists or analogs, including chemotherapies
  (5-fluorouracil), immune antagonists (e.g., leflunomide), and antiviral agents (mechanism
  #4). Interestingly, some drugs cause MA through an unknown mechanism. We propose
  an unknown mechanism of DIMA may involve inhibition of SLC19A2 in hematopoietic
  cells (mechanism #5)'
