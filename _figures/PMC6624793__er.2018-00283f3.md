caption: Serotonin receptor expression and signaling pathways. The seven distinct
  serotonin receptors (HTRx) families have unique tissue-specific distributions and
  can be grouped into four distinct downstream signaling pathways. The HTR2pathway
  employs the G-protein αq/11 subunit (Gq/G11), which induces phospholipase C (PLC),
  leading to the upregulation of inositol triphosphate (IP3), calcium, and diacylglycerol
  (DAG), which activates protein kinase C (PKC). HTR1/HTR5 use the G-protein αi subunit
  (Gi/Go) that inhibits adenylate cyclase (AC), thereby reducing the production of
  cAMP from ATP. HTR4/HTR6/HTR7 use the G-protein αs subunit (Gs) that activates AC,
  which increases cAMP and induces the phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA).
  HTR3 is a serotonin-gated ion channel that increases intracellular concentrations
  of cations, which can cause cell depolarization.
