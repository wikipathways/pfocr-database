caption: 'Schematic overview of HTR''s effect on renal fibrosis in STZ-induced diabetic
  rats. ECM accumulation, the characteristic of fibrosis, is a main pathological change
  in DN. As we all know, oxidative stress and inflammation, which promote each other,
  are the critical causes of TGF-β1-induced excessive synthesis and deposition of
  ECM in DN. Interestingly, AMPK acts as the upstream of Nrf2. The activation of AMPK/Nrf2
  pathway can inhibit the Nox4-induced oxidative stress and attenuate NFκB-induced
  inflammation. HTR enhances the activity of AMPK/Nrf2 pathway and suppresses oxidative
  stress and inflammation, thereby decreasing the ECM deposition and delaying the
  progression of fibrosis in DN (⟶: activated; ⊣: inhibited).'
