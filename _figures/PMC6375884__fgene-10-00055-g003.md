caption: A schematic representation of main processes involved in rice drought memory
  response. The glycolysis pathway was actived under drought stress, the pyruvate
  generated was the precursor substance of pigment and signals of chloroplast, which
  activated upstream genes of ABA signaling. ABA signaling pathway played the central
  role signals to improve plant drought resistance by active the expression of TFs
  encoded in the nucleus, genes of energy metabolism in mitochondria, proline synthase
  and JAZs of JA signaling pathway. Broken lines indicate possible, but not confirmed,
  routes. Full lines represent the routes have been demonstrated in previous studies.
  Heatmap of memory transcripts involved in these pathways are shown.
