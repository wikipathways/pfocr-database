caption: Schematic representation of the n-3 and n-6 fatty acid biosynthetic pathway
  with the enzymes responsible for each step of desaturation/elongation depicted in
  gray boxes. The partial β-oxidation that results in docosapentaenoic acid (DPA)
  or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) formation is highlighted in blue. Differences occurring
  at each step are marked red in the chemical structure. Adapted from Marszalek and
  Lodish [].
