caption: A Model of Phosphorylation SwitchProtomer A contains a high-affinity nitrate-binding
  site, whereas protomer B contains a relatively low-affinity binding site. Binding
  of nitrate ion triggers an allosteric communication between the binding site and
  the T101 site in protomer A that primes the T101 site for phosphorylation and is
  responsible for activating the immediate downstream component of the nitrate signaling
  CBL9.CIPK23 complex at low nitrate concentration. In contrast, such an allosteric
  communication pathway is absent in protomer B. At low nitrate concentrations, nitrate
  ion binds only at the high-affinity site of protomer A and activates the CBL9.CIPK23
  complex. At high nitrate concentrations, nitrate binds to both the sites of protomer
  A and protomer B and then continuously inhibits the activity of the CBL9.CIPK23
  complex along the increasing gradient of nitrate.
