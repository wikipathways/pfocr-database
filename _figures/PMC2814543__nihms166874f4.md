caption: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an important checkpoint kinase that
  transmits signals related to amino-acid sufficiency and protein synthesis. A hyperactive
  mTOR pathway has been associated with increased signalling induced by the unfolded-protein
  response (UPR) and with the activation of JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), which can
  lead to increased inflammation and insulin resistance through serine phosphorylation
  of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Inflammation can further activate mTOR,
  through IκB kinase (IKK)-mediated phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex
  1 (TSC1), as can the UPR through the induction of activating transcription factor
  6 (ATF6; not shown). This leads to a vicious inflammatory cycle in metabolically
  stressed cells. The UPR and IKK activation can also lead to leptin resistance through
  the induction of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1β (PTB1β) and suppressor
  of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), respectively. 4EBP1, eukaryotic translation-initiation
