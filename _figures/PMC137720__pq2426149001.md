caption: 'FIH-1 hydroxylates HIF-1α at Asn-803. The FIH-1 active site contains Fe(II)
  coordinated by three protein side chains: His-199, Asp-201, and His-279. The enzyme
  binds 2-OG, HIF peptide substrate, and molecular oxygen to facilitate hydroxylation
  of the β-carbon on Asn-803 of HIF-1α. In the course of the reaction, molecular oxygen
  is consumed and 2-OG is converted into succinate and carbon dioxide.'
