caption: Schematic representation of arginine metabolism and the interplay between
  cellular players in the prostate tumor microenvironment. The activities of ARGs
  and iNOS are illustrated, together with arginine-activated downstream pathways in
  cellular components of the tumor microenvironment (androgen-responsive prostate
  cancer cell, macrophages, antitumor T-cell, MSCs). The most relevant pathophysiological
  implications of arginine metabolism are reduced cancer immunosurveillance and a
  stimulatory action in prostate malignant cells towards cancer progression. Solid
  black lines with arrows indicate the main enzymatic activity or movement of molecules,
  whereas dashed lines indicate alternative metabolic pathways or suppression of the
  movement of molecules. Solid blue lines with arrows designate a stimulatory effect
  in enzyme activity, while solid red lines with blunt ends specify inhibition of
  enzyme activity or transporter activity. While pro-tumoral M2 macrophages present
  increased activity of ARGs with subsequent proline and polyamines production that
  result in collagen deposition and higher cell proliferation, the antitumoral M1
  macrophages (commonly found out of the tumor microenvironment) have an overactive
  iNOS pathway with resulting pro-inflammatory stimulus (NRF2L2 and NFKB1 overexpression),
  reduced cell growth and production of reactive oxygen (hydrogen peroxide) and nitrogen
  species (peroxynitrites) that ultimately induce cytotoxicity and tissue injury.
  The iNOS and ARGs enzymes are tightly regulated by cytokine and metabolic circuits,
  although these enzymes also directly activate biochemical circuits that negatively
  regulate each other. As a resulting effect of arginine metabolism and capture in
  M2 macrophages, several pro-tumoral growth factors are produced and secreted to
  the tumor microenvironment (VEGF, EGF, TGFβ), while reducing the extracellular pool
  of free arginine that will contribute to their immune suppression and tissue repair
  phenotype. By producing IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β1 anti-inflammatory cytokines, tumor
  cells also contribute not only to macrophages differentiation towards M2 but also
  to the regulation of arginine metabolism in macrophages (activating ARGs and downregulating
  iNOS). Together with tumor cells and MDSCs, macrophages also contribute to increased
  levels of urea as a result of higher ARGs activity in these cells, which will impair
  mTOR signaling and T-cell receptor CD3 ζ-chain subunit mRNA translation, thus resulting
  in hindered antitumor T-cell activation. The hypoxic tumoral microenvironment increases
  HIF1A expression and protein production by tumor cells, which signals downstream
  to increase arginine-iNOS pathway activation that results in increased production
  of nitric oxide, and reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. While NO can impact antitumor
  T-cell activation through nitrosylation of target proteins and suppression of the
  IL-2/IL-2R pathway, peroxynitrites may hamper CCL2 binding and prevent T-cell chemoattraction
  towards tumors, and reactive oxygen species can influence negatively antitumor T-cell
  activation. Moreover, the particularity of prostate tumor cells’ dependence on androgens
  implies its influence in ARG1 and ARG2 expression, which will potentiate the urea
  cycle towards polyamines and proline production with resulting increases in cell
  proliferation and collagen synthesis. In addition, the overexpression of ARG1 and
  ARG2 will lead to ARGs exportation out of the cell, where they might sequester extracellular
  arginine, further increasing immunosuppression. MDSCs also metabolize arginine either
  through the ARG-NO cycle or the UREA cycle (). MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment
  might secrete NO, reactive oxygen species, and ARGs receptors out of the cell, which
  will contribute to the suppression of IL-2/IL-2R pathway of T-cells, decreased activation
  of antitumor T-cells and sequestering of extracellular arginine, respectively, ultimately
  leading to reduced cancer immunosurveillance. 5-DHT, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone;
