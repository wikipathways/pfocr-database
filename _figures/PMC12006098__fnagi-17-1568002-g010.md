caption: Galangin attenuated MPTP-induced brain tissue injury in PD model mice, and
  the related mechanism may be related to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. MPTP-induced
  neuronal injury in the brain of PD model mice exhibited α-syn aggregation, decreased
  TH expression, increased inflammatory factor levels, and high autophagy levels.
  Activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway could alleviate the autophagy level to
  a certain extent, reduce inflammation, decrease α-syn aggregation and promote TH
  expression, and finally repair the activity of dopaminergic neurons. Therefore,
  we demonstrate the preventive and therapeutic potential of Galangin in attenuating
  PD, at least in part, by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. MPTP, N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine;
