caption: 'In one scenario (right), IL-15 binds to its high affinity IL-15Rα expressed
  on an antigen-presenting cell and in turn is presented in trans to the IL-2/15Rβγ
  heterodimer. From there, effector cell activation can proceed via three distinct
  pathways: one involves JAK-STAT activation with the phosphorylated STAT proteins
  forming a heterodimer and trafficking to the nucleus for transcriptional activation;
  a second pathway involves the recruitment of Shc to a phosphorylated site on the
  IL-2/15Rβ chain followed by activation of Grb2. From there, Grb2 can proceed down
  a PI3K pathway to phosphorylate Akt, or can bind the guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor SOS to activate RAS-RAF and ultimately MAPK. Each contributes to effector
  cell survival and activation.In mast cells (left), IL-15 signals through a unique
  receptor chain, IL-15RX, to activate the JAK2/STAT5 pathway. IL-15 can also bind
  to the common γ chain to transmit its signals via Tyk2/STAT6 for initiation of a
  survival (Bcl-XL) and a Th2 immune response.Therapeutic interventions using anti-IL-15R
  antibody prevents binding and signaling of IL-15 through its receptor. Pharmacological
  inhibitors targeting the JAK/STAT pathway prevent activation and translocation of
  the STAT heterodimer to the nucleus. Finally, proteasomal inhibitors such as bortezomib
  prevent activation of NF-κB and Myc. Each of these therapies targets IL-15 signaling
  in malignant cells, but may have consequences for normal cells dependent upon IL-15.'
