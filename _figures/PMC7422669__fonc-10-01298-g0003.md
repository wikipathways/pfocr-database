caption: Engulfment of apoptotic tumor cells induces LAP to inhibit type I IFN response
  and polarize tumor associated macrophages toward the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype.
  This process leads to suppressed TIL function, reduced anti-tumor response and ultimately,
  sustained tumor survival. LAP deficiency leads to polarization of TAMs toward the
  pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and stimulation of a STING-dependent type I IFN response,
  which enhances TIL function and expression of IFNγ to inhibit tumor growth. Taken
  together, these mechanisms suggest that targeting the LAP pathway may have therapeutic
  potential. IFN, interferon; TIL, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; STING, stimulator
  of interferon genes; IFNγ, interferon gamma. *Created with BioRender.
