caption: Role of irisin in the regulation of MSC proliferation and differentiation.
  Irisin upregulates autophagy through activation of the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 L complex
  and activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby inhibiting lipogenic differentiation
  and promoting osteogenic differentiation. Irisin exerts its regulatory effects on
  osteogenic differentiation also through the AMPK/BMP/SMAD pathway. In addition,
  Irisin promotes chondrogenic differentiation through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
  By regulating the differentiation process of MSCs, Irisin mitigates metabolic disruptions
  in OA cartilage and subchondral bone, sustaining architecture and promoting repair
