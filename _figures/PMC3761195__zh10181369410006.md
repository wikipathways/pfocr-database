caption: Proposed model of the intracellular signals necessary for the GLP-1R activation-mediated
  suppression of food intake. Our previous work established that activation of hindbrain
  GLP-1R results in a cAMP-dependent increase in PKA activity, which in turn increases
  P42/44 MAPK phosphorylation and decreases AMPK activation. Based on the present
  findings, we hypothesize that cAMP-dependent activation of PKA increases phosphorylation
  of PI3K, allowing for the phosphatidylinositol (,,)-trisphosphate (PIP3)-dependent
  translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane and subsequent reduction of Akt phosphorylation
  at Ser473. We predict that the activation of AMPK and Akt converge on the mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway
  and forkhead box O (FOXO), resulting in protein synthesis that may drive the long-lasting
  effects of GLP-1R-mediated food intake suppression. Dashed lines indicate putative
  signaling pathways relevant for the control of GLP-1R activation-induced reduction
  of food intake and body weight. PIP2, phosphatidylinositol (,)-bisphosphate.
