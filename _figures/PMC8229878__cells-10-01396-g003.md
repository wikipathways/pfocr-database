caption: 'Schematic representation of miRNAs influencing the occurrence of PCOS. MiR-320a
  is significantly downregulated in CCs, resulting in decreased steroidogenesis due
  to dysregulation of RUNX2 and CYP11A1/CYP19A1. In GCs, both miR-93 and miR-21 are
  upregulated and positively correlated with free testosterone and the androgen index,
  whereas miR-483 and miR-145 are downregulated. MiR-483 directly targets the IGF1
  mRNA, leading to decreased cell proliferation. IRS1 mRNA is a direct target of miR-145,
  leading to inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway, resulting in decreased
  cell proliferation. Abbreviations—RUNX2: runt-related transcription factor 2; CYP11A1:
