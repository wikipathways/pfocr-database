caption: Schematic summary of the different functions performed by the seven ER-resident
  selenoproteins.Pathologies and cellular dysfunctions associated with each of them
  are indicated. SELENON is activated by low ER calcium level. This leads to its interaction
  with SERCA pump and its activation. Its loss of function leads to hypersensibility
  to ERO1, defect in Ca2+ reuptake, and to a disease called SEPN1-related myopathy
  associated with insulin resistance. SELENOM reduces ROS level in cell culture and
  is able to interact with Gal1, a lectin with higher affinity for galactose, preventing
  neurodegeneration and promoting neuroprotection in the brain. Deletion of SELENOM
  leads to obesity without cognitive impairment. SELENOT deletion from neuronal precursor
  leads to brain growth retardation associated to high ROS levels, and increased vulnerability
  to neurodegeneration. It interacts with the OST complex and modulates N-glycosylation.
  Its inhibition leads to secretion defects and ER stress in endocrine cells. Dio2
  catalyzes the deiodination of T4 (3,5,3′,5′-tetraiodothyronine) into T3 (3,5,3′-triiodothyronine).
  DIO2 in the brain may be a determinant of well-being and neurocognitive function.
  The Thr92Ala mutation, a well-studied polymorphism present in 12–36% of the population,
  leads to ER stress and hypothyroidism. This mutation is presumably responsible of
  a decrease of DIO2 through ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligase and degradation
  by the proteasome. SELENOS inhibition increase Tau aggregation. It is involved in
  C99 degradation through its interaction with ERAD complex involved in clearing of
  misfolded glycoproteins, and its expression correlates with NFTs from post-mortem
  human brain. SELENOS upregulation can also lead to insulin resistance. SELENOK interacts
  with SELENOS and ERAD, limiting ER stress. It also interacts with DHHC6, a protein
  responsible for IP3R palmitoylation, a necessary step for its stabilization. It
  is believed that this link with Ca2+ regulation supports microglial migration and
  Aβ deposit clearance in AD. SELENOF is a partner of UGGT, a folding sensor of the
  ER transferring a glucose residue to the A branch of oligomannoses from misfolded
  glycoproteins to make it join the quality control process. If the protein isn't
  correctly folded after a few cycles, it will join the ERAD pathway. SELENOF deletion
  in animal leads to an early age cataract. This could be due to an increase of misfolded
  protein or to the lack of interaction with RDH11, a protein involved in vitamin
  A metabolism.
