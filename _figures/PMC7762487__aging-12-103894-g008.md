caption: PPI network and KEGG pathway analysis for the differentially expressed MAM
  proteins in PSD and PDZ rats. Intricate PPI networks among the differential proteins
  in the PSD:ZDF (A) and PDZ:PSD (B) groups. Balls represent proteins, some of which
  are increased (red balls), others decreased (green balls). KEGG pathway enrichment
  analysis for differential proteins in the PSD:ZDF (C) and PDZ:PSD (D) rats. Alzheimer's
  disease pathway map in PSD:ZDF (E) and PDZ:PSD (F) rats, respectively. Oxidative
  phosphorylation pathway map in PSD:ZDF (G) and PDZ:PSD (H) rats, respectively. The
  upregulated and downregulated proteins are labeled in pink and green, respectively.
