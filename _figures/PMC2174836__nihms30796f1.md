caption: Activation of phospholipases (PLA2, PC-PLC, PI-PLC and PLD) following cerebral
  ischemia results in release of lipid second messengers 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG),
  phosphatidic acid (PA), lyso-phosphatidic acid (lyso-PA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA),
  and arachidonic acid (ArAc). PA and DAG can be readily inter-converted by phosphohydrolases
  and DAG-kinases. ArAc undergoes further metabolism by cyclooxygenases/lipoxygenases
  (COX/LOX) to generate important signaling and vasoactive eicosanoids. Free radicals
  are formed during ArAc metabolism by COX/LOX and free radical generation can be
  induced by eicosanoids. ArAc generates pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, leukotrienes,
  and thromboxanes as well as LOX-generated anti-inflammatory lipoxins. Through the
  LOX pathway, DHA is metabolized to anti-inflammatory resolvins and protectins, including
  10,17S-docosatriene (Neuroprotectin D1), an endogenous neuroprotectant. B). Glycerophospholipid
  and sphingolipid relationship. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1
  (IL-1) activate neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) and acidic sphingomyelinase (A-SMase)
  through stimulation of PLA2 and PC-PLC and release of ArAc and DAG, respectively.
  N-SMase and A-SMase hydrolyze sphingomyelin (SM) to liberate ceramide. SM synthase
  transfers the phosphocholine head-group of PC to ceramide to form SM and DAG.
