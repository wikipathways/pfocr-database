caption: Modulating apoptosis by African swine fever virus (ASFV). ASFV proteins are
  shown in red ellipses. pA224L, an IAPs homolog protein, interacts with activated
  caspase-3 to inhibit apoptosis and elevates NF-κB activity to increase anti-apoptotic
  gene expressions of cFLIP, cIAP2 and c-rel. pA179L, a Bcl-2 homolog, interacts with
  a series of BH3-only proteins and prevents apoptosis. pDP71L interacts with eIF2α
  and then dephosphorylates eIF2α by recruiting PP1α, thus suppressing eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP
  apoptotic pathway. pEP153R reduces the transactivating activity of the cellular
  protein p53 and then inhibits apoptosis related gene expressions. pE183L (p54) induces
  apoptosis via possibly pro-apoptotic factor Bim translocation to mitochondria. pE199L
  competes with Bak for anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-XL to activate pro-apoptotic factor
  Bak, and promotes another pro-apoptotic factor Bax translocation to mitochondria,
  thus inducing mitochondrial dependent apoptosis.
