caption: Impaired NHEJ-mediated DNA repair causes genomic instability and selective
  degeneration of motor neurons in SMA. Graphical models (A–E) showing the activation
  DNA damage response (DDR) pathways caused by acute and chronic SMN-deficiencies,
  which result in R-loop accumulation leading to DNA damage in SMN-deficient cells.
  (A) SMN deficiency, acute (knockdown of SMN) and chronic (SMA) result in downregulation
  of SETX, which causes accumulation of R-loops and DNA damage. (B) Acute SMN-deficiency
  in normal human dividing cells causes activation of DDR and Homologous recombination
  (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathways. (C) Chronic SMN-deficiency
  in SMA patient dividing cells causes activation of DDR and HR to repair double-strand
  breaks (DSBs) but NHEJ pathway is impaired due to downregulation of DNA-PKcs, a
  critical factor required for NHEJ-mediated DSBs repair. (D) Chronic SMN-deficiency
  in SMA motor neurons causes activation of DDR. However, HR is inactive and NHEJ
  pathway is impaired due to downregulation of DNA-PKcs, which results in gradual
  accumulation of DNA damage leading to genomic instability and motor neuron degeneration.
  The single-strand breaks (SSBs) and transcription-coupled nucleotide exchange repair
  (TC-NER) pathways may be active in SMA neurons but not sufficient to prevent DSBs.
  (E) Chronic SMN-deficiency in SMA terminally-differentiated cells other than neurons
  such as skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, and heart cells may also cause R-loop-mediated
  DNA damage and activation of SSBs and DSBs repair pathways. Graphical model adapted
  and modified from Kannan et al. ().

  description: Impaired NHEJ-mediated DNA repair causes genomic instability and selective

    DNA damage response (DDR) pathways caused by acute and chronic SMN-deficiencies,
    which result in R-loop accumulation leading to DNA damage in SMN-deficient cells.
    (A) SMN deficiency, acute (knockdown of SMN) and chronic (SMA) result in downregulation
    of SETX, which causes accumulation of R-loops and DNA damage. (B) Acute SMN-deficiency
    in normal human dividing cells causes activation of DDR and Homologous recombination

    The single-strand breaks (SSBs) and transcription-coupled nucleotide exchange
    repair (TC-NER) pathways may be active in SMA neurons but not sufficient to prevent
