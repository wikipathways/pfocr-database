caption: Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) sense the microbial environment via pattern
  recognition receptors including toll-like receptors (TLR) and take up diet and microbiota-derived
  metabolites. Activation of TLR signaling can impact the electron transport chain
  (ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) via TNF receptor associated factor
  (TRAF) 6 and ECSIT (Evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathway),
  altering production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Viral sensing involves mitochondrial
  antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and initiates inflammatory responses i.e., activating
  NFκB pathway. Microbiota-derived metabolites feed the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  and mitochondrial beta oxidation or can enhance cellular energetics through salvage
  pathways (purines). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced by bacteria can as electron
  donor for the ETC, but at high concentrations, inhibit Complex IV activity and other
  mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondria are embedded in an organelle network, in particular,
  an exchange of calcium, FAD, and ATP with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) occurs
  at mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) and is important for ER oxidative protein
  folding. Proteostasis, depending on protein import, chaperone activity, and proteases,
  is crucial to sustain mitochondrial functions, and disturbances of mitochondrial
  proteostasis are signaled by the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt).
  Release of mitochondrial DNA and double-stranded (ds) mitochondrial RNA under stress
  conditions promotes inflammatory signaling and regulates cell cycle progression.
  Fission and fusion events as well as mitophagy are critical regulators of mitochondrial
  homeostasis and prevent accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and excess ROS
  production. Thus, mitochondria integrate environmental signals into metabolism,
  downstream employing various signaling pathways to contribute to cell fate decisions
  and determine cellular phenotypes. Gene names of known IBD risk variants involved
  in mitochondrial functions are given in dark red. AMPK AMP-activated protein kinase,
  NLRP3 NLR family pyrin domain containing 3, PGC1α Peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, PKR double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase,
