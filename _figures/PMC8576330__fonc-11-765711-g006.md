caption: 'Depending on the transcription factor to which it will bind, YAP regulates
  the key functions of tumor development. (1) TEAD is crucial for YAP-driven cell
  proliferation and primary tumor growth: YAP/TEAD stimulates cell proliferation by
  regulating the expression of genes directly involved in cell cycle control or by
  regulating the expression of mediators of other signaling pathways involved in the
  cell cycle, such as Gli or AKT. (2) TGF-β/Smad3 is crucial for YAP-driven lung metastasis
  development: TGF-β stimulates “EMT-like”, cell migration and invasion in part by
  increasing MMP-2/MMP-9 expression. TGF-β upregulates the expression of osteolytic
  factors such as RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) and
  IL-11 (interleukin-11) and therefore stimulate bone osteolysis and the secretion
  of protumoral factors. TGF-β upregulates PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) and
  VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) expression, and therefore angiogenesis.'
