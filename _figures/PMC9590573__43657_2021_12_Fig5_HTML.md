caption: Integration of metabolic change with the phenotypic difference between the
  inflorescences of Ler and Col-0, and the DSBR model. a Phenotypic difference between
  inflorescences of Ler and Col-0, and the metabolic change in the inflorescences
  of these two ecotypes. b Integration of metabolic profile into the DSBR model. Meiotic
  recombination is a conserved process that initiates from the formation of DSBs catalyzed
  by AtSPO11-1. A 3′ single-strand DNA overhang is produced by resecting the DSB ends.
  The overhang can invade into a non-sister chromatid with the help of AtRAD51 and
  AtDMC1 to form a D loop. AtPOL2A and AtRFC1 assist in synthesizing the leading strand
  and lagging strand, respectively, in the Type I CO pathway. Metabolites in the orange
  boxes denote significant increases in relevant recombination-defective mutants.
  Metabolites in blue boxes denote significant decreases and those in white boxes
  represent no significant change. Metabolite identities are listed in the abbreviation
  list
