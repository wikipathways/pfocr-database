caption: 'Metabolic fluxes in C. glutamicum in growth and production phases of two
  different glutamate production activities. Dotted arrows indicate fluxes for biomass.
  Left, middle, and right values in boxes indicate fluxes in the growth and production
  phases, where glutamate fluxes were 20 and 68, respectively. In this study, the
  fluxes with backward (exchange) reactions, i.e., those in glycolysis, the pentose
  phosphate pathway, the latter steps of the TCA cycle (succinate → oxaloacetate),
  and C1 metabolisms, are shown as net values [22]. Abbreviations: Gly, glycine; Ser,
  serine; Glu, glutamate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; FBP,
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  Pyr, pyruvate; Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; Xu5P, xylulose-5-phosphate;
  S7P, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate; AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; IsoCit,
