caption: 'Cell-cell coupling in the somitogenesis clock. (a) Representation of the
  intercellular coupling achieved by Delta/Notch communication and the feedback loop
  underlying the generation of lfng oscillations in the chick embryo. The Delta ligand
  binds Notch receptor on adjacent cells activating the Notch signaling cascade. Notch
  intracellular domain (NCID) is released and translocated into the nucleus, where
  it activates the transcription of hairy1, hairy2, and lfng (black arrows). Lfng
  protein modifies Notch making it less sensitive to activation by Delta (red arrows).
  This effect is transient due to the short life of lfng. Oscillations are thus generated
  by alternation between activation of lfng expression and repression of Notch by
  lfng []. (b) Molecular clock synchronization through intercellular coupling occurs
  during somitogenesis: cyclic expression in the individual cell is synchronized by
  cell-cell coupling mediated by the Notch signaling pathway (black spiral). This
  intrinsic mechanism ensures robust oscillations (blue spiral) and rapid recovery
  following external perturbations []. S0 represents the forming somite and SI and
  SII represent the two most recent formed somites.'
