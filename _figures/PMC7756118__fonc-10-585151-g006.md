caption: Hypothetical model of the signaling pathway involving in megakaryocytic differentiation
  in normal and leukemic marrow. Multifactorial model showing key players in the Mk
  development under normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. Drug metabolism determines
  tissue level of gilteritinib in each patient. Due to an extremely high variability
  of metabolic enzymes, genetic polymorphisms, drug interactions, and diets, a wide
  range of gilteritinib tissue concentration is expected. Gilteritinib at low concentration
  selectively inhibit constitutive Flt3 activity, but not AXL. At high concentration,
  gilteritinib inhibits increased AXL in leukemia patients disinhibiting its Mk inhibitory
  activity. Interactions between constitutive Flt3 activity, STAT5 activation, transcription
  factor (NMP1), and epigenetic modifications (DNMT3A) could impact Mk differentiation
  through Flt3/AXL crosstalk. HSCs, hematopoietic stem cells; Mk, megakaryocyte.
