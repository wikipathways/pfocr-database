caption: Role of secreted and membrane-bound DLK1 in adult neural stem cell niches
  and in glioma cancer stem cell niches. In the neural stem cell niches, astrocytes
  express the full-length, cleavable form of DLK1 (upper cells) while the neural stem
  cells express the membrane-bound form (bottom cells). The expression of both DLK1
  forms in the different cell types is necessary for the inhibition of differentiation
  and the maintenance of the stem cell pool. In glioma stem cell niches, the reactive
  astrocyte-secreted DLK1 (upper cells) stimulates cancer cell stemness and growth
  mainly enhancing HIF-2 activity through a yet unidentified pathway. Moreover, in
  the cancer cells (bottom), the activation of HIFs induce an ADAM17-dependent cleavage
  of DLK1 and the release of the intracellular domain (ICD) that then translocates
  to the nucleus. Here, DLK1 ICD promotes cancer cell stemness and invasiveness mainly
  through the induction of a metabolic switch that allows a better adaptation to the
  hypoxic niche environment.
