caption: Proposed mechanism by which α-syn aggregates activate the cGAS/STING pathway.
  α-syn fibril accumulation in microglia results in double-stranded breaks (DSB) in
  genomic DNA. Misplaced self-DNA is sensed by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), producing
  2′3′ cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP acts on STING dimers which recruit TANK-binding
  kinase 1 (TBK1) and promotes auto-phosphorylation. pTBK1 is then able to act on
  transcription factors that up-regulate type-1 interferon expression. Activation
  of this innate immune pathway in microglia leads to neurodegeneration in the substantia
  nigra.
