caption: (A) Upon MERS-CoV infection of nasal epithelial cells, PRRs and IRFs are
  engaged to induce IFNs and ISGs exerting their effects in an autocrine or paracrine
  manner. Upregulation of IL10 combined with the action of type III IFNs will result
  in a dimmed synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines under NF-κB control. Induced
  chemokines lead to focal, mild infiltration of leukocytes. The paracrine effect
  of IFNs is evidenced in the nasal submucosa where ISGs are upregulated without endogenous
  induction of IFNs. IL10 and type III IFNs will act on the NF-κB pathway preventing
  production of IL8 and IL1β mRNAs depriving the NLRP3 inflammasome of its substrate.
  Slight increased levels of IRF5 mRNAs will indicate the presence of few M1 macrophages
  in the submucosa. Blue, red and white arrows indicate upregulation, downregulation
  and unaltered gene transcription respectively. (B) Concomitant to decreased viral
  loads, transcription of ISGs is lowered in trachea and lungs where IFNs are not
  induced. Infiltration of mainly mononuclear leukocytes occurs in the lungs as a
  result of chemokine synthesis in the absence of IRF5 induction but upregulation
  of IL15. Thus, reduced number of M1 macrophages and activation of NK cells will
  contribute to a controlled inflammation and clearance of the virus. PI, Pro-inflammatory
  cytokines; NI, not induced.
