caption: 'Left panel: Normal functioning of SVCT2 in non-stimulated microglia. SVCT2
  is expressed in the plasma membrane and concentrates ascorbate in the intracellular
  space. Right panel: After a pro-inflammatory challenge, microglia reduces the expression
  of the SVCT2 in the plasma membrane (for the detailed signaling pathway involved
  in this process, please see []), resulting in decreased ascorbate uptake, which
  disrupts ascorbate homeostasis and activates microglia in a NF-κB-dependent manner.
  Therefore, decreasing ascorbate uptake in microglia, leads to ineffective inhibition
  of NF-κB, which triggers the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF,
  IL-1β, IL-6 and NO.'
