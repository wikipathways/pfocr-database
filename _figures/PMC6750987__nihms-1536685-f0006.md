caption: Upon exposure to 50 μM TCS for 12 h, PC12 cells viability was decreased (A),
  and ROS production was increased (B). Both antiapoptotic proteins mTOR and Akt (C)
  display decreased phosphorylation. We also observed increased phosphorylation of
  p38 MAPK (D), which has been shown to participate in apoptosis. Due to increased
  expression of Bax (E), it is likely that apoptosis takes place. Treatment with N-acetyl
  cysteine (NAC) decreased ROS in this model (F). However it remains to be determined
  whether oxidative stress plays a role in the alterations observed in this study
  (G).
