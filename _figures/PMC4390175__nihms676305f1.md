caption: MicroRNA biogenesis. MicroRNA genes are first transcribed in the nucleus
  by RNA polymerases as pri-miRNA, and subsequently cleaved by the DROSHA enzyme to
  an oligonucleotide stem loop pre-miRNA. In an alternate pathway, microRNA genes
  are transcribed directly as short hairpin pre-miRNA. The pre-miRNA is then pumped
  into the cytosol by Exportin-5, where it is further processed by DICER to a miRNA
  duplex. The duplex is then unwound, and the single-strand microRNA is incorporated
  into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) along with Argonautes and other proteins.
  The microRNA guides the RISC complex to complementary sites on messenger RNA, leading
  to epigenetic regulation via mRNA degradation or translation inhibition. Meanwhile,
  the passenger strand of the duplex miRNA is either degraded or acts as a second
  active microRNA (generally designated as the miR* or miR-5p counterpart).
