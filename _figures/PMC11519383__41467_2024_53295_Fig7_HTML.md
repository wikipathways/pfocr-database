caption: Skin fibroblasts in cancer patients who undergo radiotherapy exhibit enduring
  epigenetic alterations, including heightened chromatin accessibility at the THBS1
  gene locus. Following skin injury, such as during surgery, the TGF-β signaling pathway
  triggers RUNX1-dependent transcription of THBS1. The elevated and sustained expression
  of THBS1 in RT+ fibroblasts hampers cellular motility, contractility, and delays
  the healing process. However, the inhibition of THBS1 enhances fibroblast functionality
  and facilitates tissue repair, indicating a prospective therapeutic approach for
  addressing radiation ulcers. Figure 7 was created with BioRender.com released under
