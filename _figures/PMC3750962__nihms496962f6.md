caption: Model showing the regulation of the dlx and gad1b genes in the zebrafish
  forebrain. In the telencephalon, ascl1a controls Tg(dlx1URE2:GFP) activity and may
  modulate dlx1a/2a expression. The dlx1a/2a genes will regulate dlx5a expression
  via its CREs. A currently unknown genetic pathway controls the expression of gad1b
  in the telencephalon as knockdown of ascl1a, dlx1a/2a or dlx5a/6a has little or
  no effect on transcription. In the diencephalon, specifically the ventral part of
  the prethalamus and the hypothalamus, ascl1a controls the expression of dlx1a/2a
  which then regulates dlx5a/6a and gad1b in this tissue. The dlx5a/6a genes may play
  a minor role in gad1b regulation in the diencephalon (as shown by dashed black line).

  GABAergic interneurons in the zebrafish diencephalon.
