caption: The canonical cAMP signalling pathway. Following the binding of agonist,
  a Gs-protein coupled receptor (GsPCR) such as the β2-adrenoceptor, or a Gi-protein
  coupled receptor (GiPCR); for example, muscarinic M2 Acetylcholine receptor undergoes
  a conformational change promoting the dissociation of the Gα subunit from the Gβγ
  dimer. Whereas the Gαi-protein has an inhibitory effect on AC, the Gαs-protein stimulates
  AC inducing it to catalyse the formation of cAMP from ATP. Binding of cAMP to PKA
  results in the release of the PKA catalytic subunits allowing them to phosphorylate
  a wide range of cellular targets, with the net result being bronchorelaxation (see
  text for further details).
