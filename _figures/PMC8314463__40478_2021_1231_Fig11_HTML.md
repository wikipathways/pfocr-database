caption: Schematic illustration of FT upregulation pathways leading to AD and reversal
  by FT deletion or inhibition. Aberrant upregulation of FT/protein farnesylation
  increases the membrane association of farnesylated proteins, including Ras and Rheb,
  and their interactions with downstream effectors, leading to hyperactivation of
  mTORC1 signaling and AD. Deletion or inhibition of FT results in the reduced membrane
  association of Ras and Rheb and reverses the pathogenic activation of the signaling
  pathway
