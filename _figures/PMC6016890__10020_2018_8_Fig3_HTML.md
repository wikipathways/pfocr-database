caption: Mechanisms behind low levels of hepcidin in liver disease. BMPR, bone morphogenetic
  protein receptor; C/EBP alpha, CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; HAMP, hepcidin
  antimicrobial peptide; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HFE, hemochromatosis protein; HH,
  hemochromatosis; HJV, hemojuvelin; IL-6, interleukin 6; InR, insulin receptor; STAT3,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; TFR2, transferrin receptor 2;
  TLR4, toll-like receptor 4. Different pathogenic factors are responsible for low
  values of hepcidin. In HH mechanisms behind low levels of hepcidin are already known
  and they include defective signalling though HJV, HFE, TFR2 or through direct inhibition
  of HAMP gene. Alcohol inhibits hepcidin expression through its actions on C/EBP,
  but also indirectly through TLR4 pathway. It is believed that TLR4 mediates this
  action of alcohol through nonparenchymal liver cells, but the paracrine signal responsible
  for this effect is unknown. HCV also suppresses hepcidin expression through oxidative
  stress, which inhibits C/EBP and STAT3 actions on HAMP. Cholestasis, on the other
  hand, suppresses hepcidin expression by inhibiting IL-6/STAT3 pathway. In AILD mechanisms
  behind low levels of hepcidin are unknown. In hepatic insulin resistance defective
  insulin signaling is linked with defective hepcidin expression, partially through
  STAT3 pathway
