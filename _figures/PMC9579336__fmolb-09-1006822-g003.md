caption: 'Model for the regulatory mechanisms of HMGCR and UBIAD1 by the mevalonate
  pathway. Accumulation of intracellular sterols (DHL, lanosterol, and certain oxysterols
  all represented as red circles) in the ER membrane (A) trigger Insig binding to
  the membrane domain of HMGCR. Insig-associated E3 ligases ubiquitinate HMGCR on
  cytosolic lysine residues (K89, K248) marking the protein for degradation by 26S
  proteosomes and subsequently diminishing mevalonate production and flux through
  the pathway. (B) Following Insig-mediated ubiquitination of HMGCR, a subset of HMGCR
  molecules is bound by UBIAD1 thereby inhibiting its ERAD. This allows the cell to
  continue to synthesize a low level of mevalonate for nonsterol isoprenoids necessary
  for cellular processes illustrated in . GGPP is the last nonsterol isoprenoid produced
  and serves as a feedback molecule. (C) As GGPP levels increase to sufficient levels
  it binds UBIAD1 that is complexed with HMGCR, triggering UBIAD1 dissociation from
  HMGCR, and UBIAD1 is transported from the ER to the Golgi in COPII vesicles. HMGCR
  released from UBIAD1 is subjected to ERAD. Abbreviations: HMGCR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  (HMG) Coenzyme A reductase; UBIAD1, UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein-1;
  DHL, 24,25-dihydrolanosterol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate;
  PDP1, type I polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase 1 or phosphatidic acid phosphatase
  type 2 domain containing 2.'
