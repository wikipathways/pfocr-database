caption: 'De novo synthesis of NAD(P) from tryptophan, nicotinamide and nicotinic
  acid. (1) Two iron porphyrin metalloproteins, tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (TDO, in
  the liver) and indolamine-pyrrole 2-3 dioxygenase (IDO, in extrahepatic tissues),
  oxidize the pyrrole moiety of Tryptophan (Trp), thus forming N-L-formylkynurenine.
  (2) Arylformamidase (AFMID) hydrolytically removes the formyl group producing kynurenine
  and is then (3) hydroxylated to 3-hydroxykynurenine by kynurenine-3 monooxygenase
  (KMO), a mitochondrial flavo-enzyme that uses O2 as a substrate and NADPH as a cofactor.
  The action of (4) kynureninase B (KYNU, a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme) and (5) 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  dioxygenase (HAAO, a nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenase) leads to production of
  2-amino-3-carboxymuconic-6-semialdehyde acid, an unstable product that (6) spontaneously
  condensates and rearranges to form quinolinic acid; then, (7) quinolinic acid is
  decarboxylated and converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide by quinolinic acid
  phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT). Nicotinic acid mononucleotide is also produced
  through the “salvage pathway”, via the action of (8) nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NPRT). The subsequent action of (9) nicotinamide/nicotinic acid-mononucleotide-adenylyltransferases
  (NMNAT1-3) and (10) NAD synthetase (NADSYN1) leads to the generation of NAD, which
  is then (11) phosphorylated to produce NADP. NAD can also derive directly from nicotinamide
  through the action of (12) nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and (13)
  nicotinamide/nicotinic acid-mononucleotide-adenylyltransferase (NMNAT1-3). Red frames:
  dietary precursors of NAD(P). Ala: alanine; Gln: glutamine; Glu: glutamate; PLP
  pyridoxal phosphate; PRPP: 5-phosphoribosyl-1- pyrophosphate.'
