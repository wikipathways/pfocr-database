caption: Vicious spirals of repeating self-accelerating oxidative stress and dysregulated
  redox and information signaling as possible causes of type 2 diabetes. Schema of
  cell events that occur at type 2 diabetes development, as related to oxidative stress
  and impaired redox homeostasis and signaling, dysfunctional insulin signaling in
  peripheral tissues, and autocrine insulin signaling in failing pancreatic β cells.
  Considered “vicious spirals” (depicted by black spirals) of progressive oxidative
  stress leading to oxidation of proteins, lipids, and DNA, notably mitochondrial
  DNA, all resulting in further turn of self-accelerating metabolic deterioration
  and specifically impairment of the glucose sensing. Progressive oxidative stress
  also impairs redox signaling and autocrine insulin signaling which further deteriorates
  fitness of β cells and their housekeeping mechanisms, specifically autophagy and
  mitochondria-specific autophagy, mitophagy, besides initiating an inappropriate
  apoptosis. Another component of oxidative stress comes from the intake of excessive
  fatty acids and lipid peroxidation products, generally termed as lipotoxicity. Yet
  another component results from elevated blood glucose as is known as glucotoxicity
  further accelerating cell oxidative stress, impairing cell maintenance, dysregulating
  information signaling and leading to advanced glycation end products (AGEs), (yet
  further accelerating oxidative stress and other cell stresses), activating polyol
  pathway and thus again contributing to pro-oxidation redox homeostasis, activating
  hexosamine pathway and dysregulating crucial survival pathways including insulin
  receptor (autocrine) signaling, and finally enhancing glycosylation and forming
  antiparallel crossed β-pleated sheet structure called amylin-derived islet amyloid,
  promoting β cell cytotoxicity.
