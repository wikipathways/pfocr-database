caption: The signaling pathways for the production and function of IFN-I after SARS-CoV-2
  infection. After infection, the genomic ssRNAs and replicative dsRNA intermediates
  of SARS-CoV-2 are recognized by endosomal toll-like receptors TLR3, 7, 8, and cytosolic
  RNA sensors, RIG-1/MDA5; next, downstream transcription factors including NF-κB
  and IRF3/7 are activated to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and IFN-I. IFN-I can activate the JAK1/TYK2–STAT1/2 pathway, promoting the formation
  of the STAT1/2/IRF9 complex and initiating the transcription of ISGs to produce
  anti-virus mediators, and it can also nonconventionally activate inflammatory pathways
  such as NF-κB and MAPK pathways to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and paradoxical hyperinflammation in COVID-19
