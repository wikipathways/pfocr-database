caption: 'Study workflow of S. aureus metabolism. Left: metabolic pathway fluxes were
  calculated using a first gene expression dataset of S. aureus strain NewHG comparing
  the wild type to pknB, stp and double-knockout mutants. Validation data (blue boxes)
  included individual qRT-PCR of selected virulence and metabolic genes and a second
  gene expression dataset of S. aureus strain NCTC 8325 (global comparison). Right:
  the glmR/yvcK regulon and the cdaA regulon are important for this. Interactions
  between these regulatory proteins and PknB involve (i) interactome analysis and
  validation with published datasets and (ii) operon/regulon model as well as phylogenetic
  analysis (highly conserved phosphorylation sites and data from other Gram-positive
  bacteria, including alignment, homology model and phylogenetic tree and model of
  the riboswitch).'
