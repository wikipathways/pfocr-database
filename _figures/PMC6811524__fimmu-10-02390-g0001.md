caption: Canonical/β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling. In the pathway off state, the
  β-catenin destruction complex consisting of APC, CK1, GSK3β, and AXIN binds β-catenin
  leading to its phosphorylation by GSK3β and subsequent ubiquitination by the E3
  ubiquitin ligase complex β-TrCP which targets β-catenin for proteasomal degradation.
  Thus, the Wnt response element (WRE) located in the promoter region of Wnt pathway
  target genes remains bound by transcriptional repressor TLE. When a secreted Wnt
  ligand originating from the same or a nearby cell binds Fzd and the coreceptor LRP5/6,
  Dvl is phosphorylated and sequesters the destruction complex, preventing the phosphorylation
  of β-catenin. Accumulation of β-catenin is the cytoplasm leads to nuclear translocation
  of the protein where it binds with co-activator TCF at the WRE and drives expression
  of Wnt target genes.
