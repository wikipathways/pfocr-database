caption: Effects of BMP concentration on fate of ectodermal cells to induce epidermal,
  placodal, neural crest, and neural derivatives. Exposure of pluripotent stem cells
  to different concentrations of BMP4 results in differentiation towards different
  cell fates via activation of various downstream genes. High concentration of BMP4
  results in activation of genes such as K18, which causes cells to differentiate
  towards epidermal fate. Medium concentration of BMP4, which can be due to the presence
  of some inhibitors such as Noggin, causes activation of SIX1 for differentiation
  towards pre-placodal ectoderm and subsequent placodal lineages including lens, olfactory,
  and otic placodes. However, in the presence of WNT, neural crest fate is induced.
  Activation of genes such as Hes1 can have an inhibitory effect on this pathway.
  Low concentration of BMP4, which can be the result of high levels of Noggin due
  to Shh signalling or the presence of Chordin, results in activation of PAX6, NCAD,
  and other genes that result in neural fate. (Generated using Biorender.com, accessed
