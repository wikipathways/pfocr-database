caption: 'A simplified metabolic scheme for the synthesis of fatty acids and TAG in
  oilseeds. Following synthesis in the plastid, 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1 are exported
  to the cytoplasm and edoplasmic reticulum as acyl-CoAs. Saturated 16:0 and 18:0
  are mainly incorporated through GPAT of the Kennedy pathway. Monounsaturated 18:1
  may also enter the Kennedy pathway, but most is incorporated directly into PC by
  LPCAT. PUFA are synthesized from 18:1 on PC by the FAD2 desaturase, with some being
  further desaturated by FAD3 (red arrow). The three pathways that can mobilize PUFA
  from PC for TAG synthesis, shown in blue, are: (1) removal of PUFA from PC to the
  acyl-CoA pool by reverse LPCAT or combined PLA2 and LACS; (2) removal of the PC
  phosphocholine head group to produce PUFA-DAG by PDCT, reverse CPT, PLC, or PLD/PAP;
  (3) direct transfer to DAG by PDAT. Substrate abbreviations are as follows: DAG,
  diacylglycerol; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; LPA, lyso-phosphatidic acid; LPC, lyso-phosphatidylcholine;
  PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; TAG, triacylglycerol.'
