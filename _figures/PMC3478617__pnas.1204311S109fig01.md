caption: Schematic model illustrating the oncogenic pathway addiction. In normal cells,
  multiple signaling pathways may cooperate to control the cell growth. After the
  progressive accumulation of mutations, such as oncogenic Ras mutations, the entire
  Ras/MAPK pathway could become hyperactive, resulting in activation of ELK1 and up-regulated
  MED23. Therefore, cancer cells with Ras mutations become heavily dependent on the
  Ras/MAPK/ELK1/MED23 pathway for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Targeting
  MED23, ELK1, or their interaction may counteract the oncogenic signaling transduction
  in the Ras-driven cancer cells.
