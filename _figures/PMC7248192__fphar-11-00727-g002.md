caption: Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress impairs nitric oxide signaling. Hyperglycemia
  induces oxidative stress via increased activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox) enzymes including Nox2, resulting in superoxide
  (O2−) generation. In mitochondria, hyperglycemia increases reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production including O2−, which stimulates thioredoxin-interacting protein
  (TXNIP) expression. TXNIP promotes activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which activates
  caspase-1, resulting in the maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). O2− also causes strand breaks
  in DNA, leading to activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which reduces
  activity of glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Decreased GAPDH activity
  leads to overactivation of the hexosamine pathway, upregulation of protein kinase
  C (PKC), elevated glucose flux through the polyol pathway and increased formation
  of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). This leads to activation of Nox and NF-κB
  signaling, resulting in increased expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic
  mediators including vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intracellular adhesion
  molecule-1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), plasminogen activator
  inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Upregulation of these pathways results
  in impaired flow-mediated vasodilation, reflecting both endothelial dysfunction
  and nitric oxide (NO•) resistance.

  description: Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress impairs nitric oxide signaling.
    Hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress via increased activity of nicotinamide
    adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Nox) enzymes including Nox2, resulting
    in superoxide (O2−) generation. In mitochondria, hyperglycemia increases reactive
    oxygen species (ROS) production including O2−, which stimulates thioredoxin-interacting
    protein (TXNIP) expression. TXNIP promotes activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
    which activates caspase-1, resulting in the maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory
    cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). O2− also causes
    strand breaks in DNA, leading to activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP),
    which reduces activity of glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Decreased
    GAPDH activity leads to overactivation of the hexosamine pathway, upregulation
    of protein kinase C (PKC), elevated glucose flux through the polyol pathway and
    increased formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). This leads to activation
    of Nox and NF-κB signaling, resulting in increased expression of pro-inflammatory
    and pro-atherogenic mediators including vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1),
    intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1

    of these pathways results in impaired flow-mediated vasodilation, reflecting both
