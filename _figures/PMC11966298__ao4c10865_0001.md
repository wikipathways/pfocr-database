caption: The cGAS-STING pathway. cGAS is activated upon recognizing free cytoplasmic
  DNA from host or foreign sources, using ATP and GTP to synthesize cGAMP. cGAMP binds
  to STING on the ER, triggering its activation and conformational change. Activated
  STING then moves to the Golgi, where it recruits and activates TBK1 and IKK, leading
  to the activation of IRF3 and NF-κB pathways, which induce the expression of interferons
  and cytokines, thereby enhancing the immune response
