caption: Hypothetical mechanisms underlying differential mGluR I modulation of eEPSC
  and sEPSC in MNTB. For evoked glutamatergic transmission,  demonstrated that activation
  of postsynaptic mGluR1 in rat MNTB neurons produces retrograde signaling molecules,
  which lead to the activation of CB1R1s. CB1Rs reduce evoked glutamate release potentially
  via inhibition of presynaptic Ca2+ current. Our current study demonstrated that
  for spontaneous glutamatergic transmission, presynaptic mGluR5, and likely mGluR1
  too, depolarize the membrane of calyx of Held and enhance INaP. We propose that
  this signaling pathway targets the spontaneous glutamate vesicle pool and facilitates
  its release via an increase of the stochastic opening probability of presynaptic
  CaV channels that may be different from those mediating the evoked glutamate release.
