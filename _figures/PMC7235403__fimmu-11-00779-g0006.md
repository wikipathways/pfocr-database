caption: 'Effect of DEX on metabolic pathways in sarcoid AMs. The pathway analysis
  of metabolic DE genes showed that the major pathways affected in DEX-treated sarcoid
  AMs as compared to untreated sarcoid AMS were: Glycolysis, Citric acid cycle (TCA),
  Oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), β-oxidation of fatty acids and Amino acid (AA)
  metabolism. DEX-treatment resulted in the downregulation of genes involved in glycolysis,
  TCA cycle, Oxphos and β-oxidation of fatty acids. Alteration in these pathways suggests
  that glucose metabolism is decreased; glucose is not being utilized completely to
  generate energy producing molecules ATP and NADH. Reduced β-oxidation of fatty acids
  suggests that fatty acids are not being transported and degraded optimally in mitochondria
  to generate energy. Suboptimal fatty acid oxidation may result in the accumulation
  of long chain fatty acids and metabolites. The upregulation of genes involved in
  AA metabolism shows that DEX-treated sarcoid AMs may switch to AA catabolism as
  a source of energy. AAs catabolism results in the conversion of AAs either to pyruvate
  or intermediates of TCA cycle for energy production or generation of precursors
  of glucogenesis and fatty acid synthesis.'
