caption: The network was designed using CellDesigner  with SBGN  (see  for the abbreviations).
  The rectangular nodes represent the enzymes' domains and the oval nodes represent
  the metabolites. The external nodes are surrounded by a blue outline. The symbol  represents
  the catalytic activities on the reactions.
