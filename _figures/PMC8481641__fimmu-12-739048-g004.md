caption: 'Potential clinical therapeutics targeting SIRPs and CD47 for type 1 diabetes
  prevention or suspension. Immunotherapies could be utilized to increase the expression
  of SIRPγ and/or CD47 on primary T cells for adoptive cell therapies or CD47 on stem
  cell-derived β-cells or islets before transplant to attenuate the magnitude of recurrent
  autoimmunity. Red Text Box: Expected Decrease; Green Text Box: Expected Increase.'
