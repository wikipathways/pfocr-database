caption: Propagation and transmission of misfolded SOD1. SOD1 misfolding can be induced
  by a variety of intracellular and extracellular stresses (1). Once a misfolded template
  is present, it can induce subsequent cycles of template-directed misfolding, converting
  neighboring native SOD1 molecules into pathological isoforms, which can subsequently
  form oligomers and aggregates over time (2). Presumably during the early stages
  of disease, misfolded SOD1 can also accumulate in the ER-Golgi system by an unknown
  mechanism (black box), where it can enter the vesicle-mediated secretory pathway,
  becoming selectively incorporated onto the outer surface of exosomes, exit the cell
  via secretion (3) and be taken up by neighboring cells. Alternatively, during later
  stages of disease when neural cells are injured and dying, large proteinaceous aggregates
  containing misfolded SOD1 are released (4) and subsequently taken up by neighboring
  cells via macropinocytosis (5). Uptake through this mechanism appears specific making
  the presence of certain cell surface receptors mediating uptake likely.
