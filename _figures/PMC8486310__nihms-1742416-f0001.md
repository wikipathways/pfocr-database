caption: During HR, DSBs (A) are resected to form 3’ single-strand tails which (B)
  invade at a donor site to form a D-loop. In the most common mitotic HR pathway,
  synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), this D-loop structure is extended by
  DNA polymerase (G), then unwound to reanneal to the 3’ overhang adjacent to the
  original DSB site. Repeats exposed by 3’ end resection can anneal by a Rad51 independent
  manner through single strand annealing (SSA) to form a deletion product (H). In
  the less common canonical double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathway, the second
  3’ end of the DSB is annealed to the displaced strand of the D-loop to form a double
  Holliday junction (C). This double Holliday junction can be cleaved to form crossover
  (D) or noncrossover products (E) or undergo dissolution by the Sgs1-Topo3-Rmi1 complex
  to form a noncrossover (F). The rarely occurring break-induced replication (BIR)
  pathway involves extensive D-loop extension by DNA Polymerase δ, followed by lagging
  strand synthesis which is templated off the newly extended leading strand (I). The
  pathways are organized left to right, from high to low fidelity.
