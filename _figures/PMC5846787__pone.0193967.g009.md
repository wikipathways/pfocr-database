caption: 'Cardiomyocytes, interstitial, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells
  of the human heart express MGP. Step 1: After translation in the endoplasmatic reticulum
  (ER), vitamin K activates MGP by stimulating γ-carboxylation. Step 2: Carboxylated
  desphospho-MGP (dp-cMGP) can sequesters intracellular calcium, thereby providing
  protection against injury caused by calcium deposition. Step 3: A Golgi-associated
  casein kinase phosphorylates the serine residues of dp-cMGP to p-cMGP, thereby facilitating
  secretion. Step 4: p-cMGP is secreted into the extracellular matrix or the circulation
  to inhibit soft tissue calcification, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) trans-differentiation
  into osteochondrogenic progenitor cells (OPC) and signaling via the BMP (bone morphogenetic
  protein) pathway. Step 5: Inactive desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), a biomarker
  reflecting poor vitamin K status, escapes from cells into the blood stream, but
  does not inhibit calcification.'
