caption: Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), a novel signaling mechanism in ASM known
  for its activity in the parathyroid gland. Recent data suggest the involvement of
  CaSR in elevating [Ca2+]i and contractility in human ASM, especially in the context
  of inflammation which increases CaSR expression. Normally, CaSR is sensitive to
  extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o) and is modulated by polyamines (e.g., spermine, eosinophilic
  cationic protein), pH, and amino acids such as l-arginine. Intracellularly, CaSR
  activates the PLC/IP3pathway, but also enhances PKC, RhoA/ROCK, ERK, and other cascades
  that can contribute to increased [Ca2+]i and proliferation. Conversely, CaSR can
  block cAMP and thus impair bronchodilation. The potential importance of CaSR lies
  in the existence and trialing for CaSR agonists (calcimimetics) vs. antagonists
  (calcilytics) for other diseases.
