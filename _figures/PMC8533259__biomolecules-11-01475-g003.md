caption: Regulation of splicing by the DNA damage pathway. (A) DNA damage caused by
  UV irradiation activates the ATR kinase, which promotes the hyperphosphorylation
  of the CTD domain of RNAPII, thus reducing its elongation rate. A slow elongation
  rate favors the premature termination of the pre-mRNA and production of a short
  and non-coding transcript, as in the case of ASCC3 (activating signal cointegrator
  complex subunit 3). The short, non-coding ASCC3 then induces the recovery of transcription
  after resolution of the DNA lesion. (B) Treatment with camptothecin or cisplatin
  disrupt the interaction of EWS with the spliceosome-associated YB-1 protein, resulting
  in the skipping of several exons in the MDM2 transcript. The resulting isoforms
  are unable to interact with P53; thus, P53 is stabilized and induces the expression
  of downstream targets involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
