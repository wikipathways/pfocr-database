caption: Arctigenin acts on signalling mechanisms of stress‐induced depression‐like
  behaviours. Stress activates TLR4 and TNFR1, possibly through HMGB1 and TNF‐α, resulting
  in the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB‐α, which leads to the nuclear translocation
  of NF‐κB and the expression of inflammatory mediators. This results in perturbed
  neurotransmission and neuronal damage, ultimately leading to depression‐like behaviours.
  Arctigenin (AG) inhibits microglial activation and protects against CUMS‐induced
  depression‐like behaviours by inhibiting the HMGB1/TLR4/NF‐κB pathway as well as
  the TNF‐α/TNFR1/NF‐κB signalling pathway. DA, dopamine
