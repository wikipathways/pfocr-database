caption: CD8+ T cell-enhancing nanovaccines for cancer treatment. (A) In adjuvant-loaded
  nanovaccines, cyclic nucleotides and Mn2+ activate the cGAS/STING pathway, leading
  to the production of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF) via IRF3/NF-κB/IRF7
  signaling cascade. PC7A polymer facilitates antigen delivery and immune activation.
  TLR agonist further enhances immune responses through APC activation. (B) Nucleic
  acid-based nanovaccines carry DNA or mRNA cargo. After cellular uptake, these genetic
  materials undergo translation to generate antigens that trigger immune responses.
  (C) Tumor-derived antigen strategy utilizes tumor-specific antigens (TSA) and tumor-associated
  antigens (TAA) from tumor cells, which are incorporated into nanomaterials to stimulate
  CD8+ T cell responses. (D) Synthetic peptide approach employs artificially synthesized
  peptides that are formulated into nanomaterials. (E) Model antigen ovalbumin (OVA)
  demonstrates the interaction between nanovaccine-delivered antigens and CD8+ T cells
  through MHC class I presentation and T cell receptor recognition. These complementary
  strategies aim to enhance antitumor immune responses through CD8+ T cell activation
