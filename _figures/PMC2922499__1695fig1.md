caption: The core ABA signaling pathway. Recent progress in understanding early ABA
  signal transduction has led to the construction of a PYR/RCAR–PP2C–SnRK2 signal
  transduction model. In the absence of ABA, PP2Cs inhibit protein kinase (SnRK2)
  activity through removal of activating phosphates. ABA is bound by intracellular
  PYR/PYL dimers, which dissociate to form ABA receptor–PP2C complexes. Complex formation
  therefore inhibits the activity of the PP2C in an ABA-dependent manner, allowing
  activation of SnRK2s. Several SnRK2 targets have been identified both at the plasma
  membrane and in the nucleus, resulting in control of ion channels, secondary messenger
  production, and gene expression. Red connections on left indicate an inhibitory
  interaction.
