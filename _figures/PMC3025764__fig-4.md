caption: 'Metabolic regulation by FOXO1 in skeletal muscle. Under feeding state FOXO1
  is inactivated, and insulin drives protein synthesis through Akt-TSC1/2-mTOR pathway.
  In fasting states, FOXO1 induces PDK4 that inhibits PDH and blunts glycolysis (pyruvate → tricarboxylic
  acid cycle). On the other hand, FOXO1 induces LPL and CD36: the former promoting
  the hydrolysis of lipoprotein into FFA, and the latter promoting the FFA uptake
  by muscle cells. Moreover, FOXO1 disrupts the RXRα/LXR(complex and the downstream
  SREBP-1c-mediated lipogenesis in muscle cells. Thus, FOXO1 plays a key role in the
  carbohydrate/lipid metabolic switch in skeletal muscle during fasting/feed cycle.
  Under insulin resistance conditions, FOXO1 is hyperactivated and induces autophagy-related
  proteins degradation through Atp1 and MuRF1, which causes atrophy (muscle loss)
  and disturbs metabolic homeostasis. Atg1, atrogin 1 (F-box protein 32); FFA, free
  fatty acid; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; LXRα, liver X receptor α; mTOR, mammalian target
  of rapamycin; MuRF1, muscle-specific RING finger protein 1; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  PDK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4; RXRα, retinoid X receptor α; TSC1/2, tuberous
  sclerosis complex 1 and 2.'
