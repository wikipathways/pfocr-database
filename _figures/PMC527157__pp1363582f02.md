caption: Hypothetical cellular model for Rhizobium Nod factor signal transduction
  in the host plant root hair. In this model, we propose that phospholipid signaling
  provides the essential link between perception of exogenous Nod factors via a putative
  plasma membrane complex including LYK and NORK receptor-like kinases and well-characterized
  intracellular responses such as calcium spiking and specific gene (e.g. MtENOD11)
  transcription. Activation of PLD and PI-PLC by so far unknown mechanisms generates
  secondary messengers such as PA and IP3 from membrane lipids, which in turn either
  activate intracellular targets such as kinases/phosphatases or open store Ca2+ channels
  (see text for detailed description). Note that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores
  may involve more than one type of channel activity (). The precise target of the
  mastoparan agonist is currently unclear, and may involve either a heterotrimeric
  G protein (G) or an alternative membrane-associated protein such as PLD. The rapid
  opening of plasma membrane ion channels in response to Nod factor perception is
  believed to lie on a separate pathway leading to reorientation of root hair tip
  growth. With the exception of ion fluxes, all proposed hypothetical pathways (including
  those that may provide signaling cross-talk) are indicated by broken arrows. PM,
  Plasma membrane; MT, microtubular cytoskeleton.
