caption: Signaling options initiated via wnt5a and the concluded outcome. Wnt5a can
  bind to receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) which leads to the
  activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). ROR2 is also able to act as a coreceptor
  with Frizzled. Wnt5a can bind to Frizzled and ROR2 leading to the activation of
  calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKII) and protein kinase C (PKC). Dishevelled
  (Dsh) is also able to activate Rac which in turn induces JNK. Moreover, Dsh can
  interact with DAAM1 to activate Rho which in turn activates ROCK. The last pathway
  is through activation of adenylate cyclase (AC), which triggers cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) inhibiting the transcription factor
  NFATc1. This figure is a hypothetical estimation based on the literature discussed
  in this paper. Chon, chondrocytes; NPC, nucleus progenitor cell; MSC, mesenchymal
  stromal cell; PG, proteoglycan.
