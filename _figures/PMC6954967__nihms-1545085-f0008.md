caption: Schematic representation of processes and cGMP-PKG-Ca2+signaling cascades
  affected via AS in the heart under ChD and diabetic conditions are shown. The genes
  that were identified to be alternatively spliced and encode for proteins involved
  in Ca2+ flux, Ca2+signaling and contractile activity are shown in bold/italics font.
  Genes of the signaling cascade identified to be affected via alternative splicing
  under diabetic conditions are labeled in red, in ChD hearts in blue, and common
  in both diseases in yellow color. Please see  for gene/protein names, molecular
  functional details, and summarized results. Briefly, in the heart, cGMP is activated
  by nitric oxide and natriuretic peptides and its downstream effects are mediated
  by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). PKG phosphorylates several proteins including
  PLC-beta and plays an essential role in regulation of Ca2+signaling and contraction
  and relaxation of cardiac myocytes. For example, PKG/PLC-β influence the function
  of plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA1), L-type Ca2+ channel (CACNA1C), Inositol
  trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), and SERCA3 that together determine the intracellular
  calcium homeostasis during muscle excitation, contraction and relaxation. Genes
  encoding for calcium sensing Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10 (Arhgef10)
  and myosin phosphatase (MyPT) that regulate actin-myosin interaction were also impacted
  by alternative splicing in ChD and/or DM heart. Phosphodiesterases (PDE2, PDE3)
  catabolize the cGMP/cAMP and inhibit PKG activation.We have found that AS changes
  in the genes of the cGMP-PKG-Ca2+signaling pathway in ChD and DM hearts. Atp2b1,
  and Mef2a were similarly mis-spliced in both ChD and DM hearts and were regulated
  by RBFOX2. Cacna1c, Itpr, Ppp1r12a were differentially spliced in the heart of diabetic
  mice; and Arhgef10 and Atp2a3 were differentially spliced in the heart of ChD mice.
  The AS events can impact the function of the target genes [, ] and T. cruzi infection
  is linked to increased risk of DM in Chagas patients (reviewed in []). We propose
  that DM can potentially exacerbate the AS-induced dysregulation of cGMP-PKG-Ca2+pathway
  and the severity of cardiomyopathy and heart failure in Chagas disease.
