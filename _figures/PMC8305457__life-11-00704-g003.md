caption: Transcriptomic responses of the putative sorghum ABA signaling module. Arabidopsis
  proteins were used with BLAST to search the Phytozome database for sorghum orthologs
  of (i) the commitment enzyme in the ABA biosynthesis pathway, (ii) the ABA receptor
  proteins—pyrabactin resistance (PYR)/PYR1-like (PYL)/regulatory component of ABA
  receptor (RCAR), (iii) the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) proteins, and (iv) the
  sucrose non-fermenting-1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2). The response of
  each gene to drought or ABA was searched in the Genevestigator database [] and the
  log2 ratio of treatment/control is provided in red font. The gene response data
  captured is from two field drought studies [,] and one laboratory-based ABA study
  []. Activation is denoted by a line with arrowhead, while protein inhibition is
  denoted by line ending with a T-junction. NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase;
  ns, no significant response.
