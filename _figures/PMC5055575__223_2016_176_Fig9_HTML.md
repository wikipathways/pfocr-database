caption: Schematic representation of the signalling pathways mediating PTH and BMP-2
  induced regulation of Phospho1, Smpd3 and Alpl in osteoblast cells. Recapitulation
  of the effects of PTH, through the use of the cAMP agonist, forskolin, and inhibition
  of the effects of PTH through the use of the PKA inhibitor, PKI (5–24) have implicated
  the cAMP/PKA pathway in mediating the down-regulation of Phospho1 and Smpd3, and
  the enhancement of Alpl mRNA expression in response to PTH treatment. Initial studies
  have identified BMP-2 as an inducer of Phospho1, Smpd3 and Alpl expression, although
  the intracellular signalling pathway is yet to be elucidated. PTH, parathyroid hormone;
  PTH1R, parathyroid hormone receptor 1; AC, adenylyl cyclase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; BMP2, bone morphogenic
  protein 2; BMPR1A, bone morphogenic protein receptor 1A
