caption: A proposed model for the cytotoxic mechanisms of action of subamolide B.
  Subamolide B activates the cell death pathways mediated by FasL/Fas, mitochondria,
  and ER stress, as evidenced by FasL upregulation, BCL-2 downregulation/cytosolic
  release of cytochrome c, and induction of the UPR signaling pathway/CHOP upregulation,
  respectively. These cell death pathways lead to the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9,
  caspase-4, and caspase-3. Caspase activity and thus apoptosis are partially responsible
  for the cytotoxic activity of subamolide B, as cotreatment with the pan-caspase
  inhibitor z-VAD-fmk impairs but not abolishes subamolide B-induced cell death. FasL/Fas-mediated
  pathway appears dispensable for subamolide B's cytotoxic activity, since blockade
  of this pathway by c-FLIPL or the dominant-negative mutant of FADD (dnFADD) barely
  affects subamolide B-induced cell death. Conversely, BCL-2 overexpression or CHOP
  knockdown markedly enhances the survival of subamolide B-treated cells, confirming
  the requirement of mitochondrial and ER stress cell death pathways for subamolide
  B-induced cytotoxicity. Whether CHOP contributes to subamolide B's cytotoxic action
  through suppression of BCL-2 and/or upregulation of BIM requires further validation.
