caption: Model of the Wnt signaling pathway showing competition between endogenous
  and ectopic β-catenin for interactions with several protein partners, including
  cadherin, APC, and Lef/ Tcf. Overexpression of various β-catenin mutants that possess
  the ability to interact with APC (TM–β-catenin is shown) is predicted to increase
  the stability of endogenous β-catenin. The accumulation of endogenous β-catenin
  via activation of the Wnt pathway or expression of ectopic β-catenin both result
  in the increase of “free” β-catenin capable of interacting with members of the Lef/Tcf
  family of transcription factors. This β-catenin transcription factor complex translocates
  into the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of target genes responsible
  for establishing dorsal cell fate. Furthermore, phosphorylation of β-catenin by
  XGSK-3 may not only regulate β-catenin stability but may also result in competition
  between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated β-catenin isoforms for binding to the
  cytoplasmic domain of cadherin.
