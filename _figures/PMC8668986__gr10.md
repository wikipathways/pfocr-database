caption: 'NDRG1 expression inhibits both androgen-dependent and -independent signaling
  pathways of the AR in prostate cancer cells.A, examining the androgen-dependent
  signaling pathway, testosterone binds to the AR, which leads to a conformational
  change and dissociation from HSP90, AR phosphorylation, and then nuclear translocation.
  Once in the nucleus, AR binds to androgen response elements (AREs) in the promoters
  of target genes and enhances PCa progression. AR transcriptional activity is enhanced
  by association with c-Jun. NDRG1 overexpression inhibits androgen-dependent AR activation
  via two major mechanisms, including: (i) stabilization of the AR-HSP90 complex in
  the cytoplasm, which reduces its activation in response to testosterone and attenuates
  AR nuclear translocation; and (ii) inhibiting the interaction between AR and its
  transcriptional co-activator, c-Jun. B, examining the androgen-independent signaling
  pathway of the AR, phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activates
  the PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT3, and NF-κB downstream pathways. The autocrine feedback mechanism
  of IL-6 will further activate the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. This effect leads
  to the activating phosphorylation of AR (i.e., p-ARSer213 and p-ARSer81) and its
  subsequent nuclear translocation in an androgen-independent manner. Once in the
  nucleus, AR promotes transcription of oncogenic genes (i.e., cyclin D1). NDRG1 inhibits
  EGF-mediated activation of PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT3, and NF-κB signaling pathways, as
  well as their ability to activate the AR. NDRG1 expression also inhibits the autocrine
  feedback mechanism of IL-6, while markedly upregulating the tumor suppressor, p27,
  and inhibiting prooncogenic cyclin D1 expression. Finally, NDRG1 inhibits EGF-mediated
  phosphorylation of c-Jun (which is mediated by downstream PI3K/JNK signaling; ())
  to prevent AR transcriptional activity.'
