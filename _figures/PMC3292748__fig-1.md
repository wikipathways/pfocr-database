caption: Pathological implications of autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD)
  genes in mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The pathogenic mutations
  of α-synuclein (α-syn), impairments in the antioxidant and protein degradation machineries,
  as well as mitochondrial dysfunction that may occur with aging, all favor the aberrant
  aggregation of α-syn, a pathway clearly linked to neurodegeneration. Evidence from
  cell and animal models also suggests that α-syn aggregation can elicit mitochondrial
  damage, therefore providing a feed-forward loop that ultimately leads to cellular
  damage. Monomeric α-syn may also influence mitochondrial activity and dynamics.
  Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) pathogenic mutations also cause neurodegeneration.
  LRRK2 is associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane but the function of LRRK2
  in relation to mitochondria is presently unclear.
