caption: Cartoon illustrating signaling pathways activated by temozolomide (TMZ) in
  glioma cells. TMZ plays a dual role by both (1) inhibiting cell proliferation (pink
  solid line) and (2) inducing acquired TMZ resistance via the upregulation of MGMT.
  The latter effect requires [Ca2+]i-dependent glycogenolysis via the Na,K-ATPase/ERK1/2signaling
  pathway (green solid lines). Activation of the second pathway leads to an increase
  in [Ca2+]i by TRPC1 in the cell membrane and IP3R in the ER, which act upon the
  intracellular Ca2+-sensitive site of calmodulin (CaM) protein, possibly activating
  glycogen phosphorylase activation and the subsequent stimulation of glycogenolysis,
  necessary for pathway function. The ouabain signaling pathway is shown at the top
  of the figure. Na,K-ATPase was activated possibly by glycogenolysis and trans-activated
  by the MAPK pathway, which was confirmed by our own previous studies and our current
  inhibitor studies. Inhibitory effects on the upregulation of MGMT expression, after
  addition of TMZ, are shown in brown ovals. No effect of other inhibitors on [Ca2+]i
  release and upregulation of Na,K-ATPase, ERK1/2, and MGMT are shown in green ovals.
