caption: BHBA mediates GH and PRL gene transcription, translation, and secretion in
  DCAPCs via the cAMP/PKA/CREB and AMPK signaling pathways. BHBA binds to GPCR and
  leads to the dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein complex into Gαi and Gβγ
  subunits. The exchange of GTP from GDP results in the activation of Gαi, thereby
  inhibiting adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity. This process results in a decrease in
  intracellular cAMP levels and a subsequent reduction in PKA activity. The inhibition
  of PKA activity inhibits CREB phosphorylation, thereby decreasing GH and PRL gene
  transcription, translation, and secretion directly or indirectly. The A-protomer
  of PTX penetrates into the host cells and results in the inactivation of Gαi, which
  subsequently inhibits the BHBA-mediated signaling pathway. In addition, intracellular
  BHBA uptake mediated by MCT1 may trigger AMPK signaling and result in the phosphorylation
  of TSC1-TSC2, leading to a decrease in GH and PRL mRNA translation via mTOR signaling.
