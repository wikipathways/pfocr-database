caption: Graphic abstract. In this figure, it shows that apoptosis occurred when the
  HUVECs were subjected to sodium palmitate, κ-OR stimulation with U50,488H significantly
  attenuated this apoptosis via PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway. κ-OR, κ-opioid receptor;
  U50,488H, a selectiveκ-OR agonist; nor-BNI, a selective κ-OR antagonist; LY-294002,
  an inhibitor of PI3K; MK-2206-2HCl, an inhibitor of Akt; L-NAME, an inhibitor of
  eNOS; NO, nitric oxide; Caspase 3 and BAX are apoptosis proteins, Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptosis
  protein
