caption: Dimerization between D2R and GHSR1a. Proposed signaling through D2R involves
  coupling to a Gipathway, which typically does not involve intracellular Ca2+ accumulation
  from the endoplasmic reticulum. Dimerization with GHSR1a, in the absence of a ghrelin
  ligand leads to a PLC-dependent accumulation of Ca2+. D2R’s Gβγ subunit acts to
  stimulate PLC activity, and αi coupling by D2R is also required for Ca2+ accumulation.
  In contrast, Gαq activity associated with GHSR1a is not required for D2R-induced
  Ca2+ accumulation. It is believed that the D2R-GHSR1a dimer is responsible for the
  anorectic effects of D2R agonists such as cabergoline.
