caption: Schematic representation of the mechanisms of bradykinin B2 receptor-mediated
  responses to agonists in HEK 293 cells. The dotted arrow represents a pathway that
  has been proposed in other systems but is not supported in the present one. Thick
  arrows represent pathways that are favoured by agonists resistant to inactivation
  in long-term experiments.
