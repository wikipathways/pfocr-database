caption: The differentially regulated genes in qRT-PCR analysis in right ventricle
  of db/db hearts compared to their wild type controls were taken as input data and
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to build interactive network(s)
  based on the relations available from its library. Genes shown in green color were
  down-regulated and up-regulated genes were shown in red color, where intensity of
  color is proportional to the fold values. Dotted arrows represent indirect relations
  and solid lines represent direct relations between the genes. Genes that are present
  in the network but not present in the input data are shown without any color.
