caption: 'Schematic signalling pathway of Hp(2-20)-activated FPRL1. FPRL1 participates
  in the pathogenesis of H. pylori infection by interacting with Hp(2-20). During
  Hp(2-20) binding, the G protein α subunit exchanges guanosine diphosphate (GDP)
  with guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and dissociates from β-γ subunits. This activates
  various signal transduction events, resulting in oxidative stress, cell migration,
  inflammation, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis. These events, which are chronically
  induced, may lead to severe gastric diseases, including cancer. Abbreviations: Akt:
  protein kinase B; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GTP: guanosine triphosphate;
  MEKK: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; NF-kB: nuclear factor kB; PI3Kγ:
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma; PLCβ: phospholipase Cβ; PKC: protein Kinase C;
  ROS: reactive oxygen species; STAT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor.'
