caption: Schematic representation of Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and major signal
  transduction pathways. The trk receptors have an extracellular ligand binding domain,
  a singular transmembrane region and an intracellular region of variable length.
  The round green filled circles represent the cysteine rich regions, which are separated
  by fibronectin type III repeats (jagged line). The open green circles represent
  the Ig-like domains that bind the dimeric BDNF monomers leading to dimerization
  of the TrkB receptors and activation of the intracellular TrkB-tyrosine kinase (TK)
  domain (rectangle filled with circles). Activation of the TrkB-TK leads to phosphorylation
  (P) of a number of tyrosines (Y) in the TK domain as well as the juxtamembrane domain.
  These PY residues serve as docking sites for cytoplamic proteins such as Shc, PLCγ
  whose recruitment in turn leads to activation of downstream mediators of the MAPK,
  PLCγ and PI-3 kinase pathways. Ultimately these signals are transduced to the nucleus
  to mediate transcriptional programs that regulate cellular functions such as synaptic
  plasticity, differentiation, growth and survival and motility. Other members of
  the Trk family, TrkA and TrkC are depicted to illustrate the structural conservation
  of this gene family. P75 is a pan neurotrophin (NT) receptor which is structurally
  in the “Death Receptor” family of membrane bound receptors.
