caption: The tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling pathway as a master
  regulator of inflammation and cell death. TNFR1 encountering TNF nucleates complex
  I, which includes TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), receptor-interacting
  protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), TNFR1-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), cellular inhibitor
  of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2), and the linear ubiquitin chain assembly
  complex (LUBAC) composed of heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase 1 (HOIL-1), HOIL1-interacting
  protein (HOIP), and SHANK-associated RH domain-interacting protein (SHARPIN). Polyubiquitinated
  RIPK1 recruits the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (composed of the NF-κB essential modulator
  [NEMO], IKKα, and IKKβ) and the TAK1 complex, which mediate NF-κB and MAPK signaling.
  Degradation of phosphorylated IκB mediates translocation of p50 and RelA to the
  nucleus and transcription of proinflammatory and prosurvival NF-κB target genes.
  The stability of complex I is regulated by deubiquitinating enzymes such as A20,
  cylindromatosis (CYLD), and OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity (OTULIN).
  Formation of complex II containing Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD),
  caspase-8, TRADD, and RIPK1 can trigger apoptosis. If the activity of caspase-8
  is compromised, RIPK3 interacts with RIPK1 via its RHIM domain. Autophosphorylated
  RIPK3 leads to recruitment, phosphorylation, and oligomerization of the pseudokinase
  mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Translocation of activated MLKL to the
  plasma membrane results in necroptosis. Proteins highlighted by red frames indicate
  that mutations in the corresponding genes have been reported as monogenic causes
  for primary immunodeficiencies.
