caption: Schematic of Thy-1-associated signaling pathways. (A) Thy-1 interacts with
  both β2 and β3 integrins. The association of neuronal Thy-1 with β3 on astrocytes
  induces activation of FAK, vinculin, paxillin, p130Cas, and RhoA, promoting focal
  adhesion and stress fiber formation. This interaction may induce bidirectional signaling
  by concurrently signaling an inhibition of neurite outgrowth in mature neurons.
  Endothelial cell Thy-1 also interacts with β2 on leukocytes and β3 on melanoma cells
  to promote transendothelial cell migration in vitro. (B) Thy-1 associates with protein
  tyrosine kinases such as SFK within lipid rafts. This interaction may induce apoptosis
  of glomerular mesangial cells, promote neurite outgrowth in neurons, inhibit migration
  of pulmonary fibroblasts by altering the cytoskeleton, and promote T cell activation.
  (C) Thy-1 activation induces apoptosis in thymocytes, glomerular mesangial cells,
  and mouse malignant T cells. In malignant T cells, Thy-1 activation activates caspases
  and downregulates anti-apoptotic bcl-2 and bcl-XL. In an anti-Thy-1-induced model
  of glomerulonephritis, the apoptosis-related genes NGFI-B and Gadd 45 γ are upregulated.
  In this same model, the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins is also modulated
  (see text for details). (D) Thy-1 promotes proliferation of mesangial cells via
  activation of Smad1 and STAT3, and proliferation of T cells through a pathway involving
  calcineurin, protein tyrosine kinases, PI-3 kinase, protein kinase C, and MAPK.
  Thy-1 also promotes TGF-β activation, cytokine/growth factor signaling, eicosanoid
  production, and myofibroblasts/lipofibroblast differentiation. (E) Thy-1 functions
  as tumor suppressor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and ovarian cancer cells, potentially
  due to its upregulation of thrombospondin-1 and fibronectin. * indicates that Thy-1
  cross-linking is necessary for effect.
