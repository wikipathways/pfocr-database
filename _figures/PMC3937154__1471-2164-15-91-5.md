caption: IPA graphic representation of the network “Cell death and survival, DNA replication,
  recombination, and repair, cellular response to therapeutics”. Nodes represent genes
  and lines show the relationship between genes. The intensity of the node colour
  indicates the degree of the over-expression (red) or under-expression (green) and
  the fold change is indicated. The cellular sub-localisation for each node, when
  known, is also given.

  a role for the p53 signalling pathway and identifies growth and differentiation
  factor-15 as a potential novel biomarker for mitochondrial myopathies.
