caption: Schematic diagram representing the signaling pathway for βAR-mediated cardiac
  insulin resistance. Agonist binding to β2ARs leads to the G protein-mediated activation
  of AC and cAMP generation. cAMP directly binds to and activates PKA. In β2AR signaling,
  PKA phosphorylates GRK2, which subsequently increases GRK2 activity. This leads
  to the inhibition of insulin-induced GLUT4 expression and the translocation of GLUT4
  to the plasma membrane, thereby interfering with glucose uptake into cells and insulin-induced
  IRS1 phosphorylation. In β1AR signaling, PKA and PI3K activate Akt by phosphorylation
  at Ser 473, which in turn, phosphorylates the β subunit of insulin receptor (IRβ)
  at Thr residues. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRβ inhibits insulin-induced tyrosine
  autophosphorylation of IRβ, leading to impairment of insulin signaling. These conditions
  lead to insulin resistance in the heart. Treatment with β-blockers antagonizes ISO-mediated
  insulin resistance in the heart.
