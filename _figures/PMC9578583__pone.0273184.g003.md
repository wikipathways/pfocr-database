caption: 'Significant fold change in proteins (P<0.05) is marked with a double asterisk
  (**). Fold change is represented by bubble size and an increase in the abundance
  of an enzyme in the low CH4 group shown by a green bubble, whereas increase in the
  abundance of an enzyme in the high CH4 group shown by red bubble. Abbreviations
  of protein names: HK; hexokinase, GPI; glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, PFK; phosphofructokinase-1,
  ALDOA; fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, GAPDH; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
  PGK1; phosphoglycerate kinase, PGM; phosphoglycerate mutase, ENO1; enolase 1, PK;
  pyruvate kinase, LDHA; L-lactate dehydrogenase LDHD; D-lactate dehydrogenase, TPI1;
  triosephosphate isomerase, PCK2; pyruvate carboxykinase -2, P; phosphate. For enzymes
