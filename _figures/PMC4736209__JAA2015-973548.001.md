caption: 'Main pathways of TRP degradation including enzymes and their potential stimuli
  (modified after [, , , ]). Superscripted numbers indicate described biological effects
  of TRP metabolites. Black arrows mark enzymatic reactions and dashed arrows include
  more than one catalytic reaction step. Enzymes: FOR = formamidase, IDO = indolamine
  2,3-dioxygenase; TDO = tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, TPH = tryptophan hydroxylase;
  KAT = kynurenine aminotransferase, KMO = kynurenine 3-monooxygenase; KYNU = kynureninase,
  HADO = 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase; HAAO = 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxidase,
  AMO = anthranilate 3-monooxygenase, and AADC = aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase;
  AANAT = N-acetyltransferase; HIOMT = hydroxy-O-methyltransferase.'
