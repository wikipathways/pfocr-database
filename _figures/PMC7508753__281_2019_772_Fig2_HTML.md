caption: Contribution of the embryo, fetus, and trophoblasts to the programming of
  immune adaptations during pregnancy. a The blastocyst implants into the endometrium
  where it induces decidualization and begins interacting with local immune cells,
  such as DCs and NKs. b Trophoblasts invade the decidua and secrete cytokines, chemokines
  (chemokine (C-X-C motif), ligands (CXCL), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that
  recruit maternal immune cells and allow for remodeling of decidua/uterus. Specialized
  HLA molecules on trophoblasts inhibit CD8+ T cell and NK cell cytotoxicity. A tolerogenic
  milieu is fostered with Th2-polarized cells, immature dendritic cells, and Treg
  cells. c The fetus and placenta modulate the peripheral immune system to enhance
  fetal tolerance. Fetal microchimerism, cell-free fetal (cff)DNA, and placental extracellular
  vesicles enter maternal circulation and either promote systemic tolerance (exosomes)
  via mechanisms such as induction of fetal-specific regulatory T cells (Treg) or
  contribute to pathologic inflammation in diseases of pregnancy (microparticles).
  d Signals of fetal maturity, such as surfactant protein A production by fetal lungs
  and stretch of the amniotic membranes, trigger inflammation, leading to the common
  pathway of parturition
