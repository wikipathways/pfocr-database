caption: Dopamine signaling pathway. Tyrosine is converted to L-DOPA by the rate limiting
  step enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Then dopamine is synthesized by action of
  the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Dopamine is packed in the cytosol
  via vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (Vmat2). Dopamine is then released from vesicles
  into the synaptic cleft in response to an action potential. Dopamine can either
  bind to D1 receptor and activate adenylate cyclase and consequently activate downstream
  signaling through cAMP, or bind D2 receptor and inhibit adenylate cyclase and downstream
  signaling. Reuptake of dopamine from the synaptic cleft to the cytosol occurs through
  the dopamine transporter (DAT). Then dopamine can either be degraded to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
  acid (DOPAC) via monoamine oxidase (MAO) or repacked in vesicles via Vmat2. Dopamine
  can also be degraded in the synaptic cleft via catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)
  to 3 methyltyramine (3MT). Extracellular dopamine can bind to the D2 autoreceptor,
  which inhibits the synthesis of dopamine. Created with BioRender.com.
