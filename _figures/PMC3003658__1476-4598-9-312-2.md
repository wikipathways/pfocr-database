caption: Role of Rab25 in cancer. Activated Rab 25 and other growth factor receptors
  are located near the cell surface. Rab25 regulates receptor internalization, vesicle
  formation, and trafficking with specific cellular components. Rab25 also activates
  AKT, which increases cell proliferation and survival. Rab25 integration leads to
  down-regulation of BAX and BAK to activate the Bcl2 pathway, which affects apoptosis
  and cell survival.
