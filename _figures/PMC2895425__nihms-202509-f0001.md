caption: a | Schematic depicting signal attenuation. Ligand-induced activation of
  receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) promotes
  signalling from the plasma membrane by the receptor-mediated recruitment of signalling
  effectors to phosphorylated RTKs, or the activation of G proteins associated with
  GPCRs when the Gα subunit is bound to GTP (step 1). GPCR signalling can be mediated
  both by the GTP-bound Gα subunit (as depicted) and by the Gβ–Gγ subcomplex. Receptor
  recruitment into coated pits (step 2) and clathrin-dependent endocytosis (step 3)
  attenuate signalling by separating the receptors from plasma membrane-delimited
  substrates and/or mediators. Some receptors traffic to lysosomes after endocytosis,
  which results in their downregulation by proteolysis and further attenuates signalling
  (step 4). b | Schematic depicting signal desensitization, re-sensitization and pathway
  switching. The ability of some GPCRs to activate trimeric G proteins (signal 1;
  step 1) is attenuated before endocytosis by receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin
  binding (step 2). Such desensitized receptor–β-arrestin complexes concentrate into
  clathrin-coated pits (step 3) and are endocytosed into acidic (H+) endosomes (step
  4), which promotes various events that may include (depending on the receptor and
  cell type) ligand dissociation or destruction, dissociation of β-arrestin and phosphatase-catalysed
  dephosphorylation (step 5). Recycling (step 6) restores the receptors to the cell
  surface, re-sensitizing the cell for another round of signalling. In some cases
  GPCR recycling inserts receptors into a different G protein-containing environment
  (step 7), which produces a `switch' in signalling specificity following subsequent
  receptor activation (signal 2; step 8).
