caption: The Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway is altered at multiple
  levels by DNA methylation in COPD airways. Increased cellular levels of reactive
  oxidative species (ROS), which are produced from multiple sources, inhibit Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/Cullin 3 (CUL3)/ring-box 1, E3 ubiquitin protein
  ligase (RBX1)-mediated NRF2 ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation, allowing
  NRF2 nuclear translocation. Antioxidant response element (ARE) genes, which are
  transcriptionally activated by NRF2, mediate a multitude of processes involved in
  cellular protection from ROS damage. Compared with small airways from individuals
  with normal lung function, genes in the Nrf2 pathway are differentially altered
  at the level of DNA methylation and gene expression at multiple up- and downstream
  points in COPD small airways. Genes hypermethylated in COPD airways are colored
  light blue; genes hypermethylated and concomitantly underexpressed in COPD airways
  are colored green. An impaired Nrf2 response can result in increased damage from
  ROS.
