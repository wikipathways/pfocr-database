caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed genes between
  24 DSS and 56 uncomplicated dengue patients. Twenty-one differentially expressed
  transcripts were analyzed using IPA. The following two significant networks were
  identified: cancer, cell cycle, and cell-mediated immune response (network 1, score
  of 31) (A) and antigen presentation, cell-mediated immune response, and humoral
  immune response (network 2, score of 21) (B). The lines between genes represent
  known interactions, with solid lines representing direct interactions and dashed
  lines representing indirect interactions. Differentially expressed genes are highlighted
  in red, and genes identified by IPA are not highlighted. The high scores associated
  with these networks indicate they were highly unlikely to be formed by chance.'
