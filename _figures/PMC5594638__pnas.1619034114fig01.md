caption: The coupling between SerA and D2HGDH makes the robust interconversion between
  d-2-HG and 2-KG (green dotted box) to overcome the thermodynamic barrier of d-3-PG
  dehydrogenation and facilitate the biosynthetic process of l-serine (purple pathway).
  The coupling establishes a linkage among the intermediates of glycolysis (d-3-PG),
  TCA cycle (2-KG), and l-serine biosynthesis. The black dotted box indicates the
  already known straightforward connections between the intermediates of glycolysis
  (PEP and pyruvate) and TCA cycle (OAA). OAA, oxaloacetate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  3-PHP, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate.
