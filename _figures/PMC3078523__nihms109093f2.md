caption: 'Cells may undergo apoptosis by two major pathways, an extrinsic receptor-dependent
  pathway and an intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway, in response to various
  acute injurious stimuli. In the intrinsic pathway, environmental stress may cause
  direct mitochondrial damage, or promote signaling pathways dependent on ROS generation,
  resulting in the activation of Bax. Bax translocates to the mitochondrial outer
  membrane, where it oligomerizes or forms complexes with other proapoptotic Bcl-2
  related proteins such as Bid or Bad. Bax oligomers form pores in the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, which facilitate the release of pro-apoptotic molecules such as cytochrome-c.
  Cytochrome c forms a complex with Apaf-1 and caspase-9, leading to caspase-9 activation.
  In extrinsic apoptosis, a death inducing ligand such as Fas ligand (FasL), initiates
  the death program upon interacting with its corresponding receptor (ie., Fas).These
  interactions lead to the recruitment and activation of caspase-8 in a death-inducing
  signal complex (DISC). Caspase-8 activation can lead to caspase-3 activation, or
  to the activation of Bid. Bid assists in the activation and mitochondrial translocation
  of Bax. Bid activation also results in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria.
  This diagram indicates those points in the apoptotic pathway at which HO-1 and its
  enzymatic products have been shown to inhibit cell death. Each number corresponds
  with an individual reference, and the shape of each symbol indicates which effector
  molecule has been implicated: HO-1, CO, BV/BR or ferritin/iron.'
