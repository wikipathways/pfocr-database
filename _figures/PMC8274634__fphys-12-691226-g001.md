caption: Schematic depicting possible divergent signaling cascades downstream of MC4R
  and AT1a in distinct hypothalamic nuclei that might differentially affect metabolic
  and cardiovascular regulations. Upon binding to its designated ligands, MC4R activates
  canonical Gαs-AC-cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway, leading to the transcription of genes in
  different hypothalamic nuclei. Additionally, the activation of non-cannonical signaling
  pathways involving Gαq and Gαi has also been reported for MC4R, which lead to the
  activation of ERK-Elk1 transcriptional axis to drive the expression of different
  sets of responsive genes in different hypothalamic nuclei. Differential recruitment
  of these divergent signaling pathways may defines ultimate physiological changes.
  For AT1a, although reported canonical pathway is Gαq-mediated activation of ERK,
  a possible non-canonical coupling to Gαi has also been supported experimentally,
  which, depending on the action of site, may lead to differential metabolic and cardiovascular
  outcomes. In addition to well-known receptor internalization for subsequent recycling
  or degradation, β-Arrestin-mediated activation of ERK transduction has also been
  reported for both MC4R and AT1a. These multilevel selectivities of GPCR signaling
  pathways ranging from intracellular molecular events to the brain regions of action
  and the effective organs could all lead to different metabolic alterations and cardiovascular
  changes.
