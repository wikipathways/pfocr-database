caption: Modulation of the pain pathway. Lines marked with a (−) sign indicate inhibitory
  effects, while lines with a ( +) sign represent stimulatory effects. NMDA, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate
  receptor antagonists; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This figure
  highlights the critical importance of targeting multiple points along the pain signaling
  pathway to effectively manage pain
