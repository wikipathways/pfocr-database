caption: A simple model was constructed on the basis of transcriptome data. Under
  Cd stress, different responses occurred in the root and shoot. In the root, antioxidant
  system, phosphorylation cascade, plant hormone signaling and detoxify and protection
  system were activated. In the antioxidant system, key enzymes such as SOD, APX and
  MDAR were regulated under Cd stress. They were activated to clear hydroxyl radicals
  (.OH), O2-, .O2H and H2O2. In the phosphorylation cascade, several receptor kinases,
  calmodulin, MAPK pathway components and some transcription factors, such as Wrky,
  AP2 and ERF were involved in Cd stress. Several phytohormones such as IAA, SA, BR,
  Ethylene, GA, JA and ABA signaling pathway were activated or inhibited under Cd
  stress. In detoxifying and protection system, to transfer Cd complex into vacuole,
  enzymes involved in GSH production and PC synthesis were heavily expressed. Besides,
  transporters including MATE, CITRATE, Sulfur transporter, IPT and aquaporin were
  up-regulated or down-regulated under Cd stress. In the shoot, the most significant
  change was that the ribosome protein expression was down-regulated, which lead protein
  synthesis to slow down to cope with Cd stress. Besides, carotenoid biosynthesis
  was also affected under Cd stress, which would directly affect ABA synthesis and
  photoproctection.
