caption: Peptide elongation pathway is downregulated in LUSC when compared to LUAD.
  The peptide elongation pathway is the most down-regulated pathway according to Reactome
  analysis with p-value 9.72E−6 and FDR 0.00157. The boxes partially highlighted in
  brown indicate the number of genes identified in the analysis that are associated
  with each box.
