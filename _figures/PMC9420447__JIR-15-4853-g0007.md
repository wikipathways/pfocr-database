caption: KEGG pathway annotation of the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway after
  LPS and α-MMC treatment. (A) TLR signalling pathway in M1 macrophages by proteomic
  analysis. In the figure, a red box indicates that a differentially expressed protein
  was upregulated, a green box indicates that a differentially expressed protein was
  downregulated, and a grey box indicates that a protein showed no difference in expression.
  (B) TLR signalling pathway in M1 macrophages 4 h after α-MMC administration by phosphoproteomics
  analysis. A green box in the figure indicates that the differentially modified protein
  had decreased modification, and a grey box indicates that a protein was not differentially
  modified.
