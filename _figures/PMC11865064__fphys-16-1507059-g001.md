caption: Mitochondrial metabolism. Glycerol-3 phosphate (G3P) production utilizes
  NADH in the cytosol and its oxidation generates FADH2 in the mitochondria, with
  the G3P shuttle acting as mechanism to regenerate cytosolic NAD+. The shuttle involves
  cytoplasmic G3P dehydrogenase (cGPD), and mitochondrial G3P dehydrogenase (mGPD)
  located on the outer face of the IMM. This FADH2 contributes to ATP generation via
  OXPHOS. The mitochondrial complexes are in the IMM, and transfer electrons in the
  electron transport chain (ETC) consisting of complexes (CI -CIV). Electron transfer
  produces an electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial membranes which are
  used to produce ATP by ATP synthase in OXPHOS. Glucose from the cytosol can be diverted
  to the pentose -phosphate pathway (PPP) or converted to pyruvate in glycolysis and
  transported to the mitochondrial matrix where it is converted to Acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA
  enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), producing electron equivalents and ATP.
  Electron equivalents in the form of NADH or FADH2 are used in OXPHOS to produce
  ATP. Fatty acids are converted to acyl-CoA in the cytosol by acyl-CoA synthetase
  (ACS), then transported to mitochondria by the carnitine transporter and enter fatty
  acid oxidation (FAO) in the mitochondrial matrix, which produces Acetyl-CoA and
  electron equivalents. VDAC has been shown to have an important role in the viral
  replication cycle in arthropods. In mosquito cells infected with Japanese encephalitis
  virus (JEV), VDAC interacts with GRP78, suggesting that mitochondria relocate near
  the ER to supply ATP. Additionally, VDAC can promote or inhibit viral replication
  by regulating apoptosis in cells infected with different viruses. The boxes indicate
  the arboviruses that disrupt specific metabolic pathway. Created in Biorender.com.
