caption: Revisited model for ACC/ethylene biosynthesis and signaling. (A) ACC/ethylene
  signaling pathway in normal conditions, where the responses are mainly mediated
  by ethylene. A major portion of ACC is converted to ethylene by ACO. The signal
  is then transferred via key signaling components ultimately leading to ethylene
  responses. The remaining ACC is transported to other tissues, conjugated to storage
  forms or perceived by (a) putative ACC receptor(s). Subsequent ACC responses are
  assumed to be minimal. (B) ACC/ethylene signaling pathway in conditions where ACC
  accumulates and leads to ACC-specific responses. ACC accumulation can result from
  an inhibition of ACO by inhibitors (e.g., AIB; shown in red), saturation of ACO
  activity (leading to overflow), or any other inhibition of ACO caused by internal
  or external signals. Elevated levels of ACC bind to its receptor(s), activating
  unidentified downstream components, ultimately leading to ACC-specific responses.
  Alternatively, ACC could, upon interaction with its receptor(s) act via EIN2, activating
  ethylene-mediated gene expression, while bypassing the need for ethylene perception.
  Additionally, the ACO inhibitor AIB potentially affects other ACC binding proteins
  such as putative receptors, transporters or conjugating enzymes. Arrow-headed lines
  represent stimulatory interactions. Bar-headed lines represent inhibitory interactions.
  Thick lines depict the predominantly active pathway. Dashed lines indicated relations
  that have not been demonstrated experimentally. 1-MCP, 1-methylcyclopropene; ACC,
  1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid; ACO, ACC oxidase; ACS, ACC synthase; AIB,
  2-aminoisobutyric acid; CTR, constitutive triple response; ETR, ethylene response;
  ERS, ethylene response sensor; EIN, ethylene insensitive; EIL, EIN3-like.
