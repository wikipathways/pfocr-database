caption: Transduction of the AI-2 signal and autoinducer gene regulation in Enterobacteriaceae
  (left, in red) and Vibrionaceae (right, in blue). In the Enterobacteriaceae, the
  AI-2 signal R-THMF is imported by the means of the Lsr ABC transporter in the cytoplasm
  of the cell, where is phosphorylated by LsrK. AI-2-P binds the repressor LsrR which
  is then released from the lsr promoter to allow the expression of the autoinducer
  operon. The histidine/aspartate (H/D) hybrid kinase LuxQ autophosporylates in the
  absence of autoinducers in Vibrionaceae. The phosporylation signal is transmitted
  to the histidine phosphorelay LuxU that conveys it to the σ54-dependent response
  regulator LuxO, which activates the expression of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs).
  The complexes of these sRNAs and chaperone protein Hfq destabilizes the mRNA of
  master regulator LuxR, thereby repressing the transcription of the lux operon. In
  the presence of S-THMF-borate, the AI- 2 receptor LuxP converts LuxQ from kinase
  to phosphatase, reversing the flow of phosphate through the pathway and hence allowing
  the expression of the lux operon.
