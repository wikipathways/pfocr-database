caption: Schematic overview of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics changes
  in the prostaglandin biosynthetic pathway at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after
  macrophage stimulation with KLA. Transcriptomics (T), proteomics (P), and metabolomics
  (circles) data are represented as individual heat maps for each transcript, protein,
  and metabolite, in which colors represent either increased (yellow) or decreased
  (blue) abundance, with the intensity reflecting the corresponding log2(fold change).
  All of the time points were compared with an untreated control sample (without KLA).
  Only transcriptomic data were obtained for microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1
  PTGES.
