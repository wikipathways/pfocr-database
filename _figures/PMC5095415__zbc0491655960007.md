caption: A potentially novel olfactory signal pathway existing in AWC olfactory neurons.
  The pathway of sensing 2-heptanone was affected by genes located on the PLC and
  cGMP pathways. Between them, the genes in the PLC pathway, such as phospholipase
  C of plc-1and egl-8, calcium channel of cmk-1and cal-1, were expected to be responsible
  for transducing the specific olfactory signals of 2-heptatone. However, the genes
  of cGMP pathway seemed to play more important roles in maintaining str-2 expression
  to influence the olfactory signal transduction.
