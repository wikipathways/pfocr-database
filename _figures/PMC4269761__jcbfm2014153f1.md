caption: 'Major pathways for glucose and lactate metabolism. Glucose enters the glycolytic
  pathway via the hexokinase step and glucose-6-P can be diverted to the pentose-P
  shunt pathway from which carbon re-enters glycolysis as fructose-6-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P.
  Because these two molecules are upstream of the redox and ATP-producing steps, impairment
  of glycolysis by NAD+ depletion or phosphofructokinase inhibition may also restrict
  pentose shunt flux. NADH cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane and requires the
  malate–aspartate shuttle system or lactate dehydrogenase to regenerate NAD+. Flooding
  of brain cells with lactate owing to the intense physical work or lactate infusion
  can cause intracellular acidification at two steps (transport and oxidation to pyruvate).
  Phosphofructokinase is the major regulatory enzyme of glycolysis and it has a steep
  pH activity profile, being inhibited by more acidic conditions. Color schemes denote
  major aspects of glucose metabolism: blue, energy related; purple, redox related;
  green, biosynthesis related. Astrocytes are highly enriched with glycogen and its
  enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase, and glutamine synthase. Pyruvate carboxylase is the
  CO2-fixing enzyme that confers astrocytes with the ability to synthesize glutamate
  de novo from glucose by making a new molecule of OAA from pyruvate, which condenses
  with AcCoA from a second molecule of pyruvate to make a ‘new'' citrate and αKG molecule
  that can be converted to a new glutamate molecule that can be converted to glutamine
  by glutamine synthase. AcCoA, acetyl CoA; αKG, a-ketoglutarate; cit, citrate; ECF,
