caption: Pathway‐related heatmaps based on log2‐fold changes of differentially expressed
  genes (FDR < 0.01). Genes are grouped with respect to their metabolic function.
  The first five columns next to the gene ID in each heatmap indicate transcriptional
  changes after 15 min and 1, 3, 9 and 25 h with respect to the non‐perturbed reference
  in the STR. The last three columns depict transcript changes measured at PFR ports
  P1, P3 and P5 with respect to the STR analog after 25 h. The heatmap coding is presented
  in the legend. G6P = glucose 6‐phosphate; EMP = Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway from
  glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate to pyruvate; ED = Entner–Doudoroff pathway; PHA = polyhydroxyalkanoate.
