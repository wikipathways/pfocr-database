caption: The mGluR1-TRPC3 signalling pathway in cerebellar Purkinje cells and spinocerebellar
  ataxia. Schematic diagram showing the downstream signalling cascade following metabotropic
  glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1) activation by glutamate (Glu) at Purkinje cell
  synapses. Glu released from granule cell parallel fibres binds mGluR1, which is
  coupled to Gαq, expressed on the Purkinje cell postsynaptic membrane. This activates
  phospholipase C beta (PLCβ) to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG). IP3 activates inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) in the endoplasmic reticulum
  to trigger Ca2+ release. DAG directly binds and activates TRPC3, resulting in Ca2+
  influx. DAG and Ca2+ activate protein kinase C gamma (PKCƴ), which inhibits TRPC3
  via phosphorylation. Human mutations in genes associated with different parts of
  the signalling cascade cause distinct spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes as indicated
  in green boxes. SCA1 and 2, two of the most common SCAs, are caused by polyglutamine
  repeat expansions in Atxn1 and Atxn2 genes, respectively. The expanded genes have
  been associated both with reduced IP3R expression and increased sensitivity to activation
  by IP3 []. GLSP Gillespie syndrome. Figure created with BioRender.com.
