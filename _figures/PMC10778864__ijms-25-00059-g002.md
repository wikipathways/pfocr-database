caption: Schematic diagram of VEGF-VEGFR signaling pathway. The members of the VEGF
  family include VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFC, VEGFD, VEGFE, and PlGF. VEGFA has an important
  role in regulating the normal body and disease-related angiogenesis. VEGFB, PIGF,
  and VEGFA combine with VEGFR-1; VEGFA, VEGFC, and VEGFE combine with VEGFR-2; VEGFC
  and VEGFD combine with VEGFR-3. The VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 systems are responsible
  for angiogenesis, while VEGFR-3 is responsible for the angiogenesis of both blood
  vessels and lymphatics
