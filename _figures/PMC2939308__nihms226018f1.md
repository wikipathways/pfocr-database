caption: LOV inhibits HMG-CoA reductase of the mevalonate-pathway resulting in the
  depletion of cholesterol and isoprenoids i.e., farnesyl-pp and geranylgeranyl-pp
  responsible for an inhibition of Ras and RhoA signaling, respectively. RhoA mediated
  inhibition of ROCK signaling induces p38MAPK activation, which in turn induces COX-2
  mediated production of PPAR-γ activators i.e., 15d-PGJ2 via increased release of
  arachidonic acid (AA) from phospholipids (PP) metabolism by cPLA2. Subsequently,
  activated PPAR-γ induces PTEN which in turn inhibits PI3K-Akt signaling thus inhibits
  OPC proliferation via induction of the expression of cell cycle inhibitory proteins
  i.e., p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. These events subsequently induce the expression of myelin
  proteins leading to the differentiation of OPCs. Box depicts the mevalonate pathway,
  NT as neurotrophic factor, PKC as protein kinase C, SOX10 and sp1 as transcription
  factors. Pharmacological and biological agents used in the study are bolded (please
  see text for details).
