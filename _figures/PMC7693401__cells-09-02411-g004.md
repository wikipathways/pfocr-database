caption: Molecular events involved in the response of MCs to mediators produced by
  cell damage and stress. HMGB1, IL-33, adenosine and ATP are the best-characterized
  alarmins able to activate MCs after tissue damage. Together with hypoxic microenvironment,
  those signals activate distinct signaling pathways leading to cytokine production
  in MCs. Binding of HMGB1 to RAGE leads to the activation of the MyD88-dependent
  signaling pathway leading to NFκB transcription factor and promotes the production
  of TNF and IL-1β. IL-33 activates ST2 receptor and also triggers the MyD88-dependent
  signaling pathway. Downstream effectors of MyD88 (MK2/3) are essential for the secretion
  of IL-6 and IL-13. In addition, IL-33 favors the production of TNF with the participation
  of ERK and PI3K. ATP activates P2X7 purinoreceptors and induces calcium influx with
  the consequent degranulation. Activation of adenosine A3 receptor by adenosine triggers
  ERK and PI3K and promotes the production of inflammatory and angiogenic mediators.
  Hypoxia leads to the stabilization of HIF1α, production of ROS and Fyn -dependent
  VEGF and IL-6 secretion. ROS production promotes the glutathionylation (GSH) and
  translocation of the α1c subunit of Cav1.2 L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels
  (LVDCCs) from intracellular pools to plasma membrane. ROS and calcium entry promote
  the accumulation of CCL2 mRNA to, finally, induce the secretion of that chemokine.
  Stimulation pathways are represented with solid lines, whereas putative pathways
  are shown in dashed lines. Created with Biorender.com.
