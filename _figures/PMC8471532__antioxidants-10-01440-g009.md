caption: RSV activates the Nrf2/ARE pathway, which attenuates inflammation, oxidative
  stress, and apoptosis. Transcriptional activation of protective genes against SARS-CoV-2
  infection is mediated by a cis-acting component called the antioxidant responsive
  element (ARE). From a molecular perspective, Nrf2 binds to ARE and subsequently
  activates this pathway to protect cells from oxidative stress []. RSV activates
  the Nrf2/ARE pathway and promotes the expression of HO-1, thus inhibiting the inhibitory
  effect of NF-Kβ on antioxidants and its stimulation of inflammatory flares. In addition,
  activating the Nrf2/ARE pathway increases the expression of SIRT1/AMPK, which leads
  to a decrease in inflammation. In short, activating the Nrf2/ARE pathway not only
  increases the resistance of cells to oxidative stress but also increases the expression
  of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2; promotes cellular survival and inhibits the actions
  of pro-apoptotic proteins) and significantly inhibits Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK;
  activates apoptotic signaling by the upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes)-dependent
  caspase activity, thereby reducing host cell apoptosis. Figure generated with Biorender
