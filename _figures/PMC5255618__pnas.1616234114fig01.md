caption: Metabolic pathway reconstruction of Ca. Entotheonella. Ca. Entotheonella
  possesses various transporters for inorganic and organic substrates. Given the presence
  of appropriate transporters, the utilization of sugars is likely. The exact pathway
  of hexose and pentose catabolism, however, is elusive. Lactate, acetate, and glycerol
  are likely used as a carbon sources. MDH renders methanol available for energy metabolism.
  The assimilation of C1 compounds via the serine pathway is plausible; however, some
  uncertain annotations require experimental confirmation. DH, dehydrogenase; DHAP,
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate; KDG, 2-keto-3-deoxy
  gluconate; OA, oxaloacetate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Pfk, phosphofructokinase.
