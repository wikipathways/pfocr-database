caption: Role of mTOR-dependent processes in NMJ alteration upon aging. (A) Importance
  of protein synthesis and autophagy in the pre- and post-synaptic compartments of
  NMJs. (B) Age-dependent changes in NMJ morphology, showing post-synaptic changes
  (e.g. fragmentation, denervation) and compensatory changes in the pre-synaptic region
  (e.g., sprouting, poly-innervation). Scale bar, 10 μm. (C) Pathomechanisms involved
  in NMJ deterioration in aged muscle, and associated with (m)TOR deregulation. Primary
  destabilization of the post-synaptic compartment likely involves autophagy blockade
  and defective turnover in synaptic proteins. Changes in neural transmission, including
  increase in quantal content (QC) may be an attempt to compensate for post-synaptic
  decline and may in turn further aggravate NMJ deterioration. Decline of the post-synaptic
  compartment and retrograde feedback from muscle onto motor neuron may lead to the
  degeneration of the motor axon (dying back process). Exercise, IGF1, rapamycin and
  caloric restriction (CR) may limit age-related NMJ deterioration by modulating autophagy
  and/or (m)TOR-associated complexes. Red lines indicate inhibition; Green arrows
  represent activation; blue arrows show the beneficial effect of treatments.
