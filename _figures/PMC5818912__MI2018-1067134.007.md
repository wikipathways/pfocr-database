caption: 'ADAM17/EGFR signaling an important player in CF and COPD lung disease. In
  airway epithelial cells in culture, both CFTR deficiency [] and cigarette smoke
  exposure [] cause enhanced activity of the EGFR/ADAM17 signaling cascade, and thus
  enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors that are ADAM17
  substrates and signaling molecules that are downstream of the EGFR/MAPK pathway
  () including the proinflammatory CXCL8 (IL-8). In chronic lung disease, this could
  contribute to mucous metaplasia, inflammation, and tissue remodeling. A potential
  link between CFTR deficiency, COPD, and EGFR/ADAM17 activity (dashed arrows) is
  the extracellular redox potential, which is in part dependent on CFTR-related glutathione
  transport [, , ], and which in turn regulates ADAM17 activity (). In COPD, CS induced
  long-term downregulation of CFTR expression [, , ] can have the same long-term effect,
  in addition to the acute oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoke. In this figure,
  we focus on two canonical ADAM17 substrates: proinflammatory IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)
  and growth factor amphiregulin (AREG). AREG is proteolytically cleaved by ADAM17
  from airway epithelial cells and activates EGFR in the airway epithelial cells and
  on the underlying fibroblasts. IL-6R trans-signaling requires ADAM17-mediated shedding
  of the extracellular domain or alternative mRNA splicing. The soluble sIL-6R binds
  to IL-6 creating IL-6/sIL-6R complexes that trans-activate gp130 on the underlying
  myofibroblasts and myeloid cells. Signals transduced by AREG and IL-6R shed from
  airway epithelial cells converge in combined activation of the transcription factor
  STAT3 in myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. STAT3 is involved in fibrotic responses
  and inflammatory lung disease, and a modifier of CF lung disease []. Based on available
  literature cited in text, enhanced EGFR/ADAM17 signaling may contribute to hyperinflammation
  and epithelial metaplasia, fibroblast and smooth muscle cell activation, angiogenesis,
  and net deposition of extracellular matrix (tissue remodeling) observed in COPD
  and CF lung disease.'
