caption: A schematic diagram for FA to enhance the activities and expressions of ENaC
  in LPS-induced MTECs via cGMP/PKGII signaling pathway. Under normal circumstances,
  guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is translated into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)
  in the existence of membrane-bound guanylate cyclase (pGC) and free guanylyl cyclase
  (sGC). LPS is able to induce a desensitization of the sGC/cGMP-dependent pathway
  by decreasing protein expression levels of sGC-β1and increasing phosphodiesterase
  5 (PDE5) activities, hence cGMP is degraded drastically. FA can interdict the effect
  of LPS by increasing the expression of cGMP as well as downstream-cGMP-dependent
  protein kinase II (PKGII), which enhances the mRNA/protein expression and function
  of ENaC in MTECs, and can be reversed when MTECs are treated with Rp-cGMP (a special
  inhibitor for cGMP) or transfected with a small interference RNA targeted PKGII
  (siPKGII)
