caption: Schematic representation of adiponectin signal transduction pathway implicating
  a crosstalk with the insulin signaling pathway. Activation of insulin and adiponectin
  receptors by their respective ligands triggers a cascade of signaling events. Most
  of the metabolic effects of insulin are mediated by the PI3K/AKT pathway, leading
  to biological responses that include increased protein synthesis, lipogenesis, glucose
  uptake and utilization, and glycogen synthesis, and reduced lipolysis and gluconeogenesis.
  In the case of adiponectin, APPL1 interacts with AdipoR1 or AdipoR2 through its
  C-terminal PTB and CC domains, and mediates the effects of adiponectin on the activation
  of multiple pathways including PPAR-α, AMPK, and p38 MAPK. Both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2
  are associated with ceramidase activities that are activated upon adiponectin binding.
  One key binding partner of IRS1/2 is APPL1, which promotes IRS1/2 binding to the
  insulin receptor and enhances insulin signaling transduction. This crosstalk between
  insulin and adiponectin signaling pathways is a major mechanism by which adiponectin
  sensitizes insulin action in insulin target tissues.
