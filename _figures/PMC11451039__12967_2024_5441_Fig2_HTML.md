caption: Modulating mechanisms of the Ang/Tie signaling pathway. In a healthy vessel
  (left), Ang1 binds the extracellular domain of Tie2 and activates Tie2 intracellular
  signaling pathway at EC-EC junctions. The activated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway mediates
  the phosphorylation of FOXO1 and transcription of ang2. Akt can also maintain cell
  survival by inducing eNOS and survivin, and exert anti-apoptotic effects by inhibiting
  caspase-9 and BAD. Activated Tie2 can inhibit the activation of NF-κB by interacting
  with ABIN-2, thereby inhibiting the expression of inflammatory genes. Ang1/Tie2
  signaling can stabilize vessels by activating the GTPase signaling pathways. RAC1
  dephosphorylates MLC2 to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton. Src, the downstream molecule
  of VEGF/VEGFR2, is sequestered by mDia, thereby prevent phosphorylation and internalization
  of VEC. In motile/non-contact ECs, Tie2 is localised at the EC-ECM and preferentially
  activates ERK to conduct cell migration and proliferation. Under inflammatory conditions
  (middle), cleavage of the Tie1 extracellular domain correlates with the switch of
  Ang2 from an agonist to an antagonist of Tie2. Suppression of Tie2 signaling pathway
  leads to cytoskeleton instability, inflammation, pericyte detachment and Ang2 positive
  feedback formation. At this point, VE-PTP inhibits the intracellular domain of Tie2.
