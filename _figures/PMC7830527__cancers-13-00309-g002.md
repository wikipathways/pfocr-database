caption: Proposed IFN-γ-dependent mechanisms of hyperprogression. The release of IFN-γ
  from CD8+ T cells after ICI therapy can activate the inflammasome pathway by upregulating
  PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and activating NLRP3 signaling, resulting in immunosuppressive
  MDSC recruitment in the tumor microenvironment. At the same time, IFN-γ can induce
  IDO1 activity in tumor cells, which activates the JNK pathway, leading to p53 downregulation
  and tumor growth. Finally, the concomitant stimulation of tumor-specific CD8+ T
  cells by ICI therapy and T-cell-receptor (TCR) activation results in a hyperactivated
  immune environment in which IFN-γ triggers the activation-induced cell death (AICD)
  mechanism and T-cell Fas-mediated apoptosis.
