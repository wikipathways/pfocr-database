caption: a Chemical synthesis of n-butyraldehyde from petrochemical feedstock. Propylene
  and syngas are reacted under high temperature and pressure to form n-butyraldehyde.
  Commercially important downstream products are shown as representative applications.
  b Metabolic pathway for n-butyraldehyde biosynthesis from glucose. Six genes are
  overexpressed to produce n-butyraldehyde. Native adh genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenases
  are knocked out to prevent excessive reduction of n-butyraldehyde. Fdh formate dehydrogenase;
  AtoB acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; Hbd 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase; Crt crotonase;
