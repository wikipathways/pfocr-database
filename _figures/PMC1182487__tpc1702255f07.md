caption: Dual Role for GI in Regulating Circadian Rhythms and Flowering Time.The central
  oscillator of the Arabidopsis circadian clock was proposed to consist of a negative
  feedback loop comprising LHY/CCA1 and TOC1 (). Within this loop, TOC1 acts in the
  evening to promote expression of LHY/CCA1 in the morning, and LHY/CCA1 repress TOC1
  expression. LHY and CCA1 are also shown as negative regulators of GI based on the
  earlier phase of GI expression detected in a lhy-11 cca1-1 double mutant (); however,
  overexpression of CCA1 causes an increase in GI expression, which may suggest a
  more complex pattern of regulation (). GI may play a role in the evening related
  to that of TOC1 because it is also required for high amplitude expression of LHY/CCA1,
  is expressed in a similar phase as TOC1, and both gi mutations as well as 35S:GI
  have effects on circadian phase and period length. In the control of flowering time,
  GI increases the amplitude of CO and FT expression, which are both increased by
  35S:GI and decreased by gi mutations. In addition, 35S:GI and gi mutations have
  opposite effects on flowering time. GI is therefore proposed to play dual roles
  acting within the circadian clock to regulate period length and circadian phase,
  while also more directly promoting expression of a circadian clock output pathway
  that includes CO and FT and promotes flowering. The effect of GI on flowering probably
  includes another pathway, indicated with an X, because co mutations only partially
  suppress the early flowering caused by 35S:GI or lhy cca1. FT activates SOC1 downstream
  of CO (; ). In the diagram, the square illustrates the circadian oscillator that
  generates circadian rhythms, white illustrates daytime, and gray shading illustrates
  nighttime. The flowering pathway is one of many output pathways controlled by the
  circadian clock, and three other pathways expressed at different times of the day
  are illustrated. The genes shown in gray on the right-hand side of the figure are
  those that promote flowering in response to LDs and delay flowering when inactivated.
