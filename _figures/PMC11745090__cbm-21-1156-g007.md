caption: Schematic diagram of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway activation in mouse
  liver macrophages. IRs, inhibitory receptors (IRs); ICIs, immune checkpoint inhibitors;
  IL-6, interleukin-6; ALT, alanine transaminase (ALT). In mice with immune-related
  adverse events (irAEs), EGFR is expressed on the surface of liver macrophages, which
  also harbor immunosuppressive receptors. When osimertinib is administered in combination
  with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), phosphorylation of EGFR (wild-type) on
  the surface of liver macrophages is inhibited and the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway
  is activated, leading to an increase in the release of cytokines into the serum,
  resembling a “cytokine storm.” Notably, the addition of ruxolitinib, a small molecule
  inhibitor of JAK1/JAK2, to block the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway resulted in
  a significant decrease in the levels of these cytokines in the serum
