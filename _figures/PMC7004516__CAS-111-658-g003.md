caption: Association of efficacy of 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) and metabolic changes in
  cultured colorectal cancer cells. A, Representative image of monolayer and 3D sphere‐cultured
  HCT116 cells. B, Cytotoxic effect of 5‐FU in monolayer and 3D sphere‐cultured HCT116
  cells. The cell viabilities were measured at 2 d after treatment with each concentration
  of 5‐FU. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed
  using Welch’s t test. **P < 0.01. C, Representation of the spheroid upregulated
  and downregulated proteins on the carbohydrate metabolism pathway. Red and blue
  colors represent upregulated and downregulated proteins, respectively

  chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.
