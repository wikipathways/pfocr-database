caption: The single gene and protein network generated by Approach 3 (Network 1) that
  demonstrated significance as a clinical relapse predictor following a stringent
  permutation based test. Nodes correspond to proteins in the Ingenuity Pathway Database.
  a and b show the network with protein and gene expression overlaid, respectively.
  In each figure, red and green coloring represents proteins/genes that are up- and
  down-regulated, respectively, in the laser capture microdissected cancer cells relative
  to normal epithelium. Nodes in a and b are annotated with the spectral index and
  log fold change for that protein and gene, respectively.
