caption: Gene repertoire for sterol biosynthesis in unicellular holozoans. The canonical
  ergosterol synthesis pathway of fungi and cholesterol synthesis pathway of vertebrates
  are detailed (blue and red boxes, respectively), with the enzymes involved in each
  step indicated. Bullets indicate the presence of homologues for the corresponding
  enzymes in the C. owczarzaki and/or M. brevicollis genomes, for comparison. Coloured
  bullets indicate homologues of proteins that are considered exclusive either of
  fungal (blue) or vertebrate (red) clades. The Rieske sterol C7-desaturase is shown
  apart as it is not involved, as far as is known, in de novo sterol synthesis.
papertitle: Sterol metabolism in the filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki has features
  that resemble both fungi and animals.
