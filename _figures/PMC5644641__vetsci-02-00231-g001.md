caption: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK) pathway. The MAPK/ERK signaling pathway is activated by many different extracellular
  signals such as binding of growth factors (e.g., EGF) to its receptors (e.g., EGFR).
  Activated receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates and activates RAS family proteins
  through GRB2-SOS adaptor protein complex. Activated RAS protein, in turn, activates
  the serine/threonine kinase function of RAF proteins. RAF phosphorylates MEK, which
  phosphorylates and activates ERK, initiating the signal transduction of many genes
  involved in various cellular processes.
