caption: IGF-1 signaling pathways. In the figure, the signaling molecules and miRNAs
  that activate protein synthesis and/or inhibit protein degradation are shown in
  green, while the ones that inhibit protein synthesis and/or activate protein degradation
  are shown in blue. The majority of IGF-1 in the body are bound to IGFBP and IGFALS,
  and its activity is suppressed. Once IGF-1 binds to IGF-1R, IRS-1 and PI3K are recruited
  and activated. PI3K converts PIP2 to PIP3, which activates PDK1 and Akt. Akt activates
  protein synthesis via activation of ribosomal protein S6 and the translation initiation
  factor eIF4E downstream of mTORC1, and activation of β-catenin and eIF2B downstream
  of GSK3β. Akt can suppress UPS activity via inhibition of FoxO-mediated transcription
  of E3 ubiquitin ligases MAFbx/Atrogin-1, MUSA1, and SMART. MuRF1 expression is induced
  by cytokines such as TNF-α via NF-κB pathway. Akt could phosphorylate IκΒ and activate
  the NF-κΒ pathway, although it has not been shown in skeletal muscle and multiple
  studies have shown IGF-1 activation does not alter MuRF1 expression. Myostatin and
  BMP signaling compete against each other for their usage of Smad4. Activation of
  myostatin inhibits BMP-mediated Smad1/5/8 translocation to the nucleus, thus inhibiting
  MUSA1-mediated UPS activity. Akt can also downregulate ActRIIB and inhibit ALK4/5
  via unknown mechanisms. Although it has not been shown in skeletal muscle, Akt can
  interact directly with unphosphorylated Smad3 to sequester it outside the nucleus.
  Several miRNAs have been shown to regulate IGF-1 signaling. miR-486 is inhibited
  by the myostatin/Smad pathway, resulting in inhibition of IGF-1 signaling via PTEN
  increase. miR-1 and miR-133 target IGF-1 and IGF-1R, respectively, and their expression
  is reduced during muscle hypertrophy. IRS-1 could be inhibited by miR-128 and miR-15.
  LncIRS1 (not shown in the figure), which is upregulated in hypertrophic muscles,
  can act as sponge for miR-15, resulting in activation of IRS-1. Note that studies
  have shown conflicting evidence on miR-29′s role in IGF-1 signaling in skeletal
  muscle, and it may potentiate or inhibit IGF-1 signaling. Pathways that are unclear
  and/or not shown in skeletal muscle are shown in dotted lines.
