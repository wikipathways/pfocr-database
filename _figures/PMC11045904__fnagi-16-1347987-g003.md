caption: The intricate relationship between the gut and brain axes in PD is delineated
  by the schematic signaling pathway, with a focus on the inflammatory cascade triggered
  by dysbiosis at the gut lumen and BBB. Dysbiosis leads to an imbalance in gut microbiota
  composition, which in turn fosters the release of inflammatory cytokines. These
  cytokines breach the BBB and infiltrate the brain, where they exert their detrimental
  effects on dopaminergic neurons. The figure highlights the crucial role of dysbiosis-induced
  inflammation in contributing to the neurodegenerative characteristic of PD, emphasizing
  the potential therapeutic targets within the gut-brain axis for mitigating disease
  progression (Stefanis, 2012; Mey et al., 2023)
