caption: Retino-cortical circuits involved in rapid visual responses. This figure
  illustrates the most rapid connections between retina and area MT+, omitting many
  multi-synaptic connections. The colour coding of the diagram relates to the endpoint
  of transmission, with Area MT and its thalamic afferents shown in orange. In a similar
  fashion, the motion sensitive areas surrounding Area MT -namely MST, FST, MTcm and
  their afferents are labelled in purple. The Parvocellular inputs (P) to Area V1
  are labelled in green while the koniocellular (K) laminae of the LGN are cross-hatched,
  indicating projections to both Area MT as well as to the superficial layers (II
  and III) of Area V1. Rapid emotional processing is indicated by the pathway from
  superior colliculus (SC) to the medial pulvinar (PM) and thence to the Amygdala
  which projects strongly to the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). This pathway, putatively
  provides emotional attention via thalamic response gain modulation, is coloured
  in yellow.
