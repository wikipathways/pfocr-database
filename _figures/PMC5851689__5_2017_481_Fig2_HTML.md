caption: Possible effects of activation of STING signaling in tumor cells. Activation
  of STING pathway in tumor cells can lead to secretion of chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10
  that promote infiltration of NK cells and T cells into tumor. STING-mediated signaling
  induces expression of ligands NKG2DL on tumor cells that participate in activation
  of NK cells and induction of antitumor response. On the other hand it promotes also
  the expression of PD-L1 that plays a major role in suppressing the function of T
  cells. Cancer cells can also secrete type I IFNs that activate DCs to facilitate
  the priming of cytotoxic T cells. STING pathway activation may also lead to cancer
  cell death. The figure was prepared using Servier Medical Art (http://www.servier.com)
