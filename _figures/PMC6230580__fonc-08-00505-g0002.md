caption: Snail, one of EMT transcription factors, could dramatically impair cell-cycle
  progression by repressing the transcription of cyclin D2. Moreover, Snail could
  suppress tumor cell proliferation through binding to flanking region of proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene to decrease its expression. When Snail suppresses
  the expression of PCNA, the PAF (PCNA-associated factor) then dissociates from PCNA
  complexes and combines with β-catenin, which then upregulates Wnt/β-catenin target
  gene expression via activating Wnt signaling pathway and represses E-cadherin expression.
  And Zeb1 and Snail induce G1 arrest by promoting hypophosphorylation of Rb protein,
  the suppressor protein of tumor progression, and decreasing the expression of cyclin
  D1.
