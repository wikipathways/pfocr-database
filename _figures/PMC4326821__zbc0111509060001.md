caption: 'Summary of the three metabolic pathways evaluated. A, the metabolic routes
  from glucose to ethanol following the EMP, the ED, and the RPP pathways. B, the
  affiliation between the carbon positions in glucose and the carbon positions in
  ethanol and other fermentation products of these pathways. Enzymes indicated are:
  1, G6P dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49); 2, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9);
  3, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating), (EC 1.1.1.44); 4, phosphogluconate
  dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.12); 5, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.14);
  6, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13); 7, triose phosphate isomerase
  (EC 1.2.1.12); 8, phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.9); 9, enolase (EC 4.2.1.11); 10, pyruvate
  kinase EC 2.7.1.40); 11, pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4); 12, alcohol dehydrogenase
  (EC 1.1.1.1). P, phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate.'
