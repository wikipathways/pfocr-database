caption: 'IPA’s individual pathway analysis of different proteins from the different
  experimental groups, linking them to a suggested promotion or inhibition of a cellular
  event under the umbrella of inhibition of cell death or change in cytoskeletal activity.
  (a) Inhibition of Apoptosis comparing BK 6 h treated podocytes versus controls (ANXA1:
  Annexin A1, HSP90AB1: Hsp90 alpha family class B member 1, RTN4: Reticulon 4, PTGS-2:
  Prostaglandin H-Synthase 2). (b) Inhibition of Necrosis comparing BK-6h treated
  podocytes versus controls (ITGB1: Integrin subunit Beta 1, TCP-1: T-complex 1).
  (c) Activation of Microtubule Dynamics activity comparing BK- 3h treated podocytes
  vs BK-6h treated podocytes (ACTB: Actin Beta, GNAS: GNAS complex locus, HSP90AA1:
  Hsp90 alpha family class A member 1, RAN: RAN, member RAS family oncogene). (d)
  Suggestion of Microtubule Dynamics activity comparing BK-3h treated podocytes vs
  control (EZR: Ezrin, RHOA: Ras homolog family member A). (e) Inhibition of Transport
  of Molecules comparing BK-3h vs. Bk-6h treated podocytes (ACSL3: acyl-CoA synthetase
  long-chain family member 3, TOMM70: Translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane
  70, VDAC1: voltage dependent anion channel 1. (f) The network titled “Cell Death
  and Survival, Cancer, GI Disease” of the BK -3h vs. BK-6h groups in the network
  analysis function of IPA showing PTGS-2/COX-2 with other proteins, expressed (colored)
  or suggested (uncolored). PTGS-2/COX-2 is directly in contact with the proteins
  ALOX5 (arachidonate-5-lipoxygenase), IL1R1 (interleukin 1 receptor type 1), PTGER2
  (prostaglandin E receptor 2), PTGER4 (prostaglandin E receptor4), NFκB (complex)
  (nuclear factor kappa-light chain-enhancer of activated B cells), TNF (tumor necrosis
  factor).'
