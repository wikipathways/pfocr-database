caption: 'The modulatory effect of curcumin on the MAPK pathway. Curcumin exerts its
  anticancer activity through the modulation of key components involved in the MAPK
  signaling pathway. Curcumin targets TGF, EGFR, ERK1/2, MKK4/7, JNK, and P38 molecules
  and downregulates the expression level of nuclear c-Myc, c-Fos, and c-Jun as the
  downstream targets of the MAPK pathway, which results in the inhibition of cellular
  proliferation and migration as well as apoptosis induction in hormone receptor negative
  breast cancer. Cur: curcumin, G-protein: guanine nucleotide-binding protein, TGF:
  transforming growth factor, GFs: growth factors, EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor,
  Raf: rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK:
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase, MEK: MAPK/ERK kinase, Mekk: Mek kinase, MKK:
  MAPK kinase, JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinases.'
