caption: A) The inferred roles of the dual-activity mannosyltransferase/phosphorylases
  (MTPs) towards mannogen synthesis (MTP 1,2) or degradation (MTP 3,4,6,7), and the
  key roles of mannogen and its precursor/products are shown. (B) Evolutionary origins
  of mannogen/MTP pathway. The ancestral MTP genes were likely acquired from bacteria,
  early in the evolution of the Leishmaniiae (which primarily reside within invertebrates,
  although Phytomonas also infect plants) and following the divergence of this group
  from the lineage leading to trypanosomes, which lack MTPs and mannogen (black lines).
  The presence of mannogen/MTPs (blue lines) predated, and may have facilitated, the
  transition of Leishmania to vertebrate parasitism (red lines). Adapted from Sernee
  et al. [].
