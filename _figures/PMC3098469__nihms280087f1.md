caption: 'During chemotaxis, cAMP stimulates intracellular signaling through the cAR1
  receptor and coupled heterotrimeric G-proteins (G). These signaling pathways control
  actin polymerization as well as the assembly and activity of myosin II. In the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3
  (PIP3) pathway, the amount and localization of PIP3 are regulated by PI3Ks and PTEN.
  This signaling cascade participates in crosstalk with the Ras GTPase-TORC2 pathway
  by interacting with PI3K-Ras GTPase and activating PKBs. In the Ras GTPase-TORC2
  pathway, PKBs generate a negative feedback loop by phosphorylating and inactivating
  the Sca1 complex (Sca1C). Soluble guanlyl cyclase (sGC) also modulates actin polymerization
  and myosin II. PLA2A generates a yet-to-be-determined arachidonic acid-related lipid
  (AARL) as a second messenger. Tsu: Tsunami, PDK: phosphoinositide dependent kinase,
  GbpC: cGMP binding prrotein C, MHCK: myosin heavy chain kinase, MLCK: myosin light
  chain kinase.'
