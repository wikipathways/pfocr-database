caption: A model depicting the predicted roles of RgsA. RgsA negatively regulates
  the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and stress-activated signaling pathway. This is predicted
  to be accomplished by RgsA’s role in attenuating the target heterotrimeric G proteins.
  The lack of RgsA leads to the accelerated and prolonged activation of the target
  G proteins; thus, enhanced activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and stress-activated
  signaling pathway, which in turn leads to increased production of GT, enhanced virulence,
  and an elevated oxidative stress response. In contrast, polysaccharide breakdown
  activity may be inhibited by the lack of rgsA.
