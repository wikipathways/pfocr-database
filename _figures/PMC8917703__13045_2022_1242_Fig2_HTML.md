caption: Combination strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1
  blockade. A Combination therapy with PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockers. The activation of
  PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 can be blocked by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 antibodies, respectively.
  The combined application of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors produces synergistic effects.
  B Combination therapy with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is able to induce ICD, promote
  the release of tumor antigens and DAMPs, activate DCs, induce local production of
  CXCL10, recruit T cells to the tumor bed and enhance the differentiation of antitumor-specific
  CTLs. Chemotherapy can also reduce the number of immunosuppressive cells, such as
  MDSCs and Tregs. However, systemic chemotherapy shows undifferentiated toxicity
  to tumor cells and the anticancer immune system, while local chemotherapy enhances
  immunotherapy by remodeling the TME and attracting activated immune cells to the
  tumor region. C Combination therapy with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy markedly upregulates
  the cell adhesion factors ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on the surface of cancer cells. One
  of the mechanisms by which radiotherapy may enhance immunotherapy is through activation
  of certain types of club cells which release proteins that are beneficial to immunotherapy.
  D Combination therapy with an AMPK activator. Reduced PD-L1 levels in the presence
  of AMPK activation could enhance the efficacy of combining ICB with an AMPK activator.
  E Combination therapy with STING agonists. The cGAS-STING pathway is essential for
  linking the innate immunity and adaptive immunity against cancers. Cancer cells
  can escape immune surveillance by inactivating the cGAS-STING pathway. Therefore,
  ICB can be combined with STING agonists to boost the efficacy of immunotherapy.
  F “Cold” tumors lack activated tumor-specific T cells, which may contribute to primary
  resistance to ICBs. Effective combination therapy can turn these tumors into hot
  tumors that are sensitive to ICBs
