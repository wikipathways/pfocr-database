caption: Summary of the role of CCN2 in palate developmental pathways in the WT environment
  and proposed effects in the CCN2 KO setting. In the absence of CCN2, some signaling
  pathways (e.g., TGF-β, EGF, and FGF) may be reduced, while other pathways (e.g.,
  BMP and the canonical Wnt pathway) may be augmented. On the other hand, if the FGF
  pathway inhibitor SPRY2 is decreased, this could result in increased FGFR and EGFR
  signaling. In the absence of CCN2, the potential for dramatically altered expression
  of downstream target genes for each of these signaling pathways exists and warrants
  further exploration in the developing palatal shelves of CCN2 KO embryos.
