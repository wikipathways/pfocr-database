caption: The underlying renoprotective mechanisms of anthraquinones by regulating
  IƙB/NF-ƙB, Keap1/Nrf2 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. AKI and CKD lead to
  the activations of proinflammatory IƙB/NF-ƙB and impaired Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathways
  as well as PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Treatment with anthraquinones such
  as rhein, emodin, and chrysophanol could improve renal function and inhibit renal
  fibrosis by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation. Treatment with anthraquinones
  such as emodin and aloe-emodin could improve renal function, reduce podocyte damage,
  and inhibit renal fibrosis by regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
