caption: HIV and the intestinal microbiome interact substantially, leading to gut
  permeability, inflammation, and immune activation and microbial translocation. TMAO
  is upregulated in this pathway and is associated with diffuse myocardial fibrosis,
  which may be a precursor to structural heart disease and diastolic dysfunction.
  Figure created with Biorender.com. HFpEF indicates heart failure with preserved
  ejection fraction; and TMAO, transmethylamine‐N‐oxide.
