caption: 'ERRγ-mediated type I IFN production by poly (I:C), and its potential impact
  on ER-mediated functions and diseases. (A) Estrogen receptors (ERs) are involved
  in human health and diseases. There is a crosstalk between IFNs and ER signaling
  in host defense. ERRs may regulate ER-mediated target genes by binding to ER binding
  sites. (B) MDA5 and RIG-I are involved in poly (I:C)-mediated ERRγ induction through
  JNK/AP-1 pathway. ERRγ induces expression of IFNα and IFNβ by binding to their promoters.
  Anti-IFNAR1 antibodies block ERRγ induction, suggesting a potential positive feedback
  loop between ERRγ and type I IFNs. TF: transcriptional factor'
