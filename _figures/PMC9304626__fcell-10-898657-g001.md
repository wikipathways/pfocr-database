caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of ferroptosis in diabetic ulcers and
  the mechanism of ferrostatin-1 repairing diabetic ulcers by inhibiting ferroptosis
  through PI3K-AKT. In diabetic ulcers, the synthesis of lipid peroxidation products
  is gradually increased as the increasing amount of glucose enters the cells. Under
  the action of intracellular iron ions, lipid peroxides continue to accumulate, thereby
  attacking cellular DNA and other biological macromolecules in the granulation tissue
  of ulcerated skin, ultimately triggering cellular ferroptosis. Ferrostatin-1, an
  inhibitor of ferroptosis, can reduce lipid peroxidative damage by activating the
  PI3K-AKT signaling pathway to block the pathway of ferroptosis, and at the same
  time promoting the regeneration, differentiation, and migration of vascular endothelial
  cells and epithelial cells, thereby effectively improving the ability of wound healing.
  In the process of ferroptosis, SLC7A11, SLC3A2, and the consume of glutathione lead
  to the accumulation of iron-dependent ROS. In addition, glucose and glutamine metabolism
  will decrease the levels of glutathione and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), resulting
  in the production of iron-independent reactive oxygen species. Ferroptosis is mediated
  by excess iron between cells. Ferric iron (Fe3+) binds to transferrin and is imported
  into cells through the membrane protein transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). Then, Fe3+
  is reduced to Fe2+ by reductase. Finally, excess intracellular iron generates ROS
  through the Fenton reaction, which triggers ferroptosis.
