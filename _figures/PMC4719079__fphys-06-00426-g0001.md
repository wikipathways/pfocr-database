caption: 'Mechanism linking excess fatty acids to insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
  (A): (1) Excess free fatty acids (FFAs) are esterified in AcylCoAs, substrates involved
  in both synthetic and oxidative pathways. In the synthetic pathway, they are either
  stored as Triacylglycerols (TG) in lipid droplets or accumulated in metabolites
  (DAGs, Ceramides) that act as signaling molecules and may interfere with normal
  cellular signaling. DAGs are associated with membrane translocation and activation
  of Protein kinase C theta (PKC-θ), increased IRS1 serine/threonine phosphorylation
  and decreased insulin-stimulated IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas Ceramides
  impair insulin action by inhibiting protein kinase PKB/AKT (dark blue). In the oxidative
  pathway, AcylCoAs are imported into the mitochondria by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1
  (CPT-1) shuttle and degraded via β-oxidation (in purple). (2) Insulin signaling
  pathway impaired by excess FFA (in green). Among FFAs, saturated FAs (SFAs) stimulate
  the activation of several inflammatory pathways. (3) Receptor-mediated mechanisms,
  as those of Toll like receptors 2/4 (TLR 2/4), activate serine kinases inhibitor
  kappaB kinase (IKK) and c-JUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). The activation of PKCθ
  also contributes to IKK and JNK activation. Altogether, these kinases catalyze IRS1
  serine phosphorylation and lead to a reduction of insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine
  phosphorylation, impairing insulin action. Moreover, IKK/NFkB axis (4) triggers
  expression of inflammatory genes with cytokines production (e.g., Tumor necrosis
  factor, TNFα), which in turn activate intracellular pathways promoting insulin resistance
  development (in light blue). (5) SFAs enter the cellular membranes and incorporate
  into them reducing membrane fluidity and creating or expanding subdomains rich in
  cholesterol and sphingolipids (lipid raft). They induce clustering and activation
  of cytosolic cSRC. cSRC activity is required for JNK1 activation and inhibition
  of insulin signaling (in grey). (6) Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), induced
  by lipotoxicity, contributes to activate inflammatory pathways and impair insulin
  signaling. (B): Putative role of mitochondria in development of IR. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction in presence of excess FFAs leads to intramyocellular lipid accumulation
  due to impaired β-oxidation. Decreased mitochondrial mass, respiratory capacities
  and ATP synthesis have been found in obesity and diabetes. Alternatively, excess
  FFA within mitochondria in the absence of increased energy demand stimulates oxidative
  stress with high rates of ROS production and H2O2 emission and a shift to a more
  oxidized intracellular redox environment, ultimately leading to the development
  of IR.'
