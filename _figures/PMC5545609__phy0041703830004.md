  These result in slowed glycolytic flux. As a consequence, glycolytic intermediates
  are diverted into side-branch pathways such as the polyol pathway, glycation pathway,
  and dysregulated glycosylation, leading to further excessive ROS and advanced glycation
  end products (AGEs) production. 1,3BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 3DG, 3-deoxyglucosone;
