caption: Potential second cysteine synthesis pathway in C. albicans. The pathways
  for the synthesis of homocysteine, methionine, cysteine, and S-adenosylmethionine
  are shown. In S. cerevisiae (genes in green) the sulfate assimilation pathway flows
  toward the production of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine. The existence of an
  alternative route such as the OAS pathway described for A. nidulans is found in
  C. albicans biofilm cells (ORFs in red).
