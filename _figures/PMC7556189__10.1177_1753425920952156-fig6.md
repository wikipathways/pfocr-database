caption: Proposed model for suppressed P. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis in RAW264.7
  cells by activation of autophagy. The invasion of P. aeruginosa markedly increases
  abundance of apoptosis and autophagy in RAW264.7 cells. Rapamycin stimulates autophagy
  effectively and eliminates the accumulation of ROS which would reduce cellular damage
  caused by oxidative. Then the activated MAPK signalling components and their down-stream
  target gene further regulate apoptosis associated proteins Bax, Bcl-2, Cytc, caspase-9,
  caspase-3 and PARP production. Consequently, the activated autophagy suppresses
  P. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells.
