caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of apoptosis observed in normal and AD brains. (a)
  Apoptosis is transduced by two main signaling pathways: intrinsic pathway mediated
  by mitochondria and extrinsic pathway mediated by DRs. After the initiation of apoptosis,
  signaling transduction is dependent on the activation of pro-apoptotic caspases.
  Caspase-9, an initial caspase in the intrinsic pathway, is activated by Cyto c and
  APAF1, assembling apoptosomes. Caspase-8, an initial caspase in the extrinsic pathway,
  is activated by the oligomerization of DRs and the subsequent recruitment of adaptor
  proteins, forming the DISC. Activated caspase-9 and -8 then trigger the activation
  of executioner caspase-3, leading to apoptosis in the neural cells. (b) In AD brains,
  as apoptosis is not appropriately regulated, both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways
  are elevated. Initial caspases are more activated by abnormal protein aggregates
  and increased Fas ligands. The activation of initial caspases induces the activation
  of caspase-3 with the large occurrence of apoptosis during AD.'
