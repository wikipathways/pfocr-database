caption: Regulatory networks sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in H3255 and
  MKN45 cells revealed by PhosphpScan-SILAC study. (A) Core signaling molecules inhibited
  by both gefitinib in H3255 cells and Su11274 in MKN45 cells. The proteins indicated
  show at least one phosphotyrosine site reduced >2.5-fold at 3 h of drug treatment.
  Signaling pathway connections are from PhosphoSite (), with additional protein–protein
  interactions extracted from PROTEOME. (B) RTK networks revealed by PhosphoScan-SILAC
  in MKN45 cells (Left). Receptor tyrosine kinase activation loop tyrosine sites inhibited
  by Su11274 in MKN45 cells (Right). (C) RTK networks revealed by PhosphoScan-SILAC
  in H3255 cells. In B and C, WB indicates the sites identified by Western blot analysis.
  All other sites are from PhosphoScan-SILAC study. Solid arrow, known interaction;
  dashed arrow, predicted interaction.
