caption: The crosstalk of RON with MET, EGFR, and IGF-1R occurs in various cancer
  cells and cause increased tumorigenic activity. RON also crosstalks with viral envelope
  oncoproteins derived from JSRV and FLV to cell transformation and proliferation.
  At least four signaling pathways are activated upon crosstalking. The β-catenin
  pathway is stimulated through RON-mediated PI-3K-AKT pathway that activates protein
  dishevel (DVL) and inactivates glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β leading to cytoplasmic
  β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation. The crosstalk between RON and
  the NF-κB pathway causes cancer cell growth, angiogenesis, and survival. NF-κB also
  directly binds the RON promoter, increases RON transcription, and enhances RON-mediated
  cancer cell migration. In epithelial cells, RON crosstalks with TGF-β signaling
  to induce EMT for cancer cell invasiveness. Moreover, RONΔ55 binds the FLV envelope
  protein and interacts with the JAK-Stat3 pathway to induce erythropoietin-independent
  proliferation of erythroid cells. CM, cell membrane; CXCL, Chemokine (C-X-C motif)
  ligand; Gab, GRB2-associated-binding protein; IKK, IκB Kinase; IRS-1, insulin receptor
  substrate-1; JAK, Janus kinase; MMP, matrix metallopeptidase; NM nuclear membrane.

  transducer and activator of transcription; and VEGF, vascular endothelial growth
