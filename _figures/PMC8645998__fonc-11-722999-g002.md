caption: Molecular pathways linking inflammation and cancer. Chronic inflammation
  acts as an extrinsic pathway for cancer development. In tissue cells, genetic and
  epigenetic alterations act as intrinsic pathway to induce cell transformation. Both
  pathways impact on the activation of transcription factors that support inflammation
  and tumorigenesis. Created with Biorender.com.
