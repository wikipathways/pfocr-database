caption: 'a The PI3K pathway is the evolutionary conserved signalling pathway to ensure
  that growth and development is synchronised to the appropriate metabolic conditions:
  energy and substrate requiring processes only proceed when a ‘fed state’ is indicated.
  In metazoans, the insulin/IGF receptor modulates the activity of the PI3K pathway
  according to social signals indicating metabolic status throughout the organism.
  Growth and development is regulated, along with nutrient partitioning, and appropriate
  signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM) that are integrated via integrin receptors
  that associate with the insulin/IGF receptors in the cell membrane. b Perturbed
  metabolism and insulin/IGF activity can reprogram cell behaviour via modifying FOXO
  transcription factors: promoting epithelial mesenchymal transition and activating
  developmental cell programs resulting in cells adopting a metastatic phenotype.
  Mutations in the PI3K pathway and loss of PTEN can result in constitutive activation
  of the pathway promoting more autonomous control, less dependent on external signals,
  and further promotes progression and metastasis'
