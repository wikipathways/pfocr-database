caption: 'Relationship of various metabolic pathways for AKI and combat injury. Metabolites
  included in the schematic were either a top 10 VIP metabolite or were statistically
  significant (p < 0.05). Metabolic pathways: glycolysis, TCA cycle, folate and methionine
  cycles, Cori and Cahill cycles, gut microbe metabolism, and NAD+ salvage pathway.
  Bolded metabolites were identified in the 1H-NMR analysis. Metabolites in green
  were significantly higher in patients who reached the endpoint or mortality/RRT
  and/or had more severe AKI. Metabolites in red were significantly lower in patients
  who reached the endpoint or mortality/RRT and/or had more severe AKI'
