caption: '(A) Apoptosis induced either by the intrinsic pathway or by extrinsic death
  receptor signaling (e.g. TNFR1 and CD95) leads to characteristic morphological changes:
  nuclear condensation, cell shrinkage, budding of apoptotic bodies. Caspase-mediated
  inhibition of the ATP11C flippase and activation of Xkr8 scramblase exposes phosphatidyl-serine
  residues (PS) on the outside of the plasma membrane. Macrophages use several receptors
  (e.g. TIM4 and MERTK) to bind exposed PS residues (”eat me” signal) and phagocytose
  debris. (B) Programmed necrotic mechanisms display morphologic features of cellular
  swelling and loss of plasma membrane integrity. Necrosis culminates in the release
  of cytokines, chemokines, DAMPs and other intracellular molecules. These cellular
  contents are sensed by immune cells, which engage innate immune pathways (eg. TLRs,
  RAGE1, RIGI/MAVS) to promote activation and boost local inflammation.'
