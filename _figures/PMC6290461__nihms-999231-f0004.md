caption: Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in ageing and ageing-associated diseases
  (AADs) is driven by a decrease in insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signalling,
  or uncoupling of IGF1 and mTOR signalling resulting from chronic activation of the
  IGF-1 pathway (indicated by interruption of arrow), and increased activation of
  mTOR, resulting from impaired AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1
  (SIRT1) signalling. Increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to
  increased mitochondrial activity, decreased levels of antioxidants and decreased
  PCG1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α) activity, resulting
  in impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover, causes damage to DNA, proteins
  and other macromolecules. Decreased efficiency of DNA repair pathways and proteostasis
  pathways, including autophagy and ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS)-mediated degradation
  of damaged proteins, during (premature) ageing and in AADs further contributes to
  the deleterious effects of ROS on mitochondrial integrity and cellular homeostasis.
