caption: Comprehensive exploration of the heterogeneity of HCC analysis scheme. Through
  single-cell sequencing, HCC could be classified as three subtypes according to the
  expression level of marker genes PTPRC and FOXP3. Further single-cell metabolomic
  analysis revealed that the immunocompetent subtype is with upregulated urea cycle,
  the immunosuppressive subtype is with upregulated TCA cycle and inhibited glycolysis
  pathway, and the immunodeficient subtype presents upregulated nucleotide biosynthesis
  pathway.
