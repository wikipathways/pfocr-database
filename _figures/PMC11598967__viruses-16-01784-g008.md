caption: Model of mechanism through which HSPA4 promotes BRSV entry. The activation
  of the PI3K–Akt signaling pathway by HSPA4 upregulates CHC expression, thereby boosting
  clathrin-mediated endocytosis and promoting BRSV entry. Additionally, HSPA4 strengthens
  HSC70 ATPase activity to enhance the combination of ATP and HSC70, leading to the
  release of clathrin and improving the efficiency of clathrin-mediated endocytosis,
  further enhancing BRSV entry
