caption: Illustration of the input and output constraints for the genome-scale metabolic
  networks in this study. The utilized inputs in H. influenzae and H. pylori are listed
  at left. More inputs were allowed to comprise previously defined minimal medium.
  However, only the inputs listed above were utilized by the metabolic networks for
  the synthesis of the specified products. The allowed outputs are listed at right.
  The target products for H. pylori included the nonessential amino acids as well
  as the simultaneously produced set of nonessential amino acids in both E. coli and
  equimolar ratios. The target products for H. influenzae included the nonessential
  amino acids.
