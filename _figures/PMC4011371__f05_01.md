caption: Schematic diagram of extracellular immune signaling in Drosophila and Tribolium.
  Pathogens are recognized by pattern recognition patterns (PRRs) based on pathogen
  associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) present on the pathogen. PAMPS may be Lys-type
  or DAP-type peptidoglycans. The pathway can also be activated by endogenous factors
  produced in live organisms (danger signals or virulence factors). The Toll pathway
  is activated when Gram-positive bacteria are sensed by the peptidoglycan recognition
  proteins (PGRPSA). Fungal PAMPS are sensed by the glucan binding protein 3 (GNBP3).
  These PRRs are secreted proteins, and when they form complexes with appropriate
  PAMPS, they initiate the serine protease cascades in the hemolymph, culminating
  in the cleavage of pro-spaёtzle, converting it to active spaёtzle, the endogenous
  ligand of the Toll receptor. In Drosophila, a parallel protease cascade is activated
  by danger signals such as fungal and bacterial proteases and activates the Toll
  pathway via the trypsin-like serine protease known as Persephone and spaёtzle. Binding
  of spaёtzle to Toll causes a conformational change and subsequent recruitment of
  intracellular signaling molecules. Intracellular signal transduction is mediated
  by a phosphorylation cascade that culminates in the release of NF-kB-like transcription
  factors from a complex with cactus. These transcription factors activate expression
  of genes that encode for antimicrobial peptides and other effectors. High quality
  figures are available online.
