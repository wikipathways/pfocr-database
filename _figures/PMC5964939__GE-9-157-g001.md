caption: Heteromeric model of the TGF-β receptor signal transduction pathway. The
  TGF-β receptor complex is composed of two essential independent and interacting
  subunits, TβR-I and TβR-II, and an associated TβR-III. TβR-I and TβR-II are membrane-bound
  serine/threonine kinases, with an extracellular cysteine-rich ligand binding domain,
  a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain. Ligand binding
  to TβR-II results in the recruitment and phosphorylation of TβR-I and the formation
  of the heteromeric signaling complex. Intracellular signaling is mediated by the
  SMAD family of proteins. Formation of the activated TGF-β receptor complex initiates
  the recruitment and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic signaling proteins SMAD2
  or SMAD3, formation of the SMAD2/SMAD4, or SMAD3/ SMAD4 heterodimer and the subsequent
  translocation of the SMAD heterodimer to the cell nucleus. Within the cell nucleus,
  formation of the SMAD2/SMAD4/FAST-1 transcription factor complex induces transcription
  of key genes involved in TGF-β-mediated G1 cell cycle arrest.
