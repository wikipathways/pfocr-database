caption: Down-regulated genes are in green, up-regulated genes in red. Color intensity
  corresponds to the fold change; bold borders highlight genes with >2-fold change
  in expression. Lines correspond to physical interactions and arrows to functional
  relationships between proteins. Solid lines and arrows imply direct relationships
  and dotted lines and arrows imply indirect relationships. Functional relationships
  include post-translational modifications, transcription regulation, proteolysis
  or co-expression. Flat arrowheads indicate inhibition.
