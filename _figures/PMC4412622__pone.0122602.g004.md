caption: The upper panel shows gene expression patterns in the gastrolith-forming
  epithelium, while the lower panel shows gene expression patterns in the mandible
  cuticle-forming epithelium. Enzymes that were found in the transcriptomic library
  are highlighted in blue for pattern 1111, red for pattern 0110, orange for pattern
  1001, green for pattern 0111 and grey for enzymes that did not show any pattern.
  Enzymes discussed in the text are marked as I for chitin synthase, II for uridylyltransferase,
  III for chitinase, IV for chitin deacetylase, V for GlcN-6P synthase and VI for
  GlcN-6P deaminase.
