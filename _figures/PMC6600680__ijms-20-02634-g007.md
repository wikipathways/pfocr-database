caption: Mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway by JNK and p38. Activated
  JNK promotes the release of cytochrome c (Cyt C), Smac/Diablo (Smac), and HtrA2
  from mitochondria via the Bid-Bax–dependent mechanism. Cyt C initiates the activation
  of the caspase-9–dependent caspase cascade. Smac and HtrA2 inhibit inhibitor of
  apoptosis protein (IAP) and promotes apoptosis. Furthermore, JNK phosphorylates
  Bad and its sequestering partner 14–3-3 and promotes Bad-mediated neutralization
  of Bcl2 family. JNK may also phosphorylate Bcl-2 and inhibit its anti-apoptotic
  activity. Both JNK and p38 MAPK (p38) inhibit Bcl-2 by phosphorylating Bim. In addition,
  the activated JNK translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription factors.
  JNK may promote apoptosis by increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic genes.
