caption: The general pathways involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Physiological
  processes like endosomal-lysosomal autophagy, neuroinflammatory responses, mitochondrial
  homeostasis, proteostasis, and metabolic profiling (proteome and lipidome) are dysregulated
  in neurodegenerative diseases (red arrows). Alterations in homeostasis mechanisms
  like the endosomal–proteosomal–autophagy pathway and an increase in misfolded protein
  aggregation are major factors in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease
  (PD). The oxidative stress caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulation
  of endogenous antioxidant mechanisms is influenced by the level of free radicals.
  The positive feedback loop between oxidative stress, misfolded proteins, and mitochondrial
  dysfunction is crucial in therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, pre- and post-synaptic
  integrity loss due to alterations in calcium homeostasis together with the above
  pathways is an important mechanism involved in proapoptotic pathway activation.
  In addition, the remains of dead cells and the misfolded proteins released into
  the extracellular environment provoke glia-activation, which releases cytokines
  and free radicals, exacerbating neuronal death, which establishes another negative
  feedback loop between neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Finally, these alterations
  also affect neurogenesis in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD).
