caption: Purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Purine nucleotides are synthesized through
  two pathways, de novo pathway and salvage pathway. Glucose is metabolized to Ribose
  5-phosphate through the pentose phosphate pathway. Then, Ribose 5-phosphate is converted
  to PRPP, which is the first metabolite of de novo purine biosynthesis. IMP can be
  converted into both ATP and GTP by ADSS and IMPDH, respectively.
