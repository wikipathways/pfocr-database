caption: Potential mechanism of metformin‐mediated improvement of mouse oocyte apoptosis
  defects induced by arecoline. The arecoline leads to mitochondrial dysfunction by
  reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential of oocytes. On the one hand, it will
  cause a decrease in the production of ATP to reduce the energy supply, leading to
  the collapse of the oocyte cytoskeleton, which in turn causes aneuploidy, resulting
  in a deterioration in oocyte quality. On the other hand, a decrease in mitochondrial
  membrane potential causes the release of cytochrome c, which activates the caspase
  signalling pathway and ultimately leads to oocyte apoptosis. However, metformin
  could partially reduce these damages, suggesting that metformin has a protective
  effect against the apoptosis of oocytes induced by arecoline
