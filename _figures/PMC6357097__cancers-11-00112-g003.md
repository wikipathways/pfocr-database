caption: The interplay among hypoxia, ROS and radiation, and strategies to overcome
  hypoxic radioresistance. Radiotherapy kills cancer cells by causing DNA damage via
  generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, under hypoxic condition, hypoxia
  induces HIF-1α accumulation by (1) prevention of protein degradation, or (2) upregulation
  of gene expression via ROS mediated pathways. As a result of increased HIF-1α, HIF-1
  is activated and regulates more than a hundred of genes, conferring radioresistance
  by acting upon multiple mechanisms at different levels. For example, HIF-1 enhances
  expression of genes implicated in antioxidant defense systems, resulting in increased
  capacity to buffer ROS and radioresistance. In addition, hypoxia and radiation induced
  ROS could trigger a feedback loop that is in favor of generation of antioxidant.
  To counteract hypoxic radioresistance, historically, hyperbaric oxygen, and oxygen
  mimetic radiosensitizers have been explored, but failed in implementing in clinical
  practice due to their inconvenient application or side effects. Given ROS are the
  primary effector molecules of radiation, and hypoxic tumor cells strongly dependent
  on antioxidant defense systems to sustain ROS homeostasis, exposure of ROS insults
  to hypoxic tumor cells or perturbation of ROS adaptation pathway may lead to selective
  cytotoxicity and radiosensitization. In respect of this, approaches such as inhibition
  of HIF-1, suppression of antioxidant enzymes, and NO donors are under active investigation.
  The radiosensitizing approaches are indicated in red frames.
