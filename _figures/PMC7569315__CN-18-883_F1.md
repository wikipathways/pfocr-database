caption: Beta-amyloid treatment strategies at various levels of its maturation. The
  non-amyloidogenic pathway results in the sequential cleavage of transmembrane Amyloid
  Precursor Protein (APP) by the enzymes α-secretase and γ-secretase resulting in
  soluble APPα fragment, P83 fragment (proteolytically degraded at later stages) and
  APP Intracellular Domain fragment (AICD). In amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first
  processed by β-secretase, releasing soluble APPβ, followed by γ-secretase which
  cleaves the remaining fragment generating either Aβ1-40 or Aβ1-42, the length of
  which is determined by the site at which γ-secretase cuts. These Aβ monomers assemble
  together in series of steps, forming dimers to cytotoxic oligomers, developing into
  protofibrils and mature fibrils. (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure
  is available in the electronic copy of the article).
