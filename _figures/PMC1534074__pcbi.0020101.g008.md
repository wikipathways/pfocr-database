caption: The expression (i.e., functional) states for two different environments,
  as generated by extreme pathway analysis of R*, are presented.(A) The expression
  states for the environment in which all metabolites are present are shown. In this
  environment, a total of 42 extreme pathways exist leading to the activation or inactivation
  of the genes within the TRS.(B) The expression states for the environment in which
  all metabolites are absent are shown. In this environment, a total of 62 extreme
  pathways exist leading to the activation or inactivation of the genes within the
  TRS. As a legend, triangles represent extracellular cues, namely the six metabolites;
  squares represent the genes; and circles represent the protein products. Gray elements
  denote inactivity, whereas colored elements denote active components of the TRS
  for the given environment. Green arrows indicate that an upstream metabolite or
  transcription factor activates gene expression, whereas red lines indicate that
  the upstream metabolite or transcription factor inhibits gene expression. Lines
  that join together at dots denote “and” relationships within the Boolean regulatory
  rules, whereas lines that simply join together denote “or” relationships within
  the Boolean regulatory rules.
