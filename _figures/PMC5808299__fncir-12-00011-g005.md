caption: Working models of orientation-selective retinal circuits in vertebrate retinae.
  (A) Proposed circuit diagrams underlying the firing selectivity of different OSGC
  types in rabbit (left), mouse (middle), and zebrafish (right). Photoreceptors are
  represented in yellow; bipolar cells (BCs) in green; amacrine cells (ACs) in blue;
  and ganglion cells (GCs) in red. Cell numbering is used to relate each cell type
  with the corresponding tuning profile shown in (B) below. Excitatory synapses are
  indicated by ‘+’ symbols (full circles), whereas inhibitory synapses are indicated
  by ‘–’ (empty circles). Electrical synapses between mouse OFF orientation-selective
  amacrine cells (AC1) and OFF OSGCs are indicated by the jagged line. Potential but
  speculative connectivity between AC1 and BC terminals in larval zebrafish is represented
  by the dashed blue line. (B) Response profiles of the cell types represented in
  A to oriented visual stimuli. ‘+’ and ‘–’ symbols indicate along which axes excitatory
  (+, green) and inhibitory (–, blue) inputs contribute to the tuning of each cell
  type. The neurotransmitter identities of the various amacrine cell types are also
  reported (question marks indicate predicted neurotransmitter identities). GABA,
  gamma-aminobutyric acid. Tonic inputs are specified in small gray writings. Unless
  specifically indicated in small gray writings, the response polarity of the various
  cell types is the same as that of the respective downstream OSGC. In rabbit and
  zebrafish circuits, orientation selectivity is proposed to originate from orientation-selective
  GABAergic amacrine cells (AC1), which subsequently generate tuned responses in downstream
  amacrine, bipolar and/or ganglion cells through inhibitory synapses. In the mouse
  OFF circuit, AC1 amacrine cells convey orientation selectivity to OFF OSGCs by electrical
  coupling through gap junctions. Rabbit ON horizontal OSGCs possess two horizontally
  oriented flanking subfields generated by tonically active amacrine cells (AC3),
  which are predicted to invert the ON pathway signal by disinhibiting center bipolar
  cells (BC1) and, therefore, render negative contrast stimuli in the flanking subfields
  excitatory (dashed box).
