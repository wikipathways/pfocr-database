caption: The receptor pathways in the liver. The activation of NLRs by PAMPs activates
  NLRP3 inflammasome, thus promoting caspase-1 cleavage as well as IL-1β secretion.
  TLR4 expressed on HSCs, Kupffer cells and hepatocytes enhances inflammatory chemokines
  and cytokines secretion by activating IRF3, MAPK and NF-kB. Moreover, LPS also stimulates
  TLR4 on macrophages to initiate RIP3 signaling pathway, thus mediating macrophage/monocyte
  activation, and promoting the secretion of IL-6. Furthermore, the activation of
  TLR9 in immune cells by bacterial DNA activates NF-kB/MAPK signaling axis, and with
  it the secretion of IL-12 and TNF-α. Ah R ligand, derived from translocated Enterococcus
  gallinarum, activates AhR-CYP1A1 signaling pathway, thus inducing the production
  of Th17 cells and TFH cells. The decrease of secondary bile acids attenuates GPBAR1-IL10
  axis, and with it, the decrease of NKT10 cells and IL10. PAMPs, pathogen associated
  molecular patterns; NLRs, NOD-like receptors; NLRP3, NOD-like receptor protein 3;
  IL-1β, interleukin-1β; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR4/9, Toll-like receptor 4/9;

  nuclear factor kappa B; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TRAM, TRIF-related
  adapter molecule; TRIF, TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β; RIP3, receptor-interacting
  protein kinase 3; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; Ah R, aryl hydrocarbon receptor;
