caption: 'Membrane potential can be differentially and dynamically regulated through
  K+ channel activity and TRPM4/TRPM5 monovalent cation channel activityTop panel:
  In resting cells, membrane potential is set at a highly negative potential through
  the activity of voltage–operated K+ channels. The negative membrane potential is
  generated through the outward movement of positively charged K+ ions, leaving unpaired
  intracellular negative charges (not shown). TRPM4/TRPM5 channels are thought to
  be closed in resting cells.Middle panel: When a cell stimulus leads to activation
  of the store-operated Ca2+entry (SOCE) pathway, opening of highly Ca2+-selective
  CRAC channels allows Ca2+ to pass across the plasma membrae. The current carried
  by CRAC channels is very small, and thus the entering positively charged Ca2+ ions
  have little direct influence on the membrane potential. However, the rise in cytosolic
  Ca2+ resulting from CRAC channel opening may influence the gating of both Ca2+-activated
  K+ channels and TRPM4/TRPM5 channels.Bottom left panel: In cells expressing significant
  numbers of Ca2+-activated K+ channels, their activation serves to maintain a highly
  negative membrane potential. Thus, the cell maintains a strong sustained driving
  force for Ca2+ entry and a large magnitude sustained Ca2+ signal results.Bottom
  right panel: In cells expressing significant numbers of TRPM4/TRPM5 monovalent cation
  channels, their activation allows Na+ entry, thus providing cytosolic positive ions
  to neutralize the unpaired internal charges. This diminishes the negative membrane
  potential, thereby attenuating the driving force for Ca2+ entry, and resulting in
  a reduced magnitude Ca2+ signal.Beyond Ca2+-dependent activation of K+ and TRPM4/TRPM5
  channels, the activity of these channels is variously accessible to receptor mediated
  stimuli, metabolic mediators, and environmental influences that modulate their gating
  properties, providing multiple mechanisms through which dynamic regulation of membrane
  potential could influence B-cell Ca2+signaling.'
