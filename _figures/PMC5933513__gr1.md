caption: 'Schematic representation of the Drosophila escape response pathway. The
  GFS consists of two descending giant fiber (GF) interneurons that originate in the
  brain, and downstream neurons and muscles. In the thoracic region, the GFs form
  mixed (chemical and electrical) synapses with the peripherally synapsing interneuron
  (PSI), which in turn forms cholinergic synapses with the motoneuron (DLMn) innervating
  dorsal longitudinal flight muscles. The GFs also directly connect (via mixed synapses)
  with the TTMn, the motoneuron that innervates the tergo-trochanteral, or jump, muscle.
  Electrical brain stimulation (green lightning bolt) activates the giant fiber interneurons,
  and the two output pathways can be monitored by recording from the two muscles (depolarization
  spikes). Abbreviations: GFS, giant fiber system; DLM, dorsal longitudinal muscle;
  TTM, tergo-trochanteral muscle. (For interpretation of the references to color in
  this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
