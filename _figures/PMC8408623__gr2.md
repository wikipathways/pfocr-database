caption: A plasma jet generating several types of ROS/RNS simultaneously and their
  emittance to the surrounding. The highest concentration of ROS/RNS is within and
  close to the plasma plume. Among those species generated are, for instance, nitric
  oxide (NO), peroxynitrite (ONOO−), atomic oxygen (O), singlet oxygen (O2 (1Δ)),
  superoxide anion (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ozone, hydroxyl radicals (OH),
  nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and others. Dimensions are not accurate to scale. Chronic
  wounds failed to heal. Gas plasma treatment targets chronic wounds and leads to
  biological consequences during wound healing, including redox signaling, inflammation,
  tissue regeneration, and protection. In preclinical studies, accelerated healing
  was associated with improved re-epithelization, angiogenesis, collagen fiber, keratin
  production, and granulation. Other beneficial effects were observed, including macrophage
  and neutrophil immigration, chemokine and cytokine release, antioxidant signaling
  (Nrf2 pathway activation), and proliferative along with wound healing stage-dependent
  apoptotic (p53 signaling) responses. Created with BioRender.com.
