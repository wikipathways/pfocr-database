caption: Some of the potential downstream molecules activated by the Raf/MEK/ERK,
  PI3K/Akt and p53 and their effects on the induction of apoptosis are illustrated.
  The effects of Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt on phosphorylation of apoptotic regulatory
  molecules which exert their effects on mitochondrial membrane potential and the
  prevention of apoptosis are indicated. Phosphorylation of these molecules by Raf/MEK/ERK
  and PI3K/Akt is associated with prevention of the caspase cascade and the induction
  of apoptosis. Activation of p53 by genotoxic stresses can result in the activation
  of PUMA and NOXA which can have pro-apoptotic effects. Activation of p53 can also
  result in transcription of hbEGF which would be predicted to have growth stimulatory
  effects. Drug resistance can result from Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways disrupting
  the balance between induction and prevention of apoptosis.
