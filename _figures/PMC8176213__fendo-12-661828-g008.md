caption: Summary of the mechanism by which ET-3 differs from ET-1 to regulate the
  growth of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. ET-3 signalling to induce preadipocyte growth is
  mediated through the AMPK, JNK/c-JUN, JAK2/STAT3, SphK, SMase2, and ETAR pathways.
  Compared with the growth signal of ET-1 in preadipocytes, the signal transduction
  of ET-3 is independent of the PKC pathway.
