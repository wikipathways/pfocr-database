caption: Synthesis scheme of FA-97. FA-97 (caffeic acid phenethyl ester 4-O-glucoside,
  C23H26O9, MW = 446.16 g/mol) was synthesized via the coupling reaction between a
  acetyl protected brominated D-glucose and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) starting
  from commercially available caffeic acid. Reagents and conditions of each chemical
  step are shown in the left bottom of the figure.
