caption: The general interplay between the canonical TLR signaling pathway, the cytokine-mediated
  DNA repair feedback loop, and the growth factors-mediated signaling pathway. There
  are three main TLR-mediated pathways of DNA repair. The protein encoded by myeloid
  differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and its downstream signaling proteins
  (not shown) may inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3), which
  hinders phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and therefore,
  prevents further signaling via Ras-MAPK pathway. In addition, MyD88 and its downstream
  signaling proteins (not shown) along with pERK activate AP-1 transcription factor,
  which promotes transcription of certain DNA repair genes. Finally, IL-12 and IL-23,
  which enhance DNA repair and whose transcription is also amplified by MyD88-regulated
  transcription factors, bind to their receptors, activate Janus kinase-signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway, and increase further
  transcription of their own encoding genes.
