caption: Metabolic pathway of Sia and EV-D usage. (A) EV-D70 binds only to Sia α2,3,
  while EV-D94 uses both isoforms. EV-D68 has a strong preference for Sia α2,6, but
  is also able to bind to Sia α2,3 with less affinity. (B) These isoform preferences
  correlate with the tropism of these different viruses. (C) These Sias are produced
  by a metabolic pathway involving various key enzymes. GNE catalyses the first step
  in Sia biosynthesis. Sia is then activated thanks to the action of CMAS (cytidine
  monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase) by coupling it with a cytidine
  monophosphate (CMP), producing a CMP-sialic acid. This substrate is then transported
  to the Golgi apparatus and used by two types of sialyltransferases, ST3GAL1-6 and
  ST6GAL1-2. Each family proceeds to the sialylation of glycoproteins and produces,
  respectively, the two major isoforms, Sia α2,3 and Sia α2,6. The glycoconjugates
  are then exported to the cell surface. Sias can be removed from the surface of the
  cell thanks to exogenous neuraminidase targeting either a specific isoform (α2,3
  NA; third tool; circled number 3) or all sialylated glycoconjugates (α2,3-6-8 NA;
  first tool; circled number 1). It is also possible to inhibit the production of
  these glycoconjugates by targeting key enzymes in the Sia biosynthesis pathway,
  in particular CMAS (second tool; circled number 2). The figure was created with
