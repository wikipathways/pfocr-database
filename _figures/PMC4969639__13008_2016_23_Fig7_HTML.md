caption: Proposed model for IFNγ-induced apoptosis of HNSCC cells. The activation
  of IFNγ receptor of HNSCC cells with IFNγ results in the activation of JAK-STAT
  pathway that subsequently enhances the DNA binding activity of the transcription
  factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) that is essential for the induction
  IDO expression. The increased level of IDO results in the suppression of the anti-oxidant
  protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) that, in turn, leads to the accumulation of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). The increased accumulation of ROS mediates oxidative stress-associated
  pathways such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1(ASK1)/c-Jun-N-terminal kinase
  (JNK)-AP-1/p53, IKK-NF-κB, and p38-ATF-2. The formation of a transcriptional complex
  from the transcription factors NF-κB, AP-1 and p53 results in the transcriptional
  activation of the promoter of Noxa protein. The localization of Noxa protein to
  mitochondria results in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) that
  is characterized by the release of cytochrome c (Cyt.C) into the cytoplasm where
  it initiates apoptosis by formation of apoptosome complex leading to the cleavage
  of caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP. Whereas the localization of Noxa to endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) results in ER-stress that is associated with the activation of the
  protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring-1α
  (IRE1α) pathways as well as cleavage of caspase-4 that, in turn, mediates the cleavage
  of caspase-3
