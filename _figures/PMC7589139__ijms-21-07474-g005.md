caption: Schematic illustration of the proposed molecular mechanism of glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in human aortic endothelium and monocytes. Metabolic
  insults (treatment with high glucose or palmitate) or G6PD gene mutations can cause
  G6PD deficiency. One possible mechanism is that G6PD deficiency decreases glutathione
  (GSH) and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may activate transforming
  growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) signaling and NADPH oxidases (NOX). Activation of these
  factors generates excess oxidative stress, induces cytokines (TNF and MCP-1), upregulates
  cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), and favors monocyte-endothelial cell
  adhesion. Supplementation with L-cysteine (a GSH precursor) or ablation of the TGF-β
  signaling complex and NOX by inhibitors abolishes excess oxidative stress and inhibits
  monocyte-endothelial adhesion in G6PD-deficient cells. The key findings in our study
  demonstrate that G6PD deficiency plays an essential role in the initiation of a
  cardiovascular disease event via the TGF-β/NADPH oxidases/ROS signaling pathway.
