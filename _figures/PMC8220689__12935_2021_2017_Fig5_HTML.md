caption: CircRNAs in Wnt pathway. Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway plays a critical role in cancer
  progression. There are 4 circRNAs (circβ-catenin, hsa_circ_000984, circRNA_102171,
  and circ_001569) that are significantly upregulated and 3 circRNAs (cir-ITCH/miR-17,
  hsa_circ_009361/ miR-582, and circ-ITCH/miR-214) that are downregulated. Their functions
  in regulating Wnt pathway are indicated in the figure
