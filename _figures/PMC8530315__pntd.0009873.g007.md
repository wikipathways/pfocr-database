caption: (A) VitD3 can be found as inactive form 25(OH)2D2 (calcidiol), as active
  form 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), or be converted from inactive to active form within
  the cell by the action of CYP7B1. VitD3 interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR)
  present in the nuclei and associates then, with the nuclear receptor retinoid X
  receptor (RXR). Together, they act as transcription factors that will increase the
  expression of genes that have vitamin D response elements (VDRE) [,]. Genomic effects
  of VitD3 during DENV-2 infection include decreased expression of IL-6, TNF-α, RIG-I,
  TLR3, TLR7 and decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since ROS
  can induce mitochondrial damage and then increase activation and expression of TLR9
  [], VitD3 reduced TLR9 expression indirectly. (B) As a non-genomic effect, VitD3
  can bind to VDR that is initially bound to STAT1 [], and indirectly enhance the
  activity of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and IFN-I activity, thus increasing expression
  of PKR and OAS1.
