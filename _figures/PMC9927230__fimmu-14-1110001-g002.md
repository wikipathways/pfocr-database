caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of vaginal microbiota shaping via the vagina-gut axis.
  Many factors, such as age, ethnicity, menstrual cycle, lifestyle, immune system,
  infection, and probiotics, are known to affect the composition of the vaginal microbiota.
  However, why the human vaginal microbiota is often dominated by a single or a few
  strains of Lactobacillus is still unknown. Tolerance and promotion of Lactobacillus
  dominance in the vagina might be regulated via the vagina-gut axis. Immunization
  with Lactobacillus might occur both in the vagina and the gut. The collection of
  microorganisms that can metabolize estrogens (coined the estrobolome) can deconjugate
  hepatically conjugated estrogens in the gastrointestinal tract. Deconjugated estrogen
  is then reabsorbed to the systemic circulation. Circulating estrogen will affect
  the distal epithelia of the vagina, resulting in glycogen and mucus production.
  Then, increased glycogen supports Lactobacillus dominance in the vagina because
  glycogen can serve as an energy source for lactobacilli. AMPs: antimicrobial peptides
  and proteins. The established pathways are represented by solid lines. The proposed
  mechanisms are represented by dotted lines. The estrobolome-driven pathway is represented
  by green lines.'
