caption: Schematic model of the autophagic pathway. The process starts with activation
  of the ULK1 complex, then activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which
  forms a complex with Beclin 1 after it dissociates from lymphoma B cell 2 (BCL-2).
  Thus, the complex formed activates several proteins of the autophagic family (ATGs),
  which participate in the elongation of the phagophore and activation of the LC3-I
  protein (light chain 3 of protein 1 associated with microtubules), forming LC3-II,
  responsible for closing the phagophore and interacting with the p62 protein, signaling
  the material to be degraded. The phagophore matures into the autophagosome, which
  fuses with the lysosome forming the autolysosome, in which lysosomal enzymes will
  then degrade the sequestered material.
