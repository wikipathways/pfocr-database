caption: 'HCQ interference in the T-cell activation pathway and transcription of CD
  154: When T-cell receptor (TCR) is stimulated by antigen via MHC, a series of events
  leads to the activation of the Phospholipase C, which then generates Inositol triphosphate
  (IP3). IP3 induces the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Calcium
  acts as a secondary messenger to activate Calcium-release-activated Calcium channel
  (CRAC) for a steady influx of extracellular calcium. Intracellular calcium binds
  to calmodulin and activates the phosphatase calcineurin (not shown in the diagram).
  Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates transcription factor NFATc2. NFATc2 migrates
  the nucleus and triggers the transcription of NFATc1. NFATc1 mRNA is exported outside
  the nucleus where de novo synthesis of transcription factor NFATc1 occurs. NFATc1
  then migrates back into the nucleus to triggers the transcription of CD 154. HCQ
  can potentially interfere with intracellular calcium signaling and prevent dephosphorylation
  and activation of the transcription factor NFAT. This is one of the mechanisms by
  which HCQ interfere in T-cell activation and CD 154 transcription'
