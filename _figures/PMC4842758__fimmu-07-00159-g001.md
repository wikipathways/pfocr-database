caption: Immune activation by HSP-based anticancer vaccines. The HSP–peptide complexes
  that comprise the anticancer vaccine are shown to interact with APC after vaccination
  of host. The vaccines can efficiently (1) cause cross-presentation of tumor antigen
  and, thus, prime CD8+ T lymphocytes as well as activating CD4+ T cells through the
  (2) class II pathway. However, many investigations suggest that HSPs may not have
  major effects on (3) inflammatory signaling and may require combination with agents
  with adjuvant activity or inflammatory cell killing. Gray spheres indicate nuclei.
