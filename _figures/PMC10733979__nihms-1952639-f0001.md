caption: 'Overview of key cellular metabolic pathways in which NAD(P)H and FAD are
  involved, including glycolysis, the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty
  acid oxidation and synthesis, and the glutathione pathway. Important shuttles such
  as the G3P, A-M, and I-α-KG shuttles, responsible for maintaining distinct redox
  states in the mitochondria and the cytosol, are also included. Abbreviations: A-M,
  aspartate–malate; CoA, coenzyme A; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  GSH, glutathione; I-α-KG, isocitrate-α-ketoglutarate; NAD+, nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide; NADH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADP+, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADPH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid. Illustration created by Adriana Sanchez Hernandez,
