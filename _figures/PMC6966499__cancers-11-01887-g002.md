caption: Mechanisms of cell death induced by free PS and photoimmunoconjugates (PICs).
  PICs bind to the corresponding receptor on the cell surface and are internalized
  through a receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway. The endocytosed PICs are sorted
  to the lysosome where they are cleaved, and the PS is released. Certain PSs diffuse
  through the cell membrane and localize to subcellular organelles, such as mitochondria.
  Depending on the PS formulation, the cells may undergo either lysosomal photodamage
  or mitochondrial photodamage leading to apoptosis/necrosis. Adapted from Nath et
  al. (2019) [].
