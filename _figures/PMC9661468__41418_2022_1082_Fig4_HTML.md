caption: DNA damage or other mitotic stresses can lead to defects in mitosis, including
  chromosomal instability and micronuclei. These issues are detected by various surveillance
  mechanisms to prevent the propagation of potentially mutated or otherwise harmful
  cells. Micronuclei or cytoplasmic chromatin fragments are detected by the cGAS-STING
  pathway, leading to the activation of type I interferon, NF-κB signaling, and subsequently
  inflammation, but also metastasis or cell death. Supernumerary centrosomes promote
  the activation of the PIDDosome, which cleaves and inhibits MDM2. Therefore, p53
  is stabilized and can promote apoptosis, cell cycle arrest or senescence. Mitotic
  stress also shifts the balance of pro-survival BCL-2 proteins and proapoptotic BH3-only
  proteins to promote apoptosis.
