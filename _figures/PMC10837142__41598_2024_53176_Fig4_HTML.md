caption: Benzyl iso-quinoline alkaloid biosynthesis pathway in T. cordifolia. This
  pathway indicates the genes involved in biosynthesis of alkaloids like berberine,
  magnoflorine, palmatine, and tembetarine. It includes tyrosine aminotransferase
  (TAT), Hydroxyphenylpyruvate decarboxylase, Tyrosine decarboxylase (TYDC), Tyrosinase/Phenolase
  (TYR/3OHase), (S)-Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS), Norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase
  (NoMT), (S)-Coclaurine N-methyltransferase (CNMT), N-Methylcoclaurine 3'-hydroxylase
  (NMCH), 3'-Hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine 4' -O-methyltransferase (4OMT), Corytuberine
  synthase (CTS), (S)-Corytuberine-N-methyltransferase (SCNMT/RNMT), Berberine bridge
  enzyme (BBE), S)-Scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase (SOMT/SMT), (S)-Tetrahydroprotoberberine
  oxidase (STOX), Columbamine O-methyltransferase (CoOMT), and (S)-Canadine synthase
