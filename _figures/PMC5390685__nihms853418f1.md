caption: 'Lipid Kinase Activity: PI3Ks are classically well known for this lipid kinase
  activity. Cytosolic PI3K is recruited to the plasma membrane following an extracellular
  signal that could range from growth factors like insulin, epidermal growth factor
  (EGF) to hormones like epinephrine, norepinephrine which are G-protein coupled receptor
  agonists. Class I PI3Ks will use the phosphoinositide 4,5-bis-phosphate (PtdIns
  (4,5)P2 or PIP2), a component of inner leaflet of the plasma membrane as a substrate
  to generate D-3 phosphorylated PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) products. These D-3 phosphoinositides
  activate multiple downstream signaling pathways including the well known anti-apoptotic
  pathway of phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) - protein kinase B (Akt) axis.
