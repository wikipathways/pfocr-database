caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanisms underpinning skeletal muscle hypertrophy
  response to RET. After mechanical stimuli, phospholipase Cγ1 colocalizes around
  FAK and catalyzes the conversion of Ptdlns(4,5)P2 to PA that activates the HIPPO
  pathway (YAP and TAZ). YAP and TAZ promote the mTOR signaling pathway via the suppression
  of PTEN, regulate SC activation, and mediate the expression of L-type amino acid
  transporter 1 (LAT1). Interaction between Filamin-C and Bag3 increases the activation
  of the HIPPO pathway. Translational capacity and efficacy via ribosome are essential
  determinants for muscle hypertrophy. Besides increased gene expression during RE,
  the UTR of mRNA is regulated and closely correlated with muscle growth. The AR content
  is associated with RET-induced hypertrophy, whereas RE-induced acute changes in
  serum testosterone show no association with muscle growth. In human trials, RE-induced
  increased CK and inflammation factors have no effects on muscle hypertrophy. However,
  RET reduces resting concentration of inflammation cytokines in aging and clinical
  illness. AR, androgen receptor; ECM, extracellular matrix; FAK, focal adhesion kinase;
