caption: The closed-loop control structure of a metabolic network subject to metabolic
  and gene-expression regulation. The substrate or allosteric effects correspond to
  proportional or nonlinear controls that are often modelled together with the dynamics
  of the metabolic process. The gene-expression regulation can be described as a (quasi-)
  integral control, since protein synthesis requires time integration. The transcription
  process or the transcription factor can be regarded as a sensor of the control system.
  The metabolite concentration X is the output of the system and is the controlled
  dependent variable. Reaction rates v(X, E) are functions of both enzyme concentration
  E and metabolic process f(x). Here, the integral control input q is a function of
  the controlled dependent variable and a reference signal r. q compares the level
  of X with the level of r and differences between the two are time integrated and
  translated into alterations into altered enzyme levels, which then feed into the
  metabolic pathway. (Online version in colour.)
