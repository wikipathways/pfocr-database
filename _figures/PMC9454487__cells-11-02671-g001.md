caption: 'TGF-β signaling and its main roles in cancer progression and in cachexia:
  Canonical SMAD-dependent pathway: in proximal and distal skeletal muscles, SMAD3
  signaling pathway results in the oxidation and nitrosylation of ryanodine receptor
  1 (RyR1), which, in turn, reduces Ca2+ channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and
  causes muscle weakness; furthermore, SMAD3 induces the transcription of Nox4 gene
  increasing the production of ROS that oxidize RyR1. Non-canonical JNK/p38 MAPK signaling
  pathway affects EMT in many tissues promoting cancer growth; c. TGF-β/SMAD3 pathway
  leads to an increase in fibrosis in the subcutaneous adipose tissue.'
