caption: A model proposing controls of the shikimate pathway.PhyB exerts control over
  the pathway by changing its active and non-active, Pfr and Pr, conformations according
  to the light quality (R:FR). The R:FR increases gradually from the onset of light
  till midday and decreases towards evening. Expression of DAHPS1 and SK1 is repressed
  by the circadian component CCA1 during the day, while phyB (Pfr) promotes the accumulation
  of DHQS and EPSPS1 in response to high R:FR through the interaction with PIF4 and
  PIF5. During the evening, EC elements have a role in stabilizing PIF4 and PIF5.
  Arrows and blunt end lines indicate stimulatory and inhibitory effects respectively,
  and dashed arrows indicate transcriptional activation. The proposed feed-back regulation
  of the circadian clock and EC-dependent regulation are shown as embossed arrows.
