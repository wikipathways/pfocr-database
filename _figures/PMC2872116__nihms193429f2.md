caption: 'Structuring protein interactions around familiar canonical pathways provides
  intuitive visualizations. A canonical signaling pathway representation (top) can
  be imported into the system in two ways: on the lower left the pathway image itself
  is loaded into the system and preprocessed by circling proteins and drawing over
  interactions; the pathway features are then inferred from the user strokes and image
  features and shown here in black; or, on the lower right, protein and interaction
  icons are placed and dragged on an empty canvas to create a new pathway model. After
  positional assignment of each protein, the software aids in associating interaction
  database accession numbers to each of the newly defined canonical pathway proteins.'
