caption: Strategy of non-coding RNA regulating apoptosis pathway in M. tuberculosis
  infected cells. (A) MiR-155 and miR223 inhibit apoptosis by targeting FOXO3, miR-1281
  inhibited apoptosis by targeting cyclophilin-d, miRNA-143 and miRNA-365 inhibit
  apoptosis by differentially targeting c-Maf, Bach-1, and Elmo-1. MiR-20a-5p negatively
  modulating Bim expression in a JNK2-dependent manner. MiR-125b-5p target DRAM2 to
  promot apoptosis, miR-325-3p targets LNX1 (the E3 ubiquitin ligase of NEK6), leading
  to abnormal accumulation of NEK6, which in turn activates the STAT3 signaling pathway.
  At the same time, potential ceRNAs are also flagged here. lincRNA-EPS inhibited
  apoptosis and enhanced autophagy by activating the JNK/MAPK signaling pathway. PCED1B-AS1
  can directly bind to miR-155 to reduce the rate of apoptosis. LncRNA MEG3 can control
  miR-145-5p expression and regulate macrophage proliferation. The mechanism of action
  of ceRNA needs to be further studied and verified. (B) The apoptotic cells present
  antigen to DCs to trigger T-cell immunity. MiR-381-3p mediate the reduction of CD1c
  expression, thereby inhibiting T cell immune responses to M. tuberculosis. MiR-21
  promotes the apoptosis of DCs by targeting Bcl-2, and inhibits IL-12 production
  by targeting IL-12p35, weakening the T-cell response to M. tuberculosis.  Direct
  stimulatory modification;  Direct inhibitory modification;  Tentative stimulatory
  modification;  Tentative inhibitory modification.
