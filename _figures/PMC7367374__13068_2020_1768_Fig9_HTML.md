caption: A hypothetical model for underlying mechanism of TAG and astaxanthin hyperaccumulation
  under SS stress. The red color of boxes and genes indicates up-regulation. The orange
  box represents TAG and astaxanthin biosynthesis pathway. OPP pathway, oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway; 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate
  1-dehydrogenase; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle; GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  FA, fatty acid; PK, pyruvate kinase; PDHC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PAP,
  phosphatidate phosphatase; DGAT, Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase, type I; DGTT,
  Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase, type II; LCYb, lycopene beta cyclase; BKT, beta-carotene
  ketolase; MLDP, major lipid droplet protein
