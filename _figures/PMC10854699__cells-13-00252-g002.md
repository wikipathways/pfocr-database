caption: 'Cachexia-related pathways in skeletal muscle: The mTOR (mechanistic Target
  of Rapamycin) signaling pathway, which is initiated by activated Akt and inhibits
  the phosphorylation of FoxO, facilitates the process of protein synthesis. The pathways
  involved in atrophy encompass the myostatin/Activin ligands, which exert their effects
  through the ACTRII receptor and SMAD 2,3. These ligands impede protein synthesis
  mediated by Akt and inhibit MyoD and myogenin (genes associated with muscle differentiation).
  SMAD 2,3 signaling can also become activated by Activin A which is induced by IL-1
  and TNF- α). Abbreviations: PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase), PIP2 (phosphoinositide-4,
  5-biphosphate), PIP3 (phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate)'
