caption: 'Mechanisms of pathogenesis of inborn errors of SL metabolism. A: Overaccumulation
  of toxic lipids. In HNAS1, mutations in either the SPTLC1 or SPTLC2 subunit of SPT
  increase utilization of alanine or glycine at the expense of serine for the increased
  production of deoxysphingosine. The deoxysphingosine can only proceed to deoxyceramide
  formation and cannot move farther down the pathway for complex sphingolipid synthesis
  or through the canonical degradation sphingolipid pathway. Accumulation of toxic
  deoxy-SLs result. SS: small subunit of SPT, SPTSSA. B: Overaccumulation of bioactive
  lipids. Mutations in S1P lyase cause nephrotic syndrome type 14 and block the only
  exit for sphingolipid substrate out of the SL metabolic pathway. As a consequence,
  S1P accumulates and some S1P is converted to sphingosine and ceramide, increasing
  levels of S1P, sphingosine, and ceramide. Each of these SLs is bioactive: excess
  S1P activates S1P receptors and sphingosine and ceramide trigger pathways causing
  apoptosis. In patients with SGPL1 deficiency, these SL alterations may contribute
  to the multisystemic manifestations in the disease (). The elevated circulating
  and tissue S1P levels may alter S1P receptor signaling to impair lymphocyte trafficking
  and cause immunodeficiency. Elevated levels of pro-apoptotic sphingosine and ceramide
  may contribute to neurologic symptoms. C: Disruption of a critical physiologic process.
  Establishment of the epidermal permeability barrier, which is essential for life,
  is critically dependent on the synthesis and metabolism of SLs. 3-Ketosphinganine
  reductase (KDSR) forms dihydrosphingosine and ceramide synthase 3 (CERS3), which
  is highly abundant in the epidermis, produces ceramide with very-long chain ω -hydroxy
  fatty acids, which are then acylated with linoleic acid to form acyl-ceramide. Glucosylation
  of acyl-ceramide by glucosylceramide transferase (UGCG) is believed to be required
  for the intracellular transport of lipids as lamellar bodies for secretion into
  the extracellular space at the stratum corneum. The secreted acyl-GlcCeramide is
  processed by glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) for proper formation of lipid lamellae and
  protein-bound ceramide in the stratum corneum to produce an intact permeability
  barrier. Biallelic mutations in each of the KDSR, CERS3, UGCG, or GBA1 genes cause
  forms of epidermal permeability barrier abnormalities. D: Disruption of a critical
  cellular process. Lysosomal sphingolipid accumulation in Sandhoff (HEXB) and Gaucher
  (GBA1) diseases blocks autophagy, which is a critical self-degradative process for
  the removal of damaged organelles and aggregated proteins. An autophagy defect results
  in the cellular accumulation of damaged organelles and aggregated proteins and inflammation,
  which can lead to cellular dysfunction and apoptosis. Heterozygous mutations in
  GBA1 increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease by possibly causing lysosome/autophagy
  dysfunction (). Oligosaccharide structures are illustrated by colored symbols. Substrate
  names are presented in gray rounded boxes, genes are presented in green text, and
  disorders are presented in boxed red arrows. An asterisk identifies a disease predisposition
  associated with a gene variant. 1 Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma. 2 Autosomal
  recessive congenital ichthyosis.'
