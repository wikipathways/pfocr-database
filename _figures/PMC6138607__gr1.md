caption: How Reactive Oxygen Species contribute to insulin resistance. ROS contributes
  to insulin resistance by promoting the translocation of GLUT4 to lysosomes, as well
  as inducing various cellular stress pathway. This figure was kindly provided by
  Hurrle and Hsu  and the signalling pathways involved are described further in their
  review.
