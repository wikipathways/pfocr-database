caption: The germinal center (GC) pathway for the generation of autoreactive plasma
  cells (PCs) in systemic lupus erythematosus. Shown here are the potential mechanisms
  that can contribute to enhanced PC differentiation during GC responses. These include
  (1) loss of follicular exclusion, which can lead to recruitment of autoreactive
  B cells into GC responses; (2) B cell hyperresponsiveness which can affect the activation
  of follicular B cells; (3) increased Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which can
  affect initial activation of B cells as well as the GC response itself; (4) de novo
  autoreactivity, generated through somatic hypermutation (SHM) and leading to the
  generation of autoreactive GC B cells from non-autoreactive precursors; (5) aberrant
  selection and survival, which can diminish tolerance mechanisms; (6) increased T
  follicular helper (Tfh) activity, which can increase the extent of GC responses
  as well as PC differentiation; (7) cell fate decisions that increase PC differentiation;
  and (8) increased PC survival.
