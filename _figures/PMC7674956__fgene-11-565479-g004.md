caption: Comparison of the proteomics analysis by KEGG pathway and PPI network analysis.
  (A) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis (the top 15
  proteins with the greatest fold enrichment are shown). Dot plots of enriched KEGG
  pathways in differential proteins. The x axis shows the fold enrichment of each
  KEGG pathway, whereas the color denotes the P-value and the area of the dots represents
  the number of genes assigned to each KEGG pathway. The y axis displays KEGG pathway
  term. (B) PPI analysis showed the differential proteins are involved in different
  network. Red indicated upregulated genes, and green indicated downregulated genes
  in the present study.
