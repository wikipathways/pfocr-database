caption: Figure 2. Implication of Rho GTPases in osteoclastogenesis. Hematopoietic
  stem cells differentiation into osteoclasts takes place through several steps controlled
  by keys factors. PU.1 induces the expression of c-Fms in hematopoietic stem cells
  of the myeloid lineage (A). M-CSF secreted by osteoblastic cells allows to the induction
  of myeloid stem cell into the monocyte lineage. The interaction between M-CSF and
  c-Fms leads to the activation of Cdc42 and the PI3K/Akt axis resulting in the proliferation
  of these cells (B). M-CSF/c-Fms binding is also responsible for the presence of
  RANK at their surface (B). RANKL secreted by osteocytes leads to the commitment
  of monocyte stem cells into osteoclast precursors. RANKL binding to RANK is followed
  by TRAF6 recruitment and activation of Rac1-dependent TAK1 pathway leading to NFκB
  nuclear translocation into the nucleus. NFκB and NFATc2 are then able to initiate
  the expression of the master regulator of osteoclastogenesis, NFATc1 (C). By unknown
  mechanisms, Cdc42 also regulates NFATc1 expression (C). RANKL and costimulatory
  signals, from DAP12 and FCγR, lead to sustained intracellular calcium influx that
  activates NFATc1. It is in part dependent on Rac1-mediated ROS production and PLCγ
  stimulation (D). Then, NFATc1 in cooperation with other transcription factors allows
  to the expression of osteoclast-specific target genes involved in precursor fusion
  (D). This process is dependent on precursor migration and contact, which implicate
  Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42, and RhoU through different signaling pathways (E). In multinucleated
  cells, NFATc1 associates with co-activators to induce the expression of osteoclast-specific
  target genes involved in osteoclast maturation and function (F).
