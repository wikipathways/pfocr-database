caption: Typical antidepressants, such as SSRIs, block monoamine reuptake by the 5-HT
  transporter (SERT). This leads to regulation of postsynaptic G protein coupled receptors,
  which couple to a variety of second messenger systems, including the cAMP-PKA-CREB
  pathway [, ] These effects require chronic SSRI treatment, due to the requirement
  for desensitization of 5-HT autoreceptors, and because 5-HT is a neuromodulator
  that produces slow neuronal responses. In contrast, glutamate produces fast excitation
  of neurons via stimulation of ionotropic receptors, including AMPA and NMDA receptors,
  resulting in depolarization and rapid intracellular signaling, such as induction
  of Ca2+-calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CAMK). Glutamate and 5-HT signaling
  lead to regulation of multiple physiological responses including regulation of synaptic
  plasticity, as well as gene expression. One target of antidepressant treatment and
  CREB signaling is BDNF []. BDNF transcripts may remain in the soma or are targeted
  for transport to dendrites where they are subject to activity-dependent translation
  and release. A common BDNF polymorphism, Val66Met, which is encoded by G196A, blocks
  the trafficking of BDNF to dendrites [, ]. The induction of BDNF and other neurotrophic
  factors contributes to the actions of antidepressant treatments, including neuroprotection,
  neuroplasticity, and neurogenesis.
