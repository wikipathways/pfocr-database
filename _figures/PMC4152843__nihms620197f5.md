caption: Inferred connectivity maps for differentially expressed genes in (A) the
  “inflammatory response” network and (B.) networks associated with “lipid metabolism”
  and “cellular movement” Red indicates that the genes are up-regulated in IMA relative
  to aorta and green indicates they were down-regulated. Uncolored genes or complexes
  were not found to be differentially expressed in our original analysis but were
  found through the pathway analysis.
