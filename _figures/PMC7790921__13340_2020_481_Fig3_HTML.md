caption: Role of the Elovl6/Pnpla3/CerS pathway regulating hepatic insulin signaling.
  Excess consumption of carbohydrate and hyperinsulinemia activate de novo lipogenesis
  and upregulate the expression of Elovl6 and Pnpla3 in the liver. Activation of Elovl6
  increases the amount of C18:0, enhancing C18:0-ceramide production through formation
  of an enzyme complex with ceramide synthase (CerS) on the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER). Pnpla3 acts on the surface of lipid droplets (LDs), releases FAs from triacylglycerols
  (TAGs), and modifies ceramide FA composition by forming an enzyme complex with CerS
  at the ER-LD interface. Both Elovl6 and Pnpla3 are linked to the generation of C18:0-ceramide,
  which activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by disrupting the interactions with
  its endogenous inhibitor I2PP2A. As a consequence, PP2A inhibits insulin signaling
  by impairing Akt activation
