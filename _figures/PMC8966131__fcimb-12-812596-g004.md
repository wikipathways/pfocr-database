caption: Mechanisms by which lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affects the development of OA.
  I LPS is involved in OA by activating innate immune response via the formation of
  the LPS–LBP–CD14–TLR4–MD-2 complex, increasing NF-κB levels, up regulating TNF,
  IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and RANKL levels, raising the production of MMPs and further reinforcing
  NF-κB activation. II LPS is involved in OA by activating complement pathway in chondrocytes
  (). III LPS is involved in OA by inducing inflammation in adipose tissue, precipitated
  systemic changes in cytokines, adipokines and growth factors, and finally affecting
  the local inflammatory environment inside the knee joint (). LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  LBP, LPS binding protein; MD-2, myeloid differentiation protein-2; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; TNF, tumor necrosis factor;
  IL-1β, interleukin-1-beta; RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand; PTX3, long
  pentraxin 3; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases.
