caption: 'Proteomic approaches and strategies typically applied to analyze plant proteomes.
  Here, the top-down approach follows a comprehensive-centric definition that refers
  to protein separation by 2-DE prior to MS, while bottom-up applies to sample separation
  at the peptide level prior to the peptide analysis by MS. When dealing with complex
  samples, they can be extensively fractionated before the protein digestion step
  by either SDS-PAGE [113,114] or HPLC. Wider proteome coverage can be achieved by
  2D protein separation, where orthogonal separation is applied in combination with
  the second peptide separation by the standard RP-HPLC, coupled online to MS. The
  additional separation step can consist of up-front chromatography based on high
  pH chromatography or strong cation exchange (SCX), which are among the most widely
  used techniques. Then, the digested proteins from gel slices or chromatographic
  fractions are analyzed by LC-MS/MS. On the one hand, if the goal is to identify
  new proteins of interest, a discovery or hypothesis-free approach is undertaken.
  In this case, MS data acquisition can be done by either DDA or IDA. Protein abundance
  can be determined simultaneously to protein identification by either label-free
  or label-based quantification methods, of which iTRAQ/TMT is the most widely used.
  On the other hand, having identified proteins of interest, a targeted or hypothesis-driven
  approach can be applied with different goals, to do the following: accurately quantify
  a protein by absolute quantification; validate protein abundances obtained from
  a discovery-based approach; selectively analyze a metabolic pathway under different
  conditions. In this case, MS data acquisition can be done by either an SRM or a
  PRM analysis'
