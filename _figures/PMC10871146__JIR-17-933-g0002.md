caption: Hydrogen maintains an anaerobic environment in the intestine and reduces
  oxidative damage via selective antioxidant effects. Hydrogen functions by reducing
  excessive free radicals produced by immune cells, which regulates the balance of
  oxidative stress. It also regulates endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation
  via the TLR-4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway to ultimately protect the intestinal
  barrier and maintain a balanced gut microbiota. By Figdraw
