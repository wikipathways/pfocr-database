caption: 'The lipoate ligase reaction. The reaction proceeds in two partial reactions:
  the formation of lipoyl-adenylate, followed by transfer of the lipoate moiety to
  the acceptor protein (an E2 or GcvH protein). The lipoyl-adenylate intermediate
  is tightly bound. The biochemically characterized ligases also use octanoate as
  a substrate. Attachment is to an LD of a 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase E2 protein or to
  a glycine cleavage system H protein.'
