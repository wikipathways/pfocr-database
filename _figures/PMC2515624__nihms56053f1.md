caption: SMO is the key signal transducer in the Hh pathway. In the absence of Hh,
  the Hh receptor PTC can suppress SMO activity and repressor forms of Gli (GliR)
  are generated, leading to downregulation of Hh target genes. In the presence of
  Hh ligands (Shh, Ihh or Dhh), PTC is unable to affect SMO signaling. SMO somehow
  can promote formation of activated forms of Gli (GliA), resulting in upregulation
  of Hh target genes. Gene mutations (PTC, SMO) or abnormal over-expression of Hh
  ligands all can lead to elevated expression of Hh target genes.
