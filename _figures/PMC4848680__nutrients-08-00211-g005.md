caption: NF-kB signal transduction pathway. NF-κB protein complex (p65–p50) is bound
  and inhibited by IκB proteins. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, LPS, growth factors,
  and antigen receptors activate an IKK complex (IKKβ, IKKα, and IKKγ), which phosphorylates
  IκB proteins. Phosphorylation of IκB leads to its ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation, releasing NF-κB. Active NF-κB proteins are further activated by post-translational
  modifications (phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation) and translocate to the
  nucleus where they induce target gene expression, influencing a broad range of biological
  processes including innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation, stress responses,
  B cell development, and lymphoid organogenesis. Anti-inflammatory effects of several
  flavonoids have been related to the suppression of the NF-κB signal transduction
  pathway.
