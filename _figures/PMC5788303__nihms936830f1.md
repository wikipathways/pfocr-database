caption: Activation of the lipid signaling pathway by GluN1/GluN2A receptor and the
  creation of transporter mediated drug resistance. NMDA binding to the GluN1/GluN2A
  receptor allows the influx of Ca2+ into the cell, which leads to cPLA2 activation
  and the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from phospholipids. Arachidonic acid is
  metabolized to PGE2, which is transported by ABCC transporters out of the cell allowing
  the PGE2 binding to EP-R. The EP-R activation leads to nuclear translocation of
  NF-κB followed by ABCG2 protein transcription and MDR.,–
