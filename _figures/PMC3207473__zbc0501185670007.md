caption: 'Model: TTP transition from “hypo- to hypermodified” determines its functional
  switch. Top panel, Western blot of whole cell lysates obtained from TNFα-induced
  MEF (time points as indicated; + indicates BMS added 30 min after TNFα treatment),
  showing the characteristics of JNK activation (top panel) in direct comparison with
  the course of TTP patterning (middle panel); LMW-TTP appears related to transient
  JNK activation (0–45 min), whereas prolonged JNK activity is in line with the expression
  of HMW-TTP, which disappears in favor of LMW-TTP, as soon as JNK becomes inactive.
  Bottom panel, schematic depiction of TNFR1 induced cross-talk between NF-κB and
  JNK signaling cascades fused with our observations on TTP behavior; TNFα induction
  results in activation of both the IκB kinase cascade ending at NF-κB activation
  (left side) as well as the JNK pathway (right side). NF-κB activation proceeds faster,
  preventing prolonged JNK activation by inducing transcription of negative regulators
  of JNK, including Gadd45b. This scenario results in NF-κB-mediated target gene expression
  being indispensable for the regulation of inflammation as well as cell survival.
  Tristetraprolin, constituting an immediate early NF-κB target gene, is produced
  rapidly after induction and runs through alternating modification states throughout
  the course of a TNFα response (top panel, see also C); at very early time points
  low TTP levels appear, which increase upon time to reach a maximum and finally rapidly
  disappear. Based on our results, we postulate that lower doses of TTP can only be
  accessible by p38α, for example, to produce LMW-species that act on the inhibition
  of NF-κB activity. During this time frame, other MAPKs, such as MEKK1 for example,
  would be blocked until TTP has reached a specific level and not until then generate
  the observed HMW species that would subsequently be ubiquitinated by TRAF2. This
  would be in agreement with our finding that p38α overrules MEKK1 function toward
  TTP and allow the correct timing for JNK activation; consequently, “hypermodified”
  TTP would no longer act on NF-κB but actively contribute to JNK activation instead
  and therefore constitute a balancer in the cross-talk between these signaling cascades.'
