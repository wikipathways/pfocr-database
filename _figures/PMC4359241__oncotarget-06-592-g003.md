caption: 'The mTORC2/AKT/AR pathway (red arrows) leads to tumor cell proliferation.
  Rapamycin combined with bicalutamide has an apoptosis-inducing effect in prostate
  cancer. Rapamycin inhibits both mTOR complexes, mTORC1 with raptor and mTORC2 with
  rictor; nevertheless abrogation of mTORC2, a kinase for AKT phosphorylation, further
  inhibits the AR transcription cascade in an AKT-dependent manner. As a counterpoint,
  abrogation of mTORC1 produces AKT/AR-independent apoptosis, though it continues
  to stimulate the AR transcriptional cascade and AKT phosphorylation. According to
  the suggested cross-talk, it would take a combination of androgen blockade plus
  mTOR inhibitors to fully abrogate the mTORC2/AKT/AR pathway. Barnett et al. [] found
  that, out of 47 tumors evaluable by immunohistochemistry, 36% had PTEN loss which
  was associated with an increased relapse in high risk prostate cancer treated with
  chemotherapy followed by surgery. PTEN loss activates the AKT/mTOR pathway [] thus
  supporting the use of mTOR inhibitors in this condition. Abbreviations: AR, androgen
  receptor; AKT, aKT serine/threonine kinase.'
