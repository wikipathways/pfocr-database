caption: 'Reactions involved in the flux of fatty acids into . De novo glycerolipid
  synthesis is shown in white arrows, acyl transfer reactions are indicated by dashed
  lines, and the movement of the lipid glycerol backbone through the pathway is shown
  in solid lines. Major reactions (in thick lines) controlling the flux of fatty acid
  from  into  are as follows:  acylation reaction of acyl editing by  (A);  deacylation
  reaction of acyl editing by the reverse action of  or phospholipase A (B); and the
  interconversion of  and  by  (C). Substrates are in boldface, enzymatic reactions
  are in italics. FAD, Fatty acid desaturase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; GPAT, acyl-CoA:
  acyltransferase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPAT, acyl-CoA:LPA acyltransferase;
  PA, phosphatidic acid; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D.'
