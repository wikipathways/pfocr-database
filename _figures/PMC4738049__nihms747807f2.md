caption: Components of cytokine signalling pathways and associated transcriptional
  responses affected in PIDs and detected as genetic risk loci for common inflammatory
  diseases (red lettering). Upon binding of type I IFNs to their receptor (IFNAR),
  the canonical signal transducer (JAK1/TYK2), and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)–STAT2–IFN-regulatory
  factor 9 (IRF9) signalling complex binds to IFN-stimulated response elements leading
  to induction of a large number of IFN-stimulated antiviral genes such as OAS and
  MX1. Binding of Type II IFNs can also signal through STAT1 homodimers, inducing
  antimicrobial responses. The engagement of different interleukin receptors (IL-2R,
  IL-7R, IL-10R, IL-12R, IL-21R) induces the transcription of target genes through
  several signalling pathways, including the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, all of which induce several immune
  gene responses.
