caption: Illustration of BPA on LC development. Bisphenol A (BPA) or its analogs can
  bind both estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) and estrogen-related receptors (ERR1–3),
  which blocks LC gene expression, binds to androgen receptor (NR3C4) as an antagonist
  to block the activation of LC genes. BPA can also bind membrane G-coupled receptor
  (GPER) or ESR1, which activates ERK1/2 pathway to inhibit the differentiation of
  Leydig cells. The combined consequence of BPA action leads to lower testosterone
  synthesis.
