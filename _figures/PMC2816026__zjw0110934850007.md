caption: Met signal transduction exploited by InlB from L. monocytogenes. InlB321-dependent
  differentially phosphorylated protein kinases identified in the present study are
  highlighted in blue. L. monocytogenes activates the PI3K and MAPK pathways, both
  essential for actin cytoskeleton remodeling as a prerequisite for invasion. The
  identified induction of phosphorylation events on RSK2 and MEK support a negative
  feedback theory in this signaling module. Dephosphorylation of MARK2 in the kinase
  domain as one novel finding is suggested to block MARK2 activation, which is probably
  essential for Listeria invasion. Active MARK2 leads to destabilization of MTs by
  phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins. Earlier studies already demonstrated
  that destabilization of MTs by nocodazole impaired efficient Listeria uptake by
  the host cell. The functional contribution of novel candidates such as Nek9 or CK1D
  to the InlB/Met invasion strategy will be the subject of further studies. Ub, ubiquitin.
