caption: Integrin αvβ6 signalosome in tumor progression. Studies have suggested multiple
  pro-tumorigenic roles of αvβ6 integrin, involving distinct downstream pathways,
  in accelerating tumor progression. For example, the αvβ6 integrin can facilitate
  cancer cell invasiveness and thus metastasis via increasing MMPs secretion and ECM
  degradation. By interacting with ERK2, αvβ6 activates MAPK signaling to increase
  cell proliferation and tumor growth, and to inhibit 5-FU-induced cancer cell apoptosis
  through suppression of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (by impairing the cytochrome
  C release, decreasing the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and upregulating
  the anti-apoptotic factor BCL-2), leading to drug resistance. Furthermore, the αvβ6
  integrin can interact with latent TGFβ and subsequently activate TGFβ-linked pathways
  to positively contribute to EMT process and metastasis. Alternatively, the activated
  TGFβ signaling drives expression of cancer stemness factors (e.g., SOX4) to evade
  immunotherapy. Lines with arrows and perpendicular denote a promotion or an inhibition
  effect, respectively. P within the circle denotes phosphorylation. See text for
  details
