caption: Alcohol’s effects on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and the
  stress response. Alcohol can stimulate neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN)
  of the hypothalamus to release corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine
  vasopressin (AVP). Stress sensed in the amygdala also elicits a similar activation
  of this stress response pathway. In the anterior pituitary, CRF stimulates the production
  of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which serves as the prohormone for adrenocorticotropic
  hormone (ACTH). AVP potentiates the effects of CRF on ACTH release from the anterior
  pituitary. ACTH stimulates cells of the cortical portion of adrenal glands to produce
  and release glucocorticoid hormones (i.e., cortisol). High levels of glucocorticoids
  inhibit CRF and ACTH release through a negative feedback by binding to glucocortiocoid
  receptors (GRs) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) in various brain regions.
  Neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus release β-endorphin (BEP), which
  also regulates CRF release. BEP also acts on the autonomous nervous system and inhibits
  the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) stress response. CRF, ACTH, and glucocorticoids
  also act on different organs of the immune system and stimulate cytokine production
  and release into the general circulation. These cytokines then reach the brain where
  they trigger a neuroimmune response that sensitizes the stress-response pathway.
  Acute exposure to alcohol stimulates the HPA-axis stress response and induces suppression
  of cytokine production. In contrast, chronic exposure to alcohol induces a blunted
  HPA-axis stress response characterized by an absence of negative feedback control
  of this pathway and an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6
  (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), leading to stress intolerance, immune
  dysfunction and alcohol use disorder.
