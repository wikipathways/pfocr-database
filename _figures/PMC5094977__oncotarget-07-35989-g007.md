caption: A network schematic depicting the key pathways and aberrations present in
  HEL cell line that has JAK2-V617F as a key driver mutation along with a mutation
  of P53, deletion of RB1 and CDKN2A and amplification of E2F1. A constitutively activated
  JAK2 mutant activates various downstream pathway loops leading to activation of
  ERK, AKT and key transcription factors including STAT3, STAT5, NFkB, AP1 and others.
  This along with the other aberrations converge at a highly proliferative phenotype
  and increased cell viability. The cytokine modulated pathways are depicted in terms
  of how they interact with the JAK2 driven disease network. IFNγ and IL6 converge
  via JAK2 wild type signaling and therefore are not showing a significant impact
  in changing the outcome of G6 efficacy since JAK2 is mutated and constitutively
  activated. TNFα on the other hand activates NFkB, but also activates the pro-apoptotic
  pathway loop, thereby enhancing the efficacy of the JAK2 inhibitor and the combination.
  The inhibitors G6 and ABT737 are also shown inhibiting their respective targets
  and the schematic highlights the rationale for the use of these two drugs in combination
  in a JAK2-V617F driven MPN disease network.
