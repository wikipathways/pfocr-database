caption: In the absence of Hh signal, Patched1 (Ptch1) inhibits the Hh pathway through
  the modulation of the Smoothened (Smo). Since Smo is inactivated, the Glioma-associated
  oncogene- Suppressor of Fused (Gli-Sufu) complex is retained in the cytosol, where
  it is exposed to phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), thereby inhibiting signal
  transduction by Gli. When Hh signal is present (here represented by Shh), its binding
  to Ptch1 relives pathway inhibition, induces its translocation away from the cilium,
  allowing activated Smo and Gli-Sufu complex transport to the tip of the cilium,
  where Gli becomes dissociated from Sufu. Subsequent retrograde transport of Gli
  then brings it to the nucleus, where it regulates expression of target genes. Image
