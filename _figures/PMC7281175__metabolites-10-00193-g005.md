caption: 'Schematic representation of [U-13C] glucose metabolic flux in the liver.
  The metabolic flux of [U-13C] glucose in the glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway,
  and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is demonstrated. The solid and hollow black
  circles represent the 13C and 12C, respectively. The solid gray circles represent
  the 13C in undetected metabolites. The boxes with histograms represent the expression-patterns
  among W, P, and T (significant changes at least twice in pairwise comparison). The
  asterisks represent metabolites with no change or only a single significant change
  in a pairwise comparison. The histogram bar represents the relative expression levels
  of W (green histogram), P (orange histogram), and T (red histogram), and the bar’s
  height indicates a significant change in expression levels. G6P: glucose 6-phosphate;
