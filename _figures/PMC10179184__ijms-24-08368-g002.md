caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism of CYLD function in oxidative stress-induced
  DNA damage. Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage may stimulate the assembly of DNAPKsome
  and the activation of Mps1, which phosphorylates c-Abl and promotes its cytoplasmic
  translocation. Also, c-Abl phosphorylates OTULIN, disrupting its binding to LUBAC.
  The released LUBAC interacts with SPATA2 and participates in the TNF-R1-mediated
  signaling pathway, promoting the interaction between CYLD and LUBAC. CYLD-LUBAC
  binding induces DNA damage by interacting with regulatory proteins and stimulating
  NF-kB activation. Additionally, oxidative stress activates IKKβ, which induces CYLD
  phosphorylation, in turn activating CYLD’s deubiquitination function and terminating
  NF-κB signaling
