caption: 'Schematic representation of the regulation of the anti-viral signaling pathway.
  Following recognition of viral products by their cognate pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs), including endosomal-localized Toll-like receptors (TLRs), intracellular
  cytoplasmic sensors RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and DNA sensors can recruit different
  adaptor proteins (TRIF, MyD88, mitochondria-localized IPS-1 or STING, an endoplasmic
  reticulum resident protein) to activate TBK1/IKKɛ and the IKK complex. Activated
  TBK1 and IKKɛ then phosphorylate IRF3, trigger its dimerization and nuclear translocation
  and activate NF-κB subunits, resulting in the induction of genes encoding type I
  IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. After sensing viruses by a cytosolic DNA sensor,
  AIM2 also induces the conversion of the inactive form of proIL-1β to its bioactive
  form of IL-1β cytokine through an inflammasome complex that consists of ASC and
  caspase-1 for viral restriction. These anti-viral signaling pathways are tightly
  regulated by endogenous regulators at multiple levels. A20 modulates IRF3 activity
  by interacting with TBK1 and IKKɛ, and inhibits dimerization of IRF3, resulting
  in the suppression of the IFN response. PIN1 modulates polyubiquitination and proteasomal-dependent
  degradation of IRF3. FoxO1 promotes K-48 linked polyubiquitination and degradation
  of IRF3. PTEN selectively suppress IRF3 function by dephosphorylation via its phosphatase
  activity. Recently, YAP has been identified as an endogenous modulator of IRF3 activity.
  It modulates IRF3 function as follows: the transcriptional regulator YAP blocks.
  (1) the dimerization of the transcription factor IRF3 and its impaired translocation
  upon viral infection. (2) The kinase IKKɛ targets YAP for phosphorylation and 3.
  lysosomal-mediated proteasomal degradation, which leads to enhanced anti-viral responses.
