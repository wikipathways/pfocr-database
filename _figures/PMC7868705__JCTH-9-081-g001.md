caption: (A) Canonical NF-κB signaling pathways. In resting cells, the binding of
  members of the IκB family, such as the prototypical IκB member IκBα, to classical
  NF-κB complexes, particularly NF-κB1 p50-RelA and NF-κB1 p50-c-Rel dimers, inhibit
  the nuclear translocation of NF-κB complexes. The canonical pathway is activated
  by signals from various immune-related receptors. In various proinflammatory cytokine-stimulated
  cells, ligand-receptor interactions initially activate TAK1. Subsequently, TAK1
  activates the IKK complex and mediates IκBα phosphorylation and ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent
  proteasomal degradation, leading to the rapid and transient nuclear translocation
  of the classical NF-κB dimers. (B) Noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathways. In resting
  cells, the cIAP1/2-TRAF2-TRAF3 multisubunit ubiquitin ligase complex is composed
  of TRAF2, TRAF3, and cIAP1/2, in which TRAF2 acts as the adaptor protein, linking
  TRAF3 and cIAP1/2. The binding of NIK to TRAF3 leads to the constitutive degradation
  of NIK in a Ub- and proteasome-dependent manner. Following ligand (such as LTβ,
  CD40L or BAFF) stimulation, the cIAP1/2-TRAF2-TRAF3 complex is recruited to the
  receptors. The focus of cIAP1/2 mediated k48 ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent
  protein degradation shifts from NIK to TRAF3, which induces TRAF3 degradation and
  NIK stabilization. Subsequently, phosphorylated NIK phosphorylates IKKα, which,
  in turn, phosphorylates NF-κB2 p100, resulting in the processing of p100 into p52
  and the nuclear translocation of RelB-p52 heterodimers. In addition, stabilized
  NIK is regulated via a negative feedback loop, involving IKKα-mediated phosphorylation.
