caption: Involvement of platelets in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. Environmental
  allergens, anti-IgE, and/or anti-IgE receptors (anti-FcεRI and anti-FcεRII/CD23)
  activate resting platelets. (1) Activated platelets secrete IL-33 that acts on ILC2,
  or Dkk-1 and 5-HT to promote naive T helper cells’ differentiation into Th2 effectors.
  Moreover, they can influence the activity of TSLP-stimulated mDCs in a RANK-RANKL-dependent
  pathway or inhibit regulatory T cells’ differentiation by overexpressing CD40L (CD154).
  (2) Activated platelets are involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Platelets
  form aggregates with leukocytes through P-selectin-PSGL-1 interaction after allergens
  stimulation. The platelet-eosinophil aggregates (PEA) activate eosinophils and upregulate
  the expression of αMβ2 and α4β1 integrins, through which PEA can adhere to the endothelial
  cells and migrate to the inflammatory sites. The platelet-neutrophil aggregates
  (PNA) activate the arachidonic acid pathway to generate CysLTs which contribute
  to ARED. The CD69-Myl9 system is a newly found mechanism mediating the infiltration
  of activated CD4+CD69+ T cells into the inflamed tissue. (3) Activated platelets
  produce spasmogen, such as TxA2, PF4, PAF, BDNF, and S1P, to induce bronchial smooth
  muscle contraction as well as airway hyperresponsiveness. They also release MMP2,
  MMP9, cationic proteins, and ROS to cause degradation of extracellular matrix. PDGF
  promotes proliferation of fibroblasts and airway smooth muscle cells. GM-CSF inhibits
  apoptosis of eosinophils and thus contributes to the chronic inflammatory response
  and tissue damage. GM-CSF also enhances the 5-LO activity in neutrophils and eosinophils
  to accelerate the production of CysLTs, causing airway smooth muscle contraction,
  inflammatory cell recruitment, and edema. All these processes together lead to chronic
  airway inflammation and airway remodeling.
