caption: ‘Selecting’ DP thymocytes and iNKT ‘precursor’ cells communicate via invariant
  TCR-CD1d and SLAM family (SLAM, Ly108) interactions. Engagement of the SLAM family
  receptors at the cell surface leads to recruitment of the adaptor molecule SAP and
  the Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn. The SLAMf receptor-SAP-Fyn signaling complex
  triggers activation of NFκB via protein kinase θ (PKCθ) and Bcl10. Additionally,
  SLAMf receptor-SAP-Fyn signaling also phosphorylates and recruits the SH2 domain–containing
  inositol phosphatase (SHIP), Dok1/2 adaptor proteins, and the Ras GTPase-activating
  protein (RasGAP). By binding to RasGAP, Dok1/2 inhibits Ras-MAPK activation. It
  is possible that SLAMf receptor-induced signals cooperate with those induced by
  the invariant TCR to modulate NFκB-Ras pathway activity in a manner required for
  iNKT cell development.
