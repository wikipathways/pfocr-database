caption: Schematic representation of the line of events by which HA modulates the
  leukocyte-EC interaction. Proinflammatory cytokines, through their receptors, activate
  NF-κB pathway that has a pivotal role in the inflammatory response by activating
  several genes including HAS2 (this work), CD44, and other adhesive molecules (ICAM-1,
  E-selectin, VCAM-1, and MHC class I genes) (). High molecular weight HA synthesized
  by HAS2 interacts with CD44 present both on ECs and leukocytes in the “sandwich
  model” proposed by Ruffell and Johnson (), which drives immune cells to adhere to
  ECs that eventually contribute to inflammation.
