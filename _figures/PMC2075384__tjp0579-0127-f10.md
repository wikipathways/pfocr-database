caption: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), including receptors for AngII, endothelin-1
  and α1a-R, are coupled to activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in cardiomyocytes.
  PKC directly activates AE3 by phosphorylation of Ser-67 () and also activates the
  MAP kinase signalling pathway (MAPK), which in turn activates NHE1. AE3 and NHE1
  physically associate with cytosolic carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), which activates
  their transport activity by supplying HCO3− and H+ for their respective transport
  functions. Co-activation of AE3 and NHE1 is pathological, since the acid generated
  by AE3 efflux of bicarbonate is in turn removed by NHE1. Resulting hyperactivity
  of NHE1 causes cellular sodium loading. Sodium activates PKC (), resulting in feed-forward
  activation of PKC. Elevated cytosolic sodium levels reduce activity of the plasma
  membrane sodium–calcium exchanger, which is normally required to maintain low calcium
  levels. Activated PKC and elevated cytosolic calcium levels will contribute to hypertrophic
  growth in the myocardium (; ). 6-Ethoxyzolamide may arrest the hypertrophic programme
  directly by inhibition of carbonic anhydrase and indirectly by limiting substrates
  for transport by NHE1 and AE3fl.
