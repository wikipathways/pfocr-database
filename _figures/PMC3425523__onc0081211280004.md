caption: 'Genes known to cause kidney cancer and their relationship with the mammalian
  target of rapamycin signaling pathway. MET receptor activation results in physiological
  processes, including proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. Phosphorylation
  of protein kinase B downregulates tuberous sclerosis complex, increasing mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 activity, which results in enhanced hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF)-mediated transcription. Mutations to fumarate hydrogenase and succinate
  dehydrogenase impair prolyl hydroxylase activity, causing dysregulation in HIF degradation.Abbreviations:
  Akt, protein kinase B; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; FH, fumarate hydrogenase;
  FLCN, folliculin; FNIP, folliculin interacting protein; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor;
  HIF, hypoxia-inducible factors; LKB1, liver kinase B1; MET, hepatocyte growth factor
  receptor; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; mTORC2, mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 2; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;
  PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; Rheb, Ras-family GTPase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase;
  TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex. Reproduced with adaptation from Linehan et al.
