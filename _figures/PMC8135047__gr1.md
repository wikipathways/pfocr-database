caption: Overview of bile acid synthesis pathways. Important intermediates of the
  classical pathway of bile acid synthesis as the main route of cholesterol catabolism
  in the liver are displayed on the left. Next to it, intermediates of alternate pathways
  including the acidic pathway initiated by CYP27A1 (expressed in many tissues including
  the lung and brain), the cerebral pathway (CYP46A1; only expressed in brain), and
  the 25-hydroxylation pathway (CH25H) are shown. Reactions catalyzed by CYP27A1,
  the enzyme lacking in CTX, are highlighted by red lettering of CYP27A1. Reactions
  catalyzed by CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, the main enzymes upregulated in CTX, are highlighted
  by green lettering. Red arrowheads (significantly increased/decreased) and bars
  (unchanged) indicate differences measured in patients with CTX in relation to controls
  in serum. Blue arrowheads exhibit differences between the groups in CSF. Only metabolites
  with symbols were analyzed. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; CTX, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
