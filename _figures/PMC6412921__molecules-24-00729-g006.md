caption: Pathways predicted to be involved in the anti-Alzheimer’s disease effect
  of MCCP. The green lines indicated the signal that up-regulated or activated the
  gene, and the red lines indicated the signal involved in the suppression. The dashed
  lines indicated the hypothetical pathway that remained to be elucidated. The yellow
  circle means (+)-catechins, the red circle means procyanidins and the blue circle
  means caffeine.
