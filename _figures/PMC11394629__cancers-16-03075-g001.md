caption: 'Genetics of BCC. Left (normal): PTCH1 suppresses SMO in the absence of HH
  ligands. SUFU and PKA are negative regulators of GLI. Right (BCC): Shh ligands bind
  to PTCH1 → SMO is de-repressed and activates the GLI family of transcription factors
  which are translocated to the nucleus after dissociating from their inhibitor SUFU.
  GLI targets genes involved in cell cycle and survival. GLI: Glioma-associated oncogene,
  Shh: Sonic Hedgehog, PKA: Protein Kinase A, PTCH1: PATCHED1, SMO: Smoothened protein,
  SUFU: Suppressor of Fused. Adapted from (Hedgehog Signaling Pathway), by BioRender
