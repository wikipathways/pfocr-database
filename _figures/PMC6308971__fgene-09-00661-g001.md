caption: Illustrative description of the linkage of KEs of an AOP with molecular pathways
  described in WikiPathways and the practical application of transcriptomics. Transcriptomics
  and pathway enrichment analysis are commonly used to elucidate molecular pathways
  affected after exposure to a chemical or stress signal. In this illustration, gene
  expression levels in WP3942 () are significantly changed (red and blue nodes in
  the pathway diagram, for up- and downregulation). Because this pathway is linked
  to the MIE and first KE, these are hypothetically affected by the chemical, highlighted
  with red borders and require validation. WP143 () is not affected by the exposure
  of this chemical at the same time and dose, and the KE that is linked to this biological
  pathway is not considered to be affected but could follow later or at a higher dose.
  AO, adverse outcome; KE, key event; MIE, molecular initiating event; PW, pathway;
  WP, WikiPathways.
