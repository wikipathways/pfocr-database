caption: 5-HT2C receptor signaling. After activation of the 5-HT2C receptor by 5-HT,
  the Gαq/11 protein is activated and subsequently stimulates phospholipase C (PLC)
  activity. PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  into inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 diffuses through
  the cytoplasm and stimulates the release of calcium (Ca2+) from the endoplasmic
  reticulum and DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), leading to the phosphorylation
  of various cellular substrates, which in turn activate several intracellular biochemical
  cascades. The activation of the 5-HT2C receptor can also stimulate the activity
  of enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which is responsible for the synthesis of arachidonic
  acid (causing its release in the intracellular space). The “atypical” coupling represented
  by the orange circle demonstrates that through the coupling of the Gα12/13 protein,
  the activation of the 5-HT2C receptor stimulates phospholipase D (PLD), whose activity
  converges to PKC activation, which subsequently activates extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Another ERK activation pathway is provided through Gαi/0,
  which induces the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/glycogen
  synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) cascade. Finally, this signal transduction system controls
  genetic transcription []. The β-Arrestin protein interacts with 5-HT2C receptors
  and creates a steric impediment that blocks the coupling of heterotrimeric G proteins
  to the receptor, preventing the activation of Gα proteins.
