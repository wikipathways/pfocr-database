caption: Proposed model for the role of ER stress in coxsackievirus infection of pancreatic
  β cells. During viral infection of β cells the IRE1α signaling pathway is activated,
  resulting in the generation of the active form of XBP1 (XBP1s) and phosphorylation
  of the 2 main JNK isoforms, JNK1 and JNK2. Activation of JNK1 contributes to viral
  replication and cell apoptosis, while JNK2 has anti-apoptotic effects that partly
  counteract the JNK1 pro-apoptotic effects. Activation of the PERK-eIF2α pathway
  is transitory, probably to delay β cell apoptosis and thus enable sufficient time
  for viral amplification.
