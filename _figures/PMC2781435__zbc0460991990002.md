caption: Diagram of the Skp1 glycosylation pathway and glycoforms examined. A, glycoforms
  accumulating as a result of disruption of modification genes are indicated. Knock-out
  strains are available for all modification genes (in bold) except Gnt1 and the second
  αGalT activity. gmd encodes GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase involved in synthesis of
  GDP-Fuc from GDP-Man. B, glycosylation status of PgtA-N/pgtA-null strain. Whole
  cell extracts (100 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, Western-blotted, and
  probed with anti-actin (upper half of each blot), or mAb 4E1 for total Skp1, or
  mAb 1C9 for Gn-O-Skp1.
