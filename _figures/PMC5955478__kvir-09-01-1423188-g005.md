caption: Comparative metabolic pathway analysis and enzyme activity measurement between
  the dying group and survival group. A, Analysis of the metabolic profiles resulting
  from D. rerio challenged with V. alginolyticus provides a better insight into the
  effects of 46 significant metabolites (p<0.05). Based on the KEGG compound (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/compound/),
  metabolic network pathways in D. rerio are further analyzed with iPath2.0 (http://pathways.embl.de/iPath2.cgi).
  Red line represents increase in the survival group but decrease in the dying group;
  blue line represents increase in the dying group but decrease in the survival group;
  yellow line represents increase in both of the dying group and survival group; green
  line represents decrease in both dying group and survival group. B, Activity of
  PDH, KGDH and SDH in the control group, the dying group and the survival group.
