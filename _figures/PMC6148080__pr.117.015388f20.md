caption: Differential trafficking of somatostatin receptors. Agonist activation of
  SSTs triggers activation of the associated heterotrimeric G protein that in turn
  stimulates a second messenger system. Quenching of this signal involves phosphorylation
  of the receptor by GRKs. Phosphorylation by GRKs increases the affinity for arrestins,
  which uncouple the receptor from the G protein and target the receptor to clathrin-coated
  pits for internalization. Return to its resting state requires dissociation or degradation
  of the agonist, dephosphorylation, and dissociation of arrestin. For SST5, the catalytic
  PP1γ subunit was identified to catalyze S/T dephosphorylation at the plasma membrane
  within seconds to minutes after agonist removal. SST5 forms unstable complexes with
  arrestins that are rapidly disrupted. After dephosphorylation, SST5 is either resensitized
  at the plasma membrane or recycled back through an endosomal pathway. For SST2,
  the catalytic PP1β subunit was identified to catalyze S/T dephosphorylation. SST2
  forms stable complexes with arrestins that cointernalize into the same endocytic
  vesicles. This dephosphorylation process is initiated at the plasma membrane and
  continues along the endosomal pathway. PP1β-mediated dephosphorylation promotes
  dissociation of arrestins and, hence, facilitates quenching of arrestin-dependent
  signaling. Subsequently, SST2 is recycled back through an endosomal pathway to the
  plasma membrane. For SST3, the catalytic PP1α/β subunits were identified to catalyze
  S/T dephosphorylation at the plasma membrane within seconds to minutes after agonist
  removal. SST3 forms unstable complexes with arrestins that are rapidly disrupted.
  After dephosphorylation, SST3 is either subject to lysosomal degradation or recycled
  back to the plasma membrane through an endosomal pathway.
