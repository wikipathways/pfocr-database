caption: Transforming growth factor-β- (TGF-β-) induced EndoMT. Upon stimulation by
  TGF-β1, -2, or -3, type-2 TGF-β receptors phosphorylate ALK5 (type-1 TGF-B receptor)
  and associate into a heterotetrameric structure which induce Smad-2/3/4 complex
  formation and translocation to the nucleus. Stimulation by TGF-β1 or -3 induces
  a paracrine loop toward a TGF-β2 stimulation. Smad-7 acts as an inhibitor of Smad
  association and serves as a negative retro control. TGF-β signaling also induces
  phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2) and p38
  MAPK (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase). The BMP receptors can also trigger
  upon stimulation by the BMP ligand canonical Smad pathway and non-canonical ERK
  pathway. Inside the nucleus, all actors involved stimulate the activity of the transcription
  factor, mainly Snail, Slug, and Twist, thus initiating EndoMT by promoting transcription
  of mesenchymal markers and diminishing transcription of endothelial markers. TGF-β
  signaling crosstalk with several others pathways, including Notch which promotes
  ERK 1/2 activity and Akt2 isoform activity which will then inhibit GSK-3β. GSK-3β,
  ERK, PI3K, P38, and also CDK4 can phosphorylate Smad-2 and -3 on specific residues
  in its linker region (in red) promoting Smad signaling in a canonical-independent
  manner. However, it is worth to note that some studies report the inhibiting effect
  of linker region phosphorylation, and that the specific effects of this phosphorylation
  site seem to be cell-type dependent.
