caption: Diagram accentuating importance of CNS signaling pathways from the nucleus
  reticularis gigantocellularis (NGC) to survival movements and behavior. The NGC
  is located in the reticulospinal tract of the brainstem. It consists of giant pairs
  of monosynaptic command neurons that respond to glutamatergic stimuli. The NGC form
  a “first response” network that transmits novel information from the environment
  to all parts of the body. The network is very similar in form and function to those
  found in reptiles and fish. As with nearly all theoretical models describing signaling
  pathways regulating emotions, this model emphasizes ascending pathways to higher
  brain centers. Descending pathways are limited to the spinal cord. Missing entirely
  is the ANS neurohormonal pathway to the entire body via cardiovascular circulation.
