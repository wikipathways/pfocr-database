caption: Proposed mechanism of BCAR3-mediated enhancement of c-Src activation, cell
  spreading, and adhesion. Step 1, cytosolically localized Cas is recruited to membrane-proximal
  regions by BCAR3 through an indirect or direct interaction with BCAR3. Once at the
  membrane (step 2), Cas interacts with and activates c-Src. c-Src activation results
  in the phosphorylation of Cas, which leads to the recruitment of substrate domain
  binding partners such as Crk (step 3). Step 4, Cas/Crk interactions activate downstream
  signaling pathways important for cell spreading, migration, and invasion. BCAR3-dependent
  and BCAR3-independent c-Src signaling can also activate other signaling pathways
  important for cell proliferation and survival in the presence of antiestrogens.
  Step 5, BCAR3 itself activates an unidentified c-Src-independent pathway important
  for cell spreading.
