caption: 'Core apoptotic signaling pathways in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
  In the extrinsic pathway, the interaction between death receptors and their ligands
  activates caspase 8, which then activates caspase 3, and eventually lead to apoptosis.
  Death receptors belong to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors superfamily, which
  is essential for the transmission of intracellular and extracellular signals. The
  death receptors include FAS, TNFR1, DR4, and DR5. Death receptors bind to the corresponding
  proapoptotic ligand like FASL, TNF-α, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
  (TRAIL), to trigger extrinsic apoptosis. In mitochondrial dependent apoptotic pathway,
  when DNA damage occurs, the pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (such as
  Bax and Bak) will be upregulated and activated. Anti-apoptotic proteins (such as
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) inhibits the action of Bax and Bak. A series of apoptogenic factors
  will be released into the cytosol, including cytochrome c, apaf-1, and procaspase
  9, which forms a complex called apoptosome. This complex can activate caspase 9
  followed by the transformation of pro-caspase 3 to caspase 3 and thus trigger apoptosis.
  When cells receive extracellular stimulation, they transmit the signal to inhibitor
  of kappa-B kinase (IKK), and inhibitor of IκB is separated from the trimer complex
  formed with NF-κB. The released NF-κB rapidly enters the nucleus and binds to specific
  sequences on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to participate in physiological processes
  such as anti-apoptotic effects. Besides, apoptosis can also be induced by regulating
  the expression of p53 protein. Abbreviations: Apaf-1: Apoptotic protease activating
