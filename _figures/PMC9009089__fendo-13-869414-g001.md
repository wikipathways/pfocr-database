caption: 'Senolytic response after chemically targeting senescent properties. Senescent
  cells display several properties: senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
  by activation of the NF-κB pathway, evasion of apoptosis by activation of the Bcl-2
  family, damage to lysosomes by an acidic environment, and epigenetic modulation.
  These properties are counteracted by senolytic drugs, followed by suppression of
  SASP. BTES, GLS inhibitor. 17-DMAG, inhibitor for HSP. ARB825, epigenetic modulator.
