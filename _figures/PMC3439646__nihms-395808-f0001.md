caption: P. gingivalis interacts with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 (as part of a CD14–TLR2–TLR1
  signaling complex) and with TLR4. The activation of TLR4 is suppressed by the bacterium's
  atypical lipopolysaccharide which acts as an antagonist. The TLR2 response is manipulated
  through crosstalk with other innate receptors. By means of Arg-specific cysteine
  proteinases that release biologically active C5a from C5, P. gingivalis activates
  the C5a receptor (C5aR) and induces intracellular Ca2+signaling which synergistically
  enhances the otherwise weak cAMP responses induced by TLR2 activation alone. Maximal
  cAMP induction requires the participation of CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), which
  is activated directly by the bacterium's fimbriae. The resulting activation of the
  cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β)
  and inhibits the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-dependent killing of the
  pathogen in macrophages. An additional pathway induced downstream of TLR2 is an
  inside-out signaling pathway, mediated by RAC1, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)
  and cytohesin 1 (CYT1), which transactivates complement receptor-3 (CR3). Activated
  CR3 binds P. gingivalis and induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/ERK2
  signaling, which in turn selectively downregulates IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA expression
  through suppression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). Inhibition of bioactive
  IL-12, and secondarily IFNγ, leads to impaired immune clearance of P. gingivalis.From
