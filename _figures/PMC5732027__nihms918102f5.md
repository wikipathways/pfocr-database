caption: Our data suggest that the mechanisms of sRNA pathways have diverged in two
  key areas. In some lineages, the piRNA pathway is restricted to the germline (e.g.,
  flies), whereas in most others it is active in the soma and the germline (e.g.,
  spiders). Additionally, in some lineages (e.g., spiders), RdRP may synthesize dsRNA
  from transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II, amplifying the siRNA response.
