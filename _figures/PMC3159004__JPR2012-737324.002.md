caption: TLR-independent innate immune responses. Infection triggers increased intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration through interaction of bradykinin with the bradykinin B2 receptor
  (B2-R) among other mechanisms. Target innate immune cells utilize Ca2+ to activate
  the Ca-dependent signaling pathway leading to the activation of NFATc1. Intracellular
  T. cruzi is recognized by NOD1, activating NF-κB. T. cruzi is also recognized by
  unknown molecules leading to the activation of TBK1 and IRF3. Altogether the mechanisms
  participate in the induction of an effective immune response against the parasite.
