caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in genetic predispositions that abolish the
  function of cytotoxic lymphocytes against EBV-infected cells. The graph summarizes
  genetic mutations that predispose for EBV-associated diseases: MAGT1 and ITK can
  both mediate the T cell activation by regulating PLCγ1. This pathway is further
  regulated by RASGRP1, which is the main activator for the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway
  for T and NK cell activation. In addition, MAGT1 also interacts with NKG2D to regulate
  the cytotoxic effector function of CD8+ T cells and NK cells. By engaging the receptors
  for 2B4 and NTB-A, they facilitate the NFκB signaling pathway through the interaction
  with the SAP adaptor protein. Similar for CD27, the engagement of CD70 leads to
  the activation of NF-κB and c-Fos/c-Jun pathways. Recent studies have also shown
  HLA-DR15 and CD16 as genetic risk factors for attenuated EBV immune control but
  the underlying mechanisms remain to be further investigated.'
