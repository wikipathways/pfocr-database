caption: 'TRAIL-induced non-canonical pro-tumoral signalling via DR5 secondary complex
  formation. TRAIL agonist receptors, especially DR5, depending on cancer type and
  stage, can promote tumour growth and metastasis either through complex I or through
  a soluble secondary complex. Complex II arises from complex I and contains amongst
  other FADD, caspase-8, RIPK1, TRAF2, TRADD, cIAP, LUBAC, NEMO and IKKs. While complex
  I is associated with survival and proliferation through p38, JNK and NF-kB activation.
  Complex II appears in addition able to activate ERK1/2 pathway and Src leading to
  metastasis in vivo (see text for explanations). DR5 can directly activate signalling
  proteins involved in metastasis, thanks to its membrane-proximal domain (MPD), represented
  in orange, which directly recruits a Ca2+-binding protein, the CaM whose recruitment,
  in the presence of calcium, induce the activation of the proto-oncogene Src and
  the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, leading to PI3K, JUN, STAT3 and Rac1 activation. Activation
  of Rac1 promotes microtubules and cytoskeleton organization to activate cell migration.
  Activated CaM, by inducing Src activation can induce the phosphorylation of the
  caspase-8 on tyrosine 380, see text for details, enabling PI3K activation and subsequent
  activation of Rac1, leading to cell migration and invasion. Caspase-8 phosphorylation
  can also inhibit the adhesion complex through interacting with CPN2. This interaction
  inhibits cell adhesion and allows complex elements activation. Cell migration and
  invasion can next be induced by activating FAK and additional adhesion complex elements,
  such as PLCy, Rho, PI3K and Src. FADD, another DISC component has been described
  for its ability to trigger FAK by inhibiting miR7a expression via unknown mechanisms.
  This inhibition is linked to the expression of the pro-metastatic cytokines TGFβ
  and CCL5. Rac1 is also found, as illustrated here to be activated by direct recruitment
  to DR5 MPD, in a ligand-independent manner, but may also be activated indirectly
  (See text for additional details). Colours: writing highlights and arrows illustrate
  TRAIL-induced proliferation and inflammation (in blue), or TRAIL-induced metastasis
