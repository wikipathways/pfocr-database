caption: Two possible neural circuits which may underlie the generation of the dual-peak
  response. a Schematic illustration of the neural circuit in which an inhibitory
  signal generated by amacrine cell is superimposed on a sustained excitatory signal
  generated by bipolar cell to produce the dual-peak response. PR photoreceptor, ON
  BC ON-center bipolar cell, ON AC ST ON-center sluggish transient amacrine cell,
  the existence of which was previously reported (Marchiafava and Weiler ; Werblin
  ); ON-GC ON-center ganglion cell. The responses of the ON BC, ON ACST and ON GC
  are respectively plotted, with traces below illustrating the onset of the light
  stimulation and the dotted vertical lines marking the peak response. Gray arrows
  indicate sign conserving connections, while black arrow indicates sign inverting
  connection. b Schematic illustration of the neural circuit in which excitatory signals
  generated by two pathways with different latencies converge on the RGC. PR photoreceptor,
  ON BC ON-center bipolar cell, AC amacrine cell, ON-GC ON-center ganglion cell. The
  pathway related to the second response peak might involve a more complex amacrine
  cell network, and could be masked by the inhibitory inputs and induced when the
  inhibitory signals are weakened. The responses of the two pathways are plotted,
  with traces below illustrating the onset of the light stimulation and the dotted
  vertical lines marking the peak response. Gray arrows indicate sign conserving connections,
  while black arrow indicates sign inverting connections
