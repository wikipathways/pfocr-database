caption: At the time of primary preleptotene spermatocytes in transit at the BTB,
  such as at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle, testosterone produced by Leydig cells
  in the interstitium enters the BTB microenvironment, which is known to promote BTB
  function, binds to androgen receptor to exert is effects or mediates its action
  via nongenomic pathway, such as c-Src and ERK (; ) (see left panel). This promotes
  the production of BTB proteins (e.g., claudin-11, occludin) (; ) for the assembling
  of ‘new’ TJ-fibrils behind a migrating primary preleptotene spermatocyte (see right
  panel). Furthermore, testosterone also appears to promote transcytosis of internalized
  integral membrane proteins, perhaps from the apical region to the basal region of
  the migrating spermatocytes to facilitate ‘new’ TJ-fibrils assembly (). Cytokines
  (e.g., TGF-β3, TNFα) released from Sertoli and germ cells also bind to their corresponding
  receptors at the BTB to activate the downstream signaling function, which, in turn,
  induces protein endocytosis at the ‘old’ BTB site above the migrating spermatocytes
  but targeted to degradation via the endosome-mediated pathway () (left panel). Thus,
  ‘new’ TJ-fibrils behind the migrating spermatocytes continue to maintain the immunological
  barrier while the ‘old’ TJ-fibrils above the spermatocytes in transit are disrupted
  to facilitate cell movement. This thus provides a novel mechanism to maintain the
  immunological barrier during the transit of primary preleptotene spermatocytes at
  the BTB.
