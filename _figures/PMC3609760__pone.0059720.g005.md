caption: 'A: The expression patterns of genes in the shikimate and phenylpropanoid
  biosynthesis pathway. The scale bar displays log2-transformed fold changes. B: The
  metabolic view of shikimate and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways. The steps
  catalyzed by enzymes encoded by up-regulated genes were shown in red. The shikimate
  and phenylalanine biosynthesis pathways were highlighted with pink background and
  the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway was highlighted with light blue background.
