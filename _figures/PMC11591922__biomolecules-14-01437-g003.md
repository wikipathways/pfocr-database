caption: Mechanisms by which fasting or fasting-mimicking diets kill cancer cells
  in solid tumors. Preclinical and preliminary clinical data suggest that fasting
  or FMDs reduce levels of nutrients and factors that promote tumor growth, including
  glucose, IGF1, and insulin, and enhance autophagy. Fasting is involved in the TCA
  cycle through the production of lactate from GLUT and aerobic glycolysis, and carbon
  dioxide from TCA is involved in mitochondrial function. Reducing glucose uptake
  and forcing cancer cells to increase OXPHOS, ROS, ΔΨm loss, and ADP/ATP induce an
  anti-Warburg effect, which leads to oxidative DNA damage, p53 activation, DNA damage,
  and cell death, especially during chemotherapy. Fasting or fasting-mimicking diets
  act on the AMPK signaling pathway via IGF1 and activate the organismal autophagy
  pathway via P62 and LC3II. Fasting or fasting analog diets can reduce CD73 levels
  in certain cancer cells by activating autophagy, thereby attenuating adenosine production
  in the extracellular milieu and preventing the transition of macrophages to an immunosuppressive
  M2 phenotype. Notably, fasting or fasting-mimicking diets can have very different
  or even opposite effects in different cancer cell types, or even in the same cancer
  cell type
