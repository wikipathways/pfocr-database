caption: Involvement of CD81 in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) lifecycle. HCV initiates its
  infection into hepatocytes by an attachment step at the cell surface in which virions
  interact with non-specific factors such as glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Due to the
  association of viral particles with lipoproteins, the Low Density Lipoprotein-Receptor
  (LDL-R) likely plays a role in this initial step of entry. Then, viral particles
  bind to specific entry factors including CD81, which occupies a central position
  in the entry factor complex and which interplays with its partners. HCV first interacts
  with the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), which in turn probably facilitates
  the association of viral envelope proteins with CD81. CD81 and the tight junction
  protein claudin-1 (CLDN1) naturally form a complex that is essential to HCV entry
  and which is likely regulated by the Epidermal Growth Factor-Receptor (EGFR) and
  the GTPase HRas. After interaction with the CD81/CLDN1 complex, HCV interacts with
  occludin (OCLN), another tight junction protein. Other molecules, such as the transferrin
  receptor (TfR), the tetraspanin CD63, and the Niemann-Pick C1-like1 (NPC1L1) cholesterol
  transporter, which is mainly localized in bile canaliculi (BC), have been shown
  to also be involved in HCV entry but for which mechanisms need to be elucidated.
  The membrane diffusion of CD81 (depicted by the red ↯) is another important element
  regulating HCV entry. The virus is next internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis,
  possibly in association with CD81/CLDN1 complex and EGFR. Internalization is likely
  favored by the lipidic transfer properties of SR-BI. After fusion at low pH with
  the membrane of an early endosome, the viral genome is released into the cytosol.
  Next, translation and polyprotein processing take place and the viral RNA is replicated.
  It has been shown that CD81 could be involved in the process of replication and
  conversely RNA replication could regulate CD81 expression levels. In the late stages
  of the cycle, new virions are assembled in an ER-related compartment in close connection
  with the Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL) biogenesis pathway. This process seems
  to occur in the proximity of lipid droplets (LD). Virions that are released can
  infect new cells by cell-free transmission. Particles can also be transferred directly
  to the neighboring cells by cell-to-cell transmission for which CD81-independent
  and CD81-dependent routes have been described but are still controversial. Very
  recently, it has been shown that activated macrophages produce TNFα that increases
  the diffusion coefficient of CD81 and relocalizes OCLN at the basolateral membrane,
  thereby facilitating HCV entry.
