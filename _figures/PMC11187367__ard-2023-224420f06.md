caption: The summary of the findings. (A) The cell fraction difference between patients
  with OA and non-OA controls. The InfC and preInfC are newly identified chondrocyte
  populations, which are largely absent in non-OA controls. (B) The MIF expressed
  by other chondrocytes interacts with the CD74-CXCR2/4-CD44 complex expressed by
  InfCs and activates the MAPK signalling pathway, which increases the expression
  of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor and further promotes the
  transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This figure was created by BioRender.
  (C) An integrative analysis of scRNA-seq data and bulk RNA-seq data demonstrates
  two major subtypes of patients with OA are stratified by preFC, resulting in an
  inflammatory-related subtype (group A) and a non-inflammatory-related subtype of
  OA (group B). (D) An integrative analysis of scRNA-seq data and GWAS summary data
  shows that HTC is the key chondrocyte population that drives the susceptibility
  to the pathogenesis of OA. CXCR2/4, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2/4; ECM, extracellular
  matrix; GWAS, genome-wide association studies; HTC, hypertrophic chondrocyte; InfC,
  inflammatory chondrocyte; MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; OA, osteoarthritis; preFC, prefibrocartilage chondrocyte; preInfC,
  pre-inflammatory chondrocyte; scRNA-seq, single-cell RNA sequencing
