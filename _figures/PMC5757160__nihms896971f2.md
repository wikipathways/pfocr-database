caption: (A) Structures of butanoylated ManNAc analogues that readily enter cells
  through membrane diffusion where (B) drug metabolizing esterases remove their ester-linked
  n-butyrate groups to generate unmodified ManNAc, which (C) acts as a feedstock that
  increased metabolic flux through the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway. (D) Increased
  sialylation is proposed to increase the activity of intracellular esterases as measured
  by (E) resorufin acetate (shown) or carboxy fluorescein diacetate (CFDA) assays;
  experimental results for both of these ester-activated fluorophores are shown in
