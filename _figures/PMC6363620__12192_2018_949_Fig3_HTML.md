caption: The complex interplay between CCT and actin and tubulin. Cartoon of a eukaryotic
  cell depicting the interactions between CCT and the actin- and tubulin-based cytoskeletal
  systems. Tubulin and actin folding. The CCT oligomer folds newly synthesized tubulin
  and actin (Sternlicht et al. ). Regulation of actin transcription. The CCTε subunit
  when monomeric can act as a component of the SRF pathway by interacting with the
  co-transcriptional activator MRTF-A (M) and thus has the potential to connect the
  folding capacity of the cell for actin to the transcription of actin (Elliott et
  al. ). MRTF-A is shown in the nucleus binding together with SRF to DNA sequences
  containing a CARG motif to initiate the transcription of the SRF genes that include
  actin and several actin-binding proteins (Sun et al. ; Vartiainen et al. ). Association
  with actin filaments. CCTε can associate with actin filament bundles and its levels
  as a monomer are linked to cell shape (Brackley and Grantham ). The CCT oligomer
  can affect the initial rate of actin polymerization but not the final levels of
  actin filaments in vitro (Grantham et al. ). The actin filament severing and capping
  protein gelsolin, in its Ca2+-bound conformation, binds to the CCT oligomer (Svanstrom
  and Grantham ) but is not a folding substrate of CCT (Brackley and Grantham ). Association
  with microtubules. Some CCT subunits behave as microtubule-associated proteins in
  vitro (Roobol et al. ). CCTδ monomer interacts with p150Glued (a component of the
  dynactin complex linking the dynein motor to microtubules) in close proximity to
  the plasma membrane (Echbarthi et al. )
