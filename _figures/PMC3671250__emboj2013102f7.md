caption: Model depicting the refined Hippo pathway and step-wise LATS activation.
  (A) Signalling scheme of the Hippo pathway. PKA serves a common function in both
  non-canonical and canonical Hippo pathways. See the text for further details. (B)
  LATS1/2 is activated in two steps. The first step involves Mob1 binding and phosphorylation
  of the AL and HM. These events are sufficient for YAP Ser127 phosphorylation, which
  is a good LATS substrate. The second step involves further activation by PKA (or
  others kinases). Only this fully activated LATS can effectively phosphorylate poor
  substrates, including YAP Ser38.
