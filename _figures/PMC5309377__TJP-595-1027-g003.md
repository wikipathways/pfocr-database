caption: 'Mechanical loading is sensed through a diverse group of membrane‐anchored
  mechano‐sensors, including stretch‐activated ion channels, focal adhesion complexes
  and cell surface receptors. This mechanical sensation is then converted into biochemical
  signals by triggering several downstream signalling cascades in the cytoplasm. Elevated
  tension increases integrin clustering and phosphorylation of the focal adhesion
  kinase FAK, which triggers the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) sub‐pathways
  and the Rho pathways: the extracellular signal‐regulated kinases (ERK), c‐Jun NH‐2‐terminal
  protein kinases (JNKs) and p38 MAPKs. Elevated tension within the focal adhesions
  increases integrin clustering and FAK phosphorylation, and these molecular changes
  induce subsequently a cascade of signalling activation of the Rho pathway including
  Rac and cadherin. Calcium binds to camodulin and activates calcineurin which dephosphorylates
  the nuclear factor of activated T‐cells (NFAT). This initiates gene transcription
  of muscle remodelling transcription factors including myogenin and MEF2. The sarcoplasmic
  reticulum represents the internal calcium stores. The release of calcium is controlled
  by inositol‐1,4,5‐trisphosphate and the reuptake of calcium is controlled by the
  sarco‐endoplasmic reticulum ATPase pumps (SERCA).'
