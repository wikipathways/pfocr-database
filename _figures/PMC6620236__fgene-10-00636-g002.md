caption: Metabolic pathways associated with the previously known BMCs. (A) Legend
  for the chart on the phyletic distribution of the pathways and numbers of genomes
  with the BMC are shown. The chart demonstrates the number of analyzed genomes, in
  which this pathway is present. (B–E) Analyzed metabolic pathways and their phyletic
  distribution. BMC pathways for utilization of 1,2-propanediol (B), ethanolamine
  (C), choline (D), and fucose/rhamnose (E) are shown.
