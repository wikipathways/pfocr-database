caption: 'Signaling pathways downstream of Group I mGluR stimulation. There are three
  signaling pathways downstream of mGluR5 affecting translation: the typical PLC cascade
  reaction, the MEK-ERK-Mnk1, and the PI3K-mTOR pathway. Activation of mTOR is one
  of the primary triggers for the initiation translation via phosphorylation of 4E-BP
  and S6K. After stimulation of mGluR5, PI3K phosphorylates the membrane phospholipid
  PIP2, converting it to PIP3. PIP3 recruits Akt to the membrane and then Akt activates
  mTOR by inhibiting TSC. Subsequently, mTOR interacts with Raptor, which binds both
  4E-BP and S6K. Phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP finally results in mRNA translation.
  ERK is a point of convergence of several signaling cascades. Several FMRP target
  mRNAs (PP2A and PI3K) are members of second messenger cascades converging on ERK.
  ERK phosphorylation is regulated by phosphatases such as PP2A. In fmr1-KO mice,
  PP2A is overactivated after mGluR5 stimulation, causing the rapid deactivation of
  ERK. The Ca2+ stored by IP3 release leads to activation of Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM)
  dependent pathways, including AC1-cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) and CaMKIV,
  which were stimulated by CaM and then phosphorylate CREB. Phosphorylated CREB initiates
  the CREB-dependent transcription of fmr1 gene and upregulates FMRP. MEK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinase; Mnk1, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase 1; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3 kinase;

  PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex;
