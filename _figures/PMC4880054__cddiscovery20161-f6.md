caption: The proposed model of Cdk2 phosphorylation of Bcl-xL in cisplatin-induced
  apoptosis. Cdk2 activated in response to cisplatin treatment phosphorylated Bcl-xL
  at Ser73. Bcl-xL, when phosphorylated at Ser73, promoted self-oligomerization to
  engage in caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. In the process,
  active capases cleaved Bcl-xL at previously reported sites, D61 and D76. However,
  the resulting cleavage products of Bcl-xL were not necessary for apoptosis. Phosphorylation
  of Bcl-xL at Ser73 was sufficient to induce cell death. Inhibition of Cdk2 using
  DN-Cdk2 or purvalanol and inhibition of active caspases using zVAD-fmk blocked caspase
  activation, and subsequent Bcl-xL cleavage.
