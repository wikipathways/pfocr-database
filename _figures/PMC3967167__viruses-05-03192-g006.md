caption: Time schedule of viral-induced interference with PI3K/Akt signaling based
  on the time point of activation and benefit during viral life cycles. Early activation
  of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway during the first contact with the cell or a few
  minutes after entry can lead to both short-term cellular answers to facilitate viral
  entry and long-term reactions (lasting for hours or even days) to support viral
  and cellular splicing, viral translation and cell survival. Later activation, hours
  or days post-infection, can likewise promote such long-term effects.
