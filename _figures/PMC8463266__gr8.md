caption: Schematic illustration of the microbiota-related mechanisms of FLZ treatment
  for PD and the pathway of microbiota–gut–brain axis in PD development. FLZ treatment
  can attenuate the PD-related disturbed microbial community (e.g., Akkermansia, Helicobacter,
  and Olsenella) induced by rotenone to inhibit the release of LPS endotoxin and the
  generation of pro-inflammatory molecules including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, COX2, and
  iNOS in the gut. The suppressed intestinal inflammation can further preserve the
  gut barrier destruction by protecting tight junction. Subsequently, lower levels
  of microbes, LPS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) are released
  into the circulation, which suppresses the bacterial translocation and the systemic
  inflammation. Then, the blood–brain barrier structure is restored and lower levels
  of LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines will cross the BBB to get into the SN, which
  inhibits the activation of microglia and astrocytes. The reduced neuroinflammation
  protects dopaminergic neurons from death. Further mechanistic study suggests that
  the protective effects of FLZ administration is mediated through suppressing the
  activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway both in the gut and brain. Finally,
  FLZ administration attenuates GI dysfunctions and motor deficits in the rotenone-induced
  PD mouse model. This illustration summarizes how FLZ treatment ameliorates rotenone-induced
  PD mouse model by suppressing TLR4 pathway through microbiota–gut–brain axis. It
  also demonstrates that microbiota–gut–brain axis plays a critical role in PD pathogenesis.

  description: Schematic illustration of the microbiota-related mechanisms of FLZ
    treatment for PD and the pathway of microbiota–gut–brain axis in PD development.
    FLZ treatment can attenuate the PD-related disturbed microbial community (e.g.,
    Akkermansia, Helicobacter, and Olsenella) induced by rotenone to inhibit the release
    of LPS endotoxin and the generation of pro-inflammatory molecules including IL-1β,

    Subsequently, lower levels of microbes, LPS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β,

    translocation and the systemic inflammation. Then, the blood–brain barrier structure
    is restored and lower levels of LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines will cross
    the BBB to get into the SN, which inhibits the activation of microglia and astrocytes.
    The reduced neuroinflammation protects dopaminergic neurons from death. Further
    mechanistic study suggests that the protective effects of FLZ administration is
    mediated through suppressing the activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway
    both in the gut and brain. Finally, FLZ administration attenuates GI dysfunctions

    how FLZ treatment ameliorates rotenone-induced PD mouse model by suppressing TLR4
    pathway through microbiota–gut–brain axis. It also demonstrates that microbiota–gut–brain
