caption: Simplified models of the folate, purine, and histidine pathways with different
  antifolate treatments. (A) Although imported folate is converted to dihydrofolate
  (DHF), DHF is unable to be converted to the other intermediates and is unable to
  relieve folate stress. (B) Supplemented THF is converted to other intermediates,
  relieving folate stress generated by Tmp. (C and D) Although Smx interferes with
  dihydropteroate synthesis, both folate and THF can be converted to the downstream
  intermediates of the folate pathway, resulting in relief of the folate stress generated
  by Smx. PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate; PRATP, phosphoribosyl-ATP; PABA,
  para-aminobenzoic acid.
