caption: Pathway of injury mediated by innate immune receptors. Toll-like receptors
  (TLR) are pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) that sense damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPS). Complement receptors (CR) are PRR that sense complement effector
  molecules (e.g., C3a, C5a, C3b, iC3b, C3d) generated by DAMP-mediated activation
  of complement. Stress-induced signaling through PRRs on resident tissue cells and
  infiltrating leukocytes mediate tissue injury, and on antigen-presenting cells and
  T cells promote the donor-specific immune response. Effector responses against donor
  antigen are also PRR-signal dependent. Cross talk between CR and TLR may alter the
  cellular response in a complex biological system.
