caption: 'Proposed models for the roles of Meg3 in regulating surface GluA1 expression
  and activity-dependent synaptic potentiation. Meg3 has been proposed to act as an
  endogenous competing RNA for a subset of miRNAs that regulate the level of PTEN
  in neurons. We hypothesize that Meg3 is involved in fine-tuning the activity of
  the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to regulate the optimal number of surface AMPARs
  in neurons. (Left panel) Downregulation of Meg3 leads to a partial overactivation
  of AKT signaling via two distinct mechanisms, namely enhanced PI3K activity and
  the downregulation of PTEN expression, which subsequently lead to an increase in
  surface GluA1 expression. One of the underlying mechanisms might involve the loss
  of Meg3 interactions with a subset of miRNAs that regulate essential components
  of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. (Right panel) Our data suggest that Meg3
  is required for full activation of AKT and activity-dependent delivery of AMPARs
  to the plasma membrane during chem-LTP. We propose that Meg3 may regulate synaptic
  plasticity through distinct regulatory mechanisms such as: (1) polycomb repressive
  complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent chromatin remodeling; (2) interaction with miRNAs; or
  (3) the allosteric modulation of PI3K and/or PIP3, ensuring the optimal activation
  of PI3K signaling to maintain LTP.'
