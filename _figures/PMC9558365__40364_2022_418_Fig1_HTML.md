caption: 'Regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. (* As shown in the picture,
  Wnt signalling is divided into two states: on and off. In the off state, β-catenin
  in the cytoplasm is phosphorylated by the disruption complex with AXIN as the main
  scaffold and subsequently presented to the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP for ubiquitination
  and degradation. When Wnt ligands bind to FZD-LRP5/6 on the cell membrane, the disruption
  complex is recruited to the cell membrane. At this point, β-catenin cannot be phosphorylated
  and occupies the disruption complex, resulting in the accumulation of newly generated
  β-catenin in the cytoplasm, which then enters the nucleus to regulate TCF/LEF transcription
  by the action of related molecules)'
