  human T cells were incubated in [13C6]glucose (Glc) or [13C5]ribose-inosine (Ino)
  medium for 24 h, were extracted as described in the Methods and were analysed for

  [13C5]inosine, respectively, by unpaired two-sided t-test. X5P, xylulose-5-phosphate;

  glutamyl unit of glutathione; PCB, pyruvate carboxylase; ME, malic enzyme; TK, transketolase;
  TA, transaldolase; black dot, 12C; red dot, 13C derived either from the PDH- or
  PCB-initiated Krebs cycle reactions, or from the reverse ME reaction. Solid and
  dashed arrows represent single- and multi-step reactions, and single and double-headed
  arrows refer to irreversible and reversible reactions, respectively. Numbers on
  the x axes represent the numbers of 13C atoms in the given metabolites. Sample size
  (n) represents biologically independent samples (b,c). Green text and arrows represent
  metabolite names and routes in a branched pathway; purple arrows represent a reverse
  reaction; black text represents metabolite names; blue text represents the names
