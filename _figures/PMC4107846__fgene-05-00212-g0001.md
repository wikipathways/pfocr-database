caption: The insulin signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans. Upon insulin ligand
  binding to the DAF-2 insulin receptor in C. elegans, AGE-1 (homolog to mammalian
  PI3-K) is activated and converts PIP2 to PIP3 at the cellular membrane. PIP3 activates
  the central kinase AKT-1 (ortholog to mammalian PKB), which phosphorylates DAF-16,
  the C. elegans FOXO transcription factor, preventing its entry into the nucleus
  where it would otherwise regulate the expression of genes contributing to longevity,
  stress response, and metabolism. The DAF-18 (homolog to mammalian PTEN) phosphatase
  negatively regulates the system by decreasing the amount of PIP3 present at the
  membrane by reconverting it to PIP2.
