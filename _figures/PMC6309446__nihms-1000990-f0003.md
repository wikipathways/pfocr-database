caption: 'Nineteen active seropositive RA patients on concomitant methotrexate were
  studied. One of the involved joints was a knee or a wrist appropriate for arthroscopy.
  A Bruker Avance 700 MHz spectrometer was used to acquire NMR spectra of serum samples.
  Gene expression in synovial tissue obtained by arthroscopy was analyzed by real-time
  PCR. Correlation of serum metabolites for CD3E and CD19 using linear regression,
  controlling for both age and gender was conducted. Overview of the metabolites identified
  by NMR was organized by metabolic pathway. Metabolites that were negatively correlated
  with CD3E and CD19 are shown in red. Abbreviations: TMA: trimethylamine, TMAO: trimethylamine
  N-oxide, DMA: NN-dimethylamine, THF: Tetrahydrofolate, IMP: inosine monophosphate.'
