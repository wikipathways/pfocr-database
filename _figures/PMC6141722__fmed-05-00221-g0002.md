caption: Schematic depiction of pathophysiologic processes in specific proteinuric
  kidney diseases. Dysregulated slit diaphragm and altered actin dynamics depicted
  in specific disease states that cause podocyte foot process effacement (FPE) and
  podocyte loss. The commonalities of pathophysiology in different diseases are grouped
  into blue  (dysregulated pathways related to SD proteins) or red  (cytoskeletal
  dysregulation via TRPC or Rho-GTPase) dashed square. (A) Diabetic Nephropathy. Under
  hyperglycemia, nephrin endocytosis can be induced by the interaction of β-arrestin2
  with PKC-α (, ). Increased AngII (, ) and Claudin-1 (, ) in diabetes were both shown
  to reduce expression of nephrin and podocin. On the contrary, increased TRPC6 expression
  mediated by AngII was seen in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats causing podocytopenia
  and proteinuria (, ). Hyperglycemia also leads to podocyte apoptosis from production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through NAPDH oxidase (NOX) (), so as does insulin
  resistance due to reduced AKT pro-survival signaling (). (B) Minimal Change Disease.
  Mutations of nephrin (NPHS1) and podocin (NPHS2) have been reported in MCD and tended
  to have higher rates of steroid-resistance (, , ), as well as recessive mutations
  of KANK (kidney ankyrin repeating-containing protein) KANK1 and KANK2 identified
  in a cohort of Arab and European origins (). Cofilin-1, actin-binding protein necessary
  for maintaining podocyte architecture (), is inactivated by phosphorylation seen
  in human MCD, leading to its redistribution to nucleus in the disease states ().
  A novel molecule c-mip noted to be upregulated in human MN/MCD was shown to impair
  podocyte actin reorganization by inhibiting interaction between Fyn/N-WASP and nephrin/Nck.
  Podocyte overexpressed with c-mip could result in downregulation of nephrin and
  synaptopodin (, , ). (C) Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Multiple gene
  mutations have been identified in patients with FSGS through genetic studies. Most
  of them encode various critical podocyte structures or signaling pathways, such
  as SD complex (NPHS1, NPHS2, CD2AP), SD-related Ca2+signaling (TRPC6, PLCE1), actin
  cytoskeleton/endocytosis (ACTN4, INF2, FAT1, MYO1E), and small-GTPases (AHRGP24,
  ARGHDIA, ARHGEF17) (–). A novel mechanism of increased podocin endocytosis via sorting
  nexin 9 (SNX9), which is seen in human IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy and
  FSGS was also described (). Blocking the imbalanced TRPC5/6 signaling and increased
  circulating permeability factors (suPAR/CLC-1) are possible new therapeutic approaches
  in FSGS. (D) Membranous Nephropathy. Besides the well-known antibody-mediated primary
  MN (anti-PLA2R/THSd7A), reduced nephrin phosphorylation () and increased podocin
  endocytosis () have been described in human MN. Disorganization of actin cytoskeleton
  from a different cytoskeletal pathway Cas-FAK-Crk1/2 activation (not the typical
  nephrin-Nck pathway) was also seen in human MCD and MN (). Mutation (red thunder
  ) of proteins, inhibiting (red cross) or activating (yellow star) different signal
  pathways leads to reduced level of phosphorylation, increased intracellular calcium
  and endocytic process. AngII, Angiotensin II; c-ABL, Abelson murine leukemia viral
