caption: Rapid-acting antidepressants, including ketamine, LY341495, and GLYX-13 increase
  phospho-ERK and BDNF release via an activity dependent mechanism. This could occur
  via inhibition of NMDA receptors on tonic firing GABAergic neurons resulting in
  disinhibition of glutamatergic activity and a burst of extracellular glutamate.
  LY341495 blocks mGlur2/3 receptors that can be located on glutamate presynaptic
  terminals and regulate glutamate release. Increased release of glutamate leads to
  activation of AMPA receptors and depolarization of postsynaptic neurons resulting
  in activation of voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) and subsequent BDNF
  release and TrkB receptor activation. TrkB receptors stimulate ERK and the mTORC1
  signaling pathway, including pS6K resulting in increased translation of synaptic
  proteins, such as GluR1 and PSD95 required for synaptogenesis. The activity dependent
  action of these agents was confirmed in the current study by demonstrating that
  the neuronal silencing agent muscimol and the AMPA antagonist NBQX block the increase
  in phospho-ERK and BDNF release. A role for BDNF-TrkB signaling was demonstrated
  by blockade with the TrkB antagonist K252a.
