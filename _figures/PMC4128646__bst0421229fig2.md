caption: (A) PABP1 enhances global translation by binding to the poly(A) tail and
  interacting with factors at the mRNA 5′-end to recruit ribosomal subunits. (B) PABP1
  stabilizes mRNAs by blocking access of deadenylases to the poly(A) tail, but also
  recruits deadenylases to the mRNA. This may be linked to translational termination.
  (C) An example of an mRNA-specific role in stability where PABP1 interaction with
  3′-UTR-binding proteins blocks deadenylation and endonucleotic cleavage within the
  3′-UTR. (D, panel i) PABP1 plays a role in correct termination at stop codons ensuring
  that the nonsense-mediated decay pathway is not activated. (D, panel ii) PABP1 does
  not participate in termination at premature termination codons (PTCs), termination
  is aberrant and mRNA decay ensues. (E) PABP1 enhances miRNA-mediated translational
  repression and deadenylation via its interaction with the miRNA-containing RISC
  complex. (F) An example of PABP1 acting in mRNA-specific translational repression
  when bound as part of a 5′-UTR repressive complex that blocks ribosome assembly.
  (G) PABP1 can act as an mRNA-specific activator when recruited to the 3′-UTR by
  other RNA-binding proteins or regulatory elements.  summarizes functions shown for
  different family members in the species discussed in this Figure.
