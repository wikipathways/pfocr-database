caption: Eicosanoid biosynthesis and PGE2 signaling via EP receptors. (A) Biosynthesis
  of eicosanoids relies on the release of free arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane
  phospholipids via phospholipase A2 (PLA-2) or conversion of diacylglycerol to AA
  through phospholipase C (PLC). An alternative source of AA includes 2-arachidonoylglycerol
  (2-AG). AA is converted to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) via the action of COX enzymes,
  COX-1 and COX-2. PGH2 can be converted to other derivatives, including PGE2 by PGE
  synthases. (B) PGE2 stimulates at least four different G-protein coupled receptors
  (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4). Stimulation of EP2 and EP4 receptors lead to an increase
  in intracellular cAMP levels by conversion of ATP to cAMP by adenylate cyclase (AC),
  while EP3 decreases intracellular cAMP levels by binding to the inhibitory G-protein
  subunit to AC upon PGE2 stimulation. The EP4 receptor stimulates PI3K pathway independent
  of cAMP, such as by modulating gene expression via NF-κB. EP1 activity is linked
  to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by activating the phospholipase C pathway.
