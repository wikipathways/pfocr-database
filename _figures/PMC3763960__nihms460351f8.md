caption: (A) Loss of Etv1 uncovers the existence of an alternate (Alt.) NT3-activated
  signaling pathway that is progressively activated with increased NT3/TrkC signaling.
  The relative weight of both pathways is a function of the ambient levels of muscle-derived
  NT3. Both Etv1 and Alt. pathways may control pSN survival and/or subtype specialization,
  with afferents from hypaxial, axial and certain limb muscles (limbs) primarily dependent
  on Etv1 signaling, whereas afferents from other limb muscles show an intermediate
  requirement (limbi) for Etv1 or are refractory (limbr) to the loss of Etv1.(B) Intersection
  of TrkC, Rx3, and Etv1 signaling pathways in pSN differentiation. At early stages
  (e12.5) Rx3 solidifies pSN identity by repressing TrkB and promoting TrkC expression,
  whereas later (>e13.5) Rx3 activity levels control the extent of pSN collateral
  projections into the ventral horn (). Varying levels of Etv1-dependency reflect
  the differential requirement for Etv1 in the development of distinct, muscle-specific,
  pSN subtypes.
