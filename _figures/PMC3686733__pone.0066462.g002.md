caption: 'From the left to the right: import and metabolism of glycerol derivatives
  and dicarboxylic acids; import of mono- and disaccharides and their entry into the
  glycolytic pathway (GP); metabolism of ascorbic acid; mixed acid fermentation utilizing
  GP products; high affinity phosphate and ammonia import and metabolism; NADPH generation
  and menaquinone/menaquinol cycle; glutamate decarboxylase acid resistance system
  (Gad); oxygen-dependent and -independent electron transport chains; *periplasmic
  electron transporters. Symbols/color codes: substrates and products of pathways
  are denoted in black script, proteins in red script (if increased in abundance in
  vivo), in blue script (if there was no abundance change but high expression in vitro
  and in vivo), in green script (if decreased in abundance in vivo); full arrows indicate
  a catalytic step, dotted arrows a transport step. In the top right corner, seven
  global transcriptional regulators are depicted; their color-coded symbols are included
  in the graphic to illustrate where they influence gene expression. The area between
  the green line (outer membrane) and inner line (inner membrane) represents the periplasmic
  space.'
