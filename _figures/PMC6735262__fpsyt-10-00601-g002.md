caption: Schematic presentation of presynaptic DA regulation. Conversion of l-tyrosine
  (4-hydroxyphenylalanin) to l-3, 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine [l-DOPA] constitutes the
  first step in a complex pathway of DA synthesis. l-tyrosine is derived mainly from
  dietary sources, although a small quantity originates from l-phenylalanine converted
  to l-tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PHA). l-tyrosine is converted to l-DOPA
  by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAADC) then acts
  on l-DOPA to convert it to DA. The DA uptake transporter (DAT) plays an additional
  role in increasing cytoplasmic DA levels via the reuptake of extracellular DA and
  thus maintains extracellular DA homeostasis. From the cytoplasm, the majority of
  DA is stored in specialized synaptic vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter
  (VMAT) and is ready for release upon arrival of the action potential.
