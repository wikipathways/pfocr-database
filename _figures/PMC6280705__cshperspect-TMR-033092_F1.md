caption: Overview of the general eukaryotic translation initiation pathway. The pathway
  for recruiting initiator transfer RNA (tRNA) to the messenger RNA (mRNA) AUG codon
  in the context of an 80S ribosome (bottom right) is depicted as a series of major
  steps, labeled with blue text, linked with black arrows. Individual eukaryotic initiation
  factor (eIF) cartoons and complexes are labeled with black text and nucleotide hydrolysis/inorganic
  phosphate release reactions are shown by blue arrows. The broad green arrow indicates
  the direction of scanning toward the AUG codon. The regulatory reactions leading
  to eIF2 and eIF4E inhibition are shown with plum and red arrows. All steps are described
  in the main text, starting with eIF2 activation. The timing of release of some factors
  from initiating ribosomes/mRNA (eIF4F, eIF4B, or eIF3) is not yet clear, so this
  is not shown.
