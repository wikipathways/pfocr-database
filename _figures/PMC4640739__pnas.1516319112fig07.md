caption: Working model for Mek/Erk signaling in mouse ESCs. (A) Mek might suppress
  the expression of pluripotency genes through Erk-dependent and -independent pathways.
  In addition to its role in repressing Prdm14 and Nanog, Erk signaling is required
  for cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and telomere-length maintenance
  as well as suppression of apoptosis. (B) Upon Erk KO, Mek and its Erk-independent
  pathway are activated (marked by a red arrow) to perturb the pluripotency regulation
  network.
