caption: A model for CAFs governing TNBC tumour progression through microenvironmental
  GPER‐mediated glutamine metabolism. Cytoplasmic GPER activated by estrogen in CAFs
  upregulated GLUL and LDHB expression via the cAMP/PKA/CREB signalling pathway, promoting
  glutamine synthesis. GPER‐induced glutamine is secreted into the extracellular microenvironment,
  where TNBC cells uptake and metabolize it to enhance their glutamine metabolism.
  During this process, lactate can increase the transport of glutamine to breast cancer
  cells. GPER‐associated glutamine boosts the malignant potential of TNBC cells
