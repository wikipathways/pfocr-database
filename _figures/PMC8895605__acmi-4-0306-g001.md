caption: Canonical sphingolipid metabolic pathway. The de novo step (entry point)
  in the pathway, which is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase, is conserved
  across all sphingolipid-producing organisms. Ceramide (d18 : 1/16 : 0) is a core
  sphingolipid from which a wide diversity of complex sphingolipids are produced.
  Alternatively, ceramide may be catabolized into sphingosine (d18 : 1). Phosphorylation
  of d18 : 1 produces the well-characterized signalling sphingolipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate
  (S1P). The exit point of the pathway is marked by another pyridoxal phosphate-dependent
  enzyme, S1P lyase.
