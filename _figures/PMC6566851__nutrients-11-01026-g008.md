caption: 'Crosstalk of signaling pathways under butyrate influence. Butyrate can inhibit
  VEGF through HDACs, which results in decreased VEGFR-mediated angiogenesis. Decreased
  VEGF also leads to decreased cell-cycle/cell proliferation mediated by Akt and metastasis
  by its receptor NPR-1. Decreased Akt also results in increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and
  thus increased apoptosis. Decreased Akt could also contribute decreased IL-6 and
  IL-17 by butyrate. Apoptosis could also be caused by signaling from Fas/FasL and
  butyrate receptors GPRs. GPRs crosstalks with Fas/FasL through promoting TNF-alpha
  secretion. They also activate p38 MAPK to cause apoptosis. Butyrate can also block
  MiR-106B and MiR-17-92a to decrease cell cycle/cell proliferation. Inhibition of
  HDACs and inflammation by butyrate result in decreased activity of the STAT3 pathway,
  which also contributes to cell proliferation, survival and metastasis through its
  downstream. Butyrate activates PKC and Wnt to cause cell differentiation. Wnt can
  also activate the PKC pathway to form crosstalk. Abbreviations: Akt, protein kinase
  B; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma 2; Bax, Bcl-2-associated X protein; HDACs, histone deacetylase;
  IL-6, interleukin 6; IL-17, interleukin 17; NPR1, neuropilin 1; PKC, protein kinase
  C; Rac1, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1; STAT3, signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3; TNF-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha; VEGF, vascular
