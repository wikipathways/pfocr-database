caption: A different gender susceptibility and clinical course in diseases during
  ageing could be caused by different Treg, Th17 and Th9 cell polarization. IFNγ and
  IL6 cytokine pathway alterations occur with ageing, and the consequences for men
  and women, in terms of pathological mechanisms and disease development, are different
  because the malfunctioning of gender specific pathways not only compromises the
  homeostasis of the immune response, but may also cause a pathological polarization
  of T cell subsets specific to each sex. The results of the above mentioned study
  [] indicate that a different gender susceptibility and clinical course in diseases
  during ageing is caused by different Treg, Th17 and Th9 cell polarization determined
  by the IFNγ and/or IL6 gender cytokine pathway interactions, which vary between
  men and women and with ageing []. Hence, autoimmune disease susceptibility in women
  could be attributed to the influence of ΙL6 which plays a key role in autoimmune
  diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, since it is a T cell differentiation switch
  factor for Tregs and Th17 cells. The greater likelihood of men developing the primary
  progressive multiple sclerosis form, on the other hand, could be the results of
  the influence of IFNγ on Th9 cell inhibition. Level variation of "dual gender specific
  cytokines" (for example IFNγ-IL10, IL6-IL4 and IFNγ-IL4 in men) in a direction that
  agrees with the positive or negative sign of their healthy relationship (in this
  case positive), it is an index for a transient inflammation, because it is still
  an indicator of immune system homeostasis; the level variation of "dual gender specific
  cytokines" in a direction that does not agree (in this case negative) with the positive
  or negative sign of their healthy relationship, it is index for a chronic inflammation,
  because it is an indicator of loss of homeostatic ability.
papertitle: The discovery of how gender influences age immunological mechanisms in
  health and disease, and the identification of ageing gender-specific biomarkers,
  could lead to specifically tailored treatment and ultimately improve therapeutic
  success rates.
