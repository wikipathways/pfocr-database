caption: 'RP105 activates MyD88-independent manner of CD19 + B lymphocyte and promote
  CD19+ B lymphocyte to derive into osteoclast. RP105/CD19 initiates Lyn activation
  and phosphorylation then promotes MyD88-independent osteoclast different manner
  of CD19+ B lymphocyte via two major pathways: (1) promote IκBα to promote NF-κB
  signaling (; ), activate JNK, MEK/ERK to promote MAPKs signaling pathway (; ; ),
  as well as activate Akt to promote PI3K-Akt signaling pathway though a Vav-associated
  manner (); (2) activate PI3K 110δ to inhibit IFN-α and promote PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway through Btk-associated manner (). At the same time, Btk also directly promote
  osteoclastogenesis though Ca2+signaling pathway, however, Lyn also inhibit PLCγ-mediated
  Ca2+signaling (; ). As a result, the regulate signaling axis of osteoclastogenesis
  in CD19+ B lymphocyte remain to be further discussed. Figure was created using BioRender.com.'
