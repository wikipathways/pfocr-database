caption: 'Interplay between signaling and metabolic pathways in small cell lung carcinoma.
  The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is frequently affected in SCLC. The mTOR kinase forms
  the catalytic subunit of two distinct multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2.
  The mTOR complexes regulate metabolic processes: mTORC1 promotes protein and nucleotide
  synthesis, whereas lipid metabolism can be influenced by both mTORC1 and mTORC2
  []. Besides the mTOR pathway, MYC alterations can also affect bioenergetic processes,
  such as glycolysis, nucleotide synthesis, and glutamine metabolism []. In contrast,
  metabolic changes can influence the activity of signaling pathways. mTORC1 is inhibited
  under energetic stress or hypoxia; additionally, its activity is regulated by the
  availability of certain amino acids, such as leucine and arginine []'
