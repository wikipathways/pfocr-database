caption: Mechanisms of SPOC and COC.(A) In budding yeast, the spindle position checkpoint
  (SPOC) prevents exit from mitosis and cytokinesis if the mitotic spindle (green
  bar) fails to orient along the mother-daughter axis. The function of the SPOC is
  to keep the small GTPase Tem1 in the GDP-inactive state on the daughter-bound SPB.
  Tem1 activation is required to trigger the mitotic exit network (MEN) signaling
  cascade (a pathway that leads to inactivation of mitotic Cdk1). The most downstream
  SPOC component, Bub2 and Bfa1, form a GAP complex that keeps Tem1 inactive. If the
  spindle is misoriented, the mother cell enriched kinase Kin4 prevents the inactivation
  of the Bub2-Bfa1 GAP complex through the phosphorylation of Bfa1 at the SPBs. If
  the spindle is correctly aligned, Kin4 activity is inhibited, in part by the Lte1
  protein (which is confined in the daughter cell body). Exclusion of Kin4 from the
  daughter cell compartment allows the inactivation of the Bub2-Bfa1 GAP complex by
  the polo-like kinase Cdc5, thereby facilitating mitotic exit (see text for details).(B)
  In Drosophila male GSCs, a surveillance mechanism (centrosome orientation checkpoint;
  COC) monitors correct centrosome orientation with respect to the hub cells. When
  the centrosomes (green dots) are misoriented (i.e. neither of the two centrosomes
  is located close to the hub-GSC junction), GSCs do not enter mitosis until the correct
  centrosome orientation is re-acquired. Cnn is a component of the centrosome (green
  dots), while E-cadherin is a component of the adherens junction (orange).
