caption: β-Arrestin-dependent endocytosis and signalling of GPCRs. Agonist activation
  promotes the GRK2-mediated phosphorylation that promotes the translocation and binding
  of β-arrestins, which serves to uncouple receptors from heterotrimeric G-proteins.
  β-Arrestins function as adaptor proteins that interact with both clathrin and β2-adaptin
  promoting the clathrin coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis of many GPCRs. c-Src
  is recruited to GPCRs as a consequence of its interaction with β-arrestin and couples
  the receptor to the MAPK pathway. β-Arrestin interactions with a variety of proteins
  allows for the coupling of GPCRs to a variety of different signal transduction pathways
  whose activation may be independent of heterotrimeric G-proteins. β-Arr, β-arrestin;
  P, phosphate.
