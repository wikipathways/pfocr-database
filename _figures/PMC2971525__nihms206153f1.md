caption: DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathways in normal and malignant cells. In normal
  cells, different types of genotoxic stress (e.g., DNA double-strand breaks) or DNA
  replication stress elicit DDR as part of the self-defense system. This involves
  the activation (via phosphorylation) of “sensor” kinases, ATM and ATR, which in
  turn activate Chk2 and Chk1 checkpoint kinases, respectively, all leading to phosphorylation
  of histone H2AX at the sites of DNA damage. These events invoke multiple downstream
  pathways which, depending on the extent of DNA damage, induce either cell cycle
  arrest (permitting DNA repair) or apoptosis (in case of irreparable DNA damage).
  Thus, cell cycle arrest can result from Chk1/2-dependent activating phosphorylation
  of p53 tumor suppressor gene or inactivating phosphorylation of Cdc25 family phosphatases
  which lead, respectively, to an upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
  p21Waf1, or inhibition of CDK2 activity by rendering it in an inactive (phosphorylated)
  state. Alternatively, Chk1/2-dependent activation of p53 can induce apoptosis via
  upregulation and activation of a subset of pro-apoptotic proteins. A similar apoptotic
  effect may result from ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the nonreceptor tyrosine
  kinase c-Abl, which phosphorylates and activates the p53-related protein p73,, leading
  to induction of pro-apoptotic genes in a manner that overlaps with the effect of
  p53 (reviewed in ref. ). Interestingly, besides promoting cell cycle arrest, DDR-triggered
  inhibition of CDK2 may also contribute to the induction of pro-apoptotic genes by
  rendering the transcription factor FOXO-1 in its active (unphosphorylated) state.
  In accordance with the data obtained by Oka et al. colon tumorigenesis is associated
  with a gradual activation of the upstream DDR elements (ATM, Chk2 and H2AX) but,
  paradoxically, this does not result in an increased apoptosis induction, suggesting
  that malignant transformation may result in impairments of the DDR pathways downstream
  from Chk1/2 and the ATM-cAbl pathway (indicated by red crosses).
