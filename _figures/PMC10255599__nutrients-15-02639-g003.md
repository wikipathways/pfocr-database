caption: 'Anti-oxidant and anti-thrombotic activity of Vitamin D and Resveratrol in
  COVID-19. Oxidative stress affects platelet function. Adhesion molecules, complements,
  and procoagulant factors trigger endothelial dysfunction, increased leukocyte and
  platelet reactivity, and activation of coagulation. Vitamin D/VDR prevents ROS-mediated
  activation of NLRP3 by Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus, inducing its transcriptional
  activity for antioxidant enzymes to inhibit oxidative stress. Vitamin D increases
  the levels of SERPINC1 transcripts and antithrombin. Resveratrol moderates ROS and
  NOS, inhibits arachidonic acid metabolism and hampers Ca2+ entry into platelets.
  Resveratrol exerts antithrombotic properties by increasing the activity of nitric
  oxide endothelial synthase (eNOS) and NO levels. Resveratrol-induced NO production
  results from its direct interaction with SIRT1 and Nrf2. Resveratrol exerts anti-inflammatory
  effects inhibiting HMGB1-mediated signaling pathway. Abbreviations: Ca2+—Calcium
  ion; eNOS—nitric oxide endothelial synthase; HMGB1—high-mobility group box 1; NET—neutrophil
  extracellular traps; NLRP3—NLR family pyrin-domain-containing 3; NOS—nitric oxide
  synthase; Nrf2—nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2; ROS—reactive oxygen
  species; SERPINC1—serpin family C member 1; VDR—vitamin D receptor'
