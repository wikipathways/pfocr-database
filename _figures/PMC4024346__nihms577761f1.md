caption: Model of the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling network controlled by receptor tyrosine
  kinases and Ras. ERK1/2 is part of a three kinase cascade involving BRaf/Raf1 and
  MEK1/2. MAP3K1 (also known as MEKK1) and Tpl2/COT (also known as MAP3K8) function
  as MAP3Ks that can also phosphorylate and activate MEK1/2 and regulate and bypass
  Raf inhibition. ERK1/2 phosphorylate upstream kinases including BRaf/Raf1 and MEK1
  to feedback inhibit their activity. ERK1/2 also phosphorylates and inhibits the
  Ras guanine nucleotide exchange activity of SOS.
