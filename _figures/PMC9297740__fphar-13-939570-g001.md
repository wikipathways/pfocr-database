caption: 'Role of PARP inhibitor drugs in TMZ resistance. At physiological pH, TMZ
  will be converted into MTIC and this MTIC is further hydrolyzed to methylhydrazine.
  The cytotoxicity of TMZ drug depends on the methylating/alkylating ability of methylhydrazine
  at the N7 or O6 positions of guanines or the O3 position of adenines in genomic
  DNA. Methylation at O6 position of guanine causes the addition of thymine rather
  than cytosine nucleotide opposite to methylguanine during the subsequent process
  of DNA replication, which triggers the death of tumor cells. The principal pathway
  involved in TMZ resistance development is the activation of DNA repair pathways
  (MGMT, MMR, and BMR). PARP is a class of enzyme that is being involved in the MGMT
  pathway by physically interacting with and PARylates MGMT as an effect of TMZ treatment
  to eliminate adducts of O6-MetG present in the damaged DNA strand. PARP inhibitors
  usually reduce the binding of PARP-MGMT along with PARylation as well as silencing
  of MGMT expression for O6-MetG repair. Hence, diminishing MGMT activity and rendering
  sensitization to TMZ. In the MMR pathway, the O6-meG:C pair gets mismatched after
  the first round of replication and results in O6-meG:T formation in the progeny
  DNA. The MMR system repairs the mismatch of O6-meG:T, by detaching the thymine-containing
  patch of newly generated strand, utilizing the number of complex proteins such as
  MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2, respectively. Furthermore, PARP is a part of the BER
  complex that comprises XRCC1 protein, DNA ligase, and the DNA polymerase beta and
  is involved in BER in response to SSBs. PARP inhibitors reduced PARP binding in
  the BER complex, thus, reducing BER function to repair SSBs. Abbreviation: PARPI,
