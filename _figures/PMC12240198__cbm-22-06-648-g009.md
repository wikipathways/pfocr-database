caption: The schematic diagram illustrates the synergistic anti-tumor effect of the
  combination of mitochondrial transplantation and cisplatin. Mitochondrial transplantation
  combined with cisplatin inhibited tumor stemness by diminishing HIF-1α and reducing
  lactate accumulation. Mitochondrial transplantation plus cisplatin triggered the
  ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The combination of mitochondrial transplantation
  and cisplatin boosted T and NK cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity by preventing the
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway to inhibit tumor development. Representations shown in Figure
  9 were created with figdraw.com
