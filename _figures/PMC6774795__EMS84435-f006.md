caption: The nutrient signaling pathway imposes an ‘anabolic capacity’ barrier over
  B cell activation by T cell help and BCR signaling, so that growth only occurs upon
  nutrient sufficiency. RagC mutations weaken this barrier to allow B cell activation,
  while still retaining the ability to suppress activation upon profound reduction
  in nutrient levels. During lymphomagenesis, these mutations enhance B cell growth
  and survival but impose a selective vulnerability to pharmacological inhibition
  of mTORC1.
