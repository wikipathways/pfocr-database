caption: Lipid Pathways Located at MAM. MAM Serve as Cellular Platforms where a Number
  of Enzymes Implicated in Lipid Metabolism Pathways are Located. This figure summarizes
  the key pathways associated with lipid metabolism located at MAM, representing ER
  in blue and mitochondria in red. On the left, the enzymes SPTLC1/2 catalyze the
  formation of 3KS, a precursor of sphingolipid synthesis. On the middle left, PSS1/2
  enzymes generate PS at MAM, which is then transported to the mitochondria where
  it is transformed into PE by PSD. On the middle of the panel, StAR and TSPO are
  shown, both involved in cholesterol import into the mitochondria, regulating steroid
  synthesis. On the middle right, cholesterol esterification by MAMlocated ACAT1 (SOAT1)
  is shown, which produces accumulation of CE. Finally, by the combined action of
  ACSL, SCD and DGAT (also located at MAM), fatty acids are incorporated into triacylglycerides.
  Cholesterol esters and triacylglycerides can be stored in lipid droplets. ACAT1
  = acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1; ACSL = long-chain acyl-coA synthetase;
  CE = cholesterol esters; DGAT = diacylglycerol acyltransferase; 3KS = 3-keto-sphinganine;
  PE = phosphatidylethanolamine; PS = phosphatidylserine; PSD = phosphatidylserine
  decarboxylase; PSS1/2 = phosphatidylserine synthase 1/2; SCD = stearoyl-CoA desaturase;
  SPTLC1/2 = serine palmitoyltransferase 1/2; TAG = triacylglycerides; TSPO = translocator
