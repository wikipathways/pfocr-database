caption: Model of inhibition of TSHR/IGF-1R crosstalk by targeting TSHR and/or IGF-1R.
  Activation of the TSHR by GO-Igs stimulates two signal transduction pathways − one
  that is independent of IGF-1R (dark gray arrow) and another that is dependent on
  IGF-1R, which is the crosstalk pathway (light gray arrows). The activated TSHR engages
  the IGF-1R in a signalosome that is scaffolded by β-arrestin 1 (β-ARR), and this
  crosstalk induces the synergistic increase in HA secretion. As TSHR and IGF-1R signal
  in concert in the pathogenesis of TED, therapeutic interventions that target both
  receptors may be desirable. In contrast to antigen-specific immunotherapies which
  use peptides of sequences in the extracellular domain of the TSHR, inhibitory TSHR
  antibodies (Abs) and small molecule TSHR antagonists directly target the TSHR and
  inhibit signaling. TSHR-blocking antibodies inhibit TSHR activation by binding to
  the extracelluar domain (ECD) of the TSHR thereby inhibiting GO-Igs from binding.
  Drug-like, small molecule TSHR antagonists bind to allosteric sites in the transmembrane
  domain (TMD) of TSHR and inhibit activation by hindering signal transduction through
  the TSHR from the extracellular to the intracellular domain which subsequently inhibits
  interaction of the receptor with G proteins and other intracellular signaling molecules.
  IGF-1R-inhibiting antibodies, like 1H7 and teprotumumab, bind to IGF-1R and inhibit
  IGF-1R crosstalk with TSHR. It is conceivable that a combination therapy with TSHR
  and IGF-1R antagonists may have therapeutic benefits as it could minimize drug side
  effects due to dose reduction and may compensate for any loss of anti-IGF-1R efficacy.
