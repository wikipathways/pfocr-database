caption: Fetal tissues are noted in red shades, and maternal tissues in blue shades.
  The figure bottom compares mechanisms of allorecognition in the field of transplantation
  (gray shaded area) vs pregnancy, highlighting current knowledge. In mouse gestation,
  DCs develop relatively late, and a fairly low number of maternal leukocytes traffic
  to the fetal tissues. Thus, maternal T cells are unable to recognize allo-MHC molecules
  on fetal DCs mobilized to the mother’s SLTs (via the direct allorecognition pathway).
  Furthermore, because trophoblastic EVs do not express classic (highly polymorphic)
  MHC molecules on their surface, they are not recognized by directly alloreactive
  T cells on the surface of maternal APCs, when cross-dressed with the EVs (via the
  semi-direct allorecognition pathway, gray shaded area). Instead, feto-placental
  EVs may interact with maternal decidual uNK cells, macrophages, T cells, blood vessel
  cells, and decidual stromal cells, or traffic through peripheral blood or lymph
  to the maternal SLTs (spleen, uterus-draining lymph nodes), where the EVs are internalized
  and processed by maternal APCs (bottom blue shaded area.) In mice, fetus-derived
  antigenic peptides are presented within maternal MHC molecules by maternal APCs
  (likely conventional DCs) to T cells via the canonical pathway (also known, in transplantation,
  as the indirect pathway.) Feto-placental EVs could also be presented to maternal
  B cells by subcapsular sinus (SCS) macrophages in lymph nodes (or analogue macrophages
  in the spleen) of by follicular DCs located deep in B cell follicles.
