caption: A model for Xio1 in XA21-mediated immunity. XA21 constitutively associates
  with somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2 (SERK2) (). A ROS-scavenging enzyme,
  APX, catalyzes the removal of H2O2 (ROS) (; ). XA21-mediated immunity is triggered
  by recognition of the sulfated microbial peptide, RaxX-sY, secreted from Xoo ().
  Upon the recognition, XA21 activates SA/ET-dependent defense responses and produces
  ROS rapidly (; ). Activation of SA/ET-mediated signaling pathway induces a set of
  defense-related genes and Xio1, which negatively regulates APX expression. Down-regulation
  of APX leads to additional ROS accumulation, which in turn induces immune response
  including the expression of PR genes and LOX. SA/ET-JA antagonism is a key strategy
  for the expressional regulation of Xio1, although the molecular mechanism remains
  to be investigated.
