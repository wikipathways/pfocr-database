caption: 'Summarizing Figure. Cellular effects of two TLR4-activators on MoDCs: LPS
  (A) and NiSO4(B). (A) LPS-treatment induced a metabolic shift toward glycolysis
  and a weak Nrf2-dependent stress response. IPA pathway analysis revealed a strong
  upregulation of interferon signaling. (B) NiSO4-treated cells showed a distinct
  upregulation of glycolytic enzymes both on mRNA and protein level, suggesting metabolic
  reprogramming and hypoxia-like conditions. The metal allergen NiSO4 also triggered
  a pronounced Nrf2-dependent stress response that culminated in upregulation of Nrf2-target
  genes. Most strikingly, NiSO4 induced a cellular cholesterol depletion in MoDCs,
  which was reflected in the upregulation of genes and proteins involved into cholesterol
  biosynthesis. We speculate that haptenation to other cellular proteins than TLR4
  also contributed to the observed changes. A blue arrow indicates downregulation
  and red arrows indicate upregulation. A pronounced change is indicated by two arrows.'
