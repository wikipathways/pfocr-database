caption: Schematic of the promotion of EMT by XBP1. The IRE1-XBP1 signalling pathway
  is key in regulating EMT. This pathway can directly (e.g., binding to the promoters
  of EMT transcription factors) or indirectly (e.g., activating downstream signalling
  pathways such as TGF-β/Smad2/3, NF-κB or c-Src (a 60 kDa nonreceptor tyrosine kinase
  encoded by the SRC gene) regulate the expression of EMT-associated transcription
  factors, which can promote the EMT process, and enhance the migration and invasive
  ability of cells. Notably, indirect regulatory pathways (e.g., TGF-β/Smad and NF-κB,
  etc.) dominate the process. IRE1α, inositol requiring enzyme 1α; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; BiP, binding immunoglobulin protein;
  XBP1, x-box-binding protein 1; SNAL1, snail family transcriptional repressor 1;
