caption: 'Extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The intrinsic pathway is mediated
  by intracellular signals of cell stress leading to an increase in the BH3 only proteins
  (members of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family) resulting in an inhibition of
  the protectors and activation of the effectors. The effectors Bax and Bad increase
  the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane (MOMP: mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilisation) resulting in leakage of apoptotic proteins. One of these proteins,
  known as second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC), binds to proteins
  that inhibit apoptosis (IAPs, by suppression of the caspase proteins) causing an
  inactivation of these IAPs. Another protein released from the mitochondria is cytochrome
  c, which binds to Apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and ATP. This
  complex binds to procaspase-9 creating a complex, the apoptosome. The apoptosome
  cleaves procaspase-9 to its active form of caspase-9, which in turn is able to activate
  the effector caspase-3. The extrinsic pathway is mediated through receptors of the
  tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR) family either via the TNF path or the
  Fas (first apoptosis signal) path. In the TNF path binding of TNF-α to a trimeric
  complex of TNFR1 molecules induces activation of the intracellular death domain
  and the formation of the receptor-bound complex 1 made up of TNF receptor-associated
  death domain (TRADD), receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), two ubiquitin
  ligases (TNFR-associated factor (TRAF)-2 and cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (clAP)1/2)
  and the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC). This complex 1 can lead to a
  pro-survival pathway or to apoptosis. In case of apoptosis the TRADD dependant complex
  IIa (consisting of TRADD, Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase-8)
  or the RIPK-1 dependant complex IIb also known as the ripoptosome (consisting FADD,
  RIPK1, RIPK3 and caspase-8) is formed. In the Fas path, presence of the Fas ligand
  (FasL, expressed on cytotoxic T lymphocytes) causes three Fas receptors (CD95) to
  trimirize. This clustering and binding to the FasL initiates binding of FADD. Three
  procaspase-8 or -10 molecules can then interact with the complex by their own death
  effector domains. The complex formed is the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC)
  which cleaves and activates procaspase-8 and 10. Activation of the initiator caspase-8
  by both paths directly activates other members of the caspase signalling cascade
  such as the effector caspase-3 but also can lead to an increase in BH3-only proteins
  (Bim, Bid) and trigger the intrinsic pathway).'
