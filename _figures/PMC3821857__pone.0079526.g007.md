caption: Left, physiological function of DOK2 in normal lung cells in regulation of
  the EGFR pathway. EGFR activation via ligand binding of EGF induces both KRAS activation
  (red arrow) and a negative feedback loop involving recruitment of DOK2 (black arrow)
  and RASA1. Right, pathogenic loss of DOK2 and deregulation of the EGFR signaling
  pathway. Loss of DOK2 (gray) results in decreased recruitment of RASA1 (blue), allowing
  enhanced downstream activation of KRAS following EGFR mutation and activation (yellow).
