caption: Diagram representing lymphocyte stimulation and inhibition pathways. Schematically,
  lymphocyte stimulation leads to two different activation pathways. The first pathway
  consists in the activation of the calcineurin phosphatase. This enzyme rapidly dephosphorylates
  NFAT, which then translocates into the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor.
  NFAT regulates the expression of genes implicated in early activation of human T
  cells, and is involved in the activation of the IL-2 promoter. The second pathway
  consists in activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway. AKT
  and mTOR activation inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) activity. GSK-3β
  ensures the phosphorylation of NFAT, which then remains inactive as transcription
  factor in cytoplasm of quiescent cells. GSK-3β inhibition by AKT and mTOR allows
  NFAT dephosphorylation and its nuclear translocation. FK506 binds to the membrane
  receptor FKBP and FK506-FKBP forms a complex with calmodulin and calcineurin subunits
  A and B, leading to the inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase activity. NFAT remains
  phosphorylated and sequestrated in cytoplasm. Rapamycin blocks lymphocyte stimulation
  by inhibiting mTOR, and wortmannin blocks lymphocyte stimulation by inhibiting AKT.
  These two immunosuppressors thereby lead to the activation of GSK-3β and induce
  the inactivation of NFAT by its phosphorylation and nuclear export. Aphidicolin,
  which blocks DNA synthesis, did not cause changes in telomerase activity. Thus,
  all three immunosuppressors, FK506, rapamycin, and wortmannin, may inhibit NFAT
  as a transcription factor, and we showed that all of these compounds provoke the
  inhibition of hTERT mRNA expression. We could then postulate that NFAT may induce
  hTERT transcription.
