caption: Role of pyruvate in neurodegeneration. Normal metabolic pathways of astrocyte
  and neuronal metabolism and pathological pathways of Alzheimer’s’s and Parkinson’s
  disease are drawn with black arrows. The gray arrows show the therapeutic pathway
  of exogenous pyruvate administration. In Alzheimer’s disease, ROS activates BACE1
  and stabilizes HIF-1α, which further upregulates BACE1 levels. BACE1 produces Aβ,
  which has been shown to activate membrane-bound NADPH-oxidase leading to increased
  ROS production. HIF-1α also increases PDK levels leading to an inhibition of PDH.
  Peroxidation of lipids by ROS creates acrolein, which further inhibits PDH. Accumulation
  of Aβ has been shown to decrease glucose uptake by astrocytes, through a yet to
  be defined mechanism. The decrease in glucose uptake leads to a decrease in ATP
  fueling the Na/K ATPase, which is coupled to EAAT in order to clear glutamate from
  the synapse. The lingering glutamate in the synapse causes excitatory neurotoxicity.
  In Parkinson’s disease, the metabolism of DA by the outer mitochondrial membrane-bound
  MAO creates ROS. Furthermore, in Parkinson’s disease, PGC-1α, the transcription
  factor regulating election transport chain and pyruvate metabolism enzymes, is downregulated
  leading to decreased pyruvate metabolism. MPC mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, PYR
  pyruvate metabolism gene set, NADPH OX NADPH oxidase, MAO monoamine oxidase, DAT
