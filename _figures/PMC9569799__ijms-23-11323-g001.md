caption: 'Scheme of the NHEJ repair pathway, including the resection-dependent compartment
  and the resection-independent compartment. # refers to the percentage of the resection-dependent
  compartment. Red and blue arrows respectively refer to the steps of the fast and
  slow processes, and the gray ones have shared steps.'
