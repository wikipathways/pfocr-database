caption: ErbBs structure and signaling mechanism. (A) Schematic representation of
  the role of ErbBs in signal transduction. Only some of the signaling pathways are
  represented here. The cross on ErbB3 kinase domain indicates its weak activity.
  ErbB2 is shown in its constitutively dimerization-prone conformation. (B) The different
  steps of ErbB signal transduction, with the example of ErbB1 ligand EGF triggering
  ErbB1/2 heterodimerization, ErbB1 kinase activation, and Ras/MAPK pathway activation
  through binding of the adaptor protein Grb2. (C) Model structure of activated full-length
  EGFR from structures and models of individual domains. A model for the C-terminal
  tail (CT) is lacking. Reproduced with permission from []. (D) Overall domain organization
  of EGFR and ErbB2 with numbering. For the ECD, in orange are leucine-rich repeat
  domains (domains I and III), and in blue are cystein-rich domains (domains II and
  IV). The Uniprot numbering is used (unless otherwise stated) in this review. For
  EGFR, the alternative numbering sometimes used excludes the signal peptide in the
  N-terminus. For ErbB2, the alternative numbering is that of rat ErbB2 (neu). In
  the CT, all tyrosine positions are indicated, with * on the ones that are known
  autophosphorylation sites.
