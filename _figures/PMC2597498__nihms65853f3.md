caption: 'The eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex consists of: eIF4E, the
  subunit that binds to the 5′ cap and thus brings the complex to the mRNA; eIF4G,
  the scaffolding protein to which the other components bind; mitogen-activated protein
  kinase-interacting kinase 1 (Mnk1), an eIF4E kinase; and eIF4A, an RNA helicase.
  The functionality of the eIF4F complex relies on the association between eIF4E and
  eIF4G. However, the binding of 4E-BP to eIF4E displaces eIF4E from eIF4G and the
  remainder of the complex, and thus inhibits cap-dependent translation. mTOR complex
  1 (mTORC1) controls whether or not 4E-BP binds eIF4E by controlling 4E-BP phosphorylation.
  When mTORC1 is active, under positive growth conditions (a), it phosphorylates 4E-BP,
  which is therefore unable to bind to eIF4E. Thus, eIF4E is free to bind to eIF4G,
  which completes the eIF4F complex on the 5′ cap and permits translation to proceed.
  Under negative growth conditions, for example, during stress or the inhibition of
  mTORC1 by rapamycin (b), mTORC1 is inactive; 4E-BP therefore becomes hypophosphorylated
  and binds efficiently to eIF4E, thereby removing it from the eIF4F complex and inhibiting
  cap-dependent translation.'
