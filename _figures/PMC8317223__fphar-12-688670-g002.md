caption: In vitro metabolic pathways of GM in rat and human microsomes. The metabolic
  pathway of GM is the same in humans and rats (). However, the CYP isoforms involved
  in each metabolic pathway differ between humans and rats (; ). In humans, GM was
  dehydrogenated and/or hydroxylated by CYP3A4, demethylated or hydrated by CYP2C19,
  and demethylated or hydroxylated by CYP2D6. Of these CYP isoforms, CYP3A4-mediated
  hydroxylation is the major pathway of GM metabolism (). In rats, GM was dehydrogenated
  and/or hydroxylated by CYP3A2, demethylated and dehydrogenated and/or hydroxylated
  by CYP1A1, demethylated, hydroxylated, and hydrated by CYP2C11, and demethylated
  and hydrated by CYP2D1 ().
