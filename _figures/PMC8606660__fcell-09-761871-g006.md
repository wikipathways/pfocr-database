caption: Hippo-dependent and Hippo-independent regulation of YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ are
  known to be regulated via the HIPPO signalling pathway and by a mechanically regulated
  HIPPO-independent mechanism. (Left) HIPPO control of YAP and TAZ. The HIPPO pathway
  regulates organ growth as well as cell proliferation, migration and differentiation.
  In tightly packed tissues, proliferation is regulated by contact inhibition via
  the HIPPO pathway. Tight junctions and adherens junctions between cells interact
  with and activate MST1/2, which recruit SAV1, and subsequently phosphorylate LATS1/2.
  This phosphorylation is facilitated by the scaffold proteins MOB1 A/B and NF2. In
  turn, LATS1/2 phosphorylate YAP/TAZ, leading to cytoplasmic sequestering of these
  proteins, and their eventual ubiquitination/degradation. F-actin has been proposed
  to regulate YAP/TAZ localisation via the HIPPO pathway by inhibiting LATS1/2 and/or
  upstream factors, thus preventing phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of YAP/TAZ.
  (Right) ECM stiffness also regulates YAP/TAZ in a HIPPO-independent mechanism. Cells
  interact with their ECM via integrins; in stiff environments, focal adhesion assembly
  is promoted, which activates Rho-ROCK signalling, which in turn activates F-actin
  stress fibre formation and translocation of YAP/TAZ to the nucleus, where these
  proteins regulate gene expression via activation of TEAD1-4. External application
  of force to the nucleus has also been shown to open nuclear pores and allow increased
  YAP/TAZ entry into the nucleus. Cytoskeletal inhibitors affect different parts of
  the mechanotransduction pathway; Y-27632 inhibits ROCK, Latrunculin A inhibits F-actin
  polymerisation and Blebbistatin inhibits Myosin (all depicted in red). MST1/2, mammalian
  ste-20-like kinases 1/2; SAV1, salvador family WW domain containing protein 1; LATS1/2,
