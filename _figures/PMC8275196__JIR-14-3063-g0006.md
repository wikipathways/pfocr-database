caption: The underlying mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of melatonin in
  Parkinson’s disease. The NLRP3 inflammasome is assembled and activated in microglia
  when MPTP acts as the priming signal (signal 1), and ATP or nigericin acts as the
  activation signal (signal 2). Once the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated, it cleaves
  pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β and promotes the release of ASC specks. However, melatonin
  can negatively regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation via the SIRT1-dependent pathway
  and protect dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson’s disease.
