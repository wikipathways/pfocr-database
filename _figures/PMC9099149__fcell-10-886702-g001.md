caption: Role of activated αvβ3 integrin in TM cells. (A) The active conformation
  of αvβ3 integrin can be triggered by a process called outside-in signaling in which
  an ECM ligand binds to the extracellular domain of the heterodimer and triggers
  the upright conformation. Alternatively, a process called inside-out signaling can
  induce the active conformation. This happens when a secondary signaling pathway
  triggers the binding of cytoplasmic proteins (orange oval) to the cytoplasmic tails
  of the integrin causing the cytoplasmic tails to separate and the heterodimer to
  assume an upright conformation. (B) During the early stages of focal adhesion (FA)
  formation, actin filaments are generated when activated αvβ3 integrin signaling
  recruits GEF-H1, RhoA and the Rho effector mDía to nascent FAs. Stress fibers in
  FAs are then formed when signaling from α5β1 integrins recruit RhoA and Rho kinase
  (ROCK) to the FA and myosin is activated and binds to actin filaments. (C) Cooperative
  crosstalk between activated αvβ3 and β1 integrins forms CLANs. αvβ3 integrins utilize
  Src kinase to help recruit the GEF Trio and Rac1 to FAs while β1 integrins utilize
  Src kinase and PI3-kinase. The question mark in the α subunit indicates that α1,
  α2, α4, or α5 integrin subunits may be involved. (D) Transdominant crosstalk between
  αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins inhibits αvβ5 integrin-mediated phagocytosis which involves
  the GEF Tiam1 and Rac1. αvβ3 integrin inhibits this process presumably because it
  prevents αvβ5 integrin from using Rac1 to form the branched actin structure used
  to form a phagocytic cup. (E) Upon binding of soluble fibronectin to α5β1 integrins
  (Step1), cooperative signaling between αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins in FAs creates the
  RhoA-mediated contractility needed for fibronectin fibrillogenesis (; ). While αvβ3
  integrins remain in FAs, presumably to help anchor stress fibers, α5β1 integrins
  are translocated out of FAs by contractile forces into fibrillar adhesions (Step2).
  This α5β1 translocation promotes the stretching of the fibronectin dimer which exposes
  fibronectin-fibronectin binding sites involved in fibronectin fibrillogenesis.
