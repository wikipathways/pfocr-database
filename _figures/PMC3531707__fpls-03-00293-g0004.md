caption: IRE1 signaling and virus infection in animals and plants. In animals, IRE1
  oligomerizes in the plane of the ER membrane in stressed cells, leading to trans-autophosphorylation
  and activation. Activated IRE1 mediates the sequence-specific cleavage of the XBP1
  mRNA in higher eukaryotes, deleting a small RNA fragment (intron) and finally producing
  a spliced mRNA (XBP1s) with a frame shift in the coding sequence. Spliced XBP1s
  encodes a potent transcriptional activator (XBP1s), whereas the unspliced XBP1 mRNA
  (XBP1u) encodes an inhibitor of the UPR (XBP1u). In mammals, it seems that XBP1s
  regulates a subset of UPR genes that promote ERAD of misfolded proteins and refold
  proteins. In cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells, activated IRE1 can promote
  the cleavage of mRNAs, including XBP1 mRNA, leading to their degradation. This reduces
  the load on the stressed ER and might facilitate reprogramming of the ER-associated
  protein synthesis and translocation machinery. In cells infected by viruses such
  as HCV, the IRE1 pathway is manipulated by the virus via repressing the transcriptional
  activity of XBP1s. In addition, some viruses might also promote the IRE1-dependent
  mRNA decay as a means to manipulate the IRE1 pathway. In plants, IRE1 homologs were
  detected in the genomes of Arabidopsis and rice a decade ago. However, the target
  of IRE1 was not identified until 2011. The mRNA of transcriptional factor bZIP60
  is the substrate of IRE1 in plants. Similar to XBP1 in animals, unspliced bZIP60
  (bZIP60u) is processed by activated IRE1. The protein product (bZIP60s) translated
  from the spliced bZIP60 (bZIPs) is translocated into the nucleus to activate the
  expression of UPR genes such as chaperones. Different from XBP1u, plant bZIP60u
  protein, translated from bZIP60u mRNA, is retained in the ER membrane. Sensing unfolded
  proteins in the ER lumen, bZIP60u undergoes a proteolytic processing, releasing
  bZIP60s. A recent study has shown that the expression of bZIP60 was increased by
  PVX infection. However, the roles of the UPR pathway in virus infection have only
  begun to be investigated in plants. Critical unanswered questions need to be addressed
  in the future, such as whether viruses modulate the IRE1 pathway via inhibiting
  the transcriptional activity of bZIP60s (indicated by “?”).
