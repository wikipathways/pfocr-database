caption: A. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 participate in cancer pathogenesis
  by underwriting biosynthetic programmes and promoting proliferation and survival.
  Emerging evidence also implicates mTORC2 activity in metastatic transformations.
  B. Modulation of mTORC1 signalling in ageing cells may enable us to slow the molecular
  clock. mTORC1 activates processes that may accelerate cellular and tissue ageing,
  including protein synthesis, mitochondrial energy production and entry into senescence.
  Chronic mTORC1 activation also blocks autophagic clearance of damaged cellular components.
  Inhibition of this pathway — by either rapamycin treatment, genetic inactivation
  of mTORC1 or dietary restriction — has been shown to extend lifespan and improve
  physiological performance across a range of model organisms. 4E-BP, 4E-binding protein;
  HIF1α, hypoxia inducible factor 1α; PKC, protein kinase C; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; SGK, serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase; S6K1, p70 S6 kinase
  1; SREBP, sterol regulatory element binding protein.
