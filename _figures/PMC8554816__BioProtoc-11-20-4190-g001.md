caption: 'In the chloroplast, SOD scavenges O2- produced in PSII to form O2 and H2O2
  molecules. APX mediates the scavenging of H2O2 with AsA as the electron donor, leading
  to the generation of MDHA. MDHA is also generated through the oxidation of AsA mediated
  by AO. MDHA further involves two distinct processes: (i) being reduced back to AsA
  through MDHAR with NADH as the electron donor, and (ii) being dissociated to generate
  DHA. DHAR mediates the reduction of DHA to AsA with two molecules of GSH as the
  electron donor. GR regulates the reduction of GSSG to GSH with NADPH as the electron
  donor. O2-, superoxide; SOD, superoxide dismutase; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; APX,
  ascorbate peroxidase; AsA, ascorbic acid/ascorbate; AO, ascorbate oxidase; MDHA,
  monodehydroascorbate; MDHAR, monodehydroascorbate reductase; NADH/NAD+, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; DHA, dehydroascorbate; DHAR, dehydroascorbate reductase; GSH,
