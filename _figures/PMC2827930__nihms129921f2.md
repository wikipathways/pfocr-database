caption: The Core Notch Signaling Pathway is mediated by regulated proteolysis. Upon
  translation, the Notch protein is glycosylated by O-fut and Rumi, which are essential
  for the production of a functional receptor. The mature receptor is produced after
  proteolytic cleavage by PC5/furin at Site 1 (S1) and thereafter targeted to the
  cell surface as a heterodimer held together by non-covalent interactions. In cells
  expressing Fringe, the O-fucose is extended by the glycosyltransferase activity
  of Fringe, altering the ability of specific ligands to activate Notch. The Notch
  receptor is activated by binding to a ligand presented by a neighboring cell. Endocytosis
  and membrane trafficking regulate ligand and receptor availability at the cell surface.
  Ligand endocytosis is also thought to generate sufficient force to promote a conformational
  change that exposes Notch to cleavage at site S2 by ADAM metalloproteases (perhaps
  following heterodimer dissociation at S1). Juxtamembrane cleavage at S2 generates
  the membrane-anchored NEXT (Notch extracellular truncation) fragment, which is a
  subtrate for the γ-secretase complex. γ-secretase cleaves the Notch TMD progressively
  (from site S3 to S4; see ) to release NICD (Notch intracellular domain) and Nβ peptides.
  γ-secretase cleavage can occur at the cell surface or in endosomal compartments
  however cleavage at the membrane favors the production of more stable form of NICD
  (see text for details). In the absence of NICD, the DNA-binding protein CSL associates
  with ubiquitous corepressor (Co-R) proteins and histone deacetylases (HDACs) to
  repress transcription of target genes. When NICD enters the nucleus, its binding
  to CSL may trigger an allosteric change that facilitates displacement of transcriptional
  repressors. Mastermind (MAM) then recognizes the NICD/CSL interface, and this tri-protein
  complex recruits coactivators (Co-A) to activate transcription.
