caption: Schematic representation of the action of Leu and its metabolites. Solute
  carrier family 7 member 5 (SLC7A5) transports extracellular Leu into the cells.
  Amino acid sensors, namely leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LARS1) and sestrin 2 (SESN2),
  detect cytosolic Leu. SESN2 alleviates the inhibitory function of GTPase-activating
  protein toward Rags 1 (GATOR1) and GTPase-activating protein toward Rags 2 (GATOR2),
  leading to the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
  signaling pathway, which further promotes muscle protein synthesis (MPS). Leu metabolites
  also promote MPS via mTORC1. Branched-chain amino transferase 2 (BCAT2) converts
  Leu to α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), which phosphorylates p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase
  1 (RPS6KB1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1),
  both markers of mTORC1 activation, thereby increasing MPS. KIC can be further metabolized
  to β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) by KIC dioxygenase and to isovaleryl-CoA by
  branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC). Rag GTPases are crucial
  in this pathway. RagA/B typically bind GTP when Leu is abundant, while RagC/D are
  in the GDP-bound state. The RagA–RagC and RagB–RagD heterodimers are key pairs interacting
  with mTORC1 on the lysosomal membrane, activating it in response to Leu and promoting
  MPS. Both HMB and isovaleryl-CoA are involved in energy production. HMB increases
  MPS by activating the AKT1-mTORC1 signaling pathway. However, whether HMB promotes
  MPS via the AKT1-mTORC1 axis is not fully characterized, as the effect of HMB on
  the tuberous sclerosis complex 1-tuberous sclerosis complex 2-TBC1 domain family
  member 7 (TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7) complex, the intermediate between AKT1 and mTORC1. Arrows
  stand for “activation”, “stimulation”. Bars stand for “inhibition”. Question mark

  description: Schematic representation of the action of Leu and its metabolites.
    Solute carrier family 7 member 5 (SLC7A5) transports extracellular Leu into the
    cells. Amino acid sensors, namely leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LARS1) and sestrin 2
    (SESN2), detect cytosolic Leu. SESN2 alleviates the inhibitory function of GTPase-activating

    leading to the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
    signaling pathway, which further promotes muscle protein synthesis (MPS). Leu
    metabolites also promote MPS via mTORC1. Branched-chain amino transferase 2 (BCAT2)
    converts Leu to α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), which phosphorylates p70 ribosomal protein
    S6 kinase 1 (RPS6KB1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding

    KIC can be further metabolized to β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) by KIC dioxygenase
