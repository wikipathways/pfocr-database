caption: Signaling pathways aberrantly expressed in PTCLs. The aberrant cytoskeleton
  dynamics and regulation in PTCLs is sustained by several mechanisms. TCR signaling
  pathway is often constitutively active in PTCLs leading to an aberrant RhoGTPase
  signaling cascade and downstream effects. In anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL),
  the nucleophosmin (NPM)–anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion hyperactivates Rac1
  and Cdc42 leading to the constitutive activation of downstream effectors (PAK, Tiam1,
  WAVE and N-WASP), to the increase of F-actin nucleation and polymerization and to
  an altered microtubules dynamic. ALK fusion proteins can directly phosphorylate
  signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 leading to its localization
  into the nucleus where, in association with C/EBPB, repress the expression of WASP.
  Moreover, NPM-ALK directly inhibits RhoA to regulate cytoskeleton tension and directly
  phosphorylates WASP to promote its proteasome-dependent degradation. In ALK-ALCL
  subtype, activating mutations affecting cytokine receptors, Janus kinases (JAKs)
  and STAT3 lead to the constitutive activation of this pathway. The aberrant transcription
  of lncRNA BlackMamba, of DNA helicase HELLS and a set of genes regulating cytoskeleton
  architecture (PAK2, RhoU) leads to a reduction in the amount of F-actin. Mutations
  in the gene encoding RhoA (G17V) is detected in a subset of angioimmunoblastic T
  cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL)-NOS and in adult T cell
  leukemia (ATLL). This mutation contributes to cellular transformation preventing
  the activation of wild type RhoA, enhancing the expression of co-stimulatory molecules
  (ICOS), which in turn contributes to increased PI3K and MAPK signaling and by reducing
  the formation of stress fibers. Mutations in the gene encoding Vav1 are found in
  ATLL, in PTCL-NOS and AITL. These mutations lead to the hyperactivation of RhoGTPAses
  and their downstream targets increasing of F-actin nucleation and polymerization.
  AURKA is overexpressed in ALK+ and ALK− ALCLs, PTCLs-NOS and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas
  (CTCLs). Its overexpression leads to hyperactivation of PLK1 and its downstream
  targets as well as to hyperactivation of HDAC6 and enhanced microtubules stability.
