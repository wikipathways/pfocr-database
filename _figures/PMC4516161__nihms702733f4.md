caption: Proposed mechanism of CIB1 regulation of TNBC cell survival and potential
  role of CIB1 in non-oncogene addiction. a CIB1 promotes TNBC cell survival, proliferation,
  and tumor growth via AKT and ERK signaling pathways. b CIB1 depletion results in
  loss of AKT and ERK. This effect is mediated in part by PAK1, but also likely involves
  additional, undetermined factors (dotted line). CIB1 depletion is most effective
  in PTEN-deficient cells and/or cells with elevated AKT activation. Because PTEN
  also acts as an upstream regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling, inactivating mutations
  or deletions of PTEN commonly result in hyper-activation of this pathway. Thus,
  TNBC cells with low or absent PTEN show increased sensitivity to CIB1 depletion.
  Together with the observations that CIB1 depletion/loss has minimal effect on non-cancerous
  cells [] or TNBC cells with wild-type PTEN, our findings suggest a role for CIB1
  in the concept of non-oncogene addiction
