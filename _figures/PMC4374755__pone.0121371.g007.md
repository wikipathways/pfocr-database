caption: (A) DNA-PKcs and TLR9 are involved in activation of Akt and mTORC1 by CpG-ODN.
  In response to CpG-ODN, DNA-PKcs associates with Akt, leading to its phosphorylation
  and activation of downstream event mTORC1, which phosphorylates S6K, which in turn
  phosphorylates S6. S6K may involve expression of IFNα/β induced by CpG-ODN. Also,
  CpG-ODN binds and activates TLR9, which in turn recruits MyD88 and IRAK4 leading
  to activation of Akt and mTORC1. (B) DNA-PKcs and TLR9 are important for the IFNα/β
  response to CpG-ODN. In response to CpG-ODN, DNA-PKcs associates with TRAF3 and
  activates IRAK1, leading to activation of IKKα and subsequent secretion of IFNα/β,
  which activate Stat1. Also, in response to CpG-ODN, TLR9 recruits MyD88, which in
  turn recruits and activates TRAF3 and IRAK4. Activated IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1,
  which then recruits TRAF6 and phosphorylates IKKα, leading to expression of IFNα/β
  and phosphorylation of Stat1.
