caption: Role of inflammatory response, cytokine storm, and monocyte recruitment in
  endothelial vascular dysfunction (endothelialitis) during coronavirus disease 2019
  (COVID-19) [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection].Angiotensin
  (Ang)-II is formed from the cleavage of Ang-I by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).
  Ang-II binds to Ang-II type 1 (AT1R), and type 2 (AT2R) receptors. ACE2 is a monocarboxypeptidase
  homologous to ACE the active site of which is exposed at the extracellular surface.
  Ang II can be hydrolyzed into Ang(1-7) through the actions of ACE2. The polypeptide
  Ang I can be converted into Ang(1-7) by the actions of neprilysin (NEP). Ang(1-7)
  activates the G-protein-coupled mitochondrial assembly (MAS) receptor (MASR). The
  soluble form of ACE2 (sACE2) circulates in the blood. In COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2),
  the proinflammatory response and cytokine storm represent the cornerstone of COVID-19
  pathogenesis, inducing critical incidences for the host. A cytokine profile in COVID-19
  is characterized by increases in various endogenous compounds, such as interleukin
  (IL) -6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and the Notch 1-4 pathway. Suppressor
  of the cytokine signaling proteins (SOCS 1/3) regulate the immune response.
