caption: 'Vaccine response and the potential impact of dupilumab. Dupilumab is a human

  IL‐4R receptor type I and II, decreasing the signal induced by IL-4 and IL-13. a
  T cell-dependent response vaccines generate humoral and cellular responses with
  immune memory. After recognition of the antigen, APCs (B cells, macrophages, or
  DCs) present the processed antigen to naive T cells via peptide-MHC II. Co-stimulation
  between B7 ligands (CD80/CD86) and CD28 on the T cell is required. The type of pathogen
  determines the cytokine environment, which dictates the development of a specific
  T cell phenotype. IL-12, secreted by the DC in response to virus infection or intracellular
  bacteria, promotes polarization towards the TH1 pathway, which secretes IFNγ and

  IL-4 initiates polarization to TH2 pathways and inhibits TH1 development. Via activation
  of STAT6 and GATA3, IL-4 promotes gene expression of IL‐4, IL‐5, and IL‐13. APCs
  trigger a TH2 cell response in the presence of thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-25,
  and IL-33 produced by epithelial cells. TH2 responses drive B cell activation, requiring
  co‐stimulatory signals through the CD40–CD40L (CD154) from the TH cell and leading
  to differentiation into a plasma cell, isotype class switching, antibody secretion
  and clonal expansion of memory B cells. IL-4 acts as a B cell growth factor, and
