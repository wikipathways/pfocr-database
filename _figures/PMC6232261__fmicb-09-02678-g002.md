caption: A model for controlling the balance between PhoR autokinase and phosphatase
  activities in B. subtilis and B. spizizenii generated by intermediates in wall teichoic
  acid metabolism. In B. subtilis and B. spizizenii it is proposed that autokinase
  and phosphatase modes of PhoR activity are determined by WTA biosynthetic intermediates
  levels. (A) The metabolic pathway for WTA biosynthesis in B. spizizenii is shown
  with the final Lipid V product being composed of poly(ribitol phosphate) attached
  to a lipid carrier (jagged lines) by a linker composed of pyrophosphate, modified
  sugars (GlcNAc, ManNAc) and a single glycerol phosphate moiety. The genomic organization
  of the biosynthetic genes is shown in the box. It is proposed that the TarA or TarB
  enzyme product activates PhoR autokinase activity (arrows with broken lines to indicate
  a putative interaction). The level of activating intermediate will be determined
  by the balance between WTA and teichuronic acid synthesis in phosphate limited cells
  because of the reciprocal relationship between these two metabolic pathways. (B)
  The metabolic pathway for WTA biosynthesis in B. subtilis is shown with the final
  Lipid V product being composed of poly(glycerol phosphate). The genomic organization
  of the biosynthetic genes (in box) shows that the tagAB operon is repressed by activated
  PhoP∼P (-). It is proposed that the TagA or TagB enzyme product activates PhoR autokinase
  activity (arrows with broken lines). However, in B. subtilis Lipid V composed of
  poly(glycerol phosphate) can inhibit PhoR autokinase activity (shown in vitro, blue
  line with block). Thus the balance between PhoR autokinase and phosphatase activities
  will be determined by the level of the activating intermediates (TagA or TagB, black
  arrows), by the extent to which teichuronic acid synthesis is activated and WTA
  synthesis is repressed by PhoP∼P and by the level of the inhibitory Lipid V composed
  of poly(glycerol phosphate), blue line with block).
