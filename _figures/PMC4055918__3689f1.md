caption: Hemolysis releases erythroid DAMP molecules to drive vascular injury and
  sterile inflammation, which contribute to the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease.
  Hemolysis releases cell free hemoglobin (Hb), which is normally scavenged by haptoglobin
  and CD163. Free hemoglobin reacts with and scavenges NO via the dioxygenation reaction
  and also reacts with hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton
  reaction. This process leads to endothelial dysfunction and pathological vascular
  remodeling. Oxidized hemoglobin releases free heme, which can trigger a sterile
  inflammatory reaction involving TLR4 activation, and stimulates neutrophils to release
  NETs. These inflammatory events are proposed to cause vasoocclusion and acute chest
  syndrome in sickle cell disease. There are several potential therapies using the
  indicated agents (shown in red text) that target multiple stages of this proposed
  pathophysiological pathway. RBC, red blood cell. Professional illustration by Debra
  T. Dartez.
