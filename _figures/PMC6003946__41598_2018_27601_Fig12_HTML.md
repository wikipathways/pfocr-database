caption: Schematic representation of the role of SLIT2-ROBO1/ROBO2 in the regulation
  of ovarian prehierarchical follicle growth and development mediated by the CDC42-RAFs-ERK1/2
  MAPK cascade in hens. (1) The SLIT2 ligand interacts with ROBO1 and/or ROBO2 in
  an autocrine or paracrine manner and activates its downstream mediator SRGAP1 of
  SLIT/ROBO signaling. (2) Following the stimulation of the activated SRGAP1, the
  expression level of the activated endogenous GTP-binding CDC42 protein is down-regulated
  to enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of CDC42 by stimulating GTP hydrolysis.
  Then, the activity levels of its downstream PAK effectors are attenuated, finally
  leading to the inhibitory effects of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway on cell proliferation,
  differentiation and follicle selection. (3) The inhibitory effect of SLIT2-ROBO1/2
  on GC proliferation, differentiation and follicle selection may be mainly mediated
  by CDC42/PAK1 via the MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling cascade and partially mediated by PAK2
  and PAK3. (4) The effect of the inhibition of ERK1/2 induced by the interaction
  between SLIT2 and ROBO1/2 on the transcription of FSHR, GDF9, STAR and CYP11A1 mRNA
  in the nucleus. (5) The reduced transcript and protein expression levels of FSHR
  may decrease the capacity of the FSHR to response to FSH. FSH-induced cell signaling
  via the protein kinase A/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway has been
  shown to be required for initiating differentiation in granulosa cells during follicle
  selection,,,.
