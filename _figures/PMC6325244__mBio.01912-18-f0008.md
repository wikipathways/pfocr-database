caption: Schematic representation of the linear recruitment pathway of the divisome
  and a regulation model of the septal synthase subcomplex (FtsW-PBP3-PBP1b) by FtsBLQ,
  FtsN, and the lipoprotein LpoB. (A) Linear recruitment pathway of the divisome with
  the septal peptidoglycan (sPG) synthesis core shown in a frame; protein-protein
  interactions are shown with arrows. (B) Topology of the synthase subcomplex and
  the regulatory proteins (FtsBLQ, FtsN, and LpoB) in the cell envelope. FtsBLQ subcomplex
  inhibits the GTase activity of PBP1b (via FtsL) and the TPase domain of PBP3 (via
  FtsQ). Interaction of FtsN via the essential region (EFtsN) and of LpoB with PBP1b
  suppresses the inhibition by FtsBLQ, activating PBP1b and probably the whole synthase
  subcomplex. Interaction of FtsN with FtsA and LpoB with the outer membrane allows
  the coordination of sPG synthesis with cytoplasmic, inner (IM), and outer membrane
  (OM) events. CCD, constriction control domain of FtsL.
