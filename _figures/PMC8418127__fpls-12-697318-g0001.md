caption: Biosynthetic pathway of avenacin in the roots of Avena strigosa. Avenacin
  biosynthesis starts with the conversion of 2,3-oxidosqaulene to β-amyrin by Sad1
  (Saponin deficient 1). Conversion of β-amyrin to 12β,13-epoxy 16β, 23-dihydroxy-β-amyrin
  that occurs in the cytosol is mediated by Sad2, Sad6 and CYP94D65, respectively.
  12β,13-epoxy 16β, 23-dihydroxy-β-amyrin is subsequently conjugated with one arabinose
  and two glucose moieties for the formation of des-acyl avenacin. Two glycosylation
  steps occur in the cytosol catalyzed by A. strigosa arabinosyltransferase (AsAAT1)
  and AsUGT91G16 (UDP-glucosyl transferase). The final glucose moiety is added by
  a unique vacuolar glycosyltransferase A. strigosa transglucosidase 1 (AsTG1). Des-acyl
  avenacin is acylated by Sad7 aided by acyl donors such as N-methyl anthranilate
  glucopyranose (NMA-Glc) to form avenacin A1, in the vacuole. NMA-Glc is formed from
  anthranilic acid through a two-step reaction catalyzed by Sad9 and Sad10, respectively.
  Genes of the plant metabolic gene cluster encoding enzymatic reactions are indicated
  in red arrows. Dotted arrows represents multi-step pathway.
