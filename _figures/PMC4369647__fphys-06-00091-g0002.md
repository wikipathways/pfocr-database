caption: Signaling pathway associated with CD37 ligation by SMIP-016. Lapalombella
  et al. described a number of cytoplasmic proteins which can associate with CD37,
  as depicted in the diagram. Ligation by SMIP-016 leads to phosphorylation Tyr13
  within an ITIM-like motif found in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, which associates
  with a complex of proteins that includes Syk, Lyn, and SHP1 (which likewise become
  phosphorylated). In addition, SMIP-016 induces phosphorylation of an ITAM-like motif
  (containing Tyr274 and Tyr280) located in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail that recruits
  PI3Kδ. Mutational studies suggest that the events requiring the N-terminal ITIM
  drive apoptosis, while the C-terminal tail has a role in promoting cell survival.
  The proposed mechanism of anti-CD37 induced cellular death involves a balance between
  these signals, with preferential SHP1 activation driving apoptosis. SHP1 is capable
  of inactivating both PI3K and Akt. SMIP-016 decreases the nuclear localization of
  Akt, preventing phosphorylation of FoxO3a (and promoting retention in the nucleus)
  to allow transcription of pro-apoptotic BIM. An opposing signal is transduced through
  PI3Kδ recruited to the C-terminal ITAM, activating Akt and resulting in the downstream
  phosphorylation of GSK3β (which permits nuclear translocation of pro-survival β-catenin).
  However, the contribution of PI3Kδ to survival can be eliminated by either combination
  with a PI3K inhibitor or deletion of the ITAM-containing C-terminal domain of CD37.
  While both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signaling pathways that are activated
  upon ligation by anti-CD37 SMIP-016, those that promote cellular death predominate.
  Several other CD37-targeted antibodies directly induce leukemia cell death, presumably
  in a similar fashion as SMIP-016/TRU-016. However, they do not require additional
  receptor crosslinking (by use of anti-Fc antibody to amplify the signal) as was
  observed with SMIP-016.
