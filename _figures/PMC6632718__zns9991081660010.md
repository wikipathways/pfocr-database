caption: Conserved pathways control neurite degeneration. A, In mammalian sensory
  axons, BAX, likely through its action in the mitochondria, activates caspases and
  a parallel NAD+-sensitive pathway to execute axonal degeneration in response to
  trophic withdrawal. The two effector caspases 3 and 6 are activated by different
  mechanisms, caspase-6 by cleavage of the procaspase and caspase-3 through regulation
  by XIAP. In contrast, axonal destruction after severing occurs only through the
  NAD+-sensitive pathway. B, In the fly, developmental pruning of sensory neuron dendrites
  is initiated by the initiator caspase Dronc, which induces the severing of the dendrites.
  The effector caspases and the NAD+-sensitive pathway are then operating in parallel
  to execute the degeneration process.
