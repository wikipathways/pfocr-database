caption: Network revealing relationships of serum proteins showing change in expression
  in response to TBI and reversal with prophylactic treatment of GT3. Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis revealed proteins associated with cellular movement, immune cell trafficking,
  and inflammatory response. Proteins with red-fill backgrounds signify that these
  were down-regulated in response to TBI relative to no TBI. Proteins with no color-fill
  background were not identified in the MS analysis, but have a known relationship
  to proteins in the network.
