caption: 'The unfolded protein response illustrating the activation of PERK and increase
  of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), EIF2A-P, ATF4 and CHOP. One arm of the
  unfolded protein response, which appears to be elevated in motor neuron disease,
  is initiated by the activation of PERK. The schematic depicts this pathway and highlights
  the markers that are examined in this study (red boxes). They included: (1) BiP,
  a misfolded protein sensor; (2) ATF4, a transcription factor that is exempt from
  the global translational arrest that results is a consequence of the unfolded protein
  response; and (3) CHOP, a pro-apoptotic marker that is transcribed downstream of
  ATF4. ER = endoplasmic reticulum.'
