  percentage of signalling in which a clock gene has effect on this pathway. (B) Heatmap
  showing clock genes that have function (inhibit or activate). (C) This network shows
  the relationship between clock genes and pathways by a line connection. The solid
  line means activation, and the dashed line means inhibition. The number of patients
  with colorectal cancer (n = 461)
