caption: When unstimulated, only small amounts of NIK are expressed, which are immediately
  degraded by the TRAF3-TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complex. TRAF3 binds to NIK while TRAF2 acts
  as a bridge between TRAF3 and cIAP1/2, allowing for cIAP1/2-mediated lysine-48 polyubiquitination
  of NIK and subsequent proteasomal degradation. However, when a TNFR family member
  is activated, the TRAF3-TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complex is recruited to the receptor. This
  leads to an accumulation of TRAF2, which results in cIAP1/2 lysine-63 polyubiquitination
  and a shift in ligase activity of cIAP1/2 towards TRAF3 via lysine-48. The polyubiquitination
  and degradation of TRAF3 leads to an increase in NIK. Stabilized NIK is then free
  to interact with and phosphorylate IKKα. p100 is phosphorylated by active IKKα,
  further processed by lysine-856 polyubiquitinatation and degraded, leaving active
  p52. p52 and RelB are then free to translocate into the nucleus.
