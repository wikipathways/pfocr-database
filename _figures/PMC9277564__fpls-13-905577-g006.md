caption: The key genes in abscisic acid ABA (Left) and auxin IAA (Right) synthesis
  pathway. The DEGs (Pyrabactin resistance/pyr1-like (PYR/PYL), Serine/threonine protein
  phosphatase (PP2C), Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2), ABA
  responsive element binding factors (ABFs)) in invasive plant and hybrid under Cd
  stress were located in the ABA synthesis pathway, and the DEGs (Auxin receptor (TIR1),
  Auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA), Auxin response factor (ARF), Gretchen hagen
  3 (GH3), Small auxin-up RNA (SAUR)) were located in the IAA synthesis pathway.
