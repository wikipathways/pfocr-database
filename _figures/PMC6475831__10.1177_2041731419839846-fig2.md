caption: 'Regulation of intestinal organoid formation by different growth factors.
  (a) The biomolecule-signaling pathway-effect axis during construction of intestinal
  organoids. Arrows show activation of signaling pathway. Lines without arrowheads
  show inhibition of the signaling pathway. (b) Integration of several specific growth
  factors determines the differentiation direction of stem cells by regulating Wnt
  and Notch signaling pathways. For example, activation of Wnt and Notch signaling
  pathways causes self-renewal of stem cells. Inhibition of Wnt signaling pathway
  by IWP-2 leads to differentiation of enterocytes (VIL1+), while inhibition of Notch
  signaling pathway by DAPT leads to differentiation of other cell types such as goblet
  cells (MUC2+), enteroendocrine cells (CHGA+), and Paneth cells (DEFA5+) depending
  on the subsequent switch of Wnt signaling pathway. CHIR: CHIR99021; IL-2: interleukin-2;
  VPA: valproic acid.'
