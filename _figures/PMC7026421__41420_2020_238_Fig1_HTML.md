caption: While the Rho (Rho-GTP) is activated, sequential activation of Rho-kinase
  with p190A Rho-GTPase-activating protein (p190A Rho-GAP) occurs and then phosphorylates
  MLC. As a result, the increased phosphorylation of MLC leads to more accumulation
  of actomyosin, contributing to the expression of cadherin (E-cadherin or P-cadherin)
  and suppressing the transformed growth in cells and the induction of entosis. When
  the Rho (Rho-GTP) is activated, lack of p190A or presence of ROCK inhibitors suppresses
  the MLC to reduce the actomyosin, resulting in the inhibition of cadherin and promoting
  transformed growth in cells with the attenuation of entosis.
