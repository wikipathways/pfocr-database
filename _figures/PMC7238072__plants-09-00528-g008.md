caption: 'Schematic representation of the metabolic fates of Se in phototrophic organisms
  (plants and algae). (1) Selenate (Se(VI)) and selenite (Se(IV)) are the main forms
  of Se in aquatic environment taken up by algae. Once they have entered the cytosol,
  both ions are transported to the chloroplasts to be incorporated into selenocysteine
  (SeCys). (2) SeCys can be produced from Se(VI) through the sulfur assimilation pathway,
  which involves the enzymes Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) Sulfurylase (ATPS), Adenosine
  Phosphosulfate Reductase (APR), and Sulfite Reductase (SiR). (3) Activated Se(VI)
  (Adenosine Phosphoselenate, APSe) can be phosphorylated by Adenosine Phosphosulfate
  (APS) Kinase (APSK) to produce Phosphoadenosine Phosphoselenate (PAPSe), which is
  a precursor of secondary Se-containing metabolites. (4) Se(IV) can be converted
  to SeCys directly by Selenomethyl Transferase (SMT). (5) Alternative pathway of
  Se(IV) reduction and SeCys synthesis involves glutathione (GSH), with selenodiglutathione
  (GS-Se-SG) produced as an intermediate. (6) SeCys can be methylated by Selenocysteine
  Methyl Transferase (SeCysMT) to form Methyl Seleno Cysteine (MeSeCys), which can
  be further converted to Dimethyl Diselenenide (DMDSe) through the action of Homocysteine
  Methyl transferase. SeCys can be transported outside the chloroplast and be either
  (7) methylated to produce MetSeCys and DMDSe or (8) incorporated into proteins (via
  a specific mechanisms in Se-requiring microalgae). SeCys in the chloroplast can
  be converted to Selenohomocysteine, which is then transformed into Selenomethionine
  (SeMet) once delivered to the cytosol. (9) SeMet can be methylated to produce Methylselenomethionine
  (MeSeMet), which is further converted to Dimethyl Selenide (DMSe) by either (10)
  methyl methionine hydrolase or (11) Dimethylselenopropionate lyase (DMSP lyase).
  SeCys can also be broken into Alanine (Ala) and elemental Se (Se0) by the activity
  of Selenocysteine lyase (SL). OAS: O-acetyl serine, OASTL/CS: OAS Thiol lyase/ Cysteine
