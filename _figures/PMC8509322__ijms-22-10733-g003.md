caption: 'Putative salt tolerance mechanisms in an ideal halophyte plant (modified
  from Zhao et al. [], Arif et al. [], Arbelet-Bonnin et al. [], Tran et al. [], and
  Himabindu et al. []. The absorption of Na+ in plant cells is counterbalanced by
  active Na+ extrusion through SOS1 Na+/H+ exchanger (I). The RBOH-mediated ROS formation
  in the plasma membrane can activate ANN1-induced Ca2+-signaling pathway (I). The
  Na+ bound GIPCs can trigger Ca2+ influx through an unknown Ca2+ channel (I). Ca2+
  influx mediated by either ANN1 or GIPCs is essential for activating the SOS-signaling
  pathway (I). The SOS3 relays salt-triggered Ca2+ signals to SOS2 kinase, forming
  the SOS3-SOS2 protein complex that phosphorylates SOS1 to induce Na+ efflux (I).
  To maintain ion homeostasis, halophytes can also sequestrate excess Na+ into the
  vacuoles and/or excrete Na+ via two unique structures, namely salt glands and salt
  bladders (II and III). It is also possible to avoid excessive Na+ accumulation in
  the cytosol by sequestrating it into the vacuoles (IV). Predominantly, Na+-sequestration
  in the vacuoles is conferred by tonoplast-based Na+/H+ exchangers of the NHX family
  (e.g., NHX1 or NHX2), fueled by either H+-PPase or H+-ATPase pumps (IV). Another
  equally important mechanism of vacuolar Na+-sequestration is the efficient control
  of tonoplast slow vacuolar (SV) and fast vacuolar (FV) activating ion channels,
  which may allow vacuolar Na+ to leak back into the cytosol (IV). Once, if both channels
  are downregulated or blocked by choline, Na+ leakage is inhibited, resulting in
  an increased level of salt tolerance (IV). On the other hand, Cl− influx in the
  vacuoles is mediated by CLC (IV). To maintain cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis under saline
  conditions, the influx of Ca2+ into the vacuole is mediated by CAX1 (IV). In response
  to salt stress, halophytes often accumulate various osmoprotectants, including proline,
  total free amino acids, sugars, polyols, glycine betaine, and GABA, which play vital
  roles in conferring an efficient osmotic adjustment (V). In addition, changes in
  the levels of different phytohormones may also help in stress adaptation; for instance,
  increased ABA level aids in controlling stomatal closure to maintain better water
  status at the tissue level (VI). It is worth mentioning that changes in the levels
  of phytohormones (e.g., JA, SA, and GA) in halophytes under salt stress varies dependently
  on the type of halophytes (VI). Furthermore, excessive salt accumulation can trigger
  oxidative stress via overproduction of ROS, such as O2•– and H2O2 (VII). To fight
  against ROS-mediated oxidative damage, halophytes induce a vibrant antioxidant defense
  system by activating both enzymatic (SOD, CAT, APX, MDHAR, DHAR, GR, GPX, and GST)
  and non-enzymatic (AsA and GSH) antioxidants (VII). Abbreviations: ABA, abscisic
