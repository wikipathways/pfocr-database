caption: 'AA metabolism. AA is released from the cell membrane by PLA2. AA is mainly
  metabolized by three enzymes: COX, LOX and CYP450. The COX pathway (A) converts
  AA to prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The LOX pathway (B) metabolizes AA to LT,
  HETE and LX. AA is mainly metabolized into EET and HETE through the CYP450 pathway
  (C). EET is converted to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids by sEH'
