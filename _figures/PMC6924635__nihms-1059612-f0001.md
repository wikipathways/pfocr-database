caption: 'Exosome biogenesis and major exosomal cargoes. (1) Exosome biogenesis starts
  with the formation of an endosome from the plasma membrane. The successive inward
  budding of the endocytic vesicle generates ILV, which will generate a MVB. This
  step can be controled by two pathways; ESCRT-dependent (ESCRT 0-III complex) or
  ESCRT-independent (nSMase2). Exosomal cargoes approach the MVB membrane in order
  to be loaded into exosomes. Specifically, RNA-binding molecules bind to miRNAs (hnRNPA2/B1)
  and lncRNAs to sort them. Other molecules involved in exosomal cargo loading are
  tetraspanins: CD63, CD81, CD82 and CD9. The number of exosomes released by the cell
  can be regulated by the lysosomal degradation. In this situation, the MVB and a
  lysosome fuse together, degrading the MVB’s content. Rab27a/b GTPases regulate cellular
  vesicle trafficking. Microtubules guide the MVB to the cell membrane. Actin cytoskeleton
  also helps in the MVB docking. (2) The SNARE complex is responsible for the blending
  of plasma membrane with the MVB. When exosomes are delivered into the extracellular
  medium, they reach out target cells by using MHC and other transmembrane proteins
  and receptors. Exosomes can transport and transfer a huge variety of exosomal cargoes.
  (3) Microvesicle biogenesis follows a different pathway: budding of the plasma membrane
  produces microvesicles. hnRNPA2/B1: heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1;
  ESCRT: endosomal-sorting complex required for transport; MVB: Multivesicular Body;
  ILV: Intraluminal vesicle; SNARE: soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment
  protein receptor; MHC: major histocompatibility complex; MMP: matrix metalloproteinase;
  ADAM: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase'
