caption: Regulation of GLIS3 activity and function by an upstream primary cilium-associated
  signaling pathway. Several studies have provided evidence for the localization of
  GLIS3 to the primary cilium. TNPO1-GLIS3 interaction allows GLIS3 to enter the primary
  cilium, where it is transported to the tip of the primary cilium by the anterograde
  intraflagellar transport (IFT) system. We hypothesize that activation of a GPCR
  localized to the ciliary membrane by an external signal modulates GLIS3 activity
  possibly through posttranslational modification or proteolytic cleavage. This may
  lead to the generation of either a GLIS3 activator (GLIS3A) or GLIS3 repressor (GLIS3R).
  The retrograde IFT mediates the transportation of GLIS3 out of the primary cilium.
  GLIS3 then regulates target gene transcription after its translocation to the nucleus.
