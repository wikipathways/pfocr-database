caption: Hypergeometric distribution analysis of the enriched pathways of the 320
  genes commonly differentially expressed between the aging brain and in human lesional
  microdissected neurovascular units (NVUs). The 320 common differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) between the aging brain and cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs)
  [|FC| ≥ 1.5; p < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected] were organized into
  27 pathway clusters, where 12 were enriched (p < 0.05). A comparison of the results
  of the hypergeometric distribution of the enriched pathways of the (1) common DEGs,
  (2) DEGs only identified in the aging brain (Supplementary Fig. ), and (3) DEGs
  only identified in human CCM NVUs (Supplementary Fig. ) suggest the immune response
  and extracellular matrix organization functions dysregulated in the aging brain
  are common with CCMs
