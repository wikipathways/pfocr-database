caption: 'The “Warburg effect” in activated immune cells. Visualization of the interaction
  of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) pathway in naive (left side)
  and activated (right side) immune cells. While energy production relies on the TCA
  in native immune cells (solid arrows highlighted in blue) and Glycolysis is of minor
  importance (dashed arrows left side), the TCA is blocked on two breaking points
  in activated immune cells, which results in citrate and succinate accumulation.
  As a result, energy production in activated immune cells relies on Glycolysis (solid
  arrows highlighted in orange) while the TCA is of minor importance (dashed arrows).
  Upward arrows symbolize increased levels. Abbreviations: Pyr = Pyruvate, NADH =
  Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ in its oxidated form), GDP/GTP = Guanosine
  diphosphate/Guanosine triphosphate, HIF1α = Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α, IL-1β
  = Interleukin 1 β, NO = nitric oxide.'
