caption: The alternate complement pathway. The alternative complement cascade is constitutively
  active. C3 is spontaneously cleaved to C3b which then can enter into the C3 amplification
  loop in which C3 convertase (C3bBb) is generated and subsequently cleaves additional
  C3 into C3a and C3b leading to rapid amplification of C3b. C3b binds to C3 convertase
  to form C5 convertase (C3bBbC3b) which then enters the terminal complement cascade
  in which C5 forms C5a, an anaphylotoxin, and C5b which goes on to form the membrane
  attack complex. Regulation of the alternative complement cascade is controlled with
  CFH down regulation of the C3 amplification loop and through FI mediated inactivation
  of C3 to iC3b. Additionally MCP and THBD act to negatively regulate the alternate
  pathway at the level of the endothelium. These proteins which serve to inhibit the
  alternative pathway are labeled in red. CFB, which is cleaved by CFD, serve to generate
  C3 convertase in the C3 amplification loop. C3NeFs are autoantibodies which stabilize
  the amplification loop and result in persistent activation of the alternative pathway.
  The proteins involved in activation of the alternative pathway are labeled in green.
