caption: The typical plant signaling pathways for 3 phytohormones with the observed
  up- and down-regulation upon desiccation stress in K. crenulatum mapped onto the
  pathway. The observed up- and downregulation for the 3 pathways is different (up-or
  down-regulation, fold change in expression level). While these changes are interesting
  themselves, they do not represent direct evidence for phytohormone signaling in
  response to desiccation stress. Most interesting in this respect is the observed
  up-regulation of the single putative ortholog of type A ARR response regulators,
  which expression is under direct control of the cytokinin signaling pathway, suggesting
  that desiccation leads indeed to an activation of cytokinin signaling pathway in
  Klebsormidium crenulatum.
