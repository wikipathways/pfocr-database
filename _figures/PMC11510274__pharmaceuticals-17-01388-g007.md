caption: Proposed diagram for the anti-inflammatory activity of phenolics 1, 1a, and
  1b through the interaction with the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. In homeostatic
  conditions, the Keap1–Nrf2 system is placed joined to the cell’s internal hemimembrane.
  In these conditions, inactive Nrf2 is occasionally ubiquitinated and is degraded
  in the proteosome. In oxidative conditions, the intracellular ROS production and
  the inflammatory process are triggered, and the Nrf2 signaling pathway may be activated
  to control ROS-induced damage. Then, Nrf2 is dissociated from the Keap1 dimer and
  migrates into the nucleus to provide the transcription of its target gene, HO-1.
  This fact leads to the down-regulation of ROS production and inflammatory processes
  by inhibiting TNF-α, IL-1β, and COX-2 levels. In oxidative stress conditions, phenolics
  1, 1a, and 1b may be incorporated into the cell and act as Keap1 ligands, causing
  Nrf2 not to bind to or dissociate from Keap1, leading to further Nrf2 activation
