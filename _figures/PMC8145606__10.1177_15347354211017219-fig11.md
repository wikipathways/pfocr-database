caption: The mechanism of TER on CD8+ T-cells and glycolysis in CRC. TER played an
  important role in regulating the cellular metabolism and the expression of PD-L1
  in CD8+ T-cells and tumor cells. TER showed a dual regulatory effect on expression
  of PKM2 and PD-L1 in CD8+ T-cells as well as tumor cells in CT26 mouse model. TER
  regulated CD28, TIM3, and LAG3 expression in CD8+ T-cells in the tumor microenvironment.
  TER treatment prevented CD8+ T-cell dysfunction by targeting PD-L1/mTORC1 and PKM2
  mediated glycolytic pathway, providing new insight for colon cancer immunotherapy.
