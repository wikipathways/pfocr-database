caption: A, On the left, HIF‐1 signaling pathway (modified from KEGG hsa04066), showing
  genes targeted by miRNAs (n = 16) involved in its modulation. Orange boxes, genes
  targeted by more than 1 miRNA; yellow boxes, genes targeted by 1 miRNA and in green,
  not targeted genes. The complete list of target genes is reported in . On the right,
  the graph showing interactions between miRNAs and related target genes. B, On the
  left, the Apoptosis pathway (modified from KEGG hsa04201), showing genes targeted
  by miRNAs (n = 15) involved in its modulation. Orange boxes, genes targeted by more
  than 1 miRNA; yellow boxes, genes targeted by 1 miRNA and in green, not targeted
  genes. The complete list of target genes is reported in . On the right, the graph
  showing interactions between miRNAs and related target genes with pro‐apoptosis
  and pro‐inflammatory functions
