caption: 'Nitric oxide (NO) is endogenously formed by three different nitric oxide
  synthase (NOS) isoforms: neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible (iNOS) and endothelial NOS
  (eNOS). The activity of these enzymes is oxygen dependent and requires l-arginine
  and several co-factors (calmodulin, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADPH), tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin
  mononucleotide (FMN)). NO binds to the reduced heme site (Fe2+) of soluble guanylyl
  cyclase (sGC), which activates this enzyme, leading to the formation of the second
  messenger cyclic GMP (cGMP) from GTP. NO is a short-lived molecule that is oxidized
  in blood and tissues to form nitrite (NO3−), nitrate (NO2−) and other bioactive
  nitrogen species. NO bioactivity has been associated with numerous favourable effects
  in cardiovascular, renal and metabolic systems, mainly via cGMP-dependent mechanisms,
  although cGMP-independent mechanisms have also been reported. These mechanisms are
  multifactorial and involve modulation of protein function and immune cells, reductions
  in angiotensin II (Ang II) signalling, oxidative stress and sympathetic nerve activity
  and modulation of mitochondrial function. GFR, glomerular filtration rate.'
