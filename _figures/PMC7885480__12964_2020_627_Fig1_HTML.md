caption: 'Developmental signaling that govern CSCs and therapy resistance. a. Hippo
  signlaing consists of a core kinase cascade in which Mst1/2 forms a complex with
  the adaptor SAV1 that phosphorylates the kinases LATS1/2. LATS1/2 then phosphorylates
  and represses the transcriptional coactivators YAP1 and TAZ by promoting their degradation
  and cytoplasmic retention. When deregulation of the Hippo signaling by deletion
  or mutation of these kinases, YAP/TAZ accumulate in the nuclear and binds to its
  transcription factor Tead1–4 and upregulation of its target genes involving cell
  proliferation, CSCs properties and drug resistance. b. When SHH reaches its target
  cell, it binds to the PTCH1 receptor. The binding of SHH relieves SMO inhibition,
  leading to activation of the GLI transcription factors. Activated GLI accumulates
  in the nucleus and controls the transcription of hedgehog target genes. c. The Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway is important for CSC maintenance. In the canonical pathway, Wnt ligands
  bind to transmembrane Frizzled receptor, leading to the recruitment of Dvl protein.
  Dvl triggers the cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin which translocates into the
  nucleus, where it forms a complex with TCF/LEF that control genes in CSCs and therapy
  resistance. d. Notch signaling is activated through cell-to-cell contact. Ligands
  bind to Notch receptors on the target cell. This allows intracellular cleavage through
  γ-secretase, producing NICD. NICD translocates to the nucleus binding with CSL complex,
  triggering transcription and leading to CSC maintenance, metastasis and chemo-resistance.
  e. JAK-STAT signaling is made of three major proteins: cell-surface receptors, JAKs,
  and STATs. Once a ligand binds to the receptor, JAKs phosphorylates the receptor
  (gp130) which allows STAT proteins binds and be phosphorylated by JAKS to form a
  dimer. The phosphorylated STAT dimer enters the nucleus, binds to DNA, and causes
  transcription of target genes'
