caption: IL-6 signal transduction via classic and trans-signaling. The upper part
  of the figure depicts IL-6 signaling in cells expressing the membrane-bound receptor
  for IL-6 (IL-6R). In these cells (e.g., hepatocytes and several white blood cells),
  circulating IL-6 binds directly to IL-6R that forms a signaling complex with the
  membrane-bound glycoprotein 130 (gp130); this pathway is known as classic signaling.
  The bottom part depicts the IL-6 signaling in those cells that do not express the
  membrane-bound IL-6R. In these cells, membrane-bound gp130 (ubiquitously expressed)
  is activated by the circulating IL-6/sIL-6R complex (composed of IL-6 and the circulating
  soluble portion of IL-6R, sIL-6R). This pathway, known as trans-signaling, could
  be inhibited by the circulating soluble portion of gp130 (sgp130), which, by means
  of binding the circulating IL-6/sIL-6R complex, blocks the activation of the membrane-bound
  gp130. sgp130fc is a recombinant fusion protein of soluble gp130 and human IgG1
  Fc that blocks IL-6 trans-signaling mimicking sgp130 functions.
