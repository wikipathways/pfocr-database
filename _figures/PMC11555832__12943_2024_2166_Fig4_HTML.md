caption: Facilitating tumor cells recognition by innate immune cells. Antimicrobial
  immunity not only contribute to the recognition of bacterial or viral infections
  but also is involved in tumor cells recognition. For instance, nucleic acids released
  by killed tumor cells elicit anti-tumor immune response via nucleic-acid sensing
  receptors, such as endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs)
  and STING (stimulator of interferon gene). TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are endosomally
  expressed while TLR4 is expressed on cell surface. TLR3 and TLR4 signal induces
  the production of type I IFNs via TRIF-TRAF6-IRF3 pathway, besides, TLR3 signal
  induce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines production via TRIF-TRAF6-NF-κB pathway.
  TLR7, TLR 8 and TLR9 active IRF7 and NF-κB pathways via MyD88 and downstream TARF3/6.
  dsRNA stimulates IRF3 and NF-κB pathways via RIG-I and MDA5 signal and downstream
  MAVS, while dsDNA/ssDNA activates NF-κB and IRF3 pathway through cGAS-STING signal.
  Antimicrobial immune can be activated by synthetic immunostimulatory products which
  resemble immune factors after bacterial or viral infection. Various products were
  aimed to increase type I IFNs and inflammatory mediators which activate tumor killing-medicated
  by NK cells and cDC1 recruitment to tumor site. Besides, these products could kill
  tumor directly whereby releasing tumor antigens, or inducing DCs maturation directly
  or indirectly. Released tumor antigens was presented to matured DCs and amplified
  bioprocess was further induced which includes generation of tumor-specific CD8 T
  cells, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, the increase of
  and phagocytosis and cytotoxicity. Preclinical advances have found that monotherapy
  targeting of TLRs, STING or RLRs by intratumoral injection or systemic administration
  has yielded promising findings, and combination of immune agonist and PD-1/PD-L1
  blockade in CRC further enhanced anti-tumor efficacy in CRC, such as TLR3 agonist,
  OVA/agonistic TLR4, LPS trap, TLR7/8 agonist, TLR9 agonist, LGG, Fusobacterium nucleatum,
  RIG-1 and microbiome plus OVA
