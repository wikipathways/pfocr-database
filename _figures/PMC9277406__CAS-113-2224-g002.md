caption: Overview of the metabolic pathway of irinotecan. In humans, the metabolic
  activation of irinotecan is primarily carried out through hydrolysis by carboxylesterase
  type 1 and 2 enzymes (CES1 and CES2, respectively), found in the liver, with activation
  also taking place in plasma, the small intestine, and tumor tissue., , ,  CES2 is
  the major contributor of 7‐ethyl‐10‐hydroxycamptothecin (SN‐38) production from
  irinotecan and shows higher activity than CES1 in vitro. In humans, irinotecan is
  metabolized and inactivated by cytochrome P450 3A4/3A5 (CYP3A4/5), which convert
  irinotecan to inactive 7‐ethyl‐10‐[4‐N‐(5‐aminopentanoicacid)‐1‐piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin
  (APC), 7‐ethyl‐10‐(4‐amino‐1‐piperidino)carbonyloxycamptothecin (NPC), and metabolites
  M2 and M4. APC and NPC may be converted to SN‐38 by CES. Alternatively, SN‐38 is
  inactivated by glucuronidation to a β‐glucuronic acid conjugate (10‐O‐glucuronyl‐SN‐38
  [SN‐38G]) by hepatic uridine diphosphateglucuronosyl transferase 1A (UGT1A) enzymes,
  in particular, UGT1A1, UGT1A7, and UGT1A9.,  SN‐38G can be re‐activated to SN‐38
  by β‐glucuronidases present in the human colorectum, and increased levels of β‐glucuronidases
  in tumors may contribute to tumor SN‐38 exposure in vivo
