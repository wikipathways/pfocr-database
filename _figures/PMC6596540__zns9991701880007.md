caption: A model for regulation of forgetting of olfactory adaptation to diacetyl.
  The genetic epistasis analyses in this study showed that MACO-1 and SCD-2 regulate
  forgetting of olfactory adaptation to diacetyl downstream of the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway,
  and calcium imaging analyses suggested that MACO-1 might be involved in two distinct
  manners upstream of neural secretion of AWA and downstream of AWA sensation, and
  that SCD-2 functions for forgetting in AWA sensory neurons.
