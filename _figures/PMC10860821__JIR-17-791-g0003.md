caption: OA is a condition that involves the breakdown of cartilage in the joints.
  The role of pyroptosis, which is the rupture of cells, in the progression of OA
  has been studied. MLS and chondrocytes, which are cells in the joints, can detect
  foreign substances and activate an inflammatory response through the assembly of
  NLRP3 inflammasome. This can lead to the rupture of synoviocytes and the release
  of inflammatory factors that cause synovial fibroblasts to be affected. In addition,
  chondrocytes can activate MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, leading to the expression
  of MMP13 and ADAMTS5 while reducing the synthesis of Col-2 and Aggrecan, which are
  important components of cartilage. Pyroptosis of chondrocytes can also result in
  the release of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-18, which fuel each other
  in a vicious cycle, leading to the formation of osteophytes and worsening of OA
