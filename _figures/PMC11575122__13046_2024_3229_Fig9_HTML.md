caption: Schematic representation of the CARMN mechanism involving transcriptional
  and post-transcriptional regulation. This figure illustrated the molecular mechanism
  of CARMN regulation. At the transcriptional level, SNP rs12517403 (T > C) influenced
  the binding affinity of SP1 to the CARMN promoter region, modulating CARMN transcriptional
  activity, and was significantly associated with CC risk. At the post-transcriptional
  level, YBX1 and DHX9 bound to CARMN, synergistically enhancing its stability in
  cells. Functionally, CARMN inhibited MAPK13 expression by repressing TFAP2α transcription,
  thereby suppressing the MAPK signaling pathway. Concurrently, CARMN promoted Keap1-Nrf2
  binding, facilitating Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation, which indirectly inhibited
  Nrf2 nuclear translocation and antioxidant factor expression. This led to ROS accumulation,
  inhibiting the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway and suppressing the malignant progression
  of CC cells
