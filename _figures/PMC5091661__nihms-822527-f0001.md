caption: 'The one-carbon pathway (brown arrows) is important for the production of
  methionine and cysteine, as well as the SAM used in DNA and histone methylation
  reactions. Several inputs into the pathway replenish metabolites consumed during
  one-carbon metabolism. In cells expressing threonine dehydrogenase, threonine is
  oxidized to produce glycine, which is converted to methylene-THF (blue arrows).
  Folate obtained through diet or by de novo synthesis is converted into THF. Abbreviations:
  Me, methyl; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; SAH, S-adenosyl homocysteine;
  SAM, S-adenosyl methionine; THF, tetrahydrofolate.'
