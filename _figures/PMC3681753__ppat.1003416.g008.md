caption: 'Cellular mapping of gene products of 96 gene hits out of 114 that modulated
  endogenous IFNB1 expression either as Positive Regulators (71 PRs: Red) or as Negative
  Regulators (25 NRs: green) of the signaling pathway following SeV infection. PRs
  and NRs were positioned on a cell map and classified according to sub-cellular compartments
  and cellular function using annotation information from Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway,
  Uniprot, NCBI and Ingenuity pathway Analysis (IPA). The four functional groups are
  represented by different symbols: I - SeV specific (triangle), II - cytoplasmic
  dsRNA sensing (diamond), III - MAVS-dependent signaling (square) and IV - Nuclear
  import or transcription factor-dependent process (circle). Gene hits with knockdown
  efficiency confirmed by qRT-PCR with at least two independent shRNAs are highlighted
  in bold (41 PRs and 9NRs). The RLR and WNT signaling pathways are represented in
  light and dark blue respectively. Virus-induced activation of the WNT/CTNNB1 canonical-like
  pathway in feedback inhibition of antiviral innate responses is indicated in red.'
