caption: 'Signalling through growth factor receptors can activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway and the JAK3/STAT5 pathway. (A) Growth factor receptors first stimulate
  PI 3 kinase, and through inositol phosphates activate AKT which then phosphorylates
  mTOR. The phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP by mTOR and the phosphorylation downstream
  of RPS6 and EIF-4B stimulate translational initiation and contribute to cell growth.
  The activity of the mTOR pathway is controlled by PTEN a phosphoinositol 3,4,5-triphosphatase
  that catalyzes the reverse reaction of PI3K. Rapamycin (RAPA) inhibits mTOR kinase
  activity and has immunosuppressant activity on cells that use the mTOR pathway in
  the absence of PTEN inhibition. (B) Engagement of Growth factor receptors leads
  to activation of JAK3 which induces phospharylation and nuclear translocation of
  STAT5. The Foxp3 promotor has several STAT5B consensus sequences that can be bound
  and lead to promotor activity. Abbreviations: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;
  Akt, protein kinase B; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
  10; RAPA, rapamycin; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; p, phosphorylation; JAK,
  Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; Foxp3, forkhead
  box P3.'
