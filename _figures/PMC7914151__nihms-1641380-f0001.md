caption: T cell activation requires two signals. Engagement of the peptide-MHC complex
  on APCs with the TCR complex provides signal one. Costimulatory ligand-receptor
  interactions such as B7–1:CD28 provide signal two. Immune checkpoint interactions
  like PD-L1:PD-1 and B7–1:CTLA-4 regulate this response. (A) Although both inhibit
  T cell activation, originally the PD-L1:PD-1 pathway and the B7–1:CTLA-4 pathway
  were considered completely independent with no interactions. (B) The PD-L1:B7–1
  cis-interaction demonstrates crosstalk between these pathways. The PD-L1:B7–1 cis-heterodimer
  binds CTLA-4, reduces B7–1 trans-endocytosis, and potentially alters other CTLA-4-mediated
  cell-intrinsic mechanisms of inhibition. It also binds CD28; while most studies
  demonstrate no alteration in functional outcomes, one study shows decreased T cell
  activation. The PD-L1:B7–1 heterodimer does not bind to PD-1. By sequestering B7–1,
  the PD-L1:B7–1 cis-heterodimer indirectly reduces CTLA-4 inhibition. Although not
  detailed in this figure, the roles of B7–2 and PD-L2 should be further examined
  in the context of PD-L1:B7–1 engagement in T cell activation. (C) If PD-L1 outnumbers
  B7–1, PD-L1:B7–1 cis-heterodimers reduce free B7–1. The PD-L1:B7–1 cis-heterodimer
  binds to CD28 which most, but not all, studies suggest does not alter functional
  outcomes as described above. It also binds to CTLA-4, reduces CTLA-4-mediated trans-endocytosis,
  and possibly other CTLA-4 cell-intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms and outcomes. Finally,
  excess PD-L1 binds to PD-1, inducing strong inhibitory signals. Altogether, this
  reduces T cell activation. (D) If B7–1 outnumbers PD-L1, PD-L1:B7–1 cis-heterodimers
  reduce free PD-L1. The heterodimer prevents PD-1:PD-L1 binding. It reduces CTLA-4:B7–1
  trans-endocytosis, possibly other CTLA-4 inhibitory mechanisms. Most studies show
  that it does not alter B7–1:CD28 functional outcomes, although one study demonstrates
  that it reduces T cell activation. While B7–1 homodimers may interact with CTLA-4,
  B7–1 monomers and PD-L1:B7–1 cis-heterodimers continue transducing CD28 costimulatory
  signals. Collectively, this generates a net-stimulatory effect.
