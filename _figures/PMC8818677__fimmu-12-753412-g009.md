caption: A model is proposed to illustrate the protective mechanisms of EVR on the
  pathogenesis of transplanted renal tubular EMT and interstitial fibrosis in CAD.
  TNF-α could induce renal tubular EMT and then promote transplanted renal interstitial
  fibrosis through Akt and NF-κB signaling pathway activation in CAD recipients. Of
  these, NF-κB signaling pathway activation was due to IκB-α decrease and p-p65 increase.
  On the one hand, EVR could inhibit progression of renal tubular EMT via blocking
  the mTOR/ULK1 pathway to activate autophagy flux directly. On the other hand, EVR
  could also affect Skp2 (a E3 ubiquitin ligase) activity and inhibit IκB-α ubiquitin
  degradation, and thus restrain progression of renal tubular EMT through impacting
  NF-κB pathway activation. Red arrows represent the effect of TNF-α and dark blue
  arrows represent the effect of EVR.
