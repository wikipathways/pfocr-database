caption: The crosstalk between the signaling pathway of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and
  autophagy. DAMPs and PAMPs can activate the corresponding receptor, recruiting cytosolic
  MyD88, and starting the NK-κB pathway. In the process of post-transcription of NLRP3,
  pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β/18, the apoptotic caspase-8 can promote the activation
  of GSDMD and induce the proteolysis of NLRP3 and contribute to the transcription
  of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β/18. SESN2 can induce mitophagy which releases
  the mtROS which acts as a PAMP. Adrenomedullin promotes autophagy via ROS/AMPL/mTOR
  pathway, abating pyroptosis of the cell
