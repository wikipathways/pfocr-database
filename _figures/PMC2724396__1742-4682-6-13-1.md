caption: Schematic diagram of the modified Lee-Heinrich model of wnt pathway. The
  modified model includes GSK3β phosphorylation, β-catenin non-GSK3β phosphorylation
  and degradtion denoted by reaction steps 18, 19, and 20, respectively, shown in
  blue. The reaction rate constants of these reaction steps are denoted kG/kG' (forward/backward
  reaction), kβ/kβ', and kβdeg, respectively. The added reaction steps at β-catenin*
  shown in the upper part of diagram are similar to the added reaction steps at β-catenin,
  denoted 19 and 20 (see text for detailed description). Numbering of other reaction
  steps is the same as in the original Lee-Heinrich model [].
