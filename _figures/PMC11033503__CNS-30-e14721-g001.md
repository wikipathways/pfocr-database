caption: 'C/EBPβ regulates signaling pathways associated with brain inflammation in
  AD. C/EBPβ and astrocyte activation: After the activation of astrocytes, the expression
  of C/EBPβ increases and migrates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression in the
  nucleus as a transcription factor. C/EBPβ inhibited some ERK1/2 regulatory genes,
  activated P38K regulatory genes, downregulated ERK1/2 expression, and increased
  p38K expression, respectively, BDKRB2 expression retention and cox‐2 expression
  increase in astrocytes. C/EBPβ can also bind to C3, TIMP‐1, and TGF‐β1 promoters
  to promote their expression. C/EBPβ and microglia activation: After treatment with
  LPS, IL‐1β, IL‐6, or TNF‐α, C/EBPβ in microglia cells was significantly increased
  and its transfer to the nucleus was increased. C/EBPβ was bound to pro‐inflammatory
  gene promoters in a stimulatory and gene‐dependent manner to promote the expression
  of inflammatory genes in glia activation. iNOS, myeloperoxidase, C‐reactive protein,
  M‐CSF, and other promoters showed C/EBPβ‐binding sites. Inflammatory factors activate
  glial cells, induce the increase of C/EBPβ expression, and promote the increase
  of the expression of more inflammatory factors'
