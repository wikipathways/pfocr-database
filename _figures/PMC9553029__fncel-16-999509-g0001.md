caption: Schematic diagram of the orofacial pain modulation circuits. (A) Ascending
  nociceptive modulatory pathway. Neurons in the posteromedial thalamic nucleus (PBN)
  and thalamus (VPM) are key relays in ascending transmitting pathway. PBN and VPM
  receive nociceptive information from the SpVi/c, Vc, C1/C2 and project upward to
  the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insular cortex (IC), the primary
  somatosensory cortex (S1), and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). (B) Descending
  pain modulatory pathways. Periaqueductal gray (PAG), and ventrolateral medulla (VPM)
  are the main relays in the descending pain regulation pathway. The PAG receives
  regulatory information from the amygdala, VPM, ACC, S1, and S2, and finally transmits
  it down to the SpV through the RVM. TheRVM receives direct inputs from the PAG,
  thalamus, parabrachial region, and locus coeruleus (LC).
