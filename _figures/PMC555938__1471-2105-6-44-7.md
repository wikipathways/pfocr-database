caption: The pathway of circadian regulatory system of Arabidopsis thaliana in Fig.
  5 is repeated as independent validation by randomly reshuffling the time order of
  microarray experiment but with the same choices of target and regulatory genes.
  Obviously, the proposed pathway in Fig. 5 is destroyed by the reshuffling of experimental
  data. The related genes are represented as ovals with different colors of light
  yellow (crytochrome), light blue (phytochrome), orange (biological clock genes),
  light green (some physiologically light-dependent downstream genes), and gray (other
  relevant genes not as target genes). There are three types of lines with colors
  of red (activation), blue (repression), and black. In addition to the black line
  representing the signal pipes from genes, the red lines are shown depending on the
  degree of activation whilst the blue lines are shown depending on the degree of
  repression. The black square symbol attached on the lines is the bifurcate node
  from the same pipe of signal. The circle symbol attached on the lines is the collecting
  nodes from different signal sources. The colored degree bar between activation and
  repression is also shown in the bottom of the figure.
