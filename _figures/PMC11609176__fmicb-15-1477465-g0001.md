caption: 'Schematic representation of endophytes'' involvement in isoprenoid biosynthesis
  modulation. The central plant cell illustrates the MVA and MEP pathways from which
  monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, and sesquiterpenes are derived (compounds
  are reported in black, while enzymes catalyzing the reactions are in red). On the
  right, three colored boxes elucidate the underlying mechanisms contributing to the
  enhanced expression of isoprenoids biosynthetic genes in three medicinal plants:
  Bacopa monnieri (blue), Atractylodes lancea (pink), and Withania somnifera (orange).
  Arrows on the bottom of the plant cell are colored accordingly and indicate the
  specific metabolites whose concentration is increased after the endophytes'' inoculation
  (Bacoside A, withanolides and withaferins, and volatile oils). Colored dots associated
  with enzymes denote their upregulated gene expression correlated with various endophyte-mediated
  mechanisms. The left magnification highlights additional enzymes in the triterpene
  biosynthetic pathway whose expression was upregulated after the endophytes'' inoculation'
