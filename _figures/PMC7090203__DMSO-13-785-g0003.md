caption: 'Physical activity alters circulating monocyte features and obese adipose
  tissue macrophage distinction. Obese state: The excess nutrients-caused adipocyte
  hypertrophy and cell death induce the micro hypoxia in AT. ① Although MФs accumulation
  is increased, constantly elevated levels of circulating non-esterified fatty acid
  reveal an inefficient function of MФs to maintain the AT homeostasis. These complex
  interactions of the immune system and adipocyte cause the release of inflammatory
  cytokines into the blood. Both circulating cytokines and the fatty-acids provide
  a chemoattractive environment. ② The increased CCL2 release and hypoxia result ③
  the MON recruitment and more intensive infiltration into the AT. In AT, this inflammatory
  condition promotes M1 polarization leading to ④ higher number of surface receptors
  such as TLR4 and CCR2 which activate the influential inflammatory transcription
  factors, resulting in the upregulation of several inflammatory cytokine genes such
  as CCL and CXCL family, IFNγ, IL-6/12, and TNFα. ⑤ Circulating MONs are affected
  by releasing the abundant inflammatory cytokines and FFAs into the bloodstream.
  They might be altered toward the inflammatory types due to the increase of inflammatory
  receptors and, consequently, activation of inflammatory signaling cascades, causing
  the upregulation of more inflammatory genes. This impaired feed-forward cycle aggravates
  the inflammatory status in individuals with obesity. Lean state: Exercise training
  improves the inflammatory state through the inhibition of AT expansion (increasing
  energy consumption and modulation of inflammatory cascade activities (anti-inflammatory
  cytokine expression). It seems that the improvement of the inflammatory condition
  in either AT or bloodstream is induced by the reduction of the chemoattractant factors
  like CCL2 and FFAs. This has influenced the MФ polarization pathway toward M2. Consequently,
  it leads to a decrease in both the adipocyte death and the expression of inflammatory
  cytokine receptors on the surface of cell membrane, which resulted in the downregulation
  of inflammatory pathways. The circulating MONs which experience the anti-inflammatory
  condition obtain the features of anti-inflammatory MON subsets. Moreover, producing
  the strong anti-inflammatory myokines could interrupt these pathways following the
  exercise training, resulting in the improvement of obesity induced-inflammatory
  cycle.Abbreviations: TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; CD, cluster of differentiation;
