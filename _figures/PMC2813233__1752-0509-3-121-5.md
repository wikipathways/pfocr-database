caption: Comparison of metabolic networks of an uninfected and a MS2 phage-infected
  Escherichia coli cell. Thick flux arrows represent high reaction fluxes, whereas
  the thinner flux arrows represent low reaction fluxes. Biosynthesis of amino acids
  is upregulated in infected cells. NADPH is a pre-cursor that is required in the
  biosynthesis of most of the amino acids. The pentose phosphate pathway provides
  NADPH and is therefore upregulated in infected cells. This up-regulation is due
  to the diversion of a major portion of glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) to the pentose
  phosphate pathway instead of the glycolytic pathway. The glycolytic pathway is not
  affected because the loss of g6p is made up by the gain in the amounts of the by-products
  of the pentose phosphate pathway, fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,
  which are fed back into the glycolytic pathway.
