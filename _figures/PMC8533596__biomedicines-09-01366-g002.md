caption: Mechanisms used by neutrophils to promote muscle damage in Duchenne muscular
  dystrophy (DMD). Following muscle damage, damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPS)
  are released from the dystrophic muscle and activate neutrophils via recognition
  by toll-like receptors (TLRs) and macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1) on the cell surface.
  This interaction activates the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)
  pathway which further activates the IκB kinases (IKKs) and mitogen-activated kinases
  (MAPKs). This induces the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activator
  protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors which promote the transcription of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. DAMP-TLR interactions also cause the release of neutrophil elastase (NE)
  and myeloperoxidase (MPO) from the azurophilic granules within the neutrophil into
  the cytoplasm. MPO catalyzes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including
  hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which elevates oxidative stress and promotes muscle cell
  lysis. NE induces chromatin decondensation and, together with MPO, lead to neutrophil
  extracellular trap (NET) formation. It is thought that NETs are released outside
  the cell by cell-lysis and further promote inflammation.
