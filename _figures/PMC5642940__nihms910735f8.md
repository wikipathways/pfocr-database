caption: Model of the role of FAK in regulating lineage commitment, proliferation,
  and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. (A) Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway inhibits
  adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs but promotes their osteoblast lineage commitment,
  and positively regulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. (B) Ablation
  of FAK in early bone marrow osteoblast progenitors attenuates the expression of
  canonical Wnt ligands, increases GSK3 activity, decreases β-catenin level, and ultimately
  impairs Wnt/β-catenin–mediated transcription, which can account for the reduced
  BMSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, but enhanced BMSCs adipogenic
  differentiation, and thereby contributes to the decreased bone mass and increased
  bone marrow adiposity. “+” indicates positive effect of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  and “−” indicates inhibitory effect of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. “+++” and “−−−”
  indicate stronger promoting and inhibiting effect, respectively.
