caption: 'Uncovering iron imbalance and inositol metabolism disruption: insights from
  the yeast model of N88S seipinopathy. In this model system, there is an accumulation
  of PA associated with derepressed INO1 expression, along with reduced protein levels
  of key enzymes in the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway. This dysregulation is accompanied
  by an increase in triglyceride (TG) levels in cells expressing the N88S mutation.
  Whereas WT cells normally upregulate CTH2 and FET3 expression during the diauxic
  shift, responding to increased iron demand, cells expressing N88S seipin exhibit
  impaired Aft1p/Aft2p transcriptional activity, leading to reduced levels of iron
  transport and storage proteins such as Fit1p, Arn1p, Arn2p, and Hmx1p. This results
  in iron dyshomeostasis, particularly under iron-deficient conditions. The activation
  of the stress response via transcription factors Msn2p/Msn4p may provide an adaptive
  mechanism to better manage iron deficiency during the transition to the post-diauxic
  shift. This adaptation potentially allows cells to bypass the reduced function of
  Aft1p/Aft2p on the iron regulon, thereby enhancing iron assimilation through the
  reductive pathway. This pathway involves the reduction of ferric to ferrous ions
  and the protein complex formed by the Ftr1p transporter and the Fet3p ferroxidase.
  Moreover, we propose that FET3 expression is linked to potential disruptions in
  Fe-S cluster activity and/or assembly in cells carrying the N88S seipin mutation.
  This is supported by the observed reduction in aconitase activity, which relies
  on an intact [4Fe-4S] cluster for full functionality. Our findings indicate that
  human N88S seipinopathy might be both a proteinopathy and a lipidopathy, with disruption
  in inositol and lipid metabolism playing a significant role in triggering the ER
  stress response. Furthermore, the resulting iron imbalance may impair various cellular
  functions, including antioxidant mechanisms like catalase, and could contribute
  to the progression of neurodegenerative traits observed in human disease. Images
  were generated using bioRender. Green and red indicates upregulated and downregulated,
  respectively'
