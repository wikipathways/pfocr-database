caption: Proposed model for UL32-postitive MVB biogenesis and egress in HCMV-infected
  fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In fibroblasts, HCMV infection induces classical
  MVBs, suggesting the virus exploits membrane trafficking in the endocytic pathway
  to promote viral incorporation into these vesicles, possibly for release via the
  exosomal pathway. In endothelial cells, HCMV infection generates MVBs that contain
  noncanonical markers, including Golgi and lysosomal markers and intraluminal LC3B,
  suggesting the MVBs in these cells originate from the early biosynthetic pathway
  and viral infection expands the noncanonical secretory autophagy pathway. The solid
  arrows denote the known cellular pathways; dotted arrows denote pathways expanded
  by HCMV infection. The image was created with BioRender.
