caption: A schematic diagram for the mechanism of RR on osteoblast and osteoclast.
  RANKL is supposed to stimulate the BMMs to produce ROS and activate the downstream
  P38 MAPK signaling pathway to promote NFATc1 upregulation and mature osteoclast
  formation. By binding to the MCU on the intermembrane of mitochondria, RR inhibits
  MCU function and its expression to reduce ROS production. Besides, the phosphorylation
  of P38 and the activation of downstream signaling pathways are also inhibited, resulting
  in the disruption of mature osteoclasts differentiation. Meanwhile, the osteoblastogenesis
  is also facilitated under the treatment of RR.
