caption: A Three-Part Signaling System Drives the Inflammatory Response in the Fly(1)
  In Drosophila, macrophages are initially primed to respond to a wound by engulfing
  an apoptotic corpse. The process of engulfment triggers a calcium signaling event
  in the macrophage which, through activation of the JNK pathway, leads to upregulation
  of the damage receptor draper and makes these cells “primed” for response to a subsequent
  wound. (2) Upon wounding, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is rapidly released from the
  wound site diffusing at approximately 84,000 μm/min, acting as a “permissive signal”
  for macrophage migration to wounds by activating Src-dependent phosphorylation of
  Draper on its ITAM domain, which in turn recruits the downstream kinase shark. (3)
  A third unknown directional signal (signal X) is also produced upon wounding and
  diffuses away from the wound at a speed of approximately 200 μm/min. This signal
  operates as an attractive cue to pull the macrophage to the wound and could be detected
  by Draper or unknown damage receptors (receptor X).
