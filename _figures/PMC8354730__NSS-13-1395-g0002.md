caption: Potential mechanisms of sleep disturbance in postoperative neurocognitive
  disorders. (A) Signaling pathways associated with sleep deprivation-induced POCD,
  including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, elevated biomarkers of aging, disturbed
  circadian rhythm, and decreased neurotrophic factors. (B) Sleep deprivation leads
  to several cellular pathological mechanisms in the hippocampus. Complements C3 and
  C5 in the hippocampus are elevated as a result of sleep deprivation, which activates
  microglia. Activated microglia further release IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 to exaggerate
  neuroinflammation. Moreover, sleep deprivation activates neurotoxic astrocytes (A1-specific
  astrocytes) and weakens astrocytic phagocytosis and their function of synaptic pruning.
  Activated microglia and astrocytes promote neuronal loss. Sleep deprivation causes
  decreased spine density of neurons and impaired synaptic plasticity, and decreased
  BDNF after sleep deprivation also restrains hippocampal adult neurogenesis. All
  of these cellular pathological changes induced by sleep deprivation accelerate the
  development of POCD. (C) Structure changes. The blood-brain barrier is damaged by
  sleep deprivation through decreased tight junctions. Atrophy of the hippocampus
  and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as decreased hippocampal-prefrontal cortex
  functional connectivity, may indicate a higher risk of POCD. (D) Dysfunction of
  the glial-lymphatic pathway. Sleep deprivation causes decreased exchange of the
  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the interstitial fluid (ISF), which promotes Aβ accumulation.
  Apolipoprotein E (APOE) in the CSF is reduced after sleep deprivation, resulting
  in depressed elimination of Aβ. Moreover, advanced age and accumulated Aβ lead to
  mislocalization of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) expressed in the endfeet of astrocytes, thereby
  forming a vicious circle to accelerate the development of POCD.
