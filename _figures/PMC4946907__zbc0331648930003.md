caption: Bacteria-specific polyamine biosynthetic pathways. Enzyme names are indicated
  in red. Carboxyspermidine (C-Spd) and carboxynorspermidine (C-Nspd) do not accumulate
  in wild type bacteria. Two different proteins, HSS or DHS-like HSS, can produce
  Hspd. The S-adenosylmethionine-dependent pathway for Spd biosynthesis is found in
  all three domains of life and is not shown. Similarly, the aminopropylagmatine variant
  pathway is also found in archaea and is not shown. The aspartate β-semialdehyde-derived
  aminopropyl group is shown in purple.
