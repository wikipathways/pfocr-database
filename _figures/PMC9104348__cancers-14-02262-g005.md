caption: 'Pathway analysis showing key metabolic alterations observed in TKO mice.
  Metabolites and lipid classes associated with HGSC development are represented as
  solid symbols and colored based on their corresponding pathway. Intermediates connecting
  the pathways are shown in grey text. Blue arrows pointing downwards indicate the
  metabolite showed an overall decrease in TKO animals compared to TKO controls while
  the red arrows pointing upwards indicate the metabolite increased in TKO animals.
  Pathway information was derived from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes,
  MetaboAnalyst, Lipid Pathway Enrichment Analysis, and existing scientific literature.
