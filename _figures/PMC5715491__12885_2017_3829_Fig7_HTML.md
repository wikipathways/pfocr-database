caption: Pathways involved in apoptotic and EMT effect by genistein in HT-29 cells.
  Genistein reverse the EMT by promoting E-cadherin expression and inhibiting N-cadherin
  expression; combine with the regulations of EMT makers, Snail2/slug, ZEB1, and TWIST1.
  Genistein promotes Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-8 activity by inhibiting notch-1. The notch-1
  reduction leads to the inhibition of both p-NF-κB and NF-κB expression results in
  a reduction of EMT
