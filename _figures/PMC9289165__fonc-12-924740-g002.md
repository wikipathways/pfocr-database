caption: The therapeutic targeting of CD47-SIRPα pathway can cause the elimination
  of breast cancer cells through the following four pathways. First, the inhibition
  of CD47-SIRPα could enhance tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophage. Second, anti-CD47
  antibody enables the phagocytic uptake of tumor cells by dendritic cells and subsequent
  antigen presentation to CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, thereby stimulating anti-tumor
  adaptive immune response. Third, anti-CD47 antibody eliminates tumor cells via traditional
  Fc-dependent mechanisms, including ADCC and ADCP. Fourth, anti-CD47 antibody stimulates
  tumor cell apoptosis through a caspase-independent mechanism.
