caption: 'The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 pathway. The HIF-1α gene is transcribed
  in the nucleus with the help of specificity protein (Sp) 1, P300, and HIF-1β. Once
  translated in the cytoplasm, the HIF-1α protein can either become hydroxylated and
  ubiquinated, in which case it will be degraded by proteasomes (under normal oxygen
  conditions). In the setting of hypoxia, it can re-enter the nucleus and form a transcription
  complex with the HIF-1β subunit. If successfully stabilized with the latter subunit,
  the final complex ultimately will function to regulate target genes such as vascular
  endothelial growth factor and cathepsin D. Possible therapeutic intervention points
  are: the hydroxylation that leads to degradation of HIF-1α, the binding of HIF-1α
  to its coactivators, and the modulation of HIF-1α activity. Additionally, gene therapy
  approaches have been used to induce the overexpression of HIF or the disruption
  of the HIF pathway with antisense oligonucleotides. Abbreviations: PHD: proline-hydroxylase
  domain containing molecules; Ub: ubiquitin; VHL: von Hippel-Lindau protein. Image
