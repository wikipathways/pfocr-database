caption: The MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. Cellular proteins are hydrolyzed
  by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway into oligopeptides, which are subsequently transported
  into endoplasmic reticulum through the TAP transporter. In the ER these peptides
  may be further trimmed by ERAP1 and then peptides of the right length and sequence
  bind to MHC I molecules with the help of Tapasin in a peptide-loading complex containing
  Tapasin, TAP, calreticulim, and ERP57, or the with the help of TAPBPR. After MHCI
  molecules bind peptide, they are transported to the cell surface for display to
  CD8+ T cells.
