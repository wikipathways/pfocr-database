caption: Biosynthesis pathway of SFA and MUFA with graph data of fatty acid composition
  in the plasma of the control and atherosclerosis (AS) group. 1—Palmitic acid (C16:0)
  % content; 2—C16:0/C18:0 ratio; 3—Stearic acid (C18:0) % content; 4—C18:0/20:0 ratio;
  5—C20:0/22:0 ratio; 6—C18:0/C18:1n-9 ratio; 7—Oleic acid (C18:1n-9) % content; 8—Gondoic
  acid (C20:1n-9) % content. Statistically significant differences are indicated by
  ** (p < 0.01), and *** (p < 0.001), which were evaluated by an appropriate test.
  The enzyme nomenclature and metabolic scheme presented are based on previously published
  data [24,25,26,27,28,29]. FAs determined by the applied HPLC-MS/MS method are highlighted
  in bold. The other FAs involved in metabolism are written in italics. Fatty acid
  contents are expressed as percentages of the total identified fatty acids (%), whereas
  all fatty acid ratios (e.g., C16:0/C18:0) are reported as dimensionless numbers.
  The boxplots of parameters for stearic acid (C18:0) and oleic acid (C18:1n-9) indicate
  the mean ± SD. The other parameters’ boxplots are the median and [IQR 25–75%]
