caption: Solid-phase natural product synthesis by assembly line enzymes. (A) An amide
  bond-forming condensation reaction during the proposed pathway for SW-163D biosynthesis.
  (B) The NRPS that constructs SW-163D, showing the nascent intermediates tethered
  to each thiolation domain. C = condensation, A = adenylation, T= thiolation, E =
  epimerization, MT = methyltransferase, TE = thioesterase.
