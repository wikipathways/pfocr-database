caption: Genetic diagram of the core ethylene signaling pathway. The ethylene signal
  represses the function of the five ethylene receptor genes (ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 [ETR1],
  ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1 [ERS1], ETR2, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE4 [EIN4], and ERS2),
  which otherwise repress ethylene responses through the negative regulator CONSTITUTIVE
  RESPONSE1 (CTR1). Ethylene responses are positively regulated by EIN2, EIN3, and
  downstream primary and secondary ethylene-responsive genes, such as ETHYLENE RESPONSE
  FACTOR1 (ERF1). Representative seeding phenotypes in the triple response assay (ethylene
  insensitivity or constitutive ethylene response) are shown for the dominant gain-of-function
  mutations in the ethylene receptor genes and the loss-of-function mutations in CTR1,
  EIN2, and EIN3/ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 (EIL1). Arrows indicate activation, and
  T-bars indicate repression of the pathway.
