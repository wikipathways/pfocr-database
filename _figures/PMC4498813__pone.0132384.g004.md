caption: The proteins indentified were involved in Protein Synthesis, Gene Expression,
  Nucleic Acid Metabolism (A); Cell Death, Inflammatory Response, Infectious Disease
  (B); Hematological System Development and Function, Hematopoiesis, Cellular Development
  (C); Gene Expression, Cell Death, Cell Morphology (D); DNA Replication, Recombination
  and Repair, Cancer, Skeletal and Muscular Disorders (E). Proteins shaded in green
  indicate decrease in abundance and proteins shaded in red indicate increase in abundance
  in the FMDV-infected cells compared with mock-infected cells. The color intensity
  corresponds to the degree of abundance. Proteins in white are those known to be
  in the network but were not identified in our study through the Ingenuity Pathways
  Knowledge Base. The shapes denote the molecular class of the protein. The solid
  lines indicate the promotional interactions while the dashed lines indicate the
  suppressive interaction.
