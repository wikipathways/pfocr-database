caption: DNA damage tolerance pathways. Obstacles on the DNA template (red diamond)
  block ongoing DNA replication (blue arrows) and lead to fork stalling. This leads
  to helicase/polymerase uncoupling, generating tracts of ssDNA, which is bound by
  RPA (yellow circles). DNA damage tolerance mechanisms allow DNA replication to continue
  in the presence of such impediments. Translesion synthesis employs specialised polymerases
  (green oval) to insert bases opposite damaged templating bases (orange line indicates
  this insertion). Fork reversal begins as the recombinase Rad51 (orange circle) replaces
  RPA, and, along with the recruitment of additional factors, promotes the transient
  remodelling of a replication fork into a stabilised ‘chicken foot’ structure to
  allow for lesion repair or template switching. Rad51 and BRCA 1/2 (grey oval) are
  factors that prevent degradation of this reversed fork structure. Template switching
  requires strand invasion to use the newly replicated strand as a template instead
  of the damaged parental strand. Dormant origin firing is activated when the replication
  fork slows or stalls to ensure replication is completed in a timely manner. Dormant
  origin firing can occur alongside the other mechanisms of DDT. Finally, repriming
  requires de novo primer synthesis downstream of the lesion (red arrow) from which
  replication can be resumed by a replicative polymerase. In vertebrate cells, this
  is dependent on PrimPol (pink oval), which is recruited by RPA to ssDNA.
