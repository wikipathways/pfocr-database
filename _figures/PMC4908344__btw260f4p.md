caption: Examples of extracted features as enzyme-specific chemical transformation
  patterns. (a) The left panel shows two substrate–product pairs (RP01073 and RP01958)
  associated with enzyme ortholog K01592, tyrosine decarboxylase. (b) The left panel
  shows three substrate–product pairs (RP01224, RP04067 and RP01667) associated with
  enzyme ortholog K00052, 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase. In (a) and (b), the chemical
  graph alignments of the compounds are shown in the middle. Red dashed lines indicate
  the elimination of chemical bonds, red dotted lines indicate the atoms that change
  their labels (functional groups), and blue dotted lines indicate the atoms that
  are preserved during the reaction. The corresponding PACHA feature vectors are shown
  at the right. Features representing conserved chemical substructures are colored
  black and the features representing chemical changes are colored red
