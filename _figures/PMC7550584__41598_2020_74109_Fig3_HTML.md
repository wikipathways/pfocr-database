caption: Schematic pathway for DEP-mediated olfactory dysfunction. Simplified signaling
  network of major genes altered by DEPs. Up- and down-regulated genes lead to olfactory
  disorders caused by neurotoxicity through inhibition of sensory perception and nerve
  regeneration. Genes highlighted in red and blue color indicate the pattern of increased
  and decreased expression, respectively. Main cell processes are highlighted in yellow
  color. The legend for entities is on the left side of the figure.
