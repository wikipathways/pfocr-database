caption: Cellular mechanisms, signaling pathways, and potential therapeutic targets
  in TRALI. The pathogenesis involves immune responses to immunogenic blood product
  components, with key pathways including inflammation, neutrophil activation, and
  endothelial dysfunction. Based on these molecular and pathway insights, therapeutic
  strategies focus on removing immunogenic components of exogenous blood products,
  modulating inflammation, and targeting neutrophils and endothelial cells. Emerging
  therapies, such as those targeting reactive oxygen species (ROS), intravenous immunoglobulin
  (IVIG), and osteopontin, are in preclinical stages
