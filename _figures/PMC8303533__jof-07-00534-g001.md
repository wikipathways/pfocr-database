caption: Secretory pathway in A. oryzae. (A) Secretion mechanisms at the hyphal tip
  region are depicted. Secretory proteins are transported via vesicles from ER through
  Golgi to the apical vesicle cluster Spitzenkörper. Apical secretion is thought to
  be dependent mainly on actin cable and supportively on the microtubule. SV, secretory
  vesicle. (B) Secretion mechanisms to the septum and plasma membrane around the hyphal
  middle region are shown. Septum-directed secretion is dependent on the microtubule
  but independent of the actin cytoskeleton, but further detailed molecular mechanisms
  are unknown. The cytoplasmic acyl-CoA binding protein AoAcb2 is unconventionally
  secreted under carbon starvation conditions, in which a compartment for unconventional
  protein secretion (CUPS) might be involved. Plasma membrane transporters are potentially
  transported directly from ER, not via Golgi. As an example of secondary metabolite
  secretion, kojic acid (KA) is synthesized from glucose (Glc) by the biosynthetic
  enzyme KojA and secreted by the putative plasma membrane transporter KojT. Note
  that the localization and transport of plasma membrane transporters do not appear
  to be restricted around the hyphal middle region.
