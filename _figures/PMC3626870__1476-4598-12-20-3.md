caption: Arsenic-mediated activation of EGFR signaling pathway. EGFR and several components
  of this pathway can be activated by arsenic exposure in human lung cells. This activation
  can be inhibited by EGFR-TKI, revealing a potential role for TKIs in the management
  of arsenic associated lung tumors, regardless of the mutational status of EGFR.
  AsIII can also induce STAT3 inhibition by targeting JAK, while it can activate STAT3
  trough JNK, contributing to AKT activation.
