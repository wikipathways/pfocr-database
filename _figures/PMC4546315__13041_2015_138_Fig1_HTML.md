caption: Schematic of the insulin/IGF1R signalling pathway. A simplified representation
  of the insulin/IGF1 signalling pathway depicting the downstream activation of Akt
  and p44-42 MAPK through binding of insulin or IGF1 to their respective receptors.
  Furthermore insulin can bind to IGF1R and IGF1 to IR and IR α-subunits/ β-subunits
  can form heterodimers with IGF1R α-subunits /β-subunits adding further complexity
  at the level of the receptors. There are also numerous downstream feedback loops
  within this and other signalling pathways which act to regulate signalling through
  this pathway at multiple levels
