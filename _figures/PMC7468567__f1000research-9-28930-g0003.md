caption: 'All pathways were significant enriched in both human COVID-19 patient lung
  tissues and HCC515 cells with ACE2 inhibitor inhibition. The abnormal gene expression
  patterns in these pathways were reversed by COL-3 and/or CGP-60474. Blue diamond:
  down-regulated gene in disease; orange diamond: up-regulated gene in disease; hexagon:
  pathway; blue line: drug decreases gene expression; orange line: drug increases
  gene expression; blue/orange line width corresponds to the ability to change gene
  expression; dark green line: interaction between gene and pathway; diamond size:
  importance of gene in the disease; hexagon size: importance of pathway in the disease.'
