caption: 'Routes of glucose metabolism in cells. Upon entering a cell via a glucose
  transporter (GLUT) glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase entrapping glucose-phosphate.
  This is then metabolized into glycogen (left), along the pentose phosphate pathway
  (right) or via glycolysis (center). Glycolysis results in the formation of pyruvate
  which can be interconverted into lactate through the action of lactate dehydrogenase
  enzymes. Pyruvate can also enter mitochondria, where it is converted into AcetylCoA
  through the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase which in turn fuels the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCAC). The TCAC cycle generates NADH and FADH2 which are required to
  supply electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC). The ETC generates a proton
  gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is used to power the production
  of ATP by complex V, an ATP synthase. HK, hexokinase; PDHK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase
