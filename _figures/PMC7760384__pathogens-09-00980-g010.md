caption: (A) Schematic representation of the proteins involved in the denitrification
  pathway. The relative abundances (Δbfd/wt) of each of the proteins in the pathway
  are color coded according to the log2FC scale; proteins that require iron to function
  are encased. The conditions that activate expression of the regulatory proteins
  Anr, Dnr, NarXL and RpoS are in gray; the segmented arrows indicate which proteins
  are transcribed in response to each of the regulatory proteins. The preparation
  of this scheme was aided significantly by ref. []. (B) Proteins coded by genes expected
  to be transcriptionally activated by Anr are depleted in the Δbfd cells, despite
  enrichment of Anr.
