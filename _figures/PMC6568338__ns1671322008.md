caption: 'Schematic representation of adhesion-dependent and -independent pathways
  leading to DNA synthesis in ET-1-treated astrocytes. Primary astrocytes express
  ET-1-receptors (ETB-R subtype) coupled via PTX-insensitive heterotrimeric G-proteins
  (Gq) to at least two distinct pathways: (1) the adhesion-independent activation
  of the ERK pathway (gray arrows) initiated by phosphorylation of Shc by a protein
  tyrosine kinase (PTK); PYK2 activation coincides with ERK activation and could be
  responsible for this phosphorylation event; and (2) the adhesion-dependent activation
  of FAK/Src pathway (black arrows), which requires Rho activation and stress fiber
  formation. Adhesion of astrocytes to ECM proteins involves integrins, heterodimeric
  receptors composed of α and β chains. Both signaling pathways cooperate to induce
  DNA synthesis in response to ET-1.'
