caption: AhR transcription in mammalian cells and the putative mechanism of AhR activation.
  The inactive form of AhR occurs in the cytoplasm as a complex with chaperone proteins,
  including HSP90, P23 and XAP2. Multiple exogenous and endogenous AhR ligands from
  the environment, diet, host metabolism and gut microbiome induce a conformational
  alteration in AhR, exposing the nuclear localization signal to activate nuclear
  shuttling. Once in the nucleus, AhR forms a heterodimeric complex, with ARNT binding
  to the XRE sequence motif 5′-GCGTG-3′. This induces the expression of its target
  genes, such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1 and COX-2, which are involved in the inflammatory
  response and xenobiotic metabolism. Furthermore, AhR mediates AhR repressor expression,
  abrogating the formation of the AhR/ARNT heterodimer and inhibiting its transcriptional
  activity. Moreover, AhR forms as a Cul4B-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, inducing
  selective protein degradation. AhR regulation signalling can be controlled via nuclear
  export and subsequent AhR degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome signalling
  pathway. In addition to this canonical pathway, signalling through AhR can also
  be mediated through interactions with other regulatory proteins, such as oestrogen
  receptor, NF-κB and RB
