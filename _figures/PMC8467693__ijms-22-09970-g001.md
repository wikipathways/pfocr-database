caption: Cascade of events in the WNT Signalling Pathway. Our approach is to combine
  critical features (genes forming the model) from the most recent mathematical model
  of the WNT STN, by Kogan et al., with adjustable machine learning models []. The
  schematic represents the initial steps of activation of the WNT pathway. WNT binds
  to FZD (frizzled), and the co-receptor LRP5/6 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5/6), which is recruited in the vicinity of FZD receptors upon WNT binding.
  This binding prevents the formation of the whole destruction complex consisting
  of AXIN, APC, and GSK3β (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta), thereby causing rising
  levels of β-catenin, β-catenin translocation into the nucleus, and expression of
  WNT target genes, CCND1 (Cyclin D1), MYC, MYCN, AXIN2, and FZD7 []. Using machine
  learning tools, such as PROGENy, the WNT pathway activity can be calculated for
  each individual patient by analysing their gene expression [,]. Created with BioRender.com.
