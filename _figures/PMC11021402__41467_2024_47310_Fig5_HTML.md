caption: 'Top: Cartoon of the ISC complexes analyzed in this study. Bottom: Coordination
  of Fe by the five residues of the ISCU2 assembly site, Cys381NFS1 (orange), and
  water (blue) at different stages of the biosynthetic pathway. (1) Free ISCU2 (U)
  tetrahedrally coordinates Fe2+ via its residues Cys69, Asp71, Cys95 and His137.
  (2) Binding of Fe-U to (NIA)2 leads to an Fe coordination in which Cys69ISCU2 is
  replaced by Cys381NFS1 and His137 by water. (3) Cys addition creates the Cys381NFS1
  persulfide which also can coordinate the Fe. In this state, steric hindrance by
  His137ISCU2 and the distal location of Cys138ISCU2 preclude persulfide transfer
  from Cys381NFS1 to Cys138ISCU2. (4) Dynamic binding of FXN to (Fe-NSIAU)2 promotes
  His137ISCU2 to move away from the assembly site, while Cys138ISCU2 moves closer
  to the Fe and Cys381-SNFS1. (5) Thereby, Cys138ISCU2 coordinates the Fe as a prerequisite
  for direct persulfide acceptance from Cys381NFS1 to form the (Fe-NIAUSX)2 intermediate.
  Despite the fact that Cys95ISCU2 is within a similar distance from the Cys381NFS1
  persulfide as Cys138ISCU2, no persulfidation is observed. (A) As a rather unlikely
  alternative (see Discussion), the preformed (Fe-NIAUX)2 complex (similar to the
  (Zn-NIAUX)2 structure17) may coordinate the Fe by Asp71ISCU2, Cys95ISCU2, Cys138ISCU2,
  and a water and after Cys addition and Cys381NFS1 persulfidation is ready for sulfur
  transfer. Finally, FDX2-dependent reduction of the persulfide to inorganic sulfide
  and transient dimerization of two [1Fe-1S]-bound ISCU2 molecules enables [2Fe-2S]
  cluster formation18'
