caption: Shed Sdc-1 induces the activation of EGFR and downstream signalling pathways
  via sHB-EGF. (A) HB-EGF can be proteolytically cleaved by MMP and released as soluble
  HB-EGF (sHB-EGF). In addition, sHB-EGF can be produced by the cellular microenvironment.
  sHB-EGF and Sdc-1 form membrane-anchored complexes by binding HS chains situated
  at the Sdc-1 ectodomain. Together they activate EGFR on adjacent epithelial cells
  and thereby stimulate the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. (B) The Sdc-1 ectodomain can
  shed from cell surfaces by MMP-7 andMMP-9 proteolysis. Heparanase accelerates shedding
  of Sdc-1 by inducing MMP-9 expression and reducing the amount of HS chains, thus
  soluble Sdc-1 (sSdc-1) is formed. In addition, sHB-EGF can bind to HS chains situated
  at the shed Sdc-1. The structure and function of soluble HB-EGF/Sdc-1 complexes
  may differ from membrane-anchored HB-EGF/Sdc-1 complexes, and may enhance the activation
  of EGFR and downstream Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathways, thus further promote the resistance
  to chemotherapy.
