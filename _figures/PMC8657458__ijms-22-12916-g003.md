caption: Immunotherapeutic strategies using ROCK inhibitors. ROCK inhibition in antigen
  presenting cells upregulates their phagocytic function to eliminate cancer cells
  and mediates the adaptive immune response. In addition, blockade of ROCK in cancer
  cells can maintain enough genomic instability to activate the cGAS/STING pathway
  and evoke sequential immune cell responses. ROCK inhibition can also hamper the
  PD-L1 expression in cancer cells and persist T-cell activation. YAP nuclear localization
  is controlled by Rho/ROCK signaling to recruit immunosuppressive cells in the TME.
  Furthermore, ROCK inhibitors can alter the TME by restricting the infiltration of
  MDSCs or M2 type macrophages.
