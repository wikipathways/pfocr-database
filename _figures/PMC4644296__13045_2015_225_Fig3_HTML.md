caption: Androgen receptor activation pathways. AR transcription can occur either
  through canonical AR-FL signaling or through cross-talk between alternative signaling
  pathways. Ligand-independent AR transcription likely occurs through a number of
  mechanisms and may involve the formation of AR homodimers (as is the case with the
  AR-FL canonical signaling pathway) or heterodimerization between AR-FL, AR-Vs, and
  AR-mutants. Cross-talk between signaling pathways likely augment AR transcriptional
  activity in several ways, including through N-terminal phosphorylation, or by promoting
  AR nuclear translocation. Key nodes affected by several pathways are highlighted
  in red. RTK receptor tyrosine kinases, T testosterone, HSP heat-shock proteins,
  IL6-R IL-6 receptor, CoReg co-regulators
