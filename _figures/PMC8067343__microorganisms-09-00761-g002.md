caption: Anti-CSFV drug candidates target the CSFV life cycle or virus-host interaction.
  The schematic diagram of the CSFV life cycle in  referred to the previous literature
  reported by Li et al. [] with some modifications. Pathway Builder Tool 2.0 was used
  to draw the schematic diagram of the CSFV life cycle. Anti-CSFV molecules could
  target the CSFV life cycle including virus attachment, receptor binding and virus
  entry, virus uncoating, viral RNA replication, translation and processing of viral
  proteins, virion morphogenesis, and virus release. Anti-CSFV molecules could also
  target the intracellular signaling pathways or biological processes related to CSFV
  infection and replication, such as type I IFN signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling
  pathway, RIG-I-like signaling pathway, ubiquitin-proteasome system, TLRs signaling
  pathway, MAPK signaling pathways, autophagy, apoptosis, and metabolism and transport
  of lipids.
