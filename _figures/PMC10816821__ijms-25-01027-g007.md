caption: Effect of NAR on APP-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome signalling
  pathway. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a dual-signalling activation
  mechanism. Firstly, APP enters the organism and activates NF-κB via pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This
  prompts the entry of the P65 subunit into the nucleus for transcription, thereby
  promoting the transcription and release of inflammatory factors such as NLRP3, pro-Caspase-1,
  pro-IL-1β, and other inflammatory cytokines. Transcription and release is the preparatory
  stage of NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle activation. The second signal is stimulated
  by APP, K+ efflux, or other factors, which activates the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome
  and, in turn, elicits pro-Caspase-1 to form activated Caspase-1. The activated Caspase-1
  can cause cellular death by cleaving Gasdermin D and can activate the NLRP3–ASC–Caspase-1
  pathway to increase the maturation and release of IL-1β and IL-18. It was found
  that NAR could alleviate the APP-induced inflammatory response by inhibiting the
  dual signalling activation mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome
