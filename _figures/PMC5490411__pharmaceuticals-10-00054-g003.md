caption: Schematic overview of TGFβ signalling. Binding of a TGFβ/BMP ligand to specific
  cell surface receptors induces the formation of a heteromeric type II/type I receptor
  complex. This binding is further regulated by type III receptors/co-receptors. Upon
  ligand binding, constitutively active type II receptors activate type I receptors.
  This then leads to the phosphorylation of R-Smads (Smad 2/3 for the TGFβ subfamily;
  Smad1/5/8 for the BMP subfamily). R-Smads then form heterodimeric complexes with
  Smad 4 (Co-Smad) and translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate gene expression
  through interaction with transcription factors (TFs). I-Smads (Smad 6/7) inhibit
  receptor activation of R-Smads. Besides the canonical Smad signalling pathway, non-Smad
  pathways, such as the MAPK pathways have also been implicated in TGFβ signalling.
