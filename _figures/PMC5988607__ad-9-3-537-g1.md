caption: Signaling network of MST1 and MST2 kinase. The signaling pathways of MST1/2
  mainly include MST1/2-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway and MST1/2-FOXO signaling pathway.
  MST1/2 phosphorylates the downstream Lats1/2 and subsequently inhibits the transcriptional
  function of intranuclear YAP/TAZ, avoiding the excessive cell proliferation and
  organ overgrowth. The MST1/2 can also mediate this signaling pathway by suppressing
  GABA function. The MST1/2-FOXO signaling pathway mainly regulates the apoptosis
  process. MST1/2 phosphorylates AKT and subsequently disrupts its function of interaction
  between FOXO3 with 14-3-3 proteins. This indirectly promotes apoptosis process.
  In addition, Mst1 promotes the proapoptotic mediator NOXA transcription via the
  assistance of FOXO1. The MST1-induced JNK activation can also promote apoptosis.
  Several interacting partners such as RASSF members, DAP4, acinus and Raf-1 also
  combine with the MST1/2 and perform different biological functions.
