caption: Upon relevant ligand binding, RTK, such as EGFR, is activated and subsequently
  inducing a series of cascade reaction. First, the regulator subunits of PI3K, p85,
  dimerize and release its catalytic subunit p110. p110 enables the membrane protein
  PIP2 to phosphorylate into PIP3. PIP3 begins to recruit the downstream Akt to inner
  membranes and phosphorylated the serine/threonine kinase (Thr308 and Ser473) sites
  by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1/2 (PDK1/2). Activated Akt is involved in
  the downstream mTORC1 mediated response to biogenesis of protein and ribosome. Besides
  that, activated Akt is also involved in the regulation of cell cycle and pro-apoptotic
  and anti-apoptotic factors mediated choices of cell apoptosis and survival. Additionally,
  it is also involved in the NFκB/MDR1 mediated drug resistance.
