caption: Controlling a variety of extracellular and intracellular processes via the
  phospholipid code. (a) During apoptosis, loss of phospholipid asymmetry due to inactivation
  of ATP11C flippase induces PS exposure. PS acts as an ‘eat me' signal and can be
  detected by receptors on neighboring phagocytes (directly) and serum opsonins (indirectly)
  to trigger engulfment. (b) Similarly, cells undergoing necrosis exposes additional
  phospholipids such as PI(4)P and PA, which can be recognized by serum opsonins such
  as histidine-rich glycoprotein and mannose-binding lectin to trigger phagocytic
  engulfment. (c) The caspase-independent programmed cell death pathway of necroptosis
  involves formation of the ‘necrosome' that activates MLKL, leading to its translocation
  to the plasma membrane. MLKL oligomerization upon contact with PIP2 (PI(4,5)P2)
  and PI(5)P then mediates membrane permeabilization. (d) In the tumor microenvironment,
  elevated cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS production can trigger a loss in phospholipid asymmetry
  and expose anionic phospholipids on tumor vascular endothelium. PS exposure and
  TF overexpression can then promote assembly of circulating coagulation factors such
  as FIXa and FVIIIa on the tumor cell membrane to initiate blood clotting, which
  can drive tumor progression through elevated growth factor signaling (left). Abberant
  regulation of PI3K can lead to elevated levels of the plasma membrane second messenger
  PIP3 (PI(3,4,5)P3), a process that could mediate recruitment and activation of Akt
  and subsequently mTOR to promote tumor proliferation and survival (right). (e) The
  Gram-negative bacteria, V. parahaemolyticus uses MAM7, an adhesion molecule that
  interacts with both PA and fibronectin on intestinal epithelial cells, to mediate
  host cell entry (left). The oomycetes P. sojae translocates an effector molecule,
  Avr1b into the host cell membrane to repress host defenses, via binding of its RXLR
  motif to outer membrane PI(3)P (right). (f) Viruses such as the ebola virus use
  ‘apoptotic mimicry' to enter target cells. Ebola virus exposes PS on its viral envelope
  that binds to the TIM-1 receptor on host cells to facilitate viral uptake. (g) In
  HIV-1 infected cells, the HIV-1 Gag protein is trafficked to the plasma membrane
  via its matrix (MA) domain where it interacts with PIP2 to initiate viral budding.
  (h) Enzymatic modification of host cell phospholipids by microbial virulence factors
  can aid infection. S. flexneri secretes IpgD into intestinal host cells that acts
  as phosphoinositol 4-phosphatase to deplete plasma membrane PIP2, leading to actin
  remodeling and membrane ruffling (left). SigD from S. typhimurium displays similar
  phosphatase activity to induce membrane ruffling and facilitate formation of Salmonella-containing
  vacuoles, thereby enabling bacterial replication (right). (i) The plant defensin
  NaD1 induces cytolysis of both fungal and mammalian tumor cells through binding
  to plasma membrane PIP2, with which it forms an oligomeric complex, leading to membrane
  permeabilization. TAM, Tyro-3, Axl, Mer; Gas6, growth arrest-specific 6; MGF-E8,
