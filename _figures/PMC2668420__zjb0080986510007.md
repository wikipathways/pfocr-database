caption: Hypothetical pathway for flagellin glycosylation and LPS modification in
  A. caviae Sch3N. The biosynthetic pathway to Pse5Ac7Ac is based on the predicted
  functions of the A. caviae proteins compared with those elucidated for C. jejuni
  and H. pylori proteins (, ). The activated form of Pse5Ac7Ac, CMP-Pse5Ac7Ac, is
  then either transferred onto the flagellin by an unknown mechanism or is predicted
  to be transferred onto a sugar-antigen carrier lipid (ACL) by Lst to create an LPS
  O-antigen unit, and this O-antigen unit is subsequently transported across the cytoplasmic
  membrane by Lsg.
