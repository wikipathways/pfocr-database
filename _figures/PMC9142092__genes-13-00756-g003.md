caption: Important metabolic pathways in M1 Macs. M1 Macs have increased aerobic glycolysis,
  the process of converting glucose into lactate. An increased pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) is another characteristic of M1 Macs, which leads to the generation of the
  inflammatory mediators, nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). M1
  Macs have enhanced levels of succinate and citrate because the TCA cycle is partially
  inhibited. Furthermore, increased citrate leads to enhanced fatty acid synthesis
  (FAS) in M1 Macs. Reduced levels of electron transport chain (ETC) activity and
  production of mitochondrial ROS are also known hallmark features of M1 Macs.
