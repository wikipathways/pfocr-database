caption: 1,25(OH)2D3 and other active forms of hydroxyvitamin D3 can exert protective
  and anticancerogeneic effects by interaction with the VDR and/or alternative nuclear
  or membrane bound receptors. In addition to the classical pathway producing 1,25(OH)2D3,
  activation of D3 via combined action of CYP11A1, CYP27A1, CYP27A1 and CYP27B1 produce
  several hydroxy derivatives that can interact with the VDR, RORα, RORγ and 125D3MARRS,
  depending on the ligand structure. 1,25(OH)2D3 can also interact with these receptors
  in addition to its action on the VDR. ROR, retinoic acid orphan receptor; VDR, vitamin
  D receptor.
