caption: Opioid regulation of MF transmission and plasticity in male and female rats.
  A, A schematic of the hippocampus showing the area CA3 circuitry depicted in more
  detail in B. DG, Dentate gyrus. B, A schematic illustrates a MF innervating a CA3
  pyramidal cell (PC). The area within the dotted lines is enlarged in C and D. MFs
  innervate GABAergic interneurons but this is not shown in the diagram, for simplicity.
  Abbreviations are explained below the schematic. C, A MF bouton and postsynaptic
  excrescence from the area surrounded by a dotted line in B is shown for a male.
  C1, Basal transmission in males. Inhibition of MF glutamate release by GABAB receptors
  has been shown in male rats (; ) so a GABAB receptor is located on the MF bouton.
  Enkephalins are stored in dense core vesicles but enkephalin release is low at <0.1
  Hz, rates of stimulation that are used to study basal transmission (<0.1 Hz; ; ;
  ). C2, PTP. MOR- and DOR-mediated mechanisms of enkephalin modulation of PTP in
  males. MORs would block effects of MF GABAB receptors, disinhibiting glutamate release
  (). MOR activation would also reduce GABA release onto MF GABAB receptors, disrupting
  the normal inhibition of MF glutamate release (). DORs are expressed on MFs and
  on interneurons (), and had similar effects on male PTP as MORs, so DORs are included
  in the schematic adjacent to MORs. DORs presumably act in a similar manner as MORs
  because DORs inhibit GABAergic transmission () and transmitter release () outside
  of hippocampus. D, The MF synapse is illustrated schematically for a female on proestrous
  morning. The levels of enkephalins are higher in proestrous female rats compared
  with male rats (). D1, Basal transmission in proestrous females. High enkephalin
  levels in MFs, and movement of dense core vesicles to the plasma membrane in response
  to 17β-estradiol () could lead to some release of enkephalin even under conditions
  of basal transmission (particularly at high stimulus strengths, where effects were
  most readily detected). Given that naloxone and CTOP increased basal transmission
  in proestrous females, and this was prevented by pretreatment with saclofen without
  a change in PPF, the schematic shows a postsynaptic site of action at MORs, which
  is associated with a GABAB receptor. Regarding the type of interneuron that would
  normally activate GABAB receptors of pyramidal cell dendrites in stratum lucidum,
  it is possible that some terminals of perisomatic-targeting cells (as shown in B),
  ivy cells or neurogliaform cells (; ) do so. Stratum lucidum interneurons are strong
  candidates because their axon mainly innervates proximal dendrites, although mainly
  dendritic shafts rather than spines (). D2, PTP + LTP in proestrous females. PTP
  was similar in males and females, so the same mechanisms for PTP in C2 are shown
  in D2. However, additional postsynaptic DORs are shown in D2 to explain the finding
  in proestrous females that DORs supported a type of LTP (LF-LTP) that was weak or
  absent in males. DORs are shown as moving (curved arrows) from CA3 pyramidal cells
  dendrites and cell bodies on proestrus toward MF synapses, consistent with the preferential
  location of DORs distally on pyramidal cell dendrites and in pyramidal cell bodies
  before proestrus (), and in postsynaptic spines on proestrus ().
