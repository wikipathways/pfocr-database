caption: Mechanism involved in an inflammatory condition and its resolution using
  ω-3 PUFAs and polyphenols dietary. The action of products from PUFAs metabolization
  (hepatic biosynthesis or tissue under inflammation), lipoxins, resolvins, protectins,
  and maresins on macrophage profile change and the endothelial cells. As a result,
  there are anti-inflammatory interleukins, nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfite
  (H2S) being produced, which will provide the resolution and tissue regeneration.
  Products from polyphenols metabolization are also connected with this anti-inflammatory
  pathway to several organs in the body. M1, type 1 macrophages; M2, type 2 macrophages;
  IL, interleukin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Green lines mean resolution
  of the inflammatory process and red lines mean the uncontrolled inflammatory process
  leading to an inflammatory cascade.
