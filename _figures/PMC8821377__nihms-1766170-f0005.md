caption: Mitochondrial metabolism is connected through biochemical pathways with arginine/NO
  metabolism, which is a biomarker of asthma inflammation. The TCA pathway is linked
  to the arginine-citrulline cycle, which gives rise to NO. Arginase 2 (ARG2) is increased
  in asthmatic airway epithelial mitochondria, and feeds arginine into the TCA cycle
  via ornithine to alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) to enter TCA and increase electron transport
  chain (ETC) for energy production. The acceleration of the TCA cycle leads to intermediates
  that dampen proinflammatory signal transduction. MCTs freely diffuse into the mitochondria,
  are oxidized rapidly, and feed acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle. MCT may be protective
  against inflammation related to metabolism in those individuals with greater arginine
  metabolism as determined by FENO. ASL, Arginine succinate lyase; ASS, arginine succinate
  synthetase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; iNOS, inducible NO Synthase; OAT, ornithine
