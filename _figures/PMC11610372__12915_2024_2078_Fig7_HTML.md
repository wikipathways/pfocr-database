caption: Mechanism diagram of berberine acting on tuft cells to relieve colitis. During
  the development of colitis, gut barrier injury is accompanied by an increase in
  Th1/17 cells as well as a plethora of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Concurrent administration
  of berberine activates the bitter taste signaling pathway, thereby enhancing tuft
  cell functionality in regulating type 2 immune response and suppressing inflammation
  in the colon
