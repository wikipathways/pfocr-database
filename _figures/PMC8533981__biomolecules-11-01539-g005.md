caption: 'Mechanism of natural products against cervical cancer. Baicalein inhibits
  Cyclin D1 expression through downregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which
  in turn inhibits cell proliferation. Genistein inhibits cell proliferation by activating
  the p38 MAPK pathway. It also induces apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT-NF-κB
  pathway, which in turn induces apoptosis. Naringin promotes apoptosis by up-regulating
  the expression of Bax and caspase 3/8/9, which in turn promotes apoptosis. Kaempferol
  is pro-apoptotic by inhibiting PI3K/AKT and activating the p53 pathway. EGCG induces
  apoptosis by increasing ROS production and Bax/Bcl-2 expression. Berberine induces
  apoptosis by activating JNK and p53, while Curcumin promotes apoptosis by inducing
  Cyt c release, thereby downregulating the Ras/Raf pathway. Tanshinone IIA induces
  apoptosis through inhibition of AKT/mTOR and activation of the JNK pathway. Betulinic
  acid induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating caspase 9 and inhibiting
  the PI3K/AKT pathway. ↑: Upregulation, ↓: Downregulation.'
