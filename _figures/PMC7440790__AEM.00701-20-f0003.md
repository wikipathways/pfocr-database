caption: Phenylpyruvate/mandelate pathway in yeast demonstrating the effect of methyl
  benzoylphosphonate (MBP), an analogue of naturally occurring benzoylformic acid.
  Bar graphs represent the intra- and extracellular concentrations of metabolites
  (following 6 and 12 days of fermentation, respectively) involved in benzyl alcohol
  and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde production by H. vineae. The gray bars represent various
  concentrations in the pathway without addition of the inhibitor, while the red bars
  represent the metabolite concentrations when MBP was included from the beginning
  of fermentation. The inhibition of benzoylformic acid decarboxylase by MBP resulted
  in increased concentrations of most intermediates in the pathway. The two aldehydes
  (phenylacetaldehyde and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) were not detected; however,
  they were included anyway as putative metabolites in the reactions. AKG, alpha ketoglutarate;
  GLU, glutamic acid. Values represent means ± SD, n = 3 independent experiments.
  n.d., not determined.
