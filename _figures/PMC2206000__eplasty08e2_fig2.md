caption: Molecules and pathways implicated in sulfur mustard (SM)-induced apoptosis.
  All molecules in red have been demonstrated to be activated or upregulated in SM
  exposure. Molecules in white have been demonstrated to play a fundamental role in
  apoptosis in many other systems but have not yet been directly implicated in SM
  injury. SM-induced DNA damage is believed to lead to p53 activation. SM exposure
  also induces a rise in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+; though the mechanism
  of Ca2+; release and precise insult leading to the release remain unclear. However
  both p53 and Ca2+;signaling appear to lead to the activation of intrinsic mitochondrial
  pathways of apoptosis. While SM-induced DNA damage does induce PARP activation,
  the role of PARP in apoptosis may be cell-type dependent and the exact pathway remains
  to be demonstrated. SM exposure has also been demonstrated to lead to the upregulation
  of both Fas and FasL activating the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. However, the
  mechanism(s) of upregulation of Fas and FasL in SM injury is unknown.
