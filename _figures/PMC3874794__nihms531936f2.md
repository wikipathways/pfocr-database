caption: 'An outline of the GPI and GPI-anchored protein biosynthetic pathway. (A)
  GPI biosynthesis: After the addition of a GlcNAc unit to PI and then de-N-acetylation,
  a palmitoyl group is attached to the inositol 2-O-position. Next, three mannose
  residues are added sequentially. The final step is to attach a phosphoethanolamine
  group to the Man-III 6-O-position. The exact pathway may vary slightly in different
  species or cell types. (B) GPI attachment to proteins to form GPI-anchored proteins:
  It is realized on the lumen side of the ER membrane via GPI transamidation catalyzed
  by GPI-T. This reaction is regulated by the GPI attachment signal at the C-terminus
  of the nascent protein, and the signal peptide is replaced with a GPI anchor during
  transamidation. The lipids of GPI-anchored proteins are processed further before
  their delivery onto the cell surface via the Golgi network. (C) Schematic representations
  of the subunits and construct of T. brucei and human GPI-Ts [].'
