caption: The GlnD/GlnB/GlnE pathway (in blue) regulates glutamine homoeostasis by
  modulating GlnA (GS) activity. Intracellular glutamine inhibits EINtr autophosphorylation,
  limiting the (p)ppGpp production in +N conditions. Note that the GlnD activity is
  very likely also inhibited by intracellular glutamine. On nitrogen starvation, intracellular
  pool of glutamine drops, relieving inhibition of EINtr autophosphorylation and thereby
  increasing HPr and EIIANtr phosphorylation levels (in green). Once phosphorylated,
  EIIANtr∼P interacts with SpoT to inhibit its hydrolase activity (HD), whereas HPr∼P
  regulates indirectly SpoT synthetase activity (SD). This dual control of SpoT by
  HPr∼P and EIIANtr∼P leads to (p)ppGpp accumulation, which in turn delays the G1-to-S
  and swarmer-to-stalked cell transition.
