caption: Apoptotic signaling pathway. Caspase-8 is activated via the extrinsic signaling
  pathway by the binding of a ligand to the death receptor. The intrinsic signaling
  pathway is activated by changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and the
  subsequent release of cytochrome C, which influences the pro-apoptotic factors BAK,
  Bad, and BAX as well as the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl2 and Bcl-xl and thus triggers
  caspase-9. Both pathways merge into a common pathway, in which effector caspase-3
  finally induces apoptosis
