caption: Four pathways including three classical immune signaling pathways (Toll,
  Imd, Jak-STAT) are responsive to infection by different viruses (blue text) based
  on studies in both Drosophila and mosquitoes (italics). The Toll pathway, responsive
  to fungi and gram-positive bacteria, has been found to be antiviral in response
  to infection by Drosophila X and Dengue viruses. The Imd pathway, responsive to
  gram-negative bacteria, is antiviral in response to infection with Sindbis and Cricket
  Paralysis viruses. The Jak-STAT pathway restricts infection by Drosophila C and
  Dengue viruses. Some downstream effectors were induced by infection (red text, italicized
  for studies in mosquitoes). In addition, Drosophila recognize VSV via the glycoprotein
  VSV-G (the PAMP), through an unidentified PRR which leads to attenuation of nutrient
  signaling, likely at the level of PI3K. Repression of this pathway results in the
  induction of antiviral autophagy which attenuates VSV replication.
