caption: 'An overview of Wnt signaling pathway. As illustrated on the upper left side
  of Figure 1, in the absence of Wnt ligand, destruction complex induces the phosphorylation
  of β-catenin, and the phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized and ubiquitinated by
  YAP/TAZ-recruited β-TrCP, and subsequently subjected to proteasomal degradation.
  In addition, the E3 ubiquitin ligases Cullin 3/KLHL12 recognize DVL and induce its
  degradation. On the membrane, ZNRF3/RNF43 targets Frizzled receptor for ubiquitination
  and lysosomal degradation. In the nucleus, the inhibitory complex Groucho and histone
  deacetylases (HDAC) bind to TCF/LEF transcription factors, resulting in the inhibition
  of the Wnt signaling gene expression, as shown in the lower left side of Figure
  1. On the upper right side of Figure 1, the phosphorylated LRP receptor recruits
  Axin and DVL protein to the plasma membrane. Activated DVL inactivates the destruction
  complex. In this process, the combination of DVL and ASPM inhibits the recognition
  of Cullin 3/KLHL12. β-catenin, with the assistance of histone modifying co-activators
  such as Pygopus (Pygo) and CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300, interacts with the transcription
  factors TCF/LEF to regulate target gene expression. Frizzled ubiquitination is inhibited
  through the interaction of RSPO with LGR4-6 and ZNRF3/RNF43. “Ub” stands for ubiquitination
  and “ps” stands for phosphorylation.Abbreviations: LRP5/6, low-density lipoprotein-related
  receptors 5 and 6; DVL, dishevelled; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer
  factor; APC, the adenomatous polyposis coli; GSK3β, the glycogen synthase kinase
  3β; CK1α, casein kinase 1α; β-TrCP, β transducin repeat-containing protein; RSPO,
