caption: The local translation of Pum2 and eIF4E balance protein synthesis and regulate
  dendrite and spine morphogenesis. At low activity, Pum2 represses the translation
  of eIF4E, thus keeping protein synthesis rates low and limiting morphogenesis and
  synapse formation. High neural activity induces the transcription of miR-134; this
  leads to repression of Pum2 translation, increased translation of eIF4E, and dendrite
  morphogenesis. During development, this pathway likely maintains a basal level of
  activation that is a by increases and decreases in synapse activity.
