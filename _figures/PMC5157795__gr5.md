caption: Schematic representation of MAPK pathways in ROS signaling and responses.
  In biotic or abiotic stresses, extracellular superoxide anion (O2•−) is induced
  by RBOH proteins. Superoxide anion (O2•−) can then dismutate to form hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2) which acts as plant signaling component. Extracellular H2O2 can also be generated
  by PRX or O3·H2O2 may enter cells by aquaporins. Inside the cell, H2O2 triggers
  ROS signaling and responses (ROS-related gene expression and PCD) by disturbing
  ROS homeostasis. With different combinations of three tiers of kinases, timepoint-dependent
  activation, strength, and duration, MAPK signaling pathways act downstream of receptor-like
  kinases (RLKs) and ROS signaling to regulate ROS-related gene expression and PCD.
