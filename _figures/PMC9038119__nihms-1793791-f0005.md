caption: Schematic representation of purine metabolism. Underlined are metabolites
  and enzymes that were associated with lifespan extension. Red font color represents
  downregulation or depletion from food, while green font color represents overexpression
  or supplementation. Dashed line represents that multiple steps are involved. During
  de novo synthesis, ribose-5-phosphate is converted to inosine monophosphate (IMP),
  which can then be converted to adenine and guanine nucleotides. In worms, downregulation
  of PAICS increased lifespan. In flies, heterozygous mutations of adenylosuccinate
  synthetase (AdSS), adenylosuccinate lyase (AdSL), adenine phosphoribosyltransferase
  (Aprt), adenosine kinase (AdenoK), and adenylate kinase (AdK) increased lifespan.
  The degradation pathway converts the purine nucleotides into xanthine, which can
  then be metabolized to uric acid. Downregulation of xanthine dehydrogenase increased
  lifespan in flies, while supplementation with hypoxanthine, uric acid and allantoin
  increased lifespan in worms.
