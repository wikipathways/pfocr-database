caption: Regulation of intracellular Stat3 signalling. Stat3 signalling is induced
  by various kinases (green) in a phosphorylation dependent manner (green arrows),
  and counteracted by several regulatory proteins (red). For instance, Stat3 activation
  occurs in response to gp130 homodimerization following binding of IL6 or IL11 (blue)
  to their specific transmembrane receptor α-subunits (white) []. Phosphorylation
  of four membrane distal tyrosine (Y, black) residues by constitutively associated
  JAK-family tyrosine kinases (TK) is sufficient to enable src-homology domain (SH)-2
  mediated binding of STAT3 and, to a lesser extent, of STAT1. Once tyrosine phosphorylated,
  STAT1/3 form homo- and heterodimers, which translocate and trans-activate target
  genes, including the negative regulator SOCS3. STAT3 can also be phosphorylated
  by certain cytosolic TKs and receptor TK. Meanwhile, serine threonine kinases (STK)
  mediate serine-phosphorylation that maximizes the transcriptional activity of STAT3
  and enables its mitochondrial targeting. Gp130 also engages the Ras/ERK pathway
  through binding of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 to the membrane proximal phospho-YxxV
  consensus sequence (red, where V is valine and × any amino acid). This phosphor-tyrosine
  also provides the binding site for SOCS3 to mediate proteasomal degradation of ligand-occupied
  receptor complexes. Gp130 signaling is also attenuated by the Y-phosphatase activity
  of SHP2, while cytoplasmic PIAS3 protein sequesters Y-phosphorylated STAT3 from
  homodimerization, nuclear translocation and target gene activation. Representative
  examples of different types of bona-fide Stat3 target genes are listed [].
