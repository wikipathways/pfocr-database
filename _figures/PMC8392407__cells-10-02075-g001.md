caption: Schematic representation of the functional connections between the IGF system
  and the Ephrin axis in cancer. IGFs binding to their cognate receptors, IGF1R or
  IR-A, promote receptors phosphorylation and downstream activation of the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. Akt and MAPK phosphorylate EphA2 at Ser897 and promote ligand-independent
  activity of EphA2. The IR-A phosphorylates EphB4 at Tyr987, avoiding receptor ubiquitination
  and degradation, thereby maintaining EphB4 steady-state levels. mRNA expression
  of EphB4 is sustained by Akt-driven signals to the nucleus but the mechanism underlying
  this effect is not well characterized. Biological responses critical for cancer
  development and progression are reported.
