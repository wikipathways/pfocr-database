caption: Scheme of fabricating the human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell membrane
  (HucMSCM)‐camouflaged nano complex for miRNA‐mediated spinal cord injury (SCI) repair.
  The synthetic steps for miRNA‐124‐3p–loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle (miR‐MSN),
  rabies virus glycoprotein‐modified HucMSCM, and self‐assembly of CM‐miR‐MSN nano
  complex are shown. Administrated by tail vein injection in an SCI mouse model, the
  nano complex can cross the blood‐spinal cord barrier and target the injured spinal
  cord. Upon entering neurons and microglia, the CM‐miR‐MSN releases miRNA‐124‐3p
  into the cytoplasm to boost axon regrowth and modulate the local inflammatory microenvironment
  through the mTOR and P65 pathways, respectively. Original figure created using BioRender.com
