caption: Illustration of the possible interactions between microglia, astrocytes,
  and neurons, during early and late stage ALS. The NF-κB pathway is activated in
  both astrocytes and microglia in ALS, but its effects differ between the stages
  of the disease. Pre-symptomatically, astrocytes with activated NF-κB promote neuroprotective
  M2-type microglial proliferation, while at a later stage a neurotoxic M1-type microglial
  phenotype is induced. Subsequently, M1 microglia cause axonal damage and promote
  motor neuron death. In addition, M1 microglia induce a neurotoxic astrocytic phenotype,
  leading astrocytes to decrease their synaptogenesis and promotion of neuronal survival.
