caption: Thioredoxin-mediated redox regulation. Thioredoxin (TRX) is transcriptionally
  upregulated in response to environmental or pathological factors associated with
  oxidative stress. TRX catalyzes the cleavage of protein disulfide bonds, thereby
  contributing to the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis. TRX is secreted into
  the extracellular compartment via ER/Golgi-independent mechanisms (unconventional
  or nonclassical secretion), where it exhibits its protective effects against inflammation.
  Extracellular TRX is associated with membrane lipid rafts, where it can control
  the redox state of cell surface molecules, and influence the downstream signaling
  pathway. The internalization of extracellular TRX is also mediated through lipid
  rafts. Intracellularly, TRX interacts with a number of signaling molecules in a
  redox-dependent fashion. Txnip (also known as TBP-2 or VDUP1) has been identified
  as a negative regulator of TRX and the binding of Txnip inhibits the reducing activity
  of TRX. TRX and Txnip form a redox-sensitive signaling complex termed ‘redoxisome’,
  which may play a central role in the regulation of diverse biological processes
  ranging from metabolic and immunological pathways to inflammatory response and tumorigenesis.
