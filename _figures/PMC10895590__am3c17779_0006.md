caption: Immunorecognition of RNA/DNA fiber NANPs via the cGAS-STING signaling pathway
  can be regulated through functionalization with aptamers. The summarizing schematic
  depicts trafficking and immunostimulation following treatment with nonfunctional
  fibers and positive control (cGAMP); and the absence of activation in response to
  fibers functionalized with four aptamers per repeating unit. Orange clouds represent
  Lipofectamine 2000 (L2K) used for the delivery of all fiber NANPs to the cells
