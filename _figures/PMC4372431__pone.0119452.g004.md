caption: Pathway enrichment data indicates that Polyamine metabolism and L-arginine
  metabolism are differentially affected in stable MCI subjects (a.) and MCI subjects
  converting to AD subjects (b.). Conversion to AD (b.) preferentially channels putrescine
  towards the production of spermidines and spermines, whereas in stable MCI (a.)
  the fate of putrescine is the formation of N-acetylputrescine and 4-aminobutanal.
  Decline in the production of the neurotransmitter GABA occurs in stable MCI (a.)
  and is not further affected by conversion to AD. GABA decline is associated with
  a build-up of its precursor metabolites, N-acetylputrescine and 4-aminobutanal.
  Arrows indicate increases (↑), decreases (↓) or unchanged (↔) levels of metabolites.
