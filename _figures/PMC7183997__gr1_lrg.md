  dU:dG mismatches can be resolved by various pathways, leading to a diverse mutation
  spectrum at G:C and A:T base pairs in immunoglobulin variable (Ig V) regions. AID-induced
  uracil lesions can be repaired faithfully by canonical BER and MMR, leading to no
  SHM. Replicating over uracils by replicative polymerases generates transition mutations
  at G:C base pairs. UNG, and to a lesser extent, SMUG1, from the BER pathway, detect
  and excise uracils from DNA, creating abasic sites. Replicating over abasic sites
  by translesion synthesis polymerase from short-patch ncBER pathway generates transition
  and transversion mutations at G:C base pairs. Noncanonical MMR pathway or long-patch
  BER can excise single-stranded DNA surrounding either the dU:dG mismatch, or the
  abasic site, respectively, to initiate patch excision that leads to the engagement
  of translesion synthesis polymerases, generating both transition and transversion
  mutations at A:T base pairs. Abbreviations: AID, Activation-induced Cytidine Deaminase;
  ncBER, noncanonical base excision repair; ncMMR, noncanonical mismatch repair; SMUG1,
  single-strand selective monofunctional uracil DNA glycosylase; UNG, uracil DNA glycosylase.
