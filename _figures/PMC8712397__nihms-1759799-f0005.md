caption: O-GlcNAc dynamics play extensive roles in epigenetic regulation, development,
  and cancer. The Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway acts at the macronutrient level
  to produce UDP-GlcNAc. Nucleocytoplasmic OGT modifies transcription factors, chromatin
  remodeling proteins, RNA polymerase II, and splicing factors for extensive nutrient/stress-responsive
  epigenetic events. In development, stem cells use these programs to differentiate.
  Numerous cancers harness enhanced HBP flux to activate growth, survival, and metastatic
  programs through balancing differentiation and de-differentiation to cancer stem
  cells.
