caption: (A) Overview of the network analysis used to identify the RKT paths. First,
  the PPI network is filtered for receptors, kinases, and transcription factors (TFs)
  that affect DE genes at 24 hours. Within this subnetwork, we identified all the
  shortest paths (RKT paths) starting from a receptor, connecting up to five layers
  of kinases, and ending in a transcription factor. RKT paths were ranked on the basis
  of the fraction of their nodes that are DE at 3 hours and on the average expression
  of their nodes at 3 hours. (B) Top-ranked RKT paths containing nodes annotated to
  the focal adhesion pathway. (C) Top-ranked RKT paths containing nodes annotated
  to the MAPK signaling pathway. Note that PPI edges do not have directionality, and,
  hence, the placement of the nodes in (B) and (C) has been chosen on the basis of
  biological considerations associated with the RKT paths.
