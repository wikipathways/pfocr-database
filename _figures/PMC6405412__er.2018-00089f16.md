caption: Role of AKR1C3 in PCOS. (a) Schematic representation of the proposed mechanistic
  link between AE, insulin resistance, and lipotoxicity in PCOS, and (b) graphical
  representation of the major human androgen biosynthesis pathways. AKR1C3 plays a
  central gatekeeping role in androgen activation in the classic androgen synthesis
  pathway and the alternative (backdoor) pathway to 5α-DHT and the 11-oxygenated androgen
  synthesis pathway. Active androgens capable of activating the androgen receptor
  are highlighted in blue boxes and white font. [Reproduced with permission from O'Reilly
