caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of IL-6 and its receptor signaling pathway in SOCS-3
  induction in cells with or without IL-6R. A, Cells have both IL-6R and gp130 receptors
  such as in leukocytes. IL-6 binds to IL-6R on the cell membrane and forms a receptor
  complex with gp130. The binding process induces receptor dimerization and Janus
  kinase (JAK) phosphorylation of the signal transducing subunit gp130. Phosphorylated
  JAK further induces STAT3 phosphorylation, and dimeric STAT3 migrates to the nucleus,
  where it recognizes specific elements in the promoter of SOCS-3 gene and induces
  SOCS-3 expression. Once induced, SOCS-3 acts back on the JAK/STAT pathway to inhibit
  signal transduction, attenuate cytokine-activated signal transduction pathway, and
  suppress cytokine generation and cytokine-induced inflammatory responses. B, Cells
  have gp130, but not IL-6R, such as in endothelial cells. In the extracellular compartment
  such as in the blood circulation, IL-6 cannot directly bind to gp130 on the cell
  membrane. Instead, IL-6 binds sIL-6R and forms receptor/ligand complex, sIL-6R/IL-6.
  The complex could then bind to gp130 on the cell membrane and induce gp130 phosphorylation
  and SOCS-3 induction. Therefore, sIL-6R is considered as an agonist to IL-6 and
  plays a critical role in IL-6–induced gp130 activation, and the integrity of the
  cell membrane gp130 receptor is critical for signal transduction and SOCS-3 induction.
  C, Proposed mechanism of reduced antiinflammatory activity in vascular endothelial
  cells in preeclampsia (PE): a condition of increased sgp130 levels, increased ratio
  of sgp130/sIL-6R/IL-6, and decreased membrane gp130 receptor expression in cells
  without IL-6R. In this condition, sgp130 binds to sIL-6R/IL-6 and forms a double-receptor
  complex, sgp130/sIL-6R/IL-6, which prevents sIL-6R/IL-6 binding to membrane receptor
  gp130. Reduced membrane gp130 receptor expression then leads to less receptor binding
  activity. As a result, the JAK/STAT pathway signaling and SOCS-3 induction would
  be significantly impaired. Consequently, endogenous antiinflammatory SOCS-3 activity
  would be reduced, which possibly is the case of vascular endothelial cells in preeclampsia.'
