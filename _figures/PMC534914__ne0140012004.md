caption: Schematic diagram depicting the potential steps leading to caspase-3 activation
  in CNS trauma. Several injury-induced extracellular apoptotic stimuli most likely
  exist and the mechanisms by which these extracellular signals are transduced to
  the intracellular pathway are only beginning to emerge. However, there are several
  lines of evidence supporting the release of pro-apoptotic molecules from the mitochondria
  as important steps in activation of the caspase-3 apoptotic. Other pro-apoptotic
  factors that are released by the mitochondria, but do not involve caspase-3 activation
  include endonuclease G and AIF (not shown). Given our current understanding of the
  intracellular signaling events, there are a number of points in the apoptotic cascade
  that can be targeted. For example, the overexpression of anti-apoptotic molecules
  including Bcl-XL,1 Akt,2 and XIAP3 to the injured spinal cord may limit ongoing
  apoptosis by reducing cytochrome c release (Bcl-XL and Akt), the activation of calcineurin
  and the JNK stress-induced pathway (Akt), or caspase activation via Smac/DIABLO
  (XIAP). In addition, the identification of small, cell-permeable synthetic molecules
  that inhibit the actions or activation of caspase-34 may prove advantageous over
  existing tri- and tetrapeptide-based competitive inhibitors. Such strategies will
  be critical for understanding the contribution of apoptotic cell death to the functional
  deficits observed in SCI, and hopefully allow for development of therapeutic approaches
  targeting this cell death process.
