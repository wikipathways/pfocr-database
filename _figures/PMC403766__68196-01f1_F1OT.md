caption: The model metabolic pathway used in these studies. Solid arrows represent
  mass flow, dashed arrows represent kinetic regulation; arrow ends represent activation,
  blunt ends inhibition. S and P are the pathway substrate and product and are held
  at constant concentrations; M1 and M2 are intermediate metabolites of the pathway;
  E1, E2, and E3 are the enzymes; G1, G2, and G3 are the mRNA species for the enzymes.
