caption: 'Shematic representation of the ThdP synthesis pathway in S. cerevisiae showing
  the enzymes involved. ADT: adenosine diphospho-5-(β-ethyl)-4-methylthiazole-2-carboxylic
  acid; HET: 5-Hydroxyethyl-4-methylthiazole; HET-P: 5-Hydroxyethyl-4-methylthiazole
  phosphate; HMP: hydroxymethylpyrimidine; HMP-P: hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate;
  TMP: thiamine phosphate; Thi4: eukaryotic thiazole biosynthetic enzyme; Thi5 family:
  THI11, THI12, THI13, and THI5 genes; Thi6: encoding a bifunctional enzyme with both
  thiamine-phosphate pyrophosphorylase and HET kinase activities; Thi80: needed for
  both ThdP de novo synthesis and the conversion of external thiamine to ThdP. Genes
  upregulated in NOX vs. CON in the mid-exponential phase are indicated in red.'
