caption: Mitochondrial necrosis pathway. The mitochondrial necrosis pathway can be
  triggered by diverse stimuli including loss of nutrient/survival factors, increase
  in intracellular calcium (Ca2+), reactive oxygen species (ROS), ischemia, and ischemia/reperfusion.
  The central event in the execution of this pathway is opening of the mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore (mPTP) in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Ischemia
  deprives the myocardium of oxygen (O2), resulting in anaerobic metabolism and intracellular
  acidosis. In response, the cell pumps out the excess proton (H+) and accumulates
  sodium (Na+) by reverse operation of the Na+/H+ ion exchanger (NHE). The excess
  Na+ is, in turn, pumped out by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), which leads to an increase
  in intracellular Ca2+. Further increases in Ca2+ levels result from Ca2+-induced
  Ca2+ release from the endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR), resulting in intracellular
  Ca2+ overload. Increased concentrations of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix promote
  mPTP opening during reperfusion which neutralizes intracellular acidosis and stimulates
  ROS production. The pro-cell death protein BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) also
  sensitizes Ca2+-induced mPTP opening and necrosis. The consequences of mPTP opening
  are 1) loss of the H+ gradient across the IMM (mitochondrial membrane potential,
  Δψm), which leads to cessation of ATP synthesis, and 2) influx of water into the
  hyperosmolar mitochondrial matrix leading to mitochondrial swelling and eventual
  rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM).

  description: Mitochondrial necrosis pathway. The mitochondrial necrosis pathway
    can be triggered by diverse stimuli including loss of nutrient/survival factors,

    and ischemia/reperfusion. The central event in the execution of this pathway is
    opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in the inner
