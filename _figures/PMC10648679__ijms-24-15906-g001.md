caption: PSCs have emerged as a promising candidate for stem cells in PDAC. GLP-1R
  agonists possess the capacity to trigger the activation of PSCs situated within
  individuals diagnosed with diabetes [65]. The Wnt signaling pathway is known to
  be activated by PSCs. Wnt can directly bind to the GS promoter by connecting with
  the β-catenin/TCF7 complex. The inactive GSK3β can activate the signaling cascade,
  leading to increased GS expression within the promoter region. Glutamine metabolism
  has been observed to exert inhibitory effects on the processes of self-renewal and
  the expression of stemness/pluripotent genes [37]. The promotion of oncogenic Akt
  signaling is facilitated by the release of IGF2 through the action of glutamine.
  The production of IGF2 by beta cells is regulated by nutrients, which in turn activates
  the autocrine loop involving IGF2 and IGF1R. This loop plays a crucial role in controlling
  both the bulk and function of the β cells [43]. The activation of PSCs induces a
  cellular transformation that resembles the characteristics of myofibroblasts. This
  transformation is characterized by the production of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA),
  which serves as a protein marker for cellular activation. The process of activation
  serves to decrease the presence of fat droplets that contain retinoids. PSCs are
  of utmost importance in the intricate process of islet fibrosis formation, ultimately
  resulting in the impairment of β-cell functionality [51]
