caption: Diagram of proposed mRNA translation control pathways. Translating mRNAs
  are normally associated with eIF4F, which ultimately leads to the initiation of
  protein synthesis. In a process that can be mediated by stress sensors in the yeast
  cell plasma membrane, non-translating mRNAs may become associated with P-bodies
  that may lead to either mRNA decay or temporary sequestration of mRNAs for subsequent
  retrieval to the translating mRNA pool after adaptation to the stress. A novel eIF2α-P-containing
  complex is proposed as an alternative pathway for sequestration of non-translating
  RP mRNAs (blue-lined box). Asterisks identify immunoprecipitated proteins that were
  associated to translating or non-translating mRNAs in this study.
