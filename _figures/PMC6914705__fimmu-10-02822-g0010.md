caption: Schematic representation of how SteA suppresses the nuclear factor kappa
  B (NF-κB) pathway. (A) In absence of SteA, Salmonella Typhimurium (ΔsteA) infection
  triggers a signaling cascade, which leads to the phosphorylation of IKKα/β. IKKα/β
  then phosphorylates IκB, which is the inhibitor of NF-κB. In the inactivated state,
  IκB is bound to NF-κB, thus preventing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus. Phosphorylated
  IκB is recognized by the F-box protein β-TrCP, which further leads to recruitment
  of the Skp-1 and Cullin-1 (Cul-1) to form the SCF-E3 ligase complex. Cullin-1 is
  bound to Cand-1 in the inactive state, and upon neddylation, Cand-1 dissociates
  from Cullin-1 leading to the complete activation of the E3 ligase. The E3 ligase
  complex is responsible for the polyubiquitination of IκB. Upon polyubiquitination,
  IκB undergoes proteasomal degradation, rendering NF-κB free to translocate to the
  nucleus and transcribe proinflammatory genes. (B) During wild-type (wt) Salmonella
  Typhimurium infection (when SteA is present), SteA binds to Cullin-1 (of SCF-E3
  ligase) and suppresses the neddylation of Cullin-1 and the dissociation of Cand-1
  from Cullin-1, thereby suppressing the polyubiquitination of IκB. This leads to
  the suppression of NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory responses.
