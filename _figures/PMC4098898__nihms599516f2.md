caption: 'Intracellular glutamate is converted to glutamine in astrocytes and is exported
  to the extracellular space. Glutamine enters glutamatergic neurons as a precursor
  for the generation of the neuronal glutamate pool, by intracellular neuronal glutaminase
  (GLS). Glutamate is then released into the post-synaptic cleft. Extracellular glutamate
  secreted from neurons and/or glia activates NMDA receptors and increase intracellular
  Ca2+ levels to evoke excitatory functions (EPSP). Glutamate transporters (EAAT-1
  and EAAT-2) found in the plasma membranes of glial cells mobilize excess glutamate
  from the extracellular space into the cell interior. Glutamate may be then metabolically
  fated for either glutathione synthesis (GSH) for antioxidant function, or deaminated
  to produce the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate: α-ketoglutarate. In the astrocyte,
  glutamate can be converted to glutamine by the action of the enzyme glutamine synthetase
  (GS). Several cellular- and viral-derived soluble factors modulate the glutamate-glutamine
  balance by altering protein expression patterns, catalytic enzyme activity, and
  transcriptional and translational regulation in astrocytes, microglia and neurons.
  HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), microglia and astrocytes
  increases production and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators: TNF-α, IL-1β,
  IFN-α, and IFN-γ. HIV-1 viral proteins gp120 and Tat are secreted and further evoke
  the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, the generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen
  species (ROS/RNS), and the activation of transcription and signaling factors NF-κB,
  JNK/STAT-1, ERK1/2, and PI3 to promote neurotoxicity. TNF-α promotes Ca2+-mediated
  caspase-dependent apoptosis via NF-κB activation and phosphorylation of STAT-1 which
  subsequently leads to nuclear translocation and transcription. Tat and gp120 promote
  STAT-1 phosphorylation. HIV-1 infection, gp120, TNF-α, and MIP-2γ downregulate EAAT-2
  expression and activity and prevent excess glutamate removal. IFN-α and HIV-1 infection
  in MDM and microglia promote release of mitochondrial-bound GLS into the cytosol
  and extracellular space where it can further catalyze glutamine to generate elevated
  levels of glutamate. Stimulation of iNOS by either, TNF-α, HIV-1 infection or gp120
  and generation of high nitric oxide levels (ONOO-) diminishes GS expression and
  activity thus preventing conversion of glutamate to non-toxic glutamine. Furthermore,
  involvement of the CXCR4 axis in the neuropathology of HIV-1, triggered by SDF-1
  or gp120 binding may further potentiate glutamate-evoked toxicity via ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway. Failure of these mechanisms leads to sustained neuronal NMDAR activation,
  Ca2+ -mediated signaling and ultimately inflammation and cell death.'
