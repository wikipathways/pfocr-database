caption: A summary of the BAL proteome and signaling pathways in this study. This
  figure, following synthesis of all the data, depicts patterns of male (M) and female
  (F) mice of SP-A1 vs. KO, SP-A2 vs. KO, and SP-A2 vs. SP-A1 after FA or ozone exposure
  and bacterial infection. An up (↑) arrow (red) and down (↓) arrow (green) indicate
  increases (>25%) and decreases (>-25%), respectively. The percentage of changed
  proteins (>25% increase or >-25% decrease) is shown under M and F. In the signaling
  pathway of related proteins, up (↑) arrows (red) indicate that the number of proteins
  involved in the signaling pathways with increases (>25%) is more than that of the
  proteins showing decreases (>-25%). The number in double up (↑↑) arrows (red) is
  more than in single up (↑) arrows (red). Down (↓) arrows (green) indicates that
  the number of decreased proteins (>-25%) is more than the number of increased proteins.
  “=” means no marked changes of proteins (<25%). Based on this model, we found differential
  effects of SP-A genotypes and sex on the patterns of BAL proteomes and signaling
  pathways in response to ozone exposure and bacterial infection.
