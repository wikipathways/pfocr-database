caption: Proposed mechanism of açaí in breast cancer. In the breast tumor microenvironment,
  the macrophages are essential promoting the angiogenesis process and inflammation
  because they lead to increases in the VEGF, VEGFR-2, COX-2 and PGE2 levels. Açaí
  acts in this pathway and reduces the number of activated macrophages resulting in
  the decrease of the signaling pathways and the levels of these genes, suppressing
  growth or reducing the size of breast tumor
papertitle: Euterpe oleracea extract inhibits tumorigenesis effect of the chemical
  carcinogen DMBA in breast experimental cancer.
