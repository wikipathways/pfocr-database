caption: Effects of rFc constructs on human complement. Inhibition of the classical
  complement pathway by Fc-μTP-L309C. High-avidity binding of C1q and subsequent depletion
  of C4, but no downstream activation of the complement cascade. Consequently, Fc-μTP-L309C
  inhibits generation of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, opsonization by C3b, and deposition
  of the terminal membrane attack complex C5b-9.
