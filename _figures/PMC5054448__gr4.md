caption: Expansion of circadian rhythm signaling pathways. A. A KEGG pathway mapped
  to our predicted network. B. Sub-network of circadian rhythm signaling pathways
  constructed by seven proteins. C. An expanded sub-network of rhythm signaling pathway-related
  proteins. Proteins in blue region are two-component response regulator proteins.
  Proteins in orange are associated with plant phototonus related process. Proteins
  in green have no previously known function, which have potential molecular function
  in rice photosynthesis based on our network prediction. D. The expanded circadian
  rhythm signaling pathways.
