caption: 'Development Hedgehog Signaling which is the top scored pathway map in MetaCore
  enrichment analysis results. The family of protein called Hedgehog controls and
  patterns various aspects of the vertebrate body plan such as survival, cell growth
  and etc. Ubiquitin was down-regulated while Cullin 3 and Cul3/SPOP/Rbx 1 E3 ligase
  complex was up-regulated in stoke samples at 3, 5, 24 hours and overall stroke samples
  as compared with control. ITCH was up-regulated in overall stroke samples. Figure
