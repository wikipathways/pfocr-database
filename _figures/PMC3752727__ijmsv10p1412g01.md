caption: 'Possible mechanisms underlying the impairment of the HIF-1α pathway by hyperglycemia
  (1). A, B, C, D: the effects of MGO on HIF-1α; A: The covalent modification of HIF-1α
  leads to decreased dimerization of HIF-1α and HIF-1β, and further reduces the binding
  of HIF-1 and HRE; B: The covalent modification of p300 leads to inhibition of the
  interaction of CTAD and p300, which decreases the transactivation ability of HIF-1α;
  C: The covalent modification of HIF-1α increases its association with HSP40/70,
  which recruits CHIP and leads to HIF-1α proteasomal degradation; D: The exposure
  of RPE cells to MGO leads to destabilization of HIF-1α; E: Hyperglycemia increases
  the sensitivity of hydroxyl HIF-1α to VHL machinery; F: Hyperglycemia suppresses
  CTAD and NTAD, and finally reduces the transactivation ability of HIF-1α; G: In
  HDF and HDMEC, osmolarity is one of the mechanisms of hyperglycemia action; H: The
  impairment of HIF-1α stabilization by hyperglycemia is mediated by proteasomal degradation.
  CBP: CREB binding protein; CHIP: carboxyl terminus of the Hsc70-interacting protein;
  CREB: cAMP-response element binding protein; CTAD: carboxy-terminal transactivation
  domain; HDF: human dermal fibroblast; HDMEC: human dermal microvascular endothelial
  cells; HIF-1: hypoxia-inducible factor 1; HREs: hypoxia response elements; Hsc70:
  heat-shock cognate protein 70; Hsp40/70: heat shock protein 40/70; MGO: methylglyoxal;
  NTAD: amino-terminal transactivation domain; OH: hydroxy; PHDs: prolyl hydroxylases;
  RPE: retinal pigment epithelial cells; Ub: ubiquitin; VHL: Von Hippel-Lindau protein.'
