caption: Optogenetic switches. Molecular principles of light-induced signaling and
  optogenetic tools are illustrated. A, Natural red light-inducible signaling mediated
  by the plant photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) and optogenetic tools developed
  based on it. A1, The red/far-red light-perceiving photoreceptor phyB remains in
  its inactive Pr conformation in the dark. Upon absorption of a red light photon,
  the photoreceptor undergoes a conformational change, converting to its active Pfr
  conformation. The active form can interact with several transcription factors like
  the bHLH transcription factors of the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF) family.
  This interaction triggers light-signaling responses. In contrast, illumination with
  far-red light reconverts phyB to its inactive Pr form, abolishing the interaction
  with PIFs (). Several optogenetic approaches make use of the red light/far-red light
  switchable interaction of phyB and PIFs. A2, Selective activation of intracellular
  signaling pathways with light. Red light illumination induces the recruitment of
  the cytoplasmic fusion protein consisting of a PIF, C-terminally fused to the fluorescent
  protein YFP and the catalytic domain of the SOS protein (SOScat), to the membrane-bound,
  RFP-tagged phyB. When recruited to the membrane, SOScat is capable of activating
  the Ras-signaling cascade and inducing nuclear transport of BFP-Erk and subsequent
  Erk pathway signaling. (Adapted from .) A3, Construction of a phyB-PIF-based, red
  light-inducible split-transcription factor system. A truncated PIF6 was N-terminally
  fused to the tetracycline repressor (TetR), and the synthetic protein is bound to
  the tetracycline operator motif tetO of a synthetic reporter construct (as in ).
  In the absence of light or under far-red light illumination (740 nm), there is no
  expression from the minimal promoter, PCMVmin. Upon illumination with red light,
  phyB, C-terminally fused to the VP16 transactivation domain, interacts with the
  PIF. The spatial proximity of the transactivator recruits the transcriptional machinery
  to the minimal promoter. Only in this condition is the expression of the secreted
  human alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene activated. (Adapted from .) An adaptation
  of this system was engineered in Arabidopsis and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cells
  and the moss Physcomitrella patens (; ). A4, Reversible red light-inducible nuclear
  transport of phyB fusion proteins. phyB was C-terminally fused to the fluorescent
  protein mCherry and a nuclear export sequence (NES), while PIF3, containing an intrinsic
  nuclear localization sequence (NLS), was C-terminally fused to enhanced GFP (EGFP).
  Upon illumination with red light, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling PIF induces nuclear
  transport of phyB, while far-red radiation reversed the translocation of the photoreceptor-mediated
  by the NES. (Adapted from .) B, Natural blue light-induced signal transduction mediated
  by the plant photoreceptor phototropin1 and the light-sensitive bacterial transcription
  factor EL222. A synthetic approach based on blue light-triggered conformational
  change of EL222 and the LOV2 domain for the dual-controlled optogenetic down-regulation
  of proteins in animal cells was used. B1, EL222 is a light-sensitive transcription
  factor from the gram-negative bacterium Erythrobacter litoralis. It contains a blue
  light-sensitive LOV domain and a helix-turn-helix (HTH)-DNA-binding domain. In the
  dark, the HTH domain is docked to the LOV core. Upon illumination with blue light,
  the interaction of LOV and the HTH domain is disrupted, enabling homodimerization
  of the protein via the HTH and subsequent binding to the C120-DNA motif (). B2,
  Schematic illustration of light-induced signal transduction via the blue light plant
  photoreceptor phototropin1. In the dark, the kinase domain is bound to the LOV domain,
  inhibiting its phosphorylation activity. Under blue light, the kinase domain is
  released, inducing protein phosphorylation and downstream signal transduction. (Adapted
  from .) B3, The dual optogenetic system for targeted degradation and repression
  of expression of a protein of interest (POI) consists of a synthetic reporter module
  comprising the PSV40 promoter, for constitutive expression of a POI fused to the
  B-LID () module, and the C1205-DNA-binding motif of the EL222 protein. EL222 is
  fused to the transrepressor KRAB. In the dark, the degron (peptide RRRG) is docked
  to the LOV domain of the B-LID, and KRAB-EL222 is not able to bind to the C120 motif
  on the reporter plasmid. In this case, the POI accumulates. Upon illumination with
  blue light, the degron is exposed, triggering proteasomal degradation of the POI-B-LID
  fusion protein. Simultaneously, KRAB-EL222 dimerizes binding to the C120 motif,
  repressing transcription of the POI-B-LID. (Adapted from .)
