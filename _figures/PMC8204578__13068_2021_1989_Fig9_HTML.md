caption: Proposed model of MdFRK2-regulated cellulose synthesis in apple and poplar.
  In stems, a direct metabolic pathway for the biosynthesis of cellulose is through
  the increased cleavage of Suc into UDPG via increased SUSY activity, which is an
  alternative pathway for UDPG production from Suc via NINV. One observation of this
  study is that overexpression of MdFRK2 resulted in increased cellulose content by
  shifting F6P or G6P towards UDPG formation. With increased FRK activity increases
  the sink strength overall so there is more carbohydrate available to fuel increased
  cambial activity and that resulted in more secondary phloem. Blue boxes indicate
  a reduction in soluble sugar concentrations. Yellow boxes indicate increases in
  soluble sugar or hexose phosphate concentrations, enzyme activity or relative mRNA
  expression of genes. White boxes, no change in relative mRNA expression of genes
  that are involved in the biosynthesis of lignin (PAL1, and C4H1). Purple boxes indicate
  the relative mRNA expression of MdFRK2
