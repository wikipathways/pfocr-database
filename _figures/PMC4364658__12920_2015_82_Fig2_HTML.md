caption: 'MiRNA targeted the signaling pathways of upregulated genes in coronary atherosclerotic
  lesion. The data which compared coronary atherosclerotic plaque and IMA (internal
  mammary artery) were obtained from GEO database. SAM was used to analyze the significantly
  differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05). Those genes enriched pathways and miRNA
  target gene pathways were clustered by DAVID based on Reactome pathway. A: Whole
  blood miRNAs target pathways. B: plasma miRNAs target pathways. Illustration combined
  the miRNA target pathways which were also involved in the coronary atherosclerosis
  plaque.'
