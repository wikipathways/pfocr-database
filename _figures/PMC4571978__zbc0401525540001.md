caption: A, diagram of the workflow of mitochondrial proteomic studies. Proteins from
  mitochondria-enriched fractions of WT and kin− S49 cell were digested in three biological
  replicates of cells (WT control, WT treated for 6 or 16 h with CPT-cAMP (100 μm),
  kin− control, and kin− cells treated for 6 or 16 h with 100 μm CPT-cAMP). After
  digestion, peptides were desalted and labeled with iTRAQ reagents, and the labeled
  peptides from each sample were pooled and then separated by online two-dimensional
  LC with (PQD/CAD) pulsed Q dissociation-collision/collision0activated dissociation)
  acquisition on an LTQ-Orbitrap. Raw data for protein identification and quantitation
  were obtained using Spectrum Mill. Functional categories of proteins whose level
  of expression was increased or decreased were assigned according to the results
  of the DAVID bioinformatics tool. B, location of proteins with PKA-dependent increases
  within BCAA degradation pathway. Proteins related to degradation of leucine, isoleucine,
  and valine show PKA-dependent increases in WT S49 cells incubated for 16 h with
  CPT-cAMP. 1, Bcat2 (BCAA transferase, mitochondrial precursor) mediates the first
  step in the degradation of each BCAA. 2, Acadm (medium-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase,
  mitochondrial precursor) catalyzes a reversible step in the degradation of all three
  BCAA. Acads (short-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrial precursor)
  (3) and Acadsb (short/branched-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrial
  precursor) (4) catalyze steps in valine and isoleucine degradation. 5, Hibch (3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA
  hydrolase, mitochondrial precursor) is unique to valine degradation. 6, Acat1 (acetyl-CoA
  acetyltransferase, mitochondrial precursor) reversibly catalyzes the conversion
  of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA. 7, Mccc1 (methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase subunit
  α, mitochondrial precursor is unique to leucine degradation. 8, Hmgcs2 (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase, mitochondrial precursor) converts acetoacetyl-CoA to (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA,
  which can be converted further to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA and is, therefore,
  involved in ketone body oxidation. This pathway map is based on the (human) KEGG
  (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation
  pathway.
