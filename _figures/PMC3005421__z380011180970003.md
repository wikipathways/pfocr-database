caption: Summary of edn1 promoter regulation. A) cis-acting elements of the edn1 promoter
  are shown along with the known regulatory pathways and factors that mediate edn1
  gene activity. Although many of these signaling pathways are known to overlap, only
  the factors documented in the signal transduction pathway leading from the given
  stimulus to the edn1 gene are shown. Nucleotide positions are numbered relative
  to the primary transcriptional start site and correspond to the human edn1 gene
  (NCBI accession no. NC_000006). Signals that increase or decrease edn1 are shown
  in green and red, respectively. Akt, protein kinase B; AP-1, activator protein-1;
  ALK5, activin receptor-like kinase 5; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  1/2; FOXO1, forkhead box O1; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GSK3β, glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β; HIF-1, hypoxia inducible factor-1; IκB, inhibitor of κB; IKK, IκB kinase;
  JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen activate protein kinase; MR, mineralocorticoid
  receptor; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; Per1, period 1; PI3K,
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; TAFs, TATA associated factors;
  TBP, TATA binding protein; TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor α; RNA pol, RNA polymerase; RhoA, Ras homology kinase A; Smad, mothers against
  decapentaplegic homologue; Vezf1, vascular endothelial zinc finger binding protein
  f1. B) Alignment of the edn1 proximal promoter from Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes,
  Macaca mulatta, Bos taurus, Equus caballus, Canis familiaris, Sus scrofa, Rattus
  norvegicus, and Mus musculus. Alignment logo was created using WebLogo software
  (). Overall height of each nucleotide indicates the relative conservation at that
  position measured in bits, with 2.0 bits representing 100% conservation in all 9
  species analyzed.
