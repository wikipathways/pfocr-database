caption: GAPDH can be oxidized and S-glutathionylated, which inhibits its glycolytic
  function and directs a metabolic switch towards the pentose phosphate pathway. If
  there is too much stress, not only is GOSPEL S-nitrosylated, but also GAPDH, which
  now prefers binding Siah1 instead of GOSPEL. Siah1 has a nuclear localization signal.
  In the nucleus, GAPDH complexes with the co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300.
  CBP/p300 subsequently acetylates GAPDH. Acetylated GAPDH boosts the CBP/p300 acetylating
  function. This enhances transcription of GAPDH downstream target genes including
  cell death regulator p53. GAPDH = glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GOSPEL
  = GAPDH’s competitor of Siah Protein Enhances Life; Siah1 = Seven in absentia homolog;
  GSH = glutathione; H2O2 = hydrogen peroxide.
