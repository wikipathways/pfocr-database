caption: Schematic diagram of CCN1-mediated signaling pathway in pregnant women with
  SARS-CoV-2-infection. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, ROS increase rapidly, triggering
  immune cell activation and instigating a systemic cytokine storm. These cytokines
  enter the placental tissue through the blood circulation. In the placenta, SARS-CoV-2
  upregulates the inflammatory factor CCN1 and activates its downstream effector NF-κB.
  This signaling cascade may subsequently recruit monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes
  to the placental tissue, leading to additional cytokine secretion. The excessive
  cytokines may induce the synthesis and release of abundant anti-angiogenic factors
  within the placenta, ultimately causing disruption of endothelial function and vascular
  fibrosis
