caption: Proposed model for the regulation of post-ingested glucose metabolism by
  intestinal sweet taste receptor (STR) signaling through the coordinated effects
  of GLP-1 and GLP-2. At low luminal glucose concentrations such as during a mixed
  meal, SGLT1-mediated glucose transport in enterocytes is the primary and constitutive
  pathway for glucose absorption. In L-cells, SGLT1-mediated glucose uptake induces
  peptide secretion under the same conditions. In contrast, in response to a meal
  rich in sugars, luminal glucose concentrations rise dramatically, saturating SGLT1
  in enterocytes and L-cells. Activation of STRs on L-cells, located primarily at
  the proximal intestine, potentiates the co-secretion of GLP-1 and GLP-2. Increased
  GLP-2 in the gut induces paracrine activation of the enteric nervous system which,
  through yet unknown mechanisms, causes extensive GLUT2 translocation from the basolateral
  to the apical membrane in enterocytes. This enhances glucose absorption and subsequently
  increases plasma glucose excursions. The same time, increased GLP-1 in the blood
  potentiates insulin release by the pancreatic beta-cells which facilitates peripheral
  glucose disposal, lowering plasma glucose. Thus, STR-mediated GLP-2 and GLP-1 co-secretion
  acutely coordinates post-ingested glucose homeostasis through complementary mechanisms
  that promote glucose absorption and disposal, respectively.
