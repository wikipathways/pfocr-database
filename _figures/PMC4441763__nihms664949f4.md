caption: (A) UB code. Types of ubiquitylation events on proteins can range from monoubiquitylation
  and multi-monoubiquitylation to polyubiquitylation involving multiple change linkage
  types and possibly including branched or mixed chain structures. Unanchored UB chains
  may also be present in cells.(B) UB-AQUA. Schematic depiction of major UB-AQUA peptides
  including the major diGLY peptides and previously detected sites of phosphorylation
  in UB. Several additional UB-AQUA peptides used for locus concentration determination
  are not shown. UB-AQUA peptides containing phosphorylation sites can be used to
  determine the stoichiometry of phosphorylation. The predominant pS65 peptide identified
  is a partial tryptic cleavage product (residues 55–72) rather than the full tryptic
  cleavage product (residues 64–72) due to the inhibitory effect of the phosphate
  near the trypsin-cutting site.(C) DUB restriction analysis or UbiCRest. Schematic
  depicting how linkage specific deubiquitylating enzymes can be used in vitro to
  analyze and determine the nature of the UB chains attached to targets.(D) Schematic
  of a model for the PINK1-PARKIN pathway. In this feed-forward model, PARKIN is recruited
  to mitochondria initially via its phosphorylation on S65 within its UBL by PINK1,
  which leads to its activation and increased ubiquitylation on outer membrane proteins.
  These newly synthesized chains are substrates for PINK1, which then lead to further
  PARKIN recruitment or retention of PARKIN, thereby promoting further ubiquitylation.
  Example of trends that can be quantitatively measured for p-S65 PARKIN, mitochondrial
  UB levels, and mitochondrial p-S65 UB are shown.
