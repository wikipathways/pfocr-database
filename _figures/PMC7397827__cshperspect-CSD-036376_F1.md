caption: Simplified schematic overview of the necroptosis signaling pathway. Exogenous
  stimuli provoke assembly of the receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK)1:RIPK3
  oligomeric complex termed the necrosome, which acts as a platform for recruiting
  and activating mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). MLKL phosphorylation
  by RIPK3 induces assembly of killer complexes of unclear stoichiometry, which are
  trafficked to the plasma membrane where cell permeabilization occurs. Several conflicting
  models of permeabilization have been proposed (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ), and the precise
  mechanism remains to be deduced. (TIR) Toll-interleukin receptor, (4HB) four-helix
