caption: A proposed model depicting the role of integrin/Src/YAP1 axis in MAPK and
  PI3K/mTOR dual-inhibitor resistance. a In the sensitive cell lines, the MAPK or
  PI3K/mTOR pathway is continuously activated due to aberrant mutation or amplification,
  which leads to abnormal growth of melanoma cell. The combination of MAPK and PI3K/mTOR
  targeted therapy effectively induced melanoma cell death and inhibited the tumor
  growth. b In the MAPKi and PI3K/mTORi dual-resistant cell lines, the activation
  of integrin/Src/YAP1 signaling renders tolerance to MAPK and PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors
  and inhibition of integrin or Src or YAP1 is capable to restore melanoma cell sensitivity
  to MAPKi and PI3K/mTORi, which leads to tumor growth inhibition
