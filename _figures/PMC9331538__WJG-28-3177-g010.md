caption: 'Possible mechanism based on the action of parathyroid hormone-related peptide
  in the regulation of Met gene expression and its activation. The binding of parathyroid
  hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) to PTHR type 1 (PTHR1) in HCT116 cells promotes
  the up-regulation of Met gene expression. PTHrP also induces the activation of Met
  through Src kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway (Erk
  1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK). Once activated, Met signaling leads to molecular changes
  in the tumor cell that promote events related to the aggressive behavior of colorectal
  cancer cells. CRC: Colorectal cancer; Erk 1/2: Extracellular signal-regulated kinases
  1/2; Met: Receptor tyrosine kinase Met; P: Activators domains phosphorylated; PTHR1:
  Parathyroid hormone receptor type 1; PTHrP: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide.'
