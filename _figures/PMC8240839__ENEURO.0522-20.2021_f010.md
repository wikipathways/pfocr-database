caption: Two possible pathways by which VNS could mediate changes in A1 spiking activity.
  In the short-term, reversible pathway, VNS evokes changes in pupil size that are
  correlated with neural excitability. In the long-term, persistent pathway, which
  may be gated by the rapid and reversible changes, VNS produces long-term plasticity
  related to learning. The net change in the A1 response is the sum of short-term
  and long-term effects, .
