caption: New therapies that target the NO signaling pathway. Soluble guanylate cyclase
  (sGC) within smooth muscle cells (SMC) can be stimulated by NO, which binds to the
  heme moiety within the heterodimer, activating its cyclase function, producing cyclic
  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and promoting vasodilation. sGC can be oxidized by
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (O2·−). The oxidized form does
  not respond to NO and is quickly degraded by the proteosome. sGC activator targets
  the oxidized (ferric or heme-free) form of sGC and salvages its degradation while
  activating the cyclase and inducing production of cGMP promoting vasodilation.
