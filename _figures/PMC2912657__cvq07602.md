caption: Overview of NF-κB–IL-6 in the major regulated steps in vascular inflammation.
  A variety of pro-inflammatory agonists activate resident VSMCs, fibroblasts, and
  endothelial cells via the NF-κB transcription factor, including TNF, local and systemic
  Ang II production, and CD40 ligands, sCD40 and CD145, advanced glycation end-products,
  and oxidized LDL. Downstream, activated NF-κB coordinates the expression of monocyte
  adhesion proteins, including VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Circulating monocytes enter the
  vessel wall either from ‘inside-out’ via endothelial cell interaction, or from ‘outside-in’
  via the adventitial vaso vasorum. Monocyte chemotaxis is controlled by NF-κB-inducing
  expression of MCP-1, GM-CSF, and other chemokines. Monocyte activation is controlled
  by local IL-6 production. IL-6 acts through trans-signalling and trans-membrane
  signalling result in monocyte activation (MMP expression) and ROS resistance. Enhanced
  monocytic interaction with adventitial fibroblasts produce an amplification loop,
  enhancing MCP-1 and IL-6 production. Activated monocyte/macrophages oxidize cholesterol,
  release ROS, and matrix metalloproteinases to produce ECM remodelling that contribute
  to vascular pathology.
