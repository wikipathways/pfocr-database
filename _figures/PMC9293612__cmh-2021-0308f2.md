caption: Crosstalk between TAMs and neighboring cells in the TME of HCC. TAMs interact
  with tumor cells in various ways in HCC. This figure schematically describes the
  crosstalk between TAMs and neighboring cells in the TME of HCC. One route is the
  crosstalk between TAMs and tumor cells. Various cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular
  vesicles are produced by tumor cells. Macrophages are recruited and differentiate
  into TAMs. TAMs also produce various cytokines that confer a malignant potential
  to tumor cells. The direct crosstalk between TAMs and HCC tumor cells is mediated
  by CD47/SIRPα or CD24/siglec-10 pathways. TAMs have a critical crosstalk with CTLs,
  resulting in the inhibition of anti-tumor activity with the involvement of the PD-1/PD-L1
  or TIM-3/galectin-9 pathway. Moreover, PI3Kγ mediates the immunosuppressive activity
  of TAMs by enhancing arginase-1 activity and the IL-10 secretion of TAMs. L-arginine
  depletion by an enhanced arginase-1 activity in TAMs also causes the exhaustion
  of antigen-specific T cells in the TME. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are also recruited
  to the TME of HCC by CCL20. CCL20 is produced by TAMs and binds to CCR6 in Tregs.
  Neutrophils are recruited to the TME by chemokines produced by TAMs. They also recruit
  TAMs by secreting CCL2 and CCL17. Collectively, TAMs usually have central immunosuppressive
  roles in the TME of HCC, although the phenotype of these macrophages varies significantly
  because of the heterogeneity of HCC. TAM, tumor-associated macrophage; HCC, hepatocellular
  carcinoma; CSF-1, colony-stimulating factor-1; EVs, extracellular vesicles; TNF-α,
  tumor necrosis factor-alpha; IL, interleukin; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-beta;
  STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; SIRPα, signal regulatory
  protein alpha; PD-L1, programmed death ligand 1; TIM-3, T cell immunoglobulin and
  mucin-domain containing-3; PI3Kγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma; TME, tumor
  microenvironment.
