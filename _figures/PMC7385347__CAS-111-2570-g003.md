caption: 'Positional relationships of the selected metabolites used for the diagnostic
  model and for the predictive model of clinical stage III/IV are shown on the metabolic
  pathways. The diagnostic model included 5 metabolites: myoinositol, d‐sedoheptulose
  7‐phosphate, and lactate are derived from glycolysis; glutamic acid is incorporated
  via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle; and 2‐HG is an intermediate metabolite of
  the TCA cycle. For the predictive model of clinical stage III/IV, F6P belongs to
  glycolysis; glutamine is incorporated via the TCA cycle; l‐kynurenine is metabolized
  from tryptophan; and butyrylcarnitine is metabolized from the carnitine pathway.
