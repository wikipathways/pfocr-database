caption: Schematic illustration of mechanism of NETs in cancer. Under cancer-related
  stimulation, the level and function of PAD4 are enhanced, leading to the citrullination
  of histones and subsequent decondensation of chromatins. NET microvesicles with
  DNA-structural fibers decorated by histones, MMP, NE, MPO, cathepsin G, and other
  granule proteins are extruded from neutrophils. NET formation modulates the biological
  characteristics of cancer cells in proliferation, differentiation, migration, and
  metastasis through the involvement and crosstalk with some specific pathways and
  mechanisms including HMGB1/RAGE/IL-8 axis, IL-1β/EGFR/ERK signaling pathway, JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway, integrin α3β1 signaling pathway, CEACAM1 signaling pathway, KRAS
  mutation, extracellular RNA induction and crosstalk with inflammasomes and autophagy,
  and cancer-associated fibroblast and platelet activation. NETs, neutrophil extracellular
  traps; PAD4, peptidyl arginine deiminase 4; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; NE, neutrophil
  elastase; MPO, myeloperoxidase; HMGB1, high-mobility group box 1; RAGE, advanced
  glycation end products; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular
  regulated protein kinase; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, activator of transcription; CEACAM1,
  carcinoembryonic Ag cell adhesion molecule 1.
