caption: 'The Gut-Brain Axis. A – Neural Pathway: bacterial components activate the
  vagus nerve altering activity in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), ventral tegmental
  area (VTA) and hippocampus (Hip). Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium promote neuronal
  activation and hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as long-term potentiation (LTP)
  and increased dopamine (DA) release in the VTA in a vagus-dependent manner, modulating
  social behavior in rodents. Vagal activation can also modulate the immune pathway
  (C) through the suppression of the inflammatory response via acetylcholine (ACh)
  release and activation of nicotinic receptors on macrophages and other immune cells
  (H). B – Metabolic Pathway: Gut microbiota (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium) produces
  bioactive compounds, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which act on metabolic
  pathways via interactions with different receptors, such as GPR41 (FFAR3), GPR43
  (FFAR2), GPR109a (HCAR2), OR51E2 (human), and OLFR78 (mouse), expressed on enteroendocrine
  and immune cells, regulating gut motility and epithelial integrity.(G), and modulating
  endocrine and immune responses, promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.
  Additionally, SCFAs can regulate vagal activity through G protein-coupled receptors
  (GPCRs) (I) such as GPR41 and GPR43. Transported into systemic circulation by monocarboxylate
  transporters (MCT1 and MCT4), SCFAs can reach various organs, including the brain,
  crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via MCTs (MCT1 and MCT2) to exert central
  effects (D, E, F). SCFAs can also exert central effects regulating synaptogenesis
  and myelination (D), reducing microglial activation (F), and regulating gene expression
  due to their ability to inhibit histone deacetylases. (E). C – Immune Pathway: In
  Peyer''s patches, antigens presentation to immune cells induces both mucosal immune
  responses, including the production of IgA by B lymphocytes, and the differentiation
  of naive T lymphocytes into anti-inflammatory cytokines-producing regulatory T lymphocytes,
  which exert protective effects in the central nervous system. In these structures,
  Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Christensenellaceae can generate
  systemic anti-inflammatory responses after the presentation of their components
  to lymphocytes, exerting various regulatory effects in the central nervous system
  (D, F). Collectively, these distinct mechanisms demonstrate the capacity for in
  vivo modulation of social behavior in rodents (J)'
