caption: Activation of NKT cells. There are two general mechanisms that can lead to
  the activation of NKT cells. In the direct pathway of NKT cell activation (A), microbial
  or other lipid antigens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APC) and, after
  processing, these antigens are delivered to CD1d molecules for presentation to NKT
  cells. In the indirect pathway of NKT cell activation (B), agonists of toll-like
  receptors (TLR) interact with TLR on APC, resulting in cytokine production and activation
  of NKT cells. In many cases the latter pathway requires interaction of the semi-invariant
  T cell receptor (TCR) on NKT cells with endogenous glycolipid antigens presented
  by CD1d.
