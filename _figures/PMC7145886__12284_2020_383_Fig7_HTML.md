caption: Descriptive model of the mechanism of cold stress reducing GSH by inhibiting
  ATP hydrolysis in rice leaves. The γ-EC and Gly is converted into GSH by Glutathione
  synthetase (GSH-S) in plants. This pathway requires energy consumption (ATP). Under
  cold stress, ATP content significantly increases in the cold susceptible cultivar,
  indicating that it is not inhibited by stress. In contrast, cold stress inhibits
  the hydrolysis of ATP, resulting in low GSH accumulation, thereby reducing available
  energy. γ-EC, γ-glutamylcysteine; Gly, Glycine
