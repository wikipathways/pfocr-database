caption: Aging-related upregulation of AP-1 signaling in VSMC. Aging is associated
  with an increase in growth factors that bind to receptors and lead to phosphorylation
  of the Shc/RAS pathway or the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI3K. This in turn leads
  to phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Activated ERK1/2 is translocated into the nucleus
  to either phosphorylate, and thereby potentiate the transcriptional activity of
  TCF that can bind to fos promoters and initiate Fos transcription, or directly phosphorylate
  the Fos proteins. Regulation of the JNK pathway is influenced by many MKKKs. After
  phosphorylation by MKK4/7, JNK also enters the nucleus. The combination of Fos and
  Jun proteins forms the AP-1 transcription factor, which regulates a wide range of
  genes for cellular processes involved in VSMC proliferation, migration, ROS production,
  and extracellular matrix degradation.
