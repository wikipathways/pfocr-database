  albicans regulates filamentation by three main signaling pathways, which include
  the HOG MAPK pathway, the Cek1-mediated MAPK pathway, and the Ras1-cAMP pathway.
  Gene deletion mutants of each component of these MAP kinase pathways were examined
  for their ability to form filamentous microcolonies in RPMI 1640 at 37°C and 5%
  CO2.
