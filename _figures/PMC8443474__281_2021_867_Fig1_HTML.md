caption: AHR signaling pathway. The inactive AHR is complexed with the chaperon HSP90,
  co-chaperon p23, AIP, and c-SRC in the cytoplasm. Ligand binding results in conformational
  changes of AHR, dissociation of the protein complex, and AHR translocation into
  the nucleus. In the nucleus, AHR forms a heterodimer with ARNT. AHR/ARNT binds to
  dioxin/xenobiotic responsive elements (DRE/XRE), inducing transcription of various
  target genes. Additionally, in complex with other transcription factors, AHR can
  interact with alternative binding sites. AHR activation is limited in a negative
  feedback loop by the AHR repressor AHRR inhibiting AHR/ARNT dimer formation and
  by the AHR-induced enzymes CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 which degrade AHR ligands. Besides
  its transcriptional activity, AHR also functions as part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase
  complex driving the proteasomal degradation of target proteins, most notably of
  hormone receptors
