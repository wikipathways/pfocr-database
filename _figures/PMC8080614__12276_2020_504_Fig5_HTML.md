caption: a Several mutations in enzymes in the glutaminolysis pathway are responsible
  for the production of oncometabolites. Mutation of IDH1 and IDH2 produces R-2-HG
  from α-KG, which, when accumulated, leads to the inhibition of dioxygenases, in
  turn leading to the activation of TET and JHDM enzymes inside the nucleus. Mutation
  of SDH arrests the TCA cycle, resulting in an increase in the succinate concentration.
  A high concentration of succinate has an effect similar to the oncometabolite effect
  of R-2-HG. Additionally, impaired function of FH prevents further metabolism of
  fumarate, leading to its accumulation. FH impairment inhibits the function of Keap1
  and PHD, which stimulates the transcription of protooncogenes. Gln glutamine, Glu
  glutamate, α-KG α-ketoglutarate, IDH isocitrate dehydrogenase, 2OGDH 2-oxoglutarate
  dehydrogenase, SDH succinate dehydrogenase, FH fumarate hydratase, R-2-HG R-2-hydroxyglutarate,
  Keap1 Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, PHD prolyl hydroxylase, TETs ten-eleven
  translocation enzymes, JHDMs JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases, Me methylation.
  b. Glutamine anaplerosis is a key mitochondrial metabolic pathway for cancer cell
  growth and survival. Influx of glutamine-derived α-KG into the TCA cycle replenishes
  the intermediates and consequently generates NADH, FADH2, and GTP. The generated
  GTP can be readily converted to an equal amount of ATP. Additionally, glutamate
  and α-KG produced via glutaminolysis participate in the malate-aspartate shuttle,
  promoting the transport of NADH from the cytosol into mitochondria. Elevated mitochondrial
  NADH and FADH2 levels collectively contribute to enhanced ATP production via OXPHOS
  through the ETC. Gln glutamine, Glu glutamate, Asp aspartate, αKG α-ketoglutarate,
  GOT1/2 glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1/2, MDH1/2 malate dehydrogenase 1/2, OAA
  oxaloacetate, OGC 2-oxoglutarate carrier, AGC aspartate-glutamate carrier, ETC electron
  transport chain.
