caption: a, Sensing of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) leads
  to the formation of a primary membrane-bound receptor signalling complex (complex
  I) that activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) signalling pathways, leading to proinflammatory gene expression. A secondary,
  potentially cytotoxic, cytosolic complex (complex II) originates from the dissociation
  of complex I components from the receptor, and from their association with FAS-associated
  death domain-containing protein (FADD) and caspase 8. Three cell death checkpoints
  actively repress TNF cytotoxicity. First, the inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase
  (IKK) checkpoint consists of the inhibition of receptor-interacting serine/threonine
  protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) kinase activity through phosphorylation mediated by complexes
  of IKKα and IKKβ and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKKε. Second, the NF-κB checkpoint,
  which consists of the NF-κB-dependent transcriptional upregulation of prosurvival
  genes (including the gene encoding FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP)). Third,
  the caspase 8 checkpoint, which consists of RIPK1 inactivation by caspase 8-mediated
  cleavage. b, Inhibition of the IKK checkpoint leads to activation of RIPK1 in complex I,
  and the subsequent kinase-dependent assembly of complex IIb, which drives apoptosis
  or pyroptosis depending on the cellular context. Of note, conditions that affect
  proper IKKα–IKKβ activation will additionally inactivate the NF-κB checkpoint. c,
  Conditions leading to inactivation of the NF-κB checkpoint, such as the in vitro
  use of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, activate complex IIa and result
  in RIPK1 kinase activity-independent apoptosis. d, Inhibition of the caspase 8 checkpoint
  induces RIPK1 cytotoxicity by the kinase-dependent assembly of complex IIb and the
  necrosome. TNF sensing in caspase 8-inhibited conditions will result only in necroptosis
  induction. Additional checkpoints may exist. cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
