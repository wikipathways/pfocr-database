caption: Autophagy pathway. Physiologically, activated mTOR phosphorylates Atg13 which,
  after dissociation by ULK1/2 complex, inhibits autophagy. On the contrary, in conditions
  of higher nutrients depletion or stress, or in the presence of rapamycin (inhibitor
  of mTOR pathway), autophagy is activated. When mTOR is inhibited, dephosphorylated
  Atg13 is activated and reassociates to ULK1/2 complex, inducing the phagophore formation.
  ULK1/2-Atg13 recruits PI3KC3 complex with Beclin-1, Vps34, AMBRA-1, and UVRAG, resulting
  in the initial steps of phagophore nucleation. Elongation process begins with the
  recruitment of cytosolic nascent pro-LC3 that is cleaved by Atg-7-activated Atg4
  and transformed in the soluble cytosolic form LC3-I. In the next step, Atg4 transfers
  LC3-I to Atg3, triggering the lipid conjugation to PE (phosphatidylethanolamine),
  and converting the soluble form LC3-I into autophagic vesicle-associated form LC3-II.
  LC3-II is conjugated to the autophagosome membrane by mean Atg5 and Atg12 and regulates
  both the fusion of autophagosome to lysosome membranes and the degradation of cargo
  binding ubiquitinated proteins trapped by p62/SQSTM1.
