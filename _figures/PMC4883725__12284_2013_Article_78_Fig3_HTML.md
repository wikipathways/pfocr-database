caption: 'Simplified biochemical pathway of NADP-ME subtype of C4 photosynthesis that
  is being genetically engineered into indica rice variety by the C4 rice consortium. PEPC
  does the first carboxylation in the MC producing oxaloacetate which is further converted
  to malate by MDH. This C4 acid is transported from MC to the BSC chloroplasts where
  it is decarboxylated by NADP-ME to pyruvate and CO2 is released to Rubisco to carry
  out the Calvin cycle reactions. In C4 rice, Rubisco should be expressed in BSC and
  hence the increased CO2 levels at its site will reduce its oxygenation activity
  subsequently reducing the photorespiration. 3-PGA: 3-Phosphoglycarate, CA: Carbonic
