caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in vascular calcification. (A)
  In the absence of Wnt ligand, β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3 and destroyed,
  avoiding its translocation to the nucleus to trigger the vascular calcification.
  (B) If Wnt ligands bind to its LRP and Frizzled co-receptors, GSK3 is inactivated,
  β-catenin is stabilized in the cytoplasm and translocate into the nucleus which
  activates target genes promoting vascular calcification. LRP, low density lipoprotein-related
  receptor; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; TCF,
  T cytokine enhancer factor; P, phosphorylation
