caption: A partly hypothetical model describing the characteristic shifts of balance
  within the sphingomyelin/salvage pathway attributed to immune low and immune high
  tumor subtypes/subgroups of patients. The scheme shows the interconnected network
  of the sphingolipid mediators and the corresponding sphingolipid-modifying enzymes;
  those genes that are upregulated in either subgroup () are highlighted in red. Furthermore
  shown is a schematic illustration of cellular interplay at the tumor site. The model
  consolidates cumulative data from the correlation analysis and unsupervised hierarchical
  clustering for sphingolipid/lysophosphatidate/immune-associated genes, clustering-based
  patient stratification and comparative analysis of gene expression data sets, expression
  profiles of genes composing the sphingolipid/lysophosphatidate/immune-associated
  signature in ovarian cancer cell lines, and integrative analysis of the expression
  patterns across transcriptomic data sets. SPC, sphingosylphosphorylcholine; LPC,
  lysophosphatidylcholine. (For interpretation of the references to color in this
  figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
