caption: Schematic diagram showing DTX family related signaling pathways and interactions
  in cell development. DTX family proteins regulate cell differentiation via several
  mechanisms and signaling pathways, such as poly-ubiquitination of HIF1-α and MEKK1,
  monoubiquitination of Jmjd1c, methylation of histones, and JNK and Wnt signaling
  pathways. In the regulation of cell anergy, the T cell receptor is activated and
  monoubiquitination of PKCθ is induced by DTX1, following the alteration of GADD45
  β and Cbl-b expression. In the regulation of DNA damage repair, DTX3L promotes the
  polyubiquitination of the RAP80-BRCA1 complex, monoubiquitination of histones, and
  STAT1phosphorylation. The combination of DTX2 and PARP1 is also involved with the
  regulation of DNA damage repair. Upon viral infection, TBK1 is phosphorylated thereby
  activating the IFN-I pathway. The DTX4, NLRP4, USP38, and TRIP complex inhibits
  the IFN-I pathway via enhancing polyubiquitination of TBK1, which is also associated
  with DYRK2 and TRAF3IP3. STAT1, signal transducer and activator of transcription
