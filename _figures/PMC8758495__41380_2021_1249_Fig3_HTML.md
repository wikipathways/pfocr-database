caption: Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is a single transmembrane protein. For the
  non-amyloidogenic pathway (left), APP is cleaved by A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease
  (ADAM) family proteases to yield the membrane-tethered C83 fragment and extracellularly
  released soluble APP alpha (sAPPα). In the amyloidogenic pathway (right), APP is
  first cleaved by β-secretase (β-APP-cleaving enzyme-1 or BACE1). CTF-β fragment
  is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase composed of Presenilin 1 or 2, Nicastrin,
  PEN2 and APH-1. This proteolytic processing releases amyloid-β into the extracellular
  space. APP intracellular domain (AICD) from the initial β-secretase cleavage is
  released into intracellular space. Adapted with permission from ref. [].
