caption: 'The connection between neuroinflammation and ferroptosis in PD. During neuroinflammation,
  the expression of DMT1 in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia induces the production
  of hepcidin in astrocytes and microglia, while downregulating the expression of
  FPN1 in all 3 cell types, leading to increased iron accumulation in neurons and
  microglia. Astrocytes absorb iron through DMT1, and regulate iron metabolism depending
  on the iron oxidase activity of CP. In addition, astrocytes can also regulate gene
  expression related to GSH by activating Nrf2 signaling pathway, thus reducing oxidative
  stress triggered by ROS. However, with the persistence of neuroinflammation, the
  protective function of astrocytes is gradually weakened, which leads to further
  injury of neurons. The pathological accumulation of α-syn is a key feature of PD.
  The accumulation of α-syn inhibits the transport of TF, leading to the accumulation
  of TF and an increase in intracellular iron levels. Iron can bind to α-syn and catalyze
  lipid peroxidation reactions, accelerating the oxidation and aggregation of α-syn,
  which in turn leads to further iron accumulation. In the case of iron deposition,
  intracellular oxidative stress activates NF-κB, which further aggravates neuroinflammation.
  The accumulation of iron leads to oxidative stress, which activates inflammatory
  signals, and neuroinflammation further destroys iron homeostasis and aggravates
  ferroptosis, which continuously aggravates the damage of DAn. The interaction between
  neuroinflammation and ferroptosis constitutes a vicious circle in the pathogenesis
  of PD. Abbreviations: DMT1, divalent metal transporter 1; FPN1, ferroportin 1; CP,
