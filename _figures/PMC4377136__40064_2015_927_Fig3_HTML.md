caption: 'Lysine catabolism in monogastric animals. Lysine is catabolized via the
  saccharopine pathway and the pipecolate pathway. The enzymes involved include: (1)
  Lysine α-ketoglutarate reductase; (2) saccharopine dehydrogenase; (3) lysine oxidase;
  (4) spontaneous; (5) peperideine-2-carboxylic acid reductase; (6) pipecolate oxidase;
  (7) spontaneous; (8) enzymes including aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase,
  aminoadipate aminotransferase, α-ketoacid dehydrogenase, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase,
  glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase, enol-CoA hydratase, and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  for seven steps; (9) thiolase; (10) enzymes of the TCA cycle. Adapted from Wu ().'
