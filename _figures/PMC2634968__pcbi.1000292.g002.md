caption: There were a total of 49 ligands (see  for complete list), 14 receptors,
  and 6 outputs. Because the ligands are already well characterized with respect to
  their receptor specificity, it is unnecessary to carry out the input–output analysis
  at the level of the external ligand. Rather, the inputs can simply be considered
  to be signals from the receptors—this reduces the number of inputs from forty-nine
  to a mere fourteen. NF-kappa-B, CRE/AP-1, and ROS production were all highly redundant
  targets as almost all of the receptor inputs activated these outputs. IRF3 and IRF7
  were much less redundant and were only activated in the case of a small subset of
  receptor inputs.
