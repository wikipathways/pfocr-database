caption: Genes found to modulate the accumulation and secretion of different aggregated
  species of aSyn. To study the effect of the genes tested on different steps of the
  process of aSyn aggregation, we used cell models of aSyn oligomerization and aggregation
  (dashed rectangles). In an unbiased large-scale RNAi screen, we identified 4 trafficking
  genes that modulate aSyn oligomerization, aggregation, toxicity and secretion. Rab8b
  is involved in polarized vesicular trafficking (endoplasmic reticulum to plasma
  membrane). Rab11a regulates endocytic recycling pathway and participates specifically
  in transferrin recycling. Rab13 regulates trans-Golgi network, recycling endosomes
  and cell/tight junctions. Slp5 is a Rab27a effector protein and plays a role in
  exosome release. We found that Rab8b, Rab11a and Rab13 overexpression inhibits oligomerization
  and aggregation of aSyn. Moreover, Rab11a and Rab13 increase aSyn secretion through
  the recycling endocytic (RE) route only when aSyn inclusions are present in the
  cell. Slp5 inhibits aSyn aggregation, but not oligomerization, and increases aSyn
  secretion in the cell model of aSyn oligomerization.
