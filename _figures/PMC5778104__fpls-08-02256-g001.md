caption: Model of auxin-brassinosteroid (BR) crosstalk. In Arabidopsis, the perceptions
  of BR and auxin signal are recognized by BRI1 and TIR1 receptors, respectively.
  BR binds to the extracellular domain of BRI1 and promote it interacts with co-receptor
  BAK1 to form a more active BR receptor complex, which in turn lead to the dephosphorylation
  and inactivation of BIN2. The inactivation of BIN2 lead to the dephosphorylation
  of two BR homologous transcription factors BZR1 and BZR2, which move into nucleus
  to activate transcription of genes containing BRRE or E-box in their promoter region.
  BIN2 also can phosphorylate ARF7 and ARF19 to suppress their interaction with AUX/IAAs
  and thereby enhance the transcriptional activity on their target genes. TIR1 receipt
  the auxin signaling and interact with AUX/IAA proteins as co-receptor of auxin.
  The AUX/IAA then is degraded through ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, and the auxin
  transcriptional regulators auxin response factors (ARFs) are released from AUX/IAA
  repression and activate transcription of genes with auxin responsive elements (AUXRE)
  in their regulatory region. Some ARFs can also binds to the promoter of BRI1 and
  positively regulates its expression which then activates the BR signaling. Primary
  crosstalk occurs by activation of genes that contain both BRRE/E-box and AUXRE in
  their promoter region, allowing both signaling pathways to directly regulate transcription.
  Secondary crosstalk occurs through expression of genes that are either auxin or
  BR responsive, but the activities of which control expression of genes that regulate
  the response and signaling of other hormones.
