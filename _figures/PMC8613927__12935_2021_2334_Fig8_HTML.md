caption: Schematic model illustrating the potential pathway associated with morphine-induced
  malignant biological behavior in H460 cells. Morphine acts on an MOR located on
  the H460 cell membrane, leading to Src activation. The activation of Src increases
  the levels of phospho-PI3KTyr607 and phospho-AKTSer473, which is inhibited by PP1.
  Src activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, leading to an increase in the expression of
  proapoptotic factors and a decrease in the expression of antiapoptotic factors.
  These changes induce Caspase-dependent and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell
  death, which was inhibited by deguelin. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway further
  activates mTOR, leading to an upregulation of factors that induce cell proliferation,
  migration, and invasion
