caption: Role of miR-433 in regulating cardiac fibrosis. The expression of miR-433
  is elevated during cardiac fibrosis via the TGFβ pathway. Two targets of miR-433
  have been validated, AZIN1 and JNK1. AZIN1 regulates the TGFβ/Smad3 signalling pathway,
  but the exact relationship and mechanism requires further study. Regulation of JNK1
  (another target of miR-433) has cross-talk with ERK and P38 kinase pathways. Other
  fibrotic miRNAs predicted to bind to AZIN1 and JNK1 are shown within the green ovals.
  Dashed arrows to AZIN1 and JNK1 signify that further work is required to assess/validate
  the contribution of these miRNAs regulating these targets and cardiac fibrosis.
