caption: Schematic diagram showing the involvement of CPT1C and ceramides in the hypothalamic
  ghrelin signaling pathway. Ghrelin stimulates the hypothalamic SIRT1/p53/AMPK axis,
  leading to decreased levels of hypothalamic malonyl-CoA, the physiological inhibitor
  of CPT1 enzymes. In the “classical” mechanism of ghrelin action, this effect promotes
  disinhibition of CPT1A, increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation, and altered reactive
  oxygen species levels. These metabolic changes ultimately activate the nuclear transcription
  machinery (pCREB, FoxO1, and brain-specific homeobox transcription factor [BSX]),
  increasing mRNA expression of Agrp and Npy genes. Here, we demonstrate the existence
  of a parallel downstream pathway involving CPT1C, a specific brain isoform located
  in the ER, which triggers a short-term increase in ceramide synthesis after ghrelin
  treatment. This new pathway is of physiological importance because the orexigenic
  action of ghrelin is totally blunted in CPT1C KO mice or in mice treated with an
  inhibitor of ceramide synthesis. The fact that central ceramide treatment induces
  food intake and triggers orexigenic neuropeptides expression in CPT1C KO mice, which
  have the canonical ghrelin signaling pathway activated during satiating conditions,
  but not in WT mice, indicates that both branches need to be activated for ghrelin
  to exert its orexigenic effect.
