caption: Dynamic mechanisms of inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. (A) Intertumor
  heterogeneity in patients with BRAF-mutant tumors results in a partial response
  to BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy. Intratumor heterogeneity in BRAF-mutant tumors
  comprises of cells at distinct transcriptional cell states due to genetic (green),
  non-genetic (e.g. pathway rewiring) and epigenetic mechanisms (gradient from yellow
  to brown). A cell’s BRAF or MAPK dependency can determine its ability to tolerate
  or adapt to BRAF or MAPK inhibitor therapies. A cell with higher BRAF dependency
  is more sensitive to short-term BRAF inhibitor therapy (dashed outline), whereas
  a cell with lower BRAF dependency can better tolerate the drug over time by relying
  on non-genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Long-term drug treatment can result in
  a stable, drug-resistant phenotype, whereas adaptive drug resistance is reversible.
  (B) Upon drug treatment, drug-tolerant cells can employ non-genetic (relief of MAPK
  negative feedback, MAPK pathway reactivation, and alternate pathways, such as the
  PI3K pathway) and epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation, histone modifications,
  histone-modifying enzymes, and RNA-based mechanisms) to escape drug effect. Over
  time, these drug-tolerant, drug-adaptive mechanisms can ensure cells survive long
  enough to acquire advantageous mutations that lower the cell’s BRAF dependency and
  lead to long-term resistance.
