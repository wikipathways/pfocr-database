caption: Proposed mechanisms for resveratrol's suppression of CYP1 induction. An early
  model showed that resveratrol inhibited the transformation of the AHR to its nuclear
  form by forming a complex with the ARNT. Resveratrol has also been shown to act
  later in the pathway, inhibiting the binding of the nuclear AHR complex to the XRE
  or inhibiting the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the DNA. These mechanisms
  block the transcription of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Still, others have proposed that CYP1
  inhibition occurs posttranscriptionally. AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; ARNT, aryl
  hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; CYP, cytochrome P450; XRE, xenobiotic
  response element.
