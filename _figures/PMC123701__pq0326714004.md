caption: 'Predicted functional systems and general metabolic pathways of M. kandleri
  compared with the counterparts in other archaeal methanogens. Specific enzymatic
  reactions predicted in a given species but not in the other two are color-coded
  blue (M. kandleri), green (M. thermoautotrophicus), and red (M. jannaschii). Gene
  identifiers are shown only for M. kandleri. The methanogenesis pathway is shown
  by magenta arrows. Reactions for which no candidate enzyme was confidently predicted
  are shown by dashed arrows. Final biosynthetic products are shown as follows: light
  blue for amino acids, dark yellow for nucleotides, brown for sugars, pink for cofactors.
