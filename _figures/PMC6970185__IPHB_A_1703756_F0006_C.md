caption: Proposed signalling pathway triggered by NB and cisplatin in U251 cells.
  NB synergistically enhances the anticancer efficacy of cisplatin through induction
  of ROS overproduction. The accumulation of intracellular ROS activates DNA damage-mediated
  downstream signalling transduction and regulates pro-apoptosis MAPK family members
  and pro-survival kinase Akt, leading to the obvious enhancement of apoptosis.
