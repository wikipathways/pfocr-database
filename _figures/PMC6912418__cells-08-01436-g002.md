caption: 'Mechanism and signaling pathways involved in mitochondrial adaptation in
  heart following exercise. Acute exercise augments mitophagy depending on the phosphorylation
  of AMPK (protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1) and ULK1 (unc-51
  like autophagy activating kinase 1). AMPK could be activated by exercise-related
  increase of AMP/ATP ratio, sympathetic activation and other signaling. Mitophagy
  removes dysfunctional mitochondria and reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS). AMPK
  also promotes mitochondrial biogenesis through regulating PGC-1a. Regular exercise
  mainly activates the IGF1-PI3K-Akt pathway, which targets several transcription
  factors in nucleus and contributes to cell growth, cellular survival, metabolic
  homeostasis, and mitochondrial maintenance. Abbreviations: AMPK, AMP-activated kinase;
  Sirt1, Sirtuin 1; PGC-1a, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma co-activator
  1a; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3 kinase; Akt, serine/threonine-protein
  kinase; C/EBPβ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein b; Cited4, cbp/p300- interacting
  transactivator with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 4; SRF, serum response
  factor.'
