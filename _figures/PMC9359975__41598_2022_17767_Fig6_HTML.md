caption: wBCC attenuated the development and metastasis of BCC. The incorporation
  of WJ-EV to BCC resulted in wBCC that showed the impaired expression of HIF1α and
  its target genes, which are involved in attenuating proliferation, metastasis and
  angiogenesis. wBCC and their derived EV attenuated cancer progression by reducing
  the proliferation and metastasis of the original BCC, the angiogenic abilities of
  EC and EPC, and the differentiation of AT-MSC to CAF.
