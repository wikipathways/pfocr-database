caption: Cuticular wax biosynthetic pathway (www.kegg.jp/kegg/kegg1.html) related
  genes in Pse. libanotica under drought stress. Cuticular wax are synthesized and
  secreted in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). First, long-chain fatty acids (C16–C18)
  are synthesized in the plastids. Second, the saturated C16 and C18 fatty acyl-CoA
  precursors are elongated to very long chain fatty acyl-coenzyme As (VLCFA-CoAs)
  in ER. Once the VLC-acyl-CoAs are synthesized, they can be further released as free
  VLCFAs that can either be directly exported as cuticular waxes, or undergo further
  modifications in the via either the alkane-forming pathway or the alcohol-forming
  pathway
