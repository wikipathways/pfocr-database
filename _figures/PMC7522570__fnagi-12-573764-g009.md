caption: Expression of orthologs annotated for the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) tricarboxylic acid cycle (ko00020) pathway present in pleural ventral
  caudal sensory neuron (PVC) expression clusters with decreasing trend (P4 and P5).
  Each node of the pathway diagram represents an ortholog assigned to an Aplysia californica
  transcript. Nodes are divided into seven colored sections, from left to right, ages
  6 to 12 months. Node sections are colored according to their mean centered and variance
  scaled expression, together representing the expression trends of each node across
  the aging process. Nodes that are not colored were absent from the gene sets of
  expression clusters P4 and P5. Pathway enrichment suggests decreased oxidation of
  acetyl-CoA in these neurons with increasing age.
