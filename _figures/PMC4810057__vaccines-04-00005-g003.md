caption: Schematic illustration of currently evaluated compounds interfering with
  JAK/STAT signaling in the context of colitis and CAC. An aberrant immune response
  essentially contributes to colitis and many of the responsible cytokines signal
  through JAKs, which are targeted by tofacitinib, perfecitinib and GLPG-0634. IL-6/STAT3
  signaling is believed to lead to development of CAC, and inhibiting IL-6 or its
  receptor might therefore prevent malignant transformation. JAK inhibition by ruxolitinib
  might become an option in manifest CRC.
