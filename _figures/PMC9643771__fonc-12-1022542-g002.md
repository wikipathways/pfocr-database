caption: Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy Synergistically Promote Antitumor Immune Responses.
  One potential combined therapeutic approach is to combine radiotherapy with immune
  checkpoint inhibition. Radiotherapy promotes DNA damage within cancerous cells,
  which can consequently be recognized by cGAS and lead to activation of the cGAS/STING
  pathway to promote antitumor immunity through interferon signaling. Likewise, immune
  checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, can modulate an
  augmented antitumor immune response by turning off immune checkpoints. Under normal
  conditions, these checkpoints result in a decrease in the cytotoxic abilities of
  T cells; however, when turned off, this enhances the cytotoxic effects of T cells
  and results in enhanced antitumoral effects. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies
  suggest synergy exists in combining radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors
  in breast cancer patients and studies are currently underway to determine the best
  ways oncologists can implement these interactions.
