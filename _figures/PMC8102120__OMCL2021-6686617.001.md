caption: 'Canonical caspase-1-dependent and noncanonical caspase-4/5/11-mediated pyroptosis
  pathways [, , , , , , , , ]. The canonical pyroptosis signaling pathway: the NLRP3
  inflammatory body is activated by pathogen- associated molecular pattern (PAMP)
  or damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), and the AIM2 inflammatory body is
  activated by dsDNA. They induce the activation of downstream caspase-1. On one hand,
  this promotes the release of inflammatory factors IL-1β and IL-18; on the other
  hand, this specifically cleaves GSDMD. The GSDMD-N terminal fragment aggregates
  at the cell membrane to cause membrane perforation and induce pyroptosis. Noncanonical
  pyroptosis signaling pathway: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) directly activates caspase-11
  (human homology caspase-4/5) then cleaves GSDMD to form the GSDMD-N terminal, inducing
  pyroptosis. Pannexin-1 is cleaved and lysed by the activated caspase-11 (homologous
  to human caspase-4/5), which damages the channel for membrane small molecule release,
  leads to leakage of intracellular ATP, activates the ligand-gated channels (P2X7)
  of purinergic receptor P2X, accelerates K+ efflux, mediates the NLRP3/caspase-1
  signaling pathway, and indirectly promotes the release of inflammatory factors IL-1β
  and IL-18.'
