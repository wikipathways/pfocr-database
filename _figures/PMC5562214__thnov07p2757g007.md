caption: 'Cardioprotective effects of macitentan. (A) Pathway studio representations
  of proteins involved in myocardial infarction and endothelial cell apoptosis showing
  the changes in protein expression levels in the myocardium of the sunitinib group
  and the (vehicle and sunitinib+macitentan) groups. Red indicates significantly (p<0.05)
  upregulated proteins, blue significantly (p<0.05) down-regulated proteins. (B) Ingenuity
  representation of the changes in Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex expression in the
  myocardium of the sunitinib group in comparison to the (vehicle and sunitinib+macitentan)
  groups. Green shows significantly (p<0.05) downregulated proteins in the sunitinib
  group. (C) Table of the diabetes-related pathways most significantly perturbed by
  sunitinib in mouse myocardium and correction by macitentan. n=6 for each group.
  n.s: non-significant. Proteins described in Table .'
