caption: O2/sulfide ratio and ATP/O2 ratio. (Left) sulfide oxidation pathway SQR releases
  S0 that can be further oxidized by a dioxygenase (DiOx) presumably ETHE1, the resulting
  molecule H2SO3 (sulfite) could be subject to the addition of another S0 atom (from
  a second SQR reaction) by a sulfur transferase (TST), presumably rhodanese, to form
  thiosulfate (H2S2O3) or to further oxidation into sulfate (H2SO4) by sulfite oxidase
  (SuOx) that yields an electron to complex IV of the respiratory chain. When thiosulfate
  or sulfite are the final products, ATP production results from electron transfer
  from quinone to oxygen, hence 1.6 ATP per H2S engaged in the oxidation pathway.
  Thiosulfate formation consumes two sulfide and oxygen molecules, hence 3.2 ATP/2O2.
  If sulfite is the final product, one sulfide and 1.5 oxygen molecules are used,
  hence 1.6 ATP/1.5O2. When sulfate is the final product, sulfite oxidation with electron
  transfer from cytochrome-c to oxygen results in 1.1 ATP per sulfite, hence per H2S
  engaged in the oxidation pathway. The sum is therefore 2.7 ATP (1.6 + 1.1) and two
  oxygen molecules, hence 2.7 ATP/2 O2. (Right) resulting O2/H2S and ATP/O2 ratios
  for the different sulfide oxidation products. The graphics show the relative contribution
  of respiratory chain (empty) and sulfur oxidation (gray) to oxygen consumption.
