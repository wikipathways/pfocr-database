caption: The crossroads of epigenetics and immune pathways. Epigenetics plays an integral
  role in the regulation of immune pathways. In the TLR signaling pathway, histone
  methyltransferase SYMD5 catalyzes H4K20me3 to repress TLR4 expression; histone demethylase
  PHF2 activates TLR4 expression by removal of H3K9me1. Knockdown of JNK will inhibit
  m6A and METTL3 expression; In the sGAS-STING signaling pathway, DNA demethylases
  TET2 elevate cGAS levels, histone demethylases KDM5B and KDM5C inhibit STING expression.
  Histone demethylase Jmjd3 upregulates NF-kB-mediated inflammatory cytokine levels
  by removal of H3K27me3; In the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, activator of transcription
  STAT recruits histone acetyltransferases and chromatin-remodeling enzymes, and histone
  methyltransferase EZH2 and histone acetyltransferase p300 elevate STAT levels. IFN-γ
  produced by this signaling pathway can induce H3K27me3, which is associated with
  gene repression; In the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathway, knockdown of METTL3 abolishes m6A
  modification and reduces stabilization of PD-L1 mRNA, and m6A reader IGF2BP and
  YTHDF regulates RNA stability and expression levels of PD-L1. DNA methyltransferase
  inhibitor 5-aza-2’ deoxycytidine (decitabine) enhances PD-1 expression. PAMP, pathogen
  associated molecular pattern; DAMP, damage associated molecular pattern; TLR, Toll-like
  receptors; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; TRAF6, Tumor necrosis
  factor receptor-associated factor 6; IRF3, Interferon regulatory factor 3; ISGs,
