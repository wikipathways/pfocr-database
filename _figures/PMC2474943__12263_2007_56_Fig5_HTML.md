caption: Potential points of action of flavonoids within p38 pathway. p38 is activated
  by a variety of cellular stresses including osmotic shock, pro-inflammatory inflammatory
  cytokines, lipopolysacharides, UV light and growth factors. The activity of p38
  is regulated by the MKK’s, MKK3 and MKK6, which in turn, are regulated by the upstream
  MAPKKK, MEK1/4 and ASK. Active p38 regulates the phosphorylation of the transcription
  factors ATF-2, Max and MEF2, which are implicated in cellular response to a variety
  of cellular stress, including genotoxic agents and inflammatory cytokines
