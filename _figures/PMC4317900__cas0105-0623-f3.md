caption: Disease-specific mutations in T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia
  and natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma. Both JAK and signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (STAT) are mediators of diverse cytokine signaling. After binding
  of the cytokine to the receptor, JAK proteins are activated, followed by phosphorylation
  (P) of STATs. Activated STATs are dimerized and enter the nucleus to initiate target
  gene transcription. Both JAK3 mutation in NK/T-cell lymphoma and STAT3 mutation
  in T-cell large granular leukemia enhance the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.
