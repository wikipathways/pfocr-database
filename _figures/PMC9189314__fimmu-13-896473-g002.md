caption: Canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways to activate inflammasomes.
  Canonical signaling pathway to activate inflammasomes is mediated by two signaling
  steps. The priming step involves PAMPs or DAMPs binding to TLRs to initiate NF-
  κB signaling pathway, which promotes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 production. Then endogenous
  danger signals activate inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 in the second step.
  Active caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD into GSDMD-NT; cut pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into mature
  IL-1β and IL-18. The GSDMD breaks a pore on the cell membrane to help IL-1β and
  IL-18 secretion. There are three main mechanisms involved in inflammasome activation.
  Extracellular ATP binds to the P2X7 receptor and causes potassium efflux and NLRP3
  activation. Uric acid and amyloid are endocytosed in a lysosome-dependent manner,
  promoting lysosome rupture and cathepsin B release and resultant inflammasome assembly.
  TXNIP and mtDNA accumulation in a ROS-dependent manner activates inflammasomes.
  However, in the non-canonical signaling pathway, intracellular LPS or toxin initiates
  caspase-11, promoting inflammasomes assembly and caspase-1 activation. Then both
  active caspase-11 and caspase-1 cleave GSDMD into GSDMD-NT, leading to cascaded
  reactions similar to the canonical signaling pathway.
