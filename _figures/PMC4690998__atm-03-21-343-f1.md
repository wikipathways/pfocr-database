caption: IFN-γ/CXCL10 signaling pathway in vitiligo. Binding of IFN-γ to its receptor
  (IFN-γR) activates the JAK-STAT pathway and leads to CXCL10 secretion in the skin.
  CXCL10 promotes recruitment of additional autoreactive CD8+ T cells through its
  cognate receptor (CXCR3), which increases inflammation through a positive feedback
  loop. Compounds that have been developed to target each step are indicated in red.
