caption: 'The differences between large and small cholangiocytes: i) in size; ii)
  in location within the biliary tree and iii) in the secretive pathway, are depicted.
  As reported in figure small cholangiocytes are able to migrate and replace the large
  ones when the latter are damaged. Symbols: ● = secretin. Abbreviations: AE2 = Anion
  Exchanger 2; ATP = Adenosine Triphosphate; cAMP = adenosine 3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate;
  CFTR = Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator; IP3 = Inositol trisphosphate;
  PKA = Protein Kinase A; p-PKA = phosphorylated-Protein Kinase A; PR = purine receptor;
  SR=secretin receptor; TMEM 16A= Transmembrane member 16A.'
