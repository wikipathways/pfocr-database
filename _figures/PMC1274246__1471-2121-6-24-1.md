caption: 'Schematic representation of the purine nucleotide synthesis pathway in yeast.
  The solid thin lines represent the plasma membrane. ADP: adenosine-5''-diphosphate;
  AMP: adenosine-5''-monophosphate; ATP: adenosine-5''-triphosphate; GDP: guanosine-5''-diphosphate;
  GMP: guanosine-5''-monophosphate; GTP: guanosine-5''-triphosphate; IMP: inosine-5''-monophosphate;
  PRPP: 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate; SAMP: S-adenosine-5''-monophosphate; XMP:
  xanthosine-5''-monophosphate. Genes are shown in grey italic font and encode the
  following enzymatic activities: AAH1: adenine deaminase; ADE8: 5''-phosphoribosylglycinamide
  formyltransferase; ADE12: adenylosuccinate synthetase; ADE13: adenylosuccinate lyase;
  ADK1: AMP kinase; AMD1: AMP deaminase; APT1: adenine phosphoribosyltransferase;
  FCY2: purine cytosine permease; GUA1: GMP synthetase; GUK1: GMP kinase; HPT1: hypoxanthine-guanine
  phosphoribosyltransferase; IMD2, IMD3, and IMD4: IMP dehydrogenases (IMD1 is not
  indicated here because it is not expressed and is thought to be a pseudogene). Mycophenolic
  acid (MPA) inhibits IMP dehydrogenases.'
