caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming in RCC. RCCs are characterized by a high glycolytic
  phenotype with increased lactate production, where glucose is the major energy source.
  Pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and glutaminolysis are also increased
  to sustain nucleotides, amino acids and lipids biosynthesis. In contrast, TCA cycle
  activity is decreased in these tumors. In the scheme proteins that were found upregulated
  in RCC are labeled red, while downregulated proteins are labeled blue. Abbreviations:
  ACC, Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase; Acetyl-CoA, Acetyl-coenzyme A; ALDO, Fructose-bisphosphate
  aldolase; ENO, Enolase; FAS, Fatty acid synthase; G6PD, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
