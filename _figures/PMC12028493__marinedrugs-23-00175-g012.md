caption: The proposed mechanism underlying the anti-PD effect of epicoccin A. Epicoccin
  A co-treatments can reverse the abnormal expressions of genes related to neuronal
  development, contributing to the improvement of neuronal damage in PD. Co-treatments
  with epicoccin A improved the aberrant gene expressions in the mTOR/FoxO signaling
  pathway, which might activate pink1/parkin-dependent mitophagy. This process facilitated
  the degradation of damaged mitochondria and α-synuclein fibrils, thereby inhibiting
  the formation of LBs. Moreover, epicoccin A co-treatments can inhibit oxidative
  stress by reducing ROS accumulation, further enhancing mitophagy and consequently
  alleviating the onset and development of PD

  description: The proposed mechanism underlying the anti-PD effect of epicoccin A.
    Epicoccin A co-treatments can reverse the abnormal expressions of genes related

    PD. Co-treatments with epicoccin A improved the aberrant gene expressions in the
    mTOR/FoxO signaling pathway, which might activate pink1/parkin-dependent mitophagy.
    This process facilitated the degradation of damaged mitochondria and α-synuclein

    can inhibit oxidative stress by reducing ROS accumulation, further enhancing mitophagy
