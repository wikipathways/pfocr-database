caption: Diagram of signaling pathways in a principal cell that have been exploited
  to bypass the VP/VP type 2 receptor (V2R) pathway, and induce apical membrane accumulation
  of AQP2. The three pathways shown are 1) calcitonin-receptor signaling via cAMP
  to induce AQP2 phosphorylation via PKA, and membrane accumulation of AQP2; 2) the
  cGMP-mediated pathway that is activated by phosphodiesterase (PDE5) inhibition using
  sildenafil (Viagra); AQP2 phosphorylation in this case occurs via PKG; and 3) statin-mediated
  actin cytoskeleton depolymerization that results in AQP2 membrane accumulation.
  By inactivating RhoA, simvastatin depolymerizes actin and inhibits AQP2 endocytosis,
  leading to plasma membrane accumulation. AC, adenylyl cyclase.
