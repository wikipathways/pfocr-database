caption: Working model of PGE2-E2pathway in the cerebellum. Arachidonic acid is converted
  to PGH2 by the enzymes COX1/2, and further metabolized to PGE2 via PGE synthase-1.
  PGE2 interacts with its receptors EP(1–4), increasing aromatase activity to convert
  testosterone to estradiol, which binds to its receptors ERα and ERβ and regulates
  Purkinje cell dendritic growth. Estradiol acts as a brake on growth; changes to
  the pathway that increase E2 stunt dendritic growth (red), and changes to the pathway
  that decrease E2 allow for dendritic overgrowth (blue). E2, Estradiol; ICI, ICI
  182,780.
