caption: 'Our strategy to increase seed oil accumulation by overexpressing the plastidial
  pyruvate transporter BASS2 under the control of a seed-specific promoter in developing
  A. thaliana seeds. A simplified diagram depicting the oil metabolism pathway in
  developing A. thaliana seeds. During seed development, sucrose imported from maternal
  tissues is converted to G6P. Then, G6P is metabolized to PEP. In the cytosol, PEP
  is either converted to pyruvate or enters a plastid via PPT. In plastids, pyruvate
  is used as a substrate for fatty acid biosynthesis, and the resulting fatty acids
  are channeled into the TAG biosynthesis pathway in the ER. Cytosolic pyruvate is
  used for many metabolic pathways, such as protein biosynthesis and the TCA cycle.
  By increasing pyruvate flux into plastids by the seed-specific overexpression of
  the pyruvate transporter BASS2, we expected to increase fatty acid biosynthesis
  in the plastids and finally enhance TAG biosynthesis in developing Arabidopsis seeds.
  This figure was modified from van Erp et al. () Plant Physiology. Ovals indicate
  transporters responsible for each transport process: GPT, Glucose-6-phosphate translocator
  (green); PPT, phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator (green); BASS2, bile-acid
  sodium symporter 2 (red); ABCA9; ATP-binding cassette A subfamily member 9 (blue).
  Other abbreviations are: Suc, sucrose; G3P, Glucose-3-phosphate; G6P, Glucose-6-phosphate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PKc, cytosolic pyruvate kinase; PKp, plastidic pyruvate
  kinase; Pyr, pyruvate; FAS, fatty acid synthase complex; MEP, methylerythritol phosphate;
  PC, phosphatidylcholine; DAG, diacylglycerol; TAG, triacylglycerol; Acyl-CoA, acyl-Coenzyme
  A; Acetyl-CoA, acetyl-Coenzyme A; TCA, tricarboxylic acid. Black lines indicate
  pathways active in the cell during seed maturation. Red indicates the flux of newly
  incorporated pyruvate by pyruvate transporter (BASS2) in transgenic lines.'
