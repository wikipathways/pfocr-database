caption: Activation of the mTORC1 signaling cascade coordinates increases in glucose
  uptake (via Glut1 induction) and the PPP and c-Myc activities that are each needed
  for nucleotide biosyntheses. These processes and the c-Myc-dependent increases in
  ribonucleotide reductase expand the pools of all 4 dNTPs to facilitate HIV-1 reverse
  transcription (step 1). mTORC1 also increases the transport of glutamine into the
  cell via the induction of ASCT2 expression, thereby elevating the level of α-KG
  that enters the TCA cycle for citrate production. Glut1-mediated glucose transport
  also enhances the entry of another citrate precursor, pyruvate, into the TCA cycle.
  ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is also activated by actions of both mTORC1 and mTORC2
  and facilitates conversion of the expanded pool of citrate to Ac-CoA. Increased
  Ac-CoA fuels the acetylation of the α-tubulin that stabilizes microtubules resulting
  from α-tubulin polymerization, which are used for cytoplasmic trafficking of HIV-1
  toward the nucleus (step 2).
