caption: Schematic representation of NLRC5’s role in renal diseases. As is described
  in the above content, NLRC5 is widely expressed in renal related tissue and has
  also been demonstrated to involve in a variety of kidney diseases for and wide.
  A number of functional studies have reported that Up-regulation or down-regulation
  of NLRC5 may play a key role in the underlying pathogenesis of renal disease. For
  instance, knock out of NLRC5 could inhibit the proliferation of renal fibrosis cells
  and decrease the accumulation of ECM. Besides, RNA interference-mediated Knock down
  of NLRC5 attenuates renal I/R injury in vitro through the activation of PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway.
