caption: Activation of the EGFR-Ras-MAPK pathway in C. elegans vulval development
  is initiated when LIN-3/EGF ligand secreted by the gonadal anchor cell (AC) binds
  to the LET-23/EGFR receptor, causing it to dimerize and undergo autophosphorylation
  (; ). This event allows the SEM-5/Grb2 adaptor to bind phosphorylated LET-23 and
  recruit the SOS-1/Sos1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (; ). SOS-1 promotes
  the exchange of GDP for GTP on the LET-60/Ras GTPase, which in turn activates a
  protein kinase cascade that includes LIN-45/Raf, MEK-2/MEK, and MPK-1/MAPK/ERK (;
  ; ; ; ; ; ). Targets of MPK-1 phosphorylation include the complex of LIN-1/Ets and
  LIN-31/FoxB1, which dissociates after phosphorylation, thereby allowing activated
  LIN-31 to promote the acquisition of vulval cell fates (). Additional positive regulators
  of vulval fates include SUR-2/Med23 and LIN-39/Hox-B5, a member of the homeobox
  family of proteins (; ). Known negative regulators include members of the SynMuv
  group of proteins and CBP-1/p300 (; ). Pathway modulators include LIN-2/CASK, LIN-7/Lin-7C,
  and LIN-10/APBA2, which mediate the subcellular localization of LET-23 and UNC-101/AP-1μ-1
  and APM-1/AP-1μ-2, which promote LET-23 endocytotic recycling (; ; ; ). SLI-1/c-Cbl
  negatively regulates the pathway by targeting activated LET-23 for internalization
  and degradation (; ). The roles of ARK-1/Ack and DEP-1/Dep1/Scc in inhibiting LET-23
  signaling are not yet understood. RHO-1/RhoA and its GEF, ECT-2/Ect2, positively
  regulate the pathway downstream of SEM-5 (). The role of the PTP-2/PTPN11 protein
  tyrosine phosphatase is not well understood, but it may act at several nodes upstream
  of LET-60 signaling (; ). LET-60 GTP hydrolysis is stimulated by GAP-1/Gap1 ().
  The putative scaffold proteins KSR-1/Ksr1 and SUR-8/Sur8 are required for robust
  signaling downstream of LET-60 (; ; ; ). SUR-5/Sur5/AACS, an aminoacyl CoA synthase,
  inhibits the pathway at the level of LET-60 through an unknown mechanism (). MPK-1/MAPK/ERK
  is dephosphorylated by the MAPK phosphatase (MKP) family protein LIP-1/MKP, which
  renders it inactive (). In addition, KSR-1 activity is regulated in part by zinc
  ion concentrations that are controlled through CDF-1/Znt1 and SUR-7/CDF, by the
  SUR-6/PP2A protein serine/threonine phosphotase, and by the PAR-1/MARK1 kinase (;
  ; ; ). Yellow fill indicates proteins that were first implicated in EGFR-Ras-MAPK
  signaling through studies in C. elegans.
