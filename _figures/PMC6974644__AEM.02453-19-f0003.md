caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of the new sugars attached to sipanmycin derivatives
  obtained in this work. Sip enzymes involved are shown in bold letters. Squares mark
  the sugars in the final molecules of SIP-A1/SIP-B1 (blue), SIP-A2 (light orange),
  SIP-A2b (dark orange), and SIP-A3/SIP-B3 (green).
