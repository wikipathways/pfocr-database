caption: Stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by growth factors activates
  the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway and leads to the accumulation of phosphorylated active
  ERK1/2 in the nucleus. ERK1/2 are recruited to the promoters of target genes where
  they phosphorylate numerous targets in the nucleus including ETS transcription factors
  (e.g. ELK1), downstream kinases (e.g. MSK1) and transcriptional cofactors, which
  contribute to the induction of IEGs such as FOS and EGR1. In addition, ERK1/2 can
  also phosphorylate components of the nucleosome remodeling complex SWI/SNF, the
  nuclear pore, and the mRNA processing machinery. It appears that ERK2 can also act
  as a repressor, independently of its kinase activity, by binding to a DNA motif
  found at the promoters of genes regulated by IFNγ.
