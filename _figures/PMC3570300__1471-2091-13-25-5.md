caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of proteins induced by DNP.A, overview of 15
  specific functional networks, each of which contains 11 or more “focus” proteins
  (proteins that were significantly up- or down-regulated). Each box contains an arbitrary
  network number. B, cancer, renal and urological disease, and cell death. C, cancer,
  reproductive system disease, and cell death. D, cellular movement, lipid metabolism,
  and molecular transport. E, protein synthesis, cell death, and cellular growth and
  proliferation. Red, up-regulated proteins; Green, significantly down-regulated proteins;
  White, proteins known to be in the network but were not identified in our study.
  The color depth indicates the magnitude of the change in the protein expression
  level. Lines connecting the molecules indicate molecular relationships. Dashed lines
  indicate indirect interactions, and solid lines indicate direct interactions. The
  arrow styles indicate specific molecular relationships and directionality of the
  interaction. Abbreviations are shown in Additional file : Table S2.'
