caption: Ad5-PSA directly infects immature DCs (a receptor-mediated process) (1a)
  resulting in DC maturation and presentation of MHC class I in association with PSA
  epitopes (2). In addition, Ad5-PSA infects somatic cells (1a’) which are then recognized
  (1b) and killed (1c) by NK cells through an E1A-independent pathway involving NKG2D/stress-induced
  protein interaction. NK-mediated killing results in apoptotic bodies (1d) being
  taken up by immature DCs (1e) and promoting DC maturation and presentation of PSA
  epitopes in association with MHC class II (2). In the lymph node, activated DCs
  trigger activation and proliferation of PSA-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes (3a) possibly
  with the aid of activated CD4+ T lymphocytes (3b) supplying additional IL-2 (3c).
  PSA-specific CTLs then circulate to tumor sites and kill tumor cells through PCD
  (4).
