caption: Insulin signaling defects in PCOS. There is a post-binding defect in insulin
  signaling in PCOS resulting in marked decreases in insulin sensitivity (see ). There
  is a more modest defect in insulin responsiveness. The signaling defect is due to
  serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 secondary to intracellular
  serine kinases. This results in decreased insulin-mediated activation of PI3-K and
  resistance to the metabolic actions of insulin. There is constitutive activation
  of kinases in the ERK/MAPK mitogenic pathway in PCOS, and these kinases contribute
  to inhibitory serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in PCOS skeletal muscle. Serine phosphorylation
  of P450c17 increases its activity, and it has been postulated that the same kinase
  may inhibit insulin signaling and increase androgen production in PCOS. S-S, Disulfide
  bond; Y, tyrosine; S, serine; P, phosphate. This figure is used with the permission
