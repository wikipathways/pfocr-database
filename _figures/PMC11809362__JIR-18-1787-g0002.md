caption: 'Multiple levels regulate the RECK expression mechanism: (A–E) Regulation
  of RECK at the transcriptional level: (A) Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 nuclear
  translocation is active, which activates the hypoxic element rHRE2 and suppresses
  RECK promoter activity. HDAC1 collaborates with other enzymes (e.g HIF-1a, SP1)
  in this process. (B) The inflammatory process activates Ras genes and causes the
  release of ROS to promote the nuclear translocation of the SP1 transcription factor.
  These above-mentioned reactions would subsequently facilitate SP1’s binding to the
  SP1 site in the promoter region, inhibiting RECK promoter activation. (C) DSK#638
  and DSK#639 inhibit the binding of SP1 to and RECK promoters. (D) The FXR agonists
  WAY-362450 and GW4064 can facilitate FXR to bind to the FXR element in RECK intron
  one and hence stimulate RECK transcription. (E) The methylation of the RECK promoter
  results in the downregulation of RECK expression at the gene level when the activation
  of the ras gene and its downstream ERK1/2 signaling pathway occurs in an environment
  induced by ROS or under certain illness conditions. Some lncRNAs serve the same

  was found in the promoter region. Among the above SNPS, only rs16932912(G/A) was
