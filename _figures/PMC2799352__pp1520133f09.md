caption: Schematic model describing the function of the PP2C-PYL/RCAR interaction
  in the control of the ABA signaling pathway. In the absence of ABA, PYR-PYL/RCAR
  proteins may interact with PP2Cs, but these PP2Cs remain active. Upon ABA perception,
  PYR-PYL/RCAR proteins interact with PP2Cs, maintaining these PP2Cs as inactive and
  subsequently activating the transcription of ABA-responsive genes (including PP2Cs).
  The specific colocalization of FsPP2C1-PYL8/RCAR3 in the nucleus is shown.
