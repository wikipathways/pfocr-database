caption: Regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathways of PRRs mediated
  by protein palmitoylationAfter stimulation, NLRP3 recruits ASC and forms an ASC
  prion-like oligomer to interact with pro-caspase-1 to be composed of an inflammasome,
  leading to caspase-1 activation. Caspase-1 cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) and the proinflammatory
  cytokines pro-IL1β and pro-IL18, causing the production of the N-terminal fragment
  GSDMD (GSDMD-NT), IL1β and IL18. Then, GSDMD-NT oligomerizes and forms GSDMD pores
  in the membrane, leading to the release of IL1β and IL18 and the induction of cell
  pyroptosis. GSDMD can be palmitoylated at Cys191/Cys192 (human/mouse) to facilitate
  its cleavage, and its transport to the membrane. ZDHHC5, ZDHHC7, ZDHHC9, and ZDHHC14
  have been shown to act as palmitoylases of GSDMD-NT. APT2 inhibits palmitoylation
  of GSDMD-NT on the membrane, promoting GSDMD oligomerization and the formation of
  GSDMD pores. In addition, SMPDL38 palmitoylation controlled by ZDHHC5 inhibits NLRP3
  inflammasome activation
