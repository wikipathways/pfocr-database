caption: Schematic representation of PGAM5 activating NF-κB signaling pathway to promote
  polarization of M1 macrophages. PGAM5 can enhance the phosphorylation of ASK1, and
  phosphorylated ASK1 can activate the downstream p38 and JNK pathways, leading to
  the activation of mTOR. Activated mTOR can promote the phosphorylation of IKK, which
  in turn phosphorylates IκB and dissociates it from NF-κB, resulting in the activation
  and translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, initiating related gene transcription,
  leading to the polarization of M1 macrophages and the secretion of pro-inflammatory
  factors such as IL-1β and TNF-α
