caption: The pro-tumour activities of neutrophils.a) Neutrophils can express ligands
  of immune checkpoints expressed on T cells, such as PD-L1. In response to TGFβ,
  neutrophils produce Arg1, leading to T cell dysfunction and suppression of the T
  cell-mediated anti-tumour response. b) Neutrophil-derived mediators, such as Bv8,
  MMP9, S100A8, S100A9, and NETs play an important role in the formation of metastasis
  through different mechanisms, such as tumour angiogenesis or entrapment and migration
  of circulating cancer cells. c) Neutrophil-derived ROS sustain DNA damage and genetic
  instability in epithelial cells; d) Neutrophils elastase (NE) and neutrophil-derived
  growth factors (i.e. EGF, HGF, PDGF) sustain the proliferation of tumour cells.
  e) Tumour cells drive the production of IL-1β in macrophages, which in turn activates
  the expression of IL-17 in γδ T cell, leading to the activation of the IL-17/G-CSF
  pathway and the recruitment of immunosuppressive neutrophils in the pre-metastatic
  lungs.
