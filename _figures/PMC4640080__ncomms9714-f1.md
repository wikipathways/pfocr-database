caption: Metabolic pathways in the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi altered under
  ocean acidification (HC, CO2 1,000 μatm; pHNBS 7.81) based on proteomic, physiological
  and biochemical analyses. More phenolic compounds were biosynthesized, subsequently
  biodegraded and then metabolized via β-oxidation and Krebs cycle, generating more
  ATP in the HC-grown cells by mitochondrial respiration. This extra energy can be
  used to counter the effects of high CO2/low pH stress from the environment. Adenylate
  kinase (ADK) was upregulated, and glycolysis was accelerated in the HC-grown cells.
  On the other hand, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) was downregulated, reflecting
  the slower loss of ATP loss in the HC-grown cells. The novel pathway including β-oxidation
  and the Krebs cycle becomes enhanced under ocean acidification to meet the extra
  energy requirement for maintaining homoeostasis. The red and green symbols represent
  up- and downregulated proteins or processes, respectively.
