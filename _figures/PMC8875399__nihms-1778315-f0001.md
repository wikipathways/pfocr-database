caption: As cells undergo apoptosis, various “find-me” signals [i.e., nucleotides
  (ATP/UTP), chemokine (CX3CL1), and lipids (LPC and S1P)] are secreted or exposed
  on the outer leaflet of plasma membrane. Pannexin 1 (PANX1) is important membrane
  channel responsible for ATP/UTP export, whereas LPC is released by activated ABCA1.
  Upon binding to receptors, these find-me signals stimulate chemotaxis of macrophages
  to injured site. Meanwhile, they could promote resolution of inflammation by suppressing
  gene expression of proinflammatory factors (i.e., CXCL1 and CXCL2), and upregulating
  anti-inflammatory genes (i.e., IL-10 and VEGF) as well as pro-resolving mediators
  (i.e., Nr4a1, Thbs1). The efferocytic macrophage-mediated resolution of inflammation
  is primarily through the inhibition of NF-κB pathway and the activation of PPARγ
  signaling cascade. Importantly, interaction of CX3CL1 to its receptor also promotes
  MFGE8, a key bridging molecule of “eat-me” signal. On the other hand, necrotic cells
  elicit unique “find-me” signaling. For example, formylated peptides are released
  from damaged mitochondria and interact with FRP1 on macrophages to increase chemotaxis.
  LTB4 is secreted through MVBs-exosomes that can act in conjunction with formylated
  peptides. H2O2 is shown to activate Src family of kinase Lyn, leading to enhanced
  monocyte/macrophage recruitment. In addition, H2O2 can regulate other “find-me”
  molecules such as formylated peptide, LTB4, and IL-8. Complement proteins can be
  deposited to target cells or released into extracellular area to interact with neighboring
  cells. FPR1 indicates formylated peptide receptor 1; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine;
  LTB4, leukotriene B4; MVBs, multivesicular bodies; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate.
