caption: A model for nuclear-cytosolic translocation of APE1 in response to NO stimulation.
  APE1 carries an importin-dependent NLS at the N-terminal end (not shown). Two antiparellel
  beta-strands (B1 and B2) in close proximity to C93 and C310 are masked in the internal
  structure. In rested cells, APE1 resides in the nucleus due to the existence of
  NLS. Upon nitrosative stress, S-nitrosation of C93 and C310 contributes to unmasking
  of the B1 and/or B2 by changing conformation, which may facilitate the nuclear export
  of APE1 in a CRM1-independet manner (perhaps mediated by an unknown transport protein).
  At the same time, importin-dependent nuclear import pathway is repressed by NO insult,
  which may prevent the already exported cytosolic APE1 from re-import into the nucleus.
  However, once the intracellular environment becomes reductive (e.g. the increased
  reducing molecules such as DTT), both NO-elicited S-nitrosation of APE1 and NO-caused
  repression of importin can be abrogated; thus, the inducible nuclear export of APE1
  by NO could be prevented or reversed.
