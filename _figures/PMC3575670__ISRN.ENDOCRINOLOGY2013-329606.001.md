caption: Insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) binds to its receptor and
  activates the receptor tyrosine kinase. The receptor undergoes autophosphorylation
  and provides a binding site for the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. Once
  bound, these IRS proteins undergo phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated
  tyrosine residues provide a docking site for the p85 regulatory subunit of the Class
  I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In turn, the p110 catalytic subunit is released,
  becomes activated and catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5)-triphosphate
  (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol (3, 4)-biphosphate (PIP2). PIP3 then activates
  protein kinase B (Akt). Akt then serves as a branch point for a variety of downstream
  signaling pathways. Insulin and IGF-1 can also stimulate cell growth through the
  mitogen activated protein kinase pathway/extracellular signal related kinase (MEK/ERK)
  pathway.
