caption: O-GlcNAc cycling scheme. Upon entry in cells, glucose is rapidly phosphorylated
  to glucose-6-phosphate (Glucose-6P) by hexokinase (HK). Glucose-6P is isomerized
  by phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), producing fructose-6-phosphate (Fructose-6P),
  a substrate for both phosphofructokinase (PFK) of the glycolytic pathway or glucosamine-fructose
  amino transferase (GFAT), the rate-limiting reaction of the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP). GFAT requires glutamine (Gln) as the amine donor for generating glucosamine-6-phosphate
  (GlcN-6P), which is then N-acetylated by glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase
  (GNA1), producing N-acetyl-glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6P). This step requires
  acetyl-CoA as the acetyl donor. GlcNAc-6P is transformed in GlcNAc-1P by phosphoacetylglucosamine
  mutase (PGM3). Using UTP as the nucleotide donor, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase
  (UAP1) produces uridine-diphosphate N-acetyl glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). This molecule
  is the substrate of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) for protein O-GlcNAcylation by adding
  O-linked GlcNAc moieties at serine or threonine residues of target proteins. O-GlcNAcase
  (OGA) removes GlcNAc residues, counteracting OGT activity.
