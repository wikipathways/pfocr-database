caption: Inferred Sesquiterpene Biosynthesis Related Genes and Their Expression Profiles
  in the Stem of A. sinensis at Three Different States. The sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis
  related genes in grape, cacao, and A. sinensis, including genes in the mevalonic
  acid (MVA) pathway, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) or methylerythritol phosphate
  (MEP) pathway, and sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. The notation ‘1-1-1’ indicates
  that one gene was identified in grape, cacao, and A. sinensis, respectively. Gene
  expression level in the three different states (intact, wounded 5 days, and wounded
  5 + 1 days) of A. sinensis stems was characterized by the TPM value. The dark red
  color indicates high expression levels in different states
