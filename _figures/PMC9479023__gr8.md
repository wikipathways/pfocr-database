caption: The hypothetical mechanisms illustrating that activation of the Nrf2/HO-1
  signalling pathway with tBHQ attenuates podocyte injury in diabetic nephropathy
  by inhibiting NADPH oxidase-derived ROS generation. HG exposure inhibits the Nrf2/HO-1
  antioxidant signalling pathway and enhances NADPH oxidase activity, which eventually
  leads to ROS overproduction and cell apoptosis. However, tBHQ upregulates the Nrf2/HO-1
  antioxidant signalling pathway, which subsequently inhibits NADPH oxidase-derived
  ROS generation, thereby alleviating hyperglycaemia-induced podocyte apoptosis.
