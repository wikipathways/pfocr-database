caption: Regulatory role of DEAD/H box helicases in the toll like receptor (TLR) signaling
  pathway. Figure illustrates the specific involvement of various DEAD/H box proteins,
  such as DDX1, DDX3, DDX21, DDX24, and others, in mediating the signal transduction
  process initiated by the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs),
  such as DNA and RNA, by endosomal TLRs (TLR7, TLR8, TLR9) and surface TLRs (TLR1,
  TLR3, TLR4, TLR6). Upon activation by these PAMPs, TLRs recruit helicases either
  directly or indirectly through adaptor proteins such as MyD88, TRIF, TRAF3, and
  TRAF6, leading to the downstream activation of transcription factors such as IRF3
  and NFκB. This results in the translocation of these transcription factors into
  the nucleus, culminating in the expression of type I interferon (IFN α/β) genes
  and proinflammatory cytokines, which are critical for the innate immune response.
  The dotted lines in this figure indicate indirect interactions or pathways that
  have not been fully characterized
