caption: Schematic presentation of MNS-alleviated inflammatory responses. LPS/TNF-α
  promoted the activation of the NF-κB pathway, increased the transcription of NLRP3,
  Pro–IL-1β, and Pro–IL-18. NLRP3 responded to stimuli (ATP, MSU, and silica), induced
  K+ efflux, and ASC and pro–caspase-1 were recruited to assemble and form NLRP3 oligomerization
  with the active caspase-1. Pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 are cleaved into mature forms
  by caspase-1 following NLRP3 inflammasome activation. IL-1β and other cytokines
  were released to induce the aggregation of mononuclear/macrophages and Th cell differentiation.
  When administered with MNS, NLRP3 inflammasome activation was prevented and cytokine
  maturation release was reduced, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response.
