caption: ERK and non-ERK mediated non-genomic AR signaling. ERK mediated non-genomic
  AR pathways are highlighted in solid line arrows. (I) AR interacts directly with
  the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and activates Akt
  pathway. (II) AR interacts with Src resulting in Src activation of the adaptor protein,
  Shc, a known upstream regulator of the MAPK pathway. (III) AR interacts with Ras-Raf
  leading to sequential activation of Ras, Raf1 and MEK kinase converging on the phosphrylation
  of ERK. (IV) AR also utilizes PKC as a mediator of MAPK/ERK pathway activation.
  PKC kinase activity can be regulated by intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration may be modulated through plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptors
  (GPCRs), the sex hormone binding globulin receptor (SHBGR) and by a membrane-bound
  AR via up-regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Activated
  MAPK/ERK translocates to the nucleus, directly interacts with and phosphorylates
  transcription factors (TFs), such as Elk1, which coordinately regulates the expression
  of several genes involved in cell proliferation. Non-ERK mediated non-genomic ARpathways
  are highlighted in dash line arrows and include (V) PI3K/Akt/mTOR or (VI) forkhead
  box protein O1 (FOXO1) pathway activation. Akt activation may result in FOXO1 phosphorylation
  resulting in its retention in the cytoplasm and subsequent degradation. In addition,
  AR interacts with FOXO1 and impairs FOXO1 DNA binding ability and its ability to
  mediate pro-apoptotic pathways. (VII) Non-ERK signaling can also occur through activation
  of kinases such as protein kinase A (PKA), whose activation is regulated by intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration.
