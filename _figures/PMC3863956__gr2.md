caption: Using PainNetworks to reproduce the NGF-TrkA signalling pathway. (A) The
  original pathway diagram, adapted from http://pathwaymaps.com/maps/652/. (B) The
  pathway as reproduced by PainNetworks, created by querying the resource with the
  pathway members, restricting the results to only include experimentally validated
  direct physical interactions, and only showing interactions occurring between the
  query genes.
