caption: The EML4-ALK fusion is formed via an abnormal rearrangement on chromosome
  2 which juxtaposes part of the N-terminus of EML4 to a portion of the C-terminus
  of ALK. The N-terminus of EML4 contains a coiled-coiled domain, which mediates EML4-ALK
  dimerization. Dimerization has been shown to be critical for EML4-ALK activity (Soda
  M, Choi YL, Enomoto M, et al. Identification of the transforming EML4-ALK fusion
  gene in non-small-cell lung cancer. Nature 2007:561–6). The ALK portion of the fusion
  contains the entire ALK tyrosine kinase domain. EML4-ALK is the most common ALK
  fusion described in lung cancer to date, however, other ALK fusions partners have
  also been described. EML4-ALK fusion proteins are clients of the heat shock protein-90
  (HSP-90) chaperone, and they signal downstream through the mitogen activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway, and
  the JAK-STAT pathway to mediate pleiotropic pro-growth and pro-survival effects.
