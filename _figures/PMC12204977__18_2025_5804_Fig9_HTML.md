caption: Schematic illustration of the underlying mechanism by which Piezo1 attenuates
  BBB dysfunction during I/R injury. Following I/R, the activation of the ion channel
  Piezo1 occurs. This activation induces an influx of Ca2 +, which subsequently activates
  the CaMKII and Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 signaling pathways. This process exacerbates endothelial
  oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, ultimately leading to BBB dysfunction
