caption: 'Mechanisms regulating the changes in signaling pathway activities during
  progression of degeneration. Upper panel: Changes in activity of the indicated signaling
  molecules or processes as a function of time during the progression of degeneration.
  Green shading represents a reduced cytoplasm, red shading represents an oxidized
  cytoplasm. The time at which the appearance of the oxidative stress response, which
  activates AMPK and JNK, is indicated. Lower panel: Causal relationships among observed
  changes in signaling pathway activities. Bars indicate repression, arrows indicate
  activation.'
