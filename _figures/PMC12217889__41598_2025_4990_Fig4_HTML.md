caption: Crosstalk Between the C1 Subpopulation and EndoCs, ECs, and Macrophages.
  (A) Circos plots displayed the intensity and number of interactions between all
  fibroblast subpopulations and other cell types. (B) The expression levels of ligand-receptor
  pairs when all cell types acted as signal senders (top) and as signal receivers
  (bottom). (C) Circos plots highlighted the interaction intensity and count when
  C1 Postn + Fibroblasts acted as signal senders and interacted with other cell types.
  (D) Chord diagrams illustrated the interactions of all cell types within the CXCL
  signaling pathway. (E) The heatmap quantified the influence of each cell type in
  the CXCL signaling pathway as signal senders, receivers, or intermediaries. (F)
  The circos plot represented the interactions among all cell types within the Cxcl12-Ackr3
  signaling pathway. (G) The differential expression of ligand Cxcl12 and receptor
  Ackr3 across all cell types. (H) Circos plots displayed the interaction intensity
  and count when ECs acted as signal receivers from other cell types. (I) Chord diagrams
  illustrated the interactions among all cell types in the PTN signaling pathway.
  (J) The heatmap evaluated the influence scores of all cell types acting as different
  roles within the PTN signaling pathway. (K) Expression differences of PTN-related
  receptor proteins across cell types in the PTN signaling pathway were analyzed.
  (L) All cell types interact autocrine and paracrine in the Ptn-Ncl signaling pathway.
  (M) Circos plots displayed the interaction intensity and count when macrophages
  acted as signal receivers from other cell types. (N) Chord diagrams represented
  the interactions of all cell types within the MDK signaling pathway. (O) The heatmaps
  scored the influence of all cell types in different roles within the MDK signaling
  pathway. (P) The circos plot showed the interactions among all cell types in the
  Mdk-Ncl signaling pathway. (Q) Autocrine and paracrine roles in Mdk-Lrp1 signaling
  in all cell types
