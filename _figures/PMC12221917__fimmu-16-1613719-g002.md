caption: Signaling pathway induced by TNFR2. Signaling induced by TNFR2 results predominantly
  in the activation of the non-canonical NF-kB pathway. Upon binding of the ligand,
  NIK is released from TRAF3-TRAF2-cIAP1/2-dependent ubiquitination and degradation.
  Accumulation of NIK and subsequent activation of IKKα induces phosphorylation and
  ubiquitination of p100, which results in generation of p52. Finally, p52-RelB heterodimer
  translocates to the nucleus and targets transcription of genes associated with cell
  survival and anti-inflammatory response. Created in BioRender. Demczuk, A. (2025)
