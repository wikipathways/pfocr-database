caption: Peroxisomes, fatty acid beta-oxidation and the human deficiencies of peroxisomal
  beta-oxidation. (A) Schematic diagram depicting the substrates known to be oxidized
  in peroxisomes exclusively and the transporters and enzymes involved in their degradation
  (see text for detailed information). (B) Schematic diagram depicting the substrates
  known to be oxidized in peroxisomes exclusively and the transporters and enzymes
  involved in their degradation and the human deficiencies in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation
  pathway so far identified (see text for more information).
