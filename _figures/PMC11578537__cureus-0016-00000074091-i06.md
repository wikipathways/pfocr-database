caption: Heme synthesis begins in the mitochondria with the formation of delta (δ)-aminolevulinic
  acid (ALA) from glycine and succinyl-CoA via ALA synthase (ALAS), the rate-limiting
  step in the liver. δ-ALA subsequently undergoes six additional enzymatic reactions
  to yield protoporphyrin, which is then coupled to iron to form heme. Uroporphyrinogen
  decarboxylase (UROD) is the fifth enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway, catalyzing
  the four-step decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen III and I to coproporphyrinogen
  III and I. Hepatic UROD is inhibited in all patients with PCT (only ~20% harbor
  an inherited UROD pathogenic mutation). In PCT, alcohol consumption exacerbates
  the disease further by increasing iron absorption and free radical production, stimulating
  hepatic δ-ALA, inhibiting uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase, in addition to being
  independently hepatotoxic [11]CoA, coenzyme A; PCT, porphyria cutanea tarda
