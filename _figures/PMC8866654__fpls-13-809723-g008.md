caption: Differentially expressed genes involved in plant hormone signal transduction
  pathway. (A) The DEGs involved in the “Plant hormone signal transduction” pathway.
  (B) The DEGs involved in the “MAPK signaling pathway-plant” pathway. (C) The DEGs
  involved in the “Circadian rhythm-plant” pathway. The red boxes indicated the DEGs
  were involved in different hormone signal transduction pathways.
