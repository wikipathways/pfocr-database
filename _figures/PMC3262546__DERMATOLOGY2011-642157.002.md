caption: 'Overview of senescence pathways. Stimuli and cellular mechanisms responsible
  for the various stages of senescence. Each phase of senescence prevents cells from
  undergoing further cell division. M0 can occur through multiple mechanisms, and
  the relative contribution of each is a function of the factors driving mitogenic
  stimulation (e.g., BRAF versus HRAS mutation). M0 appears to be driven predominantly
  by the p16/Rb pathway in melanoma. a: Unfolded protein response (unique to HRAS
  mutant-positive cells).'
