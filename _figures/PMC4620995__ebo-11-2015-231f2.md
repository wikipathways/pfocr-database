caption: The resulting GRN of the MCs’ pathway in P. falciparum. The straight lines
  represent activation relationship (positive correlation), while the dotted lines
  represent inhibitory relationship (negative correlation). The intensity of the lines
  represents the amount of regulation. The red nodes are the hubs – master activators/repressors
  – while the yellow nodes are their predicted target genes.
