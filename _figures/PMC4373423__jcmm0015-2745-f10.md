caption: Suggested model for RF effects and interactions in various mouse tissues.
  (A) In the liver, RF is believed to lead to an increase in both NAD+ and AMP levels
  that could explain the observed AMPK activity up-regulation and increased Sirt1
  mRNA leading to presumed increased activity levels. AMPK phosphorylates PGC-1α and
  the observed increase in its mRNA levels alongside those of Sirt1, assuming a parallel
  increase at the protein level, may lead to the arrest of glycolysis and fat storage
  and increase in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. SIRT1 also inhibits NF-κB
  activity, as observed, which leads to down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (IL-6 and TNF-α). Combined with the observed up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory
  cytokine Il-10 mRNA, assuming similar effect at the protein level, this yields reduced
  inflammation. (B) In the jejunum, RF increases Pparα mRNA levels, which leads to
  fatty acid oxidation, assuming a parallel increase at the protein level. PPAR-α
  is also known to inhibit NF-κB. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α)
  are down-regulated and together with an increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine
  IL-10 ultimately lead to reduced inflammation. This suggests a novel pathway by
  which RF can influence the inflammatory processes in the gut. (C) In WAT, inflammatory
  processes are inhibited in fat tissue as well. In addition, RF decreases Pparγ mRNA
  and assuming a parallel decrease at the protein level, this could result in reduced
  fat storage.
