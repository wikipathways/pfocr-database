caption: 'Balance of blood lipid metabolism and corresponding interventions. Exogenous
  and endogenous lipids maintain blood lipid levels. Excessive fat intake needs to
  accelerate the metabolism and limit the synthetic lipids in vivo to restore the
  balance of blood lipids. The process involves the coordination of multiple organs:
  ① excessive fatty acids (FA) in adipose tissue need to be metabolized through the
  liver and bile, ② reducing insulin-mediated glucide (Glu) converses to excessive
  TG, and ③ reducing the synthesis of TG and T-CHO in liver. Excessive T-CHO will
  come to the heart from blood circulation and cause serious cardiovascular diseases.
  There are two ways to regulate the abnormal lipid metabolism. One is a therapeutic
  diet that blocks dyslipidemia from exogenous sources. The other way is to exert
  biological effects on the corresponding pathway and regulate lipid metabolism in
  vivo by exercise, drugs, functional supplements, and so on.'
