caption: Schematic of the Ca2+signaling pathways in astrocytes underlying cerebral
  blood flow (CBF) regulation. Virtually all transmitter molecules can activate Gq
  protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) located on astrocytic plasma membrane. Synaptically
  released glutamate and GABA diffuse to astrocytes through synaptic spillover (essentially
  due to the lack of presynaptic reuptake systems), whereas the others diffuse to
  astrocytes after corelease (neuropeptides) or autocrine (ATP) as well as paracrine
  (ACh, monoamines) neurotransmission. GPCR-mediated Gqsignaling involves cleavage
  of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3; liberated into the cytosol) and diacylglycerol (DAG;
  remaining bound to the membrane) by PLC. Soluble InsP3 activates InsP3 type-2 receptor
  (InsP3R2)/Ca2+ channels on the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum, resulting in increase
  of cytosolic Ca2+. The latter can also occur independently of InsP3 activation.
  Perhaps the main route for extracellular Ca2+ entry into astrocytes (see text for
  other possible options) involves the rise in extracellular K+ during neuronal activity.
  Most of the neuronally released K+ during action and synaptic potentials is taken
  up by astrocytes, and this causes membrane depolarization and opening of L-type
  Ca2+ channels (LCC). Release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores may arise via ryanodine
  receptors (RyR)/Ca2+ channels, as well. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ stimulate PLA2,
  which produces arachidonic acid (AA). The same outcome is brought about by Ca2+-independent
  PLA2 activated by the DAG-mediated PKC pathway. Finally, the signaling cascade leads
  to the production of vasoactive prostaglandin E2 (PgE2), epoxyeicosatrienoic acids
  (EETs), and/or 20-HETE by cyclooxygenase (COX) and cytochrome P-450 (CYP). NKA,
  Na+/K+-activated adenosine triphosphatase.
