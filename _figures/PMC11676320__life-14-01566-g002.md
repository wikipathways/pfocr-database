caption: Taurine biosynthesis from several amino acids. Amino acids and vitamins are
  supplied from the diet. Homocysteine, an intermediate in conversion of methionine
  to cysteine, can be recycled and transformed into methionine by the enzyme methionine
  synthase in reactions with a series of folate cycles and vitamin B12. Taurine synthesis
  proceeds from cysteine (from methionine and homocysteine) to cysteine sulfinic acid,
  hypotaurine, and finally taurine with the involvement of cysteine dioxygenase, cysteine
  sulfinic acid decarboxylase, and hypotaurine dehydrogenase. The folate cycle (the
  folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism), which is important for development and
  survival, produces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), as well
  as nucleotide precursors. Folate is mainly found in vegetables and nuts. Oranges,
  lemons, melons and strawberries are also rich in folate. The synthetic form of folate
  is folic acid. Folic acid supplementation is highly recommended during pregnancy.
  Cysteine has antioxidant properties and participates in redox reactions. Methionine
  might also act as an important endogenous antioxidant. Solid lines show a direct
  pathway. Dotted lines indicate an indirect pathway with several potential reaction
  steps
