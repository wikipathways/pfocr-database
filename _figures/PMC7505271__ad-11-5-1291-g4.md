caption: 'Relationships between mitochondrial and norepinephrine dysfunctions. (1)
  NE deficiency leads to loss of its protective effects on postsynaptic neurons. Normally,
  β-AR activation leads to cAMP and pCREB production, reducing mitochondrial aggregation,
  fission, and membrane permeabilisation. These prevent mitochondrial morphology changes
  and mitochondrial-mediated caspases-activated apoptosis. (2) NE deficiency at presynaptic
  terminals lowers the level of glutathione and PPAR-γ activation, increasing O2•-
  via a receptor-independent pathway and predisposes to mtDNA damage. (3) DOPEGAL
  accumulates due to undermined ADH and ALDH2, generating both oxidative stress and
  mPTP opening. The mPTP opening facilitates release of pro-apoptotic cyt c and subsequent
  apoptosis. (4) Enhanced activity of MAO-A causes overproduction of H2O2 and along
  with oxidative stress from DOPEGAL stimulates mtDNA damage and ETC damage. (5) NE
  deficiency in cerebellum also causes mtDNA damage through the activation of NOX,
  CAMKII/PKCα signalling cascade, and ROS production. (6) Apoptosis of NE neurones
  at the locus coeruleus is associated with oxidative stress and mitochondrial-mediated
  caspases-dependent apoptosis due to Ca2+ influx upon neuronal activation, leading
  to reduced NE production. Arrows indicate stimulation, whereas a line with an end
  bar indicates inhibition. Dotted line represents a series of biochemical reactions.
