caption: Proposed regulatory mechanism of estrogen in colitis-associated colorectal
  cancer at week 2 (A) and at weeks 10 and 16 (B). (A) Estrogen induces inflammasome
  activation through Gα13 protein subunits. Gα12 and Gα13 have potentiated estrogen-bound
  estrogen receptor α activity. However, despite the functional overlap between Gα12
  and Gα13, only Gα13 regulates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)
  via protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ). Nrf2 mediates inflammasome activation through the
  transcription of as-yet unknown genes. Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome
  activation induces pyroptosis to eliminate precancerous cells. After eliminating
  precancerous cells, Nrf2 inhibits nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and reactive oxygen
  species through the anti-oxidant enzymes. Ultimately, estrogen prevents carcinogenesis
  (left panel). In contrast, in the absence of estrogen, inflammation provides a cancer
  microenvironment through activation of the NF-κB pathway (right panel). (B) After
  unsuccessful elimination of precancerous cells, inflammation progresses to cancer
  at weeks 10 and 16. Gα12 and Gα13 regulate NF-κB and Nrf2 via PKCδ-mediated signaling
  pathway, respectively. Nrf2 promotes tumor progression by activation of anti-oxidant
  enzymes and NLRP3 inflammasome. Ultimately, NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling pathway accelerate
  carcinogenesis. COX-2, cyclooxygenase 2; DAMP, damage-associated molecular pattern;
  GPCR, G protein coupled receptor; IL, interleukin; iNOS inducible nitric oxide synthase;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.
