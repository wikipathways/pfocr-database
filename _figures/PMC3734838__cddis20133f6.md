caption: A schematic illustration delineating the role of the AKT/Foxo3a/Bim pathway
  in selenite-induced apoptosis of CRC cells. Selenite treatment inhibited Src/PI3K/PDK1/AKT
  pathway and accumulation of FoxO3a in the nucleus possibly through induced ROS in
  CRC cells. On one hand, upregulated FoxO3a enhanced the transcription and expression
  of bim, which led to apoptosis. Additionally, PTEN was also upregulated by FoxO3a,
  indicating further regulation of AKT/FoxO3a/Bim signaling and apoptosis in response
  to selenite
