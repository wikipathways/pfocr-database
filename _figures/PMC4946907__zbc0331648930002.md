caption: Evolutionary diversification of polyamine biosynthesis in eukaryotes. The
  ancestral polyamine biosynthetic pathway in eukaryotes synthesized Spd. Spm biosynthesis
  evolved independently at least three times, and Tspm biosynthesis was acquired from
  the cyanobacterial ancestor of the chloroplast. Hspd biosynthesis evolved independently
  multiple times in flowering plants by gene duplication of deoxyhypusine synthase.
  Dap and Nspd are products of Spm/Spd and Tspm catabolism, respectively.

    biosynthesis evolved independently at least three times, and Tspm biosynthesis
