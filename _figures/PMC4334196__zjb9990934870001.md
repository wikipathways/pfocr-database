caption: Schematic of the one-carbon metabolic pathway. Reaction networks of the standard
  (A) and rewired (B) one-carbon metabolic pathways are shown. The standard pathway
  includes dihydrofolate reductase (FolA), serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GlyA),
  5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolasse (FolD), 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MetF), thymidylate synthase (ThyA), cobalamin-independent homocysteine
  transmethylase (MetE), cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MetH), and the glycine
  cleavage system (GCS). In the rewired pathway, FolD was replaced with formyl tetrahydrofolate
  synthetase (Fhs).
