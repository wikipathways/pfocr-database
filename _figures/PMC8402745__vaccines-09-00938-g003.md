caption: 'Possible outcomes of coronavirus replication in alveolar epithelial cells:
  inflammasome, TLR, lectin. Inflammasome: coronavirus receptor binding, entry, and
  replication results in an increased presence of viral envelope (E) protein in the
  cell. E protein contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM), which interacts with host cellular
  proteins. E protein forms Ca2+ channels in the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi apparatus
  intermediate compartment. Increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels alter the host cell’s
  homeostatic state, inducing activation of cytosolic innate immune signaling receptor
  NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome. Upon NLRP3 activation,
  caspase-1 (casp-1) is activated, which then goes on to cleave and activate proinflammatory
  cytokines such as pro-IL-1β into active IL-1β and IL-18. NLRP3 activation also induces
  pyroptosis, a caspase-1-dependent proinflammatory cell death. E protein’s PBM also
  interacts with syntenin proteins to trigger activation of the p38 MAPK pathway.
  TLR: TLR4, present on alveolar epithelial cells, is activated by damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPS), including HMGB-1, which is found in patients infected
  by coronavirus. MyD88 acts as an adaptor for TLR receptors. TLR4 activation induces
  downstream NF-B activation, which acts as a transcription factor for proinflammatory
  cytokines. TLR4-mediated NF-B activation also induces the stabilization of IL-6
  mRNA, allowing for more IL-6 production. Lectin: SARS-CoV spike (S) protein interaction
  with serum mannose-binding lectin (MBL) induces activation of MBL-associated serine
  protease 2 (MASP-2). The MBL-MASP2 complex activates a signal cascade that produces
  anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, which recruit neutrophils and monocytes, promoting inflammation.'
