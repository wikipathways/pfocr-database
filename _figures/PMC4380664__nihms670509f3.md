caption: Overview of pharmacological targets and signaling cascades proposed to be
  important in mediating synaptic plasticity underlying extinction. The formation
  of extinction memories requires an intricate regulatory network of signal transduction
  and gene transcription and translation, leading to a complex pattern of intracellular
  changes and long-term structural changes. Various pre- and postsynaptic membrane
  receptors including ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, cannabinoid
  receptors, 5-HT, and dopamine receptors have been shown to be important targets.
  Main downstream mechanisms include calcium entry through NMDAR and VGCC in concert
  with AMPA receptors initiating synaptic plasticity via calcium-dependent protein
  kinases (e.g. PKA, PKC, PKM and CamKII, phosphatases (e.g. calcineurin) and activation
  of the ERK/MAPK pathway. Subsequent interaction with transcription factors, such
  as CREB and Zif268 within the nucleus results in a wide range of newly synthesized
  proteins, such as BDNF important for synaptic plasticity including LTP formation.
  BDNF activated TrkB receptors further regulate the ERK/MAPK pathway. Finally, epigenetic
  modifications are important in translating neurotransmitter/neuromodulator signaling
  activity generated at the synapse into activation/repression of the desired genomic
  response in the cell nucleus. As outlined in the text, boosting these synaptic plasticity
  mechanisms by pharmacological means may constitute the establishment of novel drug
  targets to promote fear extinction.
