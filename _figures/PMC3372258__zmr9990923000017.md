caption: 'Putative major pathways of anaerobic energy metabolism in the organelle
  of mitochondrial origin in Blastocystis hominis, a protozoan parasite and a common
  inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal tract. The map is redrawn based on data
  reported previously (). The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is carried out
  by pyruvate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (PNO) (), the same fusion protein found in Euglena
  gracilis. The transformation of acetyl-CoA to acetate leads to the synthesis of
  ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation. The alternative oxidase might help Blastocystis
  cope with oxygen stress conditions in the host intestine and prevent the formation
  of reactive oxygen species. Hydrogen production has not yet been shown for Blastocystis
  (as indicated by a question mark), although [Fe]-Hyd localizes to the organelle
  (). In this sense, the mitochondria of Blastocystis resemble the hydrogen-producing
  mitochondria found in the ciliate Nyctotherus ovalis and represent another example
  demonstrating that mitochondria and hydrogenosomes utilize a common enzyme toolkit.

  respiratory complex I; Q?, quinone (of an uncertain nature); AOX, alternative oxidase;
