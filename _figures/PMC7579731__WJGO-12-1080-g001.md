caption: 'Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway due to BRAF
  V600 mutations and current targeted therapy options for metastatic colorectal cancer
  patients bearing these mutations. A: In healthy cells, a growth factor binds to
  and activates receptor tyrosine kinases on the cell membrane, inducing their dimerization.
  Then, the Grb2/Sos complex is recruited to the membrane to initiate RAS activation.
  Activated RAS triggers dimerization (i.e., BRAF-BRAF or BRAF-CRAF) and activation
  of RAF proteins. RAF proteins activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (MEK-ERK) pathway to promote cell proliferation and survival;
  and B: In colorectal cancer cells bearing a BRAF V600 mutation, mutant BRAF proteins
  can signal as a monomer and potently activate the MEK-ERK pathway in a RAS independent
  manner, which accelerates tumor formation and progression. Drugs targeting BRAF
  (BRAF inhibitor) and MEK (MEK inhibitor) are currently used in the treatment of
  BRAF-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The use of BRAF inhibitors suppresses
  the negative feedback from ERK to the epidermal growth factor receptor, resulting
  in the mitogen-activated protein kinase reactivation and the treatment resistance.
  Triplet inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor, BRAF, and MEK is an emerging
  therapeutic approach for patients with BRAF-mutant mCRC. Crosstalk between the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathway and the PI3K and Wnt pathways can play a role in the survival
  of BRAF-mutant CRC cells and their resistance to BRAF inhibition. The PI3K and Wnt
  inhibitors may be part of the future treatment of BRAF-mutant mCRC.'
