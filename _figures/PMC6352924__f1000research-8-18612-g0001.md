caption: In the binding of TNF to TNFR1, TNFR1 recruits the TNFR1-associated death
  domain (TRADD), which then binds to receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase 1 (RIPK1), TNFR-associated factor 2 or 5 (TRAF2/5), and cellular inhibitor
  of apoptosis protein 1 or 2 (cIAP1/2) to form complex I. cIAP1/2 and the linear
  ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), consisting of HOIP, HOIL, and SHARPIN,
  add Met1-linked and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, respectively, to RIPK1. This
  stabilises RIPK1, amplifying its signal. Lys63-linked chains on RIPK1 recruit the
  transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex, consisting
  of TGFβ-activated kinase 1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-binding protein
  2 and 3 (TAB2 and 3) and TAK1. The TAK1 complex phosphorylates MAPK, Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK), and the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. This results in the translocation
  of transcription factors AP1 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) into the nucleus,
  leading to the transcription of target genes. RIPK1 is deubiquitinated by cylindromatosis
  tumour suppressor protein deubiquitinase (CYLD), facilitating its dissociation from
  complex I to form complex IIb, consisting of RIPK1, RIPK3, FAS-associated death
  domain (FADD), caspase-8, and FLICE-like inhibitory protein long (cFLIP L). cFLIP
  L regulates both the apoptosis and the necrosis pathway, preventing caspase-8 activation
  to avert apoptosis. cFLIP L acts in complex with caspase-8 to cleave RIPK1 and RIPK3
  to inhibit their aggregation and the activation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like
  protein (MLKL), which would result in necrosis. HOIL-1, heme-oxidised iron regulatory
  protein 2 ubiquitin ligase 1; HOIP, HOIL-1 interacting protein.
