caption: 'Tryptophan is metabolized through three major downstream pathways, the serotonin,
  indoleacetate, and kynurenine (KN) pathways. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan
  metabolism is upregulated. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting
  enzyme of the KN pathway is upregulated in renal cancer cells; and increased kynurenine
  in the tumor microenvironment suppresses immune cell activation and facilitates
  immune evasion of renal cancer cells. The metabolites are depicted by squares and
  enzymes or transporters are denoted by ovals in the figures. Green arrows: Increase
  in activity, Red arrows: Decrease in activity. Abbreviations: ALDH2, aldehyde dehydrogenase
  2; DDC, DOPA decarboxylase; MAO, monoamine oxidase; QN, quinolinate.'
