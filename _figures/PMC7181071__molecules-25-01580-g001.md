caption: The main pathway for autophagy modulation. The several groups of autophagy-related
  genes including ULK1 complex, VPS34 complex, and ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L complex involved
  in autophagosome formation. Depletion of growth factor and/or nutrient cause the
  inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) that acts as an
  autophagy suppressor by inhibiting ULK1 genes. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
  positively modulates autophagy machinery via inhibition of mTORC1 and activation
  of either ULK1 complex or VPS34 complex. ER-stress mediated unfolded protein response
  (UPR) stimulates AMPK-driven autophagy and is also involved in the process for autophagosome
  formation (not shown). Activated ULK1 complex resulted in activating VPS34 complex,
  facilitating the autophagy process including nucleation and elongation. Conversion
  of LC3I into phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-LC3II, a key substrate for autophagosome
  membrane assembly, is mediated by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems including
  ATG4B, ATG7, ATG3, and ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L complex. Subsequently, closed autophagosome
  fuses with lysosome to form an autolysosome, which leads to autophagy degradation
  of cytoplasmic components. This process is sustained by preventing the mTORC1-mediated
  phosphorylation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), which induces the expression
  of genes involved in autophagosome and lysosome biogenesis. CLEAR, coordinated lysosomal
  expression and regulation motif; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase
  B; UVRAG, UV radiation resistance-associated gene protein.
