caption: 'Schematic of ozone-induced lung inflammation and role of IL-6 signaling
  pathway: ozone-associated lung inflammation is primarily driven by lipid ozonation
  products (LOP) and generation of free radicals primarily in lung epithelial cells.
  LOP and free radicals can further mediate activation of downstream biochemical events
  and cascades of secondary cellular responses leading to the inflammatory damage.
  The production of free radicals and LOP can trigger (i) increased expression of
  IL-6 and STAT3 and (ii) activation of NF-κB and (iii) activation of PI3K/AKT pathway'
