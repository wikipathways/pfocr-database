caption: Schematic model showing the possible actions of the PnPP-19 peptide on antinociception.
  PnPP-19 acts peripherally and centrally, via the opioid and cannabinoid systems,
  involving the µ- and δ-opioid receptors and cannabinoid 1 -receptor. It was proposed
  that the concomitant activation of the pathway of opioids and cannabinoids may also
  be facilitated by heterodimerization between receptors of these two ways. The activation
  of opioid and cannabinoid receptors causes the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity.
  PnPP-19 appears to act directly on the µ-, but not on the δ-receptors, transfected
  into Xenopus oocytes. Activation of CB1 receptors is likely to be caused by increased
  levels of anandamide, as inhibition of anandamide degradation has been shown to
  potentiate the effect of the peptide. The peptide inhibited the enzyme neprilisin
  (NEP or enkephalinase - EC 3.4.24.11) in vitro, which degrades enkephalin, and was
  hydrolyzed by this enzyme after 24h of incubation. The peptide also stimulated eNOs
  increasing NO, which via PKG leads to opening of KATP, resulting in hyperpolarization.
  PnPP-19 inhibited the calcium current in dorsal ganglion root cells, which was reversed
  by noloxane, an opiate blocker, suggesting that this effect must be via the opioid
  receptor, which leads to calcium channel blockade and opening of potassium channels.
  The antinociceptive action of the peptide via the CNS using blockers also have shown
  its action on the opioid and cannabinoid system. This whole signaling cascade, on
  the action of PnPP-19, leads to a decrease of neuronal excitability and blocking
  the release of neurotransmitters, reducing pain. For more details see text. NEP,
  neprilysin enzyme (neutral endopeptidase); nNOS, neuronal nitric oxide synthase;
  eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; GCs, soluble guanylate cyclase; PKG, phosphoprotein
  kinase G; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase; AEA, N-arachidonoylethanolamine
  or anandamide. Created with BioRender.com.
