caption: A,Data based on site and core laboratory test readings. B, Average pathway
  probabilities as observed in PROMISE vs as model simulated, in which patients underwent
  pathways according to their risk score, ie, if patient is at lower risk, then there
  is a higher probability that the given patient will be tested with exercise treadmill
  test (ETT). An invasive coronary angiography (ICA) finding of severely abnormal
  indicated coronary artery disease (CAD) with at least 70% stenosis; mildly abnormal,
  nonobstructive CAD with 1% to 70% stenosis; normal, no stenosis. CTA, single photon
  emission computed tomography (SPECT), stress echocardiography findings (STECHO),
  and ETT are defined in eTable 2 in the . CABG indicates coronary artery bypass grafting;
  LM, left main disease; OMT, optimal medical treatment; PCI, percutaneous coronary
  intervention; PROMISE, Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest
  Pain; and VD, vessel disease.
