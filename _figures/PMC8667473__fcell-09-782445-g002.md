caption: The Wnt/β-catenin Signalling Pathway. (A) In the absence of a Wnt ligand,
  transcription co-activator β-catenin is phosphorylated by the destruction complex,
  composed of Gsk3β, Axin, CK1α and APC. Following phosphorylation, β-catenin is ubiquitinated
  by βTrCP and sent to the 26S proteasome for degradation. Thus, Wnt target genes,
  which are repressed by TCF/LEF factors and Groucho, cannot be expressed. Activation
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway can be inhibited by WIF and sFRPs and Dkk1.
  LiCl and BIO are chemical inhibitors of Gsk3β, which can be used experimentally
  to stimulate Wnt/β-catenin signalling. (B) In the presence of a Wnt ligand, the
  Wnt binds to Frizzled and Lrp5/6 co-receptors. This sequesters Dvl, Axin and the
  destruction complex to the plasma membrane. As a result, the destruction complex
  is inactivated, and β-catenin is no longer degraded and can translocate to the nucleus,
  bind to TCF/Lef factors and activate Wnt target gene expression. Lrp5/6, lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein-5/6; WIF, Wnt-inhibitory factor; sFRP, secreted Frizzled-related
  protein; Dkk1, Dickkopf1; Dvl, Dishevelled; Gsk3β, Glycogen synthase kinase 3β;
