caption: The M1 macrophage phenotype is pro-inflammatory and M2 phenotype is immunosuppressive.
  Although bile acids are not able to induce complete macrophage polarization to either
  the M1 or M2 phenotype, they have been shown to activate TGR5 and produce a ‘mixed
  phenotype’ that exhibits dominant immunosuppressive behavior as evidenced by an
  increased IL-10:IL-12 ratio. In response to bile acids, TGR5 can activate both the
  adenyl cyclase–cAMP and EGFR–SRC pathways. In the pro-inflammatory (dotted arrows)
  M1-like pathways, TGR5-dependent transactivation of EGFR can induce pro-inflammatory
  signalling via activation of SRC, which in turn activates ERK1/2 and PKC. This transactivation
  has been shown to occur when EGFR and a relevant GPCR such as TGR5 co-exist side
  by side in a lipid raft (signified by cholesterol and sphingolipid). Upon TGR5 activation,
  metalloproteinase-dependent cleavage of the EGFR ligand HB-EGF occurs. TGR5–dependent
  activation of PKC results in the activation of NF-κB, which causes increased expression
  of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα, along with further autocrine
  activation of ERK1/2 and continued cycles of pro-inflammatory signaling. SRC-dependent
  activation of ERK1/2 in the M1-like phenotype results in increased expression of
  c-MYC which increases cell apoptosis. Pro-inflammatory M1-like signalling also regulates
  innate immunity by increasing activation of pro-inflammatory responsive Th17 cells
  (increased IL-1β, IL-6) and Th1 cells (increased IL-12, IFNγ) with concurrent suppression
  of immunosuppressive Treg cells (decreased IL-10) via the pro-inflammatory cytokines
  it produces. The pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype is not dominant during bile
  acid-dependent activation of TGR5; concomitantly, SRC activation also activates
  STAT3, which promotes anti-inflammatory effects (solid arrows) including decreased
  activation of Th17 and Th1-cells, decreased production of TNFα, IFNβ, IL-6, IL-12,
  and increased production of IL-10 and TGFβ, which corresponds with an increase in
  the IL-10:IL-12 ratio,. Bile acid–activated TGR5 also activates the cAMP pathway
  independently from EGFR transactivation; cAMP activates PKA which leads to the upregulation
  of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) expression and activity. cFos, an
  important target gene of CREB, binds to the p65 subunit of activated NF-κB to inhibit
  its translocation to the nucleus, representing an anti-inflammatory effect of TGR5.
  Another important target gene of CREB is IL-10 which exerts immunosuppressive and
  therefore anti-inflammatory effects,,. Bold solid arrows represent M2-like immunosuppressive
