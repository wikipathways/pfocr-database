caption: 'Regulation of NF-κB by ubiquitination and the deubiquitinases: A20, CYLD,
  and Cezanne. In the initiation of NF-κB signaling, ligand binding to a variety of
  immune sensors such as TNFR, IL-1R, TCR, and TLR results in the recruitment of TRAFs
  to the receptors. TRAF2 is recruited with a protein complex, which consists of multiple
  adaptor proteins, including TRADD, RIP1, and ubiquitin ligases: cIAP1 and cIAP2.
  cIAP promotes Lys63-linked polyubiquitination on both RIP1 and TRAF2 but also on
  themselves to generate a binding platform, allowing the subsequent attachment of
  further distal components. Polyubiquitinated RIP1 is recognized by the binding partners
  TAB1 and TAB2/TAB3. The Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains also can bind the IKK
  regulatory subunit, NEMO. Due to the new proximity between the TAK1 and IKK, TAK1
  phosphorylates IKKβ at 2 serine residues, resulting in the activation of IKK and
  rapid phosphorylation of IκBα. Subsequent ubiquitination of IκBα can now be carried
  out by E3 ligase, SCF-βTrCP. Although polyubiquitinated IκBα remains attached to
  NF-κB dimers, it is selectively degraded by the 26S proteasome, allowing the nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB, where it induces the activation of NF-κB through the transcription
  of NF-κB responsive genes. Conversely, once TRAF6 is activated, it functions as
  an E3 ubiquitin ligase and, together with the ubiquitin E2 complex, UBC13 and UEV1A,
  catalyzes the synthesis of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains onto itself as well
  as NEMO. Similar enzymatic events mentioned above follow, resulting in the ultimate
  degradation of IκBα by the 26S proteasome, allowing the nuclear translocation and
  activation of NF-κB–dependent genes (). Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains also are
  found to be bound to MALT1, which is a part of the CBM (CARMA1/BCL-10/MALT1) complex
  downstream of TCR, aiding in the activation of NF-κB signaling (). Deubiquitinating
  enzymes (A20, Cezanne, and CYLD) negatively regulate the NF-κB pathway by cleaving
  the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains from various target molecules, as denoted
  by black squares (; ; ). In the case of TNFR signaling, RIP1 can be subjected to
  the deubiquitinase function of all these enzymes, interfering with ubiquitin-mediated
  protein-protein interactions, thereby inhibiting downstream NF-κB activation. Furthermore,
  A20 and CYLD were also shown to inhibit NF-κB activation by the Lys63-linked deubiquitination
  and subsequent inactivation of TRAF6. Uniquely, A20 also can remove Lys63-linked
  polyubiquitin chains from MALT1 downstream of T- and B-cell antigen receptors. In
  addition, via its specialized E3 ligase activity, A20 adds Lys48-linked polyubiquitin
  chains to RIP1 and UBC13 for their subsequent degradation, as shown in pink squares
