caption: Development of a PKA sensor compatible with 2-photon Fluorescence Lifetime
  Imaging Microscopy (2pFLIM). (A) Diagram illustrating how PKA activity induces FRET
  in the reporter. Upon phosophrylation by PKA, the substrate region binds FHA domain,
  bringing the donor and acceptor together and resulting in FRET. The phosphorylated
  reporter leads to an increase of acceptor:donor emission ratio, as well as a decrease
  in donor fluorescence lifetime because of an additional energy transfer pathway.
  (B) Schematic of the original PKA reporter AKAR3 (Allen and Zhang, ) and three new
  PKA reporters.
