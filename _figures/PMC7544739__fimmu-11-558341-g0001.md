caption: The production and action of SOCS proteins. Various cytokine receptors can
  induce SOCS proteins expression in a JAK/STAT-dependent manner (Pictured on the
  left side). However, SOCS1, SOCS3 and CIS seem to suppress signaling in various
  ways. SOCS1 directly interacts with JAKs and reduce their catalytic activities while
  SOCS3 interacts with the proximal position and CIS blocks up with the binding sites
  of STATs to receptors. Moreover, it is possible to induce the production of SOCS
  proteins independent of JAK/STAT signaling pathways, such as signaling of TLRs,
  growth factor receptors (GFRs). (a) The SOCS proteins induced in these ways could
  inhibit the response of the cell to other cytokines, which is one of the modes of
  crosstalk inhibition. Finally, the inhibition of SOCS proteins may not be limited
  to the classic JAK/STAT signaling pathway (b,c). The figure is referenced from Figure
  1 of Suppressors of cytokine signaling and immunity (). The red line indicates inhibition;
  green line indicates promotion; P (in the green circle) indicates phosphorylated.
