caption: 'A simplified illustration of Smoothened (SMO)-dependent glioma-associated
  oncogene homolog (GLI) regulation in the context of hedgehog (Hh) pathway mutations.
  (A) Under physiological conditions in adult tissues, Patched1 (PTCH1) functions
  by inhibiting SMO, which represses GLI function and prevents its translocation into
  the nucleus to activate target genes transcriptionally. (B) However, in cancer cells,
  loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of PTCH1 alleles results in the formation of a nonfunctional
  truncated PTCH1 protein. Consequently, this results in the constitutive activation
  of SMO, which promotes GLI activation and its translocation into the nucleus to
  activate Hh target genes transcriptionally. (C) Alternatively, constitutively active
  SMO M1/M2 mutants resistant to PTCH1 inhibition or inhibition by SMO inhibitors
  promote the sustained activation of GLI and its subsequent translocation into the
  nucleus to transcriptionally activate Hh target genes. Bar-headed arrow: inhibition;
  dotted bar-headed arrow: loss of inhibition; triangle-headed arrow: activation;
  dotted triangle-headed arrow: inactivation.'
