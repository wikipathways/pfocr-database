  the transcriptional factor Rim101p on the endosomal membrane. After Rim101p is proteolytically
  processed by the protease Rim13p on the surface of the endosome, its cleaved form
  is delivered to the nucleus. In the nucleus, cleaved Rim101p activates transcription
  of the RSB1 gene by suppressing its repressor, Nrg1p. A protein product of the RSB1
  gene is a putative sphingoid long-chain base-specific translocase/transporter within
  the PM. This protein stimulates the Lem3p-dependent transport of PE from the outer
  (extracellular) leaflet of the PM to its inner (intracellular) leaflet and suppresses
  the Yor1p-dependent transport of PE across the PM bilayer in the opposite direction.
