caption: Common pathway (A) and higher-order independent pathway (B) models of the
  components of metabolic syndrome. Rectangles represent observed (measured) variables,
  ellipses represent latent phenotypes, and circles represent latent genetic and environmental
  variance components. For simplicity, shared/common environmental influences are
  not presented. Genetic and environmental influences for the higher-order factors
  are designated by the subscript “L”, whereas genetic and environmental influences
  for the physiological domains have numerical subscripts. Genetic and environmental
  influences that are specific to the observed variables are designated with the subscript
  “s”. BMI = body mass index. HDL = high density lipoprotein.
