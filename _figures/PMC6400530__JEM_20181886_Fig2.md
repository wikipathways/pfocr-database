caption: 'Pathogen antioxidant networks: The examples of Mtb and T. cruzi. (A) Mtb.
  NADPH oxidase-derived (O2•−) and iNOS-derived (•NO) radicals can react with specific
  enzymes (Fe- or Cu-containing SODs to form H2O2; trHbN to form nitrate) or recombine
  to form peroxynitrite. H2O2, peroxynitritous acid (ONOOH), and organic hydroperoxides
  (ROOH) are reduced particularly by KatG and peroxiredoxins (Prx). Most Mtb Prx (AhpC,
  TPx, PrxQB) can use Trx as reducing substrate. AhpC can also be reduced by AhpD,
  an adaptor protein that links antioxidant with metabolic enzymes and NADH. NADPH—derived
  from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), malic
  enzyme (ME), and H+-transhydrogenases (TH)—is the final electron donor for TrxR
  and MshR. TrxR reduces Trx B and C (collectively indicated herein as Trx’s). The
  one-Cys Prx AhpE is reduced by Mrx-1 either directly (data not shown) or through
  the formation of a mixed disulfide with MSH, which is reduced by Mrx-1 in a monothiolic
  mechanism that leads to mycothiolated Mrx-1 (Mrx-1-SM) and is resolved by MSH/MshR/NADPH.
  MsrA and B reduce S– and R–Met-SO, respectively, and accept electrons from the Trx/TrxR/NADPH
  system. (B) T. cruzi. Enzymatic and nonenzymatic redox-active molecules use reducing
  equivalents from NADPH—derived from the PPP, IDH, ME, and TH—are funneled through
  the T(SH)2, GSH, ascorbate (ASC), and/or TXN-I/II redox systems. H2O2 is metabolized
  by APxCcP at the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and plasma membrane using
  ASC/Cyt cII as the electron donors. Dehidroascorbate (DHA) is reduced by a direct
  reaction with T(SH)2. Organic hydroperoxides (ROOH) are substrates for GPX-II that
  uses GSH. T(SH)2 reduces oxidized GSH (GSSG), while TR reduces TS2. Mitochondrial
  O2•− formation by the electron transport chain (mainly at complex III) is detoxified
  by Fe-SODA with H2O2 generation. •NO can reach the mitochondria and inhibit respiration
  at complex IV (CIV; with an enhanced O2•− generation). Fe-SODA outcompetes for O2•−
  inhibiting ONOO− formation. Mitochondrial peroxiredoxin (MPX) decomposes H2O2 and/or
  ONOO−, probably using reduced TXN-II and T(SH)2 as the reducing substrate (dashed
  arrows). Met-SO is repaired by the action of MsrB at the expense of TXN. In the
  cytosol, cytosolic peroxiredoxin (CPX) detoxifies ROOH. T(SH)2 is synthesized from
  two molecules of GSH and one spermidine in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme trypanothione
  synthetase (TS). Met-SO is repaired by the presence of MsrA and B in the different
  compartments.'
