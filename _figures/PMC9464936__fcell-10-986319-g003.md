caption: Malformation of PcG bodies in cancer. (A) Schematic of recruitment model
  for PRC1 and PRC2 complexes. i) vPRC1 is recruited by transcription factors or CpGi
  readers and catalyses H2AK119ub1. ii) PRC2.2 reads H2AK119ub1 and PRC2.1 is recruited
  to CpGi, these complexes catalyse H3K27me3. iii) cPRC1 reads H3K27me3 and promotes
  Polycomb mediated looping to other cPRC1 marked regions. (B–E) Illustration of how
  different mutations of PcG proteins in diverse cancer types affects the PcG recruitment
  pathway and in turn cPRC1 mediated looping. This includes (B) PRC2 disruption, (C)
  PRC2-TIP60 complex fusion, (D) vPRC1 disruption, (E) and cPRC1 accumulation. The
  genes mutated and the cancer they are associated with are listed on the right.
