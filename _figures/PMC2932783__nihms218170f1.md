caption: Targeting of signaling pathways by arsenic trioxide in chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia cells. Activation of the JNK MAPK pathway is required for induction of
  apoptosis of CLL cells. Arsenic trioxide treatment of leukemic cells also results
  in inhibition of the PI 3’K/AKT pathway; and pharmacological targeting of this pathway
  enhance the antileukemic effects of arsenic trioxide. The potential involvement
  of other MAPK pathways, such as the p38 MAPK and MEK/ERK pathways which play important
  roles in control of growth and survival of other types of leukemic cells, in the
  regulation ATO-dependent responses in CLL cells remains to be defined.
