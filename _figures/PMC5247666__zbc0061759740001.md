caption: Proposed metabolic pathways connecting galactose with GDP-glucose. The ability
  of SVEN_2781 to produce GDP-glucose was established in this study. The conversion
  of galactose 1-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate probably occurs via the epimerization
  of an NDP-galactose in a Leloir-type pathway (). Glc6P, glucose 6-phosphate; Glc1P,
  glucose 1-phosphate; Gal, galactose; Gal1P, galactose 1-phosphate; GDPGlc, GDP-glucose;
  T6P, trehalose 6-phosphate; M1P, maltose 1-phosphate.
