caption: 'The figure shows a scheme illustrating the ASARM-model and the pharmacological
  effects of SPR4-peptide (bimodal) in HYP and wild type mice. The numbers highlighted
  in the circles refer to the explanations in the following text. Interactions between
  DMP1, PHEX, α5β3 integrin and ASARM-peptides occur on the osteocyte cell-surface.
  The interactions are, extracellular, dynamic and competitive. Arrows linking other
  factors represented in the cartoon illustrate positive and negative effector relationships:
  (1) Phosphorylated DMP1- ASARM motif is required for binding to PHEX and the RGD
  motif of DMP1 binds to α5β3 integrin to form a [(PHEX)-(DMP1)-(α5β3 integrin)] trimeric
  complex. This interaction occurs on the cell surface of the osteocyte where PHEX
  and α5β3-integrin have an intramembranous, domain a short intracellular domain and
  a large extracellular domain; (2) Formation of the [(PHEX)-(DMP1)-(α5β3 integrin)]
  trimeric complex initiates a signaling pathway (MAPK/Erk) that suppresses FGF23
  expression; (3) Suppressed FGF23 results in increased serum phosphate by de-repressing
  renal Na-dependent phosphate transport and increasing bone mineralization; (4) SPR4-peptide
  binds to DMP1-ASARM motif and chronic administration (infusion) competitively prevents
  the binding of DMP1 to PHEX; (5) This results in increased expression of FGF23;
  (6) The increased FGF23 results in hypophosphatemia and has a negative effect on
  mineralization; (7, 8 & 9) The binding of PHEX to the DMP1-ASARM-motif is also competitively
  regulated by free ASARM-peptide. Specifically, free ASARM-peptide can directly bind
  to PHEX preventing the binding to DMP1 and thereby disrupting the [PHEX-DMP1-α5β3
  integrin] trimeric complex and increasing FGF23 expression; (6 & 9) This inhibits
  mineralization and induces hypophosphatemia by increasing FGF23; (10 & 6) Free ASARM-peptides
  can also directly inhibit renal phosphate uptake and mineralization (, , , , , –,
  , , –). In X-linked and autosomal recessive rickets there are high levels of circulating
  ASARM-peptides (, , ). In vitro and in vivo (bolus and infusion) administration
  of ASARM-peptides and transgenic mice over expressing ASARM-peptides cause mineralization
  defects and hypophosphatemia (–, –, , –, –); (11) The pleiotropic effects of SPR4-
  peptide occurs because SPR4-peptide also binds and neutralizes ASARM-peptides; (1,
  11, 12 & 13) Thus, under conditions of ASARM depletion and/or acute bolus administration
  of SPR4, the formation of the trimeric complex is favored because of reduced ASARM-peptides
  (neutralized by SPR4); (2 & 3) This in turn results in reduced FGF23 expression
  hyperphosphatemia and increased mineralization. This model also explains the different
  effects of SPR4-peptide administration in wild-type and HYP mice since HYP-mice
  have defective PHEX and increased circulating ASARM-peptides.'
