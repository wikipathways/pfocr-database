caption: . Regulatory mechanism of WRKY transcription factors. The signaling pathway
  starts with an environmental stimulus through ABA signaling or by trans-regulation,
  which comprise direct transcription factor activation. The trans regulation can
  occur with a WRKY member, in case of presence of a W-box, or with other TFs from
  different families. An auto-regulation mechanism can occur, or regulation by promoter
  binding of a different WRKY member. In some cases, the phosphorylation by an MAPK
  cascade is a determinant process for the correct WRKY protein function. When activated,
  WRKY TFs can regulate a different WRKY by binding its W-box sequence, or regulate
  some other responsive gene conferring tolerance, resistance, or sensibility toward
  the environmental stimuli.
