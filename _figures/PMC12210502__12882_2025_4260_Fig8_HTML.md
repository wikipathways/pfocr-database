caption: 'Patterns of TSC1/2 role in kidney disease (by Figdraw). The deletion of
  TSC1/2 in the kidney results in a range of renal disease responses. TSC1/2 deletion
  results in the activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which subsequently induces
  insulin resistance, increases the secretion of growth-promoting factors, and enhances
  the activity of TFE3 and TFEB. Concurrently, increased MITF expression promotes
  cell growth, invasion, and migration, consequently accelerating the progression
  of DKD, PKD, RCC, and RAML. In the context of AKI and CKD, the early stages of IRI
  are characterized by TSC1 deletion-induced macrophage polarization toward the M1
  phenotype, which in turn leads to increased renal dysfunction. Conversely, in the
  repair stage of IRI, TSC1 deletion reduced macrophage polarization toward M2, thereby
  attenuating renal fibrosis. Additionally, the mTORC1-JNK signaling pathway, mitochondrial
  homeostasis, and glycolysis play a role in the occurrence and development of AKI
  and CKD. DKD: Diabetic kidney disease; PKD: Polycystic kidney disease; RCC: Renal
  cell carcinoma; RAML: Renal angiomyolipomas; AKI: Acute kidney injury; CKD: Chronic
  kidney disease; MITF: Microphthalmia transcription factor; TSC1/TSC2-|-: TSC1/TSC2
  deletion; Fnip1/PKD1-|-; Fnip1/PKD1 deletion; Foxi1/TSC1 dKO: Foxi1/TSC1 double
  knockout; CAII/TSC1 dKO: CAII/TSC1 double knockout'
