caption: Possible mechanism and regulation of ROS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  in the formation of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. The secretion of mature forms
  of IL-1β and IL-18 is the result of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These mediators
  have the properties of pro-inflammatory activation, which in turn promote the adhesion,
  aggregation and growth of crystals. The interaction of crystals or nanoparticles
  with cells can cause mitochondrial damage and increased NADPH oxidase activity,
  and then generate ROS, which mediates NLRP3 inflammasome transcription and activation
  through the ROS-dependent of NF-κB and autophagy signaling pathway. ER induces ROS
  production via NOX4 and ERO1 during stress. The release of Ca2+in the ER causes
  mitochondrial damage which further aggravates the release of ROS. High concentration
  of ROS can induce excessive activation of autophagy, thereby stimulate the inflammasomes
  to release a great number of inflammatory factors. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  may further increase the level of autophagy, resulting in an inflammatory chain
  reaction.
