caption: Schematic diagram depicting the regulation of osteoblastic-specific genes
  expression by lithium through activation of three major signaling pathways, including
  the canonical Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt and BMP-2 signaling pathways. In Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway, lithium inhibits the expression of sclerostin (SOST) as well as increases
  phosphorylation of GSK3β and accumulation of β-catenin. Through PI3K/Akt pathway,
  the activation of Akt by lithium leads to the inhibition of GSK3β and downregulation
  of NFATc1. Lithium also enhances osteogenic differentiation by increasing BMP-2
  expression. The effects of lithium are indicated by red arrows. For early stage
  of osteogenic differentiation, lithium inhibited the expression of osteogenic markers
  by increasing phosphorylation of suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegics
  (SMADs) in BMP-2 signal transduction pathway (the effects of lithium are indicated
  by blue arrows). Arrow pointing upward (↑) indicates an increase and pointing downward
  (↓) indicates a decrease. Equivalent arrow (↔) indicates no effect.
