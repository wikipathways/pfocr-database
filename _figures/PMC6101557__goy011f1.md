caption: Inflammatory caspases (caspase-1 and caspase-4/5/11) are activated through
  canonical or non-canonical inflammasomes, triggered by microorganism infection.
  In the non-canonical pathway, procaspase-4/5/11 directly binds to lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS), resulting in their activation. In the canonical pathway, inflammasome-initiating
  sensors (NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2 or pyrin) recognize pathogens and danger signals,
  and form multimerization of inflammasomes binding with caspase-1. Upon activation,
  inflammatory caspases cleave gasdermin-D to produce gasdermin-D N-terminal (NT)
  fragments. Gasdermin-D NT as a pore-forming protein contributes to pyroptosis pore-forming
  in the infected cell. This then releases cytokines and debris of pyroptotic macrophages,
  which had previously trapped intracellular bacteria to further promote uptake into
  neutrophils by efferocytosis (secondary phagocytes).
