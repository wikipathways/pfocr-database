caption: 'Effectors of microglia function associated with neurodegeneration and how
  microglia damage or kills neurons. Microglia have both host-defensive and detrimental
  actions, depending on the scenario. When they encounter aberrant or misfolded proteins—such
  as Aβ, aggregated α-synuclein, oxidised or mSOD1, or PrPSc—they function as sentinels,
  protective hosts. In response to these toxic stimuli, microglia attempt to clear
  aggregated Aβ, α-synuclein or mSOD1 via SRs and other PRRs. However, the nature
  of the aberrant proteins or their continued production disrupts microglial housekeeping
  functions. Several pathways activate: NADPH oxidase produces superoxide and derivative
  oxidants; iNOS produces nitric oxide derivatives, glutamate, cathepsin B and other
  proteases, and that produces stressed neurons. These processes dysregulate the microglial
  host-defensive mechanism, leading to an exaggerated proinflammatory response, neurotoxicity
  and neurodegeneration. Microglia also include tumour necrosis factor (TNF) as an
  indirect pathway to damage or kill neurons via reducing brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) production. Neurodegenerative
  diseases such as AD, ALS and HD, furthermore, cause mutations in specific genes
  that lead to self-autonomous dysregulation of host defence. This initiates or exaggerates
  proinflammatory responses, resulting in neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. In
  this way, when mutations in TDP-43, progranulin and Trem2 increase (↑), they affect
  phagocytosis and associated degradation pathways. Similarly, mutations in mSOD and
  HTT (↑) also affect inflammasome activation and neuronal killing pathways. On the
  other hand, mutations in C9orf72 can affect both phagocytosis and inflammasome pathways.
  In normal physiology, a microglia-autonomous mechanism controls the scenario by
  clearing (↓) mutant or aberrant proteins (adapted from ref. []).'
