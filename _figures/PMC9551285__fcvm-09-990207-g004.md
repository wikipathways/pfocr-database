caption: Summary of the effects of PEA versus BPA on the oxygen pathway of patients
  with CTEPH. Impairments exit in both lung ventilation, lung gas exchange, oxygen
  delivery, and oxygen extraction. BPA could improve lung ventilation, while PEA causes
  damage to it. VA/CO gets more improvement in patients receiving PEA than those receiving
  BPA. PEA impairs lung diffusion capacity, while BPA does not affect it. The cardiac
  output of patients receiving PEA gets more improvement than those receiving BPA,
  and PEA could reduce the oxygen content. There is no significant change in oxygen
  extraction after PEA or BPA. VA/CO, alveolar ventilation-to-cardiac output ratio.
