caption: Proposed pathways utilized by DGKα in cancer cells and T lymphocytes. In
  cancer cells, DGKα acts as an antiapoptosis/proproliferation factor via the PKCζ–NF-κB,
  GGTase I–RhoA(–NF-κB), Raf–MEK–ERK and PDE-4A1–mTOR pathways. As PKCζ, Raf, PDE-4A1,
  and mTOR are PA-binding proteins and PA activates them, it is likely that PA generated
  by DGKα mediates the antiapoptosis and proproliferation effects of the enzyme. In
  T cells, DGKα acts as an immune checkpoint and promotes the nonresponsive state
  known as clonal anergy through the inactivation of Ras-guanyl nucleotide-releasing
  protein (RasGRP), which is activated by DG and activates the Ras–MAPK pathway. In
  addition, DGKα attenuates the PKCθ–NF-κB pathway, which is also important for preventing
  T cell anergy.
