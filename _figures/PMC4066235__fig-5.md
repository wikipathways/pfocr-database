caption: G2/M cell cycle checkpoint activation in response to radiation-induced DNA
  damage. Similar to the G1/S checkpoint, IR induces DNA DSBs that are recognized
  by the MRN complex (not pictured), which activates ATM and ATR. ATM phosphorylates
  CHK2, which targets CDC25A for degradation. CDC25A is necessary for the removal
  of an inhibitory phosphate on CDK1. WEE1 kinase is responsible for this phosphorylation
  of CDK1. Degradation of CDC25A inhibits progression through the cell cycle. In addition,
  ATM activates p53, preventing its association with MDM2. p53 accumulation promotes
  p21 expression. p21 inhibits cyclin B1/CDK1, inducing cell cycle arrest. As with
  G1/S, miRNA regulation is observed in almost every member of the G2/M checkpoint.
  Bold miRNAs are multifaceted within the pathway. Underlined miRNAs play a role in
  almost every aspect of the DDR from signal transduction to apoptosis.
