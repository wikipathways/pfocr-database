caption: 'Simplified model of oxidative stress as the central pathogenetic pathway
  in OSA-associated CV diseases as suggested by animal studies. OSA-associated intermittent
  hypoxia activates NOX and other ROS-producing enzymes in the carotid body, the heart,
  and the vessels (PMN: polymorphonuclear neutrophils, EC: endothelial cells, VSMC:
  vascular smooth muscle cells). The resulting radical flux exerts direct cytotoxic
  effects, decreases NO bioavailability, enhances lipid peroxidation, increases sympathetic
  activity, and activates the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. Finally,
  these changes lead to the well-known clinical manifestations of OSA in the CV system.'
