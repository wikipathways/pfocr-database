caption: Role of RNF11 in the NF-κB signaling pathway. The activation of the NF-κB
  signaling leads to the degradation of the inhibitory IκB proteins (IκB, inhibitor
  of NF-κB), that mask the nuclear localization signals required for the nuclear import
  of NF-kB. The downstream recruitment of most of the signaling proteins is mediated
  by poly-ubiquitination of several components of the signal transduction machinery.
  E3-ligases, such as TRAF2/3/5/6 ubiquitinate the receptor interacting protein 1
  (RIP1) by K11 and K63-linked ubiquitin chains. These chains serve as a scaffold
  for the recruitment of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) that
  mediates NEMO M1-linear ubiquitination. In turn, it allows for the recruitment of
  TGF-β Activated Kinase 1 Binding Protein 2/3 (TAB2/3) and TAK1 that activate the
  IKK complex (IKK1/IKK2/NEMO). This complex triggers the ubiquitin-dependent degradation
  of IκB and the release of the NF-κB transcription factor. The deubiquitinating enzymes
  counteract the activity of the E3-ligases and play an essential function in restricting
  NF-kB signaling by targeting critical pathway components. In particular, the A20
  ubiquitin-editing complex, comprising A20, TAX1BP1, ABIN-1, ITCH, and RNF11, catalyzes
  the removal of K63-linked ubiquitin chains from proteins of the signal transduction
  machinery, and the subsequent addition of K48-linked ubiquitin chains, promoting
  degradation by proteasome and termination of NF-κB signaling.
