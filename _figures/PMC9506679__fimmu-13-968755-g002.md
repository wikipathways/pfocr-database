caption: Model shows the regulatory mechanism of TRIM21. Multiple mechanisms are involved
  in the regulation of TRIM21 expression. TRIM21 expression is augmented by stimulation
  with IFNs induced by IRFs. There is a feedback mechanism to inhibit IFN production
  by promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of IRFs.
  PRMT5-induced arginine methylation inhibits TRIM21 function, while HDAC6 deacetylates
  TRIM21 to promote its homodimerization and stabilizes its ubiquitination function.
  ISGylated by HERC5 also leads to enhanced TRIM21 E3 ligase activity. JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway induces the expression of TRIM21, while PI3K/AKT pathway activity is negatively
  correlated with TRIM21 expression. Propofol downregulates TRIM21 expression without
  detailed mechanism.
