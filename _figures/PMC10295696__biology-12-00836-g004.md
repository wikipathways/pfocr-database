caption: Starch, cellulose, hemicellulose, and glycogen degradation pathways of Achatina
  fulica were reconstructed from our bioinformatic analysis to perform metabolic pathway
  prediction on the basis of the giant snail genome. The pathways include enzyme names
  in abbreviation, metabolite intermediates with some structural representation, and
  arrows determining the reaction direction. Polysaccharide degradation, glycolysis,
  gluconeogenesis, and pentose phosphate pathways were represented by brown, green,
  pale pink, and bright pink arrows. Asterisks (*) indicate the enzymes with high
  copy numbers
