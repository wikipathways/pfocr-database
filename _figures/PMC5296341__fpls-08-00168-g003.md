caption: The stromal chaperone system. Two different models have been hypothesized
  concerning the main import motor of the chaperones. One model (A) involves a secondary
  function of Hsp93, assuming that this protein acts mainly in the quality control
  pathway by degrading mistargeted or wrongly folded proteins. In this model the main
  energy is consumed by Hsp70 and not by Hsp93 (). A recent study suggest that Hsp93
  interacts subsequently with incoming preprotein at the N-terminal cTP, whereas Hsp70
  binds to the mature parts of the protein (). This enable the two chaperone systems
  to interact at least partially in parallel with the preproteins. After completing
  of the import by processing the cTP, proteins are folded with the help of various
  chaperones like Cpn60 and Hsp70 (B).
