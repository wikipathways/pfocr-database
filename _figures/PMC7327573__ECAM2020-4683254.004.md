caption: Enrichment analysis of candidate targets for QBF against psoriasis. The enrichment
  analysis is generated by ClueGO and the most vital term in the group is labeled.
  Functionally related groups partially overlap. Representative enriched biological
  process or pathway (P < 0.05) interactions among core QBF targets. The larger circle
  indicated the greater degree of enrichment, and the closer color suggested the more
  similar function in biological network. (a) Core QBF targets enriched in the representative
  biological process. (b) Core QBF targets enriched in the representative signaling
  pathway.
