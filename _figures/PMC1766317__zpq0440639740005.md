caption: 'Model: A similar CARMA-Bcl10-MALT1 signaling pathway mediates NF-κB activation
  in response to antigen receptor stimulation in lymphocytes and AT1R stimulation
  in liver cells. (Left) In lymphocytes, antigen-dependent NF-κB activation leads
  to cytokine production and cellular proliferation. (Right) In liver, Ang II-dependent
  NF-κB activation leads to a variety of proinflammatory effects that are implicated
  in the development of hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis.'
