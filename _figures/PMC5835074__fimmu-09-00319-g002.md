caption: Competition between the host and Leishmania or Streptococcus pyogenes for
  arginine. (A) After Leishmania invasion, the infected macrophage produces nitric
  oxide (NO) from arginine via NO synthase (NOS) to kill Leishmania while Leishmania
  uses macrophage arginase I (a) to limit the amount of arginine available for synthesis
  of NO via NOS by macrophages. Mechanistically, the increase in Th2 cytokines during
  Leishmania infection, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5, induces the expression
  of arginase I in macrophages to produce polyamines. Leishmania directly activates
  signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6) to increase the expression
  of arginase I in macrophages. Leishmania also uses the arginine transporter (amino
  acid permease 3, AAP3) (b) to compete with macrophages for arginine. During macrophage
  invasion by Leishmania, there is a coordinated arginine deprivation response mediated
  via the mitogen-activated protein kinase 2 (MPK2) cell signaling pathway, which
  upregulates arginine transport away from the macrophage. Leishmania uses polyamines
  to produce trypanothione that neutralizes effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  released from macrophages. (B) Streptococcus pyogenes uses the arginine deiminase
  (ADI) pathway to limit available arginine for NO production by macrophages. This
  pathway includes the ArcD antiporter, which concomitantly transports ornithine out
  and arginine into the cell, enzymes which convert arginine to ornithine, CO2, NH3,
  and one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The NH3 can be utilized to buffer
  against acid stress.
