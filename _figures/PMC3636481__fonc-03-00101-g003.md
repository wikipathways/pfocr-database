caption: Cellular responses to a DSB in S. cerevisiae. A DSB is rapidly recognized
  by MRX that recruits Tel1. In G1 phase of the cell cycle, the DSB is repaired mainly
  by NHEJ (not represented). In S/G2 phases of the cell cycle, the DSB is processed
  for repair by HR. The 5′–3′ resection is achieved by the concerted action of nucleases
  and helicases including Sae2, Sgs1, Dna2, and Exo1. The resulting ssDNA is then
  coated by RPA. In yeast, Rad52 then catalyzes the displacement of RPA by Rad51.
  The resulting Rad51 filament can then initiate homology search and strand invasion
  and prime DNA synthesis. Resolution of DNA structure is then required to conclude
  the gene conversion. The DNA checkpoint pathway starts by Tel1 recruitment, which
  modifies nearby nucleosomes (not represented) to form a first platform to recruit
  additional checkpoint components. The RPA-coated ssDNA forms a second platform that
  recruits Ddc2-Mec1, Dpb11, and the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp (Ddc1-Rad17-Mec3), assisted
  by the checkpoint clamp loader (Rad24-Rfc2-5, not represented). Rad9 is then recruited
  and activated. Collectively, this edifice contributes to the efficient activation
  of Rad53 and Chk1 that will phosphorylate downstream targets.
