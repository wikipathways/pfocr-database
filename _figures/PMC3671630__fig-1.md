caption: Nucleotide excision repair. Schematic overview of the nucleotide excision
  repair (NER) pathway. Damaged DNA is recognized by either initial factors of transcription-coupled
  repair (CSA and CSB) or global genome repair (a.o. XPC), which constitute the two
  different repair pathways in NER. After DNA damage recognition, the repair route
  progresses along the same way. After helix unwinding and verification of the damage,
  incisions are made to remove the faulty stretch of DNA. Finally, DNA synthesis and
  subsequent ligation reproduce the correct DNA sequence. To see this illustration
