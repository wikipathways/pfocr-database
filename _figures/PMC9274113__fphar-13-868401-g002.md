caption: 'The role of mitoKATP in myocardial ischemia and the regulation of the signaling
  pathways involved. (A). Mitochondrial injury and mitoKATP play a role in cardiac
  protection during the process of MIRI; MIRI increased Bax expression and decreased
  BCL2 expression, triggering a cascade involving increased NO production and leading
  to the superficial formation of ONOO− with increased production of ROS. Activation
  of mitoKATP stimulates the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of NO on ischemic
  myocardium by inhibiting the overproduction of ROS. Ischemic postadaptation activates
  protein kinase C and the reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway through the intracellular
  concentration of adenosine and NO, and it acts on the mitoKATP channel to protect
  the myocardium; activation of the mitoKATP channel leads to cell hyperpolarization,
  resulting in reduced Ca2+ entry, and a reduced driving force of mitochondrial calcium
  uptake, prevent Ca2+ accumulation in the matrix and MPTP formation. The MPTP is
  the escape pore of ROS, Cyt C, Ca2+ and other signaling molecules. CF indicates
  cardiac fibroblasts; MF, myofibroblasts; MIRI, myocardial ischaemia reperfusion
  injury; and ONOO−, peroxynitrite. (B). The structure of MPTP; F1Fo ATP synthase:
  The Fo subunit consists of a, e, f, g and A6 L, the F1 component consists of α and
  ß subunits, labeled in bottle green and yellow, respectively, and the γ, ε subunits.
  The F1 peripheral stalk is comprised of subunits b, d, F6, and OSCP. The C cyclic
  subunit, ANT and PiC are overlaid by IMM; the dotted line represents the MPTP signal
  molecule outflow position. OSCP indicates oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein;
  IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase; and PiC,
  phosphate carrier. (C). mitoKATP channels prevent transdifferentiation of CF to
  MF to reduce MF maturation. Testosterone (10 μM) increases the opening probability
  of mitoKATP channels, PHC regulates the mitochondrial KATP channel, Akt/GSK-3β,
  and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways, GST depends on protein-kinase C and mitoKATP channel
  pathway activation by some typical pathways such as PI3K/Akt and NO synthases, and
  plays roles in cardioprotection. Uridine attenuates myocardial injury and oxidative
  stress by activating the mitoKATP channel to reduce excessive ROS production and
  prevent calcium overload. PHC indicates penehyclidine hydrochloride; GST, genistein.'
