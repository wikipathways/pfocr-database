caption: One of the possible mechanisms of MFSD to alleviate the damage of high glucose
  to podocytes. In high glucose environment, Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated,
  and β-catenin accumulates in cells and finally participates in nuclear transcription
  of downstream proteins, inhibits transcription and production of p62/SQSTM1, and
  restricts autophagy. MFSD inhibits the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  and prevents the autophagy process from being restricted.
