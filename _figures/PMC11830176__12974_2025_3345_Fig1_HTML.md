caption: 'HBME inhibit LPS activated canonical NF-kB pathway in microglia and its
  effectors. HBME seems to enact inhibitory effect either upstream of the TLR4 signaling
  pathway or directly on different molecules within the cascade. LPS activates the
  TLR4 receptor causing the activation of two proinflammatory transcription factors,
  p38 MAPK and the NF-kB p50/p65 heterodimer, ultimately leading to the increased
  production of key promotors of the microglial immune response. TLR4 relies on the
  subsequent activation of its adapter protein, MyD88 to potentiate downstream protein
  activation. The phosphorylated p38 MAPK translocates directly to the nucleus to
  produce the proinflammatory mediators IL-1b and NO, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine
  IL-10 through downstream mechanisms. Separately, p38 MAPK further potentiates the
  activation of NF-kB. The literature suggests that p38 phosphorylates IkBa just as
  the IKK trimer complex does, thus freeing NF-kB to phosphorylate and translocate
  to the nucleus where it produces key proinflammatory mediators. CD40 will be incorporated
  into the plasma membrane to recognize its ligand and further activate microglia.
  Pro-IL-1b must be cleaved into its active form via the caspase-1 protease found
  within the NLPR3 inflammasome’s multi-protein structure. For NLRP3 to become active
  and integrated into its inflammasome, a secondary PAMP or DAMP such as the HMGB1
  protein must activate it. IL-1b and NO, along with several other proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines, are released from microglia propagating a neuroinflammatory
  response. Due to these mounting effects, microglial activation can lead to an exaggerated
  inflammatory response and subsequent CNS toxicity. HBME: Human breast milk derived
