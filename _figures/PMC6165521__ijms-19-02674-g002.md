  closer to the tip. Auxin and ethylene act synergistically to control root elongation,
  root hair formation, lateral root formation and hypocotyl elongation []. Ethylene
  modulates root elongation through altering auxin transport: Ethylene binds to receptor

  ERF1, the ethylene response factor that regulates diverse genes, most likely tissue-specific.

  transport in inflorescences while PIN2, PIN3, and PIN7 mutants decrease polar auxin
  transport in roots. In roots, auxin moves rootward via PIN1, PIN3, and PIN7 in the

  gravitropism. Ethylene-induced auxin synthesis involves the α and β subunits of

  pathway []; PIN proteins responsible for polar auxin transport and gravitropism

  re-align to the lower side []. Nitric oxide: high apical levels of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) in Arabidopsis root hairs suggest possible activation of a Ca2+ channel
