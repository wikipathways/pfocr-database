caption: The regulatory role of TGF-β signal in DN. TGF-β ligands (TGF-β1/2/3) transduce
  the transmembrane signal through binding to TGFBR2 and TGFBR1, resulting in the
  phosphorylation of downstream Smad2/3. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 form the complexes
  with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target
  genes. Smad2/3 can also be activated by signal crosstalk with ERK/p38 MAPK pathway.
  Smad7, an inhibitory Smad, acts to inhibit Smad2/3 phosphorylation by targeting
  TGFBR1. In addition, Smad7 also induces IκBα, an NK-κB inhibitor, to suppress NF-κB
  signaling. TGF-β also induces many Smad3-dependent miRNAs/lnRNAs to regulate DN,
  among which miR-21, miR-192, miR-377, Erbb4-IR, and lncRNA9884 are upregulated and
  pathogenic. However, miR-29a/b, miR-200a, let-7b, and lnc-TSI are downregulated
  and renoprotective. The TGF-β signal-targeted inhibitors or agonists, whose efficacy
  for DN treatment has been validated in animal studies, are also labeled in the illustration.
  The line with an arrow end means positive regulation, while that with the blunt
  end means negative regulation or inhibition.
