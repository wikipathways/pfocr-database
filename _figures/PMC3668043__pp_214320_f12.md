caption: Potential model of fatty acid synthesis pathways based on protein changes
  during chronic nitrogen depletion. SCS, Succinyl-CoA synthetase; TECR, trans-2-enoyl-CoA
  reductase. The numbers represent fold change of proteins in relative abundance.
  Dashed lines mean that no related proteins were detected in this pathway. [See online
