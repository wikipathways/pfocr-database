  protein kinase signaling pathway and the pathogenicity associated two-component
  signal transduction system might be activated in Foc4. GPCR, G protein coupled receptor;
  Gα, G protein alpha subunit; Gβ & Gγ, G protein beta and gamma subunits; GTP, guanosine
  triphosphate; AC, adenylate cyclase; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; ATP,
  adenosine triphosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinase; MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; FMK1, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; Ste12, transcription factor; SLN, histidine kinase; RR, response
  regulator. These pathways were characterized to associate with pathogenesis in fungal
  pathogens.
