caption: A diagram illustrates the potential mechanisms underlying the action of emodin
  in inhibiting SAP-ALI. During the process of SAP, CIRP is released from pancreatic
  islets into the blood and circulates into the lung, leading to the activation of
  the NF-κB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome formation and pyroptosis of lung resident
  macrophages that release IL-1β. Subsequently, IL-1β induces CXCL1 expression in
  macrophages and others, and the increased CXCL1 recruits neutrophil infiltration
  into the lung, where the infiltrated neutrophils produce ROS, proteases, cytokines,
  and chemokines, damaging the lung tissues. Emodin may inhibit CIRP expression and
  the CIRP-related NF-kB signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome formation, IL-1β, and CXCL1
  expression, mitigating neutrophil infiltration and lung damages, alleviating SAP-ALI.
  Hence, emodin targets the CIRP/NLRP3/IL-1β/CXCL1 pathway, the critical players in
  the pathogenesis of SAP-ALI, and may be a promising candidate for intervention of
  SAP-ALI.
