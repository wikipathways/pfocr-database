caption: Degradation of GPX4/CoQ10 or inhibition of FSP1 induces ferroptosis in cancer
  cells. Class III FINs are molecules that act independently of system    activity,
  the GSH level and direct inhibition of GPX4. These molecules, including FIN56, induce
  degradation of GPX4, which leads to ferroptosis induction. In addition to degrading
  GPX4, FIN56 also induces degradation of coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) by altering the
  mevalonate pathway. The importance of coenzyme Q10 degradation in the execution
  of ferroptosis is assumed because the function of a protein called FSP1 (a class
  V FIN) was recently described (, ). In this scenario, FSP1 converts extramitochondrial
  ubiquinone (the oxidized form of coenzyme Q10) to extramitochondrial ubiquinol (the
  reduced form of coenzyme Q10), and ubiquinol acts as an endogenous RTA that inhibits
  ferroptosis independent of the presence of GPX4. In this context, by inducing coenzyme
  Q10 degradation, FIN56 can inhibit the effects of FSP1 to confer resistance to ferroptosis.
  On the other hand, the inhibitor of FSP1 (iFSP1) controls ferroptosis without degrading
  CoQ10.
