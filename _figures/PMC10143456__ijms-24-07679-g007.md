caption: Proposed model of DKK1-mediated renal fibrosis. During renal injury, DKK1
  can be initially activated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Subsequently,
  DKK1 may autoregulate its own expression to further increase its levels. The DKK1
  autoregulation may be unrelated to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Increased
  expression of DKK1 is involved in renal fibrosis and thus promotes CKD progression.
  Under the circumstances of renal injury, DKK1 is no longer acting as a Wnt/β-catenin
  antagonist (via interaction with LRP5/6). Conversely, DKK1 may activate the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling by some unknown mechanisms in renal cells or in infiltrating immune cells.
