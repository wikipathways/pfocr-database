caption: Negative regulation of cytokine signalling. Cytokine signalling is attenuated
  by tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases), which dephosphorylate Janus kinases (Jaks),
  cytokine receptors and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs);
  several PTPases have been implicated in these functions. In addition, a family of
  protein inhibitors of STATs (PIAS) has also been shown to antagonise the action
  of these transcription factors. Finally, a family of cytokine inducible regulators
  of the Jak-STAT pathway, suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS proteins) has
  also been identified. In principle, activators, inducers, or mimics of the negative
  regulators of cytokine might also be useful as novel immunosuppressants.
