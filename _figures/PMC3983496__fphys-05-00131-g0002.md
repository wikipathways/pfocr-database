caption: Schematic representation of the proposed intracellular signaling pathways
  regulated by Cx43 hemichannels in bone cells. (A) Bisphosphonates bind to phosphatases
  present in the cell membrane. This induces Cx43 hemichannel opening, followed by
  activation of the kinases Src and MEK, and ERKs. ERKs activated downstream of Cx43
  hemichannel opening are retained in the cytoplasm by a complex formed by βarrestin
  and clathrins. This leads to the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic targets p90RSK,
  BAD and C/EBPβ, which results in osteoblast and osteocyte survival. (B) Mechanical
  stimulation induces α5β1 integrin engagement and the association of the integrins
  with Cx43, by a mechanism that requires the protein 14-3-3θ. This results in hemichannel
  opening and the release of PGE2. PGE2, in turn, activates EP2/4 prostaglandin receptor
  by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism, leading to activation of the cAMP/PI3K signaling
  pathways, accumulation of βcatenin with the consequent activation of Wnt signaling,
  and inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis. (C) Parathyroid hormone (PTH), through binding
  to the PTH receptor, induces activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Cx43,
  by sequestering β-arrestin away from the PTH receptor, facilitate cAMP/PKA-mediated
  downstream signaling and osteoblast survival.
