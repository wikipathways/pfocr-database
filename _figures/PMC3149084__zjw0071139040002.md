caption: Single-run analysis of the yeast proteome by LC MS/MS. Schematic representation
  of proteins involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, in the citric acid cycle (TCA
  cycle) and in the glyoxylate pathway in yeast. The scheme is based on ref () and
  extra proteins were added based on the KEGG pathway database. Proteins that were
  identified in the single-run analysis and were not targeted in ref () are in yellow
  and proteins that were found by both strategies are in blue. Gal10 was not targeted
  and not found in the single-run analysis (white).
