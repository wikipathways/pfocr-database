caption: 'Synthetic routes for C1-feedstock assimilation. (A) Synthetic routes of
  the formyl-CoA elongation (FORCE) pathways. (B) Two strain co-culture system using
  the FORCE pathways. (C) A synthetic CO2 fixation pathway, the POAP cycle. Enzymes:
  HACL, 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase; PYC, pyruvate carboxylase; OAH, oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase;
  ACS, acetate-CoA ligase, and PFOR, pyruvate synthase. Cofactors: FDred, reduced
  ferredoxins.'
