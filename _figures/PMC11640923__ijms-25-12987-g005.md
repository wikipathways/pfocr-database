caption: Pathomechanisms of FTD that might involve iron imbalance. Iron metabolism
  dysfunctions may lead to mitochondrial low iron levels with the possible dysregulation
  of heme and iron sulfur cluster (ISC) synthesis. A paucity of ISCs and heme may
  lead to dysfunctions of the electron transport chain and altered mitochondrial membrane
  potential (Δψ). Together with oxidative phosphorylation impairment, high mitochondrial
  iron may lead to oxidative stress with the production of excess reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) that may result in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage or defects in
  mitochondrial morphology, fission and fusion dynamics, trafficking and quality control
  through the mitophagy pathway. Mitochondrial ferritin (FTMT) may buffer excess iron
  and protect against oxidative damage. Excess cellular iron entry or excess release
  from ferritin through ferritinophagy, together with mitochondrial dysfunctions,
  may trigger ROS production in neurons, leading to lipid peroxidation and the activation
  of ferroptotic cellular death. The release of damaged nuclear and mitochondrial
  DNA due to oxidative stress may trigger, together with neuroinflammation, the activation
  of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) that may exacerbate ferroptosis through
  the activation of ferritinophagy and further release of harmful iron. The activation
  of the sequestosome 1/protein 62/kelch-like ECH associated protein 1/NFE2-like bZIP
  transcription factor 2 (SQSTM1/p62/KEAP1/NRF2) signaling pathway, also involved
  in the regulation of iron-related genes, may inhibit ferroptosis. Iron dyshomeostasis
  can trigger microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT/TAU) aggregation directly through
  the generation of ROS or through the modulation of MAPT/TAU phosphorylation. Oxidative
  stress and ROS production derived from iron dyshomeostasis could also affect the
  aggregation of further proteins observed in FTD-associated inclusions, like TAR
  DNA binding protein (TARDBP/TDP43), fused in Sarcoma (FUS), EWS RNA binding protein
  1 (EWSR1), TATA-box binding protein associated factor 15 (TAF15), ubiquilin 2 (UBQLN2)
  and the dipeptide repeats (DPRs) derived from the translation of the hexanucleotide
  repeat region of the C9orf72 gene
