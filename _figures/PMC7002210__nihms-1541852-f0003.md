caption: The solid tumor microenvironment comprising hypoxia, inflammation, and immune
  cells impact DSB repair pathways in cancer cells. The diagrams were drawn using
  motifolio drawing toolkits (www.motifolio.com). A. In DCs, the presence of dsDNA
  activates the cGAS-STING pathway and leads to activation of IRF-3 and NF-kB enhancing
  the pro-inflammatory immune response. B. DSB-mediated expression of cellular cytokines,
  chemokines, and crosstalk between stromal cells in the solid tumor microenvironment
  serves important function in immune cell homing and migration.
