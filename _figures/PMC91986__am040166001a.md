caption: General and modified pathways for the synthesis of mcl-PHA precursors. (A)
  Possible links between mcl-PHA synthesis and fatty acid degradation (left) and the
  general pathway for PHB synthesis in R. eutropha (right) are outlined. All enzymatic
  activities are numbered as indicated on the right. Genes encoding these enzymes
  that have not been identified are indicated with an asterisk. Dashed lines indicate
  pathways or reactions that are theoretically possible but might not take place due
  to limited concentrations of the β-oxidation intermediates. (B) Modified pathway
  for mcl-PHA synthesis in the E. coli fadB mutant. The fadB mutation blocks β-oxidation
  at the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase step (cross), which channels substrates to
  mcl-PHA. The introduced phaC gene enables mcl-PHA synthesis, if sufficient substrate
  is available. The thick dashed arrow indicates the PHB acetoacetyl-CoA reductase
  activity encoded by phbB, cloned into the host. Reduction of ketoacyl-CoA intermediates
  is theoretically possible but might not take place due to limited 3-ketoacyl-CoA
  concentrations or limited enzyme activity for the mcl acyl-CoA β-oxidation intermediates.
  (C) Construct analogous to that seen in panel B with the host E. coli fadA mutant.
  This modified pathway was designed to increase the supply of mcl-PHA precursors
  by introduction of phbB in addition to blocking β-oxidation at the 3-ketoacyl-CoA
  thiolase. The cross indicates a block of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. The thick solid
  arrow indicates the postulated channeling of ketoacyl-CoA from β-oxidation to PHA.
