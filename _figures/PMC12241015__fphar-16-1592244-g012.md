caption: The proposed mechanisms by which baicalein mitigates the effects of DSS-induced
  damage in C. elegans. Upon DSS treatment, nematodes experience increased ROS and
  MDA levels, leading to oxidative stress and compromised intestinal permeability.
  Baicalein intervention appears to counteract these effects by enhancing several
  physiological parameters, including lifespan, body length, body width, head swings,
  and body bends, while decreasing lipofuscin accumulation, a marker of aging. In
  terms of oxidative damage, baicalein treatment enhances SOD activity, leading to
  reduced ROS levels, which subsequently lowers MDA formation, an indicator of lipid
  peroxidation. Additionally, baicalein improves intestinal permeability by modulating
  the expression of gene associated with barrier function. Mechanistically, the insulin/IGF-1
  signaling pathway (IIS) and the MAPK pathway are involved in the regulation of baicalin
  oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity. This multi-pathway approach underscores
  baicalein’s potential as a therapeutic compound in enhancing health span and reducing
  oxidative stress under DSS-induced conditions
