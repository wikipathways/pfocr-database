caption: Host autophagy pathways and Plasmodium-derived microvesicles. (A) Plasmodium
  sporozoite infects a hepatocyte by invagination of the host cell membrane, thus
  forming a transient vacuole (TV) or parasitophorous vacuole (PV). If parasites are
  unable to discard their unnecessary organelles, or correctly remodel their vacuole,
  the PI3K complex is formed at the vacuole membrane, and leads to parasite elimination
  by cytosolic lysosomes. Although LC3 is observed transiently at the vacuole membrane,
  it is not essential for efficient Plasmodium degradation. This elimination, called
  PI3P-associated sporozoite elimination (PASE), occurs during the early intrahepatic
  stage. During the late intrahepatic stage, when the parasite starts its differentiation
  and multiplication, the PVM enclosing the parasite can be labelled by LC3 promoted
  by Atg5, resulting in the host Plasmodium-associated autophagy-related (PAAR) response.
  This pathway, associated with ubiquitin, sqstm1/p62, and Nbr1, is independent of
  PI3k, Rb1cc1, and Ulk complexes, and does not necessarily lead to clearance of the
  parasite, as it can avoid fusion with lysosomes by remodeling its vacuolar membrane.
  (B) After leaving the liver, merozoites invade RBCs. The parasite is able to produce
  Plasmodium-derived microvesicles by autophagy, using PbAATG, in order to transport
  genetic information and promote gametocytogenesis. However, pMVs can also induce
  a pro-inflammatory response. (C) PbA-MVs are transferred from iRBCs to astrocytes
  inside a PVM directly targeted by LC3-II to form a LAPosome. This then fuses with
  lysosomes, resulting in parasite clearance. This LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP)
  pathway, an unconventional autophagy pathway, induces a pro-inflammatory response
  in astrocytes, leading to ECM.
