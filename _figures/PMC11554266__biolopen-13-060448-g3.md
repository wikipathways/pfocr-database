caption: This illustration details the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1/HIF1α pathway, focusing on
  its regulatory role in glucose uptake through GLUT1 and GLUT4 transporters. Activation
  of the EGFR receptor triggers PI3K signaling, leading to the phosphorylation of
  AKT via PDK1. AKT activation promotes downstream signaling such as mTORC1 and the
  stabilization of HIF1α, which regulates the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT4 transporters.
  These transporters facilitate glucose uptake to meet the energy demands of cancer
  cells, further enhancing glycolytic metabolism. Dysregulation of this pathway is
  associated with CRC, where aberrant mTORC1 signaling and HIF1α stabilization contribute
  to tumor growth and metastasis through enhanced glucose uptake and metabolic reprogramming.
