caption: Innate and adaptive immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Schematic shows
  a lung alveolus and a blood vessel. The left side of the figure describes effects
  of the innate immune system specifically in men, while the right side depicts their
  delayed adaptive immune functions. Dotted arrows represent a decrease in function
  or activity, while triple headed solid arrows signify an increase compared to infection
  in women. The most implicated cell types and their associated cytokines have been
  shown. In men, the novel coronavirus infection has reduced activation of APC and
  early proinflammatory processes. A decrease in this pathway causes delayed, excessive
  proinflammatory cytokine responses leading to the infamous cytokine storm implicated
  in both components of immunity.
