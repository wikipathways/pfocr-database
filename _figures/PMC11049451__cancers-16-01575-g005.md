caption: Schematic representation of nuclear and membrane estrogen receptors and different
  mechanisms of estrogen action through genomic and non-genomic pathways. (I) Direct
  genomic signaling in which the E2-ER complex directly binds to the ERE and activates
  gene expression. (II) Indirect genomic signaling, where the E2-ER complex regulates
  expression by protein–protein interactions with other transcription factors at their
  respective response elements. (III) Ligand-independent signaling, in which activation
  occurs by phosphorylation of ERs or their co-regulators. (IV) Non-genomic signaling,
  which includes the activation of various protein kinase cascades in response to
  E2 binding to membrane forms of ERα and ERβ or to the membrane estrogen receptors
  ERα36, GPER1, and NaV1.2. Created with https://BioRender.com (accessed on 5 January
