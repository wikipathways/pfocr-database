caption: Aging is associated increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in
  platelets due to mitochondrial dysfunction. ROS activates the mTOR signaling pathway
  resulting in increased platelet activation. In older individuals, platelet activation
  is characterized by increased αIIβ3 integrin activation. Degranulation upon activation
  induces the releases of coagulation factors and inflammatory mediators. Increased
  P-selectin expression and release of granzyme A from platelets promotes the formation
  of platelet-monocyte aggregations and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These
  cytokines and platelet-derived cytokines released from granules and PMP promote
  endothelial activation and increased systemic inflammation. Together, these events
  contribute to increased systemic inflammation and elevated risk for atherothrombotic
  events in aging.
