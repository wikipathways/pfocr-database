caption: 'The multiple pathways of CD44/CD44v6-promoted CIC motility: CD44/CD44v6
  drive CIC motility by activation of signaling cascades as well as protease activation.
  (A) Motility can become promoted by the association with RTK. CD44v-EGFR binding
  induces EGFR activation. The activated EGFR in cooperation with CD44-associated
  ERM promotes initiates activation of the Stat3 pathway and EMT gene transcription
  factors. Through the association of CD44v4-v10 with MET, oncogenes become activated,
  which is accompanied by transformation of epithelial cells in the colon. Also via
  the CD44v6 association with MET, ERM promotes MET and downstream MAPK and β-catenin
  activation, which contributes to activation and nuclear localization of several
  EMT transcription factors. (B) CD44 also associates with GPCR, a prominent example
  being the CD44-CXCR4 axis. Depending on HA crosslinking, SDF1-bound, CD44v-associated
  CXCR4 promotes activation of the MAPK pathway, which supports tumor cell and EC
  motility. (C) CD44v contributes to EMT. As demonstrated for activation of the Wnt
  signaling cascade, the supportive CD44 activity can rely on CD44-associated molecules.
  CD44-associated LRP6 binds to Frizzled, which strengthens Wnt signaling. WNT signaling
  upregulates SNAI1 to repress epithelial genes, such as E-cadherin. (D) Through the
  association of CD44 with integrins, CD44 gains access to focal adhesion kinase (FAK),
  and integrins gain access to Src kinases and ERM proteins, so that the integrin-paxillin
  association becomes weakened and the GEM-integrated CD44-ezrin-integrin-FAK complex
  moves toward the leading edge of the cell, promoting cell migration. (E) The connection
  between CD44 and cytoskeletal linker protein provides another pathway promoting
  motility, where RHOA plays a major role. The RHOA-specific GEF p115RHOGEF, which
  interacts with CD44, activates the serine/threonine Rho kinase (ROCK), a downstream
  target of RHOA. ROCK phosphorylates CD44, leading to enhanced ankyrin binding and
  guiding CD44 to the leading edge of migrating cells. (F) The crosstalk with proteases
  adds to the engagement of CD44 in motility. Three examples are shown. CD44-associated
  PLCγ triggers via IP3 Ca++ influx. Ca++ promotes proADAM10 dissociation from calmodulin;
  membrane bound ADAM10 contribution to cleavage of the CD44 extracellular regions.
  ADAM17 colocalizes with CD44 at Rac-regulated membrane ruffling areas and becomes
  activated by PKC and Rac. Finally, activated ADAM17 also promotes CD44 extracellular
  region cleavage. After ectodomain cleavage, CD44 becomes accessible to the presenilin/γ-secretase
  complex, which triggers intramembrane CD44 cleavage, setting free the CD44-ICD.
  The CD44-ICD binding to a DNA consensus sequence in the promoter regions of CD44
  and MMP-9 gene potentiates CD44 and MMP9 transcription.'
