caption: 'Top HHcy-altered pathway network (Cytoscape). Genes in the top 9 Hcy-altered
  pathways (FDR<0.05) identified by GSEA () were further filtered (P < 0.05) and visualized
  using ClueGo v2.5.4 and CluePedia v1.5.4 applications in Cytoscape v3.7.1. to develop
  the pathway networks. A. Top 4 HHcy-activated pathways and network (from HHcy-induced
  genes, FDR<0.05). B. Top 5 HHcy-suppressed pathways and network (from HHcy-reduced
  genes, FDR<0.05). C. Network of HHcy-altered pathways (from HHcy-altered SDE mRNAs,
  P < 0.05, FC ≥ 1.50). Representative pathways were also found in the top list. Spheres
  depict pathways in red for suppressed and blue for activated pathways. Small dots
  with red labeling are representative genes. The color of the dots indicating reduced
  (red) and induced (blue) genes. Sphere size proportionally reflects strength of
  association to the pathway with SDE genes. Thicker network edges represent stronger
  associations. Pathways are denoted by the colored coded pie. Circled clusters represent
  matched pathways from A&B to C indicated by color. The names and the statistical
  details for HHcy-changed and the HHcy-altered SDE mRNA are listed in  Abbreviations:
  FDR, false discovery rate; HHcy, hyperhomocysteinemia; mRNA, messenger RNA; SDE,
  significantly differentially expressed. (For interpretation of the references to
  color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)'
