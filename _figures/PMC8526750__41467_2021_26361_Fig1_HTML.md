caption: A multi-phased metabolic engineering strategy was implemented to enable de
  novo production of isoflavonoids, following the pipeline of screening-reconstruction-application.
  In screening phase I (green box), a synthetic DEIN pathway was established and metabolic
  factors improving the performance of rate-limiting reactions were identified using
  a moderate p-HCA producing platform strain QL11. In reconstruction phase II (orange
  box), the DEIN production was further optimized in a wild-type strain QL179 harboring
  the deletion of galactose utilizing genes (GAL7/10/1), through amplifying gene expression,
  enhancing substrate transfer, combining effective genetic targets identified in
  phase I and fine-tuning the expression of a key gene involved in competing metabolic
  pathway (orange triangle). For application phase III (magenta box), the generated
  DEIN platform strain was used as the starting point for the production of bioactive
  glucosides PIN and DIN through introducing plant glycosyltransferases and enhancing
  the supply of glycosyl group donor UDP-glucose. The selected plant biosynthetic
  genes and overexpressed yeast native genes for isoflavonoid production were highlighted
  in blue boxes. Magenta arrows, designed DEIN biosynthetic pathway. Blue arrows,
  reactions for generating glucosides; gray arrows, byproduct pathway. At4CL1, 4-coumarate-coenzyme
