caption: CD40 induces killing of T. gondii via autophagy. CD40 ligation stimulates
  autophagy by activating ULK1, upstream kinase in the autophagy pathway. This process
  is dependent on calcium sensor CaMKKβ that activates energy/nutrient sensor AMPK.
  Besides activating ULK1, AMPK inhibits mTORC1, an inhibitor of autophagy. In addition,
  CD40 stimulates autophagy by triggering activation of pro-autophagy proteins PKR
  and eIF2α, upregulating autophagy protein Beclin 1, and releasing Beclin 1 from
  its negative regulator Bcl-2 after Bcl-2 phosphorylation induced by TNF receptor
  (TNFR)-JNK signaling. CD40 induces recruitment of LC3 around parasitophorous vacuole
  membrane (PVM) followed by Rab7-dependent fusion with lysosomes and killing of parasite.
  This process requires ULK1, Beclin 1, PI3KC3, ATG5, ATG7, and lysosomal enzymes.
