caption: Diagram illustrating how BA inhibited glycolysis by targeting GRP78. BA interrupted
  the binding of GRP78 and PERK, which initiated ER stress, and subsequently activated
  eIF2α phosphorylation, resulting in β-catenin inhibition and c-Myc-mediated aerobic
  glycolysis. Meanwhile, the ER stress apoptotic pathway was triggered.
