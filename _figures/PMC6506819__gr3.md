caption: Schematic Representation of Pathogenic Signaling Associated with Disease-Associated
  Variants(A) Effect of MIA pathway defects on maturation of NDUFB10 associated with
  lactic acidosis and cardiomyopathy.(B) Deficient processing of YME1L1 by MPP upon
  import to the mitochondrial matrix causes defects in OPA1 cleavage, resulting in
  mitochondrial fragmentation and atrophy of optic nerves.(C) Combination of genetic
  variants weakening AGT peroxisomal targeting and protein folding together lead to
  inappropriate localization to the mitochondria, causing deficient glycoxylate metabolism,
  nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure. For each example, top panel indicates wild-type
  function, and bottom panel illustrates defect associated with mitochondrial import
  variant. For full description of the variants, see text.
