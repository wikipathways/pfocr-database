caption: Integrated metabolic networks of significantly altered metabolic pathways
  of OB+C.s versus OB patients. (A) Metabolic map of OB+C.s versus OB patients. Log2(FC),
  an estimate of the log2-transformed ratio of the relative content of metabolites
  in OB+C.s patients to that in OB patients. (B) The 17 key metabolites of OB+C.s
  versus OB patients in the ESI+ and ESI- ion modes and their association with metabolic
  pathway diagram of the relationship between them. “Solid line” represents the increase
  of metabolites; “dotted line” represents the reduction of metabolites; “Red line”
  represents metabolite pathway.
