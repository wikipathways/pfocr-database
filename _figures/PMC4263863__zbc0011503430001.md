caption: The proposed biosynthetic pathway of GAL. A, a schematic representation of
  the GAL macrolactone backbone assembly line and the proposed biosynthetic pathway.
  B, the proposed role of GalA-E in GAL biosynthesis; the intermediacy of GAL-C in
  GAL-B biogenesis is described. For simplicity, the stereochemistry in each chiral
  center is not shown in the structure but is instead indicated by R or S. GalB harbors
  a truncated KS domain. GalC is homologous to known KSs but lacks the catalytic Cys
  residue. Both are indicated as ψKS to denote that they are non-canonical KSs.
