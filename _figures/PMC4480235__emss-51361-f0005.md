caption: Binding of different ligands results in recruitment of different effectors
  to the tail of DC-SIGN. High mannose ligands such as ManLAM promote binding of LSP1,
  KSR1 and CNK in a tyrosine-independent fashion. This complex triggers the small
  GTPase Ras, which activates Raf-1. Raf-1 activation culminates in acetylation of
  NF-κB p65 and alters the pattern of gene expression induced through TLR signaling.
  Fucose-based ligands promote binding of LSP1 only, which acts in a Raf-1-independent
  fashion to enhance TLR-dependent synthesis of IL-10 and to decrease production of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, another DC-SIGN agonist, Salp15, activates
  a Raf-1/MEK pathway that promotes TNF and IL-6 mRNA decay and decreases production
  of IL-12 by impairing chromatin remodeling.
