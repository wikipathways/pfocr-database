caption: Schematic of the transcriptional and metabolic adjustments of lignin biosynthesis
  in 4cl1 mutants. A, The major monolignol biosynthetic routes are shown with relevant
  pathway steps and intermediates discussed in this study. Red and blue fonts indicate
  higher and lower abundances, respectively, in the 4cl1 mutants. The slightly reduced
  G-lignin is shown in black to contrast with the drastically reduced S-lignin in
  blue. Orange background shading depicts the pathway flows, with thickness representing
  relative transcript and metabolite level changes detected in the mutants. B and
  C, Coexpression module assignments for lignin pathway genes and TFs in control (B)
  and mutant (C) networks. Genes are arranged and color-coded by modules they were
  assigned to, and red and blue text in C indicates up- or downregulation in the mutants,
  respectively. Abbreviations are the same as in .
