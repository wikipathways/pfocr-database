caption: '(A-I) Subnetworks include genes such as TP53, BRCA1, and MYC, which are
  mutated in ovarian carcinomas although their expression level is not significantly
  altered (white nodes). Red nodes indicate overexpression of genes in HGSOC subnetworks,
  and green nodes indicate underexpression. Abbreviations: cell cycle (CC), cell growth
  (CG), cell proliferation (CP), cell differentiation (CD), DNA damage (DD), DNA repair
  (DDR), DNA replication (DRN), regulation of kinase activity (RKA), receptor protein
  tyrosine kinase signaling pathway (RTKs), positive regulation of metabolic process
  (PRM), response to drug (RD), response to stress (RS).'
