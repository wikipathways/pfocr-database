caption: (A) Insulin signaling pathway with emphasis on its role in regulating energy
  homeostasis and nutrient sensing. Lines with end arrows indicate activation, whereas
  those with perpendicular bars at the end indicate inhibition. Genes exhibiting altered
  hypothalamic mRNA expression levels in LP rats are represented in shady boxes. (B)
  Coordinated regulation of energy metabolism and the circadian clock. The diagram
  illustrates how PGC-1α and nuclear receptors recruit protein complexes and bind,
  on one hand, to NR response elements (NRREs) within the promoter region of target
  genes regulating energy metabolism and, on the other hand, to CLOCK and Bmal1, the
  core genes of the circadian clock. Through the coordinated regulation of the circadian
  clock and energy metabolism, PGC-1α, RORα and REV-ERBα play an essential role in
  the adaptation of metabolic gene expression to the temporal availability of nutrients.
  We found that the expression of the two former genes as well as that of GR, CLOCK
  and several other NR was permanently altered by perinatal protein restriction. LR
   =  Leptin receptor; IR  =  Insulin receptor; TrkR  =  tyrosine kinase receptor.
