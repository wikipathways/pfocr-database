caption: Reciprocal regulation of phase separation and cellular metabolism. (a) Hypoxia
  induces condensation of glycolytic enzymes into ‘G bodies’. G bodies promote cycling
  through the entire glycolytic pathway, reflected by increased levels of glucose-6-phosphate,
  fructose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and decreased levels of acetyl-CoA.
  Under normoxia, glycolytic enzymes remain diffusive in the cytoplasm. Starvation
  induces filament formation of glutamine synthetase (Gln1) and promotes its inactivation
  and storage in the cytoplasm. In the presence of nutrients, Gln1 is evenly distributed
  through the cytoplasm. (b) In response to growth signals, mTORC1 (blue) tunes macromolecular
  crowding by modulating ribosome concentration (grey) in the cytoplasm. Higher crowding
  favors phase separation and molecular assembly. In the absence of growth signals,
  ribosome concentration is decreased by ribophagy. glucose-6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
