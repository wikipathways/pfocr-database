caption: SETD7 targets and their regulation of cancer-related processes in lung cancer.
  (a) Tumour suppressor—SETD7 can inhibit proliferation through downregulation of
  CCNA1 and CCND1 []. SETD7 can also inhibit angiogenesis and tumour growth through
  methylation of HIF-1α [], which can be demethylated by LSD1 to induce VEGFA [].
  SETD7 inhibits MMP2, TWIST1 and VEGFA and/or JAK/STA pathway [] to prevent migration.
  Under DNA damaging conditions, SETD7 methylates SUV39H1 inhibiting its methyltransferase
  activity, which results in genome instability and consequent apoptosis of LCa cells
  []. (b) Tumour promoter—SETD7 methylates GLI3 to improve its stability and DNA binding
  to the promoter regions of its downstream target GLI1 which positively regulates
  the activation of SHH signalling in LCa promoting tumour growth and metastasis [].
  The long non-coding RNA LINC01194 acts as a tumour promoter in lung adenocarcinomas
  by positively modulating SETD7 expression []. Under DNA damaging conditions, SETD7
  directly methylates E2F-1 preventing E2F-1 stabilisation by acetylation to promote
  apoptosis mediated by TP73 []. SETD7 downregulates E2F-1 activity, thus preventing
  TP73-mediated apoptosis; moreover, SETD7 co-activates E2F-1-dependent transcription
  of CCNE1 [].
