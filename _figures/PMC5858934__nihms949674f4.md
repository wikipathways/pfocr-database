caption: Model for RHO/ROCK-dependent regulation of trophectoderm-lineage specification.
  RHO/ROCK signaling promotes the trophectoderm cell fate via two major inputs integrated
  by the HIPPO pathway to activate YAP. The first involves RHO/ROCK establishing the
  apical domain, whereas the second involves RHO/ROCK regulating the actomyosin cytoskeletal
  system. Both converge toward and modulate the HIPPO pathway, resulting in LATS (LATS1/2)
  suppression in the outside cells where unphosphorylated YAP promotes expression
  of trophectoderm lineage-specific genes. It is possible that RHO/ROCK and cell polarity
  mutually regulate each other and that RHO/ROCK also acts through actomyosin to modulate
  cell polarity. See text for details, sections “Possible Mechanisms of How RHO and
  ROCK Regulate TE Specification” and “Questions to Be Answered”
