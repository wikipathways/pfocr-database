caption: 'Circular RNAs in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and white matter damage.
  (A) cZNF292 can act as a sponge of miR-22 and then participate in inflammation via
  wnt/β-catenin pathway of the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) cell
  model. (B) In HIE rats, chr1: 200899066|201028171 can sponge miR-126a and miR-9a
  during apoptosis. circ-camk4 might participate in neuronal apoptosis by MAPK signaling
  pathway, which was showed through OGD/R neurons. (C) circ-003342 can sponge miR-143
  to associate with vascular endothelium thereby regulate the blood-brain barrier
  in OGD/R brain microvascular endothelial cells. (D) hsa_circ_0001868, hsa_circ_0083176,
  hsa_circ_0018401, hsa_circ_0006357, and hsa_circ_0006716 are increased in premature
  infants serum to be biomarkers of white matter damage. (E) circSATB2 can regulate
  the extension of axons via animal and cell studies on schizophrenia.'
