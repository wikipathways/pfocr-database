caption: The Pathway of Metabolism of Folate in Connection with DNA Methylation. The
  MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) enzyme plays a crucial role in this
  pathway. A common C>T transition at nucleotide 14783 is responsible for a defective
  MTHFR enzyme with a substantially lower activity in the case of the homozygous for
  the mutation (T/T) and the heterozygous (C/T) genotypes. Impaired activity of the
  MTHFR enzyme ultimately leads to DNA hypomethylation, which leads to oncogenesis.
  Supplementation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is directly downstream of the
  MTHFR enzyme, along with the essential cofactor methylcobalamin, and/or supplementation
  with S-adenosylmethionine may bypass the defective MTHFR enzyme and may lead to
  normal DNA methylation.
