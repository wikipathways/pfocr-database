caption: Branched metabolism of arginine. Activation of the polyamine pathway leads
  to similar biochemical conditions to eNOS−/− mice that have excessive erectile responses,
  similar to priapism seen in human patients. The thicker arrows represent the “channeling”
  of arginine into polyamine synthesis which occurs with intracorporal injection of
  plasmids expressing opiorphins.
papertitle: The mechanism of opiorphin-induced experimental priapism in rats involves
  activation of the polyamine synthetic pathway.
