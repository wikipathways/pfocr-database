caption: 'Metabolic pathway of sphingolipids. Ceramide can be generated through three
  mechanisms: de novo synthesis from serine and palmitoyl-CoA, the salvage pathway
  from sphingosine, and sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Ceramide can be also phosphorylated
  by ceramide kinase to form ceramide-1-phosphate, which can be dephosphorylated by
  phosphatases to form ceramide (not shown). Ceramide can be transformed into sphingosine
  that, in turn, can be phosphorylated by SPHK1 and SPHK2 to form S1P. S1P can be
  dephosphorylated into sphingosine or degraded by S1P lyase, resulting in the production
  of hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine. Finally, sphingosine can be transformed
  to sphingadiene by the fatty acid desaturase 3 (not shown).'
