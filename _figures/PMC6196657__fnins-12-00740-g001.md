caption: Expression and regulation of hepcidin in brain cells. Brain hepcidin expression
  is upregulated during inflammation. LPS is a product of inflammation that activates
  TLR4 receptor. Activated TLR4 induces the production of cytokines such as IL-6,
  which then goes on to upregulate hepcidin expression via JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Recently,
  it has been shown that LPS can induce hepcidin expression in microglia through BMP/SMAD
  pathway as well. LPS is a strong stimulus for iron import, because it induces upregulation
  of DMT1. Another pathway that can induce hepcidin expression in neurons is realized
  through CHOP and C/EBPα molecules. This occurs during SAH. In any case, most of
  hepcidin is produced by glial cells during inflammatory conditions. It acts on target
  cells by degrading FPN, which reduces iron export out of brain cells. Hepcidin also
  downregulates iron import proteins, DMT1 and TFR1. In astrocytes this action is
  realized through cAMP/PKA pathway. BMP6, bone morphogenetic protein 6; cAMP, cyclic
