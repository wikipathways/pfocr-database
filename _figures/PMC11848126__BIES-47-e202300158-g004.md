caption: The mTOR signalling pathway, highlighting mTORC1 and interactions that regulate
  canonical initiation. Green shows procanonical factors, red shows anticanonical
  factors, and orange shows proteins implicated in the circadian TTFL (which may promote
  or suppress canonical initiation, depending on context). Solid lines represent direct
  interactions; dotted lines represent interactions that might be indirect. For regulatory
  proteins with multiple paralogues, such as AKT1, S6Kβ1, and 4E‐BP1, the related
  proteins are assumed to function similarly and only one paralogue is shown. Note
  how multiple branches converge on the cap‐binding complex and the 43S preinitiation
  complex, which must come together for translational initiation
