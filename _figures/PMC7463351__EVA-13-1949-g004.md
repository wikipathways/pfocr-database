caption: 'Differential expressed genes between highland and lowland maize landraces
  encoding enzymes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. The flavonoid biosynthesis
  pathway for maize including genes underlying enzymatic steps (white diamonds) and
  metabolic intermediates (light purple rectangles). Multiple circles next to an enzyme
  gene name represent multiple genes encoding that enzyme type—cross‐reference Figure 
  and Figure  for associated gene names and log2fold change values, respectively.
  p‐coumaroyl‐CoA, the final product in the general phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway
  (Figure ), is the entry point into the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Anthocyanins—cyanidin
  and pelargonidin; C‐glycosyl flavones—maysin; O‐glycosyl flavones—apigenin and luteolin;
  flavonols—kaempferol and quercetin. Genes were considered differentially expressed
  when significant at a 0.05 FDR rate using a Benjamini–Hochberg correction. Enzyme
  genes are as follows: CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavonoid‐3‐beta‐hydroxylase;
  FNS, flavone synthase F3’H, flavonoid‐3’‐hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; FGT, flavonol glucosyltransferase; ANS, anthocyanidin reductase;
  3GT, flavonoid 3‐O glucosyltransferase; F2H, flavanone‐2‐hydroxylase; CGT, C‐glycosyltransferase;
  SM2, salmon silk 2; SM1, salmon silk 1. Genes up‐regulated in highland landraces
  are represented by blue and those up‐regulated in lowland landraces are represented
  by red. Full circles represent a log2fold change of 2.11 (i.e., 4.32 times higher
  expression); partially filled circles represent up‐regulation to a portion of 4.32
  times'
