caption: Ligand binds to and activates its membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptor
  (GPCR) leading to the dissociation of the Gα,s subunit from the GPCR. Gα,s then
  activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) which converts intracellular ATP into cAMP. cAMP
  then activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase—or protein kinase A (PKA). The catalytic
  PKA subunit, now freed of its regulatory subunits, acts on cAMP-response element-binding
  (CREB) protein. Phosphorylated CREB (phospho-CREB) binds to cAMP response elements
  (CREs) with the promoter regions of SMN2. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (cnPDEs)
  diminish cAMP signaling by breaking down cAMP into AMP. This figure is adapted from
