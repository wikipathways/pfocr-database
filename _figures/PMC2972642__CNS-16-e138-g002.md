caption: 'Schematic diagram of OTR‐linked signaling pathways. Oxytocin receptor (OTR)
  activation leads to three different GTP‐binding protein mechanisms. The major mechanism
  is mediated by the Gq/PLC/InsP3pathway. When oxytocin binds to OTR, it activates
  Gαq/11 and then phospholipase C (PLC), which induces the cleavage of PIP2 to inositoltrisphosphate
  (InsP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). InsP3 induces Ca2+ release from Ca2+ stores via
  InsP3R and, in some cells, causes Ca2+‐induced Ca2+ release (CICR) via the ryanodine
  receptor (RyR). The activation of Gq also causes membrane depolarization*, which,
  in turn, activates VGCCs and then facilitates Ca2+ entry through VGCCs. Thus, increased
  cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) stimulates CaMK after binding to the Ca2+ binding protein
  Calmodulin. The Ca2+/CaM complex then activates CaMK and causes various cellular
  responses, such as smooth muscle contractions, or induces the activation of several
  different types of enzymes, such as NOS or PI3K. DAG causes protein kinase C (PKC)
  activation and also various cellular responses. Additional pathways activated through
  the OTR include the MAP‐kinase (MAPK) and the Rho kinase pathways. The increased
  transcription of COX2 mediates the increased production and secretion of prostaglandins.
  The OTR‐mediated opening of Ca2+ channels is likely mediated through free Gβγ subunits.
  The OT receptor is known to be coupled with the other G proteins, Gs and Gi, both
  of which are linked with the AC pathway. The proliferative effects involve MAPK‐mediated
  activation of specific gene transcription. The trophic effects are mediated via
  a PKC‐mediated activation of eEF2. Activation of the Rho and MAP kinase pathways,
  the increase in intracellular Ca2+ and the increased prostaglandin secretion all
  contribute to the contractile effects. The antiproliferative effects observed in
  certain cells types appear to be mediated via αi G protein subunits. For further
  details, see the text and the references therein. The solid red lines and broken
  blue lines indicate activation and inhibition, respectively. Abbreviations: VGCC
