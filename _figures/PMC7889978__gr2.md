caption: 'The adaptive evolution of CAM pathway, plant circadian rhythm, and plant
  hormone signaling in Aloe veraThe important genes of the CAM pathway, plant circadian
  rhythm, and plant hormone signaling are shown with their function: (A) for CAM pathway,
  (B) for plant circadian rhythm, and (C) for plant hormone signaling. The genes in
  Lavender had positively selected codon sites, the genes in Green had unique substitutions
  with function impact, and the genes in Red showed both the signs of site-specific
  adaptive evolution in Aloe vera. There were no CAM pathway genes that had only positively
  selected codon sites.See also .'
