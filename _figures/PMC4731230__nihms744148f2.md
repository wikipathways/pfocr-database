caption: Extrinsic and intrinsic regulators of MuSC function are altered in aging.
  In young muscles, MuSCs are transiently activated after tissue damage by released
  inflammatory cytokines and growth factor signaling coordinated by immune cells,
  fibroblasts and FAPs. These factors dynamically stimulate MuSC regulatory pathways,
  including Delta-Notch, governing cell cycle and transcription control of MuSC fate,
  resulting in temporary activation and self-renewal, with homeostasis reached upon
  completion of myofiber repair through re-induction of stem cell quiescence, in part
  via activation of Sprouty, an inhibitor of FGF signaling,. The thickness of the
  arrow indicates strength of activation of the pathway in young and aged MuSCs. In
  aged muscles, self-renewal signals (for example, Delta) diminish and inflammatory
  and fibrogenic signals are elevated and prolonged,, resulting in aberrant MuSC activation
  and loss of quiescence,,. These changes with aging are commensurate with the onset
  of aberrant activation in the β-catenin, Stat3, FGF, p38α/β MAPK, and SMAD signaling
  pathways. By elderly ages, a subset of aged MuSCs become senescent,.
