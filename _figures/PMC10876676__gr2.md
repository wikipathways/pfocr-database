caption: Upon infection with HIV, the virus infiltrates cluster differentiation positive
  (CD4+) T-lymphocytes and induce pro-inflammatory intracellular micro-environment
  marked by increased IL-β. The CD4+ T-lymphocytes undergo pyroptosis showering adjacent
  uninfected immune cell (including CD4+ T-lymphocytes) with IL-1β and new viral cells.
  Interleukin-1β activates M1 macrophages to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6,
  IL-8, and TNF-α) and neutrophils to release myeloperoxidase (MPO). The increased
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulates hepatocytes to release the acute
  phase response proteins serum amyloid A and C-reactive proteins, while elevated
  levels of MPO promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α), MPO, and the cute phase response proteins induces
  endothelial activation marked by elevated serum levels of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, P-selectin,
  and endothelial ROS. Sustained secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8,
  and TNF-α), MPO, acute phase response proteins, and ROS overpowers the anti-inflammatory
  response pathway by M2 macrophages preceding chronic inflammation and endothelial
  dysfunction (Created with BioRender.com)
