caption: MapMan analysis and comparison of the metabolic changes in IR24 rice at 1
  and 3 d after infection with the mutants ΔxanA and Δimp relative to those with PXO99A
  infection. In each comparison group, the corresponding DEGs with |log2 (fold change)| ≥ 1
  were imported into MapMan software. The gray circles indicate that no differentially
  expressed genes were matched in this process. The red and blue squares attached
  to each metabolic pathway represent up- and downregulated genes, respectively. The
  color intensity represents the gene expression level (log2 ratio mutant/PXO99A),
  as indicated by the color scale. Detailed information is shown in Table S
