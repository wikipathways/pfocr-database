caption: Chronic stress and depression are associated with reductions of both glutamate
  and GABA function, including atrophy of pyramidal neurons and reductions of glutamate
  and GABA neuronal markers in the medial PFC and hippocampus. Rapid acting antidepressants,
  notably ketamine and esketamine that produce rapid antidepressant actions in depressed
  patients, rapidly up-regulate glutamate synapse density, synaptic protein levels
  (i.e., PSD95, GluA1, VGLUTs), and function, and also increase GABA function, including
  increased VGAT, GAD, and gephyrin. Ketamine causes a transient burst of glutamate,
  resulting from blockade of NMDA receptors on tonic firing GABA interneurons. This
  glutamate burst causes synaptic remodeling and resetting of glutamate and GABA systems.
  Other rapid acting antidepressants, including the muscarinic receptor antagonist
  scopolamine and mGluR2/3 antagonists also produce rapid antidepressant actions via
  transient stimulation of glutamate. The glutamate burst stimulates BDNF release,
  which activates downstream signaling, including the Akt-mTORC1 pathway that increases
  synaptic proteins synthesis. Blockade of this pathway with the selective mTORC1
  inhibitor rapamycin blocks the synaptic and antidepressant behavioral actions of
  ketamine. Deficits of GABA, combined with evidence that fluctuations of neuroactive
  steroids contribute to depression in women have led to development of GABAergic
  agents, including formulations of alloprenanolone (brexanolone and SAGE-217), which
  act as positive allosteric modulators of the GABAAR complex.
