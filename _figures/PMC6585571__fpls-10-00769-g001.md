caption: 'Schematic Carotenoid Metabolic Pathway and main factors affecting carotenoid
  synthesis and accumulation. The pathway shows the primary steps found in nearly
  all plant species. The synthesis of carotenoids from core primary metabolism initiates
  via the plastid-localized 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, leading
  to the production of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl
  diphosphate (DMAPP), central precursors of other isoprenoid metabolites including
  tocopherols, chlorophylls, quinones, gibberellins (GA), and monoterpenes. The first
  step of the MEP pathway involves the transketolase-type condensation of pyruvate
  and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P) to 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP)
  and is catalyzed by the enzyme DXP synthase (DXS). MEP is subsequently formed via
  an intramolecular rearrangement and reduction of DXP by the enzyme DXP reductoisomerase
  (DXR). MEP is then converted in IPP and DMAPP by a number of consecutive steps catalyzed
  by five independent enzymes: 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidyltransferase
  (MCT), 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (CMK), 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MDS), 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate
  synthase (HDS), and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HDR). IPP
  isomerase (IDI) catalyzes the isomerization of the relatively un-reactive (IPP)
  to the more-reactive DMAPP. Geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), the immediate C20
  ubiquitous isoprenoid precursor in the synthesis of all plastid carotenoids, is
  generated by geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPS) that catalyzes the condensation
  of three IPP and one DMAPP units. The first committed step in carotenoid biosynthesis
  is the condensation of two molecules of GGPP by phytoene synthase (PSY) to form
  the C40 carotenoid phytoene as a 15-(Z) isomer. Phytoene is converted to all-trans-lycopene
  by sequential desaturation and Z-E isomerization reactions. In plants, at least
  four enzymes are required: phytoene desaturase (PDS), ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS),
  ζ-carotene isomerase (Z-ISO) and carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO). PDS/ZISO and ZDS/CRTISO
  constitute metabolic units involved in the steps catalyzing the synthesis of 9,9′-di-(Z)-ζ-carotene,
  and all(E)-lycopene, respectively (). Cyclization of lycopene with lycopene     -
  (LCYE) and β-cyclases (LCYB) is a crucial branch-point in carotenoid metabolism
  and generates carotenoid diversity distinguished by different cyclic end groups.
  In one branch, a single enzyme, lycopene β-cyclase (LCYB or CYCB in tomato fruits),
  introduces a β-ring at both ends of lycopene to form β-carotene in da sequential
  two-step reaction. The first dedicated reaction in the other branch, leading to
  lutein, requires both LCYE and LCYB to introduce one β- and one     -ring into lycopene
  to form α-carotene. α-carotene and β-carotene are further hydroxylated to produce
  xanthophylls (e.g., lutein and zeaxanthin). α-carotene is acted upon by β-ring hydroxylases
  (CYP97A and BCH1/2) to form zeinoxanthin, which is then hydroxylated by an     -ring
  hydroxylase (CYP97C) to lutein. β-carotene can be hydroxylated in a two-step reaction
  to zeaxanthin, with β-cryptoxanthin as an intermediate product by BCH1/2. Zeaxanthin
  epoxidase (ZEP) hydroxylates β-rings of zeaxanthin in two consecutive steps to yield
  antheraxanthin and then violaxanthin. Zeaxanthin can be epoxidized to violaxanthin,
  and a set of light- and dark-controlled reactions known as the xanthophyll cycle
  rapidly optimize the concentration of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in the cell through
  the action of zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) and violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE), respectively,
  via antheraxanthin. Violaxanthin is converted to neoxanthin by neoxanthin synthase
  (NXS), which represents the final step in the core carotenoid biosynthetic pathway.
  Catabolism of carotenoids proceeds by their cleavage by enzymes of the carotenoid
  cleavage dioxygenase family (CCDs) and 9-(Z)-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenase family
  (NCEDs) to produce various apocarotenoids, phytohormones (ABA and SLs) and isoprenoid
  volatiles. In addition to enzymatic cleavage, oxidation via peroxidases/lipo-oxygenases
  or non-enzymatic photochemical oxidation of carotenoids have also evidenced especially
  in photosynthetic tissues under high light stress and suggested to mediate carotenoid
  homeostasis.'
