caption: 'Mitochondrial and metabolic checkpoints of T-cell activation and apoptosis
  signals. Antigen binding-initiated signaling through the T-cell receptor (TCR)–CD3–TCRζ-chain
  complex and the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3-K) and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK). Increased cytosolic Ca2+; concentration
  activates the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates the
  NFAT. Dephosphorylated NFAT can translocate to the nucleus, where it promotes transcription
  of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in concert with AP-1 and NF-κB. Ca2+ flux into mitochondria
  increases production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) and NF-κB activation
  []. Excess ROI production and disruption of ΔΨm lead to activation-induced cell
  death executed by caspase-3 (digesting vitally important proteins PARP, 70K U1RNP,
  lamin and actin) and caspase-activated DNase (CAD). Cleavage by caspase-3 is thought
  to expose cryptic epitopes and cause autoantigenicity of self-antigens []. Dehydroascorbate
  (DHA) is imported through glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and is metabolized through
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), thereby enhancing reduced glutathione (GSH)
  levels. DHA also increases surface expression of Fas receptor (FasR) []. Glutathione
  reductase and TRX reductase synthesize GSH and TRX-DT at the expense of NADPH. Formulation
  of the PPP and its efficiency to provide NADPH is dependent on the expression of
  G6PD (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and transaldose (TAL) [,]. Dcm is controlled
  by intracellular GSH/NADH/NADPH levels, integrity of the permeability transition
  pore complex (PTPC), largely composed of the adenine nucleotie translocator (ANT)
  (inner membrane) and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (outer membrane), and
  translocation and dimerization of proand anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in
  the intermembrane space []. TCR-activation-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization
  is mediated through nitric oxide (NO) production by endothelial/neuronal NO synthase
  (e/nNOS), which, in turn, is regulated by ROIs and Ca2+; []. Abbreviations: GSSG,
  oxidized glutathione; IFN-γ, interferon γ; P, phosphate; PLCγ2, phospholipase Cγ2;
  TGF-β1, transforming growth factor β1; TRX-DT, thioredoxin.'
