caption: Proposed role of MhSultr3;1a in improving growth under low-S conditions.
  MhSultr3;1a was responsible for the uptake of  from the soil by Malus roots and
  induced by a low-S treatment. Furthermore, the upregulation of MhSultr3;1a accumulated
  more  into Cys via the primary S assimilation pathway. Cys is a precursor for the
  synthesis of essential biomolecules and defense compounds, which is essential for
  the improvement of growth under S-limiting conditions. ATPS, ATP sulfurylase; APR,
  APS reductase; SiR, sulfite reductase; OASTL, OAS (thiol)-lyase; SAT, serine acetyltransferase.
