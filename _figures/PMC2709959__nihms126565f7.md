caption: (A). The effect of BD is mediated by hsf-1. Under conditions of abundant
  food, the dietary restriction pathway is inactive and hsf-1 activity and insulin/IGF-1-like
  signaling (IIS) are at normal levels. This leads to short life span and sensitivity
  to proteotoxicity. Under DR conditions, hsf-1 is activated along with other DR-responsive
  proteins (perhaps skn-1 and pha-4) to increase life span and suppress proteotoxicity.
  In mutants with reduced IIS, the DR pathway is inactive, but life span and resistance
  to proteotoxicity are increased through activation of daf-16. (B) BD and hsf-1 function
  in parallel to alter protein homeostasis. hsf-1 activity upregulates chaperone activity,
  which decreases the amount of misfolded proteins in vivo. At the same time, BD might
  both increase the rate of protein turnover and decrease the synthesis of new protein.
  These three factors would combine to improve protein homeostasis, decreasing the
  rate of aging.
