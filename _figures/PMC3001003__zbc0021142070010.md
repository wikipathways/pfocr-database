caption: Summary of TG-FN-mediated cell adhesion and FN fibril formation pathway.
  As a response to stress induction/tissue injury, the increased expression of TG2
  leads to its externalization and deposition into extracellular matrix and formation
  of TG-FN complex; meanwhile, the up-regulation and secretion of proteases, such
  as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), start to degrade the matrix protein during
  matrix turnover, leading to release of the RGD motif-containing fragments, which
  block integrin-mediated cell adhesion, inducing the loss of cell adhesion and cell
  death. The direct interaction between matrix FN-bound TG2 and the heparan sulfate
  chains of syndecan-4 leads to activation of the inside-out signaling of β1 integrins
  by the binding between PKCα and the intracellular domain of β1 integrins, promoting
  α5β1 integrin-related cell adhesion and focal adhesion formation. As a downstream
  molecule of syndecan-4, syndecan-2 is activated by intracellular PKCα, without the
  direct interaction with the matrix TG2; this mediates cytoskeletal formation and
  cell contraction via activation of ROCK, whereas its extracellular domain together
  with any α5β1 integrins not blocked by RGD peptides capture the soluble FN molecules
  and mediate the FN fibril deposition process, thus maintaining cell homeostasis.
