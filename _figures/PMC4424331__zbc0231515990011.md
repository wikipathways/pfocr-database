caption: The molecular mechanism of iron-induced RPE C3 production involves ERK1/2,
  SMAD3, and C/EBP-δ signaling. Increased intracellular iron (Fe3+) in RPE cells treated
  with FAC stimulates the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 followed by SMAD3 linker (Ser-213)
  phosphorylation (orange up arrow) in a non-canonical TGF-β pathway leading to up-regulation
  of C3, the central molecule of the complement cascade (the FAC-induced pathway is
  delineated by orange arrows). MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and SMAD3 inhibitor SIS3
  can block FAC-induced C3 up-regulation. FAC also results in decreased phosphorylation
  of SMAD3 C-terminal residues (Ser-423/425) at the SSVS motif (orange down arrow).
  Through SMAD3, FAC increases CEBPD mRNA and C/EBP-δ protein levels possibly by inducing
  CEBPD expression and relieving SMAD3-mediated inhibition at baseline (orange X over
  blue inhibitory line). The p-SMAD3 (Ser-213) complex remains extranuclear. In addition,
  FAC promotes the nuclear accumulation of C/EBP-δ protein. C/EBP-δ likely binds to
  the bZIP1 domain of the C3 promoter, inducing C3 expression. Once translated into
  protein, C3 is secreted and cleaved into C3a and C3b. Concurrently, Factor D catalyzes
  the activation of Factor B to form Bb and the cleavage product Factor Ba. Factors
  C3b and Bb together form the alternative pathway (AP) C3 convertase to amplify the
  activation of C3 by forming more C3b and C3a. The iron-induced non-canonical TGF-β
  pathway (orange) may cross-talk with the basal, canonical TGF-β pathway (blue; see
  “Discussion”), which is initiated by the binding of TGF-β ligand to the TGF-β receptor
  complex (types I and II) at the plasma membrane. Endogenous TGF-β binding maintains
  the phosphorylation levels of SMAD3 at both Ser-213 and Ser-423/425, ultimately
  acting as a negative regulator of basal C3 expression. Stimulatory arrows and inhibitory
  lines represent a functional link between the subsequent entities, not necessarily
  a direct interaction.
