caption: The JAK/STAT pathway and the establishment of dorsoventral polarity in the
  eye disc. Anterior is to the left and dorsal up, here and in all subsequent figures.
  (A) The transduction of extracellular signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus
  by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. (B) A schematized representation of ommatidial
  development and rotation. The movement of the morphogenetic furrow (MF) from posterior
  to anterior across the disc leads to the determination of successive rows of increasingly
  mature ommatidial clusters (red). Shortly before determination of the R7 photoreceptor
  (yellow), dorsal and ventral clusters rotate in opposite directions to generate
  the equator (blue line). (C) Ommatidial clusters at the equator in the third instar
  eye disc. All photoreceptor nuclei are marked by anti-Elav (red) and the R7 nucleus
  is also marked by expression of Prospero (green, yellow when overlaid). (D) Schematic
  representation of C showing the position of the equator (blue line) through this
  region and the green dorsal arrows and red ventral arrows used to indicate ommatidial
  polarity. (E) Adult eye section at the equator showing the stereotypical trapezoidal
  arrangement of rhabdomeres in each adult ommatidial cluster. Each ommatidium is
  surrounded by a hexagonal array of pigment granules. (F) Schematic representation
  of E showing position of the equator (blue line) through this region and the green
  dorsal arrows and red ventral arrows used to indicate ommatidial polarity.
