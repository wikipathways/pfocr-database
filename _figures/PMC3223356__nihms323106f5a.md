caption: Potential roles of GM-CSF. (A) and hydroxyurea (B) in regulating leukocyte
  counts and HbF expression in SCD. (A) In SCD, GM-CSF levels can be increased by
  chronic inflammation resulting from adhesive interactions among many types of blood
  cells and endothelial cells, in part perhaps from splenic dysfunction []. GM-CSF
  likely regulates both leukocyte numbers and HbF expression, and possibly G-CSF production
  as well. (B) Hydroxyurea, a nitric oxide donor, is shown to increase HbF expression
  by altering erythroid regeneration kinetics (dotted line) [,] as well as via the
  cyclic GMP-dependent pathway [,]. Nitric oxide down-regulates GM-CSF production
  []. Leukocyte reduction by hydroxyurea may be a result of direct inhibition of cell
  proliferation by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, and down-regulation of GM-CSF
  production via nitric oxide or proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNFα/β).
