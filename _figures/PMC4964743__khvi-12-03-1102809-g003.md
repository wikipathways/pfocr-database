caption: 'Regulation of HER3 and downstream signaling. HER3/ERBB3 adopts an active
  conformation following binding of a ligand, called neuregulin (NRG), in between
  domains I and III of the extracellular domain. Since the tyrosine kinase domain
  is impaired, HER3/ERBB3 can undergo only weak auto-phosphorylation. In addition,
  HER3/ERBB3 can form heterodimers with other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), leading
  to efficient trans-phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain. The main dimerization
  partner of HER3 is HER2/ERBB2 . Both the MAPK pathway (ERK, shown in purple) and
  the AKT pathway (gray) are activated when such heterodimers form. Nuclear translocation
  of the downstream effectors of these pathways permits transcriptional and translational
  regulation of genes involved in numerous cellular responses, such as cell cycle
  control, proliferation, survival, metabolism, apoptosis and angiogenesis. On its
  own, HER3 is regulated at different levels: 2 ubiquitin ligases, NEDD4 and NRDP1,
  have been reported to mediate its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. The
  deubiquitinating enzyme USP8, which is regulated by AKT, negatively regulates NRDP1.
  The activated androgen receptor (AR) also controls HER3 levels by binding to the
  NRDP1 promoter regions and activating NRDP1 transcription. In addition, several
  miRNA molecules, such as miR205, miR125a and miR125b, have been reported to control
  HER3/ERBB3 expression.'
