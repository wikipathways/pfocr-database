caption: A working model of the flow of information through the OS pathway from the
  environment and the clock in Neurospora. Acute osmotic shock signals through the
  sensor histidine kinase OS-1, and maybe other histidine kinases, to regulate the
  OS MAPK pathway and the levels of OS-2 phosphorylation and activity. The signal
  is passed from OS-1 to the histidine phosphotransferase HPT-1, and then from HPT-1
  to the response regulator RRG-1. This results in activation of the MAPK pathway
  and phosphorylation of OS-2. Phospho-OS-2 is predicted to regulate downstream effector
  kinases, transcription factors, proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, and translation
  factors. Osmotic shock results in an acute response in the target genes, including
  ccg-1, at any time of the day. In constant growth conditions, the FRQ/WCC oscillator
  (FWO) signals to the same pathway at or before RRG-1 to regulate rhythmic phosphorylation
  of OS-2 and rhythmic expression of downstream genes, such as ccg-1. Some details
  of the flow of information through the pathway are not completely understood and
  arrows to and within the OS pathway are intended to represent passage of information,
  not activation or repression of activity.
