caption: Proposed model for biofilm transcriptional regulation of pagP expression.
  The Rcs system is a two-component signal transduction system that responds to various
  environmental signals. (Pathway a) Proteins (RcsA, RcsC, RcsD, and RcsF) involved
  in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of response regulator RcsB are not required
  for pagP biofilm induction. (Pathway b) RcsB regulation is also independent of MatA,
  BglJ, and DctR, known to interact with the nonphosphorylated form of RcsB. (Pathway
  c) In response to ionic stress, RcsB and GadE could form a complex positively regulating
  pagP expression in a manner at least partially independent of the anti-H-NS factor
  SlyA. (Pathway d) This countersilencing mechanism leads to pagP biofilm induction,
  as well as to an increased level of lipid A palmitoylation, and could potentially
  lead to expression of additional biofilm-regulated genes.
