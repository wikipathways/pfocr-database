caption: 'Molecular pathomechanism of CRP-mediated damage in ischemic or hypoxemic
  tissue. Inflammation or acute oxygen-deprivation happens for example in acute myocardial
  infarction (AMI), stroke, during COVID-19 related pneumonia, acute pancreatitis
  as well as during an acute Crohn''s disease relapse. This leads to energy-depleted,
  hypoxic or even ischemic tissue. Cells within this tissue display a modified outer
  cell membrane: Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is converted into lyso-phosphatidylcholine
  (LPC) by phospholipase (sPLA2 IIa). Due to the lack of energy, this alteration cannot
  be reversed. CRP subsequently binds to LPC on anaerobic cells and recruits complement
  factors (C1q-C4), activating the classical complement pathway. These opsonized cells
  will be disposed by phagocytes, which in turn induce CRP synthesis by secretion
  of IL-6. CRP also binds Factor H, which inhibits the alternative complement pathway
  and actually protects healthy host cells from disposal (, , ). Although CRP is drawn
  pentameric, it should be noted that after binding to ischemic cells, the recruitment
  of C1q and particularly FH is potentially carried out by dissociated, monomeric
  CRP. Figure adapted from (). AMI, Acute Myocardial Infarction; CRP, C-reactive protein;
  C1q, Complement component 1q; C2-C4(a/b), Complement component 2-4(a/b); FH, Factor
