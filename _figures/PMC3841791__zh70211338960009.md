caption: Predicted upstream regulators inhibited in DA rats but activated in congenics.
  LIPE and LXR pathway (A), p53 (TP53) (B), and Agtr2 (valsartan) (C) blockade were
  considered as activated in congenics but inhibited in DA, suggesting that increased
  LXR and p53 expression and activity and reduced Agtr2 activity in congenics are
  important to maintaining an inflammation-free synovial tissue. Orange lines with
  arrows indicate effect that increases expression or activity, while blue lines with
  vertical dash indicate an effect that decreases expression or activity. Green line
  and a combination of arrow plus dash indicate mixed activity or activity that, based
  on the literature, varies according to experimental conditions.
