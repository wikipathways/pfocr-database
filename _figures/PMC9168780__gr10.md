caption: 'The various roles of H2S in the stimulation of cells signaling in cancer
  cells. H2S can stimulate the PI3K/Akt pathway through: (a) stimulation of Akt via
  induction of the phosphorylation of its active site (Ser493) (probably via the activation
  of intermediary kinases); (b) inhibition of Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN)
  - an essential counterregulatory enzyme of the PI3K pathway - via sulfhydration
  of Cys124 or Cys71 and (c) inhibition of the activity of PTP1B (another counterregulatory
  enzyme in the PI3K pathway) via sulfhydration at Cys215 (Pathway #1). All of these
  actions result in increased PIP3 levels. H2S can stimulate ERK1/2 pathway through:
  ERK1/2 phosphorylation; RAF phosphorylation that, in turn, can phosphorylate MEK1;
  sulfhydration of MEK1 (at Cys341). MEK1 activation, in turn, leads to the phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 and translocation of ERK1/2 into the nucleus to stimulate ERK1/2 mediated
  downstream signaling; KATP channels opening and PKC activation resulting in downstream
  ERK1/2 activation (Pathway #2). H2S can stimulate mTOR pathway through: mTOR phosphorylation;
  AMPK phosphorylation via sulfhydration of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) leading to phosphorylation
  at Ser428 and/or to the activation of calcium/calmodulin-activated protein kinase
  2 (CaMKK2), the phosphorylate AMPK can, in turn, phosphorylate mTOR resulting in
  downstream mTOR activation (Pathway #3). The PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 and mTOR pathways
  activation result in the activation of both proliferative and cytoprotective downstream
  pathways.'
