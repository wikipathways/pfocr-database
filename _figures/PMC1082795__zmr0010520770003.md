caption: “Matrix” pathway resulting from the coexpression of carotenoid biosynthetic
  enzymes with broad specificity. Coexpression in E. coli of CrtW [β,β-carotene 4,(4′)-ketolase]
  and CrtZ [β,β-carotene 3,(3′)-hydroxylase] from “Agrobacterium aurantiacum” (current
  designation, Paracoccus sp. strain MBIC1143) along with the genes for β,β-carotene
  synthesis from E. uredovora (current approved name, Pantoea ananatis) resulted in
  the biosynthesis of at least nine different β,β-carotene derivatives (). This figure
  was made using data from reference .
