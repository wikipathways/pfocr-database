caption: The Ferroptosis Signalling Pathway. Extracellular Fe3+ binds to transferrin
  (Tf) and crosses cells via transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). Within endosomes, Fe3+
  is released from Tf and subsequently reduced to Fe2+ by six‐transmembrane epithelial
  antigen of prostate (STEAP3). Fe2+ is then transported into cytoplasmic labile iron
  pool (LIP) via divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). The vital but toxic Fe2+, when
  excessive, is oxidised and stored as Fe3+ by ferritin. Nuclear receptor coactivator
  4 (NCOA4) binds to ferritin and aids in its transport to the autophagosome for subsequent
  degradation, a process termed ferritinophagy. The export of intracellular Fe2+ into
  the extracellular space is mediated by ferroportin (FPN). Extensive production of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be induced through the Fenton reaction, due to
  the redox ability of iron and stimulation of iron‐containing enzymes, such as lipoxygenases
  (LOXs). These abundant ROS cause damage to cell membranes, primarily through polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFAs) containing carbon–carbon double bonds. PUFAs are esterified
  into PUFAs‐CoA under the action of long‐chain‐fatty‐acid—CoA ligase 4 (ACSL4), and
  then converted to PUFAs‐PL. PUFAs‐PL is oxidised to the lipid peroxide PUFAs‐PL‐OOH
  under the action of ROS and deposited. Multiple antioxidant defence systems were
  identified, including Xc‐/GSH/GPX4, FSP‐CoQ10‐NADPH and GCH1‐BH4‐DHFR. The xc‐system
  transfers equivalent cystine and glutamate into and out of cells, respectively,
  via SLC3A2 and SLC7A11 complex transporters. Cystine is then converted to cysteine
  and finally to GSH. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which converts lipid hydroperoxides
  (LOOH) into the non‐toxic lipid alcohols (LOH) by oxidising reduced glutathione
  (GSH) to oxidised glutathione (GSSG), leading to decreased PUFAs‐PL‐OOH to minimise
  cytotoxicity to the cells. Independent of GPX4, the FSP1‐CoQ10‐NADPH pathway defends
  against oxidation by taking advantage of ubiquinol (CoQ10H2), the reduced form of
  coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), to sequester lipid peroxides as a lipophilic radical‐trapping
  antioxidant (RTA). The GCH1‐BH4‐DHFR pathway features the potent RTA tetrahydrobiopterin
  (BH4), with GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) as the rate‐limiting enzyme for BH4 biosynthesis
  and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) as the enzyme required for BH4 regeneration
