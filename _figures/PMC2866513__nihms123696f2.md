caption: A double-stranded (ds) RNA molecule is targeted by a DICER_LIKE protein (DCL)
  with assistance from a dsRNA binding protein (DRB), and cleaved (indicated by scissors)
  into 21-24-nt siRNAs with the signature 2-nt overhang (short staggered duplex arrows).
  Addition of methyl groups (CH3) to the ends of the siRNA is performed by HEN1, siRNAs
  that are not methylated end up polyuridylated and degraded (curved white arrow)
  by the exosome. The methylated siRNA is recognized by the RISC-AGO holocomplex and
  one of the siRNA strands is incorporated into the complex (short white arrow). The
  programmed RISC targets the cognate mRNA (thick blue arrow) and hydrolyzes it (scissors)
  at a central location on the siRNA sequence. The cleaved products are either used
  as templates for siRNA amplification (curved blue arrow) or they are degraded by
  the XRN4 5’-3’ exonuclease; blue lines without arrows indicate RNA remnants. The
  amplification cycle requires the activity of RDR, SDE3, SGS3, DCL-DRB and AGO (in
  RISC). This amplified siRNA then presumably serves as a silencing signal. For each
  step a list of suppressors (brown characters) that interfere with silencing is provided
  in brackets (see text for details on origin and function); FIERY1 represents an
  endogenous suppressors. A group of viral (and the host rgs-CAM) suppressors for
  which other than RNA binding a specific function has not yet been precisely identified,
  is listed at the very right. Also is indicated that viral siRNAs can be used to
  program RISC against host RNA.
