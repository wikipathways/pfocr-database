caption: Typical non-RTKs activated signaling cascades. In addition to the conserved
  kinase domain, non-RTKs also have a variable number of protein domains (e.g., SH2
  or SH3 domains responsible for binding to other signaling molecules). Typical non-RTKs
  consist of the Src family (including Src, Fyn, Lyn, Lck), the Abelson tyrosine kinase
  (Abl) family (including Abl1, Abl2), and the Janus kinase (JAK) family (including
  JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2). The Src-mediated Ras-Raf-MEK pathway leads to transcriptional
  regulation in the nucleus, impacting cellular functions. Simultaneously, Fyn activates
  cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which modifies tau protein to facilitate microtubule
  remodeling. The activation of the JAK-STAT pathway allows STATs to translocate to
  the nucleus and directly regulate gene transcription. The regulation of non-RTK
  signal transduction pathways is closely related to synaptic function remodeling,
  neuronal excitability regulation, immune regulation, cell proliferation, etc. This
