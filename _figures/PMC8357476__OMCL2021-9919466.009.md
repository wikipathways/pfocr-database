caption: H2O2 can induce the expression of apoptotic protein Bax and inhibit the phosphorylation
  of PI3K/Akt by increasing the content of ROS, while LEO can promote the phosphorylation
  of PI3K/Akt and further promote the expression of eNOS, thus promoting the survival,
  proliferation, migration, and NO release of endothelial cells. At the same time,
  phosphorylated-Akt can also inhibit the expression of apoptotic proteins such as
  Bcl2 and Bax, thus inhibiting endothelial cell apoptosis induced by ROS. “←” indicates
  activation, and “⟝” indicates inhibition.
