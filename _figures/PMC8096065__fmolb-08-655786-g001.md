caption: Sources of DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR) network. (A) DNA damage
  repair choices. Small base alterations could be recognized and corrected through
  base excision repair (BER) pathway; longer base damages that disturb DNA-helix structure,
  such as bulky DNA adducts, are repaired through the nucleotide excision repair (NER)
  pathway; for double –strand breaks (DSBs) repair, homologous recombination (HR)
  and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) are two main repair mechanisms. (B) DNA tolerance
  pathway. Following persistent genotoxic stress, cells allow temporary DNA replication
  in the presence of unrepaired templates. Monoubiquitinated proliferating cell nuclear
  antigen (PCNA) facilitates translesion synthesis (TLS) while polyubiquitinated PCNA
  associates template switching (TS). Apart from Polζ-mediated TLS is an error-prone
  process, Polη-mediated TLS and TS are error-free processes (modified from reference
  ). Image created with BioRender.
