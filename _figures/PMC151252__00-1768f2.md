caption: Model of the Ethylene Signal Transduction Pathway.There are five ethylene
  receptors in Arabidopsis, ETR1, ETR2, EIN4, ERS1, and ERS2. ETR1 and ERS1 contain
  three transmembrane domains and a conserved histidine kinase domain, and have been
  shown to function as homodimers. ETR2, EIN4, and ERS2 have four membrane-spanning
  regions and a degenerate histidine kinase domain. Only ETR1, ETR2, and EIN4 have
  receiver domains at their C termini. Ethylene binding occurs at the N-terminal transmembrane
  domain of the receptors, and a copper co-factor is required for the binding. RAN1,
  a copper transporter, is involved in delivery of copper to the ethylene receptor.
  In the absence of an ethylene signal, ethylene receptors activate a Raf-like kinase,
  CTR1, and CTR1 in turn negatively regulates the downstream ethylene response pathway,
  possibly through a MAP-kinase cascade. Binding of ethylene inactivates the receptors,
  resulting in deactivation of CTR1, which allows EIN2 to function as a positive regulator
  of the ethylene pathway. EIN2 contains the N-terminal hydrophobic domain similar
  to the Nramp metal transporter proteins and the novel hydrophilic C terminus. EIN2
  positively signals downstream to the EIN3 family of transcription factors located
  in the nucleus. EIN3 binds to the promoter of ERF1 gene and activates its transcription
  in an ethylene-dependent manner. Transcription factors ERF1 and other EREBPs can
  interact with the GCC box in the promoter of target genes and activate downstream
  ethylene responses.
