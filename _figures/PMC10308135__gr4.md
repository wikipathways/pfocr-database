caption: Role of LOX in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. The left panel indicates
  the regulatory mechanism of LOX in vascular remodeling. Generally, LOX promotes
  vascular remodeling via VSMCs migration, ECs dysfunction and ECM reorganization.
  In the aspect of VSMCs migration, LOX binds to substrates and induces H2O2-dependent
  microfilament reorganization and focal adhesion assembly which is consistent with
  the induction of the chemotactic response. Furthermore, LOX activity is essential
  to generate optimal chemotactic sensitivity of cells to chemoattractants by oxidizing
  specific cell surface proteins, such as PDGFR-β. In addition, LOX is affected by
  various stimuli in vascular disorders and may bind to certain substrates or interfere
  with cellular signaling and thus impair endothelial homeostasis. As for the reorganization
  of ECM, H2O2 produced by LOX is associated with oxidative stress that promotes p38MAPK
  activation, elastin structural alterations and vascular stiffness. The right panel
  shows the regulatory role of LOX in angiogenesis. We propose that LOX promotes angiogenesis
  through ECM-dependent or ECM-independent manner. In the ECM-dependent way, LOX is
  able to transmit signals into the cell via integrin β1 through matrix stiffness
  caused by ECM crosslinking to activate and transfer YAP to the nucleus by increasing
  p-PXN of FAK, thus upregulating target gene expression such as CD34, VEGFR2, DLL4,
  CXCR4, EFNB2 and IGF2, and promoting tip cell formation. ECM crosslinking can also
  activate the PI3K/Akt pathway and up-regulate VEGF expression. Furthermore, LOX
  can activate the integrin β1-PYK2 pathway and then promote the release of SPP1 which
  can stimulate angiogenesis. On the other hand, LOX activates Akt through PDGFR-β
  stimulation, resulting in increased VEGF expression, which is ECM-independent. Akt,
