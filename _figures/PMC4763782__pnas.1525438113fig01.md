caption: Generation of chemical diversity by cyanobactin pathways. (A) Biosynthesis
  of cyanobactins by the tru pathway. The relationship between the precursor peptide
  recognition sequence and the relevant enzyme is shown by color. For example, the
  TruA protease recognition sequence is shown in blue. “X” indicates regions that
  can be highly variable. Because these elements are progressively cleaved during
  biosynthesis, the substrate for each ensuing enzymatic step is progressively different
  in structure (). (B) Representative natural coral reef compounds produced in this
  study.
