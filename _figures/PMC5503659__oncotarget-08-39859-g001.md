caption: UCA1, PRNCR1 and CCAL could regulate the apoptosis pathway in CRC. High expression
  levels of PVT-1 response to 8q24 copy-number gain inhibited apoptosis pathway. Low
  expression levels of Loc554202 inhibited apoptosis pathway by down-regulation of
  Bcl-2. DQ786243 down-regulated Bcl-2 expression and led cell cycle arrest, leading
  to repressing apoptosis pathway. GHE1, GAS5 and AFAP1-AS1 influenced apoptosis by
  regulating cell cycle progression. HOTTIP modified apoptosis pathway and cell cycle
  progression by inducing expression of p21. BANCR, regulated by Est-1 mildly effected
  proliferation by promoting G1 arrest and causing p21 mediated- apoptosis. lincRNA-p21
  regulates the G1/S the checkpoint and proliferation by promoting p53-dependent transcription
  of p21. ZFAS1 may influence cell cycle progress and inhibit apoptosis via destabilization
  of p53
