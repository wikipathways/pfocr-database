caption: Main mechanisms involved in the development of hepatocarcinoma. The chronic
  exposure of hepatoxic agents causes the activation of the signaling pathways. YAZ-HIPPO
  receptors regulate the YAZ/TAZ transcriptional dimer genes involved in increased
  cell proliferation, mesenchymal epithelial transition, and metastasis. On the other
  hand, WNT/AXIN regulates the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus, forming
  the YAZ/TAZ-β-catenin-TCF trimer activating profibrotic factors such as TGF-β and
  proliferative factors such as C-Myc, contributing to tumorigenesis and metastasis
  and inducing resistance to anticancer drugs. Similarly, NF−κB signaling pathway
  and the dimers IKK-α and IKK-β induce differential translocation of NF−κB P50/P65;
  on the one hand, an increase of P65 is induced to the nucleus while p50 is not translocated,
  causing an increase in cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, transformation
  of malignant cells, and contributing to drug resistance. Finally, PPARγ bound to
  its ligands has a dual effect, inhibiting the signaling pathway of β-catenin and
  NF-κB, but by binding to the PPRE region it can increase the expression of genes
  involved in apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and metastasis. Acetylation
  and methylation of histones, regulated by the HATs/HDACs and HMTs/HDMs balance and
  DNA methylation regulated by DNMT1 activity, are the main epigenetic marks associated
  with tumorigenesis.
