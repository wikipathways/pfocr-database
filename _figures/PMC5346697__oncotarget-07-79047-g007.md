caption: The diagram depicts autophagy-mediated inhibition of Notch1 signaling. The
  canonical Notch1 signaling pathway is initiated when the ligand in intact cells
  binds to the Notch1 receptor. Then, Notch1 is cleaved by γ-secretase forming Notch1-IC,
  which translocates into the nucleus. The Notch1-IC acts as a transcription factor
  promoting Notch1-IC target gene expression. Under nutrient-deprivation condition,
  Notch1-IC in the nucleus is phosphorylated by MEKK1 at the T2512 residue, ubiquitinated
  by Fbw7 and translocalized to the cytosol. Then, p62 binds to and forms aggregates
  with the ubiquitinated Notch1-IC. LC3 binds to p62 and leads to the formation of
  the autophagosome. Lysosomes combine with the autophagosome and then Notch1-IC is
  degraded.
