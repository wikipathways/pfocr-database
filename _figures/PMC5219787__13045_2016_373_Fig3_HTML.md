caption: 'Wnt signaling pathway. a In the absence of the Wnt glycoprotein, β-catenin
  is degraded after being ubiquitinated and phosphorylated by the destruction complex.
  Target genes in the nucleus are not activated. b In the presence of Wnt, the glycoprotein
  binds to the extracellular transmembrane Frizzled receptor family (Fz and LRP5/6).
  Thereafter, the signal activates the protein Dishevelled (Dsh/DV1) in the cytoplasm.
  This binding results in disrupting the β-catenin destruction complex of various
  proteins including: axin, casein kinase 1α, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), protein
  phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK–3β). β-catenin translocates
  to nucleus where it can act as transcriptional coactivator of transcription factors
  of TCF/LEF family. Resveratrol and apigenin decrease protein expression of β-catenin'
