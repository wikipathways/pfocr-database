caption: Proposed model for the role INPP5E plays at cilia. PI(4,5)P2 (pink hexagons)
  and PI(3,4,5)P3 signals (blue hexagons) localize to the cilia TZ. Protein scaffolds,
  including TMEM231, TCTN1, MKS1, and B9D1, localize to the TZ. In the absence of
  Hh pathway activation (−SAG), GPR161 levels at the cilia axoneme are increased in
  Inpp5e−/− pMEFs (; ). After Hh pathway activation (+SAG) of wild-type pMEFs, PI(4,5)P2
  signals decrease and PI(3,4,5)P3 signals increase at the TZ, and SMO accumulates
  and is retained at cilia, which is associated with the exit of GPR161 from cilia
  (). After Hh pathway activation (+SAG) of Inpp5e−/− pMEFs, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3
  signals are disproportionately increased at the TZ (compared with wild type), which
  is associated with the mislocalization of TZ components TMEM231, TCTN1, MKS1, B9D1,
  and SEPT2 (latter not depicted), leading to the reduced accumulation and retention
  of SMO at cilia and thereby increased cilia axoneme levels of GPR161. Dashed arrows
  and lines are proposed pathways. Inhibition of PI3K-generated PI(3,4,5)P3 signals
  restores the localization of TZ components to cilia in Inpp5e−/− pMEFs, suggesting
  a role for local PI3K signaling at cilia in maintaining TZ function.
