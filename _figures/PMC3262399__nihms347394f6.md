caption: Hh (from an as yet undetermined source tissue) acts through Patched (whose
  overexpression blocks sensitization), which subsequently inhibits Smoothened (required
  for sensitization) to activate signal transduction. The subsequent signaling steps
  likely involve the transcriptional activity of Cubitus interruptus (required for
  sensitization) and other components of the canonical Hh signaling pathway. For thermal
  allodynia, this pathway acts through the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel
  Painless, and for thermal hyperalgesia it requires the TRP channel dTRPA1.
