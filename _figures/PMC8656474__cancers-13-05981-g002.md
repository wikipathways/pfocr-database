caption: Among the key mechanisms described we can mainly distinguish tumor-intrinsic
  factors and factors associated to tumor microenvironment (TME). In the first subgroup
  it is important to outline the alterations of antitumor immune response pathways
  (e.g., aberrant expression of tumor antigens), variations in the antigen presentation
  pathways (e.g., β2-microglobulin mutations leading to loss of MHC) or defective
  signaling pathways (e.g., IFNγ-STAT-IRF1 signaling pathway); What is more, these
  intrinsic factors promote the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment
  through the mutations of functional genes such as Wnt/β-catenin, MAPK, or PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  pathways and the modifications of the metabolism of TME (e.g., hypoxic conditions);
  The second subgroup (factors associated to TME) includes the presence of immunosuppressive
  cells (e.g., MDSCs or TAM) as well as the activation of coinhibitory receptors (e.g.,
  TIM-3, LAG-3).
