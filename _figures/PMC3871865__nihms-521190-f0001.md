caption: A. The structure of caspase family proteins and components of DISC and apoptosome.
  DED, Death effector domain; DD, Death domain; KD, Kinase domain; ID, Intermediate
  domain; RHIM, RIP homotypic interaction motif; p20, p20 subunit; p10, p10 subunit;
  CARD, Caspase activation and recruit domain; NBD, Nucleotide binding domain; LRR,
  Leucine rich repeats; PYD, Pyrin domain; NACHT, NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory
  protein), CIITA (MHC class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus
  protein from Podospora anserina) and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein) domain.B.
  The extrinsic pathway is initiated by the biding of death ligands to their cell-surface
  death receptors. The death domains of these receptors recruit adaptor molecules
  such as FADD and caspase-8. Multimerization of caspase-8 in the DISC leads to its
  activation and cleavage of the downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3. On
  the other hand, the intrinsic pathway is triggered by the release of pro-apoptotic
  proteins from the mitochondria. Released cytochrome c forms the apoptosome with
  Apaf-1 and caspase-9. Additionally, released Smac enhances caspase activation through
  the neutralization of IAP proteins. Of note, there is a cross-talk between the extrinsic
  and intrinsic pathways. Active caspase-8 cleaves the BH3-only protein Bid, which
  in turn initiates the release of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins.C. The inflammasome
  is formed in response to diverse danger signals such as ROS, ATP, amyloid-β and
  dsRNA. Activation of caspase-1 in the inflammasome leads to the cleavage of pro-ILβ
  and pro-IL18 into their mature pro-inflammatory forms and promotes their secretion.
