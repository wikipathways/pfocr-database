caption: Sensors and transducers in metabolic signaling. (A) Metabolic signaling is
  triggered by a metabolite sensor protein that directly binds to a metabolite. The
  sensor then engages transducers in a signaling pathway that eventually activate
  responses through an effector protein. (B) In mammalian models, amino acids are
  sensed directly by diverse sensor proteins that activate the mechanistic target
  of rapamycin (mTOR), a central regulatory hub that transduces diverse upstream signals
  to coordinate metabolism. mTOR then phosphorylates additional transducers and effectors,
  such as LARP1 and S6K, to promote protein synthesis and repress autophagy.
