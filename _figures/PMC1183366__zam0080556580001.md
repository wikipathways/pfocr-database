  the overproduction of genetically engineered FabH proteins and PHA synthase. 1.
  Fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. 2. FabH catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-ACP
  and acetyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-ACP. 3 and 4. FabH mediates the transacylase
  reaction. 5. PhaC catalyzes the PHA polymerization reaction. (B) The production

  of E. coli. 2. PhaJ catalyzes the conversion of enoyl-CoA to (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA.
  3. FabG catalyzes the reduction of 3-ketoacyl-CoA to (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. 4. PhaC
  catalyzes the PHA polymerization reaction.
