caption: FTO, ALKBH5 and pseudouridine synthase partial inhibitors and their inhibitory
  pathways are introduced. O6‐methylguanine‐DNA‐methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA
  repair protein. ASB2 is an ankyrin repeat containing SOCS box 2, and retinoic acid
  receptor alpha (RARA) is a retinoic acid receptor, both of which are related to
  protein stability. CEBPA is the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer‐binding protein
  α, and MYC is expressed by a class of nuclear protein oncogenes. Both are related
  to differentiation and proliferation. These inhibitors inhibit cancer progression
  by regulating related pathways
