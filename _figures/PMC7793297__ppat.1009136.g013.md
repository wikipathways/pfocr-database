caption: Our results show that the proinflammatory mediators LPS and TNFα, and antileishmanial
  drug SAG, through PI3K (p85α-p110β)-Akt signaling pathway, induce the binding of
  Runx1 and Runx3 transcription factors to the CD40 promoter and consequently upregulate
  CD40 expression on DCs. The CD40 upregulation induced by LPS or TNFα, however, is
  inhibited by normal LD (i.e., SbSLD; left panel). LD mediates this inhibitory effect
  by suppressing the PI3K (p85α-p110β)-Akt-Runx pathway through SHP-1. In contrast,
  SAG-induced CD40 upregulation on DCs remains unaffected by normal LD infection (right
  panel). This is because SAG, by blocking (directly/indirectly; indicated by dotted
  lines) LD-induced SHP-1 activation, enables the PI3K (p85α-p110β)-Akt -Runx pathway
  to upregulate CD40 expression on LD-infected DCs. The upregulated CD40 expression
  in turn augments type-1 T cell responses that confer protection against LD infection.
  Unlike normal LD (SbSLD); SbRLD, however, suppresses the PI3K-Akt-Runx pathway-mediated
  CD40 upregulation on DCs by persistently activating SHP-1 despite SAG treatment.
  Thus, acting as a critical mediator of CD40 expression in DCs, Runx proteins play
  a pivotal role in mounting antileishmanial immunity.
