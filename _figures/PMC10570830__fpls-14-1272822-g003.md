caption: Functional link among PGE limitation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the
  developmental response of etiolated seedlings. Under PGE-limited conditions (in
  the presence of rifampicin/spectinomycin) or under mitochondrial dysfunction (rpoTmp
  mutant), mitochondrial stress marker genes are induced at the transcript level.
  The expression of the nuclear stress markers is independent of the GUN1 (plastidial)
  and ANAC017 (mitochondrial) retrograde pathways in the PGE-limited conditions but
  is dependent on the ANAC017 retrograde pathway in the mitochondrial dysfunction
  condition. In mitochondrial stress conditions, the ER-localized ANAC017 proteins
  are cleaved and released for migration into the nucleus and transcriptional regulation.
  Under both plastidial and mitochondrial dysfunctional conditions, expression of
  AOX is increased at the mRNA and protein levels; consequently, the AOX-dependent
  respiratory capacity is also induced. Under PGE-limited conditions, ROS is significantly
  induced, particularly in the absence of AOX. A developmental response (twisting
  phenotype) that requires functional AOX is induced as an ultimate effect in both
  organellar dysfunction conditions. Whether the developmental response in PGE-limited
  conditions is induced directly by plastid signals or via mitochondria by AOX-generated
  signals is still a matter of investigation.
