caption: A schematic overview of the complex pathways regulating cell death. Necroptosis
  can be triggered by both extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli. The extrinsic pathway
  can be activated by chemokine, cytokine and death receptors, which leads to the
  activation of receptor interacting protein (RIP)-kinases. Similar activation is
  also achieved via intracellular stress. Subsequently, activation of the RIP-complex
  leads to phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinases (MLKL),
  which is inhibited by caspase-8 under normal circumstances. MLKL phosphorylation
  induces a translocation to the cell membrane, which leads to permeabilization of
  the cell and consequently necroptotic cells death. Senescence is predominantly induced
  via a cell cycle arrest initiated by p53, but this process can also lead to the
  senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Moreover, SASP can be induced
  via extrinsic stimuli that activate the Janus kinase- signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Intracellular stress can inhibit the mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which allows formation of the autophagosome.
  This formation can be inhibited by pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family but
  is also able to inhibit caspase cleavage and thereby displays the crosstalk between
  autophagy and apoptosis. Eventually, after formation of the autophagosome, autophagic
  cell death is induced. Additionally, apoptosis can be induced by both intrinsic
  and extrinsic stimuli. Extrinsic stimuli allow cleavage of caspase-8, which can
  either induce cleavage of the caspase3/7 complex or activate members of the pro-apoptotic
  BCL-2 family. Activation of caspase3/7 results in caspase dependent apoptosis. However,
  the BCL-2 proteins can also be activated by intrinsic stimuli or intracellular stress
  and lead to the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which in turn
  releases both cytochrome C and apoptosis inducing factors (AIF). Cytochrome C interacts
  with caspase-9 and subsequently induces caspase-dependent apoptosis via the activation
  of caspase 3/7. In contrast, AIF facilitates caspase-independent apoptosis by initiation
  of chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. This figure was created by authors
