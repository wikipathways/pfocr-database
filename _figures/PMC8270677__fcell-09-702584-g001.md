caption: Control of DNA replication origin firing. (A) Origins of replication are
  licensed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle through the sequential loading of
  the ORC and MCM complexes to form the pre-replication (pre-RC) complex. At the S-phase
  onset, S-CDK and DDK activate the replicative helicase by recruiting CDC45 and the
  GINS complex, enabling DNA unwinding and the formation of active replisomes. dNTPs
  are the essential building blocks used by the replicative DNA polymerases to elongate
  nascent DNA. (B) In normal growth conditions, firing is limited to a few licensed
  origins. Forks travel at full speed, inactivating neighboring unfired origins. Under
  conditions of low to mild RS, cells compensate for slow elongation by activating
  backup origins known as dormant origins. Under acute RS conditions, the ATR-FANCI
  pathway restrains the activation of new origins. See the text for further details.
