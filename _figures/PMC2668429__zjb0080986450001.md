caption: Proposed conceptual model for the electron transfer pathway of H2 oxidation
  by Desulfovibrio. Three classes of periplasmic hydrogenases (NiFe, NiFeSe, and Fe-only
  hydrogenases [Hase]) may be involved in H2 metabolism. The electrons (e−) generated
  from H2 oxidation in the periplasm are transferred to the cytochrome c3 (Cyc) network
  for delivery to transmembrane electron carriers (TMC) and then possibly into the
  menaquinone (MK) pool, creating reduced menaquinone (MKH2) within the inner membrane
  (IM) or directly across the inner membrane for sulfate reduction in the cytoplasm.
  The Mop complex described here may be one of these TMC. The protons generated from
  H2 oxidation in the periplasm drive ATP synthesis (by the ATP synthase), as they
  contribute directly to a proton gradient. The protons imported through ATP synthase
  are also used in the sulfate reduction pathway. H2 is either supplied externally
  or produced in the cytoplasm through organic substrate degradation.
