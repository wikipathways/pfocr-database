caption: The enzymatic activity of cytochrome P450 8B1 involves the C12α-hydroxylation
  of its steroid-based substrate, 7α-hydroxy-cholest-4-en-3-one (1) to yield 7α-,12α-dihydroxy-cholest-4-en-3-one
  (2). This pathway ultimately forms cholic acid (3). Blocking the activity of P450
  8B1 should lead to a decrease in cholic acid (3) and an increase in chenodeoxycholic
  acid (5).
