caption: A. General analysis was based on protein-protein interaction and pathway
  databases with the nucleocytoplasmic transport-related genes (1.29-fold; P,0.05).
  GeneMANIA retrieved known and predicted interactions between these genes and added
  extra genes (grey circles) that are strongly connected to query genes (dark circles).
  B. Functional gene network in normal tissue of patients with thyroid cancer. Correlation
  of the three genes, namely HIF1A, TUFT1, BHLHB2, involved in angiogenesis and response
  to hypoxya with other disregulated genes, particularly JUND.
