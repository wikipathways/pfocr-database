caption: Pathogens are one of the factors that limit lifespan in C. elegans and in
  higher organisms. Our data implies that exposure to pathogens and/or their toxins
  can directly or indirectly modulate germline proliferation and survival resulting
  in a reproductive system with less germ cells. Germline depletion induces the transcription
  of irg-7, an innate immunity-related secreted protein whose induction promotes the
  activation of a somatic defense response. On one hand, irg-7 enables the activation
  of bona-fida longevity-associated transcription factors, which support the induction
  of a longevity-promoting transcriptome. At the same time, irg-7 enables the activation
  of atf-7, a dedicated innate immunity-related transcription factor. In this way,
  exposure to pathogens can be sensed by perturbations in germline homeostasis. Consequently,
  the reproductive system can serve as a signaling center to divert key metabolic
  resources towards defending against the putative pathogen attack by activating the
  innate immune response.
