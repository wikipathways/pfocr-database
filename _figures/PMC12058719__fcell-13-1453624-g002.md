caption: Mechanism of osteoporosis (OP) regulation by protein arginine methyltransferases
  (PRMTs) (A)PRMT1 influences bone formation and resorption through the BMP2/Smad
  and other pathways, thereby mitigating OP. (B) PRMT3 enhances the expression of
  miR-3648 by increasing H4R3me2a levels in the gene promoter region, promoting osteogenic
  differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. (C) PRMT4 inhibits osteoclast differentiation
  and delays cellular ageing by enhancing glucose metabolism and glycolysis flux during
  osteogenic differentiation. (D) PRMT5 maintains homeostasis in mesenchymal stem
  cells and regulates their differentiation into osteoblasts and osteoclasts by catalysing
  histone methylation modifications. (E) ALKBH5 accelerates the degradation of PRMT6
  mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner, with the ALKBH5-PRMT6 axis regulating MSC osteogenesis
  primarily through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. (F) PRMT7 positively regulates
  the BMP signalling pathway by interacting with BMPR type I receptors, leading to
  arginine methylation of the receptor and promoting osteogenic differentiation of
  bone marrow stromal cells
