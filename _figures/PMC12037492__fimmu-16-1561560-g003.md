caption: Mechanism via which TYMP modifies epigenetic and resists apoptosis TYMP catalyzes
  the conversion of thymidine to thymine and 2DDR, which binds to integrin αVβ3/α5β1
  on progenitor cells, thereby activating the PI3K pathway. Once activated, PI3K promotes
  the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3, leading to the phosphorylation of Akt via PDK1 and
  mTORC2, completing Akt activation. Activated Akt inhibits FOXO, a key initiator
  of apoptosis, thereby promoting cell survival. Additionally, Akt can enhance tumor
  growth by suppressing the expression of tumor suppressor proteins P21 and P27. Furthermore,
  Akt acts on the MDM2 oncoprotein, negatively regulating the p53 tumor suppressor,
  thus resisting apoptosis and promoting tumor cell survival. Activated Akt also upregulates
  the expression of DNMT3A, leading to the hypermethylation of key genes such as RUNX2,
  osterix, and IRF8
