caption: Monolignol metabolism in flax stems. A, Different possible metabolic pathways
  of monolignols in flax stems (coniferyl alcohol is used as an example). Monolignols
  may be converted into phenoxy radicals in the cell wall by laccases and/or peroxidases
  and then undergo nonenzymatic polymerization to form lignin oligomers and lignin
  (pathway 1). Monolignols may also be converted into phenoxy radicals by laccases
  and/or peroxidases before being dimerized to form (neo)lignans (pathway 2). Monolignols
  can also be glycosylated by glycosyltransferases and then further complexed with
  other monolignols via an as yet uncharacterized pathway (pathway 3). Lignin oligomers
  and (neo)lignans may also be glycosylated (pathway 4). Orange/green shading in A
  and B (column 2) indicate the relative ratios of different monolignol compounds
  in flax stem inner and outer tissues (orange shading = compounds present in higher
  amounts in inner stem tissues, and green shading = compounds present in higher amounts
  in outer stem tissues). POD, Peroxidase. B, Relative ratios of H-, G-, and S-unit
  compounds in stem inner tissues (column 3) and outer tissues (column 4). The supposed
  subcellular localization of the different compounds is shown in column 5. G* indicates
  that p-coumaryl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol were not detected in either inner or
  outer stem tissues. [See online article for color version of this figure.]
