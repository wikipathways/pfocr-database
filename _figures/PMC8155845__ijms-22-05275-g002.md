caption: 'Mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid signaling in renal principal cell during
  the perinatal period. MR signaling pathway is ineffective during renal development
  due to the down-regulation of MR expression. Given that renal 11βHSD2 is not expressed
  during this specific perinatal period, the GR signaling pathway is therefore functional.
  In the nucleus, the GR can bind specific sequences called Glucocorticoid Response
  Elements (GREs). Binding to the GRE activates the recruitment of chromatin-remodeling
  complexes and coregulators. Negative GRE (nGRE) were also reported, which are responsible
  for trans-repression of the target genes through the binding of GR monomers. Binding
  to nGRE prevents the dimerization and allows for the recruitment of corepressors,
  thus preventing the transcription of target genes. GR can also mediate trans-repression
  of target genes by tethering via interactions with other transcription factors as
  NFκB or AP-1 without direct binding to DNA. GR: Glucocorticoid Receptor; GRE: Glucocorticoid
  Response Element; GILZ: Glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper; SGK1: Serum and Glucocorticoid-Regulated
  kinase 1; PER 1: clock gene period 1; TM: Transcriptional Machinery.'
