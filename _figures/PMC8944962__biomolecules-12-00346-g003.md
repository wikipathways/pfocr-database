caption: The leukotriene biosynthesis and signaling pathway. Leukotrienes derive from
  arachidonic acid, which is cleaved from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2) and further processed by the key enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-Lox) and its
  activator, 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP). The intermediate product 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid (5-HPETE) gives rise to leukotriene A4 (LTA4), which is further converted to
  leukotriene B4 (LTB4) by leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) or to the cysteinyl leukotrienes
  leukotriene C4, D4 and E4 (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4) by leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S).
  Leukotrienes evoke inflammatory responses by binding with different affinities to
  specific receptors on target cells. These include the leukotriene B4 receptor (BLTR),
  the G-protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17), the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1
  (CysLT1R) and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLT2R). Created with BioRender.com
