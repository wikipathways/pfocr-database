caption: Graphical abstract of the TRAP1 pathway. TRAP1 is transcribed by HSF1, which
  is deactivated by the HSP90 complex. PINK1 phosphorylation can activate TRAP1, whereas
  GzmM can cleave TRAP1, thereby hindering TRAP1 activity. Downstream of TRAP1, multiple
  pathways can influence mitochondrial function and cellular viability. FLTR:TRAP1
  interactor PHB2 is inhibited, reducing mitophagy. Stalk construction can be mediated
  through TNFR1, via STAT3 phosphorylation, activation of transcription factor E2F1,
  which transcribes N-cadherin responsible for calcium regulation and cell adhesion.
  Through inhibition of CypD, TRAP1 can prevent mitochondrial pore opening and release
  of Cyt c to the cytosol, which is critical in the prevention of apoptosis. TRAP1
  can influence calcium regulation through Sorcin, which is essential to keep the
  mitochondrial pores close. By inhibiting c-Scr, TRAP1 acts as a metabolic switch,
  which results in less ROS production. In association with TBP7 on the ER, TRAP1
  can influence calcium regulation between the mitochondria and ER. Together with
  HSP90, TRAP1 is involved in inhibition of the unfolded protein response and promoting
  cell survival. Figure made with BioRender.
