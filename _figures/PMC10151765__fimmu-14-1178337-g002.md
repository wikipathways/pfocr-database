caption: Comparison of the Death Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) and the complex
  formed during differentiation of monocytes (NADIC). During induction of extrinsic
  apoptosis, caspase-8 interacts with a death receptor (FAS, TRAIL) and FADD to form
  the DISC (Death-inducing signaling complex) at the cell membrane. The FLIP protein
  may also be present in the DISC to inhibit caspase-8 activity. Activation of caspase-8
  leads to the cleavage of caspases-3 and -7 and then to the cleavage of numerous
  substrate proteins, ultimately inducing apoptosis of the cell. During the differentiation
  of monocytes into macrophages, CSF1R triggering leads to the activation of the AKT
  pathway, which is involved in the formation of an intracellular multimolecular complex
  including caspase-8, FLIP, FADD and RIP1 called non-apoptotic differentiation-inducing
  complex (NADIC). Within this complex, caspase-8 is activated and then cleaves caspases-3
  and -7 to allow the cleavage of substrate proteins that are required for differentiation
  of monocytes into macrophages.
