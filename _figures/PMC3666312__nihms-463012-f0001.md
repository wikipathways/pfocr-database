caption: 'Signal 1 results from MHC–antigen recognition through the T-cell receptor–CD3
  complex, a process blocked by anti-CD3 mAbs and indirectly by rituximab. Signal
  2 results in costimulation, a process that can be blocked by belatacept. Costimulation
  activates downstream signaling pathways, resulting in calcineurin activation, a
  stage that can be inhibited by tacrolimus and cyclosporine A. Activated calcineurin
  dephosphorylates NF-AT, allowing IL-2 transcription to initiate signal 3. IL-2 receptor
  stimulation, a step that can be blocked by basiliximab, activates the mTOR signaling
  cascade, which can be inhibited by sirolimus. This pathway induces the T cell to
  enter the cell cycle and proliferate, which in turn can be blocked by methotrexate,
  mycophenolate and azathioprine. rATG exerts polyclonal effects while alemtuzumab
  binds to CD52, both resulting in immunodepletion. mAb: Monoclonal antibody; NF-AT:
  Nuclear factor of activated T cell; rATG: Rabbit antithymocyte globulin.'
