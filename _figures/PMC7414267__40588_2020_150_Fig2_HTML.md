caption: Pro-viral and antiviral roles of TRIM6. a TRIM6 facilities the ubiquitination
  (white circles with Ub) of Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 at lysine residue 309 (K309).
  This ubiquitination at K309 augments the EBOV VP35’s polymerase co-factor activity
  in the presence of TRIM6. b Upon virus infection, viral RNA in the cytoplasm triggers
  the activation of RIG-I-like receptors, including RIG-I and MDA-5, to trigger downstream
  type-I interferon (IFN-I) induction. TRIMs 6 and 25 both participate in the IFN-I
  pathway. TRIM6 promotes the synthesis of unanchored K48-linked polyubiquitin chains
  which act as a scaffold for IKKɛ oligomerization promoting its kinase activity and
  downstream functions in IFN-I induction and signaling, and TRIM6 regulates that
  expression of a vesicle-associated protein, VAMP8, which has been shown to promote
  JAK1 phosphorylation downstream of IFN-I signaling. TRIM25 facilities the covalent
  conjugation of K63-linked polyubiquitin to RIG-I to promote RIG-I’s activity. The
  viral antagonism (red arrows) of these TRIMs’ function has been described for EBOV
  VP35 and Nipah virus (NiV) accessory protein V (V) and matrix protein (M). In addition
  to the antagonism of TRIMs, these viral proteins also target additional steps of
  the IFN-I pathways, including NiV-V antagonism of MDA5 and STAT1 and EBOV antagonism
  of IKKɛ- and TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of IRF3
