caption: Using metabolic chemical reporters (MCRs) to detect cellular metabolism.
  (a) Salvaged N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) can enter a linear biosynthetic pathway
  that yields UDP-GlcNAc that can be directly incorporated onto glycoproteins. Additionally,
  GlcNAc metabolic intermediates can enter branching pathways to generate acetate
  and other monosaccharides. (b) MCRs have the potential to isolate branching metabolic
  pathways, such as the transformation of GlcNAc into acetate and subsequent acetylation
  of proteins.
