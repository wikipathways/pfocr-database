caption: Mitochondria-derived signaling pathways controlling muscle mass. Mitochondrial
  network accumulates damage when the mitochondrial quality control mechanisms are
  impaired. ROS produced by the defective organelles induces muscle atrophy through
  the activation of the JNK-FoxO signaling pathway and of ER stress. Moreover, the
  release of dangerous factors such as AIF, cytochrome c and ROS can induce apoptosis
  and/or necroptosis. The activation of the energy sensor AMPK by an increase in the
  AMP/ATP ratio inhibits mTOR and directly phosphorylates FoxO3 (Ser413 and Ser588)
  increasing its transcriptional activity, affecting muscle mass. The dashed line
  indicates a mechanism that needs more studies.
