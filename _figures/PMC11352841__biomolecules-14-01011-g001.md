caption: Bacterial induced mastitis via activating TLR2/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways
  in mammary gland cells. The activation of Myeloid differentiation primary response
  88 (MyD88)-dependent signal transduction initiates the recruitment of IRAK1/4 and
  TRAF6, subsequently leading to the activation of the TAK1-IKK complex. This complex
  then triggers the activation of NF-κB. In the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, specific
  subsets of the TNFR superfamily interact with their ligands, resulting in the recruitment
  of TRAF2/3. Following the ubiquitination and degradation of TRAF3, NF-κB-inducing
  kinase (NIK) accumulates in the cytoplasm and associates with IKKα, promoting the
  phosphorylation of p100
