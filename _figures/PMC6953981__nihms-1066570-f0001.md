caption: Administered small molecules can manipulate Ss-DAF-12 signaling to suppress
  infection and autoinfection by S. stercoralis. a Under natural conditions in nematode
  development, insulin-like signaling, along with TGFβ-like signaling, upregulates
  biosynthesis of dafachronic acids from dietary cholesterol. In C. elegans, the DAF-9
  cytochrome P450 (CYP) catalyzes the final oxidative step in this biosynthetic pathway
  [, ]. DAF-12 signaling is conserved in parasitic nematodes, including S. stercoralis
  [], and previous findings indicate that the cytochrome P450 inhibitor ketoconazole
  can block developmental activation of infective third-stage larvae (iL3) of S. stercoralis
  under host-like culture conditions and that this effect is partially reversed by
  the DAF-12 ligand Δ7-dafachronic acid []. This finding underscores the potential
  of CYP function in DAF-12 signaling as a chemotherapeutic target in blocking the
  infectious process by S. stercoralis. b Shutdown of insulin- and TGFβ-like signaling
  in C. elegans downregulates dafachronic acid biosynthesis, and in its unliganded
  state, DAF-12 downregulates dauer formation and upregulates continuous development
  [, ]. Likewise, in Strongyloides spp., administration of Δ7-dafachronic acid suppresses
  iL3 morphogenesis and promotes formation of second-generation free-living larvae
  and adults [, ]. Significantly, administering Δ7-dafachronic acid orally to NSG
  mice undergoing autoinfection with S. stercoralis also suppresses morphogenesis
  of autoinfective L3 [], underscoring the potential of Ss-DAF-12 signaling as a chemotherapeutic
  target in potentially fatal disseminated hyperinfection in human strongyloidiasis
