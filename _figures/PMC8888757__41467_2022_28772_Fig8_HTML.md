caption: a In resting conditions, ADAP1 is largely localized to the cytosol, HIV-1
  is in a latent state and T cell programs are quiescent. b Upon stimulation (TCR/CD28),
  ADAP1 is re-localized to the cell membrane where it interacts with immune signalosome
  proteins including PKCθ and signal transducer protein KRAS, stimulating the MAPK
  pathway including KRAS–ERK–AP-1 (Fos/Jun). Activated AP-1 binds cis-elements on
  the HIV-1 genome inducing reactivation from latency. For T cell genes, ADAP1-induced
  AP-1 bind cis-elements of genes required for T cell programs, including genes that
  require NFAT:AP-1 cooperativity.

  T cell signaling-transcriptional axis.
