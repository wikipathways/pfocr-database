caption: 'Hypothesized model of the interrelationships impacting the offspring of
  diabetic mothers. The role of epigenetics in observed lipid pathway impairments
  is currently unknown with regard to DHA transfer, although the expression of key
  mediators involved in maternal–fetal lipid transfer has been reported. In diabetic
  pregnancies, alterations in the metabolic processing of free and/or esterified fatty
  acids are likely to be involved in the reduced availability of DHA to the fetus.
  Abbreviations: DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; EL, endothelial lipase; FA, fatty acid;
  GD, gestational diabetes; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor; TG, triglyceride.'
