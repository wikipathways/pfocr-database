caption: Proposed model for activation of the ALT pathway. Mutation of IDH1 R132H
  leads to accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which leads to inhibition of multiple
  enzymes with functions in both DNA and histone methylation. This has been linked
  to decreases in expression of XRCC1 and RAP1. Loss of XRCC1 prevents formation of
  telomeric fusions in ALT cancer cells, whereas loss of RAP1 disrupts Shelterin,
  potentially leading to the formation of DNA secondary structures on telomeric DNA
  such as G-loops. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species has also been linked
  to ALT cancers and the formation of telomeric R-loops. Upon stalling at a replication
  barrier, replication forks are reversed/regressed. Fork regression is mediated by
  RAD51 and other DNA translocases, including SMARCAL1, ZRANB3 and HTLF. In the presence
  of ATRX/DAXX, forks are stabilized and restarted through interaction of ATRX with
  FANCD2 and CTIP. In the absence of ATRX, reversed forks undergo excessive MRE11-dependent
  degradation and cleavage by the MUS81 nucleases, leading to the formation of one-ended
  telomeric DSBs. Damage-induced MMS21-mediated SUMOylation of telomere proteins results
  in BLM-dependent PML recruitment to telomeres and triggers APB formation through
  SUMO/SIM-mediated LLPS. PCNA-RFC-Polδ-mediated BIR then occurs between clustered
  telomeres within the APB in a process that is promoted by BTR complex (BLM, TOP3A,
  RMI1 and RMI2) and inhibited by SLX4. Strand invasion is out of register, owing
  to ATRX loss, leading to telomere lengthening through conservative replication.
