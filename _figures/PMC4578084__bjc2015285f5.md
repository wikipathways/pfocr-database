caption: Suggested mechanism of action by WISP-2 in gastric cancer cells. In cells
  in which WISP2 is well expressed (possibly induced by Wnt proteins), it acts as
  an inhibitory mechanism to the ERK/JNK pathway and the PLC-γ pathway, thus preventing,
  to some degree, the activation of transcription event for EMT regulating proteins
  and MMPs. However, in cells where WISP-2 is reduced/lost, the ERK/JNK pathway is
  activated, leading to the transcription activation of EMT transcription factors
  including Twist and Slug. This leads to the reduction of E-cadherin and molecules
  leading to EMT. Similarly, PLC-γ and JNK activations lead to the activation of MMP
  synthesis. These two pathways collectively contribute to the increase in cellular
  migration and tissue invasion. Dash lines indicate where gaps exist and require
  further work.
