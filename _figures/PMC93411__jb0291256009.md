caption: Genetic pathway required for growth phase-dependent regulation of RpoS degradation.
  LrhA is the most upstream component and somehow functions to modulate SprE activity.
  The phosphorylated form of SprE promotes degradation of RpoS by the ClpXP protease,
  probably in response to nutrient limitation. Then, RpoS, functioning as a sigma
  factor, is able to recruit RNAP to a subset of stationary-phase-inducible promoters
  and thereby acts as a global regulatory protein required for the physiological adaptations
  characteristic of stationary-phase bacteria.
