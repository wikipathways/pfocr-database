caption: Metabolism of H2S. In the canonical pathway of H2S production, l-homocysteine
  is converted to cystathionine by CBS, which is then converted to l-cysteine by CSE.
  H2S is produced from l-cysteine by both CBS and CSE. A second pathway is the production
  of H2S by conversion of d-cysteine or α-ketoglutarate to 3-mercaptopyruvate by DAO
  and CAT respectively, which is subsequently converted to H2S by 3-MST. H2S catabolism
  occurs through persulfidation of proteins, via the formation of sulfane sulfur species,
  such as thiosulfate via SQR. Catabolism also occurs through the production of methyl
  mercaptan, also known as methanethiol, to form dimethyl sulfide. A non-enzymatic
  pathway allows H2S to bind to methemoglobin to form sulfhemoglobin.
