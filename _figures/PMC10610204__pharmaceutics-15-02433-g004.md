caption: Activation of DNA damage-induced checkpoint signaling pathway in ATM-deficient
  cells and mechanism of ATR inhibitor and ATM defect-induced synthesis and lethality
  (by Figdraw). (A) DNA double-strand breaks or DNA single-strand breaks activate
  the ATM/CHK2 and ATR/CHK1 signaling pathways, respectively, and CHK2 and CHK1 phosphorylate
  CDC25 to eliminate CDK activation, thereby preventing the progression of the cell
  cycle in the S phase or G2/M phase. (B) With ATR inhibitors, ATM-deficient cells
  die due to cell cycle checkpoint inactivation. Yellow lightning indicates cell cycle
  arrest. The red arrow indicates that this pathway is activated. The grey arrow indicates
  that the pathway is inactivated.
