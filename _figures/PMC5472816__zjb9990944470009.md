caption: Model for InvS-mediated Salmonella invasion. InvS facilitates Salmonella
  effector secretion and translocation by positively regulating prgH, which encodes
  a type III secretion apparatus protein. Furthermore, InvS negatively regulates fimZ,
  a global regulator that is known to repress Salmonella SPI-1 gene expression by
  activating HilE. FimZ activates FimA, the major fimbrial unit. FimZ also negatively
  regulates flagellar synthesis by repressing expression of the master flagellar regulator
  FlhDC. The regulation of these target mRNAs or proteins by InvS, in turn, promotes
  Salmonella to invade the host cell. Arrows represent activation while the assertion
  signs represent inhibition. Dotted lines indicate indirect regulation. The symbol
  “?” indicates unknown factors or a signaling cascade that may be involved in the
  pathway.
