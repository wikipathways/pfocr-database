caption: A simple network consisting of two parallel cascades with cross talk. The
  network consists of two pathways, X and Y. Pathway X has three components (x0, x1,
  and x2); component x0 is input signal itself, or is activated in manner that is
  strictly proportional to the input signal. (Because the input signal can have any
  shape, x0 can abstractly represent any upstream component, e.g., a receptor, a G-protein,
  a kinase, etc.) The parameters a1 and a2 are activation rate constants, and  and  are
  deactivation, or decay, rate constants. For example, a1 is the rate constant for
  the activation of x1 by x0, and  is the rate constant for the deactivation of x1.
  (B) Outputs of this network in response to X signaling (that is, X input) and Y
  signaling. Signal x0 does not lead to the production of y2, because none of the
  components of X can activate or inhibit components of Y. Thus, the specificity of

  definitions). In contrast, y1 (which might be a kinase of pathway Y) weakly activates
  x2 (which might be a transcription factor for pathway X), at a rate characterized

  description: A simple network consisting of two parallel cascades with cross talk.
    The network consists of two pathways, X and Y. Pathway X has three components
    (x0, x1, and x2); component x0 is input signal itself, or is activated in manner
    that is strictly proportional to the input signal. (Because the input signal can
    have any shape, x0 can abstractly represent any upstream component, e.g., a receptor,
    a G-protein, a kinase, etc.) The parameters a1 and a2 are activation rate constants,
    and  and  are deactivation, or decay, rate constants. For example, a1 is the rate
    constant for the activation of x1 by x0, and  is the rate constant for the deactivation
    of x1. (B) Outputs of this network in response to X signaling (that is, X input)
    and Y signaling. Signal x0 does not lead to the production of y2, because none
    of the components of X can activate or inhibit components of Y. Thus, the specificity
    of X with respect to Y and fidelity of Y with respect to X are complete (see text
    for definitions). In contrast, y1 (which might be a kinase of pathway Y) weakly
    activates x2 (which might be a transcription factor for pathway X), at a rate
    characterized by the “leak constant”, hleak. Thus, the specificity of Y and the
    fidelity of X are finite functions of hleak and other key parameters of the network.
    In particular, in the text it is shown that network specificity is proportional
    to 1/hleak. (C) Depiction of the ratios equal to the specificity of pathway Y
    and the fidelity of pathway X.
