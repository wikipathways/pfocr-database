caption: Microbial functions and species involved in carbohydrate metabolism, energy
  metabolism and other processes in the rumen of the cows with high (HRFI) and low
  residual feed intake (LRFI). Among the genes encoding enzymes involved in the fructose
  and mannose metabolism pathway, 8 genes tended to be more abundant in the HRFI cows.
  In the glycolysis pathway, the abundance of 4 genes tended to be higher in the HRFI
  cows (P < 0.10), and 1 gene was more abundant in the HRFI cows (P = 0.03). In the
  pentose phosphate pathway, 2 genes tended to be more abundant in the HRFI group
  (P < 0.10), and 5 genes were enriched in the HRFI group (P < 0.05). Three genes
  involved in quorum sensing pathways, and 6 genes involved in methane metabolism
  were significantly enriched in the HRFI cows. In the butyrate metabolism pathway,
  4 genes tended to be more abundant in HRFI cows (P < 0.10), and 3 genes related
  to butyrate production were significantly enriched in HRFI cows (P < 0.05). The
  blue text represents the genes or metabolites enriched in HRFI cows, and the red
  (orange) text indicates the genes or metabolites enriched or tended to be enriched
  in LRFI cows. The text in brackets under the gene name is HRFI/LRFI fold change
  of gene. The text over the arrow is the gene code. Inside the pink rectangles are
  the microorganisms that play an important role in the pathway
