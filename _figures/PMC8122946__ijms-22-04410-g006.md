  (a) Photosynthesis and carbon fixation pathway; (b) Starch biosynthesis pathway.
  The color of the rectangle represents the changes of gene expression under NaCl
  treatment, red indicates upregulated and blue indicates downregulated over the full-time
  series (09:00–21:00). The yellow represents DEGs with both differentially upregulated
  and downregulated expressions over the time series. FDP: beta-D-fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate,
  F6P: beta-D-fructose 6-phosphate, G6P: alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate, G1P: D-glucose
  1-phosphate. The details of gene annotation and expression changes are shown in
  , respectively. (c) Verification and expression analysis of selected DEGs by quantitative
  real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3).'
