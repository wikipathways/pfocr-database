caption: Figure 1. A PET-CT showed avidity in the lung mass (A). Bronchoscopic biopsy
  with subsequent DNA Sanger sequencing (B) identified a minor clone containing an
  activating, KRAS G12D mutation. A PET/CT after completion of radiation, chemotherapy,
  and panitumumab showed a partial response with reduced FDG uptake and residual disease
  in the mediastinum (C). Ion torrent sequencing revealed that the residual tumor
  cells harbor the same cancer gene mutations as the pretreatment tumor tissues, with
  the exception of G12D KRAS mutation being absent (D). In mCRC, which are predominantly
  adenocarcinomas, panitumumab halts the phosphorylation of KRAS-GDP, preventing activation
  of the KRAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway ([E], blocked pathways grayed out); however, activating
  mutations cause constitutive activation of the downstream pathway ([F], pathway
  no longer gray). In NSCLC, even when an activating KRAS mutation is present, all
  pathways contribute to cell cycle progression, proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis,
  and production of EGFR ligands that cause radioresistance ([G], without panitumumab
  all pathways are active); with panitumumab, although the KRAS pathways may be constitutively
  activated, the overall number of effectors contributing to cancer cell proliferation
  is decreased ([H], panitumumab causes inactivation of pathways, now grayed out).
