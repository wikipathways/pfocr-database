caption: The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway () is
  one of the most aberrantly activated survival pathway in cancer, making it an important
  target for drug development., This pathway is negatively regulated by the tumor
  suppressor protein PTEN. Unlike most cancers, in which PI3K activation is frequently
  associated with PTEN deletion or mutation, other mechanisms have been reported to
  activate this pathway in HL, including activation of CD30, CD40, and RANK receptors,
  mutations in the p85a subunit of the PI3K, and inactivation of PTEN function by
  phosphorylation.– In vitro experiments demonstrated that inhibition of PI3K, Akt,
  or mTOR by various small molecules can induce cell cycle arrest, autophagy, and
  apoptosis in HRS-derived cell lines in vitro.– In addition to a direct antitumor
  effect, mTOR inhibitors may induce clinical responses by enhancing the immune response
  and inhibiting angiogenesis.,
