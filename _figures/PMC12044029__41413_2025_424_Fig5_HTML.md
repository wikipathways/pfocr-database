caption: Proposed model of BDF-mediated axis of bone-circulating system. a Elevated
  levels of circulating FGF23 enhance the expression and activity of NCC in the distal
  renal tubules, subsequently resulting in renal sodium retention, volume expansion,
  hypertension and hypertrophy. b Sclerostin inhibition results in the development
  of abdominal aortic aneurysms and atherosclerosis. However, high serum concentrations
  of sclerostin correlate with increased atherosclerosis, severe vascular calcification,
  and elevated arterial stiffness. c The role OPG in the pathophysiology of vascular
  calcification. OPG interacts with RANKL, thereby obstructing the RANKL/RANK signaling
  pathway. Additionally, OPG demonstrates direct agonistic properties on vascular
  endothelial cells through its heparin-binding domain. Furthermore, OPG acts as a
  competitive inhibitor of TRAIL by hindering TRAIL-death receptor interactions
