caption: SARS-CoV-mediated evasion of host innate immune response. The viral antigens
  are recognized via different PRRs to elicit the innate immune response. (1) Upon
  interaction of the virus with surface PRRs or the specific receptor, the particles
  are endocytosed into the cytosol and are then recognized by cytosolic PRRs like
  RIG-I and MDA5. (2) The viral genome, along with different proteins, interacts with
  MAVS and initiates NF-κB activation via triggering a signaling cascade that involves
  numerous E3 ubiquitin kinases and ligases. (3) Upon translocation into the nucleus,
  activated NF-κB acts as a transcriptional activator for numerous pro-inflammatory
  cytokines with an NF-κB-response element. The IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), upon
  phosphorylation via ubiquitin kinases, homodimerizes and moves inside the nucleus
  to activate the transcription of Type I IFNs. (4) Type I IFNs have both autocrine
  and paracrine mechanisms to activate the JAK–STAT signaling pathway via IFNα/β receptor
  (IFNAR), followed by phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 via cytoplasmic protein
  JAK1 and TYK2 kinases. STAT1 & STAT2 heterodimers translocate into the nucleus and
  are recruited for transcription of the IFN-stimulated gene having an IFN-stimulated
  response element (ISRE) present on their promoter. SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses
  have found many ways to inhibit the signaling cascade by utilizing either the structural
  proteins (M and N protein) or NSPs (NSP1, NSP3b, and NSP6 along with PLpro), shown
  as numbers and letters in the figure. Together, the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and type I IFNs tries to create an antiviral immune microenvironment that
  controls viral synthesis and infection, but the viruses have deployed various strategies
  to shut down these signaling pathways to counteract the immune response. RIG-I,
