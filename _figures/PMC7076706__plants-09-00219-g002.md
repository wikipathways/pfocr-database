caption: Rsv-mediated perception and resistance against SMV. Rsv1 recognizes the effectors
  P3 and/or HC-Pro protein; recognition of HC-Pro induces a lethal systemic hypersensitive
  response (LSHR), and recognition of P3 induces several host factors including HSP90,
  EDS1, EDR1, WRKY6, and WRKY30, which contribute in extreme resistance (ER) through
  the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid pathways. Rsv3 recognizes the CI protein
  and thereby induces ER where abscisic acid (ABA), and antiviral RNA silencing pathway
  and autophagy are triggered following infection. Rsv4 recognizes P3, which encodes
  dsRNAase, and targets the viral dsRNA in the replication complex leading to its
  degradation. The effector for Rsv5 is unknown, but the recognition results in ER
  in response to SMV-G1.
