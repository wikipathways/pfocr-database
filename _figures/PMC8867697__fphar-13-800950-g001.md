caption: Complement activation promotes coagulation. C3, the initiator of the complement
  activation pathway, can be cleaved into effector components, namely C3a and C3b.
  In CKD-induced complement activation, C3a directly promotes coagulation by enhancing
  platelet aggregation and adhesion. Meanwhile, C3b promotes the synthesis of C5 convertase
  to induce C5 cleavage to produce C5a and C5b. C5a directly stimulates neutrophils
  and monocytes to increase the expression of TF and thus induce thrombosis. In renal
  replacement therapy, C5b comes into contact with the dialysis membrane and, together
  with multiple complements (C6–C9), mediates the production of MAC and induces coagulation.
  In turn, coagulation secondary to complement activation can amplify complement and
  coagulation activation through positive feedback from thrombin on C3 cleavage. TF,
  tissue factor; MAC, membrane attack complex; AP, alternative pathway; LP, lectin
  pathway; CP, classical pathway.
