caption: Schematic mechanisms of targeted delivery based on BNPs. a BNPs loaded with
  drugs were injected into the organism intravenously. b The passive targeting of
  BNPs towards tumors through the EPR effect. As the leaky vasculature exists in tumor
  vessels, BNPs are allowed to pass through the pathophysiological walls rather than
  regular walls, leading to the accumulation of BNPs within the tumor due to the characteristic
  size, shape, surface charge of the nanoparticles. c Active targeting enables uptake
  of BNPs through the ligand-mediated pathway and stimulus-responsive pathway. Ligand-mediated
  targeting leverages the high expression of specific receptors on the surface of
  targeted cells by keeping them engaged with the targeting ligands. In the presence
  of intrinsic and/or extrinsic stimuli, BNPs attempt to accumulate in microenvironments
  of disease tissues and realize environment-responsive drug release
