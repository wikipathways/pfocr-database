caption: SCF and its active ingredients protect against inflammation in NDs. In the
  inflammatory response, TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and then binds
  to the MyD88 Toll structure, forming a TLR-MyD active complex. Then, the complex
  recruits and activates the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), which is associated
  with tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), activating the downstream
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway [,]. Meanwhile, TNFR1 binds to
  TNF, and interacts with receptor-interacting protein (RIP), activating the downstream
  inhibitory kappa B kinase (IKK) and MAPK pathway [,]. Phosphorylation of IκB protein
  leads to degradation of the protein, promotes nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB), and transfers NF-κB to the nucleus []. At the same time, the activation
  of the MAPK pathway leads to the production of activator protein-1 (AP-1), which
  is phosphorylated, and then enters the nucleus. Activation of NF-κB and AP-1 can
  lead to over-expression of the inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6,
  IL-8, and IL-10, resulting a series of inflammatory reactions [,,,]. The protective
  effect of SCF and its active ingredients are shown in orange.
