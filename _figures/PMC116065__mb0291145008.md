caption: Model for the role of the Cdc28 complex in control of filamentous growth.
  CDKYF and CDKFF suggest two slightly different activity states of the Cdc28 complex,
  which mediate different downstream effects. The Hsl1-Swe1 pathway, with Elm1 as
  a direct or indirect positive regulator of Hsl1, is proposed as a signal transduction
  module that can affect the change between CDKYF and CDKFF. At least one other means
  of affecting the change between CDKYF and CDKFF is proposed, because diploid cells
  undergo filamentous growth independent of Swe1 function. The Ste MAP kinase pathway
  is proposed as a possible upstream signaling module that affects the Hsl1-Swe1 pathway,
  although evidence of a direct connection between these modules is lacking, as noted
  by the question mark. The dotted line indicates the existence of possible alternative
  means of affecting the change between the CDKYF and CDKFF activity states, which
  may be mediated by other transcription factors providing morphologic differentiation
  functions that are partially redundant with Ste12p.
