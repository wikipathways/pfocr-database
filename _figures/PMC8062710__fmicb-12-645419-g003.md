caption: Geminiviral siRNA pathways. (A) Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS)
  pathway. The host RNA polymerase transcribes the replicative form of virus into
  structured/overlapping/aberrant transcripts which are processed into 21 nt siRNA
  by DICER-LIKE4/DCL4. DCL2 generates 22 nt siRNAs in the absence of DCL4. DCL1 acts
  as a positive regulator (+) by facilitating dsRNA access to other DCLs. The role
  of DCL1 as a negative regulator (┴) of DCL4 and DCL3 in geminiviral siRNA pathway
  is not clear (?). The 21 nt siRNAs-Argonaute1 (AGO1) target viral transcripts for
  slicing by the endo-ribonuclease activity of AGO1. The role of AGO7 in geminiviral
  defense is not clear (?). The sliced mRNA transcript serves as a template for RNA-DEPENDENT
  RNA POLYMERASE1/2/6 (RDR1, -2, -6) to convert it into dsRNA, which thereafter generates
  secondary siRNAs to amplify the host defense response. Suppression of PTGS by binding
  AGO1 and RDR6 by Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV) AC2 is denoted. (B)
  Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) pathway. The Pol II transcribed dsRNA is processed
  by DCL3 (when DCL2 and DCL4 are saturated) into 24 nt siRNAs which cause de novo
  methylation of viral genome. The methylated viral genome is transcribed by Pol IV
  to produce a nascent transcript, which is converted to dsRNA by RNA-DEPENDENT RNA
  POLYMERASE2/RDR2. dsRNA is processed by DCL3 into 24 nt siRNAs. The complex of 24
  nt siRNA-AGO4 targets the Pol V-generated scaffold transcript to mediate RNA-directed
  DNA methylation. DRB, double-stranded RNA binding proteins and HEN1, HUA ENHANCER1
  methyltransferase.
