caption: 'The cGAS–cGAMP–STING signaling pathway: a universal sensor for double-strand
  DNA (dsDNA). (A). cGAS function is to sense DNA from the cytoplasm as result of
  infection, genomic, or mitochondrial instability. cGAS activation through the generation
  of cGAMP will drive the activation of the innate immune response and leads to the
  secretion of Interferon type 1 as well as a cocktail of cytokines. (B). Molecular
  mechanism of cGAS/STING pathway. cGAMP is the ligand for the STING receptor (shown
  in pink) and results in the activation of the transcription regulator factors NF-κβ
  and IRF-3 that drive the secretion of several pro-inflammatory molecules (Adapted
  from Ablasser et al. [] and Motwani et al. []).'
