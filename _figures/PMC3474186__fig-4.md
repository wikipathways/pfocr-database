caption: Signaling pathways mediated by rat sarcoma (Ras) and protein kinase B (Akt).
  Ras and Akt are key apoptosis mediators responsible for several regulatory pathways.
  There is experimental evidence to implicate that many of the proteins in these pathways
  as being regulated by Grx and protein glutathionylation, as indicated by an asterisk
  (*). Depending on the cellular insult, cell type, and protein target, alterations
  in protein glutathionylation may result in cell survival or apoptosis. Ras is responsible
  for mediating the Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase kinase kinase (MEKK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and MKK/JNK
  pathways. Glutathionylated Ras is an active form of this protein that can lead to
  increased Akt activity and therefore cell survival via the nuclear factor kappa-light
  chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) cascade. When Grx deglutathionylates
  Ras, this can result in activation of the MEKK pathway and inhibition of Akt, resulting
  in apoptosis. An upstream regulator of Akt is phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN),
  which is responsible for dephosphorylating PIP3, preventing the activation of Akt.
  PTEN-SSG is the inactive form of this protein, and is no longer able to dephosphorylate
  PIP3. Therefore, in the absence of Grx, PIP3 is phosphorylated and capable of activating
  Akt, resulting in cell survival. Like PTEN-SSG, protein kinase C (PKC) is also inhibited
  when it is glutathionylated. However, this protein modification prevents PKC's ability
  to phosphorylate and activate Akt, causing apoptosis. The downstream effectors of
  Akt include apoptosis signaling kinase (ASK1), Apaf-1/caspase-9, and the NFκB pathway.
  Many of these proteins can also be regulated by Grx and protein glutathionylation.
  Grx is capable of binding to ASK1 resulting in the inhibition of this protein and
  ultimately cell survival. Grx regulates the NFκB pathway via deglutathionylation
  of IKK and NFκB. Grx is implicated in many of the cellular survival/death signaling
  mechanisms, evident by the number of proteins potentially regulated by Grx and glutathionylation
  in these pathways.
