caption: Three proposed ammonia oxidation pathways in AOA. Pathway 1 was proposed
  by Walker et al. In this pathway, ammonia is oxidized to hydroxylamine by the membrane
  enzyme complex AMO/CuMMO (Walker et al. ). Subsequently, hydroxylamine is oxidized
  to nitrite in the periplasm by a heme-rich hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (CuHAO)
  complex. Four electrons from this oxidation are transferred to the quinone pool.
  Two electrons from the reduced quinone pool return to AMO (marked by red) and are
  required to initiate ammonia oxidation. The remaining two electrons enter the electron
  transport chain composed of pcy protein to generate the proton motive force (PMF)
  necessary for ATP synthesis and NADH synthesis. In Pathway 2 (Schleper and Nicol
  ; Stahl and de la Torre ), NO is speculated functioning as a redox shuttle to deliver
  electrons to the AMO (marked by green) since measurable amounts of NO are produced
  during ammonia oxidation. In pathway 3, iterative production and consumption of
  NO is involved in conversion of hydroxylamine to nitrite facilitated by a proposed
  novel copper enzyme capable of performing known P460 activity (CuP460) (Kozlowski
  et al. ). N2O was formed abiotically from NO by interaction with media components
  or with debris in killed cell. AMO/CuMMO, ammonia monooxygenase; CuHAO, hydroxylamine
  dehydrogenase; NIR, Cu-containing NO-forming nitrite reductase; pcy, plastocyanin;
  Q/QH2, quinone/quinol pool
