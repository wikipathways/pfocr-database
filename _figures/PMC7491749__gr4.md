caption: Acquired Resistance to Drugs Targeting K-RasG12C.(A) Steady state of KRAS
  mutant cells. Activating mutations of KRAS genes confer resistance to GAP-mediated
  K-Ras GTP hydrolysis, leading to uncontrolled activation of K-Ras downstream signaling
  and tumor growth.(B) Initial response to K-RasG12C inhibition. K-RasG12C inhibitors
  function by locking K-RasG12C in its GDP-binding state and hence suppress MAPK/ERK
  signaling and tumor growth.(C) Adaptive resistance to K-RasG12C inhibition. After
  initial response, ERK-mediated feedback inhibition of vertical RTKs/SHP2 pathway
  is lifted, which induces the activation of N-Ras, H-Ras, and K-RasG12C. Given that
  RTKs/SHP2 signaling pathway is hyperactive in this stage, newly synthesized K-RasG12C
  immediately binds with GTP, potentiating the feedback adaptive resistance. In addition,
  AURKA operates by interacting with GTP-bound K-RasG12C and promotes downstream RAF
  activation. Consequently, ERK is reactivated and tumor growth is resumed.
