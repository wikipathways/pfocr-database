caption: 'Omics analysis discovered high-confidence networks involved in AD. Using
  the FOREST OmicsIntegrator, we merged our DNA methylation sequencing dataset profiling
  enhancers in AD neurons and transcriptomic sequencing data generated from the no/mild,

  affected in AD neurons, as determined by network analysis are shown, and highlight
  two major networks involved in pathological progression in AD neurons. Pathway analysis
  by MetaCore of these two networks show their primary involvement in cell cycle reentry
  and amyloid neuropathies, respectively (q < 0.001, hypergeometric distribution).
