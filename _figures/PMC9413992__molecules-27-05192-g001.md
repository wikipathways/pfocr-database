caption: Molecular mechanism of regulation of HIF-1α in hypoxic and normoxic conditions.
  The figure represents the induction of HIF-1α translation via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
  On binding to growth factors at receptor tyrosin kinase PI3K becomes activated which
  further induces AKT and mTOR pathway activation followed by phosphorylation of S6.
  HIF-1α synthesis is induced by eIF-4E which binds to HIF-1 α upon activation by
  4E-BP1 which is a downstream signaling molecule of mTOR. In the presence of oxygen,
  Pro-402, Pro-564 in ODD and Asn-803 in CTAD are hydroxylated by PHD and FIH. As
  represented in the figure, hydroxylation at Asn-803 prevents binding of P300/CBP
  to HIF-1 α in normoxic conditions, whereas, hydroxylation at Proline residues allow
  VHL- elongine-C-elongine-B-Cullin-2 complex to bind at ODD of HIF-1α followed ubiquitination
  of HIF-1α via 26 proteasome. Expression of HIF-1α is also regulated by IPAS, a variant
  of HIF-3 which binds with HIF-1α to form an abortive complex. In hypoxic conditions,
  P300/CBP binds at CTAD which prevents degradation of HIF-1α. HIF-1α enters nucleus
  and forms active transcription factor by binding with HIF-1β in order to transcribe
  genes for angiogenesis, metastasis, and survival of cancer stem cells in tumor tissue.
