caption: Current model of CW entry and signaling. Schematic representations of three
  pathways are shown. Red lines and text indicate inhibition by listed treatments.
  (Left) The CW-TLR2 interaction is essential for activating NF-κB and proinflammatory
  cytokine secretion, but not for CW internalization. (Middle) On the other hand,
  the CW-PAFr interaction is required for CW internalization via the clathrin/dynamin-dependent
  pathway but is not essential for inflammatory responses. Upon internalization via
  PAFr, CW-containing endosomes are trafficked either to recycling endosomes or lysosomes.
  (Right) An additional EIPA-sensitive actin-dependent pathway is involved in CW internalization
  leading to the lysosomal compartment. Some of the signals for TLR2 CW-induced proinflammatory
  cytokines originated from lysosomal compartments.
