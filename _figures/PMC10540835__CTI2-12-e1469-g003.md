caption: 'Dopaminergic modulation of immune responses in PD: DR‐independent mechanism.
  (i) Α and β‐ adrenoreceptors (AR) are expressed by human and animal immune cells
  and modulate their activity. (ii) Immune cells can synthesise and uptake DA since
  they express the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and the dopamine transporter (DAT). DAT
  and other transporters, such as the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT),
  can modulate DA activity on immune cells. (iii) Redox pathways and the generation
  of reactive oxygen metabolites, such as DA quinone (DAQ), are involved in DA‐immune
  regulation. The figure was created with BioRender.com.'
