caption: Different transcription factors like E2F1, E2F8, Sp1, FOXM1, NFκB (indicated
  in green) enhance while others such as YY1 along with lysine methyl transferase
  G9a (indicated in red) repress the expression of UHRF1 at transcription level. Many
  small non-coding microRNAs also decrease UHRF1 expression by destabilizing UHRF1
  mRNA through binding to 3’UTR region. UHRF1 protein is degraded by proteosomal pathway
  after autoubiquitinylation or ubiquitinylation by SCFβ-TrCP E3 ligase. Ubiquitinylated
  UHRF1 is stabilized in cells by USP7, HSP90 or UPAT lnRNA. Increased transcription
  factor expression, downregulation of miRNAs and increased levels of stabilizing
  factors (all indicated in green) result in overexpression of UHRF1.
