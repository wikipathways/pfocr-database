caption: Misregulated expression of members of the ubiquitin cascade contributes to
  the aberrant signaling of various pathways in cancer. (LEFT) The UBE2N/UBE2V1 E2
  ubiquitin conjugating enzyme complex catalyzes the Lys63-linked ubiquitination of
  NEMO that recruits the TAK1/TAB1/2 complex to activate the IKK complex, which is
  composed of IKKβ, IKKα and NEMO. IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα, which is Lys48-linked
  ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26S-proteasome. This event releases
  NFκB to translocate into the nucleus to mediate the transcription of a signature
  of genes involved in inflammatory response. STUB1 E3 ligase negatively regulates
  NFκB signaling by catalyzing the degradation-inducing Lys48-linked ubiquitination
  of p65 subunit of NFκB. (CENTER) In addition, cancer cells take advantage of overexpressed
  TRAF4 to modulate TGFβ signaling. TGFβ activation culminates in the nuclear translocation
  of SMAD2/3/4 complex to modulate gene transcription. SMAD7 is a negative regulator
  of TGFβ signaling by recruiting SMURF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate TβRI,
  leading to the proteasomal degradation of the receptor and mitigation of signaling
  TGFβ signaling is regulated by TRAF4 E3 ligase mediated Lys48-linked ubiquitination
  of SMURF2 E3 ligase. The latter E3 ligase catalyzes the degradation signal of TGFβ
  receptor I (TβRI), in which these events mitigate the activation of the signaling
  pathway. TRAF4, on the other hand, is conjugated to Lys63-linked ubiquitin polymers
  to activate TAK1/TAB1/2 complex that induces the signaling of p38 MAPK and NFκB.
  TRAF4 further interacts with deubiquitinating enzyme USP15 and USP4, which remove
  the degradation signal from TGFβ receptor I. These events contribute to the stabilization
  of TGFβ signaling. (RIGHT) Tumor adaptation to hypoxia is highly attributed to HIF
  signaling. Under normal oxygen level condition (normoxia), VHL E3 ligase binds to
  hydroxylated Proline residue in HIF catalyzed by PHD proteins. VHL then catalyzes
  the Lys48-linked ubiquitination of HIF, leading to proteasome degradation. UBE2S
  enzyme controls VHL protein stability. Under low oxygen conditions (hypoxia), inactivating
  of VHL (either by mutations or decreased expression) contributes to HIF isoform
  stabilization, which mediates the transcription of genes involved in tumor adaptation
  to hypoxia, including angiogenesis. These signaling events governed by members of
  the ubiquitin cascade all contribute to EMT, cellular proliferation, migration,
  invasion, chemotherapy resistance and metastasis.
