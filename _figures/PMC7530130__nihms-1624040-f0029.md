caption: '(A) Enzymatic reaction of phosphoinositides PtdIns(x,y)Pn control several
  kinds of signaling processes. Einactive: proteins contain phosphoinositide-recognition
  domains and assume an inactive conformation. Phosphorylated phosphoinositide (PtdIns(x,y)Pn+1)
  recruits the protein to the membrane, and to interact with integral (I) or peripheral
  (P) membrane proteins. The complex can remain active at the membrane and recruit
  additional proteins. The protein can return to the cytosol in an activated (i.e.
  phosphorylated) form (Eactive). Adapted from Ref. . Copyright © 2005 by The Company
  of Biologists. (B) Diagram of the mechanistic findings for the TAM-MLKL input into
  the necroptosis pathway, which involves enzymatic phosphorylation and assembly.
