caption: IL-6 promotes PAI-1 expression via trans signaling. High concentration of
  IL-6 combined with soluble IL-6R can activate the JAK/STAT3 signal pathway through
  gp130 and upregulate the expression of PAI-1 and IL-6. TCZ can reduce the expression
  of PAI-1 and IL-6 by inhibiting the binding of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R.
