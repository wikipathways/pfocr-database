caption: The urinary excretion of citric acid (TCA) cycle metabolites and the renal
  expression of genes that regulate these metabolites were significantly reduced among
  participants with versus without non-diabetic CKD. Urine excretion of citric acid
  cycle metabolites in the proximal part of the pathway were reduced in samples from
  patients with non-diabetic CKD, as was the mRNA expression of the enzymes catalyzing
  the proximal steps of the citric acid cycle in the tubulointerstitial compartment
  in biopsies of patients with non-diabetic CKD.
