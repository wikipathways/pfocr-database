  Syndrome. (A) Overview of normal proinsulin production and maintenance of glucose
  homeostasis. (B) Solution structure of WT proinsulin () showing the A- (green),
  B- (blue), and C (black) domains and three native disulfide bridges (yellow spheres).
  Wild-type residues PheB24, LeuB15 and LeuA16, which are examined in this study as
  sites of mutation, are shown as red side chains. (C) Folding of proinsulin proceeds
  via sequential disulfide linkage steps from the fully unfolded state through one
  (1SS), two (2SS), and three disulfide bonded (3SS) conformational ensembles before
  reaching the native state (N). Chemical trapping experiments showed that the formation
  of B19-A20 disulfide as the predominant key first step in the hierarchical disulfide
  pathway (–). Reprinted with permission from Hua QX, et al. Biochemistry. 2001;40:12299-311.
