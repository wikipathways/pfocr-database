caption: Bioenergetics adaptations of astrocytes to neurotransmission. Synaptic cleft
  glutamate (Glu) released by the pre‐synaptic neuron acts on glutamate receptors
  (Glu‐R) placed in the post‐synaptic neurons, triggering the influx of Ca2+ (and
  Na+, not indicated) and causing plasma membrane depolarization, which is needed
  to propagate the nervous impulse (neuronal activity). To reset basal levels of glutamate
  in the synaptic cleft, it is taken up by astrocytes through glutamate transporters
  (Glu‐T), which require Na+ uptake. Astrocytes convert glutamate into glutamine (Gln),
  which is released and then taken up by neurons, which convert it back into glutamate
  (blue arrowed lines). The Na+/K+‐ATPase hydrolyses ATP to conserve its energy to
  reset Na+ (and K+) homeostasis. Such ATP can be obtained by glutamate oxidation
  in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the mitochondria (m.). However, strong evidence
  indicates that glutamate uptake is coupled, via a yet unknown mechanism, with glucose
  conversion into lactate through the glycolytic pathway (red arrowed lines). Neuronal
  activity is also coupled with glucose uptake from the blood, and with glycogen conversion
  into lactate. As neuronal activity‐associated glycolytic activation in astrocytes
  is coupled with stoichiometric lactate release, it is likely that glycolytic‐derived
  ATP would be in charge of sustaining Na+/K+ homeostasis during glutamate uptake.
  Astrocytes are genetically adapted to support a constitutive glycolytic phenotype
  in view of their low activity of APC/C‐Cdh1 (anaphase‐promoting complex/cyclosome/Cdh1),
  the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the degradation of 6‐phosphofructo‐2‐kinase/fructose‐2,6‐bisphosphatase‐3
  (PFKFB3), a pro‐glycolytic enzyme. In contrast to astrocytes, neurons express high
  APC/C‐Cdh1 activity hence continuously degrading PFKFB3 causing their low glycolytic
  phenotype. Thus, neurons need an energy source different from glucose. Evidence
  obtained from cultured cells and in vivo strongly suggest that astrocyte‐released
  lactate support neuronal functions, both serving as a fuel and, possibly, as a signaling
  molecule. Thus, astrocytes are metabolically adapted to sustain the bioenergetics
  status of neurons during neural activity. The stoichiometry of the reactions has
  been omitted for clarity. Likewise, additional factors involved in these adaptations
  could not be depicted herein and can be found in the main text.
