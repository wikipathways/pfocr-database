caption: Scheme depicting interactions of the ET and NO pathway as described in this
  chapter. On balance, ROS-induced ET-1 production results in elevated ETA receptor
  activity that is not sufficiently counterbalanced by ETB receptor function. The
  renal tubular ETB receptor actions are mediated by NO. However, these mechanisms
  are unable to counteract ETA-dependent vascular and inflammatory effects.
