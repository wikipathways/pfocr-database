caption: '(A) The production of Und-PP in E. coli proceeds via the methylerythritol
  phosphate (MEP) pathway to produce a pool of Und-PP, which is most likely distributed
  unequally amongst cells (lime, high concentration; aqua, mid-range concentration;
  dark blue, low concentration). Und-PP functions as a lipid anchor upon which PG
  precursors are assembled to form PG lipid II. This molecule is the substrate for
  the class A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs) and the SEDS/bPBPs systems required
  to synthesize PG. (B) Pharmacological (fosmidomycin) or genetic disruptions (UppSW31R)
  in the MEP pathway restrict the synthesis and availability of Und-PP (the dotted
  red line illustrates how the total amount of Und-PP has been reduced). Loss of PBP1B,
  an aPBP, in combination with low levels of Und-PP triggers cell lysis. Overproducing
  PBP1A or enlarging the amount of Und-PP available for PG synthesis eliminates cell
  lysis (not shown). (C) Inhibiting bPBPs with mecillinam (PBP2) or aztreonam (PBP3),
  in combination with low levels of Und-PP also triggers lysis. Again, increasing
  the amounts of Und-PP prevents lysis by these antibiotics (not shown). Other abbreviations:
  G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; PYR, pyruvate.'
