caption: 'Interplay between Wnt, Nurr1 and En1 signaling in vitro and in vivo. (A)
  Model adapted from Kitagawa et al. []: Wnt signaling via β-catenin enhances the
  transcriptional activity of Nurr1 in cells at Nurr1 responsive elements (NREs).
  In the absence of β-catenin, Nurr1 associates with T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer
  factor (TCF/LEF) in co-repressor complexes on NREs. After activation of Wnt signaling,
  β-catenin interacts with Nurr1 on NREs, competing with TCF/LEF for Nurr1 binding,
  resulting in the disruption of the co-repressors from the Nurr1 complex and the
  concomitant recruitment of coactivators. (B) Model adapted from Kitagawa et al.
  []: on the other hand, Nurr1 was observed to slightly modulate, in a negative way,
  the canonical Wnt signaling through association with the TCF/LEF region. After Wnt
  stimulation, β-catenin competed with Nurr1 for Lef binding on the TCF/LEF promoter
  site and disrupted Nurr1 binding, promoting Wnt-target gene transcription. (C) Several
  studies in Drosophila and chick embryos have described interactions between En1/engrailed
  (en) and the Wnt/wg signaling pathway whereby engrailed expression is dependent
  on Wnt/wg signaling and vice versa. However, in Drosophila, engrailed expressing
  cells did not have active wg signaling. From mice studies it is known that Wnt signaling
  regulates En1 expression early in midbrain development. Whether the reverse happens
  in the mouse midbrain is not known. (D) In one cell culture study [], it was observed
  that En1 can function as a negative regulator of β-catenin transcriptional activity
  in a post-translational manner (that is, by affecting β-catenin protein levels only).
  (E) Three questions remain currently unsolved: first, whether En1 cooperates with
  Nurr1 during mdDA development; second, whether Nurr1, En1 and canonical Wnt signaling
  cooperate in later stages of mdDA neuron development, such as in mdDA neuron specification;
  and third, whether Nurr1 and/or En1 regulate canonical Wnt signaling during mdDA
  neuron development.'
