caption: Schematic Model of TMAO-Mediated Lipid Metabolism Regulatory Mechanism. This
  figure provides a detailed illustration of the interplay between the AMPK signaling
  pathway and the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in bovine hepatic cells following
  TMAO treatment, as well as the potential mechanisms by which they cooperatively
  regulate lipid metabolism. Rectangles in the diagram represent genes, proteins,
  enzymes, and metabolites, with arrows indicating the direction of signal transduction
  or metabolic flux. Different colors denote regulatory relationships, with red indicating
  upregulation and blue indicating downregulation
