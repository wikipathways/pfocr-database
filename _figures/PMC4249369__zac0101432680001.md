caption: Pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway. The pathway for pantothenate
  biosynthesis, based on that in E. coli, is above the dashed line with the terminal
  enzyme pantothenate synthetase (pantoate-β-alanine ligase). This pathway is found
  in bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants. Pantothenate is metabolized to coenzyme A
  through the conserved pathway shown. The UniProt protein sequence accession numbers
  for the T. gondii, N. caninum, and human sequences are included for reference.
