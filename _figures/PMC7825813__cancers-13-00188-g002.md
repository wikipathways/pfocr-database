caption: 'Glucose degradation and metabolism in tumor cells. The uptake of glucose
  by cell membrane glucose transporters (Glut) is followed by its glycolytic degradation
  to pyruvate. The first step is the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase (HK)
  and, under anaerobic glycolysis and aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect, light green
  area), pyruvate is converted to lactate, thereby regenerating NAD+ to supply the
  glycolytic processes. This pathway represents an energy source for tumor cells and
  provides intermediates such as ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH, which are essential
  for cell proliferation. Pyruvate then undergoes oxidative phosphorylation in the
  mitochondria, which leads to the formation of ATP molecules from the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA). Abbreviations: ATP: adenosine triphosphate; ADP: adenosine diphosphate;
  NAD+: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form); NADH, nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide (reduced form); NADPH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (reduced form); TME: tumor microenvironment; TCA: tricarboxylic acid; LDH: lactate
  dehydrogenase.'
