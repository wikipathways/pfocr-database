caption: (A) Square scheme representation of PCET mechanisms available for the cleavage
  of an E–H bond. The stepwise transfer of electrons and protons are shown on the
  edges of the square. The concerted transfer of the electron and proton via concerted
  PCET is shown along the diagonal. (B) Reaction coordinate of stepwise vs concerted
  PCET mechanisms. Stepwise PCET generates high-energy charged intermediates which
  are avoided in a concerted PCET pathway.
