caption: Proposed biosynthetic and metabolic pathway for cytokinins.The proposed biosynthesis
  of trans-zeatin tri-/diphosphate in Arabidopsis is shown. Both ADP and ATP are likely
  substrates for the plant IPT enzyme, and these and their di- and tri-phosphate derivatives
  are indicted together (e. g. ATP/ADP). See text for more details.
