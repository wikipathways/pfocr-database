caption: Schematic representation of canonical apoptotic pathways. In the intrinsic
  pathway, pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins act as sensors and interact with anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 proteins upon activation by stress signals. Activation over a critical threshold
  overcomes the anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 proteins and promotes oligomerization
  of Bax/Bak channels in the mitochondrial membrane that permit the release of the
  intermembrane space protein cytochrome C []. Cytoplasmic cytochrome C promotes apoptosome
  formation (complex of Apaf1, caspase 9, and cytochrome C) which activates caspases
  3 and 7. This results in a signalling cascade providing activation of additional
  caspase family members which proceed to act on a wide range of cellular targets,
  ultimately resulting in cell death [,]. In the extrinsic pathway, activation of
  death receptors (e.g., Fas, tumour necrosis factor receptor 1; TNFR1) by cognate
  ligands (e.g., Fas ligand;FasL, tumour necrosis factor alpha; TNF-α) recruits Fas-associated
  protein with death domain (FADD) adaptor proteins and procaspase 8 to form the death-inducing
  signalling complex (DISC) []. Procaspase 8 molecules aggregate resulting in autoprocessing
  and subsequent activation. Active caspase 8 activates caspase 3 and Bid (in its
  active truncated form; tBid) and converges with the intrinsic pathway via mitochondrial
  Bax-Bak channel formation []. In the granzyme B pathway, granules containing granzyme
  B and perforin are released from immune cells such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes and
  natural killer (NK) cells. Perforin oligomerises in the target cell membrane, allowing
  for entry of granzyme B which is also capable then of activating caspase 3 and Bid,
  similar to caspase 8 [].
