caption: (A) Gαq compared with β-arrestin-dependent pathways. On activation, PAR-2
  promotes Gαq coupling and subsequent mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and activation
  of PKC (i). Ca2+ and PKC can promote activation of PYK2 and Src [,], association
  of PYK2 with p85 [] and possibly phosphorylation of p110 (shown in ) (ii). PAR-2
  also promotes activation of Cdc42 by an unknown mechanism (shown in  and ), perhaps
  through Gαq/Ca2+-dependent mechanisms or through coupling to a different G-protein
  (iii). Activation of Cdc42 and Src leads to activation of p110α and p110β (p110*)
  (iv). β-Arrestin signalling through PAR-2 opposes the Gαq pathway through multiple
  mechanisms. First, PAR-2 promotes recruitment of both β-arrestins and p85/p110 to
  the receptor [,,] (v), which can lead to inhibition of p110 catalytic activity (vi).
  β-Arrestins also inhibit PAR-2-stimulated Cdc42 activation (shown in ) (vii) and
  promote receptor uncoupling from Gαq [] (viii), both of which would inhibit PAR-2-induced
  PI3K activity. (B) Model of IGF-1-stimulated PI3K activity (for comparison with
  PAR-2). IGF-1 has been shown to promote tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 SH2 domains,
  and its recruitment to phospho-tyrosines on IRS-1 or the IRS-1 receptor itself [,]
  (i). β-Arrestins were shown to facilitate IRS-1-induced PI3K activity, possibly
  through its ability to bind both the IGF-1R and SH3 domain-containing proteins [,]
  (ii). This may indirectly recruit the p85/p110 complex to the receptor. (C) PAR-2
  can promote β-arrestin-dependent inhibition of both p110 subunits. Both β-arrestin-1
  and β-arrestin-2 can directly inhibit p110α in vitro (i), but can only do so in
  vivo on PAR-2 activation (ii). Only β-arrestin-2 can directly inhibit p110β in vitro
  (iii), however, on activation of PAR-2 in vivo β-arrestin-1 becomes inhibitory.
  This may reflect an association with a third factor (“factor X”) in cells (iv) or
  post-translational modification of the receptor, e.g. phosphorylation (v).
