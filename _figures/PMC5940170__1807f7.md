caption: Speculative model for how Vps74 regulates stress responses through the Tor1/2
  and Mtl1 pathways. Model for the possible role of Vps74 regulating gene transcription
  and protein levels in response to stress. (a) We suggest that Vps74 is important
  for the function of the mannosyltransferases Pmt1 and Pmt2 by helping recruit them
  to Golgi. (b) Pmt1 and Pmt2 mediate O-mannosylation of the transmembrane receptors
  Wsc1-3, Mid2 and Mtl1 (; ; ). Mannosylated Wsc1-3, Mid2 and Mtl1 are delivered to
  cytoplasmic membrane. (c) O-mannosylation of transmembrane receptors is important
  for proper activation of the Pkc1-Bck1-Mkk1/2-Mpk1 stress response cascade pathway
  Mtl1 (; ; ). The Pkc1-Bck1-Mkk1/2-Mpk1 cascade pathway promotes transcriptional
  changes and Mpk1 was shown to promote telomere silencing, transcription modulation
  and proteasome homeostasis (; ; ; ). (d) Data from mammalian cells showed that GOLPH3
  (Vps74 human ortholog) promotes mTor (Tor1/2 in yeast) activation (; ; ; ; ). The
  Tor pathway modulates gene transcription and protein translation in response to
  nutrient availability and cellular stresses.
