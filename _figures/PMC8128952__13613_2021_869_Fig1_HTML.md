caption: Illustration of the short-term ANS regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular
  system. The arterial baroreceptors, usually known as high-pressure baroreceptors,
  are mainly located in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses. Cardiopulmonary baroreceptors—also
  known as volume-receptors or low-pressure baroreceptors—are located in the atria,
  ventricles, vena cava, and pulmonary vessels. The chemoreceptors are located both
  peripherally (carotid bodies and aortic arch) and centrally. The vasomotor center
  hosts the circulatory regulation and is part of the medulla oblongata located in
  the brainstem, next to the nucleus of the solitary tract that receives sensory nerves
  signals through the glossopharyngeal and the vagus nerves (green lines). The SNS
  fibers (blue lines) originate from the medulla oblongata and emerge from the spinal
  cord's upper thoracic segments as pre-ganglionic neurons, ending inside the sympathetic
  chain ganglia located next to the vertebral column. SNS post-ganglionic neurons
  leave the sympathetic chain ganglia towards their target organs, namely the heart,
  the vessels, and the adrenal glands. Note that adrenal medulla sympathetic activation
  also induces epinephrine and norepinephrine release (dashed light blue lines) into
  the bloodstream. The PNS fibers (red lines) also originate from the brain stem and
  are incorporated as pre-ganglionic neurons in the vagal nerve, ending on the parasympathetic
  cardiac ganglia lying in the heart fat pad. Very short post-ganglionic neurons arise
  from these parasympathetic cardiac ganglia towards the right and left atrium, the
  atrioventricular node, the interatrial septum, the ascending aorta, and the pulmonary
  trunk. During septic shock, hypotension and the inflammatory reaction inhibit the
  vagal centers—inducing vagal outflow reduction—whereas the sympathetic pathway is
  stimulated. Sepsis, therefore, provokes a striking imbalance in ANS activity with
  a shift towards the SNS
