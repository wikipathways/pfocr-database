caption: Key discoveries in PRRs. a The proposal of the Infectious-Non-Self (INS)
  model. In 1989, Charles A. Janeway introduced a revolutionary hypothesis within
  the self-non-self model of immunity. He proposed that the innate immune system possesses
  a unique capacity to detect microbial infections (named PAMPs) via receptors, which
  are primarily expressed on APCs and are named PRRs. b The proposal of the Danger/injury
  model. Building on the foundation established by self-non-self models, Polly Matzinger
  introduced and elaborated the danger/injury model in immunology in 1994. This revolutionary
  proposal represented a significant shift in immunological thought. It posited that
  PRRs can be activated not only by foreign antigens but also by endogenous cellular
  alarm signals (named DAMPs) released by distressed or injured cells. This insight
  profoundly reshaped our view of the immune system’s responsiveness to cellular distress.
  c The Discovery of TLR4. In 1997, Jules Hoffmann found that mutated “Toll” receptors
  in fruit flies showed increased vulnerability to fungal infections. This discovery
  laid the foundation for understanding the role of Toll-like receptors in the innate
  immune response. In 1998, Alexander Poltorak and his colleagues identified mutations
  in the Tlr4 gene while investigating the defects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling
  in C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mouse strains. This discovery provided definitive evidence
  for the pivotal role of TLR4 in LPS recognition and unveiled its significance in
  the innate immune response of mammals. d The Discovery of other TLRs. Subsequently,
  other TLRs including TLR3, TLR5, and TLR 9 have been discovered in succession during
  2000-2001. e The introduction of the inflammasome. The term “inflammasome” was introduced
  by Jurg Tschopp and his colleagues in 2002. The first inflammasome to be identified
  was NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 1 (NLRP1) in 2002, and NLRP3
  quickly followed this in 2004. f The discovery of cGAS. The cGAS pathway, discovered
  in 2013 by Professor Zhijian Chen, is capable of recognizing pathogenic double-stranded
  DNA molecules and serves as one of the pivotal signals in initiating antiviral innate
  immune defense. This finding obtained the Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research
  in September 2024. This figure is created by BioRender (https://app.biorender.com)
