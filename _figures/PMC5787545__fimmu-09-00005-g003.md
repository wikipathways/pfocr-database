caption: The effect of nutrients at the interface of host immunity. (A) The absence
  of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) impairs the innate immune function due to the
  shortage of lymphocytes and white blood cells. BCAA can also stimulate the secretion
  of SIgA to improve the mucosal surface defense and inhibit pathogen introgression
  into the lamina propria. (B) Trytophan (Trp) is absorbed by intestinal epithelial
  cells (IECs) directly activates the mTOR pathway by intracellular Trp receptors
  through a PI3K/AKT independent mechanism. The active mTOR connects metabolism and
  immunity, promoting cellular processes, and regulating AMPs expression. (C) Fructo-oligosaccharide
  and inulin are considered as prebiotics, affecting IECs to be hyporesponsive to
  activate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)
  and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced by pathogens. Inflammatory response
  to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) would also be attenuated in this process. (D) G. lucidum
  polysaccharides (GLP) can effectively ameliorate the sensitivity of insulin, reducing
  low-grade chronic inflammation and inhibiting the outflux of plasma triglyceride
  and non-esterified fatty acid by suppressing the expression of tumor necrosis factor-a
  (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and hormone-sensitive lipase. (E) After ginseng polysaccharides
  (GS-P) treatment, the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-12
  (IL-12) are increased and the macrophage and NK cell are activated. They both suppress
  the tumor metastasis.
