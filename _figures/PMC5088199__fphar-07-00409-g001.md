caption: 'Cellular pathways currently being targeted in the treatment of endometrial
  cancer (EC) and the potential actionable genes in EC identified via Next Generation
  Sequencing (NGS). Red star depicted genes with clinically cancer-relevant drug interactions
  as defined by DGIdb (). (A) PI(3)K, MAPK, p53 and apoptosis pathway involving PIK3CA,
  PTEN, PPP2R1A, KRAS, P53, and BCL2, (B) cell cycle pathway involving FBXW7 and CCNE1
  as well as (C) DNA replication pathway in eukaryote which involves POLE (DNA polymerase     ).
