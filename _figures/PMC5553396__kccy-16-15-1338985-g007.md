caption: Schematic representation of the regulation of meiosis resumption by ARPP19
  in Xenopus oocytes. ARPP19 is phosphorylated by PKA at S109 in prophase-arrested
  oocytes. The molecular targets of the single S109-phosphorylated form of ARPP19
  that are responsible for the prophase arrest are unknown. Our study shows that S109
  phosphorylation does not prevent ARPP19 phosphorylation at S67 by Gwl. In response
  to progesterone, PKA activity drops down and consequently, ARPP19 is dephosphorylated
  at S109. This event unlocks a signaling pathway that generates a threshold activity
  of Cdk1. Once this starter amount of Cdk1 is formed, it induces Gwl activation that
  in turn phosphorylates ARPP19 at S67. As a consequence, PP2A-B55δ is inhibited and
  the MPF auto-amplification loop is launched. Moreover, ARPP19 is also re-phosphorylated
  at S109 by an unknown kinase distinct of PKA. This phosphorylation contributes to
  M-phase entry. Hence, the active form of ARPP19 that sustains Cdk1 activation does
  not only rely on phosphorylation at S67 as previously thought, but also on its concomitant
  phosphorylation at S109.
