caption: By PPI analysis of 11 DEPs involved in ‘Apoptosis’, ‘Cell adhesion molecules’,
  and ‘Cell cycle’ pathway. Down-regulated proteins (ellipse) and up-regulated proteins
  (diamond) were named by gene/protein name and the width of the arrow is related
  to the relationship score between these proteins
