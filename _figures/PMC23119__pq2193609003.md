caption: Roles of INH-induced genes in the context of a proposed pathway for mycolic
  acid biosynthesis. (a) Mycolic acids of M. tuberculosis are elongated by the multienzyme,
  AcpM-dependent FAS-II complex (, , ). By analogy with the Escherichia coli FAS-II
  system (), the enzymatic steps required for the addition of a two-carbon subunit,
  provided by malonyl-AcpM (highlighted in bold), are shown together with some of
  the proteins that contribute to the process. Activated INH (INH*) is thought to
  inhibit FAS-II by binding to NADH in the pocket of InhA and by forming a covalent,
  ternary complex between KasA and AcpM (, ). The operon-like cluster of genes encoding
  AccD6, FabD, KasA, KasB, and AcpM (red) all were induced by INH (Table ), perhaps
  as a consequence of the depleted meromycolate pool. In contrast, neither fabG nor
  inhA, which are organized into a two-gene cluster at a separate position on the
  chromosome, was induced by INH (Fig. ). (b) A proposed mycolate synthesis pathway
  shows the predicted roles of FAS-II, described above, and FAS-I, which elongates
  short-chain fatty-acyl-CoA esters (, ). The precise fatty acyl intermediates and
  ACP-charging enzymes that mediate the FAS-I to FAS-II transition have not been characterized.
  Meromycolate chains can be functionalized by several different moieties (). For
  clarity, however, only the cyclopropyl-containing meromycolate and the enzymes that
  introduce the distal (Cma1) and proximal (Cma2) moieties are shown (). The mycolyl
  transferase (FbpC) is one of several exported proteins predicted to catalyze the
  transesterification of mycolates to carbohydrate moieties in the cell wall (). Microarray
  hybridization experiments showed that fbpC (red) also was induced by INH treatment.
