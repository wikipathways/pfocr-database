caption: Model for the role of Fra1 and Tsa1 in the MVS pathway. Deletion of mitochondrial
  iron transporter MRS3 and MRS4 results in the generation of oxygen radicals (O−),
  which signals to increase vacuolar transporter Ccc1 activity. Ccc1 imports more
  iron into the vacuole, giving rise to less iron in the cytosol. Low cytosolic iron
  promotes more oxidative damage. Fra1 affects the Ccc1 response to mitochondrial-induced
  oxidant damage by binding to Tsa1 and reducing oxidants.
