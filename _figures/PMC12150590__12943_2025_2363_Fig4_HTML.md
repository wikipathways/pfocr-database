caption: 'Therapeutic strategies of targeted drugs in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
  In recent years, several components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway have
  been identified as promising therapeutic targets. These include: (1) PORCN inhibitors,
  which target PORCN, an O-acyltransferase that disrupts the receptor-binding process
  of Wnt by inhibiting the palmitoylation of the hairpin-2 motif; (2) Fzd inhibitors,
  which bind the cysteine-rich domain of Fzd receptors with an immunoglobulin Fc domain,
  thereby competing with the native Fzds for ligands and antagonizing Wnt signaling;
  (3) LRP5/6 inhibitors, which function either through Dkk1, an endogenous repressor
  of LRP and Fzd-related protein, or by directly antagonizing LRP5/6; (4) Axin stabilizer,
  which inhibit via tankyrase, a family of enzymes that promote Axin degradation via
  the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway; (5) CBP inhibitors, which block the interaction
  between CBP and β-catenin, where CBP acts as a co-activator of Wnt/β-catenin-mediated
  transcription; and (6) iCRTs, which directly bind to the TCF binding site on β-catenin'
