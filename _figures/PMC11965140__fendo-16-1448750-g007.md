caption: The immune regulation of CORT depends on GR signaling and 11β-HSD. CORT continuously
  transmits stress signals into the cell through GR, and stimulates immune cells to
  continuously express pro-inflammatory cytokines through the MAPK signaling pathway
  and FKBP51/NF-κB signaling pathway. In this scenario, on the one hand, pro-inflammatory
  factors change the conformation of GR (GRα to GRβ), and on the other hand, they
  downregulate the expression of GR. Both of these actions interfere with the normal
  functioning of GR and impede the transmission of anti-inflammatory signals. Due
  to compensatory response, the molecular partner of GR, FKBP51, is upregulated. However,
  elevated levels of FKBP51 increase inflammation mediated by NF-κB. In addition,
  it inhibits GRa. Ultimately, these effects collectively promote the progression
  of inflammation. Similarly, due to compensatory response, the increased expression
  of GILZ is to suppress the pro-inflammatory effect of CORT. However, it remains
  unclear whether GILZ can predominate in the complex interplay of numerous signaling
  pathways. In the local tissue, 11β-HSD regulates the effect concentration of CORT.
  11β-HSD1 is beneficial for activating CORT and inhibiting the HPA axis, while 11β-HSD2
  inactivates CORT. High expression levels of 11β-HSD1 were detected in inflammatory
  tissues and immune cells with a pro-inflammatory phenotype, whereas elevated levels
  of 11β-HSD2 were observed in immune cells with an anti-inflammatory phenotype. However,
  due to the persistent toxic effects of CORT, the balance is likely to shift towards
  the pro-inflammatory response mediated by 11β-HSD1
