caption: Predicted rhythmicity of the mitochondrial short-chain, fatty acid elongation
  pathway. The activity of metabolic reactions in a metabolic model was assessed using
  the ‘Fast iMAT’ algorithm of MUFINS using averaged transcriptome samples and the
  human metabolic model Recon2 as input. For each reaction within the metabolic model
  we obtained a predicted metabolic activity profile across the circadian cycle. EC
  numbers represent specific enzymatic reactions. Circles and boxes indicate metabolites
  and reactions, respectively. Red boxes indicate reactions that were identified as
  rhythmic. Lines next to each circadian reaction indicate the dynamics (high or low)
  for each reaction across each of the five biopsy time points.
