caption: 'Inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway, clinically approved for cancer
  treatment. PI3K, Akt, or mTOR inhibitors aim to reduce cell proliferation, growth,
  and biosynthesis, and are indicated by the red blunt-end arrows. Temsirolimus (approved
  in 2007 by the FDA) and everolimus (2009) bind to FKBP12, inhibiting mTORC1, and
  are used mainly in advanced renal and breast cancers. Capivasertib, an Akt inhibitor,
  was approved in 2023 for use in the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative breast
  cancer. Five PI3K inhibitors have been approved for clinical use. Idelalisib (2014),
  umbralisib (2021), and duvelisib (2018) target p110δ or p110 γ/δ PI3K catalytic
  subunits, while copanlisib (2017) is a pan-PI3K inhibitor with predominant activity
  against p110α and p110δ. These inhibitors were approved for use in hematological
  cancers but faced safety-related withdrawals or restrictions: umbralisib and copanlisib
  were withdrawn from the market in 2022 and 2023, respectively, while idelalisib
  and duvelisib had specific approvals revoked and their use has been restricted (*).
  In contrast, the selective p110α inhibitors alpelisib and inavolisib were approved
  in 2019 and 2024, respectively, for the treatment of advanced HR-positive, PIK3CA-mutant
  breast cancer, alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant and inavolisib in combination
  with palbociclib and fulvestrant. FDA, U.S. Food and Drug Administration; FKBP12,
  FK506 binding protein-12; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; RTK, receptor tyrosine
  kinase'
