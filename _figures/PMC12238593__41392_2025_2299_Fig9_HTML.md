caption: Transcriptional and epigenetic regulation and functional dynamics in CD8+
  T cell exhaustion. The illustration depicts the intricate interplay between signaling
  pathways and transcriptional regulators that drive CD8+ T cell exhaustion in the
  TME. Key pathways include the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and the modulation of the
  activity of FOXO1/3 transcription factors. In the nucleus, TCF-1 promotes stemness
  by upregulating genes such as ID-3, EOMES, Bcl-2/6, and c-Myb. Together with TCF-1,
  FOXO1/3 represses effector T cell (Teff) functions by regulating exhaustion-associated
  genes (ID-2, Tbet, Blimp-1, RUNX3, and TCF-7). Exhausted T cells progress through
  a continuum, transitioning from progenitor-like (pro/stem-like Tex) states (PD-1low,
  TCF-1+, and CXCR3+) to terminally exhausted (terminal Tex) states (PD-1hi, TOXhi,
  and TCF-1−). FOXO1/3 also govern antioxidant and proapoptotic genes and regulate
  cell cycle arrest genes, maintaining cellular integrity and upregulating PD-1 and
  TOX. PD-1 and TOX function as central mediators of epigenetic regulation, influencing
  chromatin accessibility and transcriptional programming to stabilize exhaustion
  phenotypes. This PD-1 epigenetic regulation shapes T cell function and metabolic
  fitness within the tumor microenvironment
