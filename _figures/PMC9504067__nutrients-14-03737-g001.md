caption: Metabolic alterations in diabetic patients. At the molecular level, insulin
  resistance causes an increase in both plasma glucose and serum insulin levels, which
  lead to a reduction in glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), and a decrease in glucose
  uptake. These events lead to a reduction in the glycolysis pathway and glucose oxidation
  caused by the downregulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The hyperglycaemia
  is associated with the concomitant increase in hematic fatty acid concentration
  and the consequent upregulation of fatty acids uptake and oxidation due to the decreased
  levels of malonyl CoA and the consequent activation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1 (CPT1). CD36—cluster of differentiation 36; ACC—Acetyl-CoA carboxylase; MCD—Malonyl-CoA
  decarboxylase; CTP1—carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1; CTP2—carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  2; MCP—mitochondrial pyruvate carrier; CT—carnitine translocase; PDH—pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex; GLUT4—glucose transporter type 4.
