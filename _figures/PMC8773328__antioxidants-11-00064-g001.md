caption: 'Schematic diagram of the various interaction sites of TRPV1 and the mechanism
  underlying the neuroprotective effect of naringin in the pain pathway: (A) one subunit
  of TRPV1 has six transmembrane domains (yellow) and a pore loop (S5–S6). TRPV1 can
  function only when these four subunits form a tetramer. The light blue circle is
  the location where the proton binds to TRPV1. The pepper-shaped symbol is the site
  where vanilloids such as capsaicin bind. The star shape is the binding site of naringin
  found in our present study. (B) The pain transmission pathway. The signal transduction
  process of pain involves three stages. Electrical signals are transmitted from the
  first-order neurons (yellow neurons) to the third-order neurons (red neurons), and
  finally, the brain perceives the pain. The blue receptor symbol is TRPV1 and marks
  the tissue location where it is expressed. (C) Naringin has a cytoprotective effect
  mediated through inhibition of neuronal hyperexcitation and oxidative stress via
  TRPV. The death of neuronal cells remains a permanent error in the signaling system,
  resulting in neuropathic pain. GSH is glutathione, MDA is malondialdehyde, SOD is
  superoxide dismutase, CAT is catalase, and GST is glutathione-S-transferase.'
