caption: PGRN Inhibits B‐cell Activation and IgE Production through the PGRN‐IFITM3‐STAT1
  Signaling Pathway. A) The volcano plot illustrates the differential gene expression
  between WT and PGRN KO mice, displaying log2 fold change (log2FC) on the x‐axis
  and –log10(Q) values on the y‐axis for each gene, with colors representing different
  levels of significance. B) Differentially expressed (DE) genes overlapping with
  BCR‐associated genes from the KEGG database are highlighted. C) The mRNA levels
  of Ifitm3 in B cells from WT and PGRN KO mice are shown (n = 9). D) Western blot
  analysis shows the expression of 14‐3‐3σ and IFITM3 in B cells from WT and PGRN
  KO mice, using β‐actin as a loading control. The blots shown are representative
  of three independent experiments. E‐F) Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was
  performed on purified splenic B cells from WT mice, followed by DNA purification
  and PCR (left) and real‐time PCR (right) using primers specific to the 14‐3‐3σ promoter.
  G) A luciferase reporter assay was conducted in HEK293T cells to assess the regulation
  of 14‐3‐3σ promoter activity, utilizing the pGL3‐14‐3‐3σ promoter and pAd5‐E1‐CMV‐STAT1
  plasmid. H) Western blot analysis of pSTAT5, STAT5, pIKKβ, IKKβ, pP65, and P65 in
  B cells from WT and PGRN KO mice following in vitro stimulation with soluble antigen,
  with representative blots from three independent experiments. I) Western blot analysis
  of pSTAT1 and pPI3K levels in B cells from WT and PGRN KO mice treated with caraphenol
  A, using total protein as a control; representative blots are from three independent
  experiments. J) Western blot analysis showing the expression of 14‐3‐3σ and IFITM3
  in B cells from WT and PGRN KO mice treated with caraphenol A, with β‐actin or total
  protein as controls; blots represent three independent experiments. K,L) Flow cytometry
  data showing levels of IgE and IgG1 in B cells from WT, PGRN KO, and PGRN KO mice
  treated with the STAT1 inhibitor Fludarabine after a 5‐day in vitro stimulation
  with anti‐CD40 antibody and IL‐4 (n = 3). M,N) Flow cytometry data displaying IgE
  and IgG1 levels in B cells from WT, PGRN KO, and PGRN KO mice treated with the IFITM3
  inhibitor caraphenol A following a 5‐day in vitro stimulation with anti‐CD40 antibody
  and IL‐4 (n = 5). O) Flow cytometric analysis of B‐cell subsets within PBMCs from
  healthy controls (HCs) and asthma patients, quantifying the percentages of naive
  B, memory B, transitional B, and plasmablast cells (n = 6). P) A schematic overview
  of the house dust mite (HDM)‐induced asthma mouse model. Q) Proportions of B cells
  gated from O. R) Serum IgE levels in HCs and asthma patients (n = 10). S) PBMCs
  from HCs and asthma patients were labeled with APC‐anti‐CD19 antibody, followed
  by biotin‐conjugated F(ab’)2 Ig(M+G) and streptavidin, then stimulated at 37 °C.
  Following stabilization and permeabilization, mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs)
  of pY and pBTK were measured via flow cytometry (n = 10). T) Western blot analysis
  shows PGRN, 14‐3‐3σ, and IFITM3 expression in WT and asthma model mice, as well
  as in HCs and asthma patients, with β‐actin as a control; blots are representative
  of three independent experiments. U) Western blot analysis of B cells from WT, asthma
  model mice, and asthma model mice treated with PGRN in vitro, assessing pPI3K, pCD19,
  pBTK, and 14‐3‐3σ expression, using β‐actin as the control. Blots are from three
  independent experiments. V) ELISA analysis of serum IgE levels in WT mice, asthma
  model mice, and asthma model mice treated with PGRN in vivo (n = 6)
