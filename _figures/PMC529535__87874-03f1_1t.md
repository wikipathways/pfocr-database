caption: Two models relating Akt and Tsc2 in cell growth control in Drosophila. (A)
  In the linear model, insulin signaling activates Akt, which phosphorylates and inactivates
  the Tsc1–Tsc2 complex. Inactivation of the Tsc1–Tsc2 complex by Akt in turn promotes
  cell growth through Rheb, TOR, and S6K/4E-BP. This model suggests that signals from
  Akt to S6K/4E-BP are all transduced through Tsc1–Tsc2 and TOR. (B) In the parallel
  model, the nutrient-sensitive TOR pathway converges with the canonical insulin pathway
  to regulate translation regulators in cell growth such as S6K and 4E-BP. This model
  suggests that TOR and the insulin/Akt pathways provide parallel inputs in cell growth
  control.
