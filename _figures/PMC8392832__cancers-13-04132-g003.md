caption: 'Rationale for targeting theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ) in PARPi-resistant
  breast cancers. The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is responsible for the repair
  of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) breaks. The PARP inhibitors inhibit the catalytic
  activity of PARP and can trap PARP proteins on the DNA. These bulky complexes impede
  the progression of DNA replication forks, which stall, leads to unloading of the
  replicative helicase and DNA polymerases, and creates a single-ended DSB. When a
  converging fork is coming, a double-ended DSB is generated. This DSB can be resolved
  by a functional HR machinery, leading to cell survival. When HR is defective, the
  damage persists, leading to cell death. One mechanism explaining primary or secondary
  resistance to PARPi relies on the activation of the alternative Polθ-mediated End-Joining
  (TMEJ) DSB repair pathway which can rescue HR defect. Abbreviations: HR = homologous
  recombination; ssDNA = single-stranded DNA.'
