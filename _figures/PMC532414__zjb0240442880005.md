caption: 'Proposed pathway for the synthesis of C20-C20 diether lipids in M. burtonii.
  Enzymes are boxed, and metabolites are shown without boxes. Shown are proteins detected
  from the expressed proteome (black boxes), gene products identified from the M.
  burtonii genome (grey boxes), and gene products in the pathway not identified in
  the draft genome (open boxes). Abbreviations used are as follows: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  (HMG-CoA), phosphate (P), isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), dimethylallyl diphosphate
  (DMAPP), geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  (GGPP), geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate (GGGP), digeranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate
  (DGGGP), glycerol-1-phosphate (G-1-P). Gene identification numbers (contig number[lowem]gene
  number) are as follows: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (69_2078), HMG-CoA synthase (69_2077),
  HMG-CoA reductase (68_1665), mevalonate kinase (48_216), diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase
  (66_1376), IPP isomerase (48_218), GGPP synthase (65_1217), FPP synthase (66_1469),
  G-1-P dehydrogenase (68_1720), GGGP synthase (63_1054), myo-inositol-1 phosphate
  synthase (48_170), CDP-diacyl-G-3-P transferase (70_2290), CDP-diacyl-inositol transferase
  (69_2036).'
