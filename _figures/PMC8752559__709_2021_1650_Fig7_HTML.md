caption: Demonstration of metabolic synergy in two cell strains of Catharanthus roseus
  differing in their metabolic potencies. a Representative HPLC–DAD-ESI–MS/MS spectra
  for intracellular alkaloids from MeJA-elicitated cell strains C1 and C4, growing
  exclusively or in combination. The depicted extracted ion chromatograms are specific
  to different alkaloids; m/z 337 (catharanthine (CAT) and tabersonine (TAB)) and
  m/z 457 (vindoline (VDL)). b Simplified of the terpene-indole alkaloid pathway in
  C. roseus, and the differential partitioning of the branches in the two cell strains.
  R(C4) indicates a hypothetical regulatory factor from C4 cells that is able to advance
  the conversion of tabersonine into vindoline in C1 cells
