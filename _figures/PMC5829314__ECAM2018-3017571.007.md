caption: Schematic plot of the possible mechanisms behind the protective and therapeutic
  effects of AM/SM on LPS-induced ALI. AM/SM downregulated the TLR-4/IRAK-1/NF-κB
  signaling pathway; then inflammatory cytokines were decreased. Pulmonary edema and
  lung tissue damage were alleviated at last.
