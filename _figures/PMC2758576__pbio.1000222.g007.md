caption: (A) Model for the honeybee sex determination pathway that controls both soma
  and germ cells. The heterozygous or homo-/hemizygous state of the csd gene determines
  whether Csd protein is active. Active Csd proteins, derived from different csd alleles
  in females, are splicing factors that direct the processing into female fem mRNAs.
  Female fem mRNAs (femF) are producing active Fem proteins that are required to mediate
  the splicing of Am-dsx pre-mRNA into the female mRNAs. The Fem protein has an additional
  positive feedback activity that directs the processing of femF mRNAs. Inactive CSD
  proteins, when derived from homo- or hemizygous csd alleles, result in a splicing
  of the fem and dsx transcripts, which is the default male state (femM, Am-dsxM).
  (B) Model for the sex determination pathway in Ceratitis capitata ,. The presence
  or absence of an unidentified factor M determines sex. In the absence of M the maternal
  provided Cc-tra gene product establishes an autoregulative loop in which Cc-Tra
  protein mediates the production of female Cc-tra mRNA. The Cc-Tra protein directs
  the splicing of Cc-dsx pre-mRNA into the female mode. The presence of M impairs
  the positive autoregulative loop of the Cc-tra gene products producing a default
  splicing pattern of Cc-tra transcripts, the male pre-mRNA. The male Cc-dsx mRNA
  is produced by default. (C) Simplified view of the somatic sex determination hierarchy
  in D. melanogaster . The X∶A ratio determines whether Sxl is activated. Sxl protein
  in females is a splicing factor that directs the splicing of tra pre-mRNA into the
  female mode, resulting in the production of active Tra protein in females. Tra protein
  mediates the processing of female dsx mRNAs. In the absence of Sxl protein all these
  regulatory decisions do not occur and the male dsxM is produced by default. The
  male and female dsx transcripts encode sex-specific transcription factors that have
  several target genes and are involved in various aspects of sexual differentiation.
  (D) The evolutionary relationship of the species used in the comparison with their
  approximate time scale of divergence.
