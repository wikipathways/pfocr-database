caption: 'ROS production is induced mainly by mitochondria in response to genotoxic
  stress, chronical viral infections, tumor hypoxia, or cancer chemotherapeutic drugs.
  ROS may cause different biological consequences: (1) ROS induce DNA double strand
  breaks (DSB) directly. DSBs activate DNA repair mechanisms and autophagy mediated
  by ATM, PARP1, and/or p53. Autophagy promotes DNA repair and alleviates oxidative
  stress, so as to favor cancer cell survival, by degrading p62 that inhibits DNA
  repair through interacting with RNF168 and promoting proteasome-mediated degradation
  of DNA repair proteins such as RAD51 and CHK1. (2) ROS promote p62 expression through
  the Keap1-NRF2 pathway, and consequently induction of p62-mediated autophagy. In
  turn, phosphorylated p62 (Ser349) by mTOR positively regulates NRF2 stability and
  activity through competing with Keap1 for NRF2 binding. (3) ROS produced in tumor
  hypoxia stabilize the transcription factor HIF1α, leading to the transcriptional
  activation of BNIP3, consequently promotes autophagy induction by repressing the
  Beclin1-Bcl2 interaction; (4) ROS can activate NFκB that inhibits BNIP3 transcription
  or induces production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.'
