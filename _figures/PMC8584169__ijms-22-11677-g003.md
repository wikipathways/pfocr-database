caption: Glutamate (Glu) and GABA in glia–neuron cross-talk. Presynaptic [R] and extrasynaptic
  [r] receptors. Glutamate is synthesized from glutamine (Gln) by phosphate-activated
  glutaminase (PAG) and then is packed into synaptic vesicles by vesicular glutamate
  transporters (VGLUT1/2). After release into the synaptic cleft, glutamate binds
  to neuronal postsynaptic receptors for glutamate (ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate
  (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA), kainate (KA),
  and metabotropic mGluR1/5), to presynaptic receptors (ionotropic NMDA, AMPA, KA,
  and metabotropic mGluR7), and extrasynaptic receptors (mGluR2/3/4/8), but also to
  microglial receptors (NMDA, AMPA, KA, and mGluR2–8). Glutamate is also released
  by microglia via gap-junction hemichannels (e.g., Cx32) and by astrocytes via NMDA
  and purinergic P2X7 receptors, plasma membrane glutamate transporters, anion transporters,
  gap-junction hemichannels, and exocytosis. The major uptake of glutamate is performed
  by astrocytes via excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT1/2). In astrocytes, glutamate
  is converted to glutamine by the glutamine synthetase (GS) pathway. Then, glutamine
  is transferred from astrocytes back to the neurons. GABA is synthesized from glutamate
  by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and then is packed into synaptic vesicles by the
  vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). After release into the synaptic cleft, GABA binds
  to neuronal ionotropic GABAA (pre-, post-, and extrasynaptic), GABAc (pre- and postsynaptic),
  and metabotropic GABAB (pre-, post-, and extrasynaptic) receptors, but also to microglial
  GABAA/B. Both presynaptic nerve terminals and surrounding glial cells are responsible
  for the uptake of GABA from extracellular space. In glia, GABA is converted to glutamine,
  and then it is transferred back to the neurons and converted to glutamate, and finally
  to GABA.
