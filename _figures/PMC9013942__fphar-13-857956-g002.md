caption: Hepatoprotective effects of celastrol in HFD induced animal model (edited
  by Biorender software). Diagram of the mechanism of celastrol in regulating hepatic
  energy expenditure, inflammation, and lipid metabolism. Under HFD stress, celastrol
  attenuated inflammation by inducing Nur77 interaction with TRAF2 to promote mitochondrial
  autophagy. Macrophages mediated inflammation was also ameliorated by celastrol targeted
  CAP1 via inhibition of cAMP-PKA-NF-κB signaling pathway, and macrophage M1 polarization
  was suppressed by celastrol via regulating Nrf2-HO-1-NF-κB pathways. In addition,
  celastrol can also regulate metabolism disorder. On the one hand, it can promote
  energy metabolism by activating HSF1-PGC1α; on the other hand, it can target SIRT1
  to promote AMPK α phosphorylation and inhibit Srebp-1c-mediated lipid synthesis
  against oxidative stress and inflammation TRAF2, TNFR-associated factor2; CAP1,
  adenylyl cyclase-associated; protein 1 cAMP, cyclic adenylate monophosphate; PKA,
  protein kinase A; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B; Srebp-1c, sterol regulatory element
  binding protein 1c; AMPKα, AMP-activated protein kinase α.
