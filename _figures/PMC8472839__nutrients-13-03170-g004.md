caption: 'Alcohol-induced inflammation. Alcohol exerts its effects on both the innate
  and adaptive immunity. Alcohol not only induces enteric dysbiosis, but also increases
  intestinal permeability. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interact with TLR4 receptor on Kupffer cells and produce
  proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines via the NF-κB pathway, leading to liver
  inflammation. Acetaldehyde induces structural changes in various proteins and generates
  neoantigens, which elicit an adaptive immune response and contribute to liver inflammation.
