caption: Plant cyanogenic glycoside and glucosinolate synthetic pathway (top) and
  bacterial aldoxime-nitrile pathway (bottom), initiating from l-Phe. E,Z-PAOx, E,Z-phenylacetaldoxime;
  PAN, phenylacetonitrile; MAN, R,S-mandelonitrile; FMO, flavin-containing monooxygenase.
  The involvement of FMO (bottom, dashed arrow) was predicted by the recent studies
  of S. coelicolor FMO acting on l-Trp (). The pathways used for the production of
  PAN in this study are shown in gray boxes.
