caption: Multi-layer regulation of Rbp35 in M. oryzae. Three different transcripts
  are produced at the RBP35 gene locus, the RBP35 mRNA and two smaller RNAs derived
  from the 5′ UTR, namely, uORF1 and uORF2. The uORF1 controls M. oryzae growth activated
  by the TOR pathway. Translation of the mRNA generates the full-length isoform of
  the protein, Rbp35A. This step is regulated by its C-terminal Met-Asn-Gly domain.
  Post-translational processing of Rbp35A generates a second isoform Rbp35B, which
  interacts with both Rbp35A and CfI25 within the fungal CfI25/Rbp35 complex. The
  processing site of the protein is after the RGG region. Cleavage efficiency, localization
  and degradation processes are regulated by the RGG domain.
