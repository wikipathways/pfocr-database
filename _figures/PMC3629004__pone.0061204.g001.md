caption: Endogenously synthesized mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are converted
  from saturated fatty acids (SFA) by the catalyzing effect of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1
  (SCD1). A MUFA is added to a lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) through lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase (LPCAT) to produce a phosphatidylcholine (PC) that contains MUFA
  (MUFA-PC). A MUFA-PC is degraded to a LPC and a MUFA by phospholipase A1 (PLA1)
  and PLA2.
