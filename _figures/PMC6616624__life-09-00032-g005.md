caption: 'Main energy metabolism and carbon/nitrogen fluxes in heterocysts. The OPPP
  (oxidative pentose phosphate pathway) and the Krebs cycle are the major routes used
  by heterocysts to generate reducing equivalents, while glycolysis has a smaller
  contribution. Metalloenzymes (red circles) and enzymes catalyzing reactions that
  generate (yellow circles) or require (green circles) NAD(P)H are indicated. Abbreviations
  for metabolites: Suc, sucrose; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate;
  F1,6P, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phopshate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  Ac-coA, acetyl-coA; Mal, malate; OA, oxaloacetate; Cit, citrate; Isocit, isocitrate;
  2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate. Abbreviations for enzymes: G6PD, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; FBA, class-II fructose bisphosphate aldolase;

  oxidoreductase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; CS, citrate synthase; AcnB, aconitase,

  and the reported transfer to vegetative cells of the cyanophycin-derived dipeptide
