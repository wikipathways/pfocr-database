figtitle: Bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome data sets for aortae obtained from
  aged ApoE −/− mice fed a high‐fat diet revealed 50 overlapping genes that are enriched

caption: A, Two transcriptome data sets derived from studies on atherosclerosis were
  retrieved from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. One compares the gene
  expression profile of aortae from normal diet‐ and high fat diet–fed ApoE −/− mice
  (GSE18443), and the other (GSE10000) compares the gene expression profile of aortae
  between young and aged ApoE −/− mice. DEGs (adjusted P<0.05) in these 2 data sets
  were screened and compared with the overlapping DEGs, which were then subjected
  to Gene Ontology pathway analysis. The Venn diagram illustrates the overlay of DEGs
  (3115) between hypercholesterolemia (high‐fat diet vs normal diet) and aging (young
  vs old); 50 DEGs were enriched for ER stress, while 9 were associated with UPR‐related
  pathways. The overlapping upregulated or downregulated DEGs in these 2 groups are
  illustrated in the Venn diagram. B, List of overlapping UPR‐related genes in both
  aging and high fat diet–fed mice. DEGs indicates differentially expressed genes;
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; and UPR, unfolded protein response.
