caption: D+ synthesis pathways. In the De novo biosynthetic pathway, tryptophan is
  converted to quinolinic acid in 6 steps of enzymatic reactions, which is then converted
  to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) by the enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase
  (QPRT). The Preiss-Handler pathway is initiated by NA phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAPRT) to form NAMN. NAMN is further converted to NA adenine dinucleotide (NAAD)
  by NMN adenylyl transferase enzymes (NMNAT1-3). Finally, NAAD is converted to NAD+
  via an amidation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme NAD+ synthase (NADSYN). The Core
  Recycling and Salvage Pathways are the shortest pathways for NAD+ synthesis from
  NAM and NR (2 steps). NAM is converted to NMN by the rate-limiting nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT). NMN is also a product of NR phosphorylation
  by NR kinases (NRK1-2). The subsequent conversion of NMN to NAD+ is catalyzed by
  NMNAT1-3 enzymes. Further, the synthesized NAD+ is used in the functioning of NAD+-dependent
  enzymes (SIRTs, PARPs). As a result of their reaction (deacetylation, poly-ADP-ribosylation,
  respectively), NAM is formed again, which later turns into NMN using the intracellular
  form of NAM-phosphoribosyltransferase. NA, nicotinic acid; NAAD, NA adenine dinucleotide;
  NADSYN, NAD+ synthetase; NAM, nicotinamide; NAMN, NA mononucleotide; NMN, NAM mononucleotide;
  NMNAT, NMN adenylyltransferase; NR, nicotinamide riboside; NRK, NR kinase.
