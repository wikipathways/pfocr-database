caption: 'The roles of the kinesin-12, 13, 14 family members in HCC. (A) Kinesin-12
  family: KIF15 interacts with proteasome 26 S subunit, non-ATPase 12 (PSMD12) and
  is stimulated by it. And the regulative impacts of KIF15 on HCC cells growth, proliferation,
  migration, and chemo-resistance have been linked to the MEK/ERK signaling. Furthermore,
  KIF15 also eliminates intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and
  facilitates tumor stem cell phenotype by interacting with phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
  (PHGDH) and stabilizing its expression via inhibiting proteasomal degradation. (B)
  Kinesin-13 family: KIF2C mediated cross-talk between WNT/β-catenin and mTORC1 signaling:
  WNT/β-catenin signaling caused transcriptional up-regulation of KIF2C when TCF4
  bound to the KIF2C promoter. Subsequently, KIF2C interacted with TBC1D7 causing
  destabilization of TSC1/2 and reduced the anti-oncogenic effect of TSC2 on mTORC1
  signaling transduction, finally promoted tumor development. Moreover, the pro-tumor
  impacts of KIF2C might also be attributed to its latent regulatory function in the
  Ras/MAPK and MEK/ERK signaling axes. Another family member KIF2A, negatively regulated
  by miR-424-5p, has also been demonstrated to facilitate malignant progression via
  the Notch 1 signaling, in which KIF2A interacts with Notch 1 and positively regulates
  its expression. (C) Kinesin-14 family: Similar to KIF2C, KIFC1 can also be transcriptionally
  up-regulated by TCF4, and aberrant activation of KIFC1 facilitates HCC progression
  through enhancing the transcriptional activity of High Mobility Group AT-Hook 1
  (HMGA1), which regulates several cancer-related genes transcription (including STAT3,
  MMP2, E-cadherin, Vimentin, Twist1) by binding to their corresponding promoter regions.
  Besides, KIFC1 also participates in the stimulation of PI3K/Akt signaling via up-regulating
  the expression of gankyrin. Similarly, miR-532-3p plays an inhibitory role in this
  process by directly suppressing KIFC1 expression. As for KIFC3, it has also been
  demonstrated to stimulate HCC development through activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
  pathway'
