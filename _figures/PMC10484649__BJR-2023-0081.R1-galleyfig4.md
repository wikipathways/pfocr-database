caption: 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway in subchondral bone.
  The MAPK family consists of three kinases: extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK), stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase.
  ERK signal transduction mediates the early and late differentiation of osteoblasts
  by phosphorylating key transcription factors (such as runt-related transcription
  factor 2 (RUNX2)) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Moreover, p38 signal
  transduction can also promote osteoblast differentiation through phosphorylation
  of distal-less homeo box 5 (DLX5), Osterix, and RUNX2. ERK, p38, and JNK all promote
  osteoclast differentiation by regulating activating protein 1 (AP-1) as a key medium
  for osteoclast formation. In addition, the upregulation of a disintegrin-like and
  metalloproteinase with thrombospondin (ADAMTS) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
  mediated by the activation of ERK signalling pathway plays an important role in
  the early development of osteoarthritis.'
