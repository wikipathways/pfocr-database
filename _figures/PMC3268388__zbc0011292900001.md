caption: LDs serve as virion assembly platforms during HCV replication. Upper panel,
  during the HCV life cycle, infectious lipoviroparticles enter hepatocytes through
  receptor-mediated endocytosis. Upon uncoating and release, the viral RNA is translated
  at the ER to produce one polyprotein that is cleaved by host and viral proteases,
  releasing the 10 viral proteins. The viral non-structural proteins (NS3–NS5B) form
  RNA replication complexes within ER-derived membranous structures termed the membranous
  web. After encapsidation of newly synthesized viral RNA, viroparticles bud into
  the ER lumen, mature through interactions with lipoproteins, and exit the cell via
  the secretory pathway. The lower left panel depicts trafficking of the viral core
  protein. After translation, the viral nucleocapsid core at the N-terminal end of
  the polyprotein is released by two subsequent cleavages (signal peptidase (SP) and
  signal peptide peptidase (SPP)), enabling core to traffic along the ER membrane.
  Through interaction with DGAT1, core is loaded onto LDs in a DGAT1-dependent manner.
  TG, triglyceride. The lower right panel shows a model of HCV assembly at LDs. Core
  is thought to recruit viral RNA replication complexes (RC) to ER membranes close
  to LDs, where the viral RNA is encapsidated by core.
