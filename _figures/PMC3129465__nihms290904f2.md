caption: EoE risk variants near TSLP and in the TSLP receptor (TSLPR) gene (CRLF2)
  highlight a potential role for the TSLP pathway in EoE. SNPs in other key genes
  such as CCL26, TGFB1 and FLG can affect multiple aspects of EoE pathogenesis, including
  eosinophil chemotaxis, fibrosis and smooth muscle dysfunction, and decreased esophageal
  barrier function, respectively.
