caption: Working model of an integrated axon degeneration signaling cascade. Injury
  leads to SARM1 activation () and NMNAT2 depletion (). PHR1 promotes NMNAT2 turnover,
  leading to faster depletion (; ). Activated SARM1 promotes NAD+ depletion () and
  NMNAT2 loss prevents NAD+ synthesis and causes an increased NMN to ATP+ADP+AMP ratio,
  which may activate SARM1 (). NAD+ loss leads to glycolytic failure and ATP depletion.
  SARM1 also activates MAPK pathway signaling (), which promotes SCG10 proteolysis
  () and contributes to ATP depletion, perhaps via NAD+ depletion. MAPK activation
  is counteracted by injury-stimulated ATK1 activity (), and AKT is in turn destabilized
  by ZNRF1 (). Energetic failure promotes ionic imbalance including intraaxonal calcium
  accumulation, leading to calpain activation and proteolysis of intermediate filaments
  in the axonal cytoskeleton (). Cumulative structural damage leads to irreversible
  fragmentation of the damaged axon (). Arrows with questions marks (?) reflect postulated
  interactions.

  description: Working model of an integrated axon degeneration signaling cascade.
    Injury leads to SARM1 activation () and NMNAT2 depletion (). PHR1 promotes NMNAT2
    turnover, leading to faster depletion (; ). Activated SARM1 promotes NAD+ depletion
    () and NMNAT2 loss prevents NAD+ synthesis and causes an increased NMN to ATP+ADP+AMP

    MAPK activation is counteracted by injury-stimulated ATK1 activity (), and AKT

    including intraaxonal calcium accumulation, leading to calpain activation and
