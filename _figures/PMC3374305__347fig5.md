caption: Rho1 in cell wall remodeling, exocytosis, and cytokinesis. Cell wall stresses
  are sensed by membrane proteins (gray), which activate Rho1-GEFs. Mss4 synthesizes
  PI(4,5)P2 at the PM (gray line), which recruits GEFs via their PH domains. Activated
  Rho1 controls cell wall assembly by directly activating glucan synthases (Fks1 and
  Fks2) and by activating the Pkc1-MAPK–mediated CWI pathway, which induces expression
  of cell-wall synthetic enzymes. Rho1 also regulates exocytosis and cytokinesis via
  Sec3 and Bni1. In response to heat stress, Rho1 and Pkc1 cause transient actin depolarization,
  and the MAPK pathway promotes subsequent actin repolarization. Modified from ()
