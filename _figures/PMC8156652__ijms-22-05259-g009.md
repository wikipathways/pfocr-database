caption: The proposed model of the role of the ILPR-mediated and IIS signaling pathways
  in the growth regulation of C. gigas. The binding of the insulin-like peptide to
  its receptor (ILPR) induces conformational changes in the alpha and beta subunits
  of the receptor. The IRS binds to the activated sites of the beta subunits and transduces
  signal to the cell through the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways. The other
  elements, including PTEN, GSK3β, FoxO, and TOR, could regulate the activation of
  the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in C. gigas through a similar mechanism as in vertebrates.
  The rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 (TOR complex 1) activates the translational regulator
  S6K (S6 kinase), leading to increased protein synthesis in the presence of nutrients,
  and the S6K could inhibit the activity of the IRS, finally regulating the PI3K-AKT
  and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways. Arrow (black line) and inhibitory sign (red line)
  indicate promotion and suppression, respectively.
