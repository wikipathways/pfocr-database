caption: Human lung-derived microvascular endothelial cells. Top pathway map following
  brominated lipids treatment is shown. Human lung microvascular endothelial cells
  were incubated with vehicle, 2-bromopalmitic acid (10 µM), and 2-bromopalmitaldehyde
  (10 µM) or their corresponding nonbrominated compounds for 30 min, and cell lysates
  were prepared as indicated in materials and methods for discovery proteomics analysis.
  The most significant signaling pathways were then identified using GeneGo MetaCore;
  these were from the 106 proteins found to be significantly changed in abundance
  by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (; Supplemental Table S6) in addition
  to immunotargeted proteins for which phosphorylation status or location/disruption
  were confirmed (immunocytoflourescence and Western blot analysis). The top pathway
  included cytoskeleton remodeling, regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization
  by the kinase effectors of Rho GTPases. The primary proteins identified in the pathway
  shown include α-actinin, ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins, talin, myosin
  heavy chain (MyHC), RhoA, ROCK, actin cytoskeletal, vinculin, RhoA-related, F-actin
  cytoskeleton, and moesin (MSN). The figure key can be found in Supplemental Fig.
