caption: Schematic representation of signaling pathways downstream urokinase-type
  plasminogen activator (uPA) receptor (uPAR) and its co-receptors. uPAR is anchored
  to the plasma membrane and binds specifically to uPA. uPA can catalyze the process
  from plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin cleaves and activates matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs). Both plasmin and MMPs degrade many extracellular matrix (ECM) components.
  Extracellularly, the binding of uPAR with vitronectin promotes cell adhesion and
  migration. Intracellularly, due to the lack of transmembrane and cytosolic domains,
  uPAR binds to lateral partners for signal transduction thus resulting in the activation
  of multiple signaling pathways that mediate a variety of cellular responses. In
  particular, uPAR binding to formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), a family of G protein-coupled
  receptors, activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)
  pathway thus promoting the proliferative process. Additional, uPAR/integrin interaction
  promotes the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase
  that plays a critical role in integrin-mediated signal transduction. Once activated,
  FAK turns on signaling pathways including the rat sarcoma (Ras)/mitogen activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1)/MAPK, PI3K/AKT
  and janus kinase 1 (JAK1) pathways, which are involved in directing cellular responses
  to a wide array of stimuli. In addition, FAK activation by uPAR/integrin recruits
  proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (Src) family tyrosine kinase to enhance the
  phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in response to VEGF, which in turn activates
  both the PI3K/AKT and the JAK1 pathways. Signaling pathways downstream to uPAR interaction
  with its lateral partners concur to activate transcription factors including nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB), cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB), HIF-1 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  of which NF-κB, HIF-1 and STAT3 activate the transcription of pro-angiogenic and
  inflammatory genes, while CREB is involved in the transcription of inflammatory
  genes. In addition, both NF-κB and HIF-1 mediate the transcription of the uPA/uPAR
  genes.
