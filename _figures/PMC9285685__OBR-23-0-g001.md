caption: 'Obesity, aromatase and breast cancer: a mechanistic overview. Leptin, insulin‐like
  growth factor 1 (IGF‐1), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α,
  and interleukin (IL) 1β by the binding with their own receptors could stimulate,
  via promoter II/I.3, aromatase (Arom) cytochrome P450 (CYP19) gene expression and
  enzymatic activity in breast cancer cells via transcriptional regulatory mechanisms
  (1). Aromatase activity is also amplified by estradiol (E2) at posttranscriptional
  levels through an increase of tyrosine protein phosphorylation (P) mediated by:
  an enhanced cross‐talk with growth factor receptor (GFR) and the tyrosine‐kinase
  c‐src transduction signalings (2); an activation of PI3K/Akt pathway and a subsequent
  inhibition of the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B) catalytic
  activity that impairs PTP1B ability to dephosphorylate aromatase (3). Overall, these
  events lead to increased aromatase expression/activity, estrogen production/biovailability
  and estrogen receptor (ER) α activity. TFs: Transcription factors, T: Testosterone'
