caption: Schematic model put forward the potential role of P4HB at different GBM cell
  states to TMZ treatment. ER stress is induced during the treatment of TMZ to TMZ-sensitive
  GBM cells and activates the proapopotic UPR signaling pathway. We hypothesize that
  P4HB as an ER chaperone will be dissociated from one of the ER stressor PERK, so
  as to enhance binding to the unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Dissociation of
  P4HB from the ER stress transducer will trigger the PERK-eIF2α pathway by inducing
  the transcription of ATF4 which in turn enhancing the expression of proapoptotic
  CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP). CHOP will subsequently
  activate the apoptotic machinery consisting of Bax, caspase-3 and -7, leading to
  cell death. In TMZ-resistant GBM cells, the presence of high level of P4HB is sufficiently
  bound to the unfolded proteins, therefore no induction of proapoptotic UPR signaling
  by ER stress. Nevertheless, P4HB inhibition can alternatively resensitize TMZ-resistant
  GBM cells to TMZ because of the insufficient P4HB binding to misfolded proteins.
  After prolonged ER stress, UPR induced apoptosis will be activated.
