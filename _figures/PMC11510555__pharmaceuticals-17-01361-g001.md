caption: Mechanism of action of ponatinib in treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
  Ponatinib effectively binds to the BCR-ABL1 protein, including the T315I mutant
  form, while other tyrosine kinase inhibitors are ineffective. Ponatinib occupies
  the ATP-binding site of BCR-ABL1, preventing ATP from binding and thus inhibiting
  the protein’s kinase activity. This blockade disrupts the signaling pathway that
  leads to CML, effectively halting the progression of the disease
