caption: 'A. Decoding of pathway-specific effector combinations occurs through sequential
  logic gates that involve pre-transcriptional mechanisms, such as (left top) NFκB
  and ISGF3 forming a sequential OR gate, allowing sustained responses, (left bottom)
  IRF3-mediated nucleosome movement for Ccl5, allowing NFκB binding and forming a
  sequential AND gate, and (right) posttranscriptional mechanisms combining NFκB-induced
  transcription AND MAPKp38 processing and stabilization of Tnf mRNA.B. Coherent feedforward
  loops, where one regulator positively controls a target and another positive regulator.
  Left: NFκB induces transcription of Cebpd, which activates a second wave of response
  genes controlled by both NFκB and CEPBδ. Here, coherent FFLs combined with AND gates
  allow duration decoding. Right: Similarly, IRF3-induced Ifnb1 generates a coherent
  feedforward loop through activation of IFNAR and subsequently ISGF3, which binds
  similar gene promoters as IRF3.C. Incoherent feedforward loops, where one regulator
  positively controls a target as well as a negative regulator. Together with combinatorial
  decoding principles they allow for fold change detection and mediate biphasic responses.
  Left: NFκB-induced expression of the competing p50:p50 homodimer provides memory
  of previous NFκB abundances for fold-change detection on NFκB target genes such
  as Il8. Right: NFκB-induced transcription of Atf3, which in turn represses NFκB
  target genes. This results in the diminishing of the second phase of response gene
  expression when NFκB activity is high.Corner arrow indicates active transcription.'
