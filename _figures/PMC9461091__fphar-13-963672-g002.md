caption: Insulin mechanisms in cardiac glucose regulation. 1) Insulin resistance may
  occur when cardiomyocytes are exposed to high glucose. 2) The phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway stimulates the translocation
  of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the membrane, thereby resulting in glucose
  uptake to cells of the heart. However, in a knockout model of the cardiac insulin
  receptor, cardiac glucose uptake is reduced, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction,
  and increased cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. 3) Mitochondrial
  dysfunction occurs when the PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α)/AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway is impaired. 4) The level of autophagy may be reduced
  when the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target
  of rapamycin1 (mTORC1) pathway is activated.
