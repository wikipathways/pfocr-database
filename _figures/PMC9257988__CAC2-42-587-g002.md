caption: 'Intertwined interactions within the tumor ecosystem. The material and energy
  flow arising from tumor metabolism and intercellular communication (central) runs
  through the host macroenvironment, linking tumor microenvironment (upper) to distant
  organ niches (right), immune (bottom) as well as the nervous and the endocrine systems
  (left). Such tumor‐specific metabolic and other non‐metabolic hallmarks are intertwined
  to form a dual cause‐effect relationship that constitutes an evolving systemic onco‐sphere.
