caption: 'Schematic of myocardial abnormalties revealed in human HFpEF. The left side
  shows components of the beta-adrenergic (b-AR) pathway from the receptor to adenylcyclase
  (AC), generation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) to activation of protein kinase A (PKA). The
  latter is involved with modification of L-type calcium channels, phospholamban (PLN),
  titin, and other regulatory thin filament proteins (e.g. troponin I, TnI) which
  influence myofilament stiffness and contractile activation. Evidence suggests a
  deficiency in this signaling pathway in HFpEF, with increased titin stiffness and
  depressed β-AR responsiveness. The middle section shows transforming growth factor
  b (TGFb) and Gq-protein coupled receptor (GqPR) signaling involving transcription
  factors (Smad), phospholipase C (PLC) and mitogen activated kinases (MAPk) which
  are involved with activation of pro-fibrotic and hypertrophic cascades. At the right
  is the nitric oxide synathase (NOS) pathway resulting in NO activation of soluble
  guanylatecyclase (sGC), generation of cyclic GMP (cGMP) and activation of protein
  kinase G (PKG). In the middle is reactive oxygen species (ROS) activated by TGFb,
  b-AR, and GqPR coupled signaling – which inhibits the NOS-cGMP generation and thereby
  PKG activity, stimulates CamKII which can render sarcoplasmic reticular (SR) calcium
  release by the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) more promiscuous. ROS and CamKII also impact
  titin to influence stiffening. Lastly, the upper right depicts the role of matrix
  modulation by cytokines/inflammation, and the by-directional interaction of these
  factors with the myocyte. (Illustration credit: Ben Smith)'
