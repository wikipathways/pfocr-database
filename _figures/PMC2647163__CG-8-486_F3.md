caption: 'Summarized neurotoxic mechanisms of synaptically bound ADDLs.Proposed mechanistic
  pathway for synaptically-bound ADDLs implicated in the induction of aberrations
  in dendritic spine composition and morphology and how this mechanism is related
  to synaptic dysfunction and connectivity loss in AD. Aβ generated by cleavage of
  APP can accumulate and adopt oligomeric conformations of the ADDL-type that will
  bind to a postsynaptic membrane receptor (protein X) not yet identified but putatively
  located in the NMDA-R complex triggering Ca2+ influx followed by various changes
  in kinases/phosphatases activity that lead to: 1) reorganization of memory-essential
  receptors (NMDA-R, AMRA-R, EphB and InsR) from the cell surface most probably due
  to faulty receptor endocytosis. Various mechanisms have been proposed: one of them
  implicated Arc overexpression in the withdrawal of AMRA-R, while another suggested
  that NMDA-R endocytosis results from ADDL-induced activation of the a7nAchR and
  participation of signaling molecules such as STEP and Fyn. Alterations in dynamin
  2 and endophilin, an enzyme involved in endocytic machinery controlling receptor
  turnover, has also been proposed. 2) deregulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics
  which might result from the activation of Arc. At this level, rearrangement inside
  the actin-binding protein network, which is partially composed of Arc, Drebrin,
  Cofilin and Spinophilin, takes place disrupting the “spine morphology motor” and
  therefore proper synaptic plasticity. PAK and RhoGTPases activities are believed
  to play a major role in the actin cytoskeleton dynamics, its reduced activity leading
  to loss of drebrin and activation of cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing molecule.
  3) Modifications of the microtubule network examplified by the hyperphosphorylation
  of tau and the alterations in tubulin and MAP2 (not represented here). 4) Possible
  interference with expression of survival and “killer” genes through the CREB pathway.
  For clarity purpose, other possible factors (e.g. oxidative stress, mitochondrial
  dysfunction, presynaptic neurotransmitter release) that might be implicated in synaptic
  receptor expression and spine morphology have been omitted.'
