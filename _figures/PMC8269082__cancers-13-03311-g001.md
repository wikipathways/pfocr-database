caption: Mitochondrial metabolic pathways. Catabolism of glucose, glutamine and fatty
  acids all contribute to mitochondrial energetic metabolism. Filled circles represent
  the intersections between mitochondrial and cytosolic metabolic pathways. Cellular
  ATP is mainly produced in mitochondria through oxidative respiration that depends
  on cytosolic glycolysis and mitochondrial TCA cycle. Mitochondrial citrate produced
  in the TCA cycle contributes to lipid synthesis in the cytosol. TCA cycle and OXPHOS
  are fueled by pyruvate, glutamate and acetyl-coA produced by glycolysis, glutaminolysis
  and fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), respectively. Glycolysis can also contribute to
  nucleic acid metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Extracellular lactate
  can be oxidized in mitochondria and is converted into pyruvate, thereby fueling
  oxidative respiration to produce ATP.
