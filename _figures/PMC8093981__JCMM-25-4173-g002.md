caption: 14‐3‐3 proteins regulate innate immunity. RIG‐I and MDA5 recognize both short
  dsRNA and long dsRNA viruses, respectively, and are then transferred to the mitochondria
  to interact with MAVS, induce IRF3, IRF7 and NF‐κB activation, promoting the production
  of IFN and various inflammatory factors. 14‐3‐3ε plays a crucial role in the transfer
  of RIG‐I to mitochondrial MAVS and is a partner of RIG‐I interaction and promotes
  the translocation complex containing RIG‐I, 14‐3‐3ε and TRIM25 formation (the dotted
  circle indicated in the figure). 14‐3‐3ε interacts with RIG‐I and TRIM25, and stabilizes
  the interaction between the RIG‐I and TRIM25 proteins. 14‐3‐3η promotes the transport
  of MAD5 from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial membrane through interaction with
  MDA5, thereby enhancing and boosting the MAD5‐mediated antiviral response. However,
  the interaction between the ZIKV NS3 protein and 14‐3‐3ε hinders the transduction
  of RIG‐I, while interaction with 14‐3‐3η hinders the transduction of MDA5, further
  inhibiting innate immunity and promoting its own virus replication. In addition,
  the interaction of the EBV‐encoded homologue, BPLF1 and 14‐3‐3 proteins promotes
  the formation of the translocation complex and inhibits RIG‐I ubiquitination to
  block the innate immune response. Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) are activated after
  recognizing PAMPs, recruiting the proximal cytoplasmic Toll/IL‐1 receptor (TIR)
  domain‐containing adaptor proteins. Both lipoproteins and LPS are recognized on
  the cell surface by a heterodimer of TLR1/6 and TLR2, and TLR4, respectively. Ligand
  stimulation recruits MyD88 and TIRAP to TLRs, a complex of IRAKs and TRAF6 is subsequently
  formed, and results in NF‐κB activation. LPS induces TLR4 translocation to the endosome
  together with TRAM. TLR3 recognizes dsRNA in the endosomes. TLR3 and TLR4 activate
  TRIF‐dependent signalling, which activates NF‐kB and IRF3/7 resulting in the induction
  of proinflammatory cytokine genes and type I IFNs. In addition, 14‐3‐3θ can inhibit
  TLR2‐mediated activation of NF‐κB, but promote the activation of TLR4‐dependent
  transcription factors. 14‐3‐3ζ promotes the multimerization of TICAM‐1 (also known
  as TRIF) to form the TIC signalosome and regulate the TLR3‐TICAM‐1 signalling pathway
