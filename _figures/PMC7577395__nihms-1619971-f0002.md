caption: Representative contributions of ion channels to glioma cell proliferation.
  TRPM7 may activate proliferation through the Notch, PI3K/mTOR, and MAPK pathways.
  The nuclear localization sequence (NLS) on hEAG/hERG causes perinuclear localization
  of these channels and activates the MAPK pathway. Increased hEAG/hERG expression
  and VGCC activity results in an increased influx of Ca2+ ions which causes increased
  cell cycle transition and cell proliferation through calmodulin activation. ANO1
  overexpression activates NF-κB. Interestingly, Kv2.1 overexpression increases autophagy
  through phosphorylated ERK1/2, which results in increased apoptosis and attenuates
  proliferation. *; Postulated mechanism.
