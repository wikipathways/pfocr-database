caption: 'Schematic overview of proposed G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor 1 (GPER1)
  signalling. GPER1 is stimulated by 17β-estradiol (E2) and the synthetic agonist
  G-1. Primary signalling (red arrows) by GPER1 involves stimulation of Gαs and a
  pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gαi/o protein, through which adenylate cyclase (AC)
  is either positively (+) or negatively (−) regulated to yield an increase or decrease
  in the cAMP level and subsequent cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity. Stimulation
  of Gαi/o also yields the liberation of Gβγ subunits that leads to: (i) activation
  of phosphoinositide-3 protein kinase (PI3K) and subsequent Akt/PKB protein kinase
  (Akt/PKB); (ii) activation of Src protein kinase (Src) and subsequent recruitment
  of the Src-Homology-Containing adaptor protein (SHC), activation of a matrix metalloproteinase
  (MMP), liberation of heparin-bound epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) and transactivation
  of the EGF receptor (EGFR); and (iii) Gβγ-independent activation of the pathway
  described in (ii). Secondary signalling (black arrows) via transactivation of the
  EGFR leads to activation of extracellular-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)
  and PI3K. GPER1 stimulation also leads to elevation of intracellular Ca2+ through
  presently unknown mechanisms (?) that involves either primary signalling through
  Gβγ or secondary signalling through EGFR transactivation. For more details, see
