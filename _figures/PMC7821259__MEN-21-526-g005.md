caption: 'A schematic presentation of the phenylpropanoid pathway and flavonoid biosynthetic
  pathway leading to anthocyanins in elephant grass. (a) Diagram depicting the main
  genes and metabolic pathway involved in anthocyanin accumulation. Expanded genes
  are shown in red, and both expanded and positively selected in blue. Enzyme abbreviations:
  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4‐hydroxylase, 4Cl, 4‐coumarate
  CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3‐hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavonoid 3′‐hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′5′‐hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4‐reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; 3GT, anthocyanidin
  3‐O‐glucosyltransferase; OMT, O‐methyl transferase. (b) Gene copy number of key
  genes involved in anthocyanin accumulation in elephant grass (Cp), Cenchrus americanus
  (Ca), Setaria italica (Si), Oryza sativa (Os) and Arabidopsis thaliana (At). Gene
  copy numbers that are at least two‐fold higher in elephant grass than in other species
  are labelled in red. (c) Heatmap showing the expression level of candidate genes
  involved in anthocyanin accumulation in different tissues of elephant grass'
