caption: Statins activate Ras by inhibiting the synthesis of FPP, and then stimulate
  the expression of BMP-2 through the PI3K/Akt/MAPK pathway. BMP-2 up-regulates the
  expression of the Runx2 gene, and phosphorylated Runx2 stimulates a series of bone-specific
  gene transcriptions and promotes the differentiation of osteoblasts. The inhibition
  FPP synthesis inactivates Rho and MKP-1 by decreasing GR production, which abolishes
  the negative effects of Rho and MKP-1 on osteogenesis. FPP is a transcriptional
  activator of GR that activates MKP-1 to dephosphorylate MAPKs, and GGPP converted
  from FPP inhibits the differentiation of osteoblasts by activating Rho. Statins
  inhibit osteoblast apoptosis by stimulating Smad3. In addition, statins regulate
  the OPG/RANKL/RANK signalling pathway by increasing the expression of ER, thereby
  inhibiting osteoclastogenesis.
