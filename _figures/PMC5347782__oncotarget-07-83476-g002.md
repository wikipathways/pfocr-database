caption: A. Autophagy plays dual roles in ovarian carcinoma. The level of autophagy
  is down-regulated in ovarian carcinoma generally. In such context, autophagy plays
  an anti-tumor role in ovarian carcinoma; low level of autophagy contributes to ovarian
  carcinoma develpoment. The activation of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and inhibition
  of p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathways lead to low level of autophagy in ovarian
  carcinoma. Furthermore, activation of oncomiRs inhibit autophagy directly, inhibition
  of antitumor-miRs also lead to down-regulation of autophagy. In addition, the tumor
  suppressor genes mutation or deletion causes inhibition of autophagy in ovarian
  carcinoma, such as ARHI, p53, PTEN. B. In the context of ovarian carcinoma treatment
  with chemotherapy, autophagy is up-regulated and terminates in chemotherapy resistant.
  Chemotherapy together with inhibition of autophagy could inhibit chemotherapy resistant
  and be effective to treat ovarian carcinoma.
