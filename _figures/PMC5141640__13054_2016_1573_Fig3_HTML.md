caption: 'Ischemic stroke induces systemic immunosuppression mediated by several factors.
  These are: (1) overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) results in
  secretion of catecholamines, which act on β-adrenergic receptors (ARβ2), dopaminergic
  receptors (dopamine receptor D2, DRD2), acetylcholine, and hepatic invariant natural
  killer T-cell (iNKT) stimulation; (2) activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  (HPA) axis results in excessive glucocorticoid (GC) secretion, which acts on T cells
  to reduce interferon (IFN)-γ production, inducing apoptotic cell death and promoting
  interleukin (IL)-10 secretion through regulatory T cells (T reg); (3) parasympathetic
  nervous system (PNS) stimulation activates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway,
  driven by the efferent vagus nerve at nAChRα7 receptors expressed in alveolar macrophages
  (Mθ) and lung epithelial cells, reducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin
  (IL)-1β; and (4) damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are released by cells
  undergoing non-apoptotic death or by immune system cells, characterized by reduced
  major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II expression, decreased cytokine production
  upon stimulation, and T cell dysfunction. This contributes to the overall immunosuppressive
  state after stroke, which is the main explanation for post-stroke susceptibility
  to infection. Blue arrows represent the systemic effects of stroke. Green lines
  represent possible therapeutic targets to prevent systemic immunosuppression and
  stroke-associated pneumonia. AD adrenalin, NR noradrenaline, RAGE receptor for advanced
  glycation end-products, TLR toll-like receptor'
