caption: 'mTOR-based targeting strategies are presented in the context of the PI3K/mTOR
  signaling network. Pathways activating mTOR via RTKs and PI3K are shown together
  with effectors regulating protein and lipid biosynthesis and cell cycle. mTORC1
  and mTORC2 modulate cell cycle via effects on Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27, cyclin
  D1, and cyclin E; SREBPs and ACL regulate lipid biosynthesis downstream of AKT;
  mTORC1 phosphorylates 4EBP1 and S6K1 to activate critical drivers of global protein
  translation. Also represented are important feedback pathways whereby mTORC1 reduces
  signaling through PI3K and mTORC2: S6K1 phosphorylates IRS1, promoting its proteolysis;
  S6K1 phosphorylates Rictor to inhibit mTORC2-dependent AKT activation. The TSC1/2
  complex serves as a relay center for tumor microenvironmental queues. Oncogenic
  PI3K/PDK1 and Ras/MAPK signaling cooperate to reduce TSC1/2 activity. Hypoxia (via
  HIF1α), DNA damage (via p53), and nutrient deprivation (via LKB1) all activate TSC1/2
  to restrain mTORC1 and biosynthetic processes in normal tissue. These pathways are
  often inactivated during tumorigenesis. Rapalogs are mTORC1-specific inhibitors.
  TOR-KIs more potently inhibit both mTOR complexes. Dual PI3K/TOR-KIs additionally
  block upstream signaling via PI3K. Green circles represent stimulatory phosphorylations;
  red circles, inhibitory phosphorylations.'
