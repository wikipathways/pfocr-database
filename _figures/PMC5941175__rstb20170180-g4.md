caption: Kinetic reaction schemes of GroEL–GroES interaction revealed by HS-AFM imaging
  under different substrate conditions. The football complexes (F*) shown in pale
  colours are apparently the same as but kinetically different from the football complexes
  formed immediately before. The thickness of arrows (shown with solid black, red,
  pink and green lines) along reaction pathways indicates the relative frequency of
  occurrence. The dashed red arrows indicate reaction processes occurring in the ring
  bound to GroES shown in red, while the dashed blue arrow indicates reaction processes
  occurring in the ring bound to GroES shown in blue. The order of kFB-II1 and kFB-II2
  and the order of k1 and k2 are tentative. In the side pathway, the coexistence of
  ATP and ADP in one ring is shown but hypothetical. (a) Scheme of kinetic reaction
  in the presence of DM-MBP. (b) Scheme of kinetic reaction in the absence of SP.
  (c) Scheme of kinetic reaction in the presence of α-LA.
