caption: Shown are the average metabolite levels across 96 accessions in Expt. A (orange)
  and Expt. B (blue). Error bars denote one standard deviation and asterisks denote
  significant and greater than two-fold difference between experiments. Purple arrows
  denote starch and sucrose metabolic pathway members and blue arrows correspond to
  the ascorbate metabolic pathway.
