caption: Immune-related features and pathways predictive of response to immune checkpoint
  blockade. Copy number amplifications of the JAK-2/PD-L1/2 regions, increased PD-L1
  expression via an intact JAK-STAT pathway culminating in IRF-1 binding to the PD-L1
  promoter, high MHC-I/II expression, and HLA variability all correlate with response
  to ICB. Elevated concentrations of effector and helper T cells and low concentrations
  of Tregs and TGFβ in the TME are also associated with response to ICB. HLA human
  leukocyte antigen, ICB immune checkpoint blockade, IRF-1 interferon regulatory factor
  1, JAK-STAT janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription, MHC
  major histocompatibility complex, PD-L1 programmed death ligand 1, TGFβ transforming
  growth factor beta, TME tumor microenvironment, Treg regulatory T cell
