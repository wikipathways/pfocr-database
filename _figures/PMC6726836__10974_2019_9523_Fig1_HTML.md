caption: The cAMP signalling pathway. Activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) by G-coupled
  receptors (GPCR) via Gs leads to an accumulation of cAMP, which is bound by a number
  of different cAMP effector proteins, namely HCN channels and POPDC proteins, which
  are both membrane-bound, while EPAC and PKA are cytoplasmic proteins. PKA is bound
  by a diverse group of anchor proteins (AKAP), which also recruit PDE isoforms forming
  a nanodomain. PKA activation and substrate phosphorylation is under tight spatiotemporal
  control. There are a large number of AKAP proteins in cells creating many different
  cAMP nanodomains in different subcellular compartments (grey halo). AKAP proteins
  also bind other signalling molecules forming a platform also allowing cross-talk
  between signalling pathways
