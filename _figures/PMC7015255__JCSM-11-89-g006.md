caption: Changes provoked by aerobic exercise training on microRNA‐1 downstream‐associated
  pathways in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
  Note that despite the increase in microRNA‐1 levels, the PI3K‐AKT pathway is increased,
  which seems to be associated with a reduction in PTEN levels. In addition, HDAC4
  levels decrease, which leads to an increase in follistatin, MEF2C, and MyoD levels.
  These changes improve protein synthesis, skeletal muscle differentiation, and myocyte
  fusion. The consequence of such changes is an increase in muscle cross‐sectional
  area.
