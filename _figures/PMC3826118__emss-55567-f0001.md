caption: Classical action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) is mediated by binding
  of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) – retinoid X receptor (RXR) – 1,25-D3 complex to
  Vitamin D Response Elements in the DNA. 1,25-D3 decreases proliferation by reducing
  Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels through inhibiting the synthesizing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2
  (COX2) and inducing the degrading enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH).
  Further 1,25-D3 is able to increase intestinal Ca2+ uptake through activation of
  calcium channels. 1,25-D3 counteracts Wnt signaling through increased E-cadherin
  and Wnt inhibitor (e.g. Dickkopf 1 and 4) expression, as well as through sequestring
  β-catenin in thecytoplasm. Wnt signaling can also be inhibited through calcium sensing
  receptor (CaSR) activation. The CaSR mediates inhibition of the Wnt pathway by reducing
  TCF4 expression, enhancing Wnt antagonist expression (Wnt5a, Dickkopf 5) as well
  as increasing β-catenin phosphorylation/ubiquitinilation. Calcium in the gut lumen
  is able to form complexes with irritable bile acids (e.g. lithocholic acid (LC))
  which are thereby neutralized. This will counteract VDR-LC induced CYP24A1 gene
  expression. Phospholipids (PL), Phospholipase A (PLA), Arachidonic Acid (AA), Calcium2+
  (Ca).
