caption: Schematic representation shows ovarian and nonovarian actions of FSH. In
  the classical endocrine pathway, FSH is secreted from pituitary gonadotrophs and
  acts via FSHRs on ovarian granulosa cells. Stilley and colleagues used a mAB and
  identified FSHR expression in multiple nonovarian human tissues during nonpregnancy
  and pregnancy conditions as listed in the box []. Interestingly, they found genes
  encoding FSH subunits are expressed locally within several regions of the female
  reproductive tract suggesting the possibility of an FSH/FSHR-mediated autocrine
  signaling. Stilley et al. also observed FSHR expression in mouse placental labyrinth
  zone and defects in feto-placental units in Fshr+/− and Fshr−/− mice. Ov, ovary;
  U, uterus.
