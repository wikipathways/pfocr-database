caption: 'The DDR and therapeutic strategies in TNBC. DNA-damaging therapies or endogenous
  replication dysfunction result in SSBs and DSBs which activate the DDR and repair
  signaling pathways. Distinct DSB DDR signaling pathway initiation depends on the
  type of DNA damage and is mediated by three central DDR kinases: DNA-PK, ATM, and
  ATR. In addition, PARP enzymes play a key role in DDR and facilitate SSB repair
  efficiency and functions in DSB repair via HRR and NHEJ pathways. The ATM and ATR
  pathways cross-talk extensively and only key intersections are highlighted here
  for pragmatic purposes. ATM/CHK2 signaling induces cell cycle arrest, preventing
  cell cycle progression in tumor cells with DNA damage. In addition, ATR/CHK1/WEE1
  signaling initiates DNA DSB repair by inducing checkpoints and activating key components
  of HRR, including BRCA1/2 activity. Alternatively, DSB repair occurs through NHEJ
  via DNA-PKcs recruitment. Inhibition of PARP to treat TNBC with defects in HRR such
  as BRCA1/2 mutations, induces DSBs from unrepaired SSBs via PARP trapping and collapsed
  replication forks. Accumulated PARPi-induced DNA damage cannot be effectively repaired
  due to the HRR deficiency, resulting in genomic instability and cell cycle arrest.
  In addition, loss of function or inhibitors (red) against other key mediators of
  HRR also constrain NHEJ dependence which can be overwhelmed in the setting of concomitant
  PARPi via accumulation of DSB and genomic instability. RAD51 inhibition also suppresses
  HRR and sensitizes TNBC to PARPi. ATM/ATR/CHK1/WEE1 inhibition increases DSBs and
  impairs cell cycle arrest checkpoints and DNA damage repair, ultimately resulting
  in tumor cell death. DDR, DNA damage response; SSB, single-strand breaks; DSB, double-stranded
