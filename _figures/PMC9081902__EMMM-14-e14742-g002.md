caption: Food‐derived lipids, in large part composed of triglycerides (TG), are emulsified
  by bile acid salts in the intestinal lumen to form micelles, aiding pancreatic lipase
  to hydrolyze TG. Final products of lipids digestion, free fatty acids (FA), and
  monoglycerides (MG) cross the apical membrane of the enterocyte via passive diffusion
  or this process is mediated by fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4) or CD36. Upon
  entering, FAs and MG are bound by fatty acid‐binding proteins (L‐FABP and I‐FABP)
  and retinol‐binding protein 2 (RBP2), respectively, and destined for TG re‐synthesis.
  FA re‐esterification is performed by subsequent action of monoacylglycerolacyl transferases
  (MGAT1, 2) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1, 2). Diacylglycerol utilized
  in the process can be derived from the glycerol‐3 phosphate pathway. This process
  can be blocked upon AIDA‐mediated endoplasmic reticulum‐associated degradation (ERAD)
  of MGAT2, DGAT2, and glycerol‐3‐phosphate acyltransferase 3 (GPAT3). In the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), TG are loaded into apolipoprotein B48 (APOB48)‐containing lipoprotein
  particle by microsomal transfer protein (MTTP); thus, a pre‐chylomicron (pre‐CM)
  forms, and another apolipoprotein, APOA4, is attached. Pre‐CM are transported from
  ER via pre‐chylomicron transport vesicles (PCTV) and fuse with the Golgi apparatus
  in the coat protein complex II (COPII)‐dependent manner. Mature chylomicrons (CM)
  are secreted via exocytosis and taken up by the local lymphatic vessel. Pharmacological
  agents, targeting indicated pathways, are in pink frames.
