caption: 'Role of BPI in the interaction of GNB and OM blebs with neutrophil granulocytes
  and monocytes (A). BPI can opsonize GNB and target them to be phagocytosed by PMN.
  It can contribute to intracellular killing of ingested GNB and also to extracellular
  bacterial killing when released to the extracellular space by PMN. Single endotoxin
  molecules from OM blebs or other endotoxin containing remnants of GNB can be extracted
  and processed by the LBP/CD14/MD-2/TLR-4 pathway resulting an activation of CD-14
  positive monocytes. In contrast, BPI bound endotoxin is not accessible for LBP/CD14
  mediated LOS/LPS extraction and does not cause an inflammatory response in monocytes
  [, , ].Role of BPI in the interaction of OM blebs with dendritic cells (B). BPI
  can promote CD14-independent delivery of OM blebs to dendritic cells (DC). In parallel,
  LBP and sCD14 can promote MDDC activation by extraction and delivery of endotoxin
  to MD-2/TLR4 []. Subsequently, the ability of BPI and LBP to interact with the same
  OM bleb could allow coincidental enhancement of antigen delivery by BPI and LBP/sCD14-dependent
  cell activation and could thereby promote antigen-presenting functions of DC. Abbreviations:
  BPI Bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, GNB Gram negative bacteria, LBP
  Lipopolysaccharides binding protein, CD14 either membrane bound or soluble CD14,
  Blebs outer membrane vesicles of GNB, LOS/LPS lipooligosaccharide or lipopolysaccharide,
  MD-2 Myeloid Differentiation-2, TLR-4 TOLL-like receptor-4'
