caption: Metabolic dysregulation mediates ferroptosis in HCC. The AMPK/SREBP1 pathway
  plays a pivotal role in mediating metabolic homeostasis during ferroptosis. HCAR1/MCT1-mediated
  lactate uptake promotes ATP production in HCC cells and deactivates AMPK, which
  leads to the upregulation of SREBP1 and downstream SCD1 to enhance the production
  of MUFAs; this results in resistance to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in HCC
  cells. In addition, SLC27A4 overexpression promotes the selective uptake of MUFAs
  in HCC cells. BCAT2 is the key enzyme that regulates intracellular glutamate levels
  and is a specific inhibitor of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis inducers (erastin, sorafenib,
  and sulfasalazine) can activate the AMPK/SREBP1 pathway and subsequently inhibit
  BCAT2 transcription. Moreover, the level of intracellular glutamate could be promoted
  by PNO1-induced autophagy, which results in the accumulation of GSH and ferroptosis
  in HCC. The mevalonate pathway affects the synthesis of CoQ and GPX4 by regulating
  the maturation of selenocysteine tRNA. Increased levels of 27HC also upregulate
  GPX4 in HCC, leading to ferroptosis resistance via the TMEM147/STAT2/DHCR7 axis
