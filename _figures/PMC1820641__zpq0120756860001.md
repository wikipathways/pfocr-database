caption: Structure and biosynthesis of folates in plants. (A) The chemical structure
  of monoglutamyl tetrahydrofolate is shown. The pteridine-, PABA-, and glutamate-derived
  moieties are color-coded. (B) The plant folate biosynthetic pathway is shown. The
  pteridine pathway leading to hydroxymethyldihydropterin (HMDHP) is shown in blue,
  the pathway leading to p-aminobenzoate is shown in green, and steps localized in
  the mitochondria are in black. Open circles indicate possible transporters. Red
  arrows indicate the two enzymes (GCHI and ADCS) engineered by Diaz de la Garza et
  al. (). DHN, dihydroneopterin; -P, monophosphate; -PP, pyrophosphate; -PPP, triphosphate;
  DHM, dihydromonapterin.
