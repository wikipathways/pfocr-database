caption: Model predicting the downstream metabolic effects of VEGF, IFN-γ, and MPO
  in the brain, and the expected attendant urinary profile, in a TBM patient. The
  bold red arrows indicate the major upregulated metabolic pathways, namely tryptophan
  catabolism, induced by upregulated indoleamine dioxygenase due to IFN-γ, and increased
  metabolic burst (angiogenesis) via increased glycolysis. The red boxes enclose metabolic
  end-products within the Mtb-infected brain – protein glycosylation, α-ketoglutarate,
  quinolinic acid, kynurenic acid, 3-chlorotyrosine and glutathione sulfonamide –
  which are the predicted metabolic brain markers of TBM. The blue arrows indicate
  the transport of important metabolic components. The dashed black line, indicating
  oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone, represents a transient pathway that occurs
  when insulin is depleted, as indicated. 6-PG, 6-phosphogluconate; R5P, ribulose-5-phosphate;
