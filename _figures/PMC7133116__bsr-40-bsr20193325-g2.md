caption: Biosynthetic steps involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are highlighted
  in red and blue respectively. Steps in the Entner–Doudoroff pathway are highlighted
  in green. Steps involved in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and the Calvin–Benson–Bassham
  cycle are highlighted in orange and purple, respectively. Fermentation pathways
  are highlighted in pink. Photorespiration pathways are highlighted in olive. Where
  enzymes catalyse reactions in two pathways, the arrows are split between their respective
  colours. The carboyxsome is represented as a purple octagon. Cofactors in each reaction
  are shown with the exception of protons, water, oxygen and inorganic phosphate.
