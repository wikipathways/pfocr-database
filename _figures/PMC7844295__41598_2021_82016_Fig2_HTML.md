caption: Biosynthetic pathways of glycerophospholipids in rat hippocampus. Glycerophospholipids
  are synthetized in the Kennedy pathway and subsequently remodeled in the Lands cycle,
  contributing to lipid diversity and the production of intracellular lipid mediators.
  The differentially expressed proteins revealed by proteomics in organotypic hippocampal
  slice culture are highlighted in pink (increased abundance in female) and blue (increased
  abundance in males). For more details, see Supplementary Dataset . Statistical analyses
  were performed by using Student's t test followed by multiple testing corrections
  using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for false discovery rate (n = 5 biological
  replicates, each containing 3 slices).
