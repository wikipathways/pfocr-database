caption: Schematic summary of the effects mediated by RA-NPs against MPTP-induced
  injury in the dopaminergic (DA) nigrostriatal pathway of adult and old mice. The
  i.p. injection of MPTP induced a decrease in TH DA neurons in SN and TH fibers in
  the striatum of adult mice (A-red color). This effect was accompanied by a decrease
  in mRNA expression of transcription factors involved in DA neuronal survival, Nurr1
  and Pitx3, in SN and striatum of both age groups (A,B-red color). In the adult mice,
  the RA released from NPs protects the DA TH neurons in SN as well its neuronal TH
  fibers/axonal innervations in the striatum against MPTP-induced injury (A-green
  color). There was also an increase in Nurr1 and Pitx3 mRNA expression levels only
  in SN of adult mice (A-green color). Under the same conditions there was an increase
  in Pitx3 and Nurr1 mRNA expression in SN and striatum of old mice, respectively
  (B-green color).
