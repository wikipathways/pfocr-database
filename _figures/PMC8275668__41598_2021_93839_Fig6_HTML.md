caption: Pathway analysis identifies networks comprising immune-related proteins.
  Detected proteins are involved in “Cellular Function” and “Maintenance”, “Humoral
  Immune response” and “Inflammatory Response”. The network is displayed graphically
  as nodes (proteins) and edges (the biological relationships between nodes). Analysis
  was performed by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA Spring 2021 release,
  https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).
