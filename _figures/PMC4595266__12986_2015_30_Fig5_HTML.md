caption: Proposed mechanism for quercetin action against hepatic steatosis in obese
  mice. Excess intake of nutrients, including overloaded FFAs in obese conditions,
  increases ROS production in the liver; the latter results from lipid peroxidation
  and cause mitochondrial damage. The mitochondrial damage in turn leads to a decrease
  of mitochondrial oxidative capacity, including β-oxidation and ATP production, resulting
  in triglyceride accumulation in the liver. Quercetin limits hepatic lipid accumulation
  by enhancing hepatic mitochondrial oxidative metabolic capacity. Quercetin increases
  the induction of HO-1 and its byproduct CO by the upregulated transcriptional regulator
  Nrf-2. CO, enhances the nuclear translocation of Nrf-1 and PGC-1α, and activates
  Tfam expression, all of which augments mitochondrial biogenesis. This leads to reduction
  of FFA-induced lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage and hepatic triglyceride
  accumulation by increasing mitochondrial oxidative capacity. The effects of quercetin
  on the induction of HO-1 were completely disrupted in HO-1 inhibitor and/or Nrf-2
  deficiency, indicating that one of the mechanisms by which quercetin enhances mitochondrial
  oxidative metabolism is associated with HO-1 induction through Nrf-2 pathway
