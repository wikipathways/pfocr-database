caption: Effects of the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK)-mediated signaling pathway
  in epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) resistance. For
  EGFR-TKI resistance without the acquired T790M mutation in EGFR, the downstream
  signaling pathways of EGFR are still blocked by EGFR-TKIs. Alternative RTK-mediated
  signaling pathways (bypass) contribute to the survival of the EGFR-TKI-resistant
  cancer cells. Through binding to their ligands, MERTK-induced signaling pathways
  may crosstalk with other RTK-mediated signaling pathways that promote cell survival.
