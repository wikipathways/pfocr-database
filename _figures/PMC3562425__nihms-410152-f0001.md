caption: Different types of metabolism-based antiseizure treatments (dietary and pharmacological)
  affect metabolic pathways at different sites. Some processes are affected by more
  than one type of treatment (i.e., glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation). “Rapalogs”
  are analogs of rapamycin, modified to decrease toxicity and/or increase specific
  activity. Specific interventions are shown in ovals; metabolic processes are shown
  in clear rectangles; and specific metabolites are shown in green rectangles. FBP,
  fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; LGIT, low glycemic index treatment; mTOR, mammalian target
  of rapamycin; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; 2DG,
  2-deoxy-D-glucose.
