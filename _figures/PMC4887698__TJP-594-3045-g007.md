caption: Development of the IR condition, either associated with obesity or not, results
  in the diminished expression of DDAH, the enzyme responsible for ADMA degradation,
  causing a significant intracellular elevation of ADMA and therefore interfering
  with the l‐arginine/NO signalling pathway. In addition, arginase is up‐regulated
  leading to an altered l‐arginine/NO pathway. These alterations result in defective
  NO‐mediate responses and subsequent endothelial dysfunction, which represents a
  first step toward cardiovascular disease.
