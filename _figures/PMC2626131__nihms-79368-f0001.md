caption: Possible pathways by which ΔNp73 modifies brain aging and the pathogenesis
  of Alzheimer's disease. By acting as a negative regulator of p53 and by directly
  inhibiting JNK ΔNp73 protects neurons against degeneration. A. Overexpression of
  p53 as well as deletion of one allele of Tp63 or one allele of ΔNp73 causes accelerated
  aging and neurodegeneration. B. Downstream targets of ΔNp73. ΔNp73 inhibits p53
  activity and this reduces the levels of Bax, p21 and Apaf-1. ΔNp73 interacts with
  JNK and inhibits its activity resulting in reduced tau phosphorylation, decreased
  neuronal vulnerability and preserved synaptic plasticity. As p53 levels are not
  changed in Tp73+/− mice, the major pathway is probably via JNK. Reduced levels of
  ΔNp73 in the Tp73+/− mice or in AD removes the inhibition of ΔNp73 on JNK and p53
  activities thereby triggering neuronal death. These pathways can partially explain
  how ΔNp73 might preserve cognitive ability during aging and in AD.
