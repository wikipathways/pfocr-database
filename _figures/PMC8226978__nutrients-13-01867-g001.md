caption: The role of Zn and associated signaling in PCa. The PCa can be progressed
  via androgen-dependent and independent signaling mechanisms. In the androgen-dependent
  pathway, testosterone hormone binds to the androgen receptor (AR), which leads to
  its dissociation from heat shock proteins (HSP) and enables its nuclear translocation
  and binding to the androgen response element (ARE) increasing the expression of
  growth and survival genes as well as PSA. In the androgen-independent mechanism,
  growth factor signaling, cytokines and glucocorticoid signaling activate cell proliferative
  pathways such as PI3K-AKT, NF-κB, and JAK-STAT, leading to an increase in expression
  of growth and survival genes as well as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) []. Interestingly,
  Zn is known to modulate AR and PSA [] as well as other signaling molecules such
  as AKT [] and NF-κB [,]. Thus, Zn modulating agents could be used in the prevention
  and/or treatment of PCa. DHT, dihydrotestosterone; T/ DHEA, testosterone/dehydroepiandrosterone.
