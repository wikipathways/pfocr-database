caption: The eIF2 kinase regulated signaling pathways. A number of stimuli achieve
  eIF2α phosphorylation through the four known eIF2α kinases. The graphical representation
  of the molecular network was generated through the use of Pathway Studio 6 (Ariadne
  Genomics®). All lines are supported by at least one reference from previously published
  literature stored in the Pathway Studio database
