caption: (A) In an unbound state, the cytoplasmic tail of T cell immunoglobulin and
  mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM3) binds to HLA-B associated transcript 3
  (Bat3) which helps to recruit the tyrosine kinase Lck. Lck clusters then phosphorylate
  the CD3 domain of TCR, leading to the recruitment of the tyrosine kinase Zap 70.
  Zap 70 then phosphorylates linker adaptor protein (LAT), which activates the phospholipase
  Cγ1 (PLCγ1) to produce second messengers like Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG), leading to the production of cytokines and T cell proliferation. (B) Upon
  the TIM3/Gal9 interaction, Y265 and Y272 in the cytoplasmic tail of TIM3 are phosphorylated,
  resulting in the release of Bat3 and Lck. The tyrosine kinase Fyn is recruited to
  the cytoplasmic tail of TIM3 and helps in the clustering of C-terminal c-Src kinase
  (Csk). Csk clusters promote phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine of Lck and
  inhibit its catalytic activity. Subsequently this leads to the inhibition of T cell
  proliferation and suppression of the production of IL-2, TNFα, and IFNγ.
