caption: NeurimmiRs were found targeting multiple molecules of the integrin and NF-κB
  pathway. Diverse signaling molecules, such as RAB-5C, RAB-21, SUGT1, TRAF3, MIB2,
  CREBBP in integrin and NF-κB pathway were predicted to be targets of NeurimmiRs.
  Molecules such as ILK (integrin linked kinease), MLC (Myosin light-chain), NIK (NF-KappaB-inducing
  kinase), IKKs (IkappaB kinases) and cellular component such as cell membrane and
  nucleus were also demonstrated as reference
