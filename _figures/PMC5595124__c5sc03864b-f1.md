caption: . Proposed biosynthetic pathway to actinorhodin 1. The polyketone 2 is attached
  to holo-ACP during the elongation of the polyketide backbone to the full sixteen
  carbon chain-length. Both studies in vivo and in vitro showed the proteins encoded
  by actI (KS/CLF and ACP), the so-called minimal PKS catalyses the generation of
  the full-length polyketide chain. The minimal PKS also partially controlled the
  C7–C12 ring closure to yield SEK4 as well as a mis-cyclised product formed from
  the C10–C15 ring closure (SEK4b). Ketide units are depicted in the keto-forms although
  these are likely to be a mixture of keto–enol tautomers.
