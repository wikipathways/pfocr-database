caption: The biosynthesis pathways of typical flavonoids and stilbenoids and the related
  biosensors. The biosynthesis of flavonoids and stilbenoids is derived from the shikimate
  pathway. Many biosensors have been developed to sense the key intermediates, including
  the p-coumaric acid-responsive biosensor PadR, the p-coumaroyl-CoA-responsive biosensor
  CouR and the naringenin-responsive biosensor FdeR. Flavonoid-responsive biosensors
  are also designed. TtgR was engineered to sense resveratrol, FdeR was designed to
  sense naringenin and QdoR was engineered to sense kaempferol and quercetin. G-6-P,
  glucose-6-phosphate; E-4-P, erythrose 4-phosphate; DAHP, 3-deoxy-arabino-heptulosonate
  7-phosphate; PP pathway, pentose phosphate pathway
