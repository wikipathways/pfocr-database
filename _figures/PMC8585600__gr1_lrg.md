caption: 'Interleukin (IL)−6 receptor/ligand interactions. IL-6 interacts with two
  types of IL receptors (IL-6Rs): (a) Interaction with membranous form directs classic
  cis-signaling pathway, whereas interaction with the soluble form (i.e. sIL-6R) promotes
  trans-signaling pathway (b). The trans-membrane protein gp-130 acts as a subunit
  for IL-6R, transducing signals toward cytosol. IL-6/IL-6R/gp-130 interactions transduce
  signals via janus kinas (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3). STAT3 is further transferred toward the nucleus in order to promote activation
  of target gens, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible
  factor (HIF)−1α. Inhibition of membrane-bound and soluble IL-6Rs by agents like
  acetolizumab is of therapeutic importance in cancer patients and cases with severe
  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induced disease. (c) Interleukin
  (IL)−6 amplifier in patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced disease. The activity of NF-κβ
  is induced by IL-6/STAT-3. NF-κβ, in turn, promotes IL-6 transcription and its release
  toward the extracellular milieu. This mechanism of implication will intensify the
  severity of condition in patients with high activity of IL-6, such what seen in
  SARS-CoV-2 induced disease. (d) IL-6 inducible effect on SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry.
  SARS-CoV-2 interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in order
  to enter the cellular cytosol. Recognition of the ACE2 by the virus and its membrane
  infusion is mediated by cathepsin L. IL-6 induces the activity of ACE2 and cathepsin
  L, thus facilitating cellular entry of the virus.'
