caption: Schematic diagram of the function and mechanism of exosomal miR-27b in sepsis.
  JMJD3 can be transferred into nucleus through cytoplasm and nucleus and promote
  the demethylation of H3K27me3 by recruiting NF-κB, thus activating the transcription
  of TNF-α/IL-β/IL-6 to increase the expression of these target proteins. However,
  miR-27b loaded in the exosomes secreted by MSCs binds to the mRNA of JMJD3 in the
  target cells after membrane fusion and inhibits the expression of JMJD3 protein,
  thus suppressing the expression of inflammatory factors. GSK-J4, a pharmacological
  inhibitor of JMJD3, has similar effects

  sepsis by targeting JMJD3 and downregulating NF-κB signaling pathway.
