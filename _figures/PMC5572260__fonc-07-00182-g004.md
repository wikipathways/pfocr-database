caption: 'Potential signaling in human glioblastoma cell lines after treatment with
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), irradiation and axitinib. VEGF activates
  multiple pathways including the Cdc42 and PLC pathways concerning cell migration
  and proliferation. It is supposed that stimulating effects of irradiation are mediated
  via enhanced synthesis of VEGF. Irradiation elevates VEGF biosynthesis of glioblastoma
  multiforme cells via MAPK activation. (A) Activation of the Cdc42 pathway by VEGF
  leads to an increased activation of Arp 2/3, HSP27, and ADF/cofilin resulting in
  an enhanced motility. Blockade of the VEGF-R2 by axitinib might decrease the activation
  of the Cdc42 pathway due to theoretical consideration resulting in a crucial decreased
  cell motility. (B) VEGF activates the PLC pathway which is involved in cell proliferation
  while axitinib might deactivate this pathway with impairment of cell proliferation.
  While motility is increased by VEGF, no positive effect on proliferation could be
  observed. This might be due to fully activated VEGF-pathways even under control
  conditions. Continuous arrows: evidence of the effect, dotted arrows: assumption
  of the effect.'
