caption: 'Insulin resistance is not due to a generalized impairment in insulin signaling.
  A: Insulin stimulates a signaling cascade via Akt kinase to regulate biological
  processes, such as lipolysis, protein synthesis, and glucose transport, the latter
  via GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. See the main text for additional
  details. Only a small percentage of the total phosphorylatable pool of Akt is required
  to maximally regulate downstream biological processes. Insulin-regulated glucose
  transport is selectively impaired in common insulin resistance, while other insulin-regulated
  processes in the same cell are less affected. We refer to this as cis selective
  insulin resistance. B: Analysis of studies examining insulin signaling in the muscles
  of insulin-resistant subjects that underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.
  The phosphorylation or activity of signaling elements upstream of Akt (IR, IRS1,
  PI3K), at Akt (Akt), and downstream of Akt (Akt substrates, glycogen synthase) are
  expressed as a percentage of values from healthy control subjects. Circles of the
  same color represent data within a single study; reference numbers are included
  within the circles. References () and () (green circles) highlight that defects
  earlier in the pathway are often not translated downstream.'
