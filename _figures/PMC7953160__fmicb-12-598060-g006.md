  marxianus (KM) and S. cerevisiae (SC). In the case of K. marxianus, expression levels
  of genes at 12 h after culturing were compared with those at 6 h and changes in
  expression levels were calculated as GFOLD values. Similarly, expression levels
  of S. cerevisiae genes at 24 h were compared with those at 12 h. Color bars corresponding
  to GFOLD values were shown on the top. Hollow arrow, arrow filled with slant pattern
  and blue solid arrow represent generally downregulated pathway, unchanged pathway
  and upregulated pathway, respectively.
