caption: Figure 2. LPC expansion upon chronic liver injuries. When mice are fed with
  DDC-containing diet, ductular reaction associated with activation of LPCs is induced.
  In this model, residential LPCs or a portion of the cholangiocytes interact with
  expanding Jagged-1+ portal fibroblasts and thereby activate the Notch signaling
  pathway are activated in these cells. The Notch signal may induce proliferation
  of LPCs or their progeny and direct them to differentiate along the cholangiocyte
  lineage. At the same time, Jagged-1+ fibroblasts interact with hepatocytes near
  the portal vein and activate the Notch signal in these hepatocytes. They become
  “biphenotypic cells,” which express some cholangiocyte-specific markers such as
  Sox9 and OPN. A portion of the “biphenotypic cells” further convert into cholangiocytes,
  which are incorporated into expanding ductular structures. Upon further stimulation
  (e.g., inducing Akt activation), cholangiocytes derived from hepatocytes may turn
  into intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). However, most of the biphenotypic cells
  remain around the boundary between ductular structures and the parenchymal region.
