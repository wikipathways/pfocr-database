caption: The apoptosis signaling pathway and P53 signaling pathway in the renal tubular
  epithelial cells under high glucose conditions. Purple represents proteins with
  lower levels of acetylation, red represents proteins with higher levels of acetylation,
  and yellow represents proteins with no significant difference in acetylation levels.
