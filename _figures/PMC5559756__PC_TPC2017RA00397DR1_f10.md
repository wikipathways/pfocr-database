  lines (middle panel), both  biosynthesis and degradation are accelerated, resulting
  in increased export of 18:3 and other acyl groups and their direct incorporation
  into  (reaction 2). Direct incorporation of 18:3 competes with polyunsaturated  formation
  by the acyl-editing pathway of  involving FAD2/3 (reaction 1), but leads to increased
  flux of 18:3 into the end product . As a result of increased  turnover in chloroplasts
  of PLIP1-OX lines, PA is preferably shuttled into  biosynthesis, which subsequently
  reduces its availability for  assembly in the plastid visible in changes in the  acyl
  composition. In the plip1 mutant (right panel), the PLIP1-dependent pathway is deficient,
  resulting in decreased  biosynthesis. Without the competing effect of PLIP1 on the
  acyl exchange reactions and FAD2/3, more 18:1 is converted to 18:3, explaining the
  altered acyl composition of  and other extraplastidic lipids.'
