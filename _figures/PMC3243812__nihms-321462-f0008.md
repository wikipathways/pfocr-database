caption: Beta2-adrenergic receptor engagement on a B cell that will make IgE uses
  a unique signaling pathway to increase the level of IgE produced. The β2AR engagement
  on an activated B cell that will switch to IgE production activates a signaling
  pathway involving cAMP/PKA and hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP),
  which leads to an increase in the level of p38MAPK phosphorylation. Downstream events
  affected by the β2AR-induced increase in p38mAPK involve an increase in the synthesis
  of CD23 and an increase in the level of CD23 cleaved to produce soluble CD23 (sCD23),
  which feedback on the B cell to increase the rate of IgE transcription and amount
  of IgE produced per cell. The increase in CD23 cleavage may be mediated via a β2AR-induced
  effect to either increase the localization of the CD23 sheddase ADAM10 within the
  plasma membrane to be in close association with CD23 and/or increase the shuttling
  of both CD23 and ADAM10 into exosomes that are secreted from the cell to release
  cleaved CD23. The increase in IgE is not due to an increase in the number of naïve
  B cell switching to the production of IgE.

  description: Beta2-adrenergic receptor engagement on a B cell that will make IgE
    uses a unique signaling pathway to increase the level of IgE produced. The β2AR
    engagement on an activated B cell that will switch to IgE production activates
    a signaling pathway involving cAMP/PKA and hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase
    (HePTP), which leads to an increase in the level of p38MAPK phosphorylation. Downstream
    events affected by the β2AR-induced increase in p38mAPK involve an increase in
    the synthesis of CD23 and an increase in the level of CD23 cleaved to produce
    soluble CD23 (sCD23), which feedback on the B cell to increase the rate of IgE
    transcription and amount of IgE produced per cell. The increase in CD23 cleavage
    may be mediated via a β2AR-induced effect to either increase the localization
    of the CD23 sheddase ADAM10 within the plasma membrane to be in close association
    with CD23 and/or increase the shuttling of both CD23 and ADAM10 into exosomes
    that are secreted from the cell to release cleaved CD23. The increase in IgE is
    not due to an increase in the number of naïve B cell switching to the production
