caption: 'Immune Signaling Pathways shared by the PRRs in Intestinal Epithelial Cells:
  The PRRs present in the different cellular compartments of IECs, such as the cell
  surface, and endosomes, share a common downstream signaling pathway and thus have
  an overall complementary or inhibitory effect on each other. The TLRs signal downstream
  through the common MyD88, TRIF, and IRF3 signaling molecules. Signaling via the
  MyD88 and TRIF signaling components leads to nuclear translocation of NF-κB via
  the common TRAF6 molecule and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition,
  both TLR and NOD signaling converge to activate the MAPK pathway, amplifying the
  inflammatory response. Conversely, NOD2 activation is known to dampen TLR signaling
  such as TLR4 in certain inflammatory conditions. TLR signaling via the MyD88 and
  TRIF pathways also influences the induction of autophagy by interacting with Beclin-1,
  a key inducer of autophagosome formation. Beclin-1 directly interacts with the anti-apoptotic
  proteins Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, and TLR activation leads to the phosphorylation and subsequent
  disassociation of Beclin-1 from Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, resulting in the initiation of
  autophagy.'
