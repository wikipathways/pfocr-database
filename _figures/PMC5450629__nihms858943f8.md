caption: IGF-1 is significantly upregulated in TAMs in response to long-term CSF-1R
  inhibition in GBM. IGF-1 secretion into the extracellular environment results in
  activation of IGF-1R on tumor cells, and downstream PI3K signaling to support tumor
  regrowth during continuous BLZ945 treatment. Upstream of IGF-1 in TAMs, NFAT and/or
  Stat6 transcriptional activity regulate its expression. This is thought to be initiated
  in response to IL4/IL4Ra pathway activation, feeding in from other cell types in
  the TME, including T cells (and possibly others). Multiple nodes in this signaling
  loop can be targeted therapeutically, including OSI906, BKM120, AS1517499, or FK506,
  resulting in a substantial improvement in survival in preclinical trials when combined
  with CSF-1R inhibition.
