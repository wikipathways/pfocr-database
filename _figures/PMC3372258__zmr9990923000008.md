  Sipunculus nudus. The map is redrawn based on data reported previously (). This
  free-living worm inhabits sandy marine sediments ranging from intertidal to subtidal
  zones down to a 900-m depth, where it often encounters hypoxia. S. nudus deals with
  low oxygen by using the same pathways as those found in other marine invertebrates
  facing hypoxic or anoxic conditions. Fumarate serves as the terminal electron acceptor
  in the anaerobic branch of the respiratory chain and enables the synthesis of ATP
  not only via oxidative phosphorylation but also through propionate production from
  succinate. Additional ATP can be generated from succinyl-CoA in the pyruvate degradation
  pathway, leading to acetate as an end product (). The gray shading of lines is described
