caption: Role of aryl hydrocarbnon receptor (AHR) signalling on CD4+ T cells. AHR
  signaling in FoxP3+regulatory T (Treg) cells triggers the demethylation of Foxp3
  and transactivates its promoter. AHR signalling also interferes with the activation
  of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT‐1), which mediates the
  inhibitory effects of interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) on Foxp3+ Treg cells. Finally, AHR activation
  up‐regulates the expression of CD39 and of Aiolos, which then inhibits interleukin‐2
  (IL‐2) production. AHR signalling in IL‐10+ type 1 regulatory (Tr1) cells triggers
  the expression of IL‐10 and the Tr1 autocrine growth factor IL‐21. In addition,
  AHR activation also up‐regulates granzyme B expression. AHR signalling in T helper
  type 17 (Th17) cells promotes the expression of IL‐21 and IL‐22, and it also limits
  the activation of STAT‐1 and STAT‐5, which mediate the inhibitory effects of IFNγ
  and IL‐2 on Th17 cell differentiation, respectively. Finally, AHR activation inhibits
  the production of IL‐2 through a mechanism dependent on Aiolos.
