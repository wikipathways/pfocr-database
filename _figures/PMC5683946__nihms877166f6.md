caption: NMD and apoptosis have a complex regulatory relationship I. NMD provides
  protection from apoptosis-inducing agents, including chemotherapeutic drugs. Evidence
  suggests that NMD achieves this through its targeting of Gas5 and Gadd45 RNAs, both
  of which promote apoptosis signaling. Not only does NMD regulate apoptosis, but
  apoptosis-inducing agents can impact NMD. In the example depicted, chemotherapeutic
  agents trigger cleavage of the NMD factor, UPF1, which downregulates NMD.
