caption: 'Overview of the most important metabolic processes to generate energy in
  human cells: glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, glutaminolysis and fatty acid
  oxidation. (1) During glycolysis, glucose is taken up into the cells by glucose
  transporters (GLUT) and converted into pyruvate by several enzymatic processes.
  Finally, pyruvate is transformed into lactate, which is transported out of the cell
  by monocarboxylate transporters (MCT). Pyruvate can also be converted to acetyl-CoA
  by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), which then enters the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle for mitochondrial respiration (2). During this multistep process, NADH
  and FADH2 are produced. Both molecules are necessary to complete the oxidative phosphorylation
  and drive the electron transport chain, resulting in the production of ATP. 3) During
  glutaminolysis, glutamine is taken up into the cells by several soluble carrier
  (SLC) transporters including large amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1, also known as
  SLC7A5), alanine, serine, cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2 also known as SLC1A5) and
  sodium-coupled neutral acid transporter 1 (SNAT1 also known as SLC38A1). Once glutamine
  is intracellularly present, glutamine is transformed into glutamine and α-ketoglutarate,
  where it enters the TCA cycle. 4) Finally, fatty acids are taken up into the cell
  by fatty acid binding protein (FABP), fatty acid transporter protein (FATP) and
  CD63/fatty acid translocase, where fatty acids are converted into long chain fatty
  acids and acyl-carnithine, followed by translocation to the inner mitochondrial
  membrane, where acyl-carnithine is transformed into acyl-CoA and carnithine. During
  β-oxidation, acyl-CoA undergoes several reactions, generating NADH, FADH2 (both
  necessary for the electron transport chain during oxidative phosphorylation) and
  acyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA (necessary for TCA cycle). Enzymes are shown in grey. HK:
