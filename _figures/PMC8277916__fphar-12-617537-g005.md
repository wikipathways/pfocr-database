caption: The inferred mechanism of chrysin in AD pathology. The drug acts through
  inhibition of NF-kB p65, C/EBPs and activation of NRF2, AKT pathway. The inhibition
  of NF-kB p65 and C/EBPs leads to decreased transcription of iNOS and TNF genes which
  contributes to the production of neurotrophic factors. The activation of NRF2 leads
  to the binding with Maf and ARE which increases the transcription of antioxidant
  and cytoprotective genes HO-1, CAT, and SOD. The strengthening of AKT pathway prevents
  the deactivation of MEF2D by GSK3β, where MEF2D is a key regulator for cell survival,
  mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy dysregulation. The solid lines show the
  interactions of protein kinases and translocation into the nucleus. The long-dashed
  lines show the pharmacological action of the drug.
