caption: Proposed mechanism for NTX-induced P-gp reversal, G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis
  in drug-resistant T24 cells. The molecular structure of STAT3 is classic in STAT
  family, consisting of N-term Domain for cooperative DNA binding, Coiled-coil Domain
  for STAT3 recruitment to a receptor, DNA binding Domain, Linker Domain, SH2 Domain
  for STAT3 dimerization, and Transactivation Domain for transcription activation.
  (B) STAT3 can be activated to signal through both canonical and non-canonical pathways.
  For the canonical pathway, NTX inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation at Y705 residue and
  then decreases the translocation of STAT3 dimers to the nucleus in T24/DOX and T24/CIS
  cells. The subsequent downregulation of target genes including MDR1 gene, the cell
  cycle regulatory genes such as c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and the anti-apoptotic genes such
  as Survivin, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, will reverse P-gp, trigger G0/G1 arrest, and induce
  apoptosis, respectively. For the non-canonical pathway, NTX-downregulated STAT3
  phosphorylation at S727 residue reduces the translocation of p-STAT3 (S727) to the
  mitochondria and finally induces cell apoptosis by the increased generation of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS).
