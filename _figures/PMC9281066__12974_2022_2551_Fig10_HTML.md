caption: NOX2–ROS is a double-edged sword in focal cerebral ischemic stroke. During
  the early stage of reperfusion, NADPH oxidase 2 is extensively activated, resulting
  in excessive ROS production. Excessive ROS cause overgeneration of autophagosomes,
  which on the one hand induces activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and mediates
  the inflammatory response. On the other hand, excessive ROS-dependent autophagy
  inhibits ischemic stroke-induced vascular growth. These processes aggravate stroke-induced
  brain damage. However, during the delayed stage of ischemic stroke, low levels of
  NOX2-induced ROS function as signaling molecules, and they can stimulate low levels
  of autophagosomes that inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and promote vessel
  formation, which may be achieved through the activation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-kB signaling
  pathway, thus alleviating the inflammatory response and facilitating angiogenesis
  to exert protective effects on the ischemic brain
