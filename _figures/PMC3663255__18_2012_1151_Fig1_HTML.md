caption: Notch signaling pathway. The proneural genes Mash1 and Ngn2 induce expression
  of notch ligands such as Dll1, which activate notch signaling in neighboring cells.
  Upon activation, the notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released from the transmembrane
  region and transferred into the nucleus, where NICD forms a complex with RBPj and
  induces Hes1 and Hes5 expression. Hes1 and Hes5 repress proneural gene expression.
  During maturation and trafficking to the cell surface, notch receptors undergo furin
  processing and glycosylation, which can impact their responsiveness to their ligands.
  The ligand-induced activation of notch signaling is dynamically regulated by endocytic
  trafficking, which can be modulated by the different ubiquitin ligases, such as
  Mind bom and Neuralized
