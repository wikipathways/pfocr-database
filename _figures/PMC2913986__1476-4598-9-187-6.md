caption: Gene Chip analysis reveal SOX11-induced regulation of Rb-E2F and TGF-β signaling
  pathways. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified the canonical pathway "Molecular
  Mechanisms in Cancer" as highly associated with the 3647 deregulated genes. Within
  this pathway RB-E2F (A and B) and TGF-β (C and D) signaling is regulated in a time-dependent
  manner as shown after 24 h (A and C) and 48 h (B and D) of ectopic SOX11-overexpression.
  The differentially regulated genes are marked in red or green when the mean fold
  change for GRANTA-519 and JEKO-1 was ≥1.2 or ≤1.2. The remaining differentially
  regulated genes, including genes with different kinetics in the two cell lines,
  are marked in grey.
