caption: Possible mechanism of LRP6 endocytosis and phosphorylation and their relationship
  to Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation. A, in the absence of Wnt ligands, LRP6 is
  partitioned between lipid raft and non-lipid raft domains at the plasma membrane,
  which maintains basal levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. B, the binding of Wnts
  to LRP6 and Fz co-receptors promotes their translocation to lipid rafts, where LRP6
  is accumulated, phosphorylated (p-LRP6), and internalized in a caveolin-dependent
  manner, which enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling. C and D, when clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis of LRP6 is blocked due to defective endocytosis motifs, LRP6 is distributed
  mostly in the lipid raft domains. This increase of lipid raft partition of LRP6
  leads to further enhanced phosphorylation of the receptor and Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  activation. Ymt, tyrosine mutant.
