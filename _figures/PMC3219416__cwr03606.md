caption: O-Glycosylation reaction network. (A) The single compartment O-linked glycosylation
  model for the synthesis of sLeX-type structures in human leukocyte. The core-2 trisaccharide
  (Galβ1,3(GlcNAcβ1,6)GalNAcα-, species S1) is input into a well-mixed reactor that
  contains five enzyme activities labeled E1–5 (corresponding to GalT, two SialylTs,
  GlcNAcT and FucT). The rate constant values of these five rate constants are the
  unknowns. sLeX-type structures are generated on species S14 and S17 (red box). Glycan
  distribution generated by computer modeling is compared with experimental data by
  optimizing both model structure and enzyme rate constants (E1–5). (B) Eight hundred
  thirty-seven subset models were generated by deleting one or more species and associated
  reactions in the master pathway shown in (A). Hybrid-genetic algorithm was used
  to fit each of these models. Superior models have smaller fitness functions. The
  master pathway containing all reactions does not converge to experimental data as
  well as many of the subset models.
