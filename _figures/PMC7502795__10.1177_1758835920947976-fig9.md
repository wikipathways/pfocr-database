caption: A working model for the synergistic effects of celecoxib and aspirin on non-small
  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. In NSCLC cells, the combination of aspirin and celecoxib
  affects apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Down-regulation of
  Bcl-xl and Bcl-2, while up-regulating Bax, causes an increase in the ratio of Bax:Bcl-2
  to induce the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane with the release of cytochrome
  c and the consequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis
  of NSCLC cells. Abnormal expression of cell cycle regulators, such as Cyclin D1,
  CDK2 and p21, leads to cell cycle G1 arrest and ultimately promotes apoptosis. At
  the same time, the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins was significantly down-regulated,
  which inhibited the migration and invasion of tumor cells. The ERK signaling pathway
  was also significantly inhibited in response to aspirin and celecoxib in combination
  and cell survival thus decreased. In addition, aspirin activates caspase-7 and caspase-12
  via inhibiting the expression of GRP78 protein, further enhancing ER stress-induced
  apoptosis. All of the previous may account for the synergistic effects of celecoxib
  and aspirin on NSCLC cells.ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum.
