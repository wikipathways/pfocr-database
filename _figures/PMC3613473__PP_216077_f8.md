caption: Simplified model on the effect of  and flg22 on AtPep-triggered responses.
  A, In untreated wild-type plants, AtPeps elicit a moderate defense response compared
  with -triggered responses (; ). A so-far-unknown PEPR-specific pathway leading to
  RbohD/RbohF activation is only weakly expressed; therefore, AtPeps trigger only
  low amounts of apoplastic . B,  positively regulates PEPR abundance. Increased levels
  of PEPRs trigger stronger responses upon AtPep perception. C, Previous perception
  of flg22 specifically triggers expression of the PEPR-specific  pathway. Thus, subsequent
  treatments with AtPeps lead to highly induced  production, but other AtPep-triggered
  responses remain unchanged.
