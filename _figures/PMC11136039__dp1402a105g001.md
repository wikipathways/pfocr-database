caption: Photodynamic therapy and the heme biosynthetic pathway. Exogenous 5-aminolevulinic
  acid (ALA) or methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) enter the heme biosynthetic pathway and
  are gradually converted into Protoporphyrin IX (ppIX). The proper pre-defined wavelength
  of light, which is produced by the light source, activates ppIX. This reaction eventually
  produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), which destroy the target cancer cells
