caption: (a) A hypothetical network of transcriptional regulatory associations for
  the yeast cell response to glucose limitation under QN stress. The regulatory network
  was based on the microarray results listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material
  and on the documented regulatory associations between transcription factors and
  their target genes, as compiled in the YEASTRACT database (www.yeastract.com) ().
  The entire upregulated data set was entered as target genes and grouped according
  to the respective regulators. Only transcription factors that have been described
  in the literature as regulators under glucose-limited conditions were included in
  the model network, together with MTH1 and SNF3, two target genes (white boxes) of
  the glucose-sensing pathway that are activated in response to QN. Documented associations
  may be direct, e.g., immunoprecipitation experiments (solid lines), or indirect,
  e.g., microarray data (dashed lines). The percentage of genes regulated by each
  transcription factor relative to the total number of genes in the data set is shown.
  The light-gray boxes indicate transcription factors that are included in the QN-upregulated
  data set. (b) The growth inhibition phenotype of S. cerevisiae cells induced by
  QN is reverted upon supplementation of medium with glucose. Suspensions of BY4741
  parental strain cells grown to mid-exponential phase in basal medium were serially
  diluted and spotted on QN-containing MM4 plates, supplemented or not with 1% glucose
  (for a final 3% concentration). OD600s of cell cultures, from top to bottom, were
  0.025, 0.005, and 0.0025.
