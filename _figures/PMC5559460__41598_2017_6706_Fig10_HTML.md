caption: A proposed model of interaction between CgCDPK and CgbHLH001 in CDPK signaling
  pathway in response to abiotic stresses. The reported interactions between CDPKs
  and transcription factors or related proteins are shown in solid lines; the suggested
  interaction between CgCDPK and CgbHLH001 is present in green dashed or solid line.
  Salt and drought trigger the osmotic stress and ABA synthesis to activate CDPKs,
  which in turn activate other TFs or function proteins and finally regulate gene
  expression, water transport, stomatal closure or abiotic stress tolerance. The homologs
  in Arabidopsis (shorted as At), Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (Mc), Spinacia oleracea
  (So) and Chenopodium glaucum (Cg) are shown.
papertitle: The bHLH transcription factor CgbHLH001 is a potential interaction partner
  of CDPK in halophyte Chenopodium glaucum.
