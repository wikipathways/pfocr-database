caption: 'The postulated biochemical mechanism of hyperpigmentation in megaloblastic
  anemia., The 4 most accepted mechanisms involved are: 1) low methylcobalamin level
  in melanocytes leads to reduced level of reduced glutathione (GSSH); which in turn
  activates Tyrosinase enzyme in melanin synthesis pathway, 2) defective DNA synthesis
  activates Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF); which causes activation
  of both Tyrosinase and Tyrosinase related protein 1 and 2 (TRP 1and 2), 3) hyperhomocysteinemia
  leads to accumulation of cysteine leading to increased melanin synthesis, 4) defective
  melanin transfer from the melanocytes to adjacent megaloblastic keratinocytes. Increased
  angiogenesis secondary to upregulation of dermal vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) may also lead to increased pigmentation. Both histopathologic and ultrastructural
  studies have postulated that hyperpigmentation is due to increased number of basal
  melanocytes as well as increased melanosomes.'
