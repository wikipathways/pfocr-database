caption: Proposed role of the oxidative and nitrosative stress–poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
  1 (PARP-1) pathway in oxidant-induced cellular dysfunction and necrosis. Nitric
  oxide (NO) and superoxide ( ) (derived from NADPH oxidase, mitochondria, xanthine
  oxidase and catechol oxidation) react to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which induces
  cell damage via lipid peroxidation, inactivation of enzymes and other proteins by
  oxidation and nitration, and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) among
  others (a) (). Peroxynitrite also acts on mitochondria [decreasing the membrane
  potential (Ψ)], triggering the release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome
  c (Cyt c) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) (b). These factors mediate caspase-dependent
  and caspase-independent apoptotic death pathways, respectively. Moreover, peroxynitrite,
  in concert with other oxidants [e.g. hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)], causes strand breaks
  in DNA, activating PARP-1 (c). Mild damage to DNA activates the DNA repair machinery.
  By contrast, once excessive oxidative and nitrosative stress-induced DNA damage
  occurs, as in various forms of myocardial reperfusion injury and heart failure,
  overactivated PARP-1 initiates an energy-consuming cycle by transferring ADP-ribose
  units (small orange spheres) from NAD+ to nuclear proteins, resulting in rapid depletion
  of the intracellular NAD+ and ATP pools, slowing the rate of glycolysis and mitochondrial
  respiration, and eventually leading to cellular dysfunction and death. Poly (ADP-ribose)
  glycohydrolase (PARG) degrades poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymers, generating free
  PAR polymer and ADP-ribose. PARP-1 also regulates the expression of a variety of
  inflammatory mediators, which might facilitate the progression of heart failure.
