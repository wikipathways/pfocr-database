caption: Model of the NKG2D signaling pathway in CTLs. The NKG2D cytolytic signaling
  pathway involves PLC-γ2, Vav1, and PI3-K activation (). How these upstream signaling
  events are interconnected in CTLs remains to be determined. NKG2D-mediated cytolysis
  requires activation of cPLA2 and AA release, suggesting that the level of calcium
  mobilization achieved upon NKG2D cross-linking is insufficient to allow membrane
  fusion events and exocytosis. Cytosolic PLA2 activation itself is mediated through
  two independent pathways, Vav-1→JNKK1/2→JNK1/2→cPLA2 and PI3-K→MEK1/2→ERK→cPLA2.
  It is likely that these pathways also promote granule polarization (, , ). In addition,
  cPLA2 activation is also required for NKG2D cytolytic co-stimulatory functions.
  Interestingly, IL-15, which licenses NKG2D killing in CTLs (), enhances NKG2D-mediated
  JNK, ERK and cPLA2 phosphorylation, and AA release. Once released, AA can potentially
  be reincorporated into phospholipids, mediate the biosynthesis of eicosanoids and
  induce granulocyte activation.
