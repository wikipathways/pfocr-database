caption: Following TNF stimulation, TNFR1 sequentially recruits TNFR-associated death
  domain (TRADD), FAS-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8 leading to Caspase-3
  activation and apoptosis. Both receptors can also recruit TNFR-associated factor
  2 (TRAF2), MAP/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) and MAPK kinase 7 (MKK7) leading to activation
  of the JNK pathway and the transcription factor AP-1. Recruitment of receptor-interacting
  protein (RIP) via TRAF2 leads to activation of p38 MAPK via MKK3. RIP recruitment
  can also lead to NF-κB activation via the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK) complex.
  These three pathways ultimately lead to inflammation and survival. (Adapted from
