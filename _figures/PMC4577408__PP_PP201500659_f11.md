  Three ACS members contribute to the Pst-induced ethylene biosynthesis. Among them,
  ACS2 and ACS6 are regulated by the stress-responsive MPK3/MPK6 cascade, while ACS7
  is regulated by the unidentified signaling pathways. The contribution of ACS8 is
  uncertain due to the ethylene production by . Even ACS8 is involved; its contribution
  should be minimal based on the low residual ethylene production in the acs1 acs2
  acs6 acs4 acs5 acs9 acs7 acs11 mutant inoculated with . All four ACS genes are activated
  at the transcriptional level. ACS2 and ACS6 are also regulated at the protein stability
  level by MPK3/MPK6 phosphorylation. Both the MAPK and unidentified pathways are
  activated in  and . The MPK3/MPK6-regulated ACS2/ACS6 branch is also targeted by
  the unidentified effectors. This pathway is also the major target of the -induced
  potentiation of ethylene biosynthesis. In addition, induction of ACS7 expression
  by  is potentiated by  pretreatment, which is similar to ACS2 and ACS6. In contrast,
  ACS8 is not involved in -potentiated ethylene production. ACC, 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
