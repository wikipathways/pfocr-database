caption: Relation of the studied NAFLD risk alleles to the main pathways in hepatic
  triglyceride partitioning. Liver converts carbohydrates to lipids in de novo lipogenesis.
  Newly synthesized fatty acids enter to the hepatic fatty acid pool which is also
  supplied by dietary fats and circulating free fatty acids derived mostly from adipose
  tissue lipolysis or lipoprotein lipase spillover (,). Fatty acids can be partitioned
  to oxidative pathway or esterified to triglycerides that can be stored in hepatic
  lipid droplets or used for VLDL production to be secreted from the liver (,). The
  hepatic fatty acid pool is located upstream from the lipid storage and secretion
  pathways, and thus abundance in hepatic fatty acids can contribute to both development
  of fatty liver and increased production of VLDL. In line with this, GCKR rs1260326-T
  that enhances the lipogenic pathway by providing more substrates for fatty acid
  biosynthesis () increases risk of fatty liver (,) and raises concentrations of all
  the apoB containing lipoproteins and lipids in these particles while circulating
  glucose level is marginally reduced (). LYPLAL1 may be functioning on the same hepatic
  glucose metabolism and lipogenesis related pathway, as the metabolic effects of
  GCKR rs1260326-T and LYPLAL1 rs12137855-C are highly similar (). On the contrary,
  TM6SF2 rs58542926-T impairs the secretory pathway leading to lipid accumulation
  into the liver () and reduction in levels of circulating lipids and lipoproteins
  (). PNPLA3 rs738409-G, in turn, enhances triglyceride accumulation to the storage
  pool by diminishing triglyceride hydrolysis to fatty acids (,), but does not directly
  contribute to VLDL secretion, and thus conveys no major consequences to circulation
  ().
