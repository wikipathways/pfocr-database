caption: Overview of the project. Models for the insulin binding and the subsequent
  activation of IR and IRS1 (blue box) and the dynamic GLUT4 vesicle translocation
  (green box) already exist. However, the connecting pathways between them are not
  entirely known, and several questions exist. Which are the pathways? How much does
  each pathway contribute? Is our mechanistic understanding of the insulin signaling
  chain sufficient to describe all our observations? We herein develop and test these
  three submodels (–), integrate them into a combined model (), test the model with
  respect to new validation data (), and identify unique predictions to quantify the
  properties of the three pathways (). The star in the upper model graph represents
  an unknown type of activation. IRi, internalized insulin receptor; X, unknown protein;
  YP, known activation.
