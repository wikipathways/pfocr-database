caption: 'The graphical abstract summarises the effect of hydrogen peroxide on regulatory
  components of the Ca2+ signaling pathway in salivary acinar cells. We show that
  H₂O₂ induced increased amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in parotid gland
  (PG) and submandibular gland (SMG) acinar cells and hypothesize that this disrupts
  cellular signaling that induce fluid secretion. Protein and mRNA expression analysis
  indicated that H₂O₂ exposure will interfere with neurotransmitter signaling pathways
  involving noradrenaline and acetylcholine, since the expression of both receptors
  was reduced in both PG and SMG cells. Additionally, H₂O₂ impacted Store-Operated
  Calcium Entry (SOCE) components, specifically Orai1 and STIM1, leading to differential
  expression changes in the two glands. This dysregulation can affect Ca2⁺ homeostasis
  and ion transport, and subsequently fluid secretion (Abbreviations: hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), parotid gland (PG), submandibular gland (SMG),
