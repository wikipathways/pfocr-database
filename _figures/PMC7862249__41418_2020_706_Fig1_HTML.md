caption: A Schematic of the ubiquitination cascade and opposing deubiquitination.
  During ubiquitination, ubiquitin is first attached to an E1 ubiquitin activating
  enzyme in an ATP-dependent manner before being transferred to an E2 ubiquitin conjugating
  enzyme. The Ub~E2 conjugate is then recognised by an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and ubiquitin
  is then transferred either directly to a substrate (for RING family E3 ubiquitin
  ligases) or first attached to the E3 ubiquitin ligase before being transferred to
  the substrate (for HECT and RBR family E3 ubiquitin ligases). The reverse reaction,
  deubiquitination, is catalysed by the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) which remove
  ubiquitin from ubiquitinated substrates. B Ubiquitin–proteasome system. Ubiquitination
  of substrates can target proteins directly, or via ubiquitin-binding shuttle proteins
  such as UBQLN2, to the proteasome for proteolysis. Deubiquitination at the proteasome
  by proteasome-associated DUBs (USP14, UCH37) can rescue substrates from degradation.
  C Autophagy–lysosomal pathway. Specific E3 ligases ubiquitinate protein aggregates
  (e.g. CHIP, NEDD4, TRAF6), or damaged organelles (e.g. Parkin), to recruit autophagy
  receptors (e.g. p62, Neighbour of BRCA1 gene 1 (NBR1), OPTN, NDP52, TAX1BP1) that
  can simultaneously bind ubiquitin and Atg8-like proteins (LC3s). The Atg proteins
  catalyse the conjugation of the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to LC3s and
  mediate the expansion of the autophagophore. D Non-degradative ubiquitin signalling.
  Ubiquitination can influence multiple pathways through degradative mechanisms or
  through non-degradative mechanisms. Non-proteolytic roles of ubiquitin often involve
  atypical chain linkage types.
