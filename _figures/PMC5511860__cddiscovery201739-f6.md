caption: BMP-2 induced EMT and breast cancer stemness through Rb and CD44 signaling.
  This diagram depicts the signaling pathway by which rhBMP-2 is found to induce EMT
  and stemness of breast cancer cells through Rb and CD44 to contribute to breast
  cancer metastasis. PI3K/AKT and Smad signaling pathway are implicated in the regulation
  of Rb and CD44 by rhBMP-2; cross-talk exists between Rb and CD44 signaling pathways.
