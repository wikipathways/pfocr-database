caption: 'Serotonin directly increases PTHrP synthesis in the mammary gland and indirectly
  through regulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Serotonin was shown to direct
  transcription of sonic hedgehog (Shh) in the mammary gland through methylation of
  Shh transcriptional start sites. The Shh pathway is known to be upstream of parathyroid
  hormone-related protein (PTHrP). Increased Shh also increases PTHrP, in addition
  to the direct induction of PTHrP synthesis by serotonin in the mammary epithelium.
  Serotonin''s induction of PTHrP is critical for the release of calcium from bone
  during lactation. Abbreviations: M = methylation, CaSR = calcium sensing receptor,
  ORAI1 = calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1, TSS1 = transcriptional
  start site 1 , TSS2 = transcriptional start site 2, PMCA2 = plasma membrane calcium-ATPase
  2.'
