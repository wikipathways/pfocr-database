caption: 'The therapeutics under clinical trials targeting the cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2
  infection. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to ACE2 and enters the host cell. Viral components
  are recognized by the MyD88 pathway in the endosome, leading to the releases of
  IL-6 and NFκB from immune cells including macrophages, monocytes, and dendrites.
  The possession of ACE2 by the virus causes the accumulation of Ang2 in the extracellular
  space. After the activation of AT1aR by excess Ang2 binding, sIL-6R is produced
  from the shedding of mIL-6R by ADAM10 and ADAM17 with a release of sTNFα from macrophages,
  mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and dendritic cells (DCs). IL-6 binds to the target
  cells via two signaling pathways: classic signaling only for specific immune cells,
  and trans-signaling for any cells including the immune cells, epithelial cells,
  and fibroblasts. In the classic signaling pathway, IL-6 binds to mIL-6R on the immune
  cells and activates B cells or differentiates CD8+ T cells, helper T cells, and
  Th17 cells, which triggers an anti-inflammation response. There is a negative feedback
  mechanism to the JAK-STAT pathway by SOCS3. In trans-signaling, IL-6/sIL-6R complex
  can bind to gp130 following the release of proinflammatory cytokines and IL-6 via
  three intracellular pathways without SOCS3 negative feedback. Since gp130 is highly
  expressed on almost all types of cells including the immune cells, sIL-6R shedding
  by ADAM17 provokes a surge of IL-surge mostly via trans-signaling. IL-6 stimulates
  the production of IL-6 and IL-17α from Th17 cells, resulting an IL-6 burst in its
  amplification cycle. The proinflammation cytokines increase vascular permeability
  and cell migration, enhancing the inflammation response. IL-6 also stimulates megakaryocytes,
  renal mesangial cells, and hepatocytes with the subsequent inflammatory response
  and vital organ injury. ARB/ACE-I, angiotensin receptor blocker/ACE2 inhibitor;
