caption: 'CBE1 is an eIF4E binding protein that is phosphorylated in a TOR-dependent
  manner (). CERES likewise forms cap-binding complexes with eIF4E/iso4E, which lack
  eIF4G/iso4G ().Activity of the RNA helicase eIF4A is stimulated by MRF proteins,
  likely through phosphorylation through the TOR kinase pathway (based on ). In contrast,
  phosphorylation of eIF4A by cyclin-dependent kinase may inhibit eIF4A (after Hutchins
  et al., 2004 and ). The RNA binding protein SOAR1 inhibits translation initiation,
  likely by disrupting the interaction between eIF4G and poly(A) binding proteins.
  SOAR1 can also bind directly to mRNAs such as the one for ABI5, an abscisic acid-signaling
  transcription factor (after Mei et al., 2014 and ). The jasmonic acid inducible
  protein JIP60 in barley undergoes proteolytic cleavage upon methyl-jasmonate (MeJA)
  treatment, which liberates a domain resembling ribosome inactivating protein (RIP30)
  and an eIF4E-like domain. Uncleaved JIP60 also induces the dissociation of the 80S
  subunit by an unknown mechanism (after ). MRF: MA3-containing translation regulatory
  factor; CDKA: Cyclin-dependent kinase A; eIF: Eukaryotic initiation factor; SOAR1:
  Suppressor of the ABA Receptor-overexpressor 1; JIP: Jasmonate-induced protein;
  RIP: Ribosome inactivating protein. Some of the findings presented in this figure
  are correlative or based on circumstantial evidence.'
