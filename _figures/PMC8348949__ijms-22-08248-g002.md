caption: Signaling pathways that could regulate the expression of NTN1 in GBM. (A)
  NTN1 expression could be regulated by the canonical SHH signaling pathway, as described
  recently on medullobastoma, specifically through the transcriptional function of
  activator isoforms of the GLI zinc finger proteins (Falcon et al., unpublished observations)
  []. (B) Alternatively, the NF-κB pathway could modulate NTN1 expression, directly
  through binding to the promoter region of this gene, or indirectly through the regulation
  of SHH expression [,]. GLIa, GLI 1, and GLI2 activator forms; SHH, Sonic Hedgehog
  protein; PTCH, Patched protein receptor; SMO, Smoothened protein; IκB, inhibitor
  nuclear factor kappa B; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; NTN1, Netrin-1 gene.
