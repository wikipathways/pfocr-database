caption: Schematic diagram of mechanisms for the extracellular acidification inducing
  alterations of Ca2+ fluxes. There are two components for Ca2+ elevation in response
  to elevated external protons, one is proton-sensing G-protein coupled receptors
  (GPCRs) and another is the store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway (SOCE). On one side,
  OGR1, G2A (co-expression with OGR1) and GPR4 (activated by H2O2) mediates mobilization
  of intracellular Ca2+ from SR via PLC-IP3-IP3R signaling pathway. Besides, TRPV1
  can be activated by TDAG8 and mediate extracellular Ca2+ entry. On the other side,
  SOCE is regulated by H+ binding to proton-sensing GPCRs, activating phospholipase
  C (PLC) via Gq signaling, resulting in the production of IP3. IP3 depletes Ca2+
  stores from the ER through the IP3R which is sensed by STIM1. STIM molecules multimerize
  forming puncta and translocate to co-assembling with the CRAC channel subunits ORAI1,
  activating the Ca2+ selective Icrac currents. Further, STIM1 forms the STIM1-ORAI1-TRPC1
  directly interacting with TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 to induce Ca2+ entry
