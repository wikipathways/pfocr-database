caption: 'Molecular mechanisms mediating the regulatory effects of hypoxia. Hypoxia
  affects the production, secretion, and activity of key Mɸ proteins in several regulatory
  checkpoints, generally keeping the pro-inflammatory Mɸ in check. (A) Transcriptional
  regulation in the M1-activated Mɸ in normoxia is based on the collaboration between
  NF-kB, low level of HIF-1, and additional transcription factors. In hypoxia, more
  HIFs are produced, and genes involved in angiogenesis, metabolism, and survival
  are triggered. (B) HIFs protein stability in hypoxia is increased, as the prolyl
  hydroxylases that target them for proteosomal degradation in normoxia are inhibited.
  (C) Stability of mRNA is regulated by RNA-binding proteins to the AU-rich elements
  (ARE) located in the 3′-UTR. (D) Post-transcriptional regulation – Riboswitch: The
  VEGF example illustrates how hypoxia changes secondary structures of 3′-UTR elements,
  and the binding of protein complexes to them, thus increasing their stability and
  translation. (E) Post-transcriptional regulation – microRNAs: Hypoxia modulates
  the expression of microRNAs that bind selected transcripts, thereby inhibiting or
  alleviating inhibition of their translation. (F) Post-translational regulation –
  Trafficking: Hypoxia retains secretory vesicles by inhibiting the actin cytoskeleton,
  thus attenuating the secretion of proteins such as MMP-9. Hypoxia also enhances
  the lysosomal degradation of other proteins, such as TNFα, which are secreted via
  the endosomal pathway. (G) Post-translational regulation – Localization: Hypoxia
  disrupts the interactions between iNOS and α-actinin-4, which anchors it to the
  cortical cytoskeleton, resulting in its inactivation. SV, secretory vesicles; EE,
  early endosomes; L, lysosome; SL, secretory lysosomes. +/- indicated reduced or
  inhibited transcription.'
