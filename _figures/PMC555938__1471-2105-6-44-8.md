caption: The pathway of metabolic shift regulatory system of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  in Fig. 6 is repeated as independent validation by randomly reshuffling the time
  order of microarray experiment but with the same choices of target and regulatory
  genes. Obviously, the proposed pathway in Fig. 6 is destroyed by the reshuffling
  of experimental data. The related genes are represented as ovals with different
  colors of light blue (fermentation), light yellow (gluconeogenesis), and gray (other
  relevant genes not as target genes). There are three types of lines with colors
  of red (activation), blue (repression), and black. In addition to the black line
  representing the signal pipes from genes, the red lines are shown depending on the
  degree of activation whilst the blue lines are shown depending on the degree of
  repression. The black square symbol attached on the lines is the bifurcate node
  from the same signal source. And the circle symbol attached on the lines is the
  collecting nodes from different signal sources. The colored degree bar between activation
  and repression is also shown in the bottom of the figure.
