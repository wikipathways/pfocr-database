caption: 'Estrogen pathway and cervical carcinogenesis. (a) Estrogen pathway. Estrogen
  binds to its cytosolic/nuclear receptors (ERα and ERβ) and membrane receptor GPR30
  to exert its functions. Estrogen binds to ERs in the cytoplasm and induces ER homo-
  or hetero-dimerization. Estrogen-bound ERs then translocate to the nucleus, where
  they activate or repress target genes by two different mechanisms: classical pathway:
  ER binds to ERE and modulates target genes, and non-classical pathway: ER binds
  to AP1 or Sp1 transcription factors associated with their recognition sites in enhancer
  elements and modifies their function. Estrogen also binds to the membraneous receptor
  GPR30, a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family, and rapidly transduces
  various signaling pathways including but not limited to phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Ca2+signaling (non-genomic
  pathway). (b) Progressive disease leading to cervical cancer. It is believed that
  the multipotent reserve cells present in the transformation zone of the cervix are
  the progenitor cell type for cervical cancer. High-risk HPVs (HR-HPVs), such as
  HPV-16, infect and persist in these cells, and promote their aberrant squamous differentiation,
  which leads to atypical squamous metaplasia (ASM). ASM can progress to cervical
  intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1–3 and eventually cervical cancer. This progressive
  neoplastic disease process normally takes over a decade following initial HPV infection
  before culminating in frank cancer. In most women, cervical disease spontaneously
  resolves prior to the development of cervical cancer.'
