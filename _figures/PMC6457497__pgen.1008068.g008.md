caption: ORE1 and NAP, acting downstream of EIN2 and EIN3, are the two major NAC transcription
  factors responsible for promoting Chl degradation and leaf senescence by up-regulating
  the expression of NYE1/2 as well as other SAGs. EIN3 is also involved in a feed-forward
  regulation by directly suppressing the expression of miR164, which targets ORE1
  at the post-transcriptional level [, , –]. In this study, it is revealed that, during
  leaf senescence, REF6 directly facilitates the activation of the whole pathway by
  reducing the H3K27me3 level at EIN2, ORE1, and NAP [] as well as AtNAC3, NTL9, LOX1,
  PAD4 and PPDK [–].
