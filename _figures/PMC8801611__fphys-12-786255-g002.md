caption: MRCKα signaling pathway is involved in epithelial intercellular junction
  regulation. MRCKα is activated (solid green arrow) by cdc42, a Rho family of small
  GTPases. The MRCKα kinase activates myosin light chain (MLC) either by directly
  phosphorylating/activating (green arrow) myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) or by
  inactivating (red arrow) myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), which dephosphorylates/inactivates
  (red arrow) MLC. The two consecutive negative activities (red arrows) result in
  the indirect activation of MLC by reducing MLC dephosphorylation/inactivation. These
  events regulate multiple cellular functions such as actin-myosin contraction, which
  is involved in epithelial junction regulation. In addition, our previous data indicate
  that overexpression of β1- Na+, K+-ATPase increases activation/phosphorylation of
  MLC ().
