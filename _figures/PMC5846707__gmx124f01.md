caption: Signal transduction by TGF-βs and BMPs TGF-β and BMP ligands induce formation
  of heteromeric complex between specific Type II and Type I receptors. The Type II
  receptors transphosphorylate the Type I receptors and activate the Type I receptor
  kinases. The Type I receptor transmits the signal to the cell by phosphorylating
  receptor-regulated (R)-Smads, which form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 (common
  (Co)-Smad) and translocate in the nucleus where by interacting with other transcription
  factors regulate gene transcriptional responses, chromatin remodeling, and/or control
  of microRNA processing [‘canonical (or Smad-dependent) pathway’]. Inhibitory (I)-Smads;
  Smad6 and Smad7 inhibit activation of R-Smads. In addition, the activated Type I
  receptors can activate ‘non-canonical (or non-Smad) pathway’ via different effectors,
  such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),
  p38, Rho, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), transforming growth factor beta-activated
  kinase 1 (TAK1), p21 (RAC1) activated kinase 1 (PAK1), and LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1).
  CR and TF stand for chromatin remodeling protein and transcription factor, respectively.

  description: Signal transduction by TGF-βs and BMPs TGF-β and BMP ligands induce
    formation of heteromeric complex between specific Type II and Type I receptors.
    The Type II receptors transphosphorylate the Type I receptors and activate the
    Type I receptor kinases. The Type I receptor transmits the signal to the cell
    by phosphorylating receptor-regulated (R)-Smads, which form heteromeric complexes
    with Smad4 (common (Co)-Smad) and translocate in the nucleus where by interacting

    remodeling, and/or control of microRNA processing [‘canonical (or Smad-dependent)
    pathway’]. Inhibitory (I)-Smads; Smad6 and Smad7 inhibit activation of R-Smads.
    In addition, the activated Type I receptors can activate ‘non-canonical (or non-Smad)
    pathway’ via different effectors, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases
