caption: The cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING pathway in innate immunity. Cyclic GMP-AMP
  synthase (cGAS) is a protein, which detects various cytosolic dsDNA, including viral
  DNA, damaged self-DNA released by dying cells, micronuclei, and mitochondrial origins.
  dsDNA activates cGAS via forming cGAS-dsDNA in 2:2 complexes. Mitochondrial damage
  and the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytosol also activates cGAS.
  The interactions of cGAS with DNA induce the formation of the liquid droplets through
  a phase transition, in which cGAS exerts its catalytic role to create the second
  messenger cGAMP that stimulates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) at the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). STING then translocates from the ER to Golgi compartments
  and recruits kinases such as TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IκB kinase (IKK),
  which in turn catalyzes the phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and
  the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor IκBα. Phosphorylated IRF3 translocates to
  the nucleus to activate transcription of genes encoding type I interferons and other
  inflammatory genes. IκBα phosphorylation accelerates nucleus translocation of NF-κB
  to promote transcription of target inflammatory cytokines, leading to activating
  inflammatory responses.
