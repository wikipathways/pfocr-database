caption: Molecular mechanisms involved in photoperiod-dependent responses to cold,
  drought, and osmotic stress. (A) During cold stress (indicated by the ice crystal),
  CBF gene expression is upregulated and induces the expression of COR genes resulting
  in cold acclimation. Under short-day (SD) conditions, CBF genes are strongly induced
  causing cold acclimation. Under warmer long-day (LD) conditions, PIF4 and PIF7,
  which are under the control of phyB, are higher expressed resulting in an inhibition
  of CBF gene expression. As days shorten, e.g., during autumn, this repression falls
  away resulting in cold acclimation. GI is also induced by colder temperatures and
  blocks the CBF genes, whereas CDF1 promotes the expression of CBF. GI also promotes
  freezing tolerance in a CBF-independent manner (dashed line). In addition, HOS1,
  another photoperiod-dependent flowering-inducing component inhibits CBF gene expression
  thereby blocking cold acclimation. Figure adapted from . (B) Drought stress results
  in biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA) leading to ABA-dependent gene regulation
  causing drought escape (left) and drought tolerance (right). The increased ABA levels
  promote earlier flowering (drought escape, left part) under LD but not under SD
  conditions. Under LD conditions, GI is activated and activates the expression of
  florigen genes (TSF and FT via CO) triggering the activation of SOC1 and inducing
  flowering. SOC1 in turn contributes to TSF upregulation boosting SOC1 activity.
  ABA also induces the expression and activity of ABF3 and ABF4. ABF3/4, together
  with their interacting partner, the NF-Y complex, binds to the SOC1 promoter and
  promotes its expression to accelerate flowering during drought escape. Under SD
  conditions, delay of flowering occurs during drought stress due to enhanced activity
  of repressors like FLC and SVP on SOC1 transcription. Under these SD conditions,
  GI is not activated (pale circle). Adapted from ,  and . In the drought tolerance
  signaling pathway (right part), GI forms a complex with EEL (ENHANCED EM LEVEL)
  thereby upregulating the diurnal expression of NCED3 (NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE3)
  encoding a rate-limiting enzyme in ABA synthesis. Furthermore, interaction between
  GI and miR172 results in a reduction of WRKY44 expression promoting sugar signaling
  and drought tolerance. Besides GI, also NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y (NF-Y) promotes drought
  tolerance. (C) In the absence of salt stress (-NaCl) GI represses SOS2 thus blocking
  the SOS pathway. Upon salt stress (+ NaCl), the proteasomal degradation of GI is
  promoted, releasing SOS2. Free SOS2 interacts with SOS3 to form an active SOS2–SOS3
  protein kinase complex that translocates to the plasma membrane causing the phosphorylation
  and activation of SOS1 resulting in salt stress tolerance. Adapted from . For more
  information concerning the different pathways, please refer to section “Photoperiod
  and Freezing Tolerance” for cold stress, section “Photoperiod and Drought Stress”
  for drought stress, and section “Photoperiod and Osmotic Stress” for osmotic stress.
