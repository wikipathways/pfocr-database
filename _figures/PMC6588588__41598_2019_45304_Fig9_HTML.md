caption: Data visualization of simplified Th1 Cell Differentiation pathway of two
  patients in different stages of breast cancer. A typical pathway includes multiple
  components including ligands, receptor, kinase, transcription factors, target genes,
  and biological process as mentioned in Fig. . RNA-seq fold change is ranging from
  −5 to 5. Each pathway component is assigned with RNA-seq fold change (tumor vs.
  control log2 ratio). For example, TBX21 gene of TCGA-E2-A1LH-01 has RNA-seq fold
  change of 2.18, presented in red color. Clinical and other information of subjects
  have been added to examine the model. The pathway’s activation/suppression status
  is more clear from the color coding of the genes appearing as TF targets.
