caption: Architecture of the Banana Genome Hub and Interoperability between Biological
  Information Systems. Gene report can be displayed using Tripal, GBrowse or BioMart
  and edited with Artemis. Polypeptides can then be further analyzed with GreenPhylDB
  using for instance keywords and InterPro domains, with the Galaxy workflow manager
  by running personalized phylogenetic workflows and with Pathway Tools to study metabolic
  pathways through keywords or EC numbers. Finally, SNP stored in GBrowse can be investigated
  with SNiPlay. Genetic markers can be positioned on genetic maps using CMAP and investigated
  into the TropGeneDB, linked with the MGIS through ITC accession numbers. Germplasm
  material can then be requested to the ITC. Most of the systems were embedded using
  the Drupal CMS using HTML iframe.
