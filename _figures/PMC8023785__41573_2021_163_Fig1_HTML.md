caption: a | Toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR6 are expressed
  on the cell surface, whereas TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are expressed in endosomes.
  TLR1 and TLR6 heterodimerize with TLR2 and signal through the myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88 (MyD88) pathway to activate NF-κB and MAP kinases, leading to
  secretion of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. TLR4 and TLR5 function
  as homodimers and signal through the MyD88 pathway. TLR7 and TLR9 also use the MyD88
  pathway, but rapidly activate IRF7 to induce type I interferons. TLR3 uses TIR domain-containing
  adapter-inducing IFNβ (TRIF) signalling to induce type I interferons through IRF3.
  b | Cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are sensors of pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) present
  inside the cytoplasm of the cell. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like
  receptors (NLRs) are cytosolic sensors of bacterial PAMPs but also recognize multiple
  cellular products including ATP, uric acid and K+ to activate the NF-κB pathway
  and induce cytokines driving T helper 2 (TH2) cell differentiation. Retinoic acid-inducible
  gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) are intracellular
  viral sensors that drive type I interferon response through IRF3 and IRF7. The cGAS–stimulator
  of interferon genes (STING) pathway recognized double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to induce
  the NF-κB pathway. c | C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are cell surface molecules
  expressed on multiple myeloid cell subsets. Dectins 1 and 2 and MINCLE recruit SYK1
  and activate NF-κB through the CARD9–BCL-10–MALT1 complex. Furthermore, dectin 1
  has been shown to induce the NFAT and AP1 pathways in macrophages and dendritic
  cells (DCs) and in in vitro experimental models, respectively. Dectins are also
  specialized in inducing antifungal immunity. Dendritic cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing
  non-integrin 1 (DC-SIGN) activates NF-κB via acetylation of p65; however, the resulting
  gene expression is poorly understood although IL-10 expression has been shown to
  be induced. DEC205 and DNGR1 are known to induce cross-presentation but the signalling
  pathways are unknown. ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a
