caption: Gibberellin signaling and biosynthesis pathway following Chloris virgata.
  (A) The possible GA signaling pathway in C. virgata. GID, gibberellin-insensitive
  dwarf; GAI, gibberellic acid insensitive; RGA, repressor of GA; RGL, RGA-like; SLY,
  sleepy. (B) GA biosynthesis pathway in C. virgata. GAs are products of diterpenoid
  pathway and their formation from GGDP to bioactive GAs such as GA4. CPS, ent-copalyl
  diphosphate synthase; GGDP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; ent-CDP, ent-copalyl diphosphate;
  KS, ent-kaurene synthase; KO, ent-kaurene oxidase; KAO, ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase.
  The arrows indicate each steps.
