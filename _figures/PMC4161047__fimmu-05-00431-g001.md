caption: Pathways implicated in type I IFN production following L. monocytogenes infection.
  Several cytosolic receptors are able to recognize L. monocytogenes (Lm) microbial
  components to induce type I IFN production. (Yellow) Endosomal TLRs recognize a
  variety of Lm bacterial patterns including cell wall fragments, which can also stimulate
  NOD proteins. NOD proteins require association with RIP2 to activate TBK1. Lm secretes
  RNA, DNA, and cyclic-di-nucleotides. Secreted RNA (red) binds to RIG-I or MDA5,
  both of which associate with MAVS. Cytosolic DNA (blue) can alternatively be converted
  into RNA by RNA polymerase III and induce type I IFNs through the RIG-I pathway.
  DNA is also directly sensed by DDX41 or IFI16 to induce the production of type I
  IFNs in a STING-dependent mechanism. cGAS can sense DNA and convert it into cGAMP,
  which binds with high affinity to STING to stimulate IFNβ production. C-di-nucleotides
  bind to STING directly and to DDX41, either of which may result in IFNβ synthesis.
  TBK1 and IRF3 are essential for the induction of type I IFN production during Lm
  infection, and each of these upstream sensing pathways converges on TBK1 activation.
