caption: The crosstalk between autophagy and pyroptosis. (1) SIRT3 induces the increase
  of mitophagy, inhibits the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria,
  and prevents the activation of inflammasome NLRP3. In addition, the expression changes
  of NLRP3 can reversely regulate mitochondrial damage and ROS generation; (2) Autophagy
  promotes the increase of CTSB, accelerates the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  and induces the occurrence of pyroptosis; (3) Parkin promotes the occurrence of
  mitophagy, and it also increases the expression of A20, which inhibits the nuclear
  entry and activation of NF-κB, and reduces the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  In addition, NF-κB can also promote the activation of Caspase-1 through the p62
  and Nrf2/ARE axis and accelerate the occurrence of pyroptosis. (4) Phosphorylation
  of the autophagy-related protein AMPK leads to the degeneration of TXNIP and promotes
  the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, the AMPK/mTOR pathway promotes
  the expression of SIRT1, downregulates reactive oxygen species, and prevents the
  activation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome. ↑ induce; ⟂ inhibit.
