caption: Lipoic acid synthesis and scavenging in E. coli and B. subtilis. (A) The
  E. coli lipoic acid synthetic pathway requires only two proteins, LipB and LipA.
  The LipB octanoyl-ACP transferase transfers the octanoyl moiety from the fatty acid
  biosynthetic intermediate, octanoyl-ACP, to both OADH LDs and GcvH, where LipA-catalyzed
  sulfur insertion converts the octanoyl moiety to lipoate. (B) The B. subtilis lipoic
  acid synthetic pathway requires four proteins (three enzymes plus the GcvH protein,
  on which lipoate is assembled and donated to the OADH proteins) rather than the
  two enzymes of the simpler E. coli pathway (A). Like E. coli, B. subtilis has the
  LipA sulfur insertion enzyme and an octanoyl transferase, LipM, although LipM is
  an isozyme rather than a homolog of the E. coli LipB octanoyl transferase. The octanoylated
  GcvH then becomes a substrate for LipA-catalyzed sulfur insertion at carbons 6 and
  8, as in A. The lipoyl moiety is then relayed from GcvH to the OADH subunits by
  an amidotransferase called LipL. (C) Both bacteria scavenge lipoate from the medium
  by use of the reaction shown for the E. coli lipoate ligase, LplA. The B. subtilis
  ligase is LplJ (). The ligases (which are 33% identical) are required for lipoate
  supplementation of strains blocked in lipoic acid synthesis. E. coli LplA efficiently
  lipoylates both its cognate GcvH and the OADH domains (), whereas in B. subtilis
  GcvH is a much better substrate for LplJ than are the OADH proteins ().
