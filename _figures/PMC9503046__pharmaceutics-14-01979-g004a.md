caption: Schematic diagrams of the wound healing signaling pathway, prepared using
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA, Qiagen, Germantown, MD), showing both
  inhibited and activated pathway signaling in HEPM cells 48 h after (A) 255 nm irradiation,
  (B) 405 nm irradiation, and (C) 255/405 nm irradiation. Signaling starts via TNF
  binding to the TNF receptor; EGF and TGFA binding to the EGFR; and TGFB binding
  to the TGFBR. These pathways signal through TRADD and TRAF2 to JNK and through RAS,
  RAF, and MEK to ERK1/2. Signaling continues to NF-κB, CEBPB, and AP-1 to activate
  additional CCBMs, leading to proinflammatory responses, disruption of desmosomes,
  chemoattraction of leukocytes, migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and cells,
  collagen matrix remodeling, and wound healing pathways. Pathway molecules in red
  indicate activation and molecules in green indicated inhibition. Signaling connections
  in orange indicate pathway activation and signaling connections in blue indicate
  pathway inhibition.
