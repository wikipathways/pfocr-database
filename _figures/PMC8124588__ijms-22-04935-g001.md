caption: GATA, STAT, and MITF family in anaphylaxis. (A) GATA family plays a central
  role in mast cell activity. GATA2 is key for mast cell activity. FcεRIα, FcεRIβ,
  and KIT expression is regulated by GATA2, while FcεRIα is also controlled by GATA1
  [,]. GATA1 regulates Il-4 production in basophils []. GATA1 and GATA2 regulate tryptases
  (including mTMT, mMCP6, and mMCP7). Furthermore, GATA2 regulates histamine and proteases
  (Cpa3, Mcpt4, Mcpt8, Cma1) synthesis [,]. GATA3 defines a Tfh13 population involved
  in anaphylactic IgE production []. (B) STAT family is downstream of key receptors
  and controls mast cell activity. STAT3 increases IgE-dependent degranulation in
  a canonical and non-canonical pathways increasing ATP production in mitochondria
  []. STAT5 is downstream of KIT D816V in mastocytosis, it increases cell survival,
  degranulation, leukotriene synthesis and stabilizes IL-13, IL-4, and TNFα mRNA [,].
  Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) binding to MRGPRX2 increases STAT5 activity
  []. (C) IgE-LysRS-MITF axis in anaphylaxis. MITF is downstream of KIT and IgE signaling
  [,]. MITF and KIT are reciprocally regulated [,]. Upon IgE-Ag, LysRS is phosphorylated
  by the MAP kinase pathway and translocated into the nucleus. LysRS activity in the
  nucleus dissociated MITF–HINT complex, inducing MITF transcriptional activities
  []. TFE3 is important for IgE–dependent pathway anaphylaxis by regulating FcεRI
  and KIT receptor expression []. TFEB is a master transcription factor for mast cell
  granule [,].
