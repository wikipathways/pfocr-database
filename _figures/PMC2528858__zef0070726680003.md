caption: Effects of glucose on lipid partitioning in the β-cell. In the presence of
  elevated glucose and fatty-acid (FA) levels, the increase in cytosolic malonyl-CoA
  resulting from glucose metabolism inhibits the enzyme CPT-1. Transport of LC-CoA
  in the mitochondria is reduced, and the esterification pathway is activated, leading
  to cytosolic accumulation of lipid-derived signaling molecules such as ceramide,
  diglycerides (DG), phosphatidic acid (PA), phospholipids (PL), and triglycerides
  (TG).
