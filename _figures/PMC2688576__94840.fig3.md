caption: The role of matriptase-2 in the hepcidin regulatory pathway. Beginning extracellularly
  (top of panel), BMP-2,-4 or -6 bind to the co-receptor membrane hemojuvelin (m-HJV)
  and the BMP receptor (BMPR). This initiates phosphorylation of SMAD-1,-5 and -8
  and formation of heteromeric complexes with the common mediator Smad4. Following
  nuclear translocation, the heteromeric SMAD complexes stimulate transcription of
  the HAMP gene. Negative regulation of the BMP-HJV-hepcidin pathway (designated by
  dashed red arrows) is mediated through the proteolytic processing of m-HJV by matriptase-2.
  Additional negative regulation of hepcidin transcription is provided by soluble
  hemojuvelin (s-HJV), which acts as an antagonist of the BMP pathway by competing
  with m-HJV for BMP ligands.
