caption: Representation of the two serrated pathways. The sequence leading to serrated
  Colorectal cancer (CRC) can occur in two different molecular pathways, the sessile
  and the traditional serrated routes. The tumorigenic process involves progressive
  accumulation of specific genetic and epigenetic hits affecting normal colon epithelial
  cells. In the sessile serrated pathway, the transformation of the normal mucosa
  begins with BRAF mutations, followed by p16 and IGFBP7 promoter hypermethylation
  and the consequent progression toward serrated adenocarcinoma, mainly through MLH1
  epigenetic alterations. In contrast, the traditional serrated pathway involves KRAS
  or BRAF mutations in normal colon cells which, together with MGMT or other gene
  methylation alterations, malignantly evolve toward traditional serrated adenoma
  (TSA) high-grade dysplasia and serrated adenocarcinoma (SAC).
