caption: 'A model illustrates how resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs develops due to
  the loss of PTEN expression, caused by impaired nuclear translocation of EGR1 in
  lung cancer cells: A. In cells harboring EGFR-activating mutations (EGFRm), the
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway remains continuously activated,
  promoting cell survival. PTEN normally acts as a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt
  pathway by dephosphorylating PIP3. However, EGFR mutations constitutively activate
  the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to sustained cell survival and proliferation. B. EGFR-TKI
  (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) suppresses the activation
  of EGFR tyrosine kinase, resulting in the inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling. When
  EGFR-TKIs are employed to treat lung cancer cells carrying EGFRm mutations, this
  inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling contributes to cell death. C. However, resistance
  to EGFR-TKI can develop due to the loss of PTEN expression, leading to further amplification
  of PI3K/Akt signaling. This acquired resistance allows drug-resistant lung cancer
  cell lines like PC-9/GEF to persist. Within these resistant cells, PTEN expression
  is diminished because of impaired translocation of EGR1 to the nucleus'
