caption: (Top right) Neurotropins. Initial outgrowth of neurites to form dendrites
  (total length ~100 μm) is regulated in part by spontaneous and/or neurotropin-mediated
  (e.g., BDNF) activation of lipid-modified CaMKIγ that is colocalized in a lipid
  raft with Rac and its GEF, STEF. This signaling pathway is postulated to enhance
  actin polymerization and thereby promote dendrite formation. Neuronal Activity.
  Continued dendritic arborization (total length >1000 μm) via neuronal activity requires
  Ca2+ influx through the NMDAR to activate CaMKK and both α and γ CaMKI. The CaMKIγ
  activates the MEK/Erk pathway to stimulate CREB-dependent synthesis of Wnt-2 and
  microRNA132 (miR132). Wnts are known to stimulate dendritic development via β-catenins,
  and miR132 suppresses translation of p250GAP, thereby stimulating Rac1 and dendritic
  outgrowth. Downstream targets of CaMKIα in this system remain to be identified—potential
  candidates are discussed in the text (Neuronal Development and ). Modified figure
