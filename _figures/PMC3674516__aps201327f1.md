caption: Signal pathways related with cancer stem cells. Dysregulation of signal pathway
  network plays an important role in retaining the stemness of CSCs. Pathways and
  elements involved in the control of self-renewing and differentiation of cancer
  stem cells as well as normal stem cells include PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, Wnt/β-catenin,
  hedgehog, Notch, NF-κB, ABC superfamily and so on. Depending on these aberrant pathways,
  cancer stem cells acquire its unique ability to initiate carcinoma and promote recurrence
  after surgery.
