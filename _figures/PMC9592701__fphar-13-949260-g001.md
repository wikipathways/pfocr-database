caption: 'Schematic representation of factors involved in kidney damage, hypertension
  and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Figure shows complications arise upon activation
  of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) secondary to kidney damage. Increased RAS
  activity subsequently activates angiotensin-1 receptor (AT1 receptors) via increasing
  angiotensin II (Ang II) and decreases glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Angiotensin
  1 receptor activation results in a myriad of effects such as vascular remodeling
  and inflammation, aldosterone release, sodium/H2O retention, disturbs the balance
  between antioxidant (superoxide dismutase; SOD) and oxidant (nicotine amide dinucleotide
  phosphate; NADPH) mechanisms, and increase sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation.
  A reduction in GFR causes uremia, which is associated with increased asymmetric
  dimethylarginine (ADMA) and oxidative stress, all of which predispose to endothelial
  dysfunction and loss of nitric oxide (NO) functional signaling. Impairment of the
  NO pathway and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) can subsequently predispose
  to the aggravation of SNS activation, vascular remodeling, and inflammation, further
  elevating systemic hypertension. Endothelin via endothelin-1 receptors (ET-1), on
  the other hand, can directly contribute to vasoconstriction and vascular inflammation
  and hypertrophy. In addition, CKD can also trigger vascular calcification, which
  is a hallmark of cardiovascular (CV) complications associated with the disease state.
  Together, these factors can consequently trigger/enhance the development of CKD
  complications and progression to ESRD. LVH, left ventricular hypertrophy; O2•-,
  superoxide free radical; VSMC; vascular smooth muscle cell. Figure adapted and modified
  from: (; ; ; ; ).'
