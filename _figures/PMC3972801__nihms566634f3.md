caption: (A) Many negative feedback loops in mTOR signaling. When mTORC1 is active,
  Akt activation is attenuated by inhibition of the RTK-PI3K signaling pathway through
  multiple mechanisms including inhibitory phosphorylation events on IRS by mTORC1
  or S6K1 and Rictor by S6K1, and stimulation of inhibitory adaptor protein Grb10
  by mTORC1. (B) Rapamycin relieves negative feedback loops and promotes activation
  of PI3K signaling. The inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin reduces the mTORC1-driven
  negative feedback effects, and thus activates the PI3K-Akt pathway and promotes
  cell survival. Additionally, partial inhibition of mTORC1 substrates by rapamycin
  such as 4E-BP1 may also contribute to cell survival.
