caption: SSYYJN ameliorates CKD-induced muscle atrophy by inhibiting ferroptosis in
  tibialis anterior muscle cell via HIF-1α/SLC7A11 pathway. Treatment with SSYYJN
  induces an increase in HIF-1α, which in turn promotes SLC7A11 expression, then leads
  to the increase of Gpx4, GSH and the decrease of ROS, and ultimately inhibits muscle
  cell ferroptosis
