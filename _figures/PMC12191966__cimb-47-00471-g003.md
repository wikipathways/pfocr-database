caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for falcarindiol in carrots (Daucus carota).
  The schematic illustrates the sequential biochemical transformations leading to
  falcarindiol, a key C17-polyacetylenic oxylipin. Solid arrows represent enzymatic
  steps catalyzed by characterized enzymes, including fatty acid desaturases (FAD2),
  supported by experimental evidence from gene expression and biochemical assays.
  Dotted arrows indicate hypothesized transformations, such as hydroxylation and desaturation
  steps, which remain to be experimentally validated due to limited data on specific
  enzyme involvement or substrate specificity. Colored texts differentiate enzyme
  classes, intermediates are labeled with their chemical names and structures, and
  the function of each enzyme (double and triple bond formation) are highlighted with
  yellow circles in the chemical structure of the compounds. The pathway begins with
  linoleic acid as the primary precursor, progressing through crepenynic acid and
  other polyacetylenic intermediates. Hypothetical steps are based on comparative
  genomics and metabolomic data from Apiaceae species, with gaps highlighted for future
  research
