caption: Targets of acetylation/deacetylation in metabolic pathways known to affect
  I/R injury. Sirt 3 is known to deacetylate many mitochondrial enzymes that can contribute
  to I/R injury. Increased Sirt 3 activity is beneficial in cardiac disease whereas
  inhibition of class I HDAC activity is protective. Therefore, it appears that Sirt
  3 and the mitochondrial HDAC1 may target the deacetylation of unique sets of lysine’s
  in the mitochondria. The acetylation of some of those lysine’s affecting pathway
  activity beneficial for cardioprotection in I/R and some contributing to I/R injury.
