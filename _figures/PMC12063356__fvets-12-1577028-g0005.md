caption: 'Combined Ibr + AS treatment modulates both upstream and downstream effectors
  of the BCR (A, B) PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. KEGG (58, 59) pathway graphs rendered
  by “pathview” (57) R package for the “B-cell receptor signaling pathway” (hsa04662)
  and “PI3K-Akt signaling pathway” (hsa04151). Rectangular boxes represent proteins
  and circles, metabolites. Boxes with rounded corners contain references to other
  pathways. Rectangular boxes are divided into three segments; from left to right,
  these segments represent: single treatment with AS, single with Ibr, and combined
  treatment with Ibr and AS. Segments are colored based on the log2 FCs relative to
  the DMSO control of the RNA transcripts of the respective proteins. Proteins encoded
  by genes that are not differentially expressed nor members of a potentially relevant
  module (lightgreen, salmon, darkmagenta, lightcyan1 or cyan) are shown in gray.
  White rectangular boxes correspond to RNA transcripts that were considered non-expressed
  or undetected. Canine genes (Entrez IDs) were mapped to their human orthologs. (A)
  Despite reduced protein expression of BTK, Ibrutinib treatment led to increased
  BTK mRNA levels, suggesting compensatory mechanisms. Nevertheless, FOS, the gene
  encoding a subunit of the AP-1 transcription factor, a downstream effector of the
  BCR pathway, was significantly downregulated. Note that the gray box labeled “PI3K”
  represents the catalytic (PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, and PIK3CG) and regulatory subunits
  (PIK3R1, PIK3R2, PIK3R3, PIK3R5, and PIK3R6) of the PI3K enzyme complex. (B) AS
  treatment selectively inhibited PI3K activation. We see strongest downregulation
  of PI3K class IA and upregulation of PI3K class I B in the combined treatment group.
  PI3K class I B constitutes the main target of AS, PIK3CG, as well as its regulatory
  subunits PIK3R5 and PIK3R6 which Ibr + AS seem to especially be influencing. Downstream
  thereof is AKT, an upstream regulator of MYC and BCL2. Although the isoform AKT3
  was upregulated in Ibr + AS, MYC expression was substantially higher and BCL2 expression
  was substantially lower in the combined treatment'
