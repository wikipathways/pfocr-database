caption: The NLRP3 inflammasome in the liver fibrosis. After the PAMPs act on the
  livers, they destroy the hepatocytes, and activate the NLRP3 inflammasomes in hepatocytes,
  leading to hepatocyte necrosis. The necrotic liver cells release DAMPs, which can
  activate Kupffer cells (KCs). The KCs recognize PAMPs through TLRs on the one hand,
  and induce the expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome-related pathway components such
  as NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, and pro-IL-1β through TLRs-NF-κB pathways. On the other
  hand, the KCs recognize DAMPs, which can directly damage mitochondria and cause
  them to release ROS. As the upstream signal of NLRP3, ROS activates NLRP3 through
  the ROS-TXNIP pathway. ROS also promotes the transfer of high mobility group box
  1 (HMGB1) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The HMGB1 can also activate NLRP3 through
  the TLR4-NF-κB pathways. After NLRP3 is activated, NLRP3 forms NLRP3 inflammasome
  together with ASC and pro-caspase-1. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
  (Nrf2) is an important transcription factor that regulates cellular anti-oxidative
  stress. Under physiological conditions, the cytoplasmic protein chaperone molecule
  Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in KCs binds to Nrf2 and makes it appear
  to be inhibited. When mitochondria release ROS, Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1 and
  moves into the nucleus, and combines with the antioxidant response element (ARE)
  to activate the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression to inhibit
  the activation of ROS/NLRP3 inflammasome pathways. The antioxidant response cannot
  resist the oxidation response, which leads to the KCs activation. Activated KCs
  activate HSCs by releasing TGF-β and IL-1β, which activate the NLRP3 inflammasome
  in HSCs. The activated HSCs express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and Collagen I,
  leading to ECM deposition and eventually progressing into liver fibrosis.
