caption: Negative impact of phytohormones upon plant defenses against viruses. Aux
  and SA have an antagonistic relationship. Movement of several types of viruses is
  dependent upon Auxin response factors (ARFs), e.g., TMV. Similarly, Et and SA show
  antagonism and are actively involved in CaMV symptom development. TMVcg also antagonizes
  the pathway downstream of SA signaling and is involved in symptom development on
  Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) infection, systemic movement of TMVcg, and infection
  establishment. JA and ABA show multiple characteristics regarding plant defenses.
  For example, at earliest of the virus infection, JA supports plant defense systems,
  but once the infection is established solely and gets matured, JA production turns
  towards the favor of virus. ABA antagonizes with the SA pathway leading towards
  the reduction in resistance at local sites of infection.
