caption: Representation of the multifaced functional roles of TRIM proteins within
  a brain tumor cell. (a) Summary of TRIM proteins and their involvement in critical
  signaling pathways and gene regulation. Their contribution to activation (positively
  correlated TRIMs) is marked with bold black letters, while the ones leading to downregulation
  of the pathway (negatively correlated TRIMs) are shown with red. (b) Characteristic
  example of TRIM28 oncogenic mechanism of function leading to autophagy inactivation
  and mitochondrial dysfunction through AMPK inhibition in a glioma cell. (c) TRIM28
  epigenetic mechanism of action for transcription regulation in neuronal progenitor
  cells. TRIM28 plays a key role in controlling neuronal differentiation processes
  by establishing local heterochromatin with H3K9me3 enrichment to transposable elements
  and their target genes which are responsible for neuronal proliferation. Loss of
  TRIM28 leads to upregulation of the ERV-mediated transcriptional network (created
  by BioRender.com (2022)).
