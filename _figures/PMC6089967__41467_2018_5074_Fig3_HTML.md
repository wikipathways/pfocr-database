caption: Association among susceptibility pathways and GO terms. a Each node is a
  subcomponent. Connecting lines are drawn if the overlapping coefficient between
  the two nodes is greater than 0.8. This picture was drawn by Cytoscape with EnrichmentMap
  plugin, using the standard gene set file. b The relationship between the susceptibility
  GO terms. The relationship between the GO terms was based on the knowledge from
  the European Bioinformatics Institute. All gene sets which were enriched in our
  GWAS pathway analyses were colored. Of the GO terms, 10 terms belonged to a transporter
  activity term. Both substrate-specific transporter activity term and transmembrane
  transporter activity term are part of the transporter activity term and have a child
  term of substrate-specific transmembrane transporter activity. Both terms of substrate-specific
  channel activity and ion transmembrane transporter activity are part of the substrate-specific
  transmembrane transporter activity term, and have a child term of ion channel activity
  which had a child term of cation channel activity. In addition, cation transmembrane
  transporter activity was part of ion transmembrane transporter activity, and had
  a child term of metal ion transmembrane transporter activity. Gated channel activity
  term was a child term of transmembrane transporter activity and shared several child
  terms with ion channel activity term
