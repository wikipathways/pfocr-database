caption: Metabolism in totipotent stem cells. (A) Glycolysis is impaired due to the
  low activities of the rate-limiting enzymes hexokinase (HK) and phosphofructokinase
  1 (PFK1). Totipotent stem cells use pyruvate as their major energy and carbon source
  instead, via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to generate acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) and via
  pyruvate carboxylase (PC) to generate oxaloacetate (OAA) for anaplerosis or gluconeogenesis.
  (B) ATP synthesis is dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation driven
  by the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthase. However, as mitochondrial
  replication has not yet initiated, the halving of mitochondrial mass with each round
  of mitosis leads to a drop in ATP levels during embryo cleavage. (C) Simultaneously,
  each mitochondrion matures and the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm)
  increases steadily, thus turning the exponential drop in ATP into a linear drop.
  (D) Bicarbonate (HCO3−) is needed to buffer the pH and also provides a carbon source
  to OAA in the Krebs cycle for anaplerosis via PC or to nucleotide synthesis for
  DNA and RNA via carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CAD). F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase
  A; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
