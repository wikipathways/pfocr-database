caption: Parallel comparison for the induction of AMPs after recognition of microbial
  molecules in beetle, fly, and mammalian. The Lys-type PG-dependent Tenebrio Toll
  signaling pathway was previously reported by our group (). Drosophila Toll and Imd
  pathways were reviewed by Lemaitre and Hoffmann (). The mammalian β-defensin induction
  pathway was reported by Ganz and co-workers (). Namely, mammalian Toll-like receptor
  (TLR)-dependent expression of AMPs in keratinocytes is induced by an activated cytokine,
  IL-1, which is directly inducible by TLRs of monocytes and macrophages (). A plus
  sign in mammalian β-defensin induction pathway means the interaction between ligand
  and its receptor.
