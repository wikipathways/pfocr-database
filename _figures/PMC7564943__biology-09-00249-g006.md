caption: AhR-induced cyclooxygenase (COX) 2/PGE2/EP4 has differential effects in anti-viral
  cells vs. cells of the ‘cytokine storm’. Levels of acetyl-CoA may be significant
  determinants of AhR effects via the COX2/PGE2/EP4 pathway via acetyl-CoA using sphingosine
  from sphingosine kinase (SphK) to produce N-acetyl-sphingosine (N-ASph), which,
  like aspirin, acetylates and inhibits COX2. Acetyl-CoA, as a co-substrate for AANAT,
  also increases melatonin, which also inhibits this AhR-driven pathway. As such,
  acetyl-CoA may act to co-ordinate N-ASph and melatonin production and effects, with
  their differential consequences in NK cells and CD8+ t cells vs. macrophages, neutrophils,
  and mast cells. This would suggest that variations in acetyl-CoA in these cells
  will determine their differential activation in SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as
  in cancers. The suppression of melatonin by the AhR in all of these cell types will
  contribute to their dysregulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection, whilst the suppression
  of pineal melatonin, via a decrease in Bmal1-induced PDC and therefore acetyl-CoA
  production, will be important in driving the dysregulated immune response in the
  aged population as well as in those with high-risk, pre-existent medical conditions.
  N-ASph can also increase SPMs in macrophages, which, along with autocrine melatonin,
  switches activated macrophages to a more quiescent phagocytic phenotype.
