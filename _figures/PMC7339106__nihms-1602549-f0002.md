caption: In the TME, CD200 is mainly expressed in some types of cancer cells, activated
  immune cells such as T cells, and endothelial cells, while CD200R is predominantly
  expressed in myeloid cells such as TAMs, MDSCs and DCs. Tregs also express significant
  levels of CD200R. Interactions among these cell types in TME are likely to determine
  the outcome of the tumor associated inflammation and immune response, and subsequently
  affect tumor growth and metastasis.
