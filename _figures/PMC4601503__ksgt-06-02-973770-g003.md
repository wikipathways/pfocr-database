caption: Binding proteins. (A) Direct binding partners of P-Rex1 (1) and P-Rex2 (2).
  Considering their size and the abundance of protein interaction domains in P-Rex
  family Rac-GEFs, remarkably few proteins have been identified that bind directly.
  The substrate Rac and the activator Gβγ bind directly to the DH domain and the phosphoinositide
  activator PIP3 to the PH domain. PP1α-binds directly to the RVXF motif and dephosphorylates
  S1165 of P-Rex1, another direct mechanism of activation. PKA directly inactivates
  P-Rex1 (P-Rex2 was not tested) but the binding and targets sites are unknown (as
  denoted by the question mark). Apart from these regulators, mTOR and PTEN are known
  to bind directly. P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 bind to mTOR through their DEP domains and form
  part of TORC1 and TORC2. P-Rex1 affects mTOR responses, but it is unclear whether
  up- or downstream. P-Rex2, but not P-Rex1, binds to the tumor suppressor PTEN through
  its PH domain, thus inhibiting PTEN phosphatase activity, although the IP4P domain
  also contributes to PTEN binding. Additional interactions, which may be indirect,
  are seen in vivo. Unidentified serine kinases regulate P-Rex1 activity upon RTK
  stimulation of breast cancer cells, and PKCδ or Akt regulate its activity upon overexpression
  in COSphox cells. P-Rex2 interacts with IGF1 receptor in HEK-293 cells. P-Rex1 interacts
  with Akt1 in overexpressing HEK-293 cells, likely through TORC, with overexpressed
  PDGFRβ in immortalized human fibroblasts, with ephrin-B1 in mouse embryonic cortex,
  with EHBP1 in prostate cancer cells, with the Rap1-GTP binding domain of RalGDS
  in HUVECs, and its isolated PDZ domains interact with Edg1 in overexpressing HEK-293
  cells. Arrows denote activation, blunt ends show inhibition, and bobble-ends show
  direct binding. (B) Roles of P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 in Insulin signaling. Insulin or
  IGF-1 binding stimulate the Insulin receptor which leads to activation of tyrosine-kinase
  sensitive class 1A PI3Ks. These PI3Ks produce PIP3 which directly activates both
  P-Rex1  and P-Rex2  to stimulate Rac GTP-loading and Rac-dependent responses such
  as cell migration. P-Rex2, but not P-Rex1, inhibits PTEN, thereby blocking the removal
  of PIP3 by PTEN and enhancing PI3K signaling. PIP3 also directly activates PDK1
  which activates Akt by phosphorylating T308 and the downstream signaling cascade
  that stimulates cell growth. In addition, PIP3 activates the TORC2 complex (=PDK2),
  leading to further activation of Akt (phospho-S473), and activation of Rac through
  an unknown pathway that may involve P-Rex. P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 also both directly
  bind to the TORC1 and TORC2 complexes, although it is still unclear how this affects
  both mTOR signaling and P-Rex activity.
