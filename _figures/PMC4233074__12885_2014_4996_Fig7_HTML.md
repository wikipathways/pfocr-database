caption: Working model of insulin’s effects at different stages of pancreatic cancer.
  Our data support a model whereby primary pancreatic duct cells respond to insulin
  (mostly via AKT signalling), but do not increase proliferation or survival. On the
  other hand, proliferative and cancerous pancreatic ductal cells respond via both
  AKT and ERK signalling, with cell survival predominantly controlled by the ERK pathway.
