caption: Nucleotide synthesis, structure, and nomenclature. A, ribose 5-phosphate
  (R5P) is produced by the metabolism of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) through the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP). Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is essential for both
  salvage purine synthesis and de novo purine synthesis. The inhibitors DON and azaserine
  inhibit enzymes in the de novo purine synthesis pathway proximal to the intermediate
  AICA-Rt. The nucleoside AICA-Rs is readily transported across the cell membrane
  and is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase to the de novo synthesis pathway intermediate
  AICA-Rt. B, nucleobases and nucleosides are readily transportable across the cell
  membrane. Nucleotides (phosphonucleosides) have low cell membrane permeability.
  C, de novo and salvage purine synthesis both depend on PRPP. The carbon 5′-phosphate
  moiety of PRPP, originally added to glucose by hexokinase, defines purine synthesis
  pathway intermediates as nucleotides. In de novo synthesis, the purine ring is built
  directly onto PRPP. In contrast, the pyrimidine nucleobase is synthesized independently
  of PRPP, which is added to the complete nucleobase to form a pyrimidine nucleotide.
  GAR, glycinamide ribonucleotide; NTP, nucleotide triphosphate; AK, adenosine kinase;
  arrows represent multistep metabolic pathways.
