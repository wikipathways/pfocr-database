caption: 'Canonical Pathway of ‘CREB Signaling in Neurons’ (IPA, p-value 3.02E-05).
  Color red: the darker, the more damaging mutations were found by exon sequencing.
  Color pink: overlap of genes within dataset of 282 damaging mutations. Color pink
  double bordered: shows more than one gene within a complex. Genes from the dataset
  involved in the pathway are: PRKDC, NRAS, TYK2, CREBBP, PIK3C2G, ATR, JAK2, PRKD3,
  ATM.'
