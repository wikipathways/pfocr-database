caption: The inflammatory signaling pathway involved in AD is depicted in the figure.
  It involves the activation of microglia and astrocytes, leading to the release of
  inflammatory cytokines. This activation also triggers the release of amyloid beta,
  a protein that is crucial for the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles
  and proinflammatory cytokines contribute to neuronal dysfunction, a key characteristic
  of AD (Gómez-Benito et al., 2020; Pajares et al., 2020)
