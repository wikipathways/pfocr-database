caption: 'Maintaining the suppressive phenotype of effector regulatory T cells (eTregs)
  is an active process which involves epigenetic, transcriptomic, and post-translational
  regulation of FoxP3. Demethylation of the enhancer CNS2 within the FoxP3 locus is
  an absolute prerequisite to initiate a stable eTreg program. External signaling
  catalyzes methylcytosine demethylation of CNS2, presumably via activation of the
  methylcytosine dioxygenase Tet2, Tet3, and Mecp2, to enable recruitment of phosphorylated
  STAT5 and associated-transcription factors which initiate FoxP3 transcription upon
  binding to the FoxP3 promoter. The required chromatin accessibility of the FoxP3
  promoter is modulated by histone acetylation and trimethylation via Mecp2 and Ezh2,
  respectively. Conversely, inflammatory mediators promote activation of the methyltransferase
  Dnmt3a and Dnmt1 to inhibit CNS2 accessibility to transcription factors. STAT3 and
  STAT6 can directly compete with STAT5 for binding to the CNS2 locus and thus impede
  FoxP3 transcription. DNAM-1 competes with TIGIT for CD155 binding, resulting in
  the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC pathway, which represses FoxP3 transcription.
  Similarly, IL-1β- mediated expression of Id2 blocks the transcription of FoxP3.
  At the protein level, pro-inflammatory cytokines can promote FoxP3 ubiquitylation
  and subsequent proteasomal degradation and activate a DBC1/caspase-8-mediated downregulation
  of the FoxP3 protein.Blimp-1: B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1; CNS2: conserved
