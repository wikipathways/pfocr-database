caption: 'All steroids derive from cholesterol, which can be synthesized within the
  brain for de novo neurosteroidogenesis (). To synthesize estrogen from cholesterol,
  four major steroidogenic enzymes and at least one carrier protein are necessary
  (). The initial step in steroid synthesis is the transport of cholesterol to the
  inner mitochondrial membrane, where the first steroidogenic enzyme resides. Two
  proteins have been implicated in cholesterol transport through the interstitial
  space of the mitochondria: the Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein (StAR) and
  the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO; previously known as the peripheral-type
  benzodiazepine receptor). These proteins, potentially working in a complex (), facilitate
  the movement of cholesterol so it can be cleaved by cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage
  (CYP11A1) to produce pregnenolone, the first steroid in the steroidogenic pathway.
  Pregnenolone can be further metabolized by two enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-Δ4
  isomerase (3 β -HSD) or cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (CYP17). The
  activity of 3β-HSD converts pregnenolone to progesterone, and CYP17 converts pregnenlone
  to the androgen dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). 3β-HSD can also act on DHEA to synthesize
  another androgen, androstenedione (AE), and CYP17 converts progesterone to AE. Aromatase
  is the enzyme necessary to convert androgens such as AE and testosterone to the
  estrogens estrone and estradiol, respectively. AE and testosterone, and estrone
  and estradiol, can themselves be interconverted through the action of types of 17β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenases (17β-HSD). The enzymes 5α- and 5β-reductase are also active in avian
  brain, and are involved in the reduction of androgens (e.g., to produce the potent
  androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)) and progestins (e.g., to produce the reduced
  pregnanes 5α- and 5β- allopregnanolone that allosterically modulate the GABA-A receptor,
  see below).'
