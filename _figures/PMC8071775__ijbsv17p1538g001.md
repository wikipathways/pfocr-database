caption: Schematic of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry, RNA release and synthesis, and
  virus assembly and release in the extracellular space. The endocytic pathway plays
  a critical role in the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and serves as target
  for the potential therapeutic effects of HCQ/CQ in COVID-19.
