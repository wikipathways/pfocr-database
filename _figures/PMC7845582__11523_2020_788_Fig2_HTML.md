caption: 'Optimal antigen processing and presentation by DCs is important for effective
  immune-mediated tumor cell destruction []. Antigens enter DCs through multiple mechanisms,
  including endocytosis, phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated uptake.
  These antigens are processed by DCs into peptide fragments (epitopes) before being
  loaded onto MHC class I molecules through cross priming or MHC class II molecules
  through the classical exogenous presentation pathway. T cell recognition of these
  epitopes occurs via binding between the TCR and the peptide-MHC complex on the DC.
  Following epitope recognition, CD40L expressed by CD4+ T cells activates DC-expressed
  CD40 to promote DC maturation and IL-12 secretion. This subsequently stimulates
  CD28 signaling and activation of CD8+ T cells. When the TCR of an effector CD8+
  T cell binds to a tumor cell, an immunological synapse forms and lytic granules
  are secreted by the effector CD8+ T cell, resulting in tumor cell destruction. Note:
  Cytosolic and vacuolar pathways for cross-presentation have been described. The
  figure presents the cytosolic pathway as it has been suggested this is the predominant
  pathway for cross-presentation []. [Figure adapted with permission of the Journal
