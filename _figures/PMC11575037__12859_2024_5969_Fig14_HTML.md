caption: The figure shows selected subnetwork of the differential network for Artery
  Coronary tissue in Atherosclerosis. In detail, starting from the differential network,
  we highlighted the genes involved in the pathways resulted from enriched analysis
  in yellow, whereas the genes not involved in pathways are identified in grey. In
  particular, the genes involved in PPAR signaling pathway are reported in yellow
