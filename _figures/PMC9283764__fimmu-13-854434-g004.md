caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis. Biological networks for the TNF signaling of
  genes with ≥2-fold changes in their expression level are shown for the KO LAC of
  both sexes at 6 h after infection. Direct and indirect gene interactions are marked
  with solid and dashed lines, respectively. Networks on the left and right show one
  pathway for male mice and two pathways for female mice, respectively. The different
  shapes depict different functional classes as follows: Square and concentric (double)
  circles denote cytokines and complex/groups, respectively. Diamonds denote peptidases
  and enzymes. Ovals denote transmembrane receptors and transcription regulators;
  triangle, kinases and phosphatases; rectangles, ion channels, G-protein-coupled
  receptors, and ligand-dependent nuclear receptors; and trapezoids, microRNAs and
  transporters.'
