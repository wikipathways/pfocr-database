caption: Cascade of events that follows a hypoxic-ischemic insult and over-stimulation
  of glutamate receptors in the brain. This cascade evolves over days to weeks and
  involves signaling to the mitochondria and nucleus. Very severe injury to the mitochondria
  leads to complete energy failure and destruction of cell membranes associated with
  necrosis. Milder insults activate apoptosis, which is much more prominent in infants
  than in adults. In addition to an extrinsic FAS death pathway (not shown), caspase-dependent
  and non-caspase dependent pathways activate apoptosis in the nucleus. Work in rodents
  indicates that these pathways are sexually dimorphic with males preferring the PARP-AIF
  non-caspase pathway more than females. This pathway is also more easily activated
  by glutamate receptor stimulation. In contrast, the cytochrome C- caspase 3 pathway
  is more active in females. ROS = reactive oxygen species; AIF = apoptosis inducing
  factor; CYTO-C = cytochrome C; PARP = Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.
