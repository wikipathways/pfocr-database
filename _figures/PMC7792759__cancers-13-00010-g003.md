caption: TGFβ signalling pathway in breast cancer cells. The reception of the TGFβ
  signals by the TGFβ receptor type II allows the phosphorylation of the TGFβ receptor
  type I. Subsequently this favour the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 proteins that can
  in turn interact with the protein SMAD4. This complex of proteins controls the expression
  of TGFβ target genes, affecting cellular processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis,
  metastasis, and angiogenesis. The expression of the TGFβ’s genes is regulated by
  HOX transcriptional factors, as HOXB7 in breast cancer. After its transcription
  (nucleus) and translation (cytoplasm), TGFβ ligands are exported to the ECM, where
  they recognize and are recognized by TGFβ receptors type II.
