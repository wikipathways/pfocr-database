caption: Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) activation is achieved through multiple receptor-dependent
  signal transduction pathways downstream of both the Ras oncogene (via the MAPK pathway)
  and Phospholipase C (PLC; via protein kinase C). Activated EGR1 rapidly enters the
  nucleus and binds to 2 response elements on the STIM1 gene sequences to induce its
  expression. However, Wilms Tumor Suppressor 1 (WT1) inhibits binding of EGR1 at
  the first response element, thereby repressing STIM1 expression. However, changes
  in STIM1 expression affect cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, thereby indirectly modulating
  EGR1 expression via protein kinase C (PKC)-, protein kinase A (PKA)- and calmodulin
  kinase (CamK)-dependent pathways.
