caption: Transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of programmed-death ligand
  1 (PD-L1) by Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is involved in
  transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
  in immune and tumor cells. Toll-like receptor (TLR)- and cytokine receptor-signaling
  induce NF-κB activation and trigger its nuclear translocation enabling its binding
  to the PD-L1 promoter [,,]. TLR- and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-signaling
  activate the canonical NF-κB pathway by signaling via the IκB kinase (IKK) complex
  []. The exact mechanisms by which interferon γ (IFNγ) and interleukin-17 (IL-17)
  activate NF-κB are not completely understood. Aberrant expression of the oncogenes
  B cell lymphoma 3 (Bcl3) and mucin1 (MUC1) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
  mutations are also described to induce NF-κB-mediated PD-L1 transcription [,,].
  NF-κB post-translationally regulates PD-L1 expression by inducing transcription
  of the COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5 (COPS5) gene encoding the fifth element
  of the COP9 signalosome (CSN5), which deubiquitinates and therefore stabilizes PD-L1
  []. All of these mechanisms lead to high PD-L1 expression on tumor cells thereby
  contributing to tumor immune escape. Arrows indicate paths to NF-κB activation,
  dotted arrows indicate protein translation and translocation, T-bars indicate inhibition.  was
