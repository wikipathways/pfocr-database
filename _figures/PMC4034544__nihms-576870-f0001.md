caption: MAPK pathway signaling in malignant melanoma leads to phosphorylation and
  activation of RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK, a process that ultimately regulates the cell
  cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis. Mutated BRAF, which is 500-fold activated,
  stimulates constitutive signaling, proliferation, and survival, making it an excellent
  target for vemurafenib and dabrafenib. Trametinib inhibits MEK, situated downstream.
  MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase
