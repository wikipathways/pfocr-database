caption: 'Cellular signaling through pre-organized and inter-connected nanocluster
  assemblies with gel-like properties. Examples of clusters illustrate Ras activation
  and scaffolding proteins, such as IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein
  1 (IQGAP1). Ras is a small GTPase that is related to numerous cellular functions,
  including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, fate specification, and differentiation.
  A key Ras effector pathway is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,
  i.e. Raf/MAPK kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Raf/MEK/ERK) pathway.
  Ras is normally activated in response to the binding of extracellular ligands, such
  as epidermal growth factor (EGF), to a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), e.g. epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR). The signal triggered by EGF binding to the extracellular
  domain of EGFR is transmitted through the transmembrane domain resulting in EGFR
  dimerization and activation. Signalling proceeds through SHC-transforming protein
  1 (SHC), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and son of sevenless (SOS),
  the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GEF exchanges GDP by GTP, activating
  Ras. Active, GTP-loaded Ras dimerizes and binds Raf, thereby promoting Raf dimerization
  and activation. Active Raf dimer phosphorylates and activates MEK, which induces
  ERK activation. Ras activates a number of signalling pathways. Ras in the active
  GTP-bound state regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. PI3K is
  a heterodimer containing a regulatory (p85) and catalytic (p110) subunits. RTKs
  recruit the p85 subunit of PI3K. Ras activates p110 independently of p85. PI3K phosphorylates
  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3), which recruits phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and phosphorylates
  a serine/threonine kinase, Akt (also known as PKB, protein kinase B) in the plasma
  membrane. This further induces the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  complex, one of the major pathways leading to cell growth. A scaffolding protein,
  IQGAP1, a large multi-domain protein binds to tens of partners and regulates the
  function of numerous proteins. Over 90 proteins have been reported to associate
  with IQGAP1, directly or as part of a larger complex. These include cytoskeleton
  proteins actin and myosin, as well as other proteins, which are also partners of
  IQGAP1. Actin is a scaffolding protein too with many partners and also anchors to
  the membrane such as Ras and Raf. As figure shows, IQGAP1 is a scaffold in the MEK/ERK
  cascade and binds to many proteins including Raf, calmodulin, and S100 calcium binding
  protein B (S100). Multivalent membrane-anchored proteins and intracellular multiproteins
  form gel-like complexes in a network with transient connections. Abbreviations used
  in the figure are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; Cdc45, cell division control
  protein 42 homolog; Clip-170, cytoplasmic linker protein-170; Rac1, Ras-related
  C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1.'
