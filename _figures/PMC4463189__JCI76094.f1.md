caption: 'Survival: Kinase pathways regulate programmed cell death by either directly
  modulating apoptosis regulators or altering their expression. Necroptosis is controlled
  by signaling pathways that intersect apoptosis regulators, including RIPK3. Motility:
  Cytoskeletal dynamics are mediated by RTKs and integrin clustering to promote the
  activation of FAK and GTPases. Effector kinases include ROCK1, MLCK (encoded by
  MYLK3), PAK1, and LIMK1. Evading antitumor immunity: Numerous cell types, including
  CTLs, Tregs, DCs, MDSCs, and macrophages, are actively involved in modulating the
  tumor immune response. MAP4K1, PI3K∂, MST1R, MERTK, and PKCη, represent potential
  targets for reversing the myriad mechanisms involved in tumor-mediated immunosuppression
  of the tumor microenvironment. Proliferation: MAPK pathway components increase levels
  of CCND1. CCND1 regulates the activity of CDK4/6 and, in turn, induces cell cycle
  progression via RB1 and E2F transcriptional regulators. DNA damage checkpoints:
  Following induction of double-strand DNA breaks by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic
  agents, ATM and ATR phosphorylate CHK1. Activated CHK1 subsequently prevents cell
  cycle progression and induces DNA repair mechanisms. Angiogenesis: Tumor cells modulate
  the microenvironment by secreting angiogenic factors (ligands for VEGFR, FGFRs,
  and the angiopoietin receptor TIE2 [encoded by TEK]) to stimulate endothelial cells
  and enhance vascularization. Pericytes are in turn stimulated by PDGF and TGF growth
  factors to contribute to endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Metabolism:
  PI3K/AKT pathway activity is directly correlated with increased glucose metabolism
  in cancer cells. Signaling is mediated through hexokinases, MTOR, and HIF1α (encoded
  by HIF1A) to increase oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and mitochondrial
  respiration.'
