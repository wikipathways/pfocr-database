caption: 'Three examples show how the new understanding of trans-AT modules can be
  employed to generate better biosynthetic models. A) The order and function of the
  basiliskamide polypeptides had been mysterious. Assembling them to generate module
  types defined here enabled the unambiguous ordering BasG, BasF, BasE, BasD, BasC.
  An unusual feature of the assembly line is the final C domain that apparently gatekeeps
  for an α/β-cis, γ/δ-trans diene, in contrast to KSs in its position that usually
  gatekeep for the α/β-trans, γ/δ-cis diene, but like the similarly-positioned macrolactin
  TE. B) The order and function of the first polypeptides (TaI, TaL, and Ta-1) of
  the myxovirescin pathway had also been cryptic. Assembling the polypeptides to form
  module types defined here, the order could be confidently determined. The first
  v module generates a propionyl group, possibly through the methylation and decarboxylation
  of a malonyl group. The second d module reduces the β-carbon and oxidizes the α-carbon.
  The third module is an uncategorized module type (z) that likely generates an α-hydroxy
  group through a DH-mediated dehydration to an α-keto group followed by KR-mediated
  α-ketoreduction similar to PksKR3 (Ref. ). C) The unusual order of the domains of
  9th-11th modules of the oxazolomycin pathway made deciphering that part of the pathway
  difficult. From their signatures, each of the domains in these modules reveal they
  are mixed with one another. Even so, the ACPs specifically collaborate with the
  domains of the module to which they belong. Other unusual features are present in
  the thirteenth module: a DH+ER+KR tridomain that possesses cis-AT architecture,
  an ACP that clades with cis-AT ACPs, and a docking interaction mediated by catalytically
  inactive O-methyltransferase (OMT0) and ACP0 domains. Icons and arrowheads are explained
  in .'
