caption: 'Vitamin D receptor (VDR)‐mediated actions of vitamin D: genomic and non‐genomic
  (rapid response) cellular signalling. 1,25(OH)2D interacts with caveolae‐associated
  VDR to activate second messengers systems, including protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol
  phosphate kinase, phospholipase C, or opening of the voltage‐gated chloride channels
  or calcium channels, to generate non‐genomic responses. In the genomic pathway,
  1,25(OH)2D associates with the retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and the trimeric complex
  (1,25(OH)2D‐VDR‐RXR) binds to the DNA in special sites called ‘vitamin D responsive
  elements’ (VDRE) to stimulate or inhibit the transcription of various genes. 1,25(OH)2D
  can locally be produced in an auto‐paracrine or paracrine way.'
