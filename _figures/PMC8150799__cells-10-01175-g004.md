caption: FcγR-TLR cross-talk of CRP-opsonized bacteria versus IgG-opsonized bacteria.
  FcγR-TLR cross-talk upon CRP opsonization of bacteria only amplifies cytokine production
  by M1 but not M2 macrophages, while IgG-opsonization of bacteria induces strong
  amplification by different myeloid cell types. In addition, CRP amplifies cytokine
  production by signaling though an AKT2 dependent pathway that induces metabolic
  reprogramming that only increases gene translation. In contrast, IgG signals through
  an IRF5 dependent pathway that amplifies cytokine production at three levels, i.e.,
  gene transcription, gene translation, and caspase-1 activation (amplifying IL-1β
  production). Abbreviations; CRP, C-reactive Protein; M1, “pro-inflammatory” macrophages;
  M2, “anti-inflammatory” macrophages; DCs, dendritic cells; LCs, Langerhans cells.
