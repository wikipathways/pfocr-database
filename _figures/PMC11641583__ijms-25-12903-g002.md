caption: Mechanisms of YAP activation in KCs. The canonical Hippo signalling pathway
  via the kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2 inactivate YAP/TAZ via serine phosphorylation
  to enhance retention in the cytoplasm and/or proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylated
  YAP is sequestered in the cytoplasm by a membrane protein complex that includes
  AJs, desmosome proteins, integrins, and their cytoplasmic adaptors. In the complex,
  α-catenin controls YAP/TAZ activity and phosphorylation by modulating their interaction
  with 14-3-3 proteins and PP2AC. DSG3 and its adaptor protein plakophilin 1 (PKP1)
  are also involved in the membrane complex sequestration of YAP. Plakophilin 4 (PKP4)
  may function as a recruiter of YAP to the junctional zone or as a mediator of the
  disruptor of the YAP/TAZ/SAV1/LATS1 complex. ANXA2 was identified as a Hippo pathway
  modulator that controls YAP phosphorylation. Keratin filaments (KRT4/15) also control
  YAP activation through 14-3-3σ binding. Stabilisation of F-actin with functioning
  myosin II and ARP2/3 is required for stiffness-induced nuclear localisation of YAP/TAZ.
  Integrin/Src signalling contributes to the nuclear localisation of YAP, as Src can
  directly phosphorylate YAP at the three binding sites, activating it. Src activation
  mediated by integrin α6β4 negatively regulates α-catenin, whereas integrinα3β1/Src
  signalling is inhibited by their interaction with THY1. Additionally, YAP/TAZ activity
  is regulated at the nuclear level. Under mild mechanical stress in the nucleus,
  YAP/TAZ are sequestered in the pool of SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes containing
  ARID1A, which prevents YAP/TAZ from binding to TEADs
