caption: Energy metabolism in cells and metabolic inhibitors in use. During normal
  physiologic conditions, cells undergo glycolysis and produce pyruvate that is converted
  to acetyl-coA and enters the TCA cycle in the mitochondria. The TCA cycle produces
  substrates NADH AND FADH2 to the ETC. NADH supplies electrons to complex I while
  FADH2 to complex II. Transfer of electrons occurs from complex I through IV which
  allows the transfer of hydrogen protons into the inter mitochondrial membrane space.
  This process creates mitochondrial membrane potential allowing protons to enter
  mitochondria via complex V and generating ATP. Fatty acid β-oxidation also supplies
  acetyl-CoA to the TCA cycle. This figure illustrates the cellular energy metabolic
  pathway and the emerging treatments targeting metabolism in AML. (Shown inside the
  red boxes). Figure created with BioRender.com
