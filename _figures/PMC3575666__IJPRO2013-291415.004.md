caption: VPS4B downregulation increases the expression of mitochondrial fatty acid
  β-oxidation related proteins and down regulates the expression of glycolysis related
  proteins in SKBR3 cells. The energy metabolism pathway was adapted from the Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) []. Colors represent the ratios of relative
  protein abundance at 24 hr (shaded ellipses), protein synthesis rate (shaded upper
  rectangles), and protein degradation rate constant (shaded lower rectangles) in
  SKBR3_shVPS4B versus SKBR3 cells. Red color represents protein with increased expression
  and green color represents protein with decreased expression.
