caption: The inter-relationship of DEGs identified as part of a gene network related
  to organismal injury and skeletal and muscular disorders (Network 4 in ) is depicted
  visually. Genes exhibiting differential expression in skeletal muscle of cases versus
  controls are denoted in green (lower expression in cases) and pink/red (higher expression
  in cases). Regulatory molecules shared by genes within each network some of which
  are DEGs and some are not are identified as "hubs". Solid lines denote positive
  interaction and dashed lines inhibitory influences. Genes denoted by circles represent
  other proteins, triangles represent kinases, inverted triangles represent phosphatases,
  and diamonds represent enzymes.
