caption: A new role of calcineurin in cell proliferation. (a) CaN regulates the stability
  and transcription of Cyclin D1. Phosphorylation of Thr286 of cyclin D1 promotes
  polyubiquitination and the subsequent degradation of cyclin D1. CaN stabilizes cyclin
  D1 by dephosphorylating the Thr286 of cyclin D1. Furthermore, NFAT activated by
  CaN induces the transcription of cyclin D1. Thus, CaN contributes to cancer cell
  proliferation by regulating the stability and transcription of cyclin D1. (b) Calcineurin
  regulates the stability and activity of Erα. Phosphorylation of Ser294 of ERα promotes
  polyubiquitination by the E3 ligase E6AP and the subsequent degradation of ERα.
  By dephosphorylating the Ser294 of ERα, CaN releases E6AP from ERα and stabilizes
  ERα (left). Furthermore, CaN activates the Akt-mTOR pathway via the phosphorylation
  of Ser118 of ERα (right). Thus, CaN contributes to the proliferation of cancer cells
  by regulating the stability and activity of ERα.
