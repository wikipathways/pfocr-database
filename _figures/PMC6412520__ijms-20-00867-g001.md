caption: Simplified diagram of methionine metabolism (adapted from []). Methionine
  is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) by ATP-L-methionine S-adenosyltransferase.
  AdoMet, serves as methyl group donor for methylation of DNA, proteins, and other
  biomolecules, generating S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), which is hydrolyzed to
  homocysteine (Hcy) and adenosine. This hydrolysis is reversible, and AdoHcy synthesis
  is favored rather than its hydrolysis. Nevertheless, under normal conditions, Hcy
  will be rapidly removed ensuring the hydrolytic direction. The biochemical removal
  of Hcy is either through the transsulfuration pathway, whose rate-limiting step
  is catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), or by its remethylation to methionine.
  This remethylation can be folate-dependent (requiring the enzymatic activities of
  methionine synthase (MS) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)) or
  folate-independent (requiring the enzymatic activity of betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT)).
