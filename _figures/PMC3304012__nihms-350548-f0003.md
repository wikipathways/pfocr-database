caption: 'A: EGFR mitochondrial import can be constitutive and the extent can be enhanced
  by apoptosis inducers (staurosporine and anisomycin), EGF, c-Src, Iressa, cetuximab
  and rapamycin. Conversely, EGFR mitochondrial transport can be blocked by 3-methyadenine
  (inhibitor of autophagy and PI-3K) and etoposide. Mitochondrial EGFR retains its
  tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylates CoxII; however, the consequence of the
  phosphorylation is not yet defined. The mitochondrial EGFR-CoxII complex can include
  c-Src; however, the effects of this interaction are still unknown. Furthermore,
  mitochondrial accumulation of EGFR led to compromised apoptotic response and resistance
  to Iressa treatments, while the underlying mechanisms are still undetermined.B:
  EGFRvIII mitochondrial import is constitutive and can be further enhanced by apoptosis
  inducers (staurosporine and anisomycin) and by Iressa. Mitochondrial accumulation
  of EGFRvIII rendered tumor cells highly resistant to apoptotic death and to Iressa
  treatments, while the mechanisms are still not identified.'
