caption: Kinetoplastids obtain fatty acids using synthesis and import mechanisms.
  A, Kinetoplastid parasites replicate extracellularly in the bloodstream of the mammalian
  host, red blood cells are also shown (red). B, Additionally, the parasite harbors
  two mechanisms of fatty acid synthesis that are localized in two different organelles
  (redrawn in part after []). C, A FASII pathway localizes to the mitochondrion (light
  violet), where it is required for the synthesis of lipoic acid and palmitic acid.
  D, Kinetoplastid parasites also harbor an ER-localized fatty acid elongase system.
  Unlike all other organisms, kinetoplastid FAE is used for de novo synthesis of fatty
  acids. The kinetoplastid FAE uses butyrate and malonate as substrates to generate
  myristate/stearate and adrenate as products. Major products are highlighted in red.
