caption: A novel strategy to facilitate cellular Cl− extrusion by coincident NKCC1
  inhibition and KCC3 activation by inhibiting  kinases. Reversible serine-threonine
  phosphorylation reciprocally regulates NKCC1 and KCC3. Hypotonic low [Cl−]i conditions
  or a reduction in cell volume activates the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway to promote Cl−
  and water influx. This leads to the phosphorylation of NKCC1 and KCC3 and their
  activation and inhibition respectively. When [Cl−]i becomes too high or cell volume
  increases, WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway is inhibited. The cotransporters are dephosphorylated,
  KCC3 is activated and facilitates [Cl−]i and water efflux to restore ion and osmotic
  homeostasis. CCCs, cation-chloride cotransporters; NKCC1, K+-Cl− cotransporters;
  KCC3, K+-Cl− cotransporter 3; WNK, with-no-lysine kinase; SPAK, STE20/SPS1-related
  proline/alanine rich kinase; OSR1, oxidative stress response kinase; AQP4, aquaporin
  4; ZT-1a, specific SPAK inhibitor. Part of figure elements were adapted from Salihu
  et al. [].
