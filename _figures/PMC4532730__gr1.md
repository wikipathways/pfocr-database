caption: Intercellular apoptosis-inducing ROS signaling. (A) Transformed cells. The
  figure shows the membrane of a transformed cell with the intracellular space on
  the left side, the extracellular space on the right side. Transformed cells are
  defined as malignant cells that have the potential to form tumors but have not yet
  been confronted with the natural antitumor mechanisms of an organism. Transformed
  cells are characterized by expression of NOX1 that generates extracellular superoxide
  anions (#1). These dismutate and form H2O2 (2O2.–+2H+→H2O2+O2) (#2) which is used

  FeIV=O.++H2O; POD FeIV=O.++Cl–+H+→PODFeIII+HOCl) (#3). HOCl interacts with superoxide
  anions, leading to the generation of hydroxyl radicals (HOCl+O2.–→.OH+O2+Cl–) (#4)  that
  induce lipid peroxidation (#5) and subsequent apoptosis induction through the mitochondrial
  pathway of apoptosis. In the presence of an high excess of H2O2 compared to POD,
  a consumption reaction between H2O2 and HOCl (#6) blunts HOCl signaling. The level
  of arginine is controlled by arginase (#7). NO synthase (NOS) utilizes arginine
  as substrate for the synthesis of NO (#8) . A substantial part of NO may be converted
  into nitrate by NO dioxygenase (#9), which is connected to the activity of cytochrome
  P 450 oxidoreductase (POR). NO passes the cell membrane (#10) and reacts with superoxide
  anions, resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite (.NO+O2.–→ONOO–) (#11) . Protonation
  of peroxynitrite leads to the formation of peroxynitrous acid (ONOO–+H+→ONOOH→.NO2+.OH)
  (#12) . As malignant cells have efficient proton pumps that establish a high local
  concentration of protons on the outside of their cell membrane , the formation of
  ONOOH seems to be locally favored over the competing reaction between ONOO− and
  CO2 (ONOO− and CO2→ONOOCOO−→NO2+CO3−) . Peroxynitrous acid spontaneously decomposes
  into NO2 and hydroxyl radicals (#13), which induce lipid peroxidation and the mitochondrial
  pathway of apoptosis (# 14). (B) Tumor cells (defined as malignant cells derived
  from a bona fide tumor) are protected against intercellular apoptosis-inducing ROS
  signaling through expression of membrane-associated catalase. Tumor progression
  causes the selection of a phenotype that is characterized by the expression of membrane-associated
  catalase . Membrane-associated catalase protects the tumor cells against ROS signaling
  by the HOCl pathway (#1–#5) and the NO/peroxynitrite pathway (#6–#12) through decomposition
  of H2O2 (#13), oxidation of NO (#14) and decomposition of peroxynitrite (#15). Decomposition
  of H2O2 and peroxynitrite by catalase are two step reactions with compound I (CATFeIV=O.+)
  as intermediate. NO is oxidated to NO2− by compound I.

  description: Intercellular apoptosis-inducing ROS signaling. (A) Transformed cells.
    The figure shows the membrane of a transformed cell with the intracellular space
    on the left side, the extracellular space on the right side. Transformed cells
    are defined as malignant cells that have the potential to form tumors but have
    not yet been confronted with the natural antitumor mechanisms of an organism.
    Transformed cells are characterized by expression of NOX1 that generates extracellular
    superoxide anions (#1). These dismutate and form H2O2 (2O2.–+2H+→H2O2+O2) (#2)
    which is used by the peroxidase domain of DUOX (POD) as substrate for the generation
    of HOCl (H2O2+PODFeIII→POD FeIV=O.++H2O; POD FeIV=O.++Cl–+H+→PODFeIII+HOCl) (#3).
    HOCl interacts with superoxide anions, leading to the generation of hydroxyl radicals
    (HOCl+O2.–→.OH+O2+Cl–) (#4)  that induce lipid peroxidation (#5) and subsequent
    apoptosis induction through the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. In the presence
    of an high excess of H2O2 compared to POD, a consumption reaction between H2O2
    and HOCl (#6) blunts HOCl signaling. The level of arginine is controlled by arginase
    (#7). NO synthase (NOS) utilizes arginine as substrate for the synthesis of NO
    (#8) . A substantial part of NO may be converted into nitrate by NO dioxygenase
    (#9), which is connected to the activity of cytochrome P 450 oxidoreductase (POR).
    NO passes the cell membrane (#10) and reacts with superoxide anions, resulting
    in the formation of peroxynitrite (.NO+O2.–→ONOO–) (#11) . Protonation of peroxynitrite
    leads to the formation of peroxynitrous acid (ONOO–+H+→ONOOH→.NO2+.OH) (#12) .
    As malignant cells have efficient proton pumps that establish a high local concentration
    of protons on the outside of their cell membrane , the formation of ONOOH seems
    to be locally favored over the competing reaction between ONOO− and CO2 (ONOO−
    and CO2→ONOOCOO−→NO2+CO3−) . Peroxynitrous acid spontaneously decomposes into
    NO2 and hydroxyl radicals (#13), which induce lipid peroxidation and the mitochondrial
    pathway of apoptosis (# 14). (B) Tumor cells (defined as malignant cells derived
    from a bona fide tumor) are protected against intercellular apoptosis-inducing
    ROS signaling through expression of membrane-associated catalase. Tumor progression
    causes the selection of a phenotype that is characterized by the expression of
    membrane-associated catalase . Membrane-associated catalase protects the tumor
    cells against ROS signaling by the HOCl pathway (#1–#5) and the NO/peroxynitrite
    pathway (#6–#12) through decomposition of H2O2 (#13), oxidation of NO (#14) and
    decomposition of peroxynitrite (#15). Decomposition of H2O2 and peroxynitrite
    by catalase are two step reactions with compound I (CATFeIV=O.+) as intermediate.
    NO is oxidated to NO2− by compound I.
