caption: a Fut8-mediated core fucosylation pathway is required for PD-1 surface expression.
  Internalized PD-1 is ubiquitinated by FBXO38 for proteasomal degradation and can
  also be recycled to surface with the help of TOX in liver cancer microenvironment.
  b STT3-catalyzed N-glycosylation stabilizes PD-L1 surface expression. P-S195-induced
  abnormally glycosylation of PD-L1 causes ERAD. Internalized PD-L1 is either sorted
  to the lysosome by HIP1R for degradation or recycled to the cell surface with the
  help of CMTM6/4. PD-L1 is ubiquitinated by different E3 ligases (HRD1, Cullin3-SPOP,
  β-TrCP and STUB1) under different contexts, and deubiquitinated by CNS5. Palmitoylation
  of PD-L1 by DHHC3 suppresses its mono-ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation.
  c Mgat1 mediates CTLA-4 N-glycosylation and surface retention. Trafficking of CTLA-4
  to the cell surface relies on the TRIM/LAX/Rab8 complex and PLD/ARF1-dependent exocytosis.
  Rapid CTLA-4 internalization is mediated by AP-2 binding to the unphosphorylated
  YVKM motif. Internalized CTLA-4 is either degraded in the lysosome or recycled to
  cell surface by LRBA. CTLA-4 in TGN can also be delivered to the lysosome for degradation
  through AP-1 binding.
