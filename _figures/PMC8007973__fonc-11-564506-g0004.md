caption: Model of the Wnt pathway in normal tissue (A) and in our two pancreoblastoma
  cases (B). (A) In normal tissue— (left part) ln the absence of Wnt ligand, the β-catenin
  destruction complex maintains low cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin. In the destruction
  complex, β-catenin is phosphorylated at sites S33/S37 and T41/S45 by casein kinase
  1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), respectively. Phosphorylated β-catenin
  is recognized by the β-Transducin Repeat Containing E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase
  (β-TRCP), which catalyzes its polyubiquitylation. Polyubiquitylated β-catenin, in
  turn, is degraded by the proteasome. (right part) In the presence of Wnt ligand,
  the signalosome is assembled and the β-catenin degradation is disrupted, leading
  to cytoplasmic accumulation. Entry of β-catenin into the nucleus promotes the formation
  of the enhanceosome to drive the transcription of Wnt target genes [Illustration
  adapted from Anthony et al. ()]. (B) In our two pancreoblastoma cases. (left part)
  The CTNNB1 S37C mutation present in case 1 does not allow the β-catenin phosphorylation
  by CK1this site. (right part) The APC deletion in case 2 does not allow the building
  of β-catenin destruction complex. Both alterations, CTNNB1 S37C mutation and APC
  deletion, prevent the β-catenin interaction with E3 ubiquitine ligase and its degradation
  by the proteasome. The β-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm leads to its constitutive
  translocation into the nucleus promoting the formation of the enhanceosome where
  its binding with TCF results in the constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling
  pathway.
