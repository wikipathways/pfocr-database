caption: The harmful effects and mechanisms of alcohol. Chronic and excessive alcohol
  consumption alters gut microbiota, increases intestinal permeability (leaky gut)
  and causes brain damage. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN) from the
  gut lumen to the systemic circulation are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs)
  expressed by immune cells and induce structural plasticity changes such as ionized
  calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
  as well as an inflammatory response by the nuclear factor-ĸB (NF-ĸB) pathway. The
  inflammatory cytokines and mediators, such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-10, reactive
  oxygen species (ROS), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF)-α, C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
  may result in altered neuronal functions and angiogenesis.
