caption: Metabolic model for interaction of nodulin 26 and glutamine synthetase and
  its effect on nitrogen assimilation in nitrogen-fixing nodules. A, a model for efflux
  and assimilation of fixed nitrogen in symbiosomes is shown. Ammonia produced by
  the action of nitrogenase in the bacteroid moves into the symbiosome space by simple
  diffusion (). Efflux of fixed nitrogen from the symbiosome space can occur as either
  NH4+ or NH3. NH4+ is directionally transported to the cytosolic side of the SM by
  a nonselective cation channel (NSCC), which is voltage-activated and is inwardly
  rectified (). A diffusive pathway for NH3 efflux also exists with nod26 representing
  a facilitated pathway for this gas (). Binding of GS to the C-terminal domain increases
  the concentration of this assimilatory enzyme at the symbiosome surface and also
  serves as a potential site for rapid assimilation of ammonia traversing nodulin
  26. B, a potential mechanism for ammonia futile cycling through the SM. The SM is
  energized by an H+-ATPase, which generates a proton gradient by pumping H+ into
  the symbiosome space (). When the SM is hyperpolarized, the nonselective cation
  channel is activated, which directionally transports NH4+ into the cytosolic compartment
  (). Because the cytosol is more alkaline than the symbiosome space, NH4+ can release
  a H+ with NH3 potentially reentering the symbiosome space through nodulin 26. Maintenance
  of cytosolic NH4+ levels at low concentrations by rapid assimilation via GS would
  be one approach to prevent this potential metabolite cycling.
