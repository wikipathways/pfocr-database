caption: Degradation of tagged proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and
  the amino acid sequence of ubiquitin (Ub). (A) In this selective proteolytic pathway,
  Ub is first activated by E1, subsequently transferred to the E2 enzyme, and finally
  covalently attached to the target substrate. Proteins with polyubiquitin chains
  are recognised by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBS) that release Ub, and deubiquitinated
  proteins are further degraded into small peptides by the 26 proteasome. The 26S
  proteasome is composed of a 20S catalytic complex and two 19S regulatory complexes.
  (B) The seven lysine residues in the Ub molecule are coloured red, and their corresponding
  numbering in the amino acid sequence of Ub is indicated above the red letters. (For
  interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
  referred to the web version of this article.)
