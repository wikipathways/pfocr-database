caption: Bile acid signaling in murine hepatocytes. Cultured hepatocytes exposed to
  conjugated bile acids such as taurocholic acid active a signaling pathway that results
  in dramatic increases in expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. TCA – taurocholic
  acid, S1PR2 – sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor 2, GPBAR-1 – G-protein bile acid
  coupled receptor-1, BA – bile acid, NTCP – sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide,
  pMAPK – phosphorylated mitogen activated protein kinase, pp38 – phosphorylated protein-38,
  pERK – phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase, Egr1 – early growth
  response factor 1, MIP-2 – macrophage inflammatory protein 2, mKC – mouse keratinocyte
  factor, ICAM-1 – intercellular adhesion molecule-1, OATP – organic anion transporting
  polypeptide, TGR5/GPBAR-1 – G-protein coupled bile acid receptor
