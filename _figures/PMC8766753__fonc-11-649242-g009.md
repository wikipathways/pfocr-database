caption: The graphical abstract of the circWHSC1-miR-195-5p-FASN/AMPK/mTOR axis on
  BC development. circWHSC1 is up-regulated in BC. CircWHSC1 targets miR-195-5p, which
  inhibits FASN expression. FASN induces inhibitive effects on the AMPK pathway, thus
  enhancing proliferation, growth, migration, invasion, EMT and relieving apoptosis.
