caption: The formation of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes by direct reaction
  of common nitrogen-containing heterocycles with transition metal reagents, first
  discovered by Taube and co-workers with ruthenium imidazole complexes, has become
  an important reaction in organometallic chemistry. This process is significant due
  to the ubiquity of NHCs as spectator ligands in homogeneous catalysis, the possible
  existence of NHC ligands in the chemistry of some metalloenzymes,, the ability to
  stabilize uncommon and otherwise unfavorable organic structures via transition metal
  coordination, and the promise of developing atom-economical catalytic reactions
  that take advantage of the modified reactivity of the heterocycle NHC tautomer.,
  Accordingly, tautomerization reactions involving interconversion of NHC complexes
  with either N-coordinated or free heterocycles have received intense scrutiny in
  the last several years. Computational studies by Crabtree and Eisenstein have contributed
  substantially to elucidating the factors that control the thermodynamics of metal-induced
  imidazole tautomerization. In addition, more recent work by Ruiz and coworkers has
  shown that basic additives are capable of generating kinetically stable NHC complexes
  from N-bound imidazoles even when the characteristics of the metal fragment are
  predicted to favor N-coordination. Mechanistic work in our laboratories on the Rh(I)-induced
  tautomerization of N-bound complex 2 of N-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline 1 to its
  corresponding C2-metallated carbene tautomer 3 () revealed a major NHC-forming pathway
  involving direct participation of only the N1 nitrogen atom, leading us to conjecture
  that unsaturated heterocycles containing only a single nitrogen atom might engage
  in similar reactivity.
