caption: Sortase A-dependent surface display of proteins. (A) Model for preprotein
  secretion and sorting in S. aureus. Surface proteins are first synthesized in the
  bacterial cytoplasm as full-length precursors (P1) containing an N-terminal signal
  sequence and a C-terminal sorting signal. The signal sequence directs the cellular
  export of the polypeptide through the Sec system and, upon translocation, is cleaved
  by signal peptidase. The product of this reaction, P2 precursor harboring only the
  C-terminal sorting signal, is retained within the secretory pathway via its C-terminal
  hydrophobic domain (black box) and positively charged tail (+). Sortase, a membrane
  anchored transpeptidase with active site cysteine, cleaves the peptide bond between
  the threonine (T) and the glycine (G) of the LPXTG motif, generating an acyl intermediate
  (AI). Lipid II, the peptidoglycan biosynthesis precursor, and its pentaglycine crossbridge
  (Gly5) amino group attacks the acyl intermediate, linking the C-terminal threonine
  of surface protein to lipid II (P3 precursor) and regenerating the active site of
  sortase. P3 precursor functions as a substrate for penicillin binding proteins and
  is incorporated into the cell wall envelope to generate mature anchored surface
  protein (M) that is also displayed on the bacterial surface. Note that the pentaglycine
  cell wall crossbridge is not commonly found in other bacteria nonetheless this pathway
  is conserved in many Gram-positive bacteria where the functional elements of cell
  wall crossbridges, LPXTG motif, sortase and penicillin binding proteins are conserved
  (adapted from []). (B) Schematic representation of protein precursors identified
  by using metabolic labeling of staphylococcal cultures with radiolabeled methionine.
  Immunoprecipitation of labeled polypeptides identifies the precursor P2 and P1.
  The short-lived AI and P3 intermediates are not identified. Treatment of the staphylococcal
  peptidoglycan with lysostaphin (glycyl-glycine endopeptidase) releases the final
  product, i.e. M, the surface protein anchored to the cell wall.
