caption: A schematic representation of P. falciparum metabolic adaptation to hyperoxia
  exposure. Metabolic pathways based on the Ginsburg Pathway [] for glycolysis (cytoplasmic),
  respiratory chain (mitochondria, blue and yellow) and haemoglobin digestion (digestive
  vacuolar, orange) are shown. The gene IDs (PlasmoDB) are reported for each enzymatic
  reaction. Human protein names are underlined. Up- and down-regulated genes and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) production are indicated in red and blue characters, respectively.
