caption: '(A) Simple model illustrating the biased signaling output through AtRGS1
  leading from flg22 and glucose or metabolite input, and a chart summarizing the
  origins of endocytosis (CME and SDE), recognition motif and phosphorylation requirements,
  and individual proteins necessary for glucose- and flg22-induced endocytosis of
  AtRGS1 where green “yes” indicates a requirement for signaling, red “no” indicates
  not required, and blue “yes” indicates a requirement with some restrictions. (B)
  Membrane overview illustrating proposed AtRGS1 microdomain clusters with common
  RLK neighbors. flg22 (orange circle) binds to FLS2 to initiate signaling through
  AtRGS1. The mechanism of glucose (blue circle) perception is unknown as indicated
  by the question marks. After ligand perception, SDE or CME of AtRGS1 occurs to permit
  downstream signaling. (C) A diagram of the individual components involved in the
  mechanism of endocytosis initiated by flg22 and glucose or metabolite and the presumed
  sequence of events. For flg22: (step 1) perception of ligand, (step 2) phosphorylation
  of AtRGS1 by a RLK, (steps 3 and 4) binding of clathrin complex and/or VPS26 in
  an unknown order, and (step 5) internalization of AtRGS1. For glucose or metabolite:
  (Step 1) ligand perception by a RLK or direct interaction with AtRGS1, (step 2)
  receptor interaction with WNK (for SDE, step 2 indicates immediate endocytosis because
  other key components of the pathway are unknown), (step 3) phosphorylation of AtRGS1
  by WNK, (step 4) binding of clathrin complex to AtRGS1, and (step 5) internalization
  of AtRGS1. TyrA23 inhibits CME in both pathways, and MβCD inhibits AtRGS1 microdomain
  formation at the membrane.'
