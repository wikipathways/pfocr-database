  (a) duplication of DNA during interphase (synthesis phase); (b) meiosis-specific
  bouquet formation, promoted by BQT1 and BQT2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (; );
  (c) the assembly of synaptonemal complex (; ) involves many meiosis-specific structural
  proteins, some of them high conserved, PHC2 and HOP1 (; ) and ZMM complex protein

  composed by SMC1, SMC3, RAD21 or its meiotic paralog REC8 (; ; ; ), which keep together
  sister chromatids until anaphase II when they are finally cleaved by separases ();

  machinery SPO11 is removed and DNA strands are processed (resection) by MRN complex
