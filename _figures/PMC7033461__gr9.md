caption: Molecular Mechanism Underlying the Regulatory Role of miR-101a in Alleviating
  Chronic Renal Fibrosis through Histone Demethylase KDM3A via Blockade of the YAP-TGF-β-Smad
  Signaling PathwayIn AA-incubated HK2 cells and the UUO-induced chronic renal fibrosis
  mouse model, decreased expression of miR-101a and increased expression of KDM3A
  were detected. KDM3A may promote the expression of YAP1 and TGF-β2 through H3K9me2.
  In addition, KDM3A could regulate the binding of H3K27ac and TEAD1 to TGF-β2 and
  consequently promote the expression of TGF-β2. In addition, KDM3A could inhibit
  TGIF1 expression and its downstream signaling pathway. Therefore, results from the
  present study suggested that KDM3A could potentially promote renal fibrosis through
  the YAP-TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway.
