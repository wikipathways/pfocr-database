caption: 'a Schematic illustrations of phenotypes associated with non-canonical Wnt
  signaling during mouse development: solid red crosses denote defective formation
  with expression of complete penetrance (100%). Open red crosses denote defective
  formation but the penetrance is lower or the phenotype is milder. Solid arrows indicate
  enhancement of the penetrance or severity of defective phenotypes observed by removal
  of one copy of the Usp39 gene. The open arrow indicates restoration of the severity
  of the defect in Usp39−/− embryos by removal of one copy of the Ube1 gene. b A schematic
  model representing how the GRHL3/USP39 interaction can stabilize the PRICKLE1 protein
  as a target of PCP-related molecules via deubiquitination. ND not determined, PCP
  planar cell polarity.'
papertitle: USP39 is essential for mammalian epithelial morphogenesis through upregulation
