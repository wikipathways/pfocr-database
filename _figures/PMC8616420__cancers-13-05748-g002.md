caption: 'E6 and E7 increase radiosensitivity of HPV-positive cervical cancer cells.
  An increased sensitivity to radiation by HPV-positive malignancies has been linked
  to several signaling pathways, including regulation of cell cycle progression, apoptosis
  and chromosomal instability. Shown is a simplified illustration of DNA damage repair
  signaling pathways impaired by altered TP53 and p16 activity. After the downregulation
  of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) by viral oncoprotein E7, increasing p16 levels hamper
  homologous recombination (HR) regulated via cyclin D1 and subsequently the RAD51/BRCA2
  axis. Rb loss further diminishes the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway.
  Cell cycle progression and G1-S transition are promoted by the release of the transcription
  factor E2F and the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and
  p27, while in contrast frequently triggered G2/M arrest reorders and arrests cancer
  cells at vulnerable stages of the cell cycle. Abbreviations: ATM: ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated; CHK2: checkpoint kinase 2; HPV: human papilloma virus. Adapted from “P53
