caption: Proposed dual role of LRP in Aβ metabolism. Association of Aβ with LRP ligands
  (apoE, α2M*, or lactoferrin) results in rapid LRP-mediated endocytosis of the complex.
  On the other hand, association of APP isoforms containing KPI domains (APPKPI) leads
  to increased Aβ generation and deposition. In AD, the catabolic pathway may be impaired
  by decreased levels of LRP at clearance sites (perhaps neurons or sites along the
  capillary membranes), while Aβ generation may be enhanced by upregulation of LRP
  in activated glia found in the AD brain.
