caption: Pathways of nucleo-mitochondrial communication. Nucleus-to-mitochondrion
  signals make up anterograde signaling. Signals from the mitochondria constitute
  the retrograde signaling. The integrated stress response is a general cellular stress
  pathway which can be triggered in ER, mitochondria or cytosol. Lastly, mito-nuclear
  crosstalk is the ability to orchestrate bidirectional feedback responses, they usually
  originate in mitochondria and result in nuclear responses.
