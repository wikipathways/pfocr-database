caption: Regulation of the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBX) on the toll-like receptor
  (TLR), retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR), and NOD-like
  receptor (NLR) signaling-associated molecules. During the modulation of TLR signaling
  mediated by HBX, the viral protein can promote the expression of TLR4 and myeloid
  differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and enhance the levels of the major
  vault protein (MVP) and DExH-box RNA helicase 9 (DHX9), which may further interact
  with MyD88 to regulate the innate immune response. HBX can activate the tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-2/transforming growth factor-activated
  kinase-1 (TAK1) signaling pathway. HBX is also able to interact with TAB1, and the
  interaction may affect the function of TAK1. The viral protein is capable of interacting
  with the evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathway (ECSIT),
  which is a partner of TRAF6. The viral protein also contributes to the interaction
  of vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34) with Beclin 1 (BECN1) and TRAF6. HBX interacts
  with toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β
  (TRIF), a downstream molecule of TLR3. HBX can bind to RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated
  5 (MDA5), and mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) to inhibit RLR signaling.
  Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) and speckled at 110 kDa (Sp110) may
  participate in the inhibition of RIG-I and MDA5 mediated by HBX. Parkin is involved
  in the degradation of MAVS induced by HBX. Besides these, HBX also interacts with
  TRAF3 and TBK1 to inhibit their activities. HBX can bind to IRF3 and inhibit the
  ubiquitination of IRF3 and IRF7 at the lysine 63 sites to suppress their activation.
  During the modulation of NLR signaling, HBX can activate the NLR family pyrin domain-containing
  3 (NLRP-3) inflammasome. RIP1 may be involved in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  mediated by HBX. Moreover, HBX can interact with the NLR with CARD domain-containing
  4 (NLRC4) and through this interaction, HBX may influence the NLRC4 inflammasome.
  The viral protein can also inhibit the expression of absent-in-melanoma-2 (AIM2)
  and may further affect the AIM2 inflammasome.
