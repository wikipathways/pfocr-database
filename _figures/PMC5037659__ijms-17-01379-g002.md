caption: 'A brief comparison of NAFLD/NASH prevention and therapy between astaxanthin
  and vitamin E. First, astaxanthin is more effective than vitamin E in improving
  steatosis by suppressing lipid accumulation. Second, astaxanthin is superior to
  vitamin E with respect to suppressing the MAPK pathway and NF-κB activation and
  induces a strong shift of M2 macrophage polarization, which ultimately reverses
  hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Most importantly, as a
  result of M1/M2 transformation, astaxanthin can reduce hepatic stellate cell (HSC)
  activation and ameliorate hepatic fibrosis. Black arrow: : induction, : inhibition,
  : no change; Red arrow: : inhibition compared with vitamin E, : more significant
  induction/inhibition effect compared with vitamin E.'
