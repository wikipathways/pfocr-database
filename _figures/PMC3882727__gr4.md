caption: Pathways of Phosphatidylcholine BiosynthesisEnzymes are indicated by numbers
  as defined below. Choline (Cho) is transported from the extracellular fluid across
  the plasma membrane by Na+-dependent, ATP-requiring choline transporter-like proteins
  (1). Free intracellular choline is phosphorylated by choline kinase (2) to produce
  phosphocholine (P-Cho). The latter is converted to cytidine-diphosphate choline
  (CDP-Cho) in a reaction catalyzed by phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCTα,
  3). CDP-choline is esterified with diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho)
  in reactions catalyzed either by cholinephosphotransferase (4) or choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase
  (5). PtdCho is converted to lyso-phosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PtdCho) by phospholipase
  A (6) which, in turn, is converted back to PtdCho, in a reaction catalyzed by acylglycerophosphate
  acyltransferase (7). In mammals, a second pathway of PtdCho synthesis is limited
  to liver, where PtdCho is synthesized from phosphatidylethanolamine (Ptd-Eth) in
  a series of methylation reactions catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
  (8) with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor. The red rectangle indicates
  the position of the block in PtdCho synthesis caused by deficiency of CCT.
