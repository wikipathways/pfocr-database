caption: Model illustrating a proposed mechanism by which p38 MAPK signaling influences
  the response of cells to mechanical stress. Stretch activation of p38 results in
  phosphorylation and recruitment of HspB1 to the actin cytoskeleton, especially actin
  comet tails. Elimination of HspB1 function abrogates SF reinforcement and promotes
  cell migration. The HspB1 pathway provides a previously uncharacterized mechanism
  for mechanotransduction that is independent of the role of zyxin in stretch-induced
  actin remodeling.
