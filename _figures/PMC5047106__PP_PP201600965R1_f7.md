caption: Model of the coordinated regulation of sphingolipid synthesis by AtORM1 and
  AtORM2 and ceramide synthase activity. The model represents the core synthesis pathway
  of ceramides in Arabidopsis. SPT catalyzes a condensation reaction between Ser and
  palmitoyl-CoA, leading to the production of 3-ketosphinganine, which is reduced
  to dihydroxy LCB (d18:0) through 3-ketosphinganine reductase activity. Dihydroxy
  LCBs can be used by class I ceramide synthase (LOH2) along with 16:0-CoA to produce
  C16 ceramides. Alternatively, dihydroxy LCBs can be hydroxylated by LCB C-4 hydroxylase
  to form trihydroxy LCBs (t18:0) that are used by class II ceramide synthases (LOH1
  and LOH3) along with very long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, primarily 24:0- and 26:0-CoA,
  to produce ceramides containing s. In the model shown, modulation of AtORM expression
  leads to alterations in ceramide synthase activity. AtORM  suppression, indicated
  by GO, results in increased SPT activity and increased generation of LCBs, with
  a concomitant increase in class I activity and a decrease in class II activity.
  Conversely, overexpression (OE) of AtORM1 and AtORM2, indicated by STOP, results
  in decreased SPT activity and reduced LCB generation, with a concomitant decrease
  in class I activity and an increase in class II activity to ensure the production
  of sufficient levels of ceramides with s to support growth. A role of LCB C-4 hydroxylase
  activity in mediating relative flux through class I and II ceramide synthases, particularly
  in response to enhanced LCB synthesis, also is possible.
