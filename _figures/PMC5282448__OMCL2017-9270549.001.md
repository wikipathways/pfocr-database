caption: Insulin signalling pathway. Upon insulin stimulation, activation of insulin
  receptor and thus formation of many phosphotyrosine residues do occur. Binding of
  IRS proteins and their phosphorylation precedes recruitment of PI3K as well as subsequent
  PIP2 phosphorylation. Note that PIP3 can be converted to PIP2 through PTEN activity.
  PDK1 gets activated upon binding to PIP3, followed by the phosphorylation of PKC
  ζ/λ and AKT, which stimulate GLUT4 translocation towards cell membrane and therefore
  glucose influx. Phosphorylated AKT mediates the repression of glycogenolysis, lipolysis,
  proteolysis, and gluconeogenesis as well as the activation of lipogenesis, glycogenesis,
  protein synthesis, and cell survival. The stimulation of insulin receptor is also
  accompanied by binding of adaptor proteins, known as Shc. The subsequent binding
  of Grb2 and Sos proteins initiates the MAPK cascade pathway. The activation of AKT
  and MAPK cascade results in the promotion of cell growth.
