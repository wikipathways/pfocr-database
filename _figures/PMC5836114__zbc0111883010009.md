caption: Model of ARRDC3 and PAR1 trafficking. Thrombin binds to and cleaves the PAR1
  N terminus at arginine 41, exposing a new N-terminal domain that acts like a tethered
  ligand. Due to the irreversible proteolytic mechanism of PAR1 activation, internalization
  and lysosomal sorting is critical for termination of G protein signaling. Unlike
  most classic GPCRs, activated PAR1 is rapidly sorted from endosomes to lysosomes
  through a non-canonical pathway mediated by ARRDC3 and ALIX. In invasive breast
  cancer, activated PAR1 is internalized and recycled and fails to sort to lysosomes
  for degradation and consequently signals persistently, which promotes tumor cell
  invasion and growth. We discovered that loss of ARRDC3 of expression in invasive
  breast cancer is responsible for defective PAR1 trafficking that results in persistent
  signaling and cellular invasion.
