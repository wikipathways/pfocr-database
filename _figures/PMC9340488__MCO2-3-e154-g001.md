caption: 'The NF‐κB pathway and its crosstalk cellular signaling pathway in COVID‐19.
  Activation of the classical pathway involves mainly stimulation of TNF‐α, IL‐1,
  and Toll‐like receptor ligands, induces IκBα phosphorylation (catalyzed by IκB kinase
  [IKK]: IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO complex), and in turn translocates heterodimers of p65
  and p50 into the nucleus. The nonclassical pathway is stimulated mainly by specific
  TNF family cytokines, and IKKα‐derived p100 phosphorylation (occurs in a RelB‐dependent
  manner) generates the transcriptionally active p52‐RelB complex, which activates
  the pathway. The overactivated NF‐κB pathway produces large amounts of proinflammatory
  cytokines (IL‐1, IL‐2, IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐12, TNF‐α, and GM‐CSF) and chemokines (CCL2,
  CXCL10, and CXCL9). This is an important pathogenic mechanism leading to COVID‐19
  inflammation and cytokine storm. In addition, JAK/STAT pathway, Ang II accumulation,
  p38 MAPK pathway, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and STING also crosstalk with NF‐κB
  pathway. The figure is drawn by BioRender software.'
