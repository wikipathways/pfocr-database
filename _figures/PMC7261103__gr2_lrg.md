caption: Role of renin/angiotensin system (RAS) and kallikrein/kinin system (KKS)
  in pathogenesis of COVID-19. (1) SARS-CoV2 (through spike proteins) binds to ACE2,
  mechanism by which it enters the target cell. This action promotes a downlregulation
  of ACE2 by sequestration and internalization, as well as by cleavage of its extracellular
  domain. ACE2′s downregulation causes RAS imbalance, angiotensin II (AngII) accumulation,
  plus Angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang1-7) decrease, which shifts AngII binding toward the
  AT1, leading to pro-inflammatory and cardiovascular injury mechanisms. (2) ACE2
  downregulation causes imbalance of the KKS, des-Arg9BK (DABK) accumulation and BKB1R
  activation leading to pro-inflammatory repercussions. SARS-CoV2 invasion on the
  target cell also depends on a TMPRSS2 membrane protease, necessary for the cleavage
  of its spike protein. Active TMPRSS2 additionally cleaves the kininogen, activating
  the production of bradykinin (BK). The virus itself also expresses a cysteine protease
  which could activate the kinin pathway by interacting with kininogen. BK via BKB2R
  also contributes to the pro-inflammatory pathway by activating nitric oxide (NO)
  and prostaglandins (PGs) synthesis. (3) BKB1R is strongly upregulated by inflammatory
  mediators (mainly cytokines), rising endothelial permeability and leukocyte migration.
  A positive feedback loop between BKB1R and cytokines generates cytokines storm,
  that in turn, lead the body to a sepsis-like scenario. (4) Kallikrein (from KKS),
  additionally, causes imbalance of coagulation system by activating factor 12 (FXII)
  and plasmin. The two mechanisms contribute to the formation of intravascular microthrombi,
  observed mainly in the lung tissue. The presence of plasmin increases cleavage of
  spikes proteins which boosts SARS-CoV2 virulence.
