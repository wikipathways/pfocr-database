caption: Mechanism model of EMT-regulated by RBM3 in HCC. RBM3 promotes the EMT process
  by activating STAT3 signaling pathway in two ways. One is that RBM3 upregulates
  STAT3 expression by binding to STAT3 mRNA, and the other is that RBM3 increases
  the phosphorylation of STAT3. Moreover, RBM3 accelerates the migration and invasion
  of HCC cells, and upregulates MMP9, MMP2 and VEGF expression. Furthermore, as an
  upstream target of RBM3, microRNA-383 inhibits RBM3 expression by binding to the
  3ʹUTR of RBM3 mRNA.
