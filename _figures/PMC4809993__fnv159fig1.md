caption: Two models for induction of a bimodal distribution in the expression of both
  comE and comX in a population of S. mutans by exogenous CSP. (A) An unidentified
  positive feedback mechanism is posited to activate comDE bimodally, leading to bimodal
  activation of downstream bacteriocin genes such as cipB that stimulate the ComRS
  system and comX. (B) Positive feedback in the ComRS system allows it to become activated
  bimodally when stimulated by upstream bacteriocin genes, leading to bimodal expression
  of comX. ComX regulation of comE expression then leads to bimodal activation of
  comE.
