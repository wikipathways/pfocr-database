caption: ROS is a critical element of the ROS/TNF-α feedback loop. The production
  of TNF-α depends on the activation of ROS-stimulated NF-κB signaling, which activates
  the p38/JNK signaling pathway to accelerate the progression of RA inflammation.
  High levels of iron ions can catalyze the production of ROS. Excessive ROS will
  aggravate the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts; induce osteoclast differentiation
  and inhibit osteoblast proliferation; activate metalloproteinases, as well as lead
  to cartilage destruction and bone erosion. Excessive ROS will also promote lipid
  peroxidation, leading to cell ferroptosis. Moreover, the ferroptosis inducer (erastin)
  can promote the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 13 and promote cartilage
  destruction, while the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 can reduce cartilage
  degradation.
