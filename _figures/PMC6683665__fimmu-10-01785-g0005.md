caption: Interplay between shrimp NF-κB pathways and WSSV. The activation of the NF-κB
  pathway can be hijacked by WSSV to favor its gene expression and genome replication.
  WSSV infection activates the host Toll pathway, which leads to the activation of
  Dorsal that translocates into the nucleus to induce viral-gene expression and promote
  viral-genome replication. A similar situation is observed for the IMD pathway. The
  activation of wsv069 mediated by the NF-κB pathways can in turn induce its own expression,
  which creates a self-regulatory loop. Such a positive-feedback loop amplifies the
  signaling extent to further activate other viral genes. Until now, after WSSV infection,
  the NF-κB pathways have been shown to be subject to numerous regulatory controls
  by both host factors—such as p53, miR1959, and HMGB—and viral factor, such as WSSV449,
  WSSV-miR-N13, and WSSV-miR-N23. However, the activation of the shrimp canonical
  NF-κB pathway can also lead to AMP expression, such as ALFs, which have strong antiviral
  activity against WSSV. Therefore, WSSV could have evolved some currently unknown
  strategies to attenuate the antiviral role of the host NF-κB pathway to instead
  engage its activation to favor viral pathogenesis.
