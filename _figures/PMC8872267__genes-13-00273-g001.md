caption: Regulation of glucose metabolism by miRNAs in quiescent versus proliferative
  cells. The figure depicts the main alternative energy metabolism pathways in human
  cells, with their relative usage in normal quiescent cells (A) and cancer and highly
  proliferative cells (B) represented by different levels of transparency. Known regulatory
  miRNAs, their direct mRNA targets (HK, LDHA and HIF1α), and certain indirect miRNA
  regulatory interactions with other miRNAs or pathway reactions are represented,
  with letter size distinguishing their abundance. Pointing arrowheads represent stimulatory
  interactions, while blocking arrows represent inhibitory interactions. Pathway and
  metabolite labels highlighted in bold and thickened lines denote their predominance
  in each setting.
