caption: 'Cooperative interactions between the tumour and surrounding cells in tumorigenesis.
  Interactions between cells are shown that result in either the death of the mutant
  cell or cell survival, proliferation, and neoplastic transformation. Mutant cells
  are in pink, wild-type cells are in blue, hemocytes are in grey, myoblasts (mesenchymal
  cells) are in green, a fat body adipocyte is in yellow, and the basement membrane
  (basal lamina) is in purple. (a) dEMAP secretion-hemocyte attraction: JNK signalling
  in a cell polarity-impaired loser cell transcriptionally upregulates MMP1, which
  acts to cleave secreted dTyrRS to form dEMAP and dminiTyr. dEMAP attracts hemocytes
  to the loser cell by upregulating PI3K signalling in the hemocytes, which is required
  for chemotaxis and possibly engulfment of the loser cell. (b) Tumour hot-spots:
  neoplastic tumour-suppressor mutants (nTSGs) induce tumours more preferably, in
  regions where there is a stiff basal lamina and there are developmentally high levels
  of the Upd (IL-6) ligand to elevate Jak-Stat signalling, which promotes cell survival
  and proliferation of the tumour cells. (c) ROS-hemocytes-JNK: in scrib mutant RasV12-expressing
  tumour cells, a feedback loop between the hemocytes and the mutant cells promotes
  tumorigenesis. In the mutant cells, Ras signalling and caspase activation leads
  to ROS production that is released from the cells and promotes hemocytes to produce
  Egr (TNF). Egr signals via the TNFR-JNK pathway in the mutant cell leading to the
  upregulation of caspase activity, and some apoptosis, which is required for tumour
  overgrowth and invasion. Due to the disruption of the peripodial epithelium in large
  scrib mutant RasV12-expressing tumours, hemocytes most likely interact with the
  tumour on both apical and basal sides. (d) Induction of autophagy in surrounding
  wild-type cells: scrib mutant RasV12-expressing tumour cells are metabolically stressed,
  which leads to ROS production. Egr-JNK signalling leads to the transcriptional upregulation
  of Upd, ligands for the Dome-Jak-Stat signalling pathway, which is elevated in the
  mutant cells. Jak-Stat signalling and ROS production are required for the induction
  of autophagy in the surrounding wild-type cells, and also at distant sites, such
  as the fat body, muscle, and gut (not shown), which facilitates tumour growth and
  neoplastic transformation, possibly through supplying amino acids, glucose, and
  other nutrients to the tumour cells. (e) Interactions with myoblasts: in EGFR-overexpressing
  psq-knockdown tumours cooperative interactions are observed between the tumour cells
  and the surrounding myoblasts (mesenchymal cells). EGFR induces Wg and Dpp expression,
  and psq knockdown leads to increased levels of the extracellular matrix protein,
  Perlecan (Pcn). Wg acts to promote proliferation of the tumour cells, whilst Dpp,
  facilitated by Pcn in the basal lamina, stimulates proliferation of the myoblast
  cells. In turn, the myoblast cells provide unidentified growth factors that drive
  proliferation and neoplastic transformation of the tumour cells. Myoblasts also
  supply Egr (not shown), which would be expected to activate the TNFR-JNK signalling
  pathway in the tumour cells. (f) Interactions with the fat body: polarity-impaired
  tumours through Egr-JNK signalling upregulate PVF1, a ligand for the PVR receptor
  on hemocytes, which promotes hemocyte proliferation. Hemocytes, in turn, supply
  Egr to the tumour cells, and the Toll Receptor ligand, Spätzle, to the fat body,
  which induces innate immune system signalling in the fat body. These interactions
  are required to induce apoptosis of tumour cells.'
