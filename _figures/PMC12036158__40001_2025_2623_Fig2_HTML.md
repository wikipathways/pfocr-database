caption: 'Regulatory pathways of ferroptosis. The figure illustrates the regulatory
  pathways involved in ferroptosis, which can be broadly categorized into three types.
  The first category encompasses the three essential components of ferroptosis: abnormal
  iron metabolism, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and reactive oxygen species. The second
  category includes the four major defense pathways against ferroptosis: the GPX4-GSH
  defense pathway, the FSP1-CoQ defense pathway, the DHODH-CoQ defense pathway, and
  the GCH1-BH4 defense pathway. The third category consists of key genes that regulate
  ferroptosis, namely NFR2, Tp53, HO-1, and NCOA4'
