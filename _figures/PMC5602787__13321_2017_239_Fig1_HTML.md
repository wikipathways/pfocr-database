caption: a 1,4-Butanediol is an example of a non-natural compound that is produced
  using a heterologous pathway generated by an pathway-identification algorithm. These
  heterologous genes from organisms differing from the host are dashed. Intermediates
  of the citric acid cycle were used as starting compounds in a pathway search restricted
  by path length toward the desired target, 1,4-butanediol. b Graph-based networks
  can be described as either directed, bipartite, or hypergraphs. In directed graphs,
  nodes (open circles) and edges (arrows) can represent either compounds or reactions.
  In the case of bipartite graphs, the pathway will be composed of nodes that alternate
  between compounds and reactions. For hypergraphs, groups of multiple compounds can
  be linked through a single hyperedge that may represent a reaction rule that links
  compounds that are associated with multiple additional reaction rules
