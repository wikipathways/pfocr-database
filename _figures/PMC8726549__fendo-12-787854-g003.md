caption: The mechanism of insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia caused by valproate
  (VPA). 1 VPA can compete with free fatty acids (FFAs) for binding to albumin to
  increase the availability of FFAs, which can induce insulin resistance (IR) through
  the insulin signaling pathway. 2 VPA elevates the level of androgen by inhibiting
  the B-oxidation of FFAs. 3 Obesity promotes the occurrence of IR. 4 High leptin
  levels are closely related to IR. 5 The reduction of adiponectin is significantly
  related to IR. 6 VPA hinders oxidative stress, which can influence IR through the
  p38 MAPK signaling pathway and reduce the expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4).
  7 VPA can attenuate K-ATP channel currents, which can then regulate the membrane
  potential of B cells, leading to increased insulin secretion. 8 VPA can directly
  act on pancreatic B cells to increase insulin secretion. 9 VPA could affect the
  metabolism of insulin in the liver, which can bring about an increase in insulin
  concentrations. 10 Refers to the level of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which
  has an impact on the level of IR by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
