caption: Interferon-mediated antiviral responses and diseases. In an antiviral innate
  immune system, nucleic acid sensors detect viral nucleic acids intracellularly and
  extracellularly, which then activate intracellular signaling pathways, leading to
  transcriptional activation of type I and type III interferon (IFN) genes upon the
  nuclear translocation of the transcription activators IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3/7
  and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Secreted type I and type III IFNs activate a secondary
  signaling pathway by binding to their cognate IFN receptor (IFNR) complexes in an
  autocrine and paracrine manner. The downstream JAK-STAT pathway activates the transcription
  complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which leads to the expression of hundreds
  of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), resulting in strong antiviral responses. Since IFN-induced
  antiviral activity is critical for eliminating infected viruses, its weak or delayed
  response leads to uncontrolled infectious disease. In contrast, IFNs also play essential
  roles in regulating the subsequently induced adaptive immunity, and thus, their
  excessive or chronic activation can lead to the development of autoimmune or autoinflammatory
  diseases as, well as the initiation of cytokine storm, which exacerbates inflammation
