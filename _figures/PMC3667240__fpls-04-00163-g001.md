caption: 'Glucose and auxin signal in cell cycle regulation (modified from , Figure
  ). The cell cycle is divided into four phases: DNA replication (S), mitosis (M),
  and two gap phases (G1 and G2, between M/S and S/M, respectively). Some plant cells
  may skip the M phase under certain developmental processes, resulting “endoreduplication.”
  Cell cycle starts in G1. During this phase, Glc and auxin signals could induce the
  expression of CycD, while auxin is also able to increase CDKA transcription. The
  CycD/CDKA complex is activated by phosphorylation but can still be blocked by CDK
  inhibitor KRPs. Auxin was reported to reduce the expression of some KRPs. The active
  CycD/CDKA complex provokes phosphorylation of the transcriptional repressor RBR,
  and release the transcription regulator E2FA/B and DPA complex. By post-transcriptional
  regulation, auxin stabilizes the E2FA/B and DPA complex, which promote the expression
  of genes essential for the beginning of the S phase. The expression of CycA3 could
  be up-regulated by Glc signal, which is required to drive the cells from G1 to S
  phase. Auxin was shown to increase the degradation of the F-box SKP2 later in S
  phase, which indirectly stabilizes E2FC/DPB complex, and represses the S phase genes
  expression. As cell cycle processes into G2 phase, Glc signal was found to initiate
  the G2/M transition by repressing TSS transcription, and activating the expression
  of key cell cycle genes, such as CycB and CycD. Auxin signal is required for the
  initiation and completion of mitosis, probably though an unknown pathway independent
  or in parallel to Glc. Auxin is also likely to emit a negative signal to prevent
  cell from going into endoreduplication hence sustaining cell divisions. Glc and
  Auxin in italic indicate regulation at transcription level and those in non-italic
  suggest regulation at protein level.'
