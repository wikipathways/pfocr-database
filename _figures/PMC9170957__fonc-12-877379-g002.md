caption: 'Mechanisms of resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. The process underlying
  ADT resistance and CRPC development involve, in 70% of the cases, upregulation of
  AR signaling pathway. In this case, upregulation of AR expression, amplification
  or activating mutations, AR splice variants, promiscuous AR activation by non-androgen
  ligands and deregulation of AR coactivators and co-repressors is observed. On the
  other hand, in 30% of the cases there is AR expression downregulation and activation
  of other signaling pathways involved in cell survival and growth activation. AR,
  androgen receptor; T, testosterone; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; GF, growth factors:
  TF, transcript factors. Created with BioRender.com.'
