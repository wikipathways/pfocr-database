caption: Diagram depicting the mechanism of CR involving multiple signaling pathways.
  J2 feeders are able to produce ECM components such as collagen, laminin, glycoproteins
  and interstitial procollagens to facilitate primary cell attachment. J2 feeders
  also secrete diffusible factors such as HGF and HBEGF which may result in activation
  of receptors of MET, EGFR, HER2 and VEGFR. As a result, the STAT, MAPK and PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathways may be further stimulated,. The activated HGF–MET signals also
  lead to increased phosphorylation of GAB2 and STAT6, but the subsequent function
  is not clear. The inhibition of P53 pathway is found critical for CR cells to invade
  apoptosis. Moreover, Y27632 as a ROCK inhibitor is associated with the suppression
  of TGF-β/SMAD pathway as well as proteins of P27, PTEN, MLC and MYPT. CR condition
  is also capable of triggering the non-classical pathway of β-catenin via increasing
  PP2Ac activity. In addition, most CR cells have increased expression of stem cell
  markers such as CD44 and P63, enhanced hTERT activity, and inactivated pRB/P16.
  The consequence of CR on primary cells is the promotion of proliferation, acceleration
  of cell cycle progression, suppression of apoptosis and differentiation and maintenance
  of stem cell properties.
