caption: The impact of helminths on NF-κB activity and outcomes. (A) B. malayi infection
  results in decreased NF-κB activity and induces M2 and eventually Mreg macrophages,
  while patients with lymphatic pathology show increased angiogenesis associated with
  NF-κB activation. H. polygyrus induces semi-maturation of DCs and induces Th2 and
  regulatory events through modulation of NF-κB activity. Products released by T.
  spiralis affect NF-κB activity in LPS-activated macrophages, significantly reducing
  proinflammatory cytokine production. (B) T. solium larval antigens activate the
  NF-κB pathway in monocytes inducing chemokine release. M. corti antigens inhibit
  LPS-induced inflammatory phenotypes in microglia cells via NF-κB modulation. (C)
  F. hepatica tegumental antigens temporarily prevent LPS-induced NF-κB in DC, suppressing
  maturation. S. mansoni induces NF-κB activation in human hepatic stellate cells
  which is associated with liver fibrosis; a similar situation occurs in S. Japonicum-infected
  mice.
