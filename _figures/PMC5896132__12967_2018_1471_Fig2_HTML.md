caption: Illustration of MAPK pathway and the role of cisplatin in promoting apoptosis
  or cell survival. Cisplatin-induced ERK activation phosphorylates p53 which in turn
  upregulates expression of p21, 45kd-growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD45), and mouse
  double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2) thereby promoting cell cycle arrest and supporting
  repair of DNA damage induced by cisplatin. ERK also activates its downstream mediator,
  RSK which promotes cell survival and metastasis. Cisplatin induced DNA damage activates
  JNK and p73 and promotes their complex formation and leads to apoptosis. Cisplatin
  induces stabilization of p18 (Hamlet), a protein regulated by p38 MAPK. This enhances
  the ability of p53 to interact with and activate pro-apoptotic genes, PUMA and NOXA
