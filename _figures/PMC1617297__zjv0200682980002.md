caption: Cell-signaling networks induced by Pichinde virus infection as analyzed using
  the Ingenuity pathway analysis knowledge base. Significant pathways were merged
  to produce networks representing induction following infection with the attenuated
  P2 variant (A) and the lethal P18 variant (B). Nodes in red are up-regulated following
  virus infection; nodes in green are down-regulated. Reprinted with permission from
