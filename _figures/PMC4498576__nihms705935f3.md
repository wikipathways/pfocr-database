caption: Pathogenesis-based therapy for inherited disorders of distal cholesterol
  metabolism. The consequence of mutations downstream of the lanosterol pathway will
  lead an accumulation of toxic metabolites as well as a reduction in cholesterol
  synthesis. Thus treatment with topical cholesterol or topical proximal enzyme inhibitor
  such as lovastatin alone will not be sufficient for phenotypic improvement. Thus,
  combining topical cholesterol and topical proximal enzyme inhibitor will not only
  prevent the accumulation of toxic metabolite but also provide the cholesterol to
  the epidermal lipid bilayer and improve the phenotype.
