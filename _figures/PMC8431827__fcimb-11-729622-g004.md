caption: Graphical demonstration of predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection, ACE2 blockage,
  oxidative stress, and RAAS imbalance. (A) Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 (1) followed
  by profuse replication, transcription and translation (2) of SARS-CoV-2 in the host
  cell leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due to accumulation of newly synthesized
  viral proteins in the ER (3). Protein overload in the ER leads to reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) generation in the ER (4). Further, ER stress also induces mitochondrial
  ROS production (5). Together, ER stress and ROS accumulation lead to inflammation
  and apoptosis. (B) Renin, angiotensin and aldosterone together constitute the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone
  System (RAAS) and its imbalances in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Angiotensinogen is produced
  in the liver and cleaved by renin to form angiotensin (I). Angiotensin I is converted
  to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This conversion occurs
  in the lungs, where ACE is expressed by vascular endothelial and lung epithelial
  cells. During homeostasis, Angiotensin I is acted upon by ACE2 to generate Angiotensin-(1-9),
  which is cleaved by ACE to generate Angiotensin-(1-7). Further, ACE2 also cleaves
  Angiotensin II into Angiotensin-(1-7). Angiotensin-(1-7) via Mas receptor mediates
  antioxidative and anti-inflammatory responses. Angiotensin II binds to one of two
  G-protein coupled receptors, the AT1 and AT2 receptors. SARS-CoV2 binding to its
  potent ACE2 receptor diminishes ACE2 function, skewing the ACE/ACE2 equilibrium
  to a predominant pro-inflammatory ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis signaling. Imbalances in
  the RAAS system can alter the AT2R -MasR pathway, which is very important for vasodilation,
  angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiapoptotic activities. In
  contrast, AT1R pathway is important for vasoconstriction, inflammation, oxidative
  stress, and apoptosis. Virus binding to ACE2 dysregulates AT2R-MasR pathway. Imbalances
  of ACE and ACE2 generate ROS, leading to oxidative stress, which causes hyperinflammation.
  In addition, hyperinflammation with cellular oxidative stress imbalances causes
  disease severity and when reaches its climax leads to respiratory failure as discussed
  in  and . Spices could potentially inhibit inflammation and restore homeostasis.
