caption: (A) In vascular smooth muscle cells, CD36 signaling was shown to downregulate
  the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2. Nrf2 is normally a cytosolic protein
  held in an inactive state by binding to an inhibitory partner known as KEAP or Inhibitor
  of Nrf2 (INrf2). Upon oxidative stress the two proteins dissociate and Nrf2 translocates
  to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sequences known as antioxidant response
  elements (ARE) to promote transcription of multiple antioxidant genes, including
  peroxiredoxin 2 (Prdx2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). CD36 signaling via the Src
  family kinase Fyn, leads to phosphorylation of nuclear Nrf2, nuclear export, and
  degradation, thereby preventing upregulation of antioxidants and thus promoting
  reactive oxygen species accumulation and pro-atherogenic cellular activity. (B)
  In microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
  2 (VEGFR2) recognizes its ligand VEGF and becomes phosphorylated. VEGFR2 than transduces
  signals to mediate cellular migration, proliferation, and tube formation important
  for angiogenesis. However, CD36 through recognition of thrombospondin-1 and related
  proteins promotes activation of Fyn, p38 MAP kinase, and apoptosis initiating caspases,
  which overall limits endothelial cell migration and tube formation. CD36 also forms
  functional complexes with VEGFR2, promoting a spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-dependent
  phosphorylation and activation of the Src-homology Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase
  1 (SHP-1), which dephosphorylates VEGFR2 to limit MVEC function. (C) In macrophages,
  CD36 was shown to form a complex with multiple proteins in membrane microdomains,
  including CD9, Toll-Like Receptors, Fc Receptor γ, and Na-K ATPase. Upon oxLDL binding,
  CD36 promotes direct recruitment and activation of Src family kinases (particularly
  Lyn via its association with Na-K ATPase) for signal transduction. This signal transduction
  promotes the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinases for cytoskeletal rearrangement,
  loss of cellular locomotion, and macrophage trapping. In addition, this signal transduction
  increases the generation of reactive oxygen species from NADPH oxidase. These species
  modify the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 inactivating the enzyme, which regulates
  Src kinase-mediated signaling. oxLDL recognition by CD36 also promotes Vav family
  guanine nucleotide exchange factors that promote Rac activity to modulate non-muscle
  myosin II and regulation of cellular locomotion. Vavs also connect CD36 to an oxLDL-uptake
  mechanism that is dependent on dynamin. In relation to oxLDL uptake, MAP kinase
  activation (JNK1/2) was shown to be essential for CD36-mediated macrophage foam
  cell formation. The mechanistic connection between CD36, Toll-like receptors, and
  Na-K ATPase were shown to be linked to activation of pro-inflammatory pathways,
  including the NF-kB pathway and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, that promotes
  atherosclerosis. The CD36 and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway was linked to
  cholesterol crystal deposition and foam cell formation.Image (A) was originally
