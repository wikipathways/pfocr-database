caption: BCMV infection significantly promoted the expression of genes involved in
  the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway throughout poplar mosaic disease progression.
  The expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the flavonoid
  biosynthesis pathway, from phenylalanine to flavonoid metabolites (A), and the expression
  heatmap of DEGs involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (B). The red and
  upward arrow represented the upregulatory expression of genes in poplar leaves,
  the green and downward arrow represented the downregulatory expression, while the
  blue and bidirectional arrow represented the mixed regulatory expression of genes.
  Two side-by-side arrows were used to exhibit the expression of every DEG, the first
  arrow represented the short-period diseased (SD) leaves, while the second arrow
  represented the long-period diseased (LD) leaves. ANR, anthocyanin reductase; ANS,
  anthocyanidin synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CYP75B1,
  flavonoid 3’-monooxygenase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; FLS, flavonol synthase;
  HCT, shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; LAR, leucoanthocyantin reductase;
  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase.
