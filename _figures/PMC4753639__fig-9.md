caption: Hypothetical cell model of basal and elevated ROS conditions on the fate
  of EGFRT790M. (A) At basal condition, active EGFR mutant oxidizes NOX2, elevates
  ROS, and further oxidizes EGFRCysteine797, resulting in mild oxidation of methionine
  on M790. However, basal activity of MsrA can reduce the oxidized form, methionine,
  back to the reduced form and protect it from degradation, resulting in cell survival.
  (B) Under treatment condition, sanguinarine triggers REDOX imbalance by activating
  NOX3, causing NADPH oxidation and depletion, resulting in MsrA inactivation and
  loss of protein reduction protection of the oxidized form, methionine, on M790 of
  EGFR. Accumulation of excessive amount of localized ROS induced EGFRT790M overoxidation,
  degradation, shutdown of the EGFR downstream survival pathway, and induction of
  apoptosis. M790, methionine 790. To see this illustration in color, the reader is
