caption: Overview of cell death in dissociated hESCs. After hESC dissociation, the
  Rho/ROCK signaling pathway is activated, which leads to anoikis. Inhibition of Rho/ROCK
  signaling via Y-27632 suppresses hESC death; however, cloning efficiency is still
  low in many cases. Moreover, dissociation results in cytoskeleton perturbation leading
  to iron accumulation, which forms hydroxyl/peroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction.
  Hydrogen atoms from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) combine to form a lipid
  radical, which interacts quickly with oxygen to form lipid peroxide. This process
  can be inhibited by ferrostatin-1 (fer-1). Lipid peroxides can be degraded into
  reactive aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde (MDA). Decreased iron overload by iron
  chelators such as deferoxamine (DFO) inhibits dissociation-induced ferroptosis in
  hESCs. Activation of p53 is required for ferroptosis in dissociated hESCs. Direct
  transcriptional suppression of SLC7A11, a major component of system XC−, is required
  for ferroptosis. The xCT antiporter (consisting of two subunits SLC7A11 and SLC3A2)
  is responsible for maintaining redox homeostasis through importing cystine, subsequently
  GSH synthesis. Reduced GSH is converted to oxidized GSH by glutathione peroxidase
  4 (GPX4), which also reduces lipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols
  or free hydrogen peroxide to water. Through the elevation of SLC7A11 and GPX4 expression,
  which enables cystine intracellular uptake, Nrf2 is thought to be a critical negative
  regulator of ferroptosis. hESC, human embryonic stem cell; Nrf2, nuclear factor
  erythroid 2–related factor 2; ROCK, Rho kinase.
