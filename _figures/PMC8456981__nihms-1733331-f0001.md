caption: A) During pro-inflammatory immune response, ROCK2 specifically interacts
  with phosphorylated STAT3. ROCK2 activity is required for the formation of the JAK2/STAT3
  complex in Th17 and Tfh cells. Therefore, ROCK2 inhibition results in decreased
  activation of STAT3 and other Th17/Tfh transcription factors, including IRF4, RORγT
  and Bcl6, triggering the significant downregulation of both Th17 and Tfh cells.
  In addition, selective ROCK2 inhibition promotes interaction of ROCK2 with JAK3,
  leading to the increased phosphorylation of STAT5, the upregulation of Treg cells
  and the restoration of immune homeostasis. B) Extracellular mediators, such as LPA,
  thrombin and TGF-β, as well as mechanotransduction forces, activate the RhoA/ROCK
  signaling pathway and its numerous downstream substrates. This results in the polymerization
  of G-actin to F-actin and the formation of contractile fibers. ROCK-induced actin
  polymerization frees the transcription factor MRTF, which is normally sequestered
  in cytoplasm, to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of several
  profibrotic genes, including collagen, α-SMA, CTGF and TGF-β, resulting in changes
  to the cellular structure and an increase in tissue stiffness. C) ROCK2 promotes
  the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-21 via STAT3 phosphorylation,
  consequently leading to the imbalanced activation of B cells and monocytes/macrophages,
  which results in the excessive production of autoantibodies and the secretion of
  profibrotic factors, respectively. The pro-inflammatory milieu downregulates the
  number and function of immunosuppressive Treg cells to sustain the chronic inflammation.
  In addition, ROCK2 facilitates MRTF-mediated transcription and increased expression
  of smooth muscle actin and CTGF, stimulating the differentiation of fibroblasts
  into myofibroblasts and the increased production of collagen, which promote the
  development of fibrosis in target organs. Thus, ROCK2 is integral in the cross-talk
  between the inflammatory and the fibrotic processes driving the pathology of cGVHD.α-SMA,
