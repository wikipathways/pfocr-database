caption: 'Mechanisms of p12I in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected cells:
  (A) p12I binds to the immature forms of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) β and γc
  subunits preventing their traffic to the plasma membrane and the assembly of IL-2/IL-2R
  complex, and hence, inhibits signal transducer and activator of transcription 5
  (STAT5) activation. However, upon binding to p12I, the β and γc subunits co-localize
  and provide new way for STAT5 phosphorylation and activation. Thus, p12I re-routes
  the STAT5 signaling pathway. (B) Through binding to the free human MHC-I heavy chain
  (MHC-I-Hc), p12I obliterates the assembly of functional MHC-I-Hc–β2m complex in
  the plasma membrane resulting in suppression of immune response. (C) p12I has a
  mechanism to increase the concertation of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm while depleting
  Ca2+ from the ER, which affects the Ca2+signaling in the cell. To do so, p12I interacts
  with host proteins (calreticulin and calnexin), which modulate Ca2+ storage. As
  a result, dephosphorylated nuclear factor of T cells (NFAT) migrates to the nucleus
  and induces IL-2 expression and T-cell activation. Other possible role is that p12I
  interacts with calcineurin, thus inhibiting NFAT.'
