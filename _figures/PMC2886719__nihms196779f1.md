caption: Creatine kinase/phosphocreatine energy shuttle pathway and the role of mitochondria
  in apoptotic cell death in neurons. (1) Mitochondrial involvement in apoptosis.
  Mitochondria are intimately involved in apoptotic cell death since, (1) they contain
  pro-apoptotic proteins which can lead to cell death upon release into the cytosol
  (DNA fragmentation is a hallmark feature of apoptosis), and (2) they produce the
  majority of the potentially damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage
  intracellular components (i.e., alter DNA, proteins, lipids) and have also been
  shown to increase the susceptibility to apoptosis by modulating components of the
  channel that traverses the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane termed the mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore (mtPTP). Upon a significant apoptotic insult, mitochondria
  can release pro-apoptotic factors to the cytosol to induce cellular death. The octameric
  form of the mitochondrial creatine kinase (MtCK) interacts with components of the
  mtPTP to suppress pore opening and potentially reduce apoptotic susceptibility.
  Creatine has been shown to maintain the mtCK in an octameric conformation (as opposed
  to dimeric) which inhibits mtPTP opening. (2) Creatine kinase/phosphocreatine energy
  shuttle pathway. Creatine (Cr) is taken up by the neuron via specific creatine transporters
  and transphosphorylated to the high-energy phosphocreatine (PCr) by either mitochondrial
  creatine kinases (MtCKs) or cytosolic creatine kinases (CKs). MtCK is located in
  the intermembrane space of mitochondria and is coupled to ATP production by mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation to produce PCr which is then exported from the organelle.
  Cytosolic CK transphosphorylates ATP generated via glycolysis to PCr. This PCr can
  then contribute to the overall cellular PCr pool. The PCr pool is coupled to localized
  CKs in areas of high ATP demand such as (2a) organelle transport and/or ATP dependent
  cell signaling or (2b) at the cell membrane by ATP-dependent pumps and/or ATP-dependent
  receptors. This localized distribution of CKs allows for the efficient production
  of ATP from ADP to fuel ATP-dependent processes in various portions of the cell.
  (3) Effect of exogenous creatine supplementation (dashed lines). Exogenous creatine
  is transported through the cell membrane via creatine transporters to increase the
  overall creatine pool. (3a) Increased creatine levels may further stabilize the
  octameric form of mtCK to suppress opening of the mtPTP and this may reduce mitochondrially
  mediated apoptosis. (3b) Elevated levels of creatine within the cell can be transphosphorylated
  by mitochondrial and cytosolic creatine kinases (MtCKs and CKs, respectively) to
  enhance the overall PCr pool. Increased PCr levels can be utilized by localized
  creatine kinases to transphosphorylate ADP to ATP for various ATP-dependent processes
  within the cell (2a) and at the cell membrane (2b). (4) Potential neuroprotective
  effects of creatine. Creatine supplementation may improve both the bioenergetic
  and mitochondrial deficits associated with some neurological diseases (more efficacious
  in Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease). These beneficial effects of creatine may
  ultimately reduce neuronal cell death and provide neuroprotection in certain neurodegenerative
  disorders
