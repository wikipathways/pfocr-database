caption: Autophagy Pathway. The autophagic pathway procedes through a series of sequential
  steps. These begin with the initiation of the pathway and autophagosome nucleation.
  This is followed by autophagosomal elongation, a step mediated by two ubiquitin-like
  conjugation systems (i.e., ATG8, and the ATG5/ATG12 systems). ATG12 is conjugated
  to ATG5 by ATG7 (E1-like) and ATG10 (E2-like) enzymes. The resulting ATG5-ATG12
  forms a complex with ATG16L1, which participates in elongation of the autophagic
  membrane. A second conjugation system requires the microtubule-associated protein-1
  light chain 3 (LC3, ATG8). LC3 and its homologues are conjugated with the cellular
  lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The precursor form of LC3 is cleaved by the
  protease ATG4B to generate the LC3-I form, with an exposed lipid conjugation site
  at the C-terminal glycine residue. Conjugation of PE with LC3-I occurs from the
  sequential action of ATG7 (E1-like) and ATG3 (E2-like) activities. In mammals, the
  conversion of LC3-I (free form) to LC3-II (PE-conjugated form) is a key regulatory
  step in autophagosome formation. The next steps involve autophagosome maturation,
  including the sequestration of an autophagic cargo (e.g., dysfunctional mitochondria)
  followed by autophagosome/lysosome fusion. In the final stage, autophagosomal cargoes
  are digested by lysosomal enzymes, and the contents released for metabolic recycling.
