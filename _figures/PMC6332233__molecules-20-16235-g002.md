  the established relationships, and dashed arrows indicate hypothetical relationships.
  RA is mainly biosynthesized from the pathway showed with black arrows in S. miltiorrhiza,
  and part is from the pathway showed with green arrows. PAL: phenylalanine ammonialyase,
  C4H: cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase, 4CL: 4-coumaroyl: CoA ligase, TAT: tyrosine aminotransferase,
  HPPR: 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase, RAS: rosmarinic acid synthase.'
