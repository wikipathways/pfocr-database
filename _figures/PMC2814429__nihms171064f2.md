caption: 'Regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. (a) Autophagy. Induction of autophagy
  requires activity of Beclin1 and its interacting partner, class III phosphoinositide
  3 kinase (PI3K), also known as Vps34. Bcl-2/BclXL, can bind to Beclin1 and inhibit
  autophagy. By contrast, autophagy is negatively regulated by class I PI3K through
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The elongation and shape of autophagosomes
  are controlled by two protein (and lipid) conjugation systems, namely the autophagy-related
  gene (ATG)12 pathway and the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3
  or ATG8)–phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) pathway. These pathways are similar to the
  ubiquitin conjugation systems and include E1-activating and E2-conjugating enzymes.
  ATG12 is a first modifier that is essential for the formation of autophagosomal
  precursors and isolation membranes. ATG12 is activated by ATG7 (an E1 ubiquitin-like
  enzyme), transferred to ATG10 (an E2 ubiquitin-like enzyme) and conjugated to ATG5,
  which subsequently forms a complex with ATG16. The membrane-bound ATG12–ATG5–ATG16
  complex is a prerequisite for recruitment of LC3-II, the product of the second ubiquitin-like
  conjugation. Initially, LC3 is cleaved by the protease ATG4 to generate LC3-I. LC3-I
  is then activated by ATG7, transferred to ATG3 (a second E2 ubiquitin-like enzyme)
  and conjugated to PE. The resulting LC3-II is recruited into the forming autophagosomal
  membrane. The Beclin-1–Vps34 autophagy complex can be inhibited by another Beclin-1-interacting
  partner, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. After completion of autophagosome formation,
  a second cleavage by ATG4 results in some removal of PE from LC3-II, reverting it
  into LC3-I, which is released from the membrane. The remaining membrane-attached
  LC3-II is degraded by lysosomal proteases. The LC3-II:LC3-I ratio has been demonstrated
  to correlate with the extent of autophagosome formation. (b) Signaling and processes
  of autophagy and apoptosis. Autophagy: cytosol, containing proteins or organelles
  (such as damaged mitochondria), is sequestered by an expanding membrane. This double-membrane
  structure fuses with the lysosome to form an autolysosome, generating the autophagolysosome.
  Apoptosis: the extrinsic pathway is mediated by caspase-8, whereas the intrinsic
  pathway is mediated by caspase-9. FADD (FAS-associated via death domain), an adaptor
  protein that couples death receptors (such as CD95) and Bcl-2/BclXL, inhibits the
  loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria
  and forms the apoptosome together with apoptotic-protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1)
  and pro-caspase-9. Active caspase-9 and caspase-8 can activate caspase -3, leading
  to cell death apoptosis.'
