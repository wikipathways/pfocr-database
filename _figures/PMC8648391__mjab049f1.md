caption: The role of the C/EBPβ‒RMRP‒SNRPA1‒p53 signaling pathway in tumor response
  to PARP inhibition. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) lead to the increase of RMRP expression
  by the transcription factor C/EBPβ. RMRP then interacts with and retains SNRPA1
  in the nucleus to prevent the lysosomal degradation of the latter via the chaperone-mediated
  autophagy pathway. The nuclear SNRPA1 binds to p53 and promotes MDM2-mediated p53
  ubiquitination and degradation, which compromises PARPi-triggered p53 activation,
  resulting in the protective upregulation of cell cycle and DNA repair genes (left
  panel). Targeting RMRP prompts the nuclear export and lysosomal degradation of SNRPA1.
  In the absence of SNRPA1, p53 can be fully activated by PARPi, thus eliminating
  cancer cells by inducing apoptosis or ferroptosis (right panel) (created with BioRender.com).
