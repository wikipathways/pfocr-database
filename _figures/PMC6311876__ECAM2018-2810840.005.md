caption: Proposed scheme of nutmeg action in soleus muscle. Activation of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) pathway can promote skeletal muscle hypertrophy and increase skeletal
  muscle mass. This pathway's effect on skeletal muscle has implicated most prominently
  downstream of IGF1 signalling. IGF1 can lead to muscle hypertrophy coming predominantly
  through its ability to activate the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. AKT is a serine-threonine
  protein kinase that can induce protein synthesis by activating mTOR and its downstream
  effectors. The kinase mTOR interacts with several proteins to form two complexes
  mTORC1 and mTORC2 that leads to protein synthesis. AKT blocks key mediators of skeletal
  muscle atrophy transcriptional factor and ubiquitin ligases, thereby inhibiting
  nuclear translocation of the FoxO. Once phosphorylated by AKT, the FoxOs are excluded
  from the nucleus, and upregulation of MuRF1 and MAFbx is blocked so it leads to
  inhibiting protein degradation. Inhibition FoxO also leads to expression autophagy-related
  genes such as LC3 and thereby the autophagy process also decreased by inhibition
  of FoxO. The IGF1-AKT-mTOR pathway plays crucial role in muscle mass and function
  maintenance and also among elderly and can be also one of the potential targets
  of sarcopenia treatment. Macelignan found in nutmeg extract is already known to
  have PPAR-γ agonist effect. From previous in vitro study, nutmeg extract shows positive
  effects toward insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Nutmeg extract may also
  have another activity that modulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) that can
  induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy or at least preserve muscle mass through protein
  synthesis via IGF1-AKT-mTOR pathway.
