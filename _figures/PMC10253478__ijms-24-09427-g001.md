caption: 'Mechanisms of action of probiotics. (A) Competitive adhesion and exclusion
  of potential pathogens. Probiotics create a hostile environment via changes in luminal
  pH as well as production of bacteriocins and biosurfactants. (B) Stimulation of
  intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) proliferation and epithelial barrier enhancement.
  Probiotics modulate IECs-dependent mucin production through regulation of several
  MUC genes. Moreover, probiotics enhance epithelial barrier and tight junctions due
  to their modulation of the NF-κB, MAPK PI3K/Akt and PKCs signalling pathways. (C)
  Interaction of probiotics and their metabolites (mainly short-chain fatty acids
  (SCFAs) and tryptophane) with the enteric nervous system. Probiotics modulate neurocognitive
  processes and epithelial barrier balance via vagus and enteric nerves; probiotics
  also affect the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis via the regulation of
  several neurotransmitter levels, including CORT and/or ACTH, BDNF, 5-HT, c-Fos,
  DA, ACh and GABA. (D) Interaction of probiotics with the immune system: (i) regulation
  of Th1/Th2 cytokine balance and activation of CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg cells; (ii) increased
  levels of B cell-dependent secretory IgA (sIgA) and concomitant reduction in IgE
  levels; and (iii) downregulation of NF-κB signalling pathway and subsequent inhibition
  of inflammatory cytokines expression. Abbreviations: GC: goblet cell; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol
