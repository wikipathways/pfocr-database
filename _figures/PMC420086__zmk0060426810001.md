caption: Pathways for conversion of selected nonfermentable carbon sources to glucose.
  Glyoxylate cycle is shown at top, shunting of succinate to feed gluconeogenesis
  is shown by downward arrows leading to oxaloacetate on left, and gluconeogenesis
  is shown by downward arrows leading from phosphoenolpyruvate to glucose on right.
  Key intermediates are shown. Carbon sources used in this study are in boxes, enzymatic
  steps unique to the glyoxylate pathway have gray arrowheads, and genes that block
  specific steps when mutated are italicized in gray.
