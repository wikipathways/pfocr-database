caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathway of 1. (A) Formation of an unusual amino acid,
  γ-hydroxymethyl-l-glutamic acid 5, from two molecules of pyruvic acid dimerized
  by an aldolase CghB. (B) CghG-catalyzed synthesis of the linear substrate and a
  tetramic acid moiety, and the two final products that can be formed by the proposed
  Diels–Alder reaction. Abbreviations: KS, ketosynthase; MAT, malonyl-CoA acyltransferase;
  DH, dehydratase; MT, methyltransferase; KR, ketoreductase; ACP, acyl carrier protein;
  C, condensation; A, adenylation; T, thiolation; R, reductase; ER, enoyl reductase;
  SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine.'
