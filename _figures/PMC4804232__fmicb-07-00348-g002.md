caption: Main roles of T. cruzi TS on the host immune responses. (A) Upon entry in
  the host milieu, which is rich in SAcs donors, the parasite surface gets a negatively
  charged barrier due to a reaction catalyzed by TS, conferring protection against
  the complement-mediated killing. (B) TS favors T. cruzi escape from the parasitophorous
  vacuole, process in which LAMP and Tc-Tox proteins are also shown to be involved.
  Moreover, TS is able to interfere with IL-12 secretion by dendritic cells through
  the interaction between sialylated molecules on T. cruzi surface and Siglecs on
  dendritic cell surface. (C) SAPA-antigen induces the production of non-protective
  antibodies. Moreover, recent findings have show that TS acts on both mature follicular
  and marginal zone CD220+CD19+B cells to induce the expression of IL-17 by a non-canonical
  signaling pathway. These signaling events promote changes in the glycosylation profile
  of CD45 that result in their phosphatase activity and subsequent activation of downstream
  signals leading to the Il-17 gene expression. (D) TS can also induce the activation
  of CD4+T cells in vivo. In addition, TS can also promote changes in the sialylation
  pattern of activated CD8 +T cells, dampening the protective functions of MHC class
  I-dependent lymphocyte killing responses against T. cruzi parasites.
