caption: 'Signaling domains and their functions in programmed cell death (PCD) pathways.
  This figure shows simplified versions of major PCD pathways, focusing on the interaction
  properties of the domains. The arrangement of the proteins in homo-oligomeric complexes
  is not shown. Coloring: six-helix death-fold domains (death domain [DD], death effector
  domain [DED], caspase activation and recruitment domain [CARD], pyrin domain [PYD])
  are shown in cyan, RIP homotypic interaction motifs (RHIMs) in orange, and Toll
  and IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains in purple. The central STAND ATPase domains (both
  NB-ARC and NACHT type) are blue and repetitive sensor domains (leucine-rich repeat
  [LRR], WD40) are green. Caspase domains are yellow and supposedly pore-forming domains
  (gasdermin amino-terminal domain, HET domain, and HeLo/coiled-coil [CC]) are shown
  in red. All other domain types are shown in gray. Homotypic oligomerization is indicated
  by double arrows colored by domain type. Proteolytic cleavage is indicated by a
  scissors symbol, whereas translocation events are shown as red arrows. Cell death
  stimuli are shown on a black background. (A) Apoptosis. Both the extrinsic pathway,
  triggered by ligand binding to a death receptor, and the intrinsic pathway initiated
  by a mitochondrial signal are shown. (B) Necroptosis. Only the main components of
  the canonical pathway, triggered by TNF-receptor type 1 (TNFR1) ligation, is shown
  here. (C) Pyroptosis. Both major pathways are shown: caspase-11 (human: caspase-4/5)
  triggering by intracellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and caspase-1 activation by
  signalosome signaling. (D) Fungal heterokaryon incompatibility (HI). Two HI systems
  are shown: Het-E (from one fusion partner) being triggered by Het-C (contributed
  by the other partner), and Het-S (from one fusion partner) being recruited to an
  amyloid formed by Het-s (from the other fusion partner). (E) Plant hypersensitive
  response. One example for each class of R-protein is shown: The CC-NB-LRR (CNL)-based
  ZAR1 resistosome is triggered by the ZAR1/RKS1 complex recognizing PBL2, which has
  been previously modified by the pathogen effector AvrAC. The dimer of the two TIR-NB-LRR
  (TNL)-based STAND proteins RPS4 and RRS1 is triggered by binding to the pathogen
  effector AvrRps4 and signals cell death via the EDS1/SAG101 complex.'
