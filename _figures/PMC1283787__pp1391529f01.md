caption: Oxylipin pathway. In the oxylipin pathway, 13-HPOD is catabolized by CYP74B
  (HPL) to produce hexanal and 12-oxo-cis-9-dodecenoic acid, and 13-HPOT is catabolized
  by either CYP74B (HPL) to form cis-3-hexenal and 12-oxo-cis-9-dodecenoic acid or
  by CYP74A (AOS) to form JA and its derivatives. cis-3-Hexenal is further converted
  to trans-2-hexenal by an isomerization factor and all C6 aldehydes are interconverted
  to their alcohol forms by ADHs.
