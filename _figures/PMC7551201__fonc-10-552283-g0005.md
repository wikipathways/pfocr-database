caption: S100A8/A9 provides a premetastatic environment. S100A8/A9 expresses on tumor
  cells and also inflammatory cells. S100A8/A9–RAGE interaction results in activation
  of Smad, NF-κB, ERK1/ERK2, and SAPK/JNK pathways and increasing the leukocyte recruitment
  angiogenesis, tumor migration, and wound healing and consequently providing premetastatic
  niches. MDSCs will promote immunosuppressive microenvironment by activation of NF-κB
  pathway and also cause chemotaxis by P38 activation.
