caption: 'Pathways and networks associated with proteins with differential abundance
  according to IPA. (A) The top canonical pathway significantly associated with the
  differentially expressed proteins - Acute Phase Response Signaling (p = 6,99 e−14).
  (B) Highest ranked protein network of functional associations between 23 proteins
  with differential abundance - Cancer, Organism injury and abnormalities and Gastrointestinal
  Disease. Most of the proteins with differential abundance are closely connected
  in the network through three major nodes: P38 MARK, Pro-inflamatory cytokine and
  ERK1/2. The network is graphically displayed with proteins as nodes and the biological
  relationships between the nodes as lines. The color of the shapes indicates the
  degree of over-expression (red) or under-expression (green) of the corresponding
  protein in PCa compared to BPH samples. Direct connection between molecules is represented
  by a solid line and indirect connection by broken line. The length of a line reflects
  published evidence supporting the node-to-node relationship concerned. (C) Selected
  subset of proteins with differential abundance associated with cancer in humans
  or cancer cell lines.'
