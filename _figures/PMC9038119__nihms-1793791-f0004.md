caption: Schematic representation of methionine metabolism. Underlined are metabolites
  and enzymes that were associated with lifespan extension. Red font color represents
  downregulation or depletion from food, while green font color represents overexpression
  or supplementation. In the methionine cycle, methionine is converted to S-adenosyl-l-methionine
  (SAM), which acts as a methyl donor for methyltransferases, forming S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine
  (SAH), and finally, homocysteine. Downregulation of methionine adenosyltransferase
  (SAMS) and S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase (ACHY), and overexpression of Glycine
  N- methyltransferase (GNMT) were associated with lifespan extension. In the methionine
  salvage pathway, methionine can be regenerated from SAM, forming polyamines during
  the cycle. Supplementation of the polyamines spermine and spermidine was associated
  with lifespan extension in several species. In the transsulfuration pathway, homocysteine
  is converted into cysteine, which can then be metabolized into taurine, pyruvate,
  and glutathione. Upregulation of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and glutamate-cysteine
  ligase (GCL), as well as supplementation with the cysteine donor N-acetylcysteine
  (NAC) were associated with lifespan increase.
