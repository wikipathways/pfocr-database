caption: Interactions between ethylene, abscisic acid, and nitric oxide signaling
  pathways in the regulation of seed germination and dormancy. This scheme is based
  on genetic analyses, microarray data, and physiological studies on seed responsiveness
  to ABA, ethylene, or NO. ABA binding to PYR/PYL/RCAR receptor induces the formation
  of a protein complex with PP2C and the inhibition of phosphatase activity. In the
  absence of ABA, PP2C dephosphorylate SnRK2. When ABA is present, PP2C binding to
  the receptor releases inhibition of SnRK2 activity, which can phosphorylate downstream
  targets, including ABI5-related transcription factors. Interactions between ABI3
  and ABI5 mediate transcriptional regulation of ABA-responsive genes. Ethylene positively
  regulates its own biosynthesis, by acting on ACC synthesis catalyzed by ACS and
  subsequent conversion to ethylene by ACO. This last step is also subject to ABA
  inhibition. Ethylene is perceived by receptors (among which ETR1) located in the
  endoplasmic reticulum; its binding leads to the deactivation of the receptors that
  become enable to recruit CTR1. Release of CTR1 inhibition allows EIN2 to act as
  a positive regulator of ethylene signaling pathway. EIN2 acts upstream of nuclear
  transcription factors, such as EIN3, EILs, and ERBPs/ERFs. Ethylene down-regulates
  ABA accumulation by both inhibiting its synthesis and promoting its inactivation,
  and also negatively regulates ABA signaling. In germinating seeds, NO enhances ABA
  catabolism and may also negatively regulate ABA synthesis and perception. Moreover,
  NO promotes both ethylene synthesis and signaling pathway. ABA, abscisic acid; ABI3,
