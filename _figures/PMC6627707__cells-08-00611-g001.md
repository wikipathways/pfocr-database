caption: Biogenesis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying micro RNAs (miRNAs) in
  viral infection. (A) After infection of the cells, different viral components (proteins
  and genetic material) are available in the cytoplasm and (B) can be encapsulated
  by endosomes generating endocytic vesicles. (C) During the biogenesis of small EVs
  (exosomes), formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) occurs by the inward budding
  of endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which can be delivered to and degraded
  by the lysosomal pathway or follow an exocytic pathway that leads to the plasma
  membrane, where they fuse and release the EVs from the cell. (D) EVs can carry functional
  biomolecules, which may be of viral origin or be from the infected cell itself,
  such as proteins, DNA, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and miRNAs, which have important
  immunomodulatory effects. In addition, EVs carry a profile of membrane components
  similar to those of the source cell in addition to tetraspanins (CD63, CD81, and
  CD9). (E) Infection can stimulate the synthesis of different families and types
  of miRNAs capable of acting on the target cell and contribute to the establishment
  of the infection, increasing its infectivity and/or diminishing immune activation.
  (F) The release of medium EVs (microvesicles) occurs via a pathway independent of
  the formation of MVBs and exocytosis, shedding directly from the cytoplasmic membrane.
