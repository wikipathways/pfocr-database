caption: 'A model depicting the miR-22-mediated beneficial effect of T2 in HFD rats.
  The effect of T2 is represented by bold lines: the down-regulation of miR-22 in
  response to T2 treatment results in a reduced inhibitory effect on the expression
  of Tcf7 whose hepatic level increases, with the consequence of a reduced expression
  of gluconeogenesis enzymes and gluconeogenesis impairing.'
papertitle: miR-22-3p is involved in gluconeogenic pathway modulated by 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine
  (T2).
