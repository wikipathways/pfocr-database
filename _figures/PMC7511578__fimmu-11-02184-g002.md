caption: 'Saccharolytic fermentation of dietary non-digestible carbohydrates into
  short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gut microbiota. A cross feeding of intermediate
  metabolites between species exists. Acetate produced by Bifidobacterium spp. is
  utilized by Firmicutes (F. prausnitzii, Roseburia, Anaerostipes, Eubacterium) to
  produce butyrate (). Lactate, succinate and 1, 2-propanediol do not usually accumulate
  to high levels in the colon of healthy adult humans due to their utilization by
  the propionate and butyrate-producing species (, ). Deficiency of these species
  and their metabolic by-products permits a “leaky gut” with transfer of bacteria
  and lipopolysaccharide to systemic circulation. A plausible hematogenous spread
  of these pathogen-associated molecular patterns to the genital tract or global induction
  of systemic inflammation can lead to genital tract infection/inflammation and unfavorable
  gynecological/reproductive outcomes (). Furthermore, translocation of gut microbial
  species to the vagina and consequent high levels of vaginal SCFA production alters
  the vaginal microbiota leading to infection (). AP, acrylate pathway; bat, butyryl-CoA:acetyl-CoA
