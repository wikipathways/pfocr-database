caption: The influence of metabolic alterations of leukemia cells and immune cells
  on the immune responses under the microenvironment. Reprogramming glucose-related
  metabolism impacts immunity via releasing lactate and hydrogen ions, which create
  an acidic microenvironment, as well as depriving of extracellular glucose, resulting
  in an immunosuppressive status of filtrating immune cells. Furthermore, leukemia
  cells also destitute the amino acids in the microenvironment, leading to the inactivation
  of T lymphocytes and phenotype shift of monocytes. Lastly, by recruiting adipocytes
  in the BMM via the lipid-related pathway, leukemia cells reveal a potential effect
  on immunological regulation. Immune cells, like tumor-associated macrophages, tumor-associated
  DCs, and MDSCs can also impact the T cells’ function via upregulating the expression
  of IDO and arginine-1, contributing to an immune-tolerant microenvironment. The
