caption: Enzymatic pathways of the biosynthesis and degradation of the two main endocannabinoids,
  anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Note that both endocannabinoids can be generated
  by multiple, parallel biosynthetic pathways, whereas their enzymatic degradation
  occurs predominantly through a single, selective pathway. Selective inhibition of
  the degrading enzymes FAAH and MGL might have therapeutic potential in conditions
  where an increase in endocannabinoid tone is desirable.
