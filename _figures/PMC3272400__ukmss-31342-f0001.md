caption: The BH3-only proteins Bim and Bmf are subjected to multiple layers of regulation.
  Gene transcription of Bim can be induced by inhibition of the AKT survival pathway
  leading to FOXO3a nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of bim. Both
  BH3-only protein genes can be activated by TGF-β-mediated signals, engaging Smad4
  and/or RUNX1/3 transcription factors. Translation of Bim can be blocked by binding
  of c-Myc-induced micro RNAs to the 3′UTR of bim mRNA. At the post-translational
  level, Bim and Bmf can be rendered inactive by sequestration along microtubules
  or actin filaments through binding to dynein light chain molecules, DLC1 or DLC2,
  respectively. Activation of the Ras/Raf/ERK-signaling cascade leads to phosphorylation
  and to proteasomal degradation of Bim and interferes with induction of Bmf during
  anoikis by a so far unknown mechanism. Alternatively, phosphorylation of Bim was
  also reported to prompt cytoplasmic sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins, whereas JNK-mediated
  phosphorylation of Bim and Bmf is suggested to render the proteins more active.
  Once activated, Bim and Bmf can neutralize Bcl-2 pro-survival proteins at mitochondria,
  leading to Bax/Bak activation and Bim may possibly also trigger Bax oligomerization
  by direct protein–protein interaction. BH, Bcl-2 homology; Bmf, Bcl-2 modifying
  factor.
