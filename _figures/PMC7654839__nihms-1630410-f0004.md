caption: a. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) as a cation-permeant channel is non-selective
  toward H+, K+, Na+, and Ca2+.b. OptoXRs as light-sensing rhodopsin-GPCR chimeras.
  The extracellular and TM regions are derived from a light-sensitive rhodopsin, while
  intracellular regions from different adrenergic receptors (β2AR or α1AR).c. Blue
  light-mediated isomerization of the light-absorbing retinal cofactor triggers the
  conformation change of melanopsin (OPN4) and subsequent activation of Gαq-phospholipase
  C (PLC) to induce Ca2+ influx via TRPC channel.d. Opto-RTKs as photoactivatable
  membrane-anchored receptor tyrosine kinases. The intracellular domain of RTKs (FGFR
  or TrK), is fused to CRY2 or other optical dimerizers, thereby enabling light-inducible
  clustering to activate downstream signaling, including the PLC pathway and subsequent
  Ca2+ mobilization.e. LOV2-CaM-M13 hybrid protein as a photoactivatable Ca2+ releaser
  (PACR). Photostimulation results in the release of bound Ca2+ into the surrounding
  environment.f. Domain architecture of STIM1. SP, signal peptide; EF, EF-hand Ca2+-binding
  motif; SAM, sterile alpha motif; TM, transmembrane domain; CC1, coiled-coil domain
  1; SOAR, STIM-Orai activating region; PS, proline-serine rich domain; PB, polybasic
  domain.g. Genetically-encoded Ca2+ channel actuators (GECAs) derived from STIM1.(Left)
  schematic illustrating functional STIM1-ORAI1 coupling in response to store depletion.
  Ca2+ depletion within the ER lumen induces oligomerization of the luminal EF-SAM
  domain to initiate STIM1 activation and triggers conformational switch to expose
  SOAR/CAD and the C terminal PB domain. Next, STIM1 undergoes further oligomerization
  and migration toward the PM, a process facilitated by the association between SOAR/CAD
  and ORAI1, as well as the interaction between positively-charged PB and negatively-charged
  phosphoinositides embedded in PM. SOAR/CAD is responsible for direct engagement
  and activation of ORAI channels to mediate Ca2+ influx.(right) Optogenetic engineering
  to convert store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) into light-operated Ca2+ entry (LOCE).
  (i) A protein oligomerization-based engineering strategy using various optical dimerizers
  (Opto-CRAC2) and CRY2-STIM1 fusion proteins (OptoSTIM1, monSTIM1, and eOS1). Upon
  light illumination, CRY2 or optical dimerizers undergoes oligomerization, mimicking
  Ca2+ -depletion induced EF-SAM multimerization in ER lumen, to trigger STIM1 activation
  and the subsequent opening of ORAI Ca2+ channels in the PM. (ii) The design of GECAs
  based on LOV2 conformational switch (Opto-CRAC1, LOVS1K or BACCS), in which the
  CC1-SOAR interaction-mediated intramolecular autoinhibition is mimicked by LOV2-SOAR
  fusion in the dark. Upon photostimulation, LOV2 undergoes conformational changes
  to expose SOAR/CAD, which engages PM-resident ORAI Ca2+ channel to induce Ca2+ influx.
