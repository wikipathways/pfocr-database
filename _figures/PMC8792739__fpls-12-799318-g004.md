caption: Biosynthesis and signaling of salicylic acid. (A) In Arabidopsis, a model
  for salicylic acid (SA) production has been proposed. Genetic investigations showed
  the isochorismate pathway in the upper panel. Biochemical research showed the phenylpropanoid
  pathway in the lower panel. (B) NPR1 forms an oligomer in the cytosol in cells with
  low SA levels, and NPR3 and NPR4 bind leftover NPR1 in the nucleus to block NPR1
  activity. NPR1 becomes monomeric and reaches the nucleus in cells with high SA levels,
  where SA binds to NPR3 and NPR4 to disrupt their transcriptional repression action.
  NPR1 interacts with TGAs in SA-responsive promoters, causing defensive responses
  to be activated. BA2H stands for benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase; ICS stands for isochorismate
  synthase; IPL stands for isochorismate pyruvate lyase; NPR stands for non-expresser
  of pathogenesis-related genes; PAL stands for phenylalanine ammonia lyase; SA stands
  for salicylic acid; TGA stands for TGACG-binding factor. Adapted from .
