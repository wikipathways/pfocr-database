caption: During metabolic stress, SIRT1 translocate from nucleus to cytoplasm and
  activates the cellular energy sensing enzyme AMPK that stimulates catabolic processes
  such as glucose uptake and beta oxidation and decreases anabolic processes such
  as protein and fatty acid synthesis. AMPK then phosphorylate ACC1 and inactivates
  it so that the fatty acid synthesis is inhibited. ACC1 converts mitochondrial acetyl
  CoA to malonyl CoA (cytoplasmic), and fatty acid synthase (FASN) converts malonyl
  CoA to palmitate in multiple steps that enters the Fatty acid oxidation pathway
  in the mitochondria. Acetyl-coA pathway appears to centrally coordinate both mitochondrial
  function and cellular metabolism.
