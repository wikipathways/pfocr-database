caption: Biochemical mechanisms of oncometabolite accumulation. Inactivating mutations
  in genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and fumarate hydratase (FH), as
  well as oncogenic mutations in isocytrate dehydrogenase (IDH), lead to the accumulation
  of succinate, fumarate and D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG). These oncometabolites
  inhibit α-KG-dependent dioxygenases, including prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), the ten-eleven
  translocation (TET) family of methylcytosine hydroxylases and histone lysine demethylases
  (KDMs), leading to HIF1α stabilization and alterations in gene expression through
  epigenetic modifications. Separately, fumarate inactivates by succination both aconitase
  2 (ACO2) and Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which results in the activation
  of the antioxidant pathway mediated by NRF2, and also generates succinated glutathione
  (GSF), an alternative substrate to glutathione reductase (GSR). Additionally, tumor
  cells can use alternative ways to increase oncometabolite concentration, such as
  the upregulation of the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1, which inhibits the activity
  of SDH, leading to the intracellular accumulation of succinate. 2SC, succination
  of cysteine residues; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; GSH, reduced glutathione;
  HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; IMS, intermembrane space, M, methylation; OAA, oxaloacetate;
  P, phosphorylation, Succ-CoA, succinyl-CoA; U, ubiquitination.
