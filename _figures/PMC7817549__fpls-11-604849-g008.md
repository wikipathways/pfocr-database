caption: 'Simplified representation of KEGG phenylpropanoid pathway. Enzymes identified
  in protein modules are highlighted in red according to their response within each
  genotype and protein-module assessed. Resistant-R3 and susceptible-S4 genotypes
  are indicated with square and circle shapes, respectively. Protein modules were
  represented by their module colors. e.c. numbers correspond to: e.c. 2.1.1.68—caffeate
  O-methyltransferase enzyme; e.c. 1.1.1.195—cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase; e.c.
  1.2.1.68—coniferyl-aldehyde dehydrogenase; e.c. 1.11.1.7—peroxidase; e.c. 2.3.1.133—shikimate
  O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase. Enzymes and related precursors and products, which
  are not present in “R” and “S” protein modules, were removed.'
