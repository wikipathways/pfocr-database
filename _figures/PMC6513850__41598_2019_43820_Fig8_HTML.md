caption: Diagrammatic model summarising the proposed bimodal Wnt signalling regulation
  by DYRK1A, as reported in Figs –. (A) Basal/Inactive Wnt signalling conditions,
  whereby nuclear translocation of β-catenin is prevented via its proteasomal degradation,
  mediated by the destruction complex. (B) Active Wnt signalling, whereby Frizzled
  receptor stimulation by ligands results in membrane recruitment of the destruction
  complex, cytosolic release and nuclear translocation of ‘free’ β-catenin followed
  by TCF/LEF binding and transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes. (C) DYRK1A
  overexpression alone results in significant downregulation of Wnt signalling activity
  (Fig. , blue) along with prominent nuclear localisation of the DYRK1A protein (Fig. ,
  left green). (D) DYRK1A-DVL1 co-expression (ie under active Wnt signalling conditions)
  significantly enhances Wnt signalling activation levels (Fig. , red) and leads to
  cytoplasmic accumulation of DYRK1A (Fig. , right green), likely mediated by direct
  interaction with DVL1 (Figs  and , right yellow). This DYRK1A redistribution pattern
  is also observed following Wnt stimulation with LiCl or Wnt3a (Fig. , right green).
  (E) Consistently, DYRK1A inhibition results in decreased levels of active Wnt signalling
  following LiCl or Wnt3a treatment, relative to pathway stimulation alone (Fig. ).
