caption: p53 induced by telomere dysfunction binds to the promoters of PPARγ co-activator
  1α (PGC1α) and PGC1β and represses the expression of PGC1A and PGC1B. The repression
  of both co-activators impairs overall mitochondrial biogenesis and function and
  leads to defective ATP generation and increased levels of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). PGCs are also involved in energy metabolism by regulating different biochemical
  pathways such as fatty acid oxidation, gluconeogenesis, glucose uptake and oxidation.
  The compromise in mitochondrial function and other biochemical pathways might equally
  lead to functional decline in tissue stem cells and post-mitotic tissues and drive
  ageing. Telomerase reactivation or PGC overexpression can reverse PGC-associated
  metabolic and mitochondrial changes in mice with established telomere dysfunction.
  Telomere dysfunction may also lead to compromised mitochondrial function and energy
  metabolism through other pathways (dashed arrows).
