caption: Viruses interfere with autophagosome formation and fusion with the lysosome. Herpes
  simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) neurovirulence factor ICP34.5 directly targets Beclin
  1 to block autophagosome formation. ICP34.5 also recruits the phosphatase PP1α to
  dephosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (eIF2α) and
  blocks tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-mediated autophagosome maturation. HSV-1 tegument
  protein Us11 interacts with interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein
  kinase (PKR) to prevent the phosphorylation of eIF2α and regulates autophagosome
  formation. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes a functional homologue of ICP34.5
  called TRS1, which can bind to Beclin 1 and inhibit autophagy. γ-Herpesviruses carry
  viral homologues of B cell lymphoma-2 (vBCL-2), which attenuate autophagosome formation
  by interacting with Beclin 1. vBCL-2 evades JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation,
  allowing it to bind to Beclin 1 with high affinity. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated
  herpesvirus (KSHV) expresses another host protein homologue, vFLIP, that prevents
  autophagy protein 3 (ATG3) from processing LC3 during phagosome elongation. KSHV
  K7 interacts with Rubicon and inhibits fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome.
  Viruses also control autophagosome formation and remodel vesicles for viral replication.
  Poliovirus induces autophagy to form a double-membrane vesicle (DMV) for replication.
  The poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A increase LC3 lipidation and DMV formation. The
  foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) capsid protein VP1 uses the adaptor p62 for
  autophagosome formation. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) hijacks the LC3-coated EDEMsosome
  by accumulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like
  protein 1 (EDEM1) and OS-9 in DMVs. Flaviviruses (dengue virus (DENV), West Nile
  virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV)) use ER-derived membranes for viral replication.
  ZIKV non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) and NS4B activate autophagy by inhibiting
  AKT and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Furthermore, the viral
  protease NS3 cleaves reticulophagy regulator 1 (FAM134B) to block reticulophagy
  so that ZIKV can use the ER as a replication site. Influenza A virus (IAV) M2 binds
  to and relocalizes LC3 to the plasma membrane. A highly pathogenic IAV H5N1 strain
  modulates the AKT–tuberin (TSC2)–mTOR pathway to induce autophagy. Human parainfluenza
  virus type 3 (HPIV3) also directly inhibits the interaction between syntaxin 17
  (STX17) and synaptosomal-associated protein 29 (SNAP29) by expressing phosphoprotein
  P, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes. HPIV3 matrix protein M interacts
  with elongation factor Tu, mitochondrial (TUFM), inducing mitophagy to inhibit the
  interferon response. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has multiple targets to regulate the
  autophagic pathway. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B binds to ATG5. By differentially
  inducing the expression of Rubicon and ultraviolet radiation resistance-associated
  gene protein (UVRAG), HCV NS4B temporally regulates the autophagic flux to enhance
  viral replication. Host immunity-related GTPase family M protein (IRGM) is also
  targeted by HCV for Golgi apparatus fragmentation and viral replication. Viral proteins
  inducing or inhibiting autophagy are displayed in red and blue, respectively. ARF,
