caption: Overview of the folate metabolic pathway. Folates require several transport
  systems to enter the cells, the best characterized being the reduced folate carrier
  (RFC1). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) reduces 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  (5,10-MTHF) to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF). Subsequently, methionine synthase
  (MTR) transfers a methyl group from 5-MTHF to homocysteine (Hcy) forming methionine
  (Met) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). Methionine is then converted to S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) in a reaction catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). Most of the
  SAM generated is used in transmethylation reactions, whereby SAM is converted to
  S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that transfer the
  methyl group to the DNA. Vitamin B12 (or cobalamin) is a cofactor of MTR, and methionine
  synthase reductase (MTRR) is required for the maintenance of MTR in its active state.
  If not converted into methionine, Hcy can be condensed with serine to form cystathionine
  in a reaction catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), which requires vitamin
  B6 as a cofactor. Cystathionine can be then utilized to form the antioxidant compound
  glutathione (GSH). Another important function of tetrahydrofolate derivatives is
  in the de novo synthesis of DNA and RNA precursors, where they are used by thymidylate
  synthase (TYMS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD) for the synthesis
  of nucleic acid precursors. MTHFD is a trifunctional enzyme that interconverts tetrahydrofolate
  derivatives for purine, methionine and thymidylate synthesis. TYMS requires 5,10-MTHF
  and deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) for the production of to deoxythymine monophospate
  (dTMP) and dihydrofolate (DHF) in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines. Other enzymes
  participate in folate metabolism, among them phosphoribosylglycinamide transformylase
  (GART) which is a protein required for purine synthesis.
