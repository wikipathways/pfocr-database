caption: Key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways potentially responsible
  for HD pathology. The diagram summarizes the key DEGs and pathways generated from
  data synthesis, which may explain the differential vulnerability of indirect pathway
  medium spiny neurons (iMSNs) compared to other cell types in brain.
