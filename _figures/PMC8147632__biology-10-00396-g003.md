caption: Our hypothetical thesis of molecular pathogenesis of cutaneous RDD. In MAPK/ERK
  pathway, a signaling cascade is initiated when ligands bind to two receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTK) subunits and induce receptor dimerization. Adaptor proteins such as
  growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (GRB2) result in the recruitment of guanine
  nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as Son of Sevenless (SOS) protein to the
  cell membrane. SOS then activates RAS by facilitating the small G proteins, including
  RAS subfamily GTPases such as HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS, to dissociate from GDP and bind
  to GTP. GPT-bound RAS then activates RAF, a subfamily of MAPKKK, which phosphorylates
  MEK (MAPKK). Phosphorylated MEK in turn activates ERK (MAPK). Activated ERK enters
  the nucleus, where it phosphorylates numerous nuclear transcription factors and
  modulates gene expression, which regulates many cellular processes, including cell
  proliferation, survival, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, and metabolism. When
  NRAS gene gets mutated, the signal pathway will lose its normal regulation, which
  activates the downstream cascade resulting in the proliferation of distinctive histiocytic
  cells in cutaneous RDD.
