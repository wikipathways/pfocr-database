caption: Proposed model for attenuation of canonical TGF-β SMAD and activation of
  non-canonical TGF-β-NF-κB signaling pathways in HNSCC. TGF-β activates NF-κB signaling
  through a sequential regulation of TAK1 and IKK kinases leading to phosphorylation
  of IκBα, nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of NF-κB subunit p65 and activation
  of NF-κB downstream targets. Both TGF-β and NF-κB signaling induce expression of
  SMAD7, which in turn preferentially suppresses TGF-β induced canonical and NF-κB
  signaling, relative to TNF-α-induced NF-κB signaling.
papertitle: TGF-β and NF-κB signal pathway cross-talk is mediated through TAK1 and
  SMAD7 in a subset of head and neck cancers.
