caption: Proposed pathway for gladiostatin biosynthesis. Domain and module organization
  of the gladiostatin trans‐AT PKS showing the proposed structure of each ACP‐bound
  thioester intermediate. KS domains have been numbered sequentially, and the TransATor
  predictions for their acyl‐ACP substrates are shown in the dashed box. Modules are
  labelled M1, M2 etc. The A/B subscripts denote the predicted stereospecificity of
  KR domains. The trans‐acting ER domain (gold) of GdsB is predicted to reduce enoyl
  thioesters attached to the ACP domains in modules 5, 6, 7 and 8. Domain abbreviations
  are as defined in Figure . The putative functions of the proteins encoded by the
  gladiostatin biosynthetic gene cluster are listed in Table S3. The stereochemistry
  of C‐5 and C‐8 is hypothesised to be the same as the corresponding stereocentres
  in lactimidomycin. Comparative sequence analysis of the module 2 KR domain predicts
  that it produces an R‐configured alcohol (Table S5), consistent with this hypothesis.
