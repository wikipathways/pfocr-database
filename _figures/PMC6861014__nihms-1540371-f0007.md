caption: The top of the figure illustrates how C5aR1 signaling protects host cells
  against LM-mediated apoptosis by suppressing IFN-β expression via early as well
  as sustained inhibition of the cyclic dinucleotide-activated surveillance pathway,
  which involves DDX41, STING, as well as other intracellular protein mediators (see
  reference  for more details). Also shown in the top of the figure is how C5aR2 acts
  as a decoy receptor during LM infection by impairing to some degree C5aR1 suppression
  of IFN-β production. In the bottom part of the figure, C5aR1 and C5aR2 are depicted
  suppressing NF-KB-mediated expression of IFN-γ during the early stage of LM infection.
  Importantly, neither the C5aR2 actions as a decoy receptor nor the C5aR1/C5aR2 suppression
  of IFN-γ during the early stage of infection are able to override the overall and
  sustained host protection provided by C5aR1 impairment of IFN-β expression in this
  systemic model of LM.
