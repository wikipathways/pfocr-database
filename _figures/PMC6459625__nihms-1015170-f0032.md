caption: Signaling Cascades leading to contraction in lymphatics. Several ion channels
  affect membrane potential and allow for transient increases in intracellular free
  Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), which subsequently can activate signaling pathways that cause phasic
  and tonic contractions. Plasma membrane channels that contribute to oscillations
  in membrane potential (“Oscillators”) include T-type Ca2+ channels (Cav3.2), HCN
  channels, and CaCl channels. Voltage-gated channels that allow for rapid influx
  of Na+ and Ca2+ to generate action potentials include Nav1.3 and Cav1.2. Hyperpolarizing
  channels include KATP and BK channels. Release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
  involves IP3-receptor channels and possibly ryanodine-receptor channels. Elevations
  in [Ca2+]i allow for activation of troponins and binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin.
  Troponins facilitate brief actin-myosin interactions that cause phasic contractions.
  Ca2+-calmodulin activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), causing specific phosphorylation
  of myosin light chains (MLC) allowing for sustained interaction of myosin with actin
  and generation of tone. This pathway may be modulated by Ca2+-independent signaling
  by CPI-17 or ROCK, which inhibit the MLC phosphatase, which in turns allows for
  sustained phosphorylation of MLC.
