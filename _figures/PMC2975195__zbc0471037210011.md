caption: Schematic representation of S-SMase and L-SMase localization and metabolic
  action. In response to inflammatory cytokine challenge, the common aSMase precursor
  (pro-aSMase) is selectively shuttled away from the lysosomal pathway and toward
  the Golgi secretory pathway. Up-regulation of S-SMase in response to TNF-α or IL-1β
  is associated with a selective elevation in particular the long-chain Cer species
  (LC-Cer) (e.g. C16-Cer), which is not evident in cells overexpressing the secretion-incompetent
  S508A mutant. On the other hand, both WT and S508A aSMase exhibit elevations in
  L-SMase activity with associated increases in selective very long-chain Cer species
  (VLC-Cer) (e.g. C26:1-Cer). Ser508 is a putative phosphorylation site that may influence
  trafficking of pro-aSMase at the level of the Golgi.
