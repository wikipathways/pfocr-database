caption: Interaction between imaging agents and the blood-brain barrier. (A) The known
  transporters of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) at the
  blood brain barrier and glioma cell membrane are shown schematically. The heme biosynthetic
  pathway is shown in the glioma cell cytoplasm and mitochondrial matrix. Alterations
  in the heme biosynthesis pathway responsible for increased PpIX accumulation in
  the tumor are indicated by “low” (blue) and “high” (red) signs. Thick arrows represent
  increased rate reactions after exogenous 5-ALA administration that contribute to
  the excess PpIX accumulation. Dotted arrows represent reduced rate reactions contributing
  to PpIX accumulation. Techniques for augmenting 5-ALA-mediated PpIX accumulation
  are shown in blue bubbles and include MEK inhibition, efflux inhibitors, differentiation
  agents, iron chelators, and heme oxygenase 1 inhibitors. (B) The known transporters
  of fluorescein and (C) indocyanine green are shown similarly. Active efflux pumps
  of the ATP-binding cassette family are depicted in dark violet and solute carrier
  family transporters in pink. Alb, albumin; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ALAD, aminolevulinic

  description: Interaction between imaging agents and the blood-brain barrier. (A)
    The known transporters of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) and protoporphyrin IX
    (PpIX) at the blood brain barrier and glioma cell membrane are shown schematically.
    The heme biosynthetic pathway is shown in the glioma cell cytoplasm and mitochondrial
    matrix. Alterations in the heme biosynthesis pathway responsible for increased
    PpIX accumulation in the tumor are indicated by “low” (blue) and “high” (red)
    signs. Thick arrows represent increased rate reactions after exogenous 5-ALA administration
    that contribute to the excess PpIX accumulation. Dotted arrows represent reduced
    rate reactions contributing to PpIX accumulation. Techniques for augmenting 5-ALA-mediated
    PpIX accumulation are shown in blue bubbles and include MEK inhibition, efflux
    inhibitors, differentiation agents, iron chelators, and heme oxygenase 1 inhibitors.
    (B) The known transporters of fluorescein and (C) indocyanine green are shown
    similarly. Active efflux pumps of the ATP-binding cassette family are depicted
    in dark violet and solute carrier family transporters in pink. Alb, albumin; ABC,
