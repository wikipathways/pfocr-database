caption: Tryptophan metabolism through the kynurenine pathway. Increased indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity occurring in activated monocytes, macrophages, and
  brain microglia in conditions of immune activation catabolizes tryptophan in kynurenine.
  Tryptophan is the biosynthetic precursor for the synthesis of serotonin. By reducing
  the availability of tryptophan for serotonin synthesis, IDO activation is able to
  impair serotonin neurotransmission. Kynurenine is metabolized in different neuroactive
  glutamatergic metabolites, including 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HKyn) and quinolinic
  acid that are produced by activated microglia, and kynurenic acid produced by astrocytes.
  Elevated levels of quinolinic acid are neurotoxic by activating glutamatergic NMDA
  receptors and promoting oxidative stress. High concentrations of kynurenic acid
  can be neuroprotective by antagonizing NMDA receptors, but sustained microglia activation
  rather promotes increased neurotoxicity. KAT, kynurenine aminotransferase; KMO,
  kynurenine monooxygenase; 3-HAO, 3-hyrdoxyanthranilic acid oxygenase; TPH, tryptophan
  hydroxylase.
