caption: 'Expression patterns of DEGs related to branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway
  in tepals and coronas of Narcissus during flower development. Branches of the phenylpropanoid
  pathway in Narcissus and expression patterns analysis of DEGs, are related to flavonoids
  metabolic pathway and benzenoid/phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway. The red line
  and arrowhead in the left panel represent the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway,
  and the black line and arrowhead represent the flavonoid/anthocyanin biosynthesis
  pathway. The heat map shows the expression patterns of differentially expressed
  structural genes related to branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway in the tepals
  and coronas at different periods (left down). Each row means one unigene and the
  expression changes of unigenes are shown by color grids based on FPKM value (fragments
  per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped). The color bar from blue to orange
  shows upregulated; from orange to blue is downregulated. Enzyme names are shown
  in the gray background circle. 4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; KAT, 3-ketoacyl-CoA
  thiolase; C4H, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase; AOC3, amine oxidase, copper containing
