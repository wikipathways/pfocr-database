caption: The main pathway of platinum functioning as an antitumor agent. Apoptosis
  is a terminal event in chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Platinum enters cancer cells
  by passive diffusion or transport proteins and then undergoes reactions to form
  structures that facilitate its binding to DNA, forming DNA adducts, which activate
  several pathways and eventually induce mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis.
