caption: 'Various T cell subsets development with metabolic reprogramming status.
  There are five metabolic profile categories: the pentose phosphate pathway, glutaminolysis,
  aerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO). Different T cell subsets alter their metabolic status at different developmental
  stages. Double negative (DN) cells are the initial stage of thymocytes. These cells
  will mainly use aerobic glycolysis during proliferation. In later stages of thymocyte
  development, double-positive (DP) cells and single CD4 or CD8 T cells mature and
  prepare to migrate through the bloodstream to the secondary organs. During this
  stage, the matured thymocytes preferentially utilize OXPHOS and FAO to meet their
  metabolic needs. Naive T cells in spleens and LNs continue in quiescence as thymocytes
  to minimize energy consumption. Once encountering antigens, T cells activate and
  proliferate to face foreign assailants. In order to combat foreign pathogens, effector
  T cells transition their metabolism from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis. T cells will
  progress into the differentiation stage where there are multiple T-cell subsets,
  such as T helper 1 (Th1), T helper 2 (Th2), T helper 9 (Th9), T helper 17 (Th17),
  regulatory T (Treg), and T follicular B helper (Tfh) cells. Although all T cell
  subsets utilize aerobic glycolysis, the varying subsets employ different metabolic
  processes. Th17 can utilize glutaminolysis and both Th1 and Tfh can conduct OXPHOS
  in addition to aerobic glycolysis. Memory T cells exhibited both OXPHOS and FAO
  to maintain their function.'
