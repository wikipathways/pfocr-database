caption: Metabolic regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impact on stem
  cell fate. Stem cells ensure genomic stability through minimizing stress generating
  molecules and maintaining high activity of stress defense mechanisms. This is partially
  accomplished by maintaining a glycolytic state, which supports stem cell maintenance
  through a lower reliance on oxidative metabolism, enabling a lower mitochondria
  mass, oxygen consumption, and oxidative stress generation, while supporting flux
  through the pentose phosphate pathway to facilitate NADPH formation and maintenance
  of antioxidant defenses. On differentiation cues, intracellular ROS levels increase
  and are required for differentiation into specific lineages. ROS may accumulate
  due to an increase in ROS generation, as well as a reduction in antioxidant defense,
  which may be partially due to a significant remodeling of the metabolic infrastructure,
  including an increase in mitochondrial mass, maturity, and intracellular networks
  to support a greater reliance on oxidative metabolism and an increase in ROS generation,
  while reducing the antioxidant supportive role of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate
  pathway.
