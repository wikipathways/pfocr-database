caption: Proposed mechanisms through which pregnancy alters choline metabolism based
  on the isotopic enrichment of choline metabolites after oral consumption of d9-choline
  by pregnant and nonpregnant women. Pregnancy increases the use of orally consumed
  choline for PC synthesis through the CDP-choline and PEMT pathways. Pregnancy also
  increases the use of betaine for methionine synthesis and the hydrolysis of PEMT-PC
  to free choline. The reduced production of betaine from orally consumed choline
  (due to its increased use by the CDP-choline pathway), along with enhanced use of
  betaine as a methyl donor, may contribute to its depletion during the last trimester
  of human pregnancy. The increase in circulating free choline during this timeframe
  may stem from greater degradation of PEMT-PC. Thin arrows indicate that metabolic
  flux did not differ or was not compared between pregnant and nonpregnant women.
  Thick arrows indicate that metabolic flux was enhanced in third-trimester pregnant
  compared with nonpregnant women. The dashed arrow indicates that metabolic flux
  was attenuated in third-trimester pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. CDP-choline,
