caption: 'Translation initiation is controlled by the abundance of the eIF2· GTP·
  Met-tRNAi ternary complex (1). The ternary complex and the 40S ribosome scan along
  mRNAs until AUG start codon recognition (2). GTP hydrolysis releases eIF2 and other
  initiation factors from the mRNA-40S-complex (3), allowing the 60S ribosomal subunit
  to bind and proceed to elongation (4). The guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B
  catalyzes the GTP exchange to recycle the ternary complex ensuring further rounds
  of translation initiation. Several stimuli (ER and mitochondrial stress, heme deprivation,
  viral infection, and amino acid starvation) activate the eIF2 kinases PERK, HRI,
  PKR and GCN2, respectively, leading to eIF2α phosphorylation at Ser51 (5). p-eIF2
  inhibits its own activator eIF2B, leading to ternary complex depletion, decreasing
  cap-dependent translation an elevating the selective translation of uORF regulated
  genes, such as ATF4 (6). ISR termination is accomplished by the dephosphorylation
  of p-eIF2α by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complexed with either the constitutively
  expressed CReP or the ISR-inducible GADD34 regulatory subunits. Pharmacological
  modulation of the ISR occurs at different levels: ISR activators (in green boxes)
  target the PP1:CReP complex or HRI while ISR inhibitors (in red boxes) target eIF2B,
  GCN2 or PERK.'
