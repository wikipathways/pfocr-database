caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of EV-associated DAMPs-mediated neuroinflammation.
  (1) After an oxidative stimulus, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  lead to generation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs). The process of MDV
  production can result in delivering oxidised proteins to peroxisome/lysosome degradation
  or routing them to the multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which will be released as extracellular
  vesicles (EVs). Several mitochondrial components can be released within MDVs, including
  mtDNA, cardiolipin, cytochrome C, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and
  N-formyl peptides, which are considered as mitochondrial damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs). (2) Mitochondrial DAMPs in EVs can initiate a microglia pro-inflammatory
  immune response by inducing a conformational change from a normal ramified morphology
  (resting) to an ameboid form (activated). (3) Mitochondrial DAMPs interact with
  pattern recognition receptors that include the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family (TLR1
  to TLR10). MtDNA can activate a neuroinflammatory response by triggering interferon
  genes, TLR9 (membrane of the endosome) and the NLRP3 inflammasome. MtDNA can elicit
  a downstream signalling cascade which activates MAPK and the nuclear transcription
  factor NF-κB. MtDNA can also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and through the caspase-1
  activation promote the expression of IL-18 and IL-1β. (4) MtDNA is also detected
  by cGAS, that further binds to STING activating TBK1. The activation of TBK1 leads
  to IRF3 phosphorylation, translocation into the nucleus and consequent induction
  of various IFN-stimulated genes. TBK1 also activates the NF-κB signalling pathway,
  thus increasing the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α, contributing to chronic neuroinflammation
  and accelerating neuron degeneration. Abbreviations: ATP—adenosine triphosphate;
