caption: '(A) B7 family members: CTLA-4, ICOS, ICOSL, PD-1, PD-L-1 and PD-L2. CTLA-4
  competes with CD28 for binding to their counter-receptors CD80 and CD86 and attenuates
  TCR signalling induced during Ag recognition. In addition, the engagement of CTLA-4
  induces IDO expression on APC, reinforcing its immunoregulatory effect. PD-1 signalling
  induced by its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) expressed on APC also counteracts TCR activation,
  inhibiting early proximal signalling events. Also, PD-1 can interact with PD-L1
  expressed in peripheral tissues contributing to peripheral tolerance. ICOS/ICOSL
  pathway regulates T-cell tolerance through the control of IL-10-producing Tregs.
  (B) Signalling pathways influenced by CD69 and Gal-1. CD69 is early induced following
  TCR activation. The engagement of CD69 by as yet an unknown ligand activates Jak3-STAT5
  pathway promoting Treg differentiation and Th17 inhibition. Gal-1 can be found on
  the membrane surface linked to glycoreceptors inducing apoptosis of Th1 and Th17
  cells and promoting IL-10 production. Both molecules facilitate Treg function. Green
  plus symbols indicate tolerogenic signals.'
