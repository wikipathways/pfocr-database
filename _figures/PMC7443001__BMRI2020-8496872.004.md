caption: 'Interactions among 38 DEGs involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. In this
  PPI network, proteins were represented as nodes and the interactions between two
  proteins denoted as edges. Active interaction sources: textmining, experiments,
  databases, coexpression, neighborhood, gene fusion, and cooccurrence. The thickness
  of the line connecting two genes indicates the strength of the data support.'
