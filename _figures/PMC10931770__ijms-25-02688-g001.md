caption: T cells, B cells, and osteoclasts in the immune machinery in RA. This figure
  illustrates the role of T cells, B cells, and osteoclasts in the immune machinery
  of RA. Activated T cells and B cells secrete pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1β,
  IL-6, and TNF-α, among others. In the inflammatory microenvironment of RA joints,
  these cytokines promote the differentiation of FLS into tissue-damaging FLS and
  the release of RANKL—the primary factor promoting the generation of osteoclasts.
  Furthermore, T cells and B cells also contribute to the secretion of RANKL. Upon
  the junction of RANKL with RANK on the osteoclast precursors, a cascade of pathways
  will induce the differentiation of osteoclasts, leading to their maturation and
  ultimately contributing to bone erosion
