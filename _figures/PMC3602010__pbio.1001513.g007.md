caption: In red are the steps whose activity has been demonstrated in this work by
  genetic approaches. Downstream of biotic stimuli (Pst or flg22), both MPK3 and MPK6
  are required to activate production of LOX1-dependent oxylipins such as FAHs (9-HPOD(T)E)
  and/or reactive ketones (9-KOD(T)E). Our pharmacological data strongly suggest that
  the latter compounds modulate the activity of putative thiol-containing targets
  responsible for biotic signal transduction. Downstream of this step, SA is required
  to convey the biotic stress signal. In a COI1-dependent manner, COR inhibits the
  accumulation of SA through the activity of three NAC transcription factors and orchestrates
  the stomatal reopening . On the other hand, the ABA-dependent pathway that is triggered
  upon abiotic stress requires the protein kinases OST1 and MPK9 or MPK12. As one
  of the final effectors required for the regulation of osmotic pressure in guard
  cells, activation of the slow-type anion channel SLAC1 is necessary for stomatal
  closure in response to both biotic stress and ABA. Not depicted in this model are
  the data provided by this work and supporting the involvement of ABA in the guard
  cell potentiation required for optimizing responses to biotic stress.
