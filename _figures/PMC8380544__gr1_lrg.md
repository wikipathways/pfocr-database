caption: Retinoic acid signaling orchestrates innate and adaptive immune responses
  to viral infections. Extracellular and intra-vesicular viruses are recognized through
  TLR receptors activating the TRAF/IRF signaling cascade. After the viral genome
  is taken into the cell, the immune response switches to the RIG-I and MDA5 further
  activating TRAF/IRF pathway. Activated TRAF/IRF leads to Type I IFN synthesis (green
  arrows, center). RIG-I is synthesized through RAR/RXR (blue arrows, left side) as
  long as there is sufficient retinoid signaling in the cell, and type I interferon
  synthesis continues through RIG-I and TLR system (green arrows, center). TRAF can
  also activate IKK leading to degradation of I-κB and activation of NF-κB. In addition,
  the MAPK, PI3K/Akt and Jak/STAT pathways are also under the control of non-genomic
  signaling of retinoic acids. Here, non-genomic signaling cascades are modulated
  by STRA6 and membrane-associated RARs via RA recruitment, leading to activation
  or inactivation of NF-B (red arrows, right side). Here, the association of RA with
  CRABP-1 inhibits tonic MAPK, PI3K/Akt and Jak/STAT signaling. RA activates RIG-I
  expression (black dotted arrows) and inhibits cytokine feed-forward loop and UPS
  system (blunt-ended dotted black lines) preventing NF-кB activation through UPS.
  With retinol depletion, the RIG-I arm of the innate immune system that produces
  Type I interferon collapses (green arrows, center), but the UPS-NF-κB pathway continues
  operating through TLR receptors releasing cytokines and other inflammatory mediators
  (red arrows, right side). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
