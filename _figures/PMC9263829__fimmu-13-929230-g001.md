caption: The role of the NF-κB signaling pathway in dry eye. Hyperosmotic stress induces
  the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which induces the releases of proinflammatory
  cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules, and activates antigen-presenting cells
  and CD4+ T cells. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF-α)
  and chemokines (MCP-1, IL-18, CXCL10) can lead to inflammatory responses and goblet
  cell loss. Chemokines and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MMPs) can induce T
  cell migration and corneal barrier disruption. CD4+ T cells could be differentiated
  into T help cells (TH1 and TH17), which then release IL-17 and IFN-γ, leading to
  tear secretion reduction, corneal epithelial damage, and goblet cell decrease. NF‐κB
  inhibitors, including pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and sulphasalazine, show therapeutic
  potential in dry eye by inhibiting NF‐κB activation.
