caption: Polyprenyl diphosphate synthases, Coq1p (S. cerevisiae) and IspB (E. coli),
  catalyze the formation of the isoprenoid tail. The tail lengths among different
  organisms vary and are specified by the specific polyprenyl diphosphate synthase
  enzyme present. For example, S. cerevisiae synthesize Q6, bearing six isoprene units,
  and E. coli produce Q8. In S. cerevisiae, the isoprene tail is attached to 4-hydroxybenzoic
  acid (4-HB) by Coq2p to form 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (HP6B); in E. coli,
  UbiA catalyzes this reaction to form 4-hydroxy-3-octaprenyl-benzoate (HP8B). At
  this point the pathways are proposed to diverge between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
  E. coli genes products are identified as Ubi (and include IspB) and S. cerevisiae
  gene products are identified as COQ.
