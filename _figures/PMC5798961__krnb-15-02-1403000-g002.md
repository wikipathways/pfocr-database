caption: 'Known and speculative activity of tRFs. A. tRFs are known to act at two
  different levels: First, tRFs loaded into argonaute (AGO) can induce RNAi on targets
  mRNAs and potentially induce the initiation of secondary sRNA production. At the
  same time, degradation of tRNAs to tRFs inhibits the translation of mRNAs through
  a pathway yet to be identified. Translation inhibition could also take place due
  to degradation of mature tRNAs into tRFs and potential lack of mature tRNAs. B.
  Interaction of tRFs with the replication cycle of retrotransposons. tRFs loaded
  into AGO proteins are known to target retrotransposons and induce the production
  of secondary sRNAs from their RNA transcripts. At the same time, lack of mature
  tRNAs can inhibit translation of retrotransposon proteins and prevent reverse transcription.
  C. Proposed mechanisms linking TE reactivation and tRF biogenesis. Left panel: During
  strong epigenetic reprogramming, erasure of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 leads to TE reactivation
  and excessive tRNA production. Excessive tRNA pool could be incorporated into RNAi
  and induce the production of tRFs. Right panel: Spurious reactivation of TE transcription
  can lead to an anomalous usage of the tRNA pool that if sensed by the cell can lead
  to angiogenin delocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This could lead
  to increased degradation of tRNAs into tRNA halves or direct tRF production. * Seconday
  RNAi will only take place in organisms with RdRPs like plants, fungi and invertebrate
  animals.'
