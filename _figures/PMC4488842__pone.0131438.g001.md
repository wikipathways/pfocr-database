caption: 'Infections are stratified by smear, drug sensitivity, HIV co-infection and
  history of previous treatment. TB care stages (diagnosis and treatment) are stratified
  by public and private sectors. ‘FL’ and ‘SL’ denote first- and second-line treatment,
  respectively. Outgoing dashed lines indicate the loss of patients from the care
  seeking pathway. These patients reenter the care seeking pathway after a given delay,
  represented by the incoming dashed line at top right. The red lines indicate the
  effects of Xpert: that is, to bypass the interval for suspecting and testing for
  MDR-TB, and to enable wider uptake of upfront drug sensitivity testing. Individuals
  who are cured are assumed to be non-infectious until death, relapse or reinfection.
  In the latter two cases, they re-enter the infected, pre-care seeking compartment.'
