caption: 'Transfection with GAB increases the sensitivity of GBM cell lines T98G,
  U87MG, and LN229 to H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Upon H2O2 treatment, the GAB-transfected
  cells of all three cell lines present decreased levels of phosphorylated PI3K and
  PDK1 compared to the pcDNA-transfected counterparts. Hypothetically, changes in
  the activity of the PI3K signaling cascade may ensue modulation of RTKs by GAB,
  but experimental evidence to support this notion is absent. GAB-transfected T98G
  and U87MG cells display decreased AKT phosphorylation on both Thr308 and Ser473,
  reduced NF-κB phosphorylation, and increased activity of caspase 3 and 7, suggesting
  that caspase dependent apoptosis contributes to their death. By contrast, in the
  LN229 cell line, the lack of changes in the phosphorylation level of NF-κB and in
  caspase 3 and 7 activities indicates that the mechanism underlying GAB-mediated
  death is other than caspase dependent apoptosis. Note that in contrast to GAB-transfected
  T98G and U87MG cells, GAB-transfected LN229 cells present increased AKT phosphorylation
  on Ser473: The implications (if any) of this difference for the nature of cell death
  are not known.'
