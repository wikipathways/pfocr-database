caption: TTP–HuR pathway cascade following miR-29a inhibition. Inhibition of miR-29a
  relieves post-transcriptional repression of TTP; more TTP is produced that binds
  to and destabilizes HuR mRNA and other pro-cancer mRNAs. As a result, a normalized
  TTP–HuR balance is created, leading to enhanced ARE mRNA instability for factors
  involved in invasion and migration, such as uPA, MMP-1 and MMP-13 and a reduction
  in migration and invasion.
