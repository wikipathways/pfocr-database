caption: '(A) A generalized core model of yeast glycolysis [] considers the intracellular
  concentrations of the glycolytic intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), ATP
  and inorganic phosphate (Pi), and four reactions (arrows): (i) a lumped upper glycolysis
  reaction that produces FBP from extracellular glucose with rate vup, (ii) a lumped
  lower glycolysis reaction that generates ATP and the waste product ethanol (EtOH)
  at rate vlo, (iii) ATPase reaction reflecting general ATP demand in the cell at
  rate vatp, and (iv) reversible phosphate transport between the cytosol and the vacuole
  at rate vp. PolyP refers to the vacuolar store of polyphosphate. (B) The flux through
  the ATPase reaction vatp and the associated cell growth rate can be visualized by
  water flow through a tank with two outlets. vatp is coupled to cell growth in a
  way that allows a cell to survive and recover from limited periods of negative energy
  balance (e.g., during metabolic imbalance or starvation). The coupling is mediated
  via cellular reserves, quantified by a variable H (cell health, depicted by the
  water level in the tank). A cell grows (increases in volume) when its health H is
  at the maximal value and vatp is larger than obligatory cellular maintenance cost
  vatp,c. When vatp is not sufficient to cover cellular maintenance cost, cell health
  decreases. The cell dies if its health drops to zero.'
