caption: Pathway regulating metastasis by folate. Rho GTPases anchored in ER membrane
  through a prenyl group undergo methylation at the C-terminal cysteine by isoprenylcysteine
  carboxylmethyltransferase enzyme. This process depends on folate, which provides
  methyl groups (Met) for the reaction through methionine and S-adenosylmethionine
  biosynthesis. Methylation enables the extraction of GTPases by GDIs from ER membrane
  and its translocation to plasma membrane upon GTP loading. The GTP/GDP exchange
  in response to stimuli activates a cascade, which includes subsequent phosphorylation
  (p) of PAK, LIMK, and cofilin (Cof). The balance between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated
  cofilin regulates the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton (G/F-actin cycling) responsible
  for cellular migration and invasion, key processes in metastasis.
