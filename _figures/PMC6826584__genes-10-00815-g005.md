caption: Notch signaling pathway by ubiqutination upon binding of Jagged/Delta (JAG/DLL)
  ligands to the Notch receptor (N1); the endocytic system is activated in the ligand-bearing
  cell. This leads to two sequential proteolytic events. The first is metalloproteinase-dependent
  (ADAM10/17) and it releases the extracellular domain of the Notch receptor which
  is afterward engulfed via transendocytosis. The second proteolytic cleavage is membrane
  bound and dependent on γ-secretase activity. After this step, NICD (the Notch intracellular
  part) is released to the cytosol and transported to the nucleus where it interacts
  with the CSL/RBP-Jκ transcription factor and its co-factor Mastermind (MAML1). The
  complex is tethered to promoters of Notch target genes. For details see the text.
