caption: Five metabolites were highly significant across this pathway, p < 0.0001(indicated
  by solid boxes with blue shading). Glutamine was also significant, p < 0.001, dotted
  box. Alanine was not significantly different. Metabolites in small text with no
  borders were not detected by 1H-MRS methods. This pathway is a modified metabolic
  pathway from KEGG database.
