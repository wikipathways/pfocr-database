caption: ATM canonical signaling pathway in DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest and
  apoptosis. In normal situations, ATM are often inert and form homodimers or polymers.
  However, when DNA damage occurs, ATM is quickly activated and disassociates into
  highly active monomers. ATM initiates the DNA-damage response through co-signaling
  with the MRN (Mre11/Rad50/NBS1) complex at the DNA lesion sites. In fact, direct
  interaction with the MRN complex induces ATM to phosphorylate a number of downstream
  targets that are essential for DNA damage repair, cell cycle checkpoint, cell cycle
  arrest, and apoptosis. During this process, ATM undergoes a series of autophosphorylation
  on Ser367, Ser1893, Ser1981, and Ser2996 as well as acetylation on Lys3016. Activated
  ATM is recruited to the DNA damage sites for starting the DNA-damage response. ATM
  activates BRCA1 and ATF2 to promote cascades of DNA damage repair signaling pathways
  that involve hundreds of sensors, transducers, and effectors. In addition, ATM also
  turns on and stabilizes p53 via direct phosphorylation. ATM additionally phosphorylates
  MDMX to induce its degradation, thereby further stabilizing p53. To its turn, p53
  translocates into the nucleus to transactivate a series of its downstream tumor
  suppressor target genes. For instance, p53 enhances the expression of p21, a potent
  cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. p21 associates with cyclin E, CDK2, CDK4/6 and
  induces G1/S and G2/M cell cycle arrest, which is critical to prevent unrepaired
  DNA mutations from passing into daughter cells. p53 also directly transactivates
  Bid, Bax, PUMA to induce apoptosis when DNA damage is too severe for effective repair.
  This programmed cell death is a major mechanism of tumor suppression. Moreover,
  ATM activates RAD9A to further promote cell cycle checkpoints. CHK1 and CHK2 are
  additionally induced by ATM through phosphorylation. CHK1 subsequently inhibits
  TLK1 while CHK2 turns on the cell cycle inhibitor CDC25A to block CDK2. As a result,
  cell cycle progression is temporarily halted to enable DNA damage repair. Thus,
  thanks to its central role in coordinating DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest,
  cell cycle checkpoint, and apoptosis, ATM is frequently considered a major tumor
  suppressor whose mutations often lead to significant increase in risk of cancer.
