caption: TRBP in the exogenous and endogenous RNAi pathways. (A) Exogenous pathway
  mediated by siRNAs and shRNAs. Perfectly matched dsRNAs are bound by Dicer and TRBP
  and cleaved by Dicer to form 21- to 23-nucleotide (nt) siRNAs. The complex then
  recruits Ago2 and forms the RISC. After strand separation, the complex hybridizes
  to the complementary sequence in an mRNA. Ago2 mediates the cleavage of the mRNA.
  (B) Endogenous pathway mediated by miRNAs. Primary mRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are synthesized
  in the nucleus. They are bound by Drosha and DGCR8. Drosha cleaves them to form
  the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is an imperfectly matched dsRNA. Pre-miRNAs
  are exported to the cytoplasm via exportin5 (Exp5), where they are bound by TRBP
  and Dicer. Dicer cleaves them to form miRNAs. The RISC is then formed with Ago2.
  After strand separation, one miRNA strand targets the corresponding mRNA. The translation
  of this mRNA is generally repressed by a process that involves the recruitment of
  additional factors and the formation of processing bodies, but in some cases, cleavage
  of the target mRNA may occur (dotted arrow).
