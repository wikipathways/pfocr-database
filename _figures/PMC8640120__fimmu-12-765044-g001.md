caption: Map of IgA class switching through both TD and TI reaction in the gut. This
  TD pathway involves a cognate interaction of follicular B cells with antigen-activated
  CD4+ T cells, including TH2 cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, and T follicular helper
  (TFH) cells (, ). First, Dendritic cells (DCs) in the subepithelial dome (SED) of
  the PP capture and present antigen to follicular CD4+ T cells, thereby inducing
  them to differentiate into effector T cells releasing IgA-inducing cytokines. These
  T cells also interact with antigen-specific IgM+IgD+ naive B cells. Together with
  follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), this interaction fosters a proliferation, differentiation,
  somatic hypermutation (SHM) and IgA class-switch recombination (CSR) of B cells
  in germinal center. Ultimately, TD pathway leads to the emergence of long-lived
  memory B cells and plasma cells that release high-affinity IgA antibodies in the
  lamina propria (). In addition, commensals trigger multiple Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) to stimulate FDC, DC and stromal cells release of BAFF, APRIL, TGFβ and other
  IgA-inducing cytokines, thereby triggering direct IgA CSR in lamina propria IgM+
  B cells in a T-cell-independent manner (, ).
