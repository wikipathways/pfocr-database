caption: Metabolic pathways of importance for the developing brain. Glycolysis, oxidative
  phosphorylation via the citric acid (TCA) cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway
  generating NADPH, and the use of ketone bodies as supplemental fuel are shown. The
  connections between glycolysis, complex carbohydrate, amino acid, protein, lipid,
  and nucleotide synthesis are also illustrated. The pathway fluxes that change during
  brain development to cause glucose utilization in excess of oxygen (enhanced non-oxidative
  metabolism of glucose) are not known. Glucose can be converted to lactate directly
  via the glycolytic pathway or after shunting through glycogen or the pentose shunt
  pathway, then either oxidized in the mitochondria or released from brain. Our diagram
  shows two pathways for mitochondrial lactate oxidation, direct lactate transport
  into the mitochondria and oxidation as has been reported in studies of muscle and
  brain (Brooks, , , ; Schurr, ; Passarella et al., ; Rogatzki et al., ) and conversion
  of lactate to pyruvate in the cytosol by cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (cLDH)
  and subsequent transport into inner matrix of the mitochondria through pyruvate
  transporters. Although in muscle it has been reported that the large majority of
  lactate is directly oxidized in the mitochondria by mitochondrial LDH (mLDH), the
  effective blocking of glucose oxidation in brain cell cultures, synaptosomes, and
  brain slices by inhibition of the malate aspartate shuttle (MAS) (which transports
  the redox equivalent from NADH produced by cLDH into the mitochondria) (Fitzpatrick
  et al., ; Kauppinen et al., ; Cheeseman and Clark, ; Mckenna et al., ) and the inability
  of L-lactate to rescue glutamate toxicity in MAS-knockout neurons whereas it does
  in wild type (Llorente-Folch et al., ) suggests that brain mitochondria mainly use
  cytosolic pyruvate as an oxidative source. Also, LDH is considered to be a cytoplasmic
  marker in subcellular fractionation studies of brain (Johnson and Whittaker, ; Tamir
  et al., ), and <1% of the LDH in a brain homogenate is recovered in purified mitochondria
  (Lai and Clark, ; Lai et al., ). However, from the standpoint of this study the
  two pathways of lactate oxidation would lead to the same OGI as shown in Figure
  . Glucose can also be used for synthesis of glycogen, amino acids, proteins, complex
  carbohydrates, lipids, glycolipids, and glycoproteins, and nucleotides. The flux
  of the pentose shunt in developing brain is higher than in adult brain even though
  maximal capacity is similar at all ages (Baquer et al., ). The illustration is based
  metabolic pathways active in proliferative cells to explain the Warburg effect that
  involves aerobic glycolysis and lactate efflux (Vander Heiden et al., ). Warburg
  theories for cancer cells state that the increased glucose uptake is shunted through
  the pentose phosphate pathway for the additional NADPH needed for biosynthetic reactions.
  Theoretically, 5/6 of the glucose entering the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate
  pathway should end up as lactate and be exported from the brain. However, if recycling
  of Fru-6-P back into the pentose shunt is complete, this pathway can contribute
  a higher fraction to the consumption of glucose in excess of oxygen (see text).
  It is an open question how much NADPH is needed to meet the biosynthetic needs for
  synaptogenesis. CoA, Coenzyme A; P, phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-P2; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
