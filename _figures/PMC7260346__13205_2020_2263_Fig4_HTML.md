caption: KEGG pathway map showing metabolites and differentially expressed key genes
  identified in the “Terpenoid Backbone Biosynthesis” pathway. The fully shaded red
  boxes represent gene transcripts with high expression in roots of P. zeylanica.
  The green-colored boxes indicate transcripts with relatively higher expression in
  leaf of P. zeylanica. The red-colored column also indicates the biosynthesis of
  specific metabolic compounds at high level. This color-coded map corresponds to
  map00900 in the KEGG database
