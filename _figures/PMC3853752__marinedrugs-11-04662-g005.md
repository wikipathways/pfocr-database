caption: 'Overview of FA and LC-PUFA synthesis in P. tricornutum. Shown are the hypothetical

  at the sn-1 and sn-2 position of glycosylglycerides (in plastid or Kennedy pathway
  in ER). Purple: Long chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetases (LACS), lysophospholipid
  acyltransferases (LPLAT), acyl-CoA:glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and
  acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidic acyltransferase (LPAAT), phosphatidic acid phosphatase
  (PAP), elongases (Elo) and desaturases (ΔD or ωD); Red: putative genes, enzymes
  encoded by genes that have been identified are marked in bold. The other genes are
  predicted for EPA synthesis from transcriptional data. The co-factors for the desaturases
  are not indicated. At the ER, the FA are available as acyl-CoA or linked to a glycerol-backbone
  such as PC indicated by . MGDG is indicated by a glycerol-backbone with a framed
  G. Before and after elongation, the FA has to be de-linking and re-linking from
  the glycerol-backbone indicated with two consecutive arrows.Question marks indicate
  that the reaction and the involved enzymes are not predicted. Modified after [,].'
