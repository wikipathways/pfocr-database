caption: '(A) MAPK heat diffusion sub-network: pathway extracted from the TieDIE subnetwork
  using heat diffusion analysis from the MAPK1 network node. (B) p53 heat diffusion
  sub-network: pathway extracted from the TieDIE solution network using heat diffusion
  analysis from the TP53 network node. Each node indicates a pathway protein shown
  as concentric rings. The inner node denotes differential mRNA expression (Benjamini-Hochberg
  adjusted p < 0.05) bias for genes when comparing the QM-PDAC subtype tumours to
  those of the other PDAC subtypes (red = QM-PDAC bias, blue = bias towards other
  subtypes). The second ring indicates the presence of genomic alterations for that
  gene in each patient’s tumour, with each patient’s tumour being denoted by a spoke
  within the ring. The third ring shows mRNA expression levels for each tumour sample
  (red = high, blue = low). The outer ring indicates the PARADIGM inferred pathway
  activity for that protein in each tumour sample (red = high, blue = low). Arrows
  indicate known protein-protein interactions extracted from UCSC Super pathway, KEA,
  ChEA or inferred from the literature. We have attempted to make the visualisation
  clearer by omitting some interactions between some network nodes.'
