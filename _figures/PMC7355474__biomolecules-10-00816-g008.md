caption: The graphical representation to elaborate on the possible mechanism underlying
  antioxidative and anti-inflammatory potential of A3 against the p-MCAO-induced brain
  injury. A3 causes Nrf2 activation and suppresses oxidative damage as indicated by
  elevated GST and GSH and reduced NO eventually leading to neuroprotection. ATRA
  blocks Nrf2 activation thereby leading to inhibition of endogenous antioxidative
  capacity. The majority of ROS and RNS are the products of oxygen metabolism in mitochondria.
  The superoxide anion produced is exported to the cytosol, and in the attempt to
  reduce the toxicity, some more reactive species are generated. These reactive species
  then cause degradation of DNA, lipids, and proteins. Under such conditions, the
  antioxidant response system (ARS) becomes activated to balance redox status. In
  our body, Nrf2 acts as a master regulator and is activated in response to stress
  via two mechanisms; a kinase-independent mechanism where reactive specie directly
  oxidize or nitrosylate the keap 1, a cysteine-rich protein that is bound to Nrf2
  and thus releasing Nrf2. The other mechanism is kinase-dependent degradation, where
  a stressor such as glutamate, through activation of the Gq pathway, phosphorylate
  Nrf2. As a result, Nrf2 is transported into the nucleus where it displaces Bach1,
  a transcriptional repressor of ARE (antioxidant response elements), and heterodimerize
  with Maf and bind to ARE on DNA, eventually triggering transcriptional factors for
  NQO1, HO-1, and GST, thus increasing cellular defense against redox-modulators.
