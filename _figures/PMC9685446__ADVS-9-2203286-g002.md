caption: Summarizing schematic illustration of fatty liver/adipose tissue dual‐targeting
  PBP‐NPs containing HO‐1 inducers for the treatment of obesity, obesity‐induced type
  2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. a) PBP‐NPs target adipocytes and induce
  brown adipogenesis via the SIRT1 pathway. Activated brown adipocytes accelerate
  mitochondrial biogenesis and turned fatty acids into energy. b) PBP‐NPs also switch
  inflammatory cytokines secreting M1 macrophages into anti‐inflammatory M2 via AMPK
  signaling. c) PBP‐NPs target the fatty liver to inhibit fatty acids storage by FASN
  and SREBP1c downregulation and ameliorate hepatic steatosis. d) HO‐1 expression
  also switches M1 Kupffer cells into M2 Kupffer cells to stop secreting inflammatory
  cytokines and activating hepatic stellate cells. e) Circulatory lipids and cytokines
  from obese adipose tissue are significantly reduced by PBP‐NPs and synergistically
  reduce hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. The figure was created with
  BioRender.com.
