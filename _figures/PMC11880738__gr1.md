caption: Mechanisms responsible for copper uptake and homeostasis in cells. The transport
  of Cu + into the cytoplasm following the reduction stage of Cu2+ to Cu+ by members
  of the six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate (STEAP) family of proteins
  occurs via copper transporters (CTR). Intracellularly, Cu+ is passed on to copper
  chaperones, such as copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase 1 (CCS1), nonproteinaceous
  low-molecular-weight copper ligand (CuL), and antioxidant 1 copper chaperone (ATOX1).
  Cytoplasmic Cu+ can also be sequestered by glutathione (GSH) and metallothioneins
  (MTs). CuL transports copper into the mitochondrial matrix via solute carrier family
  25 member 3 (SLC25A3), which is located within the inner membrane of the mitochondria.
  Cu+ is used for the metalation of complex IV of the oxidative chain (cytochrome
  c oxidase, COX), which requires the contribution of the copper chaperone of cytochrome
  c oxidase 17 (COX17), the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 1/2 (SCO1/2) and the
  copper chaperone of cytochrome c oxidase 11 (COX11). ATOX1 can mediate the metalation
  of cuproenzymes within the secretory pathway, as it delivers Cu+ to copper-transporting
  ATPase alpha (ATP7A) and copper-transporting ATPase beta (ATP7B), which are located
  in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). ATP7A and ATP7B can subsequently also mediate
  copper efflux from the cell. CCS1 is involved in the activation of superoxide dismutase
  1 (SOD1), which catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radicals to oxygen and hydrogen
  peroxide

  description: Mechanisms responsible for copper uptake and homeostasis in cells.
    The transport of Cu + into the cytoplasm following the reduction stage of Cu2+
    to Cu+ by members of the six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate (STEAP)
    family of proteins occurs via copper transporters (CTR). Intracellularly, Cu+
    is passed on to copper chaperones, such as copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase
    1 (CCS1), nonproteinaceous low-molecular-weight copper ligand (CuL), and antioxidant
    1 copper chaperone (ATOX1). Cytoplasmic Cu+ can also be sequestered by glutathione
    (GSH) and metallothioneins (MTs). CuL transports copper into the mitochondrial
    matrix via solute carrier family 25 member 3 (SLC25A3), which is located within
    the inner membrane of the mitochondria. Cu+ is used for the metalation of complex
    IV of the oxidative chain (cytochrome c oxidase, COX), which requires the contribution
    of the copper chaperone of cytochrome c oxidase 17 (COX17), the synthesis of cytochrome
