caption: Proposed metabolic pathway demonstrating the dual oxidase/reductase activity
  of ECAKR4-1 involved in glyphosate metabolism in E. colona. Glyphosate is oxidized
  to AMPA by EcAKR4-1 using NADP+ as a cofactor, and meanwhile cinnamaldehyde is reduced
  to cinnamyl alcohol, regenerating NADP+. Glyoxylate produced by glyphosate oxidation
  is further converted to Gly by transaminase coupled with l-Glu oxidation  to 2-oxoglutarate.
  “X” indicates cleavage of the C-N bond in the glyphosate molecule. Please note that
  our structural modeling (), in vitro glyphosate metabolism by E. coli–expressed
  EcAKR4-1 (), and metabolomics of EcAKR4-1 transgenic rice () are consistent with
  the proposed step for glyphosate conversion to AMPA. Further conversion of glyoxylate
  to Gly was only based on the metabolomic analysis of EcAKR4-1 transgenic rice ().
  Nevertheless, further experimental validation is needed for the proposed pathway.
