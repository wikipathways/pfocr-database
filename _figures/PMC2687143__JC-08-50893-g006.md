caption: Conceptual organization of mito-checkpoint response. Mitochondrial damage
  is recognized by sensor protein(s). The signal is mediated by mediator(s) (such
  as ROS, ATP) and transduced by transducer(s). The transducers regulate effectors
  (such as p53). Together, mito-checkpoint helps to maintain the mitochondrial integrity
  of cell
