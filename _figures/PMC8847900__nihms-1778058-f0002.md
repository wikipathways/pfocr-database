caption: L-Phenylalanine is converted into l-tyrosine by the enzyme AAAH (aromatic
  amino acid hydroxylases). l-Tyrosine is converted into l-DOPA (l-dihydroxyphenylalanine)
  by the enzyme AAAH. l-DOPA is catalyzed to dopamine by the enzyme aromatic l-amino
  acid decarboxylase (AADC). Dopamine itself is also used as a precursor in the synthesis
  of the neuro-transmitters, norepinephrine and epinephrine. Dopamine is converted
  into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) and inactivated by
  COMT Norepinephrine is converted into epinephrine by the enzyme PNMT with SAM as
  the cofactor. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are inactivated by COMT. [,,].
