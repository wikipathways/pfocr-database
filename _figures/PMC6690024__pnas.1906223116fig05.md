caption: A schematic model depicting the proposed physiological function of the amino
  acid transporter ApNEAAT1 in amino acid transfer across the bacteriocyte and symbiosomal
  membranes in the aphid/Buchnera bacteriocyte. The predicted pathways are based on
  the membrane localization and functional characterization of ApNEAAT1 here, alongside
  metabolite profiling of hemolymph and bacteriocyte, and host and symbiont metabolic
  pathway analysis (protein and gene expression) in previous investigations (, , ,
  , , –). ApNEAAT1 substrates are identified in black text with nonsubstrates presented
  in gray text. The bacteriocyte membrane ApNEAAT1 is depicted as mediating influx
  into the bacteriocyte. However, if the concentration of any ApNEAAT1 substrate within
  the bacteriocyte was greater than in the hemolymph, it could also mediate efflux
  from bacteriocyte to hemolymph to supply other tissues, for example, during growth
  and development. MTHF, 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate; SS, symbiosomal space.
