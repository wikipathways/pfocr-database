caption: When WT mice are treated with antibiotics (ABX) to reduce gut flora and therefore
  the circulating SCFA, the Olfr78 and Gpr41 sides of the pathway are eliminated simultaneously,
  and therefore there is little change in blood pressure. However, in mice null for
  Olfr78, SCFA are signaling solely through the hypotensive side of the pathway. Therefore,
  if the ligand is reduced by antibiotic treatment in these mice, this hypotensive
  pathway is disrupted and there is a relative increase in blood pressure.
