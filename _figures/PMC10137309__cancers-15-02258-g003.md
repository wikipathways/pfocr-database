caption: 'Schematic representation of extravasation steps in lung cancer brain metastasis.
  (A) Rolling and firm adhesion: During adhesion to BE, lung cancer cells express
  ALCAM, CD15, CD15s (sLex), annexin A1 and ADAM9 that upregulate integrin α3β1 [35,130,134].
  (B) Trans-endothelial migration: During TEM, BECs downregulate the expression of
  Mfsd2a to induce permeability of BBB. Downregulation of adenosine A2A receptor in
  lung cancer cells activate SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling pathway and inhibits the expression
  of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 [136]. Upregulation of AKR1B10, degrades (ZO-1
  and VE- cadherin) and increases the levels of MMP2 and MMP9 [137]. BE Rho/ROCK signaling
  facilitates TEM with subsequent disruption of (occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1) [139].
  PLGF disrupts occludin and ZO-1 through interacting with its receptor, VEGFR-1 [140].
