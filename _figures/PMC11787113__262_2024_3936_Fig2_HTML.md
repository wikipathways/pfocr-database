caption: The phenotypic and functional characteristics of tumor-infiltrating B cells
  determine their overall impact on tumor progression or suppression. A IgG1 antibodies
  are often associated with anti-tumor B cell activity. In addition, dendritic cells
  and macrophages can capture IgG-bound tumor antigens and present these antigen-derived
  peptides to T cells. B cells are involved in the presentation of tumor-derived antigens
  to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In addition, studies have shown that B cells in the tumor
  microenvironment are capable of secreting cytokines that promote cytotoxic T cell
  responses, such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-12 (IL-12). While both IgG1
  and IgG3 isotypes are capable of mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
  (ADCC), phagocytosis, complement activation, and antigen cross-presentation through
  Fc receptor binding, IgG3 exhibits potent ADCC only in the presence of IgG1. B B
  cells induced the conversion of Tregs cells to IgA subtypes by promoting their production
  of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), forming a B cell-Tregs positive feedback
  regulatory pathway that promotes tumor immune evasion
