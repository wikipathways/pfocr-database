caption: 'The activation, amplification and regulation of the complement system. The
  complement system can be activated by three different pathways: the alternative
  pathway (AP), classical pathway (CP) and lectin pathway (LP). While the AP is constitutively
  active and undergoes a constant tick over, the CP and LP are triggered by antibody-
  and carbohydrate-mediated recognition mechanisms, respectively. Regardless of how
  this protein cascade is initiated, it is the AP that amplifies the complement system;
  e.g. if the AP C3 convertase is formed on an activator surface. All three pathways
  lead to the conversion of C3 into C3b, which can become covalently attached (via
  a thioester) to any nearby nucleophile (e.g., a hydroxyl or amine group on a surface);
  C3 cleavage releases the small protein fragment C3a, a potent anaphylatoxin. The
  remaining C3b can associate with factor B (FB), which is itself cleaved by factor
  D (FD). This forms the AP C3 convertase (i.e., C3bBb) where this is stabilized by
  factor P (FP). If this convertase is not deactivated then any free C3 in the vicinity
  will be converted into C3b and thus begins a positive feedback cycle, referred to
  as the amplification loop. If left to run unchecked, this will lead to the opsonization
  of the target surface (with C3b) and the formation of the AP C5 convertase (i.e.,
  C3bBbC3b), which represents the initiation of the terminal pathway of complement
  and the subsequent formation of the membrane-attack complex (MAC) that can lead
  to lysis (e.g., of bacteria). Host cells have a number of cell surface proteins
  capable of down-regulating the complement cascade that can either dissociate the
  AP C3 convertase, known as decay acceleration activity, or act as cofactors for
  the proteolytic cleavage, by factor I (FI), to inactive C3b (iC3b). The soluble
  C3b-binding protein factor H (FH) can associate with host cells via the recognition
  of glycan markers of self and thereby down-regulate complement through its decay
  accelerating and cofactor activities. FH (and the truncated FHL-1 product of the
  CFH gene) can also recognize self markers on acellular structures such as the extracellular
  matrix, and in this context FH/FHL-1 are the only negative regulators of the complement
  AP pathway. Therefore, FH and FHL-1 have a pivotal role in the prevention of complement
  activation in host tissues. This schematic is modified from []'
