  factor P (FP). If this convertase is not deactivated then any free C3 in the vicinity

  of the target surface (with C3b) and the formation of the AP C5 convertase (i.e.,
  C3bBbC3b), which represents the initiation of the terminal pathway of complement
  and the subsequent formation of the membrane-attack complex (MAC) that can lead
