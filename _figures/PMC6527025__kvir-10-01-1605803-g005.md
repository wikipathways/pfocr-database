caption: Apoptosis Signaling During Influenza A Virus Infection.IAV infection affects
  apoptosis in early and late infection. In early infection, it has anti-apoptotic
  effects by decreasing Bax and BAK, but in late infection, it is pro-apoptotic by
  increasing Bax and BAK, cleavage of PARP-I, truncation of the BID, phosphorylation
  of BAD and decreasing Bcl-2. Cellular factors P53, miR-29C, TRAIL, CLU and PRPc
  are involved in IAV infection through the apoptosis pathway. IAV proteins PB1-F2,
  NP, and NS1 are also involved.
