caption: Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family ligands (GFLs) signaling.
  The main signaling receptor for GFLs is receptor tyrosine kinase RET (REarranged
  in Transfection), which they activate upon binding to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
  (GPI)-anchored coreceptor GDNF family receptor alpha (GFRα) or transmembrane GFRAL.
  RET subsequently activates classical receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways
  such as MAPK, AKT, JNK and Src, which are important for the cell survival and neurite
  outgrowth. In addition, GFLs in the presence of GFRα can signal via the neural adhesion
  molecule (NCAM) associated with the Fyn kinase, promoting cell migration and neurite
  outgrowth. GFLs via NCAM can also indirectly activate the fibroblast growth factor
  receptor (FGFR). Finally, GFLs can bind syndecan-3 and activate the Src pathway,
  contributing to neuronal precursor migration. Please, notice that the cognate GFRα
  receptor for persephin (PSPN) contains only two extracellular cysteine-rich domains.
  For simplification, this is not reflected in the scheme. Solid arrows indicate direct
  interactions and subsequent events, dotted arrows—indirect activation of certain
  pathways. GDNF—glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, NRTN—neurturin and ARTN—artemin.
