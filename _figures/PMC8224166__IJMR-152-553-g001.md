caption: Fusobacterium nucleatum through FadA activates NF- kB and C-MYC transcription
  factors mediated cell proliferation pathway. Fusobacterium species produces short
  peptides or short chain fatty acids which act as chemo-attractants, and attracts
  TH 17 cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the tumour site. TH
  17 cells produce interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis
  factor α (TNF α), while myeloid suppressor cells suppress some T cell subpopulations
  such as CD4+ cells in tumour microenvironment. Fusobacterium also leads to the increased
  presence of tumour associated macrophages near tumour. Fusobacterium express FadA
  ligand molecules on its surface which binds to E cadherin which is an adhesion molecule
  in epithelial cells and activates E cadherin mediated β catenin cell proliferation
  pathway. Activation of β catenin signalling leads to its translocation inside the
  nucleus where it leads to increase in expression of oncogenes such as C-MYC and
  NF-kB by binding to coactivator transcription factors lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)
  and T cell factor (TCF).
