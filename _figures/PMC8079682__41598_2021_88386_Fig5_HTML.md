caption: Metabolic pathway map. Pathway map incorporating metabolic differences between
  IPL CpG-ODN treatment and DW control (left half of each metabolite box) and between
  IM CpG-ODN treatment and DW control (right half of each metabolite box). According
  to the Student’s t test (Table , ), metabolite boxes with a green background were
  significantly higher in CpG-ODN vs. DW controls, while metabolite boxes with a red
  background were lower in CpG-ODN compared to DW controls, 24 h post treatment. Higher
  levels of significance and fold change are reflected by a darker color, and lower
  levels and trends by a lighter color. Uncolored part of a box indicates metabolites
  that did not show any trend of change in concentrations between CpG-ODN and DW controls.
  Full arrows represent one-step metabolic conversion, and broken arrows depict at
  least two steps between a precursor and its derivative. Essential amino acids are
  in blue text, and metabolic events or location are in italic text with different
  colors. In animals, acetyl-CoA cannot be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis.
  The two reactions depend on each other. ? Unestablished in chickens.
