caption: 'Proposed model for how the activation of ECM receptor pathway in the adipose
  tissue is linked to obesity-associated insulin resistance. It is proposed that activation
  of ECM-receptor pathway would induce the expression of genes that mediate the metabolically
  unfavourable processes, including adipocyte death, inhibition of angiogenesis and
  attraction of pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration which culminate in insulin
  resistance. Potential downstream intracellular signalling partners of each ECM receptor
  include FAK for integrin receptors [], ERM for CD44 receptor [] and MAPKs for CD36
  receptor []. ECM: extracellular matrix; FAK: focal adhesion kinase; ERM: ezrin–radixin–moesin;
  MAPKs: mitogen-activated protein kinases; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor;
  ATM: adipose tissue macrophage.'
