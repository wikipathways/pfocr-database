caption: 'BAP1 inhibits glucose deprivation-induced UPR gene regulatory network activation.
  Genes belonging to the Protein processing in ER pathway (KEGG: ko04141; www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+ko04141)
  were plotted in pseudocolor indicative of its mRNA fold-changes (log2-transformed)
  on top of the pathway diagrams. Red: 2–8+ fold up-regulation; gray: less than twofold
  alteration; green: 2–8+ fold down-regulation. (A) Eight-hour glucose deprivation-induced
  UPR gene changes in UMRC6-EV cells. (B) Upon 8-h glucose deprivation, BAP1-affected
  UPR gene changes.'
