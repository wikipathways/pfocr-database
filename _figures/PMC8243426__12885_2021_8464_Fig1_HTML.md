caption: PI3K signaling pathway in physiological and malignant B-cells. PI3K activity
  is regulated in both a B-cell receptor (BCR) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
  mode. Upon RTK stimulation PI3K catalyses phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphonate
  (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), resulting in
  recruitment of AKT (Protein kinase B) and activation of the mTOR (mechanistic target
  of rapamycin) pathway. On the other hand, BCR stimulation leads to the recruitment
  of BTK (bruton tyrosine kinase) via PIP3 with downstream activation of the MAPK
  (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and NFĸB (nuclear factor ‘kappa-light-chain-enhancer’
  of activated B-cells) signaling pathway. Pathological triggering of both signaling
  pathways eventually results in increased proliferation and survival advantage of
  the B-cell. MZL = marginal zone lymphoma, Syk = spleen tyrosine kinase, Lyn = kinase
