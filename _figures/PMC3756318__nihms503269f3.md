caption: 'Pathway schematic of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)–mediated vasodilation
  and RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK)–mediated vasoconstriction in cutaneous vessels and the
  putative interactions between the two pathways. A. Dilation occurs through eNOS
  activation, which catalyzes the conversion of l-arginine into nitric oxide (NO).
  Nitric oxide then binds to soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC) and increases cyclic GMP
  and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activity, ultimately resulting in
  cutaneous smooth muscle relaxation. Although arginase could potentially reduce NO
  production because it competes with eNOS for its substrate, arginase activity is
  negligible in young healthy vessels. Constriction through the RhoA/ROCK pathway
  occurs through RhoA/ROCK activation, which leads to the following: 1) a decrease
  in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase (MLCP) activity and 2) an increase in Ca2+-mediated
  MLC kinase (MLCK) activity via α2C-adrenoceptor translocation and norepinephrine
  binding (this pathway seems to be only active under cold conditions). Either the
  decrease in MLCP activity or the increase in MLCK activity leads to a net increase
  in MLC phosphorylation, ultimately resulting in smooth muscle contraction. B. When
  eNOS activity predominates in cutaneous vessels, NO drives dilation via its conventional
  pathway as well as through the anticonstrictor effects of PKG: directly deactivating
  RhoA and acting on both MLCP and MLCK to decrease the phosphorylation state of MLC.
  C. Cold-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) activates RhoA/ROCK
  and leads to prolonged cutaneous constriction, which is mediated through ROCK’s
  established effects on MLCP and α2C translocation and possibly through its antidilator
  effects on the eNOS pathway. RhoA/ROCK can decrease NO bioavailability by decreasing
  eNOS transcription, translation, and activity and by activating arginase. It is
  likely that increases in ROS production may also quench NO before it can bind with
  soluble GC. Thus, cold- and age-induced increases in ROS production and RhoA/ROCK
  activity and decreases in NO production may perpetuate a cycle of proconstrictor
  activity by stimulating RhoA/ROCK and removing NO-mediated inhibition, respectively.

  effects.'
