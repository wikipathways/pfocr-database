caption: At the plasma membrane, the ligands CD95L, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand (TRAIL), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) induce multimerization and activation
  of the death receptors CD95, TRAIL R1/R2, and TNFR1 respectively leading to death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC) assembly. The CD95 or TRAILR1/R2 DISC leads to caspase-8
  induced proximity via fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD)binding the
  intracellular death domain (DD) of the receptor and the death effector domain (DED)
  of caspase-8. Caspase-8 activates the downstream caspases directly or indirectly
  through BID cleavage and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). TNFR1
  recruits receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), TNFR1-associated
  death domain protein (TRADD), TNF receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2), cellular
  inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1/2 (cIAP1/2), and linear ubiquitin assembly complex
  (LUBAC), comprised of HOIL1-interacting protein (HOIP), heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin
  ligase 1 (HOIL1), and SHANK Associated RH Domain Interactor (Sharpin). LUBAC adds
  linear ubiquitin chains (Ub) to RIPK1 and NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO)to
  recruit the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (IKK)complex to activate
  nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) (p50/p65).
  cIAP1/2 induce NIK degradation to inhibit non-canonical NFκB (RelB/p50). In the
  absence of cIAP1/2, TRADD/RIPK1/TRAF2 disassociates from the plasma membrane and
  recruits FADD and caspase-8 (Complex IIa) to induce apoptosis. In the absence of
  caspase-8, RIPK1 forms a complex with RIPK3 (Complex IIb). RIPK3 induces phosphorylation
  of mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL), resulting in necroptosis.
  Cellular-FLICE inhibitory protein long or short (c-FLIPL/s) can form heterodimers
  with caspase-8. At high concentrations c-FLIPL and c-FLIPs inhibit caspase-8 activation.
  c-FLIPL interaction with caspase-8 within complex IIa destabilizes the complex IIb,
  promoting survival. For simplicity, c-FLIPs is shown in the DISC and c-FLIPL is
  shown in complex IIa but the isoforms can interact with both complexes.
