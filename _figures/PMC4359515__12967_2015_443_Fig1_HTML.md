caption: Metformin, an FDA approved drug for type-II diabetes as a potential combination
  therapy for Tuberculosis with existing antibiotics. a) Antibiotic targeting mycolic
  acid biosynthesis; b) systems-level changes resulting into the reduction of flux
  carrying capacity of glycolysis and citric acid cycle c) resulting re-routing of
  metabolic fluxes through de novo NAD biosynthesis pathway and electron transport
  through NDH-I d) possibility of targeting NDH-I with metformin.
