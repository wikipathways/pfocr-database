caption: Highly simplified overview of various functions of the mitochondrion, adjusted
  to highlight the steps catalyzed by enzymes for which the respective encoding genes
  were studied in this work. PDHA and PDHB, situated in the mitochondrial matrix,
  catalyze the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl CoA, which enters the TCA cycle.
  Therein IDH, OGDH, and MDH all have decarboxylative functions generating NADH and
  releasing CO2. Note the reverse arrow between malate and oxaloacetate (OAA), in
  the upper right corner of the figure, indicating the adverse function of MDH, whereby
  NADH is instead oxidised into NAD+ used in the photorespiratory conversion of glycine
  into serine. This process is linked to the glycine cleavage system (GCS), in which
  the GCSH protein plays a crucial role. In oxidative phosphorylation (lower right
  part of the figure), electrons are transferred from reductants to O2 along the mitochondrial
  electron transport chain, consisting of transport proteins I–V, producing ATP. COX5B
  is the terminal oxidase in this chain, so the activity of this enzyme greatly influences
  ATP production. AOX1A is the terminal oxidase of the alternative pathway, which
  may protect the chain from electron overflow; however, the alternative pathway also
  lowers the yield of the chain, since less ATP is produced
