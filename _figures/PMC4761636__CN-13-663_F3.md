caption: 'Omega-3 fatty acids enhance BDNF synthesis and signalling in neurons and
  also influence cannabinoid-mediated synaptic plasticity. (A) BDNF binds cognate
  TrKB receptors and activates PLC-γ, ERK/MAPK and Akt/PKB intracellular signalling
  pathways. Activation of PLC-γ leads to the release of calcium from the endoplasmatic
  reticulum and to the activation of CAMKII, which phosphorylates CREB and activates
  gene transcription. Activation of ERK/MAPK pathway also regulates transcription
  through CREB phosphorylation, whereas PI3K phosphorylates and activates Akt/PKB
  and mTOR, regulating translation. DHA enhances neurotrophic signalling by the PI3K/Akt
  BDNF signal transduction pathway. DHA also activates the MAPK pathway; activated
  MAPK then phosphorylates CREB which translocates into the nucleus and activates
  BDNF gene transcription. (B) Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are signalling lipids produced
  from PUFAs present in membrane phospholipids. PUFAs are released from the postsynaptic
  membrane by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in response to neuronal activation. eCB released
  in the synaptic cleft can bind presynaptic cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) on
  the presynaptic neuron. Activation of CB1 leads to inhibition of neurotransmitter
  release and synaptic activity. In rodents that are fed a n3-PUFA enriched diet,
  such eCB-mediated long-term depression (LTD) is inhibited at excitatory synapses,
  whereas rodents fed a diet chronically low in n-3 PUFAs has this form of eCB-mediated
  synaptic plasticity specifically interrupted. Abbreviations: BDNF- brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor; CAMKII- Calciumcalmodulin kinase II; CREB- cAMP-response element-binding
