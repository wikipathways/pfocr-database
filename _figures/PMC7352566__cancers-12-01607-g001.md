caption: 'DNA Double Strand Break repair by Homologous Recombination or Non-Homologous
  End-Joining pathway. Figure: In the absence of functional BRCA1, DNA Double strand
  breaks (DSBs) may be repaired by the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway.
  Loss of 53BP1 is an acquired resistance mechanism in BRCA1 mutant tumours. 53Bp1
  normally promotes DSB repair by NHEJ, by forming a 53Bp1-RIF1 complex that protects
  DSB ends from endonuclease processing. Loss of 53BP1 prohibits a recruitment of
  Shieldin (SHLD) complex to DSB, allowing 5′ end resection, and reactivation of HR
  in a BRCA1 independent manner.'
