caption: TGF-β signalling pathway and The roles of ghrelin in fibrosis. When TGF-β
  is activated, it phosphorylates TβR II, which recruits TβR I to phosphorylate the
  Smad protein receptor. Phosphorylated Smad 2/3 then combines with Smad4 to form
  a complex. Target gene transcription is regulated by the activated Smad complexes
  once they are transported to the nucleus. In renal fibrosis, exogenous ghrelin administration
  decreased TGF-β1, Smad, and p-Smad3 protein expression. Collagen I, collagen III,
  α-SMA, and fibronectin expression levels were all crease; however, after ghrelin
  treatment, they all decreased. Amelioration of fibrosis via the TGF-β1-Smad pathway.
  Ghrelin can also exert anti-fibrotic effects through non-TGF-β pathways, such as
  NF-kB, TNF-α, ROS, CTGF, and GDF-15. α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; NF-kB, Nuclear
  factor kB; TNF-α, Tumor necrosis factor-α; ROS, Reactive oxygen species; CTGF, Connective
  tissue growth factor; GDF-15, Growth differentiation factor 15. (The grey arrow
  means promotion and the T bar means inhibitory effect.)
