caption: Application of alginate lyases and associated metabolic pathways. The schematic
  diagram shows the application of single (A) and combined (B) enzymes. C Schematic
  pathways for the production of bioethanol and other value-added biochemicals. A
  workflow for ethanol production in industrial microbes (E. coli and S. cerevisiae)
  is shown as red solid arrows. In S. cerevisiae, the eukaryotic DEH transporter DHT1
  is introduced for DEH entry. The workflow for bioethanol production in native alginate-utilising
  bacteria Sphingomonas sp. A1 and Vibrio sp. dhg is shown as green dashed arrows.
  Besides ethanol production, Vibrio sp. dhg was also engineered to synthesise 2,3-butanediol
  and lycopene. Alginate-utilising strain D. phaphyphila harbours a distinct pathway
  and stepwise converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and ethanol, which is shown as orange
  solid arrows. In E. coli and Vibrio sp. dhg, endogenous genes including frd encoding
  fumarate reductase, ldh encoding lactate dehydrogenase, and pfl encoding pyruvate-formate
  lyase, were deleted to block by-product synthesis, shown as green crosses. In Sphingomonas
  sp. A1, only lactate formation is inhibited by deletion of ldh gene
