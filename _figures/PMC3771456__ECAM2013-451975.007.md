caption: 'The network of the potential biomarkers changing for NAFLD and EIH-treated
  modulation according to the KEGG PATHWAY database. Column value in histograms is
  expressed as mean ± S.D. Metabolite names in red and green represent elevation and
  inhibition, respectively. Metabolite names in black mean they were not detected
  in our experiment. The bule words are pathway''s names. PRPP: phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate.'
