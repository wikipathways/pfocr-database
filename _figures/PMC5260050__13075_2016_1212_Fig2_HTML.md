caption: Pathway map for selected proteins encoded by genes that were upregulated
  in baseline systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) samples. Protein interaction
  networks for selected proteins that were upregulated in baseline SJIA samples compared
  with healthy control samples. Proteins were mapped using Metacore™ pathway maps
  (Thompson Reuters, New York, NY, USA). The network displayed here represents a combination
  of maps for the signaling pathways for IL-1β, IL-6, and the toll-like receptors
  TL2 and TL4. Small red arrows adjacent to gene/protein names indicate upregulation
  in SJIA. ADAM10 disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10,
  AP-1 activator protein 1, CARD caspase recruitment domain, CASP caspase, C/EBP CCAAT/enhancer
  binding protein, COX2 cyclooxlygenase-2, CREB cyclic AMP responsive element binding
  protein, GRB growth factor receptor-bound protein, IL-1beta interleukin-1 beta,
  IL-R1 interleukin-1 receptor, IL1RN interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6 interleukin-6,
  IL-6R interleukin-6 receptor, sIL-6RA soluble interleukin-6 receptor antagonist,

  IRF interferon regulatory factor, JAK Janus kinase, MCPIP monocyte chemotactic protein-induced
  protein, MEK mitogen activated kinase kinase, MMP matrix metalloproteinase, NFκB
