caption: Schematic view of potential targets and site of action of some biologics
  in IBD. Following stimulation with bacterial products/components, antigen presenting
  cells (APCs) produce IL-12, which facilitates the differentiation of Th1 cells.
  Moreover, APCs make IL-23 and IL-6, which contribute to the polarization and expansion
  of Th17 cells. Briakinumab and ustekinumab, two monoclonal antibodies directed against
  p40, a subunit shared by IL-12 and IL-23, could interfere with the activation of
  both Th1 and Th17 cells. Commitment of naive T cells along the Th17 cell pathway
  and survival of such cells could also be inhibited by tocilizumab, an antibody blocking
  IL-6 signalling. The biological activity of IFN-γ, a typical Th1 cytokine, can be
  suppressed by fontolizumab, while anti-TNF antibodies include infliximab, adalimumab
  and certolizumab. Th17-derived cytokines, such as IL-17A and IL-21, contribute to
  amplify the ongoing mucosal inflammation by stimulating epithelial cells to make
  chemokines, thus enhancing the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the intestinal
  lamina propria. TNF and IL-21 can also stimulate fibroblasts to synthesize MMPs,
  a family of enzymes that play a major role in the mucosal degradation and tissue
  damage occurring in IBD. Moreover, IL-21 enhances the production of IFN-γ by Th1
  cells, thereby expanding Th1 cell responses. Attenuation of the mucosal inflammation
  could be obtained using IL-22, a cytokine made by both Th17 cells and Th22 cells,
  which targets epithelial cells and stimulates the production of defensins and mucins.
  In IBD, there is a defective activity of TGF-β1, a powerful anti-inflammatory cytokine,
  due to high Smad7. Smad7 is an inhibitor Smad that interacts with type I TGF-β receptor
  and prevents Smad3/3 phosphorylation, a phenomenon that is induced by activated
  type I TGF-β receptor following binding of TGF-β1 to type II TGF-β receptor. Inhibition
  of TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation by Smad7 prevents the interaction of Smad2/3
  with Smad4 and subsequent migration of the complex to the nucleus, where Smad2/3+Smad4
  inhibit the expression of many inflammatory genes. Therefore, inhibition of Smad7
  with a specific antisense oligonucleotide could restore TGF-β1 activity and facilitate
  the resolution of the inflammatory process.
