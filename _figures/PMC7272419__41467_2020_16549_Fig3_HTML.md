caption: a Extracellular medium composition defined in the models. b Graph of the
  subnetwork from Recon 2 for the uptake of l-histidine and the medium components
  required for its metabolism. Green represents the metabolites from the subnetwork,
  and orange represents the metabolites of the core network where the subnetwork is
  connected. In blue, the medium metabolite under study (l-histidine) and in pink,
  the extracellular metabolites co-utilized to metabolize l-histidine. The pathway
  starts with the transport of l-histidine from the extracellular space to the cytosol,
  where it is sequentially transformed into urocanate (urcan_c), 4-imidazolone-5-propanoate
  (4izp_c), N-formimidoyl-l-glutamate (forglu_c), l-glutamate (glu_L_c), 5-formiminotetrahydrofolate
  (5forthf_c), 5-10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (methf_c), and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate
  (10thf_c). 4-Aminobutanoate (4abut_c) is converted to l-glutamate through a reaction
  from the subsystem glutamate metabolism, and finally, l-glutamate is connected to
  the TCA cycle.
