caption: 'Mechanisms of Nrf2–ARE pathway activation by Michael acceptors. (a) Under
  baseline conditions, Nrf2 forms a complex with Keap1 in the cytosol, which facilitates
  the ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2 by the proteasome. (b) The dissociation
  of the Nrf2–Keap1 complex is an essential prerequisite for Nrf2/ARE activation by
  Michael acceptors that happens through two mechanisms: (i) by modification of the
  cysteines in Keap1, which leads to conformational changes in this protein and the
  subsequent release of Nrf2; (ii) by activation of kinases that phosphorylate Nrf2
  and thereby free it from Keap1-mediated complex. After nuclear translocation, Nrf2
  binds to ARE in the promoter regions of various detoxification, antioxidant and
  anti-inflammatory genes. Nrf2, Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; Keap1,
  Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; ARE, antioxidant response element; Ub, ubiquitin;
  P, phosphate.'
