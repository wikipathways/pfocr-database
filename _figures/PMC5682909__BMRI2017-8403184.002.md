caption: The roles of TSP-1 in diverse pathological processes. TSP-1 interacting with
  CD47 or CD36 suppressed VEGF-induced angiogenesis to inhibit NO signaling pathway.
  Moreover, TSP-1 binding to CD36 or CD47 induced apoptosis. TSP-1 exerted proinflammatory
  effect by elevating the levels of IL-6. However, TSP-1 played an anti-inflammatory
  role by regulating TGF-β and inhibiting NO-mediated vascular cell responses. In
  addition, TSP-1 mediated fibrosis through a TGF-β signaling pathway.
