caption: Model for ACSBG role in M. gaditana. The scheme shows the major FAs in major
  glycerolipid classes, i.e. PC, DGTS, PE, and TAG in the ER, and MGDG in the plastid.
  Each membrane glycerolipid class is shown as a gray block. TAG is shown in a gray
  circle. A, De novo synthesis of FAs in the stroma of the plastid. The action of
  FA synthetase of type II (FAS II) leads to the production of 16:0-ACP, which can
  be desaturated by a palmitoyl ACP desaturase (PAD) into 16:1-ACP. These acyls can
  be exported to the cytosol, possibly as FFAs, through the four limiting membranes
  of the plastid. B, ACSBG phenotype is consistent with a role in the production of
  16:1-CoA. Unknown ACS isoforms (ACSx) catalyze the production of 16:0-CoA. C, The
  16:1 is incorporated at the sn-2 position of ER lipids via LPAT1 in N. oceanica
  (). Impairment of ACSBG alters this process. D, The 16:0-CoA is elongated into 18:0-CoA
  by the action of D0-ELO isoforms, as a committing step in the 16:0-to-20:5 synthesis
  pathway (). E, VLC-PUFA synthesis, starting with the 18:0-to-18:3 desaturation on
  PC by the stepwise action of an ERD9FAD, an ERD12FAD, and an ERD6FAD. Since PC accumulates
  18 precursors (18:1 and 18:2), we consider that the mutants are likely impaired
  downstream, at the level of 18:3 elongation, leading therefore to the positioning
  of ACSBG at the level of 18:3-CoA production, feeding the Δ6-ELO isoform producing
  20:3-CoA. Downstream processes, i.e. 20:3-to-20:5 desaturations occurring on DGTS
  would be consistently impaired, with a decrease in the end-product, 20:5. F, Some
  20:3-to-20:5 desaturation processes occurring in DGTS operate also in PE. The slowing
  down of 20:5 synthesis also occurs in PE. G, As a result, following the mass action
  law, the slowing down occurring in the 16:0-to-20:5 pathway is expected to lead
  to an over-accumulation of 16:0-CoA. Excess 16:0-CoA can be stored as TAG, via the
  DGAT/Kennedy pathway. H, An important assumption for this model is that a positive
  feedback is exerted on the plastid, exporting most its FAs, and explaining that
  the omega pathway is activated to provide sufficient 20:5 to plastid glycerolipids
  to compensate the lack of 16-carbon substrates. AAS, acyl-ACP synthetase; DGAT,
