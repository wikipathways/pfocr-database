caption: Current view of the genetic competence pathway in S. mutans. Competence activation
  is centrally mediated by the ComRS system, consisting of the Rgg-like transcriptional
  regulator ComR, and ComS, a 17-aa precursor of the 7-aa XIP peptide. ComS is processed
  into XIP and exported by unknown mechanism(s), potentially facilitated by dedicated
  transport systems such as PptAB or through cell lysis. Externalized XIP can activate
  nearby cells in an intercellular signaling mechanism or is re-imported by oligopeptide
  permeases (Opp) in an intracellular signaling manner. Cytosolic ComS or XIP interacts
  with the transcriptional regulator ComR, forming the ComR-XIP complex. The complex
  recognizes a select palindromic sequence termed the ComR-box, located within the
  promoter of both comX and comS, the latter creating a positive feedback loop for
  the system. Several negative regulators can also impact ComRS signaling, including
  decreased environmental pH and XrpA, located intragenically within the comX coding
  sequence on a separate reading frame that inhibits ComRS signaling through direct
  interaction with ComR. After competence activation, the alternative sigma factor
  ComX directs the RNA polymerase to a regulon consisting of late competence genes
  whose products make up the machinery needed for DNA uptake and potential homologous
  recombination of the single stranded DNA into the genome. However, the RcrRPQ operon,
  that is negatively regulated by RcrR, can shut down ComX production through overexpression
  of the ABC transporters RcrP and RcrQ that results in the processing/degradation
  of comX mRNA. Additionally, two peptides located at the 3′ end of the rcrQ coding
  region termed Pep1 and Pep2 are believed to modulate competence signaling through
  interactions with the (p)ppGpp enzymes RelA and RelP. Several distal regulators,
  including two component systems ComDE, ScnKR, and HdrMR, membrane protein DivIB
  and (p)ppGpp concentration mediated by the dual synthetase/hydrolase enzyme RelA
  can impact ComRS signaling.
