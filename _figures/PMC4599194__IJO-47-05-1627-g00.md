caption: 'Schematic model of MIF pathways in breast cancer cells (BCC). (A) Auto-
  and paracrine MIF effects: MIF interacts with its main receptor CD74 and CXCR4,
  promoting cell survival by activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, neo-angiogenesis
  by increased secretion levels of VEGF and IL-8 and inhibiting autophagy. (B) Regulation
  of MIF synthesis: MIF is upregulated in BCC by HIF-1α and other potential hypoxia
  induced mechanisms, stabilized by Hsp-90 particularly in HER2 overexpressed BCC
  and secreted by unconventional pathway. In turn it enhances HIF-1α activation.'
