caption: Gut-kidney axis. The increase of outer membrane vesicles (OMV) produced by
  Gram-negative bacteria, OMV contains abundant lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which reduces
  the intestinal tight junction related proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1),
  and damages intestinal barrier. These are transferred to the renal tubulointers
  space through blood circulation, leading to enhancced expression of inflammatory
  factors such as interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, monocyte chemotactic
  protein (MCP)-1 and IL-6 in renal tubular epithelial cells through the Caspase-11
  pathway. LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, up-regulates the expression of
  TLR4 and nucleotide-binding oligomeric domain-like receptor protein (NLRP)3 and
  promotes renal fibrosis. Enterogenous endotoxin damage of intestinal epithelial
  cells, the damage of glomerular filtration barrier, lead to increased proteinuria
