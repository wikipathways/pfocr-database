caption: Graphic models of signal pathway illustrations in this study. ANTP-SMACN7,
  as a SMAC mimic, could enter into cancer cells and inhibit the activity of XIAP
  and then promote the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in lung cancer cells
  after irradiation with high linear energy transfer (LET). As a result, apoptosis
  is increased after high LET radiation. Route 1 in this figure involves significant
  inhibitory effects in terms of XIAP after combined treatment with ANTP-SMACN7 and
  high LET IR. Inhibition of XIAP can disrupt the interactions between Linker-BIR2
  and caspase-3 (route 2) and between XIAP-BIR3 and caspase-9 (route 3), leading to
  a relief of XIAP-mediated caspase inhibition, followed by induction increases of
  apoptosis (route 4).  Direct action or access;  no direct access;  direct inhibition;  indetermination
  inhibition.
