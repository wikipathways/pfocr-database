caption: Germinants that are sensed by B. subtilis, C. botulinum, C. perfringens,
  and C. difficile are shown in dark blue; C. botulinum Group I and III germinants
  are shown in the brackets (and includes L-Ala). Amino acid and calcium ion co-germinants
  are not pictured for C. difficile (, , ). Germinant receptors are shown in green.
  The signaling pathway between B. subtilis and C. botulinum Groups 1 and III (far
  left) differs from the other clostridial organisms mainly with respect to cortex
  hydrolase (shown in orange) activation mechanisms, with SleC being activated by
  proteolytic cleavage by Csp proteases, and the CwlJ and SleB cortex hydrolases being
  activated by directly or indirectly by DPA release. Accordingly, the order of cortex
  hydrolysis and DPA release via SpoVAC differs between these two types of mechanisms.
  C. botulinum Group II and IV encode germinant receptors with variable numbers of
  A and B components. Adapted from ().
