caption: 'Figure 7. Apo2L/TRAIL signaling pathway and available agents in clinical
  trials DD: death domain; FADD: Fas-associated death domain; 3,6,7,8,9,10 indicates
  each caspase 3 and caspase 6,7,8,9,10 accordingly. Other agent names are listed
  in the legend section. DR4 and DR5 have a cytoplasmic death domain that is lacking
  in the decoy receptors (DcR) that bind to Apo2L/TRAIL. Mapatumumab is an agonistic
  DR4-targeting monoclonal antibody and Lexatumumab, Drozitumab, AMG-655, LBY 135
  and CS-1008 are agonistic DR5-targeting monoclonal antibodies. Dulanermin (recombinant
  human Apo2L/TRAIL) can stimulate pro-apoptotic death receptors on the surface of
  cancer cells as does native endogenous Apo2L/TRAIL. The extrinsic apoptosis pathway
  is mediated by the initiator caspase 8 and 10 and the effector caspase 3, 6 and
  7. In many cancer cell types, pro-apoptotic receptor agonists induce both the extrinsic
  and intrinsic (mitochondrion mediated) apoptosis pathways. FOXO3, a direct regulator
  of the TRAIL gene, binds to the promoter site and regulates transcription. FOXO3
  is regulated by other regulators shown in this figure, as well as other mechanisms
  via c-MET, JNK, IKK and NFkB.'
