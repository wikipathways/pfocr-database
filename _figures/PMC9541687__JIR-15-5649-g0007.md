caption: Flow chart of the possible mechanism of action of isocorydine. (A) LPS activates
  the TLR4-NFκB signaling pathway, leading to large amounts of NFκB translocation
  from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and subsequent expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β; meanwhile, LPS can increase vitamin D
  receptor (VDR) translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, leading to inhibition
  of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (B) On the one hand, isocorydine
  (ICD) increases Vdr mRNA expression and VDR distribution in the nucleus. On the
  other hand, ICD is presumed to inhibit NFκB p65 translocation from the cytoplasm
  into the nucleus, because highly expressed VDR strongly interacts with NFκB p65,
  leading to less NFκB p65 translocation into the nucleus and subsequently, reduced
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
