caption: Metabolic transporter in the peripheral nervous system. The major transporters
  are glucose transporters (GLUT) 1 and 3 and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1,
  2, and 4. GLUT1 and 3 transport glucose into the cell where it can be metabolized
  by glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). MCTs co-transport lactate,
  pyruvate, or ketone bodies along with a proton (H+) either into or out of cells,
  based on their concentration gradients. Lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies can
  be substrates for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce ATP through oxidative
  metabolism. Additional transporter are connexins (Cx) and pannexins (Panx), specifically
  Panx1 and 2. Cx have been shown to transport a number of products through gap junctions
  or hemichannels, primarily limited only by size, including ATP, ions, glutamate,
  and glutamine. Panx1 and 2 transport ATP and ions through hemichannels into or out
  of cells
