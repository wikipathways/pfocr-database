caption: Schematic diagram of cell cycle arrest in senescent cells. (a) Diploid senescent
  cells. In response to various intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli such as telomere erosion,
  DNA damage, oxidative stress, and activated oncogene overexpression, cells enter
  a senescent state. In senescent cells, CDK inhibitors, p21 and p16, are upregulated
  and the Rb protein is maintained in the active state. Active Rb inhibits the transition
  from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. (b) Tetraploid senescent cells. At the
  G2 phase of cell cycle, the p53/p21 pathway is activated in the cells exposed to
  senescence, inducing stimuli. APC/CCdh1 is prematurely activated via the accumulation
  of p21, and mitosis skip occurs in these cells. The Rb family of proteins is also
  important for the induction and maintenance of senescence.
