caption: Schematic of “all-in-one” nanosensitizer platform. An “all-in-one” nanosensitizer
  platform by incorporating Ce6 and HCQ into angiopep-2 peptide-modified liposomes
  (designated ACHL) for orthotopic glioma theranostics was designed. An initial ultrasonic
  pulse (US1) destroyed the microbubbles and promoted the ACHL into the reversibly
  opened BBB, while a second ultrasonic stimulus (US2) generated the SDT effects.
  SDT-mediated mitophagy and its inhibition by HCQ were evaluated, along with the
  anti-glioma effects. The MAPK/p38 signaling pathway contributed to the progression
  of mitophagy induced by nanoCe6-SDT.
