caption: Cellular redox status and phosphorylation control critical steps of starch
  metabolism. PTMs serve for tight, transient control of enzymes involved in starch
  metabolism to meet the energy demands associated with daily growth and stress responses.
  NTRC uses the NADPH to reduce and activate AGPase. Trx can also reduce AGPase in
  vitro, but the in vivo evidence is still lacking. Here, we hypothesize that Trx
  could also regulate the redox state of other enzymes associated with starch metabolism.
  AGPase might also integrate systemic and tissue-specific signals conveying the carbon
  status, putatively through the sucrose-T6P nexus and SnRK1 regulatory axis. AGPase
  synthesizes the substrate of starch polymerization, ADP-Glucose (ADP-Glc), which
  enters the starch synthesis pathway performed by a set of enzymes that elongates
  and control the branching of starch polymer (e.g., SS, SBEs, and DBEs). The phosphorylation
  of these enzymes seems to generally enhance their activity, possibly through the
  formation of metabolic enzyme complexes. The binding of 14-3-3 proteins to SBEs
  and DBEs might also promote enzyme complex formation to increase starch polymerization
  efficiency. Redox regulation is also necessary for starch degradation as the reduced
  GWD phosphorylates starch to open its structure and increase starch availability
  to amylases. Beta-amylases (BAMs) catalyze starch breakdown into maltose, and this
  crucial step might integrate hormonal (ABA) and nutrient signals through SnRK2-AREB/ABF
  pathway and TOR. While SnRK2 enhances BAM1 expression, TOR-dependent BAM1 phosphorylation
  might enhance its activity. The physiological relevance of several PTMs of proteins
  involved in starch degradation, such as alpha-amylase AMY3, maltose export from
  chloroplast (MEX1), and conversion to glucose (DPE2), is yet to be clarified. Nonetheless,
  protein disulfide reduction and phosphorylation seem to be essential PTMs regulating
  starch synthesis/degradation dynamics. Upon C-starvation, SnRK1 promotes autophagy
  processes through ATG1 phosphorylation, activating the ATG1 kinase complex (ATG1,
  AGT13, ATG101, and ATG11). SnRK1 also phosphorylates RAPTOR1B and disrupts the TOR
  kinase complex that inhibits the ATG1 complex. The SnRK1-TOR axis regulates starch
  degradation and autophagy to promote energy and nutritional homeostasis at the cellular
  and systemic levels. Phosphorylation (P), ubiquitination (Ub), acetylation (Ac),
  sulfhydryl groups (S-H), disulfide bridge (S-S), nitrosylation (S-NO). Connectors
  ending with arrows = activation; connectors ending with bars = repression. Solid
  connectors = demonstrated pathways; dashed connectors = hypothetic pathways. Green
  upward arrows = induction; red downward arrows = repression. Starch is represented
  by many linked glucose moieties, while fewer linked glucose moieties represent starch
  degradation products.
