caption: 'Proposed model for bHLH regulatory pathway of anther development in rice.
  The top panel illustrates the regulatory network primarily active during the meiotic
  phase of anther development, with a predominant role of bHLH transcription factors.
  In contrast, the bottom panel depicts the regulatory pathway during the microspore
  maturation phase, highlighting genes directly associated with tapetum programmed
  cell death (PCD) and pollen wall formation. Lines indicate direct regulation, while
  dashed lines indicate possible regulation. Arrows indicate induction while dashes
  indicate repression. Taper lines indicate the product of the expression. The color
  of the boxes in the legend, as well as the color and shape of the protein are the
  same between the orthologs in Arabidopsis in . UDT1: UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM1; TDF1:
