caption: The colorectal cancer (CRC) stem cell model. In the normal state, stem cells
  are located near the base of the crypt. Inactive Wnt signaling and activated transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β signaling regulate cell growth and mitigate overactivation
  of cell cycle–related target genes. In hereditary colon cancer syndromes such as
  familial adenomatous polyposis, the Wnt signaling pathway is activated secondary
  to a functional abnormality in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein. The
  defect in this protein permits β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus to activate
  downstream transcription factors and growth-related targets. This likely occurs
  in CRC stem cells, resulting in the generation of many “preneoplastic” colon polyps.
  Disruption of TGF-β signaling via loss of β2-spectrin (β2SP), Smad4, or the type
  II receptor (TBRII) synergistically promotes CRC tumorigenesis, likely in stem cells.
  gsk3β—glycogen synthase kinase 3β; TBRI—type I receptor.
