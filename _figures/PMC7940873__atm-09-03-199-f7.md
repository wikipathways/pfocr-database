caption: 'LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network analysis. Six differentially expressed
  lncRNAs interacted with 40 identified mRNAs closely related to the TNF signaling
  pathway, and 12 identified mRNAs were extremely relevant to the PI3K-Akt signaling
  pathway. The three red dots represent up-regulated lncRNAs, the three green dots
  represent down-regulated lncRNAs, and 51 blue dots represent deregulated mRNAs in
  the above pathways. Besides, 76 positive relationships (marked with continuous lines)
  and 58 negative relationships (marked with dotted lines) are listed. LncRNAs: long
  noncoding RNAs; mRNAs, messenger RNAs; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.'
