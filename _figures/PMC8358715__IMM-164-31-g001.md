caption: HIF‐1 modulates the differentiation of T cells towards pathogenic Th17/Th1
  or regulatory Treg/Tr1 cells depending on cytokine milieu within the hypoxic autoinflammatory
  lesions. The relative abundance of IL‐6, IL‐12, TGF‐β and IL‐27 dictates the differentiation
  of Th17, Th1, Treg or Tr1 cells. TGF‐β induces the expression of both FOXP3 and
  RORγt. In the absence of IL‐6, FOXP3 antagonizes the binding of RORγt to the DNA,
  leading to the activation of T‐cell transcriptional programme towards Treg cells.
  But, in the presence of IL‐6 and low level of TGF‐β, IL‐6 pathway‐activated STAT3
  induces the expression of RORγt, which forms transcriptional complex with P300,
  HIF‐1 and STAT3 leading to the expression of IL‐17. In the presence of IL‐27, T
  cells become IL‐10‐producing Tr1. IL‐27 induces the expression of AHR through the
  activation of STAT3 pathway. AHR together with C‐MAF induces the expression of IL‐10
  and IL‐21. IL‐21 promotes the stability and growth of Tr1 through autocrine signalling.
  AHR together with STAT3 also induces the expression of ectonucleotidase CD39. CDC9
  degrades ATP, a suppressor of Tr1, into AMP on the plasma membrane. In the presence
  of IL‐12, T cells become IFN‐γ‐producing Th1 cells through the activation of STAT4
  pathway. Hypoxia within the inflammatory lesions leads to the accumulation of HIF‐1,
  also induced by IL‐6‐activated STAT3, which interacts with FOXP3 or AHR and facilitates
  their degradation via pVHL‐E3L‐mediated proteasomal degradation, suppressing the
  differentiation of Treg or Tr1 cells. HIF1 inhibits the expression of STAT4 and
  therefore suppresses the development of IFN‐γ‐producing Th1 cells. HIF‐1 also inhibits
  the expression of SOCS3, which forms a feedback inhibitory loop with STAT3 and therefore
  promotes the differentiation of Th17 cells by restricting the suppression of STAT3
  activation. HIF‐1 also induces the expression of glycolytic enzymes, which promotes
  the differentiation of Th17 cells over Treg cells by facilitating the metabolic
  switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolytic pathway. HIF‐1 not only enhances
  but also inhibits the differentiation of Th17 by inducing the expression of iNOS,
  which suppresses the transcriptional activity of RORγt by NO‐mediated nitration.
