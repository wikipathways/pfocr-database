caption: p53 controls the cellular response to different stress stimuli and determines
  cell fate. In normal cells or cancer cells harboring wild-type p53, certain cellular
  stresses (A and B)—for example, a high level of DNA damage or ribosomal stress,
  may induce p53-dependent apoptosis to eliminate severely damaged cells. In contrast,
  other types of stress stimuli (C and D)—for example, low levels of oxidative stress,
  DNA damage, or nutrient deprivation—may activate p53-dependent cell-survival mechanisms,
  which maintain homeostasis and repair for long-term cellular stability. p53-dependent
  transcription targets have been implicated in either proapoptotic or pro-survival
  mechanisms. Conversely, loss of p53 wild-type functions may lead to opposite outcomes,
  in which A and B can result in cellular resistance and survival, whereas C and D
  may lead to apoptosis, which is a favorable outcome for chemotherapy. Therefore,
  understanding the different outcomes of different stress stimuli on p53 pathway
  activation is useful in determining therapy for wild-type p53, as well as for p53-deficient
  tumor cells.
