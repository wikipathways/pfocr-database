caption: Balancing DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair.Homologous recombination repair
  (HR) and classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) are orchestrated in a balanced
  DSB repair response. cNHEJ initiates with recognition of the DNA ends by the Ku70/Ku80
  heterodimer, which then recruits the catalytic subunit of the DNA dependent protein
  kinase (DNA-PKcs). If necessary, ends can be trimmed by nucleases (e.g. Artemis)
  to create compatible ends. The ligation complex consisting of DNA ligase IV and
  XRCC4 ligates the ends. In contrast, HR is initiated by the nuclease MRE11, which
  generates together with CtIP and EXO1 single stranded DNA (ssDNA). The ssDNA is
  coated by RPA, which is subsequently replaced by RAD51 in a BRCA2-dependent fashion.
  RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments mediate strand invasion on the homologous sister chromatid.
  MRN (MRE11, RAD50, NBS1).
