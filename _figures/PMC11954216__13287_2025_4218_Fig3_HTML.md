caption: 'Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway in BCSCs with synthetic drugs: This
  figure depicts synthetic inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in BCSCs
  to reduce survival, proliferation, and resistance. Key agents include Everolimus
  (mTOR inhibitor) and dual inhibitors (e.g., VS-5584, NVP-BEZ235) that block both
  PI3K and mTOR, disrupting mammosphere formation and self-renewal. Other inhibitors,
  like PKI-402 and B591, enhance radiosensitivity and apoptosis in BCSCs. These targeted
  therapies inhibit essential pathways for BCSC maintenance, aiming to overcome tumor
  initiation, therapeutic resistance, and recurrence'
