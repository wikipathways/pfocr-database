caption: The cytoprotective signaling of EPCR-APC. EPCR-bound APC cleaves PAR1, and
  this PAR1 cleavage specifically activates Rac1 pathway, inhibits the activation
  of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, and provides barrier protection. Cross-activation
  of the S1P1 by sphingosine kinase-1 stimulated by EPCR-APC activation of PAR1 may
  contribute to the EPCR-APC–mediated barrier protective effect and cell survival.
  FVIIa bound to EPCR can also cleave PAR1 and provide the barrier protective effect.
  However, mechanistic details involved in the FVIIa-EPCR–induced barrier protective
  effect are unknown. In contrast to EPCR-dependent PAR1 signaling, thrombin cleavage
  of PAR1 leads to RhoA activation and activation of nuclear factor-κB, leading to
  proinflammatory gene expression and barrier disruption. Various hypotheses were
  put forth on why EPCR-APC cleavage of PAR1 leads to cytoprotective signaling, whereas
  thrombin activation of PAR1 leads to proinflammatory response. These hypotheses
  have been discussed in the text.
