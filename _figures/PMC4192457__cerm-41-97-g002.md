caption: Signaling pathway regulation of autophagy by several factors. Autophagy is
  activated by the MAPK/ERK pathway and the PI3K/AKT pathway. In particular, the mTOR
  complex is mainly activated by the MAPK/ERK pathway; however, it is inactivated
  by the accumulation of rapamycin or ROS. During the initiation step, autophagy is
  triggered by the phosphorylation of the ULK1 kinase complex, which consists of ULK1,
  Atg3, and Atg17 and is activated by stress signals from the mTOR complex 1 in damaged
  or dysfunctional cells. The activated mTOR complex phosphorylates ULK1 and Atg13,
  which represses the ULK1 complex. However, the inactivated mTOR complex dephosphorylates
  ULK1, which results in self-phosphorylation and activation of the FIP200-Atg13-ULK1
  complex, which acts as a node for integrating incoming autophagy signals into autophagosome
  formation. The activation of the Vps34 complex plays a role in the formation of
  the isolation membrane and the subsequent nucleation. Therefore, the signaling of
  autophagy is regulated by ROS or rapamycin, the AMP/ATP ratio, hypoxia, 3-MA, and
  the combination of Rubicon with the PI3K complex type 3 [,]. ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; AKT, protein-serine/threonine
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; AMPK, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; BNIP3, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3;
  AMP, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein; APT, adenosine 5'-triphosphate;

  kinase 1; FIP200, family interacting protein of 200 kD.
