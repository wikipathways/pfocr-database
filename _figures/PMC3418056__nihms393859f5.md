caption: Postulated interactions between 20-HETE and RAS in the vascular endothelium.
  20-HETE produced within the vascular wall acts on endothelial cells to uncouple
  eNOS via an EGFR-MAPK-IKKβ signaling pathway, decreasing and increasing levels of
  NO and O2−, respectively , . The activation of IKKβ through EGFR- and MAPK- dependent
  pathways also constitute the mechanism by which 20-HETE induces ACE expression,
  leading to increased ACE activity. The increase in O2− levels in response to 20-HETE
  is initially the consequence of eNOS uncoupling ,  and later the result of activation
  of NADPH oxidase , . 20-HETE may also stimulate, either directly or indirectly through
  the NF-κB-activated pathway, the expression of angiotensinogen (AGT). The induction
  of ACE alone and together with AGT can lead to increases in the vascular production
  of Ang II, which, through its interaction with AT1R, further amplifies 20-HETE actions
  on the endothelium, namely, decreases in NO bioavailability and increases in O2−
  levels, thus exacerbating endothelial dysfunction and impeding on vascular function.
