caption: 'Players of the plant UPR known to date. The diagram illustrates that in
  addition to IRE1, bZIP28 and bZIP60, also bZIP17 plays a role in the control of
  UPR target genes in Arabidopsis, as recently proposed []. A role for the beta subunit
  of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex, AGB1, in modulating the UPR has also been
  reported [,]. Furthermore, recent work has shown that NAC TFs participate to the
  plant UPR. NAC are plant-specific transcription factors, among which at least 13
  members are predicted to be membrane-anchored in Arabidopsis. In condition of stress,
  the plasma membrane NAC062/ANAC062/NTL6 relocates to the nucleus, and the overexpression
  of a protein deletion devoid of the membrane anchor leads to activation of UPR genes
  []. Another membrane-anchored NAC TF, NAC089, participates to ER stress responses
  by relocating from the ER to the nucleus and regulating PCD-related gene expression
  []. NAC089 expression is regulated by bZIP28 and bZIP60; bZIP60 also regulates directly
  the expression of NAC062. Finally the cytosolic NAC103, whose expression is directly
  regulated by bZIP60, is involved in controlling UPR gene expression []. The evidence
  that plant-specific NAC TFs have a role in stress responses support that in addition
  to common routes plants have evolved unique strategies for ER stress defense that,
  as in the case of NAC062, may also depend on the activity of TFs that are localized
  to the membrane organelles other than the ER. Interestingly also, it has been recently
  suggested that unspliced AtbZIP60 may have a role in modulating the expression of
  BiP3 in conditions of ER stress []. Phosphorylation of the elf2α may occur in a
  hypothetical PERK-like pathway for ER stress responses. See also the main text for
  additional details. TFD: transcription factor domain'
