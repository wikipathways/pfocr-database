caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanism of late PC. The PC stimulus activates
  at least 2 signaling pathways: the PKC∊-Src/Lck-NF-κB pathway and the Janus-activated
  kinase (JAK)1/JAK2-STAT1/STAT3 pathway. PKC∊ activates the Src and Lck tyrosine
  kinases, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα (the inhibitor of NF-κB); in
  addition, PKC∊ directly activates IKKα/IKKβ, leading to inhibition of IκBα. NF-κB
  translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to its cognate sequence on the promoter
  region of target genes, including iNOS and COX-2. The PC ischemia also activates
  JAK1 and JAK2, which then tyrosine phosphorylate and activate STAT1 and STAT3. In
  addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, full activation of STAT1 and STAT3 also requires
  serine phosphorylation via a PKC∊-Raf-1-MEK1/2-p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway. The
  activated STAT1/STAT3 heterodimer translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to
  the promoter of target genes. The combinatorial actions of NF-κB and STAT1/STAT3,
  and almost certainly other transcription factors, result in transcriptional activation
  of iNOS, COX-2, HO-1, and ecSOD, leading to the synthesis of the respective proteins.
  (A multitude of transcription factors are likely to be mobilized during late PC
  and to lead to the recruitment of cardioprotective genes, acting in concert.) iNOS
  produces NO, which directly protects the myocardium; in addition, NO activates COX-2,
  leading to the synthesis of cardioprotective prostanoids, mainly PGI2 and PGE2.
  It follows from this that the activity of newly synthesized COX-2 protein requires
  iNOS-dependent NO generation whereas the activity of iNOS does not require COX-2-dependent
  prostanoid generation; thus COX-2 is downstream of iNOS in the pathophysiological
  cascade of late PC. In addition, NO can also induce HO-1. Thus iNOS-derived NO can
  protect the myocardium from recurrent ischemia via direct actions, via activation
  of COX-2-dependent synthesis of cardioprotective prostanoids, and via generation
  of HO-1 by-products (CO and biliverdin). Among the products of COX-2, PGE2 and/or
  PGI2 appear to be the most likely effectors of cytoprotection. A similar upregulation
  of COX-2 can be elicited pharmacologically by δ-opioid receptor agonists but not
  by adenosine A1 or A3 receptor agonists.'
