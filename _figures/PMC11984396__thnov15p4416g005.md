caption: 'Schematic diagram depicting major neuroendocrine and autonomic pathways
  regulating secondary immune organs. This diagram illustrates the primary neuroendocrine
  and autonomic pathways involved in the regulation of secondary immune organs. The
  neuroendocrine pathways include: (1) The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,
  and (2) The sympatho-adrenal medullary (SAM) axis. The autonomic pathways consist
  of two “hardwired” circuits: (3) The sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and (4) The
  parasympathetic nervous system (PaSNS). In the HPA axis, corticotropin-releasing
  hormone (CRH) is secreted by hypothalamic neurons that project to the anterior pituitary.
  CRH stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn
  triggers the secretion of corticosterone (CORT) into the bloodstream. Circulating
  CORT has systemic effects, including modulation of secondary immune organs such
  as the spleen, LNs, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). In the SAM axis,
  preganglionic sympathetic neurons release acetylcholine (Ach) in the adrenal medulla,
  stimulating the release of catecholamines, predominantly epinephrine (EPI) and,
  to a lesser extent, norepinephrine (NE), into the bloodstream. These circulating
  catecholamines (e.g., CORT in the HPA axis) have widespread effects, potentiating
  the activity of sympathetic nerves by activating adrenergic receptors in visceral
  organs. The SNS circuit to the spleen and LNs operates as a two-neuron chain. Preganglionic
  cholinergic sympathetic neurons synapse with postganglionic neurons, whose terminals
  innervate the spleen and LNs. Postganglionic neurons primarily release NE, which
  binds to adrenergic receptors expressed on immune cells, vasculature, and connective
  tissue in secondary lymphoid organs. In the spleen, the predominant adrenergic receptor
  subtype is the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AdrR), and its activation regulates the
  immune cells'' responses. Similarly, the PaSNS also follows a two-neuron chain structure.
  Preganglionic neurons, originating in the brainstem (medulla), exit the CNS as cranial
  nerves and synapse on postganglionic neurons embedded in visceral organs, particularly
  in the gut. Although there is no conclusive evidence that the PaSNS directly innervates
  the spleen, the vagus nerve influences splenic immune responses indirectly, likely
  through its connections to the celiac ganglion (CG), where vagal and sympathetic
  preganglionic fibers converge. Abbreviations: SG, sympathetic ganglia (also classified
  as inferior cervical ganglion); SMG, superior mesenteric ganglion; AG, adrenal gland'
