caption: A schematic of the mast cell-chymase-TGF- 1 pathway responsible for adverse
  myocardial remodeling in response to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). In response
  to TAC, mast cell activators are released from myocardial cells to activate cardiac
  mast cells. Upon activation, cardiac mast cells release chymase into the interstitium
  which then activates TGF-β1. Active TGF-β1 stimulates fibroblast and myofibroblast
  cells to synthesize and secrete collagen as well as promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
  Estrogen and nedocromil prevent mast cell chymase release and chymostatin inhibits
  chymase activity. As a consequence they prevent the TAC-induced increase in TGF-β1
  and the resulting adverse cardiac remodeling.
