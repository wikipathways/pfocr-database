caption: IGF-1R trafficking routes and signaling to the mitochondria and from the
  Golgi and the Nucleus. (A) The IGF-1R translocates to the Golgi apparatus. In migratory
  cell lines, IGF-1R autophosphorylates Tyr1250/1251 in an adhesion dependent manner.
  Phosphorylation of Tyr1250/1251 IGF-1R leads to rapid IGF-1R endocytosis leads to
  activation of the MAPK pathway and results in translocation of the IGF-1R to the
  Golgi which promotes sustained SHC activation to facilitate migration. points. The
  release and retention of IGF-1R in the Golgi may be regulated by β1-Integrin and
  its interaction with the ECM. In cells with low or no migratory capacity, IGF-1R
  remains on the surface inducing signaling from the membrane. The interaction with
  other proteins, including E-cadherin, stabilizes the adhesion points and internalization
  rate of the IGF-1R is low. (B) IGF-1R translocates to the nucleus. IGF-1 binding
  to the IGF-1R induces the translocation of the membrane receptor to the nucleus.
  Various mechanisms have been proposed for the import of the IGF-1R to the nucleus.
  Nuclear IGF-1R can bind to DNA and enhance or initiate the transcription of various
  genes, leading to cell survival, migration, EMT and cell cycle progression. (C)
  IGF-1 signaling regulates mitochondrial function. The activation of the PI3-K pathway
  in response to IGF-1 induces the expression of the mitophagy regulators PGC1β and
  PRC. Inhibition of GSK-3 β by PI3-K activation leads to the release of NFE2L2/Nrf2,
  which translocates to the nucleus to enhance the expression of the mitophagy receptor
  BNIP-3. Activation of IGF1-R also enhances the expression of the UTP importer PNC-1,
  which was linked to cell growth and the reduction of ROS. Through these pathways
  IGF-1 signaling contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Figure
