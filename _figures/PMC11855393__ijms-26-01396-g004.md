  pathways such as PI3K/AKT, RAS/MAPK and others. PI3K transduces growth factor signaling
  and activates the AKT kinase, which results in the phosphorylation of the mTOR,
  leading to increased protein synthesis and cell growth. AKT activity is downregulated

  the extracellular domain of EGFR. Gefitinib, erlotinib, dacomitinib, afatinib, lapatinib,

  to the ATP-binding site of the receptor. Bevacizumab is a mAb against VEGF-A ligand.
  Ramucirumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is directed against the extracellular
  domain of VEGFR-2. Lenvatinib, sunitinib, axitinib, sorafenib, tivozanib, sunitinib
