caption: The molecular mechanisms underlying the C/EBPβ‐δ‐secretase signaling pathway
  expedite the progression of AD. The expression of δ‐secretase is regulated by the
  transcription factor C/EBPβ, which is regulated by the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway.
  δ‐secretase is phosphorylated by Akt, which inhibits its activity, and SRPK2, which
  enhances its activity. The δ‐secretase cleaves APP and promotes the production of
  Aβ. The δ‐secretase also cleaves Tau, producing fragments that are prone to aggregation.
  The tau fragment derived from δ‐secretase‐enhanced BACE1 activity, which further
  promoted the production of Aβ. δ‐secretase‐derived SET fragments inhibit tau dephosphorylation,
  while δ secretase‐derived SRPK2 fragments affect tau selective splicing. Aβ and
  APP C586‐695 (C110) fragments ultimately stimulate the transcription of genes associated
  with AD by binding to and activating C/EBPβ. All of these pathways promote tau aggregation
  and the occurrence of AD.
