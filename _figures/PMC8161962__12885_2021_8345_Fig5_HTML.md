caption: Network of gene interactions identified by IPA. The network is displayed
  graphically as nodes (genes) and edges (the biological relationships between nodes).
  The network shows that EPAS1 is an important regulator gene that controls the expression
  of multiple genes. Most of the genes within the network are associated with the
  Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Nodes coloured in red indicates upregulated expression
  while nodes coloured in green indicates downregulated expression. (QIAGEN Inc.,
