caption: Overview of the Notch signaling pathway. The Notch pathway is regulated by
  direct interactions between a ligand‐expressing cell (blue) and a receptor‐expressing
  cell (orange). Gray arrows indicate the transition of precursor Notch protein to
  the mature and transcriptionally active form. The direct binding of ligands triggers
  cleavage of the NICD, which translocates into the nucleus. The NICD activates Notch
  target genes through interactions with Rbpj and Maml1‐3. Numb is a negative regulator
  of Notch signaling that antagonizes receptors. Lfng is a beta(1‐3)N‐acetylglucosamine
  transferase that modifies Notch receptors to facilitate their activation
