caption: Metabolic reconstruction of “Ca. Methanomixophus.” The genes used to construct
  this metabolic network are listed in . Pathways for methanogenesis are depicted
  in blue, pathways for anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with sulfate reduction
  are depicted in red, and other pathways are depicted in black. The sulfate reduction
  pathway was found only in “Ca. Methanomixophus dualitatem,” whereas other pathways
  were found to be conserved in all “Ca. Methanomixophus” MAGs. FPKM values are represented
  as red bars close to the gene names, and an average FPKM value representing the
  transcribed genes was used for enzymes comprising multiple subunits. Complexes without
  proteomic evidence are depicted with dashed lines. (See  legend for definitions
  of abbreviations.)
