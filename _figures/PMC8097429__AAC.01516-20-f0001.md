caption: Ubiquinone, pyrimidines, and folate metabolism in the malaria parasite. Schematic
  representation of UQ, folate, and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways as well as the
  specific role of UQ in the mitochondrial electron transport system in Plasmodium.
  The biosynthesis of UQ and folates’ aromatic precursors by the shikimate pathway
  are also shown. The MEP pathway generates IPP or DMAPP necessary for the formation
  of longer isoprenic chains by polyprenyl synthases. The previously mentioned biosynthetic
  pathways are located in different compartments and thus here are represented in
  a single virtual space. Finally, the UQ biosynthetic pathway and its function in
  the mitochondria are indicated. UQ functions as an electron carrier for rotenone-insensitive
  NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2), dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), glycerol 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G3PDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), malate quinone oxidoreductase,
  and mitochondrial complex III.
