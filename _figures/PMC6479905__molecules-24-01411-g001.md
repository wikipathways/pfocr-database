caption: 'The major microbial Trp-dependent IAA synthesis pathways. Different pathways
  are depicted with different colors. In our study, we decompose each pathway into
  three parts: the first part represents the first step of IAA synthesis or the Trp-catalyzing
  step (dashed lines in the figure); the second part represents synthesizing IAA from
  Trp or the de novo IAA synthesis; the third part represents synthesizing IAA from
  intermediates (IPA, IAM, TPM, IAN).'
