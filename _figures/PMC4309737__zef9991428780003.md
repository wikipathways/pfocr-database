caption: Actin polymerization disrupts ovarian Hippo signaling and promotes nuclear
  YAP actions to increase downstream CCN growth factors and apoptosis inhibitors involvement
  in POI, PCOS, follicle reserve, and infertility. The Hippo serine/threonine kinase
  signaling cascade is conserved from flies to mammals to restrict tissue growth.
  Mammalian MST1 and MST2 are orthologous to the fly Hpo (Hippo) gene. MST1/2, acting
  in concert with Sav1, phosphorylates downstream LATS1/2 to suppress YAP and TAZ
  actions by phosphorylating YAP and TAZ, leading to the degradation of phospho-YAP/TAZ
  after binding to cytoplasmic 14–3-3 proteins. Ovarian fragmentation induces actin
  polymerization (conversion of G-actin to F-actin) and disruption of the Hippo signaling
  pathway, leading to decreases in YAP phosphorylation and increased nuclear levels
  of YAP (). Nuclear YAP interacts with cotranscriptional factors TEAD1/2/3/4 to stimulate
  the expression of downstream CCN growth factors and BIRC apoptosis inhibitors, leading
  to cell proliferation. Genomic and genetic studies underscore the important roles
  of the ovarian Hippo signaling pathway. DIAPH genes are important for actin polymerization.
  Disruption of DIAPH2 has been found in a familiar case of POI (), whereas this gene
  is also important for ovarian reserve in a genome-wide association study (). Likewise,
  DIAPH3 has been implicated in regulating ovarian reserve in a genome-wide association
  study (). For Hippo pathway genes, LATS1 deletion in mice leads to infertility and
  ovarian tumorigenesis (), whereas LATS1 regulates the activity of FOXL2 (), a gene
  defective in some POI patients. Genome-wide association studies also implicate the
  Hippo effector gene YAP in PCO patients (), whereas overexpression of YAP was found
  in ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) tumors (). For downstream genes, conditional
  deletion of CCN2 in granulosa cells leads to subfertility (), whereas gene copy
  changes for the BIRC1 apoptosis inhibitor gene is associated with POI in patients
  ().

    involvement in POI, PCOS, follicle reserve, and infertility. The Hippo serine/threonine
