caption: 'a | Entry-associated disassembly. Viruses must disassemble their capsid
  to release their genome. Members of the Polyomaviridae disassemble their capsid
  by co-opting components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation
  (ERAD) pathway. To cause infection, polyomaviruses undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis
  and traffic to the ER (step 1). Once at the ER, they use protein disulfide isomerase
  (PDI)-family members to isomerize and reduce viral disulfide bonds (step 2). These
  events partially disassemble the virus particles to form hydrophobic viruses that
  engage binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) through the activity of ER DNAJ domain-containing
  protein 3 (ERDJ3; step 3). 170 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP170) then releases
  polyomavirus from BiP, enabling the hydrophobic virus to insert into the ER membrane
  (step 4). The membrane-inserted virus reorganizes selective ER membrane proteins
  (B cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) and the J proteins DNAJ homologue
  subfamily B member 12 (DNAJB12), DNAJB14 and DNAJ C18) in the lipid bilayer to form
  foci (step 5). The membrane-attached cytosolic extraction machinery (heat shock
  cognate protein 70 (HSC70)–heat shock protein 105 (HSP105)–small glutamine-rich
  tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein-α (SGTA)) then ejects the virus from
  the foci into the cytosol in a reaction that simultaneously disassembles the virus
  (step 6). Cytosolic disassembly enables the resulting core virus particle to move
  into the nucleus to cause infection. b | Genome translation. Some viruses exploit
  the ER-associated biosynthetic machinery to translate their genetic code in two
  ways: the translation of viral structural proteins that are incorporated into virions
  (for example, the envelope glycoprotein of HIV and haemagglutinin of influenza A
  virus (IAV)) and the translation of viral non-structural proteins that promote the
  subsequent viral replication step. This is evident during translation of the positive-sense
  RNA ((+)RNA) genome of viruses in the Flaviviridae (hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue
  virus (DENV) and West Nile virus WNV) and Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)) families, in which the newly synthesized replication
  proteins target to sites of virus replication on the ER (or ER-derived) membrane
  compartments in preparation for replication. At these sites, the physical architecture
  of the ER membrane effectively acts as a scaffold to recruit the viral replication
  proteins.'
