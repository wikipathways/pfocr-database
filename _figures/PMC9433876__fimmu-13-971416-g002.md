caption: Cell type-dependent Hippo-YAP pathway regulate the inflammation response
  after Myocardial infarction. Cardiomyocyte-specific YAP inhibits inflammatory cells
  infiltration, including macrophages and neutrophils, and pro-inflammatory cytokines
  production through interacting with TLRs (toll-like receptors), thus improve cardiac
  function. Epicardial-specific YAP increases Tregs (T-regulatory cells) recruitment
  to inhibit macrophage infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines production through
  affecting IFN-γ (interferon γ) expression. Macrophage-specific knockdown of YAP
  decreases the accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages and enhances the accumulation
  of anti-inflammatory macrophages through regulating the expression of Spp1 (secreted
  phosphoprotein 1), IL6 (interleukin 6), ARG1 (arginase 1), CD163 to improve cardiac
  function. Cardiac fibroblast-specific knockdown of YAP inhibits fibroinflammatory
  response to decrease the recruitment of inflammatory cells, the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and improve heart function. CSF1, colony stimulating factor 1; CXCL1,
  C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 1; CXCL12, C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12; PRRs, pattern
  recognition receptors.
