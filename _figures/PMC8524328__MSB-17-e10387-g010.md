caption: 'The network structure of the diagrams and their interactions based on existing
  crosstalk (shared elements), candidate crosstalk, and candidate regulators. Colour
  code: green—pathways or pathway groups; blue—proteins with one or two neighbours;
  yellow—proteins with three or four neighbours; and red—proteins with five or more
  neighbours. Candidate molecular interactions are shown as directed edges. Candidate
  regulator elements are marked with a solid black border. See Materials and Methods
  for details. Existing crosstalk between individual diagrams of IFN‐I and RELA‐related
  mechanisms.Candidate crosstalk between pathway groups.Candidate regulators of existing
  diagrams from text mining and interaction databases.'
