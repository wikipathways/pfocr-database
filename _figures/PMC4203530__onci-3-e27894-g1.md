caption: Figure 1. TLR9-dependent “emergency” signaling restores STAT3 activity in
  the tumor microenvironment, thereby accelerating cancer recurrence after radiation
  therapy. (A) Multiple cytokines, growth factors, and sphingolipids promote the activity
  of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs) upon the engagement of JAK and SRC kinases. STAT3 is a critical
  mediator of the pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive activities of myeloid cells
  in the tumor microenvironment. (B) High-dose radiation therapy results in the death
  of most malignant cells, hence mediating robust therapeutic effects. However, danger
  signals delivered by dying cells can generate an “emergency” cue to restore STAT3
  activity. In particular, the activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) results in
  the activation of a myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88)- and NF-κB-dependent
  signaling pathway that promotes the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6 and hence the
  activation of JAK/STAT3 signaling in freshly recruited TAMs. Active STAT3 drives
  a transcriptional program which promotes the pro-angiogenic functions of TAMs, hence
  supporting tumor recurrence.
