caption: General scheme of insulin signaling. Insulin binding to its receptor activates
  the receptor tyrosine kinase activity. This leads to autophosphorylation of the
  receptor and recruitment and phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)
  proteins. Subsequently, other signaling molecules such as PI3-kinase (PI3K) and
  GRB2 are recruited, which leads to the activation of the Akt signaling pathway (which
  mediates many metabolic effects) and the MAP kinase pathway (which mediates cell
  proliferation), respectively. Insulin binding also leads to receptor internalization
  into endosomes. From endosomes, receptors can recycle back to the plasma membrane
  or traffic via multivesicular bodies to the lysosome for degradation. Phosphorylated
  IRS and the IRS-PI3K complex are signaling molecules that can be inactivated by
  degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Receptor internalization and
  trafficking between the endosome and lysosome has been shown to be dependent on
  ubiquitylation for other receptor tyrosine kinases, but the requirement for UBIQ
  (ubiquitin) in the case of the insulin receptor remains speculative. In some adipocyte
  cell lines, the ubiquitin protein ligase CBLB (Cbl-b) has been implicated in mediating
  translocation of the GTR4 (GLUT4) glucose transporter to the plasma membrane via
  a RHOQ (Tc10)-dependent pathway.
