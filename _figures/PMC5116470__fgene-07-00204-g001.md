caption: Schematic representation of some of the known pathways linking DDR to autophagy.
  In response to DNA damage, ATM is autophosphorylated within a MRN multiprotein complex
  that binds DSBs. Activated ATM initiates a pathway that results in activation of
  AMPK and its target TSC2 which functions as inhibitor of TORC1. As ULK1-dependent
  autophagosome formation is negatively regulated by TORC1, this ATM pathway induces
  autophagy. In addition, ATM directly phosphorylates and stabilizes p53 which transcriptionally
  regulates various regulators of the autophagic pathway including AMPK, DAPK and
  PTEN. Sestrins, which are regulated by p53, influence TORC1 activity in an AMPK-dependent
  and AMPK-independent manner, the latter through a GATOR2-GATOR1-RAGB/A signaling
  pathway (see text for details). The ATM-mediated phosphorylation and activation
  of the RNA polymerase II-binding protein Che-1, leads to increased transcription
  of two mTOR inhibitors, Redd1 and Deptor. ATM contributes to the activation of a
  NEMO-dependent TAK1-ATM-NEMO-NFκB pathway that transcriptionally modulates Beclin-1.
  TAK1 may also mediate activation of JNK which in turn phosphorylates Beclin-1 and
  releases it from the inhibitory effect of BCL-2 or BCL-XL. DNA damage also blocks
  transcription of the JNK phosphatase MKP-1, releasing its inhibitory effect over
  JNK which in turn induces autophagy. PARP1 activation in response to DNA damage
  leads to reduction in both NAD+ and ATP pools, with the latter causing activation
  of AMPK and induction of autophagy. The DDR-autophagy axis has major implications
  for DNA damage repair, senescence, cell survival versus death, cytokine secretion
  and modulation of the immune response (see text for details). Black arrows (↑) and
  perpendicular lines (⊥) denote activation and suppression, respectively. Red arrows
  denote transcriptional regulation.
