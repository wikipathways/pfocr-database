caption: Putative synaptic mechanisms of (2R,6R)- and (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine.
  (2R,6R)- HNK acts on the presynaptic terminal to increase glutamate release, possibly
  via signaling mechanisms convergent with mGlu2, whereby (2R,6R)-HNK disinhibits
  the mGlu2-induced cAMP release, or via another glutamate release mechanism. Subsequent
  to enhanced glutamate release, AMPAR activation leads to enhanced BDNF release,
  TrkB activation, and subsequent activation of plasticity-relevant signal cascades,
  including an increase in protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular signal–related kinases
  (ERK)/mitogen-activated proteain kinases (MAPK), and mTORC1 pathway activity. These
  signaling cascades result in protein synthesis, including increased AMPAR expression,
  and synaptogenesis, ultimately promoting enhanced synaptic strength. (2R,6R)-HNK
  may also disrupt TrkB/AP-2 interactions, thereby inhibiting TrkB endocytosis and
  enhancing TrkB stability at the synapse. Additionally, (2S,6S)-HNK has moderate
  affinity to inhibit NMDARs and may act to increase intracellular signal cascades
  via an NMDAR inhibition–dependent pathway, including inhibition of eEF2 signaling
  in addition to increased AKT, ERK/MAPK, and mTORC1 signaling.
