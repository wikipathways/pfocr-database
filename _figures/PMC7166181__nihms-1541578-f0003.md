caption: 'Schematic of Signaling Pathways Regulated by PI3K/Akt/mTOR that Promote
  Neuritogenesis: A variety of ligands lead to neurite initiation and elongation through
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. Signaling through both TrkA/TrkB receptors leads to activation
  of PI3K and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of Akt. Akt then activates
  Cdc42 and Rac1 which modify the cytoskeleton and lead to neurite initiation. Signaling
  through RTKs and GPCRs as well as inhibition of ROCK1 activates PI3K. Subsequent
  phosphorylation and activation of Akt leads phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3β,
  which decreases the phosphorylation of MAP2 increasing microtubule polymerization.
  Inhibition of GSK3β also leads to activation of APC which leads to microtubule assembly.
  Together, these downstream targets of GSK3β lead to neurite elongation. Akt also
  activates Tau which increases microtubule stability and results in neurite elongation.
  Akt also phosphorylates mTOR which promotes neurite elongation and forms a complex
  with Sin1 and Rictor which together feedback onto Akt allowing it to phosphorylate
  its targets with maximum efficiency. RTK= receptor tyrosine kinase, GPCR= G-protein
  coupled receptor, ATF3= activating transcription factor 3, Atorvastatin= inducer
  of neurite formation, WISP2/CCN5= WNT1-inducible-signlaing pathway protein 2'
