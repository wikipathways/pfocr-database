caption: Schematic diagram shows two pathways that cause dementia [specifically Alzheimer's
  disease (AD)]. Vascular factors (stroke, hypertension, diabetes, etc.) and genetic
  factors (such as APOE4) cause defects in the vascular system leading to blood–brain
  barrier (BBB) impairment and oligemia (reduced cerebral blood flow), which finally
  correlate with dementia and neuronal degeneration. In the amyloid-beta (Aβ)-independent
  pathway (blue), vascular and genetic factors cause BBB breakdown and the secretion
  of neurotoxins from one side and oligemia from the other side. While in the Aβ-dependent
  pathway (green), the first BBB breakage impairs Aβ clearance and the amyloid precursor
  protein (APP), resulting in the accumulation of Aβ in the brain. Vascular hypoperfusion
  and Aβ phosphorylate tau (p-tau) that forms neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Finally,
  both pathways cause neurodegeneration/synaptic impairment/neuronal damage leading
  to dementia (specifically AD).
