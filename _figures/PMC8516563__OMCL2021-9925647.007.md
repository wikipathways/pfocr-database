caption: Graphical abstract. Bupivacaine may cause neuronal oxidative DNA damage.
  Damaged DNA activates a largely unknown repair mechanism. Our study showed that
  XPD is closely involved in repairing bupivacaine-induced oxidative DNA damage in
  neurons. Notably, XPD may be partially regulated by the PI3K/AKT pathway.
