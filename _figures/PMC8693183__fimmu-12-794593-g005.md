caption: Alterations of IL-6 Signalling pathway in the gill transcriptome of rainbow
  trout exposed to the high dose of P. parvum with high phenotypic response (HH group)
  in relation to the non-exposed control fish (C group). The pathway was identified
  as significant (Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction p-value < 0.001)
  and activated (z-score ≥ 2) by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Among 126 genes
  that constitute the pathway, 26 were significantly altered by P. parvum exposure
  (yielding the gene ratio of 0.206), including 23 genes upregulated (in red) and
  3 genes downregulated (in green). The upregulated genes were CEBPB, CCAAT enhancer
  binding protein beta; FOS, Fos proto-oncogene; AP-1 transcription factor subunit;
  HRAS, HRas proto-oncogene; GTPase; IL1B, interleukin 1 beta; IL1R2, interleukin
  1 receptor type 2; IL1RAPL1, interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein like 1; IL1RAPL2,
  interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein like 2; IL6R, interleukin 6 receptor; IL8/CXCL8,
  C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8; JUN, Jun proto-oncogene; AP-1 transcription factor
  subunit; LBP, lipopolysaccharide binding protein; MAP4K4, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinase kinase 4; MCL1, MCL1 apoptosis regulator; BCL2 family member;
  NFKBIA, NFKB inhibitor alpha; PIK3R5, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit
  5; RAP2B, RAP2B; member of RAS oncogene family; RASD1, ras related dexamethasone
  induced 1; SOCS1, suppressor of cytokine signalling 1; SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine
  signalling 3; SOS1, SOS RasRac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1; SRF, serum
  response factor; TRAF6, TNF receptor associated factor 6 and VEGFA, vascular endothelial
  growth factor A. The downregulated genes were IKBKAP/ELP1, elongator acetyltransferase
  complex subunit 1; MAPK13, mitogen-activated protein kinase 13 and TNFAIP6, TNF
  alpha induced protein 6. For details see ,  and .
