caption: Schematic representation of LPA-LPAR1/3 Gαi2–mediated activation of p130Cas
  in cell migration. LPA stimulates the phosphorylation at Tyr-410 of p130Cas via
  Gαi2 in a Src-dependent pathway, and p130Cas is critically required for LPA-mediated
  invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells. The blue arrows indicate the results
  derived from previous studies (see text), whereas the black arrows indicate the
  results obtained from the present study. Taken together with the previous findings,
  it can be envisioned that LPA, through distinct LPA receptors, regulates the coordinated
  signaling of spatially and/or temporally compartmentalized Gαi2-p130Cas–mediated
  stimulation of Rac as well as Gα13-Rho-GEF–mediated activation of Rho to promote
  invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells.
