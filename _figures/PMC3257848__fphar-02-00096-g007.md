caption: Two views of aerobic glycolysis. The classic view depicts pyruvate as the
  glycolytic pathway’s end-product (green arrows, left panel) and thus as the pathway
  that should not be affected by an LDH inhibitor such as malonate in supplying pyruvate
  to mitochondria. The results shown in Figures  and  cannot be explained by this
  view. The alternative view of the aerobic glycolytic pathway postulates lactate
  to be its end-product (green arrows, right panel, Schurr, ). Since glycolytically
  produced lactate must be converted to pyruvate to allow the latter to enter the
  TCA cycle, this alternative view explains the ability of malonate to interfere with
  glucose-supported neuronal function as shown in Figure  (right side histograms).
  However, over time, malonate’s weaker inhibiting activity of the reaction converting
  pyruvate to lactate shifts the glycolytic conversion of glucose from lactate to
  pyruvate until the latter becomes the main glycolytic end-product and the mitochondrial
  substrate (broken arrow, right panel), relieving the suppression of neuronal function
  observed earlier when glucose is the energy substrate (Figure ).
