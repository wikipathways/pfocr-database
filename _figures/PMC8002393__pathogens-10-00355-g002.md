caption: Overview of the HA-specific B cell response in a draining lymph node after
  administration of vaccine with squalene-based emulsion (SE) adjuvant. SE adjuvants
  promote antigen transport to lymph nodes by monocyte-derived cells. These cells,
  which cross sinus linings to enter lymph node parenchyma, have the potential to
  deliver intact antigen and also to serve as highly efficient antigen-presenting
  cells for CD4 T cell activation. Free lymph-borne antigen enters lymph node parenchyma
  via multiple routes such as trapping by subcapsular sinus macrophages and transfer
  for memory CD4 T cell activation or recognition by memory B cells (MBCs) and naïve
  B cells. Direct antigen transfer across lymphatic endothelial cells into lymph nodes
  also occurs. Abundant antigen availability in draining lymph nodes after administration
  with SE adjuvants diminishes B cell competition (for example, between MBCs and naïve
  B cells) for cognate antigen required for activation. MBCs and naïve B cells that
  “see” cognate antigen receive T cell help to drive activation and proliferation.
  Pathway options for activated B cells (A, red arrows) include (i) formation of extrafollicular
  antibody-secreting cells (ASCs); (ii) formation of extrafollicular MBCs; and (iii)
  entry into germinal center (GC) reactions. After maturation of immunoglobulin V
  region genes in GCs, GC B cells “test” their receptor affinity by competing for
  antigen held by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Successful acquisition of antigen
  from FDCs enables GC B cells to be stimulated by T cells and to repeat the maturation/selection
  cycle or differentiate into MBCs or antibody-secreting plasma cells and exit the
  GC (B, dark red arrows). The abundant free antigen in the lymph node is shuttled
  to FDCs, reducing the stringency of GC B cell selection after somatic mutation.
  In addition, strong CD4 T cell activation and formation of T follicular helper (TFH)
  cells promoted by SE adjuvants increases the availability of help for GC B cells
  and facilitates selection. Overall, SE adjuvants enhance the activation and affinity
  maturation of naïve B cells.
