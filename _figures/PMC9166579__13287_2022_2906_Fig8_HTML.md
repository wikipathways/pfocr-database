caption: 'Schematic diagram of the extracellular and intracellular mechanisms of hAMSCs-derived
  DKK-3, DKK-1, and IGFBP3 effect on the activation of HSCs. A Activated HSCs: The
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is in the activated state (on). The Wnts act on
  the FZD/LRP complex on the surfaces of HSCs. Wnt-Fzd and LRP coordinate the Dvl
  activation, leading to the recruitment of axin to the plasma membrane. Activated
  Dvl then dissociates the multiprotein complex consisting of axin, APC, CK1α, and
  GSK3β, resulting in the inactivation of GSK3β, which can no longer phosphorylate
  the β-catenin. Excess free β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, causing activation
  of HSCs. The IGF-1R/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is also activated in the activated
  state. B Quiescent HSCs: hAMSCs-secreted Dkk-1 and Dkk-3, two antagonists of Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway, are capable of suppressing the binding of Wnt ligands to FZD
  receptors and LRP co-receptors. β-catenin is assembled and phosphorylated by the
  destruction complex to be further ubiquitinated (Ub) for proteasomal degradation.
  IGFBP-3 secreted by hAMSCs can inhibit IGF1R/PI3K/AKT signaling by sequestering
  IGF1, resulting in the activation of GSK3β and GSK3β signaling.'
