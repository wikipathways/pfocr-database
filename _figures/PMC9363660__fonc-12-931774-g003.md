caption: MEKi-associated cell intrinsic effects in selected immune cell types. MEKi
  leads to transient suppressed proliferation and cytokine production, e.g., IFNγ
  and IL-2, in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through prolonged TCR signaling blockade. Infiltration,
  cytotoxicity and cytokine release upon (re-)stimulation however appear normal. Tumor-infiltrating
  CD8+ T cells showed MEKi-induced increased expression of the transcription factors
  T-bet and Eomes leading to accumulation of more potent tumor-antigen-specific CD8+
  T effector cells. Transient MEKi-associated cell-cycle progression halt leads to
  generation of metabolically enhanced T memory stem cells (TSCM), which give rise
  to potent and robust CD8+ T effector cells upon restimulation. Lower expression
  of PD-1 was observed in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, suggesting these cells
  being less prone to exhaustion and inhibition. MEK inhibition disrupts chronic BCR
  signaling in Breg resulting in diminished expression of suppressive surface molecules
  and reduction of Breg numbers removing inhibitory action on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
  MEKi treatment of NK cells does not impair viability, even at high MEKi concentrations.
  However, proliferation, expression of activation markers and cytolytic capacities
  are significantly reduced. Cell cycle progression and cellular survival mediated
  through activated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is regulated
  by the MAPK pathway. MEKi disrupts RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK dependent M2 polarization and
  shifts macrophages towards p38 MAPK dependent M1 polarization. MEKi can restore
  production of IL-12 and TNF in DCs reversing tumor-induced downregulation of costimulatory
  molecules and activation status. MEKi-associated reduction of IL-6 expression by
  tumor and stromal cells restores expression of costimulatory molecules, activation
  markers, antigen presenting receptor CD1a and functionality. In MDSCs, MEK inhibition
  with subsequent prevention of ERK phosphorylation led to strongly reduced accumulation
  in the tumor microenvironment by inhibiting cell expansion and promoting apoptosis.
  Furthermore, MEKi can abrogate cytokine-induced MDSC expansion.

  description: MEKi-associated cell intrinsic effects in selected immune cell types.
    MEKi leads to transient suppressed proliferation and cytokine production, e.g.,
    IFNγ and IL-2, in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through prolonged TCR signaling blockade.
    Infiltration, cytotoxicity and cytokine release upon (re-)stimulation however
    appear normal. Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells showed MEKi-induced increased expression
    of the transcription factors T-bet and Eomes leading to accumulation of more potent
    tumor-antigen-specific CD8+ T effector cells. Transient MEKi-associated cell-cycle
    progression halt leads to generation of metabolically enhanced T memory stem cells
    (TSCM), which give rise to potent and robust CD8+ T effector cells upon restimulation.
    Lower expression of PD-1 was observed in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, suggesting
    these cells being less prone to exhaustion and inhibition. MEK inhibition disrupts
    chronic BCR signaling in Breg resulting in diminished expression of suppressive
    surface molecules and reduction of Breg numbers removing inhibitory action on
    CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. MEKi treatment of NK cells does not impair viability, even
    at high MEKi concentrations. However, proliferation, expression of activation

    and cellular survival mediated through activated eukaryotic translation initiation
    factor 4E (eIF4E) is regulated by the MAPK pathway. MEKi disrupts RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK
    dependent M2 polarization and shifts macrophages towards p38 MAPK dependent M1
