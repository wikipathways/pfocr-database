caption: Models for the action of Ssk1p and Skn7p in C. lusitaniae and comparison
  with simplified models for S. cerevisiae () and C. albicans (, , ). A possible mechanism
  that incorporates our experimental results from this study and our previous study
  () is proposed. The RR protein Ssk1p could operate downstream of the Sln1p HKR and
  the HPt protein Ypd1p to regulate the osmotic stress response, pseudohyphal growth,
  UV adaptation, and the heat shock response. Genes encoding Ssk2p, Pbs2p, and Hog1p
  mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade components (dotted boxes) are located in
  the C. lusitaniae genome (unpublished data) and probably act downstream of Ssk1p.
  In addition, the Nik1p-Ypd1p-Ssk1p-mediated transduction pathway probably regulates
  dicarboximide (Dicarb.) and phenylpyrrole (Phenylp.) sensitivity. The RR protein
  Skn7p acts in oxidative stress adaptation, possibly through Sln1p and Ypd1p elements.
  Dotted arrows indicate mechanisms or interactions not yet fully elucidated. MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinase.
