caption: Summary and working model. Tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV is triggered by
  ligands for either RTKs (i.e. EGFR) or GPCRs (i.e. LPA receptor). Activation of
  non-RTKs (i.e. Src) downstream of both classes of receptors can also phosphorylate
  GIV on identical tyrosines (). Tyrosine-phosphorylated GIV directly binds p85α and
  activates Class 1 PI3Ks, which in turn activate Akt. SHP-1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase
  is activated downstream of both RTKs and GPCRs. Activated SHP-1 is known to bind
  and dephosphorylate the autophosphorylation site(s) on the cytoplasmic tail of EGFR
  (, ) and is known to effectively dephosphorylate substrates of Src kinase (). Here
  we demonstrate that SHP-1 binds and dephosphorylates GIV, prevents the formation
  of GIV-p85α(PI3K) complexes, and thereby inhibits activation of Akt via the GIV-PI3K
  axis.
