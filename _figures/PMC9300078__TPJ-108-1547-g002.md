caption: Scheme summarizing the expression of Lotus japonicus genes involved in fatty
  acid metabolism in B– (left) and B+ (right) mycorrhizal roots.Color of the arrows
  indicates the regulation of genes involved in the pathway in the two comparisons
  (B− Myc versus NoMyc and B+ Myc versus NoMyc). Dashed lines indicate processes for
  which a specific gene has not been identified, or which expression is not known
  according to the present RNA‐seq dataset (such as RAM2). Briefly, while symbiosis‐specific
  genes, such as FatM and the transporter STR2 seem to be upregulated both in the
  presence or absence of CaGg, the upstream production of free fatty acids seems to
  be only weakly activated in its absence. As citrate cycle, which produces acetyl‐CoA,
  is upregulated in B+ Myc versus B− Myc, such input required by the pathway may also
  be reduced in B− Myc cells. One potential effect of a reduced carbon flux from the
  plant to the B– fungus may be already observable in the intraradical mycelium, where
  betain‐lipid metabolism and phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), as well as cellular respiration,
  are already weakly activated, when compared with the B+ fungus. Such impairment
  would be reflected on second‐generation spores, which, as already observed (Lumini
  et al., ; Salvioli et al., ), have less lipid storage and produce less ATP upon
  germination. ACP, acyl‐carrier protein; CoA, coenzyme A; MAG, monoacylglycerol.
