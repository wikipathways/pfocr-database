caption: 'Schematic diagram of in vitro liver organoid model creation. Various cell
  types (induced by pluripotent cells, hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and adult stem
  cells or Lgr5+ liver stem cells) are the primary cell sources commonly used to generate
  organoids. Excised or biopsy specimens from humans (healthy or diseased patients)
  are used to obtain cells for organoid growth by incubating them with various signaling
  factors. Abbreviations: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; BMP, bone morphogenic protein;
  Wnt, noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor;
  HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; TGF, transforming
  growth factor; ROCK, ROCK signaling pathway regulates cell morphology; BDM, 2,3-butanedione
  monoxime; OSM, oncostatin M; STH, somatotropin; HCM, hepatocyte culture medium;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; DEX, dexamethasone'
