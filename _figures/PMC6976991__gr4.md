caption: 'Concurrent activation and inactivation of three critical intersecting cellular
  signaling pathways in Chip-KO mouse hepatocytes: (i) Activation of the injurious
  CYP2E1-ROS-JNK-signaling pathway resulting in activation of ROS-elicited ASK1-JNK1-c-Jun-
  and ASK1-JNK1-ATF2-signaling pathways with consequent nuclear pc-Jun-pATF2-heterodimerization
  and the transcriptional up-regulation of pro-inflammatory factors/cytokines, and
  proapoptotic Ache-expression. The CYP2E1-dependent steps inhibited by its diagnostic
  inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole (4MP) are indicated by red stop-lines. (ii) Suppressed
  insulin-signaling via activated pJNK-1 phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate
  1 (IRS-1) at Ser307, thereby impairing insulin–insulin receptor (InsR)-mediated
  IRS-1 activation via Tyr895-phosphorylation and ushering insulin resistance. Furthermore,
  CYP2E1-generated ROS would also inactivate Akt via oxidation, thereby impairing
  AktS473-phosphorylation required for effective insulin-signaling. (iii) Beneficial
  activation of the adiponectin-AMPK-FOXO signaling pathways by virtue of liver kinase
  B1 (LKB1) and AMP-kinase (AMPK1α) being CHIP-substrates that are stabilized upon
  Chip-KO and CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress that activates AMPK1α leading to the
  activation via C-terminal phosphorylation of the FOXO transcriptional factors. Intranuclear
  import of phosphorylated FOXOs and subsequent upregulation of energy, lipid metabolism,
  lipophagic, autophagic and oxidative stress resistance genes and elevation of hepatic
  adiponectin receptors AdipoR1/AdipoR2 genes that would enhance hepatic adiponectin
  signaling thus further feed-forwarding the ROS-counteracting adiponectin-AMPK-FOXO
  signaling, at the least during the initial 2–4 months of age. Additionally, enhanced
  adiponectin-AMPK-signaling also increases the activity of its diagnostic probe,
  acetyl CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2), thereby attenuating malonyl CoA production, derepressing
  carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 activity, and stimulating mitochondrial FA uptake
  and β-oxidation. With age progression (>9 months), the persistent oxidative stress,
  JNK1 activation, ATF2-mediated mitochondrial disruption, inflammation and central
  venous congestion trigger nuclear pyknosis and hepatocyte ballooning causing the
  adiponectin-AMPK-FOXO signaling to wane and vanish altogether within 12 months of
  age, thus enabling the manifestation of overt macrovesicular steatosis and other
  NASH-hallmarks.'
