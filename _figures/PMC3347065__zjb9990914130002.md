caption: 'VapC regulation of the major glycerol-utilizing pathways identified in M.
  smegmatis. The schematic diagram indicates the glycerol-utilizing pathways present
  in M. smegmatis. The numbers in red represent gene expression ratios determined
  by microarray analysis in response to VapC expression. The black numbers represent
  gene expression ratios of selected genes involved in glycerol metabolism obtained
  through comparison of ΔvapBC deletion mutant mRNA levels with M. smegmatis mc2155
  as determined by qRT-PCR (see ). Two pathways for glycerol metabolism are represented
  and have been assembled based on putative roles for genes annotated in M. smegmatis
  genome. Pathway 1 indicates glycerol utilization mediated by an ATP-dependent glycerol
  kinase and a glycerol dehydrogenase. A second pathway (pathway 2) requires a glycerol
  dehydrogenase and dihydroxyacetone kinase to convert glycerol to dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (DHA-P). A parallel branch in pathway 2 dehydrates glycerol by a coenzyme
  B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase to synthesize propanediol derivatives. The genes
  and the proteins they encode are as follows: glpF, glycerol uptake facilitator;
  glpK, glycerol kinase; glpD, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; dhaF, glycerol
  uptake facilitator; dhaKLM, DHA kinase; dhaB, glycerol dehydratase; dhaT, NADH-dependent
  1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. Abbreviations: G-3-P, glycerol-3-phosphate; DHA,
  dihydroxyacetone; 3- and 2-HPA, 3- and 2-hydroxypropionaldehyde; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle. All gene expression ratios shown for individual genes are statistically
  significant (P value of <0.05), with the exception of glpF qRT-PCR value 1.58 (P
  value of 0.17). The average gene expression ratios of the 4 downregulated genes
  (MSMEG_1546 to MSMEG_1549) are shown for dhaB.'
