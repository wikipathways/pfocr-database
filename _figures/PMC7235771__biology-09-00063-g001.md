caption: NGF and TrkA binding, just as BDNF and TrkB, leads to dimerization and autophosphorylation
  of receptors at tyrosine residues. This activates adapter proteins such as SHC,
  GRB2, GAB1, which ultimately lead to activation of the main signaling pathways.
  SHC activation involves the Ras-MAPK signaling system, activation of GRB2 and GAB1
  mediates signaling along the PI3K-Akt pathway. In addition, phosphorylation of the
  tyrosine residue 816 TrkB initiates PLC-γ activity, whereby the transcription factor
  CREB is phosphorylated by CAMKII. Moreover, the signaling that originates from TrkB
  can activate the Rho family, which leads to the activation of the Rho-associated
  protein kinase (ROCK), which subsequently leads to activation of the Akt pathway.
