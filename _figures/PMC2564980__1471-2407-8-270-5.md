caption: Genes with differential expression in the carcinoma and papillary adenocarcinoma
  tumors were assembled into distinct metabolic pathways. KEGG pathway analysis was
  performed using DAVID software. Light gray background – significantly (P < 0.05)
  higher expression in carcinoma; gray background – no significant difference; black
  background – significantly (P < 0.05) higher expression in papillary adenocarcinoma;
  frame around background – over twofold difference. The underlined letters C (carcinoma)
  or P (papillary adenocarcinoma) which follow the gene name indicate an exclusive
  effect in one of the two tumor phenotypes compared to the mammary gland. The direction
  of the arrows indicates the type of change (up- or downregulation). One arrow –
  statistically significant (P < 0.05) difference. Two arrows – statistically significant
  and over twofold difference.

  and the highly differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma in mammary glands support
