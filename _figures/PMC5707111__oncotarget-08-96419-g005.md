caption: (A–B) Normal structure of lung and alveoli. (C) HPV DNA enters the lung epithelial
  cells through blood vessels and pulmonary lumina. (D) HPVs are recognized by membrane
  receptors, and viral DNA is integrated into the host cells. (E) The expression of
  HPV E6 and E7 oncogene proteins plays an important role in carcinogenesis. HPV E6
  inhibits p53 interaction with DDX3, following p21 inactivation. Thus, the complex
  cyclin A/CDK2 is free to phosphorylate pRb, which promotes cell proliferation, and
  the E2F transcription factor is released and determines the cell cycle and G1/S
  transition. E7 HPV resolves the HDAC/pRb/E2F complex by interacting with pRb. Hence,
  HDAC is released to hypermethylate p16INK4 and inhibits the expression of p16INK4,
  which leads to tumor progression. HDAC can also cause angiogenesis induced by VEGF
  and IL-8 through HIF-1α. HPV E7 and inactivated p53 by HPV E6 can up-regulate Mcl-1
  through the PI3K/Akt-(IL-6)-(IL-17) pathway, resulting in anti-apoptosis.
