  Pathway 1—The binding of IFN-γ to the INF-γ receptor activates the JAK-STAT signaling
  cascade. Dysfunctional IFN-1 signaling is directly related to determining the characteristics
  of the immune inflammatory environment of PCa. However, phosphatase and tensin homolog
  (PTEN) antagonize the pro-growth PI3K signaling pathway of PCa mediated through
  the ARF–MDM2–p53 axis. Pathway 2—Granzymes and perforin are packaged into cytotoxic
  T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. When cells bind to target cells, these
  proteins are released where perforin mediates the influx of granzymes through the
  formation of pores in the target cell membrane. The granzyme causes increased production
  of reactive oxygen species and release of cytochrome C by mitochondria, which activate
  caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways including Cas3 and Cas8. Pathway 3—Tumor recognition
  leads to activation of T cells and upregulation of Fas and FasL on the surface of
  T cells, activating the Cas8.3 cascade and ultimately apoptosis; pathway 4—TNFR1
  initiates an extracellular signal by binding to “death receptors”. FAS and TRAIL
  are examples of these messengers that trigger the extrinsic apoptosis pathway; they
  bind to the TRAILR or FASR receptors, causing changes in the intracellular domain
  of the receptor. With these alterations, an intracellular protein FADD (Fas-associated
  death domain protein) is activated. It then interacts with two additional proteins,
  pro-caspase-8 and pro-caspase-10, which initiate the process of cell death. Pathway
  5—Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) prevents the synthesis of pro-inflammatory chemokines
  and TNF-α and IFN-γ, leading to a reduction in invasion, proliferation, and migration
