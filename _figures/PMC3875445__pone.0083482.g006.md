caption: A. In tumour cells, positively charged RNase A binds with negatively charged
  tumour tissue (due to the presence of anion phosphatidylserine residues on the surface
  of tumour blood vessels) and penetrate into the cells. RNase A-mediated increase
  in miRNA levels in tumour cells may be a result of the activity of RNase A or its
  proteolytic fragment as a transcription activator. Apparently RNase A displays some
  properties of homologous angiogenin, which was shown to stimulate ribosomal RNA
  transcription and protein synthesis  and thus can possibly act as a transcriptional
  activator in tumour cells. B. The primary tumour site is a source of extracellular
  nucleoprotein complexes, in particular miRNA/Ago2 complexes , . Recent studies have
  shown a large number of small (∼20–30 nt) RNAs, originated from tRNAs, rRNA, snoRNAs
  and snRNAs, that are able to associate with Ago2 and perform the regulatory role
  by RNAi pathway . In the bloodstream RNase A, whose concentration in the bloodstream
  is maintained by daily intramuscular injections, may generate short fragments of
  extracellular RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs), that may competitively displace
  miRNAs from nucleoprotein complexes, resulting in the degradation of released miRNAs
  by RNase A.
