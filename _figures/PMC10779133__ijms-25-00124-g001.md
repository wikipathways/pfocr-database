caption: Ketogenic and ketolytic pathways in the liver and brain cells. Ketogenesis
  primarily occurs in the mitochondria of hepatocytes with acetyl-CoA produced by
  β-oxidation of fatty acyl-CoA. This process proceeds through stepwise reactions
  catalyzed by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase 1 (ACAT1), 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase
  2 (HMGCS2), 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL), and β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase
  1 (BDH1). The resulting ketone bodies (KBs), acetoacetate (AcAc) and β-hydroxybutyrate
  (BHB), are released into circulating blood via monocarboxylic acid transporters
  (MCTs). After uptake into the brain via MCT1, ketolysis occurs in the mitochondria
  of brain neurons, where BHB oxidation to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by BDH1, succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA
  transferase (SCOT), and ACAT1. After conversion of acetyl-CoA to citrate by citrate
  synthase (CS), ATP is generated through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the
  electron transport chain (ETC). KBs are also produced in the mitochondria of brain
  astrocytes, as described in the hepatic ketogenic pathway, and are provided to neurons
  as an energy source
