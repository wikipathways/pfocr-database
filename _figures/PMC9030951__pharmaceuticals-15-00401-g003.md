caption: 'Potential mechanisms that modulate UPR in diabetic nephropathy (DN): post-translational
  modifications such as phosphorylation (p38MAPK), SUMOylation, ubiquitination, and
  acetylation regulate stability, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activation
  of sXBP1. In DN, loss of insulin or aPC dependent adaptive UPR mediated by sXBP1
  or ER-associated degradation (ERAD) deficiency leads to sustained activation of
  maladaptive ATF6/CHOP signaling. In addition to the activation of proapoptotic CHOP
  and DR5, ATF6 can potentially induce XBP1 expression, and the binding of unspliced
  XBP1 (uXBP1) to spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) mediates proteasomal degradation of the transcriptionally
  active sXBP1. However, a role for the ATF6-uXBP1 pathway in regulation of proteasomal
  degradation of sXBP1 in DN remains to be investigated. In addition to hemostatic
  UPR regulators insulin and aPC, the nephroprotective pharmacological compounds including
  TUDCA, 4-PBA, DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i), GLP1R agonists (GLP1Ra), and SGLT2 inhibitors
  (SGLT2i) may modulate adaptive UPR. Small molecule compounds STF-083010, 4µ8C, MKC3946
  are IRE1α-RNase inhibitors, whereas IXA4 and IXA6 selectively activate IRE1α-dependent
  sXBP1 activation. Ceapins selectively inhibit ATF6α activation, whereas compounds
  AA147 and AA263 target protein disulphide isomerases (PDIs) to selectively induce
  ATF6α activation.'
