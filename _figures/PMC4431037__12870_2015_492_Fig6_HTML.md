caption: Expression features of plant hormone signal transduction pathway genes. Red
  boxes represent tomato genes that were identified as differentially expressed in
  SI compared with pollinated and unpollinated styles. Light green boxes represent
  genes that have been previously identified in tomatoes. White boxes represent genes
  that belong to the KEGG pathway, but have not been identified in tomatoes until
  now.

  profiling in self-compatible (Solanum pimpinellifolium) and self-incompatible (Solanum
  chilense) tomato species.
