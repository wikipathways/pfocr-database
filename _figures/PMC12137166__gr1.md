caption: 'CA PD-OTC of CZ019 displays enhanced glycolysis and noncanonical Krebs cycle
  metabolism. Cryopreserved CA and NC OTC of CZ019 patient (n = 2 biological replicates)
  were cultured in D7-glucose + 13C5,15N2-Gln-containing BCOM for 2 days before harvest
  for SIRM analysis by IC-UHR-FTMS (in μmole/g residue and fraction) except for the
  analysis of medium lactate (in μmole/g residue; panel Ac) by 1H NMR. The schemes
  in A and B tracks D, 13C (,,,), 15N (), 12C (), and 14N () atoms in glycolysis,
  the Krebs cycle, glutaminolysis, and glutathione (GSH) synthesis. , ,  in (B) denote
