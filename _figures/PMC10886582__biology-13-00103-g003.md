caption: Pathways related to activation of pyroptosis. In the canonical signaling
  pathway, intracellular sensors Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing
  1 (NLRP1), 3 (NLRP3), 4 (NLRC4), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and other inflammasome
  sensors are responsible for detecting microbial signals. Upon detection, they initiate
  a response by recruiting the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like
  protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain), which subsequently
  recruits pro-caspase-1. Once activated, caspase-1 cleaves Gasdermin D (GSDMD), generating
  GSDMD-NT fragments. These GSDMD-NT fragments create pores in the plasma membrane
  that are associated with phosphoinositides. Simultaneously, caspase-1 itself undergoes
  cleavage, giving rise to caspase-1 P10/P20 and P33/P10 tetramers. These tetramers
  play a crucial role in the maturation of pro-interleukin-18 (IL-18) and pro-interleukin-1β
  (IL-1β) into their active forms, IL-18 and IL-1β. These mature cytokines are subsequently
  released into the extracellular matrix, leading to the initiation of inflammatory
  responses. In the noncanonical pathway, the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
  from Gram-negative bacteria triggers the activation of caspase-4 and caspase-5 (in
  humans) or caspase-11 (in mice). These caspases, in turn, cleave GSDMD, forming
  pores in the plasma membrane. These GSDMD pores permit the release of potassium
  ions, which further activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and contribute to the maturation
  of IL-1β and IL-18. Additionally, GSDMD pores release mature cytokines, ultimately
  leading to pyroptosis. [Image was created using Biorender.com (accessed on 13 December
