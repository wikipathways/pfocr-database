caption: Pathway for fatty acid synthesis, elongation, and export. Information adapted
  from Li-Beisson et al. []. Partial intermediate products are not shown. Dotted blue
  line represents the division of different subcellular components. The symbols ●,
  ●, ▲ and ▼ indicate upregulated proteins, downregulated proteins, upregulated transcripts,
  and down regulated transcripts, respectively, by salt stress, reported in the publications
  listed in . De novo fatty acid synthesis begins from an acetyl-coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA)
  generated from a pyruvate catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyllysine-residue
  acetyltransferase (DHLAT), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (LPD). Biotin carboxylase
  catalyzes acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. Fatty acids are elongated by sequential
  condensation of two-carbon units by enzymes of the fatty acid synthase complex.
  To generate a C16 fatty acid, the cycle needs to be repeated seven times and several
  enzymes are involved, including ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) I, II, and III, ketoacyl-ACP
  reductase (KAR), hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase (HAD), and enoyl-ACP reductase (ENR);
  acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a cofactor in all reactions. Fatty acyl thioesterase
  (FAT), stearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD), and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (LACS)
  are required for fatty acid elongation and transport to other organelles.
