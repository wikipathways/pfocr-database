caption: 'The main peripheral and neural centers involved in autonomic cardiovascular
  regulation. (A) Sympathetic baroreflex arm: sensory neurons in the periphery transmit
  baroreceptor information via a glutamatergic synapse to the nucleus tractus solitaries
  (NTS) in the medulla. NTS neurons project to and excite neurons in the caudal ventrolateral
  medulla (CVLM). CVLM neurons in turn project and inhibit (via a GABAergic synapse)
  presympathetic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). Spinally projecting
  presympathetic RVLM neurons make direct connections with sympathetic preganglionic
  neurons in the intermediolateral (IML) spinal column, which projects sympathetic
  outflow to effector organs. (B) Parasympathetic control of heart rate: NTS neurons
  receive baroreceptor and chemoreceptor information and relay via a glutamatergic
  pathway to the nucleus ambiguous (NA). Cardioinhibitory neurons in NA then project
  to the heart via the vagus nerve, which mediates its effect via muscarinic receptors
  in the heart. Adapted from Pilowsky and Goodchild (). GABA, gamma-Aminobutyric acid;
  SA, sinoatrial; AV, atrioventricular.'
