caption: The pathway starts with hydroxylation of tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase
  type 1 or 2 (TPH1 or TPH2) to form 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-TPH; TrpOH). TrpOH can
  also be produced by non-enzymatic action of UVA and H2O2. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine,
  5-HT) derives from 5-TPH by action of L-amino acid decarboxylase - AAD. Serotonin
  can be acetylated by aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) or N-acetyltransferase
  (NAT) to produce N-acetylserotonin (NAS) with further methylation by hydroxy-indole-O-methyl
  transferase (HIOMT) to melatonin. Deactivation of serotonin is catalyzed mainly
  by MAO with formation of 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-HIAD) which is followed
  by action of alcohol (AD) or aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADD) with formation of 5-hydroxytryptophanol
  (5-HTOL) or 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), respectively. Alternatively,
  HIOMT activity may also lead to production of methylated derivatives of serotonin.
  First step catalyzed by HIOMT leads to formation of 5-methoxytryptamine 5-MT and
  subsequent action of MAO results in 5-metoxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-MIAD). Finally,
  AD or ADD facilitates synthesis of 5-methoxytryptophol (5-MTOL) or 5-methoxyindole-3-acetic
  acid (5-MIAA), respectively. HIOMT was found also to catalyze conversion of 5-HIAA
  to 5-MIAA. Melatonin by action of MAO can be metabolized to 5-methoxytryptamine
  (5-MT), thus entering the pathway leading to 5-MTOL or 5-MIAA formation.
