caption: Ubiquitinomic profiling reveals the pathogenic signaling pathways activated
  by SARS-CoV-2. The Figures were generated from online tools BioRender. a Proteins
  with altered ubiquitination after SARS-CoV-2 infection were enriched in RIG-I-MAVS
  and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Sites marked in red were reported, and the corresponding
  E3 ligases were also marked nearby. b The ubiquitination sites on the proteins in
  TLR and TNF signaling pathway were identified by MS during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  The five sites on RIPK1 marked in red have also been identified by mass spectrometry
  in other study. c The diagram shows the ubiquitination sites on multiple ISGs during
  SARS-CoV-2 infection. d The ubiquitination sites on the proteins in tight junctions
  signaling pathway were identified by MS during SARS-CoV-2 infection
