caption: Primary pathways for homology-dependent double-strand break (DSB) repair.
  Recombinational repair of a DSB is initiated by 5′ to 3′ resection of the DNA end(s).
  The resulting 3′ single-stranded end(s) invade an intact homologous duplex (in red)
  to prime DNA synthesis. For DSBs that are repaired by the classical double-strand
  break repair (DSBR) model, the displaced strand from the donor duplex pairs with
  the 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tail at the other side of the break, which primes
  a second round of DNA synthesis. After ligation of the newly synthesized DNA to
  the resected 5′ strands, a double-Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediate is generated.
  The dHJ can be either dissolved by branch migration (indicated by arrows) into a
  hemicatenane (HC) leading to noncrossover (NCO) products or resolved by endonucleolytic
  cleavage (indicated by triangles) to produce NCO (positions 1, 2, 3, and 4) or CO
  (positions 1, 2, 5, and 6) products. Alternatively to the double-strand break repair
  (DSBR) pathway, the invading strand is often displaced after limited synthesis and
  the nascent complementary strand anneals with the 3′ single-stranded tail of the
  other end of the DSB. After fill-in synthesis and ligation, this pathway generates
  NCO products and is referred to as synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA).
