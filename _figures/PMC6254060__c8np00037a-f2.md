caption: '. Schematic representation of dhurrin biosynthesis (left) derived from the
  aromatic amino acid tyrosine and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis derived from the aromatic
  amino acid phenylalanine. The core phenylpropanoid pathway branches out into a metabolic
  grid of downstream pathways leading to the production of e.g. flavonoids and stilbenes
  and monomeric units as building blocks for plant polymers. Selected phenylpropanoid
  branches discussed in the main text are presented. P450 enzymes are colored in orange
  and other enzymes are colored in green. Abbreviations: C3′H, p-coumaroylshikimate
  3′-hydroxylase (CYP98A); C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (CYP73A); CHI, chalcone isomerase;
  CHR, chalcone reductase; CHS, chalcone synthase, 4CL, 4-coumaric acid CoA ligase;
  F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′ hydroxylase (CYP75B); FNSII, flavone
  synthase II (CYP93B); HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; IFS, isoflavone synthase;
  PAL, phenylalanine lyase; VAN, vanillin synthase. Broken arrows indicate multistep
  enzymatic reactions. Box around vanillin glucoside indicates compartmentalization.'
