caption: The molecular mechanism of the BMP signaling pathway. The BMP ligand outside
  cells can combine with the receptor complex formed by the type I and type II receptors.
  The complex activates either the typical pathway or the atypical pathway. In the
  typical pathway, the signal transduction complex phosphorylates the SMAD1/5/8. Being
  phosphorylated, the SMAD1/5/8 can bind to SMAD4 to form a complex, and then go through
  the nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore to regulate the expression of target
  genes. Moreover, the combination of BMP and its receptor can regulate other signal
  cascades to adjust the target gene expression (atypical pathway). (A color version
  of this figure is available in the online journal.)
