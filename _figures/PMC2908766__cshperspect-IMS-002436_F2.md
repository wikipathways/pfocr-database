caption: PI3K dependent signal pathway. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the YMNM motif
  via Src family kinases initiates the binding of the p85 subunit of PI3K. PI3K activity
  leads to the production of D-3 lipids, which recruit proteins via their pleckstrin
  homology domain (PH), including PDK1 and PKB/Akt. Once PKB is phosphorylated by
  PDK1, PKB phosphorylates its downstream targets including mTOR, IκB, GSK3β and Bad.
  Active mTOR and IκB result in increased NF-κB transcriptional activity whereas the
  phosphorylation of Bad and GSK3β results in increased survival and NFAT transcriptional
  regulation, respectively. The activation of NF-κB and NFAT (indicated by the dotted
  lines) induces the transcription of both Bcl-XL, a prosurvival factor, and IL-2,
  an important T-cell cytokine required for proliferation as well as other genes.
