caption: The proposed regulatory pathway of OBA-RT in inhibition of CSC and induction
  of apoptosis. (a) CSCs drive cancer initiation, progression, and therapeutic failure
  due to their abilities to initiate cancer, induce self-renewal and tumorigenicity,
  and augment pluripotent signals. CSCs are known to be highly resistant to chemotherapy
  and cause cancer relapse. Specific treatment to CSCs may induce cancer collapse
  and prevent the relapse of the disease. (b) Akt signaling pathways are critical
  for CSC properties and apoptotic cell death leading to cancer aggressiveness. OBA-RT
  could inhibit Akt function, resulting in the induction of apoptosis and cancer stem
  cell suppression activity in lung cancer cells.
