caption: Overview of the molecular mechanism of butyrate in the prevention and treatment
  of DKD. The pathological process of DKD involves persistent HG-induced oxidative
  stress, immune system disorders, and inflammation (red arrows). Endogenous or exogenous
  butyrate (green arrows) inhibits the activity of HDAC, opens the structure of chromatin,
  and facilitates the expression of the Nrf2 gene, which may enter the nucleus and
  upregulate the downstream targets HO1 and NQO1 and then inhibits oxidative stress
  and inflammation in DKD. Meanwhile, GPR43 and GPR109A are important receptors of
  butyrate for renal protection, and the interaction between β-arrestin-2 and I-κBα
  is induced by butyrate via GPR43, suggesting that butyrate-mediated GPR43-β-arrestin-2
  signaling may be a novel and promising target for DKD (green arrows). Moreover,
  it has been found that butyrate reverses HG-induced the downregulation of miR-7a-5p
  and inhibits the expression of P311, followed by the inhabitation of the kidney
  fibrosis of DKD (green arrows) and activated autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR pathway
  to delay the DKD progression. Notably, butyl-CoA, a metabolite of butyrate, is the
  substrate of histone butyrylation modification, irrespective of whether butyrate
  or sodium butyrate improves DKD renal injury through histone butyrylation pathway
  or the cross-talk of the histone post-translational modifications has not been reported.
