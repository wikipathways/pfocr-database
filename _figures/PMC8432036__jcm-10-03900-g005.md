caption: Canonical TGFβ signaling mediated by TGFβ co-receptor betaglycan and soluble
  betaglycan formed after proteolytic cleavage. TGFβ ligands presentation to the dedicated
  TGFβRs includes the formation of a binary complex between betaglycan and TGFβ dimer,
  which potentiates binding of TGFβRIIs. In turn, once bound, TGFβRIIs lead to recruitment
  of TGFβRIs, with a simultaneous displacement of betaglycan from signaling complex.
  Betaglycan can also modulate TGFβ signaling due to its ectodomain shedding. A soluble
  form of betaglycan effectively sequestrates TGFβ dimers, thus diminishing pathway
  activation.
