caption: 'Altered gene expression in Toll (Tl) signaling pathway during diapause.
  The scheme displays a generalized assembly (regardless tissue specificity) of relevant
  genes in the Toll signal pathway. Transcript levels (logarithmic fold change, LogFC)
  are given in red for upregulated, blue for downregulated and black for no significant
  change (ns; LogFC close to 0). The acronyms are listed in Additional file : Table
  S3 where also references and details of gene/protein functions are given. The Toll
  pathway is activated in diapausing flies as seen from increases of target genes
  such as Drosomycin (Drs), Drosomycin-like 5 (Drsl5), IM1 and IM2. Also several extracellular
  members of the Toll-activating proteolytic cascade were upregulated. The signaling
  scheme is based on []'
