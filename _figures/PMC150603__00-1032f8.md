caption: Genetic Requirements for the R Gene Functions Tested.The font size reflects
  the relative contribution of each locus to the function of each R protein listed
  at top. A larger font implies that the null mutant compromises R function severely,
  and a smaller font implies a moderate effect. A locus placed in the same vertical
  orientation implies a single pathway. Note that the order of action can be inferred
  clearly only in the case of RPM1. Loci side by side imply that no relationship was
  determined, and split arrows represent parallel pathways.
