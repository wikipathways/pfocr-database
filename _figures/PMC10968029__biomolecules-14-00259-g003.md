caption: 'A diagrammatic portrayal of GRB2 splicing variants, particularly GRB3-3,
  in signal transduction. (a) Schematic representation delineating the domain structure
  of GRB2 and GRB3-3; (b) Depiction of the structures of both GRB2 and GRB3-3; (c)
  Proposed model outlining the molecular mechanism governing the regulation of MAPK
  signal pathway activation by GRB3-3, along with proteins capable of interacting
  with GRB3-3. Key abbreviations: GRB3-3, growth factor receptor-bound protein 3;
