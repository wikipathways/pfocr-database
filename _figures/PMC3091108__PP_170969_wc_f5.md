caption: Marker-free plastids by repeat-mediated deletion of the marker gene. In the
  transplastome (T-ptDNA), the aadA marker gene, expressed in the P2/T2 cassette,
  disrupts the hppd herbicide tolerance gene encoding 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase
  (HPPD), an enzyme in the tocopherol biosynthetic pathway. The hppd coding region
  is flanked by the P1/T1 cassette but is not expressed due to disruption by aadA.
  Note the 403-nucleotide duplicated segment (darker color) flanking the aadA. Deletion
  of aadA via the 403-nucleotide repeats (arrowheads) reconstitutes a functional hppd
  gene enabling the expression of herbicide resistance in seedlings (; for review,
  see ).
