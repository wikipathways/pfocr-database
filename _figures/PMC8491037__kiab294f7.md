caption: 'Metabolic pathway for incorporation of HFA into P. fendleri TAG. Solid lines
  indicate glycerol backbone transfer where thicker lines represent larger flux. Dotted
  lines indicate acyl group transfer. A, Hydroxylation of oleic acid (18:1) to ricinoleic
  acid (18:1OH) in PC. B, Acyl editing cycle to transfer 18:1OH to the acyl CoA pool.
  C, Elongation of 18:1OH to lesquorelic acid (20:1OH). D, De novo DAG is predominantly
  utilized for PC synthesis. E, Initial TAG is predominantly produced from PC-derived
  DAG (sn-1/2) not containing an HFA. F, TAG remodeling initially removes non-HFAs
  from TAG generating sn-1/2 or sn-2/3 DAG from 0HFA-TAG, and sn-2/3 DAG from 1HFA-TAG
  remodeling. G, Acyl groups removed by TAG remodeling are reincorporated into the
  acyl-CoA pool and may be further modified on PC and elongated. Enzyme abbreviations:
  DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltansferase; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase;
  LPAT, lyso-phosphatidic acid acyltransferase; PAP, phosphatidic acid phosphatase;
  TAGL1, TAGLipase like-1. Substrate abbreviations: G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; PA,
  phosphatidic acid.'
