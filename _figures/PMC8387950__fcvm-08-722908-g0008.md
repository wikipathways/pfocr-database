caption: Model of the FABP3-mediated PPARα pathway in cardiac metabolic reprogramming
  and progression of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. The schematic demonstrates
  that the FABP3-mediated PPARα pathway regulates cardiac metabolic reprogramming
  by directly interacting with PPARα, thereby stabilizing and inducing its transactivation,
  which triggers downstream Mlycd and Cpt1b gene expression, while suppressing Acaca
  and Gck gene expression. This results in increased FAO levels and mitochondrial
  ATP production, ultimately resulting in adaptive cardiac function. However, in mice
  lacking FABP3, the response of FABP3-mediated PPARα on FAO/Glycolysis balance is
  abolished, and leads to the degradation of PPARα, lower transcriptional activity
  on FAO genes accompanied by increased lipogenesis, and glycolysis gene expression,
  which contributes to the increase in the glycolysis rate, accumulation of toxic
  lipid species, and compromised mitochondrial ATP production, thereby aggravating
  the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.
