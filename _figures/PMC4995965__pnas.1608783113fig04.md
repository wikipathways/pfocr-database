caption: DVL phosphorylation by NEK2 affects Wnt signaling. Proposed mechanism of
  DVL action during centrosome separation. HEK293 cells were transfected as indicated
  and analyzed for Topflash reporter activity. (A) NEK2 overexpression shows no significant
  activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, unlike β-catenin. (B) NEK2 alone is not able
  to potentiate Wnt/β-catenin activation induced by DVL3, but synergy is observed
  in the presence of CK1ε. (C) Knockdown of NEK2 by siRNA decreases Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway activation by recombinant Wnt-3a. (D) Topflash reporter activity after transfection
  of Ser to Ala mutants at the DVL3 sites phosphorylated by NEK2. (E) DVL accumulates
  during cell cycle at the centrosome. In G2/M, when NEK2 activity is peaking, DVL
  is phosphorylated on several residues, which increases its affinity toward linker
  proteins. DVL works as a scaffold that facilitates and is required for NEK2-induced
  release of C-NAP1 and CDK5RAP2 from centrosomes. DVL released from the centrosome
  by the activity of NEK2 is than available for and increases the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  activation. Graphs represent mean ± SEM of at least three independent replicates.
  *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 (ANOVA, Bonferroni's posttest, A–D).
