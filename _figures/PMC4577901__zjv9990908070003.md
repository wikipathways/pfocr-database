caption: Signaling network of genes that are strongly upregulated following MARV challenge
  of NHPs. By using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to map the genes which were found
  to be strongly upregulated following MARV challenge, 34 gene products (nodes with
  official gene symbols) were found to be directly or indirectly connected according
  to Ingenuity's database of published interactions. Edges without arrows indicate
  a direct interaction between two gene products, e.g., a protein-protein interaction.
  Edges with arrows represent a regulation of transcription, directed from the gene
  regulator to a regulated gene. Loops indicate self-regulation.
