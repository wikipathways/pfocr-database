caption: Modification of the Nrf-2 and NF-κB signaling pathways by phytochemicals
  upregulates antioxidant and detoxification enzymes and suppresses inflammation.
  The Nrf2 pathway can be activated by the phytochemical sulforaphane in at least
  two ways, one involving interaction of sulforaphane with the SHs between Keap1 and
  Nrf2, and the other involving phosphorylation of Nrf2. Once freed from Keap1, Nrf2
  translocates into the nucleus, where it induces the expression of genes encoding
  proteins involved in glutathione synthesis, antioxidant enzymes, phase 2 detoxification
  enzymes, and proteins involved in NADPH synthesis. Oxidative stress and ligands
  for TNFRs and TLRs activate upstream IKKs, resulting in phosphorylation of IκB that
  is normally bound to the inactive NF-κB dimer (p50 and p65) in the cytoplasm. IκB
  is then targeted for proteasomal degradation and NF-κB then moves into the nucleus,
  where it induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines as well as genes encoding
  proteins such as SOD2 and Bcl2 involved in adaptive stress responses. Curcumin can
  inhibit NF-κB in inflammatory immune cells, whereas other phytochemicals may activate
  NF-κB in some cell types (e.g., neurons) to enhance stress resistance. ARE, antioxidant
  response element; IKK, Iκ-B kinase; Maf, musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene
