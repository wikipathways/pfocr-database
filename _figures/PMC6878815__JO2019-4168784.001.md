caption: Project design and analysis workflow for integrative analysis combining germline
  with somatic mutation information on indolent and aggressive cancers using gene
  expression data as the intermediate phenotype. RNA-seq read count data and somatic
  information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Germline mutation
  information was manually curated from GWAS and supplemented with information from
  the GWAS catalogue. The LIMMA (R) package was used for the discovery of differentially
  expressed (DE) mutated and nonmutated genes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was
  used for the discovery of molecular networks and signaling pathways enriched with
  germline and somatic mutations.
