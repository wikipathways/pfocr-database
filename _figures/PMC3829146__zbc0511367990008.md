caption: The metabolic pathway of guanine-containing ribonucleotides leading to the
  synthesis of RNA under normal and oxidative conditions. ADK and NDK, adenylate kinase
  and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, respectively. O• indicates reactive oxygen species,
  and oG-containing nucleotides represent those whose guanine bases were oxidized
  to form 8-oxo-Gua. The insets show the structures of RNA polymerase and guanylate
  kinase, which were drawn using the PyMOL software program () based on the data for
  Protein Data Bank entries 3LU0 () and 2AN9 (), respectively. The subunit structures
  of RNA polymerase and the GDP binding site of guanylate kinase are also shown.
