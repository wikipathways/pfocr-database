caption: A Possible Signaling Pathway that Mediates FSH-Induced Meiotic Resumption
  of Mouse OocytesAfter binding with its membrane-integrated receptor in cumulus cells,
  FSH uses PKAII as a downstream mediator after a transient increase of cAMP. PKAII
  leads to AR and CYP51 expression with the mediation of CREB. CYP51 probably participates
  in the regulation of MAPK activation by mediating downstream steroidogenesis during
  oocyte maturation. In addition, CYP51 activity may be involved in EGF-induced MAPK
  phosphorylation and oocyte meiotic resumption. cat, Catalytic unit; CBP, CREB-binding
  protein; FSHR, FSH receptor.
