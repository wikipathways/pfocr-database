caption: Regulation of induction and vesicle nucleation. The regulation of autophagy
  has been characterized in studies of yeast and mammalian cells. (A) In yeast, a
  class III PI 3-K is required for autophagic activity and may function at the pre-autophagosomal
  membrane. A putative complex consisting of Atg1 kinase and several other proteins
  characterized as being required primarily for autophagy (in purple) or the Cvt pathway
  (in green) may be a downstream effector of Tor kinase to regulate the type of pathway
  that operates, depending on the nutritional conditions or other signals. Autophagy
  in yeast is primarily a starvation response; Tor, along with other regulatory components
  not shown (including PKA), responds to nutrient levels. In nutrient-rich conditions,
  Atg1 and Atg13 are more highly phosphorylated and have a lower affinity for each
  other; during starvation the two proteins are partially dephosphorylated. The PI
  3-K complex I, consisting of Vps15, Vps34, Atg6/Vps30 and Atg14, is required for
  both the Cvt pathway and autophagy. (B) In mammalian cells, a class I PI 3-K is
  stimulated in response to the binding of a ligand to a receptor such as the insulin
  receptor (InR). PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 generated at the plasma membrane
  allow the binding and activation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase
  1 (PDK1) and Akt/PKB, whereas PTEN antagonizes this pathway through its 3′-phosphoinositide
  phosphatase activity. Akt inhibits the GTPase-activating protein complex TSC1-TSC2,
  resulting in the stabilization of RhebGTP, which activates Tor, resulting in the
  inhibition of autophagy. Both Tor and PDK1 stimulate p70S6 kinase (p70S6k). The
  downregulation of p70S6k activity in starvation conditions (when Tor is inhibited)
  might prevent excessive autophagy (). It is also possible that p70S6k indirectly
  inhibits Tor by interfering with activation of the class I PI 3-K, as suggested
  by studies in mammalian cells (). In nutrient-rich conditions, activation of p70S6k
  should inhibit PI 3-K, allowing a low level of autophagy for homeostatic purposes,
  whereas in starvation conditions the eventual inactivation of p70S6k should allow
  activation of PI 3-K to prevent excessive autophagy. The class III PI 3-K serves
  a stimulatory role possibly similar to that of the yeast enzyme complex.
