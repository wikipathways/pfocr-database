caption: Pathway summary of a host defense mechanism response to bacterial meningitis
  caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Resting microglia are activated by S. pneumoniae.
  Rb1‐treated microglia express high levels of surface ER‐β to bind estrogen, which
  induces BDNF generation via Nurr1 as a pro‐survival signal for neurons. Microglial
  survival is increased through JAK2/STAT5 phosphorylation, and surviving microglia
  produce anti‐inflammatory mediators and facilitate bacterial clearance. In the absence
  of these survival signals, microglia promote neuronal death by creating harmful
  inflammation in the meninges

  protection via ginsenosides in mice brain.
