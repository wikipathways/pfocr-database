caption: 'Top: PDI exposure at the vessel injury site contributes to enable the initial
  step of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, conversion of TF from the functionally
  inactive to the active form. After vessel injury, PDI can be secreted by activated
  platelets (P) adhering at the injury site and released from cells of the damaged
  vessel wall. The exposed PDI might interact with TF expressed by vessel wall cells
  and TF carrying blood components such as microparticles rapidly recruited to the
  vessel lesion. In parallel, the exposed PDI can directly contribute to amplify platelet
  activation. Bottom: Hypothetical molecular mechanism of TF activation by PDI. TF-dependent
  fibrin formation is low when the Cys186/Cys209 pair of TF is glutathionylated and/or
  in the free thiol form. Mixed disulfides with glutathione (and other types of linkages)
  at Cys209 are a constitutive redox form of the protein. PDI can cleave the mixed
  disulfides of TF when its redox-active cysteines are in the reduced form. This could
  potentially result in the formation of an unstable PDI-TF intermediate. Through
  nucleophilic attack by the vicinal free thiol, the intermediate might be disintegrated
  and be converted into a stable disulfide. The isomerization reaction proposed is
  thus in principle similar to the PDI-catalyzed isomerization suggested to mediate
  the correct positioning of protein disulfides in the ER (). After completing the
  redox exchange, the same PDI molecule can potentially stimulate additional TF molecules,
  which would amplify TF activation.'
