caption: 'Metabostemness: a metabolo-epitranscriptional switcher. A highly active
  crosstalk between metabolism and epigenetics allows the causal integration of metabolism
  and metabolites with genetic programs to coordinately regulate CSC function and
  fate. Nutrient levels and cell metabolism will significantly affect levels of the
  metabolites, which are required substrates of chromatin-modifying enzymes that use
  them to modify both histones and DNA (). A minor portion of the lucose that enters
  the glycolytic pathway is branched to hexosamine biosynthetic pathway to produce
  GlcNAc, a substrate for histone GlcNAcylation by the OGT enzyme. It is well known
  that the flux through glycolysis determines the NAD+/NADH ratio, a crucial metabolic
  parameter for the activities of sirtuin histone deacetylases. Citrate and α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG) are intermediates of the TCA cycle that can be exported out of mitochondria;
  cytosolic citrate is converted to acetyl-CoA that is employed as a donor for HAT-mediated
  histone acetylation. JHDM and TET use α-KG as cofactor for histone and DNA demethylation
  reactions, respectively. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is synthesized from essential
  amino acid methionine, is a donor for DNA methylation via HMT and DNMT. A low ATP/AMP
  ratio indicative of metabolic stress can activate AMPK, which can translocate to
  chromatin and phosphorylate histones. In this scenario, we propose that certain
  metabotypes might operate as pivotal molecular events rendering a non-CSC cell susceptible
  to epigenetic and transcriptional rewiring required for the acquisition of aberrant
  stemness and, concurrently, of refractoriness not only to apoptosis but also to
  differentiation. Only certain cell metabotypes would be compatible with the operational
  properties exclusively owned by CSC cellular states; conversely, certain metabotypes
  would impose cellular modes protected against CSC reprograming. In other words,
  the molecular logic behind the conversion of non-CSC into CSC can be better understood
  in terms of cellular metabotypes that operate as pathways (“permissive”) or roadblocks
  (“protected”) by facilitating or impeding, respectively, the transcriptional events
  and signal transduction pathways that lastly coordinate the intrinsic and microenvironmental
  paths to CSC cellular states.'
