caption: Exemplary Ca2+ signaling microdomains. Cartoon illustration of various microdomains
  featured in different types of cells, all being artificially integrated in a hypothetical
  single cell. (1) Cardiac dyad. Single LTCC openings generate Ca2+ sparklets to activate
  a RYR2 Ca2+ nanospark in the cleft and a Ca2+ spark of 2 μm diameter in the surrounding
  space, as well as a Ca2+ blink in the connected ER/SR cistern. (2) Skeletal muscle
  triad (half structure illustrated). Arrayed RYR1 is mechanically gated by DHPR acting
  as the voltage sensor to initiate SR Ca2+ release, which, in turn, may activate
  nearby RYR3/β array via the CICR mechanism. (3) Subsurface cistern, to support subsurface
  sparks seen in smooth muscle cells and DRG neurons. (4) Clustered Orai1 and STIM1
  forming an elemental unit for SOCE. Its digital operation gives rise to Ca2+ glows
  which morphology and kinetics are shaped by membranous structures like invadopodia.
  (5) Multimodal Ca2+ signaling microdomain. In human lung fibroblasts, Ca2+ flickers
  arise from both TRPM7 Ca2+ influx, sensing mechanical signals, and IP3R Ca2+ release,
  sensing chemotactic signal mediated by platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)
  signaling pathway, and dynamically regulate the assembly and disassembly of cytoskeletal
  filaments, and thereby steer the direction of cell migration. (6) Mitochondria-associated
  membranes (MAMs), the contact sites between mitochondria and ER, are a central hub
  for Ca2+ signaling, apoptosis, autophagy and lipid biosynthesis. (7) ER surface
  Ca2+ microdomains, sites of phase separation of protein complex for specification
  of autophagosome initiation. (8) Perinuclear Ca2+ waves from the ER in the nuclear
  envelope, with high Ca2+ passing through the nuclear pores. (9) Golgi Ca2+ microdomain
