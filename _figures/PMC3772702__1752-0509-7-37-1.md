caption: A signaling pathway that controls yeast meiotic initiation. Proteins enclosed
  in an oval are model variables. Phosphorylated proteins are labeled with the letter
  P in a grey circle. Solid lines represent phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, or
  degradation; dashed lines indicate regulatory interactions between proteins. The
  arrow at the end of a dashed line depicts activation; the bar at the end of a dashed
  line shows repression.

  description: A signaling pathway that controls yeast meiotic initiation. Proteins
    enclosed in an oval are model variables. Phosphorylated proteins are labeled with
    the letter P in a grey circle. Solid lines represent phosphorylation, dephosphorylation,
    or degradation; dashed lines indicate regulatory interactions between proteins.
    The arrow at the end of a dashed line depicts activation; the bar at the end of
