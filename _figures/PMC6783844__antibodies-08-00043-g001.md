caption: '(a) The illustration of human IgG1 structure with N-glycan attached at Asn297
  site in the CH2 of the Fc region. Light chains (L) are highlighted in green, and
  heavy chains (H) are highlighted in blue. C: constant domain; V: variable domain;
  H: heavy chain; L: light chain; S-S: disulfide bond; Fab: Fragment antigen-binding
  domain; Fc: Fragment crystallizable domain. Fc regions which bind effector molecules
  and cells. (b) The schematic diagram of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
  (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated
  phagocytosis (ADCP) mechanisms in cancer treatment. For ADCC, natural killer (NK)
  cells recognize the Fc region mediated by surface FcγRIIIa receptors, causing apoptosis
  of the antibody-coated tumor cells. Once activated, NK cells release cytotoxic granules
  containing perforin and granzymes to induce apoptosis in targeted cells []. Another
  antibody-induced pathway is the classical pathway in the complement system, often
  called complement-dependent cytotoxicity. CDC is initiated when the C1q complex
  interacts with antibodies bound to the pathogen surface, facilitating the lysis
  of cells by forming the membrane attack complex (MAC) which induces lethal colloid-osmotic
  swelling [,,]. The third major effector mechanism is ADCP. ADCP is a potent mechanism
  by which IgG-opsonized tumor cells activate the FcγRIIa and FcγRI expressed on the
  surface of macrophages to induce phagocytosis, resulting in engulfment and degradation
  of the target cell through acidification of the phagosome and the fusion with lysosomes
  [].'
