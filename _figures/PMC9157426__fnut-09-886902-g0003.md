caption: 'Activation depends on SCFA-associated receptors to maintain intestinal function
  and alleviate metabolic disorders: (1) Extracellular, SCFA-sensing G-protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs) are activated to recruit and bind downstream effector proteins
  (e.g., G proteins, β-arrestin, etc.), which then function in vivo through the cAMP
  signaling pathway, ERK signaling pathway 1/2, and calcium ion signaling pathway.
  (2) The activation of GPR43 and GPR41 receptors on intestinal endocrine cells is
  closely related to the regulation of metabolic disorders. After activation, GLP-1
  can be stimulated, the secretion of PPY maintains glucose homeostasis, and the activation
  of SCFA transporters MCT and SMCT can promote the entry of SCFA into intestinal
  epithelial cells and regulate genes related to fat metabolism. Activation of these
  SCFA-dependent receptors is particularly important for fat storage, oxidation, inflammation,
  and thermogenesis.'
