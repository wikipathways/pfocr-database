caption: Ceramide is the hub of the sphingolipid metabolism and can be synthesized
  by several pathways. Ceramide can be generated by the de novo pathway (green box)
  from the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to generate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine,
  which is then reduced to dihydrosphingosine and further N-acylated to form dihydroceramide
  by (dihydro)ceramide synthases (CerS). Dihydroceramide desaturase (DES) then forms
  ceramide.Ceramide can be hydrolyzed to sphingosine and then re-acylated back to
  ceramide in the salvage/recycling pathway (purple box) or phosphorylated to sphingosine-1-phosphate
  by sphingosine kinase (SK).Ceramide can be also modified to form more complex sphingolipids
  (yellow box) such as ceramide-1-phosphate, sphingomyelin, hexosylceramdies (glucosylceramide
  and galactosylceramide) and O-acylceramides. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT);
  3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (KDHR); ceramidase (CDase); sphingosine kinase
  (SK); sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatases (SPP); ceramide kinase (CERK); ceramide-1-phosphate
  phosphatase (C1PP) sphingomyelinases (SMase); sphingomyelin synthase (SMS); glucosylceramide
  synthase (GCS); glucosylceramidase (GCase); ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT);
