caption: '(A) In normal wild-type skin TNF signalling might be activated by local
  penetration of bacteria into the epidermis. This will induce TNF, presumably by
  keratinocytes themselves or other resident cells such as Langerhans cells, and promotes
  canonical NF-κB signalling, inflammatory cytokine production and expression of prosurvival
  genes. If this response nullifies the threat, TNF signalling is turned off and homeostasis
  of the skin is maintained. (B) In the absence of TRAF2 in keratinocytes, TNF production
  can induce apoptotic cell death. This cell death, possibly because of the release
  of DAMPs, recruits neutrophils and other inflammatory cells to the skin and causes
  epidermal hyperplasia. Loss of TRAF2 also causes constitutive non-canonical NF-κB
  activation in viable keratinocytes, which increases the production and release of
  inflammatory cytokines, including TNF. Thus, TRAF2-deficient keratinocytes do not
  need to be stimulated by bacteria to produce TNF, and TNF-induced death sets up
  a potentially vicious cycle of inflammation. (C) Concomitant deletion of Tnf in
  mice with Traf2-deficient keratinocytes breaks this vicious cycle and prevents apoptosis
  of keratinocytes and early onset of the psoriasis-like phenotype. (D) In the absence
  of TNF, Traf2-deficient keratinocytes still produce inflammatory cytokines via the
  non-canonical NF-κB pathway that ultimately generate the same psoriasis-like phenotype
  in mice but with slower onset. These cytokines recruit inflammatory immune cells
  to the skin, including neutrophils and IFNγ+ T cells.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10592.015'
