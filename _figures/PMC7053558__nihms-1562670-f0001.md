caption: Molecular pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. (a) A single-nucleotide
  polymorphism in the β-globin gene leads to substitution of valine for glutamic acid
  at the sixth position in the β-globin chain. Following deoxygenation, the mutated
  hemoglobin (HbS) molecules polymerize to form bundles. The polymer bundles result
  in erythrocyte sickling (clockwise), which in turn results in (b) impaired rheology
  of the blood and aggregation of sickle erythrocytes with neutrophils, platelets,
  and endothelial cells to promote stasis of blood flow, referred to as vaso-occlusion.
  Vaso-occlusion promotes ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury (clockwise). (a) Hemoglobin
  (Hb) polymer bundles also promote hemolysis or lysis of erythrocytes (counterclockwise),
  which (c) releases cell-free Hb into the blood circulation. Oxygenated Hb (Fe2+)
  promotes endothelial dysfunction by depleting endothelial nitric oxide (NO) reserves
  to form nitrate (NO3−) and methemoglobin (Fe3+). Alternatively, Hb can also react
  with H2O2 through the Fenton reaction to form hydroxyl free radical (OH•) and methemoglobin
  (Fe3+). Also, NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase (XO), and uncoupled endothelial NO
  synthase (eNOS) generate oxygen free radicals to promote endothelial dysfunction.
  Methemoglobin (Fe3+) degrades to release cell-free heme (counterclockwise), which
  is a major erythrocyte damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). (d) Reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) generation, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation, neutrophil
  extracellular trap (NET) generation, release of tissue or cell-derived DAMPs, DNA,
  and other unknown factors (?) triggered by cell-free heme or I-R injury can contribute
  to sterile inflammation by activating the inflammasome pathway in vascular and inflammatory
  cells to release IL-1β. Finally, sterile inflammation further promotes vaso-occlusion
  through a feedback loop by promoting adhesiveness of neutrophils, platelets, and
  endothelial cells.
