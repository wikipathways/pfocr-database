caption: A combination of factors contribute to pancreatitis. The first hit increases
  susceptibility to injury, whereas the second hit affects the immune response (and
  includes leukocytes, such as M2 macrophages) to promote stellate cell-associated
  fibrosis. Alcohol could injure the pancreas via its effects on acinar cells, but
  it is probably more important in the second group, as a modifier of the immune response.
  For example it could promote a Th17-cell response, or act directly on stellate cells
  (dashed lines). Altered trypsin functions in acinar cells or ducts could also initiate
  disease. In either case, similar second hit factors then contribute to development
  of fibrosis (via variants in SPINK1 and/or CTRC). Severe acute pancreatitis involves
  widespread pancreatic necrosis (about 90% of tissue), which leads directly to scaring
  and fibrosis in the recovery phase. Obese patients could have areas of adipose tissue
  that contain local necrosis of acinar tissue, which has been linked to lipotoxicity.
  Progressive fibrosis could occur in patients with RAP. Other pathways include autoimmune
  pancreatitis in which the pathway to fibrosis is less well understood.
