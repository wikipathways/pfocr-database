caption: Dectin-1 Signaling Pathway. (A) Upon beta-glucan binding, dectin-1 recruits
  Syk to the hemi-ITAM followed by the activation of the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex.
  As a result, the NF-kB pathway is activated, and genes coding proinflammatory cytokines
  (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β), are released to promote the maturation of dendritic cells,
  and differentiation of Th1/Th17 cells. ROS production is also induced in a Syk-dependent
  manner, resulting in inflammasome and activation of caspase-1. All these downstream
  events of dectin-1 finally contribute to the eradication of fungi. (B) Raf-1 is
  activated in a Syk-independent manner and induces deactivation of RelB and activation
  of NF-kB pathway. (C) Dectin-1 collaborates with calcium-mediated pathways to activate
  ERK-MAPK, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and induce cytokines including
  TNF-α, and IL-10. (D) Dectin-1 collaborates with tetraspanin-like molecules, binds
  beta-glucan, and transduces signals. (E) CD82 colocalize with dectin-1 during beta-glucan
  binding, and induces inflammatory cytokines and ROS to boost anti-fungal immunity.
  MS4A4A also binds to dectin-1 when dectin-1 binds beta-glucan or glycoprotein on
  cancer cells, and enhances IL-6 cytokine production from macrophages, IFN-γ production,
  and contributes to anti-cancer immunity.
