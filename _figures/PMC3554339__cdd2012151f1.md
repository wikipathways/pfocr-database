caption: 'Actions of Nec-1 and its derivatives in a mouse system. (a) Chemical structures
  of Nec-1 derivatives targeting RIPK1: active compound Nec-1, inactive variant Nec-1i
  and stable variant Nec-1s/7-Cl-O-Nec-1. (b) Effect of Nec-1 derivatives on two pathways
  involving cell death and inflammation. The TNFR1 signaling pathway mediated by RIPK1
  versus the IDO–kynurenine pathway are shown in parallel. TNFR1 signaling can lead
  to cell survival, apoptosis or necroptosis mediated by formation of three distinct
  signaling complexes: the membrane-bound Complex I (CI), the cytosolic Complex II
  or the necrosome, respectively. RIPK1 ubiquitination by cIAPs or LUBAC within the
  CI functions as a platform to initiate activation of NF-kB and MAPK, resulting in
  cell survival and inflammation through gene induction. Deubiquitination of RIPK1
  by CYLD leads to formation of either CIIa or CIIb (the latter in cIAP-depleted conditions,
  also called ripoptosome), both leading to apoptosis mediated by caspase-8. Only
  apoptosis mediated by CIIb is dependent on RIPK1 activity and is thus inhibited
  by Nec-1. RIPK1 and RIPK3 pro-necrotic activity is restrained by caspase-8 activity
  in the pro-apoptotic CIIa and CIIb, but inhibition or loss of caspase-8 results
  in necrosome formation and subsequent necroptosis. This process is dependent on
  RIPK1 kinase activity and is inhibited by Nec-1. Excess apoptosis or necroptosis
  may induce inflammation, though in general apoptosis is anti-inflammatory (represented
  by arrows of different size) through release of specific DAMPs. Thus, all three
  TNF-induced pathways may result in pathologies associated with cell death and inflammation
  (X representing harmful effects). Both Nec-1 and Nec-1i also inhibit IDO. The IDO–kynurenine
  pathway is activated under inflammatory conditions and exerts immunomodulatory functions.
  Consequently, inhibition of this pathway may also result in pathologies associated
  with cell death and inflammation. At higher concentrations both Nec-1 and Nec-1i
  inhibit RIPK1 with equal potency but at low concentration both are toxic (this concentration
  effect is represented by gradient in a triangle and X represents harmful effects).
  Nec-1s, which inhibits RIPK1 and subsequent necroptosis, lacks the IDO inhibitory
  activity and concentration-dependent toxicity in vivo. DAMPs, damage-associated
  molecular patterns, a, apoptotic, n, necrotic'
