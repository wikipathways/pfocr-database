caption: Regulation of rat GSTA2 and NQO1 gene expression.  Induction of these two
  detoxication enzymes is regulated at the  transcriptional level mediated by two
  distinct enhancers, XRE and ARE,  controlled by the AhR and Nrf2, respectively.
  β-Naphthoflavone  (β-NF), 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC), and  benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P)
  induce expression of these genes  through two different pathways, directly by activating
  the AhR, which,  following dimerizing with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear
  translocator  (ARNT), binds to the XRE to activate transcription, and indirectly  via
  the Nrf2-ARE pathway following their biotransformation to a reactive  intermediate.
  Nrf2 dimerizes with a basic region-leucine zipper  (bZIP) protein and binds to the
  ARE to activate gene transcription.  Induction via the AhR-XRE pathway appears to
  represent an early mechanism of  defense against the eventual metabolic transformation
  of the xenobiotics to  their reactive forms. TCDD,  2,3,7,8-tetraclorodibenzo-p-dioxin.
