caption: Overview of PI3K/Akt activation and signalling. The PI3K/Akt cascade begins
  with extracellular mitogenic cues that stimulate various receptors, such as receptor
  tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors, B cell and T cell receptors, integrins, and
  G‐protein‐coupled receptors. PI3K then binds to the receptor directly, or indirectly
  via adapter molecules (such as the insulin receptor substrate proteins), thus activating
  PI3K. Membrane‐bound Ras can also activate PI3K. Subsequently, activated PI3K converts
  phosphatidylinositol (3,4)‐bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)‐trisphosphate
  (PIP3). Akt then binds to PIP3 at the plasma membrane, which allows phosphoinositide‐dependent
  protein kinase 1 (PDK1) to phosphorylate Akt at the Thr308 site, thus causing partial
  Akt activation. This is sufficient to activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
  complex 1 (mTORC1) becomes activated. The mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) or DNA‐dependent
  protein kinase (DNA‐PK) must phosphorylate Akt at the Ser473 site for full activation.
  Activated Akt mediates the inhibitory or stimulatory phosphorylation of its various
  downstream targets, such as forkhead box protein O (FOXO), glycogen synthase kinase
  3 (GSK3β), caspase‐9 and Bcl‐2‐associated death promoter (Bad). Important negative
  regulators control this signalling cascade. Specifically, phosphatase and tensin
  homolog (PTEN), which dephosphorylates PIP3 into PIP2, and PH‐domain leucine‐rich‐repeat‐containing
  protein phosphatases (PHLPP1/2) that dephosphorylates Akt at the Thr308 or Ser473
  sites, respectively. Created with BioRender.com
