caption: CXCR4 membrane interactors and CXCL12-activated signal transduction pathways.
  (A) CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 leads to the activation of G protein-dependent signaling,
  MAPK, PI3K and PLC pathways, resulting in diverse biological outcomes such as calcium
  mobilization, cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and adhesion. CXCR4
  can form a heterodimer with ACKR3 (CXCR7), which contributes to modulate CXCL12/CXCR4
  signaling. ACKR3 impairs CXCR4-mediated G-protein activation and calcium responses.
  (B) In T cells, CXCR4 interacts with CD3/TCR. The activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12
  induces the formation of the immunological synapsis with antigen presenting cells
  (APCs) and the activation of the RAS-ERK pathway. The interaction of the TCR with
  CXCR4 causes the phosphorylation of CXCR4-S339, which leads to PREX-Rac1 activation
  and to cytokine synthesis and secretion. (C) CXCR4 and CD47 are in contact in cancer
  cells; the binding to CXCR4 of CXCL12 or BoxA, a truncated form of HMGB1, promotes
  co-internalization of CXCR4-CD47. Reduction of surface CD47 impairs its recognition
  by SIRPα, allowing tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages.
