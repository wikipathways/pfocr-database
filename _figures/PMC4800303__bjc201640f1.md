caption: Schematic representation of the integrated semimechanistic PK/PD model describing
  (A) vemurafenib-meditated efficacy under non-resistant conditions through inhibition
  of the MAPK pathway and the cell cycle, and (B) acquisition of resistance to vemurafenib
  by the upregulation of the MAPK pathway and abemaciclib-mediated efficacy through
  cell cycle arrest and increased dependence on Total Rb for survival. Arrowheads
  denote positive relationships, flatheads denote negative relationships. Red arrows
  indicate route of efficacy; purple arrows indicate elevation of baseline biomarker
  levels as a result of vemurafenib resistance. Shaded boxes denote observed compartments.
  Parameters are defined in the text.
