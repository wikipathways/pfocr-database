caption: Proposed regulatory network from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. The
  proposed mechanistic network with predicted upstream regulator and associated downstream
  effectors and final functions were generated based on assessing the match of observed
  and predicted regulatory patterns. The overlay canonical pathway among the mechanistic
  network identified STAT1, IFITM1, ISG15, and MX1 as associated with the Interferon
  (IFN) signaling pathway. Molecules in purple frames, including STAT1, ISG15, and
  MX1 from our dataset, were associated with dermatitis and the inflammatory response.
  Molecules in light green indicated decreased expression, while orange indicated
  predicted activation, and blue indicated predicted inhibition.
