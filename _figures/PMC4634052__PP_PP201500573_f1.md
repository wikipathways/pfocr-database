caption: 'Outline and compartmentation of isoprenoid biosynthesis in plants. The enzymes
  involved in the  and  pathways are numbered as follows: 1, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase
  (AACT); 2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS); 3, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A reductase (HMGR); 4, mevalonate kinase (MK); 5, phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK);
  6, mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase (MPDC); 7, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate
  synthase (DXS); 8, 1-deoxy-dxylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR); 9, 2C-methyl-d-erythritol
  4-phosphate cytidyltransferase (MCT); 10, 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2C-methyl-d-erythritol
  kinase (CMK); 11, 2C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MDS); 12,
  1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-phosphate synthase (HDS); and 13, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl
  diphosphate reductase (HDR). Multistep reactions are depicted with hollow arrows.
  The potential exchange of isoprenoid intermediates across the plastidial envelope
  membrane (metabolic cross talk) is indicated with a gray circle. Evidence for the
  existence of an alternative pathway involving isopentenyl monophosphate (IP) has
  been presented, but its role in plants is currently unknown (depicted with broken
  arrows). ER, Endoplasmic reticulum.'
