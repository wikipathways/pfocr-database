caption: Central role of AR signaling in prostate cancer and targets in CRPC. Activation
  of the AR signaling pathway begins in CRPC with intratumoral testosterone (T) and
  dihydrotestosterone (DHT) synthesis catalyzed by AKR1C3. DHT then binds to AR sequestered
  by Hsp90 in the cytosol leading to translocation of the dimerized AR to the nucleus
  and its binding to androgen response elements (AREs) in the promoters of responsive
  genes. The sites of action of two ARSI therapies, abiraterone and enzalutamide,
  are shown. Alternative forms of the AR that are transcriptionally active in the
  absence of ligand are shown (AR-SV) and phosphorylated forms of AR. The recruitment
  of coregulators to the transcriptional complex is shown. Proteins in red boxes identify
  targets for the eradication of AR signaling. 4-AD, 4-androstene-3,17-dione; 5α-AD,

  description: Central role of AR signaling in prostate cancer and targets in CRPC.
    Activation of the AR signaling pathway begins in CRPC with intratumoral testosterone

    AR. The recruitment of coregulators to the transcriptional complex is shown. Proteins
