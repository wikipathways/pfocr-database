caption: The IRE1-XBP1-related UPRs pathways played pathological and therapeutic roles
  in kidney disease. (a) Unfolded proteins bind to BiP and allow the activation of
  IRE1 to occur through its dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation. IRE1 phosphorylation
  as indicated p in the yellow cycle. Activated IRE1 splices the mRNA of XBP1u to
  form spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) mRNA, which encodes XBP1s protein then translocates to
  the nucleus, inducing genes that are thought to be generally cytoprotective, such
  as chaperones, trafficking associators, ERAD-related proteins. (b) Evidence shows
  that XBP1 knockout makes cells sensitive to oxidative stress, an important insult
  to kidney injury. Combining the XBP1 knockout model with genetically induced ER
  stress in the kidney leads to severe albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, and renal
  failure. (c) XBP1s could directly induce angiogenin (ANG) expression in renal epithelial
  cells, which has been proven to protect cells and attenuate adverse effects caused
  by ER stress. (d) Severe ER stress triggers cell death through the IRE1-TRAF2-JNK
  pathway in many kinds of kidney diseases. Quercetin, a natural flavonoid, has been
  demonstrated to inhibit the IRE1-TRAF2-JNK pathway in unilateral ureteral obstruction
  (UUO), diabetic nephropathy, and cadmium-induced kidney injury. It might be a strong
  therapeutic option for the targeting of UPRs.
