caption: Models for the roles of Scribble in organizing molecular interactomes involved
  in synaptogenesis, epithelial polarity, and adhesion, and growth regulation. (A)
  Cell adhesion molecules (Nrx/Nrg and N-Cad/β-Cat) are required for maintaining synaptic
  architecture and regulating neurotransmitter release. Both types of adhesion complexes
  interact with Scribble and β-PIX, facilitating localized Rac activity and F-actin
  polymerization. Polymerization of presynaptic actin is required for synaptic vesicle
  clustering and release from the active zone. Scribble also regulates trafficking
  of the NMDA receptor. (B) In the mature Drosophila ectoderm and imaginal disc epithelia
  Scribble localizes with Dlg and Lgl to the basolateral septate junctions. Scribble
  acts to antagonize aPKC and components of the adherens junction (AJ), excluding
  them from the basolateral domain. In turn, Scribble is antagonized by the apical
  polarity protein Crb. In cultured mammalian epithelial cells, Scribble regulates
  AJ and tight junction (TJ) organization, by stabilizing Ecad at the adherens junction
  via effects on p120 and via myosin stabilization mediated by DLC3. (C) Planar polarity,
  polarity across an epithelial sheet, is required for a number of processes, from
  sensory hair orientation to limb bud elongation. Core PCP proteins are asymmetrically
  localized and are conserved from Drosophila to mammals (vertebrate gene names in
  brackets). Vang and Fz localize to opposing sides of the cell, respectively, and
  form heterodimers between cells (). Scribble can physically interact with Vang as
  well as its vertebrate equivalent. Par3 is suggested to localize Vangl through an
  unknown mechanism. (D) Scribble interacts with several components of the Hippo signaling
  pathway, including the apical scaffold (Fat1) and the core kinase cassette (Mst1/2,
  Lats1/2). As a result, Scribble acts to restrain YAP and TAZ activity, transcriptional
  effectors of the Hippo cascade that control gene expression programs required for
  cell stemness, proliferation, survival, and EMT.
