caption: 'The oxidative and antioxidant programmes of UPR. The antioxidant (green
  lines) and oxidative (red lines) pathways of UPR are depicted on the left or on
  the right, respectively. The PERK and IRE1α/XBP1 pathways promote the maintenance
  of ER proteostasis as follows. (1) There is PERK-mediated activation of the antioxidant
  transcription factor NRF2 and the promotion of GSH synthesis []. (2) There is IRE1α/XBP1-mediated
  induction of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which is important for the
  production of UDP-GlcNAc []. On the right, the ER stress-dependent amplification
  of ROS production (red lines) is depicted. (3) Following ER stress, the increased
  folding activity of ER augments ROS production. (4) The ER stress increases the
  MAM-mediated calcium flux to mitochondria that inhibits ETC and increases mitochondrial
  ROS production; moreover, reduced ATP synthesis from the impaired ETC affects SERCA
  activity and the consequent ER calcium content which in turn boosts up unfolding
  []. (5) CHOP, through the induction of Ero1, potentiates calcium efflux from the
  ER. The higher cytosolic calcium activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase II- (CaMKII-) JNK-NOX-protein kinase R (PKR) pathway, which in turn positively
  feedbacks on CHOP expression [, ]. In addition, Ero1-increased expression potentiates
  the oxidative protein folding and ROS production. (6) Through microRNA inhibition,
  the RIDD activity of IRE1 relieves the expression of TXNIP protein that blocks the
  antioxidant enzyme TRX []. (7) IRE1α activates the tumor necrosis factor α-associated
  receptor 2 (TRAF2)/ASK1/JNK pathway that further upregulates the NOX-dependent ROS
  production [, ]. For detailed discussion and references, see the text. Red: reduced;
  Ox: oxidized; TRX: thioredoxin.'
