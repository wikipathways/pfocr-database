caption: PDGF-loaded PVA based microneedle was fabricated by Teflon mold method. In
  vivo studies showed an enhancement of tendon healing quality through angiogenesis
  in rat achilles tendon injury model. Followed up experiments including high-throughput
  RNA sequence further revealed role of MAPK/p38 pathways in PDGF tendon healing process.
  After combination of PDGF and PDGFR, MAPK/p38 signaling pathway was activated. Phosphorylation
  of p38 was entered into nucleus and combined with transcriptional factors. Two predicted
  promoters of Cyclin D, CREB and AP-1, downstream molecules of p38, were then transactivation
  and the expression of Cyclin D was upregulated. With the upregulation of Cyclin
  D, cell proliferation was enhanced leading to angiogenesis and tendon healing enhancement.
