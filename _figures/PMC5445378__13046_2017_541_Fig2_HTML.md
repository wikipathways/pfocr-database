caption: 'E5 immune evasion mechanisms. E5 induces COX-2 expression through: i) the
  activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) signalling pathway and
  the interaction with the nuclear factor 1 (NF-1), which results in the induction
  of ii) AP-1 and iii) NF-κB transcription, which has the strongest effect on COX-2
  transcription. E5 upregulation of EGF-R expression also leads to an increase of
  the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), through COX-2 []. Following this,
  COX-2 and EP4 stimulate PGE2 signalling pathway through a feedback mechanism involving
  increased levels of cAMP, PKA and CREB (cyclic adenosine monophosphate response
  element binding protein), binding to the EP4 promoter []. This leads to a rise in
  the expression of this receptor [, ], which is associated with breast and colon
  carcinogenesis [, ]. Moreover, E5 impairs MHC I [] and II [] surface cell expression'
