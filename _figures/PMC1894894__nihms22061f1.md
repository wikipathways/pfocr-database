caption: A newly-discovered regulatory system between the endocrine and immune systems.
  Hormone and immune system crosstalk can antagonize the biological functions of hormones
  and cause endocrine resistance, which ultimately affects human health and well-being.
  During health, there is an absence of inflammation and an optimal balance of hormones
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The adrenal steroid glucocorticoid hormones act
  in many peripheral tissues to inhibit synthesis and action of proinflammatory cytokines.
  This balance is disrupted during inflammatory states in both the periphery and the
  brain. One mechanism by which this occurs is at the cellular level, whereby proinflammatory
  cytokines antagonize receptor-signaling pathways in muscle, brain and cancer cells.
  The body often responds by producing more hormones to overcome this cytokine-induced
  endocrine resistance. In this way, the endocrine-immune system communication pathway
  is reciprocal because the rise in concentration of hormones increases the hormone/cytokine
  ratio. This rise in the amount of hormone relative to cytokine partially overcomes
  the suppressive actions of both glucocorticoids and proinflammatory cytokines. This
  scenario even occurs in the brain, as demonstrated by abrogation of TNFα-induced
  sickness behavior following central administration of IGF-I.
