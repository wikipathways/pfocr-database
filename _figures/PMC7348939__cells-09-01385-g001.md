caption: Overview of the fundamental aging mechanisms that contribute to sarcopenia.
  During the aging process, a variety of stressors engage various cellular signaling
  cascades, ultimately facilitating the progression of sarcopenia. Several senescence-inducing
  stimuli cause senescence of satellite cells leading to the loss of capacity to repair
  upon muscle injury. Many of these stimuli cause the upregulation of p53–p21Cip1
  and p16Ink4a pathways, which induce a temporal cell-cycle arrest by inhibiting cyclin-dependent
  kinase (CDK) 2 and CDK4/6, respectively. When cells enter a senescent state, the
  senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is expressed in those cells as
  a paracrine signaling pathway. “Inflammaging” and SASP production in senescent skeletal
  muscle cells converge on activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling,
  which induces upregulation of muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF1). Activation of the aging
  process causes mitochondrial dysfunction by deactivation of the sirtuin 1–peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) axis, which is primarily
  responsible for the maintenance of mitochondrial quality control. The accumulation
  of damaged mitochondrial DNA due to an imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics will
  be eliminated via mitophagy. However, under aging conditions, inefficient mitophagy
  eventually induces apoptosis. Aging interrupts the coordinated balance between protein
  synthesis and degradation, which activates and interconnects with multiple signaling
  pathways. Muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and MuRF1, the major muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin
  ligases, are increased by activation of the transcription factor forkhead box O
  (FoxO) by aging stimuli, while the roles of Akt/mammalian target of the rapamycin
  (mTOR) signaling pathway in sarcopenia are controversial. Several possible mechanisms
  shown here could contribute to sarcopenia and be targets of intervention.
