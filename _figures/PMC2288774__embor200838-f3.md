caption: Effects of different Cos572 mutations on Hedgehog signalling. (A) When the
  Costal2 (Cos2) phosphorylation site Ser 572 is mutated to an alanine (A), which
  is a residue that cannot be phosphorylated, this mutant protein can be found bound
  to Fused (Fu), Smoothened (Smo) and Cubitus interruptus (Ci), but cannot be released
  from this complex in response to Hedgehog (Hh). This restricts the activation of
  Smo, as well as the release and activation of Ci155. (B) When Ser 572 is replaced
  with a phosphomimetic residue, aspartate (D), Cos2 can no longer interact with Smo
  and Ci. This allows Smo to accumulate at the plasma membrane (PM), and Ci to be
  free of Cos2 repression; however, Ci is not processed to its active form.
