caption: Bile acid crosstalk with sulfur amino acid metabolism. Liver is the major
  organ for metabolism of sulfur amino acids (methionine, cysteine, taurine) and expresses
  high levels of sulfur amino acid synthesis and metabolising enzymes. Dietary intake,
  methionine (via transsulfuration pathway) and autophagy-mediated protein breakdown
  are major sources of cellular cysteine. Cysteine is the substrate for synthesis
  of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Cysteine conversion to taurine is a major
  cysteine elimination pathway and this process is catalysed by cysteine dioxygenase
  1 (CDO1) and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD). Taurine is used in hepatocytes
  for bile acid conjugation. Bile acids activate farnesoid X receptor (FXR) to repress
  the expression of CDO1 and CSAD to inhibit taurine synthesis and at the same time
  repress cholesterol 7⍺-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) to inhibit bile acid synthesis. Therefore,
  FXR coordinates the synthesis of taurine with bile acids synthesis. FXR repression
  of cysteine catabolism helps preserve cellular cysteine availability for synthesis
  of GSH, which plays a key role in regulating cellular redox homeostasis and antioxidant
  defence against cellular oxidative stress
