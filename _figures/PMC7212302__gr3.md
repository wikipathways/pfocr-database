caption: miRNA–gene regulatory interaction network involving miRNAs and genes dysregulated
  in DLPFCAssociations with schizophrenia, neuritogenesis, and/or ensheathment of
  axons are indicated. Dysregulated miRNAs (miR***) and genes validated by qPCR are
  highlighted in red label or bold font. Red arrows indicate gene–miRNA interactions
  that have been experimentally observed according to Ingenuity Knowledge Base or
  luciferase reporter gene assays conducted in this study. The image is produced using
  the pathway designer tool in IPA.
