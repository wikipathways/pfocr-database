caption: Integrated metabolome and transcriptome analysis reveals major processes
  that are affected during pathogenesis. The filled boxes represent metabolites identified
  through GC-MS analysis while the filled arrows indicate differentially regulated
  genes. The red and green colors represent upregulation and downregulation respectively.
  The analysis identified increased levels of tyrosine, phenyalanine, dopamine, sinapate
  metabolites and upregulation of genes such as phenyl ammonia lyase, tyrosine decarboxylase,
  4 coumarate CoA ligase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase associated with phenylpropanoid
  pathway. Further induction of pyruvate, 1,4 butanediol, γ-aminobutyrate, succinate
  and malate suggested enhanced respiration as these metabolites are involved in TCA
  cycle. We also found two phytohormones, salicylate and its sugar conjugate dihydroxybenzoic
  acid along with jasmonate precursor α-linolenic acid to be induced in the infected
  sheath. Beside these, some other amino acids such as asparagine, valine, serine
  and isoleucine were upregulated while threonine and aspartic acid were downregulated.
  Notably, sugar alcohol myo-inositol and glucuronic acid involved in oxidative stress
  response and cell wall biosynthesis respectively were found downregulated.
