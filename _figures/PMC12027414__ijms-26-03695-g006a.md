caption: Impact of NPC86 on insulin signaling and inflammatory pathways in adipose
  tissue. (a) KEGG pathway diagrams illustrating changes in the insulin signaling
  pathway in the DIOD (top) and DIOD + NPC86 (500 ng/kg b.w. and 1 μg/kg b.w.; bottom)
  groups. The color gradient represents log2 fold changes in gene expression, with
  red indicating upregulation and green indicating downregulation. (b) Bar plot illustrating
  fold-change values of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in insulin
  signaling (DIOD vs. DIOD + NPC86 (500 ng/kg b.w. and 1 μg/kg b.w.) mice). The x-axis
  represents the log2 fold-change in gene expression between the DIOD and NPC86-treated
  mice. Positive values indicate genes that are upregulated following NPC86 treatment,
  whereas negative values represent genes that are downregulated. (c) KEGG pathway
  analysis of the MAPK signaling pathway in DIOD (left) and NPC86-treated (500 ng/kg
  b.w. and 1 μg/kg b.w.; right) mice. Colored boxes indicate log2 fold-change values,
  with red representing upregulation and green representing downregulation of gene
  expression. (d) Bar plot showing fold-change values of genes involved in the MAPK
  signaling pathway between DIOD and DIOD + NPC86 mice (500 ng/kg b.w. and 1 μg/kg
  b.w.). Positive values indicate upregulation, while negative values indicate downregulation
  following NPC86 treatment, highlighting its regulatory effects on MAPK-related gene
  expression. (e) Bar plot showing the number of upregulated and downregulated genes
  involved in key cellular metabolic pathways in DIOD vs. DIOD + NPC86-treated mice
  (500 ng/kg b.w. and 1 μg/kg b.w.). The x-axis represents the number of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs), while the bars indicate whether genes were upregulated or
  downregulated following NPC86 treatment
