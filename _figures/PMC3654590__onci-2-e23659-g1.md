caption: Figure 1. Uptake, processing and presentation of a GalNAc-glycosylated antigen
  in dendritic cells. Antigen-presenting cells are armed with a variety of receptors
  that bind specific carbohydrates (ligands), including MGL (GalNAc), DC-SIGN (high
  mannose/Lewis structures), dectin 1 (β1–3-glucan), dectin 2 (high mannose), mannose
  receptor (mannose and fucose), Langerin (mannose and fucose) and DEC205 (ligand
  not yet identified with certainty). The addition of GalNAc moieties to a mucin 1
  (MUC1)-targeting vaccine may potentiate dendritic cell (DC) uptake and increase
  MHC class II presentation, most likely through the normal antigen presentation pathway.
  However, it is not clear how GalNAc-modified peptides are cross-presented on MHC
  class I molecules. When processed correctly, small glycan moieties have been shown
  to fit into the MHC class I peptide-binding groove, eliciting an MHC class I-restricted,
  glycopeptide-specific, CD8+ T-cell response. However, the pathways leading from
  the uptake of GalNAc-glycosylated antigens to their proteasomal processing and cross-presentation
  on MHC class I molecules are not well characterized. Antigen processing in the proteasome
  might also be negatively affected by GalNAc glycosylation, depending on the location
  of the GalNAc residues. Conjugation and the choice of a linker region can cause
  steric hindrance, potentially interfering with antigen processing via the MHC class
  I pathway. Indeed, GalNAc-modified antigens appear to preferentially generate CD4+
  T-cell responses, resulting in increased activation of CD4+ T cells at the expenses
  of their CD8+ counterparts.
