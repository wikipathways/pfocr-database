caption: Pathways of apoptosis and autophagy. Members of the tumour necrosis factor
  death receptor family (eg, Fas) bind their cognate ligand. The activated receptor
  recruits specific adapter proteins that activate either upstream “initiator” caspases
  in the apoptotic pathway or autophagy‐specific genes (Atg) such as Beclin 1, and
  BNIP3 via the Janus kinase (JNK) pathway. The activated upstream caspases (8 and
  10) cleave and activate downstream “effector” caspases that digest cell components.
  Caspase 8 also cleaves Bid, and the active truncated protein (tBid) interacts with,
  and inhibits, Bcl‐2, the prototypic member of a family of antiapoptotic proteins
  that inhibit the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria. Cytoplasmic cytochrome
  C stimulates recruitment of the Apaf1 adapter and another upstream caspase (caspase
  9) in the apoptosome complex. Activated caspase 9 can cleave and activate effector
  caspases. Thus, apoptosis in response to death receptor ligation may be amplified
  via the “intrinsic” mitochondrial pathway. Bcl‐2 also inhibits autophagy by binding
  and inhibiting Beclin 1. Survival factors such as insulin‐like growth factor 1 activate
  the phosphoinositol kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and Akt is able to inhibit both autophagy
  (via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a sensor of nutrient status) and
  apoptosis. PDK, phosphoinositide‐dependent kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate;
  PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 6‐triphosphate.
