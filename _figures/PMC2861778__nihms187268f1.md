caption: Simplified scheme of the cAMP pathway and the regulation of renin synthesis
  and release. Activation of a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) by its ligand results
  in a conformational change that is transmitted to a heterotrimeric G protein complex.
  The Gsα subunit, through conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into guanosine
  diphosphate (GDP), is released from the complex and activates the adenylyl cyclase,
  which in turn converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into the second messenger cAMP
  (red dots). cAMP binding to the regulatory subunits (R) of protein kinase A (PKA)
  results in the release of the catalytic subunits (C) that, in the nucleus, phosphorylate
  the cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB). Phosphorylated CREB recruits
  the coactivators CBP and p300. Upon binding to the cAMP-responsive element (CRE)
  in the enhancer region of the renin promoter, this complex switches on the transcription
  of renin mRNA. Posttranscriptional regulation at the 3′ untranslated region (UTR)
  occurs by binding proteins that increase renin mRNA stability, and perhaps by microRNAs
  (miRNA), which repress renin translation and/or degrade renin mRNA. cAMP also stimulates
  renin release (dashed arrow). Degradation of cAMP occurs by the action of a phosphodiesterase
  (PDE) that converts it to AMP. The modulating effects of calcium described in the
  text are omitted for clarity. GJ gap junction, MEJ myoendothelial junction, Pol
