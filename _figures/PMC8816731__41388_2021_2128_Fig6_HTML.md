caption: In SMAD4-competent backgrounds, canonical TGFβ signaling mediated by SMAD4,
  but also various alternative pathways, can trigger EMT by inducing expression of
  EMT-TFs. Following their induction, EMT-TFs execute EMT by regulating EMT-associated
  genes directly, as well as indirectly through changing the activity of other TFs
  (TFs A/B/C). This includes the cooperation of EMT-TFs with SMAD4 to regulate a subset
  of target genes. In SMAD4-mutant systems, despite the defect in the TGFβ pathway,
  EMT-TF expression can still be induced by alternative signaling pathways and direct
  and indirect regulation of EMT-associated genes by EMT-TFs and non-SMAD4 TFs can
  proceed normally. However, the missing contribution of SMAD4 to EMT-associated gene
  regulation has to be compensated for (red arrows). This could occur by non-SMAD4
  TFs that are also employed in SMAD4-competent systems (TFs-A/B/C), or by factors
  whose implication in EMT execution is specific to SMAD4-mutant contexts (TF-D).
  By this, TGFβ-activated SMAD4 can contribute to EMT-TF induction and EMT-associated
  gene regulation in some instances of EMT, but it is not obligatory for EMT to occur.
