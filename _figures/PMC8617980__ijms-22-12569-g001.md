caption: An overview of ADO production, metabolism, transport and signalling. ATP
  is actively transported from cells by the non-lytic mechanisms (connexin and pannexin
  hemichannels and other transporters) or uncontrollably released after stress stimuli.
  Extracellular ATP is hydrolysed by CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases to ADO. ADO could
  be also produced by ENPP and PAP enzymatic activity or alternatively by CD38 from
  NAD+. ADO is further metabolised to INO by ADA, and INO is converted to HXT by PNP.
  ADO is also important for the transmethylation pathway, and its intracellular availability
  is regulated by SAHH, ADK and cN-I. ADO and INO could be transported by ENTs (both
  directions) and CNTs (one-way transport). In the extracellular space, both ADO and
  INO interact with ARs in an autocrine and paracrine manner. ADA, adenosine deaminase;
