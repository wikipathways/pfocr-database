caption: Working model of polyI:C-mediated protection on pancreases from inflammatory
  injuries. PolyI:C triggers the IFN-β production by activating the master transcription
  factor IRF3, and IFN-β inhibits neutrophil infiltration, and thus alleviates the
  AP symptoms such as edema, release of amylase and lipase, production of ROS, expression
  of the inflammatory genes by activating the downstream IFNAR signaling.
