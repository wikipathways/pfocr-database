caption: The pathways described in (I), (II), (III), and (IV) refer to potential routes
  for iron entry into cells. (I) Trophozoites are able to obtain iron from host proteins
  such as holotransferrin (H-Tf), hololactoferrin (H-Lf), ferritin (F), and Hb that
  bind to cell surface proteins. The complexes are internalized in clathrin-coated
  vesicles (for ferritin and holotransferrin) or caveolin-like coated vesicles (for
  hololactoferrin). The ligand-receptor complexes dissociate in the endosomes (early
  endosome; EE and late endosome; LE) and the iron bound to proteins is released in
  the lysosomes. It is not clear whether iron transporter proteins are degraded by
  cysteine proteinases (as has been suggested by López-Soto et al ) or whether these
  transporters and cognate receptors are shuttled to the plasma membrane for reuse.
  (II) E. histolytica also acquires iron from Hb via heme internalization during the
  phagocytosis of human erythrocytes, which are degraded by hemolysin and phospholipases.
  It has been proposed that hemoglobinases and cysteine proteinases degrade Hb . The
  monooxygenase heme oxygenase degrades heme and releases iron; we suggest that a
  monooxygenase (EHI_009840) could be responsible for heme degradation in E. histolytica.
  (III) Heme can also be scavenged by secreted hemophores such as hemoglobin-binding
  proteins 45 and 26 (Ehhmbp 45 and Ehhmbp 26), which are able to bind Hb and heme
  . However, the mechanisms of hemophore export and heme-hemophore complex uptake
  are unknown (blue dashed arrows). An MFT (EHI_173950) and an ABC transporter (EHI_178050)
  may be involved in heme-hemophore uptake in E. histolytica. Once heme has entered
  the cell, it can be degraded by monooxygenase. (IV) Iron may be taken up by siderophores,
  since the ABC transporters, P-glycoprotein 5 transporters and the MFT family share
  homology with bacteria siderophore export systems. Lastly, a trans-plasma membrane
  electron transport (trans-PMET) system capable of transferring electrons from cytosolic
  electron donors to non-permeable electron acceptors may have an important role in
  iron reduction and acquisition (gray dashed arrow) . The above-listed mechanisms
  deliver iron to cells. The iron could then be used (for example) in iron-sulfur
  cluster (ISC) biosynthesis in the mitosomes . Heme synthesis has not been described
  in E. histolytica. Both GluRS and SAMS may be key sensors of iron status in this
  pathway. Ferroportin has not yet been identified in E. histolytica.
