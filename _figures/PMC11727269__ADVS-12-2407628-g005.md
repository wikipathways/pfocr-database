caption: 'The workflow for SCZ DREGs identification, analysis, and characterization.
  (SCZ DREGs identification) Using PsychENCODE data (three PFC RNA‐Seq datasets) and
  new peripheral blood RNA‐Seq data, 70% were used for differential expression gene
  (DEG) analysis. DEGs in each dataset were identified by intersecting DESeq2, EdgeR,
  and Limma results, then subjected to support vector machine (SVM)‐based feature
  elimination to identify DREGs. (Biological significance analysis of SCZ DREGs) Protein–protein
  interaction analysis used a self‐constructed latest human interactome. GO and KEGG
  analyses revealed SCZ‐related pathway enrichment. DREGs expression were validated
  in human brain tissues and SCZ models. PRS analysis assessed DREGs'' genetic contribution
  comparable to genome‐wide PRS. (Evaluation of DREGs'' SCZ characterization) Eight
  top machine learning models performed tenfold cross‐validation on 70% of PFC and
  blood RNA‐Seq data to obtain the best characterization model. The best model was
  used to validate DREGs'' SCZ characterization in three independent datasets: internal
  test set, external test set (Dataset 2), and SCZ/non‐SCZ patient set (Dataset 3).
  Results were evaluated using AUC values of ROC curves. SCZ: schizophrenia; PFC:
  prefrontal cortex; DREGs: disease‐responsive essential genes; PPI: protein–protein
  interaction; PRS: polygenic risk score; ROC: receiver operating characteristic;
  AUC: area under the curve; LR: logistic regression; DT: decision tree; RF: random
  forest; ET: extra tree; GBDT: gradient boosting decision tree; XGBoost: eXtreme
  gradient boosting; SVM: support vector machine; MLP: multilayer perceptron'
