caption: Schematic illustrating the results. P. aeruginosa interacts with the airway
  epithelial cells of CF patients, notably by activating the TLR5 signaling pathway
  through its virulence factor, flagellin. This activation, dependent on p38 MAPK
  and NF-kB, leads to an increase in TMPRSS2 which could regulate SARS-CoV2 infectivity.
