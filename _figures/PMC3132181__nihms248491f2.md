caption: DNA damage (induction of DSBs) triggers activation of ATM () which in turn
  phosphorylates Chk2 on Thr68 causing its dimerization. Phosphorylation of Chk2 can
  also be mediated by ATR but this occurs in response to replication stress rather
  than DSB. Within the dimer of Chk2 phosphorylation at Thr383, Thr387 and Ser516
  takes place which leads to dissociation of the dimer onto monomers. Both multiphosphorylated
  dimers and monomers of Chk2 are enzymatically active and able to phosphorylate the
  downstream substrates. Among these substrates are the Cdc25C and Cdc25A phosphatases
  whose phosphorylation by Chk2 promotes binding to a 14-3-3 protein () thereby preventing
  translocation into the nucleus and dephosphorylation of inhibitory phospohorylations
  at Thr14 and Tyr15 on cyclin/CDK complexes. This halts cell cycle transitions from
  G2 to M (Cdc25C) and G1 to S, (Cdc25A) respectively. Phosphorylation of Cdc25 phosphatases
  also accelerates their proteasomal degradation (). A redundant mechanism of cell
  arrest in G1 involves phosphorylation of p53 by Chk2 which may lead to upregulation
  of the cdk2 inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1. Phosphorylation of p53 may also result in upregulation
  of the proapoptotic protein Bax. Apoptosis may additionally be promoted by phosphorylation
  of PML and E2F-1. Phosphorylation of BRCA1 engages it in the DNA repair pathway.
