caption: Either NPC1 or NPC2 loss of function leads to storage of unesterified cholesterol
  in lysosomes. The consequent oxidative stress promotes non-enzymatic oxidation of
  cholesterol leading to production of oxysterols (e.g., 7-KC and C-triol) that enter
  the circulation. C-triol is taken up by the liver and metabolized to TCA and to
  its glycinated derivative, TCG, which may enter the blood following bile acid secretion
  and uptake into the entero-hepatic circulation. The biosynthetic pathway for APCS
  species is unknown but catabolism may involve lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase. NPC1
  or NPC2 deficiency creates an acid sphingomyelinase-deficient state allowing accumulation
  of APCS and eventual release into the circulation.
