caption: ER stress is sensed by three ER transmembrane proteins, ATF6α, IRE1α, and
  PERK, which are crucial for mediating the adaptive and apoptotic signaling of the
  UPR. ATF6α translocates to the Golgi upon sensing ER stress, where it is cleaved
  and subsequently trafficked to the nucleus where it upregulates chaperones and proteins
  involved in ERAD. IRE1α oligomerizes and autophosphorylates in response to ER stress,
  and acts through several mechanisms. The endonuclease domain is involved in RIDD,
  as well as transcription through activating the transcription factor XBP1. IRE1α
  also promotes apoptosis through activation of ASK and subsequent phosphorylation
  of JNK. PERK oligomerizes upon sensing ER stress, and autophosphorylates. The canonical
  target of PERK kinase activity is eIF2α, which acts through ATF4 to promote expression
  of chaperones, and proteins involved in ERAD, amino acid metabolism, the oxidative
  stress response, and UPR-mediated apoptosis. eIF2α also serves to attenuate nonessential
  mRNA translation. CHOP, a stress-induced transcription factor, is upregulated downstream
  of ATF4 and mediates ER stress-induced apoptosis. Gad34, another transcriptional
  target of this pathway, dephosphorylates eIF2α, thus resuming translation which
  can lead to apoptosis by increasing oxidative protein folding. ASK, apoptosis-signal-regulating
  kinase; CHOP, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase; PERK, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; RIDD, regulated
  IRE1-dependent decay; UPR, unfolded protein response.

  description: ER stress is sensed by three ER transmembrane proteins, ATF6α, IRE1α,
    and PERK, which are crucial for mediating the adaptive and apoptotic signaling
    of the UPR. ATF6α translocates to the Golgi upon sensing ER stress, where it is
    cleaved and subsequently trafficked to the nucleus where it upregulates chaperones
    and proteins involved in ERAD. IRE1α oligomerizes and autophosphorylates in response
    to ER stress, and acts through several mechanisms. The endonuclease domain is
    involved in RIDD, as well as transcription through activating the transcription
    factor XBP1. IRE1α also promotes apoptosis through activation of ASK and subsequent
    phosphorylation of JNK. PERK oligomerizes upon sensing ER stress, and autophosphorylates.
    The canonical target of PERK kinase activity is eIF2α, which acts through ATF4
    to promote expression of chaperones, and proteins involved in ERAD, amino acid
    metabolism, the oxidative stress response, and UPR-mediated apoptosis. eIF2α also
