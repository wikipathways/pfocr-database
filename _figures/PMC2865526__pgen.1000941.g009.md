caption: Our results suggest in germ cells and embryos GGR is the major pathway contributing
  to repair and survival of UV induced DNA damage, while TCR has a secondary role.
  As embryos develop to become L1 larvae, this role of GGR becomes less important.
  From L1 larvae to adults, TCR is the major pathway involved in survival of UV irradiation,
  whereas GGR is still active but has a secondary role. The precise function of the
  chromatin remodeling genes that are implicated in the UV-DDR is not yet clear. Some
  may function to modulate TCR, but others may have a more general regulatory function.
