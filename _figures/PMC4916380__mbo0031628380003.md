caption: Protein changes of the central metabolic pathway in C. tyrobutyricum. The
  protein changes are from TMT-labeled identification results. Genes which products
  were identified are indicated in blue. Genes indicated in black are those genes
  whose products were not identified in TMT-labeled samples but were identified in
  label-free samples. Genes indicated in red are those genes whose products were not
  identified both in TMT-labeled and label-free peptide samples. Glucose-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  Fdox, oxidized ferredoxin.
