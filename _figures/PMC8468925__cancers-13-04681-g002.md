caption: Strategies to restore the tumor-suppressive function of mutant p53. Wild-type
  p53 regulates the transcription of proapoptotic genes. In response to DNA damage,
  mutant p53 fails to activate proapoptotic genes. p53-independent ATM-dependent transcription
  leads to the activation of strong prosurvival signals. This effect can be counteracted
  by CDK inhibitors that suppress RNA polymerase II function. Other strategies to
  restore normal p53 function involve altering the configuration of mutant p53 by
  PRIMA-1 and APR-246, as well as its proteasomal degradation facilitated by HSP90
  inhibition.
