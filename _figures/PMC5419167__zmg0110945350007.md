caption: Model for genomic and nongenomic cross talk of the GnRHR and GR signaling
  pathways on the GnRHR promoter in LβT2 cells. A proposed model for GR-mediated regulation
  of the GnRHR promoter in LβT2 cells in the absence (A) or presence of dex (B) or
  GnRH (C) or both dex and GnRH (D) is shown. The GR is depicted in two different
  conformations, one activated by dex with the GR phosphorylated at Ser-220 and Ser-234
  (indicated by PP) and another activated by GnRH via the GnRHR, G-protein q (Gq)
  ( ), PKC, or ERK pathway, with the GR phosphorylated at Ser-234 (indicated by P).
  We speculate that a transcription factor X(X) bound at an as yet unidentified response
  element (RE) is required for the dex response in B, because we do not obtain a dex
  response on a simple AP-1 reporter construct. The coactivator GRIP-1 is shown associated
  with the dex-activated GR in B and D, consistent with our results. We speculate
  that another as yet unidentified coactivator Y(Y) is associated with the GnRH-activated
  GR in C. Consistent with our data, we depict the recruitment of SRC-1 coactivator
  only in D. The model would be consistent with our data, although it should be noted
  that we have no direct proof for the monomer vs. dimer status of the GR or for a
  direct interaction between the GR and AP-1 proteins or factor X or for a lack of
  involvement of other cofactors, kinases, or phosphatases not investigated.
