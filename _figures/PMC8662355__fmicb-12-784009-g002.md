caption: GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis during coronavirus infections. After recognizing
  and binding to the cell surface receptor, the coronavirus enters the cell through
  internalization and carries out transcription and translation processes inside cells.
  Intracellular viral RNA initiates signaling through cytosolic pattern recognition
  receptors, such as NLRP1, NLRP3, and AIM2. PRRs recognize viral RNA and recruit
  ASC and pro-caspase-1 to form inflammasome and promote caspase-1 activation. Activated
  caspase-1 promotes the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Meanwhile, GSDMD is
  cleaved by caspase-1 within the linker between the GSDMD N-terminal and GSDMD C-terminal
  domains. The GSDMD N-terminal domain binds to the cell membrane and oligomerizes
  to form a pore. Pore formation leads to the influx of water molecules and the secretion
  of IL-1β and IL-18, which eventually leads to cell swelling and subsequent pyroptosis.
  The nucleoprotein of some coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV-2, can effectively block
  the caspase-1 mediated cleavage of GSDMD by binding the GSDMD linker region. Furthermore,
  3C-like protease of coronavirus incorrectly cleaves GSDMD and produces a non-functional
  N-terminal. Coronaviruses escape from GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis through the pathways
  mentioned above. In addition to the canonical pyroptosis pathway, caspase-4/5/11
  can also induce pyroptosis through the non-canonical pathway. LPS binds to procaspase-4/5/11
  and promotes the activation of caspase-4/5/11. Activated caspase-4/5/11 can also
  cleave the GSDMD linker to generate the pore-forming GSDMD-N terminal, causing potassium
  (K+) outflow and NLRP3 inflammasome activation leading to pyroptosis.
