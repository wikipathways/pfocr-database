  The figure illustrates the signaling flow and crosstalk, together with positive
  (black arrows), dotted line or negative (red) control for the cascades. Classically,
  two tumor suppressors, NF1 and NF2, have been implicated in the peripheral nerve
  sheath tumors. NF1 (neurofibromin) converts active Ras (GTP-bound) to inactive Ras
  (GDP-bound). Activated GTP-Ras increases cell growth by evoking mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (also known as the Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK pathway, box
  1) as well as PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling (box 2) [38,39,40,41]. These signal pathways
  mediate a wide variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, survival,
  and differentiation. NF2 (Merlin), box 3, is implicated as a negative regulator
  of Rac1, mTOR, and Hippo/YAP signaling, as well as the MAPK signaling pathway, the
  activation of all increases cell growth [42]. Recent genetic studies have shown
  that mutations in LZTR1, SMARCB1, and COQ6 cause schwannomatosis. Loss of LZTR1
  functions decrease the ubiquitination of Ras, thereby overactivating MAPK signaling.
  Dysregulation of the Ras–MARK signaling pathway presents clinically as a set of
  disorders of RASopathy (NF1, Noonan syndrome, etc.) [43]. A Ras GTPase, RIT1, has
  emerged as a driver of human diseases, i.e., Noonan syndrome and cancer. The mechanism
  is ascribed to the inability of RIT1 variants to interact with LZTR1, which hampers
  the protein degradation of RIT1 [44,45]. INF2 elongates and severs the linear F-actin
  filaments. INF2 also controls gene transcription by facilitating the nuclear transition
  of MRTF and activating the transcription of serum response factor (SRF) target genes,
  which encode structural and regulatory effectors of actin dynamics [46]. Abbreviations:
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; YAP, yes-associated
  protein; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PAK1, p21-activated kinase 1; LZTR1,
  leucine-zipper-like transcriptional regulator 1; RIT1, GTP-binding protein Rit1;
  SRF, serum response factor, MRTF, myocardin-related transcription factors'
