caption: The lipid peroxidation pathway and the antioxidant system of ferroptosis.
  System xc− exports glutamate out of the cell and imports cystine into the cell.
  Cystine in the cell is reduced to cysteine, which combined with glycine and glutamate
  for the synthesis of GSH. GSH is a synthetic substrate for glutathione peroxidase
  4 (GPX4), which can resist lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. FSP1 is transferred
  to the plasma membrane through myristoylation, where it mediates the reduction of
  CoQ10 to ubiquinol using NAD(P)H, which inhibits lipid peroxides. Vitamin E can
  inhibit lipid peroxidation with its radical-trapping activities. GSH, glutathione;
  FSP1, ferroptosis suppressor protein 1; CoQ10, coenzyme Q10; NAD(P)H, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate.
