caption: 'Scheme of the Rho signaling canonical pathway identified in Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis of the proteins with altered expression in both KO cell lines. To this
  IPA pathway were added: ARHGDI (Rho-GDI1), ARHGDI2 (Rho-GDI2), ARHGEF1 (GEFh1),
  ARHGEF10 (GEF10) as these had altered expression in one or both cell lines based
  on proteomics or qRT-PCR (supplemental Fig. S4). Appropriate interactions were made
  using the connect option or the path explorer option. The figure was overlaid with
  the mass spectroscopy data: red represents up-regulated and green represents down-regulated
  proteins, groups of proteins are indicated with double circles.'
