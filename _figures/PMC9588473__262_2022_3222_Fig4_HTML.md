caption: 'Bioinformatics analysis of DKK3 and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer
  (GDSC) database analysis. A A protein–protein interaction network was constructed
  among the whole gene sets related to the immune system process; B a protein–protein
  interaction network was constructed among the gene sets associated with the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway; C grouping of networks based on functionally enriched GO terms and pathways
  using Cytoscape software (version 3.9.0) and ClueGO application (version 2.5.8)
  (https://cytoscape.org/): DKK3 is indirectly linked to immune cell regulation (CD4 + and
  CD8 + T cells) as well as signal pathways related to migration, invasion and apoptosis;

  concentration (LN IC50) values of navitoclax (ABT-263) in GBM cancer cell lines
  (red, low DKK3 expression; gray, high DKK3 expression). Boxplot showing the LN IC50
