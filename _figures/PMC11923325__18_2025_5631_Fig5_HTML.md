caption: Downregulation of TLR signaling. Several cellular factors generated by the
  TLRs stimulation downregulate the TLRs signaling pathways. Interleukin-1 receptor
  (IL-1R)-associated kinase M, or IRAK-M, prevents the IRAK1-IRAK4 complex from separating
  from the receptor. It is likely that SOCS1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1)
  binds to IRAK1 and prevents it from functioning. Myeloid differentiation primary-response
  protein 88 (MyD88s) prevents IRAK4 from attaching itself to MyD88. It has also been
  demonstrated that SIGIRR (single immunoglobulin IL-1R-related molecule) and ST2,
  TIR (Toll/IL-1R)-domain-containing receptors, adversely affect TLR signaling. TRAF6,
  tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6; IKK, IκB kinase; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor-κB; TIRAP, TIR-domain containing adaptor protein; IκB, inhibitor of NF-κB
