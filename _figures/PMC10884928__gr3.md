caption: Prevotella along with NR supplements improving the signaling pathway of BCAA
  metabolism in MASLDNAD precursor supplements can affect fatty acid oxidation and
  lipid synthesis as well as the TCA cycle and insulin sensitivity. Simultaneously,
  Prevotella may mediate the improvement of BCAA metabolism and corresponding signaling
  pathways after NR supplementation, playing a synergistic role with NR supplementation
  in improving BCAA metabolism in MASLD. (Created with BioRender.com)
