caption: Diagram depicting the prostanoid synthesis pathway and the effects of PGE2
  on its receptor subtypes. Highlighted boxes identify prostaglandin-related genes
  that are upregulated in the gastric antrums of Lepob tissues. We hypothesize that
  upregulation of PTGES, encoding microsomal PGE2 synthase, results in increased levels
  of PGE2, which in turn results in abnormal antral slow wave and contractile activity.
  The PTGER1–3 receptors are also upregulated and likely play a role in the altered
  gastric motor activity. IP3, inositol triphosphate.
