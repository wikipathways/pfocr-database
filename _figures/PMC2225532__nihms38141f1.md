caption: Peroxynitrite, formed from superoxide and NO, causes cell injury via lipid
  peroxidation, inactivation of enzymes and other proteins by oxidation and nitration
  and also activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) just to mention a few. Peroxynitrite
  also triggers the release of proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and apoptosis
  inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria, which mediate caspase dependent and
  independent apoptotic death pathways. Peroxynitrite together with other oxidants,
  induces stand breaks in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which in turn activates PARP.
  Mild damage of DNA activates the DNA repair machinery, but once excessive oxidative/nitrosative
  stress-induced damage occurs (like in various forms of myocardial reperfusion injury
  and heart failure), overactivated PARP initiates an energy-consuming cycle by transferring
  adenosine diphosphateribose units from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)
  to nuclear proteins. This process will lead to depletion of the intracellular NAD+
  and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pools, slowing the rate of glycolysis and mitochondrial
  respiration, eventually culminating to cardiovascular dysfunction or death. Poly
  (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) degrades poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymers, generating
  free PAR polymer and ADP-ribose. PARP also regulates the expression of a variety
  of inflammatory mediators, which may facilitate the progression of heart failure.
