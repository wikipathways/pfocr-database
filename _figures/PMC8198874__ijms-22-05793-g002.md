caption: 'Summary of Ceramide Synthesis Pathways. A summarized schematic of the biosynthesis
  pathways which may produce ceramide, including the de novo pathway (right) and the
  salvage pathway (bottom). All sphingoid bases are depicted in blue. The de novo
  pathway begins with synthesis of the sphingoid base sphinganine and ends with ceramide
  desaturation. Sphinganine is also capable of producing phytosphingosine or sphinganine-1-phosphate.
  The salvage pathway consists of two streams: SM hydrolysis and GSL recycling. SM
  is converted to ceramide through the hydrolysis of the phosphocholine unit. The
  components of complex GSLs can also be recycled to reform ceramide through stepwise
  hydrolysis of carbohydrate units, eventually leaving a simple GSL such as GlcCer,
  depicted above. GlcCer is then converted to ceramide by glucocerebrosidase. GSL:
  glycosphingolipid; SM: sphingomyelin; aSMAase: acid sphingomyelinase; GlcCer: glucosylceramide;
  GBA: glucocerebrosidase; CoA: acyl coenzyme-A; CoA SH: coenzyme A; SphK; sphingosine
  kinase; CerS: ceramide synthase.'
