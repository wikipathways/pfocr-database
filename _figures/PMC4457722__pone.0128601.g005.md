caption: 'Global Interaction Proteome of (a) STS treated cells and (b) B2I+STS treated
  cells. The green rectangles, violet rectangles and blue hexagons are reflective
  of biological processes, disease processes and functional classes, respectively.
  The different colors of proteins reflect their alteration: upregulated (red), downregulated
  (orange), downregulated and unique to the treated group (yellow). The green highlights
  represent the detrimental effects observed following STS or B2I+STS treatment and
  the pink highlight represents the protective effect observed following B2I+STS treatment.
  STS: Staurosporine, B2I: Bradykinin 2 receptor inhibited. Creatine kinase B-type
  [], designated by blue highlight is shown to be upregulated in the STS+ B2I treatment
  where cell survival pathway was detected.'
