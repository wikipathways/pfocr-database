caption: Schematic illustrating the possible mechanisms of neuroprotective effects
  of VPA after TBI. As illustrated, TBI-induced microglial activation initiates neuron-glia
  neuroinflammatory by producing a wide array of proinflammatory factors or mediators
  such as TNF, IL and INF. Under inflammatory conditions, elevated ROS can enhance
  Keap1 oxidation causing release of Nrf2. After translocation to the nucleus, Nrf2
  binds to antioxidant response element (ARE) initiating expression of antioxidative
  genes. The expression and translocation of Nrf2 is related to histone deacetylase
  (HDAC) enzymatic activity and the levels of histone acetylation. VPA controls antioxidant
  levels and autophagy through regulation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway by inhibiting
  both the expression and activity of HDAC3. This inhibition further reduces TBI-induced
  microglial activation and the subsequent inflammatory response, ultimately leading
  to neuroprotection.
