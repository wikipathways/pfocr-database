caption: Wolbachia-mediated virus inhibition in arthropods. Wolbachia-mediated virus
  inhibition is likely a cumulative effect arising from multiple roadblocks at different
  stages of virus life cycle. 1. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in a Wolbachia-infected
  cell that might lead to stress granule (SG) assembly (inset (A)); 2. Moreover, competition
  for intracellular cholesterol and amino acids (inset (B)) between virus and Wolbachia
  may lead to metabolite depletion, giving rise to ER stress in the cell and vice
  versa; 3. Presence of Wolbachia can also trigger expression of host miRNAs, antimicrobial
  peptides (AMPs) and genes associated with antiviral immunity (e.g., Dnmt2, Toll
  pathway genes); 4. Modulation of the cellular cytoskeletal network (depicted as
  green dashed lines) by Wolbachia might disrupt vesicular trafficking, thus affecting
  virus entry and/or exit steps; 5. Cholesterol depletion in membranes might affect
  viral genome uncoating and delivery into the cytoplasm (inset (A)); 6. Additionally,
  lack of cholesterol in membranes (shown in red) might disrupt assembly and functionality
  of viral replication complexes (RCs), abrogating viral genome replication; 7. Post-transcriptional
  modification (PTM) of viral RNA (vRNA) by the host RNA methyltransferase Dnmt2 might
  allow viral RNA trafficking to SGs, leading to inhibition of viral genome replication;
  8. PTM of vRNA on its own can also compromise its ability to be replicated, leading
  to reduced viral protein synthesis; 9. PTM modified and/or Dnmt2-bound vRNA might
  also lead to RNAi-mediated virus inhibition; 10. Modified vRNA may also cause improper
  packaging into virions; 11. Defects in virion structure and/or modified nature of
  the encapsidated vRNA might result in the production of virus particles that are
  incapable of initiating a fresh round of replication in other cells, limiting virus
  spread from cell-to-cell.
