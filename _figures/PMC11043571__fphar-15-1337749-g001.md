caption: 'Mechanisms of (R)-ketamine antidepressant (partial) (R)-ketamine can activate
  ERK, thus increasing the expression of NRBP1, BDNF, and p-CREB in primary microglial
  cells. At the same time, it promotes the release of glutamate into the synaptic
  cleft, enhances AMPAR flux, activates cellular signaling, and increases the synaptic
  protein translation of AMPAR subunits and PSD-95, thereby promoting the formation
  of synapses and dendrites. Additionally, (R)-ketamine can regulate TGF-β signaling
  in microglial cells, increase the release of BDNF, and subsequently promote binding
  with the TrkB receptor. Through the MEK-ERK-CREB signaling pathway, it can enhance
  synaptogenesis and dendritogenesis, thus exhibiting its antidepressant effects.
  Furthermore, the antidepressant mechanism of (R)-ketamine may also involve the microbiome-gut-brain
  axis, the brain-spleen axis pathway, and the regulation of miR-132-5p and NFTc4.
