caption: Schematic diagram of Nrf2 signaling and regulation in the corneal epithelial
  cells. 4-HNE or H2O2 induces excessive ROS generation (by upregulation of 3-NT,
  NOX4 protein expression), leading to oxidative stress in the cultured HCE cells
  and resulting in cell apoptosis and death of corneal epithelial cells. 4-HNE activates
  Nrf2/ARE-controlled antioxidant enzyme (NQO1 and GSTP) transcription, which facilitates
  ROS degradation. On the other hand, H2O2 decreases Nrf2/ARE-controlled SOD and catalase
  transcription, leading to ROS degradation suppression. NAC serves as an antioxidant
  by antagonizing 4-HNE overexpression and reversing the cell viability of HCE cells.
  SA3K blocks H2O2-induced ROS, 3-NT, and NOX4 overexpression and upregulates ROS
  degradation by activating Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway.
