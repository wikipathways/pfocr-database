caption: 'Regulation network of circRNAs in cancer. CircRNA can act as sponge of miRNA
  or combine with protein to indirectly regulate gene expression in cancer. Circ-Foxo3,
  circDOCK and circUBAP2 are involved in regulating apoptosis in cancer. CircMTO1,
  circ100284, hsa_circ_0013958 and circTCF25 can regulate cell cycle through indirectly
  regulating cell cycle proteins in cancer. CiRS-7, circITCH, ciR-MYLK, circ-TTBK2
  and circ_0009910 are involved in cell proliferation partly through PI3K/AKT pathway,
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway VEGFA/VEGFR2 pathway and JAK1/STAT3 pathway, respectively.
  CircHIAT1, circLARP4 and circHIPK3 are involved in invasion or metastasis through
  indirectly regulating CDC42, LATS1, and Heparanase in cancer, respectively. Different
  colores indicate different types of molecules: orange represents circRNA, pink represents
  miRNA, blue represents coding gene, gray represents signaling pathway'
