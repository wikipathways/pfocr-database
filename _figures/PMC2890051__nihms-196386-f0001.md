caption: 'Many tumor cells require a high rate of glycolysis to meet both bioenergetic
  (ATP) requirements and biosynthetic requirements as follows: A] Both glycolysis
  (glucose to lactate pathway), initiated by mitochondrial bound hexokinase (green),
  and oxidative phosphorylation [supported by NADH and FADH not shown] derived from
  the TCA cycle and terminating with the ATP synthase F1 headpiece (red)] result in
  the necessary ATP to meet the tumor’s energy (ATP) requirements. B] The high glycolytic
  flux initiated and facilitated by G-6-P formation via mitochondrial bound hexokinase
  (green) also leads to additional metabolites for both RNA/DNA biosynthesis and fatty
  acid synthesis. These are essential for tumor cell proliferation resulting in the
  subjugation of the surrounding normal tissue. C] By efflux of both lactic acid and
  protons, the tumor creates a “poisonous” environment for the surrounding normal
  tissue, most likely to promote a “death zone” around the tumor into which it can
  slowly encroach. [Abbreviations: ETC, electron transport chain; PIC, phosphate carrier;
  ANT, adenine nucleotide transporter (carrier); VDAC, voltage dependent anion channel;
  G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; OAA, oxaloacetic acid.] (Note: The ATP synthase is now
  known to be in complex formation with the phosphate carrier (PIC) and the adenine
  nucleotide carrier (ANC) to give an ATP synthase/PIC/ANC complex called the “ATP
  synthasome” (Ref.: Ko, Y.H., Delannoy, M., Hullihen, J., Chiu, W., and Pedersen,
  P.L. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 12305-12309).'
