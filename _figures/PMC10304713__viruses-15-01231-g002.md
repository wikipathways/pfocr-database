caption: SARS-CoV-2 employs different mechanisms to activate the host’s innate immune
  system. Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize viral RNA and activate the NFκB transcription
  factor to induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons.
  TLR’s cytoplasmic domain recruits the adaptor protein dMyD88, which triggers a signaling
  pathway that eventually releases NFκB from its cytoplasmic inhibitor. Once released,
  NFκB translocates into the nucleus where it activates transcription of genes encoding
  proinflammatory cytokines and induces IFN gene expression. The interferon regulatory
  factor (IRF) proteins remain inactive in the cytoplasm until they are phosphorylated.
  Once activated, they translocate to the nucleus as active transcription factors.
  IRF3 and IRF7, two of the nine members in the IRF family, are vital for the expression
  of antiviral type I interferons and play a critical role in TLR signaling. The Janus
  kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway is
  a rapid signaling pathway utilized by numerous cytokine receptors to activate the
  transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Coronaviruses use papain-like
  protease (PLpro), NSP1, ORF3b, and N protein to evade the host innate immune system
  by inhibiting two transcription factors, IRF3 and IRF7, which are necessary for
  IFN transcription
