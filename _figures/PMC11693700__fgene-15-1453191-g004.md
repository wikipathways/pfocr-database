caption: The role of VHL and β-TrCP in the Ferroptosis signaling pathway. In VHL-deficient
  cells, HIF-2α is not ubiquitinated and degraded by VHL, leading to an increase in
  HILPDA expression and accumulation of PUFA, which in turn promotes the accumulation
  of lipid peroxides and triggers ferroptosis. TAZ can induce lipid peroxide accumulation
  and trigger ferroptosis through the EMP1-NOX4 pathway, while β-TrCP can ubiquitinate
  and degrade TAZ to terminate this process
