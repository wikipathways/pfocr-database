caption: The activation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway with endogenous DNA as an
  example. When cGAS bind to DNA, ATP and GTP act as substrates to activate cGAS to
  catalyze the formation of cGAMP, which is a second messenger to activate STING.
  cGAMP also transactivates STING in adjacent cells with the help of gap junction
  proteins such as Cx32. Activated STING is firstly palmitoylated in the Golgi apparatus
  and then recruits the TBK1. Conversely, the C-terminal domain of STING is phosphorylated
  by TBK1, and phosphorylated STING recruits RF3, which is also phosphorylated and
  dimerizes by TBK1. Finally, dimerized IRF3 enters the nucleus and plays its role
  in the transcription of IFN-1 and ISGs. Moreover, STING can also bind to IKK and
  activate its mediated NF-κB.
