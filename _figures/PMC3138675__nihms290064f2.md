caption: 'Molecular mechanisms in hereditary cancer. Panel A: The WNT signaling pathway.
  The transcription factor, β-catenin, is sequestered by APC in a complex and thus
  marked for degradation by the proteasome. In familial adenomatous polyposis, mutations
  in the APC complex result in excessive free β-catenin which can translocate to the
  nucleus and interact with the promoter, TCF-Lef. This binding facilitates cell proliferation
  via c-myc and cyclin D1. Panel B: Mismatch repair. In hereditary non-polyposis colon
  cancer, proteins which recognize and repair DNA are mutated. Thus, errors in replication
  are not recognized. Panel C: PTEN/Akt. Defects in PTEN, a tumor suppressor, result
  in Cowden’s syndrome. PTEN normally inhibits the PI3 kinase/Akt complex. If PTEN
  does not inhibit this complex, growth signals progress unchecked. Panel D: TGFβ/SMAD.
  Germline mutations in the SMAD transcription factors are responsible for familial
  juvenile polyposis. These proteins are the dominant mediators of the Transforming
  Growth Factor (TGF) family. In the absence of inhibition, the SMAD molecules translocate
  to the nucleus where they promote growth enhancing genes. Wnt; Wingless, APC; adenomatous
  polyposis coli, GSK3β; glycogen synthase kinase, Tcf/Lef; T-cell factor/lymphocyte
  enhancing factor, PTEN; phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10,
  Akt; protein kinase B, a serine/threonine protein kinase, mTOR; mammalian target
  of rapamycin, mdm2; murine double minute, an inhibitor of p53, Smad; mothers against
  decapentaplegic homolog.'
