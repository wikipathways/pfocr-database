caption: Folate-mediated 1-carbon metabolism. Folate-activated 1-carbons are utilized
  in the synthesis of purines and thymidylate (dTMP) and in the methylation of homocysteine
  to methionine. Methionine can be converted to a methyl donor through its adenosylation
  to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). Mitochondrial-derived formate traverses to the
  cytoplasm, where it is incorporated into the folate-activated 1-carbon pool. Nuclear
  folate metabolism occurs through the SUMO-dependent import of the de novo thymidylate
  synthase pathway from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (,). SHMT isozymes are present
  in each of these 3 compartments and function to generate single carbons from the
  hydroxymethyl group of serine in the form of 5,10-methylene-THF. The 1-carbon unit
  is labeled in bold. MTHFD1, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; MTR, methionine
  synthase; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; SHMT1, cytoplasmic serine
