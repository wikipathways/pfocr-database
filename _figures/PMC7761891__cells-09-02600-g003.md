caption: The effects of extracellular nutrients on mitochondria could activate the
  integrated stress response (ISR) pathway in cancer. Changes in extracellular nutrient
  availability can induce changes in mitochondrial function leading to decreased oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS), namely mitochondrial ATP synthesis fueled by respiration.
  A decrease in OXPHOS can activate the mitochondrial protease OMA1, which cleaves
  the mitochondrial protein DELE1. The short form of DELE 1 can be released to the
  cytosol, bind to the Heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI) and activate its function.
  HRI phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a (eIF2 a), which
  inhibits protein translation, with the exception of the transcription factor ATF4.
  The actions of ATF4 in the nucleus execute the ISR to induce cell cycle arrest and
  even apoptosis.
