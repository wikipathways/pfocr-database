caption: Diagram showing the metabolic pathway of succinic acid of engineered E. coli
  under anaerobic condition. The dissimilation metabolic pathway of methanol and formate
  and a new pathway of fixing CO2 were introduced. G6P glucose-6-phosphate, G3P 3-phosphate-glyceraldehyde,
  PEP phosphoenolpyruvic acid, OAA oxaloacetate, PYC pyruvate, Mdh methanol dehydrogenase,
  Fdh formate dehydrogenase, Pyc pyruvate carboxylase
