caption: The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Proteins are first tagged with ubiquitin
  and subsequently recognized and degraded by the proteasome. This system includes
  ubiquitin, ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s),
  and ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s), which mediate the ubiquitination process. The
  process also involves deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and proteasomal degradation
  facilitated by the 26S proteasome
