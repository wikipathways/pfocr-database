caption: 'Differential expression of genes involved in indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis
  pathway in Bo257 (R_mock vs. R_Ab) and Bo190 (S_mock vs. S_Ab) after Ab infection.
  (A) The indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway. IAOx: indole-3-acetaldoxime;
  ICA: indole-3-carboxylic acid; ICN: indole-3-carbonylnitrile; 4OH-ICN: 4-hydroxy-indole-3-carbonylnitrile;
  IAN: indole-3-acetonitrile; GSH: glutathione; Desulfo GSL: desulfoglucosinolate;
  I3G: indole-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate; 1HO-I3M: 1-hydroxy-indole-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate;
  4HO-I3M: 4-hydroxy-indole-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate; 1MI3G: 1-methoxyindole-3-ylmethyl
  glucosinolate; 4MI3G: 4-methoxyindole-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate. Red X symbol indicates
  the loss of 4OH–ICN biosynthetic gene CYP82C2 and camalexin biosynthetic gene CYP71B15
  (PAD3) in cabbage. (B) Expression profiles of genes involved in the indolic glucosinolate
  pathway. Values in the heatmap are shown as log2 fold changes. Grey box without
  value indicates no differential expression between the mock and Ab inoculation'
