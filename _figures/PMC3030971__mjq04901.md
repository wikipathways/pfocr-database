caption: Key proteins and pathways in the replication stress response network. Black
  arrows/bars indicate activation/suppression pathways or interactions between proteins;
  red arrows indicate some of the known phosphorylation events by indicated PIKs.
  Note that several proteins, such as RPA and ATR, have roles in more than one pathway
  in this network.
