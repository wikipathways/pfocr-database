caption: Data from Meta-All visualised in Vanted. Visualisation of the sucrose breakdown
  pathway in the potato tuber [12]. The pathway data stored in META-ALL was exported
  into an SBML file using the SBML export filter. The file was subsequently loaded
  into the network visualisation system VANTED [22]. As the SBML format does not specify
  a layout of the model, an automatic force directed layout was applied which served
  as a starting point for the manual refinement of the overall model layout.
