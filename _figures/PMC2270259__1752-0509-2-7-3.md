caption: Predicted vs. measured metabolic fluxes in the E. coli central metabolism.
  Comparisons between the FBAwMC-predicted- (orange plots) and measured (blue plots)
  fluxes as a function of growth/dilution rates for selected reactions in the central
  carbon metabolism of E. coli. The experimental flux measurements were performed
  at dilution rates 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.55 and 0.72 h-1. Selected reactions of glycolysis
  (red boxes), the first reaction of the pentose phosphate pathway (zwf) (magenta
  box), the TCA cycle (blue boxes), acetate excretion pathway (green boxes) and the
  reactions catalyzed by ppc and aceE connecting the glycolytic- and TCA pathways
  (yellow boxes) are shown. The solid black circles represent the denoted metabolites
  while the black arrows represent metabolic reactions labeled by the genes encoding
  the enzymes catalyzing the respective reactions (see Table S1 in Additional file
  4 for the list of abbreviations and information on enzymes encoded by listed genes).
  The error bars for predicted fluxes indicate the standard deviation over 1,000 choices
  of the crowding coefficients among the list of values estimated for ~100 E. coli
  enzymes, whereas the error bars for the experimental fluxes represent the standard
  deviations for three independent measurements.
