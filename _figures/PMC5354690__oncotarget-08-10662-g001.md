caption: The FoxO1 upstream signals including IGFs, insulin and IRS regulate FoxO1
  transcriptional activity through phosphorylating FoxO1 in a PI3K-Akt dependent manner.
  Phosphorylated FoxO1 will be excluded from nucleus and thus loses its capacity of
  binding to target regulatory elements. In addition, other signals, such as cGKI
  and Rho/ROCK signaling, directly mediate FoxO1 transcriptional activity by phosphorylation.
  Myostatin, MEF2C, MyoD and mTOR are downstream factors of FoxO1. FoxO1 negatively
  regulates myoblast early differentiation through promoting myostatin and inhibiting
  MEF2C, MyoD and mTOR. Then the decrease of MEF2C, MyoD and mTOR delays myoblast
  early differentiation. In addition, the relationship among FoxO1, mTOR, IGF-II and
  PI3K/Akt pathway presents a feedback loop that can preferably fine-tune the regulation
  of muscle differentiation. Moreover, FoxO1 can inhibit early step of myoblast differentiation
  through interacting with Notch signaling and promoting corepressor clearance and
  recruiting the coactivator of Csl, leading activation of Hes family, which is considered
  to be a myoblast differentiation repressor. Notably, although FoxO1 suppresses the
  early muscle differentiation process, FoxO1 is required for myoblast terminal differentiation
  fusion into myotubes. However, the molecular mechanism in which FoxO1 is required
  for myotube fusion has remained poorly understood.
