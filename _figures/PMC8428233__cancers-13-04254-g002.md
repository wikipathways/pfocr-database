caption: TRβ regulates various oncogenic signaling pathways in cancer models that
  govern cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. TRβ has shown to be a significant
  regulator of various oncogenic cell signaling pathways in diverse models of normal
  and cancer cells. TRβ decreases TGF-β signaling resulting in decreased SMAD phosphorylation
  and transcription of EMT markers. TRβ differentially regulates JAK-STAT signaling
  pathways which results in decreased STAT3 signaling and enhanced STAT1 response
  to induce apoptosis. TRβ activation can reduce the cancer stem cell population as
  evident by decreased levels of CD44 and increased CD24 in breast and thyroid cancer
  models, leading to attenuated NANOG levels. TRβ also has potent inhibitory effects
  on PI3K signaling whether via direct binding to the p85α subunit or through genomic
  mechanisms to increase transcripts of phosphoinositol phosphatases and decrease
  receptor tyrosine kinases. TRβ also modulates cell cycle genes in various cancer
  models to enhance expression and phosphorylation of Rb to stall the cell cycle.
  These potent effects on cancer cell transcriptional reprogramming allow for enhanced
  efficacy of targeted inhibitors on the PI3K pathway and cell cycle.
