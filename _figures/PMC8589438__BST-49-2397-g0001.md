caption: Many anti-cancer drugs exert their cytotoxic effects by indirectly up-regulating
  the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins or by decreasing the expression of the pro-survival
  BCL-2 proteins. In contrast, BH3-mimetics directly antagonise the pro-survival BCL-2
  proteins, bypassing defects in upstream signalling pathways such as those mediated
  by p53, which is commonly inactivated in cancers. Direct activators of BAX or BAK
  have also been developed as an alternate mechanism for inducing apoptosis.
