caption: Canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling manipulation by pathogens occupying
  an extracellular niche. (A) C. difficile secretes toxins TcdA and TcdB which are
  phagocytosed by host cells in the intestinal and colonic epithelia. TcdA glucosyltransferase
  activity inhibits small GTPases like RacA which may inhibit pathway activity through
  inhibiting nuclear translocation of β-catenin. TcdB interacts with Wnt pathway components
  LRP6, Wnt5a, and GSK3β, and Fzd1, 2, and 7. Direct binding of Fzds prevents binding
  of endogenous Wnt ligands and silences pathway activity. This promotes epithelium
  permeability and a pro-inflammatory state. (B) During H. pylori infection of gastric
  mucosa, CagA activates canonical Wnt signaling through the breakdown of adherens
  junctions, and non-canonical Wnt signaling through stimulation of CaN and NFAT nuclear
  translocation by an unknown mechanism. Canonical pathway signaling is also activated
  through unknown T4SS effectors that induce phosphorylation of LRP and DVL and inhibit
  GSK3β, promoting cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin and subsequent nuclear translocation
  to activate genes that drive cell proliferation. Furthermore, unknown mechanisms
  induce methylation of Wnt pathway inhibitory genes SFRP1 and DKK1 to hypothetically
  facilitate Wnt signaling activity during infection. (C) P. aeruginosa is decorated
  with lectin LecB which induces β-catenin degradation through an unknown extracellular
  mechanism, resulting in decreased cell proliferation. Coincidentally, NF-κB signaling
  is activated and inflammatory target genes IL6, IL1B, and TNFA are expressed. LecB
  as well as the quorum-sensing molecule PAI both induce disruption of adherens junction
  in infected epithelia, contributing to prolonged tissue damage in the host.

  description: Canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling manipulation by pathogens
    occupying an extracellular niche. (A) C. difficile secretes toxins TcdA and TcdB
    which are phagocytosed by host cells in the intestinal and colonic epithelia.
    TcdA glucosyltransferase activity inhibits small GTPases like RacA which may inhibit
    pathway activity through inhibiting nuclear translocation of β-catenin. TcdB interacts
    with Wnt pathway components LRP6, Wnt5a, and GSK3β, and Fzd1, 2, and 7. Direct
    binding of Fzds prevents binding of endogenous Wnt ligands and silences pathway
    activity. This promotes epithelium permeability and a pro-inflammatory state.
    (B) During H. pylori infection of gastric mucosa, CagA activates canonical Wnt
    signaling through the breakdown of adherens junctions, and non-canonical Wnt signaling
    through stimulation of CaN and NFAT nuclear translocation by an unknown mechanism.
    Canonical pathway signaling is also activated through unknown T4SS effectors that
    induce phosphorylation of LRP and DVL and inhibit GSK3β, promoting cytosolic accumulation
    of β-catenin and subsequent nuclear translocation to activate genes that drive
    cell proliferation. Furthermore, unknown mechanisms induce methylation of Wnt
    pathway inhibitory genes SFRP1 and DKK1 to hypothetically facilitate Wnt signaling
    activity during infection. (C) P. aeruginosa is decorated with lectin LecB which
    induces β-catenin degradation through an unknown extracellular mechanism, resulting
    in decreased cell proliferation. Coincidentally, NF-κB signaling is activated
    and inflammatory target genes IL6, IL1B, and TNFA are expressed. LecB as well
    as the quorum-sensing molecule PAI both induce disruption of adherens junction
    in infected epithelia, contributing to prolonged tissue damage in the host.
