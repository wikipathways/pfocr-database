caption: Metabolic fluxes in glycolysis. Representation of the glycolysis pathway
  in the exponential phase panel (A) and in the stationary phase panel (B). We represent
  two values for each metabolic reaction shown, the top value is the flux of the control
  (0 mM of NaAc) and the bottom value is the flux at 8 mM of NaAc. We used red to
  represent fluxes that were lower than the control value, green to represent fluxes
  that were higher, and black to represent fluxes that were equal. The subscript _e
  corresponds to extracellular metabolites, _m to mitochondrial metabolites, and the
  rest of the metabolites are found in the cytosol.
