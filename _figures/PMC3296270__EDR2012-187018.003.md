caption: Working model of diabetes-associated accelerated atherothrombosis. Chronic
  hyperglycemia leads to increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway
  (HBP) resulting in accumulation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a substrate
  for both O- and N-linked protein glycosylation, as well as increased levels of ER
  stress. Disruptions in ER homeostasis lead to activation of the unfolded protein
  response (UPR) and downstream effects including activation of glycogen synthase
  kinase (GSK)-3. Our results suggest that ER-stress-induced GSK-3 induces proatherogenic
  processes leading to the accelerated development of atherothrombosis.
