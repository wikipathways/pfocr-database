caption: a |  In the classical model for seven-transmembrane receptor (7TMR) activation,
  signalling is mediated by G proteins and desensitization is mediated by β-arrestins.
  b |  In the current model for 7TMR activation, binding of a ligand results in activation
  of signalling by G proteins and β-arrestins, as well as desensitization and internalization
  by β-arrestins. c |  In a system with biased agonism (β-arrestin-biased in this
  example), signalling only proceeds through one pathway. EGFR, epidermal growth factor
  receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase.
