caption: 'Biosynthesis of α- and β-amyrins in the engineered Y. lipolytica. Extracellular
  carbon sources were assimilated and converted into α- and β amyrins via the mevalonate
  (MVA) pathway. Metabolites are identified in black. Endogenous and foreign genes
  that were up-regulated are listed in red and green, respectively. HMG1: hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase; ERG20: farnesyl diphosphate synthase; ERG9: squalene synthase; ERG1:
  squalene monooxygenase; CrMAS: C. roseus multifunctional amyrin synthase'
