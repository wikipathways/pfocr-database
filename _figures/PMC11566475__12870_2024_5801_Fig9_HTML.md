caption: The metabolic pathway gene association network. Pearson correlation coefficient
  was used to analyze the correlation of DEGs in the four pathways. The correlation
  index > 0.983 was set as the cut-off for correlation analysis. The results were
  displayed by Cytoscape software. Different colors indicate different functional
  genes. Table S13 legend for a detailed explanation of the sample name
