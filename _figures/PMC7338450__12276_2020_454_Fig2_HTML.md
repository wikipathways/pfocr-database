caption: Gα12 levels are lower in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and in
  patients with steatosis and/or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Gα12 transduces signals
  of deubiquitination and stabilization of SIRT1 through HIF-1α-mediated transcriptional
  control of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22). SIRT1 governs the PPARα transcriptional
  network in metabolic processes, particularly fatty acid oxidation. The Gα12pathway
  facilitates whole-body energy expenditure through USP22/SIRT1-regulated mitochondrial
  respiration. Gα13 levels in skeletal muscle are decreased in the exercise-induced
  state (a condition of energy deficiency) but are increased in mice fed an HFD or
  in patients with type 2 diabetes. Gα13-RhoA-ROCK2 phosphorylates nuclear factor
  of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) at Ser243 to inhibit NFATc1 activation. NFATc1 contributes
  to the transformation of fibers into oxidative-type fibers. Deficiency of Gα13 in
  skeletal muscle promotes energy expenditure, thereby protecting mice from metabolic
  challenge induced by NFATc1-dependent myofiber-type reprogramming.
