caption: 'The role of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in environmental pollutant-related
  ovarian aging. When short-term exposed to environmental pollutants, the Nrf2-Keap1
  pathway is activated to defend against oxidative damage in the early stage of oxidative
  stress, but when long-term exposure occurs, the antioxidant system cannot eliminate
  the excess reactive oxygen species in the cell, and it will in turn reduce the activity
  of antioxidant enzymes, inhibit the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, and exacerbate ovarian toxicity.
  Heavy metals may directly reduce antioxidant enzyme activity to damage cells. Some
