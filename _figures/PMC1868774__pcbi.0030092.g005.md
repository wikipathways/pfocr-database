caption: Each rectangle represents a snapshot of the state of a VPC. Time flows from
  top to bottom and the changes in values of components represent the evolvement of
  simulation. Both simulations are according to the mutation lin-12(gf);lin-15(o).
  Both simulations start with lin-12 activated (according to lin-12(gf) mutation),
  and let-23 activated (according to lin-15(o), no inhibition from hyp-7).(A) lin-12
  activates lst. Activation of let-23 inhibits lin-12; however, activation of lst
  prevents activation of sem-5. EGFR is counteracted and the cell assumes a 2째 fate
  (red).(B) Inhibition of let-23 on lst prevents lst activation. The EGFR pathway
  is fully activated and the cell assumes a 1째 fate (blue).
