caption: 'Direct and indirect actions of GH in controlling hepatocyte carbohydrate
  and lipid metabolism in response to nutrient deprivation (fasting, food restriction,
  diabetes type (I), and nutrient excess (overnutrition, obesity, and diabetes type
  (II)). Left panel: In the context of nutrient deprivation, circulating insulin and
  IGF1 levels are reduced, while the GH level is increased. GH promotes white adipose
  tissue lipolysis, leading to an increase in circulating non-esterified fatty acids
  (NEFA) and glycerol that serve as substrates for hepatic gluconeogenesis, fatty
  acid (β) oxidation, and ketogenesis. The NEFA released from lipolysis impairs glucose
  uptake in the skeletal muscle, due to substrate competition. There is suggestive
  evidence that GH directly stimulates gluconeogenesis and plays a role in ATP generation
  to sustain gluconeogenesis. However, it should be noted that prolonged fasting leads
  to hepatic GH resistance. Therefore, these direct actions of GH on gluconeogenesis
  may be more relevant in normal diurnal cycles of feeding and fasting. Right panel:
  In the context of nutrient excess, obesity develops and can lead to skeletal muscle
  and WAT insulin resistance, linked to inflammation. This is associated with the
  development of hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. In this context, circulating
  GH levels are reduced. Evidence collected from mouse models with the loss of hepatocyte
  GHR indicates the GHR is required to suppress steatosis by inhibiting glycolysis
  driven de novo lipogenesis (DNL). The exact mechanisms driving enhanced DNL after
  hepatocyte-specific loss of GH signaling remains to be determined and could include
  the following: (1) derepression of hepatic insulin signaling; (2) a reduction in
  gluconeogenesis shifting substrates toward DNL; and/or (3) regulating, yet to be
  determined, endpoints that alter glycolysis-driven DNL. Green lines (ending >) depict
  positive actions, and red lines (ending |) depict negative actions. Dotted lines
  (…) indicate reduced signaling due to impaired receptor signaling, while dashed
  lines (---) indicate reduced pathway activation due to a reduction in ligand.'
