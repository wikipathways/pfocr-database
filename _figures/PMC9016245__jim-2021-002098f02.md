caption: Mitochondrion and eosinophil apoptosis. Cell apoptosis is executed via the
  extrinsic (ie, receptor-mediated) and intrinsic (ie, mitochondrion-centered) pathways.
  The extrinsic pathway is activated by the ligation of the Fas/CD95, which leads
  to the formation of DISC protein and that regulates the activation of the initiator
  Caspase-8, as well as effector caspases, that to either execute apoptosis or activate
  the mitochondrial loop. In the intrinsic pathway, changes in the mPT changing forces
  mitochondria to release pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome C to the cytosol.
  Cytochrome C leads to apoptosome formation, which activates the initiator Caspase-9
  and also caspases 3, 6, and 7, that stimulate apoptosis. Eosinophils, as important
  cells in asthma exacerbations and airway remodeling, can be activated and migrated
  directed by IL-5. This cytokine prevents cytochrome C release and apoptosis in eosinophil
  apoptosis. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with asthma severity.
