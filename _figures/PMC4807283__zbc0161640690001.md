caption: CerS are central enzymes in the sphingolipid metabolism pathway. A, schematic
  representation of sphingolipid synthesis with CerS enzymes at a central point, mediating
  N-acyl chain specificity. Sptlc, serine palmitoyltransferase; Kdsr, 3-ketodihydrosphingosine
  reductase; Degs, sphingolipid δ(4)-desaturase. B, N-acyl chain specificity of mammalian
  CerS enzymes adapted from Refs. .
