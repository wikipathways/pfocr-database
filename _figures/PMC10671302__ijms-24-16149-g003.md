caption: 'Inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway by small-molecule inhibitors:
  In AD progression, CHI3L1 is primarily secreted by microglia and astrocytes. Small
  molecule inhibitors reduce the expression of genes such as iNOS, and COX-2 by inhibiting
  the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, slowing down the deposition of amyloid
  plaques, and improving disease progression'
