caption: TGF-β stimulates Smad2 and Smad3, thereby activating Foxp3 and promoting
  Treg cell differentiation. TGF-β and IL-6 together stimulate JAK kinases and transcription
  factors STAT3 and STAT5, subsequently activating RORγt and Th17 cell generation.
  MST1/2 enhances the stability of Foxp3 and promotes Treg cell generation through
  LATS1/2, NDR1/2, and YAP. In contrast, TAZ inhibits foxp3 and attenuates Treg cell
  generation but promotes the process of Th17 cell generation. In addition, TEAD1
  may hinder Th17 cell formation. Arrows and blunt ends indicate activation and repression,
  respectively.
