caption: Schematic representation of the effects of glucose on vago-vagal reflex control
  of the stomach. Glucose within the intestine induces the release of serotonin from
  enteroendocrine (EC) cells (Zhu et al., ; Freeman et al., ). The released 5-HT acts
  upon 5-HT3 receptors present on the peripheral terminals of vagal afferent neurons
  to cause their excitation (Hillsley et al., ; Raybould et al., ; Grundy, ); this
  peripheral signal is relayed centrally via the afferent vagus nerve. Once absorbed
  into the circulation, glucose is also able to act directly upon vagal afferent neurons
  within the nodose ganglion. Glucose induces neuronal excitation via actions upon
  ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP channels; Grabauskas et al., ) as well as
  causing neuronal inhibition via an as yet unidentified mechanism (Grabauskas et
  al., ). Glucose also rapidly and reversibly traffics 5-HT3 receptors to and from
  the membrane of gastrointestinal vagal afferent neurons (Babic et al., ). Since
  circulating platelet-free 5-HT levels increase following ingestion of a meal (Houghton
  et al., ), this provides a means by which glucose is able to modulate its own “perception”
  and amplify or prolong vagal afferent signaling. The central terminals of vagal
  afferent neurons enter the brainstem via the tractus solitarius and terminate on
  NTS neurons using predominantly glutamate as a neurotransmitter (Andresen and Yang,
  ; Andresen and Kunze, ). Glucose is also able to modulate the release of glutamate
  from the central terminals of vagal afferents by actions that involve 5-HT3 receptors
  (Wan and Browning, ,). Glucose can also activate NTS neurons via actions on KATP
  channels and increase synaptic transmission to gastric-projecting DMV neurons (Adachi
  et al., , ; Ferreira et al., ). Glucose can also modulate the activity of DMV neurons
  directly (Trapp et al., ; Karschin et al., ; Balfour et al., ; Balfour and Trapp,
  ). The result of these central and peripheral actions of glucose is gastric relaxation
  and delayed gastric emptying (Schvarcz et al., ; Raymer et al., ; Rayner et al.,
  ). The vagal efferent pathway involved in this gastric relaxation and delayed gastric
  emptying is still controversial. Peripheral actions of glucose appear to involve
  activation of a non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic pathway (Zhou et al., ) whereas
  central glucose appears to involve inhibition of the tonically active cholinergic
  pathway (Ferreira et al., ; Shi et al., , ).
