caption: Genes Involved in the Calvin Cycle and Photorespiration.(A) Schematic of
  the Calvin cycle and photorespiration pathway in C. reinhardtii (). Yellow boxes
  indicate genes involved in each reaction, and the red numbers in parentheses indicate
  the cluster in which each gene was found.(B) Summary of detailed information about
  each gene. C, cluster number (a “-” indicates the gene was not identified as DE
  in overall test and not assigned a cluster); S.E., significant effects, which are
  individual effects having a q-value <0.025 by the C/S impact test, where C is CO2
  effect, S is strain effect, CS is CO2 and strain interaction effect, and “-” indicates
  the gene was not identified as DE in overall test so was not included in C/S impact
  test.
