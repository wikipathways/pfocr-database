caption: 'Nucleotide biosynthesis requires input of carbons from tetrahydrofolate
  (THF), glycine, and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). PRPP is generated from
  glucose-derived carbons in the pentose phosphate pathway. Folate-derived THF can
  be metabolized in the cytosol or in mitochondria by the indicated enzymes. THF is
  converted to mTHF (methylene-tetrahydrofolate) in a cycle that is coupled to the
  conversion of serine to glycine. Serine, a major one-carbon donor for the synthesis
  of mTHF, can be imported from the extracellular milieu, synthesized from glycine,
  or from glucose-derived carbons. Glycine can be generated from serine or from threonine.
  In addition to nucleotide biosynthesis, one-carbon metabolism involving mTHF supports
  methionine and SAM production.Abbreviations: SHMT1 – Serine hydroxymethyltransferase
