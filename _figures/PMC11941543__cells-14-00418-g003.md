caption: 'Schematic illustration of RSV interaction with autophagy. The RSV NS1 protein
  inhibits the mTOR-S6KP70 signaling pathway that triggers autophagosome accumulation.
  The NS2 protein stabilizes Beclin1 via ISGylation. This interaction causes the successful
  induction of autophagosome accumulation. RSV may cause cholesterol accumulation
  in lysosomes and weaken VAP-A and ORP1L binding which enables autophagosome accumulation.
  AMPK activation during RSV infection induces autophagy by inhibiting the mTOR pathway
  and activation of autophagosome degradation. The LDLR knock out inhibits RSV infection
  by mediating lysosomal cholesterol metabolism and autophagy. The production of inflammatory
  cytokines and the activation of apoptosis are inhibited by the enhanced process
  of autophagy. This figure was created with BioRender.com. Licensing Right: KV27RKQMGG'
