caption: Model portraying how mitotic kinases connect to control epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis in breast cancer. Dysregulation of mitotic
  kinases activates a series of events that ultimately lead to EMT and metastasis
  allowing them to become potential oncogenes. Aurora A directly triggers EMT by activating
  the transcription factors Twist and Slug. Aurora A correlates with Wnt/β-catenin
  and PI3K/Akt signaling and was found to lead to EMT progression. Other studies have
  found that Aurora A regulated EMT is mediated by MAPK phosphorylation. Similarly,
  inhibition of Aurora A leads to the suppression of EMT through the downregulation
  of the MAPK pathway. Targeting Aurora B inhibits the OCT/AKT/GSK3β/Snail1 signaling,
  reverses EMT, and suppresses cancer progression, while both Aurora B and Nek2 regulate
  Hec1 for the maintenance of mitotic function and cell survival. Phosphorylation
  of Hec1 by Nek2 is essential for its mitotic function. Nek2 may signal EMT through
  Hec1 or independently of Hec1. Bub1 controls TGF-β which induces EMT. Inhibitors
  in clinical trials are shown in red. (A color version of this figure is available
  in the online journal.)
