caption: 'The three RCDs that do not rely on caspase. Ferroptosis is caused by the
  accumulation of iron, which is activated by the disruption of the balance between
  ROS and the antioxidant system. ACSL4, LPCAT3, ALOX15, and other genes mediate fatty
  acid oxidation, resulting in lipid toxicity in cells. Antioxidant systems such as
  Xc-, GPX4, and NFE2L2 protect cells from ROS. Ferroptosis is mainly dependent on
  the formation of PUFA-OOH. In system Xc-, GPX4 participates in the reduction of
  lipid peroxides (such as PUFA-OOH) and inhibits ferroptosis. In the lipid metabolism
  pathway, lipid droplets decompose to PUFA and AA/AdA. The latter is processed by
  ACSL4-LPCAT3-ALOX15 to form PUFA-OOH.NETosis: ROS mediated by NADPH activates histone
  citrullination, leading to the release of NET (chromatin in the nucleus), which
  blocks invading substances such as pathogens.Parthanatos: Oxidative stress leads
  to DNA damage. Activated PARP1 binds to AIFM1, causing the latter to migrate to
  the nucleus, leading to the dissolution of part of the chromosome.'
