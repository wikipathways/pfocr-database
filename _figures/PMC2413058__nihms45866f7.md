caption: Upon activation of the EGFR, ubiquitination by Cbl induces EGFR internalization
  through clathrin-coated vesicles. These vesicles fuse with early endosomes and the
  EGFR is passed from the Hrs complex to the ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III complexes
  as the endosomes are transformed into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). ESCRT-III promotes
  EGFR deubiquitination and entry into the internal vesicles of MVBs; fusion of MVBs
  with lysosomes results in EGFR degradation. Sprouty prevents the EGFR from progressing
  into late endosomes. We propose that Mop is required for EGFR progression through
  the endocytic pathway, perhaps through its effect on Hrs. This progression may allow
  the EGFR to encounter critical downstream components located on late endosomes (X),
  or to be recycled to the plasma membrane to prolong signaling. Cleavage of the receptor
  must occur at a stage after the requirement for mop.
