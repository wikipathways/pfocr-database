caption: 'Proposed aliphatic  pathway regulatory model. A, Aliphatic  biosynthetic
  pathway with structures and enzymes. Enzymes in black are ones with promoters included
  in this study. Those in gray were not cloned. The use of n indicates the number
  of carbons introduced to the side chain from the elongation cycle and can vary from
  1 to 7. The promoters are color coded based on their pathway membership as follows:
  indolic s are pink, aliphatic regulatory genes are purple, and aliphatic peripheral
  genes are red. The aliphatic biosynthetic genes are parsed into the core pathway
  (green), elongation (blue), modifying (yellow), and seed specific (orange) to visualize
  regulation along the linear model of the pathway. B, A proposed model of aliphatic  pathway
  regulation. In this model, the pathway is regulated by the JA pathway via the bHLH’s
  MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 interacting with the MYB28/MYB29/MYB76 proteins and binding the respective
  promoters. C, Transcriptional analysis of the aliphatic  pathway in mutants missing
  the MYB28 and MYB29 s (blue) or MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 s (red). The value is shown as the

  gene. The genes are ordered by their position in the biosynthetic pathway. The transcriptional
