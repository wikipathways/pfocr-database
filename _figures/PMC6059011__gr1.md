caption: EV Biogenesis and Interaction With Recipient CellsExosome formation starts
  with endocytosis, a process in which the cell membrane is pinched inward and captures
  bioactive molecules, resulting in the formation of the endosome. These molecules
  are sorted into smaller vesicles that bud from the perimeter membrane into the endosome
  lumen, forming vesicles; this leads to the multivesicular appearance of late endosomes
  and so they are also known as MVBs. From MSBs, exosome formation occurs by an ESCRT-
  and ceramide-dependent pathway. Cargo sorting into exosomes involves ESCRT and TSG101,
  ALIX, and Rab7a, and Rab27b. Exosomes are released into the extracellular space
  following the fusion of MVBs with the cell membrane, which is regulated by Rab27A,
  Rab11, and Rab31. Microvesicles are formed by the outward budding of the cell membrane,
  a process that is regulated by ARF6. Several routes of interaction between EVs and
  recipient cells have been described. First, EVs can directly activate target cell
  surface receptors. Second, EVs are able to transfer their biological content by
  membrane fusion with the recipient cell. Third, incorporation of EVs into target
  cells is mediated by endocytosis, pinocytosis, or phagocytosis. Using these interaction
  routes, EVs transfer their biological content containing nucleic acids such as mRNA,
  noncoding RNAs (microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs), proteins, cytokines, or bioactive
  lipids. mRNA = messenger RNA; MVB = multivesicular bodies.
