caption: Brief overview of the Notch pathway with indication of sites for targeted
  control of the Notch signaling pathway. Notch receptors have an extracellular domain
  comprised of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and three Lin-12 Notch repeats
  (LNR). Ligand binding triggers sequential receptor cleavages involving ADAM family
  metalloproteases and the γ-secretase complex, ultimately leading to the cytoplasmic
  release of the intracellular domain (NICD). This comprises a RAM domain, six ankyrin
  repeats between two nuclear localization sequences (NLS) and a transactivation domain.
  A PEST sequence is also present at the C-terminus of all four Notch receptors, with
  a transactivation domain present in Notch1 and 2. After cytoplasmic release, the
  NICD translocates (solid purple arrows) into the nucleus where it exerts its transcriptional
  activity to regulate target genes, such as ACTA2. Both Delta-like and Jagged ligands
  contain Delta-serrate-Lag2 (DSL) domains followed by a variable number of EGF-like
  repeats (8 for Delta-like1 and 4, and 6 for Delta-like3). An additional cysteine-rich
  domain is present in Jagged ligands, which also have 18 EGF-like repeats. The sites
  currently targeted for control of the Notch signal pathway in fibrosis are indicated
  in red.
