caption: Model of the cellular response to cadmium stress. Cadmium blocks Met4 ubiquitination,
  which leads to Met4 activation. Active Met4 induces glutathione synthesis, biosynthesis
  of sulfur amino acids, and a cell cycle arrest. Cadmium also activates the cell
  cycle checkpoint kinase Rad53 as well as a so far unidentified cell cycle arrest
  pathway.
