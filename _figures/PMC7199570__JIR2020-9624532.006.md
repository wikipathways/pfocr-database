caption: Diagrammatic presentation to express the combined effect of 1-methyl-D-tryptophan
  and oxaliplatin on immune response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. A vehicle
  was prepared for the codelivery of two chemotherapeutics, i.e., 1-methyl-D-tryptophan
  and oxaliplatin. 1-Methyl-D-tryptophan plays a role in causing immunogenic cell
  death via expression of calreticulin and release of ATP and HMGB-1 (high-mobility
  group box 1), while the interference of oxaliplatin with the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
  1 pathway is reported. After receiving adjuvant stimuli and uptaking the dying tumor
  cells, dendrite cells undergo a maturation process along with crosspresentation
  of tumor antigens. Afterward, primary and metastasized cancer cells are killed by
  CD+ T cells through granulysin and perforin. This codelivery system influences the
  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 pathway, interferes Treg development, and controls
  other immunomodulatory activities, resulting in the strengthening of the apoptotic
  effect by the immune system. The immunogenic cell death pathway involves the activation
  memory T cells and helper cells which helps in the prevention of disease recurrence.
