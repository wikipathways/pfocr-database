caption: The major signaling pathway sought in the present work is IRE1α signaling
  cascade, which is responsible for HIV-1 gp120-mediated ER stress. The increase in
  BiP and CHOP levels suggest increased ER stress. This activates IRE1α pathway, which
  further increases splicing of XBP-1 and activation of JNK. The post-translational
  activation of JNK further activates AP-1, which functions as a transcription factor
  to increase the expressions of CHOP. The increase in ER stress in this manner then
  activates the intrinsic caspase cascade via caspase-3 and caspase-9 cleavage. Together,
  these cascades ultimately lead to cell death in astrocytes.
