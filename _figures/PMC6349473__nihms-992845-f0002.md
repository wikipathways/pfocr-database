caption: Factors contributing to variation in developmental processes include A) gene-gene
  interactions, B) gene-environment interactions, and C) developmental stochasticity.
  A) Gene-gene interactions are modeled by BMP signaling in osteogenesis. Proteins
  in red are negative regulators of the pathway; proteins in green are positive regulators.
  Heterozygous mutations in SMAD6, a negative regulator of the BMP pathway, may be
  buffered if they occur in isolation. However, if they occur in a “risk allele” background
  in which BMP levels are increased or a second negative regulator (e.g., TCF12) is
  decreased, disease phenotypes are observed. Image modeled after . B) Gene-environment
  interactions are modeled by ethanol (EtOH) influences on SHH signaling. EtOH may
  exacerbate mutations in CDO, a SHH co-receptor, by negatively interacting with SHH
  binding to its receptors. Image modeled after Kahn et al. 2016. C) Developmental
  stochasticity is modeled by Satb2-mediated variation in jaw size. Satb2 protein
  levels have a non-linear relationship with jaw size, where wild-type and homozygous
  mutant individuals exhibit little population variance in size (grey shaded rectangles).
  However, heterozygous mutants are highly variable in size, encompassing the range
  of variation between wild-type and mutant (purple shaded rectangles). This continuous
  morphological variation (upper panel) can be explained by discrete cellular variation
  (lower panel). Satb2+/− cells are predicted to generate Satb2 protein levels that
  are at or near the threshold for Satb2 activation. Those cells that meet or surpass
  the threshold will proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts; those cells that
  fall below the threshold will undergo apoptosis. Thus, random variation in the degree
  of heterogeneity in cell fate between individuals can explain variation in jaw size.
  Dotted lines indicate threshold for protein activity.
