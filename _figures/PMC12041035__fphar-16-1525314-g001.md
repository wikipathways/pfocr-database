caption: Biogenesis, secretion, and structure of exosomes. Extracellular components
  can enter the cell via intracellular endocytosis. The biogenesis of exosomes begins
  with the formation of early endosomes, which are formed by invagination of the cytoplasmic
  membrane. These early endosomes subsequently mature into late endosomes, which can
  evolve into MVBs through the accumulation of numerous intraluminal vesicles (ILVs).
  There are two recognized pathways for regulating MVBs, namely, endosomal sorting
  complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent and ESCRT-independent mechanisms.
  Mature MVBs may either fuse with lysosomes for degradation or are transported to
  the cell membrane to merge with the plasma membrane, thereby releasing their luminal
  vesicles as exosomes into the extracellular space. Exosomes are mainly enriched
  with a variety of biologically active substances, including lipids, proteins (e.g.,
  major histocompatibility complex (MHC), integrins, tetra-transmembrane proteins,
  and heat shock proteins), and nucleic acids (DNA, mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA)
