  description: The activity of key enzymes in the floral scent biosynthetic pathway.
    In the floral scent biosynthetic pathway, the red rectangles indicate the metabolites
    that were detected in intracellular pools, and the gray arrow indicates a proposed
    step that has not previously been described. The black-and-white graphs show the
    key enzyme activity levels in the different varieties. The data are presented
    as the mean values of three biological replicates ± SDs. Different letters indicate
    significant differences at the P = 0.05 level.
