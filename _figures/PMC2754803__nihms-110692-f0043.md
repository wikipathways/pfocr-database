caption: As discussed so far in this section, the Au-induced rearrangement of propargyl
  acetates provides access to a diverse array of reaction pathways. An alternate pathway
  to the [3,3]- and [2,3]-migrations discussed so far was exploited by Zhang for the
  synthesis 1,4-cyclohexadienes by cycloisomerization of 3-acetoxy-1,5-enynes ().
  The reaction of 217 to 220 is initiated by 6-exo-dig cyclization of the ester onto
  the alkyne to produce intermediate 218, rather than the typical 6-endo-dig addition.
  This is one of few examples where a vinyl Au intermediate (219) is proposed to react
  as a nucleophilic carbanion. Dichloro(pyridine-2-carboxylato)Au optimally catalyzed
  the reaction, which did not proceed in the presence of cationic Au(I) complexes.
