caption: The proposed biosynthesis pathway of flavonoid in the C4H-silenced cells
  of Nicotiana tabacum. The dotted arrows show the potential diversion of metabolic
  flux. Alphabet in red indicates reduced expression, whereas alphabet in green indicates
  enhanced gene expression. PAL, phenylalanine ligase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; UGCT,
  UDP-glucose:cinnamate glucosyltransferase; HCGQT, hydroxycinnamoyl glucose:quinate
  hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; CC4H, cinnamoyl-CoA 4-hydroxylase. The enzymes for
  4-hydroxylation of cinnamoyl-CoA have not been demonstrated yet. Hence, CC4H is
  indicated in brackets showing their potential role.
