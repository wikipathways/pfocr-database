caption: Proposed model for the action of both profilin isoforms in different neuronal
  compartments. Interactions of PFN1, PFN2a, and p75NTR shape dendritic and spine
  morphology during processes of synaptic plasticity. The three proteins react with
  different signaling pathways to regulate actin assembly. PFN1 preferentially binds
  to PIP2 (), PFN2a binds with the formin mDia2 (this study), and both interactions
  stimulate actin assembly, but the actin assembly is directed to different neuronal
  compartments (single arrows). In contrast, p75NTR negatively controls the ROCK pathway
  (, ), which modulates spine density and dendritic complexity. Both profilin isoforms
  and p75NTR communicate with each other (this study, double arrows), and can thus
  influence each of the pathways. For reasons of clarity, the known direct interactions
  between profilins and members of the ROCK signaling cascade (RhoA and ROCK) are
  not included in this scheme.
