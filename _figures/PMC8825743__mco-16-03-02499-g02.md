caption: Notch signaling and ist association with the pathogenesis, progression and
  chemotherapeutic targets in CCA. Notch receptors, such as Notch1, Notch2, Notch3
  and Notch4, activate the Notch signaling pathway and promote CCA formation via NICD.
  The upstream signals of Notch, such as mTOR, PI3KCA, AKT, YAP and SNAIL, can promote
  the effects of the Notch signaling pathway by increasing Notch receptor expression
  levels. A direct ligand of Notch2, such as JAG1, can also upregulate Notch2 expression
  and can be upregulated by YAP. Notch1 can be induced by MFAP5 and is found in EGFP+
  cells. Moreover, Notch1 can activate RAC1 to promote CCA formation, or induce NICD
  to increase cyclin E expression to promote CCA formation. Several interventions
  downregulate the expression of Notch receptors and suppress Notch signaling, including
  anti-LTβR, verteporfin, corilagin, XN, PDT, cinobufagin, PIK73, siRNA, shRNA/SMIs,
  DAPT, miRNA-34a and FLI-06. In addition, some modulators can inhibit certain Notch
  receptors but promote different Notch receptors, such as AEA, 2-AG, anti-Notch1
  antibody, anti-Notch2 antibody and anti-JAG1 antibody. Some pathways, including
  the Hippo pathway, decrease Notch receptor expression levels, while others, such
  as the Wnt pathway, can promote CCA formation. CCA, cholangiocarcinoma; NICD, Notch
  intracellular domain; YAP, Yes-associated protein; PI3KCA, PIK3-catalytic subunit
  alpha; MFAP5, microfibrillar-associated protein 5; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent
