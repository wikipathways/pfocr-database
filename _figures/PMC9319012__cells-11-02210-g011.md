caption: Graphical summary. Schematic of effects of RSV-induced oxidative stress on
  the formation of a RELAOGG1 complex that binds to nucleosome-free domains in the
  HBP regulatory regions. OGG1 activity is required for the RELA recruitment and association
  of the transcriptional elongation-competent form of phosphorylated RNA Pol II. HBP
  enzymes GFPT1/2, GNPNAT1, PGM3 and UAP1 catalyze the conversion of fructose-6 phosphate
  into UDP-GlcNAc, required for N-linked glycosylation of integrins and basal lamina
  proteins.
