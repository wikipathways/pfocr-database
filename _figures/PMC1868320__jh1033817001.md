caption: Photograph of Nissl-stained hippocampal region showing location and connections
  of subiculum (Sub). The subiculum receives direct innervation from layers II and
  III of the EC via the perforant pathway to the superficial portion of the molecular
  layer (ML) and the deep fusiform cellular layer (FL). Input from the EC (solid lines)
  is topographically organized with rostral and lateral portions primarily innervating
  the proximal subiculum (adjacent to hippocampal subfield CA1) and medial and caudal
  EC innervating the distal subiculum. The subiculum also receives strong innervation
  from CA1 (dashed lines) to the deeper molecular layer and pyramidal cell layer (PL).
  The subiculum originates the major output of the hippocampus sending projections
  (dotted lines) via the alveus-fimbria-fornix to subcortical limbic structures in
  the basal forebrain and diencephalon and to sensory-specific and mutimodal association
  cortices via direct connections and layer IV of the EC. (CA2, CA3, and CA4, ammonic
  subfields of the hippocampus; DG, dentate gyrus)
