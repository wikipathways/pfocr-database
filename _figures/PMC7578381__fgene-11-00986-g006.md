caption: Functionally grouped network visualization for epigenetically upregulated
  and downregulated genes. Each Node represents a pathway and the node size represents
  the particular term’s enrichment significance (P-value). Genes highlighted in blue
  are of epigenetically significant genes. Epigenetically upregulated genes were found
  to be over-represented in immune system pathways and osteoclast differentiation
  pathways indicating immune evasion and bone marrow invasion (A) potential of tumor
  derived oropharyngeal cancer cells. Enrichment of epigenetically silenced genes
  in the xenobiotic metabolism (B) pathway suggests reduced carcinogen tolerance in
  oropharyngeal cancer cells. Also epigenetic down regulation of keratinization (C)
  pathway related genes indicate escape from growth inhibition by cell to cell adhesion.
