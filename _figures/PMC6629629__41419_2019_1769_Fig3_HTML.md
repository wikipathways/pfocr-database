caption: HPV oncogenesis occurs mainly in the tonsillar crypt epithelium of the oropharynx.
  Upon HPV infection, viral DNA is either integrated or exists in the cells in episomes.
  Regardless, this allows for transcription of viral oncoproteins E5, E6 and E7. The
  main dysregulation attributed to carcinogenesis in HPV-positive cases stems from
  the inhibition of p53 by the E6 viral protein, and of Rb by E7. This leads to entry
  into the cell cycle via release of E2F, and inhibition of p53-mediated cell death.
  It also results in the accumulation of p16, which subsequently acts as a surrogate
  marker of HPV infection in HNSCC. Though previously considered a minor player, E5
  has also been shown to activate EGFR leading to further oncogenic potential. Amongst
  the signalling pathways shown to be activated in HPV-HNSCC, the PI3K pathway has
  been found to be significantly upregulated. This may in part be due to activation
  by ErbB family members, including both EGFR and Her3,,–
