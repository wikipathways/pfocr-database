caption: Cytoscape representation of co-expressed genes with alginate and mannitol
  metabolisms selected by Pearson correlation coefficient ≥ 0.6 or ≤ − 0.6. a Protein
  interaction network for alginate biosynthesis. Genes involved in alginate pathway
  (red), DNA and protein regulation pathways (green), energy-producing metabolisms
  (purple) and transcription factor (blue) were indicated. b Protein interaction network
  for mannitol metabolism. Genes involved in mannitol biosynthesis (red), mannitol
  degradation (yellow), light-responsive reactions (green), energy-producing metabolisms
  (purple), carbon fixation (brown) and transcription factor (blue) were indicated.
  Full names for all genes were listed in Abbreviations
