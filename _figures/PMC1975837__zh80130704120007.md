caption: Regulation of intracellular cAMP in platelets by thrombin. Thrombin restricts
  intracellular cAMP content by suppression of synthesis from ATP and acceleration
  of hydrolysis of cAMP to 5′AMP by PDE3A. After activation of PAR-1, thrombin inhibits
  adenylate cyclase either through PAR1-coupled Gi protein directly, through Gq protein
  directly, or through Gq protein-induced of ADP from dense granules via the PLCβ
  pathway. In the latter, secreted ADP binds to the outside surface P2Y12 receptor,
  which is coupled to Gi2 to inhibit adenylate cyclase. Furthermore, thrombin via
  PAR-1 links to Gq, stimulates PI3K and PDK1, which in turn phosphorylates Akt, which
  in turn phosphorylates PDE3A. Elevation of PDE3A lowers intracellular cAMP content.
