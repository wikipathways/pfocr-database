caption: Schematic representation of ABA dynamics (top) and the DOG1-PP2C module’s
  operation alongside ABA core signaling in dormant (bottom left), nondormant unstressed
  (bottom middle), and nondormant stressed seeds (bottom right) during imbibition.
  ABA levels decrease upon imbibition regardless of the seed’s stress or dormancy
  status. However, in dormant and stressed seeds, ABA is de novo synthesized at later
  imbibition stages to prevent sprouting after prolonged hydration. In dormant seeds
  imbibed under optimal conditions, DOG1 is active, inhibiting AFP activation by AHG1
  and maintaining maturation-imposed ABA responses, independent of the early ABA drop.
  In later stages, active seed maturation responses induce ABA de novo synthesis,
  which, alongside the priming of SnRK2III activation, sustain ABA responses post-imbibition
  and prevent germination. In nondormant seeds (e.g., after-ripened or dog1 mutants)
  imbibed under optimal conditions, DOG1 is inactive (dashed border; shaded), restoring
  AHG1 and AHG3 functions. AHG1 dephosphorylates AFP1 and AFP2, switching off ABA
  responses from maturation and leading to AFP disposal in the absence of stress during
  early imbibition. This disruption of ABA responses, combined with insufficient ABA
  de novo synthesis in a stress-free environment, promotes germination and growth.
  In nondormant seeds imbibed under stress, DOG1 remains inactive, activating AFP
  and destabilizing ABA responses from maturation. While SnRK2III activation remains
  primed (in dog1 mutants, the activating phosphorylation mark is preserved), high
  ABA levels from stress-induced de novo synthesis at later imbibition stages prevent
  PP2CA-mediated SnRKIII repression, rapidly reactivating kinases and triggering ABA
  responses that halt germination. The question mark indicates unknown, AFP-independent
  AHG3 functions in germination control. Molecular events during early or late imbibition
  are shown as brown or blue connectors, respectively, with the DOG1-PP2C module (brown)
  and ABA core signaling pathway (blue) boxed
