caption: Ca2+ channels in the ER involved in regulating phosphorylation of tau, production
  of Aβ, which deposited in APs and NFTs, leading to impair learning ability via influencing
  synaptic plasticity. The accumulation of Aβ in the neuronal cells induces the Ca2+
  influx from the intracellular Ca2+ store, ER. In addition, Ca2+ depletion from ER
  triggers a sustained extracellular Ca2+ influx to the cytosol via a SOCE pathway,
  including TRPC1 and Orai1 by activating the STIM. During these processes, InsP3R
  and RyR2 played important roles in inducing Ca2+ influx from ER to cytosol, which
  results in regulating synaptic plasticity, phosphorylation of tau, deposition of
  Aβ, leading to cognitive impairment.
