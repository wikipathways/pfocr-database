caption: Overview of cholesterol structure, synthesis, and metabolism. (A) Schematic
  representation of the chemical structure of cholesterol, highlighting its characteristic
  sterol backbone and functional groups. (B) Diagram of the cholesterol biosynthetic
  pathway, detailing key enzymatic steps and intermediates involved in its synthesis.
  (C) Illustration of the absorption and systemic transport of dietary cholesterol,
  emphasizing the roles of intestinal uptake, incorporation into lipoproteins, and
  distribution throughout the body
