caption: Ethanol metabolism. Ethanol, an alcohol found in nature and alcoholic drinks,
  is metabolized through a complex catabolic metabolic pathway. In humans, in the
  presence of enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and NAD+, ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde,
  which is further converted to acetate and acetyl-CoA in the presence of acetaldehyde
  dehydrogenase and NAD+. Once acetyl-CoA is formed, it becomes a substrate for the
  citric acid cycle, ultimately producing cellular energy and releasing water and
  carbon dioxide (not shown). The liver is the major organ that metabolizes ethanol.
  Disulfiram and calcium carbamide can inhibit ALDH2 activity. Excess acetaldehyde
  can cause hangover.
