caption: Summary of the neuroprotective action of resveratrol. Resveratrol displays
  potent antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals and metals, protecting against
  NO toxicity, reducing QR2 activity and upregulating endogenous enzymes such as glutathione
  peroxidase, AMPK and LKB1. Resveratrol also inhibits pro-inflammatory enzyme (i.e.,
  COX-1 and -2) expression, reduces NF-κB activation as well as PGE2, NO, and TNF-α
  production, and cytokine release. It may promote Aβ clearance. Treatment with resveratrol
  can affect multiple signaling pathway effectors involved in cell survival (AMPK,
  PI3-k and AkT), programmed cell death (caspase-3/12, Bax, and cytochrome c) and
  synaptic plasticity (ERK1/2). Direct and/or indirect activation of the deacetylase
  sirtuins by resveratrol has also been suggested.AMPK – AMP-activated protein kinase,
  COX – cyclooxygenase, ERK – extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2),
  LKB1 – liver kinase B1, NF-κB – nuclear factor κB, NO – nitric oxide, PGE2 – prostaglandin
  E2, PI3-k – phosphoinositide 3-kinase, QR2 – quinone reductase 2. Reproduced with
