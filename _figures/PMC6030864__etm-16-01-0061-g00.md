caption: Pathway relationship network. The nodes represent pathways enriched by special
  DEGs, and the arrows represent regulatory relationship. The size of nodes was determined
  by degree. The red nodes represent pathways with upregulated genes, while the yellow
  nodes represent pathways with both upregulated and downregulated genes.
