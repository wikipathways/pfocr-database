caption: Smad complexes can cooperate with transcription pathways in the control of
  gene expression in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt and
  Hippo signaling pathways direct transcriptional activation or repression of target
  genes by their respective effectors. TGF-β/BMP-activated Smad complexes control
  target gene transcription in cooperation with an extensive array of DNA binding
  transcription factors and coactivators and corepressors. This versatility enables
  the Smad complexes to associate and functionally cooperate with transcription effectors
  of Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt and Hippo signaling, and, thus, to coordinately control
  gene reprogramming in EMT. The genes encoding EMT transcription factors are known
  to be directly activated by TGF-β-activated Smad complexes and may represent examples
  of such coordinate control. In addition to the pathways shown and discussed, Smads
  can also coordinately control gene expression with IκB/NFκB, STAT transcription
  factors and an array of other transcription factors that are respond to signaling
  pathways.
