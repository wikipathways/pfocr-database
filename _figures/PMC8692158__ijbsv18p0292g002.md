caption: 'The crosstalk of FGL1 in metabolic diseases. Elevated FGL1 in the liver
  promotes DNA synthesis, inhibits ROS production, and causes insulin resistance,
  steatosis and inflammation. Excess FGL1 causes obesity-related insulin resistance
  in skeletal muscle through the EGFR/JNK-mediated pathway, and adipogenesis through
  an ERK1/2-c/EBPβ-dependent pathway in the adipose tissue. HFD: high-fat diet; PA:
  palmitic acid; IL-6: interleukin 6; STZ: streptozotocin; PHx: partial hepatectomy;

  protein β; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated
