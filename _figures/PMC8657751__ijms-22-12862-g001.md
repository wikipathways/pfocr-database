caption: Overview of the synthesis and regulation of DA. There is evidence that DA
  is synthesized from tyrosine (Tyr) by a channeling mechanism with the enzymes TH,
  DDC, and the transporter VMAT2, forming a complex at the vesicular membrane [,,].
  The complex, whose details are presently not known, possibly minimizes the oxidations
  of DA and DOPA by MAO and reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively []. It should
  however be noted that our analysis does not rely on the existence of such a protein
  complex. The synthesized DA is stored in synaptic vesicles for release. Significant
  leakage of transmitter molecules out from vesicles has been observed [,,,,], and
  we tentatively assume that leakage also occurs in vivo. Upon arrival of an action,
  potential vesicles are emptied, and DA is released into the synaptic cleft. There,
  DA diffuses to DA-responsive target sites (postsynaptic neurons) or taken up by
  DA transporters (DAT) at neighboring dopaminergic terminals or metabolizing glial
  cells [,,]. TH is inhibited both by DA [,] and its substrate Tyr [,]. There is also
  an inhibition of TH from extracellular DA via D2 autoreceptors that inhibits stimulatory
  cAMP/PKA phosphorylation of TH [,]. Tyrosinase (TYR) [,], converts DOPA to dopaquinone
  with the final formation of Neuromelanin []. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) forms hydrogen
  peroxide (a reactive oxygen species (ROS)) during the metabolization of DA. ROS
  are able to oxidize DOPA using a similar pathway as TYR, leading to neuromelanin
  (see [] and references therein).
