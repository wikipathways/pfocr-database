caption: 'Central metabolism. EMP pathway (a), TCA cycle (b), and ribulose monophosphate
  (RuMP) pathway (c) predicted from the draft genome of strain Hulk. Abbreviations:
  P, phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The annotated ORF number (top) and
  corresponding EC number (bottom, italicized) are shown in gray. Dashed gray arrows
  indicate reactions catalyzed by enzymes not annotated in the draft genome'
