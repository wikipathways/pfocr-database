caption: Cbl pathways. A. All Cbl proteins are recruited to activated RTKs where they
  mediate ubiquitination and downregulation of the RTKs. The ubiquitinated RTKs are
  degraded by the lysosome. Thus loss of the E3 function of Cbl results in sustained
  signaling by RTKs. B. Cbl proteins can serve as adaptor proteins which recruit signaling
  molecules such as PI3 Kinase to the activated RTK. The mutant proteins that have
  lost E3 function frequently retain the ability to activate PI3K by this mechanism
  and so function as oncogenes. C. Cbl-b is a negative regulator of the CD28 costimulatory
  pathway in T-Cells. CD28 is activated by B7 molecules on the surface of antigen
  presenting cells (APC). Cbl-b ubiquitinates the p85 subunit of PI3K, preventing
  its recruitment to the activated CD28. The loss of Cbl-b results in hyperactive
  immunity, including anti-tumor immunity. D. Cbl-b is a negative regulator of NK
  cell anti-tumor acitivity. Growth arrest specific-6 (Gas6) is an activating ligand
  for the TAM receptors. Cbl-b is activated downstream of the TAM RTKs and inhibits
  NK cell activation – presumably by ubiquitinating an unknown substrate (X) that
  is required for activation. Cbl-b also can ubiquitinate the TAM receptors. The loss
  of Cbl-b results in increased NK cell anti-tumor activity.
