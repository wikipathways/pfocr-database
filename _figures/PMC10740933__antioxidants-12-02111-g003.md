caption: '(Left) Initial biosynthetic pathway for the formation of a lipofuscin fluorophore
  A2E in photoreceptor outer segment (OS) and its structure as a component of lipofuscin
  (LF) in the RPE cell. All-trans-retinaldehyde (ATR) hydrolysed from opsin binds
  to a highly abundant outer segment phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE),
  forming N-retinylidene phosphatidylethanolamine (NRPE). The binding of another molecule
  of ATR to NRPE results in the A2PE. Upon lysosomal cleavage of A2PE by phospholipase
  D in the RPE, A2E is formed. R1 and R2 stand for various fatty acids. (Right) Other
  bisretinoids that can be formed in the OS and RPE: ATR dimer-PE (ATRdi-PE), A2-dihydropyridine-PE
  (A2-DHP-PE), lyso A2PE, A2-glycerophosphoethanolamine (A2-GPE), ATR dimer-E (ATRdi-E),
  A2-dihydropyridine-E (A2-DHP-E), A2E isomer (isoA2E), and ATR dimer (ATRdi). Modified
