caption: Schematic Representation of the Results From Initial Renal Injury to Cardiac
  Dysfunction, Including the Effects of Gal-3 InhibitionRenal injury induced transient
  renal dysfunction only in the IR model (increase in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen),
  as well as tubular cell response and macrophage activation, which led to an increase
  in Gal-3 expression. These features led to systemic inflammation by increasing levels
  of plasma cytokines (Il-1, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) and Gal-3, which induced cardiac
  endothelial activation as shown by increased in ICAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1,
  monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and connective tissue growth factor mRNA levels.
  Endothelial activation promoted monocyte infiltration in cardiac tissue; these monocytes
  differentiated into activated macrophages (increased CD68), thus expressing and
  secreting transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and Gal-3. TGF-β and Gal-3 may participate
  in the activation of fibroblasts leading to collagen type 1 and 3 synthesis and
  subsequent cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction. Treatment with MCP, Gal-3 deletion
  (Gal-3 KO mice), and WT mice grafted with Gal-3 KO BM, prevented the increase in
  plasma cytokines, Gal-3, cardiac Gal-3, fibroblast activation, and the increase
  in cardiac fibrosis, which therefore prevented cardiac dysfunction. Abbreviations
