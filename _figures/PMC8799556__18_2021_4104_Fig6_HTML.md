caption: 'ILKs activity through signaling pathways, its interactions on a cellular
  level and subcellular localization. For the details, please see the text. Asterisks
  indicate pathways that may be initiated at a focal adhesion (FA) site regardless
  of the direct or indirect way of ILKs docking to FA. For the sake of simplification,
  the impact of FA-dependent ILK’s action on downstream effectors has been displayed
  as one of those. Please note that there are numbers in the figure, which refer to
  the issues and questions posed in Fig. . To highlight pathways related exclusively
  to particular isoforms of Parvin, α-, β-, and γ-Parvins are symbolically indicated
  by spheres connected to the silhouette of Parvin or shown in parentheses. The shape
  of ILK was modeled after the one included in the excellent review on ILK written
  by Widmaier and colleagues []. It is crucial to mention that not all of the interactions
  shown here might be direct, especially when it comes to phosphorylated downstrean
  targets of ILK. As mentioned in the text, there might be a kinase/kinases which
  upon binding to ILK phosphorylate, e.g., Akt or GSK3β. Nevertheless, ILK’s action
  impacts all proteins and pathways presented in the graphic. BAX-Bcl-2-associated
  protein X; BAD-Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death; Bcl2-B-cell lymphoma 2; EVs-extracellular
  vesicles; GTP—Guanosine-5′-triphosphate; MRP1—multidrug resistance protein 1; NLS—nuclear
  localization signal; NO—nitric oxide; P-phosphorylated residues of ILK; TFs—transcription
  factors, U-ubiquitin. Color coding: ILK’s interactors—green, downstream targets—turquoise,
  transcription factors—grey; in the apoptotic pathway: pro-apoptotic proteins—red,
  anti-apoptotic proteins—yellow; some selected proteins have been highlighted in
  other colors'
