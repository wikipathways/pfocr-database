caption: Advances of the STAT3 signaling pathways involving breast cancer chemoresistance.
  Classical IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathways can induce chemoresistance in breast cancer, while
  miR-4532 may attenuate this effect by inhibiting HIC-1 and IL-6/STAT3 pathways.
  Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) binding to its receptor LIFR can increase the activation
  of STAT3. STAT3 and pSTAT3 levels are regulated by GRP78. Then, phosphorylated STAT3
  activates cellular molecules including FAO, CPT1B and MAPK/AKT to induce the chemoresistance
  of breast cancer. Oct-4 and c-Myc form a signaling loop to promote STAT3/NF-κB activation
  and chemoresistance in breast cancer. Additionally, miR-124 can inhibit HIF-1 and
  promote breast cancer chemoresistance
