caption: 'Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Left (inactivation of Wnt signalling): In the absence
  of Wnt signalling, β-catenin is degraded by protein complexes, including AXIN, APC,
  serine/threonine kinase GSK-3, and CK1 and E3 ubiquitin ligase β-trcp. Right (activation
  of Wnt signalling): Wnt signalling is activated by binding to its receptor, which
  induces the binding of AXIN to phosphorylated lipoprotein receptor-related protein
  (LRP). The destruction complex is broken, and then β-catenin stabilizes and binds
  to TCF in the nucleus to regulate the target gene. GSK-3 glycogen synthase kinase-3,
  AXIN axis inhibition protein, CK1 casein kinase 1, APC adenomatous polyposis coli,
  TCF T cell factor, LEF lymphocyte enhancer factor-1'
