caption: (A) Gene expression level varies depending on distance from the origin of
  replication, as well as other position-dependent factors. The expression level of
  a heterologous pathway gene affects the production phenotype of a strain. Increasing
  the expression level of a gene can improve production level by increasing flux through
  the pathway, but avoiding too high of an expression level can also provide benefits
  such as reducing the buildup of toxic intermediates and avoiding unnecessary metabolic
  burden. (B) Libraries with pathway genes integrated into various genome locations
  can be screened for production phenotype using syntrophic coculture amplification
  of production (SnoCAP) (). A cross-feeding coculture is configured consisting of
  a secretor strain producing a target molecule and a sensor strain that cannot synthesize
  the target molecule autonomously. The cocultures are compartmentalized in microfluidic
  droplets, incubated to allow cogrowth, and then sorted to identify the strains with
  high production phenotypes.
