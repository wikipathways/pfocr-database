caption: Post-Translational Regulation of β-Catenin Protein by Notch.Notch can negatively
  regulate active β-catenin levels in a non-canonical fashion. In the presence of
  Wnts, membrane-bound Notch forms a complex with active β-catenin and degrades active
  β-catenin through an endo-lysosomal pathway. The degradation is independent of GSK3β-dependent
  destruction complex. Whether Notch is recycled back to the membrane is unclear.
  NICD can also regulate active β-catenin levels in a similar mechanism, but it is
  unknown whether endogenously processed NICD regulates active β-catenin protein.
  Protein interactions can be either direct or indirect.
