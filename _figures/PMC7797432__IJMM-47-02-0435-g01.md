caption: SFRP-2 in the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in cancer. (A) Wnt binding
  to Frizzled/LRP5/6 induces Dvl3 accumulation, which inhibits the complex of β-catenin,
  Axin, APC and GSK-3β. This leads to an increase of cytoplasmic β-catenin, which
  then translocates to the nucleus to interact with TCF/LEF family of transcription
  factors that contribute to cell survival, proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation.
  SFRP-2 as a competitive receptor of Wnt may regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signalling
  pathway to inhibit cell proliferation and survival, and lead to apoptosis (,). (B)
  SFRP-2 derived from aged fibroblasts may inhibit β-catenin and MITF signalling,
  resulting in a decrease of AEP1 that makes melanoma cells more sensitive to oxidative
  stress and resistant to BRAF inhibitors (). The figure was prepared utilising templates
  obtained from www.proteinlounge.com. SFRP-2, secreted frizzled-related protein 2;
  LRP5/6, lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6; Dvl3, dishevelled 3; APC, adenomatosis
  polyposis coli; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor; MITF, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor; AEP1, apurinic/apyrimidinic
  endonuclease 1.
