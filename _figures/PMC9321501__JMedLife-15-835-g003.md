caption: A – The protein network is plotted for overexpressed genes by Tamoxifen and
  B – for genes with low expression by Tamoxifen. In this network, node degree and
  betweenness scores were evaluated, and BIRC5, PLK1, RAPGAP1, MYLK, SOCS3, and STAT5B
  proteins were selected for investigation in human breast cancer samples.
