caption: 'Metabolic pathway in plant polar glycerolipid biosynthesis, based on Ohlrogge
  and Browse (), Bates et al. (, ), and Benning (). The white area indicates lipid
  species that reach higher levels at the end of the light period than at the end
  of the dark period, and the blue area indicates lipids that are higher at the end
  of the dark period. The lower section of the diagram represents reactions that take
  place in the plant plastid and the upper section of the diagram represents reactions
  that take place outside the plastid (in the endoplasmic reticulum). PC hydrolysis
  by PLD is depicted on the upper right; among PLD gene products tested, PLDζ2 is
  most clearly implicated in formation of PA in the dark. No attempt is made to suggest
  specific details as to location within the plastidic or extraplastidic (endoplasmic
  reticulum) sites. Details are discussed in the text. Abbreviations not defined elsewhere
  include: ACP for acyl carrier protein, CoA for Coenzyme A, DAG for diacylglycerol,
  and G3P for glycerol-3-phosphate.'
