caption: Mycolic acid condensation reaction involves meromycolic acid activation by
  FadD32. The biosynthetic pathway of mycolic acid implicates the de novo synthesis
  and elongation of fatty acids operated by the mycobacterial fatty-acid synthases
  FAS-I and FAS-II, respectively. The FAS-II synthase products undergo further elongations,
  desaturations, and modifications differentiated by a family of methyltransferases
  to yield the very long-chain meromycolic chains. The meromycolic acid is activated
  into meromycoloyl-AMP by FadD32 and condensed with carboxylated acyl-CoA activated
  by the acyl-CoA carboxylase ACCase (AccA3–AccD4) to yield α-alkyl β-ketoester of
  trehalose that is reduced by CmrA to form the mature mycolic acid (trehalose monomycolate,
  TMM). R and R2 are long hydrocarbon chains.
