caption: Micronuclei can arise from a variety of mechanisms, including (but not limited
  to) factors that arise during mitosis (top of figure) (Guo et al., 2019). Due to
  nuclear envelope (NE) pores/gaps or rupture, micronuclei can be perceived as “cytoplasmic”
  DNA, triggering the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway, which in turn leads to the production
  of interferons. This “mark” targets the cells for senescence, the latter of which
  also contribute to inflammation (via SASP), thereby perpetuating the CIN-inflammation
  cycle. The micronuclei, either directly via genetic imbalance, or indirectly via
  inflammation and/or senescence, can contribute to alterations in gene expression.
  In turn, these alterations could contribute to the acquisition of age-related health
  conditions in people with Down syndrome or mosaic Down syndrome, but this conjectured
  relationship is not yet proven (as indicated by the?). SAC = Spindle Assembly Checkpoint;
  NE = Nuclear Envelope; ROS = reactive oxidative stress; SASP = Senescence Associated
  Secretory Phenotype.
