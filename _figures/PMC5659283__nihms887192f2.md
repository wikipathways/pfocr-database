caption: PTEN controls the G2-M transition to prevent bypass of the G2 checkpoints
  and premature entry into mitosis (M). In response to genotoxic stress, PTEN functions
  to activate the DNA damage checkpoint by suppressing PI3K/AKT-dependent CHK1 phosphorylation
  and maintaining its nuclear localization and stability. PTEN also promotes TOP2A-mediated
  DNA decatenation checkpoint by interacting with TOP2A and preventing its degradation.
  Moreover, PTEN can form a complex with cyclin B1 and CDK1, accumulation of which
  in the nucleus prevents cell cycle progression from G2 to M. The nuclear translocation
  of PTEN is mediated by its dephosphorylation following inhibition of Notch signaling.
  Phosphorylation of PTEN can be induced by the ATR-CHK1-CKII pathway in response
  to stalled DNA replication forks, or following depletion of CHFR, a checkpoint protein
  controlling entry to mitosis (shown with green background to indicate aberrant cell
  cycle regulation). PTEN phosphorylation represents an inactivation state that results
  in accelerated G2-M transition due to bypass of the DNA damage checkpoint or premature
  entry into mitosis, leading to genomic instability.
