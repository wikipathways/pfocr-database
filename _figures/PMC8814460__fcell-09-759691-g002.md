caption: The genetic and environmental conditions that trigger inflammatory signaling
  cascades, such cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), NF-κB and STAT3, to induce secretome production
  and influence tumor-associated myeloid cells within the TME. Genetic KRASG12D and
  TP53 mutation regulated CXCR2, CCR5 ligands secretion through NF-κB and STAT3 pathway
  to promote MDSCs accumulation and immunosuppression. Environmental collagen-DDR1
  regulated CXCL5 through NF-κB pathway to induced NETs formation. Hypoxia mediated
  HIF regulated CXCR2, CXCR4 and CCR5 ligands production, which induced MDSCs recruitment
  and Tregs generation. In additiob, HIF-regulated ROS and RNS as well as “don’t eat
  me “signals, which directly inhibited pro-inflammatory response. Hypoxia-mediated
  adenosine not only directly regulated M2 TAM and Tc cells by binding its receptor
  A2A/A2B, but also regulated cancer cells-mediated VEGF, LI-6, IL-10 and TGF-β secretion
  to promote DMSCs recruitment.
