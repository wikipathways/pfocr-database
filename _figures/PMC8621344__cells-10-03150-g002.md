caption: Cancer and the consequent inactivity impair the myogenic process, either
  directly via cytokine release or through several mechanisms including neuromuscular
  junction (NMJ) disruption, and mitochondrial and sarcolemmal damage. Several interventions
  have been proposed, mainly focused on signaling pathway inhibition, cytokine modulation,
  and exercise or exercise-mimicking metabolism modulators. Image created with BioRender.com
