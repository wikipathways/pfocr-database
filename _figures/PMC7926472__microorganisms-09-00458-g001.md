caption: (a) A general map of core metabolism. The arrows in the map do not cover
  every atom in every cofactor, amino acid, or base, showing main mass contributions
  instead. A dot indicates that radical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) enzymes are involved
  in the biosynthetic pathway leading to the product. [S] indicates that sulfur is
  incorporated in the biosynthetic pathway. (b) Cofactors indicated by a star are
  required in the pathway from H2 and CO2 to pyruvate in either acetogens or methanogens
  or both. (c) The composition of cells in terms of its main components and elemental
  contributions to dry weight (from []).
