caption: Pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and/or B4 LTB4 promote angiogenesis
  on at least two levels. First, PGE2 and/or LTB4 can directly act on epithelial,
  endothelial and/or immune cells to induce angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and the chemokines CXCL1
  and CCL2. In transformed epithelial cells, PGE2 induces VEGF and CXCL1 secretion
  through an EP2 or EP4–epidermal growth factor (EGFR)–Erk cascade. In endothelial
  cells, PGE2 induces VEGF and FGF2 secretion through a MAPK pathway and LTB4 also
  stimulates VEGF expression. Moreover, PGE2 not only binds to endothelial cells to
  stimulate cell migration through an αVβ3 integrin–CDC42 and Rac pathway, but also
  mediates VEGF-and FGF2-induced CXCR4-dependent neovessel assembly in vivo. In immune
  cells, PGE2 promotes mast cells to release VEGF and CCL2, and LTB4 stimulates VEGF
  expression. Secretion of VEGF and FGF2 from tumour epithelial, endothelial and immune
  cells promotes endothelial cell proliferation and survival, and the chemokine CXCL1
  released from tumour epithelial cells stimulates endothelial cell migration and
  tube formation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. CCL2 can attract endothelial cells
  to the tumour microenvironment. Interestingly, VEGF and FGF2 induce COX2 and subsequently
  PGE2 in endothelial cells, and CCL2 also induces COX2 and PGE2 in macrophages. Therefore,
  the effects of PGE2 on the regulation of VEGF, FGF2 and CCL2 are probably amplified
  through this positive feedback loop.
