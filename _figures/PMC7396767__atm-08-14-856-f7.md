caption: A schematic illustration of the crosstalk between CAFs and HCC cells. CAFs
  secrete HGF, which phosphorylates ERK1/2 at residues Thy202/Tyr204 in HCC cells
  through c-Met signaling. Following activation, phosphorylated ERK1/2 translocate
  to the nucleus, which regulates the expression of CD73 to promote the chemoresistance
  and tumorigenicity of HCC. CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast; HCC, hepatocellular
  carcinoma; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor.
