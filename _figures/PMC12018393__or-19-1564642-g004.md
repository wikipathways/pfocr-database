caption: 'Tamoxifen metabolic pathway. The major metabolites of tamoxifen: 4-hydroxy
  tamoxifen (afimoxifene), and 4-hydroxy, N-desmethyl tamoxifen (endoxifen), are shown,
  as well as the metabolite N-desmethyltamoxifen (NDM-tamoxifen). The primary active
  tamoxifen metabolite, endoxifen, is highlighted in blue and NDM-tamoxifen, the major
  circulating metabolite, is highlighted in red. The conversion of tamoxifen to NDM-tamoxifen
  constitutes approximately 92% of tamoxifen metabolism, whereas the pathway through
  4-OHT represents about 7%. The key cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved in bioconversion
  are highlighted alongside the other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. CYP3A4/5 catalyzes
  the N-demethylation of tamoxifen to produce NDM-tamoxifen, which is subsequently
  4-hydroxylated by CYP2D6 to generate endoxifen. Tamoxifen is converted to afimoxifene
  by enzymes such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 and is further metabolized into endoxifen primarily
  via CYP3A enzymes. Afimoxifene and endoxifen are converted into excretable forms
  via sulfotransferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (92, 93, 99, 100).
