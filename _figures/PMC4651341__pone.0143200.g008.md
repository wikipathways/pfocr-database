caption: 'Genes of the PCP are regulated by the transcriptional activators XlnR (blue
  lines) and AraR (pink lines). Some of the D-galactose oxido-reductive genes are
  under regulatory control of GalR (green lines) together with XlnR and AraR. The
  expression of the hexokinase gene (hxkA) is observed in the A. nidulans ΔΔΔ triple
  mutant strain, probably due to the fact that this enzyme is also a part of glycolysis
  and therefore constitutively expressed. Some of the enzymatic conversions of the
  D-galactose oxido-reductive and the PCP pathway are verified, whereas others still
  need to be verified (marked by a star). Regulation of genes represented by solid
  lines is confirmed by expression analysis; dotted lines indicate that this regulation
  still needs to be verified. Dashed lines represent direct or indirect induction
  of TFs by monomer. Ortholog of ladB: AN4336, ortholog of red1: AN7914, ortholog
  of sdhA: AN2666.'
