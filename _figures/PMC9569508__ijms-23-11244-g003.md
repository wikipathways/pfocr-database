caption: Drosophila target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway, a simplified schematic
  representation. The inactive and active states of the pathway are shown on the left
  and right, respectively. The anabolic kinase TOR functions in two distinct complexes,
  TORC1 and TORC2, and regulates cap-dependent translation as well as chromatin architecture
  and gene regulation. Through a number of intermediate steps, nutrients, particularly
  amino acids, and growth factors, such as insulin-like peptides, activate TORC1 (for
  additional details, see ). Akt, protein kinase B (PKB); Alc, Alicorn; AMPK, AMP-activated

  (for the references, see ).
