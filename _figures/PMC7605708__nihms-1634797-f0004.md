  (a) Biochemical pathway showing metabolic perturbations in plasma from subjects
  diagnosed with PBD-ZSD and under 10 years of age at the time of sample collection.
  Red circles indicate biochemicals with positive z-scores (>2) and blue circles indicate
  biochemicals with negative z-scores (< − 2). The diameters of the circles indicate
  the magnitude of the z-score. Pink circles represent biochemicals with z-score of
  1.5 ≤ z < 2.0 and light blue circles represent biochemicals with − 2.0 < z ≤ − 1.5.
  Black circles represent other biochemicals in the pathway detected in the samples
  but had z-scores of − 1.5 < z < 1.5. (b) Biochemical pathway showing metabolic perturbations
  in plasma from subjects diagnosed with PBD-ZSD and over 10 years of age at the time
  of sample collection. Red circles indicate biochemicals with positive z-scores (>2)
  and blue circles indicate biochemicals with negative z-scores (< − 2). The diameters
  of the circles indicate the magnitude of the z-score. Pink circles represent biochemicals
  with z-score of 1.5 ≤ z < 2.0 and light blue circles represent biochemicals with
  − 2.0 < z ≤ − 1.5. Black circles represent other biochemicals in the pathway detected
  in the samples but had z-scores of − 1.5 < z < 1.5.
