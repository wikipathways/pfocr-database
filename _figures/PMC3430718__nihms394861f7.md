caption: A. In AdV-infected macrophages STAT1 activation, IFNβ production and MxA
  mRNA levels were enhanced. In AdV-SOCS1-infected cells relative to AdV-GFP-infected
  cells there was reduced IRF1 mRNA, IFNβ mRNA, STAT1 phosphorylation and reduced
  MxA mRNA levels, highlighting the capacity of SOCS1 to control AdV-mediated signaling.
  B. TLR4 signals via an early MyD88-dependent and a late MyD88-independent, TRIF-dependent
  pathway. The rapid production of TNFα following receptor activation (+ LPS early)
  can be attributed to the amplification of signals through the NFκB pathway with
  NFκB transcriptional activity driving the expression of proinflammatory genes. The
  sustained production of TNFα, in response to TLR4 activation (+LPS late), reflects
  the co-operative actions of the MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways.
  Recruitment of the adaptors TRIF and TRAM initiate the dimerization and translocation
  of IRF3 which regulates the production of type I IFN. IFNβ binds to and activates
  its receptor, IFNAR leading to the activation and nuclear translocation of STAT1
  which may drive the expression of both IFN-inducible and pro-inflammatory genes.
  In addition, TRAF6 recruitment contributes to NFκB activation. Further, cross-talk
  between the IFN and NFκB pathways is proposed with both known and unknown targets
  of SOCS1 indicated.
