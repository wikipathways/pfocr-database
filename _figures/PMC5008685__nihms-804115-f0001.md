caption: PERK-dependent Unfolded Protein Response. Under normal physiological conditions,
  ER transmembrane receptor PERK is present in an inactive state, since it is associated
  with BiP chaperones. As a response to the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded
  proteins within ER lumen, under ER stress, BiP dissociates from the lumenal domain
  of PERK. This leads to oligomerization and trans-autophosphorylation of PERK, which
  becomes an active kinase with the ability to phosphorylate α subunits of the eIF2.
  The result is suppression of global protein translation, which causes the cell cycle
  to arrest in the G1 phase as well as the induction of preferential translation of
  ATF4, which upregulates expression of genes responsible for restoring cell homeostasis.
  Under prolonged ER stress, when pro-adaptive UPR fails, PERK may also trigger pro-apoptotic
  signals through activation of downstream CHOP, which promotes apoptosis.
