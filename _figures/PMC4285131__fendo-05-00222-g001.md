caption: Schematic representation of the difference in the mevalonate-based biosynthetic
  pathway in insects and nematodes (=Ecdysozoa) on one hand, and vertebrates on the
  other. The main difference is that Ecdysozoa cannot synthesize cholesterol on their
  own because they miss the key enzyme squalene synthase. Whether their common ancestor
  lost the coding gene or never had it remains a matter of discussion. Modified after
  De Loof et al. ().
