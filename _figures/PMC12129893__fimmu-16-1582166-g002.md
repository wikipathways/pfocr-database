caption: 'Overview of the sources of the microbiota and mechanisms by which bacteria
  regulate tumor progression. There are three potential sources of microbiota: microbiota
  originating from normal adjacent tissues, microbiota from mucosal organs through
  mucosal barriers, and microbiota which are the result of hematogenous spread. Microbiota
  influence tumorigenesis and treatment through DNA damage, activating the signaling
  pathway, influencing the anti-tumor immunity and metabolize drugs'
