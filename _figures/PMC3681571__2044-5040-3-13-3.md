caption: Non-immune mechanisms of muscle damage and weakness. MHC class I overexpression
  on myofibers make muscle susceptible for CD8 T-cell mediated cytotoxicity as well
  as susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell death. MHC class I accumulation
  in endoplasmic reticulum induces stress responses (unfolded protein response and
  endoplasmic reticulum overload response (EOR)) [,-]. Induction of EOR activates
  downstream NF-kB pathway leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine production and reduction
  in new muscle formation by inhibiting MyoD. It also induces cell death mechanisms
  via the activation of caspases 12, 3 and 7 as well as calpain pathways (Step A)
  []. Innate cytokines, mitochondrial energy-related metabolic pathways, and purine
  nucleotide pathways are interconnected in myositis muscle. For instance, IL-1 reduces
  the production of nitric oxide (NO) and causes mitochondrial dysfunction by affecting
  NADH reductase and succinate CoQ [-]. Likewise, unknown cytokines reduce expression
  of rate-limiting enzymes of the purine nucleotide cycle and of AMPD1 in skeletal
  muscle. This acquired deficiency of APMD1 causes muscle weakness and fatigue in
  myositis (Step B) []. Activation of TRAIL forms autophagosomes and induces autophagy
  (Step C) []. TLR signaling leads to inflammasome activation, IL-1 secretion and
  pyroapoptosis in the affected muscle. There are active interactions between autophagy,
  ER stress, and inflammasome and purine nucleotide pathways. Even though all these
  pathways are interconnected, we have represented them as linear pathways in this
  illustration for easier understanding. Thus, several non-immune and metabolic pathways
  directly and indirectly contribute to muscle weakness and damage in myositis.
