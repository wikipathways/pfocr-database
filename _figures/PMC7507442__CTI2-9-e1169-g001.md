caption: DNA damage and the programmed cell death pathway (apoptosis) induced by radiotherapy.
  Double‐ and single‐strand breaks induced by radiotherapy are sensed by Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1
  and Rad1/Rad9/Hus1 and Rad17/RFC complexes, respectively. Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 then
  recruits ataxia telangiectasia‐mutated protein (ATM), which phosphorylates checkpoint
  protein kinase 2 (CHK2). Rad1/Rad9/Hus1 and Rad17/RFC recruit ataxia telangiectasia
  and rad 3‐related (ATR), which phosphorylates checkpoint protein kinase 1 (CHK1).
  Activated CHK2 and CHK1 arrest cell cycle progression for DNA repair through homologous
  recombination (HR), nonhomologous end‐joining (NHEJ), poly (ADP‐ribose) polymerase
  (PARP) and γ‐H2AX. If DNA is repaired, cells will resume their normal cycles. However,
  if the damage is substantial, CHK2/CHK1 will phosphorylate P53 by dissociating P53
  from mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), leading to the accumulation of transcriptionally
  active P53. The P53 then triggers the expression of pro‐apoptotic genes, namely
  p53‐upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and BCL2‐associated X protein (BAX).
  PUMA disassembles complex P53 and anti‐apoptotic protein (BCL‐XL) in the cytoplasm.
  Liberated P53 disrupts pro‐apoptotic BAX and anti‐apoptotic BCL2 complex. Released
  BAX permeabilises mitochondrial outer membrane releasing cytochrome C, which binds
  to apoptotic protease‐activating factor (Apaf) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  to form apoptosome and activate caspase‐9 and finally effector caspase‐3 and caspase‐7
  inducing intrinsic apoptosis. Moreover, P53 also transactivates the death receptor
  (Fas/CD95) and death ligand (FasL/CD178). The interaction of Fas and FasL leads
  to trimerisation of CD95 and clustering of intracellular death domain (DD). DD then
  recruits FAS cell‐surface death receptor‐associated death domain (FADD). The FADD
  activates procaspase‐8 (PCASP‐8) forming death‐inducing signalling complex (DISC),
  which will further produce effector caspase‐3 and caspase‐7 cleaving DNA repair
  proteins such as PARP, structural protein, inducing membrane blebbing and DNA fragmentation
  leading to extrinsic cell death.
