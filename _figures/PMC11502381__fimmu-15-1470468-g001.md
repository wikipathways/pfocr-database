caption: Bidirectional immunomodulation using cGAS-STING. When cGAS binds to cytosolic
  DNA in tumor cells, it can form 2'3'-cGAMP, which translocates to the ER as a second
  messenger and activates the transmembrane receptor protein STING. The 2'3'-cGAMP
  can also be translocated from one cell to another via cellular gap junction proteins,
  thereby activating the STING cascade signaling in other cells. Activated STING interacts
  with TBK1 and promotes TBK1 phosphorylation, thereby phosphorylating STING. Phosphorylated
  STING activates IRF3, which translocates to the nucleus and activates IFN-I gene
  transcription, thereby promoting IFN-I secretion from tumor cells. However, IFN-I
  upregulated PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and reduced the immune response. Additionally,
  IFN-I induced Treg infiltration by upregulating IL-10 expression, leading to immune
  escape. Moreover, STING mediates NF-κB activation and promotes IL-6 secretion, thereby
  promoting tumor cell survival. DCs in the TME take up broken tumor DNA, initiating
  the cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathway and promoting MHC molecule expression. Subsequently,
  DCs can present tumor antigens to T cells and induce CD8+ T cell activation to exert
  anti-tumor effects
