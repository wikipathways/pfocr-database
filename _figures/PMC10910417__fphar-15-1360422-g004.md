  Maca possible mechanism of action based on recent evidence. (A)
  L. meyenii macamides can modulate HPA axis via serotoninergic pathway via CBs Receptors (Alasmari et al., 2019), but also (B) induce 5-HT production by microbiota and gut–brain axis modulation by maca (Hong et al., 2023) (C) Activation of 5-HT in the neurosecretory serotoninergic cells in the Raphe nuclei located in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus which in turn reduce the anterior pituitary gland releasing Antherocotropina (ACTH) and of (D) growth hormone, which in turn reduce expression and activity of Liver CYP450. (E) The reduction of ACTH consecuently modulate a reduction in cortisol production in the adrenal glands (Meissner et al., 2006b)
