caption: The proposed hypothesis explains the mechanism for the role of DOCK11 in
  HBV cccDNA formation and its modulation of histone modifications and RNA Pol II
  on HBV cccDNA. DOCK11 activates CDC42 to stimulate actin polymerization, thereby
  activating the ATR signaling pathway and facilitating cccDNA formation [25]. Additionally,
  DOCK11 triggers the CDC42-mediated pathway, regulating downstream molecules such
  as SET9 (a lysine methyltransferase), C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatases, and
  CTD kinase to modulate H3K4 methylation and phosphorylation status within the RNA
  Pol IIA CTD, ultimately maintaining cccDNA [26]
