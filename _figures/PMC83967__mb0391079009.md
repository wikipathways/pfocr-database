caption: Interplay between cell contacts, the cytoskeletal network, and the transcription
  factors c-Jun and GR. (A) Cell-to-cell contacts within the intact tissue, which
  are mediated by adhesion molecules (black boxes), render the growth factor receptors
  inactive and/or maintain the existence of a specific cytoskeletal architecture (gray
  ovals) which locks components of the c-Jun signaling pathway (X) in an inactive
  conformation. Under these conditions the level of c-Jun is low (downward arrowhead)
  and GR activity is high (upward arrowhead), capable of inducing the transcription
  of target genes. (B) Disruption of cell contacts or depolymerization of the cytoskeleton
  removes the restraint, thereby facilitating signal transduction. This results in
  an increase in c-Jun and repression of GR transcriptional activity.
