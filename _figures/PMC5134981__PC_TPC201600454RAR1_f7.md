caption: Model of the Central Role of STK in the Differentiation of Cell Wall of the
  Seed Coat Epidermal Cells.The transcription factor STK regulates a complex regulatory
  network involving pectin maturation and cellulose deposition, driving the strengthening
  of the cell wall in the seed coat. STK controls the methylesterification status
  of the cell wall in the seed coat by repressing  activity. STK represses genes involved
  in pectin maturation, including LUH/MUM1, MYB61, SBT1.7, and MUM2. As a transcription
  factor, LUH/MUM1 appears to antagonize STK function since each represses the other's
  activity. At the same time, STK directly promotes expression of the inhibitor PMEI6.
  This could explain the low PMEI6 transcript levels and higher  activity in stk seeds.
  This results in higher levels of demethylesterified , thereby exposing more negative
  charges that are involved in Ca2+ binding that might, directly or indirectly, strengthen
  the cell wall. The effects of induced stiffness in the seed coat might delay primary
  cell wall rupture with the described consequences for mucilage swelling. STK may
  play a parallel role in the positive regulatory control of cellulose biosynthesis
  in the mucilage ray via the FEI2-CESA5 pathway. STK directly controls CESA5 but
  does not induce changes in SOS5, CESA3, and COBL2 expression. STK negatively influences
  glucomannan deposition in the adherent mucilage by repressing CSLA2 regulation.
  STK controls cellulose deposition in the columellae and the radial cell wall promoting
  the expression of CESA5 and repressing CESA2. STK promotes cellulose deposition
  to fulfill the need for a structural link required for the assembly/organization
  of pectin in the seed coat epidermal cell wall. The formation of this matrix may
  require the pectin matrix to be organized around cellulose rays in the columellae.
