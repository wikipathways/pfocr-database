caption: Purine metabolic pathways. The schematic representation shows the de novo
  and salvage pathways and their crosstalk with mitochondria. The conserved de novo
  biosynthesis pathway to generate IMP consists of 10 chemical steps catalyzed by
  6 gene products in humans. These include the trifunctional enzyme TGART, composed
  of GAR synthetase (GARS), GAR transformylase (GARTfase), and AIR synthetase (AIRS)
  domains; the bifunctional enzymes PAICS, composed of CAIR synthetase/AIR carboxylase
  (CAIRS) and SAICAR synthetase (SAICARS), and ATIC, composed of AICAR transformylase
  (AICART) and IMP cyclohydrolase (IMPCH); and three monofunctional enzymes, phosphoribosyl
  amidotransferase (PPAT), formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthetase (FGAMS),
  and adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL). Downstream IMP is converted to (1) GMP through
  stepwise reactions of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) followed by GMP synthetase (GMPS)
  and (2) AMP via adenylosuccinate synthetase (ADSS) followed by ADSL. The salvage
  pathway requires PRPP to generate IMP and GMP through one-step reactions mediated
  by hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) utilizing hypoxanthine and guanine
  bases. AMP is generated by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) utilizing adenine
  base and PRPP as substrates. Mitochondria supply precursors for purine de novo biosynthesis
  including glycine, N10-formyl THF, and aspartic acid through their one-carbon cycle
  (1C cycle) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA).
