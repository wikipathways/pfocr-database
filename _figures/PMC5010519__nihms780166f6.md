caption: ABT-199 treatment releases Bim from Bcl-2. In sensitive cells, there is an
  inadequate amount of Mcl-1 to sequester all of the released Bim, resulting in free
  Bim, which can then activate the canonical apoptosis pathway. In ABT-199-resistant
  cells, the Bim released from Bcl-2 is sequestered by Mcl-1, stabilizing Mcl-1, and
  ultimately resulting in survival in the ABT-199-resistant cells. In the combined
  drug treatment, addition of daunorubicin or cytarabine abolishes Mcl-1 stabilization
  induced by ABT-199. This results in decreased sequestration of Bim, and allows for
  activation of Bax/Bak, resulting in apoptosis.
