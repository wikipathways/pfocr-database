caption: Mechanisms of interferon-γ mediated cancer regression. The IFN-γ stimulates
  activation of JAK/STAT signaling in the TME what further drives increased caspase
  activity and downregulation of SLC7A11 and SLC3A2. Consequently, cancer cells undergone
  apoptosis directly or through induced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. IFN-γ
  induces fragility of Tregs and inhibits the formation of tumor blood vessels by
  downregulating VEGF-A. Additionally, tumor angiogenesis is inhibited by IFN-γ-induced
  endothelial cells destruction. Through stimulation of M1 macrophage polarization
  and inhibition of their M2 phenotype, it contributes to effective antitumor immune
  response. The IFN-γ can stimulate p16INK4a-Rb pathway and thus, tumor senescence,
  while IFN-γ-mediated activation of IDO1-Kyn-AhR-p27 pathway shifts tumors to a dormant
  state. Moreover, IFN-γ increases FN1 expression that limits cancer metastasis. SLC7A11-solute
