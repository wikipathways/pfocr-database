caption: Pearson Correlation Network of Lipid Metabolism-Related Molecules in Bovine
  Hepatic Cells Following TMAO Treatment. This figure, based on Pearson correlation
  analysis results, depicts the interaction network among key genes, proteins, and
  metabolites in bovine hepatic cells after TMAO treatment. The types of nodes in
  the network diagram represent categories, including genes, proteins, metabolites,
  and pathways. Edges represent different regulatory relationships, with dashed lines
  indicating highly significant correlations (P < 0.01) and solid lines representing
  direct regulatory relationships. The color and size of the nodes reflect the relative
  importance of the molecules within the network
