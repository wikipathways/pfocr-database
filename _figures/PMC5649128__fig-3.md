caption: Activation of latent TGF-β1 by shear and oxidative stressors, and its regulation
  by endogenous factors. (A) Several interventions, including modulating redox pathways
  involving Nrf2 with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), glutathione reductase (GSH), nitric
  oxide (NO), and carbon monoxide (CO), can modify TGF-β1 by sulfation. Nrf2 is a
  key regulator of the expression of genes coding for many anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory
  proteins, and in endothelial cells the Nrf2 pathway serves as a mechanosensitive
  transcriptional regulator of redox signaling. (B) The functions of Nrf2 are mimicked
  by one of its major dependent proteins, HO-1, which acts through induction of heme,
  biliverdin, and bilirubin, and endogenous CO. Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor.
