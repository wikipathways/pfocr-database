caption: We have shown that thiolate substituents can serve as suitable migrating
  groups in 1,1-carboboration reactions (see  for typical examples). This effect was
  used to develop a sequential 1,1-carboboration route to a boryl substituted thiophene
  derivative. The product 30 was deborylated by treatment with acetic acid. It also
  served as a cross-coupling reagent for the synthesis e.g. of a substituted bithiophene
  derivative 31. Stephan et al. showed that the closely related bis(alkynyl) tellurium
  compound 32 underwent a consecutive series of 1,1-carboboration reactions with e.g.
  B(C6F5)3 to form an example of less often observed six-membered heterocyclic ring
  systems (33) (see )., A dimeric product was formed in a reversible competitive pathway.
