caption: '(1) SARS‐CoV‐2 attaches to type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC‐II) receptor
  angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). (2) Complement activation is initiated upon
  recognition of viral glycans by lectins (e.g. collectin‐11 and ficolin‐1, which
  are secreted by AEC‐II) complexed with MBL‐associated serine proteases (MASPs) including
  MASP‐2. Direct binding of MASP‐2 to the N protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 has also been suggested
  to initiate lectin pathway activation (preprint: Gao et al, ). (3) Complement deposition
  and MAC formation on AECs cause inflammasome activation and cell damage. (4) Release
  of complement C5a increases vascular permeability and recruitment/activation of
  polymorphs (PMN) and monocytes (MC) to the alveolus. (5) Monocytes differentiated
  into inflammatory macrophages (MΦ) overproduce pro‐inflammatory cytokines in response
  to C3a and C5a stimulation. (6) Endothelial cell (EC) activation by C5a and MAC
  predisposes to thrombus formation, further enhanced through MBL recognition of viral
  particles in the vascular compartment leading to cleavage of thrombin and fibrinogen
  by MASPs.'
