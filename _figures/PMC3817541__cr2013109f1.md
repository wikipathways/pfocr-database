caption: 'Potential mechanism of activity-dependent transcriptional repression by
  MeCP2. Neuronal activity (induced in cultured neurons by KCl, kainic acid or bicuculline
  treatment) leads to membrane depolarization, causing Ca2+ to enter through synaptic
  NMDA receptors (NMDA-R) or membrane voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC). This Ca2+
  influx triggers a signaling pathway (mechanism not elucidated) to phosphorylate
  MeCP2 at residue Threonine (T) 308. Phosphorylation at T308 blocks the interaction
  of MeCP2 with the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex, which is responsible for transcriptional
  repression in wild-type (WT) neurons. Lack of phosphorylation at this residue due
  to missense point mutations may contribute to Rett syndrome (RTT): some of the genes
  that are regulated via this mechanism include Npas4 and Bdnf, which are required
  for development of inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neurons, E/I balance, and
  activity-dependent plasticity of circuits. Inset (left, bottom): Bridge on the river
  Khwae Yai in Thailand, as depicted in the 1957 Academy Award-winning film ''The
  Bridge on the River Kwai''. The central bridge spans bear a striking resemblance
  to the structure of DNA, and remind us that MeCP2 can act as an activity-dependent
  ''bridge'' between NCoR and chromatin.'
