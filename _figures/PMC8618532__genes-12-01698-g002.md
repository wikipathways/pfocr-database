caption: Sirtuins link T cell metabolism and differentiation. (A) Differentiation
  of T CD4+ naïve cell (in blue) into Th9 cells (in green) is accompanied by a decrease
  in SIRT1 expression, releasing its inhibitory action on the mTOR/HIF1α axis and
  leading to an increase in aerobic glycolysis and IL9 expression. Differentiation
  into Treg cells (in orange) is associated with an increase in SIRT3 expression and
  oxidative phosphorylation, which supports their suppressive function. (B) Accumulation
  of resting memory CD8+ T cells (in violet) during aging or chronic infection is
  linked to a decrease in SIRT1 expression and the concomitant upregulation of glycolysis.
  Epigenetic silencing of SIRT1 expression by BATF also drives metabolic changes associated
  with effector CD8+ T cell differentiation (in beige). Red arrows indicate upregulation
  (up arrows) or downregulation (down arrows) induced by indicated stimuli. Red “X”
  indicate block of the depicted pathway regulated by sirtuins.
