caption: Schematic illustration of the main findings. Ang II potentially engages TLR2
  signaling pathway to activate NF-κB in vascular endothelial cells. NF-κB orchestrates
  the induction of EndMT transcription factors to reduce endothelial phenotype makeup
  and increase mesenchymal genes. In addition to regulating cell phenotype change,
  NF-κB increases the expression of extracellular matrix proteins. Ang II may cause
  the production and release of paracrine factors which may further facilitate EndMT
  in a TLR2-independent manner. Dotted lines indicate putative mechanisms where direct
  evidence of the underlying phenomenon is needed. These putative mechanisms include
  evidence that Ang II directly engages TLR2 and receptors or sensors involved in
  detecting and responding to Ang II-generated paracrine factors.
