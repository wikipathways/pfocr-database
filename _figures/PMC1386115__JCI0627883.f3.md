caption: Integration of lipid metabolic and inflammatory signaling in macrophages
  by LXRs. Recognition of cytokines, bacterial components, or intact pathogens by
  their corresponding receptors initiates expression of proinflammatory genes (e.g.,
  iNOS). Activation of the TLR3/4 receptors by these signals blocks LXR-dependent
  gene transcription and cholesterol efflux from macrophages via an IFN regulatory
  factor 3–dependent (IRF3-dependent) pathway. On the other hand, ligand activation
  of LXRs inhibits NF-κB–dependent induction of inflammatory gene expression. Intracellular
  bacteria induce LXRα expression, possibly through a NOD2-dependent pathway, and
  promote macrophage survival, through induction of Api6 (also known as AIM and SPα)
  and other targets.
