caption: Model for the mechanisms by which PRRSV infection upregulated miR-373 expression
  and miR-373 facilitated PRRSV replication. PRRSV, nsp9, and N upregulated miR-373
  expression, since they elevated the expression of Sp1, which was an important transcriptional
  factor for miR-373 expression. miR-373 enhanced PRRSV replication by its negative
  regulation of type I interferon induction and the type I interferon receptor signaling
  pathway, since miR-373 targeted NFIA, NFIB, IRAK1, IRAK4, IRF1, IFR9, IFNAR1, and
  IFNAR2.
