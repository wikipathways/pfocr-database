caption: 'Brca1 pathway is involved in microglia from hSOD1G93A mice. Gene ontology
  pathway map analyses of dysregulated genes either in hSOD1G93A microglia at symptomatic
  age (P90) or in hSOD1G93A motoneurones at the end stage of the disease (P120) demonstrate
  the involvement of Brca1 pathway. Thermometers indicate gene dysregulation (red:
  up-regulated; blue: down-regulated, thermometer levels correspond to the level of
  dysregulation). Thermometers with number 1 represent gene dysregulation in hSOD1G93A
  microglia and number 2 in hSOD1G93A motoneurones. Interactions between objects:
  green (positive or activation); red (negative or inhibition); grey (unspecified).
  B Binding (physical interaction between molecules), TR Transcription regulation
  (physical binding of a transcription factor to target gene’s promoter), +p Phosphorylation
  (protein activity is altered via addition of a phosphate group).  Binding protein  Transcription
  factor  Kinase  Generic enzyme'
