caption: Phx1 increases the long-term (stationary) viability of S. pombe cells via
  increasing stationary phase-specific pyruvate decarboxylase activities (PDC) through
  increased synthesis of Pdc201 and Pdc202 proteins and TPP supply (synthesis and
  transport). Elevation of stationary phase-specific PDC decreases the amount of pyruvate
  available for TCA cycle and respiration, which generates ROS that inhibits long-term
  survival during the stationary phase. Overall effects of Phx1 on the respiratory
  pathway (orange block) are presented with a dashed line. Whether increased production
  of NAD+ during fermentation contributes to long-term survival is not certain. There
  is a possibility that Phx1 is regulated negatively by the nutrient-dependent Pka1
  and Sck2 kinases, and positively by the stress-activated MAP kinase Sty1. Arrows
  and cross bars indicate activation and repression, respectively.
