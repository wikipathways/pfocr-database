caption: Metabolic state of naïve and activated T cells during tissue inflammation.
  Metabolically a naïve T cells behave like a resting cell during homeostasis. Glucose
  is broken down at steady rate into pyruvate which then enters the tri-carboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle leading to the generation of ATP needed for cellular energy. Upon
  activation, a naïve T cell differentiate into an effector and a memory T cell, which
  differ considerably from the naïve T cell in their metabolic profile. Effector T
  cells are characterized by increased glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1) expression needed
  for higher influx of Glucose. The influxed glucose is then catabolized through increased
  rate of glycolysis. The intermediate products of glycolysis are utilized for the
  generation of biosynthetic precursor through pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and
  amino acid synthesis. Also, there is increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and in
  some cases increased Fatty acid synthesis (FAS). The memory T cells and the Tregs
  behave similar to the naïve T cells metabolically. They maintain a steady rate of
  glycolysis, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) producing ATP. The
  striking characteristic of memory T and Treg cells is high FAO and FAS.
