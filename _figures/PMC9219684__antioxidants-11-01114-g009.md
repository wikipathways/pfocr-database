caption: Redox strategy underpinning salt tolerance in rice. A differential modulation
  of the redox balance is pivotal for the protection against salt stress in the tolerant
  rice variety. In Baldo, a rapid and effective modulation of the antioxidative systems
  allows a delay of the oxidative damage to the cellular components and consequent
  impairment of cell-cycle progression and cell viability due to a shift toward an
  ROS signaling mode instead of a damaging one. In this context, glutathione metabolism
  was identified as a possible pathway, which contributes to conferring salt tolerance
  on rice. A variety-specific modulation of the expression of the enzyme γ ECS and
  regulation, at a post-transcriptional level, of sulfur assimilation, mediated by
  osa-miR395, can contribute to the delayed decrease in plant growth and viability
  observed in tolerant Baldo rice variety.
