caption: IFN signal transduction cascade and defects in this pathway. The type I and
  type II receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins whose extracellular domains serve
  as IFN‐binding sites, whereas their cytoplasmic domains associate with members of
  the JAK kinase family and initiate signal transmission (). Upon binding to their
  specific receptors both type I and type II IFNs induce a number of signal transduction
  cascades, which involve the phosphorylation of various components such as TYK2,
  JAKs, and STATs. After recruitment to the receptor, STATs become phosphorylated,
  form homo‐ or heterodimers, and migrate to the nucleus to bind to specific sequences
  in the promoter of target genes. Type I IFN‐induced signaling then induces homodimerization
  of STAT1 and heterodimerization of STAT1 and STAT2. STAT1 and STAT2 associate with
  the cytosolic transcription factor IFN‐regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), forming a trimeric
  complex known as IFN‐stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and activates transcription
  by binding to the ISREs. Type II IFN associates kinases, JAK1 and JAK 2 phosphorylate
  STAT1, which then forms homodimers, translocates to the nucleus, and activates transcription
  by binding to the GAS sequences. IFN‐mediated signaling is controlled by several
  mechanisms including dephosphorylation of IFN‐γR1, JAK1, and STAT1 (mediated by
  SH2‐domain‐containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2, SHP2), inhibition of the JAKs
  (mediated by suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, SOCS1), proteasomal degradation
  of the JAKs, and inhibition of STAT1 (mediated by protein inhibitor of activated
  STAT1, PIAS1).
