caption: The regulation of GSDMD activation, pore forming and repair. (A) Canonical
  inflammasome pathway-mediated GSDMD activation in pyroptosis. (1) Canonical inflammasome
  pathway was activated upon recognition of exogenous and endogenous PAMPs, as well
  as DAMPs by PRRs. These PRRs recruit ASC and pro–caspase-1 via the interaction of
  PYD/CARD and further assemble these components together called inflammasome to generate
  activated caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 cleaved the full-length GSDMD and liberated
  the GSDMD-NT to insert into membrane and formed the pyroptotic pores. On the other
  hand, it can cleave pro–IL-1β/IL-18 into mature IL-1β/IL-18 and then release out
  of the cell together with cell content through GSDMD-pores to induce pyroptosis.
  (2) In addition to common PRRs, CARD8 can also act as a PRR to mediate the inflammatory
  process. HIV can be recognized by CARD8, causing pyroptosis. (3) 3Ca2+ influx can
  trigger the formation of ESCRT complex and initiate the membrane repair process.
  (B) Non-canonical inflammasome pathway-mediated GSDMD activation in pyroptosis.
  The activation of caspase-11 (in human) or caspase-4/5 (in murine) via lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) produced by Gram-negative bacteria. These active caspases have the capacity
  to cleave GSDMD to GSDMD-NT and form membrane pores. Potassium efflux through membrane
  pores and further results in the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Similarly, whereas
  the active caspase-1 causes the maturation of IL-1β, these mature cytokines were
  released out of cell via the pyroptotic pores punched by oligomerized GSDMD-NT complex.
  (C) Other pathway-mediated GSDMD activation in pyroptosis and non-lytic function
  of GSDMD. (1) YopJ of Yersinia, TNF, or ligands of TLR3/TLR4 inhibit the inhibitory
  effect of TAK1. The elimination of the inhibitory effect of TAK1 leads to the activation
  of NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequently forms the active caspase-1 to cleave pro–IL-1β
  to IL-1β. The relief of TAK1 also induces the assembly of complex IIb (also called
  Ripoptosome), which contains RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8. Active caspase-8 cleaves
  GSDMD into GSDMD-NT to form membrane pores which can release IL-1β. (2) In aging
  neutrophils, ELANE, produced from fractured granule membrane, induces the cleavage
  of GSDMD and further GSDMD-NT insert the membrane to form pores.
