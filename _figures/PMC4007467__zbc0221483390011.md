caption: Proposed integrin signaling switch model. Under unligated uPAR conditions,
  migration is mainly initiated by non-raft (pink plasma membrane) signals through
  FAK-Src (yellow) and requires both α5β1 integrin and uPAR. In contrast, uPAR ligation
  enhances motility resulting from a recruitment of uPAR-α5β1 integrin complexes (solid
  black lines), along with Cav-1 and Fyn to lipid rafts (blue plasma membrane), and
  a corresponding increase in the dependence of migration on the lipid raft-localized
  Cav-1-Fyn-Shc (orange) pathway. The raft-localized Cav-1-Fyn-Shc pathway activation
  induces a hypermigratory phenotype.
