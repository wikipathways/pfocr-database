caption: Signaling pathway of BMPs. Simplified schematic representation of the BMP
  signaling pathway. Members of the BMP family bind to serine/threonine receptors
  that are composed of type I and type II receptors which form heteromeric complexes.
  The signaling pathway can be divided into the canonical pathway and the non-canonical
  pathway. In the canonical pathway, also known as the SMAD-dependent pathway, SMAD1/5/8
  proteins are phosphorylated and form complexes with a common SMAD4. In the non-canonical
  pathway, BMPs signal without the involvement of SMAD proteins. Created with BioRender.com.
