caption: Monoaminergic modulation of aggression circuitry. The central VMHvl–PAG aggression
  pathway is most prominently controlled by the lateral septum (LS), the amygdala
  (AMY), and mPFC/OFC (a, central part). This aggression circuit in turn is modulated
  by 5-HT and DA signaling (a, lateral part). Red indicates aggression promoting circuit
  elements and green indicates aggression ameliorating circuit elements, as revealed
  through local lesioning, inhibition, and/or stimulation studies. The dark colors
  for VMHvl and LS indicate the high severity of behavioral consequences elicited
  by stimulation of the VMHvl (also known as the ‘hypothalamic attack area’) and septal
  lesioning (eliciting ‘septal rage’). (b) Summary of studies giving insight into
  the role of local 5-HT and DA signaling in modulating aggressive behavior. AH, anterior
  hypothalamic nucleus; DA, dopamine; MS, medial septum; PAGdl, dorsolateral periaqueductal
  grey; 5-HT, serotonin.
