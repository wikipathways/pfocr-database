caption: Cell positioning and signaling compensate for stochastic lateral inhibition
  in the worm vulval developmental pathway. (a) The precursor cells of the anchor
  cell (AC, orange) and the ventral uterine precursor (VU, blue) have similar lineage
  origins. Variability (i.e., noise) in cell division rates results in stochastic
  precursor birth order. The first-born precursor cell has higher LIN-12/Notch activity
  that biases lateral inhibition. The cell with high LIN-12/Notch takes on the VU
  fate, whereas the cell with low LIN-12/Notch activity takes on the AC fate. The
  first division at the MS cell stage has been inverted for illustration purposes
  (adapted from ). (b) LIN-12 lateral inhibition generates two exclusive fates via
  a nonautonomous bistable feedback loop (adapted from ). The bHLH transcription factor,
  HLH-2, mediates this feedback loop. (c) Robustness mechanisms, including reproducible
  cell positioning and directional LIN-12 signaling, compensate for the stochastic
  AC/VU decision.
