caption: Schematic representation of NO-mediated biofilm dispersal through HptB. In
  the absence of NO, NosP has no effect on NahK activity. As a result, NahK can autophosphorylate
  its conserved histidine residue, transfer phosphate intramolecularly to its receiver
  domain, and then engage in phosphotransfer with the HptB protein (Pa3345). We hypothesize
  that NosP, HptB, and NahK can interact with effector proteins that are yet to be
  identified, but their activity leads to biofilm formation. When NO is present, NO/NosP
  inhibits NahK activity, ultimately yielding a decrease in phosphate flow through
  the pathway and resulting in biofilm dispersal.
