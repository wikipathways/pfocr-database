caption: Scheme of heat transfer pathway from human core body to the environment.
  Tcore, Tsk, Tm, and Tair represent temperature of body core, skin, muscle, and ambient
  air. Pres, Psk, and Pa are water vapor pressure at respiratory tract, skin surface,
  and ambient air. Mrest and Mexer are metabolic heat production at rest and during
  exercise. The scheme was modified from Nadel et al. []
