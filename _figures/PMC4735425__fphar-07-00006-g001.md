caption: The model framework for basal ganglion, cortex, and thalamus. Two types of
  medium spiny neurons in the striatum, D1 and D2, project inhibitory (red) synapses
  to GPi (direct pathway) and GPe (indirect pathway) respectively. The GPe neurons
  are reciprocally coupled to themselves and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The STN
  projects excitatory (green) synapses to the GPi and the GPi projects inhibitory
  connections to the thalamus. Thalamocortical (TC) neurons excite reticular (Re)
  neurons that reciprocally inhibit TC. Sensory input excites TC and TC projects to
  the cortex containing pyramidal cells (Pyr) and inhibitory basket cells (BC). All
  cell types receive background excitatory and inhibitory fluctuating inputs that
  represent random synaptic activity. White rectangles represent membrane currents
  and colored ovals represent receptor types coupled to the membrane and synaptic
  currents. See text for currents and receptor types. PD pathology (red arrows) is
  implemented using DA neuronal cell death, mGluR2-3 dysfunction at the MSN-GPe (indirect
  pathway) connection and dorsal raphe changes; while compensatory changes (green
  arrows) include changes in the GPe-STN coupling and DA synapse modification, such
  as D2R upregulation and DAT downregulation.
