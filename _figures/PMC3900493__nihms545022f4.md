caption: a|During Citrobacter rodentium infection, the lymphotoxin (LT) pathway is
  part of an innate feedback loop in which retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptor
  γt(RORγt) innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)induce interleukin 12(IL 12) and IL 23production
  by local dendritic cells (DCs) via the LT pathway,. In response to IL 23, these
  ILCs produce IL 22, which promotes gut epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial
  peptides, such as RegIIIβ and RegIIIγ. These antimicrobial peptides have direct
  killing functions on C. rodentium and members of the commensal microbiota. LT dependent
  interactions between ILCs and stromal cells can also support the formation of isolated
  lymphoid follicles (ILFs) during infections. b | In response to a high fat diet,
  LT signalling is increased within the colon (V.U. and Y. X.F., unpublished observations)
  and this increases IL 23 and IL 22 production. This then induces the production
  of antibacterial proteins, which are essential for the clearance of some microorganisms
  (such as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB)) in response to high fat diet administration
  and which contribute to the alteration of the microbiota, which in turn confers
  greater weight gain. IL 22R, interleukin 22 receptor; LTβR, LTβ receptor.
