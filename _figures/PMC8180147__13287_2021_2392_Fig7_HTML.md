caption: IL-1β-primed ERCs promoted the anti-inflammatory profile transformation through
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation. Wnt/β-catenin pathway is participating in regulating
  the development and differentiation of immunocytes and exhibiting anti-inflammatory
  effects in chronic disease. In the present study, DKK1 expression in ERC turned
  to be decreased after priming with IL-1β. After infusing IL-1β-primed ERCs into
  colitis mice, it was found that the β-catenin expression in splenic and colonic
  tissues were strikingly increased. Moreover, the inflammatory profile (Th1, Th17,
  M1, IFN-γ, IL-17, TNF-α, and IL-6) was transformed into an anti-inflammatory state
  (Th2, Treg, M2, IL-4, and IL-10), which is in line with the β-catenin expression
  changes. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesize that downregulating DKK1 expression
  in ERCs could promote the wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in immune cells, which
  would enhance the anti-inflammatory properties and optimize the immunomodulatory
  effect of ERCs
