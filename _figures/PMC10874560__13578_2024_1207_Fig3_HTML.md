caption: Schematic of representative bacterial-origin immunostimulants signaling pathway.
  (A) LPS and MPL interact with TLR4, recruiting its downstream adaptors. LPS induced
  both the MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent signaling pathways, responsible for
  proinflammatory cytokine expression and Type I interferons, respectively. MPL activated
  the MyD88-independent signaling mediating the induction of Type I interferons. (B)
  The signaling cascade induction by flagellin can be through MyD88-dependent and
  MyD88-independent pathways. Flagellin activates the dimerization of TLR5 and then
  recruited MyD88 binding to the cytoplasmic portion of TLR5. The interaction leads
  to the activation of NF-κB signaling, inducing many downstream inflammatory-related
  genes expression. Meanwhile, TLR5 can form heteromeric complexes with TLR4 induced
  with flagellin, which lead to the activation of MyD88-independent signaling and
  production of NO. (C) Cytoplasmic flagellin activates caspase-1 and secretion of
  IL-1β via NLRC4/NAIP5-dependent inflammasome pathway. (D) CpG-ODN interacts with
  TLR9 in the endosome and recruits MyD88 and the downstream molecules, which activates
  either NF-κB or IRF7 according to the type of endosomes. The activation of NF-κB
  is responsible for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1, IL-6,
  IL-12, and TNF-α, while the activation of IRF-7 is responsible for the expression
  of type I interferons. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MPL, monophosphoryl lipid A; TLR,
