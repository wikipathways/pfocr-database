caption: Schematic view of the potential capacity of MECs to sense and react to bacteria
  that invade the MG lumen. At the apical side of the cell, the plasma membrane exposes
  Toll-like receptors (TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, TLR4) that pair to interact with bacterial
  lipoproteins and LPS. The TLRs receive help from accessory molecules such as CD36
  and MD2. TLR5 has not been documented in relation to MECs. MECs are devoid of membrane
  CD14, but milk provides soluble CD14 (sCD14). This allows TLR4 to be internalized
  upon ligation to smooth LPS in endosomes from where the TRAM-TRIF adaptors can be
  recruited to activate TRAF3. TLR3 from endosomes can also activate TRAF3. The TRIF-dependent
  signaling pathway induces the translocation of IRF3, resulting in the induction
  of type 1 IFNs and IFN-inducible genes. Contrary to TLR3, the other TLRs depend
  on the adaptor molecule Myd88. This triggers a cascade of activating steps involving
  TRAF6 and allows NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus and activate the transcription
  of cytokine genes. Another activation pathway mobilizes the MAP kinase cascade and
  leads to the activation of the transcription factor AP-1, critical in the activation
  of cytokine genes. MECs can respond to degradation products of bacterial cell wall
  peptidoglycan via the cytosolic sensors NOD1 and NOD2. The oligomerization of these
  sensors induces the recruitment of the adaptor protein RIP2, followed by the activation
  of the NF-κB pathway (). A number of stimuli induce the formation of molecular platforms
  called inflammasomes. The NLRP3 inflammasome recruits Caspase 1 that can cleave
  pro-IL-1β molecules and contribute to the secretion of the mature pro-inflammatory
  cytokine IL-1β. TRIF, Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein
  inducing IFNβ; TRAM, TRIF-related adaptor molecule; IRF3, IFN-regulatory factor
  3; Myd88, myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88; NOD, nucleotide-binding
  oligomerisation domain; RIP2, Receptor-interacting-serine/threonine-protein kinase
