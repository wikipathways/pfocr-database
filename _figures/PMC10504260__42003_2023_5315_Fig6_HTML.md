caption: In the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, cHO catalyzes the reaction of c-type
  heme to biliverdin IXα (left side, see blue arrow), which is of great importance
  for the synthesis, assembly and function of phycobiliprotein during recovery from
  nitrogen chlorosis. The cHO-dependent phycobiliprotein is important for the cell
  growth via assembling into phycobilisome as light-harvesting function after the
  nitrate is added to chlorotic cells (left side) and decomposing into nitrogen source
  as nitrogen-storage function after the nitrate is removed from the culture medium
  (right side).
