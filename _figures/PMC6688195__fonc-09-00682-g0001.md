caption: The key intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms exploited by HPV oncoproteins
  in keratinocytes (KCs). (A) High-risk HPV E6 and E7 recruit histone modifying enzymes
  (EZH2, HDAC1, and JARID1B) and DNA methylation enzyme (DNMT1) to suppress TLR9 and
  CXCL14 transcription. E6 and E7 also bind to the adapter protein STING and ubiquitin
  ligase E6-AP, leading to downregulation of cGAS–STING cytosolic DNA sensing system
  and degradation of pro-IL-1β. (B) High-risk HPV E6 and E7 block pathogen recognition
  receptors (PRR) signal transduction cascades by upregulating the deubiquitinating
  enzyme Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) to inhibit TNF-receptor-associated
  factor 3 (TRAF3) activation, and by binding to interferon regulatory transcription
  factor (IRF) to prevent its transcriptional activity in the nucleus. E6 an E7 also
  interfere with IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) signaling pathway by binding to tyrosine
  kinase 2 (TYK2) to hamper phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, and by interacting
  with IRF9 to prevent its binding to phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 for activating
  IFN-stimulated genes. (C) High-risk HPV E6 and E7 prevent the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB via upregulation of UCHL1. E6 and E7 are also capable of binding to P300/CBP-associated
  factor (PCAF), a coactivator of NF-κB in the nucleus, thereby downregulating the
  NF-κB signaling pathway. (D) High-risk HPV E7 can interact with the major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) I promoter, leading to repression of MHC I, LMP2, and TAP1 gene. In
  contrast, E5 reduces MHC I and CD1d expression by blocking the transport of MHC
  I and CD1d proteins to the cell surface via its interactions with host proteins
  in the Golgi complex and ER.
