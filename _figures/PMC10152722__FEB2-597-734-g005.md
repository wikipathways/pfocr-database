caption: The TRAPP complexes participate in key cellular processes. (A) The Rab activation
  cycle between GDP to GTP is facilitated by guanine exchange factors (GEFs), and
  GTPase activating proteins (GAPS). The conformational change between these two forms
  promotes the interaction of the GTP‐bound form with effector proteins. Rabs are
  linked to the membrane via a flexible C‐terminal hypervariable domain that is prenylated
  at the C‐terminus. In the cytosol, GDP‐bound Rabs are in a complex with chaperone
  proteins known as GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which hide the hydrophobic
  C‐terminal prenyl groups from the polar environment of the cytosol. (B) Rab1 and
  Rab11 are master regulators of different steps of the secretory pathway, and Rab1
  also regulates autophagy. TRAPPII activates Rab11 whilst TRAPPIII acts on Rab1.
