caption: Overview of the roles of EphB2 in cancer. (A) EphB2 exerts its roles in tumor
  cell growth, invasion and metastasis, as well as angiogenesis through multiple signaling
  pathways. (B) Model of SEV-induced angiogenesis pathway. EphB2 on cancer cell–derived
  small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) binds to ephrin-B2 on endothelial cells, and
  induces ephrin-B2 reverse signaling through downstream phosphorylation and activation
  of STAT3, thereby promoting angiogenesis ().
