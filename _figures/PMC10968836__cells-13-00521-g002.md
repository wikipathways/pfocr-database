caption: Comparison of the signalling pathways triggered by TNFR1, Fas and TRAIL agonist
  receptors. (a) TNFR1 signalling complexes upon TNFα stimulation are depicted in
  this panel (see also the text). TNFR1 engages first of all the formation of complex
  I, a survival membrane-bound platform which leads to the activation of the NF-κB
  pathway, and, in most cases, to cell survival and inflammation. Regardless of the
  outcome, complex I is processed during activation to give rise to a secondary soluble
  complex (complex II), that recruits pro-apoptotic components such as the adaptor
  protein FADD and the caspase-8 to induce apoptosis. Cell death is usually never
  happening, unless activation of the NF-kB pathway fails, because the latter induce
  the transcriptional regulation of cellular FLIP (c-FLIP), the main inhibitor of
  caspase-8. (b) Engagement of Fas, DR4 or DR5, contrary to TNFR1 enable direct recruitment
  of FADD and caspase-8 at the membrane in complex I. These agonist receptors are
  thus more prone in triggering apoptosis than TNFR1. Non-apoptotic signal transduction,
  however, is thought to proceed from a secondary complex coined complex II, which
  has been described as the FADDosome, Sequestrosome or the MISC (migration signalling
  complex). The latter leads to the activation of the NF-κB pathway to induce survival,
  pro-inflammatory and pro-tumoral effects. The secondary necroptotic complex is also
  depicted for TNFR1, TRAIL receptors and Fas (see text for more details)
