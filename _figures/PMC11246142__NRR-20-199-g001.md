caption: Schematic representation of calcium-calcineurin signaling pathway reducing
  α-synuclein (α-Syn) toxicity by reducing its misfolding in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  and enhanced membrane localization when Cnb1p overproduced.Upon binding with calcium
  calmodulin-dependent kinase Cmk2p further activates calcineurin (CN) phosphatase
  (Cna1p/Cna2p) which dephosphorylates the downstream transcription factor Crz1p.
  The dephosphorylated Crz1p stimulates the expression of an array of target genes
  related to calcium homeostasis and also an unknown factor (?-to be identified, X).
  Under unstressed and calcium-replete conditions, Cnb1p leads to balanced proteostasis.
  Whereas, compromised Calcineurin phosphatase activity either its absence or genetic
  perturbation, triggers protein misfolding (pM) and shifts the flux of native protein
  (pN) towards proteotoxicity and protein aggregates (pA), suggesting that calcineurin
  activity is limiting for proteostasis under normal conditions. A flat red arrowhead
  represents an inhibitory effect and a pointed arrowhead (black) represents activation.
  CN-a Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated type 2B protein phosphatase, Cna1p-Calcineurin A;
  one isoform (the other is Cna2p alias Cmp2p) of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin,
  Cnb1p-Calcineurin B; regulatory subunit of calcineurin, Cmd1p-Calmodulin; Ca2+ binding
  protein which also activates CN, Cmk2p-Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in yeast
  Crz1p-Transcription factor, activates transcription of stress response genes; nuclear
  localization is positively regulated by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation and
