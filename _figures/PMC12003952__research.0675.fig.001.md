caption: PLEVPs hydrogel alleviates psoriasis by modulating the IL-17 signaling pathway.
  PLEVPs are secreted or self-assembled from multivesicular bodies (MVBs) within P.
  frutescens leaf cells (①), delivering bioactive molecules including nucleic acids
  and proteins, with pab-miR396a-5p specially identified (②) and can be internalized
  by keratinocytes after topical application (③). Psoriasis progression is characterized
  by increased Th17 cell activation and IL-17 secretion, leading to keratinocyte hyperproliferation,
  inflammation, and apoptosis. The application of PLEVPs hydrogel leads to therapeutic
  effects of reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting apoptosis via caspase-3
  activation, and increasing Treg (Foxp3+) cell activity. The pab-miR396a-5p delivered
  by PLEVPs targets HSP90, down-regulating the IL-17 signaling pathway and subsequently
  reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17, TNF-α, and IL-6), inhibiting keratinocyte
  hyperproliferation and alleviating psoriasis symptoms
