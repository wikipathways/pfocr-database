caption: Manipulation of CCR5 expression. The expression of CCR5 leaves Vδ2 T cells
  susceptible to direct infection as well as activation of the p38-mediated cell death
  signaling pathway. (1) Ablation of the CCR5 gene could confer a degree of resistance
  to effector subsets prior to adoptive transfer generating (2) HIV-resistant γδ T
  cells. Traditional gene editing strategies have utilized zinc-finger nucleases or
  transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to recognize and cleave
  specific genomic sequences. More recently, focus has shifted to the use of clustered
  regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR associated protein
  9 (Cas9) that rely on a small single guide RNA that is complementary to the target
  gene sequence. Created with BioRender.com.
