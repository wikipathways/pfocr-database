caption: A proposed metabotropic signaling cascade of GluN2B that mediates ERK activation.
  Upon agonistic NMDA-R activation, Src family kinases phosphorylate specific tyrosine
  residues on the carboxyl terminal tail of GluN2B, including Y1252, Y1336, and Y1472.
  These phosphorylated tyrosines create docking sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins
  such as PLCγ and PI3K. Through these protein-protein interactions, GluN2B serves
  as a scaffold that orchestrates multiple signaling cascades converging on ERK activation.
  Direct signaling events are indicated by solid arrows, while indirect signaling
  relationships are shown with dotted arrows. The blue dotted arrows specifically
  denote calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Src, Rous Sarcoma Oncogene; PI3K, Phosphoinositide
