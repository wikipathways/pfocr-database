caption: 'Cysteine supply and metabolic circuits for the renal epithelial proximal
  tubular cells. The net intracellular supply of cysteine is a sum of different contributions.
  After glomerular filtration, there is an increase in the proximal tubule luminal
  content of CysSSP and also of glutathione (can also be secreted) and cysteine disulfides
  (CysSSX, mainly cystine). CysSSP undergoes reabsorption by lysosomal-mediated uptake
  [,,,] (A). CysSS is reabsorbed by cysteine-related transporters that include the
  heterodimer b0,+AT-rBAT, encoded respectively by SLC7A9-SLC3A1 [,]) (B). PEPT2 (encoded
  by Slc15a2) apical influx of CysGly [] also contributes toto cysteine intracellular
  availability (C). The extracellular thiol pool that nourishes the kidney tubular
  cell with Cys also has the contribution of the mercapturate pathway (D). The GGT,
  the first enzyme of the mercapturate pathway, has the highest activity in kidney
  epithelial tubular cells and hydrolyzes glutathione, contributing with CysGly and
  cysteine disulfides for the pool. The trans-epithelial transport of cysteine involves
  is the taken up through the brush border membrane (B) and its exit through the 4F2hc/LAT-2
  transporter at the basolateral membrane [] (E). Once inside the cell, cystine and
  CysGly are converted in Cys, which may undergo several metabolic circuitries: H2S-producing
  enzymatic pathways, CDO-mediated oxidative metabolism, GSH synthesis and protein
  incorporation (F). Intracellular CysSSX may also be N-acetylated by the last mercapturate
  pathway activity of NAT8 and eliminated in urine (G). CDO: cysteine dioxygenase;
