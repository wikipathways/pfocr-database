caption: ETS-4 functions in parallel to the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway (blue)
  to modulate a set of downstream targets (red circle). ets-4 may function upstream
  of (dotted line) or in parallel (solid line) to antagonize daf-16 function in longevity
  regulation. ETS-4-regulated gene set overlaps with that of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling
  pathway acting through DAF-16 (blue circle) as well as that of ELT-3 (green circle),
  which directs the age-regulation of a majority of genes that change expression with
  age.
