caption: Representation of TLR4-signaling through the MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent
  pathways. The MyD88-independent/TRIF-dependent pathway leads to the induction of
  IFN-β. IFN-β then binds to the IFNAR complex in an autocrine or paracrine way, leading
  to activation of ISGF3 and AAF. The former binds to IFN-stimulated response elements
  of IFN-inducible genes, such as those encoding IRF-7, OAS, and PKR. IRF-7 can bind
  to promoter elements of the genes encoding IFN-β and IFN-α. The molecules highlighted
  in yellow are those whose deletion in mice leads to resistance to endotoxemia.
