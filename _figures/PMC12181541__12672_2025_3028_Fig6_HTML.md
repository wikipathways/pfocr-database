caption: 'This mechanistic diagram illustrates the schematic representation of the
  molecular pathways by which hypoxia induces survival in liver cancer cells. Under
  hypoxic conditions, PYCR1 plays a dual role: (1) catalyzing the synthesis of proline,
  leading to a significant increase in intracellular proline levels; (2) regenerating
  NAD⁺ by consuming NADH, enhancing the critical NAD⁺/NADH ratio. The accumulation
  of proline and the increase in the NAD⁺/NADH ratio synergistically activate key
  pro-survival signaling pathways. Under hypoxia, PYCR1 activates the MAPK/ERK signaling
  pathway and the downstream STAT3 signaling pathway, leading to the enhancement of
  ERK phosphorylation activation (p-ERK) and STAT3 phosphorylation activation (p-STAT3).
  p-ERK and p-STAT3 serve as key effector molecules, ultimately converging and driving
  the enhanced survival capability of liver cancer cells, enabling them to survive
  under hypoxic stress'
