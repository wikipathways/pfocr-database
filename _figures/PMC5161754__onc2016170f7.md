caption: A model for EGFR activation during CRC progression through demethylation
  and subsequent upregulation of EREG at the adenoma–carcinoma transition. Colonic
  crypt and surface epithelial cells exhibit intermediate levels of methylation and
  low levels of EREG expression. The EREG promoter is heavily methylated in adenomas.
  This results in downregulation of EGFR and low levels of EGFR pathway activation.
  The EGFR pathway can be activated at the adenoma–carcinoma transition through demethylation
  of the EREG promoter and subsequent upregulation of EREG in a subset of CRCs. Black
  dots within cells represent an EREG transcript.
