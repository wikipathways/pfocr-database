caption: Model of BCAR3 in cell cycle progression. Inactive Cdc42 bound to GDP is
  activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain of BCAR3, a process
  facilitated by the scaffold proteins BCAR1 and HEF1. The activation of Cdc42 by
  BCAR3 plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle transition from the G1 to S
  phase by influencing the levels of cell cycle-related cyclins D, E, and A. This
  regulation is mediated via a complex network, potentially involving p70S6k. Additionally,
  the diagram highlights the interactions between HEF1 and other cell cycle regulators
  such as Aurora A, RhoA, and Src, which contribute to the correct timing of cell
  cycle events such as centrosome separation and mitotic progression. The figure underscores
  the significance of BCAR3’s multifaceted role in the cell cycle, particularly in
  the context of cancer research, where dysregulation of these pathways can have profound
  implications. Cartoon in Figure 4 was created with https://BioRender.com and accessed
