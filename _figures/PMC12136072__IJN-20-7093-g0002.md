caption: Signaling pathway of BMP4 as well as activators and inhibitors of BMP4 cellular
  signaling. BMP4 may interact with preformed complexes (PFCs), in which, BMPR Type
  I and Type II receptors are bound at the cell surface and with Type I receptors
  that form BMP4 induced signaling complexes (BISC) in association with Type II receptors.
  RGMs, DRAGON, and BAMBI can increase BMP4 dimer binding of Type I receptors in both
  PFCs and BISCs. Signal recognition leads to the phosphorylation of receptor associated
  SMADs (Smad1/5/8). Signaling activated SMADs merge with co-SMAD4 to affect the nucleus
  and in mutants with p300 or stat, they act as transcription initiationers which
  broaden neural and astroglial genes. BMP-1 as well as sulfated polysaccharides act
  as extracellular activator while Noggin, Chordin and Gremlin interact with BMP4,
  thus inhibiting the activity of this signal pathway. Pathway activity can be blocked
  using intracellular inhibitors SMAD6/7, Smurf1/2 and dorsomorphin. BMP4 may also
  use SMAD-independently signalling pathways for instance MAPK/p38, JNK, Erk etc Pseudo-receptors
  like BAMBI can bind to BMP4 dimers, however these pseudo-receptor complexes do not
  transduce signals due to absence of kinase domains on them. Adapted from Xi G, Best
