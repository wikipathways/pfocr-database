caption: Network of type I interferon response- and UPR-related genes. Large circles,
  differentially expressed genes; small circles, genes with no significant change
  in expression; red circles, type I interferon response factors; yellow circles,
  genes regulating DNA transcription; blue circles, unfolded protein response genes;
  red lines, genes involved in physical protein-protein interactions; blue lines,
  genes involved in a common pathway. This network was seeded with k-means clusters
  18 and 20, and many ribosomal protein genes were removed.
