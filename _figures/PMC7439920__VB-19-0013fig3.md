caption: Critical role of HGMB1 in the complex interplay between apoptosis and autophagy.
  HMGB1 participates in the modulation of apoptosis and autophagy through different
  pathways depending on its cellular localization. In the cytosol, HMGB1 forms complexes
  with Beclin-1, determining its dissociation from the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2
  and thus inducing autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis. In the nucleus, HMGB1 regulates
  the expression of the heat shock protein β-1 (HSPB1), responsible for the intracellular
  trafficking during autophagy and the attenuation of the apoptotic response through
  prevention of caspases activation. Finally, extracellular HMGB1 regulates the crosstalk
  autophagy/apoptosis by binding to the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products
  (RAGE), which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC) and activates the
  ERK1/2/MAPK pathway.
