caption: NLRP3 inflammasome activation following non-canonical inflammasome activation.
  The non-canonical inflammasome pathway is mediated by caspase-11 in mouse cell and
  caspase-4/caspase-5 in a human cell in response to cytoplasmic bacterial lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS). Caspase-4/5/11 cleaves GSDMD to initiate pyroptosis, thus leads to NLRP3
  inflammasome activation. GSDMD and P2X7 receptor/Pannexin-1 have been proposed to
  mediate potassium efflux, which underlies the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  following non-canonical inflammasome.
