caption: 'A variety of factors control Tn cell survival and metabolic pathway engagement
  after T cell activation. After TCR stimulation, mTORC1 and c-Myc promote glucose
  and amino acid uptake by enhancing expression of Glut1 and CD98. Shortly after T
  cell activation, mitochondrial biogenesis is engaged by Pgc1α. Cells also augment
  acquisition of serine, which is metabolized by mitochondrial Shmt2, and upregulated
  Gclc expression and cystine uptake support glutathione synthesis. Glutathione limits
  the accumulation of ROS from complex III, thereby facilitating T cell activation.
  Calcium import leads to activation of NFAT and AMPK, the latter of which might limit
  mTOR activation to preserve Tm cell differentiation potential. During the first
  division, asymmetric inheritance of the glycolytic modulators mTOR and c-Myc leads
  to differential T cell fate for the two daughter cells. Activated AMPK limits ACC1
  activity, and increased expression of Pparg leads to upregulated fatty acid import,
  thereby modulating fatty acid metabolism after activation. Abbreviations: ACC1,
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl
  5’-monophosphate; AMPK, adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase; FA, fatty
  acid; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; FAS, fatty acid synthesis; Gclc, glutamate-cysteine
  ligase catalytic subunit; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; NFAT,
  nuclear factor of activated T cells; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; Pgc1a, peroxisome
