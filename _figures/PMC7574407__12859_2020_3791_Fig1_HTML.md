caption: Workflow of gene-level models. In the 5 boxes are 5 intersected sets we achieved
  after filtering. “All” represents all the genes in the data, “Path” represents all
  the genes in the pathway collection, “COSM” represents all the genes in the COSMIC
  database, “Cox” represents all the genes which have significant p value in the univariable
  Cox model. The gene subsets represented by the 2 boxes after the dashed arrows were
  only applied to SPM data. 5-fold cross validation is conducted and for each training
  set, Cox Lasso is fitted. The estimated Cox model is applied to the test set to
  assess predictive performance. Unpenalized Cox models are also fitted, with the
  average value of lambda as the regularization parameter, to obtain non-shrunken
  coefficient estimates and p values
