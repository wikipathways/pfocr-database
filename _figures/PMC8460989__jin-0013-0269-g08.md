caption: 'Schematic diagram of mechanisms for exosome-mediated HIV inhibition in HCEs.
  Stimulation of HCEs with double-stranded RNA (Poly I:C) results in activation of
  TLR3 signaling pathway and production of the exosomes that contain the multiple
  cellular antiviral factors, including several key IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs: ISG56,
  OAS1, MxA, and Mx2) and the HIV restriction microRNAs (miR-28, miR-29 family members,
  miR-125b, miR-150, miR-382, miR-223, miR-20a, and miR-198). These exosomes can be
  released by HCEs and taken up by HIV-infected macrophages where the released antiviral
  ISGs and the HIV restriction miRNAs can inhibit HIV at different steps of viral
  replication. HCEs, human cervical epithelial cells; HIV, human immunodeficiency
  virus.'
