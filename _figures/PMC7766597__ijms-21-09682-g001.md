caption: 'The four different types of regulated cell death. (A). Apoptosis. Apoptosis
  is a form of orderly programmed cell death, occurring both via an extrinsic pathway
  and an intrinsic pathway. In the extrinsic pathway, after a DR is engaged (TNFR
  as an example depicted here) by its ligand (here, TNF), it oligomerizes and binds
  the adaptor TRADD, the E3 ubiquitin ligases TRAF2/5, cIAPs, and LUBAC, as well as
  the kinase RIPK1 to form Complex I. Then, RIPK1 becomes polyubiquitinated and serves
  as a scaffolding protein for the further recruitment of TAK1-TAB1/2 and IKKα/β-NEMO.
  TAK1 activates the MAPK pathway, while phosphorylation and the subsequent degradation
  of IκB leads to NFκB activation and the transcription of pro-survival/inflammatory
  genes. If RIPK1 is deubiquitinated, it forms Complex IIa, consisting of FADD, TRADD,
  RIPK1, and caspase 8. Caspase 8 becomes activated in Complex IIa, in turn activating
  its downstream executioner caspases 3 and 7, leading to apoptosis. In the intrinsic
  pathway, caspase 8 mediates the cleavage of Bid into tBid. tBid translocates to
  the mitochondria where it binds BAX/BAK, leading to MOMP and Cytochrome C release.
  Cytochrome C binds Apaf-1, releasing its auto-inhibitory hold and allowing for its
  oligomerization, apoptosome formation, and caspase 9 activation. In turn, caspase
  9 activates the executioner caspases 3 and 7, leading to apoptosis. (B). Necroptosis
  occurs when death receptors (such as TNF and FAS) or pattern recognition receptors
  (such as TLR2/3) are activated in the presence of pan-caspase inhibitors to block
  apoptosis. In this instance, deubiquitinated RIPK1 forms Complex IIb (also known
  as the necrosome) by associating with RIPK3 through their shared RIP homology interaction
  motif (RHIM) to form the necrosome. RIPK3 auto-phosphorylates, polymerizes, and
  in turn recruits and phospho-activates MLKL to the necrosome (pMLKL). Subsequently,
  pMLKL translocates to the plasma membrane where it forms a tetramer and permeabilizes
  the cell membrane causing oncolysis. (C). Pyroptosis. Pyroptosis occurs through
  two pathways. In the canonical pathway, upon the recognition of external toxins
  or pathogens, the supramolecular inflammasome (consisting of NLRPs, NLRC4, AIM2,
  the adaptor ASC, and pro-caspase 1) forms. Pro-caspase 1 undergoes autocatalytic
  cleavage to form activated caspase 1. In turn, caspase 1 cleaves pro-IL-1β into
  active IL-1β and GSDMD into GSDMD-C and GSDMD-N. GSDMD-N translocates to the plasma
  membrane where it forms a pore, releasing DAMPs (such as ATP and HMGB1) and IL-1β.
  In the noncanonical pathway, the detection of LPS directly activates caspases 4/5/11,
  which then cleaves GSDMD to form the membrane pore and induce pyroptosis. (D). Ferroptosis.
  Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death that is driven by intracellular lipid
  peroxidation and is highly dependent on ROS generation and iron availability. Cystine
  enters the cell by the cystine/glutamate antiporter (System Xc-). Within the cell,
  cystine is reduced to cysteine, and glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) catalyzes the
  synthesis of γ-glutamyl cysteine from glutamate and cysteine. Glutathione synthase
  (GS) generates glutathione (GSH) by adding glycine. GSH reduces free radicals when
  it is reduced to GSSG by glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4). GPX4 and other free radical
  scavengers such a ferrostatin-1 inhibit lipid peroxidation (lipid-ROS). In the absence
  of GPX4, lipid peroxides accumulate driving ferroptosis. Abbreviations: AIM2: absent
