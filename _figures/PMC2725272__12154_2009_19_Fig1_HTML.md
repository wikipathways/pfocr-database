caption: 'Four distinct modes of MDM2 function. The top panel highlights the domain
  structure of MDM2, including the hydrophobic pocket in the N-terminus [], the acidic
  central domain [], a zinc-binding motif [], the RING domain [], and ATP-binding
  site imbedded within the RING domain []. MDM2 was identified as a protein that regulates
  the p53 tumor suppressor via (1) inhibition of p53-dependent transcription [, ].
  Germline mutations in the mdm2 promoter that result in MDM2 over-production result
  in enhanced MDM2 protein in chromatin fractions, which mediates suppression of p53
  function as a transcription factor [, ]. The second function identified for MDM2
  involved its ability to (2, 3) catalyze p53 degradation through a ubiquitin-dependent
  pathway [] []. This ubiquitination function of MDM2 also involves ubiquitination
  and degradation of ribosomal proteins that can normally function to stimulate p53
  protein synthesis []. According to the dual-site mechanism of MDM2-mediated ubiquitination
  of p53 [], two structural changes can enhance p53 ubiquitination by MDM2: one structural
  change involves (2) destabilizing missense mutations in p53 that unfolds the p53
  tetramer and that can expose the ubiquitination signal in the DNA-binding domain
  [], thus enhancing p53 ubiquitination in cells []; the second structural change
  involves (3) the lid of MDM2 whose phospho-mimetic mutation increases MDM2-mediated
  ubiquitination of p53 tetramers by stabilizing the MDM2:p53 complex (this study).
  Small molecules that bind to the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 (Nutlins)
  can activate p53 [] presumably by inhibiting the chromatin-bound pool of MDM2 since
  Nutlins cannot inhibit MDM2 function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase []. Rather, to date,
  peptide mimetics that bind to the MDM2 acidic domain provide a lead for inhibiting
  MDM2 function as a E3 ubiquitin ligase []. Additional research has highlighted novel
