caption: Models for Ebi function in R7 induction. Data presented in this paper are
  consistent with the following models for Ebi function in R7 development. (A) Ebi
  functions in a common biochemical pathway with Phyl and Sina to down-regulate Ttk88;
  (B) Ebi is a signal-independent constitutive negative regulator of Ttk88; (C) Ebi
  participates in a parallel pathway regulating Ttk88 downregulation activated by
  the EGFR.
