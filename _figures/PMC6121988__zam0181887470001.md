caption: Proposed metabolic pathways for lignin-to-PHA bioconversion. Key genes and
  metabolic intermediates are highlighted in red. Identifications (IDs) of the corresponding
  genes in A514 are shown. (A) Lignin degradation pathways. Dashed arrows indicate
  multiple steps. (B) De novo fatty acid biosynthesis. (C) β-Oxidation pathway. After
  each turn of the cycle, an acyl-CoA (indicated as Cn) that is two carbons shorter
  than the initial one (indicated as Cn + 2) is generated. The dashed line connects
  acyl-CoA intermediates of different chain lengths. (D) PHA biosynthesis pathways.
  (E, F, and G) Expression ratios for alkK homologs and phaG and phaJ genes, as well
  as for PHA synthetic genes, in A514 that were grown under the low-N conditions,
  compared to those grown under the high-N conditions. The ratios that were >1 were
  defined as induced. (H) Expression levels of the phaJ4, phaG, and alkK (PputA514_1839)
  genes in A514 under both high-N and low-N conditions. The inset in panel H shows
  the expression level of phaJ4 at an appropriate scale. The expression levels and
  expression ratios are defined in Materials and Methods.
