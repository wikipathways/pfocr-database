caption: A schematic model of the angiopoietin-Tie2 ligand-receptor system. Quiescent
  endothelial cells are attached to pericytes that constitutively produce Ang-1. As
  a vascular maintenance factor, Ang-1 reacts with the endothelial tyrosine kinase
  receptor Tie2. Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of Tie2 results in receptor
  dimerization, autophosphorylation, docking of adaptors and coupling to intracellular
  signalling pathways. Signal transduction by Tie2 activates the PI3K/Akt cell survival
  signalling pathway, thereby leading to vascular stabilization. Tie2 activation also
  inhibits the NF-κB-dependent expression of inflammatory genes, such as those encoding
  luminal adhesion molecules (for example, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular
  cell adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin). Ang-2 is stored and rapidly released from
  WPBs in an autocrine and paracrine fashion upon stimulation by various inflammatory
  agents. Ang-2 acts as an antagonist of Ang-1, stops Tie2 signalling, and sensitizes
  endothelium to inflammatory mediators (for example, tumour necrosis factor-α) or
  facilitates vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis. Ang-2-mediated
  disruption of protective Ang-1/Tie2 signalling causes disassembly of cell-cell junctions
  via the Rho kinase pathway. In inflammation, this process causes capillary leakage
  and facilitates transmigration of leucocytes. In angiogenesis, loss of cell-cell
  contacts is a prerequisite for endothelial cell migration and new vessel formation.

  description: A schematic model of the angiopoietin-Tie2 ligand-receptor system.
    Quiescent endothelial cells are attached to pericytes that constitutively produce

    Tie2 activation also inhibits the NF-κB-dependent expression of inflammatory genes,
