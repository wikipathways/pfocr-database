caption: (1) Nicotine binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, causing a conformational
  change that opens the receptor's ion channel and allowing entry of Ca2+ and Na+.
  The influx of these cations further activates voltage-dependent calcium channels,
  allowing more Ca2+ to enter, increasing the production of second messenger cyclic
  AMP (cAMP). These increases in cAMP lead to the activation of the transcription
  factor CREB, inducing increased expression of NRG3. (2) The NRG3 EGF-like domain
  is then proteolytically cleaved by BACE1 and binds to the ErbB4 receptor. Upon binding
  of NRG3, conformational changes increase the affinity for another ErbB molecule,
  thus leading to homo- or heterodimerization. This dimerization results in activation
  of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases and other intracellular signaling pathways referred
  to as canonical forward signaling. (3) An alternative pathway results from the cleavage
  of the intracellular domain of ErbB4 by a gamma-secretase complex and subsequent
  translocation to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription, also known as noncanonical
  forward signaling. (4) NRG–ErbB4 signaling can also directly suppress Src-mediated
  enhancement of synaptic NMDAR function.
