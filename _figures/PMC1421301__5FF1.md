caption: Figure 1. Effects of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) on cells. The signal is transduced
  through the IFN-γ receptor, which consists of two distinct proteins (α and β subunits).
  This activates the Jak/Stat-1 pathway (Jak, Justin A kinase; STAT1, S ignal T ransducer
  and A ctivator of T ranscription-1), and the phosphorylated STAT1 translocates to
  the nucleus, where it induces the transcription of primary IFN-γ response genes.
  Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a primary response gene; interferon regulatory
  factor 2 (IRF-2) induction is later and is influenced by other, poorly understood
  factors, including IRF-1. IRF-1 and IRF-2 bind to the same nuclear binding site
  on other secondary genes; IRF-1 is a transcription activator, and IRF-2 blocks the
  IRF-1 action. Actions distal to the IRF activity include MHC class I expression,
  inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, intercellular adhesion molecule-1
  (ICAM-1) expression, and cell growth effects. There are conflicting data regarding
  control of expression of MHC class II transactivator (CIITA). TAP-1, transporter
  associated with antigen processing-1.
