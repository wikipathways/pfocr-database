caption: Calcium signaling regulation in keratinocytes. (1) Increased intracellular
  calcium levels are regulated by calcium influx through transient receptor potential
  cation channel subfamily C member 1 (TRPC1) and calcium transport into the Golgi
  apparatus via secretory pathway calcium ATPase 1 (SPCA1). Additionally, calcium
  is sequestered back into the endoplasmic reticulum by SERCA2, preventing cytosolic
  calcium overload. (2) Extracellular Ca2+ also represents a signal for activation
  of the G-protein-coupled calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), which, via an intracellular
  signal transduction mechanism, actives phospholipase C (PLC). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG). (3) IP3 binds to Ca2+ channels located on the ER and Golgi
  membrane, resulting in their opening and the release of Ca2+ from intracellular
  reserves into the cytosol. (4) Increased intracellular Ca2+ leads to the activation
  of a series of calcium-dependent proteins. One example is calmodulin, a Ca2+-binding
  protein, which in turn activates calcineurin phosphatase. (5) The latter mediates
  the dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), a transcription
  factor that migrates into the nucleus and activates gene expression typical of the
  Ca2+ signaling pathway. DAG leads to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) that
  is involved in the phosphorylation and activation of intracellular effector proteins,
  including the Fos/Jun transcription factor family, mediating the transcription of
  keratinocyte differentiation genes. (6) Finally, calcium homeostasis is restored.
  This is accomplished by SERCA2 and SPCA1 transporters that mediate the reuptake
  of Ca2+ into intracellular stores in the ER and Golgi, respectively
