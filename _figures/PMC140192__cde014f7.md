caption: Fig. 7. A partial depiction of the TGF-β and EGF pathways and their cross-talk
  mechanisms impacting on Smad activities. Activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway
  leads to phosphorylation-induced stabilization of the TGIF protein. Altering the
  TGIF levels can modulate the TGF-β-induced antiproliferative p15Ink4b gene response
  and sensitivity of the cell to growth inhibition by TGF-β. These findings thus suggest
  a novel link for cross-talk between the Ras/MAP kinase and TGF-β pathways at the
  transcriptional level. TGIF recruitment into Smad complexes decreases transcriptional
  activation responses and may also act as a mediator of the negative effects of the
  Smad pathway on gene expression. Arrows denote upregulation; tee bars, downregulation.
