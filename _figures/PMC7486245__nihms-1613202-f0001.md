caption: 'Binding of the Tgf-β ligand leads to assembly and activation of the Tgf-β
  receptor complex. This complex phosphorylates SMADs2/3 (canonical signaling) and
  TAK1 (non-canonical signaling). Mstbn promotes this process in SMAD2 while inhibiting
  it in SMAD3. Inhbaa does the inverse: promoting phosphorylation of SMAD3 while inhibiting
  it in SMAD2. SMAD7 can inhibit phosphorylation of both SMAD2/3. The phosphorylated
  SMAD2/3 can then complex with SMAD4. This complexing can be inhibited by SMAD6.
  The SMAD2/3/4 complex can translocate to the nucleus and act as a transcription
  factor. In the non-canonical signaling pathway, phosphorylated TAK1 can activate
  MKK3 which in turn phosphorylates p38. Activated p38 can translocate to the nucleus
  and act as a transcription factor. Bmp2/10 ligands can activate the BMP receptor
  complex, which will in turn phosphorylate SMADs1/5/8. These phosphorylated SMADs
  can then bind to SMAD4, translocate to the nucleus and act as a transcription factor
  (, , , , –). Note: The Tgf-β signaling pathway is much more complex than depicted
  here, and includes crosstalk with other signaling pathways that can regulate cardiomyocyte
  proliferation, such as cell cycle progression regulation and Hippo signaling.'
