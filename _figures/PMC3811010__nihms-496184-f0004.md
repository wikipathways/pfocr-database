caption: Visualization of target genes of CDX1 and CDX2, and the BMP/TGFβ signaling
  pathway with GenMapp, using cDNA array data (the Hao dataset and the Greenawalt
  dataset). Red boxes indicated genes that were up-regulated in BE, while green boxes
  indicated genes that were down-regulated in BE. Uncolored boxes denoted genes that
  were not found to be differentially expressed or were not present in the dataset.
  Dashed boxes represented genes that had multiple spots on the microarray showing
  differential expression. The central color of dashed boxes with multiple colors
  denoted the expression pattern for the mode of spots, while the rim color denoted
  the expression pattern of the minority of spots.  showed differential expression
  of target genes of CDX1 and CDX2.  showed differential expression of genes of the
  BMP/TGFβ signaling pathway.
