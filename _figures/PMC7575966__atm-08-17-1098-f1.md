caption: 'Enzymes and intermediate products of the heme synthesis pathway. Heme synthesis
  is an important metabolic pathway present in all nucleated cells of the body where
  its final product is the cofactor of essential hemoproteins involved in biological
  functions: oxygen binding and transport (myoglobin and hemoglobin), electron transport
  (cytochromes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain), catalytic decomposition of
  hydrogen peroxide (peroxidases and catalases), synthesis of steroid hormones and
  oxidative metabolism of exogenous and endogenous compounds (mitochondrial and microsomal
  cytochromes of the P450 complex), tryptophan degradation (tryptophan pyrrolase)
  and nitric oxide synthesis (nitric oxide synthetase). Heme is also essential as
  substrate for heme oxygenase (HO) to yield carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin,
  which is subsequently reduced to bilirubin by cytosolic biliverdin reductase. CO
  is a strong vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent and both
  biliverdin and bilirubin are efficient scavengers of reactive oxygen species thus
  reducing the formation of peroxidation products. About 80% of daily heme synthesis
  occurs in the erythropoietic lineage and hepatocytes synthesize about 15% of total
  daily body heme. A delicate regulation of the route is essential because both heme
  and its intermediate metabolites are toxic at high concentrations. The ALA-synthetase
  (ALAS) is the first enzyme and rate-limiting reaction in heme synthesis. It has
  two isoenzymes, one ubiquitous (ALAS1) and the other erythroid (ALAS2). Heme regulates
  ALAS1 by a negative feedback mechanism, its translocation to the mitochondria and
  degradation. ALAS2 is characterized by high steady state level and is tied to availability
  of iron. In addition, the first four enzymes have specific erythroid and housekeeping
  promoters. Finally, the pathway is highly compartmentalized, the first and the final
  three steps are catalyzed by proteins that reside in the mitochondria while the
  remaining four steps are catalyzed in the cytosol. Each porphyria is caused by a
  loss or gain function of one of the enzymes involved in the pathway leading to overproduction
  and accumulation of porphyrins and/or their precursors. Accumulation of early pathway
  intermediates (ALA and PBG) leads to neurologic symptoms. These simple molecules
  are exclusively eliminated by urine. Four monopyrrol PBG are cyclized to form a
  porphyrinogen molecule. Oxidation of these tetrapyrrole rings lacking metal, leads
  to the fluorescence responsible for the phototoxic effects primarily affecting the
  skin. Porphyrinogen excretion (and its corresponding oxidized molecule, the porphyrin)
  is conditioned by their water solubility. While octacarbonyl URO is water-soluble,
  dicarboxylic PROTO is hydrophobic and is removed by biliary excretion and through
  the feces. The tetracarboxylic COPRO is preferably eliminated by bile but also by
  urine. White boxes represent the intermediate products: ALA, δ-aminolaevulinic acid;
  PBG, porphobilinogen (also known as Hydroxymethylbilane, HMB); UROgen, uroporphyrinogen;
  COPROgen, coproporphyrinogen; PROTOgen, protoporphyrinogen. Red boxes are porphyrins,
  resulting from the oxidation of the corresponding porphyrinogens: URO, uroporphyrin;
  COPRO, coproporphyrin; PROTO, protoporphyrin. Yellow boxes are enzymes: ALA-S, Amino-aminolaevulinic
  synthase; ALA-D, Aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase; PBGD, Porphobilinogen deaminase
