caption: The life cycle of HCV, including attachment, entry, uncoating, encapsidation
  and secretion, is depicted. Interaction of extracellular HCV with cellular surface
  receptors initiates the entry process, which can also occur from direct cell-to-cell
  transmission. After pH-dependent fusion and uncoating, the incoming HCV genome is
  translated and the resulting polyprotein processed. Replication takes place in ER-derived
  membrane spherules (membranous web). In the assembly and secretion release process,
  the core protein is transferred from the lipid droplets to form nucleocapsids that,
  assisted by NS5A, are loaded with RNA. The replicase proteins can bind to the HCV
  genomic RNA during transfer from replication to packaging in close proximity, but
  eventually are removed from the maturing nucleocapsids, the intracellular sites
  of which might converge. HCV virion morphogenesis is coupled to the VLDL pathway,
  and particles are produced as lipoviral particles (LVPs). CLDN1, claudin-1; cLD,
