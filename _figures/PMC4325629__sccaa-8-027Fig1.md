caption: 'Canonical Hedgehog (Hh) signaling.Notes: (A) In the inactive state the transcription
  factors GLI-2 and GLI-3 are non-specifically phosphorylated by casein kinase (CKI),
  glycogen synthase 3β (GSK3β) and protein kinase A (PKA) and retained in the cytoplasm
  in a protein complex associated with the inhibitory molecule suppressor of fused
  (SUFU). This complex undergoes E3 ubiquitin mediated proteolysis to the truncated
  repressor form which, on translocating to the nucleus, strongly inhibits the Hh
  pathway. (B) The Hh pathway is activated by the binding of Hh ligands (sonic [SHH],
  Indian [IHH] or desert [DHH]) to the receptor Patched1 (PTCH1), causing its internalisation
  and removing repression of Smoothened (SMO). SMO causes accumulation of the active
  from of GLI-2 and GLI-3 in the nucleus, and potentiates the activity of other positive
  regulators of the pathway resulting in transcription of key downstream targets and
  regulators of chromatin formation, cell cycle activity, cell mobility and apoptosis.Abbreviations:
