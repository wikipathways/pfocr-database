caption: 'Overview of metabolic engineering strategies. A. Schematic metabolic pathways
  describing the (over-)expression of the ethanol degradation pathway and the phosphoketolase
  pathway. The genes of interest are: xpkA (xylulose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase),
  ack (acetate kinase), pta (phosphotransacetylase), ADH2 (alcohol dehydrogenase 2),
  ALD6 (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase), acsSEL641P (acetyl-CoA synthetase) and ws2 (wax
  ester synthase). B. Stoichiometric equations for the conversion of glucose to the
  product of interest, FAEE, via either the EMP pathway or the combination of PP and
  PHK pathway. For convenience it was assumed that the acyl-CoA chain was unsaturated
  and 16 carbons long. Abbreviations: ADP (adenosine diphosphate), NAD+ (nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide), NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogenase),
  ATP (adenosine triphosphate), NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogenase),
  NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).'
