caption: 'Antagonism between mFAO and glycolysis and accumulation of acetyl-CoA from
  fatty acid oxidation (adapted according to De Oliveira and Liesa []). Overactivated
  mitochondrial β-oxidation inhibits glycolysis and may also suppress the Krebs cycle.
  The main consequences are increased mitochondrial ratios of NADH/NAD+, acetyl-CoA/CoA,
  ATP/ADP, as well as citrate accumulation in the mitochondria. The green arrows indicated
  the expressed pathway. The gray arrows indicate the suppressed pathway. The red
  blunt ends indicate the inhibition of a particular enzyme. ACC1 and ACC2: acetyl-CoA
  carboxylases 1 and 2; ACLY: ATP citrate lyase; AMPK: 5′AMP-activated protein kinase
  (dephosphorylated state); CIC: mitochondrial citrate carrier; CTP1 and CTP2: carnitine
  palmitoyl transferases 1 and 2; F6P: fructose-6-phosphate/fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  G6P: glucose-6-phosphate; GAP: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; a-KG: a-ketoglutarate;
  MCD: malonyl-CoA decarboxylase; MPC: mitochondrial pyruvate carrier; OAA: oxaloacetate;
  PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; PC: pyruvate carboxylase; PFK1: phosphofructokinase-1;
  PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate; PK: pyruvate kinase; Succ: succinate.'
