caption: 'Intracellular vs. Extracellular Functions of GrB. (A). GrB’s intracellular
  role is in the induction of apoptosis through the granule-induced apoptotic pathway.
  GrB is a critical component of the lytic granules released by cytotoxic T lymphocytes
  (CTL) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. These cell types form an immunological synapse
  with target cells and release lytic granules containing both GrB and perforin into
  the synapse. Perforin multimerizes into the target cell’s plasma membrane, creating
  a 5–20 nm diameter pore and facilitates endocytosis of GrB into target cells, wherein
  it then escapes from the endosome into the cytoplasm through a perforin-dependent
  manner and acts intracellularly to induce apoptosis through multiple caspase-dependent
  and caspase-independent mechanisms. (B). GrB’s extracellular role is in the promoting
  cytokine release, extracellular matrix (ECM) protein cleavage, tight junctional
  (TJ) protein degradation, and proinflammation in AMD and FECD. B1) Outer retina
  of a healthy eye with intact Bruch’s membrane and RPE barrier functions in the absence
  of extracellular GrB activity. B2) Age-related buildup of extracellular GrB degrades
  ECM and Ti proteins. Known substrates of GrB include FN, LAM, COL, JAMS and occludin.
  The early pathological sequence of AMD development (before vision loss) include:
  i) ECM remodeling and pro-inflammation; ii) Accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material
  (including soft drusen deposits) between Bruch’s membrane and RPE; iii) RPE gene
  dysregulation, atrophy and cell death associated with the dry form of AMD; iv) While
  it is not known why or how dry AMD transitions to wet AMD, it is known that in most
  cases, the dry form precedes the wet form of AMD. B3) Descemet’s membrane and corneal
  endothelium of a healthy eye with intact corneal endothelial barrier function. No
  extracellular GrB is present. B4) Descemet’s membrane and corneal endothelium of
  an eye with FECD. The putative sequence of events that lead to FECD include: i)
  the corneal endothelium becomes increasingly permeable to water, TGF-β signaling
  is upregulated, causing increased ECM protein production, and corneal endothelial
  cells (CECs) accumulate both ER stress and oxidative stress; ii) Descemet’s membrane
  (DM) becomes abnormally thick and cytotoxic protein deposits called guttoe form,
  iii) CECs undergo polymegathism, pleomorphism and ultimately apoptosis.'
