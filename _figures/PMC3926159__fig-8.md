caption: Potential model of mechanotransduction forces driving enterogenesis. Based
  on the data presented here, physical force (potentially via cell membrane integrins)
  driving of the FAK pathway plays a central role in mechanotransduction during enterogenesis.
  FAK activation leads to a polymerization with α-actinin. This then leads to several
  downstream regulatory processes, including RAC-1 and cell shape changes. RAC has
  been shown to activate p38MAPK which can lead to AKT activation and decreased apoptosis.
  FAK activation also led to AKT and ERK activation facilitating proliferation and
  survival. Whether the cell shape change and the increase in cell proliferation and
  survival are directly linked remains to be addressed.
