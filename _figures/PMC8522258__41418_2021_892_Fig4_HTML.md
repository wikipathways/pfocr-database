caption: Before the SARS-CoV-2 infection, comorbidity-associated glutamine deficiency
  (1) and comorbidity-associated NAD+ deficiency (2) lead to low α-KG (4) and impaired
  SIRT1 activity (3), respectively. This results in the hyperproduction of HA and
  PAI-1, and immunodeficiency. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, STAT3 is activated through
  the EGFR pathway (5) and the extracellular UDP-Glucose-stimulated P2RY14 pathway
  (6). Activated STAT3 can induce the transcription of HAS2 (7). The HAS2 enzyme is
  stabilized by O-GlcNAcylation, and HA is produced (8). In addition, a critical HAS2
  negative regulator, SIRT1 (3), is neutralized by SARS-CoV-2 infection and low NAD+
  levels. This results in increased HAS2 activity and higher HA levels, and contributes
  to a hyaluronan storm. LMW-HA derived from excess HA production stimulates the production
  of PAI-1 (9), and PAI-1 indirectly activates STAT3 (10) leading to coagulopathy.
  Danger signals, such as UDP-glucose, activate the innate immune responses and the
  formation of NETS (NETosis), thus exacerbating the coagulopathy. Glutamine deficiency
  during the infection leads to immunosuppression through the increase in the populations
  of systemic TI-Tregs (tumor-infiltrating-like Tregs) (11) and MDSCs (12). TI-Tregs
  are increased by the over-production of HMW-HA. Details of these events are described
  in the main text.
