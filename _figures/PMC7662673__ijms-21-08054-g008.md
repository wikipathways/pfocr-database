caption: A suggested mechanism by which nonanal induces the growth factors expression
  in DPCs via the cAMP signaling pathway. As shown in a schematic illustration, stimulation
  of the cAMP signaling pathway in response to nonanal increases levels of growth
  factors such as VEGF, KGF, and IGF-1. The detailed molecular mechanism by which
  cAMP-mediated growth factor secretion increases needs further investigation. Interestingly,
  β -catenin and LEF1 levels did not increase in response to nonanal treatment.
