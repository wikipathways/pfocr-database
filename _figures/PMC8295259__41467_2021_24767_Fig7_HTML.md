caption: 'MCLA-145 is shown binding to PD-L1 expressed on a tumor cell or APC (depicted
  in pink) and CD137 expressed on a T effector cell (depicted in green). Engagement
  of MCLA-145 results in clustering of CD137 molecules on the surface of the effector
  T cell and downstream activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway. In addition, engagement
  of PD-L1 by MCLA-145 blocks interaction with its receptor PD-1 reversing PD-1 dependent
  suppression of downstream signaling from the T cell receptor complex. The net effect
  of MCLA-145 binding in trans to tumor cell/APC and T effector cells is shown: upregulation
  of CD137 (on T cells) and PD-L1 (on tumor cells and APCs), the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines from effector T cells resulting in T cell differentiation and expansion
  and activation of effector T cells to promote cytotoxic attack of tumor cells.'
