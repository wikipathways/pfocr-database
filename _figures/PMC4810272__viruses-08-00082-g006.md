caption: 'Mechanisms of 3Cpro from different picornaviruses suppress the immune response.
  It has been demonstrated that 3Cpro interferes with the host type I interferon (IFN)
  response and nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway by cleaving
  several essential proteins. However, the mechanisms adopted by picornaviruses are
  slightly different. The immune response is depicted in black. Inhibition of immune
  response by viral proteinases is highlighted in red. Abbreviations include: MDA5:
  melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5; RIG-I: retinoic acid-inducible gene
  I; MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; TRIF: TIR domain-containing
  adapter inducing interferon-β; TLR3: toll-like receptor 3; TRAF: TNF receptor associated
  factor; NEMO: NF-κB essential modulator; IKK: IκB kinase; IRF: interferon regulatory
  factor; Tyk: tyrosine kinase; JAK1: janus kinase 1; STATs: signal transducers and
  activators of transcription; KPNA1: karyopherin α1.'
