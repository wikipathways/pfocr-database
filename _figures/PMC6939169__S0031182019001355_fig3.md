caption: 'Schematic representation of the major parasite–macrophage interactions mediated
  by surface glycans in Leishmania. The major glycoconjugates involved in the parasite–macrophage
  interplay are indicated: PPG, GPI-anchored LPG GIPLs and the metalloprotease GP63.
  After infection, promastigote LPG triggers TLR signalling and interferes with pro-inflammatory
  and signalling pathways. Once inside the macrophage, LPG delays the fusion of the
  parasitophorous vacuole with lysosomes and inhibits protein kinase C and therefore,
  the production of cytokines and the oxidative and nitrosative stress response. Likewise,
  mannose-terminating GIPLs interact with mannose receptors on the macrophage surface
  and inhibit PKC activity. sPPGs impair important macrophage functions such as the
  release of TNF-α. Finally, GP63 is an important virulence factor which, among other
  functions, promotes Leishmania internalization and facilitates escape from lysis
  by the complement pathway.'
