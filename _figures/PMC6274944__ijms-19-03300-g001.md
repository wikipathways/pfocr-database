caption: Schematic representation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components implicated
  in the regulation of c-MET signaling. (a) Extracellular proteases (e.g., HGFA, matriptase
  and MMP-2) are able to cleave and convert pro-hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (single-chain
  inactive precursor) into its biologically active form. (b) Besides, some proteases
  (e.g., MMP-1, ADAM-17 and ADAMTS-1) mediate the shedding of EGFR ligands from the
  cell membrane; the activated EGFR can interact with c-MET (crosstalk), resulting
  in the latter’s ligand-free activation. (c) Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans
  (e.g., CD44 and syndecan-1) bind to HGF and act as co-receptors and presenters for
  c-MET. (d) Glycoproteins (e.g., laminin and fibronectin) promote the association
  of integrins with c-MET, leading not only to ligand-free activation of c-MET but
  also to amplification of signaling by both receptors. (e) In contrast, some proteoglycans
  (e.g., heparin) can directly bind to HGF and prevent its interaction with c-MET.
  (f) Matricellular proteins (e.g., TSP-1) are another ECM components capable of sequestering
  HGF. (g) Also, specific proteases (e.g., ADAMTS-1) can sequester or degrade HGF,
  preventing the activation of HGF/c-MET signaling pathway.
