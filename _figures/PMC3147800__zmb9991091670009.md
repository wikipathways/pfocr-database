caption: Model showing the cooperative function of LMO7 and Rho in the activation
  of MRTFs. The cell-specific expression of LMO7 potentiates the Rho-dependent activation
  of MRTFs by relieving actin-mediated inhibition. We propose a stepwise model for
  the activation of MRTFs. Rho is required at an initial rate-limiting step to convert
  inactive MRTF into a partially activated form, represented by the loss of a G-actin
  molecule from the RPEL domains. This step is insensitive to a reduced G-actin/F-actin
  ratio. After this initial step, Rho and LMO7 can synergistically reduce the G-actin/F-actin
  ratio to facilitate the complete activation of the partially activated MRTF. Whereas
  a reduced G-actin/F-actin ratio alone is insufficient to drive the initial activation
  step, it may play a role in conjunction with a Rho-dependent activity in promoting
  the initial step. See the text for details.
