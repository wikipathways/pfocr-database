caption: Moderate, but not excessive, alcohol consumption causes activation of intracellular
  signalling cascades that lead to the expression of genes encoding growth factors
  or neuropeptides. These signalling molecules have a protective role by promoting
  downstream cascades that prevent the dominance of the go pathway and the establishment
  of detrimental behavioural phenotypes. Moderate intake of alcohol increases the
  levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA. Binding of BDNF to tropomyosin-related
  kinase B (TRKB) activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)
  signalling, thus promoting the expression of Drd3 (which encodes the dopamine D3
  receptor) and Pdyn (which encodes preprodynorphin). Similarly, binding of glial
  cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to its receptors RET and GDNF family
  receptor α1 (GFRα1) results in the activation of ERK1/2 and the induction of the
  transcription of Gdnf. Activated protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates the transcription
  factor cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB). PKA-mediated phosphorylation
  of CREB results in the activation of the transcription machinery and in the induction
  of expression of genes, including neuropeptide Y (Npy). Activity of PKA is terminated
  by 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE), which hydrolyses cAMP to 5′
  AMP. Alcohol-induced inhibition of PDE activity enables the sustained activation
  of PKA. Activity of HRAS and KRAS is terminated by GTPase-activating proteins, including
  neurofibromin (NF1). Circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput (CLOCK) drives
  the transcription of Per1 and Per2, which encode the period proteins. PER1 and PER2
  suppress the transcription of Clock. The casein-kinases Iε and Iδ (CKIε/δ) phosphorylate
  PER1 and PER2, leading to the proteasomal degradation of these proteins. AC, adenylyl
  cyclase; MKK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1.
