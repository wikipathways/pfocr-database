caption: ER stress-mediated autophagy and the possible mechanisms. ER stress can induce
  autophagy through the IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6 signaling pathways. IRE1 forms a complex
  with TRAF-2, which subsequently binds to ASK1, leading to the phosphorylation of
  JNK and the promotion of Bcl-2 activation, thereby activating autophagy. sXBP1 also
  triggers transcriptional activation of Beclin-1. The activated PERK induces autophagy
  through ATF4-driven transcriptional regulation of Atg12, whereas ATF4-mediated CHOP
  activation transcriptionally induces Atg5 expression. Atg5, Atg12, and Atg16L form
  the Atg5-Atg12-Atg16L complex, which is involved in the elongation process. ATF6
  indirectly regulates autophagy through CHOP; it upregulates the expression of DAPK1,
  which phosphorylates Beclin-1 and mediates autophagy initiation. ER-phagy is initiated
  to remove damaged ER organelles. ER-phagy receptors on the ER membrane mediate the
  interaction between LC3 and its target ER sites through the LC3-interacting region
  (LIR)
