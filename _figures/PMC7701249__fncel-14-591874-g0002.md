caption: The iron metabolism-related pathway in ferroptosis. In the plasma, Fe(III)
  combined with TF to form TBI, which bound to TfR1 internalized by endocytosis. Iron
  is liberated from TF and reduced to Fe(II) in the endosome, which was transported
  into the cytosol by ZIP14/8 and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) interacted by
  PCBP2. NCOA4 can directly deliver ferritin to the autophagosome, and it is degraded
  to Fe(III) for heme synthesis. Heme is degraded to Fe(II) by HO-1, which is transported
  out of the cell by Fpn. The expression of HO-1 can be upregulated by oxidative stress
  through the p62-Keap1-NRF2 pathway, thereby inducing ferroptosis. TF, transferrin;
