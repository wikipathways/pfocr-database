caption: The reconstruction signaling and regulatory network of gp120 at apoptosis
  pathway at the early stage. Schema of the gp120 protein regulated pathway in influenza-infected
  cells. The genes highlighted in blue are the genes related to “glycoprotein gp120”
  from the enrichment gene analysis. The remaining genes were identified through network
  analysis (PATHWAY studio).
