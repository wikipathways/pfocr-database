caption: Model for the dynamic interactions between β-catenin and Mitf transcriptional
  activity. Mitf plays a key role at different stages of melanoblast and melanocyte
  development, probably by regulating different sets of target genes. To achieve this
  diversity, the activity of Mitf as a transcriptional activator is modulated either
  by regulating its protein level or by its engagement in changing and dynamic interactions
  with other factors in a highly regulated and promoter-specific manner. Moreover,
  signaling through the canonical Wnt signaling pathway provides several levels of
  regulation. Signaling through β-catenin activates Mitf expression. Depending on
  the protein levels of Mitf, Mitf can interact and cooperate either with Lef1 or
  β-catenin alone or in a complex with both to activate downstream targets.
