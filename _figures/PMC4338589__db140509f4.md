caption: 'MetScape network for valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation pathway.
  A: The metabolites are shown as pink hexagons. The metabolites that were experimentally
  measured by Wang et al. () are shown in red. Green border shows significant metabolites.
  Gene expression data from Mootha et al. () were superimposed on the metabolic network.
  Gene nodes are blue; the size of the node represents the direction of the change.
  Dark blue color is reserved for genes from enriched pathways. Gray nodes represent
  the reactions, and green nodes are enzymes. B: A zoomed in view of the same network,
  where MetDisease was used to annotate the metabolites with MeSH disease terms. The
  lower part of the figure shows the portion of MeSH tree. When diabetes mellitus
  is selected, the related metabolites (in this case valine) are selected. Additional
  information can be obtained by right-clicking on metabolite node. The insert on
  the right shows the list of publications that support the connection between the
  metabolite and the MeSH term.'
