caption: Cellular and molecular regulation of osteoclastogenesis and the influence
  of wear debris. Osteoclast precursor cells (OCP) are recruited to the periprosthetic
  tissues and differentiate into functional osteoclasts (OC), which resorb bone by
  generation of a resorption pit into which enzymes such as Cathepsin K, tartrate-resistant
  acid phosphatase (TRAP), and carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) are secreted. Osteoclast
  maturation and activation is mediated by interaction of RANKL (which can also exist
  as a cell surface signaling molecule; not shown for clarity) with the OCP receptor
  RANK. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble decoy receptor for RANKL, inhibits this pathway,
  as does the T lymphocyte cytokine, interferon (IFN) gamma. Various other cell types,
  including macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts, can modulate this pathway via
  production of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines, and can also contribute
  directly to tissue destruction and/or formation through expression of proteases
  and collagens. Positive (+) and negative (−) effects of wear particles on key aspects
  of this complex regulatory system are shown, as are important steps where possible
  particles involvement has yet to be established (?)
