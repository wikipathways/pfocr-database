caption: Schematic of the circuits involved in the four phases of motor learning.
  (A) In the first phase, any random effort is driven by motivation and supported
  by convergent cortical, limbic, and dopaminergic signaling in the NAc, which then
  transfers this information to the SNc. (B) During the second phase (insightful behavior),
  the motor action is linked to a goal and through repetition, the SNc evaluates the
  appropriate way to perform the behavior, sending this information to the dorsal
  striatum, which integrates information from motor output, spatial cues from hippocampus,
  and value information from the amygdala. (C) The third phase requires optimization
  primarily through the engagement of the anterior cingulate gyrus and the DMS, which
  integrates inputs from motor cortex, cerebellum, and limbic structure to refine
  the motor action, and the involvement of DLS, for changes in strategies or high-demanding
  tasks. (D) During the fourth and final phases, the action becomes a habit. Activity
  in the DMS is reduced, and the DLS (particularly the direct pathway) remains engaged
  for performance. The TS is likely filtering irrelevant sensory stimuli to improve
  performance. M1, primary motor cortex; mPFC, medial prefrontal cortex; OFC, orbitofrontal
