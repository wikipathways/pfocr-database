caption: A) BRAFi + MEKi treatment blocks ERK1/2 signaling, inhibiting growth and
  survival of BRAF V600E melanoma cells. B) ERK1/2 pathway blockade results in activation
  of caspase-3. C) leading to the cleavage of GSDME. The N-terminal cleaved region
  translocates to the plasma membrane leading to pore formation. D) After BRAFi +
  MEKi-induced GSDME pore formation, HMGB1 and other DAMPs are released from the cell.
  E-G) Extracellular DAMPs lead to the activation of dendritic cells, which induce
  T cell proliferation and contribute to anti-tumor effects during BRAFi + MEKi treatment.
