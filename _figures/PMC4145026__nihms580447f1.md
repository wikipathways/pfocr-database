caption: The sirtuin SIRT1 silences the miR-134 promotor either by deacetylating the
  histones, which allows for formation of higher-order chromatin structure (shown),
  or by targeting acetyl groups on other unknown proteins. In the absence of SIRT1,
  miR-134 transcription increases (), and miR-134 suppresses translation of the transcription
  factor Creb by binding to seed sites in its 3’ UTR. Creb mediates the transcription
  of Bdnf and miR-132 (), both of which positively influence synaptic plasticity,
  memory, and dendritic spine structure. Several components of this pathway are influenced
  by aging or disease and might play important roles in age-associated memory loss.
