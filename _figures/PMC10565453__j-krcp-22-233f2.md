caption: Mitochondrial fusion involves three GTPases. (A) MFN1 and MFN2 bind to OMM.
  OMM then binds to two different mitochondria. OPA1 protein plays an important role
  in the fusion and remodeling of IMM and cristae. Mitochondrial fragmentation is
  a multistep process regulated by Drp1. First, mtDNA marks the site for endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) contact and contractile sites. Second, several outer membrane-anchoring
  proteins such as Fis1, Mff, MiD49, and MiD51 recruit Drp1 to participate in ER-mediated
  contraction. (B) In damaged or depolarized mitochondria, PINK1 aggregates on the
  OMM where PINK1 recruits and phosphorylates parkin and Ub for mitophagy initiation.
  Once activated, the PINK1-parkin signaling pathway results in poly-ubiquitination
  of the OMM protein, which subsequently recruits autophagy receptor proteins and
  links to LC3B to form mitophagosomes. In the Ub-independent receptor-mediated mitophagy
  pathway, the autophagy receptor protein directly connects OMM with LC3B. Various
  receptor proteins such as BNIP3 and FUNDC1 have been identified. (C) PGC1α is a
  key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC1α coactivates NRF1, NRF2, PPARα,
  PPARγ, and ERRs. NRF and ERR then induce transcription of TFAM, a direct transcription
  factor of the mitochondrial genome. AMPK promotes mitochondrial biosynthesis through
  PGC1α phosphorylation. NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 or cGMP acts as a positive
  regulator of PGC1α through deacetylation.AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; BNIP3,
