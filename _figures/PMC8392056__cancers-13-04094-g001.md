caption: 'Targeted therapy and oncogenic pathways in gastric cancer. Activation of
  ERK-AMP KINASE: ligand binding to a growth factor receptor activates the small GTP-binding
  RAS protein, which interacts with RAF protein kinase. RAF phosphorylates and activates
  MEK (MAP kinase or ERK kinase), which then activates ERK (extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase) by phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues. Activated ERK translocates
  into the nucleus where it phosphorylates the Elk-1 transcription. PI3K/AKT/MTOR
  Pathway: PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling constitutes an important pathway that consists
  of two steps: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream molecule serine/threonine
  protein kinase B (PKB; also known as AKT). The PI3/AKT/mTOR pathway is stimulated
  by RTK and cytokine receptor activation. Tyrosine residues are then phosphorylated
  and provide anchor sites for PI3K translocation to the membrane, thus participating
  in the transduction of various extracellular matrix molecules and cytokines, including
  mTOR, a serine/threonine protein kinase and a member of the PI3K-associated kinase
  protein family.'
