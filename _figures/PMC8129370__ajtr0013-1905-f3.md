caption: Important miRNAs associated with vascular endothelial cells and vascular
  smooth muscle cells. In vascular endothelial cells, miR-122 upregulates AMPK phosphorylation
  and inhibits the AMPK signaling pathway, thus reducing the production of vascular
  endothelial active substances. The high expression of miR-112 and ADAM17 leads to
  an increase in LDL. In vascular smooth muscle cells, miR-221 inhibits the transcription
  and translation of eNOS, resulting in a NO deficiency that fails to maintain the
  function of vascular endothelial cells. miR-448 inhibits the expression of the SIRT1
  gene, reducing the activity of FOXO3a and FOXO4 which damaging the function of vascular
  smooth muscle cells. miR-21 inhibits the apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells.
