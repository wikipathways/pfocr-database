caption: The bacterial sugar ADP-Hep, an intermediate in the LPS biosynthetic pathway,
  can be transported into host cells by a type III secretion system (T3SS, right)
  or via an unknown pathway (middle) from T3SS-negative bacteria. ADP-Hep can then
  interact with ALPK1 to trigger TIFA-mediated activation of NF-kB and inflammation.
  The pathway can also be triggered by the bacterial sugar HBP, which also can be
  transferred via an unknown mechanism into the host cells, whereupon it can be metabolized
  by NMNAT adenylyltransferase enzymes into ADP-Hep 7-P to trigger ALPK1, TIFA and
  subsequently NF-kB.
