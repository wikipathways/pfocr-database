caption: Nicotinamide, carnitine, resveratrol, and Sirtuins modulate tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle in mitochondria. Desferoxamine may trigger mitochondrial protein
  kinase A (PKA) activity and mitochondrial CREB-mediated transcription. The antioxidant
  and bioenergetic compounds creatine, β-hydroxybutyrate, and coenzyme Q10 can improve
  mitochondrial function by preventing 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced cytotoxicity,
  while cyclosporine A, FK 506, melatonine, and Dimebon influence mitochondrial membrane
  function and inhibit cytochrome c release and mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore (mtPTP)-induced cytotoxicity. Rosiglitazone promotes maintenance of mitochondrial
  Ca2+ activity. Specific estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) also affect the mitochondrial
  activity by modulating calcium fluxes and may activate transcription of mitochondrial
  genes by interacting with mitochondrial ERs. Cloquinol regulates the mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation pathway via demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase (CLK-1 gene
  product) that catalyzes the production of coenzyme Q. The reversible inhibitor of
  caspase activity reduces pro-apoptotic signaling in the mitochondria. In addition,
  compounds exhibiting a robust antioxidant effect lead to the improvement of mitochondrial
  oxidative metabolism, bioenergy production, and neuronal survival.
