caption: A schematic diagram of Pyroptosis pathways. Pyroptosis is initiated when
  DAMPs or PAMPs activate the inflammasomes. Activated inflammasomes can lead to the
  cleavage of caspase-1. The activated caspase-1 cleaves Gasdermin D (GSDMD), in turn
  to form the N-fragment of GSDMD and cell membrane pores, resulting in pyroptosis.
  Activated caspase-1 also promotes the maturation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18,
  which is also an important molecular event during the pyroptosis procession. When
  LPS binds to the precursor of caspase-4/5/11, it can also cause pyroptosis. The
  other way to activate pyroptosis is caspase-3/ Gasdermin E (GSDME). Caspase-3 can
  be activated by mitochondrial and death receptor pathway. The activated caspase-3
  then cleaves GSDME, to produce GSDME N-fragments, forming pores in the plasma membrane,
  causing cell swelling and pyroptosis. DAMPs, danger-associated molecular patterns;
  PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; IL-1β/IL-18, interleukin-1β/interleukin-18;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide.
