caption: Canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling in humans. Activation of the
  canonical NF-κB pathway is triggered by a broad range of proinflammatory cytokines
  such as TNFα or IL-1, bacterial pattern recognition molecules such as LPS, or antigen
  stimulation. Non-canonical signaling is triggered by TNF family receptors and their
  ligands, resulting in activation of NIK kinase activity. Both pathways cumulate
  in the activation of IKK (IκB-kinases) which phosphorylate inhibitory IκB binding
  partners for their poly-ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (canonical axis)
  or the processing of p100 into its active form (non-canonical axis). Resulting NF-κB
  dimers translocate to the nucleus. Depending on their assembly into activating hetero-
  or repressive homo-dimeric conformations, NF-κB signaling regulates the expression
  of hundreds of target genes. TNF(R), tumor necrosis factor (receptor); IL-1(R),
  interleukin-1 (receptor); LPS, lipopolysaccharide; BAFF(-R), B-cell activating factor
  (receptor); LTβ(R), lymphotoxin β (receptor); TLR, toll-like receptor; TCR/BCR,
  T-cell/B-cell receptor; NIK, NF-κB inducing kinase; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator;
  IKK, IκB kinase; IκB, Inhibitor of NF-κB; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells.
