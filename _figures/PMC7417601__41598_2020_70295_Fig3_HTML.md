caption: Structure of the ANN models. Each node represents an artificial neuron or
  unit. Ui, HUj and O are, respectively, the input unit, the hidden unit and the output
  unit of the different layers; wi and w’j are the weights associated with each connection
  of the network between the input and the hidden layer for the first, and between
  the hidden and the output layer for the second. Only weights for the first unit
  (associated with PGAM) of the layers are labelled. ∑ constitutes the weighted sum
  of the input and f constitutes the activation function applied in the unit.
