caption: 'PI3K/Akt activation in cancer cells and its role in different kind of immune
  cells. PI3K is activated by growth factor receptors and, through the phosphorylation
  of PIP2 in PIP3, activates AKT that, in turn, activates mTOR. The effects of this
  activation involve survival, proliferation, and cell differentiation. Description
  of the effect of PI3K/Akt pathway activation in the main compartment of the immune
  system (Created with BioRender.com: agreement number RH22NUG37V).'
