caption: Proposed model of 2-OHM-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS production
  and signaling pathway for senescence induction in arabidopsis. Melatonin is involved
  in defense responses against many biotic and abiotic stresses as well as in protein
  quality control, mediated by the MPK3/6 signaling pathway. Melatonin-induced genes
  included CpHSP70, GST1, PR1, BIP2, and ClpR1. Conversely, 2-OHM converted from melatonin
  by M2H induced ROS in an RBOHD/F-dependent manner, followed by the MPK3/6 signaling
  pathway, leading to the induction of many genes related to senescence signaling
  including ABI3, ABI4, ABI5, ERF1, and ERF4.
