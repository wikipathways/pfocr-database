caption: 'Metabolic flux distribution in the Central metabolism for three different
  stages of the cultivation. Carbon uptake is detailed in the box of the upper left
  corner in mmol/gDCWh and the fluxes are presented relative to this uptake. In each
  box between metabolites there are three numbers which correspond, from top to bottom,
  to the relative flux during batch, starvation and feeding phases. Depending on the
  time analyzed, the cell consumes Glucose (G), Citrate (C), Arabitol (A) or Ethanol
  (E). The biomass flux corresponds to the specific growth rate of the cell in h−1
  and the negative fluxes refer to a change in the reaction directionality. Nomenclature:
  G6P = Glucose 6 Phosphate, Ru5P = Ribulose 5 Phosphate, ABT = Arabitol, PPP = Non-oxidative
  phase of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, F6P = Fructose 6 Phosphate, G3P = Glyceraldehyde
  3 Phosphate, DHAP = Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate, Pyr = Pyruvate, OAA = Oxaloacetate,
  Acald = Acetaldehyde, EtOH = Ethanol, AcCoA = Acetyl Coenzyme A, Cit = Citrate,
  Icit = Isocitrate, αkg = Alpha-keto glutarate, Mal = Malate and L- glut = Glutamate'
