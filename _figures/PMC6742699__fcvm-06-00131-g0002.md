caption: Complement-platelet interactions that can facilitate an inflammatory response
  that favors atheroma formation. Selected interactions between complement and platelets,
  as described in the manuscript, are highlighted. (a,b) C3a and C5a bind to their
  cognate receptors to trigger release of factors from α-granules. P-selectin localizes
  to the platelet surface and is a receptor for leukocyte expressed PSGL-1 and for
  C3b, the latter which allows for initiation of the AP and amplification of C3a-triggered
  platelet activation. (c) Complement activation on the platelet surface is dampened
  by α-granule release of cofactors C4bBP, FH and C1-INH, and δ-granule release of
  the anti-complement, prothrombotic polyphosphate. Polyphosphate binds to FH and
  C1-INH, and downregulates complement activation via the CP and the terminal pathway.
  (d) By binding to C1qR, C1q also triggers α-granule release of P-selectin and chondroitin
  sulfate (CSA), the latter which enhances the C1q-C1qR interaction, initiating the
  CP but negatively regulates leukoctye recruitment by interfering with P-selectin-PSGL-1
  interactions. (e) Neutrophil-released properdin (P) stabilizes the convertases and
  is also a receptor for C3(H2O) which complexes with Bb to form the AP C3-convertase,
  and is a ligand for leukocyte-expressed CR3, thereby facilitating leukocyte cell
  migration to the site of inflammation. (f) C4a and C3 can activate platelets via
  distinct interactions with PAR1 and PAR4. (g) Activated platelets are also protected
  against complement-mediated destruction by granule release of negative regulators
  of complement, cell surface expressed CD46, CD55, and CD59. (h) Sublytic C5b-9 (sC5b-9)
  triggers platelet activation with release of VWF, P-selectin and inflammatory cytokines
  (e.g., IL1), the latter which further promotes inflammation. (i) Ficolins on the
  surface of activated platelets are receptors for MASPs which can trigger the LP.
  Release of the isomerase ERp57 modifies the ficolin to limit its functional capacity
  to trigger complement. C, complement activation pathways; AP, alternative pathway;
