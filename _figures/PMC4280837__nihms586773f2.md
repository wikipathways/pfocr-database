caption: In the event of cellular injury, a mitochondrion can signal cell death pathways
  for destruction of the whole cell. 1) Apoptosis (orange pathway) is initiated due
  to excessive Ca2+ and ROS levels. Bcl-2 is inhibited by BH3-only proteins, allowing
  Bax and Bak to interact, which induces MPTP opening for Ca2+ and cyto c release
  into the cytosol. These proapoptotic factors further propel the process until the
  cell collapses in an organized manner. 2) Necrosis (dark red pathway) results from
  ATP depletion and enhanced Ca2+ and ROS accrual. This leads to the loss of ΔΨ and
  eventual unplanned rupture of the cell.
