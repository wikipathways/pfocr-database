caption: The regulation of apoptosis by the BCL-2 family. The intrinsic pathway is
  initiated by cellular stress signals such as DNA damage and growth factor/cytokine
  withdrawal. These intrinsic signals lead to the transcriptional upregulation and/or
  activation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins such as BIM, BID, BAD, BMF, Noxa,
  and PUMA. These proteins are able to bind anti-apoptotic members of the family (e.g.,
  BCL-2, BCL-xL, and/or MCL-1) and inhibit their activity. In addition to binding
  and inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins, direct activator BH3-only proteins (e.g.,
  BID and BIM) also bind and activate the effector molecules BAK and BAX. Once activated,
  BAK and BAX homo-oligomerize and subsequently form pores in the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Pro-apoptotic
  proteins such as cytochrome c and SMAC/DIABLO are subsequently released from the
  intermembrane space into the cytosol. Cytochrome c forms a complex with APAF-1 and
  pro-caspase 9, whereas SMAC/DIABLO binds the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs),
  which normally bind and inhibit initiator as well as effector caspases. Both steps
  allow for the dimerization and activation of caspase 9, subsequent cleavage and
  activation of effector caspase 3, and the apoptotic phenotype. The extrinsic apoptotic
  pathway is activated by extracellular signals such as death ligands, including FASL/CD95L
  and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α. Binding of these ligands to their receptors (FAS
  and TNF receptor, respectively) causes receptor trimerization and subsequent recruitment
  of several factors that form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). The DISC
  activates initiator caspase 8, which subsequently activates effector caspase 3.
  Crosstalk can occur between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways following the DISC
  assembly. Activated caspase 8 is able to cleave and activate the pro-apoptotic BH3-only
  protein BID, leading to C8-BID, which can simultaneously initiate the intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway through effector molecule activation.
