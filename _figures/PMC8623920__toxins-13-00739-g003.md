caption: Schematic diagram of mammalian eye development. Eye development in vertebrates
  occurs in the neural ectoderm origin, surface ectoderm, and neural crest-derived
  periocular mesenchyme of embryonic cell. Mammalian eye development starts with formation
  of the wall of the forebrain on either side of the optic grooves. The optic grooves
  gradually deepen as the neural folds become elevated, and the neural tube is closed
  by surface ectoderm. The optic grooves extend to the near ectoderm to form early
  lens placode by thickening of the adjacent area. During the interaction of optic
  vesicles with the ectoderm, the generated lens placode invaginates to form the lens
  pit, and optic vesicles invaginate to form the double-layered optic cup. Lens vesicles
  are generated from the lens pit and are surrounded by the double-layered optic cup;
  finally, the generated lens vesicle becomes the fetal lens and mature lens after
  the development of primary lens fibers, secondary lens fibers, lens suture, and
  lens nucleus.
