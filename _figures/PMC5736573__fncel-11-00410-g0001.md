caption: Activation of the PERK UPR signaling under physiological and pathological
  ER stress conditions. Abnormally folded proteins within the ER are sensed by GRP78
  chaperone that in turn activates PERK pathway program. Under acute ER stress, the
  PERK kinase activates downstream mediator, phosphorylated eIF2a leading to up-regulation
  of ATF4. The latest together with CHOP protein activates transcription of ER stress
  chaperones that can regulate the transition from adaptation and neuronal cell survival
  via temporal translation inhibition leading to reestablishing of cellular homeostasis.
  After prolonged pathological ER stress, ATF4 can regulate the transition from adaptation/survival
  in neuronal cells to a pro-apoptotic phase via provoking aberrant autophagy signaling,
  translational program, and inflammatory response. Sustained malfunction of these
  cellular signaling may contribute to neuronal cells death through activation of
  apoptosis and leads to neurodegeneration seen in Parkinson disease, Alzheimer Disease,
  Huntington Diseases, Prion Disease and Retinal Degeneration.
