caption: This graphic is intended to illustrate the role of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
  pathway in irisin's protection against lung I/R-induced ferroptosis. Lung I/R results
  in an accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
  a decrease in antioxidation systems such as GPX4 and glutathione, implying a role
  for ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of LIRI. Irisin substantially decreased ferroptosis,
  relieved LIRI, and enhanced mitochondrial function by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
  axis. Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a ferroptosis inhibitor, and Fe-citrate (Fe), a ferroptosis
  inducer, may attenuate or accelerate ferroptosis in lung I/R injury, respectively.
