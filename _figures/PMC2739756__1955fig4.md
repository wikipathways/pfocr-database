caption: FXR-independent and bile acid-activated cell signaling pathways in regulation
  of CYP7A1 transcription. 1) LCA activates PXR, CAR (indirectly), and VDR, which
  inhibit CYP7A1 transcription by interacting with HNF4α and blocking PGC-1α activation
  of HNF4α. 2) Bile acids stimulate inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1β in Kupffer
  cells, which activate the TNF receptor and the MAPK/JNK pathways to inhibit CYP7A1
  transcription. 3) TGFβ1 secreted from the HSC cells activates TGFβ1 receptor and
  the MAPK/Smad pathway. Smad3 interacts with HNF4α and recruitment of HDAC and mSin3A
  to inhibit CYP7A1 transcription. 4) Bile acids and TGFβ1 induce reactive oxidizing
  species (ROS) and activate p53, which interacts with HNF4α and inhibits HNF4α transactivation
  of CYP7A1. 5) Bile acids also activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
  the Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway to inhibit CYP7A1. 6) Bile acids enhance the
  insulin receptor signaling to phosphorylate and activate insulin receptor substrate,
  PI3K and AKT, which phosphorylates FoxO1 and inhibits CYP7A1. 7) Bile acids also
  activate protein kinase C, which phosphorylates cJun to inhibit CYP7A1. 8) During
  liver injury and regeneration, HGF secreted from HSC cells activates the HGF receptor
  cMet and the MAPK pathways to inhibit CYP7A1. All these signaling pathways may converge
  to regulate chromatin structure by the epigenetic mechanism.
