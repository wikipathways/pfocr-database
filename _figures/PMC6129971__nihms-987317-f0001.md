caption: Pathways of one-carbon metabolism. Folate cofactors are used in the distribution
  of one-carbon units across two distinct metabolic cycles, one relating to the de
  novo synthesis of DNA and the other involved in providing methyl groups for at least
  40 different methyltransferase reactions. In the DNA synthesis cycle, formyl derivatives
  of tetrahydrofolate (THF) are used in de novo purine biosynthesis. In de novo pyrimidine
  biosynthesis, 5,10-methyleneTHF is required in the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate
  (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). Thus folate cofactors play an essential
  role in cellular proliferation. The THF cofactor pool also provides a continuous
  supply of methyl groups for biologic methylation reactions via the conversion of
  homocysteine to methionine, using 5-methylTHF as the methyl donor, with vitamin
  B12-dependent methionine synthase (MS) transferring the methyl group to homocysteine.
  (In liver and kidney homocysteine is also remethylated to methionine through an
  alternative folate-independent pathway involving betaine homocysteine methyltransferase.)
  Methionine is then converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the cosubstrate of all
  methyltransferase enzymes. This cycle is completed by the regeneration of homocysteine
  from S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the coproduct of the methylation process. Methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the irreversible conversion of 5,10-methyleneTHF to
  5-methylTHF, thereby committing one-carbon units to methylation reactions and away
  from DNA synthesis. Mitochondrial and cytosolic folate-linked metabolism of serine
  and formate generate the majority of one-carbon groups for all of these processes.
  In addition to all of the enzymes involved in folate pathways, the reduced folate
  carrier (RFC), folate receptors (FRs), proton coupled folate transporter (PCFT),
  and mitochondrial folate transporter (MFT) play key roles in maintaining folate
  concentrations within the cell.
