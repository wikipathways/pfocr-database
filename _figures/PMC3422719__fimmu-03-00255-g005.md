caption: Mechanism of antigen-targeting by cytokine-NAg vaccines. The following sequence
  of events is postulated to mediate the conditioning and targeting activities of
  cytokine-NAg vaccines. First, the cytokine domain of the vaccine binds to APC subsets
  that bear the respective cytokine receptor. Engagement of the cytokine receptor
  on the APC triggers a shift from costimulatory activity to a counter-regulatory
  or tolerogenic co-inhibitory activity. Engagement of the cytokine receptor also
  targets the covalently attached NAg domain to the APC. Ingestion of cytokine receptor/vaccine
  complexes into the endosomal compartment introduces the NAg domain in high concentrations
  to the MHCII-antigen processing pathway. Processing of the vaccine liberates the
  NAg domain for loading onto nascent MHCII glycoproteins. By this mechanism, APC
  that are conditioned by the cytokine domain in turn present high concentrations
  of NAg domain on MHCII glycoproteins. Tolerogenic presentation of the NAg is postulated
  to induce regulatory elements and blunt the encephalitogenic immune response.
