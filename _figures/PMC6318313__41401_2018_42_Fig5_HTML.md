caption: Effects of mitochondrial oxidative stress on endothelial function. During
  diabetes, there is an increase in mitochondrial oxidative stress, which causes mitochondrial
  DNA damage. This activates the PARP-1 pathway in the nucleus of endothelial cells,
  which has been implicated in response to DNA injury. Activation of PARP-1 has been
  shown to inhibit Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a key enzyme
  involved in glycolysis. This inhibition causes the buildup of glycolytic intermediates,
  which get shunted into the polyol pathway, the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway,
  or the glycation pathway. These pathways all contribute to endothelial dysfunction.
  Blue color represents nucleus and green represents the mitochondria
