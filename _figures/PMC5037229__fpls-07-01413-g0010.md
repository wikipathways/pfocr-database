caption: Simplified model of OsMLO mediating stress-response pathways. Model includes
  7 OsMLO genes that respond to different experimental conditions, plus OsCML genes
  in downstream signaling pathway of OsMLO family genes and potential responsive genes
  in signaling pathways. OsHsfA4d/Spl7 and OscFBP1/MOC2 were presented as downstream
  factors of OsMLO3 and OsMLO8, respectively. Solid arrows show relationships analyzed
  in this study; dashed arrows indicate unclear relationships. Individual MLO pathway
  was indicated by different color.
