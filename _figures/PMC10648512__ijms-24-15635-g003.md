caption: Effect of exosomes derived from glioma stem cells and containing miR-26a
  on the BBB. Increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in exosomes
  derived from glioma stem cells (GSC) pre-transfected with miR-26a led to further
  VEGF upregulation in human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) after uptake.
  miR-26a targets the tumor suppressor PTEN and reduces its expression; the result
  of this regulation is the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to stimulate
  angiogenesis and proliferation of HBMEC. The figure was created with BioRender.
