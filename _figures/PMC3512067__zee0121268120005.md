caption: Model illustrating how nicotine plus a HFD could exacerbate HFD-induced hepatic
  steatosis in obese mice. Nicotine plus a HFD promotes abdominal lipolysis, resulting
  in FFA release from adipose tissue into the circulation, thereby contributing to
  the buildup of lipids as triglyceride (TG) in the liver. In addition, nicotine plus
  a HFD may also promote de novo lipogenesis through inactivation of AMPK and activation
  of its downstream target ACC, leading to the development of hepatic steatosis. Inactivation
  of AMPK can also stimulate lipogenesis through up-regulation of key genes in the
  lipogenic pathway such as fatty acid synthase (FAS) and ACC by activating the transcription
  factor sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Intrahepatic lipid
  accumulation can also trigger hepatocellular apoptosis through generation of oxidative
  stress coupled with activation of JNK-mediated apoptotic signaling. AMPK inactivation
  could further sensitize liver cells to nicotine plus HFD-induced apoptosis.
