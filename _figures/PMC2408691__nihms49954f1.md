caption: Hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) metabolism. SAMe biosynthesis, catalyzed
  by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), is the first step in methionine catabolism.
  SAMe is the link to three key metabolic pathways – polyamine synthesis, transmethylation
  and transsulfuration. In polyamine synthesis, SAMe is decarboxylated and the remaining
  propylamino moiety attached to its sulfonium ion is donated to putrescine and spermidine.
  Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is a by-product in this pathway. In transmethylation,
  SAMe donates its methyl group to a large variety of acceptor molecules in reactions
  catalyzed by methyltransferases (MT). SAMe is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH) during transmethylation and SAH is a potent inhibitor of all transmethylation
  reactions. SAH is hydrolyzed to form homocysteine (Hcy) and adenosine through a
  reversible reaction catalyzed by SAH hydrolase, whose thermodynamics favors biosynthesis
  rather than hydrolysis. In vivo, this reaction proceeds as hydrolysis because the
  products Hcy and adenosine are promptly removed. Hcy can be remethylated to form
  methionine via methionine synthase (MS), which requires folate and vitamin B12 and
  betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, which requires betaine. Remethylation of
  homocysteine via MS requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), which is derived
  from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) in a reaction catalyzed by methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR). 5-MTHF is then converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF) as it donates
  its methyl group and THF is converted to 5,10-MTHF, which is important for thymidylate
  and purine synthesis. Hcy can also become converted to cysteine, the rate-limiting
  precursor for glutathione (GSH), via the trans-sulfuration pathway via a two-step
  enzymatic process catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionase,
  both requiring vitamin B6.
