caption: The beneficial and detrimental sides of 8-oxoG on the genome and gene expression.
  (A). Oxidative stress molecules can change nucleotides by adding oxygen to the molecular
  structure, such as turning guanine into 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). This can occur to
  free nucleotides, which later intercalate into DNA, or via direct attack of guanosine
  in DNA. 8-oxoG can easily pair with cytosine, which is indistinguishable from a
  normal guanine-cytosine pairing. 8-oxo prefers to pair with cytosine, but sterically
  can form a Hoogsteen base pair with adenine. An 8-oxoG-adenine mispairing is unstable,
  with adenine preferring to pair with thymine. (B). The presence of 8-oxoG can indirectly
  promote the demethylation of nearby methylated cytosine (5-mC), via OGG1. OGG1 is
  the glycosylase in charge of removing 8-oxoG from DNA, but can also partner with
  TET1, and enhance its enzymatic activity as promoting 5-mC demethylation into forms
  such as 5-hmC which can promote gene expression changes via epigenetic mechanisms.
  (C). In a well-regulated system, the presence of 8-oxoG in the genome is efficiently
  removed from the DNA via the Base Excision Repair pathway. Once 8-oxoG is excised
  from the DNA, molecules such as APE1 continue to fix the resulting AP site by nicking
  the phosphate backbone and initiating polymerase-based repair. Thus, the genome
  is protected from permanent somatic mutational damage. 8-oxoG in such a robust repair
  environment is limited to having a temporary presence in DNA, which can potentially
  promote brief changes in OGG1- > TET methylation changes and activation in gene
  promoters. This can promote the gene expression changes found to be essential in
  many neurodevelopmental events, such as gross brain development, neuron maturation,
  circuit development, and synaptic function. It should be noted that in addition
  to BER, the NER proteins, can play a role in clearing 8-oxoG using glycosylase enzymes
  like OGG1 (). (D). In a cellular environment with excess oxidative stress, increased
  8-oxoG can overwhelm repair machinery. The longer perdurance of 8-oxoG can lead
  to a greater chance at mispairing with adenine at a rate of ∼30%. This 8-oxoG-adenine
  lesion can result in the establishment of a permanent somatic mutation in the DNA.
  This genotoxic mutational damage can accumulate over time and lead to detrimental
  changes in the brain. An excess of 8-oxoG can potentially also affect OGG1 and TET-mediated
  cytosine methylation/demethylation balance, which results in dysregulated gene expression.
  Dysregulated gene expression in concert with accumulating somatic mutations to the
  genome is associated with age-related changes to the brain, including neuronal function
  and neurodegenerative disease.
