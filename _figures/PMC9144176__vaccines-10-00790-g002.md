caption: Wnt signaling involves macropinocytosis, V-ATPase, MVBs, membrane trafficking,
  and lysosomes. Sequestration of GSK3 is a vital step in the activation of the canonical
  Wnt pathway. When the Wnt ligands bind to the Fz receptor and the Lrp6 co-receptors
  (Step 1 in yellow), GSK3 is translocated into the membrane. It is then internalized
  into an early endosome and subsequently into MVBs (Step 2). The sequestration of
  GSK3 and the destruction complex activate the Wnt pathway (Step 3). Lysosomal activity
  is critical for dorsal development. Mimicking Wnt signaling with LiCl can dorsalize
  embryos, an effect that is even more pronounced with LiCl plus HCQ. Inhibiting lysosomal
  activity with BafA1 or Concanamycin A or interfering with the MVB formation with
  VPS4-EQ or HRS-MO ventralizes embryos. Wnt and cell adhesion are often active in
  the same processes and crosstalk between them exists by reciprocal regulation and
  sharing of components. Knowing how Wnt signaling and cell adhesion cooperate will
  improve our understanding of embryonic development decisions and carcinomas. Diagram
