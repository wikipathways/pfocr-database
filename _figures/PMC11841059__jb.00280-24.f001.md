caption: Model of the NmpRSTU multi-component signaling pathway. The presence of oxygen
  is sensed by the SK NmpU. During high oxygen conditions, NmpU phosphorylates NmpT,
  a likely phosphosink protein. NmpU also phosphorylates the hybrid SK, NmpS. When
  NmpS is phosphorylated, the remaining portion of the pathway is “OFF.” When oxygen
  is limiting, NmpU switches to an “OFF” state, NmpS is no longer phosphorylated,
  and NmpS phosphorylates NmpR. We have previously shown that NmpR binds to the promoter
  region of pilR and mxan_4236, and in this study identified previously unknown genes
  regulated by NmpR. The depiction of this model is modified from reference (30)
