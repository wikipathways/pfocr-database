caption: Different bacterial species employ both shared and unique intrinsic mechanisms
  to destroy cancer. a. Salmonella. (1) Uncontrolled bacterial multiplication can
  lead to bursting of the invaded tumor cells. Intracellular bacteria may also kill
  tumor cells by inducing apoptosis or autophagy-. (2) Macrophages and dendritic cells
  in Salmonella-colonized tumors secrete IL-1β responsible for the antitumor activity.
  The elevated IL-1β secretion requires both LPS-induced TLR4 signaling and inflammasome
  activation in macrophage following phagocytosis of Salmonella-damaged tumor cells.
  (3) LPS elicits TNFα expression through CD14, TLR4 and MyD88,, (4) leading to disruption
  of the tumor vasculature. (5) Flagellin induces an NK cell-mediated antitumor response
  dependent on perforin, as well as (6) release of IFNγ, a critical cytokine for both
  innate and adaptive immunity, from NK cells through a TLR-independent pathway involving
  IL-18 and Myd88. (7) Flagellin also enhances a TLR5 and CD8+ T cell-dependent antitumor
  response in a peptide vaccine-based immunotherapeutic setting, and (8) decreases
  frequency of CD4+CD25+regulatory T cells (Treg). (9) In addition, flagellin can
  directly suppress tumor cell proliferation through TLR5 signaling. (10) Salmonella
  induces upregulation of connexin 43 (Cx43),, , leading to gap junction formation
  between tumor cells and dendritic cells (DC), which promotes transfer and cross-presentation
  of processed tumor antigenic peptides. (11) Upregulation of Cx43 in tumor cells
  also reduces expression of the immunosuppressive indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).
  (12) Both tumor antigen cross-presentation by DC and decreased IDO further activate
  CD8+ T cells. b. Listeria. (13) Listeria can directly kill tumor cells through the
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase)-mediated production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular calcium mobilization. (14) The
  immunogenic tumor cell death caused by high levels of ROS activates CD8+ T cells
  responsible for eliminating both primary tumors and metastases,. (15) Listeria infects
  the immunosuppressive MDSC and alters a subpopulation of these cells into an immune-stimulating
  phenotype characterized by elevated production of IL-12, which is correlated with
  improved CD8+ T cell and NK cell responses. (16) Listeria vaccine strains also inhibits
  MDSC and Treg,. c. Clostridia. (17) Direct tumor destruction is caused by a variety
  of exotoxins secreted by the colonizing clostridia, some of which (e.g. phospholipases,
  haemolysins, lipases) can damage membrane structures while others are internalized
  to interfere with critical cellular functions-. (18) Similar to infection by other
  bacterial species, the clostridial infection results in an initial accumulation
  of granulocytes and macrophages at the infection site ,. This first line of defense
  prevents the colonizing bacteria from invading into surrounding normal tissues as
  well as sufficiently perfused and oxygenized tumor regions,. (19) The cellular response
  results in elevated cytokines and chemokines that orchestrate a concerted immune
  response,. Clostridia can also trigger the release of TRAIL from neutrophils, killing
  cancer cells through activation of apoptosis. (20) At later time points, adaptive
  immune cells including CD8+ T lymphocytes are recruited to fight cancer.
