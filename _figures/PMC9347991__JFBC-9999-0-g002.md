caption: Melatonin inhibits oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation by boosting
  antioxidants via activation of SIRT1. Melatonin inhibits early virus replication
  or 3CLpro which aids in fighting against viral infection. Melatonin exerts its anti‐inflammatory
  properties by stimulating sirtuin proteins, inhibiting activation of TLR4, and reducing
  the levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines from hyperinflammatory macrophages through
  downregulation of NF‐kB signaling. SIRT1 in association with melatonin scavenges
  the production of ROS and RNS by increasing antioxidants and thereby reduces the
  damage produced by oxidative stress. Melatonin leads to the downregulation of inducible
  nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase‐2 which further decreases inflammation
  via. the NF‐kB signaling pathway. Sirtuins, an Nrf2 promoter, in the presence of
  melatonin inhibit the inflammasome NLRP3 activity, inhibiting pyroptosis and preventing
  airway inflammation. SIRT1 activates interferon‐stimulated genes (ISG), which activates
  nuclear HMGB1, resulting in the generation of the antiviral effect of melatonin.
