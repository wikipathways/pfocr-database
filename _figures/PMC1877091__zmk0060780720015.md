caption: PDCD10/MST4 signaling pathway and CCM protein function. The CCM1/2 complex
  may modulate integrin-mediated cell adhesion via association with ICAP1 in the cytoplasm,
  as well as organize a p38 MAPK signaling complex (). However, it has been reported
  that MST4 activated MEK-1/ERK via a Ras/Raf independent pathway (). These data,
  and ours, confirmed that PDCD10 (CCM3) interacted with MST4 and modulated the ERK
  MAPK cascade, but not P38 and JNK, resulting in growth induction and cellular transformation.
