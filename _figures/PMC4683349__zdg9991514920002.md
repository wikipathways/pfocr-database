caption: Working model of the cellular pathways contributing to long-lasting phrenic
  motor facilitation triggered by intermittent hypoxia. The highly simplified drawing
  depicts “respiratory drive” as a single axon terminal originating from the brainstem.
  Membrane proteins and intracellular pathways are depicted on a phrenic motoneuron.
  The Q pathway (left) is elicited by intermittent activation of Gq-coupled metabotropic
  receptors (e.g., 5-HT2 or α1), followed by activation of PKC, new synthesis of BDNF,
  activation of mature tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), and activation of ERK
  MAP kinases (pERK). The S pathway (right) is elicited by Gs-coupled metabotropic
  receptors (e.g., 5-HT7 and A2A), followed by activation of cAMP, new synthesis of
  an immature TrkB isoform, and downstream signaling via Akt phosphorylation/activation
  (pAkt). The specific mechanisms by which pERK (Q pathway) and pAkt (S pathway) elicit
  persistent increases in phrenic motor output are not known but are likely to involve
  changes in motoneuron excitability and/or synaptic strength. pLTF, phrenic long-term
  facilitation.
