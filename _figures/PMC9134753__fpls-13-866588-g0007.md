caption: Key metabolic and transcriptional regulatory networks involved in pollen
  cryopreservation in pitaya. Three key KEGG pathways are shown in the brown text
  box, including isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, tyrosine metabolism, alanine,
  aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Downstream pathways of which are shown in the
  yellow text box. Metabolites and genes annotated in these three key pathways, black
  arrows mean direct pathway between the metabolites, the gray ones are brief pathways
  between the metabolites because some metabolites along the pathway were not detected.
  The changing patterns of the metabolites and genes were set in different colors,
  namely, red means upregulation or increase, and green means downregulation or decrease.
  TCA, Tricarboxylic acid cycle.
