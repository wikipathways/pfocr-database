caption: Pathway analysis of flavonoid biosynthesis pathways in single-headed roots
  and double-headed roots. The proposed metabolic pathways are based on the Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database of metabolic pathways. The metabolites,
  written in circle, were detected in this study. Omitted metabolic processes are
  represented by dashed lines. The rectangle represent the genes. The red colors indicates
  upregulated expression and green colors indicates downregulated expression.
