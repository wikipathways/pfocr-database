caption: Schematic representation of the major oxylipin biosynthesis pathways, focused
  on the derivatives used in this work. Starting from linolenic acid (LNA), oxygenation
  can be carried out by 9-lipoxygenases (9-LOX, green), 13-lipoxygenases (13-LOX,
  red), α-dioxygenases (α-DOX, blue), or non-enzymatic reactions (gray). Lipoxygenases
  generate the hydroperoxides 9-HPOT and 13-HPOT, which are then reduced to hydroxyl-acids
  9-HOT and 13-HOT. These can be further oxidized to 9-KOT and 13-KOT (alternatively,
  lipoxygenases could directly generate keto-acids from hydroperoxides, which is not
  shown for simplicity). 13-HPOT can be fragmented by hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) to
  2-hexenal or committed to the jasmonate pathway by the sequential action of allene
  oxide synthase (AOS) and allene oxide cyclase (AOC) leading to 12-OPDA. The latter
  can be reduced and subjected to three β-oxidation cycles leading to jasmonic acid
  (JA). α-dioxygenases mainly yield 2-HOT in vivo, also through a hydroperoxide intermediate
  (2-HPOT). LNA can also react directly with singlet oxygen or hydroxyl radical. This
  pathway can lead to 9-HOT and 13-HOT (not shown), but also to oxylipins exclusively
  generated by non-enzymatic reactions (10-HOT, 12-HOT, 15-HOT and 16-HOT). α,β-unsaturated
  carbonyl (RES) or hydroxyl (RES precursor) moieties are highlighted in gray. For
  simplicity, stereochemistry details have been omitted (e.g., 13-LOX and 9-LOX yield
  S-enantiomers whereas non-enzymatic reactions produce racemic mixtures) as well
  as additional oxylipins generated by secondary enzymatic or non-enzymatic reactions.
