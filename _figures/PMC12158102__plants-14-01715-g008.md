caption: Analysis of plant hormone signal transduction pathways in F14 vs. M13. (a)
  A network diagram depicting the genes involved in various plant hormone signal transduction
  pathways, including auxin (AUX), cytokinin (CTK), gibberellin (GA), ethylene (ETH),
  brassinosteroid (BR), jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid
  (ABA). The LAX2 in the auxin signaling pathway, which was highly expressed in M13,
  is highlighted in red text. (b) Detailed illustration of the auxin signaling pathway.
  The heatmaps show the expression levels of auxin-related genes in F14 and M13, with
  notable upregulation of LAX2 in M13. The color scale represents the log2 (FC) in
  gene expression levels, with red indicating higher expression and yellow indicating
  lower expression. Gene expression values are derived from three independent biological
  replicates
