caption: In cervical cancer, several Wnt/β-catenin signaling antagonists including
  SOX17 revealed low expression because of hypermethylation. SOX17 could recognize
  and bind to the β-catenin promoter region as a transcription repressor and reduce
  the accumulation of nuclear β-catenin, leading to the down-regulation of target
  genes, such as cyclin D1 and c-myc. Consequently, the activity of Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway was attenuated, resulting in cancer cell proliferation and tumor
  formation inhibition in cervical cancer cells

  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via trans-suppressing β-catenin in cervical
  cancer.
