caption: Nutrient control of ribosomal gene expression. Ribosomal gene expression
  involves RNA polymerase (Pol) I for expression of rRNA, Pol II for expression of
  RPs and ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) factors, and Pol III for tRNA and small nuclear
  (5S) RNA. Different nutrient-sensing pathways are involved. Glucose sensing by Gpr1
  activates the cAMP-PKA pathway, which stimulates ribosome biogenesis through effects
  on the three polymerases. The presence of preferred nitrogen sources impinges on
  this pathway via TORC1 and its downstream kinase Sch9. Pol I-dependent expression
  is positively regulated via interaction of Rrn3 with Pol I. TORC1 stabilizes this
  interaction. Glucose may stimulate Pol I-dependent transcription through PKA control
  of the level of Rrn3. Pol II-dependent expression is positively regulated by Sfp1
  and Fhl1. Upon nutrient deprivation, the Crf1 inhibitor competes with the co-activator
  Ifh1 for binding to Fhl1, which causes inactivation of the latter. TORC1 prevents
  Crf1 nuclear shuttling, whereas Yak1 favors it. Sfp1 stimulates Pol II-dependent
  expression and is positively regulated by TorC1 via Sch9. Pol III-dependent expression
  is negatively regulated by Maf1. PKA phosphorylates Maf1, which prevents entrance
  of Maf1 into the nucleus and thus allows Pol III-directed gene expression.
