caption: PKM2 activity is controlled by a tight regulatory network at the transcriptional,
  proteomic and metabolic level. (a) Upon EGFR activation parallel signaling pathways
  initiate transcription of c-MYC and HIF1a. Since PKM2 is both, transcriptional target
  and transcriptional coactivator, parallel in combination with forward control initiates
  and amplifies the signal. (b) Post - translational modifications control the equilibrium
  between metabolically active tetramer (PKM2)4 and transcriptional active dimer (PKM2)2
  with protein kinase activity. In the nucleus PKM2 serves as coactivator of glycolytic
  genes including itself. This further amplifies the signal. (c) A network of feedback
  mechanisms provides a metabolic phenotype that is robust against perturbations.
  The combination of positive and negative feedback control guarantees stable flux
  through the glycolytic pathway with PKM2 as terminal master regulator. PKM2 transcript,
  protein tetramer, and metabolic activity are highlighted in blue. The gate keeping
  pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) reaction between cytosol and mitochondria is negatively
  regulated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and labeled in grey. Genes are
  displayed in Italic. Enzymes are abbreviated in uppercase as enolase (ENO), glucose
  transporter (GLUT), hexokinase (HK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutaminase (GLS),
  PDH, PDK, PKM2. Metabolites are abbreviated in lowercase as acetyl - CoA (aco),
  alanine (ala), adenosine triphosphate (atp), fructose - 1,6 - bisphosphatase (fbp),
  fructose - 6 - phosphatase (f6p), glucose - 6 - phosphate (g6p), lactate (lac),
  phosphoenol pyruvate (pep), 3 - phosphoglycerate (3pg), pyruvate (pyr), reactive
  oxygen species (ros), ribose - 5 - phosphate (r5p), succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide
  ribose - 5 - phosphate (saicar), serine (ser).
