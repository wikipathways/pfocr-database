caption: Homology-directed repair (HDR) and other pathways for the repair of double-strand
  breaks (DSBs). HDR, also termed homologous recombination, is a major pathway for
  the error-free repair of DSBs, which occurs primarily during S/G2 phases of the
  cell cycle. An early determinant of DSB repair pathway choice is DNA end resection—the
  processing of DNA ends to generate 3′ single strands. Whether end resection occurs
  is governed by BRCA1 in competition with the antagonistic protein 53BP1, and end
  resection can occur in two steps, an initial phase to result in short 3′ overhangs
  (<100 base pairs) and a more extensive phase to result in longer 3′ overhangs (hundreds
  of base pairs), as demonstrated in yeast. BRCA1 also promotes the later steps of
  HDR via interaction with the PALB2 protein, which in turn recruits BRCA2. The defining
  step of HDR, which is controlled by BRCA2, is the formation of RAD51 filaments on
  the 3′ single strands, followed by strand invasion into a homologous DNA, typically
  the sister chromatid, priming repair DNA synthesis. Most HDR is completed by a simple
  gene conversion, although other outcomes are possible (). DSBs can also be repaired
  by error-prone DNA repair pathways. Canonical nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) can
  occur during any cell cycle phase and is considered the other major DSB repair pathway.
  In NHEJ, DNA ends are protected from end resection but often undergo some processing
  before joining, which results in small deletions or insertions. Initial and extensive
  end resection also provides intermediates for two other DSB repair pathways, alternative
  NHEJ involving microhomology, also termed microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ),
  and single-strand annealing (SSA), involving longer stretches of homology. Consistent
  with their involvement in different steps of HDR, BRCA1 promotes HDR and SSA, whereas
  BRCA2 promotes HDR and suppresses SSA.
