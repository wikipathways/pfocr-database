caption: Overview of the tuberous sclerosis complex and mTOR pathway. Cellular stress,
  including ischemia, hypoxia, and low glucose, is sensed by AMP kinase (AMPK), which
  stimulates the TSC. This complex has an inhibitory effect on the protein Rheb, which
  in turn activates the mTorc1 complex. MTorc1 stimulates two proteins, S6K1 and 4E-BP1/2,
  which both, through different mechanisms, result in an increase in protein synthesis
