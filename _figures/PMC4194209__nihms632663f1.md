caption: 'Schematic of fear circuitry subserving unconditioned and conditioned fear
  derived from animal data. (A) Solid black arrows mark the processing path for an
  inherently aversive unconditioned stimulus (US: e.g., electric shock) which activates
  the input and output nodes of the amygdala, culminating in the behavioral, endocrine,
  and autonomic constituents of the fear response. (B) The light grey processing path
  subserves acquisition of conditioned fear, ensuing when a neutral conditioned stimulus
  (CS+) causes the release of glutamate in LA neurons in close temporal proximity
  to US-induced depolarization of these same neurons. The co-occurrence of this glutamate
  release and depolarization results in a cascade of intracellular processes in the
  La (release of Ca2+ which binds to NMDA receptors → excitation of protein kinases
  [e.g., MAPK] → activation of transcription factors [CREB] → synthesis of RNA and
  protein) which then makes new proteins used, in part, to increase the amygdala’s
  sensitivity to the CS+. (C) Broken arrows delineate extinction of conditioned fear,
  whereby repeated presentations of the CS+ in the absence of the US weakens the conditioned
  fear response. This weakening is thought to ensue when an mPFC-ITC mediated inhibition
  of the central nucleus of the amygdala outcompetes the excitatory pathway formed
  during acquisition. (D) Denoted by compound arrows is the processing path for discrimination
  of conditioned fear to a conditioned safety cue (CS-) with perceptual resemblance
  to the CS+. Sensory and affective discrimination of CS− from CS+ begins with higher
  order processing of CS− in the sensory cortex. Next the hippocampus may perform
  a schematic match between the cortical representation of the previously encountered
  CS+ and that of the currently presented CS−. With sufficient mismatch, the hippocampus
  initiates pattern separation resulting in activation of the mPFC, which then inhibits
  fear by activating a group of inhibitory, intercalated (ITC) neurons in the amygdala.
