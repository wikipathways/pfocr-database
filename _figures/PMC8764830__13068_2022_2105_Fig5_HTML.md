caption: Proposed acetone assimilation pathway in Methylomonas sp. DH-1. A Organization
  of related genes in the proposed acetone assimilation pathway on the chromosome
  of the methanotrophic Methylomonas sp. DH-1. B Particulate methane monooxygenase
  (pMMO; AYM39_RS18590, AYM39_RS18595, and AYM39_RS18600) co-expressed with novel
  PmoD (IT6_09410) of Methylacidiphilum sp. IT6 oxidizes acetone to acetol, which
  could be further oxidized to methylglyoxal by GMC oxidoreductase (AYM39_RS20165).
  Passive diffusion or active transportation via transporter protein (ABC transporter)
  may be responsible for the methylglyoxal transportation into the cytoplasm. Seven
  candidate genes (AYM39_RS20250, AYM39_RS03110, AYM39_RS04650, AYM39_RS09045, AYM39_RS14435,
  AYM39_RS16860, AYM39_RS21550) annotated as glyoxalase enzymes may convert methylglyoxal
  into S-lactoylglutathione, which can be further converted into lactate by hydroxyacylglutathione
  hydrolase (AYM39_RS06120) and then to pyruvate by putative lactate dehydrogenase
  (AYM39_RS04895, AYM39_RS13600). The generated pyruvate can be either converted to
  acetyl-CoA to enter the TCA cycle or to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by PEP-synthase
  (AYM39_RS13170). The related genes are shown using their locus tags obtained from
  the genome of Methylomonas sp. DH-1 (GenBank accession number NZ_CP014360). The
  related reactions of the proposed pathway are demonstrated by dashed arrows
