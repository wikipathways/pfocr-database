caption: The potential mechanisms of checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) in NSCLC
  patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy. The occurrence of checkpoint
  inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) in NSCLC is the result of a combination of many factors.
  Blockade of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway by PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs (PD-1 mAb in the figure, for
  example) will upregulate and promote Th1 and Th17 cells and downregulate and inhibit
  Th2 cells and Tregs. Without immunosuppression of Th2 cells and Tregs, excessive
  immune responses and cytokine secretion of Th1 and Th17 cells will cause autoimmune
  damage in normal tissues such as the lung. In addition, autoantibodies increased
  after PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can also cause normal tissue lesions. Proinflammatory
  cytokines secreted by activated T cells promote the infiltration of inflammatory
  cells. Under the stimulation of IL-6, CRP produced by the liver will promote inflammation
  and strengthen autoimmunity. Through the “gut-lung axis”, gut microbiomes can regulate
  the immune microenvironment in the lung. Overall, the immune dysregulation caused
  by PD-1/PD-L1 blockade leads to the occurrence and development of CIP. NSCLC, non-small
  cell cancer; CIP, checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis; PD-1, programmed cell death
  protein 1; PD-L1, programmed cell death protein ligand-1; mAbs, monoclonal antibody;
  Th, helper T cell; IL, Interleukin; CRP, C-reactive protein.
