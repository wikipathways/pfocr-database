caption: The synthesis and secretion of adiponectin. Adiponectin has a collagenous
  tail and a globular head that fold with the help of BiP. The head domains of 3 monomers
  interact with each other and form trimeric adiponectin. The intratrimeric disulfide
  bond formation is stimulated by ER chaperones, ERp44, Ero1-Lα, PDI, and potentially
  DsbA-L. An intertrimeric disulfide bond connects 2 trimers to form hexameric adiponectin.
  Either the trimer or the hexamer of adiponectin are the building block for HMW of
  18–36 monomers. Movement through the Golgi may involve GGA1. PPARγ has been shown
  to stimulate the expression of various chaperones and thus enhance the folding and
  secretion of adiponectin. In the secretory pathway, postulated PPARγ targets are
  shown in green, whereas confirmed PPARγ targets are shown in red. DsbA-L may play
  roles in multiple steps of adiponectin secretion.
