caption: Predicted Role of ANKHD1 in the p21 Signalling Pathway. A basic overview
  of the critical components of the p21 signalling pathway in mammals is shown. DNA
  damage activates p53, which in turn activates p21, resulting in the inhibition of
  PCNA and a range of cyclin CDK complexes. This inhibition leads to the arrest of
  the cell cycle and the arrest of proliferation to prevent the propagation of DNA
  damage to additional cells. However, when ANKHD1 binds to p21, it prevents the inhibition
  of PCNA and cyclin CDK complexes, allowing for cellular proliferation even in the
  presence of DNA damage
