caption: 'Schematic representation of the protein C pathway reactions, from left to
  right: protein C activation, the cytoprotective protein C pathway, the anticoagulant
  protein C pathway and the inactivation of APC by serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs).
  Protein C activation: physiologic activation of protein C (PC) by the thrombin (IIa)-thrombomodulin
  (TM) complex occurs on the surface of endothelial cell membranes when protein C
  is bound to the endothelial receptor (EPCR). Since protein C and APC have a similar
  affinity for EPCR, after activation APC can remain bound to EPCR to initiate cytoprotective
  signaling. The cytoprotective protein C pathway: APC’s direct effects of on endothelial
  cells require the cellular receptors EPCR and PAR1. These cellular activities of
  APC include anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities, alteration of gene
  expression profiles, and protection of endothelial barrier functions and are collectively
  referred to as APC’s cytoprotective activities. The anticoagulant protein C pathway:
  APC anticoagulant activities involve proteolytic cleavages of FVa and FVIIIa. Different
  protein cofactors, such as protein S (PS), FV, and various lipid cofactors (e.g.
  phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine cardiolipin, glucosylceramide, etc.),
  enhance the inactivation of FVa and FVIIIa by APC. APC inactivation: Inactivation
  of APC in plasma by serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs) is slow, which contributes
  to a remarkably long circulation half-life of APC (~ 20 min). Most important inhibitors
  of APC in plasma are protein C inhibitor (PCI), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
  (PAI-1), and α1-antitrypsin and, to a lesser extent, α2-macroglobulin and α2-antiplasmin.'
