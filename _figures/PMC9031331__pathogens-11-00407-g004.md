caption: Functional exploration of the miRNA-mRNA network. (A) The PPI network of
  the mRNAs/genes in the miRNA-mRNA network. (B) Visualization of the axon guidance
  (hsa04360) KEGG pathway. Three genes of the miRNA-mRNA network were shown in green
  font. Seven genes also in the PPI network were indicated in red box. (C) Venn diagram
  showing miRNAs which regulate the three genes participating in the axon guidance
  pathway.
