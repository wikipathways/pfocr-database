caption: The paradigm of host inflammation responses to Salmonella and its interaction
  with autophagy as well as ubiquitination. PAMPs from Salmonella are recognized by
  membrane-bound TLRs in the extracellular space and within endosomes. The recognition
  of TLRs activate NF-κB and interferon-regulatory factors pathway to produce pro-inflammatory
  cytokines responding to Salmonellae. SLRs and NLRs are PRRs in the cytosol detecting
  intracellular pathogens. SLRs not only enable autophagy to degrade bacteria but
  also act as an inflammatory signaling platform. The activation of inflammasomes,
  which consist of caspase-1, NLRs, etc., can affect the inflammation in cytosol directly.
  NLRP3 and NLRC4 can lead to processing of caspase-1 or caspase-11, followed by secretion
  of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 resulting in pyroptosis. NLRP6 and NLRP12 are also activated
  by Salmonella through unknown ligands that inhibiting NF-κB pathway.
