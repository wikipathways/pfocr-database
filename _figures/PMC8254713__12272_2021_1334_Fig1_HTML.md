caption: α-Synuclein oligomers and intraneural calcium dyshomeostasis play key roles
  in the pathophysiological mechanism of LBD. Genetic and environmental risk factors
  promote LBD pathology, including the production of α-synuclein (αSn) oligomers and
  the disturbance of Ca2+ homeostasis in LBD-vulnerable neurons, mutually strengthening
  the metabolic and proteostatic burden, and increasing the neuron-to-neuron propagation
  of αSn pathology and neuroinflammation. These pathophysiological alterations cause
  selective neuronal vulnerability and the spreading of LBD pathology. The metabolic
  and proteostatic burden includes mitochondrial dysfunction, the autophagy and lysosomal
  pathway and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), and ER stress. LBD-vulnerable
  neurons share the features underlying Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, such as being autonomous
  pacemaker neurons, having broad and slow spikes, and low levels of Ca2+ binding
  protein. Note that neurons that do not have such Ca2+-related properties, such as
  neocortical neurons, are also prone to damage in LBD patients with cognitive decline
