caption: Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway regulation in normal states and in
  PPGL development. In the normal state (left), HIF signaling is impaired by the PHD
  enzyme class mediated hydroxylation of HIF-α, in turn marking the latter protein
  for proteolysis via the actions of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor
  protein. If oxygen levels are reduced, HIF-α escapes hydroxylation and degradation,
  and initiates intra-nuclear target transcriptome programs, including those associated
  to angiogenesis. In PPGLs (right), activating EPAS1 (encoding HIF-2α) mutations
  (green star), inactivating VHL, PHD1/EGLN2 and PHD2/EGLN1 mutations (red stars)
  as well as aberrant TCA cycle regulation leading to inhibition of PHDs are main
  genetic events activating the HIF signaling cascade—even at normal oxygen levels
