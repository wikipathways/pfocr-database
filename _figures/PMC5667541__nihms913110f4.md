caption: a | Nutrient availability is thought to regulate cellular O-GlcNAcylation
  levels by controlling flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and
  thereby determining the abundance of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc).
  We propose that the effect of nutrient availability on O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)
  and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) expression, OGT-adaptor protein interaction, and high affinity
  OGT substrate (i.e. unfolded protein) accumulation also drives the nutrient sensitivity
  of this modification. HCF-1, host cell factor C1. b | In response to systemic changes
  in metabolic status (feeding, starvation, fasting), hormones (insulin, glucagon,
  ghrelin) modulate O-GlcNAc signalling in various cell types and tissues (liver,
  AgRP neurons), leading to regulation of specific cellular pathways (insulin signalling,
  autophagy, browning of WAT) that generate an appropriate metabolic response (suppression
  of anabolism, stimulation of gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis, activation of thermogenesis)
  to the initial stimulus. AgRP, Agouti-related peptide; WAT, white adipose tissue.
