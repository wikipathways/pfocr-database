caption: RSV and IAV single-stranded RNA and double-stranded RNA moieties generated
  during viral replication are detected by both endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLR)
  3 and TLR7/8, and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), resulting in
  activation of transcription factors interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 3, IRF7,
  and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,
  and interferons. RSV and IAV have also been shown to increase expression of cell
  surface TLR4 and TLR10 PRRs that lead to NF-κB induced transcription of pro-inflammatory
  cytokine genes. Both viruses are detected by NLRP3 NLRs and activate the inflammasome
  pathway and downstream expression of IRF3 and NF-κB dependent immune responses,
  as well as direct production of interleukin (IL)-1B and IL-18.
