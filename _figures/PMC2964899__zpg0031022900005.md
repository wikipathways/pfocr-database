caption: Cellular events and signaling elements involved in the regulation of SHH
  expression, GLI activation, and mediation of the Hh activation-induced cellular
  response. The increase of the SHH expression, which might be induced during tissue
  regeneration in homeostatic conditions, and after an adaptive response to tissue
  injury, ischemia and hypoxia, chronic inflammation, and cancer progression, is indicated.
  The potential cellular signaling elements involved in the regulation of the SHH
  expression are also indicated. These intracellular signaling components include
  NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, and K-RAS, which might be induced through the stimulation of different
  growth factor and cytokine signaling pathways in normal and cancer cells. The possibility
  of SHH-dependent and -independent activation of GLI1 and GLI2 transcriptional activators
  by different growth factor pathways is also indicated. In addition, the potential
  biological effects induced through stimulation of GLI protein-induced Hh target
  gene expression in normal and cancer cells are also indicated. ER-α, estrogen receptor
  α; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; RORα, retinoid-related orphan receptor
  α; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.
