caption: The IL10/IL10R signaling pathway. IL10 signals through heterotetrameric IL10R
  complex comprising of IL10Rα (IL10R1 in humans) and IL10Rβ (IL10R2 in humans). Binding
  of IL10 to its receptor leads to JAK1- and TYK2-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3.
  Following phosphorylation, STAT3 forms a homodimer and undergoes nuclear translocation
  where it binds to STAT3-binding elements of IL10-responsive genes and drives expression
  of anti-inflammatory mediators that block various inflammatory pathways. IL10-responsive
  gene products inhibit TLR4 signaling at the level of IRAK and TRAF6 resulting in
  reduced NF-κB-mediated expression of IL6, TNF, and IL1 and also inhibit IL6 signaling
  at the level of gp30 receptor subunit. MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response
  gene (88); TLR, toll-like receptor; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase;
  TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor.
