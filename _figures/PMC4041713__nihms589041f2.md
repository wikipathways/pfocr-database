caption: DIANA-mirPath was used to predict the most likely molecular pathways targeted
  by PCR-validated DE-miRNAs in sarcoidosis lung tissue and identified the TGFβ pathway
  as the most likely candidate. The arrows represent activation, whereas the hammerheads
  represent inhibition. The molecular components of the TGFβ signaling pathway and
  their putative interactions were derived from the KEGG pathway database.
