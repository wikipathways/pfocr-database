caption: 'Metabolic pathways analysis revealing differentially altered pathways due
  to PGPR treatment. (A) A metabolome view indicating all the matched pathways arranged
  by p-values (pathway enrichment analysis) on the y-axis, and the pathway impact
  values (pathway topology analysis) on the x-axis, with the numbers corresponding
  to the mapped pathways listed in Supplementary Table . The node colour is based
  on the p-value and the node radius is defined by the pathway impact values. The
  latter is the cumulative percentage from the matched metabolite nodes. (B) Topology
  map of glycine, serine and threonine metabolism displaying altered amino acids in
  response to PGPR treatment. Abbreviations: Bet; Betaine, Asp; Aspartic acis, Thr;
  Threonine, Ser; Serine, Gly; Glycine, and Trp; Tryptophan. As mentioned in the experimental
  section, this infographics (with both A and B components) is an output from pathway
  analyses performed using the MetaboAnlyst bioinformatics suite.'
