caption: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger fibrosis via several inflammatory pathways.
  Alcohol, viruses, or other toxic stimuli may injure hepatocytes, which release ROS
  and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that bind to Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) in Kupffer cells. Then, the TLR4/MyD88 pathway activates nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB), which triggers the inflammatory response by promoting the transcription
  of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3),
  pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-18, and pro-IL-1β. NLRP3 induces the maturation of caspase
  1, which in turn triggers inflammasome activation mediated by ROS and apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC); inflammasome activation
  induces the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18, which promote the activation of hepatic
  stellate cells (HSCs). ROS can activate the inflammasome through the thioredoxin-interacting
  protein (TXNIP) signaling pathway. NF-κB may promote caspase 11 upregulation via
  the IFN/STAT pathway. Caspase 1 and caspase 11 can induce pyroptosis via gasdermin
  by canonical or noncanonical pathways, respectively. Pyroptosis induces the activation
  of HSCs. ROS may promote NF-κB activation via the dissociation of the inhibitory
  factor IκB. Importantly, the activation of HSCs by any mechanism results in liver
  fibrosis.
