caption: Part of the innate immune signaling pathways triggered after the viral RNA
  is recognized by TLRs and RLRs. After TLR3 and TLR7/8 recognize the ligand in endosome,
  they recruit and activate TRIF and MyD88, respectively. RLRs member recognizes corresponding
  ligand and activates the CARD region of MAVS. Activated TRIF, MyD88, MAVS induce
  TANK, and TRAF3/6. Then one signal pathway activates IKKα/β and NEMO complex, and
  the other activates TBKI and IKKε, NEMO complex. Subsequently, the IKKα/β and NEMO
  complex activates NF-κB, while TBKI and IKKε, NEMO complex phosphorylates and activates
  IRF3/7 to induce the expression of IFN α/β gene. The produced IFN α/β can bind to
  receptor IFNAR1/2, recruit STAT1/2 through the JAK1/TYK2 adaptor molecule, and recruit
  IRF9 through phosphorylated STAT1/2 to form the complex ISGF3 and enter the nucleus,
  then bind ISRE, and stimulate the expression of ISGs (; ).
