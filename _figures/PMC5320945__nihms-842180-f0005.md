caption: The levels of any particular histone acylation depend on the relative concentration
  of its respective acyl-CoA (R-CoA) and of the other acyl-CoAs. For simplicity, this
  is represented here as the ratio between R-CoA and the most abundant acyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA
  (AcCoA). This ratio will determine how much of a particular acyl-CoA will be used
  by promiscuous histone acyl-transferases (writers) to acylate histone Lys residues.
  Acyl-CoAs can be generated through various intermediate metabolic pathways. Here
  we highlight pathways discussed in this review, which contribute either to R-CoA
  (non-acetyl CoAs) or AcCoA. For a more comprehensive discussion of these pathways
  see REF. . In metazoans, Acetyl-CoA used for histone acetylation is synthesized
  from citrate (derived from glucose through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle) by
  ATP-citrate lyase (ACL). Many acyl-CoAs can be derived from their cognate short-chain
  fatty acid (SCFA) by Acyl-CoA Synthetase 2 (ACSS2), including acetate and its CoA
  form. The pathway generating the SCFA β-hydroxybutyrate (bhb) involves the breakdown
  of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) through β-oxidation and subsequent ketogenesis.
  Malonyl-CoA (Mal-CoA) is generated as the first step in LCFA synthesis. It is still
  unclear what other cytoplasmic or nuclear pathways exist that generate the acyl-CoAs
  needed for the diversity of the observed histone acylations (represented as a question
  mark).
