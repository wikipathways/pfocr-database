caption: Schematic representation of the mechanisms mediated by NMs that influence
  macrophage functionality in PNR. (A and A′) NMs can enhance macrophage migration
  and adhesion by activating integrin receptor-associated signaling pathways, thereby
  accelerating macrophage recruitment during the initial stages. (B and B′) NMs can
  facilitate M1 polarization in macrophages, thereby augmenting the phagocytic clearance
  of myelin debris through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. (C and C′)
  NMs can promote macrophage M2 polarization and potentially mitigate inflammatory
  responses during the repair process by remodeling the cytoskeletal structure, reducing
  oxidative stress, and modulating metabolic reprogramming
