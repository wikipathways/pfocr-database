caption: 'Canonical signaling pathway of interferon-gamma. The heterotetrameric receptor
  complex for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) comprises IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. JAK1 and JAK2
  proteins are associated with intracellular domains of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, respectively.
  The binding of IFN-γ to its receptor complex promotes the transphosphorylation of
  JAK1/2, the phosphorylation of IFNGR1, and the recruitment of STAT1, followed by
  the STAT1 phosphorylation by JAK proteins. Phosphorylated STAT1 translocates into
  the nucleus to modulate the transcription of genes containing gamma-activated sequence
  motifs in their promoter regions. IFN-γ: Interferon-gamma; GAS: Gamma-activated
  sequence; ISGs: Interferon-stiumlated genes'
