caption: Viral pathogenesis and antiviral therapeutic mechanisms via the RP-MDM2-P53
  pathway. (i). ZIKV-C induces the interaction between uL5/RPL11 and MDM2 to stabilize
  p53 that sequentially promotes apoptosis in neuronal cells. (ii). HBx protein disturbs
  uL5/RPL11-MDM2 interaction to reduce p53 stability. (iii). SNORA18L5 keeps uL18/RPL5
  and uL5/RPL11 in the nucleolus, which keeps them from binding to MDM2, increasing
  MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Both (ii,iii) are related to
  HBV-induced HCC. (iv). HCMV infection raises the level of uS11/RPS14 and its interaction
  with MDM2. Emetine facilitates extra-ribosomal uS11/RPS14 nuclear importing, thereby
  reinforcing uS11/RPS14-MDM2 interaction and simultaneously reducing MDM2-p53 binding
  during HCMV infection. This upregulates the p53 level to greatly reduce HCMV replication.
