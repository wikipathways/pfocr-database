caption: (A) Study inclusion and exclusion criteria. (B) A biological representation
  of the components of the insulin signaling pathway relevant to the current analyses.
  Spearman correlations between proximal signaling proteins of interest are provided
  in yellow boxes. a From the Washington County study site, 96 participants with available
  plasma specimens, Aβ PET data, and MRI data were initially selected. Four additional
  participants with available plasma specimens and MRI data were also randomly selected.
  From this group of 100 plasma specimens, 12 specimens were used for exploratory
  analyses of other nEV proteins and thus excluded from the current study. Figure
  created with BioRender.com.
