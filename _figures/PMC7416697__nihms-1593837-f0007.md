caption: (A) In the absence of SHH agonist, PTCH prevents SMO activation and GPR161
  is retained at primary cilia where it regulates cAMP level. GLI2/3 is phosphorylated
  by PKA at inhibitory sites and proteolytically cleaved to act as a transcriptional
  repressor. ABCC4 is a plasma membrane, ATP-dependent cAMP efflux transporter.(B)
  When SHH binds to PTCH, SMO is activated where it enters primary cilia and induces
  GPR161 exit. SUFU and GLI2/3 also translocate to primary cilia, a step necessary
  for GLI2/3 conversion to transcriptional activator. It is unknown whether PKA activating
  phosphorylation on GLI2/3 occurs prior or after ciliary enrichment. When SHH pathway
  is active, ABCC4 is upregulated where it regulates membrane cAMP pool and PKA activity.
  ABCC4 acts as a restrain to allow for just enough PKA to be active to phosphorylate
  key SHH proteins such as GLI2/3 at specific sites required to ensure proper propagation
  of signaling. These PKA sites are distinct from that of (A).(C) In the absence of
  ABCC4, cAMP accumulates at the plasma membrane, GPR161 ciliary exit is delayed and
  PKA becomes over-activated. These results in GLI3-FL destabilization, leading the
  reduced GLI1 level. Over-activated PKA can also alter the phosphorylation codes
  in GLI2/3 and SUFU that are distinct from (B).
