caption: There is experimental evidence for two independent functions of PRG3. First,
  PRG3 interferes with the RhoA-Rock-PIP5K pathway through translocation of the lipid
  messenger PIP2. This central signal interference affects general downstream neurite
  growth inhibitors such as myelin-associated molecules such as Nogo-A, LPA and Thrombin.
  Secondly, interaction of PRG3 with RasGRF1 induces filopodia formation and neuronal
  plasticity via downstream effectors such as Raf and MEK.
