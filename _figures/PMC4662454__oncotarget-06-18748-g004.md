caption: A. Iron chelation modulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling.
  Activated by growth factors and cytokines, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade regulates
  cell growth and proliferation through multiple downstream effectors. ERK can also
  inhibit canonical TGF-β signaling by phosphorylating SMAD2 at the linker region
  (p-SMAD2L), preventing nuclear translocation of the SMAD2/3/4 complex and subsequent
  tumor-suppressive effects. The JNK and p38 pathways are two parallel MAPK cascades
  that are also classically activated by stress stimuli and may primarily mediate
  pro-apoptotic processes. Iron chelation is known to modulate the activities of ASK
  by dissociating its complex with thioredoxin (Trx), as well as JNK, p38, ERK and
  p-SMAD2L (see text for more detail). B. Modulation of STAT3 signaling by iron chelators
  and integrated pathway crosstalk between the MAPK and AKT pathways. STAT3 signaling
  is classically activated by cytokine receptor interactions, e.g., IL6/JAK, but can
  also be induced by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, e.g., EGFR, and non-receptor
  kinases, e.g., Src and c-Abl. Evidence also exists for potential STAT3 pathway crosstalk
  between the ERK and AKT pathways. Iron chelation has been demonstrated to inhibit
  STAT3 activity, which could be mediated by chelator-mediated effects on upstream
  regulators of STAT3 (see text for details). Molecules that are negatively regulated
  by iron chelators are indicated by red boxes, and those positively regulated are
  indicated by green boxes. Solid boxes indicate direct evidence for modulation by
  iron chelators, while dashed boxes indicate potential indirect modulation, e.g.,
  through chelator-mediated up-regulation of NDRG1. Dashed arrows indicate interactions
  that remain to be fully characterized (see text for details).
