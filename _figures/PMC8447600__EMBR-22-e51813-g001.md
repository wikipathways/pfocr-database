caption: Nitrate treatments increase cytosolic calcium levels which interact with
  calcium‐binding proteins such as kinases in the nitrate signaling pathway. Kinases
  phosphorylate protein targets such as transcription factors that can mediate changes
  in gene expression in response to nitrate treatments. Nitrate can also cause dephosphorylation
  of specific proteins. We showed nitrate treatments promote PIN2 dephosphorylation
  at S439 which impact membrane localization and polarity of the PIN2 protein. This
  post‐translational regulatory mechanism is important for modulation of primary root
  growth and lateral root density in response to nitrate treatments. Arrows and bar‐headed
  solid lines represent activation or inhibition in response to nitrate, respectively.
  Dashed arrows indicate proposed connections. A working model (depicted in synopsis
  image) was constructed with the BioRender.com software.
