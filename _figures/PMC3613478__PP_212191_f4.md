caption: The biosynthetic pathway of carotenoids depicting the expression profiles
  of enzymes catalyzing different steps beginning from the precursors. Dotted arrows
  indicate multiple steps in the pathway. The transcripts were quantified in the wild
  type and hp1 at , , and  stages of fruit development using real-time PCR. The transcripts
  were expressed after normalization with two internal controls, β-actin and ubiquitin.
