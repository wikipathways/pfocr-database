caption: Canonical Hippo signaling involves serine/threonine kinases MST1/2 (which
  are homologs of Drosophila Hippo) and LATS1/2. The Hippo pathway is “on”, when MST1/2
  and LATS1/2 kinases are active, which results in cytoplasmic retention and proteosomal
  degradation of YAP1 and TAZ. When Hippo signaling is “off”, YAP and TAZ localize
  to the nucleus and function as transcriptional co‐activators for TEA domain‐containing
  sequence‐specific and other transcription factors. Hippo signaling is governed by
  inputs from mechanical cues, plasma membrane proteins, cytoskeletal adapter proteins,
  and other signaling pathways. The chimeric fusion oncoprotein FUS:DDIT3, present
  in 90% of MLS, co‐localizes with YAP1 in the nucleus of FUS:DDIT3‐expressing cells,
  which mediates cell cycle progression, proliferation, evasion of senescence, and
  less apoptosis.
