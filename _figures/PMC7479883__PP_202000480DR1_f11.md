caption: Working model of GL2 and VLN in root hair growth and in response to osmotic
  stress in Arabidopsis. Arrows represent positive regulation and barred ends indicate
  inhibitory action. GL2 directly suppresses RSL2, LRL1, and LRL2 (), and VLN4 organizes
  longer actin filaments in the shank and shorter actin filaments in the subapex and
  apex in the fast-growing phase to promote root hair growth rate (). Our results
  indicate that GL2 directly actives VLN1 transcription to promote actin filament
  bundling in the subapex and apex in the terminating-growth and fully grown phases,
  which inhibits root hair fast growth (shown in the dashed box). Osmotic stress blocks
  the GL2-VLN1 pathway, leading to significantly longer root hairs in Arabidopsis.
