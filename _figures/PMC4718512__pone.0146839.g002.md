caption: The pathway consists of numerous parallel and cross reactions that lead to
  the production of distinct saturated and unsaturated dihydro- (DHC) and phyto- (PHC)
  ceramide variants with different FA chain lengths. The circles in , containing DHCs
  and PHCs, are here expanded to represent 12 distinct DHC species on the left and
  12 PHC species on the right, respectively. The green boxes represent IPC, and blue
  boxes represent corresponding sphingosine species. Fatty acyl CoA elongation is
  exhibited in the center of the pathway. Further details of ceramide metabolism are
  presented in the section Ceramide Metabolism.
