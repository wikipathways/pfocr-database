caption: MUC1-C activates JAK1→STAT3 signaling in an auto-inductive loop (NODE 3).
  As found for TAK1 in the NF-κB pathway, the MUC1-C/CD CQC motif binds to JAK1. In
  addition, like NF-κB p65, the MUC1-C/CD SRM functions as a site for direct binding
  to the STAT3 DBD and for JAK1-mediated pSTAT3 activation []. In turn, pSTAT3 induces
  MUC1 expression in another auto-inductive inflammatory circuit that parallels the
  node driving MUC1-C→NF-κB signaling.
