caption: (A) Jak-STAT signaling pathway, including phosphorylation and acetylation.
  (B) The schematic diagram of HSE. An acetyl group (CH3CO-) from Ace-CoA replaces
  the hydrogen atom in the epsilon-amino group (-NH3+)(blue) of side chain (red) of
  lysine residue, and the side chain of Lys685 is located at the upper half sphere
  which contains Cβ atom. (C) DNA binds to STAT3 homo-dimer, and surface of STAT3
  is colored by CHOPS[] score, a convex measure of protein surface. (D) Lysine acetylation
  equation.
