caption: Differences in mitochondrial function in PMCA-deficient PC12 cells. Higher
  resting [Ca2+]i that reflected a partial loss of calcium clearing potency might
  sensitize mitochondria to buffer cytosolic calcium transients. Because PMCA operates
  as a 1Ca2+/1H+ antiporter, the extrusion of Ca2+ introduces large quantities of
  H+ that are readily transported to mitochondria. Due to alkalization of mitochondrial
  matrix in steady-state conditions and because pHcyto was higher, but still lower
  than pHmito, in the cells increased pH gradient which could drive a higher rate
  of ATP synthesis, more significantly in PC12_2 cells. The loss of fast acting PMCA2
  could stimulate other ATP-dependent Ca2+ extruding proteins to restore [Ca2+]c,
  thereby increasing cellular demand for ATP. Also, in this line, OXPHOS rather than
  anaerobic glycolysis was a main energy supplying pathway. Interestingly, knockdown
  of PMCA3 isoform did not change the rate of OXPHOS. However, enhanced lactate release
  and greater sensitivity of the ATP level to glucose withdrawal in the presence of
  pyruvate suggests the reliance on anaerobic glycolysis, so the local synthesis of
  ATP may be sufficient to provide an adequate amount of energy. Other details are
  in the text. PMCA - plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase.
