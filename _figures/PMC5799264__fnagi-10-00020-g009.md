caption: Proposed model of the mechanism that mediates the neuroprotective action
  of ANP on PD cellular model. In intact midbrain, the balancing between Wnt-ON and
  Wnt-OFF in mDA is regulated by the microglial/astrocytic component, that produce
  and release neuroprotective molecules including Wnts, ANP and other NPs. In the
  in vitro model of PD, 6-OHDA antagonizes the Wnt/β-catenin signaling and shifts
  the balancing toward the “Wnt OFF” state, leading to the up-regulation of active
  GSK-3β with a consequent phosphorylation and rapid β-catenin degradation, thus increasing
  cell death of mDA neuron-like cells. ANP, possibly by a direct interaction with
  the Frizzled receptor, activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade, induces β-catenin
  stabilization and nuclear translocation, up-regulates the survival factors pAKT
  and DJ-1 and activates transcription of the DA neuron markers Nurr1 and TH, thus
  leading to survival and protection of mDA neurons. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli;
  AKT, Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase; β-TrCP, E3 ubiquitin ligase; CK1, casein kinase
  1; DKK, Dickkopf; Dvl, Disheveled; GBP, GSK3-binding protein; GSK, glycogen synthase
  kinase; LRP, LDL receptor-related protein; P, phosphorylation; TCF/LEF1, T-cell
  factor/lymphoid enhancer factor1.
