caption: A proposed metabolic schema for cells of the SAR202 clade. Oxidative enzymes
  encoded in the SAR202 genomes provide semispecific initial oxidation of heterogenous
  recalcitrant DOM on the cell surface or upon initial transport of these compounds
  into the cell. Carboxylate degradation products are ligated into a pool of CoA-linked
  substrates via acyl-CoA transferases. CoA-linked substrates move to the beta- and
  possibly alpha-oxidation pathways. Partial degradation products of fatty acids and
  substituted alkanes released from the partial oxidation of recalcitrant DOM may
  provide intermediates for absorption via the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle (3HPC). Incompletely
  degraded substrates may be substituted for more active substrates using acyl-CoA
  transferase activity, with released products being exported from the cell via a
  number of MFS1 transport proteins with documented promiscuous transport activities,
  thus contributing to a more refractory environmental pool of marine dissolved organic
  matter. 3HPC pathway gaps for which no suitable gene candidates were found in the
  draft genomes are marked in red. While it is uncertain as to whether the enzymes
  of the 3HPC shown here participate in carbon fixation, even an incomplete 3HPC could
  provide a means of assimilating a number of small carbon intermediates into central
  metabolism. Several mechanisms for cleavage of sulfite from sulfur and organosulfur
  compounds are encoded by the genome and may provide a source of sulfur for growth
  or a substrate for sulfite oxidase.
