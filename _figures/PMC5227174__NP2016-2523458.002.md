caption: The organ of Corti harbors HCs, which are vulnerable to infections and many
  pharmaceutical drugs such as aminoglycoside antibodies, for example, streptomycin
  and neomycin, and the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Most importantly, HCs can
  be damaged by acoustic trauma. In nonmammalian vertebrates such as birds, after
  ototoxic drugs or damaged by noise, the inner ear sensory HCs can regenerate spontaneously
  and eventually replace the damaged HCs, thus maintaining and restoring the function
  of sensory epithelium [, ]. However, in mammals, spontaneous HC regeneration in
  vivo has only been identified in neonatal cochleae and also the number of regenerated
  HCs is quite low; as a result the hearing loss is permanent in mammals [, ]. It
  is thought that the mammalian inner ear HCs and SCs originate from the common precursor
  cells and some of the reported studies suggested that some SCs become HCs when the
  microenvironment changes, such as damage to HCs and activation of particular genes;
  SCs can continue to differentiate to form HCs [, ]. Thus, currently some of the
  SCs are more commonly recognized as progenitor cells in regenerating HCs. At present,
  in view of the origin and regeneration of mammalian HCs, there are mainly two mechanisms
  of HCs regeneration from SCs, one is mitotic division of SC and the other is transdifferentiation
  [–]. In mitotic division, the SCs can divide and then their daughter cells undergo
  differentiating into HCs in some portions. In transdifferentiation, the SCs directly
  undergo phenotypic conversion and thus transdifferentiate into a HC without mitosis.
  Many studies have been done that illustrated the important factors, which are involved
  in the process of HC differentiation, such as Atoh1, p27Kip1, and Rb. Also, the
  cell signaling pathways, such as Notch, Wnt, and FGF signaling pathway, play important
  roles in HC regeneration ().
