caption: 'Establishment and maintenance of both oncogene-induced senescence (OIS),
  and replicative senescence (RS) is dependent on DDR activation. While in RS the
  DNA damage is due to telomere erosion across multiple mitotic divisions, in OIS
  this is due to the initial hyper-replication stress. In both cases, ATM-Chk1 and
  ATR-Chk2 pathways signal to the downstream effectors p53 and pRb that cooperate
  in growth-arresting the cells. Senescent cells do not proliferate but retain intense
  metabolic activity as demonstrated by activation of multiple effector pathways:
  the senescence-associated secretory pathway (SASP) with autocrine and paracrine
  functions; the senescence-associated protein degradation pathway (SAPD), important
  recycling network that along with autophagy provide essential metabolites to sustain
  the senescent hypertrophy. Senescent cells also undergo profound reorganization
  of chromatin as shown by the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic
  foci (SAHF), and senescence-associated distension of satellite (SADS). This chromatin
  remodeling is thought to mediate the shift from the initial mitotic gene expression
  profile to that typical of a senescent cell.'
