caption: Activation of NKG2D-related pathways. NKG2D binding with its ligand activates
  several molecular pathways in NK cells, which is provided by the DAP10 signaling
  molecule. Cytotoxicity of NK cells may be activated through phospholipase C Gamma
  2 (PLCγ2), c-Jun-NH (2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-hydroxy
  kinase PI3K. Granule release is activated by the PLCγ2 and PI3K pathways. The JAK-STAT5
  (Janus kinase 2-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5) pathway results
  in cytokine release.
