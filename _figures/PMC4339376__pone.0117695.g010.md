caption: Magnolol or honokiol significantly decreased the expression levels of RAS1,
  EFG1, TEC1, and CDC35 genes encoding the Ras1-cAMP-Efg1 pathway. In addition, exogenous
  cAMP restored hyphal formation in the magnolol and honokiol treatment groups. Collectively,
  these magnolol or honokiol-mediated effects impede the activation of the Ras1-cAMP
  signaling pathway and ultimately down regulate TEC1 and EFG1 expression thereby
  inhibiting hyphal growth and biofim formation. HWP1, ECE1, and ALS3 genes which
  are involved in adherence are also regulated by Efg1.
