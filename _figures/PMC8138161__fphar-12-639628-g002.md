caption: 'Mechanism of the apoptotic pathway in cancer. To initiate apoptosis, two
  central pathways are involved in this mechanism: the intrinsic pathway and extrinsic
  pathway. The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is well defined by the TNF-α/TNFR1 and
  FasL/FasR models. Herein, the death receptor is induced by an adaptor protein; adaptor
  proteins are comprised of FADD (Fas-associated death domain) and TRADD (TNF receptor-associated
  death domain). The signaling that occurs through the extrinsic pathway causes the
  attachment of DRs to specific death ligands (DLs), thereby forming a death-inducing
  signaling cascade (DISC). The complex pathway of caspase-8 activation follows a
  predefined system that actively enables caspase-8 to detach from the DISC, whether
  or not the pro-domain of caspase-8 is retained as part of the DISC to initiate the
  signaling phases of apoptosis. However, in most apoptotic cells, proteins are customarily
  engaged in intrinsic phases that involve caspase-9, SMAC/DIABLO, Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Aven,
  Nox, and MYC. Mitochondrial dysfunction is followed by the loss of inner membrane
  mitochondrial potential, adequate formation of superoxide ions, impaired mitochondrial
  biogenesis formation, release of intra-membrane proteins, and matrix calcium glutathione
  burst, which enumerate the important potential for cancer therapeutic strategies
  by triggering the intrinsic phases of apoptosis in tumor cells. The execution phase
  of apoptosis initiator caspases, such as caspase-8/-9 or caspase-activated dnase
  (CAD), Poly (ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and other caspases such as caspase-3,
  -6, -7, and caspase-10, are typified as upregulator or executioner caspases. Caspase-3
  is the most essential and effective of all effector caspases because it can be activated
  by all initiator caspases.'
