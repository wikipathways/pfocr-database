caption: A summary of interactions between ECM remodelling and kinase activity. (A)
  LOX activity catalyses the crosslinking of collagen fibres, essential for both fibrillar
  collagen deposition and increases in ECM stiffness. (B) LOX-mediated ECM remodelling
  triggers FAK/SRC signalling pathways via integrin activation, influencing focal
  adhesion assembly/disassembly and cell-to-cell contact, as well as regulating cell
  proliferation and cell survival. (C) DDR2 is activated by fibrillar collagen and
  can activate the PI3K/Akt and SRC kinase pathways. (D) LOX expression can also activate
  the Akt signalling pathway via PDGFRβ activation, inducing both changes in cell
  survival and increased expression of VEGF, leading to enhanced angiogenesis. (E)
  LOX has also been implicated in the breakdown of TGFβ signalling by catalysing the
  assembly of HTRA1, resulting in disruptions to TGFβ activation. This inhibition
  of TGFβ signalling causes an upregulation of MATN2, which traps EGF receptors at
  the cell surface and leads to the activation of signalling pathways involved in
  proliferation and cell survival. (F) ECM-mediated FAK/SRC activation can also regulate
  RHO-ROCK activity to modulate cell migration and ECM remodelling via cytoskeletal
  changes. (G) ECM components are degraded by a range of matrix degrading enzymes
  such as MMPs, cathepsins, hyaluronidases and ADAMs/ADAMTSs, which can then serve
  as ligands for receptors. (H) Extracellular kinases can phosphorylate ECM components
  and potentially alter downstream kinase signalling pathways. (I) Mutations in TGFβ
  signalling pathway in cancer can lead to an upregulation of STAT3 kinase signalling,
  which can in turn alter ECM deposition and dictate tumour ECM stiffness. (J) Elastin
  activates elastin binding protein receptors (EBPR), which can subsequently activate
  PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signalling pathways to enhance cancer cell proliferation and
  migration.

  description: A summary of interactions between ECM remodelling and kinase activity.
    (A) LOX activity catalyses the crosslinking of collagen fibres, essential for
    both fibrillar collagen deposition and increases in ECM stiffness. (B) LOX-mediated
    ECM remodelling triggers FAK/SRC signalling pathways via integrin activation,
    influencing focal adhesion assembly/disassembly and cell-to-cell contact, as well
    as regulating cell proliferation and cell survival. (C) DDR2 is activated by fibrillar
    collagen and can activate the PI3K/Akt and SRC kinase pathways. (D) LOX expression
    can also activate the Akt signalling pathway via PDGFRβ activation, inducing both
    changes in cell survival and increased expression of VEGF, leading to enhanced
    angiogenesis. (E) LOX has also been implicated in the breakdown of TGFβ signalling
    by catalysing the assembly of HTRA1, resulting in disruptions to TGFβ activation.
    This inhibition of TGFβ signalling causes an upregulation of MATN2, which traps

    involved in proliferation and cell survival. (F) ECM-mediated FAK/SRC activation
