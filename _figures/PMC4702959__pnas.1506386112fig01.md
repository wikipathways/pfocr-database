caption: Model for the oxidation of thiosulfate by the Sox system. Pathway intermediates
  are carried by the SoxYZ complex through conjugation to a cysteine residue on the
  SoxY swinging arm (shown as –S−). A small c-type cytochrome acts as the direct electron
  acceptor from the Sox enzymes. In some sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, the Sox pathway
  is cyclical and thiosulfate is completely oxidized to sulfate (solid arrows). Other
  sulfur-oxidizing bacteria lack the SoxCD enzyme, and the sulfane intermediate is
  used to produce polymeric sulfur species in the form of sulfur globules, which are
  subsequently oxidized to sulfate by a cytoplasmic pathway (dotted arrow) (). Sulfane
  transfer between SoxYZ and the sulfur globules is likely mediated by the rhodanese-like
  protein SoxL (). As well as partnering the canonical Sox enzymes, SoxYZ probably
  also interacts with SoxEF/FccAB (), a flavocytochrome c with a poorly defined function
  in the Sox mechanism (). Additionally, SoxYZ has been implicated in sulfite oxidation
  in A. vinosum where it is suggested sulfite is carried as a SoxY-cysteine-S-sulfinate
  derivative, which then interacts with unidentified partners ().
