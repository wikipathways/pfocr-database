caption: NF-κB is liberated and enters the nucleus of RA FLSs when stimulated with
  TNF-α or IL-1β. Then, NF-κB is activated and binds to the promoter of YY1 and enhances
  its expression. The latter protein can act as a transcription factor and repress
  miR-10a expression by binding to the two YY1-binding sites located in the promoter
  region of miR-10a. Downregulated miR-10a subsequently promotes NF-κB activation
  and translocation by targeting IRAK4, TAK1 and BTRC. The activated NF-κB then further
  downregulates miR-10a via YY1. At the same time, this regulatory circuit promotes
  the release of various inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and
  MCP-1, and the metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP13, which are controlled by NF-κB
  and accelerate the proliferation, migration and invasion of FLSs in RA. The black
  lines indicate the canonical NF-κB pathway; the red lines indicate the regulatory
  circuit reported here.
