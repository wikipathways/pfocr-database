caption: The potential regulatory mechanism of the identified gene switches for breast
  cancer. A) ESR1 activates the transcription of a microRNA, miR-375, probably by
  binding to the putative promoter of the microRNA. miR-375 targets and inhibits the
  expression of RASD1 (ras dexamethasome-induced 1) gene, which is an inhibitor of
  the ESR1 gene expression. With this positive feedback, ESR1 can activate its own
  expression by reducing the inhibition of RASD1 through activation of miR-375. This
  model was suggested by []. B) ERBB2 activates the expression and phosphorylation
  of transcription factor c-Jun, which is able to bind to the promoter of ERBB2 to
  further induce ERBB2 transcription. This potential positive feedback is likely enhanced
  through c-Jun dependent activation of BEX2 (brain expressed X-linked 2) gene. This
  model was suggested by []. C) A hypothetical regulatory role of TACSTD2 in breast
  cancer cells. The activation of TACSTD2 increase the cytoplasmic calcium (Ca2+)
  level, which could in turn activate CREB and the MAPK/ERK pathway through calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinases (e.g. CaMKII). The activated MAPK pathway can increase the expression
  of cyclin D1 and cyclin E as well as reduce the level of CDK inhibitor, p27, to
  thereby promote cell proliferation. The activated CREB could bind to the promoter
  of TACSTD2, and form a positive feedback to promote and maintain the ON state of
  TACSTD2. Tamoxifen resistance is associated with the disregulation (high expression
  level) of c-Fos, AP-1 and pCREB activation [], which could possibly be mediated
  by a constitutive ON state of TACSTD2. Trastuzumab resistance is associated with
  the disregulation of p27 and cyclin D/E (constitutive activation of cyclin D/E and
  the reason is unclear) [], which could be modulated by activation of TACSTD2.
