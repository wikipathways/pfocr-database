caption: Schematic model of morphogenic gradients controlling striatal development
  and involved in abnormal neurogenesis in Rarb−/− mice. Top, Developing LGE is represented
  in blue. A gradient of RA activity, generated through combined ligand (Raldh3-dependent)
  and receptor (RARα and RARβ in SVZ, RARβ in MZ) distributions, is presumably highest
  in the SVZ. By activating Fgf3 expression, this would allow FGF signaling to be
  transduced by FGF receptors (FGFR) mainly present in the VZ. Bottom, Neurogenesis
  in WT mice (black arrows) involves progressive neural specification of stem cells
  (circle) and cell divisions of neural progenitors (crossed circles). In Rarb−/−
  mice, a subpopulation of progenitor cells prematurely expresses Meis1 in the VZ
  and SVZ regions, leading to premature differentiation of striatonigral neurons and
  thus impoverishment of the pool of striatonigral progenitors that normally undergo
  differentiation through a Foxp1-dependent and Ikzf1-dependent pathway.
