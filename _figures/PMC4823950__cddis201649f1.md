caption: (a) Representation of the TRAIL-resistant phenotype exhibited by TrkA SH-SY5Y
  NB cells in the absence of NGF, demonstrating cFLIP-mediated inhibition of TRAIL-induced
  pro-caspase-8 activation, absence of Bid cleavage, maintenance of mitochondrial
  integrity and optimised X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)-mediated blockage
  of pro-caspase-9 and pro-caspase-3 activation, combining to result in TRAIL resistance.
  (b) Representation of NGF sensitisation of TRAIL-resistant TrkA SH-SY5Y NB cells
  to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, demonstrating cFLIP sequestration by NGF-activated TrkA,
  TRAIL-induced activation of pro-caspase-8 and subsequent Bid cleavage (tBid), tBid
  induction of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation, subsequent release to
  the cytoplasm of mitochondrial components (Omi/Smac/Cyto c), leading to compromised
  XIAP function, facilitating cytochrome c-mediated activation of pro-caspase-9 and
  pro-caspase-3, resulting in the induction of type II apoptosis through the intrinsic
  mitochondrial pathway. NGF stimulation of Mcl-1 expression through NF-κB, responsible
  for the eventual blockage of the temporary NGF-sensitisation response, and relief
  of this blockage by Mcl-1 siRNA and dominant negative dn-NF-κB are also shown
