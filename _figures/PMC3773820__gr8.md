caption: Role of Nor-1 in incretin-induced insulin expression and secretion and hypothetical
  localization of the TCF7L2 and NR4A3 SNP effects. The well-known TCF7L2 SNP rs7903146
  leads to impaired incretin response, inhibited PKA pathway, and reduced insulin
  secretion (dashed lines). Based on our molecular data, we propose a gain-of-function
  mechanism in NR4A3 SNP rs12686676 carriers independent of incretin action. Increased
  Nor-1 expression enhances insulin secretion in these subjects probably by induction
  of genes encoding for exocytosis proteins and maybe by increasing intracellular
  insulin content thereby bypassing the defect caused by the TCF7L2 SNP (solid lines).
