caption: Schematic of cross talk between cAMP/PKA and MAPK1,2 downstream of atRA signaling
  in HIV-infected podocytes. Nef, an HIV accessory protein, interacts with Src, leading
  to Ras/C-Raf/MAPK1,2 phosphorylation in podocytes. This sustained MAPK1,2 phosphorylation
  contributes to podocyte proliferation and dedifferentiation. atRA stimulates intracellular
  cAMP production, which activates PKA, leading to CREB phosphorylation. CREB directly
  mediated the early phase of atRA-induced MKP1 stimulation, whereas the later phase
  was mediated indirectly by CREB through induction of USF1 expression. Through this
  feed-forward gene-regulatory motif, atRA induced sustained upregulation of MKP1
  to suppress HIV-induced activation of the MAPK1,2 pathway, leading to podocyte differentiation
  and growth arrest.
