caption: Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) network for chemicals that disrupt androgen
  receptor mediated cellular signaling leading to adverse effects on development of
  the male reproductive tract resulting from in utero exposure. The red-outlined key
  event indicates the critical node that links the various molecular initiating events
  (MIEs) to the downstream adverse outcomes. DHT=dihydrotestosterone, AR=androgen
  receptor, CYP=cytochrome P450, HMG-CoA=3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A
