caption: Accumulation and transcriptional activation of p53 occurs in response to
  a wide variety of insults such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity,
  etc. p53 undergoes PTMs that critically control its stability and function, including
  phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, oxidation and others. Cellular stress
  affects the interaction between p53 and MDM2, an ubiquitin ligase responsible for
  p53 degradation. In parallel, transcriptional activity of p53 requires acetylation
  and/or phosphorylation that may promote cell death pathway through the activation
  of downstream targets (Bax, Puma, PARP1, Caspase 3, PGC-1α and others). HSPs (27
  and 70) act as pro-survival signals by interacting with pro-apoptotic mediators
  and stabilizing p53 inactive form (p53/MDM2 complex).
