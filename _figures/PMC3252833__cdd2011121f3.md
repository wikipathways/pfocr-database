caption: Sensitisation of type 2 cancer cells towards DR-induced killing by synthetic
  IAP antagonists. (a) This image represents a type-2 cancer cell that, through overexpression
  of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (e.g. Bcl-2 or Mcl-1) and/or XIAP, has become highly
  resistant towards FasL- or TRAIL-induced apoptosis. (b) Addition of an IAP-antagonistic
  small molecular Smac-mimetic, ideally an XIAP-selective inhibitor to minimise side
  effects, uncouples the DR-induced apoptotic pathway from its mandatory crosstalk
  to the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, thereby sensitising the cancer cells towards
  FasL-, TRAIL- or TNF-induced killing. Combination therapy with additional standard
  chemotherapeutic drugs, or direct targeting of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins by
  BH3 mimetics, thereby triggering MOMP, might further sensitise the cancer cell to
  undergo apoptosis
