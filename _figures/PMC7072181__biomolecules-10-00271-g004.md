caption: 'Proposed pathways targeted by DMF/MMF. (a) Michael addition of DMF/MMF and
  reactive cysteine residues in proteins. R1: protein or peptide; R2 and R3 = CH3:
  DMF; R2 = H and R3 = CH3: MMF; R2 and R3 = H: fumarate. (b) DMF and MMF target different
  pathways. MMF binds and activates the cell surface receptor HCA2. DMF and, to a
  lesser extent, MMF, enter the cell and activate NRF2 by the inhibition of KEAP1.
  DMF inhibits the NF-κB pathway by oxidation of specific cysteine residues in different
  NF-κB regulatory proteins. DMF can also inhibit inflammasome activation. Furthermore,
  DMF/MMF can react with GSH influencing the GSH/GSSG ratio, which in turn can affect
  the NRF2, NF-κB and inflammasome pathways.'
