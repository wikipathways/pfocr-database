caption: 'Schematic proposed model of mouse and human DCs activation upon stimulation
  with virulent compared to avirulent pathogenic strains of leptospires. Simplified
  model to explain the differential activation profiles in mouse (BM-DC, light blue
  frame) and human (MO-DCs, transparent frame) dendritic cells upon stimulation with
  leptospires. Saprophytic and avirulent strains of leptospires (green box) trigger
  a strong activation of mouse DCs since they activate 3 pathways: the murine (m)TLR4/MyD88,
  the endosomal mTLR4/TRIF, and the mTLR2/MyD88 pathways, all converging to the central
  NF-κB transcription factor, important for upregulation of activation markers (CD40)
  and cytokines production. In contrast, the virulent leptospires (red box) only stimulate
  2 pathways in mouse DCs: the mTLR4/MyD88 and mTLR2/MyD88 pathways. The escape from
  the mTLR4/TRIF pathway by virulent leptospires (also evidenced in macrophages ())
  is depicted (grey capped line). Hence, the upregulation in CD40 and cytokines by
  virulent strains is lowered compared to avirulent strains. Finally, since leptospires
  are not recognized by the human (h)TLR4 (, ) (grey capped line), leptospires would
  activate the human DC mainly through the hTLR2/MyD88 pathway, which could explain
  both the low activation of DC by leptospires and the lack of differences between
  virulent and avirulent strains.'
