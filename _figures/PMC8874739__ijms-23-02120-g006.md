caption: The KEGG Ca2+signaling pathway was significantly altered in both PACAP-38
  and PACAP(6-38)-treated trigeminal ganglion cells. Rectangles in color indicate
  genes that were significantly changed after treatment (left sides of rectangles
  represent PACAP-38, while right sides stand for PACAP(6-38)). The red and blue color
  scale show normalized fold change values for each differentially expressed gene.
  The KEGG Ca2+signaling pathway also significantly implicated by ranked list enrichment
  performed on all genes can be found in .
