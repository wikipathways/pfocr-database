caption: Working model for protective effects of SIRT1 via HAS2–AS1 and NF-κB. Stimulation
  of AoSMCs with TNFα can activate the p65 subunit of NF-κB through acetylation with
  its consequent translocation into the nucleus and the activation of target genes
  involved in the inflammatory response. In the nucleus, p65 is able to activate HAS2–AS1
  promoter, which induces HAS2 expression and subsequent synthesis of a monocyte adhesive
  extracellular HA matrix on AoSMCs. The activation of SIRT1 by SRT1720 and RESV initiates
  the inhibition pathway (red) by retaining p65 in the cytoplasm, probably by promoting
  deacetylation of p65, which prevents p65 nuclear translocation that prevents activation
  of an HAS2–AS1 promoter. This would inhibit HAS2 mRNA and protein expression, thereby
  preventing formation of the monocyte adhesive HA matrix, immune cells recruitment,
  and AoSMC migration, thus protecting AoSMCs from TNFα-induced inflammation.
