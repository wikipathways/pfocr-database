caption: The drug-subpathway network in HGCC. The network shows the subpathways (squares)
  that could be targeted by drugs (diamonds) based on three level of omics data from
  HGCC database. The associations between genes within subpathway and three level
  datas are denoted by colors in the ring chart. The color of subpathway and drug
  indicates the pathway class and drug class. The subpathway classification (risk
  or protective) is denoted by the color of the square border. The edge width indicated
  the number of associations between drug and corresponding subpathway at three levels.
  The size of subpathways increase with the degree which reflects the associations
  with drugs
