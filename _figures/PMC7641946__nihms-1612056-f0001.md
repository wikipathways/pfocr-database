caption: Repair of DSBs is a stepwise pathway. (A) NHEJ. (1) Ku70-Ku80 (Ku) heterodimer
  recognizes DSB end. (2) Recruitment of DNA-PKcs to Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer-DSB ends.
  If incompatible ends, further processing is required. (3) Ligation of DNA ends by
  XRCC4-DNA ligase IV. (B) HR. (1) MRN, stimulated by CtIP performs end-resection.
  (2) ssDNA is bound by RPA. (3) RAD51 replaces RPA, forming a RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein
  filament. (4) RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament performs strand invasion of the
  sister chromatid, leading to template-dependent strand extension followed by strand
  annealing. (C) MMEJ. (1) PARP-1 competes with Ku70–80 to bind DSBs ends, recruiting
  MRN and CtIP. (2) End-resection is initiated by MRN, stimulated by CtIP, in a stepwise
  manner first with the creation of a 3’ single-strand region endonucleolytically,
  subsequently followed by 3’ to 5’ exonucleolytic digestion. (3) Competition for
  binding of single-stranded DNA by RPA or HMCES with HMCES-ssDNA coating favored
  by MMEJ. (4) End-bridging and microhomology alignment. End-bridging is mediated
  by a combination of PARP-1, MRN, and POLQ. (5) Flap processing. Non-homologous 3’
  tails are removed by ERCC1/XPF, FEN1, and likely as-yet identified endonucleases.
  Non-homologous 5’ tails are removed by FEN1. (6) POLQ gap filling. POLQ can uniquely
  prime DNA synthesis from non-optimal base-pairing leading distinctive templated
  insertions. (7) Ligation of ends by LIG3/XRCC1. See text for more details.
