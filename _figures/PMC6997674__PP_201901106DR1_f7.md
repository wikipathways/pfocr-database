caption: A working model depicting the function of the two chloroplast proteins in
  plant drought resistance. Drought stress promotes the biosynthesis of ABA and activates
  the ABA signaling pathway. In addition to phosphorylating the plasma membrane-bound
  NADPH oxidase RbohF and promoting the production of H2O2, OST1 can also interact
  and phosphorylate the chloroplast protein PPD5, which negatively regulates ROS and
  ABA accumulation under drought stress conditions. This negative regulation may involve
  a competition for OST1 between PPD5 and other OST1 substrate proteins. Another chloroplast
  protein, THF1, modulates H2O2 accumulation and plant drought resistance in an OST1-independent
  manner.
