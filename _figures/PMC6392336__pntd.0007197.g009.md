caption: 'L. obliqua venom is able to directly activate kallikrein in plasma. Consequently,
  prekallirein levels decrease, while increase plasma and tissue levels of active
  kallikrein. Once activated, it seems that kallikrein participate in kidney and vascular
  disturbances by two main mechanisms: (i) Triggering the intrinsic pathway of coagulation
  and activating VSMC changing it to a procoagulant profile. Both mechanisms lead
  to the formation of procoagulant enzymes and up-regulation of TF, which ultimately
  are involved in fibrinogen consumption and deposition of fibrin in glomerular small
  vessels; and (ii) Releasing bradykinin (BK) from LMWK and HMWK. BK acts through
  activation of the B1 and B2 receptors being involved in inflammation, ROS and NO
  production, vascular remodelling, control of vascular tone and permeability and
  also in electrolyte imbalance. Altogether, probably these vascular alterations contribute
  to a significant decrease in renal blood flow and perfusion pressure which is accompanied
  by ATN, tubular obstruction (caused by cell debris accumulated inside tubules) and
  a reduction in GFR. Evidence also points to the participation of cytotoxic components
  released in plasma during envenomation due to intravascular hemolysis. These components
  participate increasing cell migration, proliferation and activating kallikrein-mediated
  ROS sensitive signalling pathways in VSMC. Red arrows denote increase or decrease
  of components and process determined in the present study. Abbreviations: FBG, fibrinogen;
  ATN, acute tubular necrosis; TF, tissue factor; LMWK, low molecular weight kininogen;
  HMWK, high molecular weight kininogen; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NO, nitric
  oxide; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; GFR,
  glomerular filtration rate.'
