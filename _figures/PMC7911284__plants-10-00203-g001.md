caption: Terpenoid biosynthetic pathway in bryophytes. Red, orange and cyan arrows
  indicate the metabolic fluxes observed in mosses, liverworts and hornworts, as suggested
  in various reports (see references in the main text). Arrow thickness represents
  the amount of carbon streams (resources) committed for the production of specific
  metabolites in a specific bryophyte division. The question marks next to the faint
  arrows state that no information is available about the production of squalene and
  triterpenoid in hornworts.
