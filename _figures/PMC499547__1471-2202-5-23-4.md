caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating second messenger pathways possibly involved
  in regulating pigment granule movement in RPE and entry points for muscarinic regulation.
  Most evidence suggests a central role for cAMP-dependent phosphorylation events
  in the induction of pigment granule aggregation in retinal pigment epithelium. Shown
  in black boxes in this schematic diagram are players in this pathway that have been
  manipulated experimentally in RPE isolated from bluegill, green sunfish or both.
  Pathways shown in red indicate possible regulatory inputs from muscarinic receptor
  activation (see text for a more extensive explanation as well as references). Abbreviations
  used are as follows (listed alphabetically): 5''-AMP, 5''-adenosine monophosphate;
  Ca2+, calcium; Ca-CaM, calcium-calmodulin complex; cAMPi, intracellular cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate; cAMPo, extracellular cyclic adenosine monosphosphate; FSK, forskolin;
  Gi, inhibitory GTP-binding protein; GSF, green sunfish (indicating that this experimental
  manipulation was only performed on RPE isolated from green sunfish); IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine
  (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor); IP3, inositol trisphosphate; Meven, muscarinic
  acetylcholine receptor subtype 2 or 4; Modd, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype
  1, 3, or 5; OAT, organic anion transporter; PDE, phosphodiesterase; PKI5–24amide,
  cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitory peptide (amino acids 5–24) with an amide
  adduct; PLC, phospholipase C; Protein-P, a phosphoprotein; arrows terminating in
  diamonds signify inhibitory effects; arrows terminating in triangles or barbs signify
  stimulatory effects.'
