caption: Metabolic profile of thiamine biosynthesis pathway in S. glossinidius and
  W. glossinidia. (A) Schematic diagram of thiamine biosynthesis pathway. Reactions
  coloured in blue represents the functional profile of thiamine biosynthesis in W.
  glossinidia, whereas reactions coloured in green represents the functional profile
  of thiamine biosynthesis in S. glossinidius; Pseudogenized activities are represented
  by dashed lines. Functional thiamine ABC transport system, thiamine kinase (thiK)
  and thiamine phosphate kinase (thiL) allow thiamine diphosphate biosynthesis from
  exogenous thiamine. (B) Structure of the thiamine biosynthesis operon in S. glossinidius,
  E. coli K12, and W. glossinidia. Functional genes (blue), pseudogenes (red), and
  the thiS gene of W. glossinidia characterized in this study (green). The thiH gene
  in S. glossinidius corresponds to an originally annotated gene (SG0136) with a premature
  stop codon detected during the reannotation process (*1)
