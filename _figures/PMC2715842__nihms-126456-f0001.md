caption: Recognition of poorly immunogenic tumor via endogenous and exogenous pathways.
  Relying on presentation of antigens by a genetically unstable tumor can result in
  unreliable and suboptimal responses. Defects in the antigen processing via the endogenous
  pathway, including β2-microglobulin, TAP1, and TAP2 deficiencies and loss of MHC
  chains can affect a tumor cell’s ability to process and present MHC class I-restricted
  antigens. These defects can render CD8+ cytotoxic cells unable to eliminate tumors
  cells, leading to preferential survival of escape variants. Direct recognition of
  tumors via MHC class II is equally dependant on the unstable autophagy and antigen
  processing by cancer cells. Normal professional antigen presenting cells (APCs)
  infiltrating the tumor or present in the draining lymph nodes are less subject to
  derangements of their antigen processing and presenting machinery. APC continually
  monitor the environment, take up tumor-derived material and efficiently present
  it to CD4+ T cells even if the tumor cells lost the endogenous ability to process
  antigens.
