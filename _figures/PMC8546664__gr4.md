caption: 'Therapeutic strategy of DDR alterations in cancer immunotherapy. Combination
  strategy: cancer cells treated with PARP inhibitors are sensitive to immune checkpoint
  inhibitors. PARP inhibitors increase genomic instability, activate immune pathway
  and upregulate the expression of PD-L1 on cancer cells, making the combination of
  PARP inhibitor with ICIs a promising strategy against cancer.'
