caption: Major pathways upregulated by chronic hyperglycemia. These pathways include
  the polyol pathway, the hexosamine pathway, PKC activation, formation of advanced
  glycation end products (AGEs), and the enediol formation pathway. These pathways
  usually remain dormant under euglycemia conditions whereby majority of the body's
  glucose is combusted through glycolysis and TCA cycle.
