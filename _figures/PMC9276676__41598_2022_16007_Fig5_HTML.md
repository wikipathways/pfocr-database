caption: DFMO impacts polyamine synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, capsule biosynthesis,
  and oxidative stress responses in pneumococci. Significant accumulation of metabolites
  is shown in blue, depletion is shown in red, while black represents no detected
  change. Multi-step reactions are represented by a broken arrow. DFMO treatment inhibits
  agmatine, cadaverine, putrescine and spermidine synthesis. UDP-Galactose production
  via Leloir pathway is inhibited. Impaired glycolytic pathway activity results in
  reduced glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN6P) and ultimately UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc), a precursor for sugars in serotype 4 CPS repeat unit (open oval).
  Altered UDP-GlcNAc also impacts UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (UDP-MurNAc) availability
  for peptidoglycan assembly (open rectangle) which is the site of attachment of capsule.
  Redirection of glucose via glucose 6-phosphate from glycolytic pathway to pentose
  phosphate pathway, and subsequent increase in NADPH and 5-phospho-α-d-ribose 1-diphosphate
  (PRPP) are consistent with increased oxidative stress response and repair in DFMO
  treated cells.
