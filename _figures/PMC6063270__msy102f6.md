caption: The solutions to tune GAL network activities are limited by pleiotropic constraints
  on a metabolic bottleneck that integrates flux from multiple pathways. Metabolic
  flux from the Leloir/GAL pathway to glycolysis is controlled by the activity of
  the bottleneck gene(s) PGM1/2, which encode enzyme(s) that catalyze the interconversion
  of glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. Unlike the rest of the GAL pathway,
  the activity encoded by PGM1/2 is evolutionarily constrained by at least four converging
  metabolic pathways, including the GAL pathway, glycogen biosynthesis, trehalose
  biosynthesis, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The left panel shows the scenario
  without the Gal4-binding sites, such as in S. cerevisiae and V. polyspora. The right
  panel shows how a “cis dial” regulating PGM1/2 (with a varying number of Gal4-binding
  sites) is able to bypass the pleiotropic constraints to specifically increase flux
  from the GAL pathway to glycolysis in response to galactose, such as in S. uvarum
  and L. kluyveri.
