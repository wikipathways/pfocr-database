caption: 'Scheme of the main steps for autophagy and their regulation by AMPK. An
  autophagy pathway starts with the formation of the isolation membrane, also known
  as phagophore. The autophagy implicates the coordinated temporal and spatial activation
  of numerous molecular components. (A): The ULK1-FIP200-ATG13-ATG101 complex is responsible
  for initiating the autophagic process. The activity of this protein complex is antagonistically
  regulated by mTORC1 (inhibitory phosphorylation) and by AMPK, which both activates
  the ULK1 complex as well as inhibits the activity of the mTORC1 complex. (B): The
  ClassIII PI3K complex formed by VPS34, Beclin1, ATG14, AMBRA1, and other subunits
  creates a membrane domain enriched in PtsIns3P, which drives the nucleation of ATG
  (AuTophaGy-related) proteins in the phagophore, either directly or indirectly. AMPK
  is able to increase the pro-autophagic function of this complex and to enhance its
  formation, whereas mTORC1 activity negatively regulates its function. (C): Two different
  transmembrane proteins, the vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) and ATG9 participate
  in the recruitment of membranes to the phagophore. AMPK is able to phosphorylate
  ATG9, which increases its recruitment towards autophagosome formation sites. (D):
  Two ubiquitin-like (UBL) protein conjugation systems (ATG12- and LC3- UBLs) involving
  the participation of ATG4 cysteine proteinases (which activate LC3 by cleaving its
  carboxyl terminus), the E1-like enzyme ATG7 (common to both conjugation systems),
  and the E2-like enzymes ATG10 (ATG12 system), and ATG3 (LC3 system). In coordination,
  the activity of both systems is required to conjugate LC3 (and other members of
  this protein family homologous to yeast ATG8) to a phosphatidyl-ethanolamine lipid
  at the nascent pre-autophagosomal membrane. (E): Upon completion, fully-formed autophagosomes
  move along the microtubule network, eventually fusing with a lysosome, thus acquiring
  hydrolytic activity, and thus becoming autolysosomes. Several SNARE-like proteins
  (i.e., Syntaxin17 and VAMP8, among others) are required for efficient fusion between
  lysosomes and autophagosomes. Once content and inner membrane are degraded by acidic
  hydrolases, the resultant molecules (amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, etc.) are
  recycled back to the cytoplasm by membrane permeases.'
