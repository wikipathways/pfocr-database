caption: Osteoclastogenesis. Proposed model of a ginsenoside inhibiting the binding
  of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) to receptor activator
  of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) and melatonin receptor type 1A, matrix metallopeptidase
  (MMP) by binding with RANK or RANKL. This decreases the response of RANKL, reduces
  the induction of MMP-9, and blocks the RANKL, RANK signaling pathway. RANKL binds
  to RANK, so tumor necrosis factor-receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) binds to
  RANK and plays a key role in osteoclast differentiation by regulating and activating
  downstream signaling pathways, such as the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway,
  the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (INK) pathway, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway
  and the p38 pathway. These pathways ultimately prop up osteoclast differentiation
  and bone resorption by stimulating different transcriptional factors such as activator
  protein-1 (AP1) and NF-κB pathways. It is not clear how these factors are activated
  by TRAF6 and cause bone resorption by activating osteoclast specific markers, such
  as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin (CTSK), β3 integrin and
  calcitonin receptors (CTR). MMPs, and in particular MMP-9, are responsible for bone
  resorption, which is extremely articulated in osteoclasts, are stimulated by the
  action of RANKL signaling pathways and influence osteoclast differentiation and
  bone resorption . C-K, compound K; PNS, Panax notoginseng saponins; OPG, osteoprotegerin;
