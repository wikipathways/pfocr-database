caption: CD40 stimulation stimulates a highly coordinated immune response by epithelial
  cells (ECs). (a) Venn diagram depicting the overlap between 49 signature genes (60
  microarray probes) differentially expressed at 2 and/or 24 hours; L-CD40L stimulation
  versus L-control stimulation with adjusted P-value ⩽0.05 and absolute log2-fold
  change ⩾1. Networks with expression changes at 2 (b) and 24 (c) hours were constructed
  of 49 connected CD40L signature genes using interaction data curated from literature
  and high-throughput screens by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The colors show the degree
  of upregulation (red) or downregulation (green) in the L-CD40L condition versus
  the L-control condition. The genes meeting the adjusted P-value ⩽0.05 and absolute
  log2-fold change ⩾1 thresholds, shown in the Venn diagram in a, are indicated by
  blue borders.
