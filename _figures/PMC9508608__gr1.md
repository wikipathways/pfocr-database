caption: Schematic methionine metabolism (modified according to Parkhitko et al. []).
  The methionine metabolism can be divided into three main parts. In the methionine
  cycle the essential amino acid methionine is converted by methionine adenosyltransferase
  to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a principal methyl donor. SAM can be demethylated
  to S-adenosylhomocysteine and hydrolized to homocysteine by the S-adenosylhomocysteine
  hydrolase. Homocysteine can be either remethylated back to methionine through the
  folate cycle or by betaine homocysteine methyltransferase. Another pathway is the
  transsulfuration of homocysteine. In this route homocysteine is needed for the synthesis
  of l-cystathionine by cystathionine-β-synthase. l-cystathionine can be hydrolyzed
  by the cystathionine-γ-lyase to cysteine, a precursor for taurine, pyruvate and
  glutathione, which is important for the redox balance. As side product of both enzymes,
  hydrogen sulfide is built. Another possibility to regenerate methionine is through
  the salvage pathway. Thereby SAM is decarboxylated and serves as aminopropylgroup
  donor for the synthesis of polyamines like spermidine and spermine. For this synthesis
  putrescine is formed in parallel through arginase and ornithine decarboxylase activity
  and then synthesized to spermine and spermidine. The needed decarboxylated SAM here
  is thereby converted to 5′-methylthioandenosine and synthesized back to methionine.
