caption: Models of the Reconstituted Self-Incompatibility Signaling Pathways in the
  Transgenic A. thaliana  and Sha Ecotypes.(A) In A. thaliana, the basal pollen recognition
  response in the stigmatic papilla leads to activation of vesicle secretion and Exo70A1
  is necessary for this (; ).(B) With self-pollination in the transgenic A. thaliana
  Sha lines, the binding of the pollen SCR ligand to the stigma SRK results in the
  activation of the self-pollen rejection pathway in the stigmatic papilla. SRK recruits
  ARC1, and ARC1 then targets Exo70A1 for ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated Exo70A1 is
  inhibited in its function in directed vesicle secretion (exocytosis), and exocytosis
  is blocked under the point of pollen contact; as a result, secretory vesicles are
  sent to the vacuole for degradation via autophagy (). Some pollen rejection can
  occur when only SCRb and SRKb are expressed (i.e., no ARC1) in the A. thaliana Sha
  ecotype, suggesting that an additional pathway downstream of SRK (?) may be activated
  to promote pollen rejection. This pathway appears to block exocytosis as vesicles
  were found to accumulate in the stigmatic papillar cytoplasm for these lines.(C)
  With self-pollination in the transgenic A. thaliana  lines, there is one key pathway
  downstream of SRK, as when only SCRb and SRKb are expressed (i.e., no ARC1), pollen
  rejection does not occur. When SCRb-SRKb + ARC1 are expressed, a self-incompatible
  response is activated, but it is not as strong as that seen in the A. thaliana Sha
  ecotype, suggesting that another signaling step downstream of SRK is missing or
  has reduced activity. Perhaps the unknown factor has a role in the trafficking of  and
  autophagosomes to the vacuole as this step appears to be impaired in the  transgenic
  plants.
