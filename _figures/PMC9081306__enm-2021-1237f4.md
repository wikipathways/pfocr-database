caption: 'Diagram presenting the hypothesis generated in the present study for the
  effects and mechanism of midodrine on obesity-induced cataracts. Midodrine can prevent
  and cure obesity-induced cataracts through the inhibition of the polyol pathway,
  inflammation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of oxidative
  glycolysis. Meaning of symbols: A blue arrow indicates activation, blue upward and
  horizontal lines indicate inhibition, a red upward arrow indicates elevation, and
  a red X indicates blocking. PPARδ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta;
  AMPK, 5´-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; ATP, adenosine
  5´-triphosphate.'
