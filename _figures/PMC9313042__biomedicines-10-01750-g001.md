caption: IL-18BP Biological Role. Left panel, ① danger stimuli, such as pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), activate
  the Toll-like receptors (TLR) signaling pathway that triggers MyD88, TRAF, inflammasome
  oligomerization that leads to subsequent activation of caspase-1 (Cas1). Consequently,
  the translocation of the NF-κB takes place and leads to ② the production of proinflammatory
  cytokines, including inductions of the transcriptional activation of pro-interleukin
  IL-18 (pro-IL-18), which is proteolytically cleaved and converted to its mature
  active form via the active caspase-1 (Cas1), then ③ IL-18 is secreted from the cell.
  Right panel, ④ when secreted IL-18 binds to the cells expressing IL-18R (mainly
  monocytes, NK cells, and T cells) and activates the respective signaling pathways,
  for example, MAPKs and NF-κB activation, which in turn leads to the ⑤ expression
  of proinflammatory molecules and induce the production of IFNγ. Next, IFNγ activates
  macrophages and allows them to produce inflammatory cytokines. This IFNγ induction
  and the activation cascade of IL-18 is inhibited by its natural neutralizing soluble
  inhibitor, interleukin IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP).
