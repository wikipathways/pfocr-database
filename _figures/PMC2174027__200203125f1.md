caption: Fucosylation pathways in mammals. Two different cytosolic pathways lead to
  formation of GDP–fucose. The constitutively active de novo pathway converts GDP–mannose
  into GDP–fucose via oxidation, epimerization, and reduction catalyzed by two enzymes
  (GMD and FX). The salvage pathway initiates with free fucose, delivered to the cytosol
  from extracellular sources (shown) or from intracellular (lysosomal) sources (not
  depicted). GDP–fucose from this pathway is then transported into the Golgi lumen
  where it is used by fucosyltransferases, whose catalytic domains reside within the
  Golgi lumen. Fucosylation, and other glycosylation events lead to the synthesis
  of cell surface glycoconjugates with structures (highlighted in color) that contribute
  to selectin recognition (), Notch signaling (), interactions between microbes and
  their mammalian hosts (), or to binding by pea lectin (PSA).
