caption: Model summarizing the Tax-1–G-protein interactions. After T-cell infection
  by HTLV-1, Tax-1 induced the expression of several genes, including chemokines,
  that bound to their specific GPCRs. Tax-1 also migrated to the cytoplasm and the
  plasma membrane, bound to the Gβγ heterodimer complex, and regulated specific ligand-receptor
  interaction, T-cell migration, and intracellular G-protein effector activation.
  Tax-1 also affected intracellular Gβγ-effector activation by direct binding to the
  Gβ subunit and by inactivating the G-protein pathway suppressor 2. As a feedback
  loop, Gβγ inhibits HTLV-1 expression and contributes to viral escape from immune
  surveillance.
