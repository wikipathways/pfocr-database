caption: 'Effect of JAK-2 and STAT-3 inhibitions in the regulation of TH17 cell differentiation
  and their consequences. a Shows the signaling of TH17 cells through the JAK-STAT
  pathway without the use of any inhibitors. Binding of IL-6 and IL-23 cytokines cause
  the dimerization of the receptor. This allows JAK-2 a receptor-bound enzyme to phosphorylate
  the tyrosine residues of the receptor for its activation. STAT-3 now interacts with
  the phosphorylated receptor with its SH2 domain and its dimerization occurs. The
  dimer travels to the nucleus and starts acting as a transcription factor. TH17 cell
  differentiation occurs through this mechanism leading to the formation of cytokine
  storm in COVID-19 patients. b Describes the effect of the JAK2 inhibitor on TH17
  cell signaling. No phosphorylation of the receptors would occur in the absence of
  an active JAK2 and hence no STAT activation for transcription. TH17 cell differentiation
  could not occur and the patient may be cured for COVID-19 without the production
  of the cytokine storm. c Shows the effect of STAT-3 inhibitors on signaling of TH17
  cells mediated by IL-6 and IL-23 ligands in the JAK-STAT pathway. Binding of IL-6
  and IL-23 cytokines cause the dimerization of the receptor. This allows JAK-2 a
  receptor-bound enzyme to phosphorylate the tyrosine residues of the receptor for
  its activation. STAT-3 now interacts with the phosphorylated receptor with its SH2
  domain. The use of inhibitors for STAT-3 now prevents STAT dimerization for acting
  as a transcription factor, as a result, no TH17 cell differentiation occurs through
  this mechanism, and no formation of cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. d Describes
  the effect of STAT-3 inhibitors on B cell activation required for the antiviral
  immunity by IL-21 ligand in the JAK-STAT pathway. Binding of IL-21 cytokine causes
  the dimerization of the receptor. This allows JAK-1/3 a receptor-bound enzyme to
  phosphorylate the tyrosine residues of the receptor for its activation. STAT-3 now
  interacts with the phosphorylated receptor with its SH2 domain. The use of inhibitors
  for STAT-3 now prevents STAT dimerization for acting as a transcription factor,
  as a result, no B cell activation occurs through this mechanism, and no formation
  of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The red arrow indicates the target area
  for the action of drugs known as Fedritanib. (Shown in the orange box). Abbreviation:
  IL Interleukin, JAK Janus kinase, STAT signal transducer and activator of transcription,
