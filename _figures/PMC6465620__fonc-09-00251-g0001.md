caption: Schematic representation of m6A function in AML. The MACOM and MAC complex
  components are required for AML survival (see main text for details). (A) RBM15
  protein controls cell expansion and differentiation by regulating c-Myc levels and
  the Notch signaling pathway. In some forms of pediatric AML, RBM15 is fused to MKL1
  and induced leukemia by aberrant regulation of the Notch signaling pathway. (B)
  WTAP protein is upregulated in AML, localized in nuclear speckles, and regulates
  alternative splicing. (C) METTL3 and METTL14 upregulation in AML increases m6A methylation
  of specific mRNAs, including MYC, MYB, PTEN, and BCL2 mRNAs. (D) In addition, METTL3
  is recruited by CEBPZ on specific promoter regions and this results in co-transcriptional
  m6A methylation of different mRNAs, including that one encoding for the SP1 and
  SP2 transcription factors. (E) Increased m6A methylation enhances mRNA translation
  and produced increased protein levels. (F) In AML, METTL3 mis-localizes in the cytoplasm
  where it can increase the translation of specific mRNAs independently from its catalytic
  activity by recruiting eIF3h.
