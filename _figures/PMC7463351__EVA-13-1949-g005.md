caption: 'Differentially expressed genes between highland and lowland maize landraces
  encoding enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis. The lignin biosynthesis pathway
  for maize including metabolic intermediates (light purple rectangles) and genes
  underlying enzymatic steps (white diamonds). p‐coumaroyl‐CoA, the final product
  in the general phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway (Figure ), is the entry point
  into the lignin biosynthesis pathway both through the p‐coumaroyl SA/QA and p‐coumaraldehyde
  routes. Enzyme gene names are as follows: HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA transferase;
  CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; C3H, coumarate‐3‐hydroxylase; CCoA‐OMT, caffeoyl‐coenzyme
  A O‐methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl‐CoA reductase; F5H, ferulate 5‐hydroxylase;
  COMT, cinnamate‐4‐hydroxylase. Full circles represent log2fold changes of 2.11 (i.e.,
  4.32 times higher expression); partially filled circles represent up‐regulation
  to a portion of 4.32 times. Enzyme gene names with multiple circles next to them
  represent multiple genes encoding that type of enzyme—cross‐reference Figure  and
  Table  for associated gene names and log2fold change values, respectively. Genes
  were considered differentially expressed when significant at a 0.05 FDR rate using
  a Benjamini–Hochberg correction. The CCoA‐OMT differentially expressed was OMT3'
