caption: Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neurotrophin
  signaling pathways by microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with mild traumatic brain injury
  (mTBI). Network diagram showing miRNAs associated with TBI from plasma or extracellular
  vesicles (EVs) targeting mRNAs of the VEGF and neurotrophin signaling pathway, including
  downstream signaling effectors that regulate key biological processes associated
  with these pathways. miRNAs (yellow diamonds) are shown regulating plasma targets
  (blue edges and nodes), EV targets (red edges and nodes), or targets identified
  in both plasma and EV (purple edges and nodes). Color image is available online.
