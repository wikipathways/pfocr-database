caption: The role of the CX3CL1–CX3CR1 signaling pathway in the pathology of schizophrenia.
  In physiological conditions, the interaction of CX3CL1 with CX3CR1 is essential
  for the regulation of multiple processes in the brain. The disturbances within this
  axis and subsequent disruptions within these mechanisms implicate the CX3CL1–CX3CR1
  dyad in schizophrenia
