caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of deregulated proteins related to the axis
  of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGF receptor (EGFR) in human dermal fibroblasts
  (HDFs) treated with Endoret serum (ES) extract. (A) The IPA upstream regulator analysis
  suggests that several HDF proteins deregulated with the ES treatment were related
  to the activation by EGF. (B) IPA downstream analysis also showed that numerous
  deregulated proteins were associated with an induction of the proliferation of fibroblasts.
  (C) Overall, when the upstream and downstream processes were correlated, a relationship
  between the EGF–EGFR axis and proliferation of HDFs treated with ES was found.
