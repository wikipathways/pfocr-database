caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed increase in resting skeletal
  muscle fat metabolism (red arrows), gene networks (shaded areas) and expression
  of highly significant genes (FDR < 1%; highlighted in yellow) following 12 weeks
  of carnitine and carbohydrate supplementation (Carnitine) compared with carbohydrate
  supplementation alone (Control). [1] An increase in skeletal muscle carnitine content
  increases carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and fatty acid flux within skeletal
  muscle, reflected by an increase in long-chain acyl-CoA content. This suggestion
  is supported by an increase in ‘PPAR signalling’ and ‘fatty acid metabolism’ gene
  networks (red shaded area), and increases in gene expression of PNPLA2 and CPT1B,
  which encode rate-limiting steps in intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) hydrolysis and
  fatty acid oxidation, respectively. [2] We have previously demonstrated that the
  resulting carnitine-mediated increase in fatty acid flux and β-oxidation acutely
  inhibits carbohydrate oxidation at the level of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
  complex (). The present study suggests that chronic regulation at the level of PDH
  with prolonged elevation of muscle carnitine content likely occurs via increased
  fatty acid flux increasing PDK2 gene expression directly, or via increased forkhead
  box class O transcription factor (FOXO3) gene expression. [3] Whether increased
  fatty acid flux and a IMCL hydrolysis resulted in reduced fatty acid metabolite
  accumulation and improved insulin sensitivity [4] in the face of overfeeding in
  the present study requires further investigation, particularly as the ‘insulin signalling
  pathway’ was the most significantly upregulated gene network (blue shaded area).
