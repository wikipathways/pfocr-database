caption: The major mechanisms to induce ketosis. (1) After glycogen stores are exhausted
  during prolonged fasting, lower levels of circulating insulin signals lipolysis
  of endogenous adipose, resulting in a rise in circulating free fatty acids, and
  ketogenesis. Fatty acids are transported into liver mitochondria for synthesis of
  the ketone bodies acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone to a lesser degree.
  Ketone bodies are transported out of the mitochondria via monocarboxylate transporters
  (MCT) 1 and 2, enter circulation, and enter extra-hepatic mitochondria via the same
  MCT 1 and 2 for ketolysis. Ketone bodies are retroconverted to acetyl CoA, enter
  the citric acid (TCA) cycle for ATP production, and the resulting NADH and FADH2
  facilitate energy production via the electron transport chain (ETC). (2) The KD’s
  exogenous fat substrate and restricted carbohydrate initiates an action similar
  to fasting by increasing circulating fatty acids and reduced insulin. During a KD,
  both exogenous and endogenous fatty acids are destined for ketogenesis. (3) Medium
  chain triglycerides are gastrointestinally digested to medium chain fatty acids,
  absorb across the intestinal lumen, and rapidly enter the liver via the portal vein,
  bypassing the lymphatic system and peripheral circulation. Medium chain fatty acids
  enter the ketogenesis pathway at the level of acetyl CoA. (4) Exogenous β-hydroxybutyrate
  esters are cleaved into β-hydroxybutyrate and 1,3 butanediol by local gut esterases.
  Both products enter the liver via the portal vein, enter mitochondria at the β-hydroxybutyrate
  or acetoacetate level of ketogenesis, and enter circulation as β-hydroxybutyrate
  or acetoacetate.
