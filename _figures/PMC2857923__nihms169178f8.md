caption: The manner in which caveolae could allow for specific signaling for receptors
  that are coupled to both Gα q which activates PLCβ generating increased intracellular
  Ca2+, and Gαi which inhibits adenylyl cyclase (not shown) decreasing the cellular
  level of cAMP. These differences are also impacted by the release of Gβγ from caveolae
  domains following Gα q activation, thereby increasing the response of Gβγ-coupled
  effectors.
