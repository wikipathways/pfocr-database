caption: Schematic depiction of the main metabolic pathways, with potential compounds
  and their respective targets for antiviral metabolic interference. The graphic shows
  the dynamic network of some of the most important metabolic pathways (glycolysis,
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway [HBP], pentose phosphate pathway [PPP], tricarboxylic
  acid [TCA] cycle, oxidative phosphorylation [OXPHOS], glutaminolysis and fatty acid
  synthesis [FAS]) in eukaryotic cells, which were shown to be altered and exploited
  during viral infections. Potential antiviral metabolic inhibitors are indicated
  along with those respiratory viruses they have been demonstrated to inhibit. Created
