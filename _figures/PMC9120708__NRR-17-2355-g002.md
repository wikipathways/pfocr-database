caption: 'Receptors and transporters mediate Aβ transport across the blood-brain barrier.①
  By binding to PICALM, the Aβ-LRP1 complex is integrated into a clathrin-coated pit
  and then cleared from the brain via transcytosis or directed to lysosome for degradation.
  ② Aβ-apoE2 or Aβ-apoE3 complex binds to LRP1 and forms endophagocytic vesicles,
  which are then discharged at the plasma membrane on the other side of the endothelial
  cell via transcytosis. ③ Aβ-apoE4 complex interacts with very low density lipoprotein
  receptor (VLDLR) and is slowly endocytosed, then cleared from the endothelial cells
  by transcytosis. ④ Aβ-clusterin complex can bind to LRP2 receptor on both sides
  of the endothelial cell membrane for bidirectional transport, but LRP2 is usually
  occupied by clusterin rather than Aβ-clusterin complex on the luminal side, so the
  net flow is Aβ outflow. ⑤ FcRn mediates IgG-Aβ transport from the brain into blood
  via transcytosis. ⑥ Luminally expressed RAGE binds to circulating Aβ and transcytoses
  it from blood to the brain. Both FcRn- and RAGE-mediated Aβ clearance may be involved
  in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. ⑦ P-gp may assist LRP1-mediated Aβ transport
  and pump Aβ directly into the blood from the lumenal side of endothelial cells.
  P-gp and BCRP also assist in the excretion of circulating Aβ transported by RAGE
  into endothelial cells. ⑧ ABCA1 does not directly mediate Aβ trafficking across
  the BBB; it promotes proteolytic degradation of Aβ in the brain parenchyma and affects
  the clearance of Aβ across the BBB by regulating lipogenation of apoE. ⑨ LRP1 first
  mediates Aβ endocytosis, and then Aβ is transported from the abluminal side to the
  luminal side of the endothelial cells. Subsequently, P-gp and ABCC1 export Aβ from
  the luminal membrane of endothelial cells to the systemic circulation. ApoE: apolipoprotein
  E; Aβ: amyloid-beta; BCRP(ABCG2): breast cancer resistance protein; LRP: low density
  lipoprotein receptor(LDLR)-related protein; P-gp: P-glycoprotein; PICALM: phosphatidylinositol
