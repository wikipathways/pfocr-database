caption: The NO/cGMP pathway is a signaling node for pro- and anti-angiogenic signaling.
  In addition to VEGF, angiopoietin-1, estrogens, and insulin can activate eNOS to
  increase NO synthesis in endothelial cells. TSP1 signaling via CD36 and CD47 inhibits
  downstream elements of this pathway. Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) is another known ligand
  of CD36 that could inhibit angiogenesis via an overlapping pathway. In addition,
  oxLDL signaling inhibits protein kinase Cα, which phosphorylates eNOS at Thr495
  and activates NADPH oxidase (NOX), and the resulting superoxide depletes NO levels.
  The angiogenesis inhibitors endostatin and vasoinhibins activate the phosphatase
  PP2A, which dephosphorylates and thereby inactivates eNOS.
