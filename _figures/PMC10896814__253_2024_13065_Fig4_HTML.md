caption: Postulated alkylresorcinol pathway in members of the phylum Planctomycetota
  and Hierridin biosynthesis pathway in Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06113. The reaction steps
  leading to alkylresorcinols including relevant co-substrates and products are depicted
  for the postulated alkylresorcinol pathway in members of the phylum Planctomycetota.
  The Hierridin biosynthetic pathway identified in Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06113 is shown
  for comparison. n = 14 or 16 for the planctomycetal pathway and n = 14 for the picocyanobacterial
  pathway. SAM, S-adenosyl methionine; SAH, S-adenosyl homocysteine
