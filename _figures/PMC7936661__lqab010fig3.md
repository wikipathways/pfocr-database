caption: Schematic representation of short loop commonality and a landscape of short
  loop commonality among proteins with mutations in the AML PPIN. (A) ‘Short loop
  commonality’ is defined as the association of proteins having the same or similar
  short loop interactions, but not involving direct interaction of the proteins themselves.
  For example, X forms short loops with AB, BC and CD pairs and Y also forms short
  loops with AB, BC and CD but there is no direct interaction between X and Y. The
  short loop commonality pair of X and Y is annotated with a symbol of a loop (∞).
  (B andC) Short loop commonality, similarity of short loops between proteins, was
  calculated by comparing sets of protein interacting partner pairs for all proteins
  in the AML PPIN. In total 183 proteins (shown in light blue circles) account for
  224 pairs of short loop commonality, which are annotated as line edges with a loop
  (∞) symbol. Functional enrichment of each cluster was measured by ClueGO () and
  nodes are coloured when proteins have enriched functional terms in the cluster.
  Detailed protein pairs and enriched functional terms are listed in . (B) Among the
  commonality pairs, a cluster consists of proteins involved in the PI3K pathway.
  This cluster can be divided into two subsets enriched with the RTK proteins (e.g.
  FLT3, KIT, ERBB2, PDGFRB and MET (right)) and their short loop interacting partners
  (e.g. PIK3R1, PTPRJ, PTPN11, CBL and CBLB (left)). Nodes with double border lines
  are druggable or potentially druggable proteins predicted by DGIdb () and edges
  are annotated in double red lines when a commonality pair has common drug interactions.
  The whole short loop commonality networks in the AML PPIN are available in a Cytoscape
  file format (ShortLoop_Commonality_leukaemia.cys) uploaded in (https://github.com/suns-chung/ShortLoopCommonality/).
