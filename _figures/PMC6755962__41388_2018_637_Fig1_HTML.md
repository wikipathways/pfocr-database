caption: Adipocytes represent a central player in the creation of the metabolic tumor
  microenvironment in the omentum during ovarian cancer metastasis. Adipocytes are
  reprogrammed into cancer-associated adipocytes by cancer-derived mediators. These
  activated adipocytes release a wealth of lipids and various adipokines, including
  IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and TIMP-1, which contribute to the establishment of the omental
  metastatic niche for ovarian cancer. FABP4, which is an intracellular chaperone
  for free fatty acids, regulates lipolysis in adipocytes and β-oxidation in ovarian
  cancer cells, and plays a crucial role in the interaction of ovarian cancer cells
  with adipocytes, promoting omental metastasis. In addition, omental adipocytes induce
  the calcium-dependent activation and autophosphorylation of SIK2 in ovarian cancer
  cells and activate cancer cell proliferation through the PI3K/AKT pathway. SIK2
  can increase ovarian cancer cell fatty acid oxidation by augmenting AMPK-induced
  ACC phosphorylation and activating CPT1 during peritoneal disseminated metastasis.
  Thus, the highly orchestrated crosstalk between ovarian cancer cells and omental
  adipocytes induces metabolic synergies by reprogramming fatty acid metabolism and
  tumor-promoting signaling pathways that enhance the proliferation, invasion, and
  metastatic progression of ovarian cancer cells with specific metastatic tropism
  for the omentum
