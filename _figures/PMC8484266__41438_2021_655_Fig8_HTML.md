caption: As a transcriptional regulator, overexpression of MdVQ37 can affect the transcriptional
  activity of multiple TFs, and indirectly up-regulated the expression of SA catabolism
  genes MdS5H1 and MdS5H2. This causes reduction in endogenous SA content and disruption
  in SA-dependent signaling pathways. Moreover, increased expression of MdVQ37 also
  resulted in unknown signal pathway. All of these changes resulted in higher ROS
  accumulation and lower photosynthetic capacity, and reduced basal thermotolerance
  under HT stress
