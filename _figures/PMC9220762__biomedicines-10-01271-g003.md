caption: GR, MR and AR signaling pathways in non-epithelial cells. (A) Balanced transcriptional
  activation signaling pathways with normal receptors. (B) Increased activation of
  the MR signaling pathway with expression of MR rs5522 and GR rs143711342/rs56149945.
  (C) Pathological effects of AR inhibition by enzalutamide on the MR signaling pathway
  in cells expressing MR rs5522 and GR rs143711342/rs56149945.
