caption: Schematic drawing of the σEsignaling pathway. As stress sensor proteins,
  DegS protease is activated by the binding of the OMP C-terminus, and RseB is relieved
  from RseA by the accumulation of LPS in the periplasm. RseA is sequentially digested
  by DegS and ClpP, thereby releasing σE in the cytoplasm. Finally, σE along with
  RNA polymerase can induce the transcription of the htrA gene and other heat shock-relate
  genes.
