caption: The hypothetical metabolic pathway responsible for the enrichment of flavonoids
  is involved in M. For the whole, the compound frame in red represents up-regrated
  relative content, the compound frame in tawny represents the down-regrated relative
  content, while the substances without frames are the intermediate metabolites in
  the metabolic pathway. The green line and frame represent flavone and flavonol biosynthesis;
  the blue line and frame represent flavonoid biosynthesis; the yellow line and frame
  represent anthocyanin biosynthesis. (For interpretation of the references to colour
  in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
