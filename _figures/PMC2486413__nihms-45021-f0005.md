caption: Schematic representation summarizing the results on ethanol-induced c-fos
  expression and its interaction with the ERK1/2 kinase signaling pathway in brain
  regions related to the extended amygdala (adapted from()). Only those regions are
  shown that react in non-dependent rats (left) with increased c-fos to an acute ethanol
  challenge. Under non-dependent conditions, ethanol-induced c-fos expression was
  generally not affected by MEK inhibition, with the exception of the MeA (red circles),
  and to a lesser extend the PVN. Post-dependent rats (right) show reduced c-fos induction
  in the prefrontal cortex (Cg, IL, OFC) and the PVN upon ethanol challenge (indicated
  by short bold arrows) compared to non-dependent controls which probably is a correlate
  of tolerance to the drug. UO126 markedly increased c-fos expression in OFC and AcbSh,
  key components of circuitry mediating positive drug reinforcement, demonstrating
  a recruitment of an ERK mediated inhibitory regulation in the post-dependent state.
  Thus, positive MEK/ERK-ethanol interactions are related to the central division
  and negative interactions to the medial division of the extended amygdala. Beside
  anatomical evidences of a division of the extended amygdala into a central- and
  medial part (; ) our results support the idea of a corresponding functional divisions,
  i.e. devaluation of ethanol as a reinforcer and tolerance to its aversive actions,
  respectively, which may both take part in the development of ethanol dependence.
  Brain regions anatomically or functionally related to the central or the medial
  divisions of the extended amygdala are colored in yellow or in blue, respectively,
  and their efferents/afferents are indicated as arrows with respective color. Black
  arrows indicate other connections between the regions. For abbreviations see , and
  for details on treatment, see Material and Methods. 1(), 2(), 3(), 4(), 5(), 6(),
