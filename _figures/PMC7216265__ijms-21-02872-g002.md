caption: miRNAs affect glutaminolysis in cancer. Several miRNAs regulate proteins
  involved in transport or metabolism of glutamine. GLS is regulated by miR-122, -203,
  -23b, -23a, -513c, -153 and -137; while, miR-103-3p regulates GLS2. Moreover, miR-140-5p
  negatively regulates GS expression. GOT1 protein is posttranscriptional affected
  by miR-9 and -9-5p, while transporter ASCT2 translation is decreased via miR-122
  and -137. Autophagy components such as autophagy related 13 and 8 (ATG13, ATG8)
  are suppressed through miR-133a-3p, blocking glutamine recycling. Additionally,
  the c-Myc transcription factor is inhibited by miR-145, affecting the expression
  of its targets, including GLS, ASCT, SNAT5, LAT1, miR-105, miR-23b and -23a. Furthermore,
  cancer cells secrete miR-105 in the extracellular vesicles (EV) reaching cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAF), where miR-105 promotes MAX interactor 1 (MXI1) mRNA degradation
  and subsequently induces the activation of glutaminolysis-related genes through
  the c-Myc/c-Myc associated factor X (MAX) transcriptional complex. Finally, p65
  and methyl-CpG binding protein (MeCP2)/DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) negatively regulate
  miR-23a and miR-137, respectively, affecting the glutaminolysis pathway.
