caption: This pathway was assembled using Pathway Architect (Stratagene) to identify
  potentially regulated transcription factors likely to be affected by PDGF receptor
  stimulation. Each pathway is supported by at least one publication from the scientific
  literature (not shown). (B) Proposed regulatory network. PDGF signalling, inhibited
  by Tyrphostin AG-370, induces specific transcription factors (identified in panel
  A), in turn regulating both osteogenic target mRNA genes and a specific set of microRNAs,
  including let-7, miR-24, miR-125b, and miR-138. Increased levels of those microRNAs
  are predicted to inhibit translation of non-osteogenic target mRNAs to diminish
  their inhibition of osteogenesis.
