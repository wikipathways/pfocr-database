caption: The actions of thyroid hormones (THs) and their corresponding receptors.
  (A) Genomic actions of the TH/thyroid hormone receptor (TR). In the absence or presence
  of TH, TR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers bind to thyroid hormone response
  elements (TREs). Unliganded TRs associate with corepressors that repress gene transcription.
  Binding of T3 causes corepressor release, coactivator recruitment, and transcriptional
  activation. (B) Non-genomic actions of the TH. (a) The TH interacts with the integrin
  receptor and activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/phospholipase
  C (PLC)/protein kinase Cα (PKCα) cascade, which upregulates cell proliferation.
  U-87 MG cells, glioma cells; CV-1 cells, fibroblast cell lines that lacks functional
  TRs; HUVEC cells, endothelial cells; HepG2 cells, hepatoma cell line. (b) The T3
  interacts with the αvβ3 and enhances the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway,
  leading to direct trafficking of TRα1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and promotes
  hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) expression. (c) In the cytoplasm, the liganded
  TRβ1 associates with the PI3K regulatory subunit, p85α, and activates Akt/mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis. Consequently, these events regulate gene expression,
  including HIF1α and glycolytic genes. (d) T3 interacts with plasma membrane-associated
  truncated TRα1 and induces the NO-cGMP-PKGII cascade. Subsequently, this cascade
  initiates Src/MEK/ERK/PI3K/Akt signaling, which results in induced cell proliferation
  and survival. The cell lines used in each pathway were shown. The schematic diagram
  summarizes the findings mentioned in the text including the types of cell lines
  and animal models. (C) TH/TR-mediated cell growth and cell cycle progression via
  specific signaling pathway are shown. OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway. (D) TH/TR-mediated cell metastasis, angiogenesis, self-renewal
  ability, and drug resistance via specific signaling pathway are shown. (E) TH/TR-mediated
  tumor growth and tumor metastasis in murine model are shown. Euthyroid, control;
  hypothyroid, low T3 levels; hyperthyroid, high T3 levels. For a detailed description,
  please see in the corresponding section.
