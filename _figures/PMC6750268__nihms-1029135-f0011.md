caption: Diagram of pathways by which dLAN regulates resistance to paclitaxel via
  activation of the IL-6/STAT3/DNMT1 pathway to methylate the ARHI promoter and inhibit
  ARHI mRNA expression, and how circadian MLT can induce SIRT1 to block the IL-6/STAT3/DNMT1
  pathway to allowing ARHI expression and paclitaxel sensitivity in breast cancer.
  Included in this diagram is the interplay between STAT3’s reported induction of
  aerobic glycolysis in tumor metabolism (Warburg effect) and the ability of the Warburg
  effect to also drive expression of the activation of the STAT3 oncogene.
