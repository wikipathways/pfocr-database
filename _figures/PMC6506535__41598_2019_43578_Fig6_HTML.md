caption: T helper cell differentiation pathway of MAIT cells in comparison with conventional
  T cells. IPA analysis of DEGs of MAIT cells in comparison with conventional T cells
  showed a functionally activated MAIT cell signaling pathway in association with
  the role of the T helper cell differentiation pathway. The T helper cell differentiation
  pathway changed significantly in MAIT cells as the Th17 phenotype increased. Additionally,
  the RORγt transcription factor was greatly increased, and the IL23 receptor was
  also increased. The strong expression of Th17 lineage-related RORγt and related
  genes, such as IL-23R, was significantly upregulated in MAIT cells. These results
  strongly suggest that MAIT cells possess innate cell characteristics and Th17-associated
  adaptive T cell characteristics.
