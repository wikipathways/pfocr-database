caption: Figure 1. Proposed interaction of VIM, NOD2 and the autophagy pathway during
  the invasion of host cells by AIEC. VIM expressed on the surface of host cells acts
  as a receptor for AIEC. The interaction of VIM and NOD2 at the plasma membrane allows
  NOD2 to engage with pathogens and signal an appropriate inflammatory response (through
  NFKB1) and antimicrobial response (through recruitment of ATG16L1). Internalized
  pathogens are trafficked along the cytoskeletal network via the autophagy pathway
  to lysosomes for degradation.
