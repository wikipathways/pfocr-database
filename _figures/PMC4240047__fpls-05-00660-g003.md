caption: Plant innate immunity vs. Plant adaptive immunity. Following entry into a
  host cell and genome decapsidation, the virus genome is liberated and replicated,
  leading to the accumulation of pathogenic nucleic acids that are perceived as viral
  PAMPs by specific intracellular PRRs. This recognition triggers a downstream cascade
  leading to PTI responses. Virus genome translation (occurring simultaneous to replication)
  leads to the synthesis of the virus-encoded proteins, among which viral pathogenic
  effectors enable the suppression of PTI signaling. In turn, specific plant R genes
  interact (directly or indirectly) with these effectors (that are then called avirulence
  factors) to trigger ETI. In the case of plant adaptive immunity illustrated by RNA
  interference (RNAi), the virus-derived elicitor molecules, corresponding to replicative
  dsRNAs or structured (str-RNA) viral genomes, are recognized by DCLs, key component
  of the silencing machinery that leads to virus degradation at the nucleic acid level.
  Viral proteins acting as RNAi-suppressing effectors interfere with this defense
  pathway. A recent publication () suggests silencing suppressors may be targeted
  by ETI-like mechanisms, restoring plant resistance. The main steps of the virus
  cycle into the first infected cell have been mentioned into gray boxes.
