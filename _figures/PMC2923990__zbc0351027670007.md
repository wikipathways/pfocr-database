caption: The model for C. albicans-induced signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation.
  The hyphal form of C. albicans recognizes Dectin-2, whereas yeast and β-glucans,
  such as zymosan, activate Dectin-1. Although both Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 pathways
  are required for Syk that regulates IKK phosphorylation, CARD9 and Bcl10 are selectively
  involved in Dectin-2-induced signaling cascades leading to regulation of NEMO ubiquitination.
  The phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IKK in the Dectin-2-induced signaling
  pathway are required for activation of the IKK complex for NF-κB activation. LPS
  and other TLR ligands activate NF-κB through a MyD88-dependent but CARD9-independent
  pathway.
