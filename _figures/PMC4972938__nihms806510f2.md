caption: One of the main metabolic pathways of dietary L-tryptophan (L-Trp) in the
  brain is the kynurenine pathway (KP). The rate-limiting step of this pathway is
  the conversion of L-Trp to L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)
  and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). Through three pathways L-kynurenine is converted
  into kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and anthranilic acid (ANA).
  The next step of the pathway is the conversion of 3-HK and ANA into 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid (3-HAA). 3-HAA, through several enzimatic reactions is converted into the final
  kynurenine pathway products picolinic acid (PIC) and quinolinic acid (QUIN). Finally,
  QUIN generates nicotinamide, and ultimately NAD+/NADP+
