caption: The mammalian Hippo pathway in cell cycle control. (A) The regulation of
  the cell cycle machinery by the Hippo pathway. The intra-cell cycle regulation is
  indicated by black arrows, and the regulation of Hippo pathway on the cell cycle
  elements is shown in blue arrows. Without the mitogenic signal, the cells enter
  the quiescent state, G0. With the stimulation of the mitogenic signal, the cells
  enter the G1 and continue the cell cycle progression. In G1, Cyclin D-CDK4/6 and
  Cyclin E-CDK2 phosphorylate pRb to dissociate it from E2F. Activated E2F transcribes
  cell cycle-related genes and facilitates the passing through of the cells to the
  R point. The INK4 family inhibits the activity of Cyclin D-CDK4/6. The Cip/Kip family
  suppresses both Cyclin D-CDK4/6 and Cyclin E-CDK2. Cyclin E-CDK2 and Cyclin A-CDK2
  are required to initiate DNA synthesis and control DNA replication during the S
  phase. In G2, Cyclin A-CDK1, together with Cdc25 and PLK1, activates Cyclin B-CDK1
  for mitotic entry. Cyclin B-CDK1, PLK1, and Aurora A/B are the key kinases for mitosis.
  The Hippo components are highly involved in regulating the activities of CDKs, CDK
  inhibitors, DNA synthesis factors, and other cell cycle kinases as well as phosphatases
  to control cell cycle progression, as illustrated by the blue sharp arrows (activation)
  and blue blunt arrows (inhibition). (B) The regulation of the cell cycle checkpoints
  by the Hippo pathway. As indicated in A, there are tetraploidy checkpoints in G1,
  spindle assembly checkpoints in mitosis, and DNA damage checkpoints throughout the
  cell cycle. The cell cycle checkpoints monitor the order and accuracy of the cell
  cycle, and the Hippo pathway components can strengthen (sharp arrow) or weaken (blunt
  arrow) the checkpoints to regulate the cell cycle process.
