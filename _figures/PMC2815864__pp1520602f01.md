caption: Alternative metabolic models for the subcellular compartmentation of the
  PPP. A, Oxidative and nonoxidative reactions of the PPP confined to the plastid.
  B, Oxidative steps of the PPP in both the cytosol and plastid, with the nonoxidative
  steps in the plastid. C, The complete pathway in both compartments. Net and exchange
  fluxes are shown with unidirectional and bidirectional arrows, respectively, and
  the direction of a unidirectional arrow corresponds to a positive flux in the output
  of the model. Flux names are given in italics, and the pentose phosphates are grouped
  into a single indistinguishable pool in all three models. Ery-4-P, Erythrose 4-phosphate;
  Rbu-5-P, ribulose 5-phosphate; Sed-7-P, sedoheptulose 7-phosphate; TA-C3, the three-carbon
  substituted enzyme intermediate in the reaction catalyzed by TA; TK-C2, the two-carbon
  substituted enzyme intermediate in the reaction catalyzed by TK; Xlu-5-P, xylulose
  5-phosphate.
