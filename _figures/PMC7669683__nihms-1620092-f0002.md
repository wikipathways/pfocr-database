caption: Based on their distinct expression pattern and nonredundant functionality,
  CD73 along with other molecules of adenosinergic pathway (e.g.CD39, A2AR and A2BR)
  can be targeted together to achieve synergy in antitumor efficacy by modulating
  both tumor cells and immune cells (e.g. T cells) in many ways. In addition, CD73
  expression and activity seem to be upregulated to confer tumor resistance to therapies.
  Thus, targeting CD73 with blocking antibodies or small molecule inhibitors in combination
  with other therapies such as immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive T cell therapy,
  agonistic immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy is a rational strategy
  to enhance therapeutic benefit in various cancers. The different combination therapies
  involving inhibition of CD73 and/or A2AR are already under evaluation in early phase
  clinical trials.
