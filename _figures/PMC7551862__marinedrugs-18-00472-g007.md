caption: FO promotes bone formation and growth by activating the IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling
  pathway. FO upregulates growth-promoting genes such as insulin-like growth factor
  1 (IGF-1), thereby promoting the release of IGF in osteoblast cells. The secreted
  IGF-1 binds to its specific receptor, IGF-1R, in an autocrine or paracrine manner
  and subsequently triggers the downstream signaling pathway. Once the IGF-1/IGF-1R
  complex is formed, it initiates the GSK-3β phosphorylation at Ser9. Phosphorylated
  GSK-3β subsequently releases RUNX2, which in turn promotes bone formation and growth.
  FO, fermented oyster (C. gigas) extract; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor;
  GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; RUNX2, runt-related transcription factor 2.
