caption: Involvement of cellular metabolism in the process of plasmablast differentiation
  in SLE. The glucose metabolic pathway consists of the glycolytic system, which converts
  glucose to pyruvate, and oxidative phosphorylation, which generates energy via the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In the mitochondria, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA,
  which enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Energy is also generated by glutamine
  metabolism. During anaerobic metabolism, pyruvate is converted into lactate. The
  essential amino acid methionine is strongly committed to plasmablast differentiation.
  In the presence of methionine, mTORC1 activation induces the expression of the methyltransferase
  enhancer zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). EZH2 induces H3K27me3 at BTB and CNC homolog 2
  (BACH2) loci and suppresses BACH2 expression, leading to the induction of B lymphocyte-induced
  maturation protein-1 (BLIMP1) and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) expression and
  plasmablast differentiation. Metformin inhibited CpG- and IFN-α-induced glutamine
  uptake, mitochondrial function, and suppressed plasmablast differentiation. Enhanced
  cellular metabolism mediated by amino acids, such as methionine and glutamine, is
  important for plasmablast differentiation, which may be a potential therapeutic
  target for SLE.
