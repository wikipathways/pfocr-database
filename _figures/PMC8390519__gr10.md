caption: A schematic representation of the catalytic cycle of bovine CcO based on
  the X-ray structures of the catalytic intermediate forms of bovine CcO. The O2 reduction
  site includes Fea3, CuB and Tyr244OH group. When the R-form is attained (A), the
  Fea32+ receives O2 to yield the A-form providing a weak interaction between CuB1+
  and the bound O2, which is displayed by the absence of any line between CuB1+ and
  the O2 (B). The present OxyMb-type structure supports the weak interaction between
  O2 and CuB1+ in the A-form, which has been proposed by resonance Raman and X-ray
  structural analyses (, , ). The A-form is relaxed into the P-form in which the bound
  O2 has been completely reduced, giving Fea34+ = O2−, CuB2+-OH−, and Tyr244 radical
  with a hydrogen-bonded water (the interstitial water) (C). During the P→F transition,
  the Tyr244 radical is transformed to Tyr244OH by a proton-coupled electron transfer.
  The red arrow in (C) marks the substrate proton transfer pathway from D-pathway
  to the Tyr244 radical through the OH− group at the CuB2+, the O2− at the Fea34+,
  and the interstitial water. (The bent structure of HisN-Fea34+ = O2− of the P-form
  () is illustrated schematically in C.) The second proton-coupled electron transfer
  to Fea34+ = O2− of the F-form from the D-pathway via the OH− group, as illustrated
  by a red arrow in (D), forms the O-form (E). The low-barrier hydrogen bonds between
  Fea34+ = O2− and CuB2+-OH− in both the P- and F-forms are shown by thick dotted
  lines in C and D. The unusually long distance between CuB2+ and OH− is illustrated
  by deleting any lines between them (E). In the O to E transition (E to F), the substrate
  protons are transferred from K-pathway to the OH− group near the CuB2+ through the
  interstitial water and the OH− group at the Fea33+ (E), giving CuB1+-H2O (F) as
  illustrated by red arrows (E). In the O- and E-forms, normal hydrogen bonds are
  detectable between the two oxygen atoms as illustrated by thin dotted lines (E and
  F). The forth proton-coupled electron transfer through K-pathway and the interstitial
  water illustrated by a red arrow (F) regenerates the R-form (A), releasing two water
  molecules. The interstitial water molecules, hydrogen-bonded to Tyr244, in C–F could
  be transferred reversibly from a storage site near the O2-reduction site, not from
  the bulk water phase.

  description: A schematic representation of the catalytic cycle of bovine CcO based
    on the X-ray structures of the catalytic intermediate forms of bovine CcO. The
    O2 reduction site includes Fea3, CuB and Tyr244OH group. When the R-form is attained
    (A), the Fea32+ receives O2 to yield the A-form providing a weak interaction between
    CuB1+ and the bound O2, which is displayed by the absence of any line between
    CuB1+ and the O2 (B). The present OxyMb-type structure supports the weak interaction
    between O2 and CuB1+ in the A-form, which has been proposed by resonance Raman
    and X-ray structural analyses (, , ). The A-form is relaxed into the P-form in
    which the bound O2 has been completely reduced, giving Fea34+ = O2−, CuB2+-OH−,
    and Tyr244 radical with a hydrogen-bonded water (the interstitial water) (C).
    During the P→F transition, the Tyr244 radical is transformed to Tyr244OH by a
    proton-coupled electron transfer. The red arrow in (C) marks the substrate proton
    transfer pathway from D-pathway to the Tyr244 radical through the OH− group at
    the CuB2+, the O2− at the Fea34+, and the interstitial water. (The bent structure
    of HisN-Fea34+ = O2− of the P-form () is illustrated schematically in C.) The
    second proton-coupled electron transfer to Fea34+ = O2− of the F-form from the
    D-pathway via the OH− group, as illustrated by a red arrow in (D), forms the O-form
    (E). The low-barrier hydrogen bonds between Fea34+ = O2− and CuB2+-OH− in both
    the P- and F-forms are shown by thick dotted lines in C and D. The unusually long
    distance between CuB2+ and OH− is illustrated by deleting any lines between them
    (E). In the O to E transition (E to F), the substrate protons are transferred
    from K-pathway to the OH− group near the CuB2+ through the interstitial water
    and the OH− group at the Fea33+ (E), giving CuB1+-H2O (F) as illustrated by red
    arrows (E). In the O- and E-forms, normal hydrogen bonds are detectable between
    the two oxygen atoms as illustrated by thin dotted lines (E and F). The forth
    proton-coupled electron transfer through K-pathway and the interstitial water
    illustrated by a red arrow (F) regenerates the R-form (A), releasing two water
    molecules. The interstitial water molecules, hydrogen-bonded to Tyr244, in C–F
    could be transferred reversibly from a storage site near the O2-reduction site,
    not from the bulk water phase.
