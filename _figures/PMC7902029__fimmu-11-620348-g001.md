caption: Overview of the sphingolipid (SL) rheostat model and the interplay with specialized
  pro-resolving mediator (SPM) metabolism. Ceramide can be synthesized by ceramide
  synthases via the de novo and the salvage pathway from sphingosine or by hydrolysis
  of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinase. Once generated, ceramide can act as substrate
  for other sphingolipids such as sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) via
  sphingosine kinase (SK). S1P can be catabolized into hexadecenal + phospho-ethanolamine
  by the action of sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase. Alternatively, SK can generate N-acetyl
  sphingosine via acetyl-CoA and sphingosine, followed by the acetylation of COX-2.
  In turn, this activates COX-2 mediated 15-HETE, 18-HEPE and 17-HDHA production,
  which can be converted to SPMs like such as 15R-LXA4, RvE1, and RvD1, thereby providing
  a direct link between the SL and SPM pathways.
