caption: 'The core mechanism of autophagy and related kinases affect the signaling
  pathway. Autophagy is initiated by energy stress signals from AMPK, which ultimately
  activate VPS34. The VPS34 complex generates PI3P on the membrane, facilitating the
  recruitment and assembly of the ubiquitin-like coupling system. During the lipidation
  of LC3, ATG7, ATG3, and the ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L complexes function as ubiquitin enzymes,
  which can load cargo receptors such as SQSTM1/P62 and NBR. The transport of autophagosomes
  and late endosomes/lysosomes is closely coordinated with the recruitment of binding
  factors; HOPS complexes can be recruited by ARL8 or the ORP1L-RAB7-RILP complex,
  thereby achieving the coupling of anterograde and retrograde transport as well as
  fusion events. The PKC isoenzyme PKCε is associated with autophagy, and its deletion
  mitigates the increase in autophagy induced by the depletion of Raptor and Rictor.
  Conversely, overexpression of PKCε in MCF-7 cells leads to the activation of mTORC1
  and an increase in LC3-I, LC3-II, and p62 levels. PLK1 may represent a crucial therapeutic
  target for radiosensitized breast cancer. PIM2 directly phosphorylates TSC2 at Ser1798,
  thereby inhibiting TSC2’s action at mTORC1. In MCF-7 cells, the overexpression of
  GSK-3α/β activates mTORC1 and inhibits autophagy through the phosphorylation of
  Ser859 on Raptor, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K1 and ULK1, alongside
  increased autophagic flux. Non-classical activation of MEK/ERK may also modulate
  beclin-1 expression to stimulate autophagy. KIN-281 inhibits MELK and BMX. Pharmacological
  inhibition of SYK may provide a unique therapeutic strategy to limit the metastatic
  progression of breast cancer. Additionally, DEPTOR, induced following Her2 inactivation,
  not only promotes autophagy but may also mediate cell proliferation, survival, and
  drug resistance. Thus, the inhibition of mTOR by DEPTOR could contribute to the
  therapeutic effects observed when targeting nuclear Her2. (Red: Tyrosine kinase;
  Yellow: Serine-threonine kinases; Blue: Lipid kinase.)'
