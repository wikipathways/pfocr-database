caption: Model shows the potential mechanism by which 40 Hz light flicker reduces
  Aβ levels. Phosphorylation of APP induced by PKC activation under the treatment
  of 40 Hz light flicker led to maintained plasma membrane levels of full‐length APP
  as well as decreased trafficking to endosomes, which ultimately inhibited BACE1 cleavage
  pathway. Moreover, on the basis of PKC‐induced serine phosphorylation of KCC2, the
  tyrosine phosphorylation and degradation of KCC2 were further limited by a direct
  interaction with full‐length APP anchored within the plasma membrane, which contributed
  to the upregulation of surface GABAA receptor α1 levels. In addition, the increase
  of ATP caused by 40 Hz light flicker promoted PLC/DAG signaling cascade, which is
  likely to be involved in the activation of PKC
