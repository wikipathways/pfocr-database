caption: Model summarising the findings from gene expression analysis of 164 genes
  related to selenium and selenoproteins. Findings suggest there may be a redistribution
  in selenium sources with a reduction in organic selenium degradation via the transsulphuration
  pathway and an increase in the metabolism of inorganic selenium. Iron metabolism
  may also be disturbed with an increase in iron storage and promotion of factors
  related to iron-associated cell death. There may be several reasons for these alterations
  and they appear to be progressively altered as NAFLD deteriorates. Blue circles
  and arrows indicate genes down-regulated in NAFLD compared to controls (either healthy
  weight or obesity) and the purple circles and arrows indicate genes up-regulated
  in NAFLD compared to controls. Question marks indicate hypothesised reasons for
  alterations that cannot be fully tested in the current study. MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase; CBS, cystathionine beta-synthase; SCLY, selenocysteine lyase; ACSL5,
  acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 5; ACSL6, acyl-CoA synthetase long
  chain family member 6; ACSL4, acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4; SCL40A1,
  solute carrier family 40 member 1; CP, ceruloplasmin; SLC11A2, solute carrier family
  11 member 2; Fe, iron; NASH, non-alchoholic steatohepatitis; Se, selenium.
