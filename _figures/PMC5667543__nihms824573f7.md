caption: Schematic illustration showing the main signaling events occurring during
  DZ preconditioning in neurons. DZ administration initiates preconditioning by depolarizing
  mitochondria and increasing ROS production. Protection against OGD develops following
  the activation of the Akt-mTOR-S6K signaling cascade resulting in increased viability
  of neurons and preservation of OCR following OGD.
