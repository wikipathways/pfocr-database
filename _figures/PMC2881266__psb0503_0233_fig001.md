caption: A proposed model of salt-stress tolerance in plants at cellular level. The
  sensing of ionic stress induces a transient elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ and pH.,,,
  Cytosolic-Ca2+ elevation is attributed with the influx of Ca2+ from cell wall, as
  well as from the vacuole. ER and mitochondria may also contribute to cytosolic-Ca2+
  elevation. The cytosolic-pH increase seems to be linked with vacuolar-pH decreases.
  Cytosolic Ca2+ elevation and pH increase, either independently or in coordination,
  induces the SOS pathway for ionic homeostasis through inhibition of Na+ entry, enhancing
  K+ uptake into the cell, and sequestration of cytosolic Na+ either into the apoplast
  or vacuole.,, Cell organelles, such as nucleus, mitochondria, ER etc., might also
  have their own Ca2+ elevation and subsequent signaling cascade for downstream responses.,
  Osmotic stress, in contrast to ionic toxicity, may either decrease or increase cytosolic-Ca2+
  level, which might be linked with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  ROS then activates the MAPK pathways for osmotic homeostasis and detoxification
  responses.
