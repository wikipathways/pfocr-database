caption: An illustration of NK cell activation and cancer inhibition induced by EE.
  The induction of hypothalamic BDNF or other brain mediator molecules in response
  to environmental stimuli leads to the activation of the SNS and HPA axes, which
  can directly act on NK cells. Another pathway is that EE impacted organs with endocrine
  function secrete adipokines, cytokines or hormones and subsequently act on NK cells
  that residing in the organ. The adipokines or cytokines also enter circulation,
  reach the distant organs and regulate NK cells there. All these effects contribute
  to EE induced immune protection against cancer and other diseases.
