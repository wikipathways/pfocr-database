caption: ABL kinases are activated downstream of hyperactive receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs), chemokine receptors and SRC family kinases, or in response to oxidative
  and metabolic stress pathways. The activated ABL kinases promote cancer cell migration
  and invasion by activating multiple MMPs and actin-regulatory proteins such as Rac,
  cortactin, N-WASP, Abl interactor 1 (ABI1) and WAVE [, , , ] (orange pathways).
  ABL1 functions downstream of the EphB2 receptor to regulate CyclinD1 signaling to
  promote activation of proliferative response factors in intestinal epithelium and
  adenomas [, ] (blue pathway). The ABL1 kinase is hyperactive in FH-deficient renal
  cancer cells (HLRCC) in response to high fumarate levels; the activated ABL1 promotes
  aerobic glycolysis through activation of the mTOR- HIF1α pathway and also induces
  nuclear localization of the transcription factor NRF2 to induce expression of NQO1
  and other antioxidant response factors in HLRCC [] (purple pathway). Activation
  of NOTCH in the intestinal epithelium of Apc+/Δ716 polyposis mice promoted RBPJ-mediated
  transcription leading to increased levels of DAB1, a substrate and activator of
  the ABL kinases; the activated ABL in colorectal cancer cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation
  of TRIO on Y2681, leading to enhanced TRIO Rho-GEF activity [] (green pathway).
