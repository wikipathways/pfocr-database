caption: Proposed model for the potential role of NSBP-1 in the insulin pathway. DAF-2
  signals through the AGE-1 signaling cascade activate AKT-1 by phosphorylation. These
  kinases in turn regulate DAF-16 and NSBP-1 negatively. In the absence of insulin
  signaling, NSBP-1 binds to DAF-16 in the nucleus to regulate insulin signaling-mediated
  dauer formation, fat storage, and oxidative stress
