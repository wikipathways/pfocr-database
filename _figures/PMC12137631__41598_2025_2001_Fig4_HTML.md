caption: Molecular mapping of HFD-induced liver inflammation and metabolic dysregulation
  HFD induced liver steatosis through activating key inflammatory and lipid metabolism
  genes. Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins analysis (STRING)
  analysis confirmed the major interaction of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor
  Gamma (Pparγ) with proinflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-α
  (Tnf-α), Interferon-gamma γ (Ifn-γ), interleukin2/1β/6 (ll-2, Il-1β, Il-6), leading
  to the initiation of Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
  (Nf-kb) regulation. PPARγ also enhanced the expression of proteins linked to lipid
  absorption, TG storage, and the development of lipid droplets, such as fatty acid
  binding protein (Fabp). Transcription factors that play a role in lipid metabolism
  and glucose homeostasis, such as sterol regulatory element binding transcription
  factor 1 (Srebf1), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) and Pparγ were linked to key
  processes in the insulin signalling pathway (Insulin receptor substrate-1 (Insr1),
  Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, catalytic alpha polypeptide (Pik3ca), Phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase, regulatory subunit 1 alpha (Pi3k3r1), glucose transport (Solute Carrier
  Family 2, member 2 (Slc2a2)/Glut2) and inflammation. Interferon-gamma (Ifn-γ) is
  a major proinflammatory cytokine that promotes fibrogenesis in the liver by activating
  hepatic stellate cells, which are involved in fibrosis formation. It has been well
  reported that Ifn-γ induces a cytokine storm that results in the progression of
  liver fibrosis49
