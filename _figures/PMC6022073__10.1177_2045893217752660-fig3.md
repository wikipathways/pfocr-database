caption: Balance of EC-disruptive and EC-protective mechanisms in the course of lung
  injury and resolution phase. Lung injurious factors (bacterial pathogens, excessive
  mechanical stretch, cytokines, disruptive bioactive molecules) trigger pathologic
  signaling (i.e. oxidative stress, RhoA pathway, signaling kinases, secreted factors)
  leading to endothelial hyperpermeability, inflammation, and lung dysfunction. However,
  pathologic stimuli also activate mechanisms of auto-recovery such as secretion of
  pro-survival growth factors and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators which suppress
  inflammation, downregulate pro-inflammatory and disruptive RhoA GTPase-mediated
  pathways, and stimulate Rap1 and Rac1 GTPase-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling leading
  to EC barrier recovery.
