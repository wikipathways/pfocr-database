caption: (A) The scheme shows the key steps of the NF-κB signaling system. Activation
  of the canonical NF-κB pathway by triggers such as IL-1β will lead to the rapid
  phosphorylation and ubiquitination-mediated destruction of the cytosolic inhibitor
  IκBα. This in turns liberates the active NF-κB transcription factor subunits p50
  (encoded by the NFKB1 gene) and p65 (encoded by the RELA gene), which translocate
  to the nucleus. The p50 and p65 dimers bind to specific DNA motifs within accessible,
  open chromatin regions, often in conjunction with other transcription factors such
  as JUN or FOS proteins which form activating protein (AP)–1 (hetero)dimers. Many
  NF-κB target genes encode secreted factors such as IL-6 or CXCL8, which are crucial
  regulators of the TME. High activity of NF-κB target genes is usually associated
  with characteristic epigenetic signatures at histone tails prevailing as enhancers
  (e.g. H3K27ac), promoters and gene bodies as indicated. (B) Schematic representation
  of proximity ligation assays (PLA) combined with single molecule (sm)RNA-FISH to
  monitor the NF-κB status at the single cell resolution. High numbers of NF-κB:IκBα
  dimers (red dots) and low numbers of smRNA-FISH signals (green dots) characterize
  cells with a silenced NF-κB pathway, while low numbers of NF-κB:IκBα dimers and
  high numbers of smRNA-FISH signals characterize cells with high NF-κB activity.
  For details see text. NF-κB (left sequence logos) and AP-1 (right sequence logos)
  motifs were obtained from the JASPAR data base (https://jaspar.genereg.net).
