caption: A) The schema shows domain organization of NOTCH protein (NOTCH1 shown).
  The extracellular domain of NOTCH receptor consists of multiple EGF repeats followed
  by the NRR (negative regulatory region), which consists of three LNR (Lin-12 and
  Notch repeats) domains and HD (heterodimerization domain). The intracellular domain
  of NOTCH receptor consists of a membrane proximal RAM (RBPJ associated molecule)
  domain, ANK (ankyrin repeats), and a C- terminal TAD (trans-activation domain) comprised
  of three NLS (nuclear localization sequences) and degron-containing PEST (rich in
  proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine) sequence.B) An overview of Notch1 signaling
  and proteolytic processing in the presence of SERCA inhibition. NOTCH1 receptor
  is a cell surface protein. In physiological condition interaction with the Notch
  ligand, such as JAG1-2 or Dll-4, initiates proteolytic cleavage at the extracellular
  site by a metalloprotease (TACE) followed by a γ-secretase (GSI) cleavage, resulting
  in the release of ICN1. ICN1 is then translocated into the nucleus where it interacts
  with CSL and recruits coactivators to form a transcription-activating complex. In
  the presence of NOTCH1 mutations, ICN1 is constitutively active and avoids activation
  through ligand interaction. Inhibition of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase
  (SERCA) leads to alteration in NOTCH1 trafficking causing a loss of NOTCH1 proteins
  on the surface of the cells and an accumulation of full-length polypeptides on the
  endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi region. The consequent lack of TACE and GSI substrate
  causes a reduction in ICN1 level.
