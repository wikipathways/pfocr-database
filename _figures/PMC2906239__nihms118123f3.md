caption: '5-Oxo-ETE synthesis is regulated by the availability of NADP+, which is
  increased by oxidative stress through the glutathione redox cycle and the action
  of NADPH oxidase (NOX2 in phagocytic cells) and reduced by the pentose phosphate
  pathway, the first step of which is oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate by glucose
  6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-dh). Other abbreviations: GRed, glutathione reductase,
  GPx, glutathione peroxidase, SOD, superoxide dismutase.'
