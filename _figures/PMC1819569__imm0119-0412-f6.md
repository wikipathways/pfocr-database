caption: Schematic representation of the signalling pathways involved in Pam3Cys-induced
  degranulation and cytokine/chemokine production in human LAD 2, MLMC and BMMC. We
  propose that the ability of Pam3Cys to induce degranulation in (a) LAD 2 mast cells,
  (b) MLMC and BMMC reflects differences in Ca2+ mobilization and Gαi activation.
  Pam3Cys-induced CCL2 production in (a) human LAD 2 mast cells requires Ca2+-mediated
  NFAT and Gαi-mediated ERK and PI3 kinase activation. However, in (b) MLMC and BMMC
  Pam3Cys does not induce Ca2+ mobilization therefore JE production is mediated via
  NF-κB activation. PI3 kinase pathway is also required for JE production in MLMC
  and BMMC. (→ stimulation).
