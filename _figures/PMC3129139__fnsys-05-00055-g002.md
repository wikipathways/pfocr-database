caption: Glutamatergic modulation of striatal NOS interneurons by cortical inputs.
  Corticostriatal activation exerts direct excitatory effects on NOS interneurons
  via AMPA and NMDA receptor activation. NMDA receptor-dependent calcium influx activates
  nNOS and facilitates the conversion of l-arginine into l-citrulline and NO production.
  Dopamine release from the nigrostriatal pathway facilitates nNOS activity via D1/5
  receptor stimulation. Furthermore, striatal NMDA receptor activation plays a critical
  role in the facilitatory effects of D1/5 receptor activation on striatal NO synthesis.
  Given that D1/5 receptor tone is also necessary for NMDA receptor activation of
  NOS, it is likely that reciprocal DA and glutamate interactions are crucial for
  the activation of striatal nNOS and NO transmission.
