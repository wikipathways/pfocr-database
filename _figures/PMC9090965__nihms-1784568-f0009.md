caption: Proposed metabolic pathway of 6-amino-2,4-dimethylheptanoyl-CoA, the CoA
  ester of 6-amino-2,4-dimethylheptanoic acid. LCAD is expected to carry out the first
  α,β-dehydrogenation step of this CoA ester. Two succinyl-CoA and one pyruvate are
  expected as the active anaplerotic contribution of the amino fatty acid with possible
  channeling of the latter to other functions including gluconeogenesis via conversion
  to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase
