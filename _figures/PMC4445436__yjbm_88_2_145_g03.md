caption: Approaches to investigating synthetic lethal interactions. A) Chemical library
  screens are conducted using matched cell lines in a plate format wherein each drug
  is dosed separately to both lines. Fluorescence intensity from GFP or EYFP labeled
  cell lines can be used as a surrogate for cell count to make the assay high-throughput.
  B) siRNA library screens are also conducted in a plate format. Libraries are often
  custom ordered with individual siRNAs or siRNA pools and transfection reagent contained
  in each well. The matched cell lines can then be plated and following incubation
  analyzed in parallel using a high-throughput method like Cell Titer-Glo. Hits from
  screens performed using the plate format (A and B) are identified by comparing the
  normalized values of each well between the two matched cell lines. A hit, indicated
  by the red arrows, kills cancer cells while sparing the matched cell line (simulated
  normal tissue). C) The shRNA library approach is most often performed by transducing
  matched cell lines with a shRNA viral pool, although plated approaches can be conducted
  similar to the siRNA library approach. The pooled approach is more conducive for
  studying multiple cell lines and relies on deep sequencing analysis to identify
  hits. A hit is identified by identifying shRNAs that are lost after library transduction
  in cancer cell lines and present in matched (normal) cell lines, since synthetic
  lethal interactions will result in the cells death. Once hits have been identified
  and validated in each screen, the approaches A, B, C split. With a chemical library
  screen (A) in vivo studies can be readily initiated while the investigation into
  the molecular pathway is conducted. For siRNA and shRNA screens (B, C), in vivo
  studies can also be initiated using RNAi constructs while small molecules are developed.
