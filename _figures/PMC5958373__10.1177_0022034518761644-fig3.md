caption: 'Overview of a general bioinformatic work flow for metatranscriptome analysis.
  Common steps in the bioinformatic analysis of microbial transcriptomes: quality
  control of the sequences obtained by next-generation sequencing, alignment against
  the genomes of interest, phylogenetic assignment of the transcripts and metagenome,
  differential expression analysis and gene set or pathway enrichment analysis based
  on the obtained differentially expressed genes. In purple are software packages
  widely used for metatranscriptome analysis. HMP, Human Microbiome Project; HOMD,
  Human Oral Microbiome Database; LEfSe, linear discriminant analysis effect size.'
