caption: 'The complement system is divided into three pathways: Classical, lectin,
  and alternative. The classical pathway is initiated by antigen-antibody complexes
  by C1qrs. The lectin pathway is initiated by mannose binding lectin (MBL) binding
  to sugar monomers (mannose) on pathogen surfaces. The alternative pathway is initiated
  by the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 into active components. Through a series of
  enzymatic steps that produces the C3 convertase (C4b2b or C3bBb), each pathway converges
  to the cleavage of C3 into active components C3a and C3b. C3b then produces C5 convertases
  (C4b2b3b or C3bBb3b), which cleaves C5 into active components C5a, and C5b. Through
  the combination of C5b-C9 the membrane attack complex is formed and is able to produce
  pores in targeted cells or pathogens, resulting in lysis. Furthermore, anaphylatoxins
  (C3a and C5a) function as chemoattractants and recruit immune cells to sites of
  injury.'
