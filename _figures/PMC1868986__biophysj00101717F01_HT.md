caption: (A) Schematic representation of the lac operon regulatory mechanisms. This
  operon comprises genes lacZ, lacY, and lacA. Protein LacZ is a permease that transports
  external lactose into the cell. Protein LacY polymerases into a homo-tetramer named
  β-galactosidase. This enzyme transforms internal lactose (Lac) into allolactose
  (Allo) and galactose (Gal), and further transforms allolactose into galactose. Allolactose
  can bind to the repressor (R) inhibiting it. When not bound by allolactose, R can
  bind to a specific site upstream of the operon structural genes and thus avoid transcription
  initiation. External glucose inhibits production of cAMP which, when bound to protein
  CRP to form complex CAP, acts as an activator of the lac operon. External glucose
  also inhibits lactose uptake by permease proteins. (B) Graphical representation
  of the interactions accounted for by the lac operon mathematical model. The meaning
  of the variables appearing in this figure is as follows. Ge and Le stand for external
  glucose and lactose concentrations; M, Q, and B denote mRNA, permease, and β-galactosidase,
  molecule concentrations, respectively; and L, A, and G correspond to the intracellular
  lactose, allolactose, and galactose molecule concentrations. All of the processes
  underlying the lac operon regulatory pathway are represented by rectangles. Inputs
  (outputs) are denoted with empty arrowheads (circles). Finally, plus and minus signs
  stand for the effect each input variable has on every output variable.
