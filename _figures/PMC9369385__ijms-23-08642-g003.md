caption: The regulatory network of miRNA target genes is involved in the response
  of plants to Cd stress. The blue area indicates the pathway by which miRNA participates
  in metal chelation. The green region represents the process by which miRNA participates
  in metal transport. The orange area indicates that miRNA participates in the regulation
  of related plant hormone signaling pathways, including auxin, jasmonic acid, and
  cytokinin.
