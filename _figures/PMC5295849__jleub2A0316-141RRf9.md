caption: CXCL12 activates Rac1 and class I PI3Ks in BMM, presumably via CXCR4. Rac1
  stimulates membrane ruffling and macropinocytic cup formation. Class I PI3Ks also
  regulate MP formation and generate PIP3 and/or PI(3,4)P2 in the cup (green). Akt
  is then recruited to the cup structure and phosphorylated. pAkt induces pTSC2 (deactivation
  of TSC2). PKC function is required for cup closure. Given that PKC is regulated
  by DAG (blue), which is generated by PLCγ, the PLCγ/DAG pathway likely acts upstream
  of PKC in MP formation. Whereas the Akt/TSC pathway activates Rheb, the macropinocytic
  pathway conveys extracellular nutrients to the lysosome to activate Rag. Thus, these
  2 pathways coordinately activate mTORC1. EIPA blocks macropinocytosis by inhibiting
  Rac1 function. J/B block membrane ruffling, as well as macropinocytosis. Staurosporine
  (Stauro), calphostin C (CalC), and Gö6976 (Go) all block MP closure by inhibiting
  PKC function. MK2206 (MK) inhibits Akt function but not macropinocytosis. p110 isoform-specific
  inhibitors block cup formation and cup closure, resulting in the attenuation of
  mTORC1 activity.

    Rac1 stimulates membrane ruffling and macropinocytic cup formation. Class I PI3Ks

    Akt is then recruited to the cup structure and phosphorylated. pAkt induces pTSC2

    is regulated by DAG (blue), which is generated by PLCγ, the PLCγ/DAG pathway likely
