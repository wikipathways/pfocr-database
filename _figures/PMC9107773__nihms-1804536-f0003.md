caption: In the cell-based model of coagulation, initiation occurs on tissue factor
  (TF)-bearing cells, via the extrinsic pathway, and results in the activation of
  small amounts of thrombin. Thrombin generated on the TF-bearing cell amplifies the
  procoagulant response by activating additional coagulation factors and platelets.
  The large burst of thrombin required for formation of a fibrin clot is generated
  on platelet surfaces during the propagation phase. Adapted with permission from
  REF., Wiley.
