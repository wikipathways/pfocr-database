caption: Pathways for activation of naïve CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Treg by Type-2 cytokines
  and alloantigen. We propose activation of naïve/resting thymic CD4+CD25+ Treg (tTreg)
  is driven by cytokines produced by activated effector T cells. The Type-2 cytokine
  and alloantigen activation pathway of tTreg parallels the activation of effector
  Th2 cells. Our hypothesis is based on the physiology of immune response. IL-4 is
  only produced by Th2 cells early in an immune response and late in the response
  IL-4 is replaced by other Th2 cytokines including IL-5 and IL-13. Our proposed model
  is that naïve T cells in the rejection response are activated to Th2 cells as well
  as Th1 cells. Th2 cells express transcription factor GATA-3 and produce Th2 cytokine
  IL-4 (Top row) in early stages of immune response. This IL-4 activates other naïve
  T cells to expand the immune response. In parallel, IL-4 also activates naïve/resting
  CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Treg (tTreg) in a polyclonal fashion and this activation does not
  require IL-2. tTreg express IL-4Rα and can recognize graft alloantigen in the presence
  of IL-4 get activated to alloantigen-specific Treg that are induced to express IL-5Rα,
  the specific receptor for IL-5 (Bottom row). We call these activated antigen-specific
  CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Treg Ts2 cells (, ). Ts2 cells diminish the immune response by inhibition
  of Th1 and Th17 cells promoting polarization to a Type 2 effector response (). A
  sustained Th2 response results in production of IL-5 from Th2 cells (GATA-3+), and
  diminished IL-4 production. In the second step of activation is IL-5 in presence
  of specific stimulating alloantigen promoting expansion of Ts2 (IL-5Rα+Foxp3+) to
  Th2-like Treg. Th2-like Treg express mRNA for Foxp3, Gata-3, Irf4 and Il5. Th2-like
  Treg do not express key markers of Th1-like Treg such as tbet, Ifng. Ifngr or Il12rb2.
  The presence of IL-4 during late stage of immune response inhibits induction of
  Th2-like Treg.
