caption: 'Metabolic pathway enrichment of differential metabolites in the serum of
  T2DM mice. (A) Each colored spot represents a metabolic pathway, such as (a) Tryptophan
  metabolism, (b) Glycerophospholipid metabolism, (c) Sphingolipid metabolism, (d)
  Glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, (e) Ether lipid metabolism, (f) Steroid
  hormone biosynthesis. Color gradient represents the p-value size (orange: higher
  p-values and purple: lower p-values), and circle size represents the rank of pathway
  impact score (the larger the circle: higher impact score, and the smaller the circle:
  lower impact score). (B) Pathway of “Tryptophan metabolism.” (C) Pathway of “Glycerophospholipid
  metabolism.”'
