caption: Survival pathways controlled by Tax. A growing body of evidence suggests
  that the anti-apoptotic effect of Tax is mediated by the activation of distinct
  signaling cascades, including NF-κB, PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2. Both canonical and
  non-canonical NF-κB pathways are activated by Tax, and control the expression of
  numerous survival genes; the PI3K/Akt pathway, also activated by Tax, acts by inhibiting
  the pro-apoptotic protein Bad, by activating the NF-κB pathway and inducing CREB
  phosphorylation; the Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway is engaged by Tax through Ras activation.
  RasGTP can also induce PI3K activation; down modulation of PTEN expression by Tax
  leads to both Akt activation and increased levels of phosphorylated CREB in the
  nucleus.
