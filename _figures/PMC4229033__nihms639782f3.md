caption: Reaction scheme for the biosynthetic pathway towards 1 and 2 as described
  in this work. Catalytic mechanisms of Mcl17, Mcl22, and Mcl23 are discussed in the
  text (see also ). Details of the Mcl24-mediated reactions are reported in Diethelm
  et al.[] DMAPP = dimethylallyl diphosphate, GPP = geranyl diphosphate.
