caption: To understand how CREB1 drives a master transcriptional network associated
  with efficacious vaccine responses, TF target gene sets which 1) correlated positively
  with V1V2 titers and 2) CREB1 gene set z-scores were identified. Genes from these
  CREB1 associated TF gene sets were combined with the leading edge of the CREB1 geneset.
  Genes in these networks were then annotated to functional pathways and nodes using
  ClueGO, an application in Cytoscape. (a) CREB1 and its associated gene sets in DCs
  drive functional nodes of lymphocyte/leukocyte migration, leukocyte differentiation
  and cytosolic nucleic acid sensing (STING/TMEM173). (b) ClueGO analysis of CREB1
  and associated gene sets in CD4+ T cells highlights multiple critical nodes for
  CD4+ function including costimulation, cytokine signaling, migration and antigen
  processing/presentation. (c) ClueGO network highlighting enrichment of CREB1 and
  its associated gene sets in pathway of migration in B cells. (d) CREB1 associated
  TF gene sets were identified in RV144 followed by identification of subsets from
  Study 36 in which CREB1 associated with each TF. This analysis confirms that CREB1
  associates to a range of TFs involved in immune function in both RV144 and Study
  36 and that these associations are cell-type specific.
