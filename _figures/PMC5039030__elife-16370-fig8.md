caption: '(A) Model: DPP9 regulates Syk signalling. By maintaining low levels of activated
  Syk in resting B cells DPP9 controls tonic signalling and preserves signalling capacity
  for the processes induced by BCR engagement. By targeting Syk for degradation after
  BCR engagement, DPP9 can also influence the duration of the response to antigen
  BCR binding. (B) Reduced DPP9 activity e.g by inhibition results in higher levels
  of active Syk in non-stimulated cells. This results in elevated Tonic signalling
  (‘signal leakage’), consequently leading to a lower response upon BCR engagement.
  (C) Model: DPP9 targets Syk for degradation by the N-end rule pathway. In this model,
  FLNA acts as a recruitment platform for binding of Syk and DPP9. FLNA then supports
  the cleavage of Syk by DPP9, by increasing the local concentration of Syk and DPP9,
  stabilizing the interaction between Syk and DPP9, or by optimizing the orientation
  of DPP9 and Syk. The interaction between DPP and Syk leads to the processing of
  Syk N-terminus which removes the dipeptide MA, and exposes a neo Syk N-terminus
  with serine in position 1 is exposed. Subsequently the E3 ligase Cbl binds to Syk
  p-Y323 initiating its ubiquitintaion and degradation by the proteasome.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16370.016'
