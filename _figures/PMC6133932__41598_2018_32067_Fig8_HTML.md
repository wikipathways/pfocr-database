caption: Scheme of cascade of events representing the role of zinc in the regulatory
  crosstalk promoting myogenesis. Zinc ions influx from extracellular medium through
  membrane Zip transporter mediate phosphorylation of Zip7 endoplasmic reticulum transporter.
  Activation of Zip7 produces a release of intracellular storage of Zn2+ and subsequent
  phosphorylation of protein kinase Akt and consequently enhances myogenic differentiation.
  Myotube formation, in turn, stimulate Zn2+ extracellular uptake, enhancing myogenic
  differentiation process and myotubes development. (1) References,. (2) Reference.
