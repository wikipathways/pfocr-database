caption: Effects of MEHTCMPs on the MAPK signaling pathway. ⊥ represents inhibition
  and → represents promotion. First, JNK and P38 are activated by activated TLRs and
  IL-1R, which interact with the junction protein MyD88, phosphorylating IRAK-1/4
  and interacting with TRAF6 to activate TAK1, which in turn activates MKK3/6 and
  MKK4/7, leading to the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK and the modulation of downstream
  protein expression, regulating the release of inflammatory factors. ERK is mainly
  activated by RTK and requires the participation of Ras, PKC, and Raf proteins. Normally,
  ERK is located in the cytoplasm, but once activated, ERK rapidly crosses the nuclear
  membrane and activates transcription factors such as STATs and Fos, thus regulating
  the release of inflammatory factors. By Figdraw2.0
