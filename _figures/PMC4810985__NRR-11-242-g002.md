  activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to promote expression of chaperones
  and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) factors that rescue ER function. Moreover,
  ER stress induces the formation of autophagosomes at the ER, a pathway named as
  ER-related autophagy, dependent on the recruitment of Atg5 and LC3-II. In addition,
  it triggers the biogenesis of EDEMosomes, a pathway known as ERAD tuning.
