caption: 'Allicin biosynthesis: Two biosynthetic routes result in S-allylcysteine.
  The observation of 14C-labeled S-allylcysteine following feeding plants with 14C-labeled
  serine and applying several alkyl mercaptans led Granroth to posit that serine is
  one potential substrate for S-allylcysteine biosynthesis. Another pathway resulted
  from GSH to S-allylcysteine. The allyl-group source has yet to be determined. S-allylcysteine,
  after oxidization, is converted to alliin as an “inactive” precursor of allicin.
  Enzymatic hydrolysis of alliin produces allyl sulfenic acid, which can be condensed
  spontaneously to allicin. This figure adapted from Borlinghaus et al. ().'
