caption: Schematic view of the signalling pathways elicited in ARPE‐19 cells under
  oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. OGD inhibited the PPAR‐α mediated p‐AKT
  (and resulted in decreased mitochondria membrane potential and decreased antioxidants),
  increased ROS generation and broke tight junction proteins (e.g. F‐actin and ZO‐1)
  and induced caspase‐9/‐3‐mediated apoptosis. PPAR‐α downregulation under OGD also
  decreased p‐ERK expression and LC3B activation, resulting in autophagy. Hyperbaric
  oxygen (HBO) preconditioning could attenuate the OGD‐induced apoptosis and autophagy
  signalling pathway by normalizing the PPAR‐α expression. A specific PPAR‐α antagonist,
  GW6471, can antagonize all the protection effects exerted by HBO in OGD‐injured
  retinal pigment epithelial cells.
