caption: The signaling pathways involved in the protection of H2S against PH. H2S
  ameliorated PH by decreasing endogenous production of NO and the expression of NOS
  and elevating the HO-1/CO pathway in pulmonary arteries. H2S may inhibit hypoxia-induced
  proliferation of pulmonary VSMCs and mitigate PH by upregulating the COX-2/PGI2
  signaling pathway. H2S was reported to inhibit ATF6 and mitigate the hypoxia-induced
  decline in mitochondrial calcium levels. H2S effectively inhibits hypoxia-induced
  proliferation, migration, oxidative stress, and ER stress of pulmonary VSMCs. H2S
  reduced pulmonary artery pressure, reversed pulmonary vascular structural remolding
  by suppressing phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and IκBα, thus downregulating the levels
  of downstream inflammatory factors, including ICAM-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 in pulmonary
  endothelial cells. H2S induced the apoptosis of pulmonary VSMCs by activating the
  Fas/caspase3 pathway and inhibiting the Bcl-2 pathway, thereby ameliorating high
  pulmonary blood flow-induced PH
