caption: Diagrams of a hypothesized extreme resistance pathway and its possible relationship
  to the hypersensitive response. Experimental evidence to date indicates that the
  proteins highlighted in these diagrams are important for antiviral defenses mechanisms,
  including extreme resistance (A) and the hypersensitive response (HR; B). These
  two pathways may share specific protein components and/or activation mechanisms,
  and therefore, may be thought of as a continuum of antiviral response rather than
  two distinct pathways. The conserved mechanisms of the extreme resistance response
  remain largely unknown, although this review (and others; ) have noted some unifying
  themes. (A) The extreme resistance response depends on NLR activation and recognition
  of a pathogen-produced effector protein. The activated NLR may then translocate
  to the nucleus, where it could form a complex with transcription factor(s), resulting
  in either the activation of defense responses by binding to DNA and promoting transcription
  of defense genes or by preventing DNA binding of transcription factors that repress
  defense gene expression. Immune signaling through EDS1/PAD4/SAG101 proteins and
  resulting complexes likely also plays a role in initiating immune responses, but
  the mechanisms are not understood. Activation of extreme resistance defense pathways
  results in translational arrest increased abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, which allows
  for callose deposition at plasmodesmata, increased expression of components of the
  RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, and likely other forms of hormonal signaling. (B)
  The relationship between extreme resistance and the HR is not well understood. The
  timing of the pathogen recognition event by the host may play a role in determining
  the phenotype of the resulting resistance response. Delayed recognition of the pathogen
  could allow for more production or secretion of pathogen-derived proteins, many
  of which are involved in disabling host immune responses, including preventing callose
  deposition, which is a key aspect of extreme resistance. Eventual recognition of
  many pathogen proteins could lead to the oligomerization of activated NLR complexes
  and the formation of resistome pore-like structures in the cell wall, which may
  play a role in HR ().
