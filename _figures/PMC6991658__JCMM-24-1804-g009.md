caption: Mechanism diagram. Inhibition of MELK could reduce BCa cell proliferation
  and migration. Specifically, the down‐regulation of MELK could restrain the repair
  of DSBs and then activate the ATM/CHK2/p53 pathway, further inducing G1/S cell cycle
  arrest and leading to the suppression of BCa cell proliferation. In addition, the
  down‐regulation of MELK could suppress the EMT pathway to reduce the migration of
  BCa cells

  by inducing G1/S cell cycle arrest via the ATM/CHK2/p53 pathway.
