caption: Biochemical pathways leading to resistance to small-molecule epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting drugs such as gefitinib and erlotinib in non-small-cell
  lung cancer (NSCLC). Simplified pathway diagram showing EGFR signaling through the
  RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PDK1/AKT pathways, illustrating the points of mutation/amplification
  in EGFR TKI resistance, along with other mechanisms. The resistance mechanisms include
  the EGFR p.T790M gatekeeper mutation, amplification of EGFR p.T790M, MET amplification,
  PI3KCA mutation, and an at least two-fold increase in the expression of GAS6 and
  its receptor AXL. Incidence rates are given where known. The FAS/nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) signaling arm downstream of the FAS death receptor has also been shown to
  be important in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. In addition, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  (EMT) transition changes, perhaps associated with increased activity of AXL, and
  transformation from the NSCLC to the small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) phenotype can
  lead to decreased responsiveness. The identification of various resistance mechanisms
  suggests that a range of clinically actionable therapies could be used to overcome
  the resistance. For more details, see text.
