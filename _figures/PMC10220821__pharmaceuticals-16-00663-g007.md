caption: The metabolic pathway of clopidogrel (in)activation, considering the configuration
  required for the covalent inhibition of the P2Y12-receptor. CES1 (carboxylesterase
  1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of 7(S)-clopidogrel into clopidogrel carboxylic acid,
  which is inactive. Cytochromes P450 (CYP450) are oxidoreductases and enable the
  oxidation of 7(S)-clopidogrel in the first step. CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19,
  and CYP3A4/5 are implicated as cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism
  of clopidogrel. The warhead is highlighted in blue.
