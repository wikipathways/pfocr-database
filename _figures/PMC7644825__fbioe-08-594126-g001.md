caption: Deploying synthetic biology to access novel regions of chemical space. (A)
  Readily available bulk feedstocks can be fed to yeast strains hosting refactored
  plant biosynthetic pathways. Natural products can then be extracted from fermentation
  broth. (B) Engineering of the plant biosynthetic pathway within the yeast chassis
  can allow or improve turnover of halogenated substrate analogs. Halogenated natural
  product scaffolds can be extracted from the fermentation broth. Promiscuous or engineered
  enzyme variants in engineered plant pathways are colored by red, blue and white
  arrows in the middle panel. (C) Introduction of halogenases can yield halogenated
  products from natural substrates. Promiscuous or engineered enzyme variants in engineered
  plant pathways are colored by red, blue and white arrows in the middle panel. Halogenase
  is depicted by a green arrow. (D) Schematic depicting the halogen derivatives surrounding
  natural product scaffolds in a hypothetical chemical space in which more similar
  compounds appear closer together. Halogens can facilitate targeted cross-coupling
  reactions that allow “hopping” to entirely new and chemically distinct regions of
  chemical space.
