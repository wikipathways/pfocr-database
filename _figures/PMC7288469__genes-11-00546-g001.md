caption: Schematic representation of CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator)
  mutation classes. The top panels briefly illustrate CFTR trafficking along its proteostasis
  pathway and how protein maturation is disrupted by mutations. The middle panels
  list the mutation class, while the bottom panels briefly describe the defect(s)
  associated with each class. Adapted from [].
