caption: The main host cells that interact with tumour cells in the brain include
  neurons, astrocytes and microglia. a Breast cancer cells that metastasis to the
  brain can develop a GABAergic or glutamatergic phenotype to take up GABA and glutamate
  for proliferation. b Interactions between astrocytes and cancer cells through gap-junction
  communication can activate the STING pathway in astrocytes as well as STAT1, NF-κB
  and AKT–MAPK pathway in cancer cells, and also upregulate GSTA5, BCL2L1 and TWIST1
  in BC cells to enhance tumour growth and chemoresistance. Exosome-mediated secretion
  miRNAs downregulate the tumour suppressor PTEN. Other key molecule such as serpins,
  PPARγ, EGFR ligands and vital processes such as actin stress fibre organisation
  also promote BC cell colonisation. c Interactions between cancer cells, microglia
  and T cells can promote BCBM immune escape. Exosomal miR-503 regulated by lncRNA
  XIST in cancer cells prompted microglia M2 polarisation. M2-like phenotype promote
  BCBM invasion and colonisation in a Wnt-dependent manner and suppress T-cell proliferation
  and cytotoxic effect by immune-suppressive cytokines secretion.
