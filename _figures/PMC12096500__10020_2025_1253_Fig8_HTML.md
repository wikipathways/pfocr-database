caption: The proposed mechanism of PSVII treatment in psoriasis involves the modulation
  of the STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathway and the regulation of pyroptosis. Initial animal
  and cellular studies have revealed that PSVII exhibits anti-psoriatic and anti-inflammatory
  properties. These effects are likely mediated through its regulation of the STAT3/NF-κB
  signaling pathway and its influence on pyroptosis
