caption: 'A: control conditions. Key transporters that link Na+ transport to Ca2+signaling
  in cardiomyocytes; for simplicity, plasma membrane (PM) Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ pumps
  (PMCA), are omitted. Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 1 (NCX1), governed primarily by the α2-Na+
  pump (NKA)-generated local Na+ electrochemical gradient at the PM-sarcoplasmic reticulum
  (SR) junction (the PLasmERosome; shaded area) helps regulate the local cytosolic
  Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]CYT) and SR Ca2+ stores ([Ca2+]SR). B: the hypothesized
  changes in these mechanisms during pressure overload [transaortic constriction (TAC)]-induced
  cardiac hypertrophy (see text and Ref. ). Pressure overload (e.g., via TAC) activates
  the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This increases sympathetic nerve
  activity (SNA), which directly stimulates cardiomyocytes. RAAS activation also leads,
  via a hypothalamic-adrenocortical neurohumoral pathway, to elevation of plasma endogenous
  ouabain (EO), which selectively inhibits high-ouabain affinity α2-Na+ pumps, thereby
  enhancing NCX1-mediated net Ca2+ gain (see , left; acute effects of EO). This increases
  [Ca2+]SR, enhances Ca2+signaling, and augments contraction (i.e., it increases cardiac
  workload). Sustained high plasma EO binding to (perhaps nontransporting) α2-Na+
  pumps also activates protein kinase (PK) cascades that lead to cardiac hypertrophy
  (see , right; chronic effects of EO). C: as discussed in this review, the dashed-line
  boxes indicate where the mechanisms in B are influenced by genetic engineering of
  α1- and α2-Na+ pumps and by treatment with Digibind. In C, the two red-bordered
  boxes surrounding α2-Na+ pumps refer to the evidence that TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy
  is attenuated or prevented by the following genetic alterations: mutation of α2
  to an ouabain-resistant form (test 1), knockout of α2 (test 2), or overexpression
  of α2-Na+ pumps (test 3). The five green-bordered boxes surrounding α1-Na+ pumps
  refer to the evidence that hypertrophy is unaffected by overexpression of (normally)
  ouabain-resistant α1-Na+ pumps (test 4) but is augmented by mutation of α1 to an
  ouabain-sensitive form in α2-ouabain-resistant mice (i.e., α1S/Sα2R/R or “SWAP”
  mice) (test 5). The single blue-bordered “Digibind” box surrounding EO refers to
  the evidence that, in SWAP mice, hypertrophy is prevented or reversed by immunoneutralization
  of ouabain with Digibind (test 6). See text for further details. RyR, ryanodine
