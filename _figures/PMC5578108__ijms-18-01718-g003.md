caption: Intracellular levels of iron, glutathione (GSH) and polyunsaturated fatty
  acids (PUFAs) influence ferroptosis. The abundant intracellular iron through the
  Fenton reaction can result in higher formation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH), the most
  reactive ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) intermediates. These promote conversion of
  PUFAs into lipid hydroperoxides (L–OOH) that lead to ferroptosis. This process can
  be exacerbated pharmacologically by the inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4),
  the enzyme responsible for L–OOH neutralization, by treatment with RAS selective
  lethal 3 (RSL3). Alternatively, GPX4 activity may be inhibited by a depletion of
  GSH via treatment with inhibitors of the system Xc− responsible for cystine uptake
  (such as erastin, sorafenib, glutamate and sulfasalazine) or with buthionine-sulfoximine
  (BSO), an inhibitor of the first reaction of GSH biosynthesis. The system Xc− is
  also transcriptionally repressed by p53. In addition, treatment with inhibitors
  of the mevalonate pathway, such as statins, affect GPX4 synthesis and stimulate
  ferroptosis. On the other hand, strategies to prevent ferroptosis include treatment
  with iron chelators such as deferoxamine (DFO) and neutralization of L-OOH by treatment
  with lipid peroxidation inhibitors (Ferrostatin-1) and antioxidant scavengers (GSH,
  Vitamin E).
