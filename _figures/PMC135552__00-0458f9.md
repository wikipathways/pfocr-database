caption: Model of the GA Signal Transduction Pathway in Rice, Arabidopsis, and Wheat.Arrows
  indicate the GA signal transduction pathway from GA reception (GA) to various actions
  of GA, such as shoot elongation, α-amylase induction, and so on. SLR1 in rice, GAI
  and RGA in Arabidopsis, and RHT-A1, -B1, and -D1 proteins in wheat negatively regulate
  the GA signaling pathway.
