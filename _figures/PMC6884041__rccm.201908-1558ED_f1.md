caption: Neutrophil immunometabolism in cystic fibrosis. On exposure to LPS in the
  cystic fibrosis airway, the neutrophil increases its cytoplasmic levels of the M2
  isoform of PKM2 (pyruvate kinase) and pro–IL-1β. Simultaneously, the NLRP3 inflammasome
  is activated through several mechanisms. PKM2 in association with PHD3 (prolyl hydroxylase-3)
  is stabilized and in conjunction with the coactivator P300 facilitates HIF1 (hypoxia
  inducible factor-1)–dependent transcription that further increases the synthesis
  of pro–IL-1β, PKM2, and HIF1, while reprogramming mitochondria to deviate glucose
  from the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) to the glycolytic pathway. Increased glycolysis
  results in production of lactate, acidification of the cytoplasm, and accumulation
  of succinate, which helps stabilize the HIF1 complex. Mitochondria release reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) that further activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which converts
  pro–IL-1β to active IL-1β through caspase-1–mediated cleavage. DAMP = damage-associated
  molecular patterns; NF-κB = nuclear factor-κB; PAMP = pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns; PPARγ = peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; TLR = toll-like
  receptors.
