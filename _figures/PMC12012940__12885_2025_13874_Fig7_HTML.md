caption: A schematic representation of the underlying molecular mechanisms of the
  specific HPARBPs and their common binding targets regulating the Wnt signaling pathway.
  Under normal physiological conditions, Wnt proteins interact with FZD and LRP5/6
  to initiate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Acting as negative regulators, ZNRF3 and RNF43
  impede Wnt/β-catenin signaling by promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation
  of the Wnt receptors FZD and LRP6, thereby deactivating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
  RSPO interacts with LGR4/5 and ZNRF3/RNF43, triggering their ubiquitination and
  degradation. In the HCC state, four highly expressed specific core HPARBPs bind
  to downstream target RNAs, leading to the generation of abnormal mRNA and protein
  products. This aberrant process results in the abnormal degradation of FZD and ZNRF3/RNF43,
  ultimately causing the failure of Wnt signaling shutdown. Sustained Wnt signaling
  furthers tumor progression and, when combined with other unidentified factors, ultimately
  influences the tumor immune microenvironment
