caption: Possible roles of Mgs1 and WRNIP1 in DNA transaction. A. Role of Mgs1. PCNA
  plays the important role in regulating the DNA damage tolerance pathway via its
  modification with ubiquitin and SUMO in yeast. SUMOylated PCNA interacts with Srs2
  helicase, which prevents homologous recombination by disrupting DNA-Rad51 filaments.
  The 2 types of ubiquitylated PCNA (monoubiquitylated PCNA and polyubiquitylated
  PCNA) channels the lesion bypass to translesion synthesis and template switch, respectively.
  Mgs1 induces polymerase switch from Polδ to Polη during TLS. Mgs1 may also act in
  the template switch. *This pathway is essential when the RAD6 pathway and homologous
  recombination are disabled. B. Role of WRNIP1. WRNIP1 stabilizes RAD51 nucleofilaments
  formed by BRCA2, by counteracting FBH1 and protects replication forks from nucleolytic
  degradation by MRE11. WRNIP1 induces polymerase switch from Polδ to Polη during
  TLS. WRNIP1 links ubiquitylated PCNA with ATMIN/ATM to activate ATM signaling in
  response to replication stress.
