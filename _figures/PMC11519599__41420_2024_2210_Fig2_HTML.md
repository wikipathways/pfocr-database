caption: Necroptosis is often triggered by extracellular stimuli. Its activation relies
  on a variety of receptors, such as CD95, TNF, and so on. When a ligand (such as
  TNF-α) binds to a receptor, Complex I can be formed. This complex can promote cell
  survival through the NF-κB pathway. However, when the interacting components of
  TNFR1 change, complex I will become complex II. Normally, caspase-8 in Complex II
  can trigger apoptosis by activating the classic caspase cascade. Conversely, when
  the signal of caspase-8 is blocked, RIP3 in the cell will be activated to form the
  necrosome, and then the MLKL will be phosphorylated. Activated MLKL serves as an
  initiation signal, leading to necroptosis. In recent years, it was found that in
  heatstroke, the production of ROS and the occurrence of necroptosis promote each
  other. In addition, there are two RIP1-independent necroptosis pathways, which are
  mediated by ZBP1 and TLR3, respectively
