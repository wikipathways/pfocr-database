caption: Overview of microRNA-27a biogenesis, highlighting key enzymes in miRNA biogenesis.
  miRNAs are produced in a tightly regulated pathway which is conserved across species.
  As a canonical biogenesis progress, the biogenesis of miR-27a begins with their
  transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Following RNA Pol II-mediated transcription,
  the first of two enzymatic cleavages produce pre-miRNAs. Drosha, a type III RNase,
  along with the cofactor DGCR8, binds to the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcript.
  Two RNase domains that are present in Drosha mediate the cleavage of the 3′ and
  5′ strands of pri-miRNAs to generate pre-miRNA (). Next, the exportin 5–RAN∙GTP
  complex (XPO 5) mediates the movement of pre-miRNAs from the nucleus into the cytosol.
  There, the RNase III Dicer combinding with TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) binds
  to the pre-miRNAs and cleaves the terminal loop, producing a miRNA duplex. Then,
  incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), miRNA duplex is processed
  by the argonaute (AGO) family of proteins to get the matured single-strand miRNA.
  For the function of miR-27a, on the one hand, the main function of the miRNA is
  that binding to selected mRNA to form a slienced mRNA duplex. On the other hand,
  miR-27a can form exosomes to release in to bloodstream. It is reported that miR-27a
  can regulate the immune system by affecting dentritic cells and macrophages. It
  is also reported that the exosomal miR-27a can regulate the EMT of cancer cells.
  Furthermore, the exosomal miR-27a in the bloodstream gives us new method of early
  diagnosis of cancers.

  description: Overview of microRNA-27a biogenesis, highlighting key enzymes in miRNA
    biogenesis. miRNAs are produced in a tightly regulated pathway which is conserved
