caption: 'Signaling and gene regulation of the canonical cell autonomous unfolded
  protein response (UPR). The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) induces the three signaling cascades initiated by the transmembrane
  proteins: IRE1, ATF6 and PERK. This results in the inhibition of protein translation
  through PERK and the production of active transcription factors: XBP1s, ATF6 and
  ATF4 via IRE1, ATF6 and PERK, respectively. Upon translocation to the nucleus, XBP1s
  and ATF6 bind in different compositions to specific promoter sequences, including
  ERSE, ERSE-II and UPRE, and initiate transcription of multiple UPR genes, including
  ER chaperones and ERAD genes. Nuclear ATF4 binds the CARE promoter motif and induces
  CHOP transcription, which in turn increases GADD34 levels, thereby providing negative
  feedback in the PERK pathway. For details see main text.'
