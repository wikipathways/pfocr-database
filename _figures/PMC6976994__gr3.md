caption: Mechanistic aspects of DME regulation in mouse liver tumors with mutations
  in either the Ctnnb1, Hras, or Braf oncogene. Signaling through β-catenin affects
  DME gene expression by different mechanisms involving β-catenin/TCF-dependent promoter
  activation and various ways of cooperation with nuclear xeno-sensing receptors,
  e.g., AHR and CAR. Moreover, synthesis of the CYP prosthetic group heme is augmented
  by β-catenin signaling in hepatocytes. Tumors with mutationally activated HA-RAS
  harbor high levels of phosphorylated, active extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK) 1/2. Phosphorylated ERK retains the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)
  in the cytosol to inhibit DME induction by CAR agonists. This phenomenon is not
  observed in tumors with mutationally activated B-RAF, where ERK phosphorylation
  is much less pronounced. Antagonistic action of the DME-inhibiting mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the DME-inducing β-catenin pathway have been described,
  for example via the induction of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSP) by the β-catenin
  pathway. For more details, please refer to the main text.
