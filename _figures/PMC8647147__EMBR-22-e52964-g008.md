caption: Impairment of mitochondrial function through mutation of nuo‐6 or isp‐1,
  which affects the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leads to the activation
  of the mitoUPR and nuclear localization of DAF‐16. The mitoUPR transcription factor
  ATFS‐1 can bind directly to innate immunity genes to increase their expression.
  The activation of ATFS‐1 is also sufficient to decrease food consumption. As decreasing
  food consumption decreases activation of the p38‐mediated innate immune signaling
  pathway, the ATFS‐1‐mediated decrease in food consumption should result in decreased
  signaling through the p38‐mediated innate immune signaling pathway. This signaling
  pathway terminates with the ATF‐7 transcription factor that can bind to the same
  genes as ATFS‐1. ATFS‐1 also acts to facilitate the nuclear localization of DAF‐16,
  which modulates the expression of a separate set of genes that promotes survival
  of bacterial pathogens and longevity. DAF‐16 acts to decrease food intake, thereby
  decreasing signaling through the p38‐mediated innate immune signaling pathway. DAF‐16,
  ATFS‐1, and all of the components of the p38‐mediated innate immune signaling pathway
  (NSY‐1, SEK‐1, PMK‐1, and ATF‐7) are required for the increased resistance to bacterial
  pathogens and increased lifespan in nuo‐6 and isp‐1 mutants.
