caption: Diagram showing curcumin and its potential inhibitory effects on the metabolic
  pathway of arachidonic acid. The anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin can be
  attributed to its effects on many molecular targets, 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase
  to name a few. Curcumin has been found to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase in-vitro in a concentration
  dependent manner in mouse epidermal cells[]. The proposed mechanism of cyclooxygenase
  (COX) inhibition is believed to be due to the inhibition of Nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation[].
