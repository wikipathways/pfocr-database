caption: Lipoprotein starvation-induced perturbation of central metabolic pathways.
  Identified intermediates within glycolysis (A), TCA cycle and linked amino acid
  pathways (B), methionine cycle and transulphuration pathway (C), proline metabolism
  (D), choline pathway (E), and nucleotide metabolism (F) are depicted in black, with
  unidentified intermediates in red. (A–E) Heatmaps represent peak intensity fold
  changes between lipoprotein-replete and -deplete conditions in U373 (left box),
  KNS42 (middle box), and SF188 (right box) cells. Colour scales indicating the fold
  change range are specific to each panel. (F) Log2-fold peak intensity changes in
  nucleotide metabolism intermediates in U373 (red), KNS42 (blue), and SF188 (green)
  cells. Results are the mean of n = 6 independent replicates.
