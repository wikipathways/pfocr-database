caption: Signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of the human CD28 and its binding
  partners. The human CD28 possesses a 41 amino acid-long cytoplasmic tail that includes
  three potential protein-protein interaction motifs (highlighted in red). The phospho-Tyr173
  within the YMNM motif serves as a docking site for the SH2-containing proteins,
  p85, GRB2 and GADS. The PRRP motif can interact with the SH3 domain of ITK and LCK.
  The PYAP motif can interact with the SH3 domain of GRB2, GADS, and LCK.
