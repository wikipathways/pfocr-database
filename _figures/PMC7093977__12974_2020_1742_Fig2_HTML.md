caption: Lipid mediators influencing phagocytosis in microglia. In Alzheimer’s disease,
  microglia cells majorly drive neuroinflammation. Microglia cells show pro-inflammatory
  and anti-inflammatory phenotype depending upon the presence of lipid-mediators,
  receptors expressed, and cytokine secretion. The classical inflammatory phase is
  marked by the presence of inflammatory cytokines, whereas alternative activation
  state, i.e., phagocytic state, shows anti-inflammatory state, which drives the clearance
  of debris, accumulated proteins, etc. Free fatty acids cleaved from cell membrane
  through action of phospholipase enzymes are targeted to lipid mediator’s synthesis.
  These lipid mediators then trigger the type of reaction given by microglia cells.
  Lipid mediators show response depending upon the type of receptors that they bind
  to microglia cells. PGD2 and PGJ2 stimulate anti-inflammatory response, and they
  target microglia through DP-1 receptor and exert its anti-inflammatory response
  through translocation of nuclear receptor PPAR-γ to nucleus increasing production
  of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which resolves chronic inflammation; IL-10
  has anti-inflammatory property, which is a key regulator of phagocytic phenotype.
  The E-series (RvE1, RvE2, RvE3) and D-series (RvD, RvD1, RvD2, RvD3) resolvins synthesized
  from EPA and DHA are together called as SPM (specialized pre-resolving mediators).
  Protectins (NPD1) suppresses pro-inflammatory response by blocking IKK (activator
  of NF-κB) and NF-κB and increasing IKB (inhibitor of kappa B). SPM also regulates
  translocation of NF-κB into nucleus and successive production of inflammatory cytokine
  (IL-1β, TNF-α); hence, by blocking the NF-κB pathway, SPMs can resolve inflammatory
  phase efficiently. SPM increases phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies, which includes
  Aβ protein. Maresin-1, a DHA-derived lipid mediator, which is one of the SPM, has
  specialty to drive the polarization of microglia from inflammatory to anti-inflammatory
  phenotype and imparts tissue regeneration
