caption: (A) CERT and VAP-A are recruited to the inclusion. CERT transfers ceramide
  from the ER to the inclusion. Inclusion membrane localized SMS2 converts ceramide
  to SM, which accumulates on the inclusion membrane and on RBs. (B) Alternatively,
  or in addition, CERT promotes recruitment of ER-Golgi MCS to the vicinity of the
  inclusion, promoting efficient SM synthesis near the inclusion. SM is then transferred
  to the inclusion by a BFA-insensitive pathway. (C) GBF1-dependent activation of
  Arf1 mediates vesicular trafficking of SM-containing vesicles to the inclusion for
  membrane growth and stability. (D) GBF1 activity contributes to the arrangement
  of the actin and vimentin networks around the inclusion for additional stability.
  CERT is essential for bacterial replication whereas GBF1 is important for inclusion
  membrane growth and stability. MCS, membrane contact site; TGN, trans-Golgi network.
