caption: 'Oncogenic BRAF signaling: The mutated BRAF, constitutively activates MEK
  and ERK phosphorylation and pathway activation which at the signals cell proliferation.
  Inhibition of MEK pathway by trematinib (blue arrow T) and blockage of mutated BRAF
  by dabrafenib (green arrow D) suppresses constituve action of the mutated BRAF,
  further inhibiting at two levels the molecule-pathological pathway. Abbreviations:
  MEK, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ERK, extracellular
  signal-related kinase.'
