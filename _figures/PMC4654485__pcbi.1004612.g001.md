caption: (A) VEGF mRNA were targeted by miRISC and inaccessible for translation in
  normoxia. (B) HIF-1 proteins that were stabilized in hypoxia induced let-7 biogenesis,
  which led to the downregulation of AGO1 mRNA, protein and miRISC formation. VEGF
  mRNA were desuppressed and ready for translation because of reduced miRISC activities.
