caption: Strategies for editing a signaling pathway. (A) Signaling pathway where there
  is a mutation in the inhibitory gene that prevents the correct folding of encoded
  protein and therefore its function as an inhibitor. Indents B-E display different
  strategies that can be approached for preventing that inhibitory protein from being
  produced. (B) Knockout of the gene that codes for receptor, preventing it from acting
  on the pre-enzyme and from producing activator protein. (C) Knockout of the gene
  that codes for pre-enzyme, preventing it from acting on the pre-activator protein
  and from producing activator protein. (D) Knockout of the gene coding for pre-activator
  protein, preventing the enzyme acting on it from producing activator protein. (E)
  Mutation of the binding site of promoter so that the activator protein cannot bind.
  Indents F-I display different strategies that can be applied for the production
  of inhibitory protein. (F) Edition of a defective gene to restore production of
  an inhibitory protein to produce a functional inhibitory protein. (G) In the case
  that mutations in the inhibitor gene are difficult to repair, the pseudogene inhibitor
  is repaired to produce a functional inhibitory protein. (H) If a deleterious mutation
  is difficult to repair and causes the accumulation of a misfolded protein, the gene
  could be totally inactivated and the pseudogene can be reactivated to produce a
  functional protein. (I) Another strategy is the addition of the functional cDNA
  of the inhibitor gene in any of the genes or pseudogene stimulated by the activator
  protein. (J) Finally, mutation of the enhancer results in reduced production of
  inhibitory protein.
