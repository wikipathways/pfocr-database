caption: 'A) Prior to engagement with Notch in trans, Dl exists in two forms: free,
  and sequestered in cis with Notch; both forms can be internalized via non-Epsin
  routes. Binding to Notch in trans induces a race between ubiquitination of Dl in
  the sending cell (B) and uptake of Dl into the receiving cell (C).B) Sending cell
  wins: Epsin targets ubiquitinated Dl for Clathrin mediated endocytosis, applying
  force across the ligand receptor bridge that opens up the NRR (depicted as a spring)
  to uncover the S2 site for cleavage. Ectodomain shedding renders the remainder of
  the receptor subject to S3 cleavage, allowing the cytosolic domain to enter the
  nucleus and activate target genes. The available evidence suggests that Dl ubiquitination
  is normally induced by receptor binding (see ).C) Receiving cell wins: Ligand is
  internalized in its entirety by receptor-mediated ligand transendocytosis, possibly
  by engulfment of a patch of the sending cell surface in which the ligand is embedded,
  as depicted. Under normal conditions, receptor induced ubiquitination of ligand
  triggers Epsin-dependent S2 cleavage of the receptor before the receptor can transendocytose
  the ligand. However, manipulations or natural processes that compromise access of
  ligand to the Epsin/Clathin pathway, tip the competition in favor of the receiving
  cell, quenching the signal.'
