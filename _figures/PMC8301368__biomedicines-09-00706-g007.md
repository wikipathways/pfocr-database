caption: Activation states of canonical Wnt signaling pathway and possible regulation
  by PAF/PTAFR or PAF-AH. Inactivation of GSK3β by phosphorylation at S9 either in
  the presence of Wnt ligands or following signal transduction through PAF/PTAFR/AKT
  (left) led to accumulation of non-phosphorylated β-catenin and translocation in
  the nucleus [,]. There, β-catenin displaces Groucho/TLE repressors from transcription
  factors Tcf/Lef and activates transcription of Wnt-responsive genes []. In the absence
  of Wnt ligands or PAF signaling, e.g., through enhanced PAF degradation by PAF-AH
  (right), β-catenin is marked by active GSK3β for ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation [,].
