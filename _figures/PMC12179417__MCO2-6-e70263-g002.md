caption: Endoplasmic reticulum stress affects the function of dendritic cells and
  T cells, leading to immune evasion. (A) In DC cells, the activation of the inositol‐requiring
  enzyme 1 α (IRE1α)–X‐box binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathway enhances the transcription
  of many triglyceride production genes. This results in a substantial rise in lipid
  droplets and total triglyceride levels in the cytoplasm, thereby diminishing the
  capacity of dendritic cells to process and present antigens. Furthermore, antigenic
  peptides can directly activate IRE1α and diminish major histocompatibility complex
  I (MHC‐I) heavy chain mRNA via regulated IRE1‐dependent decay (RIDD), leading to
  decreased antigen presentation. (B) Glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) diminishes
  on both CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This
  leads to decreased glucose absorption by T cells, inhibiting glycolysis, affecting
  N‐junction protein glycosylation, and causing endoplasmic reticulum stress. The
  activation of the IRE1α–XBP1 pathway obstructs glutamine inflow, resulting in the
  inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. XBP1 simultaneously upregulates the expression
  of many inhibitory receptors, resulting in the attenuation of the antitumor activity
  of CD8+ T lymphocytes. The protein kinase R‐like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)–activating
  transcription factor 4 (ATF4)–C/EBP‐homologous protein (CHOP) pathway was activated,
  resulting in the direct inhibition of T‐bet levels. PERK also directly stimulates
  endoplasmic oxidoreductase 1 α (ERO1α), leading to a substantial elevation in reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) levels. The buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads
  to mitochondrial dysfunction, impairing the functionality of CD8+ T lymphocytes
