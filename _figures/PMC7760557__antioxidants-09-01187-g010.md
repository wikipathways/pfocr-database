caption: 'Proposed mechanism of melatonin in mitochondria of NLRP3−/− mice during
  cardiac aging. Lack of NLRP3 inflammasome reduced mitochondria dysfunction. (A)
  Mitochondrial dynamics: the absence of NLRP3 prevented the decline in fusion (Mfn2
  and Opa1) and fission proteins (Opa1) with aging. Melatonin treatment had no effect
  on these mice. (B) Autophagy (mitophagy): autophagic capacity was restored by NLRP3
  deficiency. Melatonin therapy had minimal impact on autophagic capacity. (C) Intrinsic
  and (D) extrinsic apoptosis: loss of NLRP3 had an anti-apoptotic effect in Bax/Blc2
  ratio, but not in p53 or caspase 9. The ablation of this inflammasome could trigger
  extrinsic apoptosis mediated by TNFα binding to death receptor. Melatonin supplementation
  had an anti-apoptotic effect in p53 and caspase 9. (E) Nrf2-dependent antioxidant
  response: lack of NLRP3 did not recover the decrease of this antioxidant pathway
  with aging. Only Nqo1 were not diminished in mutant mice. Melatonin improved this
  antioxidant pathway. No changes in Keap1 were reported. Red-purple arrow: impact
  of aging. Green-blue arrow: effect of melatonin treatment.'
