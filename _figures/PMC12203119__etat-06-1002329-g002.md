caption: 'Intestinal immunity and microbiota in gut health. (A) The mucus layer forms
  the first line of defense in the GI tract to prevent microbial attachment to epithelial
  cells. (B) Antimicrobial peptides, including defensins, cathelicidins, and C-type
  lectins, secreted by Paneth cells and other epithelial cells, inhibit microbes.
  (C) Secretory IgA traps pathogens and toxins in the mucus. Polysaccharide A and
  butyrate from commensal bacteria promote Treg-mediated anti-inflammatory responses.
  (D) Pattern recognition receptors like TLRs and NLRs detect microbial-associated
  molecular patterns. This triggers the immune response pathway involving MyD88, TRIF,
  MAPK, and NFκB to protect intestinal cells. Activation of these pathways regulates
  immune responses and inflammation, and the acute immune response protects the intestinal
  epithelium. However, in the presence of chronic inflammation, this regulation is
  lost and results in IBD. AMPs: antimicrobial peptides; DAMP: damage-associated molecular
  pattern; GI: gastrointestinal; IBD: inflammatory bowel disease; IL: interleukin;
  LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinases; MyD88: myeloid
  differentiation primary response 88; NLR: NOD-like receptor; PAMP: pathogen-associated
  molecular pattern; TGF-β: transforming growth factor beta; TLR: Toll-like receptor;
  Treg: regulatory T; TRIF: TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β. Created
