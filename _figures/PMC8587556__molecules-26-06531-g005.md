caption: 'HupA rescues mitochondrial integrity after exposure to Aβ. Aβ crosses the
  mitochondrial double membrane and aggregates in the matrix. Mitochondrial perturbations
  include changes in morphology, compromised TCA cycle and reduced CytoC oxidase activity.
  Cell death is initiated by releasing proteins from intermembrane and intracristal
  spaces which activates caspases and AIF (caspase-independent apoptosis pathway).
  Outer membrane permeabilization leads to mitochondrial metabolic failure with subsequent
  mitochondrial swelling, ROS accumulation and neuronal death. HupA treatment prevents
  Aβ accumulation in the matrix as well as Aβ interaction with mitochondrial proteins.
  HupA prevents the release of CytoC and subsequent apoptosis. It also rescues overall
  membrane stability, thus protecting mitochondrial enzymatic activity, membrane potential,
  and ATP formation. HupA also enriches proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation,
  improving mitochondrial respiration (ABAD: amyloid beta-binding alcohol dehydrogenase;
  CAT: catalase; GSH-PX: glutathione peroxidase; SOD: superoxide dismutase; ROS: reactive
  oxygen species; IMS: intermembrane space; CytoC: cytochrome C; Cas-3: caspase-3;
  AIF: apoptosis inducing factor).'
