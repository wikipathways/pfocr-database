caption: Schematic representation of the differences between oxidative phosphorylation,
  anaerobic glycolysis, and aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) in animals and iron
  deficiency-induced metabolic responses in plant cells. In the presence of oxygen,
  normal cells (both animal and plant) first metabolize glucose to pyruvate via glycolysis
  and then completely oxidize most of that pyruvate in the mitochondria during oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXOPHOS). When oxygen is limiting, cells can redirect the pyruvate
  generated by glycolysis away from mitochondrial OXOPHOS by inducing a fermentative
  pathway (anaerobic glycolysis). The Warburg effect observed in cancer cells tend
  to convert most glucose to lactate regardless of whether oxygen is present or not
  (aerobic glycolysis). A similar Warburg effect could be observed also in Fe-deficient
  plant cell, in which the slowed OXOPHOS, because of the lack of Fe, determine the
  up-regulation of glycolysis–fermentative reactions. Since this metabolic switch
  occurred in the presence of oxygen, we can consider it as the induction of aerobic
  glycolysis. (The Figure is a adaptation/reinterpretation of Figure 2 reported in
  Vander Heiden et al., ).
