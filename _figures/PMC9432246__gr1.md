caption: Sites of the C1 esterase inhibitor action in the complement system, contact
  system and fibrinolytic pathway.C1-INH, C1 esterase inhibitor; HAE-C1-INH, hereditary
  angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency; HMW kininogen, high-molecular-weight
  kininogen; C1qC1rCs, components q, r and s of the first fraction of the complement;
  C4, component C4 of the complement.C1-INH physiologically inhibits the complement
  system, the fibrinolytic pathway and the contact system. The sites of C1-INH action
  in these pathways are indicated with a red line. In HAE-C1-INH there is a deficiency
  of C1-INH, with greater activation of these systems, which interact with each other
  with higher production of bradykinin that binds to B2 receptors in the endothelial
  cell, increasing vascular permeability with the formation of angioedema.
