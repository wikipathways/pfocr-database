caption: 'In the early steps of the interaction, Trichoderma secreted MAMPs that triggered
  activation of signal transduction which modulated the expression of several genes.
  Among them, genes that have been previously shown to have a role in biosynthesis
  and response to JA, ethylene (Et; significant enrichment, FDR: P<0.01) and auxin
  (non-significant enrichment). Based on previously published data, we propose two
  main biological roles for the activation of those phyto-hormone related pathways
  in the plant-Trichoderma interaction: (i) colonization regulated by JA and ethylene,
  and (ii) lateral root formation regulated by JA and ethylene. Intermediate metabolites
  in the biosynthesis pathways are indicated by bold frame. Genes mediating the biosynthesis
  process are indicated without frame or marked in blue in case they show a significant
  (P<0.05) change in expression level upon Trichoderma colonization. Down-regulated
  genes are underlined. The model is based on the following published studies , ,
  –, , – and the oxylipins pathway (based on KEGG pathways). Gene names are in conformity
  with TAIR annotation.'
