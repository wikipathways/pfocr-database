caption: The Frizilator and the reversal generator are shown to the right of the dashed
  vertical line. That circuit is always active and it regulates swarming. The C-signal,
  which appears shortly after starvation induces fruiting body development, is a 17
  kDa cell surface protein. Cells must make end-to-end contact with each other to
  transmit the signal. The C-signal transduction pathway is shown to the left of the
  dashed vertical line. FruA, a response regulator, that has been activated by C-signaling
  is symbolized FruA*. It may include FruA∼P.
