caption: Besides well-known EGFR signaling pathways that link to the cell invasion
  and migration via activation of Ser/Thr kinases, EGFR can evoke a novel pathway
  that leads to the cancer invasion and metastasis, in which phosphorylated Tyr1068
  or Tyr1086 binds directly to the PH domain of GEP100. Through this binding, GEP100
  activates Arf6 and its downstream signaling pathway employing AMAP1 as its effector.
  For functioning of this pathway, it is prerequisite that both Arf6 and AMAP1 are
  highly overexpressed, and that Tyr1068 or Tyr1086 is highly phosphorylated. This
  EGFR-GEP100-Arf6-AMAP1 pathway plays pivotal roles not only in the formation and
  function of invadopodia, but also in perturbation of the E-cadherin-based cell–cell
  adhesion. Arf6 can be ubiquitinated by Fbx8, a component of the SCF complex. Loss
  of Fbx8 expression is frequently observed in different breast cancer cells, and
  contributes to their invasiveness. Monoubiquitination of AMAP1 by Cbl, via AMAP1's
  binding to CIN85, is also necessary for the invasion.
