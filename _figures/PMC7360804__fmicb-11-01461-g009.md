caption: A proposed signaling pathway involved in SeMet against ESBL E. coli-induced
  inflammation. Note that SeMet protects bMECs and macrophages against inflammation
  by inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Meanwhile, SeMet suppressed NF-κB
  pathway through SeS and inhibited NF-κB-reduced inflammation. Green arrow and red
  bar indicate stimulation and inhibition, respectively.
