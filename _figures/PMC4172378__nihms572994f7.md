caption: 'Ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway. Each compound in the pathway is identified
  by a Roman numeral. Under anaerobic conditions, there are alternate hydroxylases
  for the three enzymes incorporating molecular oxygen (UbiB, UbiH, and UbiF). It
  should be noted that in compound (XXI), the chemical numbering system locates the
  prenyl side chain at the C-3 carbon; in compound (XXII) and subsequent intermediates,
  the prenyl side chain is assigned to C-2. Compounds (XXV), (XXVI), and (XXVII),
  are drawn in the quinol form. Some authors draw these structures in the quinone
  form. For other abbreviations see legend to . The chemical names for the intermediates
  of the pathway are as follows: (IV), chorismate; (XX), 4-hydroxybenzoate; (XXI),
  3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate; (XXII), 2-octaprenylphenol; (XXIII), 2-octaprenyl-6-hydroxyphenol;
  (XIV), 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxyphenol; (XXV), 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol;
  (XXVI), 2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-6 methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol; (XXVII), 2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol;
  (XXVIII), ubiquinol; (I), Q, ubiquinone. The conversion of (XXVIII) to (I) is thought
  to be non-enzymatic.'
