caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism of PP26 induction of G2/M-phase
  arrest in HepG2 cells. The Myt1 protein kinase functions to negatively regulate
  Cdc2-cyclin B complexes by phosphorylating Cdc2. Akt-mediated GSK3β and FoxO3a signaling
  is involved in the apoptosis of cancer cells. Our study showed that PP-26 caused
  upregulation of p21 and Myt-1 expression, phosphorylation of cdc2 at Tyr15, and
  inhibition of the production of the cdc2/cyclin B complex. Inhibition of the Akt
  pathway is important in PP-26 mitochondrial-associated apoptosis in HepG2 cells
