caption: Biological Functions of Bioactive Phospholipids. S1P is generated through
  phosphorylation of sphingosine by SK. S1P mediates tumor cell proliferation, invasion,
  angiogenesis, drug resistance and immune escape. Moreover, AC can decompose the
  pro-death sphingolipid ceramide to generate sphingosine, which subsequently generates
  S1P. AC and S1P can activate the NF-κB pathway, and mediating the expression of
  the drug efflux pump P-gp. The bioactive phospholipids such as S1P, C1P, LPC and
  LPA can stimulate the p42/44 MAPK and AKT signaling pathways. Moreover, as substances
  that can inhibit the migration of hematological cells, HO-1 and iNOS can be down-regulated
  by bioactive phospholipids in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner, thereby promoting the
  migration and adhesion of human leukemia cells.
