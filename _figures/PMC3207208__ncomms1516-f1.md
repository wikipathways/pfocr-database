caption: The AND gate is designed on the basis of the σ54-dependent hrpR/hrpS hetero-regulation
  module. Two environment-responsive promoters, P1 and P2, act as the inputs to drive
  the transcriptions of hrpR and hrpS, and respond to the small molecules I1 and I2,
  respectively. The transcription of the output hrpL promoter is turned on only when
  both proteins HrpR and HrpS are present and bind the upstream activator sequence
  to remodel the closed σ54-RNAP-hrpL transcription complex to an open one through
  ATP hydrolysis. The output shown is a gfp reporter. The RBS is used for tuning the
  dynamic range of the device inputs or output. The regulatory promoter inputs and
  gfp output are both interchangeable. The AND gate is orthogonal to the E. coli genetic
  background and is independent of its normally used σ70-dependent transcriptional
  pathway.
