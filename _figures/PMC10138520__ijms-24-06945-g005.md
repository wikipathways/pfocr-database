caption: Lipid metabolic reprogramming in TNBC. The key lipogenic enzyme acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (ACC) irreversibly catalyzes acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA in the mitochondrial
  membrane, which is an inhibitor of CPT1 and FAO. FAO flux in TNBC is promoted by
  downregulated ACC, which may also be caused by AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)
  signaling. The resulting increase in cellular acetyl-CoA promotes EMT-inducing Smad2
  (SMAD Family Member 2) acetylation and ultimately, activation of EMT pathways and
  metastasis. Upregulated AKR1B1 in TNBC activates the NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa
  B) signaling through its accumulated metabolite PGF, which leads to the overexpression
  of Twist2 and enhances cancer stem cell (CSC) properties in TNBC. Higher asparagine
  levels are associated with less metastatic potential in TNBC by activation of Twist1
  molecule through downregulation of the inhibitor asparaginase.
