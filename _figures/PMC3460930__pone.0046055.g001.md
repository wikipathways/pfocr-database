caption: (A) Lovastatin-induced apoptosis is regulated in part by the inhibition of
  the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mimicking growth factor withdrawal and
  the induction of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) through induction of GCN2.
  In this study, we evaluated the potential of lovastatin to activate the LKB1/AMPK
  pathway that is induced upon ATP depletion. (B) Western blot analysis of SCC25 cells
  treated for 24 hrs showing lovastatin regulation of downstream targets of the EGFR
  (pAKT), the ISR (ATF3) and common targets of all three pathways including the cell
  cycle regulators cyclinD1and p21 and a regulator of protein translation, 4EBP1.
  Densitometric analysis of 4EBP1 is presented where the ratio of p4EBP1 to 4EBP1
  expression was determined with the control untreated SCC25 cell line value represented
  as 1.00 for ease of presentation.
