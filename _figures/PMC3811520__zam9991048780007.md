caption: The proposed biosynthesis pathway of succinoyl trehalose lipids from alkanes.
  There are three general phases in STL production from alkanes. The alkane metabolism
  phase requires AlkB as the initial enzyme, and Fda works as a gluconeogenesis enzyme
  for trehalose backbone synthesis. In the final step of STL biosynthesis, TlsA transfers
  acyl groups to trehalose or its derivatives. TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
