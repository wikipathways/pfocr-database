caption: The expression profile of candidate genes involved in soluble sugar metabolic
  pathway in pomegranate. The heatmap of each DEG was constructed based on log2 (TPM)
  and the values were rowscaled. The color range from red to blue represents the log2
  (TPM) value, in which red color denotes genes with high expression levels, and blue
  color means low expression. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Fru, fructose; F6P,
  fructose–6–phosphate; F1,6P, fructose–1,6–phosphate; Glu, glucose; G3P, glyceraldehyde
  3–phosphate; G–6–P, glucose–6–phosphate; Suc, sucrose; S–6–P, sucrose–6–phosphate;SPP,
  sucrose phosphatase phosphorylase. The probable direction of reversible reactions
  is indicated by the large arrow
