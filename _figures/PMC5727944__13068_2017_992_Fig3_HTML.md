caption: Metabolic pathways and metabolic engineering strategies for the production
  of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO). 1,3-PDO can be produced from glucose by glycerol-dependent
  pathway (route ①, illustrated by green colors) or by a non-natural homoserine-derived
  pathway (route ②, illustrated by yellow colors). To generate a 1,3-PDO hyperproducer
  via glycerol-dependent pathways, different byproduct synthetic pathways should be
  blocked as illustrated by red cross marks. ackA acetate kinase, aldA/aldB aldehyde
