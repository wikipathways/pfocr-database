caption: 'Overview of the cellular mechanism of HSC activation in the liver. Chronic
  injury to hepatocytes caused by infections, drugs, toxins, alcohol abuse, or metabolic
  liver disease leads to hepatocyte death and the release of DAMPs, apoptotic bodies,
  and ROS. These signals activate quiescent HSCs, stimulate resident Kupffer cells,
  and recruit additional immune cells, setting off complex, multidirectional interactions
  that promote the transdifferentiation of HSCs into proliferative, ECM-producing
  myofibroblasts. Kupffer cells and recruited macrophages respond to DAMPs by producing
  a wide array of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This proinflammatory milieu
  helps recruit both innate and adaptive immune cells, amplifying profibrogenic pathways
  throughout the liver. In particular, Kupffer cells secrete IL-6 and TNFα, both of
  which are strongly proinflammatory. TNFα also induces hepatocyte apoptosis and neutrophil
  activation, which further supports HSC survival and proliferation. Certain chemokines,
  such as CCL2 and CCL5, play pivotal roles in immune cell recruitment. CCL2 activates
  Kupffer cells in an autocrine manner while also inducing proinflammatory gene expression
  in HSCs; both CCL2 and CCL5 help recruit additional immune cells. Moreover, CCL5
  itself recruits and activates HSCs. Kupffer cells also increase the survival of
  activated HSCs by releasing PDGF, a primary mitogen for HSCs, and TGFβ. Once activated,
  HSCs secrete latent TGFβ, establishing an autocrine positive feedback loop that
  maintains their activated state. HSCs are recognized as the predominant source of
  myofibroblasts in liver fibrosis, producing up to 90% of the ECM in this context.
  The ongoing release of proinflammatory factors, growth factors, and cytokines combined
  with autocrine stimulation by TGFβ ultimately drives HSC activation, ECM deposition,
  and the progression of fibrosis. Abbreviations: CCL, C-C motif chemokine ligand;
