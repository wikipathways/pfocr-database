caption: Upon binding to graft microvascular endothelial cells (EC), leukocytes, inflammatory
  cytokines, growth factors (incl. VEGF, ) and alloantibodies activate PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated
  signals. Assembly of mTORC2 complex results in the phosphorylation and activation
  of the Akt kinase, that in turn activates mTORC1 and its substrates 4EBP1 and S6K1.
  Collectively, these signals result in EC activation, migration and proliferation.
  In addition, Akt-mediated signals enhance the activity of ERK1/2, which also promotes
  EC activation. The endogenous protein DEPTOR inhibits mTORC1 and ERK1/2, as well
  as STAT-1 signaling in EC, highlighting its major function as a cell-intrinsic regulatory
  of EC activation responses. Several miRNAs have been found to control the activity
  of the mTOR pathway as well as endothelial cell activation. Notably, endothelial
  specific miR-126 functions to inactivate both PI3K/Akt- and ERK1/2-mediated signals
  and thus maintain EC quiescence.
