caption: (a) TNF-⍺ increases the expression of Snail and Slug, regulates the expression
  of Twist, and inhibits GSK-3β through the phosphorylation of NF-κβ and Akt signaling
  pathways that induce the stabilization of Slug and β-catenin, promoting the induction
  of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). (b) The overregulation of Snail in conjunction
  with claudin-11 is related to the promotion of cancer stem cells (CSC) and circulating
  tumor cells (CTC). (c) The stabilization and overregulation of Slug are related
  to the inhibition of E-cadherin. (d) The low expression of E-cadherin induces the
  cytoplasmic overexpression of Twist and release of β-catenin to the cytoplasm, WNT
  canonic pathway activation, nuclear translocation of β-catenin and c-myc, and cyclin
  D1 amplification; the nuclear expression of Twist induces the loss of E-cadherin.
  (e) Viral HPV particles promote EMT by inducing the overexpression of Snail, Slug,
  and Twist and promoting the low expression of E-cadherin. (f) Latent membrane protein
  1 (LMP1) is related to several signaling pathways that promote EMT via the induction
  of Snail and inhibition of E-cadherin, which is also related to the overexpression
  of Twist and inhibition of FOXA1-associated promotion of EMT.
