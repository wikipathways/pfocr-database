caption: Targeting neurotrophins is one candidate for a new treatment strategy for
  PDAC. We retrieved associated molecules from QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
  This network was generated, mainly focusing on TRK, through the use of QIAGEN Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis. Direct interactions are shown in this network (excluding indirect
  interactions). The molecules with the green outline are components of the canonical
  pathway of axon guidance signaling. The nodes filled in with yellow are neurotrophins,
  their receptors. Emerging evidence has shown that TRK inhibitors (blue) link together
  with the yellow nodes (blue arrow lines). Furthermore, we have delineated the molecules
  of axon guidance signaling, which previously have demonstrated a direct relationship
  to not only cancer growth but also neurotrophins and their receptors. This network
  reveals that neurotrophins and their receptors are linked to PDAC progression via
  various molecules and signaling pathways. The established network reveals that several
  tropomyosin receptor kinase inhibitors would have anti‐cancer effects by suppressing
  the neurotrophin‐related pathways in PDAC
