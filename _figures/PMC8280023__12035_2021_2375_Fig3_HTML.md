caption: Microbial metabolites affect neuronal mitochondrial function through different
  pathways in PD. Mitochondria are responsible for the production of adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) via the combined efforts of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory
  chain/oxidative phosphorylation system (OxPhos). The respiratory chain is a set
  of biochemically linked complexes, namely complexes I, II, III, and IV with two
  electron carriers, namely ubiquinone/CoQ and Cyt c. The energy stored in food was
  used by the respiratory chain to generate a proton gradient across the mitochondrial
  inner membrane, while at the same time transferring electrons to oxygen and producing
  water. The energy of the proton gradient drives ATP synthesis via ATP synthase (complex
  V). Gut microbial metabolites have multiple regulatory effects on the mitochondrial
  function, including regulating complex I (TUDCA, NAM, NAD), the Cyt-c-induced caspase-dependent
  apoptosis pathway (histamine), beta-oxidation and acetylation (SCFA), PINK1/Parkin-induced
  mitophagy (TUDCA), and mitochondrial dynamics (SCFA). MPTP and rotenone mainly inhibit
  the function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by damaging mitochondrial complex
  I, leading to bioenergetics failure and subsequent cell death, and they are often
  used as inducers of PD animal and cell models. TUDCA, a taurine-bound form of UDCA,
  is an anti-apoptotic agent by up-regulating mitophagy. TUDCA can upregulate the
  expression of PINK1 and parkin to accelerate the clearance of damaged mitochondria,
  promoting the survival of damaged neurons. Butyrate can prevent mitochondrial energy
  metabolism defects by providing acetyl-CoA, which participates in the mitochondrial
  tricarboxylic acid cycle. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that constantly undergo
  fission and fusion. The transition to fusion optimizes the function of mitochondria
  and helps maintain long-term bioenergy capabilities. Conversely, the transition
  to fission will result in the production of large amounts of mitochondrial fragments
  and autophagy of the damaged mitochondria. Butyrate increases the expression of
  fusion protein mRNA and the transcription of fission protein continues to decrease.
  The guiding effect of SCFAs on mitochondrial dynamics improves the bioenergetic
  efficiency. acyl-CoA, acyl-coenzyme A; acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; ATP, adenosine
