caption: BRAF oncoproteins promote proliferation by constitutively activating the
  MAP kinase pathway. (a) ATP competitive RAF inhibitors (I) disrupt MEK activation
  and prevent proliferation of BRAF-V600E mutated melanomas in a dose dependent manner.
  (b) Wild-type RAF proteins exist largely in an auto-inhibited state. In the context
  of activated RAS, RAF inhibitors stimulate MEK activation at sub-saturating inhibitor
  concentrations by relieving auto-phosphorylation (P) of wild-type RAF, promoting
  RAF dimerization and association with RAS. Saturating inhibitor concentrations prevent
  MEK phosphorylation by blocking all RAF catalysis.
