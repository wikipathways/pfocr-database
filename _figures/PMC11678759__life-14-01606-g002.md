caption: Melatonin has a protective effect on plants in abiotic stress environments,
  and the regulatory pathways associated with melatonin under three stress environments
  (drought, cold, and heat) are illustrated in Figure 2. Red arrows represent promotion
  and upregulation, while green arrows indicate inhibition and downregulation. In
  drought stress, melatonin alters stomatal conductance by affecting NOX and ABA synthesis
  catabolism. Under cold and heat stress, melatonin protects cells by inducing upregulation
  of transcription factors to reduce oxidative damage. Influential factors on the
  dashed boxes indicate pathways that are present in both stresses
