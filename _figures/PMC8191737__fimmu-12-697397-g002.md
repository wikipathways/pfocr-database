caption: Ubiquitination of β-catenin is important for penaeid shrimp antiviral immune
  response. β-catenin is a key regulator in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (1)
  In mammals, β-catenin in cytoplasm could be ubiquitinated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase
  β-TrcP for degradation (, ). (2) In the cytoplasm of shrimp, β-catenin is ubiquitinated
  by WSSV infection, which also promotes the translocation of β-catenin into nucleus
  to inhibit the expression of virus immediate early gene wssv069. β-catenin can also
  interact with wssv069 (). Thus, β-catenin plays a positive role through ubiquitination
  to inhibit WSSV replication during infection. However, which protein could ubiquitinate
  β-catenin in penaeid shrimp has not been found.
