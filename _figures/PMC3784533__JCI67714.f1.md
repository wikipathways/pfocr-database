caption: (A) LDL receptors (LDLRs) on the basolateral hepatocyte surface, SR-BI, CD81,
  and tight-junction proteins CLDN-1 (claudin-1) and OCLN (occludin) are essential
  for HCV uptake (). Intracellular HCV recognition occurs through dsRNA sensors such
  as RIG-I and TLR-3. MAMs function as the central scaffold that coordinates MAVS-dependent
  signaling of the RIG-I pathway between mitochondria and peroxisomes (). MAVS interacts
  with the essential adapter protein TRAF3 to further recruit downstream kinases;
  activation of the kinases IKK-ε and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which phosphorylate
  the transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 (), and binding to NF-κB lead to the induction
  of antiviral and immunomodulatory genes, including types I and III IFNs, as well
  as chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines that function in parallel with IFNs
  to mediate the response to HCV (). (B) Binding of type I IFNs to the IFN-α/β receptors
  (IFN-αR1 and -2) and type III IFNs (IFN-λ) to the heterodimeric IL-28Ra/IL-10Rβ
  receptor () results in activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, conferring stable association
  with IRF-9. The resulting IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcription factor
  complex localizes to the hepatocyte nucleus, where it binds to the ISREs within
  the promoter/enhancer region of hundreds of ISGs (). Autocrine and paracrine signaling
  in neighboring cells results in anti-HCV amplification loops (including IRF-7, which
  binds to IFN promoters). HCV core protein subverts immunity by the induction of
  suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS1/SOCS3) and by impairing the binding of
  ISGF3 to nuclear IFN ISREs (). See text for details.
