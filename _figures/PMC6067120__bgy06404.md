caption: Schematic representation of estrogen metabolism and AHR signaling pathways.
  Full arrows correspond to estrogen metabolism and dashed arrows correspond to AHR
  signaling pathway. 17β-HSD (17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) is inhibited by NSAIDs.
  NQO1 (NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1) and GST (glutathione S-transferases) are
  enzymes which activity is induced by Aspirin. Cyp1A1/A2 and Cyp1B1 are induced by
  AHR activation, however, the use of aspirin could decrease these enzymes.
