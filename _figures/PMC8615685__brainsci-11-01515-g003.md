caption: 'The proposed role of α-synuclein aggregates in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s
  disease via the complement-phagocytic pathway. The phagocytosis of α-synuclein leads
  to the rupture of lysosomes and recruitment of galectin-3, releasing α-synuclein
  aggregates and ROS that activate microglia subsequently. Galectin-3 further activates
  microglia via promoting either NF-κB pathway by directly binding TLR4 or the assembly
  of NLRP3 inflammasomes, resulting in the secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α. These pro-inflammatory
  cytokines cause neurodegeneration directly or through converting neuroprotective
  astrocytes to neurotoxic ones. α-Synuclein aggregates also activate the complement
  system, thereby activating microglia or leading to neurodegeneration through the
  formation of MAC. (C3: complement component 3; C3a: complement component 3a; C4a:
  complement component 4a; IL-1β: interleukin 1-beta; MAC: membrane attack complex;
  NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; NLRP3: the
  NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; ROS: reactive oxygen species; TLR4: Toll-like
  receptor 4; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-alpha).'
