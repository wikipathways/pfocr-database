caption: Model of IL-17 signaling pathway for cSCC. The model is built as network
  of species (oval) and reactions (circle), which are connected by edges. Species
  represent biological entities of the pathway, and are color coded. Dark blue color
  shows processes of autoimmune pathology, neutrophil recruitment, and immunity to
  extracellular pathogens, yellow color depicts DEGs, red color shows inhibitors,
  and sky-blue color represents genes that are part of the pathway, however, not differentially
  expressed. The species MAPKs includes MAPK3, MAPK9, MAPK10, MAPK11, and MAPK14.
  Chemokines includes CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8, and CCL20. The species Anti-microbial includes
  DEFB4A, DEFB4B, S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, and LCN2 genes. Tissue remodeling includes
  MMP1, MMP3, MMP9, and MMP13 genes. C1, C2, C3 and AP-1 are complexes of genes. C1
  includes Hsp90 and Act1. C2 includes TAB2, TAB3 and TAK1 genes. AP-1 includes FOSL1
  and JUN genes.
