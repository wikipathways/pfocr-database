caption: Effect of maternal supraphysiological hypercholesterolemia on the endothelial
  L-arginine/NO signaling pathway. In umbilical vein endothelial cells from pregnancies
  complicated by maternal physiological hypercholesterolemia, the amino acid L-arginine
  is taken up by the human cationic amino acid transporter 1 (hCAT-1) and metabolized
  by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and, to a lesser extent, arginases.
  This phenomenon occurs in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), resulting in
  NO generation. BH4 is generated by the enzyme GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH1), which
  is coded by the gch1 gene and whose substrate is GTP. In cells from pregnancies
  where the pregnant women had maternal supraphysiological hypercholesterolemia, hCAT-1-mediated
  L-arginine transport is increased (⇑), increasing the availability of this amino
  acid for eNOS and arginases. In this pathological condition, L-arginine is mainly
  used by arginases, limiting the formation of NO via eNOS. In addition, eNOS has
  reduced (⇓) activity because of the lower phosphorylation of Ser1177 and the bioavailability
  of BH4. The reduction in the BH4 concentration results from a reduced expression
  of gch1, leading to eNOS uncoupling and the generation of a superoxide anion (O2∙−).
  The O2∙− reacts with NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−; from data in [–, ]).
