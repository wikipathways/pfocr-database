caption: Model for cDC maturation upon virus infection. Virus infection triggers induction
  of both type I IFN and DC maturation through the activation of transcription factors,
  such as IRF3 and NF-κB. DC maturation is characterized by the up-regulation of major
  histocompatibility complex and costimulatory molecules and by the secretion of proinflammatory
  cytokines, such as IL-12. Complete maturation of cDCs in response to virus does
  not rely on secreted type I IFN or TLR signaling. Nevertheless, the concomitant
  activation of the type I IFN induction pathway and DC maturation pathway suggests
  that dsRNA-binding molecules known to be involved in type I IFN induction, such
  as RIG-I or mda-5, may also lead to DC maturation, while the dsRNA-binding protein
  PKR has been shown to be unnecessary for complete DC maturation in response to live
  viruses. Signaling pathways shown in gray are dispensable for complete DC maturation.
