caption: 'Depicted are the different stages of mouse embryonic pancreas development
  in vivo (left), with darker shaded areas representing developmental intermediates
  that have been recapitulated in the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem
  cells (PSCs) to pancreatic beta cells in vitro (center). Critical signaling pathways
  that were identified in embryonic studies (center column, left) are activated or
  inhibited in these protocols using growth factors and small molecules (Pathway activators:
  Wnt, Wnt3a; Nodal, Activin A; FGF, FGF7 or FGF10; BMP, BMP4; GLP1, Exendin 4. Pathway
  inhibitors: PI3K, wortmannin; BMP, noggin; HH, cyclopamine; Notch, DAPT). Markers
  used to identify cells at the indicated developmental stages are shown to the right
  of the center column. Efficient differentiation is indicated by co-expression of
  these markers at the protein level in a high proportion of cells. Evolving iPSC
  technologies are currently being used for reprogramming patient-derived cells into
  autologous PSCs. When efficient, therapeutic-quality differentiation protocols are
  established, iPSCs converted to mature beta cells could be used for cell replacement
  therapy for people with diabetes (right column). PI3K, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase;
