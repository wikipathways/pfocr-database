caption: A possible mechanism by which BMPs and estrogen regulate GNRH production
  by GT1-7 cells. Estradiol suppresses GNRH production by inhibiting ERK1/ERK2 pathway
  via ER. In this feedback system between estradiol and GNRH production, BMP2 and
  BMP4 downregulate estrogen effects by attenuating estrogen-ERK signaling and ERα
  and ERβ expression. In contrast, BMP6 and BMP7 directly stimulate Gnrh transcription,
  GNRH production, and GNRH release via increased expression of α1E-subunit of R-type
  calcium channel, which is critical for GNRH secretion. A new interaction of BMPs
  and ER action may be involved in controlling hypothalamic GNRH production and secretion
  in an autocrine/paracrine mechanism.
