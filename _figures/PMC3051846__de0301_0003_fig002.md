caption: 'CRF1 receptor as the regulator of skin cells functions. Ligand binding to
  CRF1 receptor activates at least three Gα subunits (αs, αi and αq) of G-protein
  resulting in stimulation cAMP production by adenylate cyclase (AC) with subsequent
  cAMP-induced phosphorylation of CREB and activation of cAMP-responsive element (CRE).
  Mobilization of calcium (Ca+2) results in activation of calcium-responsive element
  (CARE). Activation of AP can also trigger mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
  pathway through protein kinase A (PKA). In addition, αq-mediated stimulation of
  phospholipase C results in IP3-driven activation of Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) dependent
  promoters. Downstream signaling from CRF1 receptor regulates expression of several
  genes including POMC, several interleukins, involucrine and cytokeratin 14. The
  phenotypic effects of stimulation include: stimulation of differentiation, steroidogenesis,
  melanogenesis and release of arachidonic acid. CRF inhibits cell division and regulates
  immune response. See text and citations within for details in Zmijewski et al. Reproduced
