caption: Mechanisms and pathways targeted by mutations in MPN. Schematic diagram of
  pathways involved in MPN pathogenesis. Red boxes summarize germ line and somatic
  mutations in MPN and MPN-like phenotypes. Clonal advantage based on cytokine hypersensitivity
  can be triggered by genetic defects directly targeting cytokine receptors, such
  as MPL mutations and EPO-R C-terminal truncations, as well as mutations affecting
  elements of downstream signaling cascades. Defects identified so far in MPN predominantly
  activate the JAK-STAT and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.
  Gain-of-function mutations in JAK2 (JAK2-V617F and JAK2 exon 12 mutations) directly
  affect signal transduction, whereas loss of function mutations in CBL and NF1 intervene
  indirectly. The ubiquitin ligase CBL regulates the degradation of surface receptors
  and JAK2. NF1, a GTPase activating protein decreases signal potential of Ras, an
  important protooncogene in the MAPK pathway. Besides defects in cytokine signal
  transduction, mutations potentially directly affecting gene transcription have been
  found in TET2. TET2 might be involved in epigenetic transcriptional regulation by
  enzymatically catalyzing the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine,
  as shown for another TET family member TET1.
