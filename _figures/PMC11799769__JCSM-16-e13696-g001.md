caption: 'Correlation network diagram between renal‐secreted proteins and proteins
  on the most significantly altered KEGG pathways in skeletal muscle. (A) The correlation
  networks of five renal‐secreted proteins and proteins with significant differences
  in the oxidative phosphorylation signalling pathway, thermogenesis pathway, ECM‐receptor
  interaction pathway, sulphur metabolism, citrate cycle (TCA cycle) and platelet
  activation pathway in skeletal muscle, respectively. (B) A summary of all pathways
  in Figure 4A. abs: absolute value; rho: correlation coefficient. The thickness of
  the line indicates the absolute value of the correlation coefficient. Relationships
  were classified as positive and negative'
