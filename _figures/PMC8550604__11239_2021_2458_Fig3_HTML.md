caption: FXa functions in TF-FVIIa initiated intravascular coagulation, hemostasis,
  and extravascular immune regulation. TF-FVIIa activated nascent product Xa initiates
  the intrinsic pathway by cleaving FVIII (green arrows), whereas FXa released from
  TF-FVIIa activates FV to directly form the prothrombinase in the common coagulation
  pathway (purple arrows). TFPI regulates FXa-dependent FV activation as well as controls
  TF-FVIIa in a FXa-dependent manner. FX activated on dendritic cells (DC) induces
  host defense-related interferon responses through PAR2 signaling in the context
  of toll-like receptor 4 activation and dependent on the endothelial protein C receptor
  (EPCR). FX can also by synthesized by macrophages and extravascular cell-autonomous
  FXa-PAR2 signaling regulates macrophage polarization involved in tumor immune evasion
  in tissue milieus
