caption: Mechanisms of contraction in ASM. Many regulatory mechanisms in ASM to control
  the contraction and relaxation are well recognized. The ectoenzyme CD38 could produce
  the second messenger cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), which causes Ca2+ release through
  ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The G-protein
  coupled receptor (GPCR)-based pathway activates phospholipase C (PLC) and breaks
  up phosphatidyl diphosphate inositol 2 (PIP2) into inositol trisphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG). Intracellular Ca2+ binds to intracellular calmodulin (CAM)
  to alter the phosphorylation status of myosin light chain (MLC) and regulates ASM
  function. Depletion of Ca2+ in SR calcium stores induces Ca2+ influx through store-operated
  Ca2+ channel (SOCC). There are other mechanisms that take part in regulating the
  intracellular ion concentration of ASM and finally affect the contraction and relaxation
  of them
