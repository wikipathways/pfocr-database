caption: Adrenal C19 steroid pathway. The synthesis of C19 steroids requires both
  HSD3B2 and CYB5A), whereas the synthesis of sulfated steroids occurs via SULT2A1,
  which competes with HSD3B2 for the same substrates. Segregation of HDS3B2 and CYB5A
  to separate zones (ZF and ZR, respectively), along with abundant SULT2A1 expression,
  as observed in young adrenals, favors the synthesis of DHEAS. Conversely, lower
  SULT2A1 expression and proximity of HSD3B2- and CYB5A-expressing cells, as observed
  in old adrenals, favor the synthesis of active androgens. CYP11A1, cytochrome P450
  cholesterol side-chain cleavage; CYP11B1, 11β-hydroxylase; CYP17A1, 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase;
  HSD11B2, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, type 2; StAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory
  protein.
