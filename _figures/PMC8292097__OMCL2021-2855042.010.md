caption: Proposed mechanistic scheme for anti-inflammatory effects of CO liberated
  from CORM-2 in PM-treated HASMC models. In HASMCs, PM can induce VCAM-1, ICAM-1,
  MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression through the TLR2 and TLR4/NADPH oxidase/ROS/NF-κB/IL-6
  pathway, thereby promoting monocyte adhesion and HASMC migration that are implicated
  in the development of inflammation. Importantly, CORM-2-liberated CO is able to
  prevent these inflammation-associated cellular events through the inhibition of
  the expression of relevant cell adhesion molecules and matrix metalloproteinases
  that is strictly regulated by a complex network of TLR2, TLR4, NADPH oxidase, ROS,
  NF-κB, and IL-6 signaling molecules.
