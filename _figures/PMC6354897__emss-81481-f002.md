caption: 'A review of the current understanding of chloroplastic phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP) synthesis associated with pyruvate formation and specific transporters that
  mediate the transport of intermediates through the plastid membrane. The primary
  products of photosynthesis, triose phosphates, are exported via the triose phosphate/phosphate
  translocator (TPT), or metabolized in chloroplasts. The PEP, can be imported via
  PEP/phosphate translocator (PPT), or synthetized by plastidic enolase (2) or, to
  a lesser extent, by the pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (4) enzyme. PEP in the
  chloroplasts can enter the shikimic acid pathway or, after pyruvate (Pyr) formation,
  enter the MEP pathway. There are several possible sources for Pyr inside the chloroplasts:
  1) export of cytosolic PEP through a PEP/phosphate translocator (PPT) [] and its
  conversion to pyruvate via glycolysis involving phosphoglycerate mutase (PGL) and
  enolase (ENO) []; 2) synthesis from PEP by pyruvate kinase (PK) []; 3) via NADP-dependent
  malate dehydrogenase within chloroplast [,]; or 4) import from the cytosol via plastid
  Na+-coupled pyruvate transporter (PyT) []. The malate can be transported across
  the plastid inner envelope membrane through the so-called malate valve (or malate
  shunt) facilitated by 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-malate transporter (OMT) or via plastidial
  dicarboxylate transporter (DCT), which acts as an antiporter exchanging malate against
  glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) [,,]. The product of starch and sucrose degradation,
  glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), is imported into the chloroplast by a hexose translocator
  (GPT). This specific metabolite is considered to be a positive allosteric effector
  of the PEP carboxylase enzyme (6). The figure shows a possible traffic of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate (ME-cDP) from plastid into cytosol and its transfer to the
  nucleus. In addition, pentose intermediates, D-xylulose and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose (DX),
  can be phosphorylated to and/or subsequently translocated into the MEP pathway from
  xylulose 5-phosphate (XPT) carrier. Metabolites: DXP, 1-Deoxy-D xylulose 5-phosphate;
  XU5P, xylulose 5-phosphate. Enzymes numbering: phosphoglycerate mutase (1); enolase
  (2); pyruvate kinase (3); pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (4); NADP-malate dehydrogenase
  (5); PEP carboxylase (6); xylulose kinase (7). The questions marks indicate steps
  for which the enzymes involved in isoprenoid metabolism or transport activities
  (red circles) remain to be elucidated.'
