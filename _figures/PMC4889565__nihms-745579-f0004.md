caption: Ingenuity Pathway analysis following 48 hour exposure to toxic concentration
  of Nevirapine indicates regulation of the antigen presentation pathway (FDR 0.1,
  p=0.01) predicting increase in the expression of both MHC class I and II (A). In
  contrast, Ritonavir was predicted to down-regulate expression of MHC class I while
  upregulating the expression of MHCII (B) suggesting differences in secondary immune
  cell involvement. An overlay of the Nevirapine data on a functional protein-protein
  interaction(C) network in the context of the global biological response reveal antigen
  processing and MHC I antigen presentation as one of the most central and most highly
  connected communities (C, inset)
