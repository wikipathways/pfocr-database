caption: 'Proposed mechanism of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation in BIA-ALCL via
  TLR4 pathway. LPS activation of BIA-ALCL cells occurs through an alternative TLR4
  pathway rather than T-cell receptor activation whereby the cells no longer require
  antigen presentation and processing by an APC. This complex is then able to directly
  activate T-cells, producing a downregulation of the immune response as a means to
  increase bacterial survival. LBP: LPS binding protein; MD2: myeloid differentiating
  protein 2; CD14: cluster of differentiation 14; TLR4: Toll-like receptor 4; TRIF:
  TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon beta; TRAM: TRIF-related adaptor
  molecule; TIRAP: Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein;
  MyD88: myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88; NF-κB: nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; MHCII: major histocompatibility
  complex 2; APC: antigen presentation cell; TCR: T-cell receptor. Figure created
