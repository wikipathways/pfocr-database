caption: In Co-CA II, CO2 binding and the catalytic conversion of CO2 to HCO3− occur
  in the same way as in the Zn-CA II with tetrahedral geometry. However, the HCO3−
  displacement and proton transfer process are significantly altered due to the coordination
  expansion to octahedral geometry during catalysis. This octahedral coordination
  allows bidentate binding mode of HCO3− and reorganization of negative charge of
  HCO3− toward Co2+ ion, allowing stronger HCO3− binding to metal ion. To dissociate
  the product, proton transfer first occurs via an altered pathway (possibly, WCo,octa
  → W2 → His64) and WCo,octa is converted into the hydroxyl ion. This negatively charged
  hydroxyl ion then pushes away the bound product, and the tetrahedral coordination
  is restored for the next catalytic cycle.
