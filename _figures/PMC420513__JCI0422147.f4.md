caption: Immune synapse_related signaling pathway and autoimmune diseases. A possible
  role for genetic mutations involved in several autoimmune diseases is highlighted,
  including ZAP-70 (RA); SLC9A3R1 and NAT9 (psoriasis); PDCD1 (systemic lupus erythematosus
  [SLE]); and SLC22A4 (RA and Crohn disease). T lymphocytes contain both surface receptors
  and intracellular signaling components that become activated when the TCR is engaged
  by interactions with an appropriate APC in which antigen is presented in the context
  of MHC molecules. The APC is displayed in the upper portion of this schematic view.
  The TCR mediates signaling in conjunction with molecules located in the plasma membrane,
  including CD3 and ζ-chains, which contribute to the formation of an immunological
  synapse and a lipid raft, leading to activation of proximal, intermediate, and distal
  signaling components. Several but not all components are portrayed in this figure.
  Ultimately, transcription factors become activated and bind to respective promoter
  regions to either enhance or suppress target gene expression. Potential mechanisms
  linking the genetic findings to functional components of the immunological synapse
  are shown by solid bold lines.
