caption: Platelet activation, aggregation and fibrin formation. Platelet activation,
  aggregation and fibrin production, occur via complex intracellular signaling processes
  and are regulated by cellular receptors. Platelets adhere to and then are activated
  by collagen, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and other adhesive proteins. These interactions
  are triggered when adhesive proteins interact with platelet glycoprotein (GP) receptors,
  several of which are members of the integrin family. Key GP receptors are displayed
  above. Platelet activation is reinforced with the release of contents, which includes
  ADP and other mediators. Thrombin can be generated locally or on the activated-platelet
  surface. Thrombin then cleaves to the protease-activating receptors (PAR) to expose
  a tethered ligand that serves to self-bind to PAR, triggering a confirmation that
  allow interactions with G proteins. PAR-1 couples to Gq protein to stimulate platelet
  activation. Additional, Gi-coupled pathways attenuate adenylyl cyclase activity,
  thereby lowering intracellular levels of the platelet inhibitor cAMP. PAR also couples
  to Gq proteins to stimulate platelet activation. The major platelet receptor GPIIb/IIIa
  (integrin αIIbβ3), mediates the final common pathway of platelet activation by undergoing
  a conformational change that enables the binding of multivalent ligands, such as
  fibrinogen and vWF, which cross-link adjacent platelets into aggregates.
