caption: The workflow of HCSD design. (a) Appling the selection criteria, first all
  the cancer secretome data were collected and processed from literatures. (b) Then,
  I all the complementary annotation and cross references were obtainedfrom UniProt,
  Ensembl, bioDBnet and Entrez using thethe reported protein or gene IDs in the data
  tables. (c) Next, the secretory pathway features including signal peptide, transmembrane
  domains and nonclassic secretory proteins were predicted using CBS prediction servers
  (). The secondary structures and PTMs information were retrieved from UniProt ().
  (d) Based on the proteomics strategy used, the secretome data were divided into
  label-free and label-based studies. (e) The structured data tables used as input
  to MySQL to generate searchable data tables by end user (http://www.mysql.com/).
  (f) For the web server lighttpd is used to query the database (http://www.lighttpd.net/)
  and the web application and the interface were implemented using web.py (www.webpy.org),
  Javascript (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), jQuery (http://jquery.com/)
  and D3 (http://d3js.org/).
