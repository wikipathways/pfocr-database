caption: The metabolism pathway for biodegrading cyanobacterial hepatotoxins by Sphingopyxis
  sp. USTB-05. In this purposed metabolism pathway, MC-LR, MC-YR, MC-RR and [D-Asp1]NOD
  are enzymatically hydrolyzed by glutamate protease USTB-05-A to produce linearized
  MC-LR, MC-YR, MC-RR and [D-Asp1]NOD, which are further biodegraded by USTB-05-B
  or USTB-05-C to tetrapeptide or Adda. Tetrapeptide is disassimilated to Adda by
  tetrapeptidease. After, Adda is biodegraded into PA, which is further biodegraded
  by the unannotated enzymes to PA-CoA. Then PA-CoA is biodegraded to acetyl-CoA by
  the corresponding Phenylacetic-CoAase; 2-(1,2-Epoxy-1,2-dihydrophenyl) acetyl-CoAase;
  2-Oxepin-2(3H)-ylideneacetyl-CoAase; 3-Oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA semialdehydease
  and 3-Oxo-5,6-didehydrosuberoyl-CoAase. Ultimately, acetyl-CoA is completely converted
  to CO2 via the TCA cycle. The dashed line indexes the sites of bond-breakage. The
  red boxes represent that these genes are found in Sphingopyxis sp. USTB-05 genome.
  The purple or white boxes represent that these genes are not noted in Sphingopyxis
  sp. USTB-05 genome.
