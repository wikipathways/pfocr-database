caption: Ligation of HLA molecules by low titers of anti-HLA antibodies activates
  Rho and Rho kinase and stimulates phosphorylation of Src and focal adhesion kinase
  (FAK) followed by downstream activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex
  2 (mTORC2) pathway culminating in increased expression of cell survival proteins.
  The binding of anti-Gal antibodies to the endothelium of the graft induces expression
  of the cytoprotective proteins A20, HO and nitric oxide and the survival proteins
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Anti-Gal antibodies also promote graft survival by upregulating
  expression of heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and the complement regulatory
  proteins decay accelerating actor (DAF), complement receptor-related protein (Crry)
  and CD59 in the graft endothelium.
