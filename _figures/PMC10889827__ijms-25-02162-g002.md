  PDGFRβ, a kind of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), plays a crucial role in the PDGF
  signaling in the periosteum. There is mutual interaction between PDGF/PDGFRβ and
  PI3K/AKT signaling (yellow pathway), which is essential for activating PDCs following
  fracture. On the one hand, after PGDF combines to RTK (PDGFRβ), PI3K directly binds
  to phosphorylated (P) PDGFRβ via the regulatory domain (p85), and is therefore targeted
  to the inner cell membrane. Binding of p85 subunit of PI3K to the phosphorylated
  RTK leads to conformational changes in the catalytic domain of PI3K (p110) and consequently
  promotes the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3. PIP3 contributes to AKT phosphorylation
  and activation. The transcription factor CREB is directly phosphorylated by activated
  AKT, p-CREB then transports into the nucleus and regulates target gene transcription.
  On the other hand, upregulation of PI3K sensitizes PDCs to the effects of PDGF and
  enhances phosphorylation of PDGFRβ. Through this synergy, the PDGFRβ-PI3K signaling
  axis exerts its anti-apoptosis, pro-cell proliferation and recruitment effects.
  The binding of PDGF to its receptor, PDGFRβ, stimulates both the PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2
  pathways in PDCs. Notably, it blocks the canonical BMP-2/Smad pathway (blue pathway),
  inhibiting periosteal osteogenesis. PDGF: platelet derived growth factor; PDGFRβ:
  PDGF receptor β; PI3K: phosphoinositol-3-kinase; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate;
  PIP3: phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate; CREB: cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) response element-binding protein. ERK1/2: extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases 1/2; P: phosphorylation'
