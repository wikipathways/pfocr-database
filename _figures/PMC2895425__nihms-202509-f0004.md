caption: Endocytosis involves the capture of transmembrane proteins and their extracellular
  ligands into cytoplasmic vesicles that are pinched off from the plasma membrane
  (see the figure). The best-studied pathway of receptor internalization is mediated
  by clathrin-coated pits. These are small areas of the plasma membrane that are covered
  from the cytoplasmic surface with clathrin triskelions, which consist of three clathrin
  heavy chains and three clathrin light chains assembled into the polyhedral clathrin
  lattice. Receptors are recruited to clathrin-coated pits by directly interacting
  with the clathrin coat adaptor complex AP2 or by binding to other adaptor proteins,
  which in turn interacts with the clathrin heavy chain and/or AP2. Clathrin-coated
  pits invaginate inwards with the help of several accessory proteins and pinch off
  to form a clathrin-coated vesicle in a process that requires the GTPase dynamin.
  Several clathrin-independent pathways of endocytosis also exist, although the precise
  mechanisms and structural components involved in these pathways are not well understood.Endocytic
  vesicles derived from both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytosis
  fuse with early endosomes. Endosomal trafficking is controlled by several Rab proteins
  — small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily. Each GTP-bound Rab protein
  resides in a particular type of endosome and functions by recruiting specific effector
  proteins. Following their internalization into early RAB5-containing endosomes,
  receptors can rapidly recycle back to the plasma membrane by a RAB4-dependent mechanism,
  traffic to the recycling compartment that contains RAB11A or remain in endosomes,
  which mature into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and late endosomes. MVBs are defined
  by the presence of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are formed in a process of
  inward membrane invagination involving ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required
  for transport) complexes. Early-to-late endosome maturation involves the acquisition
  of RAB7 and the removal of endosomal components that are capable of, and necessary
  for, recycling. In the MVBs, cargo destined for degradation is incorporated into
  ILVs. Fusion of late endosomes and MVBs with lysosomes carrying proteolytic enzymes
  results in cargo degradation.
