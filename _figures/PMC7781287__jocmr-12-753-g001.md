caption: Pathways of adrenergic-mediated oncogenesis within pancreatic ductal cells.
  Activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) leads to α-subunit binding with
  guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and release. Activated Gα can promote adenylate cyclase
  (AC) activity, which produces cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Protein kinase
  A (PKA) is then activated by cAMP, which in turn stimulates generation of multiple
  transcription factors (NF-kB, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and activator
  protein 1 (AP-1)). Additionally, β2AR may be phosphorylated by PKA to serve as scaffolding
  for β-arrestin and to initiate a second messenger cascade culminating in p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and CCAAT
  enhancer binding protein (C/EBPα). Similarly, an epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR)-mediated pathway can be promoted through cAMP and PKA activity downstream
  of β2AR. These signaling cascades lead to transcription of proliferation and angiogenesis
  promoters (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF)).
