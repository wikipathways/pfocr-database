caption: 'Thrombosis and bleeding pathways in patients with ventricular assist device.
  Under physiologic shear stress, vWF undergoes a conformational elongation from a
  globular state to an extended chain conformation with exposure of binding sites
  for the platelet glycoprotein complex GpIb/IX/V and various subendothelial constituents.
  This interaction causes platelet activation, secretion of ADP, activation of the
  GpIIb-IIIa receptor and platelet aggregation (central box and box on the top left).
  However, the same conformation elongation exposes the disulfide bonds of vWF multimers
  and allows the inactivation process by the vWF protease ADAMTS-13 (box on the top
  right). Placement of VADs may amplify these processes, increasing shear stress and
  promoting activated contact proteins release. Therefore, the increased activation
  of vWF may explain the dual pathway activation: increased thrombosis by platelets
  activation and contact proteins system (pathway on the left) and bleeding diathesis
  throughout ADAMTS-13 activation and acquired vWF disease (pathway on the right).'
