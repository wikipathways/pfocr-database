caption: Applications of metal-based nanomaterials in tumor immunotherapy. Various
  metal-based nanomaterials activate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to regulate
  the tumor immune microenvironment and induce tumor cell death. They also enhance
  immune activation and therapeutic efficacy through mechanisms such as oxidative
  stress, DNA damage, and boosting immune cell activity. These nanomaterials can be
  combined with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and other therapeutic modalities for synergistic
  cancer treatment
