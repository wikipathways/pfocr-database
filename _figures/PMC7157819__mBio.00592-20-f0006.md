caption: Summary of β-lactamases and their predicted genetic and molecular properties
  in Bpc and Bcc bacteria. Burkholderia species produce at least three active β-lactamases,
  two class A enzymes (PenA and PenB), and one class C enzyme (AmpC). PenA and PenB
  are lipoproteins that are (i) synthesized as pre-pro (pp)-proteins, (ii) exported
  across the inner membrane (IM) to the periplasm (PP) by the twin arginine transport
  (TAT) system, (iii) lipidated and processed by signal peptidase II, and (iv) likely
  sorted to the OM by the localization of lipoproteins (LOL) system. AmpC is synthesized
  as a pre (p)-protein, which, after export via the general secretion pathway (Sec),
  is processed by signal peptidase I and which then resides in the periplasm as a
  soluble protein. Bpc bacteria possess only PenA. Bcc bacteria possess both PenA*
  and PenB. Although all Bcc PenA* proteins analyzed possess the TAT secretion and
  lipidation export and membrane localization signals, the proteins are not functional
  β-lactamases because they lack two of the four Ambler motifs, including the active-site
  serine. In Bcc bacteria, the active class A serine β-lactamase is PenB. Some β-lactams
  are also cleaved by AmpC, which is present in all Bcc bacteria. It is present in
  a few Bpc bacteria but is absent from its major representatives, including B. pseudomallei,
  B. mallei, and B. thailandensis. Unlike PenB and AmpC, which are induced in Bcc
  bacteria after challenge with some β-lactams, PenA* and PenA expression is not inducible
  in Bcc and Bpc bacteria, respectively. In B. pseudomallei, it has been shown that
  penA is transcribed at low levels from the promoter of the upstream nlpD1 gene and
  that the ensuing transcript levels are sufficient for resistance to penicillin antibiotics.
  Extended-spectrum β-lactam resistance, e.g., CAZr, requires PenA overexpression
  or amino acid changes as the result of acquired regulatory and structural mutations.
  The PenA secretion pathway and membrane (likely OM) localization have been experimentally
  confirmed in B. pseudomallei and predicted with the SignalP (version 5.0) server
  (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) and the TatP (version 1.0) server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TatP/)
  for all proteins in Bcc bacteria.
