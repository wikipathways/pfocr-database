caption: 'Fungal sphingolipids biosynthetic pathway. The proteins kinases Pkh1/2,
  Ypk1/2 and Orm1/2 shown in blue circles are part of the regulatory module that controls
  the de novo sphingolipids synthesis, which is highlighted by a dashed blue line.
  The sphingolipids hydrolytic pathway is highlighted by a dashed red line. Sphingolipids
  species are shown in orange boxes. The purple boxes represent molecules found in
  animals. Enzymatic steps are numbered as follows: (1) Serine palmitoyltransferase
  (SPT) codified by the genes LCB1 and LCB2; (2) 3-ketosphinganine reductase codified
  by the TSC10 gene; (3) Dihydrosphingosine C4-hydroxylase codified by the SUR2 gene;
  (4) Ceramide synthase codified by the genes LAG1, LAC1 and LIP1; (5) Dihydro-ceramidase
  codified by the YDC1 gene; (6) Phyto-ceramidase codified by the YPC1 gene; (7) Sphingoid
  base kinases codified by the genes LCB4 and LCB5; (8) Sphingoid base phosphate phosphatases
  codified by the genes LCB3/YSR2 and YSR3; (9) Long-chain base phosphate lyase codified
  by the DPL1 gene; (10) IPC synthase codified by the AUR1/IPC1 gene; (11) Inositol
  phosphosphingolipid phospholipase codified by the ISC1 gene; (12) MIPC synthases
  codified by the genes SUR1, CSG2 and CSH1; (13) Inositolphosphotransferase codified
