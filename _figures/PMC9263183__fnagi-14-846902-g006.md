caption: Interaction networks of top 30 KEGG pathways according to text-mining. Nodes
  represent pathways. Node color indicates AD word score denoting average number of
  AD-related terms per paper, for each pathway. Edges reflect a significant association
  between two pathways. Edge thicknesses reflect the strength of association. (A)
  Gene overlap between pathways. Edges represent significant enrichment between pairs
  of pathways (FDR < 0.05). Node number indicates ranking in the literature. Edge
  thicknesses reflect significance (–log p-value) of enrichment. (B) Co-expression
  of pathways. Edges represent canonical correlations as defined by a pathway correlation
  analysis (PCxN) (). Edge thickness values represent the absolute value of correlation
  between the two pathways. The figure was generated using the igraph package. The
  nodes were placed in the two-dimensional coordinates using a forced layout algorithm
  for the gene overlap network. The co-expression network was aligned to the same
  layout as the gene overlap network.

  description: Interaction networks of top 30 KEGG pathways according to text-mining.
    Nodes represent pathways. Node color indicates AD word score denoting average
    number of AD-related terms per paper, for each pathway. Edges reflect a significant
    association between two pathways. Edge thicknesses reflect the strength of association.
    (A) Gene overlap between pathways. Edges represent significant enrichment between
    pairs of pathways (FDR < 0.05). Node number indicates ranking in the literature.
    Edge thicknesses reflect significance (–log p-value) of enrichment. (B) Co-expression
