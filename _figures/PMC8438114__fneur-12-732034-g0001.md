caption: Brain targets involved in the mechanism of pain chronicity. Cortical targets
  of NIBS studies were primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (S1),
  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and occipital field (OCF). Imaging studies
  have identified thalamus, hippocampus (Hipp), amygdala (AMY), and nucleus accumbens
  (NAc) as key subcortical regions implicated in pain chronicity. Anterior cingulate
  cortex (ACC) has been identified as an important relay in the medial pain pathway
  integrating sensory, attentional, and motivational components of pain that can also
  been targeted via cortical stimulation due to its interconnections with these targets.
  In tonic, acute pain stage, motor cortex, as well as somatosensory regions may undergo
  rapid changes as response to peripheral insult, and the magnitude of this response
  might be shaped by pre-existing individual differences within these regions. As
  demonstrated in NIBS studies, DLPFC regulates top-down inhibition of pain independently
  of motor cortex activation, possibly modulating sensory component in an early stage
  of pain development. As pain develops to the chronic stage, cognitive aspects of
  pain become more important mechanism and prefrontal regions may regulate the affective
  component of pain via their influence on cingulate and limbic circuits.
