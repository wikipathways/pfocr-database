caption: 'Silk + bLf NPs induced apoptosis in EGFR +ve and EGFR −ve cells.Notes: Internalization
  of both forms of nanoformulation was facilitated via LRP1 receptors and EGFR in
  MDA-MB-231 cells and via death receptors in MCF-7 cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, downregulation
  of anti-apoptotic genes and upregulation of apoptotic genes activated the intrinsic/mitochondrial
  pathway of apoptosis. In MCF-7 cells, apoptosis was mediated through upregulation
  of death receptors (Fas and Fas-L), caspase-8, and caspase-3 and -7, along with
  the upregulation in BAX. Black arrows in the figure show the upregulation and downregulation
  in gene expression. “Hybrid” denotes the formation of lyso-endosome (lysosome +
  endosome). Protein from NPs was released slowly inside the cells, and the unwanted
  materials, including NPs and receptors, were expunged by the cells via exocytosis.
  Red arrows are the signalling mechanism while black arrows are the effect of bLf
  on individual proteins/markers denoting upregulation or downregulation.Abbreviations:
