caption: The angiotensin receptor (AT1R) is coupled to the GTP-binding protein Gq.
  One major downstream pathway involves protein kinase C- δ (PKC δ) Rho-GEF (guanine
  exchange factor) and RhoA, resulting in the activation of ROCK (Rho-kinase). ROCK
  can promote inflammation by inducing the expression of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1 (MCP-1) and can also stimulate cell hypertrophy and migration by activating
  JNK (c-jun N-terminal kinase). In addition, ROCK promotes the contraction of vascular
  smooth muscle cells via a kinase cascade that activates myosin light-chain (MLC)
  which may contribute to hypertension and vascular pathology. Activation of the AT1AR
  can also induce free radical (superoxide and peroxynitrite) production by stimulating
  membrane-associated NADPH oxidase. The resulting ROS can cause oxidative damage
  to DNA, proteins and lipids and can also activate the transcription factor NF-κB
  which induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation of AT1R coupled
  to Gα q11 causes membrane inositol phospholipid (PIP2) hydrolysis, generating inositol
  trisphosphate (IP3) which triggers Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum stores.
  This Ca2+ release then activates matrix metalloproteases such as ADAM17 that cleaves
  heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the cell surface releasing EGF
  which binds and then activates EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity (TK). Receptors
  for the EGF receptor, and the insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors,
  are coupled to intracellular adaptor proteins (Shc, Grb2 and Sos in the case of
  the EGF receptor, and IRS1 in the case of the insulin/IGF receptor) that activate
  the monomeric G protein Ras. Activation of these growth factor receptors can also
  lead to activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) which in turn can activate
  Akt kinase. Downstream targets of Akt that may mediate effects of AT1AR on cellular
  aging include forkhead transcription factors (FHTF) and the mammalian target of
  rapamycin (mTOR). Figure prepared by KC Alexander.
