caption: Paks control critical cellular events required for angiogenesis, including
  endothelial cell proliferation, survival, attachment and migration. In endothelial
  cells, the phosphorylation of BAD and RAF1 by Pak protects against apoptotic stimuli
  by promoting RAF1 translocation to mitochondria and the displacement of BAD/BCL2
  complexes. As seen in other cellular contexts, in endothelial cells, the Erk pathway
  regulates cellular proliferation and migration when initiated by activation of Rac/Pak
  pathway. The control of vascular permeability by Pak is mediated by modulation of
  cellular contractility and cell:cell adhesion molecules. In one model, direct phosphorylation
  of myosin light chain (MLC) by Pak leads to increased contractility and increased
  endothelial permeability, as has been seen in certain experimental settings. Pak
  has also been proposed to disrupt endothelial cell:cell junctions by direct phosphorylation
  and subsequent internalization and degradation of VE cadherin. In another model,
  activated Pak phosphorylates and inhibits GEF-H1 (also known as ARHGEF2), leading
  to diminished RHOA/RHO-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK)/MLC
  activity, decreased contractility and decreased endothelial permeability, This model
  is consistent with data showing that Pak protects against an increase in permeability
  in a hypoxia induced pulmonary hypertension model and in a Pak2a knockout zebrafish
  model (dotted lines).
