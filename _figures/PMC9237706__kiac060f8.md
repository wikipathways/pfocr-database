caption: Model of the COP1–RGL2 regulatory module in seed germination. Upon perception
  of favorable environmental cues, GA is synthesized in the seeds to induce germination.
  COP1 is stabilized by GA and interacts with RGL2, a negative regulator of germination-associated
  genes such as GASA6, EXPA genes, and XTH. The COP1–RGL2 interaction destabilizes
  RGL2, and consequently germination-associated genes are induced in the imbibed seeds.
  SPA1 is required for the in vivo interaction. Our model defines a noncanonical pathway
  by which GA inhibits RGL2 repression of seed germination through the activity of
  COP1. Arrows signify positive effects; blocked line, negative effect; dashed line,
  indirect regulation.
