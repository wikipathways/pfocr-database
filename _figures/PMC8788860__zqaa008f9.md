caption: Some Possible Neural Circuit Mechanisms Contributing to the Execution of
  the Whisker Detection Task. (A) In the detection task, S2p neurons compared to M1p
  neurons respond more strongly to whisker stimulation and show enhanced correlated
  spontaneous activity. This could result from strong common synaptic input to S2p
  neurons and/or from strong reciprocal local excitatory synaptic connectivity between
  S2p neurons. (B) Whisker deflection evokes action potential firing in the primary
  sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglion (Tg). The Tg neurons release glutamate
  on postsynaptic neurons in various trigeminal brainstem nuclei. The lemniscal pathway
  originates in the principal trigeminal nucleus (Pr5), which excites neurons in the
  ventral posterior medial (VPM) primary whisker somatosensory thalamic nucleus through
  glutamatergic synapses. The paralemniscal pathway originates from glutamatergic
  neurons in the spinal trigeminal interpolaris nucleus (Sp5i) of the brainstem which
  innervates an anterior first-order division of the posterior medial thalamus (POm).
  Glutamatergic projection neurons in VPM and POm in turn predominantly innervate
  wS1 and wS2 respectively. Reciprocal excitatory interactions through glutamatergic
  synapses between wS1 and wS2 may be a critical early step in whisker sensory perception
  and decision-making (,). Interactions of wS1 and wS2 with higher-order POm may also
  be important. (C) Neuronal activity in various brain areas likely contributes to
  converting the whisker sensory signal into the licking motor response. In addition
  to wS1 and wS2, further important nodes have been suggested to include additional
  cortical regions such as motor cortex (tjM1, tjM2/ALM), medial prefrontal cortex
  (mPFC) and the dorsal CA1 region of hippocampus (dCA1), as well as subcortical structures
  such as thalamus, basal ganglia and brainstem. Further research is likely to reveal
  additional participating brain areas (indicated by “+…”).
