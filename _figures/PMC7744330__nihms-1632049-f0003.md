caption: Age dependent bone mineralization pathways in Enpp1 deficiency show a temporal
  shift of Enpp1 catalytic and non-catalytic activity on gene co-expression networks.
  Red nodes correlate with Enpp1 transcription, yellow nodes correlate with Plasma
  PPi measurements, and blue nodes correlate with both. Increasing node size represents
  increasing significance of differential gene expression, where −log10(p-value) was
  used to calculate the node’s size. (A) At 10wks, non-catalytic Enpp1 signaling triggers
  a network containing Fgf23, Opn, Dmp1, and other elements regulating bone formation.
  Plasma PPi appears less determinative at this stage of development with the exception
  of Parathyroid hormone and Nfatc2, both of which regulate bone resorption. (B) Co-expression
  data at 23wks demonstrates the importance of PPi on disease progression with time.
  At 23 weeks, all the major pathways regulating bone mineralization including the
  Wnt pathway and matrisomal genes now correlate with plasma PPi. Enpp1 transcription
  remains correlated to Fgf23 transcription, but intact plasma Fgf23 levels also correlate
  with plasma PPi at 23 weeks. (For interpretation of the references to color in this
