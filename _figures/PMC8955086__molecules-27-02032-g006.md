caption: 'Sarsasapogenin mechanism of action in inflammasome activation and AGE. NLRP3
  is triggered by a wide variety of stimuli, including LPS via Toll-like receptors
  (TLR), which results in the manufacture of the cytokine precursor via NF-kB and
  other inflammasome constituents, including NLRP3. Sarsasapogenin inhibits the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the AGE pathway, vastly improving diabetic nephropathy
  in rats. Abbreviations: N-GSDMD, N-terminal Gasdermin-D; GSDMD, Gasdermin-D; NLRP3,
  NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; NLRC4, NLR Family CARD Domain Containing 4;
  AGE, Advanced glycation end products; PKC, Protein kinase C.'
