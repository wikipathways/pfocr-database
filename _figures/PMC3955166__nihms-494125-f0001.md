caption: A diverse array of cellular processes is disturbed by the presence of mHTT.
  Here we depict a neuron and demonstrate the major sites of molecular disruption
  caused by the presence of mHTT. Roman numerals indicate which zoomed-in views (surrounding
  boxes) correspond to particular areas/processes in the cell. We provide a simplified
  over-view of the pathogenic pathways in HD discussed in our review, specifically,
  (i) transcriptional dysregulation of basal and inducible gene expression, (ii) impaired
  protein degradation, (iii) altered protein folding, (iv) disrupted synaptic signalling,
  and (v) perturbed energy metabolism through altered mitochondrial maintenance and
  localization. Pathway dysfunction can arise from direct or indirect interference
  of key components by soluble, oligomeric and/or aggregated mHTT. While we represent
  each pathway as an insular process, in reality, disruptions in one pathway likely
  influence HD pathogenesis (at least in part) by exacerbating dysfunction of other
  key events.
