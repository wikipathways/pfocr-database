caption: Schematics describing the role of particular small-molecule protein kinases
  and their inhibitors in PAH microenvironment, including such molecular hallmarks
  as inflammation, apoptosis, proliferation, or mitochondrial function. Many of these
  compounds have multidirectional effects. The molecular background involves anti-inflammatory
  activity by influencing TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-10 factors. (a) Molecules that reduce the
  expression of tyrosine kinase receptors with their main target defined as EGF, FGF,
  or VEGF receptors, inhibiting the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and, consequently,
  the process of lung fibrosis. (b) Rho A kinase inhibitors normalize PAH-related
  hemodynamic and hypertrophic lesions in the heart and the process of proliferation
  in the pulmonary arteries. They can beneficially activate anti-inflammatory cytokines,
  but decrease vasoconstrictors—endothelin ET-1, pro-inflammatory interleukin IL-17—and
  reduce oxidative stress. Additionally, fasudil dichloroacetate is responsible for
  the reduced influx of fibroblasts and inhibition of the process leading to mitochondrial
  dysfunction. Sirolimus, an inhibitor of the FKBP12/mTOR complex, intensifies the
  process of proliferation and migration of fibroblasts and yet inhibits the ongoing
  hypertrophic changes in the heart. Inhibition of pulmonary fibrosis is also a primary
  mechanism for inhibitors of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (ruxolitinib). The molecule
  exerts anti-inflammatory activity (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10), with slight effect on the
  PASMC remodeling. The compound IN-1233, an ALK kinase inhibitor, is distinguished
  by its inhibitory effect on the production of pro-inflammatory factors (TGF-β1,
  PAI-1). Molecules that block BCR-ABL kinase inhibit PDGF-induced proliferation and
  migration within smooth muscle cells of vascular walls and reduce collagen deposition
  in vascular walls. However, imatinib might intensify the inflammatory process (↑INF-γ,
  TNF-α). Similarly, dasatinib increases the formation of free radicals and does not
  inhibit hemodynamic and hypertrophic changes in the heart. (c) Seralutinib, which
  targets PDGF/c-KIT/BMP receptor type 2 (BMPR2) signaling, reduces smooth muscle
  proliferation and fibroblast migration and inhibits the process of narrowing the
  walls of pulmonary vessels. The molecular background involves anti-inflammatory
  activity by influencing TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-10 factors. Plus in a circle—positive effect
  of candidate drugs on the normalization of PAH-related lesions; minus in a circle—negative
  effect of candidate drugs that manifest the worsening of PAH-related lesions; sharp
