caption: A simple overview of the Hippo signaling pathway and YAP. The core components
  of the Hippo signaling pathway are Mst1/2, LATs1/2, YAP/TAZ, and target genes, which
  are closely connected, especially YAP. The retention method for YAP is in the nucleus
  and cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, YAP/TAZ can blind to some specific proteins (such
  as the 14-3-3 protein) through direct LATs1/2 phosphorylation and indirect Mst1/2
  activation. At the same time, SAV1 and MOB1 are defined as regulatory proteins of
  Mst1/2 and LATs1/2, respectively. Besides, PP2A can inhibit the Mst1/2–SAV1 complex,
  while both NF2 and AMOT can regulate the LATs1/2–MOB1 complex. In the nucleus transferred
  from the cytoplasm, YAP can express a series of target genes through interacting
  with transcription factors, like TEAD family, Smad, p73, ErbB4, Runx1/2, Pax, and
  TBX5. Finally, when suffering from certain physiological and pathological damage,
  YAP will degrade.
