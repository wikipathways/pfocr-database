caption: Representative signalling pathway of human TLRs in the cell membrane (TLR1/2,
  TLR2/6, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR10) and endosome (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9). TLRs signal
  through two major adaptors, MyD88 and TRIF, which bind directly or indirectly to
  TLRs through TIR-domain interactions. MyD88 and Mal promote the recruitment of TRAF6
  (ubiquitin ligase) and several kinase complexes, such as IRAKs, TAB/TAK, IKKαβ,
  MAKKs, and/or PI3K/Akt. Subsequent phosphorylation and ubiquitination promote the
  translocation of the transcription factors CREB, AP-1, and NF-κB, which can induce
  transcription of certain messenger RNAs, such as TNFs, pro-IL-1β, and other inflammatory
  molecules. By contrast, TRIF interacts with TRAF3 and TBK1/IKKε in endosomal TLR4
  signalling, and with TRAF3 in TLR3 signaling, followed by IRF3 activation. In TLR7
  and TLR9 signaling, TRIF interacts with IRAKs and TRAF3, followed by IRF7 activation.
  Activated and phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7 in the cytoplasm are translocated into
  the nucleus, which induces subsequent induction of type I IFNs , , . See  for list
  of abbreviations.
