caption: 'The structures and processes involved in fibrosis. (A) Structure of the
  nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) protein. The NRF2-epichlorohydrin (ECH)
  homology (Neh) 1 domain contains a base sequence of cap-n-collar type basic leucine
  zipper DNA, which assists in the nuclear transfer of NRF2. The Neh2 domain contains
  two motifs that bind to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1): ETGE motifs
  with high affinity and DLG motifs with low affinity. (B) The structure of the KEAP1
  protein. KEAP1 is a homodimer. (C) It contains a Kelch repeat region that combines
  two motifs (ETGE and DLG) with different affinities to form a hinge–latch structure.
  The ETGE motif has high affinity and is considered a “hinge”. The DLG motif has
  a low affinity and can be regarded as a “latch”. (D) The KEAP1/NRF2 signaling pathway.
  Under normal conditions, NRF2 binds to KEAP1 to form an ɑ-helical conformation containing
  seven lysine residues and then acts as a target for the ubiquitination and cleavage
  of NRF2. After the ubiquitination of NRF2 by Cullin3 (Cul3), it is degraded and
  free KEAP1 is involved in the next round of NRF2 binding and ubiquitination. When
  the oxidation equilibrium is disrupted, the binding of NRF2 and KEAP1 is also affected.
  The “lock” structure, namely the binding between the DLG motif and the Kelch repeat
  domain, is destroyed. Therefore, NRF2 ubiquitination is blocked and NRF2 degradation
  is insufficient. As NRF2 continues to accumulate, free NRF2 is translocated to the
  nucleus. It can bind with antioxidant response elements to induce the expression
  of target genes, thus activating the body’s antioxidant defense and anti-inflammatory
  systems.'
