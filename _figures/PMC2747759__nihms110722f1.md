caption: 'Death receptor 5 is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. When the TRAIL
  (or TRA-8) binds to receptor, the receptor forms a homotrimer, which subsequently
  induces the death-inducing signaling complex formation. DISC includes FADD, caspase
  8 and cIAP or FLIP. Apoptosis is induced by the activation of caspase 8/caspase
  3 as well as activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.FADD: Fas-associated
  death domain protein; TRAIL: TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.'
