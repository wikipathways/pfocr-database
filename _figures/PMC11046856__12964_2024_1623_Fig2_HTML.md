caption: Non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. The non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway is
  involved in cell polarity and microtubule reorganization. Binding of the Wnt ligand
  to the FZD receptor activates the Wnt/PCP pathway either by recruiting the LRP5/6
  or tyrosine kinase Ror2 receptor. This activates the GTPase RAC1 which activates
  the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) which leads to activation of the JUN transcription
  factor for expression of genes involved in cell fate and polarity. The Wnt/Ca2+ activates
  phospholipase C (PLC) following binding of the Wnt ligand on the FZD/LRP5/6 receptor
  complex. Activation of PLC leads to the activation of inositol triphosphate (PIP3),
  which increases calcium (Ca2+) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Increased Ca2+ leads
  to binding interaction with calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and activation
  of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor for its nuclear
  translocation and transcriptional activation of target genes that are involved in
  the pro-inflammatory response
