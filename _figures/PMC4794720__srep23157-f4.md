caption: (a) Ethanol titers in 24 h from glucose at 30 °C (open bars) and 39 °C (filled
  bars). (b) Galactose fermentation pathway that partially overlaps with the trehalose
  synthesis pathway. The graphs represent the relative transcriptional levels of the
  reconstructed CDC25 mutants compared to that of MT8-1 at 30 °C. Dashed lines indicate
  the transcriptional levels of MT8-1. (c) Ethanol titers in 24 h from galactose at
  30 °C (open bars) and 39 °C (filled bars).
