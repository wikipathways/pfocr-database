caption: The inferred mechanism of ginkgolide A in AD pathology. The drug acts through
  the inhibition of NMDA receptor, JNK signaling and the activation of PI3K-AKT pathway.
  Inhibition of NMDA receptor prevents excessive amounts of glutamate that are associated
  with synaptic dysfunction and tau phosphorylation. Inhibition of JNK pathway decreases
  the production of proinflammatory cytokines involved in neuroinflammation. Activation
  of PI3K-AKT pathway strengthens the inhibition of GSK3β and further prevents the
  hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. The solid dash lines show the interactions
  of protein kinases and signaling cascades. The long-dashed lines show the pharmacological
  action of the drug.
