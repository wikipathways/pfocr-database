caption: The regulation of mTOR on Treg cell differentiation. Treg cell differentiation
  is negatively regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibit Treg cell
  differentiation through inhibiting phosphorylation of smad3 or inhibiting H3K4 methylation
  near the Foxp3 TSS. Meanwhile, mTORC1 inhibits Treg cell differentiation by increasing
  glycolytic activity, but mTORC2 inhibits Treg cell differentiation through the ATK-FoxO1/3a
  pathway.
