caption: 'Effects of burn injury and CLP on the gene expression pattern and metabolic
  fluxes in the rat liver. A and B: Comparison between the Burn-CLP versus Sham-Sham
  groups using the DNA microarray and metabolic flux data, respectively. C and D:
  Comparison between the Sham-CLP versus Sham-Sham groups using the DNA microarray
  and metabolic flux data, respectively. E and F: Comparison between the Burn-CLP
  versus Sham-CLP groups using the DNA microarray and metabolic flux data, respectively.
  In panels A, C, and E, arrows in red indicate increased gene expression, blue indicates
  decreased gene expression, and yellow indicates mixed results. (“Mixed results”
  means that several genes on the array correspond to that particular pathway and
  changed in opposite directions.) In panels B, D, and F, arrows in red indicate increased
  metabolic flux, and blue indicates decreased metabolic flux.'
