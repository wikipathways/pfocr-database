caption: DNA microarray analysis followed by functional pathway analysis revealed
  unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways activated in normal human oral keratinocytes
  (NHOKs) by EC aerosols. (A) The canonical UPR pathway was generated with the Ingenuity
  Pathways Analysis (IPA) software. A number of genes of the UPR pathways such as
  XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1), IRE1α (inositol-requiring enzyme 1, a.k.a., endoplasmic
  reticulum to nucleus signaling 1), ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4), CHOP
  (a.k.a., DDIT3, DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3) and C/EBP were induced by EC
  aerosols. (B & C) TGF-β and HGF signals activated in EC aerosol-treated NHOKs.
