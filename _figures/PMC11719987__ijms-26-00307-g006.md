caption: Schematic diagram of the role of Notch signaling in modulating ferroptosis
  and its contribution to cataract formation. In aging and oxidative stress conditions,
  downregulation of Notch signaling results in the suppression of the Nrf2/GPX4 antioxidant
  system. This suppression leads to increased cellular lipid peroxidation, elevated
  ROS levels, and iron accumulation, which promote ferroptosis in lens epithelial
  cells (LECs). Ferroptosis, as a manifestation of impaired antioxidant defense, accelerates
  cataractogenesis. Conversely, activation of the Notch pathway by JAG1 upregulates
  the Nrf2/GPX4 axis and enhances the expression of the ferroptosis-inhibiting gene
  SLC7A11, thereby protecting LECs from ferroptosis and mitigating cataract progression.
  This pathway underscores the critical role of Notch signaling in regulating oxidative
  stress and ferroptosis in the context of age-related cataracts. Created by Figdraw
