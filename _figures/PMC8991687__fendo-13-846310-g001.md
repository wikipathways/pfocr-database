caption: Bone and Tumor Microenvironment. Bone and Tumor Microenvironment. BME produces
  RANKL, IL-3, and MIP-1α (CCL3) for OC activation. RANKL leads to the inhibition
  of OC apoptosis. IFN Type 1 secreted by MM cells favors MM growth and immunosuppression.
  CCL3 secreted by MM cells activate the MAPK pathway, further stimulating osteoclastogenesis.
  MM cells can inhibit OB differentiation with sclerostin and DKK1 by dysregulating
  the Wnt signaling pathway; an essential pathway for osteoblastogenesis. MM cells
  also secrete sFRP-2 which suppresses OB differentiation. MM cells inhibit Runx-2
  in OB precursors and thus inhibit OB maturation. MM cells inhibit osteocytes via
  abnormal apoptosis by Notch signaling which is sustained by TNF-α. Crosstalk between
  BMSCs and MM cells induce pro-osteoclastogenic factors such as IL-6. MM cell secretion
  of CCL3 binds to CCR1 and CCR5 on OCs, enhancing OC activity.
