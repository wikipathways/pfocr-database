caption: Schematic diagrams representing the molecular mechanism underlying the glycation
  of FN‐regulated VEGF signalling and VEGF‐induced angiogenesis. A, Under the physiology
  condition, the binding of FN to VEGF enhances VEGF signalling and VEGF‐induced angiogenesis
  and the recruitment of c‐Src to VEGFR‐2 is critical for VEGFR‐2 phosphorylation
  and the downstream angiogenic signalling activation. B, Glycation of FN directly
  binds to RAGE and results in the interaction of RAGE to c‐Src, thereby preventing
  the binding of c‐Src to VEGFR‐2 and the consequent activation of VEGF‐VEGFR‐2 signalling
  pathway that leads to angiogenesis
