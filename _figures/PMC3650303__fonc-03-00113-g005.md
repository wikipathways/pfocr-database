caption: Post-translational modifications and interactions possibly involved in DSB
  repair pathway choice and HRR modulation. A network of proteins controls HRR and
  is regulated by cell-cycle dependent post-translational modifications. Cell-cycle
  regulation primarily relies on Cyclin/CDK dependent phosphorylation events. Regulation
  in response to DNA damage primarily relies on the activities of ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs.
  Control of end-resection plays a central role in this regulation. Resected DNA decorated
  with heterotrimeric RPA complexes forms a platform for activation of ATR. The schematic
  focuses on interactions/modifications implicated in the regulation of HRR.
