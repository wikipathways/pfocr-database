caption: Mutated GBA1 (mt) may induce cellular dysfunction through perturbing multiple
  cellular pathways including ER stress, cytosolic calcium release from the ER, or
  disrupting lysosomal function. Expression of the mt GBA1 itself or the accumulation
  of its substrate, GluCer, may cause disruptions in the autophagic-lysosomal system
  at many steps of the clearance process including substrate engulfment (as indicated
  by accumulation of ubiquitinated (Ub) and p62 inclusions), disrupted mitophagy leading
  to reactive oxygen species (ROS), or blocked autophagic lysosomal function. A-syn,
  once accumulated in pathogenic conformations of oligomers or fibrils, can further
  amplify dysfunctional cellular clearance through impeding the ER-Golgi trafficking
  of hydrolases such as wild-type (WT) GBA1 into lysosomes, or interfering directly
  with the autophagic delivery system. GBA1 mutations likely combine with other cellular
  perturbations including oxidation or a-syn aggregation, leading to neurotoxicity.
  Red text indicates possible pathogenic functions induced by GBA1 mutations. ER,
  endoplasmic reticulum; GluCer, glucosylceramide.
