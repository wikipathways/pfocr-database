caption: Mechanisms of novel strategies targeting PSCs and hypoxia environment. Activated
  PSCs show increased expressions of collagen-I and α-smooth muscle actin, which are
  important for cancer progression and metastasis. Activated PSCs also secrete IL-6,
  stromal cell-derived factor-1 and transforming growth factor-β, which are associated
  with tumor progression and metastasis. A study demonstrated that HIF-1α increases
  the secretion of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 to recruit macrophages, accelerating
  the activation of PSCs. Hypoxia can induce PSCs to secrete IL-6, which in turn promotes
  the progression of pancreatic cancer through the JAK2/STAT3 and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase pathways. Curcumin inhibits the tumor-stromal crosstalk by inhibiting
  the IL-6/ERK/NF-κB pathway, and activation of PSCs is inhibited by curcumin under
  hypoxic conditions. PSC, pancreatic stellate cell; IL, interleukin; HIF, hypoxia-inducible
  factor; CXCL2, chemokine 2; SDF-1, stromal cell derived factor-1.
