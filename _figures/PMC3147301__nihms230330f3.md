caption: NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3; also known as NALP3) is a member
  of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing gene (NLR) family
  and is an intracellular protein that can sense various pathogens, such as Listeria
  monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, pathogen products, such as lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), and crystals, such as monosodium urate (MSU)
  and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD). When activated, NLRP3 associates with
  the adapter protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC),
  which interacts with inactive pro-caspase-1. This facilitates the autocatalysis
  of pro-caspase-1 and results in the generation of active caspase-1. In vitro, expression
  of pro-interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) and activation of caspase-1 depend on Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) signalling, usually delivered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Caspase-1
  cleaves pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-33 to generate the active cytokines, which
  are then secreted through a non-canonical secretion pathway that is poorly understood.
  For a simplified version of what is known about the action of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
