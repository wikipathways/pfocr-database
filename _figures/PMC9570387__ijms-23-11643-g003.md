caption: Phosphoproteomic analyses revealed new phosphorylation signals downstream
  of dopamine receptors in emotional behaviors. (a) In D1R-MSN, the stimulation of
  D1R by dopamine increased intracellular cAMP concentrations through AC, and this
  is followed by the activation of PKA. PKA phosphorylates Rasgrp2 and Rap1gap to
  induce the activation of Rap1, which promotes the MAPK pathway. MAPK phosphorylates
  Kcnq2 to increase membrane excitability and phosphorylates Npas4 and MKL2 to facilitate
  the expression of the genes accounting for synaptic plasticity, consequently leading
  to rewarding behavior. (b) In D2R-MSN, a decreased dopamine concentration cancels
  the suppressive effects of D2R. The stimulation of A2AR without the inhibition of
  D2R increases intracellular cAMP concentrations through AC, and this is followed
  by the activation of PKA. PKA phosphorylates Rasgrp2 and Rap1gap to induce the activation
  of Rap1, which promotes the MAPK pathway involved in synaptic plasticity. Acetylcholine/M1R
  signaling activates PKC to promote the phosphorylation of Kcnq2, which is involved
  in membrane excitability. These changes consequently lead to aversive behavior.
