  by Cld1 and Taz1, respectively, to form mature CL (CLm). The mechanism by which
  CLm is transported from the IMM to the OMM remains to be elucidated. PE biosynthesis
  in yeast is accomplished by four different pathways: 1) Psd1-catalyzed decarboxylation
  of PS in the mitochondria, 2) Psd2-catalyzed decarboxylation of PS in the endosome,
  3) incorporation of Etn in to PE via the cytosolic/ER Kennedy pathway enzymes Eki1,
  Ect1, and Ept1, 4) Ale1 catalysed conversion of lysoPE to PE in the ER or the mitochondrial
  associated membranes. The mechanism by which PS is transported from ER to mitochondria
  remains unclear, although membrane contact site structures like the ER-mitochondria
  encounter structure (ERMES) has been proposed to play a role in this process. Ups2
  and Mdm35 transport PS from the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to the inner
  mitochondrial membrane (IMM). PE biosynthesized in the ER can also be trafficked
  to IMM by an unknown mechanism. The mechanism of PE export is also currently unknown.
