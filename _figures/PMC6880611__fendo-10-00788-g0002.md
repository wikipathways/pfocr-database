caption: Chronic inflammation in MetS and skin diseases. Adipokines can be classified
  as pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory ones depending on their effects on inflammation.
  Anti-inflammatory adipokines are represented by adiponectin, secreted frizzled-related
  protein 5 (SFRP5) and omentin-1, as well as classical cytokines like IL-6, IL-10,
  IL-4. Chemerin, leptin, resistin and classical cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6 belong
  to pro-inflammatory adipokines. On one hand, for metabolic syndrome patients, altered
  adipokines secretion may mediate cutaneous inflammatory response through autocrine,
  paracrine and endocrine. On the other hand, the “inflammatory skin march” might
  be another mechanism underlying the connection of MetS and some skin diseases. The
  cutaneous inflammatory mediators could migrate into the systemic circulation and
  the release of these proinflammatory cytokines results in the chronic systemic inflammation
  and MetS. The activation of NFkB signaling pathway is a commom pathway underlying
  skin diseases and MetS, in the canonical NFkB pathway, the dimer of p65 and p50
  is in an inactive state by the inhibition of IκB in cytoplasm. Upon stimulation
  by various cytokine receptors, IKKs are activated, leading to phosphorylate IκB,
  which results in their degradation and enables NFκB translocate to the nucleus to
  induce target gene expression. The activation of NFκB then produces a wide range
  of chemokines and cytokines, which leads to the formation of a feed forward loop,
  and establishs a chronic inflammatory environment.
