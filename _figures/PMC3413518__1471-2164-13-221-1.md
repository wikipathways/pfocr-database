caption: 'Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway (adapted from Luet al.2008). The isopentenyl
  diphosphate (IPP) is synthesized via the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)
  pathway. IPP and DMAPP form the central intermediate geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  (GGDP) for carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. Phytoene synthase (PSY) acts at the
  condensation of two molecules of GGDP to form the phytoene, the first step of the
  carotenoid pathway. Names of compounds are highlighted in black and of enzymes in
  red. Abbreviations: G3P, glyceraldheyde-3-phosphate; DXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate;
  HMBPP, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate; ABA, abscisic acid; DXR, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate reductoisomerase; DXS, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; IPI, isopentenyl
  diphosphate isomerase; GGPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; PDS, phytoene
  desaturase; Z-ISO, ζ-carotene isomerase; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase; CRTISO, carotene
  isomerase; LCYB, β-cyclase; LCYE, ϵ-cyclase; ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase; VDE, violaxanthin
  de-epoxidase; NSY, neoxanthin synthase; NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase.'
