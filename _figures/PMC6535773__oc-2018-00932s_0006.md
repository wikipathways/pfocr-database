caption: A scheme describing the effects of dimensionality (top left) and the cell
  malignancy potential (bottom left) on lipid species amounts in the MCF10A breast
  cancer in vitro model. Lipid-rich areas (red) are observed in the necrotic core
  with decreasing amounts toward the spheroid periphery alongside large lipid droplets
  at the periphery. The observed increase in the ratio of neutral to membrane lipid
  species in 3D versus 2D may be related to large lipid droplet formation through
  TG synthesis and/or lipid droplet coalescence (top right). The observed increase
  in sphingolipid species in invasive versus precancer spheroids could be due to enhancement
  of the de novo sphingolipid synthesis pathway (bottom right, adapted from Ogretmen).
  Species of lipids increased out of total lipids in 3D invasive spheroids are underlined.
  CoA = coenzyme A, SPT = serine palmitoyltransferase, KDSR = 3-ketosphinganine reductase,
  CERS = (dihydro)ceramide synthases, DES = dihydroceramide desaturase, SMS = sphingomyelin
  synthase, CDase = ceramidases.
