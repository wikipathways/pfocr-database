caption: Gp120 binds to the CXCR4 receptor, and then triggers a series of downstream
  cellular signaling events involving TNFα/CREB/NMDAR, Wnt/β-catenin/FKN, Wnt5a/JNK/CAMKII
  and PLC/PKC/caspase 3 signal pathway. The interaction between neurons and microglia
  in response to infection induces neuropathic pain via different mechanisms. A. Stimulated
  by gp120, microglia up-regulate TNFα in a way of paracrine, TNFα/TNFR1 signal results
  in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria, which induced the
  phosphorylation of CREB triggering the pC/EBP (). C/EBP promotes recycling of NMDAR
  regulating the concentration of Ca2+ intracellularly (; ). B. FKN specifically expressed
  in neurons is upregulated by gp120, which activates microglia through CX3CR1. C.
  Transcription of Wnt5a is increased after gp120 application, stimulate the production
  of inflammatory cytokines in a paracrine fashion. Wnt5a/JNK is critical for TNFα
  expression, whereas Wnt5a/CaMKII is necessary for IL-1β and P2X7R is another factor
  predominant in driving IL-1β release. The expression of IL-6 is co-regulated by
  both pathways. D. Exposure of neurons to gp120 produces transient outward K+ currents
  in a PKC-dependent manner. The alteration of intracellular K+ homeostasis leads
  to neuronal apoptosis by activation of caspase-3. PLC, phospholipase C; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  PKC, protein kinase C; Casp 3, caspase 3; Fzd2, Frizzled family receptor 2; Ror2,
  receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2.
