caption: Tim-3 signaling pathway. A The ligands for Tim-3 consist of Galectin-9, HMGB-1,
  Ceacam-1 and PtdSer. Bat3 and Fyn both bind to the identical region on the intracellular
  tail of Tim-3. The natural ligands binding to Tim-3 cause Tyr263 and Tyr256 on the
  intracellular domain phosphorylation with subsequent Bat3 displacing and recruitment
  of Fyn. This triggers apoptosis in immune cells, thereby enhancing the inhibitory
  function of Tim-3. B α-Lactose is a disaccharide sugar that binds to Galectin-9,
  thereby preventing Galectin-9 from interacting with Tim-3. Anti-Tim-3 antibodies
  can inhibit the binding of natural ligands to Tim-3, which helps preserve the interaction
  between Tim-3 and Bat3. This, in turn, activates immune cells by facilitating the
  recruitment of Lck, restoring their functional responses
