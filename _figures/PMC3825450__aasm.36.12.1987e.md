caption: 'Hypothesized connections between mathematical model variables and the neurobiology
  of sleep and wakefulness. The schematic is based on a theory of local, use-dependent
  sleep and provides speculative explanations of key phenomena of waking neurobehavioral
  impairment due to sleep loss, as follows: (A) On a time scale in the order of milliseconds
  to seconds, information processing in a cortical column or other neuronal assembly
  associated with a given performance task triggers a biochemical cascade (red elements),
  which induces a sleep-like state locally. When the neuronal assembly is in the wake
  state and stimulated by input, it responds with synaptic transmission to process
  the input signal and generate corresponding output. The synaptic transmission is
  associated with release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into the extracellular space.
  Breakdown of extracellular ATP results in increased extracellular adenosine production,
  at a rate approximately proportional to the amount of synaptic transmission in response
  to stimulation (i.e., use-dependent). Binding of extracellular adenosine at adenosine
  (purine type 1) receptors promotes the neuronal assembly sleep-like state, during
  which the assembly''s synaptic transmission patterns are fundamentally altered.
  This functionally changes the contribution of the neuronal assembly to the coordinated
  response of the larger neuronal pathway involved in the performance task, causing
  degraded (delayed and/or impaired) information processing. As such, the local sleep-like
  state causes output variability, which leads to stochastic cognitive performance
  variability and thus neurobehavioral performance impairment. In this context, we
  posit that in our model, p(t) corresponds to extracellular adenosine production
  rate. (B) On a time scale of minutes to hours (blue elements), binding of ATP to
  purine type 2 X7 receptors results in release of sleep regulatory substances (SRSs)
  such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL1). The SRSs mediate neuronal
  plasticity, and promote the neuronal assembly sleep-like state through growth hormone
  releasing hormone (GHRH) mediated activation of GABAergic neurons. These GABAergic
  neurons inhibit glutamatergic excitatory neurons, which prevents the glutamatergic
  neurons from promoting the local wake state. The SRSs together with adenosine also
  influence regional blood supply and thereby oxygen and metabolic supply. As a consequence
  of these SRS effects, the probability of entering the sleep-like state increases
  in a time- and use-dependent manner, giving rise at the cognitive level to habituation
  and the time-on-task effect. A rest break (or switching to a task that does not
  intensively use the same neuronal pathway) allows SRS and adenosine levels to decay,
  resetting the time-on-task effect. (C) On a time scale of hours to days, basal synaptic
  activity in neuronal assemblies throughout the brain, and the associated release
  of ATP into the extracellular space, leads to a global build-up of SRSs over time
  awake. This is modulated by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which orchestrate
  circadian rhythms in the cellular machinery and neuronal activation across the brain.
  As such, time awake and time of day independently and in interaction amplify use-dependent
  neurobehavioral impairment and the magnitude of the time-on-task effect. Sustained
  exposure to wake extension and repeated intensive use of neuronal assemblies over
  days to weeks cause the SRSs to accumulate and, via their receptors and nuclear
  factor κB, increase the density of post-synaptic adenosine A1 (purine type 1) receptors.
  This leads to cumulative performance deficits across days of chronic sleep restriction
  and allostatic shifting of the homeostatic equilibrium for sleep/wake regulation.
  Conversely, across multiple days of recovery sleep the adenosine receptors downregulate,
  the homeostatic equilibrium point shifts back, and baseline performance capability
  is gradually restored. We posit that in our model, u(t) reflects adenosine receptor
  density, and c(t) represents global circadian modulation by the SCN. (D) Subcortical
  circuits involved in the coordination of whole-brain sleep (green elements) are
  influenced by the collective neuronal assembly states, integrated across the brain
  through mechanisms involving the SRSs., The subcortical circuits concerned include
  the SCN, as well as the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), which can deactivate
  the wake-promoting (e.g., glutamatergic) neurons of the reticular activating system
  and other systems such as the cholinergic networks of the basal forebrain. These
  subcortical systems thus nycthemerally and homeostatically balance and consolidate
  sleep/wake states globally, seeking to induce whole-brain sleep to prevent interaction
  with the environment when too many neuronal assemblies would otherwise be in the
  local sleep-like state. The global sleep state allows SRS concentrations to be restored,
  and adenosine receptors to be gradually downregulated, in a coordinated manner across
  all neuronal assemblies. This counteracts the effects of prior time awake both globally
  and locally. We posit that in our model, κ(t) captures the homeostatic influence
  of the collective neuronal assembly states, as integrated across the brain through
  SRSs, on SCN activity. Figure adapted from ref.  with permission.'
