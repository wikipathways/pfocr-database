caption: 'RAS triggering processes in cancer cells. Activated RAS performs various
  functions in the cell that promote cancer development, such as cell cycle progression,
  inhibition of apoptosis, cell growth and metabolism and cell motility and migration,
  and supports the evasion of cancer cells from the immune system. PD-L1: programmed
  cell death ligand 1, MHC-1: major histocompatibility complex 1, IL: interleucin,
  CCL9: chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 9, CXCL3: chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 3, VEGFA:
  vascular endothelial growth factor A, RAS: rat sarcoma virus, IRF2: interferon regulatory
  factor 2, HIF-1: hypoxia-inducible factor 1, TTP: tristetraprolin, RAF: rapidly
  accelerated fibrosarcoma kinases, ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase, MAPK:
  mitogen-activated protein kinases, PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT: protein
  kinase B, mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin, p53: tumor suppressor protein, CDK4/6:
  cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, MYC: myelocytoma proto-oncogene, FoxM1: forkhead
  box M1, GTP: guanosinetriphosphate, GDP: guanosine diphosphate. RAS activates the
  MAPK pathways, which activate the transcription of several transcription factors
  (FOS, JUN, ETS, MYC…) that support the proliferation of cancer cells. RAS also plays
  an important role in activating the PI3K-AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein
  kinase B) signaling pathway, which supports oncogenic transcription through the
  NF-κB (Nuclear factor-kappa B) signaling pathway, prevents apoptosis by inhibiting
  the pro-apoptotic protein BAD (BCL2 associated agonist of cell death), and promotes
  tumor cell growth and metabolism through mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) [34]'
