caption: 'NADPH production from the oxidative PPP and one-carbon serine catabolism
  pathway.Notes: Oxidative PPP uses glucose to generate NADPH via G6PD and 6PGD. G6PD
  is inhibited by then FDA-approved drug, 6-AN. NADP+ is generated through the NAD+
  salvage pathway, where nicotinamide is converted to NMN via NAMPT. NADP+ is then
  formed by NADK. FK866 and GMX1778 inhibit NAMPT to block the production of NADP+,
  and therefore NADPH. During ROS stress, p53 positively regulates TIGAR to shunt
  glycolytic flux into the oxidative PPP. PKM2, which is overexpressed in many cancers,
  is inhibited by ROS, allowing glycolytic flux to be shuttled into the oxidative
  PPP for NADPH generation. The small-molecule compounds, ML-202/203/265, can positively
  modulate PKM2, thereby decreasing glycolytic flux into the oxidative PPP and blunting
  NADPH biogenesis during ROS.Abbreviations: PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; NADPH,
