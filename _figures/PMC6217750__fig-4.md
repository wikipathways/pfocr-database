caption: Heme-dependent repression and degradation of Rev-erbα/β. One mode of Rev-erbα/β
  repression is through competition with RORα for binding to its response element
  (ROR-RE) within the promoters of target genes. Rev-erbs can bind as monomers and
  homodimers to Rev-REs, although recent studies suggest that they may also form heterodimers
  (, , ). Although Fe3+-heme binds to Rev-erbβ with high affinity (Kd ≤0.1 nM), redox
  processes that cause dissociation of the Fe3+-heme axial thiolate ligand (including
  thiol-disulfide interconversion and Fe3+- to Fe2+-heme reduction) cause Kd to increase
  to ≥14 nM (). Since the concentration of RH in the nucleus is ≤2.5 nM (), loss of
  the HRM heme axial thiolate would cause dissociation of heme. Coimmunoprecipitation
  studies show that the NCoR1-HDAC3 complex has a high affinity for heme-bound Rev-erbα/β
  (, ); once bound, the complex leads to target gene repression via histone deacetylation.
  Additional regulators of Rev-erbβ repressor activity have been identified, including
  Tip60, an acetyl transferase, HDAC1, a histone deacetylase, and ZNHIT-1, a zinc-finger
  containing protein; GSK3β has also been shown to regulate the stability of the α-isoform
  (see main text for references); whether heme plays a role in regulating interactions
  of these proteins with Rev-erbs is unknown. Gaseous signaling molecules, NO and
  CO may also regulate the repressor function of Rev-erbs by binding to heme; however,
  additional studies are required to support this hypothesis. Although heme facilitates
  interaction of NCoR1 with Rev-erbs, it also appears to promote proteasomal degradation
  of both isoforms through a ubiquitin-dependent pathway involving E3-ligases Arf-bp1
  and Myc-bp2. CO, carbon monoxide; HDAC1, histone deacetylase 1; NO, nitric oxide;
  RH, regulatory heme; RORα, RAR-related orphan receptor α.
