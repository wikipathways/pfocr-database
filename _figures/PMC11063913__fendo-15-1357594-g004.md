  Regulatory mechanisms of SOX9 in sex differentiation. SOX9 can maintain SOX9 expression in Sertoli cells through three pathways mediated by SF1, FGF9/FGFR2, and PGTDS/PGD2. SRY upregulates SOX9 expression in undifferentiated gonads by binding to TES. SOX9 upregulates FGF9 and forms a positive feed-forward loop with FGF9 to maintain SOX9 expression. SOX9 promotes the expression of PTGDS in vivo by binding to the PTGDS promoter. The persistence of SOX9 promotes the production of L-PGDS, which leads to the accumulation of PGD2 and thus activates the transcription of SOX9. Later, these SOX9
  + pre-Sertoli cells will form the primitive cords with spermatogenic cells. SOX9, sex-determining region Y-box 9; SRY, sex-determining region Y; FGF9, fibroblast growth factor 9; FGFR2, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2
