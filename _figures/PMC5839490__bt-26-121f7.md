caption: Proposed molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of rhTrx on ox-LDL-induced
  foam cell formation and apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells. The uptake of ox-LDL initiates
  a downstream signal cascade. It promotes ROS overproduction and p38 MAPK phosphorylation.
  The activation of p38 MAPK signaling could up-regulate Bax expression and down-regulate
  Bcl-2 and activated caspase-3 expression, which play critical roles in macrophage
  apoptosis. Moreover, p38 MAPK phosphorylation could up-regulate the expression of
  LOX-1, a scavenger receptor for ox-LDL, stimulate ox-LDL uptake and promote foam
  cell formation. RhTrx reduces the production of ROS and suppresses the activation
  of p38 MAPK induced by ox-LDL, restoring the related pathway and consequently suppressing
  foam cell formation and apoptosis.
