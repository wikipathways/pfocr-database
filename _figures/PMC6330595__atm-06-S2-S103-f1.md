caption: Graphical representation of glutamine/2-HG pathway and therapeutics options
  in renal cancer based on Shelar et al. Glutamine is the source of 2-HG. Glutamine
  is metabolized to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) with glutaminase-1 (GLS-1). IDH1 or 2 (IDH1/2)
  are involving in metabolizing α-KG to D-2-HG and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) or lactate
  dehydrogenase 1 (LDH1) will metabolize α-KG to L-2-HG. D-2-HG dehydrogenase (D2HGDH)
  and L-2HG dehydrogenase (L2HGDH) convert D-2-HG and L-2-HG to α-KG. A decrease in
  L2HGDH results in accumulation of the oncometabolite L-2-HG. In turn high L-2-HG
  inhibits activity of histone lysine demethylase 6A (KDM6A) to promote H3K27 trimethylation
  (H3K27Me3) in RCC cells. The glutaminase-1 (GLS-1) inhibitor CB-839 and MDH inhibitor
  (derivative of benzylpaullones) can be potential therapeutic targets for RCC. RCC,
  renal cell carcinoma.
