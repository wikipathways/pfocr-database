caption: Proposed model of increase PTHrP expression in breast cancer cells. Depicted
  is a proposed model of how EGFR can stimulate PTHrP expression. Our data suggests
  that activation of EGFR on Tyr992 is necessary for PTHrP expression. Tyr992 has
  been reported to be coupled to the PLC γ and the PKC pathways but we did not evaluate
  this. PKC will then activated the MAPK pathway and eventually activate the Ets transcription
  factor. The Ets protein can then activate the transcription of the PTHrP-P3 promoter
