caption: Illustration of the principle for defining an accessory pathway potential
  (Ap). Note that when atrial pacing at a cycle length of 420 ms occurs, there is
  loss of preexcitation, although the atrial and ventricular electrograms are retained.
  Yet, the "candidate" potential is not seen, effectively dissociating this potential
  from the atrium as well as the ventricle (see text for details).
