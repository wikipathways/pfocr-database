caption: 'The plant mitochondrial electron transport chain. NADH oxidation by complex
  I is coupled to proton transport from the matrix to IMS, while NAD(P)H oxidation
  by a series of alternate dehydrogenases is not coupled to proton transport. Similarly,
  electron flow from ubiquinol to complex IV (reducing O2 to H2O) is coupled to proton
  transport (at two sites) while electron flow from ubiquinol to AOX (also reducing
  O2 to H2O) is not coupled to proton transport. Proton transport generates a proton
  motive force that is subsequently dissipated by ATP synthase (complex V) to produce
  ATP. Plants can therefore modulate their ATP yield depending on the components of
  the ETC being used for NAD(P)H oxidation and O2 reduction. When the ability of an
  ETC component to transport electrons is reduced and/or membrane potential is high,
  electron transport can slow, leading to an over-reduction of the ETC. Under these
  conditions, single electron leak to O2 or nitrite increases, producing O2− and NO,
  respectively. In plants, the specific sites and mechanisms of O2− and NO generation
  are not yet well understood. See text for further details. I, II, III, IV, V: complexes
