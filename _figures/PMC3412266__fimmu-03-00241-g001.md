caption: Atypical PKC signaling pathways leading to lymphocyte activation and/or differentiation.
  (A) Signaling through B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in B-lymphocytes. PKCζ is required
  for the activation of ERK after antigen challenge and necessary for IκB transcription
  and for the activation and nuclear translocation of c-Fos. The transcription of
  NF-κB-dependent genes IL-6 and Bcl-XL, and the secretion of T-dependent immunoglobulins
  depend on PKCζ-mediated signaling. The aPKC inhibitor Par-4 blocks PKCζ activation
  and B cell proliferation. (B) Signaling pathways in T lymphocytes. After antigen
  presentation, downstream signaling through T cell receptor (TCR) takes place. Atypical
  PKCζ and PKCλ/ɩ are important for IKK activation and NF-κB nuclear translocation,
  together with p62 scaffold protein that links the aPKCs with TCR activation through
  MALT-1 and TRAF-6 proteins. Moreover PKCλ/ɩ activates JNK and NFATc1 nuclear translocation,
  required for Th2 differentiation of T cells. Signaling through IL-4 receptor (IL-4R)
  requires both atypical PKCs to fully activate Jak1/Stat6 pathway and therefore to
  Th2 differentiation. Par 4 inhibits TCR and IL-4R signaling pathways blocking the
  activation of aPKCs.
