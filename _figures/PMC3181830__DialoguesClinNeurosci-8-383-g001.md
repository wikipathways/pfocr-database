caption: Schematic representation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
  Hypophysiotropic neurons localized in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus
  synthesize corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and vasopressin (AVP). In response
  to stress, CRF is released into hypophysial portal vessels that access the anterior
  pituitary gland. Binding of CRF to the CRF type 1 receptor (CRFR1) on pituitary
  corticotropes activates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway events that
  induce the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the systemic circulation.
  In the presence of CRF, AVP elicits synergistic effects on ACTH release that are
  mediated through the vasopressin V1b receptor. Circulating ACTH binds to the melanocortin
  type 2 receptor (MC2-R) in the adrenal cortex where it stimulates glucocorticoid
  synthesis and secretion into the systemic circulation. Glucocorticoids regulate
  physiological events and inhibit further HPA axis activation (red lines) through
  intracellular receptors that are widely distributed throughout the brain and peripheral
  tissues. IP3, inositol triphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol .
