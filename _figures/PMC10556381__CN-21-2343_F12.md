caption: Schematic illustration depicting the putative pathways associated with the
  therapeutic effect of QCN on the BPA-induced neuropathic pain in rats. QCN significantly
  attenuate pain hypersensitivity following the C7 spinal root avulsion in rats. The
  neuroprotective effects of QCN are attributed to the inhibition of neuroinflammatory
  response and oxidative stress, at least partially via suppression of P2X receptors
  and inhibition of the activation of PKC/MAPK/NOX pathway.
