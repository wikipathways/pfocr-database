caption: Potential Crosstalk between the interferon signaling pathway and PD-L1 signalosome.
  STRING analysis of the core mediators of IFN signal transduction. STRING analysis
  was performed by introducing all the proteins from the interactome (supplementary
  figure  and supplementary Tables ) together with key regulators of IFN signal transduction
  (IFNAR1, STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, JAK1, JAK2) and mediators of apoptosis (CASP3, CASP7,
  CASP9) as inputs (https://string-db.org/) and selecting the Homo sapiens database
  to detect interactions with a medium confidence of 0.7. According to the functional
  interactome provided by STRING based on known published molecular interactions,
  mTOR/AKT plays a central regulatory role coordinating the inhibition of caspases
  via AKT and its interactions with STATs. Importantly, mTOR/AKT associates and integrates
  signals from DNA damage response kinases with regulators of Ras signaling, PI4K
  and c-myc. The relationships between proteins are indicated within the graph as
  action types and action effects
