caption: This study showed that after 24 hours of treatment with YM155, the miR-9
  expression levels increased significantly compared to control cells; in addition,
  the expression of two target genes, including MDR1 and SIRT1, decreased significantly.
  It is suggested that one of the effects of YM155 on inhibiting the growth and DNA
  damage response of leukemic cells can be via the miR-9/SIRT1/p53 pathway (). Furthermore,
  a decrease in the expression of MDR1 can indicate the effectiveness of YM155 in
  increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs and reducing drug
  resistance.
