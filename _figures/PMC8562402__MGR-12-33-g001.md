caption: 'Proposed therapeutic effects of O3 therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.Note:
  COVID-19 serves as an ACE2 receptor to enter into human respiratory epithelial cells
  through its Spike proteins. The transcription factor Nrf2 bound to Keep-1 activated
  by alkenals. The released Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and, after binding
  to Maf, docks on ARE and activates several genes leading to the synthesis of antioxidant
  proteins. O3 can inhibit apoptosis and degradation of the cartilage matrix by inhibiting
  the activation of NF-κB resulting in cell survival. O3 has immunomodulatory effects
  by anti-inflammatory properties by modulating NLRP3, inhibition of cytokine storm
  (reduction of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-18, IL-12, GM-CSF), O3 can stimulate
  cellular and humoral immunity through secondary messengers (H2O2) and NFAT/AP-1
  signaling pathway. O3 is a multifunctional drug that can stimulate inflammatory
  cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10).
  Biological responses to Nrf2/ARE activation with mild OT oxidative stress increase
  the levels of direct antioxidants such as GSH, CO, and bilirubin through glutathione
  and thioredoxin reductase. O3 can reduce biomarkers such as CRP, ESR, and uric acid,
  which have been shown to reduce CRP in patients with COVID-19. O3 increases oxygenation
  to the blood and tissues prevents the formation of small thrombosis by secretion
  of some prostacyclins such as PGI2. O3 increases the expression of HO-1 in endothelial
  cells, stimulates 2–3 diphosphoglycerates, so more oxygen to the delivered tissues
  in COVID-19 patients. O3 or its mediators (ozonides [ROS, LOPs]) are capable of
  oxidizing cysteine and tryptophan residues on S-spike protein and preventing their
  binding to the ACE2. O2-O3 also affects NO and iNOS signaling pathways. NO, especially
  by inhibiting palmitoylation of S protein, reduces the viral replication of COVID-19,
  thus preventing the virus from binding to the ACE2 receptor. ACE2: Angiotensin-converting
