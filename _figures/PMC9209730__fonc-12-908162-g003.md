caption: The mechanisms regulate the expression of LINC01133 in the cancers of different
  tissue type. The overexpression of LINC01133 could be regulated by gene amplification
  of LINC01133, the enhanced transcription of LINC01133, the increased transport of
  LINC01133 by EVs and the promoting effect from MSC in TME. The inhibition of LINC01133
  could be regulated by the TGF-β pathway. GDF15 belongs to TGF-βsubfamily and also
  inhibit LINC01133 transcription. Compared with normal tissue cells, the number of
  LINC01133-containing exosomes secreted and received by cancer cells is reduced,
  which is one of the reasons why the concentration of LINC01133 in tumor cells decreases.
  The red arrow indicates the mechanisms that promote the expression of LINC01133,
  while the green arrow indicates the mechanisms that inhibit it. The black dashed
  lines separate different studies of the mechanisms that regulate the expression
  of LINC01133.
