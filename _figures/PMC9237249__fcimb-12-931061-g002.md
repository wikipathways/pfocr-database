caption: SARS-CoV-2 enters cells through ACE2 receptors, and ACE2 increases capillary
  permeability, allowing more SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, which in turn induces the
  development of ARDS. COVID-19 activated an immune response in which NK cells, CD4+
  T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes and B cells reacted immunologically in COVID-19
  patients, causing the production of cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, TNF, etc. Reducing COVID-19
  infection and prevent ARDS through Fas/FasL pathway, JAK/STAT pathway, and NF-κB
  pathway. Helping patients to prevent and treat COVID-19 by increasing type I interferon
  and vitamin D.
