caption: A TAM-regulated cycle of inflammation in dendritic cells. An initial recognition
  phase (1, green), mediated by Toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR4 on the cell surface
  and TLR3 in endosomes) and other pattern recognition receptors triggers a kinase
  cascade that leads to the activation of transcription factors (IRF3/7, AP-1, NF-κB)
  that drive the production of an initial bolus of type I interferons (IFNs) and other
  proinflammatory cytokines. In a second response phase (2, blue), the levels of these
  cytokines are elevated via a feed-forward, JAK-STAT-dependent amplification loop.
  This same JAK-SAT pathway drives the transcription of the Axl gene. In a final resolution
  phase (3, red), the induced Axl protein binds to the R1 chain of the type I IFN
  receptor (IFNAR). The hybrid TAM-IFNAR receptor activates a Stat1 dimer that drives
  the transcription of the genes encoding SOCS1 and SOCS3. These proteins inhibit
  both TLR and cytokine receptor signaling, and thereby return the dendritic cell
  to baseline (; ). The features of this self-limiting cycle predict that the provision
  of an immune stimulus to a dendritic cell with diminished TAM signaling will always
  result in a hyperelevated inflammatory response. See text for details. (From ; adapted
