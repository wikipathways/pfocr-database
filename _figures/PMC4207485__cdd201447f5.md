caption: Proapoptotic signalling pathways activated in NGF-deprived sympathetic neurons.
  When sympathetic neurons are deprived of NGF, the MLK-JNK-c-Jun pathway is activated.
  MLKs phosphorylate MAP kinase kinases such as MKK4/7, which in turn phosphorylate
  JNKs. JNK activity increases leading to the phosphorylation of the AP-1 transcription
  factors c-Jun and ATF2. This increases the ability of c-Jun to activate the transcription
  of target genes such as bim, dp5 and c-jun itself. c-Jun can also bind to AP-1 sites
  in the promoter of mkp1, which encodes a MAPK phosphatase that acts as a negative
  regulator of the JNK pathway. The MLK inhibitor CEP-11004, which prevents JNK activation,
  and dominant-negative c-Jun reduce the induction of c-Jun, Bim and Dp5 and block
  cell death
