caption: 'Proteins and metabolites differentially accumulating in response to the

  of the, respectively, 212 and three differential (two‐way ANOVA; FDR corrected P ≤ 0.05)
  proteins and metabolites across five time‐points. Data are presented as log2 fold
  change between control and treatment. Red indicates down‐ while blue up‐regulation.

  between control and treatment calculated from the five time‐points was used for
  MapMan visualization (Thimm et al, ) of the differential proteins (squares) and
