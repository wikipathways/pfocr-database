caption: By it chemical structure, curcumin may act as a natural free radical (ROS)
  scavenger. Acting through the Neurotrophic factor κB (NF- κB) curcumin can decrease
  the release of different interleukins. Curcumin could act as a stress response mimetic
  that induces some components of the protein homeostasis network or as it is known
  to bind amyloid, directly acts in the misfolded cascade. This induction requires
  the transcription factors HSF-1 and Nrf2 (SKN-1 in C. elegans). Additionally, curcumin
  could act as a DR mimetic to activate these transcription factors through the AMPK
  pathway (Black arrows = induction, red symbol = inhibition).
