caption: Ccr4-Not acts upstream of the lysosomal V-ATPase to promote its assembly
  and/or stability, which is necessary for full TORC1 activation. Whether this is
  through direct regulation of the V-ATPase by Ccr4-Not mediate ubiquitination, or
  if it involves Ccr4-Not’s role as a chaperone compex, has yet to be determined.
  Because the V-ATPase also activates the Ras/PKA pathway, Ccr4-Not also may be required
  for full Ras/PKA signaling. Genetic results also indicate that Ccr4-Not acts downstream
  of the V-ATPase to promote TORC1 function. Whether this regulation is direct or
  indirect is not known currently. Question marks indicate important questions that
  remain to be addressed going forward.
