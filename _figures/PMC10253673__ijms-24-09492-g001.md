caption: Schematic representation of the potential mechanisms by which alcohol modulates
  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Alcohol consumption can activate Toll-like receptors,
  which trigger the innate immune response, aggravate microglial activation, and cause
  neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death (1). Chronic alcohol intake can also activate
  the mTOR/Akt pathway, which phosphorylates GSK-3 and causes tau hyperphosphorylation,
  leading to neurodegeneration (2). Alcohol is also known to upregulate the CDK5 and
  GSK-3β kinase activities, leading to tau hyperphosphorylation (3). Alcohol is additionally
  known to alter the PKA/CREB signaling pathway and increase BACE-1 activity, leading
  to the upregulation and deposition of Aβ (4). Similarly, chronic alcohol intake
  can increase APP levels and BACE-1 activity, leading to increased Aβ production
  (5). Additionally, alcohol intake causes thiamine deficiency, which activates BACE-1
  and microglial cells and triggers proinflammatory cytokine release, leading to Aβ
  accumulation (6). Chronic alcohol intake also dysregulates the cholinergic and endocannabinoid
  system, leading to cognitive decline (7). Chronic alcohol intake is additionally
  known to disrupt insulin signaling and impair the cholinergic system, increasing
  Aβ deposition, neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits (8). Alcohol intake is known
  to cause BBB (9) and microglial (10) dysfunction, which are significant drivers
  of AD pathology and cognitive deficits. Apart from these cerebral effects of alcohol,
  other potential mechanisms by which alcohol can modulate AD pathology include an
  increase in Aβ accumulation with aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency and alterations
  in hepatic Aβ processing associated with liver injury. The latter may act as a source
  of brain Aβ. The figure was created using BioRender.com. Aβ, Amyloid beta; AD, Alzheimer’s
