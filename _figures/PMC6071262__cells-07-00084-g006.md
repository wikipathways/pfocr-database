caption: Schematic drawing of the 1-carbon methylation cycle. The methionine and the
  folate cycle, as well as the transulfuration pathway, are three interrelated routes
  involved in one-carbon metabolism, which is required for the synthesis of amino
  acids, neurotransmitters, and methylation of DNA and proteins. B6, vitB6; B12, vitB12;
  BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin; CBS, cystathionine-β-synthase; MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase;
  MS, methionine synthase; MT, methyltransferase; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; SAHH, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase;
  SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; THF, tetrahydrofolate.
