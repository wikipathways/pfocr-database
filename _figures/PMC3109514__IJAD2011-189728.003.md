caption: Schematic representation of pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms involved in
  neuronal plasticity and the role of GSK3. In the presynapse GSK3 activity decreases
  the expression of SynI reducing the release of glutamate while in postsynapses GSK3
  transiently activates NMDA receptors leading to endocytosis of AMPA receptors and
  reduces the levels of PSD93 protein, favoring LTD. In contrast, Wnt and PI3K signaling
  pathways or pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 by LiCl supports the induction of
  LTP, facilitating learning and memory. GSK3 inhibition is also involved in axon
  and dendritic widening in both pre- and postsynaptic sites. Serine/threonine phosphatases
  PP1 and PP2A can activate GSK3 regulating phosphor-GSK3 levels through its dephosphorylation.
  GSK3 is important in the modulation of multiple signaling pathways including Notch
  pathway that plays an important role in different developmental processes. In AD,
  amyloid-β oligomers inhibit Wnt and insulin signaling pathways leading to activation
  of GSK3. In addition, GSK3 overactivation mediates τ hyperphosphorylation and microtubule
  destabilization.
