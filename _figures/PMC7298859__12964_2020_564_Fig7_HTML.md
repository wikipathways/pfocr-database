caption: TNFα/TNFR2 immune checkpoint signaling pathway could be used to target different
  aspects of tumor cells micro environment. This schematic depicts three different
  possibilities which tumor cells use to recruit/interact with other cells to escape
  from host immune response and to create highly angiogenic and immunosuppressive
  microenvironment. Targeting TNFα/TNFR2 axis could first, inhibit Tregs and the consequent
  immunosuppression. Second, it interrupts tumor survival and proliferation. Third,
  it hampers angiogenesis and immunosuppression by EPCs. TCR = T Cell Receptor, MHC = Major
  Histocompatibility Complex, PD1 = Programmed cell death protein 1, PDL1/L2 = Programmed
  Death-ligand 1, and 2, CTLA-4 = Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4
