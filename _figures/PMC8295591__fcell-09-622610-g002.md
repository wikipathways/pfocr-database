caption: HIV-1 assembly and budding. (A) The host transcriptional machinery transcribes
  the viral genes. After synthesis in the cytoplasm, Rev associates with RanGDP and
  Importin-β, forming the complex Rev-Importin-β-RanGDP which is imported into nucleus
  through nuclear pores (step 1). In the nucleus, the conversion of RanGDP to RanGTP
  mediated by RRC1 disassemble Rev from Importin-β, allowing Importin-β to be exported
  back to the cytoplasm (step 2). Rev then binds RRE (present in viral RNA molecules),
  RanGTP, and Crm1 and the Crm1-RanGTP-Rev-RRE complex exits the nucleus through the
  nuclear pores (step 3). After the translocation to the cytoplasm, RanGTP is converted
  to RanGDP by RanGAP1 and RanBP1, allowing the disassembly of the complex, and Crm1
  is imported again to the nucleus while transported viral RNAs are free to be translated
  (step 4). (B) Env is synthesized in association with the ER membrane and transported
  to the Golgi complex. After reaching the Golgi, Env is transported to the PM, where
  new HIV-1 particles are formed. This trafficking occurs via transport vesicles that
  require ARF-1 GTPase. Rab GTPases control several steps of HIV-1 structural protein
  trafficking in endosomes. Rab7A is required for mature Env incorporation into nascent
  virus particles. Rab9 was proposed to Env and Gag from the endolysosomal pathway
  back to the Golgi complex. This process reroutes HIV-1 proteins to virus assembly
  sites at the PM. Rab11 controls the pathway that recycles Env from the cell surface
  to endosomes and back to the PM. Rab27a activity helps to target Gag to virus assembly
  sites at the PM. Moreover, Rab8 and Rab7L1 (Rab29) activity are exploited by HIV-1
  during trans-infection from dendritic cells (DCs) to target T cells via virological
  synapses (not shown). L.E., late endosomes; E.E., early endosomes; R.E., recycling
  endosomes. (C) Finally, ABCE1 facilitates Gag organization at the cell surface,
  where the ESCRT machinery and the AAA-ATPase VPS4 facilitate virus particle release.
  The red electric ray symbols represent critical steps in the transport of viral
  factors that require energy.
