caption: Dystroglycan (DG) is a key component of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein
  complex that provides mechanical support to the sarcolemma. β-Dystroglycan is the
  transmembrane subunit, and its extracellular domain noncovalently binds α-dystroglycan.
  Laminin is a major component of the basal laminae and a prominent protein in the
  endomysium. The binding of laminin to dystroglycan activates a growth factor receptor–bound
  protein 2–RAC1–PAK1–JNK (GRB2-RAC1-PAK1-JNK) pathway that promotes hypertrophy,
  an initial adaptive response to increased pressure. Decreased expression of laminin,
  as might occur during the transition to heart failure, might impair survival signaling
  to cardiomyocytes and predispose them to apoptosis, similar to the pathology in
  skeletal muscle dystrophies. Direct association between dystroglycan and MEK and
  between dystroglycan and ERK was recently demonstrated (). MEK-dystroglycan association
  was localized to membrane ruffles, while ERK-dystroglycan association was found
  in focal adhesions. It is not known how these interactions are regulated.
