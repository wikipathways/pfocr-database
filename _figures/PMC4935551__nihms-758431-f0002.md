caption: 'Left: CMA participates in the regulation of glycolysis by controlling levels
  of glycolytic enzymes and enzymes involved in the TCA cycle. Right: CMA modulates
  rates of lipid uptake and lipogenesis through the degradation of proteins involved
  in lipid binding and transport and enzymes of the triglyceride synthesis pathway.
  In addition, CMA determines rates of lipolysis through the selective removal of
  perilipins (PLIN), proteins that cover the surface of lipid droplets. Removal of
  perilipins is a pre-requisite to allow access to lipid droplets of cytosolic lipases
  and autophagy-related proteins (ATG) that initiate lipophagy.'
