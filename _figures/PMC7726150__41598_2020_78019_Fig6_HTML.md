caption: Model of how Lrp6-APEX2 may interact with the ESCRT machinery and TFG in
  multivesicular body formation during Wnt-induced endocytosis. The endocytosed Wnt
  receptor complex on the surface of multivesicular endosomes becomes clustered in
  clathrin-containing invaginations that give rise to the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs)
  of late endosomes. MVBs are the obligatory pathway through which plasma membrane
  proteins reach the lysosome. We found that most ESCRT GO components are brought
  into proximity of Lrp6-APEX2 5 min after treatment with Wnt3a conditioned medium.
  The top interactor with Lrp6-APEX2 after 20 min of Wnt3a was TFG, which we show
  here is required for Wnt signaling. TFG protein co-localizes with the ESCRT-0 protein
  Hrs/Hgs after Wnt stimulation. We did not detect interactions with intraluminal
  vesicle components such as CD63; a possible explanation is that the acidic medium
  or lysosomal proteases might interfere with APEX2 activity.
