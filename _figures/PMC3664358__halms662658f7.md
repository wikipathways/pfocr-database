caption: The final result of β1-adrenergic receptor stimulation and chronic/intermittent
  hypoxia is the activation of transcription factors (HIF, CREB, …) and CACNA1H gene
  expression that lead to Cav3.2 channel incorporation into the plasma membrane. The
  pathway driven by β1-adrenergic receptor stimulation (isoprenaline, forskolin, pCPT-cAMP)
  is derived from . The pathway induced by chronic/intermittent hypoxia (NOX, ROS,
  PLC, PKG, HIF) is taken from .
