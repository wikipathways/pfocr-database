caption: αMUPA mice show a life-long increase in leptin levels at baseline and twice
  elevated leptin levels post MI. Anti-leptin antibodies or inhibitors of leptin signaling
  through the leptin receptor OB-R (Wartmannin and AG-490) abrogated the αMUPA cardioprotection,
  suggesting the involvement of leptin, pSTAT3 and pAKT in the protective process.
  pSTAT3 and pAKT, both implicated in the inhibition of mPTP opening, could lead to
  cardioprotection by preserving the closed state of mPTP [,,]. Conversely, CR leads
  to a decrease in leptin but an increase in adiponectin levels and AMPK activation,
  a pathway involved in CR-induced cardioprotection []. Phosphorylated AMPK, as well
  as pAKT, can in turn activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and thus
  elevate the generation of nitric oxide (NO), another component implicated in the
  inhibition of mPTP opening [].
