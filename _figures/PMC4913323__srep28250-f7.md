caption: PI3K/Akt/mTOR has been considered as a central regulatory pathway of protein
  translation in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, migration
  and survival. During hormonal stimulation, the mTOR can be activated through phosphorylation
  by upstream pathways, such as PI3K and Akt. After BM-MSCs transplantation, MSCs
  secrete cytokines to activate PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and as downstream effective
  molecule, mTOR specifically phosphorylates ribosomal protein p70s6k, and then p70s6k
  promote myocardial glucose metabolism, protein synthesis and then to improve cardiac
  function.
