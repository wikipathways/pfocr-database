caption: The role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in cancer development and drug
  resistance. This figure elucidates the molecular components and mechanisms discussed
  in Part 2, focusing on the role of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in cancer
  development. A It provides an overview of how Wnt/β-catenin signaling facilitates
  tumorigenesis and malignant behaviors through various mechanisms. The dark red layer
  highlights specific mechanisms that drive tumor progression within each pathway.
  As indicated in the legend, molecules located on the outer layer with yellow or
  blue backgrounds represent upstream or downstream regulators of the pathway, respectively.
  Molecules that promote or inhibit Wnt signaling, or are upregulated/downregulated
  by activated Wnt signaling, are denoted in red and blue text. B This section illustrates
  the functional locus of molecules interacting with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling via
  different mechanisms, excluding those related to immunotherapy resistance. The left
  panel summarizes molecules with mechanisms that remain unclear within the pathway.
  The color coding for text and backgrounds is consistent with Panel A. C This panel
  delineates the mechanisms by which Wnt pathway-associated molecules contribute to
  immunotherapy resistance, maintaining the color schemes for text and backgrounds
  as established in Panel A
