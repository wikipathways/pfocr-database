caption: The red arrow shows the classical pathway of LPS-mediated activation of TLR4
  that further leads to pyroptosis and releases of IL-1β and IL-18. The green arrow
  shows the noncanonical pathway through which LPS directly activates caspase-4/5/11
  without TLR4. The blue arrow shows the negative feedback of pyroptosis on autophagy
  wherein caspase-1-mediated activation of caspase-3 leads to enhanced autophagy and
  inactivation of GSDMD. The brown arrow shows RAPA-mediated deactivation of the inhibitory
  effect of mTOR on Atg7 that causes Atg7 to activate caspase-3. We surmise that RAPA
  is also more destructive to GSDMD and inhibits pyroptosis.
