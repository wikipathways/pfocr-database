caption: A model of cytokinin responses in plant immunity and systems biology tools
  for the identification of cytokinin-linked immune regulators. (A) Model and hypothesis.
  Cytokinin promotes plant immunity against infection with some of the biotrophic
  (Hpa Noco2), necrotrophic (Alternaria), as well as hemi-biotrophic pathogens (boxes,
  arrows). The presence of cytokinin is perceived by membrane-spanning receptors AHKs
  (plasma membrane or ER membrane may house AHKs) and transmit the phosphorely signal
  to type-B ARRs via AHPs. Type-B ARR, ARR2 interacts with TGA transcription factors
  and promotes SA signaling for resistance against infection with Pst DC3000 (hemi-biotroph).
  type-A ARRs, which are negative regulators of cytokinin signaling, are transcriptionally
  activated by type-B ARRs. Deletion of type-A ARRs enhances cytokinin signaling and
  derepresses SA responses in promoting Arabidopsis immunity against infection with
  Hpa Noco2 (biotroph). Enhanced cytokinin levels and signaling also promotes Arabidopsis
  resistance to infection with Alternaria (necrotroph). The potential link between
  cytokinin and JA pathway is still unknown. The signal of cytokinin is fortified
  through enhanced endogenous production by overexpressing IPT enzyme gene or by external
  application of cytokinin. Also, deletion of type-A ARRs relives its inhibition to
  cytokinin signaling. The impact of exogenous application of cytokinin and deletion
  of type-A ARRs on plant immune defense is further analyzed by adopting systems biology
  approaches. (B) Methodology to address hypothesis. Transcriptome data on the exogenous
  application of trans-Zeatin and type-A ARRs sextuplet mutants are collected from
  GEO and studies of Argueso et al., respectively (green files). High-confidence (edge
  score < 0.9) PPI from the STRING database are mapped and visualized with Cytoscape.
  DEGs from transcriptomes and their corresponding proteins in interactome are identified
  as intersecting coverage between the two levels of omics data (transcriptome × interactome).
  Intersected nodes (green dots) are subjected to functional enrichment analysis by
  using Cytoscape plugin BiNGO. Proteins of the network relevant to plant immune defense
  processes (red dots) are considered as immune nodes of the network. Immune networks
  are composed of immune-enriched nodes (red dots) as well as their interactors (black
  dots) from the basal interactome. Taking the degree of connectivity and neighborhood
  (network analysis) as well as biological relevance to immune defense as parameters,
  we then looked for regulatory hubs mediated by cytokinin signaling in Arabidopsis.
