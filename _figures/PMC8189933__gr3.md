caption: VEGF-A signalling in PLD-ADPKD (working model).In PC2-defective cholangiocytes,
  stimulation of cAMP production drives the PKA-dependent activation of ERK1/ERK2
  and the secretion of VEGF-A (1). In turn, cAMP activates the PKA–Ras–Raf–ERK pathway
  and stimulates VEGF-A production through an mTOR–HIF1α-mediated mechanism (2). mTOR
  has a central role in IGF-1-stimulated proliferation of cystic cholangiocytes. IGF-1,
  a growth factor secreted by the cystic epithelium and by stressed biliary epithelial
  cells, binds to its receptor IGF1-R and activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway; thus,
  mTOR stimulates proliferation through a HIF1-α/VEGF-dependent autocrine loop (3).
  Furthermore, VEGF-A produced by cystic cholangiocytes increases, through a paracrine
  route, the periductal microvascular density and bile ducts proliferation by binding
  to VEGFR-2. ADPKD, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; HIF1α, hypoxia-inducible
  factor type 1α; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; IGF1-R, insulin-like growth
  factor 1 receptor; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PC2, polycystin-2; PLD,
  polycystic liver disease; VEGF-A, vascular endothelial growth factor type A; VEGFR-2,
  vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2.
