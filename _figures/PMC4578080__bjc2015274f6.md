caption: Schematic representation of a neurotrophin axis in the biology of DLBCL cells.
  Neurotrophins (NT) are produced as pro-neurotrophins (pro-NT) and secreted by tumour
  B cells. Enzymatic cleavage leads to the release of mature NTs in cell microenvironment
  that realise autocrine/paracrine loops of regulation. In ABC phenotype, activation
  of the NF-κB pathway enhances the production of NGF. NT signalling (i.e., BDNF/TrkB145)
  potentiates cell survival pathways and VEGF secretion that are already dependent
  of constitutively activated pathways in DLBCL cells (PI3K/Akt, MAPK and for ABC
  subtype the NF-κB pathway). This effect could lead to enhanced resistance to treatment.
  p75NTR receptor should be involved in cell survival by its interaction with Trk
  receptor (i.e., full-length TrkB145 or truncated TrkB95) rather than in apoptosis
  by its sortilin association. Anti-CD20 therapy (i.e., rituximab) inhibits also the
  constitutively activated survival pathways (like PI3K-Akt) in B tumour cells leading
  in chemosensitisation to drug-induced apoptosis. Thus Trk pharmacological inhibition
  (i.e., K252a) can contribute to enhance cell sensitivity to rituximab therapy, notably
  for relative resistant phenotypes as ABC subtype of DLBCL. The full colour version
  of this figure is available at British Journal of Cancer online.
