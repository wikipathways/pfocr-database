caption: Effects of endoplasmic reticulum stress on antigen–MHC‐I complex and natural
  killer cells. (A) Tumor cells generate several tumor antigens by the proteolytic
  degradation of proteins. Tumor antigens translocate into the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) through antigen processing‐associated transporters (TAP) and connect with major
  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. During ER stress, protein kinase
  R‐like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) triggers the downstream eIF2α–ATF4–CHOP
  signaling cascade and diminishes the expression of MHC‐I on the cell surface. The
  phosphorylation of eIF2α results in a reduction in protein translation, thereby
  impacting the quantity of antigenic peptides. As a result, there is a decreased
  amount of antigenic peptides binding to MHC‐I in the endoplasmic reticulum, affecting
  their location within the ER. Both inositol‐requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α) and
  activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) can enhance the expression of X‐box binding
  protein 1 (XBP1), consequently elevating miR‐346 expression levels. The direct targeting
  of TAP by miR‐346 leads to a reduction in its expression, thereby diminishing the
  transfer of antigenic peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum and their binding to
  MHC‐I. (B) The IRE1α–XBP1 pathway dampens the expression of MICA and E2F1, which
  serves as a regulator of MICA promoters. Moreover, the loss of E2F1 binding site
  in MICA resulted in the loss of sensitivity to ER stress. In contrast, the PERK–ATF4–CHOP
  signaling pathway elevates MICA levels
