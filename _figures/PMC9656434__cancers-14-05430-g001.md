caption: KRAS activation and its downstream pathway. KRAS proteins are key elements
  in transducing extracellular signaling to downstream pathways. Intracellular KRAS
  proteins may present in two functional forms, KRAS-GTP and KRAS-GDP, which correspond
  to their active and inactive state, respectively. Transition from the KRAS-GDP to
  KRAS-GTP binding state is usually mediated by GEFs proteins and occurs via other
  adaptor and recruiter proteins, such as Grb2 and SHP-2. Conversely, transition from
  KRAS-GDP to KRAS-GTP usually requires GAPs proteins. Downstream signaling of KRAS
  normally includes RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3K/AKT and RAL pathways, implied in the regulation
  of cellular proliferation, migration, and death.
