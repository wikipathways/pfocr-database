caption: '(A) Schematic representation of the NLRP3 pathway: After activation of Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) 4 by High-Mobility-Group-Protein (HMG) B1, nuclear factor ’kappa-light-chain-enhancer’
  of activated B-cells (NFKB) 2 is activated and translocates to the nucleus. Here,
  it enhances transcription of NOD-like receptor protein (Nlrp) 3 and Interleukins.
  Subsequently, NLRP3, Apoptosis-like-speck protein (ASC) and an inactive precursor
  of cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific Protease (CASP) 1 assemble to form the
  NLRP3 inflammasome. Upon activation of the inflammasome, pro-CASP1 is cleaved and
  activated, which then leads to cleavage of interleukin (IL) 1B and 18, as well as
  proinflammatory cell death. (B) Relative mRNA levels (ΔΔCt method) of inflammasomal
  associated genes are analysed 72 h (n ≥ 5), 10 d (n ≥ 5) and 28 d (n ≥ 6) after
  pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE Pilo) as well as (C) 72 h (n ≥ 4), 5
  d (n ≥ 5), 10 d (n ≥ 4) and 28 d (n ≥ 6) after kainic acid-induced SE in hippocampal
  CA1 (SE KA) compared to non-SE controls (Ctr Pilo/Ctr KA). Relative mRNA levels
  of NOD-like receptor protein (Nlrp) 3 and other inflammasomal associated genes such
  as Asc, Casp1, Tlr4, and Nfkb2 are quantified with ΔΔCt method normalized to the
  ubiquitously expressed (encoding proteins that are required for all cell types)
  housekeeping gene β-actin after SE. Data is shown as mean ± SD and analysed with
  2way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s post hoc test. Asterisks indicate significant differences
  between groups (control vs. SE): *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
  Detailed statistical values are found in .'
