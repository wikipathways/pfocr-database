caption: (A) Under physiological or homeostatic conditions, neurons can produce and
  release soluble factors such as CX3C chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1, also named fractalkine),
  colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which
  bind to their receptors on microglia to maintain their functional state (e.g., ramified
  phenotype). In particular, ATP released from neurons guides movement of microglial
  processes by binding to microglial P2RY12 (purinergic receptor P2Y, G-protein coupled,
  12). Further, microglia have been suggested to involve synaptogenesis through microglia-derived
  BDNF. In these steady-state conditions, there are low levels of circulating monocytes
  patrolling for infection or tissue damage in the vasculature. (B) Under pathological
  conditions and chronic stress, microglia alter their morphology with increased cell
  body size and thickened processes. In this state, CX3CL1 from neurons can regulate
  microglia activation by binding to its receptor CX3CR1 on microglia. In contrast,
  elevated levels of CSF1, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) in the pathological conditions such as stress exposure has been implicated
  in neuronal plasticity and psychiatric disorders. Notably, DAMP-associated pathways
  (e.g., HMGB1-RAGE, ATP-P2X7R signaling) trigger a critical convergent molecular
  pathway, termed the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome.
  Finally, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia results in the production
  and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β. In response to chronic
  stress, monocytes can be released into circulate and traffic to the brain. The peripheral
  monocytes in the brain converge with activated microglia to amplify inflammatory
  signaling. Increased peripheral cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) also can penetrate
  into the brain via passive or active mechanisms and activate microglial stress responses.
