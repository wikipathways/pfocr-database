caption: Biosynthesis pathway of HBGAs. HBGAs are synthesized by sequential addition
  of a monosaccharide to the terminal disaccharide of a precursor glycan. The synthesis
  pathways with type 1 and 2 precursors are considered here. Glycosidic linkages are
  separated by a forward slash to specify the pathway for different chains. The FUT2
  and FUT3 fucosyltransferases drive the biosynthesis of secretor (Se) and Lewis (Le)
  antigens respectively by catalyzing the linkage-specific addition of α-fucose residues.
  Enzymes A and B catalyze the linkage-specific addition of N-acetylgalactosamine
  and galactose, respectively. Additions of glycans by enzymes A, B and FUT2 to the
  galactose residue of the precursor result in ABH HBGAs. Addition of α-fucose to
  the N-acetylglucosamine residue by FUT3 enzyme yields Lewis antigens (Lewis a/x,
  Lewis b/y, A Lewis b/y, B Lewis b/y).
