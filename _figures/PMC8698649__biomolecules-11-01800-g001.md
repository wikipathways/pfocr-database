caption: 'The biosynthetic pathway and roles of brassinosteroids (BRs) in the growth,
  development, and stress response of plants. The campestanol (CN)-dependent pathway:
  In the early C-6 oxidation pathway, CN is converted to 6-oxocampestanol (6-oxoCN),
  and 6-oxoCN is then converted to castasterone (CS). Additionally, in the late C-6
  oxidation pathway, CN is converted to 6-deoxocastasterone (6-deoxoCS), which is
  converted to CS. The CN-independent pathway: 22-hydroxycampest-3-one (22-OH-3-one)
  is converted to 6-deoxo-3-dehydroteasterone (6-ddeoxo3DT) and 3-epi-6-deoxocastasterone
  (3-epi-6-deoxoCT) on different branches, and they are converted to 6-deoxotyphasterol
  (6-deoxoTY). The final synthesis product of different pathways is BL. BRs regulate
  plant growth and development by promoting seed germination, root growth, and fruit
  ripening, extending postharvest, and maintaining storage quality. Additionally,
  BRs are able to respond to different types of stress: alleviating the toxicity of
  Cr, overcoming salt damage, improving drought tolerance, enhancing cold tolerance,
  and reducing the toxicity of Cu.'
