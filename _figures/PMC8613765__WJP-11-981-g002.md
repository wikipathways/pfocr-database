caption: 'Putative signaling pathways implicated in the rapid-acting antidepressant-like
  effects of agmatine. A: The antidepressant-like effect elicited by the acute administration
  of agmatine in the tail suspension test appears to involve inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartic
  acid (NMDA) receptors since it enhanced the antidepressant potency of MK-801 (an
  NMDA receptor antagonist) by up to 100-fold[60]. Moreover, agmatine''s antidepressant-like
  effect in the tail suspension test is dependent on the activation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-5-4-isoxazole
  propionic acid (AMPA) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors since the
  administration of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX; an AMPA receptor antagonist)
  or K-252a (a TrkB receptor antagonist) completely abolished its antidepressant-like
  response. The antibody anti-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) also abolished
  the antidepressant-like effect elicited by agmatine in the tail suspension test[].
  Of note, the antidepressant-like effect of agmatine is also dependent on phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/ glycogen synthase kinase-3β/mechanistic
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In particular, the administration of LY294002
  (a PI3K inhibitor) or rapamycin (a selective mTOR inhibitor) completely abrogated
  the behavioral responses of agmatine in the tail suspension test. The combined treatment
  with a sub-effective dose of agmatine and lithium chloride (10 mg/kg, po; a non-selective
  GSK-3β inhibitor) or AR-A014418 (a selective GSK-3β inhibitor) produced an antidepressant-like
  effect in the tail suspension test[]. Importantly, these behavioral responses were
  accompanied by an increase in the BDNF, glutamate AMPA receptor subunit 1 and postsynaptic
  density protein-95 kDa immunocontent in the prefrontal cortex of the mice[]; B:
  Reinforcing the notion that ketamine and agmatine share common behavioral responses
  and molecular targets, the ability of agmatine to potentiate the antidepressant
  and synaptic actions of ketamine was also demonstrated[]. In particular, the combined
  administration of subthreshold doses of agmatine and ketamine produced a fast (starting
  in 1 h) and sustained (lasting up to 7 d) antidepressant-like effect in the tail
  suspension test. These behavioral responses were associated with stimulation of
  the Akt/70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase signaling pathway and increased synaptic
  protein synthesis in the prefrontal cortex in a time-dependent manner. More importantly,
  the combined administration of sub-effective doses of agmatine and ketamine raised
  the dendritic arbor and spine densities and effectively remodeled the dendritic
  spinal architecture in the prefrontal cortex[]. NMDA: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid;
  AMPA: Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-5-4-isoxazole propionic acid; BDNF: Brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor; VDCC: Voltage-dependent calcium channels; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; Akt: Protein kinase B; TrkB: Tropomyosin receptor kinase B; GluA1: Glutamate
