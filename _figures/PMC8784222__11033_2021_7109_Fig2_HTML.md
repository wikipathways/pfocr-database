caption: A The ACE2/ Ang-(1–7)/MasR axis improves insulin sensitivity via activation
  of the Akt/PI3K/IRS1/JNK pathway. Ang II-induced AT1R activation disrupts insulin-stimulated
  IRS-1/IRS-2-associated PI3-kinase pathway activities through p38 MAPK, thereby impairing
  GLUT-4 translocation into membrane of insulin-sensitive tissues. Increased activity
  of AT1R also has inhibitory effects on insulin receptor signaling and PPARɣ expression
  through the activation of p38MAPK. B CD36 orchestrates an intracellular metabolic
  cascade which is involved in metabolism of lipids, leading to overexpression of
  inflammatory enzymes which inhibit intracellular signaling of insulin receptor.
  CD36 also induces overexpression of inflammatory cytokines and DPP4 through interaction
  with TLR2/4. Inflammatory cytokines such as NF-κB, TNF-α, IL6, IL12 have inhibitory
  effects on insulin signaling. DPP4 inactivates GLP-1/GIP, resulting to disruption
  of glucose metabolism
