caption: Diagram of bioenergetics pathways in sperm. A) Mouse sperm was stained with
  anti-tubulin antibody (red), MitoTracker and peanut agglutinin (PNA) (green), and
  Hoechst (blue). Because of the strong MitoTracker signal in the midpiece, the tubulin
  was only observed in the principal piece. Original magnification ×60. B) Glycolysis.
  It is well established that all the enzymes for this process are found in the sperm
  principal piece. Interestingly, most of the steps in this process are catalyzed
  by sperm-specific isoforms of the respective proteins. During glycolysis, glucose
  is oxidized to pyruvate with a final net gain of 2 ATP and 1 e− in the form of NADH.
  Fructose enters the glycolytic pathway after phosphorylation by hexokinase (HK)
  or, alternatively, through the Hers pathway initiated by fructokinase. Alpha-chlorohydrin
  has been shown to block sperm glycolysis []. The final product of glycolysis is
  pyruvate, which is used to regenerate NAD+ from NADH in a coupled reaction in which
  this metabolite is converted into lactate by LDH. The NAD+ regeneration is essential
  for continuing glycolysis. Note that in the upper section of A, the alternative
  use of glucose by the first enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway is presented.
  Glucose is oxidized to 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone with reduction of NADP+ to NADPH.
  In turn, NADPH can be used by glutathionereductase (GluR) to form GSH, and in the
  presence of glutathione peroxidase, GSH can reduce H2O2 and block oxidative damage
  of lipids, DNA, and proteins. C) Citric acid cycle. Pyruvate can enter the mitochondria
  through specific transporters. Once in the mitochondria, it can be oxidized to acetyl-coenzyme
  A (CoA) and CO2. Acetyl-CoA then enters the citric acid cycle, which generates one
  high-energy bond in the form of GTP, four reduced compounds (3 NADH and 1 FADH2),
  to be used in the oxidative phosphorylation process taking place also in the mitochondria.
  The ketone body hydroxybutyrate can originate two acetyl-CoA molecules through a
  series of intermediate reactions. Regarding citrate, when it is obtained from oxaloacetate
  inside the mitochondria as part of the citric acid cycle, exogenous citrate (in
  green) cannot permeate the inner mitochondrial membrane. Thus, before entering the
  cycle, it should be first converted to malate and to pyruvate by a series of enzymes
  with the use of ATP. In addition, citrate is an allosteric inhibitor of glycolysis
  at the level of PFK enzyme (see A). The electrons conserved in NADH and FADH2 are
  then used to reduce oxygen in the oxidative phosphorylation process. D) Oxidative
  phosphorylation. Through a series of redox reactions catalyzed by protein complexes
  (I–IV), NADH is used to donate electrons to oxygen. For each pair of electrons transferred
  to O2, 10 H+ are pumped out through the inner mitochondrial membrane. The H+ gradient
  formed favors reuptake of H+ through the ATP synthase complex, which uses the proton-motive
  energy to generate ATP. Certain conditions and reagents can uncouple oxygen reduction
  from ATP synthesis. For example, the electron gradient can be dissipated through
  UCPs, as in brown adipose tissue. Also, weak acids such as CCCP can readily enter
  the inner mitochondrial membrane in the protonated form and collapse the H+ gradient
  blocking the production of ATP. For more information on the pathways, see Nelson
  and Cox []. α-chl, α-chlorohydrin; ALDO, aldolase; ATPSyn, ATP synthase; ENO, enolase;
