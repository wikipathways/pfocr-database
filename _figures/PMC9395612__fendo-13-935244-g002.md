caption: Possible exosome-mediated signaling pathways in DR. Exosomes are synthesized
  in various cells. Under physiological or pathological conditions, their carriers
  may change and participate in the formation of the collective pathological state.
  They may activate TGF-β, the signaling pathway that mediates the hemodynamics of
  individuals with PDR. By blocking TGF-β, the activation of the signaling pathway
  promotes cell proliferation and reduces apoptosis and the inflammatory response.
  Exosomes (such as miR-141-3p) may also inhibit retinal neovascularization by preventing
  the activation of the p38/MAPK signaling pathway. Exosomes can also be detected
  by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which can induce vascular endothelial cell proliferation
  while preventing cell apoptosis, as well as cell proliferation and migration of
  the retinal pigment epithelium cell. The stimulation of the signaling system may
  also aid in the reduction of HG-induced cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.
  In diabetic rats, the activity of the NF-κB signaling pathway rose dramatically,
  and inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway can reduce inflammation, apoptosis, and
  oxidative stress.
