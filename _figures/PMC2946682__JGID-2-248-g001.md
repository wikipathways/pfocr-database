caption: The immunology of resolving infection and disease progression to Leishmania
  For both T helper 1 (TH1)- and TH2-cell differentiations, antigens are presented
  to naive CD4+ T cells by dendritic cells (DCs). The interaction of co-stimulatory
  molecules with their respective ligands, together with the local cytokine environment,
  promotes the differentiation of naive T cells into interferon- γ (IFN-γ)-secreting
  TH1 cells or interleukin-4 (IL-4)-secreting TH2 cells. In TH1-cell development,
  certain pathogens or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) trigger antigen-presenting
  cells, through toll-like receptors (TLRs), to secrete IL-12, which promotes the
  differentiation of naive T cells into IFN-γ-secreting TH1 cells. In TH2-cell development,
  the inability of antigen to activate DCs to produce IL-12 results in a default pathway
  of naive T-cell differentiation into IL-4-secreting TH2 cells
