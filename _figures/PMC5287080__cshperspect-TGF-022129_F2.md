caption: Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-induced activation of c-Jun amino terminal
  kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and the
  IκB kinase (IKK) pathway. Ligand-bound TGF-β receptors interact with TRAF6 and TGF-β-activated
  kinase 1 (TAK1), and induce Lys63-linked polyubiquitylation of TRAF6, which then
  activates TAK1 and downstream kinases, such as JNK, p38 MAPK, and IKK. Smad6 inhibits
  the TGF-β-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation by recruiting a deubiquitylase A20
  to deubiquitylate TRAF6, whereas Smad7 promotes TGF-β-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation
  by directing the TGF-β receptors to caveolin-1-containing lipid rafts through interaction
  with Smurf2. Activated JNK and p38 MAPK then phosphorylate their targeted transcription
  factors, and IKK phosphorylates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and these transcription
  factors cooperate with activated Smads to regulate apoptosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT). In addition, JNK directly phosphorylates receptor-activated Smad
  (R-Smad) to regulate Smad activity. TRAF6 can also stimulate proteolytic cleavage
  of TβRI dependent on presenillin 1 and Lys63 ubiquitylation of TRAF6 to generate
  the intracellular domain (ICD) of TβRI, which then translocates into the nucleus
  to regulate cell invasion. SARA, Smad anchor for receptor activation; MKK, MAP kinase
  kinase; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6.
