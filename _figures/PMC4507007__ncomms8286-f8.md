caption: (a) Stages of tubule development and lumen formation in the presence or absence
  of DOCK4. Dynamic remodelling via lateral filopodia and protrusions leads to formation
  of lumens lined by apposing endothelial cells. In the absence of DOCK4, lack of
  dynamic protrusive activity and dynamic remodelling leads to thin tubules lacking
  lateral cell–cell contacts which do not form a lumen. (b) Signalling downstream
  of VEGF activates the SGEF→RhoG→DOCK4→Rac1→DOCK9→Cdc42 signalling pathway and promotes
  interaction of Rac GEF DOCK4 with Cdc42 DOCK9.
