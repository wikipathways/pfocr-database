caption: Knowledge-based pathway analysis (Genomatix BiblioSphere Software) indicating
  the network of high BMI-associated genes. The displayed network is constructed from
  53 input genes. Connection lines are drawn as a result of co-citation of two genes
  within one sentence. Green or partially green connection lines indicate a transcription
  factor matrix match in the promoter of the gene connected by the green line. Orange
  or yellow indicates up-regulated, shades of blue mark down-regulated genes in the
  T/N data sets. Major biochemical pathways are highlighted with pink color.
