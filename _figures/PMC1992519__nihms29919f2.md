caption: The figure depicts several types of signaling thought to occur from endosomes,
  as discussed in the text. Distinct systems are superimposed on the minimum number
  of endosomal compartments consistent with the presently available data. The figure
  is an amalgam of data from a number of systems and cell types; thus, only a subset
  of the indicated signaling events would be expected to occur in any particular cell
  type. Ligand-induced dimerization of EGF (EGFR) Trk, TGFβ (TGFβR)and Notch is not
  shown to reduce complexity of the figure. I, internalization; R, recycling; D, degradation;
  EE, early endosomes; SE/LE, sorting/late endosomes. Endocytic and signaling pathways
  are shown as broken and solid lines, respectively.
