caption: Schematic representation of the key regulation of the mTOR pathway in ESCs
  during the transition from the naive state to the primed state and vice versa. A
  high level of autophagy in naive ESCs is maintained by two linked transcriptional
  modules FOXOs and TFEB/TFE3, which are under the control of AMPK kinase. The mTOR
  pathway is downregulated and does not interfere with TFEB/TFE3 nuclear localization.
  Activated FLCN pathway disintegrates AMPK-dependent regulation of autophagy and,
  as a GTPase activating protein, it recruits mTORC1 and TFEB/TFE3 to lysosomes where
  mTORC1 inhibits the latter. mTORC1 is activated on lysosomes by Rag and Rheb GTPases
  and triggers anabolic processes.
