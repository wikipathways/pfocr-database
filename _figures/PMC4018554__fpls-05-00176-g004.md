caption: Agrobacterium tumefaciens generates and maintains multiple developmental
  asymmetries. (A) Shown are morphological features of A. tumefaciens known to localize
  primarily to one pole of the bacterium, including multiple flagella, the unipolar
  polysaccharide (UPP), Vir pilus and type IV secretion system (T4SS). (B) Cell division
  in A. tumefaciens occurs by a polar budding mechanism. The cell division protein
  FtsZ (green) appears at the site of early constriction, from which the daughter
  cell buds and at which cytokinesis occurs. The rate of budding indicated is for
  growth in defined medium (ATGN) on agar pads. (C) The coordination of division and
  development (CDD) regulatory pathway. Proteins for which genetic and/or phenotypic
  data confirm the suggested pathway architecture are in bold typeface. Italicized
  proteins are present in the A. tumefaciens genome but do not have experimental support;
  placement of these proteins in the pathway is based on data from other model systems.
  Histidine kinases are colored orange, response regulators are colored blue, and
  a single Hpt phosphotransferase (ChpT) is in black text. The location of PdhS1 and
  PdhS2 is suggested by current data, but not confirmed. Note that the bacterial cell
  envelope in all panels is depicted as described in Figure .
