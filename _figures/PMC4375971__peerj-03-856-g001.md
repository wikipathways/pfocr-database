caption: Leptin secreted from adipose tissue binds to the leptin receptor in the hypothalamus.
  Leptin binding inhibits the neuropeptide Y/agouti-related protein (NPY/AgRP) production
  and stimulates pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) production, which undergoes post-translational
  modifications to produce peptides such alpha and beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone
  (α and βMSH) via the processing of prohormone convertase 1(PC1/3) and carboxypeptidase
  E (CPE) enzymes. Alpha and βMSH bind to melanocortin 3 and melanocortin 4 receptors
  (MC3R and MC4R) and induce their activity. Melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein
  2 (MRAP2) can reduce the responsiveness of both MC3R and MC4R to α and βMSH and
  result in obesity. On the other hand, Single-minded 1 (SIM1) acts as a facilitator
  of MC4R activity. Increase in the MC3R and MC4R activities result in a decrease
  in food intake and increase in energy expenditure. MC4R activity also stimulates
  release of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which will bind to the neurotrophin
  receptor (TrkB) and influence food intake and energy expenditure. Aside from activation
  of the POMC, leptin binding to its receptor also activates the Janus kinase/signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. This pathway, through
  the help of Src homology 2 B adapter protein 1 (SH2B1), results in activation of
  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). STAT3 will then migrate
  to the nucleus with the help of Tubby bipartite transcription factor (TUB) and activate
  its target genes related to energy homeostasis and mediate in the anorexigenic effects
  of leptin.
