caption: Schematic diagram of this study. Ephrin B2 expression was up-regulated after
  high glucose treatment. High glucose-induced Ephrin B2 signaling triggered EndMT
  and endothelial damage, which mediated by the downstream FAK pathway. EndMT, endothelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition; FAK, focal adhesion kinase.
