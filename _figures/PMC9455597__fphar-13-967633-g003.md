caption: Partial mechanisms of PARP inhibitor resistance in cancer. (A) PARG deletion
  leads to PARPI resistance. (B) Loss of SLFN11 enhances DSB repair capacity, ultimately
  leading to PARPi resistance. (C) The ATR/CHK/WEE1 signaling pathway arrests the
  cell cycle to reduce replication stress and promote DSB repair. (D) HR-deficient
  cells rely on MMEJ for DSB repair, which is mediated by POLθ. Inhibition of POLθ
  in HR-deficient cells results in cell death.
