caption: Top two networks (A and B) identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis as overrepresented
  within the list of 245 genes (P < 0.005) dysregulated in human IAPP transgenic (HIP)
  vs. wild-type (WT) rats. Symbols in shades of green or red denote up- and downregulated
  transcripts, respectively. Symbols in gray are not significantly differentially
  expressed in this data set, but known to be part of the pathway or network. Solid
  lines denote direct interaction and dotted lines indirect interaction, such as an
  alteration in expression levels, or posttranslational modification.
