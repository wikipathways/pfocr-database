caption: Multiple somatic alterations in components within the same pathways. a Multiple
  somatic alterations within the APC pathway observed in a colorectal cancer. A schematic
  of the signaling pathways converging on growth control of colorectal cancer patient
  P0027 is displayed where mutation and predicted loss of function of tumor suppressors
  is depicted in red. Several components excluding APC are mutated in the canonical
  WNT signaling pathway. b Identification of an oncogenic driver in a breast cancer.
  A schematic of the signaling pathways converging on growth control of breast cancer
  patient P0040 is displayed where mutation and predicted loss of function of tumor
  suppressors is depicted in red and activation of oncogenes is depicted in green.
  Amplification and overexpression of CCND1 is identified through the integrative
  approach utilized in this study. c An integrative approach identifies the PI3K pathway
  as potential drug target in a squamous cell carcinoma. A schematic of the signaling
  pathways converging on growth control of skin squamous cell carcinoma patient P0011
  is displayed where mutation and predicted loss of function of tumor suppressors
  is depicted in red and activation of oncogenes is depicted in green. Multiple tumor
  suppressors in the PI3K-AKT pathway have mutations that predict loss of function
  (INPP5D and INPPL1). Additionally, PI3K is mutated, suggesting PI3K-AKT pathway
  as a possible drug target
