caption: (A) Hedgehog signalling mechanisms in onset of basal cell carcinoma. a) In
  the absence of SHH ligand, HH signalling is inactive and receptor patched 1 inhibit
  SMO action that allow SUFO to hold GLI1 in cytoplasm and prevents its signalling
  for the transcription GLI target proteins. b) Binding of SHH ligand activates the
  SMO that activates the SMO and allows SUFO to release the GLi1 for its action in
  nucleus. c) Any functional mutation in pathed1 (red cross) or activating mutation
  in (green cross) initiate HH pathway in the absence of ligand that leads to tumor
  formation. (B) Key signalling pathways involved in squamous cell carcinogenesis
  followed by UVB exposure-mutations. Block arrows are indication of activation of
  protein while red T-bars shows inhibitory relationship.
