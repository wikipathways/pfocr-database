caption: Aerobic plasmalogen biosynthesis pathway in mammals. Synthesis of the major
  ethanolamine form of the plasmalogen (PlsEtn) begins in the peroxisomes and ends
  in the ER, followed by transport to post-Golgi compartments. The substrate and product
  (black boldface), abbreviated enzyme names (blue boldface; see text for full names
  and Enzyme Comission numbers), the organelle where each step takes place, and feedback
  regulation of FAR1 by plasmalogens (red blunt ended arrow) are shown.
