caption: Diagram depicting the main proposed events in the autophagy pathway. (A)
  Initiation of autophagy. Autophagy is initiated by protein kinases and developmental
  and environmental signals. Autophagy induction and nucleation involve the autophagy-related
  gene 1 (ATG1) complex that is negatively controlled by target of rapamycin (TOR)
  kinase and activated by sucrose nonfermenting-1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1)
  kinase. (B) Regulation of autophagy in autophagosome expansion and maturation. Multiple
  regulatory mechanisms are involved in autophagy processes, including phytohormones,
  secondary messengers, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulators. (C) Crosstalk
  between autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPS). Ubiquitinated substrates
  are precisely identified and degraded by the UPS and autophagy pathways, respectively.
