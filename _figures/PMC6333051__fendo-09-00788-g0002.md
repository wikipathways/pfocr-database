caption: 'IL-6 signaling in the tumor cell of the bone marrow niche. The bone marrow
  microenvironment augments MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways resulting in anti-apoptotic
  and NF-κB signaling in multiple myeloma cells. Binding of IL-6 to IL-6R and Gp-130
  co-receptors induces JAK-2 signaling. This signaling cascade diverges down STAT3/PI3K/Akt
  pathways and various MAPK pathways, including MEK/ERK. The former is associated
  with promoting anti-apoptotic proteins: MCL1, BCL-XL, BCL-2 and c-Myc, which contribute
  to drug resistance. STAT3/PI3K/Akt can also promote NF-κB signaling which results
  in release of angiogenic and inflammatory molecules, such as IL-6. This can feed
  into an autocrine positive feedback loop. IκBα can inhibit NFκB through coupling
  and this interaction can be maintained by certan signals, such as by estradiol.
  The IL-6 signaling pathway in MM cells is similar to that of bone marrow stromal
  cells and overall it promotes an inflammatory microenvironment in the bone which
  results in bone loss, increased tumor burden and disease progression. Bone marrow
  adipocytes (BMAs) are one cell within the bone microoenvironment thought to feed
  into this system through secretion of IL-6. This can promote anti-apoptosis and
  disease progrssion through NF-κB signaling. BMAs, thus, represent an ideal target
  for MM therapies in order to reduce drug resistance and relapse, instead of targeting
  the complicated, clonally expanding plasma cell.'
