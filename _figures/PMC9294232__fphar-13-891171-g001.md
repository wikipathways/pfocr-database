caption: Schematic of the main anticancer molecular mechanisms of Ganoderma polysaccharides.
  Ganoderma polysaccharides retard cell cycle progression by targeting the PRMT6/p21/CDK2
  signaling pathway. Ganoderma polysaccharides inhibit cancer cell proliferation by
  suppressing the TGF-β/SMAD2 signaling cascade or downregulating PCNA and Ki67. Ganoderma
  polysaccharides exert pro-apoptotic actions through modulation of several signal
  transduction cascades, including the JNK, p38 and JAK/STAT5 signaling pathways.
  Moreover, they can aggrandize cellular apoptotic response by altering the expression
  of apoptosis-relevant proteins, such as Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP.
  Ganoderma polysaccharides impede the EMT program in cancer cells by inactivating
  the ERK signaling pathway. Intriguingly, Ganoderma polysaccharides interfere with
  the DNA damage repair response via restricting the activities of DNA-PK and ATM
  through suppression of the upstream PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. Ganoderma polysaccharides
  increase the expression of Beclin-1 and LC3 to initiate early autophagic flux, which
  subsequently facilitates cancer cell apoptosis. In addition, Ganoderma polysaccharides
  augment the pro-apoptotic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs and lower the expression
  of the drug efflux pump ABCB1, which reinforce the anticancer efficacy of chemotherapeutic
  drugs. PRMT6, protein arginine methyltransferase 6; CDK2, cyclin-dependent kinase
