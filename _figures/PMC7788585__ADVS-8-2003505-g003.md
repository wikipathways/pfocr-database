caption: 'Uptake and fate of EVs. EVs can trigger intracellular signaling of recipient
  cells via ligand‐receptor interaction, such as antigen presentation, immune modulation
  and morphogen signaling. Alternatively, exogenous EVs can transfer their cargos
  into recipient cells by entering the cells. EVs can be internalized into recipient
  cells by different mechanisms, including membrane fusion and various endocytic pathways
  (e.g., receptor‐mediated endocytosis, caveolin‐mediated endocytosis, lipid raft‐mediated
  endocytosis, phagocytosis and macropinocytosis). The fusion of EVs with the plasma
  membrane can release their contents into the cytoplasm of recipient cells, while
  the endocytosed EVs reach MVBs via the canonical endosomal pathway. These internalized
  EVs might be degraded after the fusion of MVBs with lysosomes or be secreted from
  recipient cells mixed with endogenous ILVs (not shown). Also, they might back‐fuse
  with the limiting membrane of MVBs, leading to the release of the EV cargos into
  the cytoplasm, a process that is poorly understood. Abbreviations: EV, extracellular
  vesicle; MVB, multivesicular body; ILV, intraluminal vesicle; TCR, T‐cell receptor;
  MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PD1, programmed cell death protein 1; PD‐L1,
  programmed death‐ligand 1; Fz, Frizzled receptor.'
