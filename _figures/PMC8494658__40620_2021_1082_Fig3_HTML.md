caption: Vitamin D metabolism [, ]. Vitamin D3 is generated in the skin under the
  influence of UV-B radiation, vitamin D2 and D3 are obtained from dietary sources
  by absorption through the intestine. In the liver, circulating vitamin D is converted
  to 25(OH)D by 25-hydroxylase (CYP2RI, CYP27A1). 25(OH)D is then converted to the
  active vitamin D metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D in the kidney and in extra-renal locations
  such as the parathyroid gland by the enzyme 1-α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1). 1-α-hydroxylase
  is regulated by several negative feedback mechanisms, including PTH, calcitonin,
  and FGF-23. Active vitamin D can be deactivated by 24-hydroxylase. The activity
  of 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) to degrade 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D is governed by these
  negative feedback loops, and is a key determinant of the net amount of active vitamin
  D. Blue boxes represent where the therapeutic forms of vitamin D enter the metabolic
  pathway
