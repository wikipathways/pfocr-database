caption: 'The glutamate burst hypothesis: a proposed mechanism of action for ketamine.
  The upper panel shows a glutamatergic synapse tonically inhibited by a GABAergic
  interneuron with decreased spine density and altered glutamatergic transmission
  due to stress and depression. The lower panel delineates putative steps for ketamine''s
  antidepressant effect. (1) Ketamine binds to an NMDA receptor on a GABAergic interneuron.
  (2) This reduces the tonic inhibition of a glutamatergic presynaptic terminal which
  causes the release of bursts of glutamate. (3) Increased signal transmission leads
  to upregulation of AMPA receptors, increased depolarization, and influx of Ca2+
  through Voltage gated calcium channels. (4) Higher intracellular Ca2+ leads to the
  release of BDNF which binds to the TrKB receptor. The Akt pathway is activated followed
  by the mTOR pathway. (5) This leads to the synthesis of synaptic proteins and increased
  spine density. Created with BioRender.com.'
