caption: Members of the BCL-2 family subdivided according to their function in proapoptotic
  sensitizers, proapoptotic activators, proapoptotic effectors and antiapoptotic proteins
  and their role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The effect of BH3 mimetics, such
  as Venetoclax, is also shown.
