caption: Model of the TORC1–PKA signaling circuit. a The TORC1 pathway promotes expression
  of the protein and ribosome synthesis genes (and thus cell growth) in glycerol medium.
  b Immediately after cells are exposed to glucose, the PKA kinases act in parallel
  with the TORC1 pathway to drive a pulse of ribosome and protein synthesis gene expression.
  c Then, as cells reach steady-state growth in glucose, the gene expression levels
  are reduced (due to negative feedback in the PKA pathway) so that they are about
  2.5-fold higher than in glycerol. d Once glucose is depleted, the repressor proteins
  Dot6/Tod6 (synthesized due to activation of the PKA pathway, see b) are dephosphorylated
  due to inactivation of TORC1 and PKA, move to the nucleus, and recruit Rpd3L to
  the protein and ribosome synthesis genes. This causes dramatic downregulation of
  the ribosome and protein synthesis genes until Dot6/Tod6 are degraded (30–60 min
  later), and the circuit returns to its original (glycerol growth) state. See text
  for further details
