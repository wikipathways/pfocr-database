caption: The upregulation of CCN2 are closely related to oxaliplatin treatment in
  HCC, and CCN2 interacting with many cell membrane receptors such as LRP6, Met, integrins,
  etc., significantly enhanced oxaliplatin resistance by activating the MAPK/Id-1
  signaling pathway. Id-1 upregulate CCN2 in a positive feedback manner, and sorafenib
  or U0126 could significantly inhibit Id-1 expression by blocking the CCN2–MAPK–Id-1
  loop
