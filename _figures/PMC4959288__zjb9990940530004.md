caption: Flow diagram of metabolic intermediates in purine biosynthesis. Green arrows
  indicate the enzymatic steps for turnover of the guanine moiety (labeled in red)
  within the guanine nucleotide pools, with the thick arrow indicating the elevated
  levels of dGTP triphosphohydrolase (dgt up-promoter allele in the optA1 strain).
  Also indicated in green is the Hpt-mediated salvage of hypoxanthine (Hx) to yield
  IMP. The blue arrows represent the mainstream de novo purine biosynthesis pathway,
  as well as its interconnections with histidine biosynthesis (from ATP and P-Rib-PP),
  resulting in AICAR production, and with thiamine biosynthesis (TPP) from the intermediate
  AIR. The red dashed line indicates the repressive effect of accumulated guanine
  (Gua) on the PurR-controlled genes (in the optA1 gpt strain). dgt, dGTP triphosphohydrolase
  gene; deoD, purine nucleoside phosphorylase gene; gpt, guanine phosphoribosyltransferase
  gene; hpt, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene; purR, purine repressor gene
  (encodes the transcription factor controlling de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides);
  Gua, guanine; Hx, hypoxanthine; G-dRib, deoxyguanosine; P-Rib-PP, 5′-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate
  (PRPP); AIR, 5′-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide; THZ-P, 4-methyl-5(β-hydroxyethyl)thiazol
  phosphate; HM-PP, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine pyrophosphate; TPP,
  thiamine pyrophosphate; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide; PRFAR,
  phosphoribosyl formimino-5 aminoimidazol-4-carboxamide; His, histidine. The red
  cross indicates the lack of Gpt activity in the gpt deletion strain.
