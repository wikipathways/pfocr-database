caption: Dysfunction in mitophagy is closely related to mtDNA leakage. Under normal
  conditions, damaged mitochondria and abnormal mtDNA can be cleared through mitophagy,
  a process typically mediated by the PINK1/Parkin pathway. After IMM herniation,
  ubiquitination can recruit LC3 to form autophagosomes, and TFAM can also act as
  an autophagy receptor to recruit LC3. Damaged mtDNA can also be transported to lysosomes
  for degradation via endosomal pathways. However, under abnormal conditions, defects
  in the PINK1/Parkin pathway can hinder LC3 recruitment, and indirectly caused the
  VDAC channel to open, while SAM50 deficiency causes changes in mitochondrial morphology
  that prevent mtDNA from being degraded by lysosomes. Additionally, a decrease in
  endosome-related proteins such as VPS35, RAB5, and RAB7 can impair the transport
  of mtDNA to lysosomes, ultimately leading to the accumulation of mtDNA in the cytosol
