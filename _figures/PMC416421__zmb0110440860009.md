caption: Model illustrating Dvl phosphorylation as a common response to Wnt proteins
  that activate distinct signaling pathways. Wnt signaling via the canonical β-catenin
  pathway requires both Fzd and LRP5/6, while noncanonical Wnt signaling requires
  Fzd and possibly additional receptors as yet uncharacterized. For simplicity, we
  have indicated that signals leading to phosphorylation of Dvl are derived from Fzd
  alone. We propose that Dvl phosphorylation is a common response to both the Wnt1
  class and Wnt5a class of Wnt proteins and that it potentiates Wnt signaling via
  either the canonical or noncanonical pathways. Which of these pathways dominates
  in a given circumstance may depend on the involvement of Wnt coreceptor components
  in addition to Fzd and possibly on the subcellular distribution of Dvl. The reported
  association between different subcellular locations of Dvl protein and different
  signaling pathways suggests that this might be a key determinant ().
