caption: '(A,B). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become powerful tools in cancer
  treatment. Notably, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1
  mAbs have shown significant effectiveness against multiple cancers through TCRs
  and MHC class I. Tumor cells often resist immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) due
  to high mutation rates in MHC class I and JAK1/2, which impair immune recognition.
  (C). Positive responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are linked to increased
  levels of specific T lymphocyte subsets, like memory T cells. However, prolonged
  exposure to tumor antigens and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME)
  can lead to T-cell exhaustion. Despite this, immunotherapy has been shown to trigger
  lasting immune responses, which can continue even after treatment ends, leading
  to extended antitumor effects and improved overall survival. The process of immunoediting,
  driven by the pressure exerted through PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, usually favors the survival
  of tumor cells with a heightened capacity to evade the antitumor immune response.
  As therapy progresses, compensatory inhibitory signaling pathways are activated,
  making it challenging for the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockade to effectively re-energize
  CD8+ T cells. If tumor-specific T cells fail to transition into memory T cells,
  the treatment response is sustained, potentially leading to disease recurrence or
  acquired resistance following discontinuation of therapy. Abbreviations: CTL-4,
