caption: 'Potential Wnt/β-catenin signaling therapeutic targets. Inhibition of the
  canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway may occur via targeting a number of the pathway’s
  elements. Wnt ligand antagonists include SFRP, WIF, or mAbs generated against the
  ligands. Frizzled receptor interaction inhibition may occur through the administration
  of Fzd mAbs as well. DKK1 has been shown to elicit inhibition of LRP co-receptor
  function. Disheveled (DVL) interactions with Wnt signaling receptors may also be
  inhibited via FJ9, Bio 3289-8625, or NSC668036. Downstream inhibition may occur
  through inhibition of β-catenin and TCF/LEF interactions by a number of different
  inhibitors. Other Wnt signaling-activating components that may be inhibited include
  TNKS, an inhibitor of axin stability, and PORCN, a stimulator of Wnt secretion.
  Inhibition of this pathway may also be the result of the presence of activators
  of elements that regulate the functions of this pathway that induce the upregulation
  or increase in function of these regulatory elements. Such activators include those
  targeting the Ser/Thr kinases CK1α (IC261 and pyrvinium) and GSK3β (lithium, CT99021,
  and BIO), the axin scaffolding protein (SKL2000), or β-Trcp (Δ2G, STG28). Abbreviations:
  SFRP, secreted frizzled-related protein-1; WIF, Wnt inhibitory protein; Fzd, Frizzled;
  mAbs, monoclonal antibodies; DKK1, Dickkopf-related protein 1; LRP, low-density
  lipoprotein receptor-related protein; TCF/LEF, T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor;
  TNKS, tankyrase 1; PORCN, porcupine; CK1α, casein kinase 1α; GSK3β, glycogen synthase
  kinase 3β; β-Trcp, β-transducin repeat-containing protein.'
