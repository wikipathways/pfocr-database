caption: Apoptotic signaling pathways after ligation of Fas/CD95 in type I and type
  II cells and the levels of interference by T. gondii. In type I cells, Fas/CD95-ligation
  triggers effector caspases directly by the initiator caspase 8 without the need
  of a mitochondrial amplification loop. Such signaling pathway is blocked by interference
  of T. gondii with caspase 8. Fas/CD95-mediated cell death in type II cells mainly
  relies on the mitochondrial amplification loop and inhibition of this apoptotic
  pathway by T. gondii largely occurs at a mitochondrial step.
