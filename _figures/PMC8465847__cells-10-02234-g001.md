caption: 'The differentiation pathway of exhausted T cells and tissue-resident memory
  T cells in the tumor microenvironment. (A) Upon activation, precursor exhausted
  T (TEX) cells expressing the surface molecules SLAMF6, CXCR5 and CD69 and the transcription
  factors TCF-1 and T-BET migrate from the T cell zones of the secondary lymphoid
  organs (SLO) towards the tumor microenvironment (TME). (B) In the TME, precursor
  TEX differentiate into terminal TEX, which express the transcription factors TOX,
  BLIMP-1, Eomes and NR4A, and have an impaired ability to produce cytokines (e.g.,
  IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2), but an increased production of cytotoxic molecules (e.g.,
  granzyme B). Terminal TEX also upregulate the expression of inhibitory receptors,
  such as PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3 and TIM-3. Precursor TEX may also give rise to intratumoral
  tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells expressing the transcription factors BLIMP-1,
  HOBIT and RUNX3 and the extracellular molecules CD69, CD103 and CD49a. Similar to
  terminal TEX, TRM upregulate inhibitory receptors and downregulate cytokine responses.
  In contrast, TRM appear to maintain expression of cytotoxic molecules. Abbreviations:
  BLIMP-1, B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
  protein 4; CX3CR1, CX3C chemokine receptor 1; CXCR5, C-X-C chemokine receptor type
  5; GZMB, granzyme B; HOBIT, homolog of Blimp-1 in T cells; IFN-γ, interferon gamma;
  IL-2, interleukin 2; LAG-3, lymphocyte-activation gene 3; NR4A, nuclear hormone
  receptor 4A; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1; PRF1, perforin 1; RUNX3, runt-related
  transcription factor 3; SLAMF6, SLAM family member 6; T-BET, T-box transcription
  factor 21; TCF-1, T-cell factor 1; TIM-3, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain
  3; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; TOX, thymocyte selection-associated high-mobility
