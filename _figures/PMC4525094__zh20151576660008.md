caption: Schematic representation of the glucosylceramide-induced signaling cascade
  of the DN process. Excessive glucose enhances GSL production by increasing the availability
  of substrate ceramide and UDP-glucose. GSLs activate signaling through Smad3 and
  downregulate pPTEN phosphorylation, which increases Akt phosphorylation, leading
  to hypertrophy and ECM accumulation in diabetic mesangial cells. Inhibition of GSL
  by C10 improves the pathology by reversing the signaling pathway.
