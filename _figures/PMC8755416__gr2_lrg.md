caption: Possible mechanism of action of H2S against SARS-CoV-2. Administration of
  H2S donors may increase endogenous production of H2S by cystathionine β-synthase
  (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), 3-mecaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST)
  and d-amino acid oxidase (DAO) and may also activate non-enzymatic pathway. H2S
  interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2 (not shown) and
  may block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to these host cell proteins, thereby inhibiting
  entry of the virus into the host cell. H2S may also alter SARS-CoV-2 membrane and
  inhibits its gene transcription including inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB
  (NF-κB). In addition, H2S may activate antioxidant pathway, leading to increased
  levels of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione (GSH), nuclear factor-erythroid
  factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and suppressing
  overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, H2S may inhibit pro-inflammatory
  pathway, resulting in reduced production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1beta
  (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and
  intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) while activating anti-inflammatory pathway
  which increases production of IL-10.
