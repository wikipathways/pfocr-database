caption: Schematic detailing the relationship among CaMKII-, BDNF-, and NMDAR-inducing
  LTP and morphine tolerance. Chronically activated MORs induce increases in Ca2+
  levels and activation of the CaMKII signaling pathway at synapses, which subsequently
  triggers the release of BDNF and glutamate. On the one hand, BDNF directly induces
  LTP through downstream signaling, and, on the other hand, BDNF also upregulates
  the expression of NMDAR. An activated NMDAR signaling pathway not only directly
  induces LTP but also upregulates Ca2+ levels and activates the CaMKII signaling
  pathway. Finally, a mutual promotion circuit for CaMKII, BDNF, and NMDAR is formed
  and brings about morphine tolerance. Multiple miRNAs may be involved in regulating
  the circuit. MORs, μ opioid receptors; CaMKII, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
  kinase II; TrkB, tyrosine receptor kinase B; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
  miRNAs, microRNAs; LTP, long-term potentiation; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.
