caption: Overview of regulation of autophagy by free fatty acids. Palmitic acid stimulates
  autophagy by activating JNK and has been shown to interact with PKC isoforms which
  have been implicated in autophagy regulation. Myristic acid has been shown to upregulate
  autophagy by producing C-14 ceramide. DHA has been implicated in the P53-AMPK-mTOR
  pathway resulting in activation of autophagy
