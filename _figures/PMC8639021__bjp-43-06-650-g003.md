caption: 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry
  and pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): 1) to enter inside of
  the cells, SARS-CoV-2 uses spike protein (S) to bind to the angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Viral internalization
  is facilitated by type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), which allows the
  fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The virus enters the host cell by endocytosis,
  releases its genetic material, and uses its machinery to translate and replicate
  RNA and release new viruses; 2) recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs), including viral RNA and glycoproteins, by pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, 4 and 7; 3) after recognition, cell signaling
  begins with the transmission of the signal from the cytoplasmic domain of the TLR
  to receptor-associated with kinase 4 (IRAK-4), which is mediated by myeloid differentiation
  protein 88 (MyD88). Afterwards, nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) and
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activate genes for proinflammatory molecule
  expression, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β,
  IL-6, IL-18, and interferon-alpha (IFN-α); 4) TLR3 and TLR7 recognize viral RNA,
  resulting in nuclear activation and translocation of interferon regulatory factor
  3 (IRF3) and NF-κB, which induce the production of IFN-α and proinflammatory cytokines.
  IFN-α can bind to the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR), activate the Janus kinase pathway
  (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), initiating the
  transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs); 5) the expression of proinflammatory
  mediators establish an innate immune response. TIRAP = Toll-interleukin 1 receptor
  (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein; TRAF6 = tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
  factor 6; TRAM = TRIF-related adaptor molecule; TRIF = TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing
  interferon-β.'
