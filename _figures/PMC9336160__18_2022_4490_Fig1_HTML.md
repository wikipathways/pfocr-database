caption: The crosstalk between metabolic reprogramming and immune cells activities.
  Immune cells rely mainly on OXPHOS for ATP production in the resting state. During
  sepsis, activated immune cells rely on increased glycolysis for ATP and various
  biosynthetic materials, such as Ru-5-P, DHAP, and G-3-P, to promote immune cell
  differentiation and proliferation. Macrophages differentiate into M1-type macrophages
  that promote inflammation and anti-inflammatory macrophages are differentiated into
  M2. T cells differentiate into pro-inflammatory effector T cells and anti-inflammatory
  regulatory T cells. Pro-inflammatory cells secrete large amounts of inflammatory
  factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) causing a host inflammatory response, at which
  time the balance between OXPHOS and glycolysis can still be maintained. However,
  when glycolysis is further enhanced, the balance is upset and lactate suppresses
  pro-inflammatory response and promotes anti-inflammatory response through various
  mechanisms, ultimately resulting in immunosuppression. GLUT1 glucose transporter
