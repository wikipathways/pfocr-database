caption: HMGA2 induces EMT by activation of different signaling transducers. (A) HMGA2
  expression is induced by the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. (B) HMGA2 promotes the expression
  of vimentin, Snail and Twist and reduces E-cadherin expression. (C) Colocalization
  of HMGA2 and smad3 on the Snail1 promotor induces expression of Snail1, and then
  Snail1 inhibits E-cadherin and occludin expression. (D) HMGA2 controls activation
  of the TGFβ, MAPK, and Notch pathways by regulating the main elements, including
  Smad2, Smad3, TGFβRII, AKT, mTOR, Notch2, Notch3, and Jagged1. (E) TGFβRII induced
  by HMGA2 increases activity of the TGFβ signaling pathway, which promotes HMGA2
  expression in a positive feedback loop. (F) Long-term TGFβ signaling activation
  causes HMGA2 to recruit DNMT3A to the E-cadherin gene promoter and inactivates its
  transcription by DNA methylation. (G) During TGFβ pathway signaling, Smads cooperate
  with HMGA2 to bind to the Has2 promoter, inducing expression of Has2, which then
  activates AKT/ERK1/2 signaling. (H) HMGA2 enhances the binding of NFκB to the positive
  regulatory domain II (PRDII) transcription factor. (I) Regulators downstream of
  the MAPK and PI3K pathways, including FGF-1 and platelet-derived growth factor-BB
  (PDGF-BB), induce HMGA2 expression. (J) HMGA2 induces the expression of STAT3. Then,
  STAT3 activation promotes EMT by reducing E-cadherin expression. STAT3 also activates
  the miRNAs let-7 and lin-28, which suppress HMGA2 expression.

  description: HMGA2 induces EMT by activation of different signaling transducers.
    (A) HMGA2 expression is induced by the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. (B) HMGA2 promotes
    the expression of vimentin, Snail and Twist and reduces E-cadherin expression.
    (C) Colocalization of HMGA2 and smad3 on the Snail1 promotor induces expression
    of Snail1, and then Snail1 inhibits E-cadherin and occludin expression. (D) HMGA2
    controls activation of the TGFβ, MAPK, and Notch pathways by regulating the main
    elements, including Smad2, Smad3, TGFβRII, AKT, mTOR, Notch2, Notch3, and Jagged1.
    (E) TGFβRII induced by HMGA2 increases activity of the TGFβ signaling pathway,
    which promotes HMGA2 expression in a positive feedback loop. (F) Long-term TGFβ
    signaling activation causes HMGA2 to recruit DNMT3A to the E-cadherin gene promoter
    and inactivates its transcription by DNA methylation. (G) During TGFβ pathway
    signaling, Smads cooperate with HMGA2 to bind to the Has2 promoter, inducing expression
    of Has2, which then activates AKT/ERK1/2 signaling. (H) HMGA2 enhances the binding
    of NFκB to the positive regulatory domain II (PRDII) transcription factor. (I)
    Regulators downstream of the MAPK and PI3K pathways, including FGF-1 and platelet-derived
    growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), induce HMGA2 expression. (J) HMGA2 induces the expression
    of STAT3. Then, STAT3 activation promotes EMT by reducing E-cadherin expression.
    STAT3 also activates the miRNAs let-7 and lin-28, which suppress HMGA2 expression.
