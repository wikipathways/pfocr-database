caption: A schematic diagram of the pathogen-derived molecules used to escape cytokine-sensing
  pathways in cells. In the basic transmission process of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway,
  the binding of cytokines to their receptors causes dimerization of the receptor
  molecules. The close proximity, of JAKs to the receptors enables their activation
  through interactive tyrosine phosphorylation. The immune evasion effect of the virus
  can be achieved through the degradation of IFNAR1 and ISG mRNA.
