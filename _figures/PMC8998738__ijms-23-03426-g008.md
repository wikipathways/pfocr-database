caption: Schematic model for the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects
  of C6 on tumor-supporting immune cells and cancer cells, respectively, through the
  HMGB1-RAGE- signaling pathway in the TME. The potential mechanisms of the suppressive
  effects of C6 on cytokine production in tumor-supporting cells and cell cycle/proliferation
  and apoptosis in cancer cells via HNGB1-RAGE-ERK1/2 signaling pathway are shown.
  Additionally, the anti-cancer combination effects of C6 and DNA-damaging agents
  are illustrated. The interaction of HMGB1 with RAGE up-regulates the RAGE downstream
  signaling pathways. Consequently, RAGE-regulated genetic programs of pro-inflammation
  and carcinogenesis start driven by the action of various transcription factors,
  such as NF-kB and AP-1. C6 potently suppresses HMGB1-RAGE-ERK1/2 signaling and potentiates
  the anti-cancer effects of DNA-damaging agents on cancer cells.
