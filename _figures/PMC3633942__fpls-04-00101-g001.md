caption: 'Summary of major metabolic pathways and processes of plant peroxisomes as
  identified by proteomics. The peroxisome plays a key role in sequestering reactions
  that evolve reactive oxygen species (). This is highlighted by the diverse oxidases
  (downward pointing arrows) that generate H2O2, and the detoxification of ROS by
  catalase and other enzymes. Photorespiration and β-oxidation are emphasized in the
  center of the figure as the major pathways. The dehydrogenases of β-oxidation are
  primarily dependent on NAD+ as an electron acceptor. Hydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR)
  of photorespiration requires NADH and this shift in redox requirements is depicted
  by the interchange between OAA/NADH on the one hand and malate/NAD+ on the other.
  NADPH is also required by β-oxidation for pathways including unsaturated FA catabolism
  and JA synthesis. Peroxisome-localized pathways (e.g., glyoxylate cycle, CoA metabolism,
  OPPP, Asc-GSH cycle) that can be linked with classic peroxisome metabolism are indicated
  as regular ellipses. The unconnected (pseudouridine catabolism, MVA pathway, biotin
  synthesis) or tentatively connected (phylloquinone synthesis, methylglyoxal detoxification)
  clouds are new additions to the list of known or proposed peroxisome-localized pathways
  () and are not readily related to core peroxisome metabolism. KEY: Oxidases: PAO,
  polyamine oxidase; SOX, sarcosine oxidase; SOX1, sulfite oxidase; GOX, glycolate
  oxidase; ACX, acyl-CoA oxidase. Substrate classes: FA, fatty acid; IBA, indole-3-butyric
  acid; OPDA, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid; CA, cinnamic acid; BCFA, branched chain fatty
  acid; Product classes: IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; JA, jasmonic acid; BA, benzoic
  acid; OAA, oxaloacetic acid. Other enzymes and pathways: MDAR, monodehydroascorbate
  reductase; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; Asc-GSH, ascorbate-glutathione cycle; OPPP,
  oxidative pentose phosphate pathway; MVA, mevalonate; IDHP, NADP-dependent isocitrate
  dehydrogenase.'
