caption: The classical pRb pathway demonstrates the utility of CDK inhibitors, such
  as palbociclib, in RB+/+ osteosarcoma. In this case, treatment of RB+/+ tumors with
  palbociclib would result in proliferation arrest and senescence as cells exit the
  cell cycle. In addition to its role as cell cycle regulator (pictured), pRb also
  serves as a transcriptional coactivator of Runx2 and thus promotes osteogenic differentiation
  (not pictured).
