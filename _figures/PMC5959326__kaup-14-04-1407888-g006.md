caption: Proposed model for the roles of autophagy and GCN2 in TM-induced BCAA starvation
  and TM tolerance. (A) The TOR-autophagy pathway in wild-type plants. As in the wild-type
  plants (control), the availability of BCAA was sufficient; TOR, a sensor and regulator
  of amino acid availability, repressed autophagy; and the cells maintained autophagy
  at its basal level. TORC, TOR complex. (B) Roles of autophagy and GCN2 in TM-treated
  wild-type plants. TM targeted the first enzyme (ALS) in BCAA biosynthesis, resulting
  in BCAA starvation in cells. Subsequently, both the autophagy and GCN2 pathways
  were activated by TM-induced BCAA starvation. BCAA starvation probably activates
  autophagy through inhibition of TOR. Autophagy degrades proteins and organelles
  to recycle amino acids and other building blocks, which contribute to the replenishment
  of free BCAA. In parallel, GCN2 is also activated by BCAA starvation through uncharged-tRNAs
  to phosphorylate EIF2A. GCN2 probably plays a role in the maintenance of BCAA levels,
  by its ability to reduce global protein synthesis and/or activate amino acid biosynthesis
  genes. Therefore, gcn2 and atg mutants were more sensitive than wild-type plants
  under TM-induced BCAA starvation conditions. 2OB, 2-ketobutyrate; Pyr, pyruvate;
  Ile, isoleucine; Val, valine; Leu, leucine. (C and D) Roles of autophagy and GCN2
  in plants with classic resistance or tolerance subjected to TM treatment. In csr1-1D-overexpression
  lines, BCAA were sufficient even after TM treatment; autophagy and GCN2 were not
  activated in the TM-treated plants, suggesting that these pathways may not be required
  in target-site resistance plants subjected to sulfonylurea herbicide treatment (C).
  In contrast, BCAA starvation still occurred in TM-treated Bel- overexpression lines,
  and subsequently the autophagy and GCN2 pathways were activated, suggesting that
  the effects of TM cannot be completely reversed by metabolic tolerance, and autophagy-
  and GCN2-mediated TM tolerances are still required in metabolic-tolerant plants
  (D).
