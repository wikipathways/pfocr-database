caption: Proposed model involving GSK-3 inhibition and the mTOR pathway to stimulate
  human β-cell growth and proliferation. Increased nutrient metabolism inhibits AMPK
  activity, and LiCl or 1-Akp directly inhibits GSK-3. This blocks TSC1/2, resulting
  in mTOR activation and signaling to 4EBP1 and S6K1. An increased glucose concentration
  and/or GSK-3 inhibition results in increases in β-catenin steady-state levels. Direct
  inhibition of GSK-3 with LiCl or 1-Akp mediates β-catenin nuclear translocation
  that is rapamycin sensitive. Overactivation of mTOR/S6K1 results in feedback inhibition
  of IRS1/2 and Akt signaling. Overactivation of mTOR/S6K1 may also provide a feedforward
  mechanism that inhibits GSK-3 and increases in β-catenin steady-state levels but
  does not result in nuclear translocation (dashed line indicates a proposed pathway).
  AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain; TSC, tuberous
  sclerosis complexes 1 and 2.
