caption: Schematic diagram showing the possible pathways involved in the activation
  of astroglial Cx43 hemichannels and Panx1 channels evoked by in vivo ethanol exposure
  during adolescence. Ethanol could stimulate directly astrocytes (1) with a signal
  transduction that possibly involves NF-κβ signaling associated to p38 MAPK and iNOS
  activation, NO production and further stimulation of COXs (2). Alternatively, activation
  of NF-κβ signaling in astrocytes and/or microglia could evoke the autocrine/paracrine
  release of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, which are well-known inducers of the opening
  of hemichannel (HC) and pannexons via the stimulation of p38 MAPK/iNOS/COX pathway
  (3). The latter cascade through an unknown mechanism likely increase cytoplasmic
  levels of Ca2+ (4), which is known to open Cx43 HCs and Panx1 channels (CHs) (5).
