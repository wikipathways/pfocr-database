caption: Under most conditions, ceramide leads to lethal autophagy induction and cell
  death. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) induces cytotoxic ceramide accumulation via de novo
  synthesis upregulation and inhibition of GluCer synthase activity, which stimulates
  Beclin1 expression, leading to lethal autophagy. Ceramide mediated autophagic cell
  death may be attributed to mitochondrial membrane potential reduction and death-inducing
  mitochondrial protein BNIP3 activation. Ceramide also induced c-Jun activation through
  JNK signaling, which transcriptionally upregulated Beclin-1 expression, leading
  to autophagic cell death. C18-pyridinium ceramide treatment or CerS1 activation
  induces lethal autophagy, independent of apoptosis, in which ceramide/LC3II interaction
  plays a key role to target autophagolysosomes to damaged mitochondria. Cannabinoid,
  which was known to induce ceramide accumulation, activated ER stress, leading to
  lethal autophagy induction via tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) mediated mTOR inhibition.
  Amino acid deprivation also induces CAPPs (ceramide activated protein phosphatases),
  which have inhibitory effects on Akt/mTOR pathway, resulting in autophagy-mediated
  cell death. Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7(mda-7)/interleukin-24(IL-24)
  was shown to induce ER stress, which triggered ceramide-mediated lethal autophagy.
  Glycated collagen1 (GC1) exposure, which leads to ceramide accumulation and acid
  sphingomyelinase (ASMase) activation, induces autophagy mediated cellular senescence.
