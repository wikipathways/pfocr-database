caption: Sub-Cellular and Signaling Mechanisms Underlying Polar PIN Localization.A
  model of regulators and pathways contributing to polar PIN localization in roots
  is proposed based on results discussed in this review. Endosome-mediated trafficking
  of PINs operates in regulating PIN polarity. At least two distinct pathways involving
  early endosomes are involved, which influence PIN1 and PIN2 trafficking through
  ES1-independent and ES1-dependent early endosomes, respectively. The SNX1/VPS29
  retromer complex and the GNOM pathway appear to reside in late endosomes that may
  regulate PIN sorting, degradation in vacuoles, and recycling to the PM. Switching
  or re-polarization of PINs seems to involve distinct trafficking pathways as well.
  The GNOM-dependent pathway is involved in transcytosis-mediated polarity switching
  between the apical and basal sides, whereas the GNOM-independent and VSP29-dependent
  pathway may regulate PIN re-polarization to the lateral side. The precise relationship
  among early endosomes, TGN, late endosomes, recycling endosomes, and lytic endosomes
  remains unclear and is most likely quite complex. Speculative pathways are indicated
  by dotted lines. Signaling mechanisms regulating PIN trafficking are emerging. PID
  kinase directly phosphorylates PIN1 to direct the apical localization of PIN1. PP2A
  phosphatases have an opposite role by directing basipetal localization of PINs via
  the GNOM-mediated pathway. Calcium signaling and a signaling pathway involving PDK1
  kinase are suggested to act upstream of those pathways. Sterols may also play some
  roles in generating polarity signal or regulate the formation of membrane microdomains
  necessary for the polar PIN localization. ROP signaling-mediated cell polarity may
  also contribute to PIN polarity signaling in an unknown manner. Auxin itself is
  shown to inhibit both ES1-insensitive PIN1 endocytosis and ES1-sensitive PIN2 endocytosis.
  There is also some evidence that auxin regulates PIN localization via the TIR1-dependent
  signaling pathway as well as having a more indirect effect by modulating PIN protein
  expression.
