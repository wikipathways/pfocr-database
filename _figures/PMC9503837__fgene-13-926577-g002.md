caption: Role of acetylation in sensing and signalling of double-strand breaks Acetylation
  mediated activation of DNA damage checkpoint leading to DNA damage recognition-
  The checkpoint sensor ATM phosphorylates H2AX, leading to recruitment of MDC1. This
  MDC1 recruitment via interaction with γH2AX is facilitated by H4K16 acetylation
  mark established by MOF1 (with help of Asf1 histone chaperon) at the DSB. The H3K14ac
  by GCN5 and docking of MDC1 promotes ATM activation and spreading of γH2AX mark.
  This leads to recruitment of pathway specific factors like the MRN complex.
