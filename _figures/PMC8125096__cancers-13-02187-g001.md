caption: Select mechanisms to target immune pathways in prostate cancer (A) Viral
  vector from a vaccine containing a sequence for antigen presentation such as prostate-specific
  antigen or other targets that may be enriched in prostate cancer. (B) Many mutations
  commonly found in prostate cancer cause DNA repair deficiency or replication defects
  and lead to more mutations. If these mutations result in changes to the amino acid
  sequence of a protein, they can serve as potential tumor-specific neoantigens. (C)
  Treatment with poly-ADP (ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) can cause DNA to
  leak into the cytoplasm and trigger the cGAS-STING pathway which can induce an immunostimulatory
  response. Figure created via Adobe Inc. (2021). Adobe Illustrator version 25.2.3.
