caption: A proposed model clarifying the paracrine effects of TD-sEVs on endothelial
  cells. The model illustrates how sEVs derived from ovarian tumor cells deal with
  endothelial cells through modulating multiple angiogenic-related signaling pathways.
  a In a physiological state, SOCS5 functions as a negative regulator of the JAK-STAT
  pathway, which in turn modulates downstream signalings in endothelial cells. b Transfer
  of miR-141 by TD-sEVs may up-regulate the JAK-STAT pathway and VEGFR-2 signaling
  in part by targeting SCOC5 in HUVECs. Additionally, the induced NF-κB activation
  triggered by TD-sEVs which may be mediated by the intracellular ROS production is
  critical events in endothelial cell angiogenesis. This model may be an explanation
  for the vascular response within the microenvironment of ovarian cancer

  ovarian cancer cells promote endothelial cell angiogenesis through activating the
