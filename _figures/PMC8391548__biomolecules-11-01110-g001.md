caption: 'Sirtuin 1 is a possible link between metabolic and immunological pathways.
  The expression of sirtuin 1 depends on epigenetic factors and influences adipose
  tissue metabolism through various transcription factors to reduce lipogenesis []
  and oxidative stress [], and it also has anti-inflammatory effects [] and regulates
  the secretion of adipokines []. Visfatin intracellularly (iNampt) catalyzes the
  reaction of the NAD+ synthesis pathway, which increases sirtuin 1 activity [], while
  extracellularly (eNampt) it regulates responses to oxidative stress and inflammation
  []. Sirtuin 1 influences the immune system through cytokines, maintaining the balance
  between Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg lymphocytes’ defense against autoimmunity []. IL-27, together
  with Treg lymphocytes, can exert an anti-inflammatory effect [], protecting against
  autoimmune inflammation or a pro-inflammatory effect when secreted by dendritic
  cells (DCs), depending on the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) []. Abbreviations: DCs—dendritic
  cells, eNampt—extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, FOXO—forehead
  box O, iNampt—intracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, NF-κB—nuclear
  factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, PGC1a—peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor c coactivator 1a, PPAR-γ—peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma,
  TNF-α—tumor necrosis factor α, Treg—T regulatory lymphocytes.'
