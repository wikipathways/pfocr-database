caption: 'Reconstitution of the immune pathways identified in previous studies and
  from the present study (see  for references). Arrows highlight the average response
  (if any) of each pathway to each treatment or comparison. Green arrow: response
  to the non-virulent treatment; yellow arrow: response to the thermal stress treatment;
  red arrow: response to the virulent treatment; violet arrow: response to the virulence
  effect (the comparison between the thermal stress and the virulent treatment).'
