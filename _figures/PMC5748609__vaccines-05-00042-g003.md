caption: Model for ASFV entry and uncoating. Interaction of the viral particle with
  membrane receptors and attachment factors activates PI3K, EGFR, Rac1 and Pak-1 signaling
  pathways, which regulate actin dynamics, forming ruffles to internalize by macropinocytosis
  in Vero cells. In the case of swine macrophages, although the virus uses macropinocytosis,
  it does not actively induce the pathway; ASFV is also able to enter cells by CME.
  After viral uptake, particles are endocytosed in early endosomes or macropinosomes
  and transported to late endosomes where the pH-dependent uncoating process takes
  place. The viral outer envelope is disassembled and the inner envelope fuses with
  the endosomal membrane, delivering viral cores to cytosol, where viral protein pE248R
  plays an important role.
