caption: Summary of the mechanisms for LAPTM4B promoting cancer development. (a) LAPTM4B
  inhibits the function of Hrs so that EGF-stimulated EGFR signaling can be prolonged
  and finally promotes cell proliferation and chemotherapy resistance, by enhancing
  the ubiquitination of Hrs by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4. (b) Inactive EGFR and
  LAPTM4B recruited exocyst subcomplex containing Sec5 to promote the association
  of EGFR with autophagy inhibitor Rubicon, which in turn dissociated Beclin1 to start
  autophagy. (c) Cells with high levels of LAPTM4B expression displayed increased
  clearance of ceramide from late endosome, which makes late endosome membranes stable
  and cells insensitive to lysosome-mediated death. (d) LAPTM4B activates the PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway by its PPRP motif. The active AKT makes the glycogen synthase
  kinase -3β phosphorylated, which attenuates the phosphorylation of c-Myc and results
  in the accumulation of c-Myc. The active AKT also phosphorylates FOXO4, resulting
  in transcription failure of p27 gene. (e) LAPTM4B motivates multidrug resistance
  through efflux by interaction with P-glycoprotein and activating PI3K/AKT signaling.
  However, LAPTM4B-overexpressing cells do not have a high expression of P-glycoprotein,
  and hence further research is needed regarding this mechanism. (f) Overexpression
  of LAPTM4B leads to overexpression of MMP-2 or MMP-9, and the PPRP motif of LAPTM4B
  can interact with SH3 domain-containing signaling proteins related with invasion
  and metastasis; however, the specific mechanism should be explored in a further
  step.
