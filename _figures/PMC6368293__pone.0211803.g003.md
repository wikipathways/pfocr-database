caption: Analytes are shown as monitored with our method for E. coli. Acyl chain lengths
  may vary between bacterial species. Molecular formulas and exact mass as depicted
  are shown. Enzymes are noted for each transformation and analytes are named as both
  the product of a specific enzyme and/or a common chemical name.
