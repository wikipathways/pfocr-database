caption: 'LPS is bound to LBP which transfers it to CD14; CD14 then brings LPS to
  the TLR4-MD-2 complex. The binding of the endotoxin LPS to the TLR4-MD-2 complex
  activates IRE1 that cleaves the mRNA encoding for Xbp1 by excision of 26 nucleotides
  (red) from the Xbp1 mRNA, generating the spliced Xbp1 form, Xbp1s, which is translated
  into a nuclear transcription factor. Xbp1s increases the transcription of its known
  target gene Il6. Transcriptional pathways not fully characterized lead to an increase
  in Ngal and a decrease in Hnf1b transcription. HNF-1β is a nuclear transcription
  factor that inhibits the expression of Socs-3. Altogether these transcriptional
  networks augment inflammation and injury, while decreasing kidney repair. Other
  pathways downstream the activation of TLR4, such as the NF-κB pathway, may augment
  the sepsis-induced AKI. Importantly, both tubular TLR4 signaling and TLR4 activation
  in infiltrating immune cells can possibly contribute to the increase in Xbp1s in
  kidney. LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LBP: LPS binding protein; CD14: cluster of differentiation
  14; MD-2: myeloid differentiation factor 2; TLR4: toll-like receptor-4; Xbp1s: spliced
  X-box binding protein-1; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; IRE1: inositol-requiring enzyme
  1; Il6: interleukin-6; Ngal: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin; Hnf1b:
  hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β; Socs3: suppressor of cytokine signaling 3.'
