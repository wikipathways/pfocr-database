caption: The roles of protein phosphatases in liver regeneration. During liver regeneration,
  PTP1B inhibits hepatocyte proliferation through the JNK and STAT3 signaling pathways,
  and is also required for TGF-β signaling to promote the termination of regeneration.
  PPM1A stimulates hepatocyte proliferation through the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.
  In the termination stage of liver regeneration, PP2A enhances hepatocyte proliferation
  and delays the termination of regeneration through AKT-Cyclin D1 and PFKFB2-glycolysis
  pathways
