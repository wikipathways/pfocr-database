caption: "Regulation mechanism of miR‐128‐3p in BCSCs. miR‐128‐3p was significantly
  down‐regulated, whereas NEK2 was significantly up‐regulated in breast cancer cells
  and BCSCs. miR‐128‐3p could directly target and inhibit the expression of NEK2.
  Down‐regulated miR‐128‐3p activates the Wnt/β‐catenin signalling pathway by up‐regulating
  NEK2, thus enhancing the BCSC self‐renewal and amplification, as reflected by elevated
  expression of surface markers (CD24 and CD44), as well as stemness transcription
  factors (Nanog and\uFEFF Oct‐4)"
