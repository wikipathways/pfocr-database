caption: 'The Rim101 pathway mediates a response to lipid stress: adaptation or necrosis.
  Lipid stress is sensed by the Rim21-sensing complex consisting of Rim8, Rim9, Rim
  21 and Dfg16. The sensing complex triggers activation of the Rim101 pathway which
  depends on ESCRT III. The cysteine-protease Rim13 cleaves the carboxy-terminus of
  Rim101 and thus activates it as a transcriptional repressor. Activated Rim101 regulates
  gene expression of NRG1 and RSB1 among others. RSB1 itself encodes a sphingoid long
  chain base transporter. Rsb1 also regulates PM-flippase (Yor1) and floppase activities
  (Dnf1 and Dnf2) via Lem3. This may facilitate adaption to PM-lipid stress or trigger
  necrotic cell death.'
