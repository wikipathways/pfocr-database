caption: 'The protein–protein interaction network simulated by STRING. (A) Protein–protein
  interaction is presented for the identified proteins in kiwifruit undergo ripening.
  Arabidopsis thaliana and confidence level of 0.4 were used for analysis parameters.
  Different line colors represent the types of evidence used in predicting the associations:
  gene fusion (red), neighborhood (green), co-occurrence across genomes (blue), co-expression
  (black), experimental (purple), association in curated databases (light blue), or
  co-mentioned in PubMed abstracts (yellow). Six clusters of highly interacting protein
  nodes are marked with oval dotted lines and include proteins involved in metabolism,
  energy, protein synthesis, protein destination, and disease/defense functional categories.
  Biological pathway (B) and molecular function (C) networks generated by BiNGO. GO
  categories of TAIR homologous proteins are presented in kiwifruit undergo ripening.
  The size of the node is related to the number of proteins and the color represents
  the p-value for the statistical significance of the overrepresented GO term.'
