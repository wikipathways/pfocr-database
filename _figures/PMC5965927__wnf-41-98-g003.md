caption: Hypothetical diagram showing neural mechanisms of bladder function in normal
  (intact) and PD. The micturition reflex is controlled by the spinobulbospinal pathway
  passing through the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) in the midbrain and the pontine
  micturition center (PMC). This neural circuit is under the control of higher centers.
  A, In intact conditions, tonic activation (+) of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
  nigra pars compacta (SN) activates dopamine D1 receptors expressed on GABAergic
  inhibitory neurons in the striatum in order to inhibit the micturition reflex. At
  the same time, D1 receptor stimulation suppresses the activity of adenosinergic
  neurons, which exert an excitatory effect on micturition via adenosine A2A receptors.
  B, In PD, dopaminergic neurons in the SN are lost, leading to the loss of dopamine
  D1 receptor activation, which results in reduced activation of inhibitory GABAergic
  neurons in the striatum. At the same time, reduced D1 receptor stimulation enhances
  the adenosinergic mechanism to stimulate adenosine A2A receptors, leading to facilitation
  of the spinobulbospinal pathway controlling the micturition reflex. Administration
  of adenosine A2A receptor antagonists could suppress A2A receptor–mediated activation
  of the micturition reflex to reduce bladder overactivity in PD. D1 indicates dopamine
  D1 receptor; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid. Modified with permission from Yoshimura
