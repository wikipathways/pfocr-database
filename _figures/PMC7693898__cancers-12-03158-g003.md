caption: RIG-I activation induces cancer cell death. (a) Upon RIG-I activation, expression
  of the pro-apoptotic genes NOXA and PUMA is upregulated, followed by cytochrome
  c release out of mitochondria. Subsequent activation of caspase-9 results in execution
  of intrinsic apoptotic pathway. (b) RIG-I signalling can also induce expression
  of several pro-apoptotic factors including death receptors that trigger extrinsic
  apoptotic pathway by activating the caspases cascade. (c) Activated RIG-I promotes
  the recruitment of inflammasome adaptor protein ASC and caspase-1, which drives
  cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 and gasdermin D. The N-terminal domain of gasdermin
  D translocates to the plasma membrane, causing cellular swelling and ultimately
  pyroptosis. ASC, Apoptosis-associated Speck with a Caspase-recruitment domain; DAMP,
  danger associated molecular pattern; IL, intereleukin; MAVS, mitochondrial anti-viral
  signalling.
