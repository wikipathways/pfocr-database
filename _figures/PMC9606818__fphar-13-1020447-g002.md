caption: 'Molecular regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is primarily
  initiated through two pathways: exogenous (transferrin dependent) pathways and endogenous
  (enzymatically regulated) pathways. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by cell membrane
  transporters such as cystine/glutamate transporter or by ferroportin, transferrin
  and lactoferrin activation. The endogenous pathway is activated by blocking intracellular
  antioxidant enzymes such as GPX4. The background color is from light to dark, with
  the light color representing exogenous pathways and the dark color representing
  endogenous pathways. TFR1, transferrin receptor 1; STEAP3, the six-transmembrane
