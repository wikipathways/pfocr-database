caption: 'PTMs involved in cell wall stress responses within Aspergillus fumigatus.
  (A) SakA and MpkC, main regulators of the HOG pathway and MAPKs, are signaling proteins
  that control novel downstream phosphorylation events of protein kinases and transcription
  factors involved in tolerance to the cell wall damage response and cell wall integrity
  pathway []. (B) The acetyltransferase, GcnE, contributes to gene regulation for
  oxidative stress responses through the action of histone modification []. (C) The
  SCF complex regulates protein degradation in fungi. Novel F-box and SCF complex
  conformations identified in response to various exogenous stresses, including cell
  wall and oxidative stress are depicted []. MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase,
  HAT: histone acetyltransferase, SAGA: Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase, and SCF: Skp1-Cul1-F-box
  complex.'
