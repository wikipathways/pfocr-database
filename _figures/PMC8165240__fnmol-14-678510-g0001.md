caption: 'Biosynthesis and degradation of N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl
  glycerol (2AG). (A) In the canonical pathway for AEA synthesis and catabolism, an
  N-acetyl group is added to phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) to produce N-arachidonoyl
  PE, or NAPE, which is then converted to AEA by the enzyme NAPE-PLD. In a non-canonical
  pathway, NAPE can be hydrolyzed by PLC to produce pAEA, and subsequently dephosphorylated
  by PTPN22N to produce AEA. Alternatively, NAPE can be converted to lyso-NAPE by
  the catalytic activity of either ABHD4 or sPLA2, and subsequently, lyso-NAPE is
  hydrolyzed by ABHD4 and GDE-1 to produce AEA. AEA is hydrolyzed by fatty acid amide
  hydrolase (FAAH) to produce AA and NAA or, AEA can be oxidized by COX2 to produce
  prostamide F(2)α. (B) In the canonical biosynthesis pathway for 2AG, PIP2 is hydrolyzed
  by PLCβ to DAG which is subsequently hydrolyzed by DAGL to produce AG. In the non-canonical
  pathway, 2-ALPI is synthesized from either PIP2 or 2-API, which is subsequently
  hydrolyzed by lyso-PI-PLC to generate 2-AG. Degradation of 2AG occurs by hydrolysis
  by either MAGL or ABHD6 or ABHD12 to produce arachidonic acid and glycerol. Alternatively,
  2AG can be oxidized by COX2 to generate to PGE2-G. Abbreviations: NAT, N-acetyltransferase;
