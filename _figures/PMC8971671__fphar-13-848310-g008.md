caption: Illustration of the molecular mechanisms by which CX3CL1 promotes cardiorenal
  dysfunction induced by diabetics. CX3CL1 expression is upregulated in cardiac and
  renal cells by a high glucose environment. Persistent high CX3CL1 expression accelerates
  the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through activation of RhoA/ROCK1-Bax signaling.
  In addition, CX3CL1 regulates fibroblast and epithelial cell phenotypic trans-differentiation
  through activation of TGF-β/Smad signaling. CX3CL1 leads to the onset of cardiorenal
  dysfunction in diabetes-induced cardiorenal syndrome type 5 (CRS5) due to its proapoptotic
  and profibrotic effects, while SGLT2 inhibitor could improve CRS5 at least partially
  by repressing CX3CL1 expression.
