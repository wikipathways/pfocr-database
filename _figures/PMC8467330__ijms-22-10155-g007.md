caption: Prospective signaling pathways for gintonin-induced wound repair of keratinocytes.
  Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor activation by gintonin (GT) may activate protein
  kinase C (PKC)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phospholipase C (PLC)/intracellular
  Ca2+ mobilization through G-proteins, leading to keratinocyte proliferation and
  migration as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release. VEGF may
  also activate VEGF receptor/phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to keratinocyte proliferation and migration. Ultimately,
  these signaling pathways may promote skin wound repair. LPAR, lysophosphatidic acid
  receptor; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.
