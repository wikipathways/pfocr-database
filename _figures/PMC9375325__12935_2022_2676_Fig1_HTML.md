caption: A schematic diagram of the role of several miRNAs in triggering the PI3K/AKT
  signaling cascade in Cervical Cancer, LSCC and ESCC. Mounting studies have revealed
  that dysregulation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway can play a crucial role in the
  carcinogenesis especially in squamous cell carcinomas. A recent study has detected
  that overexpression of miR-433 could suppress the growth and metastasis of cervical
  cancer cells via down-regulating the FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, and could enhance
  the apoptosis and caspase-3/-9 function. Moreover, miR-433 could promote the expression
  levels of p53 and Bax, and inhibit that of MDM2 in cervical cancer []. Further experiment
  has validated that miR-132 plays an oncogenic role in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma
  by suppressing the expression of FOXO1, p27, and p21. Overexpression of this miRNA
  could promote cell proliferation and tumor growth via up-regulating cyclin D1 as
  well as activating the PI3K/AKT pathway in LSCC cells []. Another research has pointed
  out that miR-21 could have a significant role in enhancing cell proliferation, migration,
  invasion, and cell cycle, and suppressing apoptosis of human esophageal cancer cells
  via down-regulating the expression of PTEN and activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  []. Green lines indicate the positive regulatory effect among miRNAs and their targets,
  and red lines depict negative ones among them. All information regarding the role
  of these miRNAs involved in the modulation of PI3K/AKT signaling cascade in various
  types of squamous cell carcinomas can be seen in Tables –
