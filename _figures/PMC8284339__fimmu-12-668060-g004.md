caption: miRNA-mRNA networks generated with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for H37Rv-infected
  human macrophages. IPA analysis was performed to investigate the connection between
  the 30 and 37 H37Rv-specific host inflammatory response gene set and miRNAs, respectively.
  Filters were set to only include experimentally observed or high-confidence-predicted
  miRNA-mRNA interaction partners. Genes and miRNAs were colored in red or green depending
  on whether they were upregulated or downregulated (respectively) with respect to
  their uninfected controls and the shading intensity shows to what degree each miRNA
  or gene was deregulated. Direct and indirect miRNA-gene interactions are represented
  with a solid and dotted lines, respectively.
