caption: Systems biology analysis. (A) Biologically statistically significant protein
  interaction map showing enrichment of biological functions and pathways in PLum-AI
  cells that are central to cell migration, cell cycle regulation, cell damage, cell
  survival, DNA damage, and cell adhesion (). (B) Targeted analysis of prostate cancer
  interactome in PLum-AI cells vs. PLum-AD cells revealed dysregulation of proteins
  involved in cell differentiation, cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis
  (). Relationships among the differentially expressed proteins in PLum-AI cells vs.
  PLum-AD cells were determined using Elsevier’s Pathway Studio version 10.0 (Ariadne
  Genomics, Elsevier) and the Ariadne ResNet database [,].
