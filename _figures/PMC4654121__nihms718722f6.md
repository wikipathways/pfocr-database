caption: A G protein-coupled receptor initiates a signaling cascade upon activation
  at the cell surface. The signal is transmitted through the G proteins to initiate
  ERK/MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, in the case of growth factor signaling. Activation affects
  the inhibition of the TSC1/TSC2 complex, which regulates Rheb activation. Rheb-GTP
  relieves mTORC1 inhibition. Phosphorylated mTOR phosphorylates 4E-BP1, which regulates
  cell growth and nascent protein synthesis. We propose that RGS10 binds and accelerates
  the hydrolysis of GTP from Rheb, which is especially apparent under low nutrient
  conditions and minimized upon treatment with the lipid growth factor, lysophosphatidic
  acid. The data shown herein supports this since RGS10 suppression increases the
  amount of Rheb-GTP in agonist-free cell systems as well as increasing the phosphorylation
  of 4E-BP1 and mTOR. RGS10 is depicted in green with a dashed line.

    Rheb-GTP relieves mTORC1 inhibition. Phosphorylated mTOR phosphorylates 4E-BP1,
