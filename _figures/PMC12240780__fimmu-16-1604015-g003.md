caption: LLPS regulates cellular phenotypes. LLPS serves as a universal organizer
  of biomolecules, dynamically coordinating spatiotemporal control of essential cellular
  processes. (A) Cell proliferation. EB1 protein forms microtubule plus-end hubs via
  LLPS, promoting kinetochore-microtubule attachment and precise chromosome segregation,
  regulating mitosis. This condensation enables the spatiotemporal organization of
  the spindle assembly core, ensuring precise and accurate cell division. (B) Cell
  migration. The abLIM1 protein forms aggregates via LLPS, assembles actin filaments
  and networks, builds the cytoskeleton, and regulates cell motility. (C) Apoptosis.
  Aberrant LLPS-mediated signaling pathways can induce apoptosis. (D) Autophagy. ATG13
  in the ULK1 complex interacts with FIP200 to drive the LLPS of complex and recruits
  autophagy proteins to form autophagosomes. p62 recognizes misfolded proteins and
  transports them to specific regions, forming condensates that promote aggregate
  autophagy. (E) Energy metabolism. Glucosomes form condensates under hypoxic stress
  to colocalize glycolytic enzymes and increase glycolytic rates. (F) Angiogenesis.
  LLPS inhibitor 1,6-HD inhibits BRD4 LLPS, disrupts cyclin A1 expression, affects
  endothelial G1/S transition, inhibits endothelial cell growth and proliferation,
  and ultimately impairs angiogenesis. Figure created in BioRender. (2025) https://BioRender.com/l26y961
