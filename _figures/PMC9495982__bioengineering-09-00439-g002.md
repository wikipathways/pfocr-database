caption: Physiological coagulation cascade activation, vasoregulation, and diapedesis.
  (A) Coagulation cascade relies on the activation several factors and is composed
  of two pathways, the intrinsic, and the extrinsic one, which both lead to the common
  final pathway; (B) Vasoregulation is mainly regulated by the balance between the
  vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1), and the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO), which
  inhibits ET-1; (C) During diapedesis, free circulating neutrophil are tethered,
  then they start rolling slower and slower due to their tethers and slings, until
  their firm arrest. Hereafter they crawl to find the exit location where they are
  extravasated.
