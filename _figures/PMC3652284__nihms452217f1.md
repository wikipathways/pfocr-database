caption: Wnt ligands bind to a receptor complex that includes a member of the Frizzled
  family and either Lrp5 or Lrp6 (right). In the absence of a Wnt signal (left), a
  “destruction” complex that includes Axin, APC, and GSK3 facilitates GSK3-mediated
  phosphorylation of β-catenin, targeting it for ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic degradation.
  In the presence of a Wnt signal, the cytoplasmic domain of Lrp5/6 is phosphorylated,
  which serves as a binding site for Axin, recruiting the destruction complex to the
  membrane and inhibiting its activity. This results in increased cytoplasmic levels
  of B-catenin, which can enter the nucleus and interact with members of the LEF/TCF
  family of DNA binding proteins to activate target gene promoters. Recently, regulation
  of the stability of the transcriptional transactivator, TAZ, has also been linked
  to B-catenin degradation, allowing GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of B-catenin to
  also regulate the targets of TAZ transactivation. A complex regulatory network has
  evolved to inhibit Wnt signaling at the level of the plasma membrane. For example,
  SOST and Dkk1 both bind to Lrp5/6 to inhibit the ability of Wnt to bind and activate
  signaling through its receptor complex.
