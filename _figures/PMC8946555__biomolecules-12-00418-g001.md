caption: 'Adenosine metabolism. The canonical pathway of adenosine synthesis involves
  the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP by ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase
  (NTPDase1, CD39) and the hydrolysis of AMP by ecto-5′-nucleotidase (5′NT, CD73).
  The non-canonical pathway involves the use of NAD+ as a substrate by CD38 or CD157
  to generate ADP-ribose (ADPR) directly or through its cyclic form (cADPR). ADPR
  is then processed to AMP by CD203a (Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase
  1). Extracellular adenosine can bind to its receptors or be metabolized to inosine
  by ecto-adenosine deaminase (ecto-ADA). Adenosine is transported into and out of
  the cell by concentrative or equilibrative nucleoside transporters (NTs). Intracellular
  adenosine synthesis is controlled by the balance of the activity of enzymes: adenosine
  kinase (ADK), cytoplasmic 5′nucleotidase (Cyto-5′NT), adenosine deaminase (ADA).
  Adenosine is generated as an end product in the transmethylation reaction: transmethylation
  reactions include the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
  to a wide range of acceptors. The resulting product, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH),
  is then cleaved by SAH hydrolase (SAHH) into adenosine and homocysteine.'
