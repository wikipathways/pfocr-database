caption: 'VEGFR2 downstream pathway with insertion of some of the inhibitor targets,
  with the HUVEC morphology indicated by colors. Green: network, blue: cords, red:
  clusters, orange: dots. Two colors indicate mixed morphology. The exact mechanism
  of action of suramin is still unknown, but it can bind to VEGF and VEGFR2’s co-receptor
  neuropilin, (not shown in the figure). From left to right: the SHP2-RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK
  pathway, the PLC-PKC-RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK pathway, the PLC-calcineurin pathway and the
  PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, which results in activation of key transcription factors
  and prepares the cell for differentiation and/or proliferation. Activation of PLC
  results in the hydrolysis of PIP2 and leads to generation of DAG and IP3. DAG is
  an activator of PKC, which among others activates the MAPK signaling pathway, including
  RAS, the serine/threonine protein kinase RAF and MEK. The RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK pathway
  can also be activated by SHP2, which is coupled to VEGFR2 through Gab1. Another
  action of PLC is activation of calcineurin, a phosphatase that activates the transcription
  factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells). PI3K converts PIP2 to PIP3 by
  phosphorylation and PIP3 activates AKT, which can directly phosphorylate and activate
  mTOR, which regulates several TFs. Abbreviations: AKT: Ak strain transforming, PKB:
  protein kinase B, DAG: 1,2-diacylglycerol, Gab1: GRB2-associated-binding protein
  1, GR: glucocorticoid receptor, IP3: inositol triphosphate, MAPK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase, MEK: MAPK kinase, mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin, PI3K: phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase, PIP2: phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, PIP3: phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, PKC: protein kinase C, PLC: phospholipase C, RAS: rat sarcoma,
  RAF: rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, SHP2: Src homology phosphotyrosine phosphatase
