caption: SLX4IP facilitates recruitment of PIAS1 to the SLX4 scaffold and promotes
  SUMOylation (S) of RAP1. SUMOylated RAP1 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm,
  where it interacts with IKKβ (as part of the heterotrimeric IKK complex), stimulating
  NF-κB nuclear translocation via IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. Once in the
  nucleus, NF-κB increases Jagged-1 transcription while simultaneously suppressing
  TERT. Jagged-1 binds to Notch receptors on neighboring cells, which liberates the
  Notch intracellular domain (NICD) through activation of the γ-secretase (GS) pathway.
  NICD is a transcription factor that recognizes its targets by binding with additional
  transcriptional co-activators (RBPJ and MAML). These targets comprise a host of
  transcription factors (for example, Hes1 and Hey2) that directly coordinate the
  cellular Notch response. This response includes the modulation of ALT-associated
  gene expression as well as other features of ALT, such as APB formation. In the
  absence of SLX4IP, RAP1 fails to be SUMOylated and bind to IKKβ, which diminishes
  both NF-κB and Notch signaling, thereby removing repression of TERT and dampening
  Notch-driven activation of ALT. In this way, SLX4IP promotes ALT, and we hypothesize
  that it controls telomere plasticity through its role in directing PIAS1-mediated
  SUMOylation of RAP1.
