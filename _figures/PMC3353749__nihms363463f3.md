caption: The glycerol 3-phosphate (or phosphatidic acid) pathway represents the de
  novo lipogenesis route in the synthesis of triglycerides (TAG) and phospholipids.
  Acyl-CoA:glycerol-sn-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) catalyzes the acylation
  of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate with acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to generate lysophosphatidic
  acid (LPA). LPA is thought to be the rate-controlling step in TAG synthesis. Subsequently,
  the enzymes acyl-CoA:1-acylglycerol-sn-3-phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT), phosphatidic
  acid phosphatase (PAP) and diacylglycerol:acyl-CoA acyltransferase (DGAT) generate
  phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG) and TAG. In the liver, TAG is either
  deposited in intracellular vacuoles or exported in very low-density lipoproteins
  (VLDL) particles. LPA and PA require translocation through the cytosol for TAG synthesis
  at the endoplasmic reticulum if they are not synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum.
  DAG can be hydrolyzed to monoacylglycerol (MAG) by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)
  and subsequently to glycerol by monoglyceride lipase (MGL). These reactions release
  fatty acids. Glycerol can be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. The conversion
  from TAG to DAG is mediated by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Comparative Gene
  Identification-58 (CGI-58) is an activator of ATGL. DAG activate PKCε membrane translocation
  to inhibit the insulin receptor kinase. Phospholipase C can release DAG from membrane
  lipids. Whether DAG derived from the phospholipase C pathway and from lipid droplets
  can lead to PKCε activation and hepatic insulin resistance remains to be determined.
