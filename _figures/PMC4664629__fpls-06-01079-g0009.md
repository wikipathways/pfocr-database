caption: A model for Al3+-induced signaling leading to oxidative cell death and its
  inhibition by Zn2+ in model plant cells. Knowledge from present experiments using
  the aequorin-expressing cell lines of tobacco (BY-2) were strengthened by previously
  reported models. As suggested in the cells of Arabidopsis thaliana (), SA signaling
  pathway is activated in the downstream of ROS such as O2•– (and possibly of calcium
  signaling). The loop of ROS-stimulated the SA signaling and expression of NADPH
  oxidase which produces further ROS, may eventually lead to development of cell death.
  Zinc may block the loop by interfering the NADPH oxidase-catalyzed ROS production
  similarly to the model for lanthanide-induced oxidative burst and cell death in
  tobacco cells (). Arrows indicate the stimulation and the T-shaped lines indicate
  the steps inhibited by agent indicated. The numbers and the symbol “C” in small
  brackets next to arrows or T-shaped lines denote the source of knowledge, namely;

  ; Arabidopsis thaliana); 5, ; BY-2 cells); 6, ; BY-2 cells); 7, ; review on higher
