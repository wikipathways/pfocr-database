caption: DHS and PHS metabolic pathways. (A) Structures of PHS and its metabolites
  and the structural symbols of LCB metabolites are depicted. (B and C) The known
  DHS metabolic pathway (B), and the expected PHS metabolic pathway (C), leading to
  complex sphingolipids and ether- and ester-linked glycerolipids along with the involved
  genes are illustrated. Dashed lines represent minor metabolic routes. Pink arrows
  represent usually minor routes that are major routes in Aldh3a2-deficient cells.
  GSL, glycosphingolipid.
