caption: A putative mechanism by which the UPS acts downstream of BDNF/TrkB signaling
  to ultimately regulate α-synuclein aggregation. According to this hypothetical model,
  synuclein-mediated inhibition of the UPS interferes with stimulatory effects of
  BDNF on synaptic activity, as well as the inhibitory influence of BDNF signaling
  on parkin cleavage and inactivation by the Fas/FADD death receptor pathway.
