caption: Schematic of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (Left) In a naiïve cell, p-catenin, when
  produced, binds to the APC/Axin complex, and is phosphorylated first by CK1 a, then
  by GSK3p. This phosphorylation leads to inactivation. The Tcf factor in the nucleus
  is bound by Groucho, a member of the Grg transcription factor family, which inhibits
  transcription. β-catenin also has a role in cell-cell adhesion, forming a complex
  with actin, β-catenin and E-cadherin to form a desmosome. (Right) In contrast, when
  Wnt is present, it binds to the Frizzled/LRP6 receptor complex, activating Disheveled
  (Dsh), which acts to inactivate β-catenin degradation, either through sequestering
  Axin or through inactivation of GSK3β. The accumulation of β-catenin in the cell
  allows for accumulation in the nucleus, allowing β-catenin to bind to Tcf and activate
  transcription.
