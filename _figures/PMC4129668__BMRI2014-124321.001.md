caption: Roles of PGs/GAGs on the breast cancer motile phenotype. (A) Complex formation
  between syndecan1 (SDC1) and integrin-α ν β3 activate focal adhesion kinase to facilitate
  breast cancer cell spreading. (B) The specific binding of SDC4, through its HS chains,
  to fibronectin activates FAK/protein kinase Ca (PKCa) downstream signaling to initiate
  focal adhesion formation. (C) Wnt5a attaches to glypican6 in order to enhance breast
  cancer cell invasive migration through the involvement of noncanonical Wnt pathway
  and JNK/p38 downstream signaling. (D) Complex formation among versican, EGFR, and
  Int-βL activates extracellular matrix regulated kinase (ERK1/2) signaling to promote
  breast cancer metastasis. (E) Binding of decorin to EGFR causes receptor internalization,
  degradation, and subsequent inhibition of EGFR signaling.
