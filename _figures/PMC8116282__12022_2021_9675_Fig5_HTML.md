caption: Cellular consequences of an aberrant tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in PPGLs.
  In the normal cell state, the TCA cycle operates at normal capacity, generating
  ATP and keeping extra-mitochondrial levels of onco-metabolites (succinate, fumarate,
  and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)) derivative levels low. Thus, the diverse group of α-KG
  dependent dioxygenase enzymes (including PHD enzymes targeting the HIF oncoprotein
  for degradation as well as TET proteins responsible for de-methylating the genome)
  is functional. Upon aberrant TCA cycle regulation (via mutations in genes encoding
  enzymes catalyzing key steps of the TCA cycle), accumulation of extra-mitochondrial
  succinate, fumarate and α-KG metabolites will inhibit dioxygenase function, leading
  to impaired PHD and TET enzyme activity—thereby promoting HIF pathway activation
  and genomic hypermethylation
