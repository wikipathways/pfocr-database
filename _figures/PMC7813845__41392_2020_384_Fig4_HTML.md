caption: 'The role of BRD4 in regulating the STING1 pathway in antiviral immunity.
  Cytoplasmic DNA derived from various viruses activates CGAS and produces endogenous
  cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, which binds to STING1 located in the endoplasmic reticulum,
  and then promotes the dimerization and translocation of STING1 from the ER to the
  perinuclear region. During trafficking, STING1 recruits and activates TBK1, stimulates
  the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, and to a lesser extent NFKB1,
  which leads to the production of type 1 IFN and other inflammatory cytokines (e.g.,
  IL). The nuclear activity of IRF3 and NFKB1 is inhibited by BRD4. In addition, after
  BRD4 inhibition, the activation of DDR can induce the release of host dsDNA from
  the nucleus to the cytoplasm, leading to further activation of the CGAS-STING1 pathway
  to limit viral infection. Abbreviations: BRD4, bromodomain containing 4; cGAMP,
  cyclic GMP-AMP; CGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; DDR, DNA damage response; dsDNA,
  double-stranded DNA; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; IRF3, interferon regulatory
  factor 3; NFKB1, nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1; STING1, stimulator of interferon
  response cGAMP interactor 1; TBK1, TANK binding kinase 1'
