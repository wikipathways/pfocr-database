caption: Representation of the CD95-mediated unconventional or non-apoptotic pathways.
  The interaction between CD95 and its ligand CD95L recruits several adaptor proteins
  leading to the activation of the MAPK, NF-κB and PI3K pathways. The MAPK pathway
  requires a cascade of phosphorylations to eventually activate ERK, allowing its
  translocation to the nucleus where it induces the transcription of pro-survival/proliferation/pro-inflammatory
  genes. The NF-κB heterodimer is kept inactive by IκB, which after IKK-mediated phosphorylation
  releases NF-κB allowing its translocation to the nucleus where it promotes the transcription
  of pro-inflammtory/proliferation/migration genes. The PI3K/Akt and PLCy1 pathways
  are functionally linked in triggering the cell migration. Active PLCy1 participates
  in the elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels, which then leads the activation
  of biochemical pathways that leads to cell proliferation, survival and migration
  through the phosphorylation and activation of Akt.
