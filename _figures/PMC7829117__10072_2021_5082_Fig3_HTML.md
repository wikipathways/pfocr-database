caption: The main effects of the physical exercise on the ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas axis. Physical
  exercise activates the ACE2 pathway and cleaves AngII to Ang1-7 production leading
  to physiological changes that are beneficial for the cardiovascular system and inhibiting
  the inflammatory response, and, consequently, the development of pathological molecular
  mechanisms
