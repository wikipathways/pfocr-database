caption: The pathway starts with assembly and elongation of the isoprenoid tail catalyzed
  by the enzyme Coq1p (not shown). Coq2p mediates the condensation of the isoprenoid
  tail with either one of two basic ring structures, para-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB) or
  para-aminobenzoate (pABA), producing 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (HHB) and 3-hexaprenyl-4-aminobenzoic
  acid (HAB) respectively. The basic ring moiety then undergoes a series of modifications
  to produce UQ. Enzymes required for 5 of the 7 modifications are shown in blue.
  A question mark (?) indicates that the protein catalyzing the reaction has yet to
  be identified. NH2 from pABA and C4-aminated intermediates are shown in red. NH2-to-OH
  conversion is thought to takes place prior to demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ6) formation.
  The intermediates that have been detected in yeast coq mutants are shown in brackets.
  They include HHB and HAB in “ coq3-9 mutants (, , ), 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxyphenol
  (4-HP) and 3-hexaprenyl-4-aminophenol (4-AP) in “ coq6 overexpressing Coq8p and
  in mutant cells deficient in Yalh1 or Ahr1 (), 3-hexaprenyl-4-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic
  acid (HHAB) in “ coq4 cells overexpressing Coq8p and in the “ coq4-1 point mutant
  (), Demethyl-DMQ6 (DDMQ6) in “ coq5 overexpressing Coq8p (), DMQ6 in a coq7 point
  mutant (, ), yeast cells with partial inactivation of Coq7p () and “ coq7 mutants
  overexpressing Coq8p (); only minute amounts of 4-amino-DMQ6 (IDMQ6) were found
  in wild type yeast cells and in the coq7-1 point mutant as well as in “ coq6 and
  “ coq9 cells overexpressing Coq8p () Asterisks indicate compounds that are the main
  intermediates detected when either 4-HB or pABA are provided as ring precursors.
  Coq8p is a putative kinase, believed to have a regulatory role in UQ6 biosynthesis.
  Deletion of COQ8 affects the phosphorylation states of Coq3p, Coq5p and Coq7p (,
  ). In addition, Coq4p and Coq9p (not shown) are also required for UQ6 biosynthesis,
  although their precise roles remain to be elucidated ().
