caption: Proposed molecular models for rice saline–alkaline tolerance. Under the saline–alkaline
  stress, in contrast to Chao2R, RPY geng may be more inclined to active the downstream
  transcription factors through these genes’ cascade regulation between the plant
  hormone signaling transduction pathway and the plant MAPK signaling pathway, then
  activating these metabolic processes, including lipids, alkaloids, and phenolic
  acids, which ultimately improves the ability of ROS scavenging, osmotic pressure,
  plasma membrane fluidity, energy metabolism, and total antioxidants
