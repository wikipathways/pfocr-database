caption: Hypothetical compartmentalization of sphingolipid metabolism. Reactions in
  the sphingolipid metabolic pathway can be isolated into different hypothetical compartments
  with each compartment representing ceramide either as a substrate or product of
  the reactions. Compartment C-1 is a de novo ceramide synthesis channel, compartment
  C-2 represents reactions leading to synthesis of complex sphingolipids, compartment
  C-3 is comprised of reaction leading to hydrolytic generation of ceramide from sphingomyelin,
  and compartment C-4 represents reactions in which ceramide is converted into other
  intermediates like sphingosine-1-phosphate and ceramide-1-phosphate. Activities/status
  of each compartment can be translated into different physiological events; accumulation
  of ceramide due to increased production of ceramide in C-1 would result in ER stress,
  increased generation of ceramide-1 phosphate, and sphingosine-1-phosphate in compartment
  C-4 results in progrowth and proinflammatory scenario in the cell. In different
  disease conditions, the status of each of these compartments contributes to the
  overall pathology of the disease.
