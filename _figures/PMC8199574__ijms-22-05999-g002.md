caption: Dopamine synthesis, storage, reuptake, and metabolism. Dopamine (DA) is produced
  in the neuronal cytoplasm via tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) acting on tyrosine to form
  3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and then L-aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase (LAAAD)
  acting on DOPA to form dopamine. Most of cytoplasmic DA is taken up into vesicles
  by way of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT). This is balanced by passive
  leakage from the vesicles into the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic DA is subject to oxidative
  deamination catalyzed by monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) in the outer mitochondrial
  membrane to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL). DOPAL is converted to
  3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). A minor
  pathway is via aldehyde/aldose reductase (AR) to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol
  (DOPET). Most of vesicular DA released by exocytosis is taken back up into the cytoplasm
  via the cell membrane dopamine transporter (DAT). DA can undergo spontaneous oxidation
  to DA quinone (DA-Q), resulting in the formation of a variety of oxidation products
  including 5-S-cysteinyldopamine (Cys-DA).
