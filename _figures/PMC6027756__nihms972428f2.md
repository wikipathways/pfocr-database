caption: Oncogenic and tumor suppressive activities of ETS proteins. Both mitogenic
  signals stemming from growth factors and stress signals stimulate the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK
  pathway to activate the ETS transcription factors. ETS proteins show oncogenic or
  tumor suppressive activities by increased nuclear transport (, ), enhanced DNA binding
  of nuclear proteins (, ), recruitment of co-repressors (, ), and gene transactivation
  (, ) involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis. Mutation of hTERT
  promoter created novel ETS binding sites, which contributes increased telomerase
  activity in cancer cells. Mutant p53 which is overexpressed in half of human cancer
  cells, bind to ETS2 to stabilize the protein and reveal its oncogenic activity.
