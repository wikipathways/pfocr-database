caption: RITA induces the activation of p53 through c-Jun/JNK signaling pathway by
  inducing phosphorylation of ASK1-MKK-4 and c-Jun which in turn induces apoptosis
  by up-regulation of p53 and Noxa; downregulation of Mcl-1, and cleavage of caspase-8,
  caspase-3 and PARP. Pharmacological (SP600125) or genetic inhibition (JNK siRNA)
  of activation of c-Jun inhibits RITA-induced activation of p53 and attenuate apoptosis
  induction by RITA. In addition, treatment of MM cells with p53-transcriptional inhibitor,
  PFT-α or p53 siRNA abrogates RITA-induced activation of c-Jun and induction of apoptosis.
  These results suggest the presence of a positive feedback loop between p53 and JNK.
  Depending on the cellular context, p53 can be directly activated by JNK, although
  the mechanism is not clear.
