caption: (A) Molecular subclassification of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) based
  on gene expression profiling. Triple-negative breast cancers have been defined as
  tumors that are devoid of the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
  receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBC overlap
  with (1) basal-like breast cancers; (2) BRCA-mutated tumors; (3) claudin-low tumors;
  (4) tumors overexpressing EGFR, associated with TP53 mutations or expressing cytokeratins;
  (5) tumors characterized by immune response signatures; and (6) tumors possessing
  some special histological types. (B) Schematic molecular pathway identified in TNBC.
  Multiple signaling cascades are activated in TNBC including those triggered by receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTK), G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), and integrins and their
  downstream effectors. Ras-mediated signaling commonly occurs through the RTK/growth
  factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2)/Sos–Ras pathway. Ras directly interacts with
  and activates Raf. Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates
  and activates MAPKs. Integrin engagement triggers several signaling cascades including
  those that are mediated by FAK, Src, and cdc42. Activation of RTK and other external
  stimuli lead to the activation of PI3K pathway. PI3K activates AKT (whereas PTEN
  inhibits this activation) and then mTOR. The G-proteins bind and activate phospholipase
  C and activate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factor. This network
  of cell signaling pathways result in the activation of transcription factors that
  drive genomic signature programs of dysregulated cell cycle progression, proliferation,
  invasion, and survival.
