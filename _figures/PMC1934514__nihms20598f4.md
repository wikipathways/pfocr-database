caption: Schema outlining the signaling mechanisms reported to be involved in GLP-1R-induced
  differentiation/neogenesis of pancreatic precursor cells, proliferation and in the
  prevention of apoptosis. Dashed lines indicate mechanisms that are either not fully
  delineated or in the case of the cAMP activation of the MEK pathway are complex
  and are shown completely in . The mechanism shown for involvement of BMP and TGFβ
  signaling pathways in differentiation is after Gittes and co-workers (; ). PKB is
  shown as inhibiting FoxO1 (by phosphorylation). When FoxO1 is in its active and
  unphosphorylated state it inhibits the transcription of PDX-1 and its translocation
  to the nucleus ().
