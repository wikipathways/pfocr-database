caption: Ligand binding to cytokine-specific receptors (TNF-R2, IL-1R, IL-6R and IFNαR)
  located on the chromaffin cell membrane leads to the activation of multiple, potentially
  interacting, intracellular pathways. Evidence suggests that each of the illustrated
  cytokines stimulate MAP-kinase activity. This may involve a single member of the
  MAP-kinase family, as appears to be the case for IL-6 activation of ERK1/2, or dual
  activation of ERK1/2 and p38 as occurs following exposure of the chromaffin cells
  to TNF-α. Activated MAP-kinases may then act upon cytosolic targets such as tyrosine
  hydroxylase (not illustrated here) and a variety of nuclear transcription factions
  including AP-1. In addition to the promotion of MAP-kinase activity each cytokine-mediated
  signaling pathway contains direct transcriptional regulators, NF-κB (p65/p50) in
  the case of TNF-α or STAT1/STAT2 and STAT3 in the case of IFN-α and IL-6, respectively.
  As suggested by our existing data describing the profile of TNF-α signaling in chromaffin
  cells it is likely that these different cytokine-activated pathways have distinct
  temporal profiles. A critical remaining issue is the investigation of potential
  interactions both within and between the various cytokine-specific signaling pathways.
  As discussed in the body of this review recent microarray data indicates that each
  of the above cytokines increases the expression of an array of genes in the chromaffin
  cell. While detailed analysis of these data is still ongoing, three functional distinct
  gene classes are readily apparent. First, each cytokine increases the expression
  of a specific sub-set of genes the products of which act as immediate, and often
  inhibitory, regulators of that specific pathway; TNF-α for example increases IκB
  expression while IL-6 increases that of SOCS3 (not depicted in this figure). Secondly,
  in agreement with cytokine signaling in other cell types each primary cytokine increases
  the expression of other cytokines, most notably TNF-α, increases IL-6 mRNA levels
  probably through NF-κB activation and results in a potential paracrine regulation
  of the adrenal gland. Such an action may serve to facilitate the controlled propagation
  of the inflammatory signal through the adrenal tissue. Finally, each cytokine increases
  the expression of several neuropeptides, which are known to be secretory products
  of the adrenal medulla. In the case of TNF-α these include VIP, GAL and secretogranin
  II. The potential role of such neuropeptides is considered in the text and depicted
  schematically in . The solid lines indicate signaling pathways deduced from published
  data; the dashed arrows indicate pathways confirmed by non-published data; the doted
  lines indicate potential pathways deduced from non-published data. ACh, Acetylcholine;
  AChR, Acetylcholine receptor.
