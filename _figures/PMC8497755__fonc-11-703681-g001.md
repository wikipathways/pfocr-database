caption: The roles of glycosylation and palmitoylation of PD-1/PD-L1. In T cells,
  PD-1 is glycosylated by FUT8, leading to its stable expression on the cell surface
  and causing a stronger interaction with glycosylated PD-L1. On the other hand, PD-L1
  is glycosylated or degraded through different pathways. It can be glycosylated by
  STT3 in ER or by B3GNT3 in the Golgi apparatus. Glycosylation helps to maintain
  its stability by preventing GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation and downstream β-Trcp-mediated
  26S proteasome degradation. In addition, PD-L1 palmitoylation catalyzed by ZDHHC3
  stabilizes PD-L1 through blocking PD-L1 mono-ubiquitination, otherwise ubiquitinated
  PD-L1 will be sorted by endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)
  to the multivesicular body (MVB) for degradation. Glycosylation is affected by the
  branch glucose metabolism pathway HBP, which directly provides the glycosylation
  substrate (UDP)-GlcNAc. Palmitoylation is affected by the lipid synthesis which
  leads to palmitate acid storage.
