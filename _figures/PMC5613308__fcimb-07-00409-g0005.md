caption: (A) Metabolic and (B) regulatory analyses of diseased-derived and healthy-derived
  samples. The gene labels in the small pathway groups are orange (only exist in disease
  samples) or pink (only exist in healthy samples). The labels colored in purple and
  green represent the specific genes only exist in Pi-disease and Pn-disease.
