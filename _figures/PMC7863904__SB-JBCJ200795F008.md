caption: A proposed model for the trade-off switch of two immunological memories with
  enhanced avoidance and reduced innate immunity in C. elegans upon reinfection by
  bacterial pathogens. In naïve worms without prior exposure to pathogens, the avoidance
  behavior is stimulated by chemosensory neurons, and the immune response is regulated
  by insulin-like signaling, p38 MAPK, or the noncanonical UPR pathways (, , , ).
  After reinfection of bacterial pathogens, a trade-off switch of two immunological
  memories with enhanced avoidance and reduced innate immunity takes place that is
  mediated by the chemosensory neurons AWB and ADF, involving the coordination of
  serotonin and dopamine, and the downstream DAF-2/DAF16 signaling pathway.
