caption: Lipid droplets are sites for lipid mediator synthesis. Polyunsaturated fatty
  acids (PUFAs; mainly from TGs) such as arachidonic acid can be sequestered into
  LDs where they can undergo synthesis within the COX/LOX pathway. This synthesis
  yields bioactive lipid mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and lipoxins.
  Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been demonstrated to interact with LDs through
  the promotion of ceramide synthesis and storage as well as platelet-activating factor
  (PAF), which has been demonstrated to promote LPS- and sepsis-induced LD formation.
