caption: Hypothetical model of the molecular events leading to the production of IL-10
  in macrophages exposed to S. mansoni cercarial E/S products. S. mansoni cercarial
  E/S products are likely to engage TLR2 and TLR4 in macrophages, after which TIRAP,
  and consequently MyD88, would be recruited to the activated receptors in a PI3K-dependent
  manner. These events trigger the phosphorylation (+Ph) of p38 and NF-κB proteins
  p65 and p105. The latter releases TPL2, thus activating the MEK/ERK/RSK cascade.
  The two axes of this signaling pathway (enclosed in a dotted line) converge on the
  phosphorylation of CREB, which is recruited to the Il10 promoter, leading to the
  production of IL-10, and also modulates the expression of genes associated with
  metabolism and several transcription factors. Phosphorylated p65 and p50, the degradation
  product of p105, can form a heterodimer, which modulates the transcription of IL-12,
  a process negatively impacted by the mechanism that leads to IL-10 production (enclosed
  in dotted lines). Peak phosphorylation times in minutes are given for several kinases,
  as well as the initial detection times for the mRNA and protein of cytokines.
