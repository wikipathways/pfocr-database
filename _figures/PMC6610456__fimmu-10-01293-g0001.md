caption: TRAFs in IL-17 signaling pathway. Biological responsiveness to IL-17 is mediated
  by single pass transmembrane IL-17 receptors (IL-17RA, IL-17RC). ACT1 U-box E3 ubiquitin
  ligase function in conjunction with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Ubc13 and Ubc-like
  protein Uev1A mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6. TRAF6 mediated deubiquitination
  by USP25 and A20 mediate the negative feedback regulation of IL-17 induced NFκB
  and MAPK. In addition to its role as the adaptor molecule for IL-17 receptors, Act1
  also functions as an RNA-binding protein that mediates receptor-induced stabilization
  of select mRNAs by directing the formation of distinct RNA-protein complexes. Act1-TRAF2-TRAF5
  complex modulation of mRNA stability is dependent on IkB kinase (IKKi) and TBK1-mediated
  phosphorylation of Act1 at the serine residue 311 (Ser311). Formation of Act1/TRAF2/TRAF5/ASF
  (arginine serine rich splicing factor) also known as SRSF1 or SF2 prevents ASF from
  binding to the 3′ UTR of CXCL1 mRNA and subsequent degradation. TRAF2 also recruits
  IL-17-induced RNA binding protein Arid5a to stabilize mRNA by counteracting mRNA
  degradation mediated by the endoribonuclease Regnase-1. TRAF3 can bind directly
  to the IL-17R to impede the formation of the IL-17R-Act1-TRAF6 complex. TRAF4 tethers
  IL-17RA and EGFR to enable IL-17A-induced EGFR transactivation and downstream activation
  of ERK5. In addition, TRAF4 competes with TRAF6 for the two TRAF binding site (TB)
  on Act1. Illustration by Shadi Swaidani MD, Ph.D. and Brandon Stelter, BFA, Reprinted
