caption: The upstream activators and downstream targets of the JNK pathway. Several
  types of stimuli, such as inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α),
  and growth factors, can induce activation of members of the MAPKKK family. Other
  factors such as oxidative stress and UV irradiation can also lead to MAPKKK activation.
  The scaffold protein JNK-interacting protein-1 (J1P) binds the MAPKKK and MAPKK
  family members with JNKs and facilitates the JNK activation. The activated JNKs
  may dissociate from this complex and induce mitochondria-dependent apoptosis through
  B cell lymphoma (BCL-2) and BCL-2 associated x-protein (BAX). On the other hand,
  activated JNKs may also promote transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation,
  differentiation, growth, and apoptosis via phosphorylation of the downstream targets.

  description: The upstream activators and downstream targets of the JNK pathway.
    Several types of stimuli, such as inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor
    alpha (TNF-α), and growth factors, can induce activation of members of the MAPKKK
    family. Other factors such as oxidative stress and UV irradiation can also lead
    to MAPKKK activation. The scaffold protein JNK-interacting protein-1 (J1P) binds
    the MAPKKK and MAPKK family members with JNKs and facilitates the JNK activation.
    The activated JNKs may dissociate from this complex and induce mitochondria-dependent
    apoptosis through B cell lymphoma (BCL-2) and BCL-2 associated x-protein (BAX).
    On the other hand, activated JNKs may also promote transcription of genes involved
    in cell proliferation, differentiation, growth, and apoptosis via phosphorylation
    of the downstream targets.
