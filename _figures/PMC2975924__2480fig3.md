caption: Eph/ephrin signaling regulates intestinal cell positioning and proliferation.
  (A) EphB2-positive stem and progenitor cells are located near the bottom (lower
  dashed line) of the intestinal crypts, while ephrin-B1/ephrin-B2-positive differentiated
  epithelial cells are concentrated at the crypt–villus boundary (upper dashed line).
  In the small intestine, EphB3-expressing Paneth cells are found at the crypt bottom.
  Constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway in ApcMin mice leads to epithelial evaginations
  near the crypt–villus junctions and development of adenomatous polyps (yellow).
  When Eph/ephrin interactions are compromised, tumor cells spread into the villi,
  and more advanced colorectal cancers, which lack a glandular structure, develop.
  (B) Intestinal cell sorting and positioning involves PI3K activity downstream from
  Eph/ephrin signaling. Cell proliferation is promoted by Abl kinase and cyclin D1.
  The proteins Dvl and Daam link Eph endocytosis and Wnt signaling.
