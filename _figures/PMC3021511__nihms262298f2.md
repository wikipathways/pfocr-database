caption: Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) identified KIAA1363 (part a) and
  monoacylglycerol (MAG) lipase (MAGL) (part b) as being increased in aggressive human
  cancer cells from multiple tumour types. Pharmacological and/or RNA interference
  ablation of KIAA1363 and MAGL coupled with metabolomic analysis revealed specific
  roles for KIAA1363 and MAGL in cancer metabolism. Disruption of KIAA1363 by the
  small-molecule inhibitor AS115 lowered monoalkylglycerol ether (MAGE), alkyl lysophosphatidic
  acid (alkyl LPA) and alkyl lysophosphatidyl choline (alkyl LPC) levels in cancer
  cells. Disruption of MAGL by the small-molecule inhibitor JZL184 raised MAG levels
  and reduced free fatty acid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
  levels in cancer cells. Disruption of KIAA1363 and MAGL leads to impairments in
  cancer cell aggressiveness and tumour growth (part c). PAF, platelet-activating
  factor.
