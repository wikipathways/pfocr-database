caption: The overlay of significant canonical pathway and the connectivity in the
  molecular mechanism of cancer, with the eight genes in IPA canonical pathway and
  with the genes in Network (I) that differentially altered in PCB exposure. Solid
  interconnecting lines shows the genes that are directly connected and the dotted
  lines signify indirect connection between the genes with the gene regulation and
  functions attributed by their shape and denoted.

  description: The overlay of significant canonical pathway and the connectivity in
    the molecular mechanism of cancer, with the eight genes in IPA canonical pathway
    and with the genes in Network (I) that differentially altered in PCB exposure.
    Solid interconnecting lines shows the genes that are directly connected and the
    dotted lines signify indirect connection between the genes with the gene regulation
    and functions attributed by their shape and denoted.
