caption: The TLR signaling pathway and downstream effector molecules. Depicted are
  key TLR molecules, their signaling adaptors and downstream mediators that are essential
  for TLR signaling and function. The specific molecules in this network that are
  presently being interrogated as potential therapeutic targets include TLR7/9, MyD88
  and IRAK1/4, as discussed in the text.
