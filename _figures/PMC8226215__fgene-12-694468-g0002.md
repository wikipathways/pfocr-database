caption: Classification of causality resources. Resources can be grouped according
  to the model adopted to represent causality in AF or PD (see ) and according to
  the organization of the information in “interaction databases” or “pathway databases.”
  In interaction databases relationships are annotated separately and not necessarily
  in the context of higher-level organizational structures, such as pathways. In “pathway
  databases” interactions are exclusively shown in the context of the pathway they
  participate in.
