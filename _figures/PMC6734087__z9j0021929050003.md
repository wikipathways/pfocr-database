caption: Diagrammatic representation of other pathways involved in endothelial to
  mesenchymal transition (EndMT) regulation. Molecular signaling pathways beside the
  transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathways that induce or participate in the EndMT
  process. These include endothelin (ET)-1, NOTCH, caveolin (CAV)-1, Wnt, high glucose,
  and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α pathways. The morphogen pathways NOTCH and
  Wnt are important modulators of EndMT. CAV-1 exerts an inhibitory effect owing to
  the internalization of TGF-β receptors and their subsequent degradation. ET-1 induces
  a synergistic stimulation of TGF-β-induced EndMT involving the canonical Smad2/3
  pathway. Hypoxia induces EndMT through the effects of HIF-1α activation of Snail1.
  High glucose concentrations have been shown to induce EndMT involving extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation. Shear stress forces (represented
  by undulating arrows) induce EndMT through several different molecular mechanisms.
  One mechanism is initiated by the mechanical force-induced release and liberation
  of TGF-β from the latency associated peptide (LAP) followed by activation of the
  TGF-β canonical pathway. Other mechanisms include reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  generation and activation of NFκB followed by the activation of NOX1/4 oxidases
  resulting in increasing production and accumulation of ROS.
