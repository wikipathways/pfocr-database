caption: 'Metabolism of sphingolipids. Ceramide can be generated by three major pathways:
  (1) the de novo synthesis pathway, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum; (2)
  hydrolysis of sphingomyelin; and (3) the salvage pathway, which occurs in acidic
  compartment of the late endosomes/lysosomes. A-CDase, acid ceramidase; A-SMase,
  acid sphingomyelinase; CerSs, ceramide synthases; CK, ceramide kinase; C1P, ceramide-1-phosphate;
  C1PP, C1P phosphatase; DES, dihydroceramide desaturase; KDS, 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine
  reductase; SMases, sphingomyelinases; SMSs, sphingomyelin synthases; SphKs, sphingosine
  kinases; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate; SPP, S1P phosphatase; SPT, serine palmitoyl
  transferase.'
