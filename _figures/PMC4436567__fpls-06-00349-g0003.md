caption: Effectors targeting the crosstalk between SA and JA pathways. In this signaling
  scheme, we restrict the presentation to plant components targeted by virulence effectors.
  (A) Necrotrophic effector activates the SA pathway while downregulating the JA pathway.
  B. cinerea uses exopolysaccharide EPS (depicted in pink) to activate SA-mediated
  defenses through NPR1 and to inhibit JA-mediated defenses including the expression
  of PI I and PI II. (B) Biotrophic effectors activate the JA pathway and suppress
  the SA pathway. P. syringae secretes phytotoxin coronatine (COR) to promote SCFCOI1
  ubiquitin ligase-dependent degradation of JAZ proteins. JAZ degradation activates
  MYC2, the transcriptional regulator of JA-responsive genes. MYC2 also induces NAC
  transcription factors ANAC019, ANAC055, and ANAC072 which are repressors of SA production.
  P. syringae uses HopZ1a and HopX1 to directly target JAZ proteins to accelerate
  their degradation, thus inhibiting SA-mediated defenses. Bacterial effectors are
  indicated in dark yellow. Plant components are indicated by green squares. Solid
  arrows represent direct activation, dotted arrows indicate indirect activation,
  and blunt ended arrows indicate inhibition.
