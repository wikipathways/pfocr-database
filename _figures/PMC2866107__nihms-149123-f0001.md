caption: 'According to the conventional model, hyperacute rejection of pig organs
  in humans is triggered by binding of preformed human “natural” antibody, which is
  predominantly directed against Galα1-3Gal sugars that decorate many molecules on
  the surface of pig cells. Panel A: Complement is activated by bound antibody, triggering
  retraction and lysis of endothelial cells. Loss of endothelial barrier function
  contributes to leakage of blood into the interstitium. Blood clotting within vessels
  is activated by injured endothelium and exposed basement membrane, leading to downstream
  tissue ischemia and necrosis. Panel B: When the galactosyl transferase gene is disabled
  by gene knockout, pig cells lack the Galα1-3Gal target antigen. If present in sufficient
  quantity, antibody against other pig antigens that is either preformed or induced
  after transplant can trigger complement-mediated injury and associated coagulation
  pathway activation. Panel C: Human proteins that regulate (abort) complement activation
  (complement pathway regulatory proteins, CPRPs) disable human complement more efficiently
  than do their pig analogues. Organs from pigs genetically engineered to express
  human CPRPs are protected from hyperacute rejection, although this protection can
  be overcome by high-titer antibody, or if endothelial injury occurs due to other
  mechanisms (ischemia-perfusion injury or coagulation pathway activation, for example).
  GalT-KO, human CPRP, and perhaps additional gene modifications may be necessary
  to yield clinically useful, reliable protection of pig organs in man.'
