caption: Effects of sepsis on AHR and inflammatory factors. During sepsis, the activation
  of NF-κB increases the expression of inflammatory factors IL-1β and IL-10 in LPS-stimulated
  inflammatory macrophages, and the expression of AHR is upregulated through the NF-κB
  pathway. Concurrently, the activation of AHR can enhance the phosphorylation of
  SRC; then, p-SRC upregulates STAT3 phosphorylation, and p-STAT3 further positively
  regulates the production of IL-10 by macrophages.
