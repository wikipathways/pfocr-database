caption: 'Lignin biosynthesis. A In the plant cell (cytosol) the amino acid phenylalanine
  is converted to the three canonical monolignols (p-coumaroyl alcohol, coniferyl
  alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, indicated in blue) in the “grid-like” phenylpropanoid
  pathway, where phenylalanine goes through a series of ring (horizontal reactions
  on the biosynthetic grid) and sidechain (vertical reactions on the biosynthetic
  grid) modification to produce the monolignols for export to the plant secondary
  wall for lignification. Some non-canonical monolignols can also be synthesized via
  the phenylpropanoid pathway, or are intermediates in this pathway (indicated in
  orange). B Following biosynthesis, the monolignols are transported outside the cell,
  into the apoplastic space, where they are radicalized via laccase and peroxidase
  enzymes, and these radicals are then incorporated in the lignin polymer via radical
  coupling. The polymer shown here depicts a poplar lignin, mainly composed of β-aryl-ether
  (β-O-4) bonds (red) and syringyl monomers. 4CL: 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; C3H: p-coumarate
