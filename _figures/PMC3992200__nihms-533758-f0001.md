caption: HDACs and associated corepressors (the molecular brake pads) act to suppress
  gene expression necessary for long-term memory formation and maintenance (). However,
  a stress-dependent signal of sufficient strength is capable of transiently removing
  the brake pads to permit gene expression required for persistent long-term memory.
  Stressful events trigger the release of cortisol (cort) and norepinephrine (NE)
  that bind to their respective receptors on post-synaptic neurons. Cortisol binds
  to membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) that in association with NE-bound
  adrenergic receptors (α1 and ) lead to the activation of adenylate cyclase (AC)
  and the cAMP/PKA-signaling pathway. This ultimately results in the phosphorylation
  of CREB (Roozendaal et al., 2010). PKA is also capable of initiating the ERK/MAPK
  signaling cascade (pMEK/perk/pMSK/pElk1) to phosphorylate CREB. CREB binding protein
  (CBP; a HAT), once associated with phosphorylated CREB, interacts with the basal
  transcription machinery to acetylate histones thereby promoting transcription. Cortisol
  can also bind to nuclear hormone glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) that translocate
  to the nucleus where they can have several effects. GRs dimerize and bind to glucocorticoid-response
  elements (GREs) within regulatory and promoter regions. If GREs are in close proximity
  to the TATA box then GRs can promote the binding of transcription factor II D (TFIID)
  and the basal transcription machinery. During this process, the molecular ‘brake
  pads’ (HDACs and associated co-repressors) are released from the promoter, allowing
  histone acetylation. It is hypothesized that GR removes the molecular ‘brake pads’
  to persistent long-term memory formation similar to the effect of HDAC inhibitors
  (HDACi) on class I HDACs. The combined action of these various interacting signaling
  cascades is to regulate transcription required for the formation and maintenance
  of long-term memory.
