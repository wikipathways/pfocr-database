caption: SiO influences fibrosis in HTMCs via ferroptosis induction. Following PPV
  and vitreous tamponade with SiO, SiO enters the anterior chamber and infiltrates
  HTMCs. It induces ferroptosis in HTMCs through the ROS/NOX4/Smad3 signaling pathway,
  ultimately promoting fibrosis of the HTMCs and contributing to the development of
  elevated IOP
