caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation. TLRs are activated by a number of different
  agonists, and are expressed either on the cell membrane or intracellularly on the
  membranes of endosomes. The extracellular receptors TLR-1, -2, -4, -5 and -6 respond
  predominantly to bacterial products as well as some endogenous agonists, whereas
  the intracellular receptors TLR-3, -7, -8 and -9 respond to nucleotides of viral
  and bacterial origin. The figure also shows a very simplified TLR signalling pathway,
  showing how many structurally different agonists can induce activation of similar
  pathways.
