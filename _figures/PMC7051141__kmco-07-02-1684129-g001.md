caption: 'New signaling pathway controlling the senescence barrier in breast cancer.(a)
  In untransformed human mammary epithelial cells with low PAK4 expression levels
  (gray cells), exposure to oncogenes causes oncogene-induced senescence (OIS, blue
  cells), a major barrier to cancer development. However, we found that PAK4 overexpression
  can override the OIS barrier in mammary epithelial cells, indicating a route by
  which PAK4 may promote cancer, consistent with the commonly observed PAK4 overexpression
  in cancer (purple cells). We also found that PAK4 inhibition in established breast
  cancer elicits a senescent-like growth arrest, indicating a vulnerability of breast
  cancer that may be utilized for the development of therapy. (b) A PAK4 – RELB -
  C/EBPβ axis mechanistically controls the senescence phenotype in breast cancer.
  Abundant PAK4 interacts with and phosphorylates serine 151 of RELB (S151), impairing
  RELB DNA-binding and transcription, including of C/EBPβ, thereby facilitating cancer
  cell proliferation. When PAK4 is inhibited, RELB accumulates, binds to DNA and promotes
  C/EBPβ expression, leading to a senescence-like growth arrest. Both panels are based
  on our recent results. The schematic in Panel A is from Costa 2019 with permission,
  inspired by Narita & Lowe. Panel B as in original from Costa et al., 2019. PAK4:
  p21-activated kinase 4; C/EBPβ: CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein beta; RELB: nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) subunit.'
