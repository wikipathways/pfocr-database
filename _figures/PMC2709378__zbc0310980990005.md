caption: Similarities between the Cry toxin mode of action in Lepidoptera and Coleoptera.
  Cadherins are key receptors for Cry toxins in both orders. In Lepidoptera, Cry1A
  toxins are protease-activated (a) and bind to cadherin receptors on the apical surface
  of the midgut membrane (b). Cell death results from either the activation of an
  intracellular signaling pathway or through the formation of toxin oligomers (c)
  that bind to N-aminopeptidase (APN) and/or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (d) to insert
  in the membrane and form pores that result in cytotoxicity due to osmotic imbalance
  (e). In Coleoptera, Cry3 protoxin interacts with a gut-specific ADAM metalloproteinase.
  Toxin or protoxin binding to cadherin results in toxin oligomerization and eventually
  cell death. Further research is necessary to characterize post-binding steps in
  the coleopteran model.
