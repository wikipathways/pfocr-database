caption: Model for the cross‐talk among HpaS‐, RavA‐, and RavS‐mediated signalling
  pathways in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc). RavA/VemR regulates flagellin
  fliC expression via FleQ/RpoN2 and FliA to influence Xcc swimming and regulates
  FleQ/RpoN2 and Clp activities to affect bacterial swarming. RavA/RavR and RavS/RavR
  control cellular c‐di‐GMP levels and thus regulate bacterial motility via the c‐di‐GMP
  receptor Clp. HpaS/VemR regulates bacterial swimming via direct interaction with
  the flagellum protein FliM. HpaS phosphorylates HrpG and regulates the expression
  of the type III secretion system (T3SS) and Xcc virulence.  positive regulation;  negative
