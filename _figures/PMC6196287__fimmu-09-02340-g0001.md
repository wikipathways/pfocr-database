caption: ZIKV entry, replication and interaction with cellular pathways in target
  cell. ZIKV enters the cell either via clathrin-mediated or receptor-mediated endocytosis.
  The acidic environment in the endosome induces viral fusion releasing genomic RNA.
  Viral RNA is subsequently translated into a polyprotein which is further processed
  by host and viral-encoded proteins. Flavivirus replication complex is assembled
  in close vicinity to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Following viral replication,
  packaging occurs on the surface of the ER and the resultant immature virions are
  translocated to the Golgi complex where furin-mediated cleavage of prM to M generates
  mature virus that are released via exocytosis. ZIKV activates TLR3 () and the autophagy
  pathway (), which may potentially mediate viral replication and survival within
  the cells. Exosomes released from infected cells have been reported to contain ZIKV
  proteins including NS1 (). Flaviviruses manipulate the unfolded protein response
  (UPR) pathways in host by activation of one or more arms of the UPR which may lead
  to DNA repair, cell homeostasis or apoptosis (). Green arrow indicates upregulation
  of the step in the pathway and red line indicates inhibition of the step in the
  pathway or viral replication.
