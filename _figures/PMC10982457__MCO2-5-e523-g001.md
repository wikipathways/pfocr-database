caption: 'Viral RNA‐driven peripheral serotonin reduction impairs neurocognition by
  directly dampening vagal signaling. In patients with post‐acute sequelae of coronavirus
  disease 2019 (PASC) or other post‐viral syndromes, persistent viral RNA and downstream
  chronic inflammation induce peripheral serotonin depletion through the type‐I IFN‐IFNAR‐STAT1
  signaling pathway. Moreover, attenuated tryptophan absorption, impaired serotonin
  storage, and enhanced serotonin degradation are responsible for the reduction of
  serotonin. Systemic serotonin reduction, in turn, causes neurocognitive disorders
  by directly dampening vagal signaling. Brain, gut, and blood vessel cartoon images
  were obtained from ScienceSlides. 5‐HIAA: 5‐hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 5‐HT3: serotonin
  receptor 5‐HT3, EC cell: enterochromaffin cell, IFN: interferon, IFNAR: interferon
  alpha receptor, MAO: monoamine oxidase, TLR3: toll‐like receptor 3'
