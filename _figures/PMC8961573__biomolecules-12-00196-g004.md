caption: The human reactome of drug targets. The drug targets of the top 20 predicted
  drug candidates for AD treatment was analyzed and visualized with Reactome Pathway
  Browser. In the insert, the serotonin receptor pathway is shown as an example. The
  darker the edges are, the more enriched the top gene targets are.
