caption: Hypothetical model of the mechanism by which NRP1/2 regulate cell death in
  various stress responses. Under ER stress and heat stress, the expression of NRP1
  activated by bZIP60 is independent of the IRE1a/b splicing pathway, while during
  salt stress, the expression of NRP1 is regulated by unknown factors (green item
  with question mark) other than bZIP60. NRP2 is regulated by unknown factors (blue
  and pink items with question marks) under these stresses. In turn, NRP1/2 represses
  the transcription of MC genes, thereby inhibiting cell death. Dotted lines indicate
  unknown regulations.
