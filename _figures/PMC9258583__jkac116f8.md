caption: Replication stress in mcm4-dg that allows evasion of checkpoint has distinct
  RPA foci phenotype. Resection and repair machinery and FPC contribute to megafoci
  RPA formation. Swr1/Ino80 pathway also contributes to megafoci formation and is
  required to bring megafoci RPA to the nuclear periphery. Repair proteins like Ku70,
  Crb2, Rad51, Rad54, and Rad26 are recruited to RPA foci. Cds1 contributes to cell
  division especially in cells that are depleted of Mcm4 during early S phase.
