caption: 'a CHCHD10S59L can generate cellular toxicity with or without WT CHCHD10
  and its close paralog CHCHD2. The toxicity of the gain-of-function CHCHD10S59L mutant
  is mediated by two different pathways. TDP-43 axis: Upon CHCHD10S59L expression,
  TDP-43 becomes more insoluble in the cytoplasm, probably due to mitochondria-induced
  stresses, and accumulates in mitochondria via increased binding with CHCHD10S59L.
  The toxicity generated by mitochondrial TDP-43 can be mitigated by inhibitors for
  TDP-43 mitochondrial translocation. PINK1 axis: in response to CHCHD10S59L expression,
  PINK1 is stabilized and accumulates on mitochondria in an uncontrolled manner. PINK1
  phosphorylates its downstream targets, including mitofusin, mitofilin, and Parkin,
  which results in significant mitochondrial fragmentation, maladaptive cristae formation,
  and excessive mitophagy. A positive feedback mechanism via PINK1 accumulation may
  accelerate these processes. Genetic or chemical modulation of this pathway can mitigate
  CHCHD10S59L-induced cellular toxicity and C9orf72 G4C2 repeat-induced degeneration.
  Interestingly, WT CHCHD10 expression reduces CHCHD10S59L-mediated cellular toxicity
  through both TDP-43 and PINK1 axes.'
