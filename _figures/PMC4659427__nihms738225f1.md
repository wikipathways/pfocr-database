caption: The architecture and signaling of the Drosophila testis niche. (a) Somatic
  hub cells ( green) signal to attached germline and somatic cyst stem cells (GSCs,
  orange, and CySCs, blue, respectively). GSCs asymmetrically divide to produce daughter
  gonialblasts (light orange), which are displaced from the hub and undergo four mitotic
  divisions with incomplete cytokinesis, producing interconnected spermatogonia (light
  orange). CySCs divide asymmetrically to produce daughter cyst cells (light blue);
  two encase each gonialblast and elongate to accommodate differentiating germ cells
  throughout spermatogenesis. Panel adapted from . (b) Hub cells secrete the ligand
  Unpaired (Upd), activating Janus kinase–Signal transducer and activator of transcription
  ( JAK-STAT) signaling in GSCs and CySCs, which is required for their maintenance.
  The downstream targets of STAT in GSCs are unknown, but two targets of STAT in the
  CySCs, zinc-finger homeodomain protein 1 (zfh1) and chronologically inappropriate
  morphogenesis (chinmo), are essential for CySC self-renewal (, ). Hedgehog signaling,
  which is activated by the ligand Hedgehog secreted from the hub, is also required
  for CySC but not GSC maintenance. Although its downstream targets are unknown, it
  may contribute to GSC maintenance by regulating Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
  signaling (). The hub and CySCs both secrete the ligands Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and
  Glass bottom boat (Gbb); this secretion is thought to result from activated STAT
  or one of its downstream targets (, ). Secretion of these ligands activates the
  BMP signaling pathway in GSCs. This, in turn, represses the differentiation factor
  Bag-of-marbles (Bam). Gonialblasts do not receive enough BMP signaling to repress
  bam expression and thus upregulate bam, initiating the differentiation process.
  Daughter cells in each lineage are thought to receive fewer niche signals as a result
  of their displacement from the hub. If these niche signals fall below a certain
  threshold, they can be overridden by the acquisition of new signals that promote
  differentiation, such as those triggered by Epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling
  within the CySC lineage.
