caption: After being stimulated by ligand (i.e. Gram-positive or -negative bacteria),
  TLR activates the MyD88-dependent pathway through the MyD88-IRAK-TRAF6 complex,
  which in turn activates the downstream MAPKs and NFκB activation. In addition, integrin
  αVβ3 was also activated by inside-out signaling from the ligation of TLR, thus triggers
  downstream c-Src/Syk and FAK activation. Ligands (extracellular-matrix, ECM; vitronectin,
  fibronectin, etc.) binding to integrin αVβ3 also facilitates downstream signaling
  pathway. Rn possesses anti-inflammatory effects mainly through blocking the αVβ3
  induced NFκB and MAPK pathways, and MyD88-dependent TLR signaling pathway in production
  of cytokines in phagocytes. Taken together, Rn suppresses release of inflammation-associated
  mediators (cytokines), inhibits cell adhesion and migration in vitro and even attenuates
  the acute inflammation of mice caused by bacterial infection in mice.
