caption: Mammalian NAD+ salvage pathway. NAD+ is synthesized in the NAD+ salvage pathway
  from its precursors NA, NAM, or NR. The initial step in NAD+synthesis from NA, the
  so-called Preiss-Handler pathway, is catalyzed by NAPT and results in the formation
  of NAMN, which can also be derived from de novo NAD+ biosynthesis. In an identical
  reaction, but catalyzed by a different enzyme, NAM is converted by NAMPT forming
  NMN, which is also the product of phosphorylation of NR by NRK. The subsequent conversion
  of both NAMN and NMN is catalyzed by the same enzyme, i.e., NMNAT. In the case of
  NAMN, this reaction is followed by amidation, finally producing NAD+. NADS, NAD
  synthase.
