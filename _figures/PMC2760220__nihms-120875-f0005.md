caption: 'Proposed pathway of l-glutamate biosynthesis in C. acetobutylicum given:
  (i) an intracellular l-glutamate solute pool and (ii) reversibility of the l-arginine
  biosynthesis pathway in C. acetobutylicum. The pathway produces 1 mol of l-glutamate
  per mole of l-ornithine processed. Moles of l-glutamate produced (positive number)
  or consumed (negative number) at each step are shown in dashed circles. The pathway
  loop (closed by dashed line) begins and terminates with N-acetyl-l-glutamate. The
  primary metabolism of C. acetobutylicum produces weak acids (notably acetate and
  butyrate) during exponential growth. Weak acids have been shown to inhibit intracellular
  l-glutamate solute pool accumulation in other clostridia (). Not all reaction details,
  including charge-balances, are shown here.'
