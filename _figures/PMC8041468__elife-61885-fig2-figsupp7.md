caption: (A) Network illustrates part of the regulatory relationship between TFs and
  their target genes in antibiotic resistance pathway. The other part is shown in
  . Circles indicate TF proteins, and squares indicate target genes. Red arrows show
  the binding sites located in the putative promoters of the target genes, establishing
  the regulatory relationship. Black arrows indicate that we did experimental validations,
  demonstrated in panels B–E. To save space, ‘PA’ is removed in the names of all TFs
  and their target genes. (B) The validation on the binding of PhoB to the shared
  promoter of PA0959 or oprD. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiment
  (left) validated the binding of PhoB to the promoter. Note that a binding-caused up-shift
  of the DNA bands in gel was observed. By contrast, the promoter fragment of triA
  was used as the negative control showing no binding to PhoB. The motif of PhoB is
  shown in above the EMSA result. Arrows indicate half-sites in dimeric binding. The
  right panel validates the binding of PhoB to a predicted site in the promoter of
  the PA0959 orthologue TF PA14_51860 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14, by a ChIP-seq
  peak identified in an independent study (). (C) The validation on the binding of
  PhoB to the promoter of PA3515-PA3519 operon. EMSA experiment (left) validated the
  binding of PhoB to the promoter of PA3515–PA3519 operon. The binding-caused up-shift
  of the DNA bands in gel was observed. The negative control is the same as panel
  B. The right panel validates the binding of PhoB to a predicted site in the promoter
  of the PA3515-PA3519 operon orthologue TF PA14_18810 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14,
  by a ChIP-seq peak identified in an independent study (). (D and E) Binding of PhoB
  to a predicted site in the promoters of pstCAB operon (D) and the shared promoter
  of czcCB operon and PA2523 orthologue PA14_31960 (E) is supported by a ChIP-seq
  peak identified in an independent study ().
