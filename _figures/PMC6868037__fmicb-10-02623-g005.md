caption: Proposed metabolic model for rhizosphere soil proteins as inferred by metaproteomic
  data. Identification numbers [E.C.-.-.-.-.] refer to the identified proteins. Red
  Upward arrows indicate the up-regulated proteins and green downward arrows show
  the down-regulated proteins. EMP, Embden-Meyerhof pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid
  cycle; GAC, glyoxylic acid cycle.
