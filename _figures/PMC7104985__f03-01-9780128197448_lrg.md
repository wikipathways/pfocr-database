caption: A schematic depiction of production and sensing mechanisms for type I interferons
  (IFNs). Danger signals like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or different nucleic acid species
  (single-stranded RNA or ssRNA, double-stranded RNA or dsRNA, CpG DNA) bind their
  cognate receptors like, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene
  I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), or cyclic GMP-AMP
  (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS). These receptors execute a complex intracellular pathway
  that ultimately leads to the activation of transcription factors like IFN regulatory
  factor (IRF)-3/7 that eventually transcribe IFNα/β, which are thereafter translated
  and secreted. Upon extracellular emergence, IFNα/β bind to the IFNα receptor (IFNAR)
  complex, which causes activation of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and receptor-associated
  janus kinase 1 (JAK1). This eventually activates various downstream pathways that
  primarily aim to induce production of various interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)
  derived protein products but also modulate cellular homeostasis. Of note, the inflammatory
  potential of IFNα/β is often limited by ubiquitination (Ub)-driven, lysosomal degradation
  of the IFNAR complex. AKT, protein kinase B alpha; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IKKβ,
  I-kappa-B kinase beta; IKKɛ, I-kappa-B kinase epsilon; IRS1/2, insulin receptor
  substrate 1; ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral
  signaling protein; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; NF-κB, nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; PI-3K, phosphoinositide-3-kinase;
