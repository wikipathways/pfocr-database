caption: Simplified diagram showing mechanisms involved in activation of the JNK pathway.
  Different stress conditions might activate JNK signaling via scaffold proteins.
  UPR and an interaction between Ire1 and PS1 have also been described as potential
  activators of JNK. ROS, radical oxygen species; Aβ, βamyloid; JIP, JNK interacting
  protein; UPR, unfolded protein response; Ire, endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling
  1.
