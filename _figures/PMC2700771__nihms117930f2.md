caption: Mechanisms by which E2 treatment attenuates the pro-inflammatory (e.g. TNF-α)-stimulated
  IκBα/NFκB signaling pathway. E2 inhibits the expression of the pro-inflammatory
  mediator TNF-α (A) and increases the expression of IκBα (B). E2 can also inhibit
  IKK-mediated phosphorylation (C) and degradation (D) of IκBα. At the transcriptional
  level, E2-induced activation of estrogen receptor (ER) inhibits NFκB-induced transcription
  of chemokines/cytokines (E) and can inhibit the ability of NFκB to bind to DNA (F).
  E2 has also been shown to block JNK induced TNF-α production (G). ⊥- indicates inhibitory
  effects; ↑ - indicates stimulatory effects.
