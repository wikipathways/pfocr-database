caption: FA/BRCA DNA damage response pathway. Following DNA damage, the proteins represented
  by A, B, C, E, F, G, L, and M form the core complex, which is required for ubiquitination
  of the I and D2 proteins, which are in turn required for the downstream complex
  of D2-ubi, I-ubi, and D1/BRCA2, N/PALB2, BRCA1, and J/BACH1/BRIP1 to form foci for
  DNA repair. Only BRCA1 is not yet known to be a Fanconi gene.
