caption: ATP-producing metabolic pathways in distinct immune cell subsets. Glucose
  oxidation to pyruvate via glycolysis is a fast reaction generating 2 mol of ATP
  per mol glucose. This aerobic glycolysis is complemented by the PPP that can produce
  further metabolic precursor molecules and is involved in ROS production. Pyruvate
  can be converted to lactate or further oxidized to acetyl-CoA entering the mitochondrial
  TCA cycle (yellow box). The TCA cycle (red box) generates reducing equivalents NADH
  and FADH2 which are utilized in the mitochondrial respiratory chain to build up
  the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane by complexes I–IV of
  the respiratory chain. As a by-product, ROS and RNS are produced. OXPHOS produces
  larger amounts of ATP (~ 30 mol/mol glucose) by complex V. Immune cells are also
  able to utilize substrates such as glutamine, which enters these pathways via the
  TCA metabolite α-ketoglutarate and FA, which are oxidized to acetyl-CoA via β-oxidation.
  Granulocytes and M1 macrophages (yellow box) have a highly glycolytic metabolism
  even when O2 is available. Their TCA cycle and respiratory chain activity are maintained
  at a low level. Tn, Tm, and Treg cells, as well as monocytes and M2 macrophages,
  primarily perform OXPHOS and are also able to metabolize FA and glutamine in order
  to fuel the TCA cycle (red box). Teff cells (green box) have a highly active metabolism
  including all of the pathways described. ADP adenosine diphosphate, ATP adenosine
