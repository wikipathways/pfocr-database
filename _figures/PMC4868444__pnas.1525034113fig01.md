caption: The nogalamycin gene cluster and the biosynthetic steps for anthracyclines
  investigated in this study. The end product of the pathway nogalamycin (1) is produced
  by WT Streptomyces nogalater whereas pathway engineering led to the isolation of
  compounds 2–7 from the heterologous host S. albus, and compounds 8 and 9 were generated
  using enzymatic synthesis. The core of the gene cluster (white genes) has been cloned
  into cosmid pSnogaori for production of 2 whereas genes near the boundaries of the
  cluster are marked in black. Genes encoding SnoN and SnoK are shown in purple and
  gray, respectively.
