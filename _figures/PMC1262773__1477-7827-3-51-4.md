caption: Endocrine regulation of the testis. Pituitary gonadotropins are the chief
  regulators of testicular function; FSH acts through its receptors in Sertoli cells
  (FSHR) to regulate spermatogenesis and LH stimulates androgen production by Leydig
  cells after binding to LHR. However, gonadal steroids, i.e., androgen and estrogen,
  and other agents that bind or prevent binding to steroid hormone receptors (androgen
  receptor AR, ERα, and ERβ), which are present in Sertoli cells, germ cells and Leydig
  cells also regulate testicular function. The pathway mediated by adenosine-3',5'-cyclic
  monophosphate (cAMP) appears to be the primary intracellular signaling pathway in
  all testicular cells. However, several growth factors e.g., insulin like growth
  factor-1 (IGF-1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), acting via their receptors,
  IGF-1R and EGF-R, possibly modulate AR and ER-mediated pathways. Thus, testicular
  function is regulated by interactions between several signaling pathways, some acting
  locally, e.g., AR and ER-mediated pathways, and others indirectly by modulating
  hypothalamus-pituitary function. Hormonal activation of transcriptional gene activity
  results in changes in cell differentiation and function. PMC, peritubular myoid
  cell; CRE, cAMP-responsive elements, ARE, androgen-responsive elements; ERE, estrogen-responsive
  elements.
