caption: Increased amyloidogenicity, blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, and dysregulated
  RAGE and LRP-1 expression induce neuronal Aβ deposition. The pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (as opposed to anti-inflammatory ones) secreted by the astrocytes and microglia
  promote the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing towards Aβ. Glia-mediated inflammation
  also induces vascular dysfunction involving dysregulated activation of MMPs and
  altered RAGE and LRP-1-dependent Aβ clearance from the brain, overall increasing
  neuronal Aβ deposition.
