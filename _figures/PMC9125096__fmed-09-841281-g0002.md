caption: Microbial tryptophan is catabolized on host physiology. With the help of
  dietary proteins, the tryptophan is released by the gut microbiome. This tryptophan−1,
  the kynurenine pathway; 2, serotonin pathway; 3, protein synthesis; 4, direct transformation.
  The microbiome-associated metabolic relationship was identified from fatty acids,
  lipids, amino acids, and metabolites.
