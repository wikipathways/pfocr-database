caption: Model of endothelial-derived IL-8 production induced by PCV2 in PIECs. Identification
  of PCV2 by RIG-I and MDA-5 activated a cascade of changes that led to the upregulation
  of MAVS and then stimulated the nuclei accumulation of JNK. As a result, endothelial-derived
  IL-8 was apparently upregulated. Knockdown of RIG-I, MDA-5 or MAVS using siRNA resulted
  in the negative modulation of endothelial-derived IL-8 secretion. Similar results
  were also obtained by the JNK inhibitor treatment. It shows that PCV2 can upregulate
  the production of endothelial-derived IL-8 in PIECs via the RIG-I/MDA-5/MAVS/JNK
  signaling pathway
