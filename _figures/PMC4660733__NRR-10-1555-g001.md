caption: 'Schematic representation of the formation and the regulation of intraspinal
  detour circuits following spinal cord injury.(A) Intraspinal detour circuit formation:
  Following thoracic hemisection, the hindlimb corticospinal tract sprouts collaterals
  into the cervical spinal cord. Those collaterals form synapses with long propriospinal
  neurons which in turn increase their contacts onto lumbar motoneurons thereby forming
  a new detour pathway that reconnects upper corticospinal projection neurons to lumbar
  motoneurons.(B) Effect of STAT3 overexpression on post-injury detour circuit formation
  (top panel) and post-injury compensatory midline sprouting fibers (bottom panel).
  Following thoracic hemisection and STAT3 overexpression using recombinant adeno-associated
  viruses (top panel), the hindlimb corticospinal tract sprouts more collaterals than
  in the control situation. Furthermore, following a unilateral lesion of the corticospinal
  tract at the level of the medulla oblongata, and STAT3 overexpression using recombinant
  adeno-associated viruses (bottom panel), midline crossing fibers emerge from the
  treated unlesioned corticospinal tract and re-innervate the denervated cervical
  spinal cord.(C) Perturbation of FGF22 signalling, using genetically deficient animals,
  decreases synapse formation and maturation during post-injury detour circuit formation.
  In turn this impairment in synapse formation triggers a decreased formation of detour
  circuits and leads to impairment functional recovery following spinal cord injury.
  This indicates that intact FGF22 signaling is an important requirement for efficient
  intraspinal axonal remodeling.'
