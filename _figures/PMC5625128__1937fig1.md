caption: 'Effects of NR activation in AD. The underlying mechanisms by which the activation
  of NRs exerts beneficial effects in AD are not completely understood. Nonetheless,
  a number of studies have been able to dissect some of these mechanisms, which seem
  to be cell type-specific, and can be grouped in four different classes: 1) Aβ clearance:
  mainly through modulation of Aβ phagocytosis and enzymatic degradation; 2) anti-inflammatory
  mechanisms: repression and induction of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes,
  respectively; 3) Aβ generation: modulation of APP processing by inhibiting BACE1
  production or by shifting to the nonamyloidogenic pathway by induction of ADAM10,
  reducing Aβ production in both cases; and 4) neuronal function: increased synaptic
  function, neurogenesis, dendritic development, and protection against neuronal insults.
  The overall effect of a particular NR agonist likely arises from the modulation
  of several different pathways, rather than only one particular mechanism, and it
  is also likely that many of the different mechanisms reported for a specific NR
  might be, to some extent, related to each other. AICD, APP intracellular domain;
  NCoR/SMRT, NCoR/silencing mediator of retinoic acid thyroid hormone receptors; κBRE,
  NF-κB response element; NRE, NR response element; sAPPβ, soluble APPβ fragment.'
