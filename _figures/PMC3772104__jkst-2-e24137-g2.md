caption: Figure 2. Proposed mechanism of JAK-STAT involvement in atopic dermatitis
  (AD) development, part II. Here, Th2 cells play a significant role. By their abilities
  to provide IL-4 and IL-5 stimulation via the JAK-STAT pathway, immature B cells
  could be differentiated into mature B cell and plasma cells would undergo antibody
  heavy chain switching to IgE class. The subsequent binding of IgE to skin mast cells
  could lead to release of histamine, which is known to exacerbate AD. Similarly,
  this hyper Th2 immune milieu, particularly IL-4, could trigger epidermal cells to
  produce and release various chemokines (such as CCL26), pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  and angiogenic factors, leading to AD pathophysiology. Moreover, IL-5 released from
  this hyper Th2 milieu could, through JAK-STAT pathway, activate eosinophils, and
  attract them to the skin via CCL26, further worsening the AD condition. In addition,
  by way of IL-31, an inducer of pruritus, AD symptoms could become increasingly intensified.
  Black arrows indicate activation pathway. Red lines indicate inhibition pathway.
