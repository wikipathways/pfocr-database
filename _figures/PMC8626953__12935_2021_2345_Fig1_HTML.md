caption: Schematic diagram of the study. Potential target genes were predicted and
  disease target genes were screened according to the structure of Que. Flow cytometry
  was used to detect the apoptotic effect of Que on breast tumor cells and IC50 was
  obtained by MTT method. PBMCs were isolated from peripheral blood of normal subjects
  by density gradient centrifugation. In vitro amplification was performed using anti-human
  TCR γδ monoclonal antibody and Que intervention. Flow cytometry was used to detect
  the changes of γδ T cell subsets. Que and γδ T cells were co-cultured with breast
  tumor cells, and the specific killing of γδ T cells on breast tumor cells was determined
  by flow cytometry. Finally, western blot was used to detect the expression of potentially
  related JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway proteins between Que and prebreast cancer
