caption: Hypothetical model depicting interaction between WW45 with hedgehog-Gli1
  signaling pathway. A. Schematic illustration of WW45 and Gli1 proteins. WW45 contains
  two WW domains and a short dehydrogenase domain (SDR). Gli1 composed of a combination
  of two PPxYs and a phospho-serine/proline motif in C-terminal region. B. WW45 interacts
  with transcription factors Gli1 and inhibits its translocation to the nucleus, hence
  suppressing its transactivation activity.
