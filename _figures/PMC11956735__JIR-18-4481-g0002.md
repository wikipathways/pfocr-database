caption: Platelet factor 4 (PF4) regulates several immune cells. (A) PF4 regulates
  T regulatory cells. 1). PF4 promotes the differentiation of monocytes into myeloid
  suppressor cells (MDSCs), which will inhibit CD8+ T cell. 2). At low concentrations
  (L), PF4 binds to TGFBRIII to amplify the TGFβ signaling pathway and enhance the
  response of CD4+ T cells. At high concentrations (H), PF4 directly binds to TGFBRII,
  hindering the interaction between TGFβ-TGFBRII and exerting the opposite regulatory
  effect. 3). PF4 inhibits the proliferation of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells while stimulating
  the proliferation of CD4+CD25− Treg cells. (B) PF4 regulates T helper cells. 1).
  PF4 inhibits the differentiation of Th17 cells in T helper cells (Th). 2). PF4 reduces
  the IFN-γ in Th1 and increase IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in Th2 at mRNA levels. (C) PF4
  regulates CD4+ memory T cells, including Tcm cells and Tem cells. PF4 activation
  of CXCR3 receptors enhances mitochondrial biosynthesis and leads to proliferation
  and activation of effector Th1 and Treg cells. (D) PF4 regulates phagocyte. 1).
  PF4 binds to the chemokine CCL5 and promotes the its differentiation into macrophages.
  2). PF4 acts as an agonist of the chemokine receptor CCR1 to promote human monocyte
  migration. 3). PF4 activates neutrophil adhesion through various intracellular signals
  and pathways. (E) PF4 regulates NK killer cells. PF4 has been shown to induce NK
  cell migration at certain concentrations. (F) PF4 regulates other immune cells,
  such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) and monocyte derived dendritic cells
  (MDDC)
