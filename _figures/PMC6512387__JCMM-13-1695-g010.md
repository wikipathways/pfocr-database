caption: Schematic drawing showing p38 MAPK activation‐loss of ΔΨm‐ROS generation
  signalling pathway in toxin‐γ‐induced cell death. p38 MAPK activation in toxin‐γ‐treated
  cells leads to down‐regulation of Bcl‐2 and translocation of Bax to the mitochondria,
  which alters subsequently mitochondrial membrane permeability in causing ROS generation.
  Moreover, toxin‐γ‐induced ROS generation further augments p38 MAPK activation and
  aggravates loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Finally, cytochrome c release
  activates caspase‐9 and ‐3, thus resulting in apoptotic death of U937 cells.
