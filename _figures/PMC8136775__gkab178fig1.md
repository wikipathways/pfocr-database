caption: (A) Different repair pathways for DSB lesions. Cells exhibit different pathways
  to respond to the deleterious DSB lesions. Canonical non-homologous end joining
  (cNHEJ) mediates the ligation between both broken ends in a low fidelity manner.
  During homologous recombination (HR), cells use a homologous sequence as a template,
  repairing the break in an error-free manner. Single strand annealing (SSA) uses
  longer stretches of homologous sequences in cis for repair whereas alternative end
  joining (aEJ) uses microhomologies, both resulting in inaccurate repair. (B) HR
  and its associated proteins. In S-G2 phase, cells can respond to toxic DSBs by means
  of HR. In this faithful pathway, the MRN complex together with CtIP initiates short-range
  resection of the 5' ends at both sides of the broken DNA. DNA2 nuclease and the
  interacting BLM helicase or EXO1 nuclease generate long filaments of ssDNA. This
  filament is then coated by RPA protein, which is rapidly exchanged by RAD51 recombinase
  with the help of BRCA2, in complex with BRCA1 and PALB2. This permits strand invasion
  of the sister chromatid to give rise to the D-loop needed for DNA synthesis and
  termination of the repair process.
