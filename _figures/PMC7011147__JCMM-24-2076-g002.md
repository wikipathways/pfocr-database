caption: Interactions between cells in the tumour microenvironment. A, Tumour and
  CAFs‐derived cytokines can recruit macrophages and then produce a large number of
  associated cytokines, such as EGF, VEGF and TGF‐β, and the high expression of HIF‐1
  and HIF‐2 promotes the formation of vascular mimicry. Angiopoietin Tie2 also makes
  some differences. B, The EMT of CTCs can promote the selective distal implantation
  of tumour. C, MDSCs in the pre‐metastatic microenvironment can promote further amplification
  through the S1PR1‐STATs signalling pathway. D, Tumour cells present autoantigens
  to DCs and regulate T cell differentiation, thus affecting tumour development through
  Treg cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells by immune actions. E, CAFs are abundant
  in tumour microenvironment and an important cytokines source
