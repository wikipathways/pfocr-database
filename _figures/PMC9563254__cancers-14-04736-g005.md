caption: PAK signaling in plasticity. (A) PAK and EMT. All of the PAK downstream proteins
  that are involved in EMT are listed in the corresponding boxes, and each following
  brackets indicate the sites of PAK phosphorylation. Overexpression of PAK leads
  to EMT, followed by invasion and metastasis, and after reaching the metastatic organ,
  PAK expression is decreased, and MET occurs. (B) PAK and stemness. The signaling
  pathway of PAK in the corresponding organ leads to a stem cell phenotype.
