caption: Exercise-induced myokines mediate organ cross-talk and improve cardiometabolic
  health. (A) The myokine IL-6 inhibits TNF-α (), reducing inflammation and protecting
  against the formation of atherosclerosis (); stimulates GLP-1 secretion causing
  improved insulin secretion (); increases lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in adipose
  tissue () and increases glucose uptake through the AMPK signaling pathway (, ).
  (B) Fstl1 decreases ischemic injury size through activation of the Akt/AMPK pathway
  (activating eNOS and enhancing revascularization) (, ) and early fibroblast stimulation
  (which aids in repair after ischemia-reperfusion) (). (C) Myonectin (MyoN) increases
  fatty acid uptake in adipocytes and hepatocytes (), and promotes protects against
  ischemic injury in the heart, possibly through Akt activation (). (D) NDNF improves
  survival after myocardial infarction (MI) by reducing apoptosis () through stimulation
  of the Akt/AMPK/eNOS pathway (enhancing revascularization) ().
