caption: 'The IL-23 production and signaling pathway in the context of inflammatory
  bowel disease pathogenesis. Figure Legend: this figure illustrates the molecular
  mechanisms underlying IL-23 production and signaling and their central role in the
  immunopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The intestinal microbiome
  and its interaction with innate immune cells (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells)
  are crucial in shaping immune responses. Microbe-derived signals stimulate these
  cells to produce cytokines, such as IL-23, that influence T cell polarization and
  perpetuate inflammation in the gut mucosa. IL-23 is produced primarily by antigen-presenting
  cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages upon stimulation by microbial components.
  Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), occurs through pattern recognition receptors,
  including TLR4 and NOD2. This activation leads to the recruitment of adaptor molecules
  (e.g., MyD88, IRAK1/4, and RIP2) and the activation of downstream kinases such as
  TAK1. The signaling cascade culminates in the activation of transcription factors
  NF-κB and AP-1, which translocate to the nucleus and induce the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, including IL-12 (composed of p35 and p40 subunits) and IL-23 (composed
  of p19 and p40 subunits). The pathway also integrates input from the purinergic
  receptor P2R and inhibitory feedback mechanisms mediated by IL-10. However, genetic
  mutations affecting IL-10 or its receptor can impair this anti-inflammatory signaling,
  contributing to unchecked IL-23 expression. IL-23 secretion plays a pivotal role
  in sustaining inflammatory responses, particularly via its effects on Th17 cells
  and neutrophil recruitment. The IL-23 signaling pathway begins when IL-23 binds
  to its heterodimeric receptor complex, consisting of IL-23R and IL-12Rβ1. This engagement
  activates the associated Janus kinases (JAK2 and TYK2), leading to phosphorylation
  and activation of the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT4. Phosphorylated STAT3
  dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, where it promotes the transcription of
  pro-inflammatory effector molecules including IL-17A, IL-22, IFN-γ, and REG3G. These
  cytokines and antimicrobial peptides contribute to mucosal immune defense but also
  play pathogenic roles in the chronic inflammation observed in IBD. Created using
