caption: 'Proposed mechanisms for the neuroprotective effects of Coff/Caff plus Mel
  in N2a/APP cells.Notes: The combination of Coff/Caff plus Mel promotes the phosphorylation
  of PI3K and Erk1/2 and suppresses the phosphorylation of GSK3β, Akt, and Tau in
  N2a/APP cells. Moreover, the combinations repress Wnt and ROS signaling, with reduction
  in the expression level of Wnt3α and Nrf2 and intracellular ROS level. At last,
  the combinations decreased the extracellular level of Aβ oligomers, which are neurotoxic.Abbreviations:
  APP, amyloid precursor protein; Caff, caffeine; Coff, coffee; Mel, melatonin; N2a,
  Neuro-2a; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; Aβ,
  amyloid-β.'
