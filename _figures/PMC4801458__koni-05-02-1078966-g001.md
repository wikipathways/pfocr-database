caption: 'BRAF (V600E) mediates immune suppression and evasion through multiple mechanisms
  in melanoma. The acquisition of a somatic BRAF(V600E) mutation is an early event
  during melanomagenesis and leads to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling
  pathway. This promotes: (1) Increased internalization and endosomal sequestration
  of HLA class I molecules, directly reducing surface expression and tumor-cell recognition
  by cytotoxic T cells; (2) Upregulation of chemokines CXCL8, CCL2, and IL-1, which
  can attract myeloid cell subsets including monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages,
  as well as tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) into the tumor microenvironment (TME);
  (3) Transcription and expression of IL-1α/β, IL-6, and VEGF, which can condition
  the cells of the TME. IL-1α/β production by tumor cells can promote T-cell suppression
  by inducing the expression of programmed death (PD)-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on
  TAFs, in addition to increasing COX-2 transcription and PGE2 upregulation. VEGF
  can inhibit myeloid cell maturation, in addition to directly promoting the functional
  inhibition of T cells through VEGFR2.'
