caption: In normal cells which are proficient in homologous recombination (HRP), both
  base excision repair (BER) and HR are available for the repair of damaged DNA via
  poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and proteins encoded by HR deficiency (HRD)-related
  genes, respectively (a). In cells with HRD, HR is nonfunctional and leads to carcinogenesis
  (b). When PARP is inhibited by PARP inhibitor, cancer cells with HRD are unable
  to repair DNA damage by HR and BER, resulting in cell death (synthetic lethality)
  (c).
