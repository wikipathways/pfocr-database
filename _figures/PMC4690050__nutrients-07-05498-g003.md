caption: 'Metabogenic and nutriceutical supplements to promote bioenergetical potential
  and moderate muscle wasting in DMD. Dystrophin-deficient muscle is characterised
  by the inability to produce sufficient ATP to buffer increased (Ca2+), limit degeneration
  and to fuel regeneration. Addition of ATP precursors (amino acids, ASA, creatine
  and ribose) would expand the potential energy pool and subsequently increase ATP
  production through stimulation of the various metabolic pathways. An additional
  benefit of AAs would be to augment muscle protein synthesis and inhibit macroautophagy
  via direct stimulation of mTOR. Limiting the loss of adenine nucleotides via allopurinol
  would further expand the potential energy pool and mitigate the need for energy-consuming
  de novo ATP synthesis. Buffering of ROS-mediated (CoQ10/Idebenone, polyphenols and
  taurine) and Ca2+-induced muscle damage (creatine and taurine) and stimulation of
  mitochondrial biogenesis (polyphenols) would limit energy expenditure on regeneration
  and augment bioenergetical expansion of dystrophic skeletal muscle. Figure abbreviations:
  ADP—adenosine diphosphate; AMP—adenosine monophoshate; AMPK—adenosine monophophate
  activated protein kinase; ASA—adenylosuccinic acid; ATP—adenosinie triphosphate;
  Ca2+—calcium; CK—creatine kinase; Cr—creatine; Mi-CK—mitochondrial creatine kinase;
  mTOR—mammalian target of rapamycin; PCr—phosphocreatine; PGC-1α—peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha; Pi—inorganic phosphate; PNC—purine nucleotide
  cycle; PNS—purine nucleotide salvage pathway; ROS—reactive oxygen species; TCA—tricarboxylic
