caption: Conversion of glucose to erythritol via the pentose phosphate pathway. Stable
  isotope tracers indicated that glucose was converted to erythritol through the pentose
  phosphate pathway in human cells (). Here we demonstrate that the substrate for
  erythritol synthesis is erythrose, not erythrose-4-phosphate and that the required
  cofactor in human cells is NADPH. In addition, this reaction is catalyzed by ADH1
  and SORD. F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; G6P, glucose
  6-phosphate; R5P, ribose 5-phosphate; S7P, sedoheptulose 7-phosphate; X5P, xylulose
  5-phosphate.
