caption: Overview of signaling pathways affected by hSDC1 overexpression in DEN-induced
  hepatocarcinogenesis. EGF interacts with shed SDC1 through binding to HS to create
  a ternary complex with EGFR that triggers its activation. Decreased activity of
  receptor tyrosine kinases such as MET, PDGFR, insulin receptor, and AXL, and most
  likely of Wnt, may result from increased SDC1 shedding, as growth factors bound
  to the HS chains of SDC1 are removed from the vicinity of their receptors. Consequently,
  the activities of PIKC3, PDK1, and Akt are downregulated. Although the mechanism
  of Akt pSer473 downregulation by mTORC2 requires further investigation, downregulation
  of insulin receptors or PDGFR are likely candidates. Impaired activity of Akt is
  indicated by decreased inactivating phosphorylation of GSK3, Foxo1 and IkB. The
  mTOR pathway is further inhibited via feedback phosphorylation of mTOR by pS6K.
  Upregulation of CaMKII and decrease in Rac interferes with the noncanonical pathway
  of β-catenin. Besides their implication in cell metabolism, both Foxo1 and p53 upregulate
  the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27. Together with the downregulation of c-myc and cyclinD1,
  the overall outcome of these events is the inhibition of cell proliferation.
