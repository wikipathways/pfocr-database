caption: 'a | Shown are promising drug candidates currently in preclinical and clinical
  development, including the development of regimens that combine repurposed, repositioned
  and new drug classes. Approved drugs are indicated by an asterisk (delamanid was
  approved by the EMA only, and pretomanid was approved by the FDA for use in the
  bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid regimen). Drugs are colour coded by chemical class
  and target pathway. For a complete list of published candidates currently in the
  pipeline, from early preclinical development to regulatory approval, and a review
  of their mechanism of action, see Working Group on New TB Drugs and ref. b | A simplified
  version of the cell envelope and the cytoplasmic membrane of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  is shown with schematized versions of the targets of recently approved drugs and
  clinical candidates, with novel mechanisms of action, listed in part a. The majority
  of novel targets are membrane associated. The diarylquinolines bedaquiline, TBAJ-876
  and TBAJ-587 target the ATP synthase. The nitroimidazoles pretomanid and delamanid
  exhibit a dual mode of action under low and normal oxygen tension, poison multiple
  essential pathways, and are bactericidal against replicating and non-replicating
  mycobacteria. SQ109 and the MPL series are the most advanced among a broad panel
  of agents targeting MmpL3, involved in export of trehalose monomycolate, a mycolic
  acid component. Three chemically distinct series all target DprE1: OPC167832, TBA7371
  and BTZ043 (ref.). Both MmpL3 and DprE1 are unique to mycobacteria. GSK656 is the
  first oxaborole in clinical development targeting a mycobacterial tRNA synthetase
  and GSK286 is a new chemical entity with a novel mechanism of action related to
  cholesterol catabolism. Part b adapted from ref., Springer Nature Limited.'
