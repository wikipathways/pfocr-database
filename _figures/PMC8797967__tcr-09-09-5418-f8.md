caption: Schematic diagram of the FTH-mediated pathway. FTH knockdown induced a significant
  reduction in the level of S100A4, S100A2, and S100P, which participate in EMT. It
  is reasonable to speculate that the low expression of FTH in PC3 cells causes a
  decrease in the expression of the S100 protein family members, which are related
  to cell migration, accompanied by a decrease in tumor cell migration ability.
