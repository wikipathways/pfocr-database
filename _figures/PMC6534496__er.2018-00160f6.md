caption: Outline of the main altered pathways in SiNETs. Pathway members whose genetic
  alteration has been proven are shaded in red, and those inactivated by epigenetics
  are in green. Approved targeted drugs are shaded in orange. The mTOR pathway is
  detected to be altered mainly via gene amplifications (PIK3CD, AKT1, mTOR, SRC,
  MAP2K2, PDGFR2) and epigenetically by hypermethylation of a large set of genes [represented
  by the green shade, described in Karpathakis et al. (, )]. RASSF1A downregulation
  by hypermethylation and SMAD4 loss may foster the Wnt pathway, which is however
  contrasted by CTNNB1 methylation and miR-196a hyperexpression, with the latter repressing
  transcription of Wnt pathway genes. The cell cycle is involved in CDKN1B-mutated
  tumors whereas UCHL1, a TP53 stabilizer, is lost in metastatic tumors by methylation.
  MUTYH, OGG1, and IPMK mutations involve familial cases, whereas the role of miRNA
  and chromatin deregulation is currently unclear.
