caption: Schematic diagram of the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway.
  In the canonical pathway, on the left, the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF),
  tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
  to their respective receptors lead to the phosphorylation of inhibitor of κB (IκB)-kinase
  β (IKKβ) in the IKK complex, which in turn phosphorylates IκBα, culminating in its
  polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The free NF-κB homo- or heterodimers,
  in this case p65/p50, then translocate into the nucleus to bind to κB motif and
  promote target gene transcription. The non-canonical pathway, on the right, is activated
  by the binding of lymphtoxin β (LTβ), CD40 ligand (CD40L), and B-cell activating
  factor (BAFF) to their respective receptors, causing IKKα dimers phosphorylation
  by the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). Phosphorylation of p100 by activated IKKα initiates
  proteasomal processing of p100 N-terminal to form p52. The p52/RelB heterodimers
  can then undergoes nuclear translocation and modulates the gene transcription of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines in a feedback-loop way.
