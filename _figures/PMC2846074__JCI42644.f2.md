caption: ACEI enters the interstitium from the systemic circulation and inhibits degradation
  of BK by ACE. Increased BK signaling through the B2R leads to chymase release, creating
  an alternative pathway for Ang II generation and contributing to adverse cardiac
  tissue remodeling. Inhibition of B2R signaling by Hoe-140 prevents ACEI-induced
  chymase release and suppresses Ang II formation. Similarly, LV function is improved
  by inhibition of chymase in conjunction with ACEI.
