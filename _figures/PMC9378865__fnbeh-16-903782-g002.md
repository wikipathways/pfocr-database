caption: Proposed mechanism of stress-induced neuroplasticity in the anterodorsolateral
  BNST. In the stressed brain, alterations to CRF G-protein coupled receptors alter
  sensitivity to CRF binding in undetermined ways. BNST CRFR1 expression is reduced
  and CRFR2 expression is increased, resulting in altered sensitivity to CRF binding
  from external projections, such as the CeA. Binding triggers a signaling cascade
  resulting in increased PKA, which promotes phosphorylation of glutamate receptor
  GluR1 and phosphorylation of the KCNQ channel. These parallel phosphorylation pathways
  increase excitability in the ovBNST by increasing mEPSCs and resting membrane potential,
  respectively. A second pathway regulates CRF signaling, wherein stress increases
  CRF mRNA, increases upstream regulator PACAP and its receptor PAC1, and decreases
  upstream inhibitor STEP mRNA and protein production. Increased excitability in ovBNST
  likely increases GABAergic inhibition of anterodorsal BNST subnuclei that project
  to the hypothalamus, disinhibiting the PVN. The PVN then releases increased levels
  of CRF to the anterior pituitary, which activates the stress response in the body.
