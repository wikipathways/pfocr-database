caption: (A) The wild-type CARD9 protein consists of an N-terminal caspase activation
  and recruitment domain (CARD) followed by a coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal
  tail. The C-terminus mediates binding to the ubiquitin ligase TRIM62, which ubiquitinates
  CARD9 at K125. The CARD9S12N variant encoded by an IBD risk-associated SNP carries
  an amino acid substitution in the N-terminal portion of the CARD domain (indicated
  by the red arrowhead). The rare variant CARD9Δ11 results from the skipping of exon
  11, and instead of the amino acids 454–536, it bears a shortened and altered C-terminus
  (indicated in green) that is unable to bind to TRIM62. (B) Fungi are sensed by myeloid
  cells through Dectin-1, which is phosphorylated by SRC-family kinases (SFK) in its
  cytoplasmic portion upon ligand binding. The spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) can recognize
  these phosphosites and activate the protein kinase C (PKC) δ and VAV proteins, which
  cooperate to phosphorylate CARD9, enabling it to assemble the CARD9-BCL10-MALT1
  (CBM) complex. K27 ubiquitination of CARD9 by TRIM62 enables the activation of NF-κB,
  which consists of the transcriptionally active subunits c-Rel, p65 and RelB. RelB
  is counterregulated by the proteolytic activity of MALT1. Cytokines produced after
  stimulation of this pathway include IL-6, TNF and pro-IL-1β, which is further processed
  and released by inflammasomes that are triggered in a SYK- and reactive oxygen species
  (ROS)-dependent manner. Pro-IL-18 is similarly processed and released by the inflammasome.
