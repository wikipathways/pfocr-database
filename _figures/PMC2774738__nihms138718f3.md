caption: Lineages are indicated with black arrows, inductive interactions are marked
  with green arrows, and inhibitory interactions are marked in red. Briefly, the Notch
  signaling pathway, along with Sox2 and Eya1, is believed to direct otocyst cells
  towards a prosensory fate. Next, an undetermined number of prosensory cells become
  positive for Atoh1, possibly through activation of Fgfr1. Sox2 and Id1, 2, and 3
  act to limit the number of cells that become Atoh1 positive. Cells that have begun
  to develop as hair cells express Jag2, Dll1, and Dll3, leading to activation of
  Notch1 and the downstream targets Hes1, Hes5, Hey1, Hey2, and Heyl in neighboring
  prosensory cells. Notch activation inhibits these cells from developing as hair
  cells. At the same time, hair cells also generate largely unknown inductive signals
  that recruit neighboring cells to develop as supporting cells. Pillar cell formation
  is dependent on an inductive interaction between Fgf8, expressed in inner hair cells,
  and Fgfr3, expressed in progenitor cells, possibly acting through Hey2. Finally,
  activation of the Hedgehog pathway, possibly mediated through expression of Shh
  in neuroblasts, acts to inhibit non-sensory cells from moving into the prosensory
  lineage.
