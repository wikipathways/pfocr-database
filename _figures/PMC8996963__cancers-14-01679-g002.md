caption: Periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT) inflammation in obesity and metabolic
  syndrome worsens the prostatic cancer phenotype via several pathways involving activation
  of the thrombotic cascade. Increased PPAT thickness is associated with multiple
  changes, including the activation of the clotting pathway. In addition to prostatic
  cancer being a hypercoagulable state, further activation of thrombin evoked by the
  adipose inflammatory condition allows for increased macrophage infiltration and
  exacerbation of their shift to the M1 polarization with an increased production
  of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, thrombin evokes an increase in PPAT lipolysis
  with the resultant free fatty acids contributing to increased prostatic oxidative
  stress and inflammatory signaling. Evidence support a role for clotting factor inhibition
  in attenuating such changes.
