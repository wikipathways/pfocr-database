caption: Several triggers such as overexpression of oncogenes, telomere dysfunction
  or attrition, and genotoxic stress, which includes discodermolide treatment, promote
  the increased activity of p53. P53 activity and stability is negatively regulated
  by MDM2 (Murine double minute 2) under normal conditions. Under stress conditions,
  the DNA damage response is activated and p53 rapidly accumulates to increase the
  transcription of target genes that will promote either apoptosis or senescence depending
  on the severity of the damage response.
