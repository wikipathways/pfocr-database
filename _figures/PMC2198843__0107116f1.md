caption: Adhesion regulation of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of signaling molecules.
  CAMs regulate the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking by several mechanisms. Firstly,
  cadherins, β2 integrins, and syndecans directly act as cytoplasmic anchors for β-catenin,
  JAB1, and CASK, respectively. Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin may also be regulated
  by the integrin-linked kinase pathway. In the nucleus, β-catenin interacts with
  the TCF family member LEF-1 to regulate expression of genes, such as c-Myc and cyclin
  D1. JAB1 interacts with c-Jun containing AP-1 complexes, and enhances transactivation
  from AP-1–dependent promoters. CASK binds DNA in a complex with Tbr-1 to induce
  transcription of genes important in cerebrocortical development. Second, protein
  complexes associated with sites of adhesion act as sinks for a variety of proteins,
  for example zyxin, that contain LIM domains and traffic to the nucleus. Additionally,
  integrin-mediated adhesion and an intact actin cytoskeleton are important in controlling
  efficient ERK nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and phosphorylation of downstream transcription
  factors.
