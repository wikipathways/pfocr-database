caption: Model for biosynthesis of MccE492 showing that enterobactin is a precursor
  and that the MccE492 siderophore-peptide is the mature form of the microcin. After
  translation, MceA (the MccE492 precursor protein) is subjected to posttranslational
  modification at the C-terminal serine. The synthesis of enterobactin (Ent) is performed
  by the aroABCDEFGHKL (shikimate pathway; boxed)- and entABCDEF-encoded machineries.
  Ent is the precursor of posttranslational modification biosynthesis, which most
  likely starts with MceC, a putative C-glucosyltransferase. The resulting Glc-Ent
  is then converted into linear Glc-DHBS3 by MceD, a putative enterobactin esterase,
  and transferred onto the carboxylate of the MceA C-terminal serine. This last step
  is believed to involve MceI, MceJ, and maybe MceC. MccE492 then results from the
  cleavage of the N-terminal leader peptide of MceA-Glc-DHBS3 during export (the MceG/MceH/TolC
  export machinery is represented by gray spheres in the membrane). MccE492 intermediate
  forms (u-MccE492-Glc-DHBS and u-MccE492-Glc-DHBS2) are thought to result from further
  hydrolysis of MceA-Glc-DHBS3 (MceD enzymatic activity), cleavage of the leader peptide,
  and subsequent export. u-MccE492 results from MceA leader cleavage and subsequent
  export under certain culture conditions. The mceABCDEHGHIJ gene cluster is presented
  (inset). Genes involved (or supposed to be) in the synthesis, posttranslational
  modification, and export of MccE492 are shown as plain black arrows, black hatched
  arrows, and gray arrows, respectively. IM and OM, inner membrane and outer membrane,
  respectively.
