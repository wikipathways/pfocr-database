caption: The increased expression of FABP4 in LSECs may represent a potential target
  for liver injury. Under certain conditions, the upregulated expression of FABP4
  in LSECs activates the NF-κB/CXCL10 pathway, which leads to the recruitment of CXCR3+
  macrophages and induces their polarization towards the M1 phenotype. This polarization
  leads to the release of a significant amount of proinflammatory mediators, such
  as TNF-α and IL-6, which continuously exacerbate the immune response. Conversely,
  the M2 phenotype of macrophages secretes anti-inflammatory factors, preventing excessive
  immune reactions
