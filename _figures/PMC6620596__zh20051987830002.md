caption: STAT3 signaling pathway and inhibition approaches. Upon binding of a cytokine
  or growth factor to its appropriate receptor, JAK kinases are phosphorylated and
  activated, leading to phosphorylation of an intracellular receptor tyrosine residue.
  Free STAT3 proteins are recruited to receptor and dock to the phosphotyrosine residue
  of the receptor, where they are phosphorylated before dissociating from the receptor.
  Phosphorylated STAT3 proteins dimerize and undergo nuclear translocation, where
  they regulate target gene expression. Physiological regulation is achieved by suppressor
  of cytokine signaling (SOCS) and protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3), which
  block JAK kinase activity and DNA binding, respectively. Protein tyrosine phosphatase
  (PTPs) catalyze the dissociation of activated STAT3 dimers via dephosphorylation.
  Targets of pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 signaling at the levels of the receptor,
  kinase, STAT3 protein, and Stat3 mRNA are shown. Drugs labeled in green have specifically
  been evaluated in the treatment of kidney disease.
