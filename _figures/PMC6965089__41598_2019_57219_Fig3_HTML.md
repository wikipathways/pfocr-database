caption: 'DEGs mapped to the plant hormone signaling transduction pathways in leaves.
  (a) Auxin signaling pathway, (b) ABA signaling pathway and (c) ethylene signaling
  pathway. Upper and lower color box indicate difference between 3.75‰ and the control,
  between 7.5‰ and the control, respectively. Red: up-regulated compared with the
  control. Green: down-regulated compared with the control.'
