caption: Pathways initiated by ACSL, FATP, and ACSBG isoforms. In addition to initiating
  the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) and all the glycerophospholipids, acyl-CoAs
  are required for the synthesis of cholesterol esters, ceramide and sphingolipids,
  for fatty acid (FA) degradation pathways and for FA modification pathways of elongation
  and desaturation. Intermediates in the glycerolipid synthetic pathway, lysophosphatidic
  acid (LPA), phosphatidic acid (PA), and diacylglycerol (DAG) are intracellular signals.
  Both FA and acyl-CoAs are also intracellular signals and regulators of cellular
  physiology as well as purported ligands for PPAR and HNF4α transcription factors.
  G-3-P, glycerol-3-phosphate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol;
  CL, cardiolipin; PE phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine.
