caption: During neurodegeneration, critical pro-inflammatory and oxidative molecular
  pathways are involved in the occurrence of neurodegenerative conditions. However,
  protective anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways may improve neurofunction.
  Imbalances between these two sets of events may predispose to protein deposition
  and diseases related to the brain. Ginkgolides are essential in combating various
  inflammatory substances such as, for example, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
  tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β),
  cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB). Furthermore, it also inhibits adhesion factors such
  as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule
  1 (VCAM-1), reducing inflammatory processes in the brain, as these are essential
  factors for the action of defense cells. Curcumin, in turn, reduces reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) formation through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid-2
  related factor 2/heme oxygenase (Nrf2/HO-1) signaling pathway, which eliminates
  free radicals and positively modulates the regulation of silent mating type 2 homolog
  1 (SIRT1) information, preventing neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Finally,
  limonene can attenuate locomotor deficits in Parkinson’s disease (PD) by inhibiting
  rotenone (ROT), which, when expressed, induces the inhibition of complex-1 of the
  mitochondrial electron transport chain, causing a syndrome replicating PD’s neuropathological
  and behavioral symptoms. It also inhibits abnormal protein deposition, preventing
  mitochondrial function impairments and inducing apoptosis of abnormal cells
