caption: Mechanism of HDAC3-dependent expression of STING in β-estradiol-ERα-mediated
  endometrial tumorigenesis. In endometrial cancer, the stimulation of interferon
  genes STING decreased in EC, which is a key regulator of cell proliferation, apoptosis,
  and fate. Activating the STING signaling pathway can decrease proliferation and
  induce apoptosis in EC cells. Moreover, HDAC3-selective inhibition preferentially
  inhibits proliferation, facilitates apoptosis in EC, and derepresses STING expression,
  whereas β-estradiol-ERα, one of the highest risk factors of EC, might facilitate
  the repression of STING. In endometrial cancer cells, knockdown or inhibition of
  the HDAC3 by an HDAC3-selective inhibitor RGFP966 increases STING expression, thereby
  inhibiting tumorigenesis. Mechanically, we identified that β-estradiol-ERα recruited
  HDAC3 and induced the deacetylation of histone 3 lysine 4 by binding to the STING
  promoter, thereby reducing the expression of STING. These findings suggest a novel
  molecular mechanism underlying HDAC3, and the subsequent STING suppression constitutes
  an important regulatory loop that promotes ERα-driven endometrial tumorigenesis,
  and the use of HDAC3-selective inhibitors may be an effective treatment for endometrial
  cancer.
