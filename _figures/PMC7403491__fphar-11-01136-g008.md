caption: Schematic of pathways involved in Trimetazidine (TMZ)-mediated EMT inhibition
  in DN. In diabetic environment, ROS pathway and TGFβ/Smad pathway together induce
  tubule epithelial cells (TECs) to produce EMT. TMZ inhibits EMT generation by suppressing
  these two pathways via upregulating Sirt1 expression in TECs in DN (Sirt1 inhibits
  the ROS pathway by deacetylating FoxO1, and inhibits TGFβ/Smad pathway by deacetylating
  Smad4). Both the expression and activity of Sirt1 are regulated by NAD+. The generation
  of NAD+ depends on de novo synthesis and salvage pathway, and the latter is its
  main source. Nampt is the rate-limiting enzyme of the salvage pathway. TMZ promotes
  NAD+ production in DN by up-regulating Nampt expression. In conclusion, TMZ inhibits
  EMT generation by upregulating Sirt1 expression depending on Nampt/NAD+pathway in
  DN.
