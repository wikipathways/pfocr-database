caption: Predicted flagellar synthesis pathway in V. fischeri. The V. fischeri model
  of flagella gene regulation is based on the pathway elucidated in the related microbe,
  V. cholerae (). Class I consists solely of the regulator, FlrA, which, together
  with σ54, controls expression of Class II genes. Class II proteins include both
  those necessary for building the base of the flagellum and also the regulators FlrB,
  FlrC and σ28(FliA). FlrB and FlrC control transcription of Class III genes necessary
  for synthesis of the distal basal body, hook, and filament, while σ28 regulates
  transcription of Class IV genes involved in the production of motor proteins and
  other miscellaneous factors. Regulators in red indicate they are important for V.
  fischeri to colonize the squid (, ; ; ).
