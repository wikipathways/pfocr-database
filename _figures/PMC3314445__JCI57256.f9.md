caption: (A) AβOs stimulate TNF-α signaling, which activates the JNK pathway and,
  possibly, PKR and IKK pathways. Activation of these stress-sensitive kinases, which
  can also be triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress (), results in serine phosphorylation
  of IRS-1, blocking downstream insulin signaling. (B) Stimulation of insulin and
  GLP1 receptors blocks AβO-induced defects in insulin signaling. Binding of exendin-4
  to GLP1 receptors and of insulin to IRs prevented activation of JNK, allowing physiological
  tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and stimulating downstream insulin signaling.
  In both panels, red arrows indicate inhibitory pathways and green arrows indicate
  stimulatory pathways of insulin signaling. I, insulin.
