caption: 'Apoptotic effect of amygdalin via multiple cellular signaling pathways.
  Amygdalin activates p38MAPK, which affects death stimuli: activates Bax apoptotic
  proteins, and inhibits Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic proteins. Apoptosis-related proteins
  induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a decisive event in
  the process of cytochrome c release. Activation of the release of cytochrome c as
  a mitochondrial response to proapoptotic stimuli via the mitochondrial or intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway ultimately leads to activation of caspases including caspase-3,
  which induces apoptosis. Amygdalin induces ROS overproduction, which compromises
  oxidative balance and eventually leads to apoptosis. Amygdalin down-regulates cyclin-dependent
  kinase 2 (CDK2) and cyclin A, which induces cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Amygdalin
  also inhibits cell transfer from G1 to S phase resulting in the inhibition of cell
  proliferation and growth. ‘Activation’ shown by red arrows and ‘inhibition’ showed
  by black arrows.'
