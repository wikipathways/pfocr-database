caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for the diazo chlorinated meroterpenoids 6–8[]
  and their relation to the chlorinated dihydroquinones such as 4 and 5. A summation
  of the two [1,2-13C2]acetate labeling patterns are shown in black (bold lines and
  dots signify double and single enrichments, respectively). Enrichment from L-[methyl-13C]methionine
  is shown as a dashed line, and enrichment from [15N]nitrite or [15N]nitrate is shown
  in bold font.
