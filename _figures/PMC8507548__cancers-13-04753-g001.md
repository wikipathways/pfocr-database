caption: Tumor-Intrinsic NLRP3 Inflammasome Promotes Adaptive Resistance to Anti-PD-1
  Immunotherapy. A PD-L1:STAT3:PKR pathway triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  in response to anti-PD-1-mediated CD8+ T cell activation []. In line with previous
  work, our studies have shown that PD-L1 cytoplasmic signaling inhibits STAT3 and
  that this process de-inhibits PKR kinase activity to lead to NLRP3 activation [,].
  A TLR4-Wnt5a-CXCL5 autocrine pathway promotes PMN-MDSC recruitment in response to
  tumor NLRP3-dependent release of HSP70. Created with BioRender.com.
