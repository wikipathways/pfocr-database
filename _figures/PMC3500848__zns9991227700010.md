caption: Model for ERK1/2 phosphorylation of ICs regulating cytoplasmic dynein binding
  to endosomes in response to neurotrophin. The Trk kinase is a transmembrane neurotrophin
  (NT) receptor resides in the plasma membrane (PM). Neurotrophin binding induces
  Trk autophosphorylation on the cytoplasmic tail and internalization as a signaling
  endosome (SE), with neurotrophin remaining bound to the Trk. Downstream of Trk,
  Ras is activated by GTP binding, and it activates Raf, which activates MEK, which
  phosphorylates and activates the ERK1/2 MAP kinase. ERK1/2 phosphorylates the cytoplasmic
  dynein IC-1 and IC-2. This enhances dynein binding to the signaling endosome through
  a factor (green box) in addition to dynactin.
