caption: 'Summary diagram of Nrf2 and HIF1 stimulation in presence of oxidative stress.
  In the presence of ROS, generated by IPC, PKC will become activated to phosphorylate
  Nrf2 at the Serine 40 residue. This particular residue is the critical site of PKC
  control, although other kinases can phosphorylate additional sites on Nrf2. Nrf2
  will then dissociate from its cytosolic repressor, Keap1, and translocate to the
  nucleus. Upon binding to ARE, Nrf2 transcribes several genes including those for
  energy regulation, mitochondria biogenesis, and antioxidant expression. Under normal
  or high oxygen tension, Nrf2 remains bound to Keap1, and is eventually targeted
  for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The pathway on the right describes
  activation of HIF1 in the presence of ROS. The inducible subunit of HIF1, HIF1α,
  is regulated by PHD. Under normal oxygen levels, PHD will hydroxylate HIF1α. This
  allows VHL to ubiquitinate HIF1α and target it for proteasomal degradation. However,
  in the presence of oxidative stress, PHD is inactivated and HIF1α can translocate
  to the nucleus. In the nucleus, HIF1α binds to the constitutively expressed HIF1β
  subunit, and together these subunits form the functional HIF1 factor. This factor
  then binds to HRE on the genome and transcribes several genes involved in hypoxic
  adaptation, including genes for energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and red blood cell
  production. Nrf2: Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2; Keap1: Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1; PHD: Prolyl hydroxylase; HIF: Hypoxic Inducible Factor;
