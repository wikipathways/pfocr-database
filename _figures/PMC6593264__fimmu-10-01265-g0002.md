caption: Dual aspects of GM-CSF immunomodulatory effects. GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived
  dendritic cells, which co-express OX40L and Jagged-1 (Jag-1), expand regulatory
  T cells (Tregs). Also, GM-CSF is associated with a selective expansion of CD11c+CD8a−,
  CD103+, CX3CR1−, and CD11c+,CD11b+ DCs. The interaction of GM-CSF with CD116 on
  Tregs and iNKT cells improves immune tolerance. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells
  (MoDCs) are generated in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4. These cells are capable
  of producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa, IL-6, and IL-12. GM-CSF induces
  the M1 macrophages phenotype that produces inflammatory cytokines. In addition,
  GM-CSF is an essential factor for the secretion of IL-23 by DCs in a CCR4- dependent
  pathway. Th1/Th17 cells are induced by IL-23, IL-1β in mice and IL-1 β, IL-12 in
  humans. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells also express GM-CSF and a subset of these cells,
  called Tc17, produce IL-17 cells, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-21, IL-22, and GM-CSF. Treg,
  Regulatory T cell; iNKT, Invariant natural killer T cells; Th1/Th17, T helper 1/17
  cells; TNFa, Tumor necrosis factor alpha.
