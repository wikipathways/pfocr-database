caption: 'FASN-regulated ERα signaling in breast cancer cells: a working model. Scheme
  showing a hypothetical model for FASN inhibition-induced regulation of E2/ERα signaling
  in breast cancer. MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT non-genomic cross-talk with E2-activated
  ERα signaling mediates a variety of cellular responses including proliferation,
  survival, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Although activation of the MAPK pathway
  is generally associated with increased cell proliferation, an increasing number
  of studies have shown that prolonged MAPK/ERK activation can induce the expression
  of CDKIs, such as p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27Kip1, leading to growth inhibition. Phosphorylation
  of ERα by kinases such as ERK1/2 significantly enhances the transcriptional activity
  of ERα, a known transcriptional activator of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27Kip1. The ability
  of C75-induced FASN inhibition to activate non-genomic ERα/MAPK cross-talk might
  therefore synergistically activate ERα-regulated tumor suppressive responses to
  block E2-promoted cell proliferation (1). C75-induced FASN inhibition simultaneously
  leads to the suppression of AKT activity, another non-genomic cross-talk mechanism
  with ERα, underlying the E2-stimulated anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer
  cells (2), meanwhile, C75-induced FASN blockade also causes ERα knockdown likely
  via degradation through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway and/or inhibition
  of ERα gene expression (3).'
