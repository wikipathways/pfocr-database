caption: (a) Fatty acid composition in sesame seed. (b) Correlation of phenotypic
  variation for oil content and composition. (c) The simplified lipid metabolic pathway.
  The pathway is modified from Arabidopsis and maize. The candidate causative genes
  discovered for the variation of fatty acid synthesis in sesame germplasm are highlighted
  in red. The dotted lines represent multiple reaction steps. The plastid, endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and oil body are marked with light orange, light blue and yellow,
  respectively.
