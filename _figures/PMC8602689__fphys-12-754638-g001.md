caption: Simplified schema describing ATP generation and export from human RBCs. Glycolysis
  via the Embden–Meyerhof pathway (EMP; in blue on right side of the RBC cartoon)
  is the principal path to ATP generation in RBCs. EMP activity and ATP (and DPG)
  generation are favored under low-oxygen conditions, in which membrane-resident AE1
  (anion exchanger 1, aka band 3) binds deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), freeing up the
  glycolytic enzyme complex (metabolon) that associates with AE1 when not bound by
  Hb (i.e., when Hb is oxygenated; pink symbols in upper left of the cartoon RBC).
  ATP is exported basally, and hypoxia or RBC deformation increase ATP export. Pannexin
  1 (Px1) appears to be necessary for O2- and deformation-responsive export of ATP
  from the RBC. The exported ATP can act to limit the adhesivity of RBCs to endothelial
  cells, effect vasodilation, and may have anti-permeability () and other roles. In
  oxygenated RBCs, activity of the hexose monophosphate (HMP) pathway is favored because
  EMP enzymes are sequestered to AE1, freeing up shared substrate and generating NADPH
  that provides the reducing equivalents necessary to power antioxidant systems in
  the face of high O2 flux.
