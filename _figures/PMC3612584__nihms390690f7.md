caption: ODP induced by MD in cats and mice has little to no effect on eye-specific
  projections to the LGNd, but has dramatic effects on cortical function and structure.
  Diagrams in (A)–(C) depict changes occurring in visual centers in one hemisphere
  of the brain. Each circle represents a population of neurons. The color and intensity
  within each circle indicates the response level to the contralateral (red) or ipsilateral
  (green) eye with binocular responses shown as a mixture of red and green (yellow).
  Arrows represent information flow between centers of the visual pathway. The size
  of the arrowhead is proportional to the level of activity. The thickness of the
  arrow is proportional to the number of connections. Asterisks (*) indicate hypothesized
  changes that have not yet been experimentally measured.(A) In critical period cats,
  changes in cortical responses and connections occur faster in upper cortical layers
  than in cortical layer 4. Moreover, changes in deprived-eye responses and anatomy
  precede those of the nondeprived eye. Just 1 day of MD results in a reduction of
  deprived-eye responses and connections in upper cortical layers, but no change in
  layer 4. After 3 days of MD, deprived-eye responses are now reduced in layer 4 without
  accompanying structural changes. In addition, there is an increase in nondeprived-eye
  responses and connections in upper cortical layers, but not layer 4. MD for 6 days
  produces no further changes in upper cortical layers. However, in layer 4, deprived-eye
  connections are lost and now accompany the earlier reduction in deprived-eye responses.
  Additionally, nondeprived-eye responses in layer 4 get stronger, but without accompanying
  structural changes. Prolonged MD (3 weeks) results in further reduction of deprived-eye
  responses and connections in upper cortical layers. Nondeprived-eye responses are
  further increased in upper cortical layers and nondeprived-eye connections are increased
  in all cortical layers. Alternatively, reopening the deprived eye after brief MD
  for just 2 days restores responses to baseline levels in all cortical layers and
  restores connections in upper cortical layers, but is not sufficient to restore
  layer 4 connections.(B) In critical period mice, changes induced by MD occur slower
  than in critical period cats, but follow a similar progression. After 3 days of
  MD, deprived-eye responses and connections are reduced in upper cortical layers.
  In addition, deprived-eye responses are reduced in layer 4, although to a lesser
  extent and with little or no structural change. After 6 days of MD, there is an
  increase in nondeprived-eye responses and connections in upper cortical layers.
  Deprived-eye connections are also lost in layer 4 and now accompany the earlier
  reduction in deprived-eye responses. Non-deprived-eye responses in layer 4 also
  get stronger, but without accompanying structural changes. Prolonged MD (4 weeks),
  results in further reduction of deprived-eye responses and connections in upper
  cortical layers. Non-deprived-eye responses are further increased in upper cortical
  layers and connections are increased in all cortical layers. Alternatively, reopening
  the deprived eye after brief MD for just 2 days restores responses to baseline levels
  in all cortical layers and restores connections in upper cortical layers, but is
  not sufficient to restore layer 4 connections.(C) In adult mice, MD induces qualitatively
  and quantitatively different changes compared to critical period mice. After 3 days
  of MD, there are no changes in eye-specific responses or connections. After 7 days
  of MD, there is an increase in nondeprived-eye responses and connections in upper
  cortical layers. Nondeprived-eye responses also get stronger in layer 4, but without
  accompanying structural changes. There are no changes in deprived-eye responses
  or connections across all layers throughout this period of MD. After reopening the
  deprived eye, nondeprived-eye responses and connections are restored to baseline
  levels in all cortical layers.MD = monocular deprivation. BV = binocular vision.
