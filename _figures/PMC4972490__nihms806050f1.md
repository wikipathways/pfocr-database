caption: In response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or replication fork collapse
  (not shown), sensors (light blue) detect the damage, and signalling mediators recruit
  or activate effectors that repair the damage and activate cell cycle checkpoints.
  BRCA1-containing macro-complexes (dark blue) are crucial mediators of the DNA damage
  response. The BRCA1–abraxas–RAP80 complex associates with ubiquitylated histones
  near the sites of DNA damage; this is dependent on phosphorylation of histone H2AX
  (γH2AX), mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1) and RING finger protein
  8 (RNF8). The BRCA1–CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP) complex associates with the
  MRN complex (which is comprised of MRE11, RAD50 and Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein
  1 (NBS1)), which senses DSBs and is responsible for DSB resection. The BRCA1–partner
  and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2)–BRCA2 complex is important in mediating RAD51-dependent
  homologous recombination (HR). CHK2-dependent phosphorylation of S988 in BRCA1 appears
  to be required for the BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2 effector complex, which is important in
  RAD51-mediated HR. The BRCA1–BRCA1-interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1)–DNA
  topoisomerase 2-binding protein 1 (TOPBP1) complex is associated with DNA repair
  during replication and may help mediate ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)–CHK1
  signalling, but its precise function is unknown. DNA damage is also recognized by
  ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATR kinases, which phosphorylate BRCA1,
  BRCA1-associated proteins and p53 and mediate signalling to form macro-complexes
  and activate cell cycle checkpoints.
