caption: Modulation of the contact pathway [±CTI], TFWall, exogenous concentrations
  of rFVIIa, and collagen and its resultant effects on platelet deposition and fibrin
  formation. Results from perfusion of WB from Hemophilia A or B patients over TF/collagen
  indicate a crucial role of FIXa/FVIIIa in driving high FXa levels and subsequent
  thrombin production that produces fibrin under flow. Recombinant FVIIa localization
  to the platelet surface in combination with contact pathway engagement (FXIIa→FXIa)
  also drives FXa production, which then results in fibrin formation under flow. Thrombin
  feedback activation of platelets (not shown) would be expected to reinforce both
  platelet activation (and procoagulant activity) and platelet deposition to some
  extent through PAR1/4 signaling.
