caption: Schematic of the terminal steps of wax  biosynthesis in leek leaves leading
  to the production of  hentriacontan-16-one. The boxed components were found in the
  surface  wax. The brackets around hentriacontan-16-ol indicate that although it  is
  assumed to be the immediate precursor to hentriacontan-16-one, this  aspect of the
  pathway has not been characterized in leeks. The  synthesis of C26 to C32 fatty
  acids is evident from in vitro assays of  fatty acid elongases. The synthesis of
  the C32 aldehyde is deduced from  the presence of the C26 to C30 aldehydes and the
  C31 alkane. Similar  deductions were not made for hentriacontan-16-ol, since there
  is only  indirect evidence of secondary alcohol synthesis in leeks.
