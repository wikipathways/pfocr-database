caption: Definitive large scale network of DEGs, identification of hub genes and associated
  groups in PaeAG1 after treatment with ciprofloxacin. Network showing all 518 DEGs
  genes and their interactions (449 genes have at least one connection). Known interactions
  according to STRINGdb (database-based method) are shown as solid lines and data-driven
  interactions according to data-driven co-expression analysis as dashed lines. Enriched
  nodes associated to KEGG annotation are colored according to each pathway (more
  details in Table ). Phages genes, virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes
  are represented as triangles, arrowheads and rhomboids, respectively. Other genes
  are represented as ellipses.
