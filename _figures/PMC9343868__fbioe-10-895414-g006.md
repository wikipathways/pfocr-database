caption: Overview of various pathways involved in selective degradation of lignin
  into desired valuable products. (A) Key route to synthesize microbial lipids, with
  ergosterol as an example via TCA cycle. (B) Vannilin biosynthesis through lignin
  degradation to monomeric units. (C) Vannilin biosynthesis through degradation of
  ferulic acid. (D) Highlights of the multiple pathways in formation of polyhydroxyalkanoates
  where acetyl CoA acts as the main player. (E) Key reactions involved in cis-cis
  muconic acid formation. Where TCA, Tricarboxylic acid; β-KAP, β-ketoadipate pathway.
