caption: 'Obesity-linked metabolic pathways susceptible to diet induced epigenetic
  perturbation. Hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin neurons control homeostatic eating
  by expressing appetite-inhibitory proopiomelanocortin. Obesogenic diet causes repression
  of proopiomelanocortin, which increases food intake. This is partially offset by
  acute proopiomelanocortin neuron plasticity change via upregulating ST8SIA4 as a
  feedback-loop. Adipose tissue secretes leptin to signal (indicated by pointed arrow)
  excessive energy storage in hypothalamus by upregulating proopiomelanocortin expression.
  Obesogenic diet causes blunted leptin response in proopiomelanocortin neurons and
  repressed leptin transcription in adipocyte. Meanwhile compulsive eating is promoted
  through diet-induced dysregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter
  and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C in dopaminergic neurons in central reward
  circuitry, boosting desire for palatable food. Adipocyte differentiation as well
  as fat accumulation is perturbed by nutrition targeting CEBPA, PPARG and fatty acid
  synthase, causing excessive adiposity. Dietary components also influence energy
  expenditure, represented by regulating ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine-spermine
  N-acetyltransferase in fat and possibly liver through NNMT, which acts by inhibiting
  (indicated by flat-end arrow) the enrichment of H3K4 methylation at ornithine decarboxylase
  and spermidine-spermine N-acetyltransferase. WAT: white adipose tissue. Epigenetically
  regulated genes in each metabolic pathway are listed in bold and italics (POMC:
  proopiomelanocortin; ST8SIA4: ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase
  4; TH: tyrosine hydroxylase; SLC6A3: dopamine transporter solute carrier family
  6; CDKN1C: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C; CEBPA: CCAAT/enhancer binding protein
  (C/EBP) alpha; PPARG: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; LEP: leptin;
  FASN: fatty acid synthase; ODC: ornithine decarboxylase; SSAT: spermidine-spermine
  N-acetyltransferase). Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are depicted for each pathway
  and include DNA methylation, histone marks and epigenetic regulatory genes (NNMT:
  Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase. SETDB1: SET domain bifurcated 1; SETD8: SET domain
  containing protein 8; MECP2: methyl CpG binding protein 2; MBD2: methyl-CpG binding
  domain protein 2; DNMT1/3A: DNA methyltransferase 1/3A; KAT8: lysine acetyltransferase
