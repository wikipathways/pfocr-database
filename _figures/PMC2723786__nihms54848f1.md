caption: BCL6 is expressed when B-cells enter the germinal center reaction. BCL6 can
  directly repress ATR, CHEK1 (shown herein), TP53 and CDKN1A, all of which form part
  of a sequential pathway that senses, transduces and triggers checkpoints in response
  to DNA damage. Repression of these genes facilitates clonal expansion and survival
  of B-cells in spite of their undergoing mutagenesis as a consequence of class switch
  recombination and somatic hypermutation. B-cells in turn can overcome this effect
  through several pathways. Increasing levels of genotoxic stress can degrade BCL6
  through the actions of ATM, and CD40 signaling through NFkB can rapidly overcome
  BCL6 mediated transcriptional repression by disrupting its interaction with N-CoR
  corepressor, and can transcriptionally downregulate BCL6 through induction of the
  IRF4 transcription factor, which represses the BCL6 locus.
