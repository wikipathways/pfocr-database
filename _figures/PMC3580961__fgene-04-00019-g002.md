caption: Transcription at damaged DNA. (1) Prior to formation of the transcription
  initiation complex, XPF–ERCC1 and XPG cut the DNA proximal to the promoter to get
  ready for transcription initiation. TFIIH unwinds the DNA to open the promoter during
  initiation phase. (2) CSB is bound to and moves with RNAPII during elongation phase
  and can activate repair when the polymerase gets stalled at a lesion. (3) Depending
  on the type of damage, cells will undergo apoptosis upon stalling of RNAPII. Apoptosis
  can be induced in a p53-dependent or -independent manner and might lead to tissue
  degeneration and aging of the organism. (4) Opposing induction of cell death, CSB
  can induce repair of the lesion by TC-NER. Removal of RNAPII is a prerequisite for
  repair that is dependent on CSB and CSA. CSA is recruited by CSB. UVSSA as well
  as NEDD4/Rsp5 and Cul3 are important for polyubiquitylation of RNAPII via Cdc48/p97
  and for stabilization of CSB at the site of damage. RNAPII is degraded by the proteasome
  while CSB recruits the factors of the downstream NER pathway. (5) XPA validates
  the lesion and TFIIH unwinds the helix around the lesion. Replication protein A
  (RPA) coats the single-stranded DNA to prevent the strand from reacting with other
  factors or forming secondary structures. XPG is recruited 3’ of the damaged DNA
  and stabilizes the XPF–ERCC1 endonuclease complex 5’ of the lesion. A fragment of
  25–30 nucleotides length containing the lesion is cut and released. (6) Finally
  the gap is filled by DNA polymerase δ and ε, recruited by replication factor C (RFC)
  and proliferative cell nuclear antigen A (PCNA), and the nick is sealed by DNA ligase.
  (7) Re-initiation of transcription upon UV irradiation requires CSB.
