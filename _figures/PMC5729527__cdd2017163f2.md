caption: Scheme of reported cross-talk between core Hippo pathway components and wt
  (left) or mutant (right) p53. Both wt and mutp53 functionally interact with various
  components of the Hippo pathway (solid filled ovals) either directly or via additional
  factors (gray shaded ovals). Numbers above lines refer to publications describing
  the indicated regulatory vector
