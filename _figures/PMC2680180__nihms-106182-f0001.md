caption: In yeast, SIR2 has been implicated downstream of mitochondrial changes in
  response to calorie restriction (CR), whereas in mammals the SIR2 ortholog SIRT1
  has been implicated upstream of mitochondrial changes. In C. elegans, sirtuins have
  not been implicated in dietary restriction to date. The pathway in mice shows that
  the increase in mitochondrial number and activity may work via the mitochondrial
  sirtuins SIRT3, 4, and 5 or by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS). The drug
  Resveratrol and CR may increase SIRT1 activity, which is part of an autoregulatory
  feedback loop that includes the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).
