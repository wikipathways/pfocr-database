caption: 'A model of signaling pathways for LTM formation upon associative olfactory
  conditioning of honeybees. The model is proposed on the basis of the present findings
  in honeybees and documented findings in insects. It is based on the assumption that
  NO acts as a retrograde signal in the CS pathway. CS–US associative trials (CS–US
  coincidence detection is not shown) lead to an increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration
  ([Ca2+]i) via nicotinic acetylcholine (Ach) receptors (NAChRs) () and/or NMDA glutamate
  (Glu) receptors (NMDARs) () in NO-generating neurons (postsynaptic sites). The increased
  [Ca2+]i activates the NO synthase (NOS) via Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM), leading to NO
  generation. In NO-receptive neurons (presynaptic sites), soluble guanylyl cyclase
  (sGC) is stimulated by NO, thereby generating cGMP from GTP. The NO–cGMP signaling
  activates, in turn, PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase), which is involved in two
  different pathways: one, induced by a single CS–US pairing, in which cGMP directly
  activates PKA with a small amount of cAMP (), leading to transcription-independent
  e-LTM, and another, induced by multiple CS–US pairings, in which cyclic nucleotide-gated
  (CNG) channels, CaM, and adenylyl cyclase (AC) are involved, and which leads to
  transcription-dependent l-LTM. The latter requires CaMKII, which, together with
  PKA, probably activates CREB (cAMP responsive element binding protein). In the case
  of mushroom bodies, NO-receptive neurons would correspond to projection neuron afferents
  from the antennal lobes while NO-generating neurons would correspond to Kenyon cells
  constituting the mushroom bodies. VUMmx1 (ventral unpaired median neuron of the
  maxillary neuromere 1) is the neuron that mediates reinforcement (sucrose) signaling
  to olfactory neurons via octopamine (OA) release (). (CS) conditioned stimulus,
  (US) unconditioned stimulus, (Arg) arginine, (GTP) guanosine triphosphate, (cGMP)
  cyclic guanosine monophosphate, (ATP) adenosine triphosphate, (cAMP) cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate, (PLC) phospholipase C, (AmOA1) octopamine receptor of the honeybee,
  (OAR) octopamine receptor, (Gs) family of G proteins that stimulate AC, (Gq) family
  of G proteins that stimulate PLC, (R) ribosome.'
papertitle: Cyclic nucleotide–gated channels, calmodulin, adenylyl cyclase, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II are required for late, but not early, long-term memory formation
  in the honeybee.
