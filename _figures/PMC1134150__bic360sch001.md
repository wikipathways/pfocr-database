caption: 'Farnesol originates from three sources: (i) synthesis of FPP via the mevalonate
  pathway, followed by action by FPP phosphatase, (ii) degradation of prenylated proteins
  (although this has not been proved experimentally), or (iii) external sources, such
  as dietary or pharmaceutical. The broken arrow indicates the feedback role that
  farnesol has in controlling HMG-CoA reductase levels. Farnesol can be metabolized
  to farnesyl phosphate and then to FPP, to hydroxyfarnesol, farnesal or to the farnesyl
  glucuronide. F, farnesol; FP, farnesyl phosphate; P-450, unknown CYP; ADH, alcohol
  dehydrogenase.'
