caption: Schematic representation of the mitotic cell cycle in plants. At the G1 phase,
  D-type cyclins (CYCD) interact with the A-type CDK (CDKA), forming the CDKA/CYCD
  complex. The activity of CDKA/CYCD complex can be negatively regulated by KPR and
  SIM proteins. Once activation, this complex phosphorylates RBR to release the transcript
  factor E2Fa/b-DP. This E2Fa/b-DP complex binds to the E2F box and activate the transcription
  of S phase genes. At the G2 and M phase S, CYCA and CYCB are strongly expressed
  and their gene products assemble with CDKA and CDKB. The CYCD can also associate
  with CDKs. At the beginning of G2 phase, CDK activity are inhibited because of the
  phosphorylation of Y14 and T15 site by WEEI kinase. The CDC25-related kinase, which
  removes the inhibitory phosphate groups, still needs to be identified. Once the
  CDK/CYC complex are active, they phosphorylate MYB3R transcription factors and activate
  mitotic genes’ transcription. Mitotic exit requires anaphase-promoting complex (APC),
  which degrades cyclins through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
