caption: Summary of the Mtl (left) and Ara (right) catabolic pathways. The pathways
  were deduced from our proteomics data, while all the enzymes catalyzing these reactions
  were detected in our samples. The enzymes that appeared as differential between
  Mtl and Ara are indicated by their annotation in Rhizobase, with those in red belonging
  to the MtlDP and those in green to the AraDP. The enzyme indications underlined
  are present under only one culture condition. PP, pentose-phosphate pathway; CBB,
  Calvin–Benson–Bassham pathway; THF, tetrahydrofolate; TCA, tricarboxylic-acid cycle.
