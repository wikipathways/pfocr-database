caption: Schematic of how molecular context, lineage plasticity, and treatment-exerted
  selective pressure can lead to different outcomes, exhibiting exclusive molecular
  and cellular events for lung (blue) and prostate (yellow) tumors, and commonalities
  of these processes between both settings (green). In these tumors, a variety of
  molecular events can promote lineage plasticity, thus triggering intratumoral heterogeneity.
  A plasticity-permissive molecular environment, together with a selective pressure
  (i.e., treatment) may lead to intratumoral clones exhibiting an alternative histology
  to that initially diagnosed, which may become the predominant cell type in the progressed
  tumor. Colors in the circular figures (cells) represent different intratumoral subclones
  while shapes represent distinct histologies.
