caption: 'This figure shows the role of NETs in AS and its related mechanisms. Black
  upward arrow indicates the expression of this substance is upregulated; black arrow
  indicates the former promotes the upregulation of expression or cell behavior of
  the latter. The dark red arrow indicates the corresponding parts, which are the
  main components of NETs and promote the occurrence and development of AS. The diagram
  illustrates the role of each component of NETs in the development of atherosclerosis:
  (A). MPO can catalyse the formation of oxidised low-density lipoprotein, which promotes
  the transformation of macrophages into foam cells. It can also activate immune cells
  by forming MPO-DNA complexes, promote inflammatory responses, and promote the development
  of atherosclerosis. (B). NE promotes thrombosis by degrading TFPI, PKC and antithrombin.
  (C). mtDNA can directly activate the immune system, trigger inflammatory responses,
  and exacerbate AS by enhancing the inflammatory response and monocyte aggregation;
  (D). miRNAs can activate macrophages, upregulate TNF-α, and trigger the inflammatory
  response, and histone H4 has also been shown to upregulate the expression of some
  miRNAs, which in turn upregulates TF expression. It has been observed that miR-142-3p
  regulates macrophage function by downregulating PKCα, thereby affecting the production
  of inflammatory mediators. (E). Inflammasomes have been shown to promote the production
  of IL-1β by activating the CD36 receptor on the surface of macrophages, thereby
  causing an inflammatory response. Macrophages can activate Th17, resulting in increased
  IL-17 expression. (F). Histones H3/H4 bind to phospholipids on the surface of platelets,
  activating platelets and promoting thrombosis. In addition, they can also activate
  TLRs and trigger an inflammatory response. (G). Immune cell infiltration and platelet
  activation caused by atherosclerosis also promote the NETosis process. Abbreviations:
  AS (atherosclerosis), NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps), MPO (myeloperoxidase),
  NE (neutrophil elastase), PKC (protein kinase C), LDL (low-density lipoprotein),
  oxLDL (oxidised low-density lipoprotein), ROS (reactive oxygen species), PS (phosphatidylserine),
