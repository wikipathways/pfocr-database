caption: 'a BDNF-TrkB Signaling: Binding of BDNF to its TrkB receptor leads to autophosphorylation
  of tyrosine residues within the receptor. This creates docking sites for the adaptor
  protein Shc and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), activating second messengers that stimulate
  a downstream cascade, resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of CREB. CREB
  binds to the transcriptional machinery within the nucleus to control gene expression,
  leading to reduced KCC2 gene transcription in mature neurons. b WNK-SPAK/OSR1 Signaling:
  WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling regulates the activity of NKCC1 and KCC2 through phosphorylation.
  WNK phosphorylates and activates SPAK/OSR1. The activated WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling
  pathway phosphorylates NKCC1 at Thr203, Thr207, and Thr212 and KCC2 at Thr906 and
  Thr1007 residues, resulting in their activation and inhibition, respectively. WNK1
  collaborates with TGF-β and Smad2 in KCC2 expression and phosphorylation at Thr1007.
  c PKC and PP1 Regulation: PKC and PP1 have reciprocal roles in regulating KCC2 activity.
  PKC phosphorylates KCC2 at the Ser940 residue, stabilizing it at the neuronal cell
  surface membrane. Conversely, PP1, which is activated by high NMDA receptor activity,
  stimulates the internalization of KCC2, consequently reducing neuronal KCC2 activity.
