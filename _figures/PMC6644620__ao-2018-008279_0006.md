caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of nuciferine and N-nornuciferine. Target genes
  and products examined in this study are highlighted in red. (A) Possible biosynthetic
  pathway of BIAs in lotus mapped with various related enzymes and reported BIA structures
  found in lotus. (B) Possible pathway to nuciferine and N-nornuciferine synthesis
  in lotus drawn following relative gene expression patterns from the mechanical wounding
  experiment where CYP80G2 showed the first response to wounding, followed by CNMT
  and 6OM.
