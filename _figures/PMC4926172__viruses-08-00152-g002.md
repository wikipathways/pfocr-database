caption: Downstream targets of mTORC1. Amino acid availability is transduced to mTORC1
  directly by the small GTPase heterodimers RagA/RagC and RagB/RagD, a process that,
  together with the Ragulator complex, occurs at the lysosome surface. Human cytomegalovirus
  (HCMV) redistributes mTORC1 to a perinuclear localization in a dynein-dependent
  but Rag GTPase-independent mechanism. Andes virus (ANDV) modulates mTOR signaling
  at lysosomes and necessitates Rheb, RagA/B and LAMTOR1. The mTORC1 substrate, 4EBP1,
  is a negative regulator of mRNA translation initiation that binds to eIF4E to inhibit
  the formation of the eIF4F complex, which is made up of eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4G.
  Phosphorylated 4EBP1 disassociates from eIF4E and frees it up to bind eIF4G, eIF3
  and eIF4A to initiate cap-dependent translation. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) increases
  the binding affinity of eIF4E to capped mRNA by increasing its phosphorylation.
  Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) causes CDK1-induced hyperphosphorylation of 4EBP1
  to promote cap-dependent protein synthesis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) interferes at
  multiple points in the pathway including activation of mTOR, enhanced eIF4F complex
  loading on mRNA and upregulation of internal ribosome entry site translation by
  associating with eIF4E and the 40S ribosome. Vaccinia virus (VACV) and Herpes simplex
  virus type 1 (HSV-1) are known to induce the degradation of 4EBP1 and affect the
  eIF4F complex. Solid lines indicate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Dashed
  lines indicate clearly identified and wavy dashed lines represent ill-defined points
  at which viruses subvert the pathway.
