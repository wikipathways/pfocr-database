caption: A Simplified Model for the Interaction between / Signaling and Nitrate Reallocation
  to Mediate Plant Adaptation to the Environment.Stresses such as cadmium or salt
  induce the production of  and , which further activates the  and  signaling pathways,
  respectively. EIN3/EIL1 acts to converge signals transduced by  and  cascades, and
  further transduces the signal down to ERFs, which induce NRT1.8 expression by binding
  to its promoter, or EIN3/EIL1 decodes signals via the  pathway by binding to the
  promoter of NRT1.5 and suppresses its expression. The  pathway also participates
  in the downregulation of NRT1.5 via COI1. The coordinated upregulation of NRT1.8
  and downregulation of NRT1.5 fine-tunes nitrate reallocation to roots, which modulates
  the balance between stress tolerance and plant growth. Blue lines display the route
  for signals going through the  signaling pathway, while red lines indicate those
  through the  signaling pathway. Dashed lines indicate steps not shown or possible
  unidentified components. Gray dotted lines and question marks indicate alternative
  pathways/components that contribute, but to a much lesser extent, in the regulation
  of NRT1.5 and NRT1.8.
