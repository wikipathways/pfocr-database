caption: The pathway of protein glycation and AGE formation. Endogenous glycating
  agents include glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, ribose, and reactive triose
  intermediates of energy metabolism, glyoxal and MGO. The formation of AGEs occurs
  spontaneously by non-enzymatic reactions in a process designated by Maillard reaction.
  The early stage of this reaction usually occurs rapidly (hours to days), while the
  advanced stage of AGE formation is thought to take weeks to months to occur.
