caption: The Mia40 population in the IMS. Mia40 in the IMS functions as an import
  receptor, a chaperone and as the key oxidoreductase that introduces disulfide bonds
  to the incoming precursors. In this process, the electrons from the precursor flow
  to Mia40 then to Erv1 and finally to Cytochrome C. This pathway engages Mia40-redox
  active population. It has been suggested that a part of the total Mia40 population
  binds iron/sulfur clusters in a dimer form (Fe/S-bound population). This Mia40 population
  is considered redox inactive and its function is yet unknown.
