caption: Complement C5a-mediated immunometabolism. Intrarenal activation of complement
  C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) leads to a change in genes associated with cellular metabolism
  such as glycolysis, FAO, and TCA cycle (circled in red). These changes lead to changes
  in mitochondrial metabolism and mitochondrial lipid composition such as cardiolipin
  remodeling. Changes to cardiolipin composition of the mitochondrial membrane can
  lead to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thus activating the inflammatory
  response via IL-1β and IL-18. In addition, activation of C5aR1 on Tregs inhibits
  its anti-inflammatory function and lowers FoxP3 expression. On the other hand, activation
  of C5aR1 on macrophages may induce its polarization to the inflammatory M1 form,
  inducing inflammation. Both these exacerbate inflammatory responses in the kidney,
  leading to renal inflammation and fibrosis. FAO, fatty acid β-oxidation; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; Tregs, regulatory T cells. Color images are available online.
