caption: Schematic illustration of cathepsin B‐responsive biodegradable theranostic
  nanomedicine derived from branched pHPMA. a) Chemical structure of branched pHPMA‐PTX‐Gd
  conjugates. b) BP‐PTX‐Gd NPs formed through self‐assembly of the conjugate with
  hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. c) MR imaging in vivo of the delivery process
  of BP‐PTX‐Gd NPs to tumor sites via the EPR effect. d) BP‐PTX‐Gd NPs uptake and
  intracellular trafficking through lysosomal endocytosis pathways, and intracellular
  biodegradation in the overexpressed cathepsin B microenvironment and controlled
  drug release. Then, the released PTX inhibited cell mitosis by stabilizing microtubules
  and activated the corresponding apoptotic pathway to induce apoptosis.
