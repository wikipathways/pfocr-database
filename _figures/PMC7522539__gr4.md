caption: Mood stabilizers and mt protein or pathway targets, as well as the schematic
  of precision psychiatry medicine. (A) Physical connectivity of NPD-linked mt proteins
  that are targets of the mood stabilizers. (B) Enriched (see  for Benjamini-Hochberg
  FDR adjusted p-value) mt pathways targeted alone or shared by the mood stabilizers.
  (C) NPD-associated mt proteins targeted by one or more mood stabilizing medications
  (panel i) are highlighted (panel ii-iv) with their interacting partners as sub-networks.
  (D) Precision psychiatry model is shown by integrating various data features, which
  is fed into AI (or machine learning) algorithms to stratify and identify best therapeutic
  treatment for each subject through patient matching to evaluate treatment response
  and disease prognosis (see main text).
