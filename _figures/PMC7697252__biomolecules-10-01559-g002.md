caption: Modes of mitochondria-associated ubiquitination and degradation. The mitoCPR
  pathway entails that stress-induced impaired mitochondrial protein import leads
  to localization of a protein Cis1 at the TOM complex through its interaction with
  TOM70. Cis1 further recruits the AAA ATPase Msp1 at the TOM complex which extracts
  the ubiquitinated protein and subject it to the proteasome. The “MitoTAD” pathway
  constitutively performs surveillance of the import channel, clearing any blockade
  through association of a protein Ubx2 with TOM. The retrotranslocation pathway involves
  export of unfolded intramitochondrial proteins to the cytosol for their ubiquitin-dependent
  proteasomal degradation. The OMM resident E3 ligase MARCH5 constitutively ubiquitinates
  the incoming precursor proteins whereas the deubiquitinase USP30 removes the ubiquitin,
  thereby facilitating the mitochondrial protein import.
