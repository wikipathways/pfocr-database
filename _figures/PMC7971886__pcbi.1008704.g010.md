caption: The reactions depicted by the blue, orange, green and yellow arrows represent,
  respectively, the glycolysis, pentose-phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle
  and the glyoxylate shunt, which are all present in the original model. The black
  arrows represent the nine reactions that were added to the model. Finally, red arrows
  depict the Synth reactions added to account for the presence of the newly added
  metabolites in other pathways.
