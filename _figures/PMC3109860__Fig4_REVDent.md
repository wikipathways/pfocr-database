caption: Multiple CHK1 inhibitors promote compensatory activation of the RAS-SRC /
  MEK1/2 / ERK1/2 pathway. The survival pathway can be inhibited at various points
  along its course that reveals the true toxicity of CHK1 inhibitor exposure. Killing
  is mediated via the intrinsic / mitochondrial cell death pathway.
