caption: Phylogenetic relationships and gene clustering of JA-responsive ERF (A) and
  bHLH (B) transcription factors of clade II, subgroup IXa and IVa, respectively.
  Full-length amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW (Thompson et al., ),
  and the trees were generated with the neighbor-joining algorithm using MEGA-X (Kumar
  et al., ). The Arabidopsis genes are included in the trees as an outgroup. The scale
  bars indicate the number of amino acid substitutions per residue. For isoprenoid-derived
  metabolites, the contribution of the mevalonate (MVA) or methylerythritol phosphate
  (MEP) pathway to their production is indicated on the right. Apparent orthologs
  from Solanaceae plants are connected by dotted lines. Gene clusters are depicted
  schematically. The region deleted in a low-nicotine tobacco cultivar (Kajikawa et
  al., ) is highlighted in light green.
