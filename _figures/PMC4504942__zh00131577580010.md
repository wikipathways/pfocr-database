caption: Proposed novel signaling pathway by which H2S induces DSM phasic contractions.
  H2S promotes neuronal ACh release from bladder nerve endings, in a Ca2+-dependent
  manner. In parallel, H2S inhibits BK channels directly, and thus depolarizes the
  DSM cell membrane potential causing an increase in the basal Ca2+ levels and the
  amplitude of the Ca2+ transients. Collectively, this leads to an increase in DSM
  phasic contractions.
