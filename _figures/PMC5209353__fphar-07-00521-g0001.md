caption: 'Gluconeogenesis is a multistep metabolic process that generates glucose
  from pyruvate or a related three-carbon compound (lactate) and glutamine. Several
  reversible steps in gluconeogenesis are catalyzed by the same enzymes used in glycolysis.
  There are three irreversible steps in the gluconeogenic pathway: (1) conversion
  of pyruvate to PEP via oxaloacetate, catalyzed by PC and PCK; (2) dephosphorylation
  of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by FBP; and (3) dephosphorylation of glucose 6-phosphate
  by G6PC.'
