caption: The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and its possible inhibitors. SARS-CoV-2 enters
  the target cells via an endosomal pathway. The S protein binds with the angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the cell primed by serine protease TMPRSS2. Viral RNA is unveiled
  in the cytoplasm to produce PP1a and PP1ab polyproteins, which are cleaved to form
  non-structural proteins. These non-structural proteins facilitate the formation
  of negative RNA by the process of replication and transcription. This, in turn,
  translates to N protein, another set of translation takes in the endoplasmic reticulum-ERGIC-Golgi
  to produce structural proteins (S, M, and E). Finally, the packing of viral RNA
  with N proteins and further assembly of S, M, and E proteins take place to form
  SARS-CoV-2 buds, which are released from the infected cell by exocytosis. Various
  drugs that are shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 at various stages are CQ/HCQ, Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine;
  L, Lopinavir; R1, Ritonavir; I, Ivermectin; R, Remdesivir, R2, Resveratrol; D, Darunavir;
  C, Camostat.
