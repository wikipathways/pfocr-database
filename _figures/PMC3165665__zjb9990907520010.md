caption: Model for the coordination of septal PG assembly and hydrolysis. Shown is
  a model for the coordination of septal PG synthesis and hydrolysis based on the
  self-enhancing FtsN recruitment model proposed previously (). When FtsN begins to
  recruit to the septum, it is thought to stimulate PG synthesis by the PBPs and may
  also activate (directly or indirectly) the activity of the LytM factors, which in
  turn activate the amidases. Septal PG serves as a localization signal for amidase
  (AmiB and AmiC) recruitment to midcell. It is also hydrolyzed by the amidases to
  form the cell poles and generate denuded glycan strands that serve as recruitment
  signals for the PG-binding SPOR domain of FtsN. With each progression of the cycle,
  more FtsN is recruited to further enhance the process of septal synthesis and splitting
  (cell constriction). See text for details.
