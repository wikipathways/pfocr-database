caption: An overview of the neddylation and deneddylation pathway. NEDD8 is processed
  into its matured form through both ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase isozyme (UCH)
  and Sentrin-specific protease 8 (SENP8) proteolytic cleavage. NEDD8 is passed through
  a “baton” mechanism, where NEDD8 is adenylated and activated in an adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP)-dependent mechanism by E1, which is a heterodimer of NEDD8-activating enzyme
  E1 regulatory subunit (NAE1) and ubiquitin-activating enzyme 3 (UBA3). NEDD8 binds
  specifically to UBA3 within E1. UBA3 binds both ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBE)
  2F (UBE2F) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2M (UBE2M) in E2 and transfers NEDD8
  to both proteins. NEDD8 is finally attached to a substrate (i.e., cullins and non-neddylated
  proteins) by E3, which includes ring box 1 (RBX1), ring box 2 (RBX2), and other
  potential E3 ligases. In E3, NEDD8 loaded into UBE2M associates with RBX1 and defective
  in cullin neddylation 1 (DCUN1D1). NEDD8 loaded into UBE2F associates with RBX2,
  but the involvement of DCUN1D1 is unknown. Substrate neddylation displaces cullin-associated
  NEDD8-dissociated protein 1 (CAND1), which serves to regulate cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin
  ligases (CRL) assembly. NEDD8 is removed from the substrate via deneddylation, which
  involves the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex and SENP8/DEN1. The Dictyostelium discoideum
  orthologs are displayed as red text beside the respective human protein. AMP, adenosine
