caption: Structure and function of PvHPPK–DHPS. A, the domain architecture of Pv and
  Pf HPPK–DHPSs (717 and 706 residues, respectively) with marked domain boundaries
  of HPPK and DHPS in orange and blue, respectively. The red lines are regions that
  fall outside annotated domain boundaries. B, HPPK domain catalyzes the transfer
  of pyrophosphate from ATP to DHP, resulting in the product DHPPP. DHPPP is then
  converted to 7,8-dihydropteroate by DHPS using pABA and DHPPP. SDX inhibits DHPS
  via mimicry of pABA where it results in formation of an adduct that is deleterious
  to the downstream folate synthesis pathway. The dotted red line indicates termination
  of the pathway.
