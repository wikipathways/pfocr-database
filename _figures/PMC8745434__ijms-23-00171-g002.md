caption: Model of uncontrolled reactivation of Hh signaling in the pathogenesis of
  IPF. Microenvironment factors provoke repetitive epithelial injury followed by secretion
  of the Hh signaling pathway-regulated various products, such as TGF-β, SDF-1, Snail
  1/2, OPN, ZEB-1, and NF-κβ. Epithelial cell Hh also warns neighboring cells via
  paracrine signals, induces apoptosis, and initiates crosstalk with immune and mesenchymal
  cells. Growth factor and microenvironment-induced epithelial and mesenchymal crosstalk
  promote the formation of EMT characterized by increased N-cadherin, mesenchymal
  markers, FSP1, and type I collagen. Hh signaling as one of activating transcriptional
  factors AECIIs regulates the immune response to ameliorate lung injury by undergoing
  EMT mechanism, promoting macrophage M2-associated inflammatory components, and fibroblasts
  recruitment to the injured site. Furthermore, Hh signaling pathway regulates myofibroblast
  differentiation and ECM production in parallel with other pro-fibrogenic proteins
  and cytokines, including CTGF, TGF-β, α-SMA, ET-1, OPN, and WISP-1. In conjunction
  with other pro-fibrogenic factors and cytokines, the Hh pathway regulates the accumulation
  of ECM-associated myofibroblast, collagen synthesis, and lung architecture is replaced
  with scar tissue fibrosis.
