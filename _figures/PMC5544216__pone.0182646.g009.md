caption: GM-CSF has a role as a differentiation factor in DC development; GM-CSF inhibits
  FLT3L-driven pDC production from lineage-negative DC precursor subsets, while promoting
  conventional DC growth via modulation of a complex network of transcriptional factors.
  Thus, the upregulation of the transcription factor E2-2, which is induced by FLT3L,
  is essential for the development and maintenance of a mature pDC phenotype. However,
  the E2-2-dependent pDC promoting-transcriptional program can be antagonized by GM-CSF
  via upregulation of the transcription factor ID2 that directs conventional DC development.
