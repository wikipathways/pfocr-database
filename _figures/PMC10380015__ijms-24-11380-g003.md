  is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to IL-4Rα receptor. AK120 is an antibody
  against IL4Rα receptor. Tralokinumab and cendakimab, a fully humanized IgG4λ, bind

  subunit and IL13Rα2 subunit. Tezepelumab is an anti-TSLP antibody. Lebrikizumab,

  inhibiting the signals by IL4 and IL-13. Mepolizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin
