caption: Mechanism of m6A regulation of intestinal mucosal immunity. The folic acid
  produced by intestinal symbiotic flora such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium,
  as well as vitamin B2 and B6 in the intestinal tract, participate in SAM synthesis,
  which are the main raw materials for m6A modification. As an important part of the
  intestinal mucosal barrier, m6A modification of intracellular XPO1 in IECs further
  activates the NF-κB pathway and releases inflammatory factors such as IL-8. As an
  important component of the immune response, the intracellular SOCS m6A modification
  promotes the activation of the TCR and STAT5 pathway and promotes the proliferation
  and differentiation of intestinal T cells and the secretion of cytokines such as
  IL 2/7.
