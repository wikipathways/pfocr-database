caption: Schematic representation of the molecular interplay between S1T-dependent
  ER Ca2+ leak, ER stress, βAPP processing, and neuroinflammation likely contributing
  to AD setting and/or progression. (A) The human truncated isoform of the sarco-endoplasmic
  reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 1 (S1T) expression is induced under ER stress conditions through
  the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP pathway, and triggers and amplifies ER stress response
  through the control of Ca2+ mobilization from ER. (B) S1T is upregulated in sporadic
  AD brains and in cellular models overproducing βAPP fragments (SH-SY5Y APPswe).
  S1T expression is also induced by exogenous oligomeric Aβ and enhances in turn βAPP
  processing through enhanced BACE1 expression and activity and triggers microglia
  recruitment and activation in vitro and in vivo.
