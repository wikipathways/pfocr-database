caption: Graphic summary. On the one hand, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure
  could enhance myostatin (Mstn) production through the Erk1/2 pathway, which further
  activated the Smad3/PGC-1α pathway, and negatively regulated Fndc5 production. On
  the other hand, CSE exposure might partially and directly decrease the expression
  of Fndc5. TEW-7197, a selective TGF-β receptor ALK4/ALK5 inhibitor that can stop
  Mstn binding to its receptor. SIS3, a specific Smad3 inhibitor by inhibiting Smad3
  phosphorylation to suppress Smad3 signaling pathway. U0126, a specific inhibitor
  of Erk1/2.
