caption: NEK1 and NEK2 play key roles in the DDR pathway. NEK1 is required for replication
  fork stability by phosphorylating Rad54 at S572. Moreover, the TLK1 > NEK1 > ATR
  > CHK1 axis plays a major role in DDR, involving cell cycle arrest through CDC25A
  phosphorylation and CDK1 inhibition. TLK1 phosphorylates NEK1 at T141 and NEK1 interacts
  with ATR, promoting the stabilization of ATR-ATRIP complex and autophosphorylation
  of ATR at T1989. NEK2 regulates centrosome disjunction since ATM activates the PP1
  phosphatase, which in turn dephosphorylates NEK2, leading to the inhibition of centrosome
  splitting. The PP1a phosphatase activation also counteracts the NEK2-dependent phosphorylation
  of NPM/B23, which stabilizes the ARF pathway. NEK2 also upregulates the Wnt1/β-catenin
  pathway.
