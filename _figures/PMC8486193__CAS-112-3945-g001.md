caption: Schematic representation of STEAP1‐NRF2 pathway. Under nonoxidative conditions,
  nuclear erythroid 2‐related factor (NRF2) is located in the cytoplasm, adjacent
  to kelch‐like ECH‐associated protein 1 (KEAP1). Oxidative stress causes the dissociation
  of NRF2 from KEAP1. NRF2 enters the nucleus and activates several cytoprotective
  genes for protection against oxidative stress. Our previous report suggested that
  six‐transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) plays an important
  role in upregulating this pathway. ARE, antioxidant response element
