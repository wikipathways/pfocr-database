caption: Schematic representation of HR in DDR. A DSB is induced on the DNA strand.
  The MRN complex (MRE11–RAD50–NBS1) recognizes and binds to the area of DNA damage.
  This leads to the recruitment and activation of the serine/threonine protein kinase
  ATM (which phosphorylates several key proteins in the HR-DDR pathway such as CHEK2,
  BRCA1, NBS1, and p53). ATM phosphorylates the histone variant γH2AX on Ser139, which
  subsequently leads to signal transduction. This leads to BRCA1 and BARD1 recruitment
  to the site of DNA damage. C-terminal interacting protein (CtIP) is recruited to
  the 5′ DNA end and begins resecting, whereas replication protein A (RPA) caps the
  exposed ssDNA. ATR and PALB2 are activated. BRCA1 recruits PALB2, FANCD2, BRCA2,
  and RAD51. RPA is exchanged for RAD51, which promotes nucleofilament formation and
  strand invasion to form the D-loop. DNA repair is mediated via the Holliday junction
  (red and black arrows represent crossover).
