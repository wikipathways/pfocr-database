caption: (A) Established pathway for the conversion of 11 to 12 in the lincomycin
  biosynthesis. Reactions catalyzed by LmbM, CcbZ, and LmbL for the conversion of
  24a to 20 are highlighted. The labeled carbons (C6, C7, and C8) in 35 to 39 are
  coplanar with C7 which has a sp2 configuration. The NAD+ coenzyme in the active
  site of CcbZ is likely located at the si face of the above plane (see 35, 39). (B)
  Reaction catalyzed by CDP-α-ᴅ-glucose 4,6-dehydratase. The labeled carbons (C4,
  C5, and C6) in 43 and 44 are also expected to be coplanar.
