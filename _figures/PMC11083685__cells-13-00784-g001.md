caption: 'The metabolic pathway of ketone body production during states of reduced
  insulin release. A decrease in insulin triggers the release of fatty acids in the
  form of free fatty acids (FFAs). These FFAs are then converted into Acetyl-CoA through
  oxidation. When the capacity of mitochondria to utilise Acetyl-CoA in the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle is exceeded, a different metabolic route is engaged, leading to
  the creation of ketone bodies. Once formed, these ketone bodies are dispersed into
  the bloodstream and delivered to various organs, including the brain and heart,
  for energy use. FFAs: free fatty acids; BHB: D/L-ß-hydroxybutyric acid; AcAc: acetoacetic
  acid; TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle'
