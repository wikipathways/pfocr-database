caption: 'Schematic overview of the metabolic connection of the Weimberg pathway to
  the central carbon metabolism of C. glutamicum. Endogenous enzymes of C. glutamicum
  catalyzing reactions of the Weimberg pathway or spontaneous chemical reactions are
  highlighted in green, whereas the respective heterologous enzymes originating from
  C. crescentus are highlighted in red. Abbreviations: XylB, xylose dehydrogenase;
  XylC, d-1,4-xylono lactonase; XylD, d-xylonate dehydratase; XylX, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-xylonate
  dehydratase; XylA, α-ketoglutarate semi aldehyde dehydrogenase; IolG, myo-inositol-2-dehydrogenase;
  KsaD, α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase; ODHC, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
  complex. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
