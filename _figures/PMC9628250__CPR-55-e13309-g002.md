caption: Typical energy metabolism pathways in mammalian cells. Glucose is used not
  only for energy production but also for intermediate metabolites in biosynthesis.
  Glutamine can serve as a major energy source through oxidative phosphorylation in
  mitochondria. This process requires the conversion of glutamine to a‐ketoglutarate.
  Lipid metabolism begins with the entry of fatty acids into cells. Depending on the
  cellular energy status, fatty acids taken up through the plasma membrane are converted
  into fatty acyl‐CoAs and either directly into mitochondria for β‐oxidation or stored
  as lipids in lipogenic tissues such as adipose tissue and liver. Major biochemical
  pathways are shown in blue, with the main product of each pathway denoted in orange.
  Several key enzymes are highlighted in green. α‐KG, a‐ketoglutarate; ACC, acetyl‐CoA
  carboxylase; ACS, acyl‐CoA synthetase; CAT, carnitine acyl transferase; CPT1, carnitine
  palmitoyl‐CoA transferase 1; FABPpm, plasma membrane‐associated fatty‐acid binding
  protein; FATP, fatty acid transport proteins; Fructose‐6‐P, fructose‐6‐phosphate;
  G‐6‐P, glucose‐6‐phosphate; Gls, glutaminase; OAA, oxaloacetate; OXPHOS, oxidative
  phosphorylation
