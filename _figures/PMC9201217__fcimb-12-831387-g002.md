caption: TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9 participate in the occurrence and development
  of RIOM/CIOM through different mechanisms. Activated TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 induce
  the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF-α) to participate
  in the development of RIOM/CIOM through the MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. TLR2
  can be activated by forming a functional complex with other TLRs, and TLR2 can also
  activate ABCB1/MDR1 P-gp to prevent harmful substances from accumulating in cells.
  Due to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TLR4 could not only bind to HMGB1 and myeloid
  differentiation protein 2 (MD-2), and be activated through interactions with LPS,
  but could also interact with antigen-presenting cells, accompanied by the upregulation
  of costimulatory molecules, such as CD40, CD80, and CD86. When activated by CBLB502,
  TLR5 induces protective cytokines (G-CSF) and antioxidants (SOD2), contributing
  to rebuilding the epithelium. As for TLR9, it can be activated after recognizing
  CpG DNA from bacteria.
