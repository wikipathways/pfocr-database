caption: Hh in tracheal cell migration. Schematic representation of one tracheal placode
  at stage 13; (B) detail of (A), showing the tip cells of each branch and how Bnl
  is expressed in the surrounding tissues in order to provide a chemoattractive signal;
  and (C) how canonical Hh signaling induces the expression of Bnl in the cells surrounding
  the tracheal tip cells (adapted from []).
