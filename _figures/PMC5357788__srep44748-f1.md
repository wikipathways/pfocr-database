caption: (a) Concept for the biocontainment strategy using engineered dependency on
  Pt/HPt. Under laboratory conditions, microbial growth is maintained by using any
  P source, including Pt and HPt. Common microbial strains are able to grow both inside
  and outside of laboratory facilities by using Pi or organic Pi compounds as P sources.
  A Pt/HPt-dependent strain, which can utilize Pt or HPt but not Pi, is not able to
  grow unless Pt/HPt is provided as a P source under laboratory conditions. This Pt/HPt-dependent
  strain is not able to grow in the environment because Pt and HPt are ecologically
  rare and not available in amounts sufficient to support bacterial growth. (b) Schematic
  of the engineered P metabolic pathway for biocontainment. Dependency on Pt or HPt
  is created by disruption of endogenous Pi and organic Pi transporters and exogenous
  expression of HtxBCDE and PtxD. HtxBCDE takes up Pt/HPt but not Pi or organic Pi
  compounds. PtxD and HtxA expression confer Pt- and HPt-oxidation activities, respectively.
