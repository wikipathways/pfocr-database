caption: The TGF-β signaling pathway offers many different avenues for therapeutic
  intervention, each of which offers advantages and drawbacks. Current therapeutic
  approaches for modulating TGF-β signaling involve antagonism of TGF-β ligand binding
  to the heteromeric receptor complex with isoform-selective antibodies as large molecule
  inhibitors, such as metelimumab (for TGF-β2) and lerdelimumab (for TGF-β2/3) from
  Genzyme, and pan-TGF-β antibodies such as GC-1008 (Genzyme), ID-11 (Genzyme), SR-2F
  (NCI/NIH) and 2G7 (Genentech) antibodies, or soluble TGFβRII receptor fusion proteins
  (Biogen). Alternatively, the intracellular inhibition of the TGFβRI kinase can be
  achieved with small molecule inhibitors, such as SB431542 and SB505124 from GlaxoSmithKline;
  LY580276, LY550410, LY364947, LY573636 and LY2157299 from Eli Lilly; SD093 and SD208
  from Scios. Other inhibitors for TGF-β receptor kinase are NPC30345 (Scios), Ki-26894
  (Kirin brewery), SM16, A-83-01 (Kyoto Pharma), SX-007 (Scios) and IN-1130 (In2Gen),
  and dual inhibitors of both the TGFβRI and TGFβRII kinases, such as LY2109761 (Eli
  Lilly). Alternatively, expression of TGF-β isoforms can be affected by antisense
  technology targeting mRNA sequence-specific degradation, such as AP-12009 and AP-11014
  which were developed by Antisense Pharma and targeted to TGFβII and TGFβI, respectively.
  SIS3 is a selective chemical inhibitor of Smad3 activation and Smad3-mediated DNA
  binding and gene expression.
