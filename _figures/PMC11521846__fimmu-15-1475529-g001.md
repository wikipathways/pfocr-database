caption: Metabolic pathway of butyrate. Butyrate can be obtained in small exogenous
  quantities from certain foods. However, the majority of butyrate in the human body
  is produced through the glycolysis of undigested host carbohydrates by the gut microbiota.
  Most of the butyrate produced is absorbed and utilized by the colonic epithelium,
  which serves as the main energy source for the intestinal epithelium. A small proportion
  is absorbed by the liver, and the remaining extremely low concentration of butyrate
  enters the circulation for metabolism
