caption: (A) AMPK in cancer. Upon cellular stress, the activation of AMPK results
  in the phosphorylation of both p53 and TSC2. p53 activation results in activation
  of p21 which then results in inhibition of CDK leading to cell cycle arrest. Additionally,
  p53 activation also results in activation of PTEN which functions as an antagonist
  of the PI3K pathway, leading to mTOR activation, resulting in the inhibition of
  protein synthesis and cellular growth. TSC2 activation by AMPK results in GAP activation
  leading to the inactivation of RHEB. RHEB inactivation leads to the inhibition of
  the mTOR pathway resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis and cellular growth
  as well. (B) AMPK in type 2 diabetes. High glucose levels result in the inhibition
  of AMPK activation leading to the development of type 2 diabetes. The anti-hyperglycemic
  agent metformin leads to AMPK activation resulting in inhibition of ACC leading
  to either activation of fatty acid oxidation or inhibition of lipogenic enzymes.
  (C) AMPK in cardiovascular disease. Cardiac hypertrophy, LKB1 and CAMKK lead to
  AMPK activation resulting in the activation of critical pathways involved in cardiovascular
  disease. AICAR activates AMPK resulting in GLUT4 translocation and results in an
  increase in glucose uptake and glycolysis which is cardioprotective.
