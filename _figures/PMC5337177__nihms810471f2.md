caption: 'Mechanisms by which mild mitochondrial uncoupling protects neurons against
  oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and the accumulation of disease-related self-aggregating
  proteins such as amyloid β-peptide, Tau and α-synuclein. Mild uncoupling resulting
  from activation of endogenous uncoupling proteins (UCP) or pharmacological agents
  such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) triggers an adaptive bioenergetic stress response
  (ABSR) involving multiple signaling pathways and organelles. The ABSR involves activation
  of kinases, and transcription factors such as CREB, PGC-1α and NF-kB which, in turn,
  induce the expression of genes encoding proteins that enhance stress resistance
  and neuroplasticity including: the immediate early gene products Fos and Arc; the
  neurotrophic factor BDNF; the antioxidant enzyme SOD2; the regulator of mitochondrial
  biogenesis TFAM; an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway (TSC2). CamK, calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  kinase; ClC7, chloride channel 7; GLUT3, glucose transporter 3; MCLN, mucolipin;
  TPC2, two pore channel 2; MCT2, monocarboxylic acid transporter 2; vATPase, vesicular
  ATPase.'
