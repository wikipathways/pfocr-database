caption: Cellular proliferation, survival and EMT are controlled by the activation
  of ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. LA prevents the phosphorylation of ERK, in particular
  by blocking the activation of c-Myc, which is a centrepiece of the several processes
  implicated in cancer development. Moreover, LA inhibits the activation of Akt, leading
  to the inhibition of mTOR effectors S6K1 and S6, which induce the translational
  process; thus, LA reduces cellular proliferation and growth processes. On the other
  hand, LA activates the AMPK protein that negatively regulates the Akt pathway, thereby
  reducing the translation of several proteins involved in the tumorigenesis process.
  Moreover, LA impedes the activation of ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways by the inhibition
  of some TKR expression, such as IGF-1R, which is an upstream activator of these
  pathways, reinforcing its inhibition. IGF-1R maturation is inhibited by LA by downregulating
  the furin expression, leading to a decrease of mature IGF-1R at the membrane level.
