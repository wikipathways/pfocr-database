caption: Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), a stress and nutrient-responsive
  gene, protects against genotoxic cell death via SIRT3 upregulation. Gene knockout
  (KO) of Ang II promotes longevity in mice either directly or indirectly through
  Nampt or SIRT3 upregulation. SIRT3 deacetylates Ku70, augmenting Ku70-Bax interaction,
  thus attenuating apoptosis and promoting cell survival in cardiomyocytes. In the
  heart, SIRT3 also prevents cardiac hypertrophy by attenuating reactive oxygen species
  (ROS), deacetylating cyclophilin-D, and activating the anti-hypertrophic LKB1-AMP
  kinase signaling pathway. Calorie restriction (CR) prevents aging and age-related
  diseases by augmenting SIRT3 levels and functions in the cell, at least in part,
  by deacetylating and activating superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), thus protecting the
  cell from ROS-induced cell death. In addition, ionizing radiation (IR) in normal
  cells may enhance SIRT3-deacetylated-MnSOD activation, therefore, again protecting
  the cell from ROS-induced cell death. Although it is still controversial, in neurons
  SIRT3 seems to protect cells from excitotoxic injury such as N-methyl-D-aspartate
  (NMDA)-induced neuronal death. SIRT3 deaceylates p53, attenuating p53-BAG2 complex
  stability (BAG2; BCL2-associated athanogene 2), thus decreasing apoptosis. Lymph
  node–positive breast cancer is associated with increased levels of SIRT3. SIRT3
  is also overexpressed in oral cancer and in anoikis-resistant oral squamous cell
  carcinoma (OSCC) cells, thus promoting OSCC cell survival and preventing anoikis-mediated
  cell death. (Lt) The role of SIRT3 in apoptosis, cell death, and tumor suppression.
  In colorectal carcinoma, Bcl-2 knockdown (KD) was associated with SIRT3 upregulation
  and apoptosis by deacetylating AceCS2 and switching on the JNK2 signaling pathway.
  In neurons, low potassium (LK)-induced apoptosis is mediated by SIRT3. In leukemia,
  the treatment with Kaempferol, a flavonoid that auto-oxidizes and generates ROS,
  induces apoptosis by SIRT3 and Bax upregulation, thus switching on caspase-3 cascades
  and apoptosis. SIRT3 is downregulated in human breast cancer cells compared to normal
  controls, and SIRT3−/− mice developed mammary tumors over a 24-month period. In
  human colon carcinoma and osteosarcoma cells, SIRT3 also works as a tumor suppressor
  by suppressing ROS and HIF1-α. In HEK-293 cells, the transient receptor potential
  melastatin-related channel 2 (TRPM2), a nonselective cation channel induces cell
  death in response to oxidative stress via SIRT3. Unlike non-transformed cells, in
  some cancer cells, SIRT3 deacetylates cyclophilin-D, inducing the dissociation of
  hexokinase II/VDAC complex in the mitochondria, thus activating apoptosis.
