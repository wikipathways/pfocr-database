caption: Schematic model of Yvc1 regulation cellular calcium concentration to improve
  growth in the cnb1Δ/Δyvc1Δ/Δ strain under ER stress. The calcineurin mutant strain
  cnb1Δ/Δ was sensitive to ER stress while the double mutant cnb1Δ/Δyvc1Δ/Δ recovered
  the growth. The URP pathway was effectively activated in these mutants. However,
  the deletion of TRP channel Yvc1 could inhibit the release of Ca2+ from vacuole
  and reduce the cellular calcium concentration in response to ER stress. Thereby,
  the vacuolar membrane permeability (VMP) was inhibited and the cell vitality was
  maintained, leading to the improvement of cell growth.
