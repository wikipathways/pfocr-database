caption: 'Regulation of the autophagy pathway by E3 ubiquitin ligases. E3 ligases
  mutated in neurodegenerative diseases (in green) target core components of the autophagy
  machinery, from the initiation (1) to the fusion of the autophagosome to lysosomes
  (4) to positively (+) or negatively (−) regulate autophagic flux. Following (macro)autophagy
  induction, the inhibitory effect of mTORC1 on the ULK complex is lifted, allowing
  the activation of the ULK1/2 kinases (1), leading to a cascade of phosphorylation
  events that contribute to the activation of the PI3KIII complex via Beclin1, to
  promote PI3P synthesis on nascent phagophore (2). Interacting with PI3P, WIPI2 subsequently
  recruits ATG16L1 in complex with ATG12-ATG5, the E3 ligase that catalyzes the lipidation
  of LC3 at membranes, a step (3) required for membrane elongation and autophagosome
  formation. Fusion with lysosome (4) leads to the degradation of sequestered material,
  which can be non-specific (called bulk autophagy) or specific (called selective
  autophagy). Selectivity is triggered by ubiquitination of substrates [(bottom panels)
  mitochondria, pathogens, and Ferritin], and mediated by adaptor proteins that direct
  them to autophagosomes thanks to LC3-interacting region (LIR domain) and ubiquitin-associated
  domain (UBA) domain. “Rec” for mitophagy: p62, OPTN, NDP52, TAX1BP1, NBR1, or AMBRA1;
  of note, some mitochondrial proteins have a LIR domain and contribute to mitophagy.
  “Rec” for xenophagy: p62, NDP52, NBR1. Myco., Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Salm.,
  Salmonella Thyphimurium. mTOR signaling, which is an upstream inhibitor of autophagy
  induction is also regulated by E3 ligases: through action on mTOR inhibitors (DEPTOR)
  and transcriptional control of autophagy genes (TFEB). Dashed line: partial demonstration
  of mechanistic. E3 ligase-dependent ubiquitination can trigger degradative or non-degradative
  routes. Several E3 ligases act at multiple steps of the autophagy pathway and can
  have antagonized actions.'
