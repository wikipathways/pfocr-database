caption: Viruses manipulate autophagy to promote their replication. Double-membrane
  vesicles (DMVs), following picornaviral infection, furnish the virus an excellent
  physical platform for viral RNA assembly and replication. And some picornaviruses,
  such as PV and coxsackievirus, can spread via extracellular microvesicles (EMVs)
  in a non-lytic manner between cells. The poliovirus triggered membranes can be specifically
  induced by the co-expression of two viral proteins, 2BC and 3A. HCV infection prompts
  the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, which separately increases and decreases the
  maturation of autophagosomes. And Rubicon can be triggered by HCV NS4B protein alone.
  IRGM, known to contribute to autophagy, is localized at the Golgi apparatus and
  regulates the fragmentation of Golgi membranes in response to HCV infection, resulting
  in co-localization of Golgi vesicles with replicating HCV. Non-structural viral
  proteins 2B, 2C and 3A with LC3 and viral structural protein VP1 with Atg5, and
  LC3 with LAMP-1 co-localize in FMDV-infected cells. DENV stimulates and needs AMPK
  signaling and AMPK-independent suppression of mTORC1 activity for proviral lipophagy.
  ZIKV NS4A and NS4B, down-regulate cooperatively the Akt-mTOR pathway and induce
  cellular dysregulation. ZIKV NS3-mediated cleavage of FAM134B blocks the formation
  of ER and viral protein enriched autophagosomes, and the reticulophagy pathway further.
  As for HIV, nondegradative stages of autophagy promote its yields at early stage;
  HIV Gag-derived proteins bind to and interact with LC3, and autophagy enhances productive
  Gag processing. And when autophagy progresses to the maturation stages, HIV protein
  Nef plays as an anti-autophagic maturation factor by the interaction with the autophagy
  regulatory factor Beclin-1, which protects HIV from degradation. The dual and delicate
  interaction of HIV with the autophagy pathway enhances viral yields by utilizing
  the early stages while inhibiting the late stages. SARS-CoV and MHV, activate the
  formation of DMVs. And MHV utilizes the pathway of EDEMosome formation to generate
  the DMVs. IAV M2 interacts with LC3 and leads to LC3 re-localization. And a highly
  pathogenic avian H5N1 strain of IAV is able to block mTOR, activating autophagy.
  HPIV3 induces incomplete autophagy by blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion, leading
  to increased virus production. The viral phosphoprotein binds to SNAP29 and suppresses
  its interaction with syntaxin17, therefore preventing these two host SNARE proteins
  from mediating autophagosome-lysome fusion. Matrix protein of HPIV3 shuttles to
  mitochondria and interacts with TUFM. The interaction between M and the LC3 protein
  that mediates autophagosome formation. These interactions with both TUFM and LC3
  are required for the induction of mitophagy and result in inhibition of the type
  I interferon response. In RV-infected cells, RV NSP4 co-localized with LC3 in cap-like
  structures associated with viroplasms. And NSP4 enhances the release of calcium
  from the ER into the cytoplasm, leading to CaMKK-β signaling to trigger autophagy.
  HBV HBx maintains interrelationships with PI3KC3 and DAPK, and directly activates
  Beclin-1 to trigger autophagy. EBV LMP1 up-regulates PERK and the unfolded protein
  response to drive its own synthesis
