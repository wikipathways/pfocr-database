caption: 'Overview of the complement cascade. The complement cascade can be initiated
  by three pathways: (1) the classical pathway, (2) the mannose-binding lectin (MBL)
  pathway, and (3) the alternative pathway. The resultant C3 convertases can continuously
  cleave C3; however, after they are generated, the alternative pathway C3 convertase
  dominates in amplifying production of C3b (green looping arrow). The C3 convertases
  associate with an additional C3b to form the C5 convertases, which cleave C5 to
  C5a+C5b. C5b recruits C6, C7, C8, and 10–16 C9 molecules to generate the terminal
  membrane attack complex (MAC), which inserts pores into cell membranes to induce
  cell lysis. C3a and C5a are potent signaling molecules, which through their G protein–coupled
  receptors C3aR and C5aR, respectively, can promote inflammation, chemoattraction
  of leukocytes, vasodilation, cytokine and chemokine release, and activation of adaptive
  immunity. fB, factor B; fD, factor D; fP, factor P; MASP, mannose-binding lectin-associated
  serine protease.'
