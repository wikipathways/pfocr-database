caption: A hypothetical model for the tanshinone-IIA-mediated attenuation of lipid
  accumulation in hepatic cells. Tanshinone IIA promotes ACC1 phosphorylation to attenuate
  fatty-acid synthesis and lipogenesis. Tanshinone IIA down-regulates FASN, ACC1,
  and SCD1 expression by inhibiting the LXRα-mediated transcriptional activation,
  resulting in a reduction in endogenous and fatty-acid-induced lipogenesis as well
  as lipid-droplet accumulation in hepatic cells.
