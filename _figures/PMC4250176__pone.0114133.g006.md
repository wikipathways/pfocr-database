caption: ASC differentiation was initiated for 72 hours for pooled MYC siRNA or non-targeting
  (NT) control samples and global gene expression patterns determined by mircroarray.
  A network representation of the MetaCore pathway maps identifies closely related
  clusters of major biological processes perturbed by MYC knockdown. Here, edges reflect
  the intrinsic structure of the MetaCore ontology, and functional pathways are shown
  if they are enriched in up regulated (red) or down regulated (blue) genes. The size
  of the circles corresponds to the percentage of genes identified in each indicated
  pathway. The color intensity reflects the FDR adjusted p-value assigned to the category.
