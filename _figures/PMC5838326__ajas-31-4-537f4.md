caption: Changes in the hepatic expression levels of genes for gluconeogenesis pathway
  following castration of bulls. Castration upregulated the mRNA levels of several
  gluconeogenesis genes, including PCCB, ACSS3* (p = 0.06), PC, PCK2, LDHA, and LDHB,
  GK, and GPD1, demonstrating that castration increases the transcriptional activities
  of hepatic gluconeogenesis from several glucogenic substrates (propionate, lactate,
  and glycerol). ACSS3, acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 3; DLAT, dihyrolipoamide
  S-acetyltransferase; DLD, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; FBP1, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate;
  G6PC, glucose 6-phosphatase; GK, glycerol kinase; GPD1, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-1;
  GPD2, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-2; HK2, hexokinase 2; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase
  A; LDHB, lactate dehydrogenase B; MCEE, methymalonyl CoA epimerase; MUT, methylmalonyl
  CoA mutase; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PCCB, propionyl CoA carboxylase beta; PCCA,
  propionyl CoA carboxylase alpha; PCK1, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase;
  PCK2, mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PDHA1, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (lipoamide) alpha 1, cytosolic; PFKL, phosphofructokinase-1; PKLR, pyruvate kinase;
  SLC2A2, solute carrier family 2 member 2; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; F6P, fructose
  6-phosphate; F1,6P, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
