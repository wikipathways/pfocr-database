caption: Differential LSEC Signalling in Models of Acute or Chronic Injury. A. The
  acute injury model with bolus administration of CCl4 in conjunction with acetaminophen
  allows liver regeneration to proceed efficiently as predominant CXCR7 signalling
  promotes Id1-mediated release of paracrine factors such as HGF and Wnt2. B. The
  chronic injury models of iterative CCl4 or bile duct ligation promote fibrosis as
  persistent FGFR1 signalling promotes MAPK-mediated CXCR4 activation along with attenuation
  of the CXCR7/Id1 pathway.
