  model for the canonical Wnt signal transduction (the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway). (B)
  The simplified model for the canonical Wnt signalling in vertebrates. In the absence
  of the Wnt ligands, the destruction protein complex (including APC, Axin, GSK-3β,
  CK1, β-Trcp, and β-Catenin) works in favour of β-Catenin phosphorylation and its
  subsequent ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (u letters on β-Catenin in the destruction
  complex). β-Catenin phosphorylation occurs at some serine and threonine residues
  located at amino-terminal segment of the protein (p letters on β-Catenin in the
  destruction complex). The protein kinases, GSK-3β and CK1, are responsible for the
  phosphorylation of β-Catenin in the destruction complex. In the presence of the
  Wnt proteins and activation of the Frizzled receptors, some components of the destruction
  complex, including Axin and GSK-3β, are recruited to the cell membrane via Dvl protein
  and form a protein complex, called “signalosome”.[23] Phosphorylation of LRP co-receptor
  plays an important role in formation and stabilization of signalosome. Dissociation
  of the destruction complex leads to a significant decrease in β-Catenin phosphorylation;
  therefore, this protein accumulates in the cell. Increase in β-Catenin cellular
  levels may lead to its nuclear translocation and its interaction with the TCF/Lef
  transcription factors. Transcriptional regulation of some very important cellular
  genes appears to be the final outcome of β-Catenin nuclear translocation. NM, nuclear
