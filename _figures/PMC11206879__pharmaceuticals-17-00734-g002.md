caption: (A) The canonical activation of the NF-κB pathway begins with the activation
  of receptors located on the cell surface (toll-like receptors, TLR; receptor tyrosine
  kinases, RTK; and tumor necrosis factor receptors, TNFR, for instance), which then
  emit signals through adaptor proteins to activate the IkB kinase (IKK) complex (composed
  of IKK-α, the catalytic subunit IKK-β, and the regulatory subunit NEMO). Once activated,
  the IKK complex catalyzes the polyubiquitination and the phosphorylation of the
  IkBs leading to their degradation by proteasome 26S. After this, the NF-κB dimers
  that are released from their inhibitors and translocate to the nucleus, where they
  activate the transcription of many genes through binding to the consensus sequence
  5′-GGGRN W YYCC-3′ (R = purine base, N = any base, W = adenine or thymine, and Y
  = pyrimidine base). Alternatively, the non-canonical signaling cascade begins with
  the activation of LT-β or BAFF receptors, which emit signals through the cytoplasm
  leading to the phosphorylation of the NIK protein, which, in turn, phosphorylates
  the IKK complex (formed by only two IKK-α subunits). Once activated, this complex
  phosphorylates NF-κB2/p100, in two C-terminal sites, leading to its proteolytic
  cleavage. This process partially degrades p100 into p52. Subsequently, the NF-κB
  dimer is released and translocates to the nucleus, activating gene transcription.
  (B) In cancer cells, mutations, gene amplification and gene fusions involving its
  subunits, or interplay with other dysregulated signaling pathways may lead to the
  constitutive activation of NF-κB which contributes to cancer development and progression
  by increasing the expression of genes associated with antiapoptosis, survival, chemo-
  and radioresistance, adherence, invasion, and metastasis. This figure was created
