caption: Alteration of the IFN-I signaling pathway by HTLV-1. Binding of IFN-I on
  IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2 IFNAR receptors activates the Jak1 and Tyk2 kinases, which phosphorylate
  STAT1 and STAT2 proteins. Activated STATs form heterodimers that bind to IRF9 to
  generate the ISGF3 complex. This complex migrates into the nucleus and activates
  the transcription of ISGs by recruiting the co-activator CBP/p300. HTLV-1 hinders
  Tyk2 and STAT2 phosphorylation. Moreover, HTLV-1 Tax interacts with CBP/p300 and
  inhibits its recruitment by the ISGF3 complex. From data published in [,].
