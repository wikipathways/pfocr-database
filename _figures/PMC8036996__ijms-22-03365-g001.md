caption: 'Summary of the pathogenic mechanisms of SSAO/VAP-1 in exacerbating the progress
  of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)-AD. Through the generation of toxic metabolites
  from SSAO activity (ammonia, methylgioxal, formaldehyde, and H2O2), SSAO/VAP-1 induces
  the vascular degeneration on both endothelial and smooth muscle cells through several
  mechanisms: (i) oxidative stress, (ii) induction of apoptosis through the mitochondrial
  pathway, (iii) induction of the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (selectins,
  VCAM, ICAM…), (iv) induction of protein and lipid crosslinking, and (v) increase
  in Aβ aggregation. The resulting vascular degeneration, together with the protein
  and lipid crosslinkage and the Aβ aggregation contribute to the vascular degeneration
  and the CAA pathology, and these generate a positive feedback loop reinforcing SSAO/VAP-1
  overexpression. Aβ aggregation itself also contributes to the SSAO/VAP-1 increase.'
