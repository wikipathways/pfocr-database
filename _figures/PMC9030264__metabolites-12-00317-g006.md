caption: Schematic representation of a model depicting the cellular impact of IRI-160AA
  on Karlodinium veneficum revealed by this study and previously reported molecular
  and physiological data [,,,]. In this model, IRI-160AA stimulated ROS production,
  inducing the formation of oxidative stress markers, methionine sulfoxide (MetO),
  and formylkynurenine (N′-formylkynurenine; NFK) in the cell pellets of the algicide
  treatment of K. veneficum. Cellular antioxidants also increased in response to ROS,
  including salicylic acid (SA), 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), proline, and B vitamins
  (riboflavin, thiamine, pyridoxal, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide). Other compounds
  indicative of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, and programmed cell death
  (PCD) that increased in the cell pellets included N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA),
  phenylalanine, and cyclo(phenylalanine-proline) (cFP). cFP can enter the cells by
  simple diffusion, or by the biosynthesis from phenylalanine and proline, where the
  pathway has not been fully characterized (indicated by “?” in the figure). The figure
  was created with BioRender.com.
