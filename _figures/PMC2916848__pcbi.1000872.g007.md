caption: (a) The model contains five reaction subsets, consisting of reaction 1 (red),
  reactions 2 and 3 (magenta), reactions 4, 5, 6 and 7 (blue), reactions 8, 9 and
  10 (green); and reaction 11 (gray). (b) There are three elements of the basis, one
  consisting of reactions 1, 2, 3 and 11 () and thus corresponding to the metabolic
  pathway, a second consisting of reactions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (), corresponding
  to both metabolic and replacement cycles, and the last consisting of reactions 1,
  8, 9 and 10 (), which is the pathway that replaces the replacement catalyst SU.
  Note that elements  and  do not produce STU, and element  produces neither SU nor
  ST, each of which is produced by the other two elements. Thus none of these elements
  is an enzyme-maintaining mode .
