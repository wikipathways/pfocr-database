caption: 'Illustration of the mTOR–Sema6D–PPARγ signaling pathway in controlling macrophage
  polarization toward anti-inflammatory (antitumorigenic) phenotype M2 via regulation
  of fatty acid uptake and metabolic reprogramming. mTOR is a critical molecule that
  controls SEMAD6 expression and regulates the metabolic status of the cell to promote
  polarization of macrophages. Association of c-Abl tyrosine kinase with SEMA6D with
  the PXXP region of the cytoplasmic SH3 domain promotes reverse signaling, enhanced
  by binding plexin-A4. As a result of SEMA6D-driven reverse signaling, PPARγ expression
  increases and primes metabolic reprogramming events such as fatty acid biosynthesis
  and fatty acid uptake pathways (CD36, Fabp4). SEMA6D–PPARγ signaling is indispensable
  for metabolic reprogramming. Abnormalities in this pathway account for impaired
  fatty acid uptake and metabolic reprogramming, leading to aberrant macrophage polarization.
  Inhibition of upstream mTOR1/2 with Torin1 or activity of c-Abl tyrosine kinase
  with dasatinib suppresses the expression of PPARγ and the anti-inflammatory signature
  genes Arg1 and Chi3l1. Similarly, mutation of the SH3 domain in SEMA6D or absence
  of SEMA6D accounts for defective anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization (low
  expression of anti-inflammatory signature genes: Retnla, Il10, and receptors Cd36,
  Fabp4) along with exaggerated inflammatory responses (IL-12p40, TNF, IL-6). mTOR1/2:
  mammalian target of rapamycin 1/2; PPARγ: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  gamma; RXR: retinoid X receptor; PPRE: peroxisome proliferator hormone response
  elements; LXRα: liver X receptor alpha; Arg1: arginase 1; Chi3l1: chitinase 3 like-1;
  Retnla: resistin-like molecule alpha; CD36: receptor for lipoproteins; Fabp4: Lp:
  lipoproteins; FA: fatty acids; LCFA: long-chain fatty acids; BMDMs: bone marrow-derived
  macrophages. ⟙—inhibition; ↑—upregulation; ↓—downregulation'
