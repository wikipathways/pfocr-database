caption: Effects of anoxia on carbohydrate metabolism in rice coleoptiles. Data mining
  of the transcriptome of aerobic and anoxic coleoptiles allowed the identification
  of the genes involved in starch and Suc metabolism, sugar transport, and glycolysis.
  Genes showing a statistically significant change in expression when the aerobic
  dataset was compared with the anoxic dataset (see “Materials and Methods”) are reported
  on the metabolic pathway shown in this figure. Dotted lines summarize metabolic
  steps catalyzed by several enzymes. Red arrows highlight the metabolic steps that,
  based on transcripts level changes, are strongly up-regulated under anoxia, whereas
  blue arrows indicate down-regulation. It should be remarked that increased mRNA
  level relative to an enzymatic step does not necessarily imply increased activity
  of the enzyme in vivo. The fold change (nX, air versus anoxia) is shown together
  with the gene abbreviation (see text). Fold changes are means of two biological
  replicates.
