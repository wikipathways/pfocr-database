caption: (A) Cartoon describing metabolic pathway from pyruvate to glutamate/glutamine
  in astrocytes, as suggested by Pardo et al. (). Joint pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate
  dehydrogenase activation generates a “new” molecule of citrate as described above.
  Citrate-derived α-ketoglutarate exiting the mitochondrial membrane leaves the astrocytic
  TCA cycle and is transaminated with aspartate to form glutamate, with concomitant
  oxaloacetate (OAA) formation from aspartate. The mitochondrial exit of α-ketoglutarate
  occurs via the ketoglutarate/malate exchanger, generally acknowledged to be expressed
  in astrocytes, and the cytosolic malate with which is exchanged, is generated via
  NADH-supported reduction of aspartate-generated oxaloacetate. No aralar-requiring
  aspartate/glutamate exchanger (Slc1) activity is involved. (B) Proposed expansion
  by Hertz () of the model shown in (A). The expanded model shows astrocytic production
  of glutamine (pathway 1), its transfer to glutamatergic neurons (without indication
  of any extracellular space, because there is no other function for extracellular
  glutamine than astrocyte-to-neuron transfer) and extracellular release as the transmitter
  glutamate (pathway 2), and subsequent reuptake of glutamate and oxidative metabolism
  in astrocytes (pathway 3), with connections between pathways 1 and 3 shown as pathway
  4. Biosynthesis of glutamine is shown in brown and metabolic degradation of glutamate
  in blue. Redox shuttling and astrocytic release of glutamine and uptake of glutamate
  are shown in black, and neuronal uptake of glutamine, hydrolysis to glutamate, and
  its release is shown in red. Reactions involving or resulting from transamination
  between aspartate and oxaloacetate (OAA) are shown in green. Small blue oval is
  pyruvate carrier into mitochondria and small purple oval malate carrier out from
  mitochondria. AGC1, aspartate/glutamate exchanger, aralar; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate;
  Glc, glucose; Pyr, pyruvate; OGC, malate/α-ketoglutarate exchanger. It should be
  noted that (i) aralar activity is required initially for reversal of cytosolic NAD+/NADH
  changes occurring during the one oxidative process occurring during pyruvate formation,
  but subsequently not in astrocytes until the oxidation of glutamate, probably allowing
  rapid glutamate synthesis, and (ii) all reactions are stoichiometrically accounted
  for (A) From Pardo et al. (); (B) From Hertz ().
