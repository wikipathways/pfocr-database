caption: Surface sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A schematic model for cAMP and
  c-di-GMP signaling during early biofilm formation is shown. Subsequent to initial
  interaction with a surface, uncharacterized signals resulting from surface contact
  are detected by the chemotaxis-like protein PilJ and the type IV pilus (TFP), and
  transduced via the sensor histidine kinase FimS (also called AlgZ) and the adenylate
  cyclase CyaB, resulting in the surface-dependent increase in cAMP levels. PilK is
  the methyltransferase for PilJ, while ChpB serves as a demethylase; the methylation
  state of PilJ modulates its activity. cAMP, together with the transcription factor
  Vfr, are required for the transcription of the genes coding for FimS and its cognate
  response regulator AlgR. Phosphorylated AlgR is required for the increased transcription
  of several operons required for TFP biogenesis, including the fimUpilVpilXpilY1pilY2pilE
  operon. Thus, surface contact can establish a positive feedback loop whereby PilJ/TFP-mediated
  signals result in the increased production of TFP; TFP are in turn required for
  surface-associated twitching motility. Furthermore, as outlined in the text, bacterial
  two-hybrid studies indicate physical interactions between PilJ and FimS as well
  as between PilJ and PilA, suggesting that there may be an IM signaling complex required
  to sense and transduce surface signals. Subsequent to the stimulation of cAMP levels
  and transcriptional up-regulation of TFP-associated genes, the levels of PilY1 are
  increased. PilY1 is found on the bacterial cell surface and requires the TFP for
  its efficient secretion. Cell surface PilY1 can signal to SadC (by an unknown mechanism)
  to boost c-di-GMP levels, thereby repressing surface swarming motility and favoring
  the production of sessile cells and the formation of a biofilm. Additional details
  of this pathway can be found in Luo et al. []. The WspR chemotaxis-like system controls
  later exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, also through the surface-dependent stimulation
  of c-di-GMP (not shown) [–].Figure illustration and design copyright 2015 William
