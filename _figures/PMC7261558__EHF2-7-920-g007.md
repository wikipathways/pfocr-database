caption: Schematic representation of β3‐adrenoceptor inhibitory signalling to hypertrophic
  pathways. β3‐AR colocalizes with several effectors in caveolar membranes of cardiac
  myocytes; (right) previously identified coupling to nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
  activates NO/sGC/cGMP/cGK‐I pathway known to attenuate stress‐induced hypertrophy
  (for review, see Farah et al.,); (left) the presently identified interaction with
  AMPK recruits this pathway to inhibit protein synthesis and hypertrophy under stress
  as well as the upstream pro‐hypertrophic mTOR complex; inhibition of mTOR would
  also relieve its negative effect on autophagy, thereby increasing autophagic flux,
  although the latter may also be independently activated by β3‐AR coupling to alternative
  effectors.
