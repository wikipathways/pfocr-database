caption: Overview of DDR core gene amplification across pan-cancer. A) Radar plot
  of the prevalence of copy number gain/amplification (red line) and loss/deletion
  (blue line) events in the 80 “core” DDR genes across nine DDR pathways among the
  10,489 TCGA pan-cancer tumors. The most prevalent amplified gene in each DDR pathway
  is marked in italics with the pan-cancer prevalence. The prevalence of the copy
  number alteration events is indicated by the scale bar. B) Pan-cancer pathway mapper
  for the gene-level copy number alteration prevalence of 80 “core” genes across nine
  DDR pathways. C) The bar chart (left) indicates the total number of cancer patient
  samples showing amplification (GISTIC call = 2) in the top 10 amplified DDR genes,
  and the pie chart (right) shows the cancer-specific prevalence of gene amplification
  (red, GISTIC call = 2) and gain (pink, GISTIC call = 1) for the top 10 amplified
  DDR genes. For a complete list of TCGA cancer type abbreviations, please see https://gdc.cancer.gov/resources-tcga-users/tcga-code-tables/tcga-study-abbreviations.
  D) The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of DDR pathways on genes ranked based
  on their correlation between expression and copy number alterations in the pan-cancer
  tumors.
