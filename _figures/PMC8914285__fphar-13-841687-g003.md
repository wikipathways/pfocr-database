caption: The regulatory network to CCR7. Taking LPS stimulation as an example, the
  Myd88-TRAF6 signal pathway is activated, which then promotes the transduction of
  transcription factors NF-κβ and AP-1 to the nucleus to induce the transcription
  of Ccr7. After leaving the nucleus, Ccr7 mRNAs will locate to the Golgi network
  for de novo synthesis and receptor trafficking of CCR7 protein. Otherwise, Ccr7
  mRNAs interact with miR-21–5p and undergo posttranscriptional regulation for degradation.
  On the other hand, upon CCL19 stimulation, CCR7 will be phosphorylated by GRKs,
  accompanied by the recruitment of β-arrestin, and form endosomal vesicles. Then,
  CCL19 will be sorted to lysosomal degradation while CCR7 can move to the Golgi network,
  where they will recruit RhoGEF Vav1 and its effector, GTP-bound Rac1. Finally, endomembrane-residing
  multi-protein-signaling complex comprising CCR7 can recycle back to the plasma membrane
  and promote the accumulation of actin filaments and cytoskeleton rearrangement.
