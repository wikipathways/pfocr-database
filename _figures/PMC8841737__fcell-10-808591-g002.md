caption: 'The four main mechanisms showing how ncRNAs work in the drug resistance
  of GIST. In GISTs, ncRNAs regulate the process of drug resistance mainly in the
  five mechanisms: OXPHOS (with purple background), autophagy (with green background),
  apoptosis (with orange background), drug target changes (with blue background) and
  activation of significant signaling pathways (with pink background). For the regulation
  of OXPHOS, the ncRNA regulate the Complex II on the inner membrane of mitochondrion.
  NcRNAs also play pivotal roles in the formation of autophagosome, thus modifying
  the resistance-induced autophagy. The signaling pathway of apoptosis are displayed
  and the ncRNAs involving in this process are shown, too. The figure in the lower
  right corner exhibits the transmembrane structure of KIT and the regulation of ncRNAs
  on KIT. Furthermore, the figures in the lower left corner show the main signaling
  pathways (PTEN/PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT3, PTPN18/pFAK and RASSF1A/Hippo pathway), which
  are the targets of ncRNAs in the resistance. MiRNAs are distinguished from lncRNA
  by the different shapes. Activating signals from the receptor on the membrane are
  shown as the blue wave-like arrow. The red arrow represents the stimulatory modification
  between the proteins, and the blue “T” symbol shows the inhibitory modification.'
