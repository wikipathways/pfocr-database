caption: Schematic of canonical BMP signaling pathway. Binding of BMP ligands promotes
  dimerization of type I and type II BMP receptors (BMPR). The BMPR-II phosphorylates
  BMPRI which in turn phosphorylate phosphorylates the downstream effector proteins
  (Smad1/5/8). The phophorylated Smad1/5/8 forms a complex with Smad4 and translocate
  from cytoplasm to nucleus and induce the expression of the osteoblast-related genes.
  Several extracellular protein including Chordin and Noggin, Samd6/7, and smurf anatagonize
  the BMP signaling pathway. Adapted with permission from ().
