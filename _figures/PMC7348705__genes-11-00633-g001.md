caption: Summary of early responses in nitrate signaling and assimilation. NO3−signaling
  pathway switches its affinity via phosphorylation (modified from Undurraga []).
  Nitrate-responsive genes are depicted in light green, transcription factors in purple,
  and microRNAs in grey. For clarity purposes, the cell nucleus is shown. Phosphatidylinositol-specific
  (PI-PLC) and Ca2+-dependent pathways. At Low NO3− condition, protein kinases CBL1/9–CIPK23
  complex phosphorylates NRT1.1 and changes it into a high-affinity transporter, which
  activates PLC and results in calcium influx (Ca2+ acts as a second messenger). This
  cascade mediates changes in the expression of transcription factors (TGA1/4 *) and
  genes involved in nitrate transport (NRT2.1, NRT2.2, and NRT3.1) and nitrate assimilation
  (NIA1 and NiR). Nonphosphorylated form of NRT1.1-induced signaling. Nitrate-induced
  Ca2+-ANR1 signaling that promotes lateral root (LR) initiation is assumed to be
  a nonphosphorylated form of NRT1.1 signaling after the supply of nitrate in limited-nitrate
  conditions. (C) PI-PLC and Ca2+-independent pathways. Conversely, AFB3 is regulated
  by nitrate in a phospholipase C (PLC)- and calcium-independent manner. ABF3 modulates
  the expression of NAC4 and OBP4 with subsequent effects on root remodeling. Finally,
  nitrate assimilation produces organic N, which induces miR393 and represses miR167
  (grey) and regulates the abundance of AFB3 and ARF8, respectively. * TGA1 and TGA4
  are redundant regulatory factors that mediate nitrate responses in Arabidopsis roots.
  However, the interaction between TGA4 and the PLC–calcium pathway has not been experimentally
  validated.
