caption: When CRPS patient IgM is injected intraplantarly or intrathecally into 3-week
  post fracture muMT mice it attaches to autoantigenic material released from apoptotic
  cells in the skin or spinal cord. When pentameric IgM binds to antigenic material
  larger than itself it can induce the conformational changes required to allow C1q
  binding. C1q, together with C1r and C1s, form the C1 complex that is activated when
  C1q binds to the antigen-antibody complex. Activation of the C1 complex initiates
  the classical complement pathway, thus generating the C5a complement components
  capable of activating the C5aR receptors expressed by skin macrophages and spinal
  cord microglia and inducing the release of the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1,
  IL-6, and TNF) contributing to nociceptive sensitization in the fracture model of
  CRPS.
