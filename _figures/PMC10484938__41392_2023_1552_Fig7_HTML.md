caption: Metabolic remodeling in the brain and liver following STF. STF induced a
  global remodeling of lipid and amino acid metabolism, especially with respect to
  BCAA, ArAA, neurotransmitter, methionine and the citrulline–NO cycle for the adaptive
  responses of the brain under limited nutrition conditions. In contrast to the brain,
  STF induced significant remodeling of energy metabolism in the liver. Enhanced FA
  oxidation and declined glycolysis and TCA cycle, were found in liver in the fasted
  state. The metabolites and genes were linked to pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html)
