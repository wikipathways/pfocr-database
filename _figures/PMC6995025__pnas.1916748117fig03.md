caption: Differential expression of bacteriocyte and Buchnera metabolism. A schematic
  representation of how bacteriocyte, Buchnera, and mitochondrial metabolism differ
  between host proliferative (P; blue) and metabolic (M; red) states, characteristic
  of aphid genotypes with low and high Buchnera titer, respectively. Arrows represent
  enzymatic reactions or the direction of small-molecule transport. Arrow color indicates
  up-regulation of the corresponding gene in either the proliferative (blue) or metabolic
  state (red), or the absence of differential gene expression (black). The large yellow
  rectangle represents a bacteriocyte, while Buchnera is depicted in gray as two concentric
  circles, representing the symbiosomal membrane (gray) and the Buchnera double membrane
  (black). A mitochondrion is depicted as a blue rectangle with double membrane (black).
  Broken light gray lines designate metabolites transported into or exported from
  Buchnera. GenBank accession numbers or Buchnera gene names are provided for chemical
  reactions (arrows) catalyzed by encoded enzymes. All labeled A. pisum genes are
  differentially expressed (P < 0.05 after adjustment for false discovery), while
  labeled Buchnera genes represent those with either P < 0.05 or inner-quartile range
  > 0.1. The 87 and 106 aphid genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and transporter
  activity, respectively, represent genes belonging to KEGG pathway 00190 and GO:0005215,
  respectively.
