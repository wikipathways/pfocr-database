caption: Host lipids are critical for the uptake and destruction of fungal pathogens.
  A simplified depiction of several stages at which lipids are known to be essential
  for the clearance of fungi by phagocytic immune cells. (A) Upon the initial recognition
  of a fungal cell, pathogen recognition receptors cluster in a microdomain reminiscent
  of a lipid raft. This domain is enriched in sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol (Chol),
  and serves to form a signaling platform from which the phagocytic process is coordinated.
  (B) The turnover of phosphoinositide species is essential to the extension of pseudopodia
  around a particle. Emanating from the signaling platform at the center of the phagocytic
  synapse is a leading wave of PIP2, followed by a trailing wave of PIP3. High levels
  of PIP2 initiate filamentous actin polymerization and thereby initiate the actin-driven
  protrusion which extends the pseudopodia. The conversion of PIP2 to other lipid
  species such as PIP3 is essential for actin disassembly and recycling. (C) After
  internalization, lipids such as ceramide (Cer) are essential for the fusion and
  fission of the phagosome with the compartments of the endosomal pathway, such as
  the early endosome (EE), late endosome (LE), recycling endosome (RE), and lysosome
  (Lys). (D) After fusion with the lysosome, the degradation of sphingomyelin to ceramide
  is essential for the activation of lysosomal components such as cathepsins, which
  cooperate to destroy the fungal cell.
