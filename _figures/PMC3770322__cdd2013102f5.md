caption: Scheme of the AHR-E2F1-CHK1 axis, a novel anti-apoptotic signaling cascade
  in KC. (a) The AHR represses the expression of p27KIP1 and thereby maintains CDK2-dependent
  Rb phosphorylation. This in turn enables autoregulatory E2F1 expression as well
  as CHK1 expression. CHK1 ensures checkpoint control and enables cellular survival
  upon UVB exposure. (b) AHR inhibition results in an increased expression of CDK2-inhibitory
  p27KIP1 and the subsequent repression of E2F1 and CHK1 expression, respectively.
  The loss of CHK1 impairs proper checkpoint control and sensitizes UVB-damaged KC
  to apoptotic cell death
