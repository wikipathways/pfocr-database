caption: Downstream regulatory effects of NOTCH signaling on keratinocyte proliferation
  and differentiation. P53 induces NOTCH signaling though binding of a promotor region.
  Activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway involves proteolytic cleavage of the NOTCH
  intracellular domain, which is able to suppress AP-1 (a P53 inhibitor) further promoting
  NOTCH signaling. NOTCH down regulates keratinocyte proliferation through inhibition
  of p63, a transcription factor necessary for epidermal growth, and via enhancing
  expression of CDKN1A. NOTCH signaling regulates keratinocyte differentiation, through
  enhancing expression of transcription regulators (IRF6 and the Hes/Hey genes), as
  well as promoting signaling through the retinoic acid pathway. FOXP1 and IRF4 play
  a regulatory role in NOTCH signaling, both having a repressive function.
