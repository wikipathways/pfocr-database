caption: The protective effect of farrerol against CDDP-related CKD and its potential
  mechanism. Cisplatin can accumulate in epithelial tubule cells, causing mitochondrial
  dysfunction and excessive ROS. Damaged cells can induce inflammation by triggering
  the activation of p-NF-κB/NLRP3. In addition, the generated ROS or chronic unresolved
  inflammation can also stimulate the production of renal fibrosis and the development
  of CKD via TGF-β/Smad signaling. Farrerol can activate Nrf2/ARE, then increase PINK1/Parkin-mediated
  mitophagy and eliminate damaged mitochondria.
