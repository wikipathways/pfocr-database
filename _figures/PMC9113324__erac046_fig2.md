caption: Wax ester biosynthesis. The wax ester biosynthetic pathway involves two steps.
  First, NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of an acyl-CoA/ACP to the corresponding alcohol
  is catalysed by a fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR). Next, a wax synthase (WS) esterifies
  an acyl-CoA/ACP with a fatty alcohol to produce a wax ester. Free coenzyme A (CoA)
  or acyl carrier protein (ACP) is released in both reactions.
