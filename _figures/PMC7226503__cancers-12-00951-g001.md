caption: Regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway by epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG).
  (A,B) Janus kinase (JAK) mediated phosphorylation of STAT proteins promoted their
  accumulation in nucleus to regulate expression of a plethora of genes. (C–E) EGCG
  showcased remarkable ability to shut down the JAK/STAT pathway by inhibition of
  Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 1 (STAT1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).
  EGCG also activated negative regulators of STAT-driven signaling. Activation of
  Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-2) was effective in
  inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling. Different oncogenes particularly, inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase have been shown to be under direct control of STAT signaling. (F,G)
  Vascular endothelial growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF/VEGFR)
  signaling is also regulated by EGCG. EGCG interacted with VEGF. Additionally, EGCG
  inhibited phosphorylation of VEGFR.
