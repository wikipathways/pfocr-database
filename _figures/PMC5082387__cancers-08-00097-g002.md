caption: 'TAM-dependent immunity. Schematic representation of the major cellular functions
  of TAM receptors in the regulation of immunity. TAM-signaling functions as a pleiotropic
  inhibitory pathway in charge of resolving inflammation by dampening the activation
  of innate cells as well as restoring tissue function through promotion of tissue
  repair and clearance of apoptotic cells. Viruses can mimic apoptotic cell death
  to usurp TAM-dependent inhibitory pathways for their benefit. In a cancer setting,
  tumor cells induce TAM signaling to: (i) dampen NK-cell based anti-tumoral responses;
  (ii) reduce innate cells-mediated inflammation and possibly increase the ratio of
  M2-to-M1 intratumoral macrophages; and (iii) to directly promote its own growth
  and metastasis. A possible role for TAM signaling inhibiting Natural Killer T (NKT)
  cells has been proposed but is not presented here (see main text). A simplified
  view of the as yet identified underlying molecular mechanisms regulating these bioactivities
  is presented. Arrows indicate activating interactions. Flat-ended lines indicate
