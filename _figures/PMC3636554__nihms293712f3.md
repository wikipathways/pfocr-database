caption: Panel A. IFN-γ/receptor interaction activates at least 2 distinct pathways
  in human cells that limit chlamydial development. The first increases indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase
  (IDO) activity, activating tryptophan to kynurenine catalysis and reducing host
  intracellular tryptophan concentration, which induces chlamydial persistence [].
  Genital C. trachomatis serovars can use exogenous indole to synthesize tryptophan,
  thus evading this response. In contrast, ocular serovars, which lack functional
  trpA/B genes, cannot utilize indole [; ]. The IFN-γ-inducible 65 kD guanylate binding
  proteins (GPBs) may also restrict C. trachomatis growth in human epithelial cells
  by activating autophagosomal destruction of the chlamydiae and/or by blocking chlamydial
  lipid acquisition []. As host sphingomyelin synthesis is required for efficient
  reactivation of C. trachomatis persistence [], the GBPs may function to keep persistent
  chlamydiae (induced by tryptophan limitation or other stimuli) from re-entering
  the productive developmental cycle until they can be disposed of by the host autophagic
  machinery. Panel B. IFN-γ/receptor interaction on murine cells inhibits chlamydial
  development primarily by inducing immunity-related GTPases (IRGs).C. trachomatis-infection
  can also increase IRG accumulation via a cPLA2 and IFN-β-dependent pathway []. IRGs
  do not induce persistence but may restrict both normal chlamydial development and
  recovery from persistence by inhibiting sphingomyelin transport [] and/or by increasing
  host autophagic activity [].C. muridarum, is more resistant to the anti-chlamydial
  effects of murine IRGs than are human C. trachomatis serovars due to the production
  of secreted inhibitory effectors [; ], one of which may be the cytotoxin []. Red
  lines represent those pathways that restrict chlamydial development; green lines
  those that promote chlamydial productive replication; arrowheads represent activation
  events and “T”s indicate inhibition.
