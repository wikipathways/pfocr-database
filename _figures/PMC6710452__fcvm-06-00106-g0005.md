caption: A cross-talk between inflammatory pathways and RNA silencing machinery in
  hepatocytes in the pathogenesis of obesity. Biological interaction between inflammatory
  signaling pathway and protein translation regulation via PKR within the hepatocyte
  in metabolic stress responses. PKR is activated by lipid-mediated stress within
  obese metabolic tissues and induces concordant inflammatory responses, in which
  endogenous dsRNAs mediate PKR activation. Upon activation, PKR forms an inflammatory
  protein complex, using TRBP, Dicer, and RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which
  leads to protein translation suppression via phosphorylation of elf2α and enhances
  inflammation via activation of JNK pathway. Ago2-mediated RNA silencing that regulates
  protein translation also plays a critical role in disputing metabolic homeostasis
  in the pathogenesis of obesity.
