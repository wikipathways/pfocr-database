caption: 'BC-T: IDC; BC-S: non-tumor adjacent breast tissue. Box plots: red, normalized
  concentration of the metabolite in BC-T. Box plots: green, normalized concentration
  of the metabolite in BC-S. In one-carbon metabolism, carbon unit generation into
  different cellular outputs involves a complex containing three pathways: the folate
  cycle, the methionine cycle, and the transsulfuration pathway. Compared with non-tumor
  breast adjacent tissue, metabolites that fuel one-carbon metabolism (serine, glycine,
  threonine, and methionine), in addition to classical pathways previously described
  in cancer (i. e., glycolysis, glutaminolysis, fatty acid metabolism), were all increased
  in IDC. These metabolites seem to work together to meet most requirements of metabolic
  pathways involved in cell proliferation, including cellular biosynthesis (nucleotide
  and amino acid synthesis, and membrane formation), maintenance of the genome (through
  the nucleotide pool), epigenetic regulation (methylation), and regulation of the
  redox state. GCKR: sum of hexoses; G6P: glucose 6-phosphate; F6P: fructose 6-phosphate;
  F-1,6BP: fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; G3P: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 3-PG: 3-phosphoglycerate;
  1-3 BG: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 2-PG: 2-phosphoglycerate; PEP: phosphoenolpyruvic
  acid; ADMA: asymmetric dimethylarginine; NO: nitric oxide; ROS: reactive oxygen
  species; BCAA: branched-chain amino acid.'
