caption: T cells metabolic reprogramming. Naïve T cells are highly dependent on Oxidative
  Phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and utilize catabolic metabolism which involves breaking
  down metabolites into smaller units that are either metabolized to produce energy
  or utilized in anabolic reactions. Upon antigen recognition, naïve T cells differentiate
  into Teff cells and most of these Teff cells die upon antigen clearance, but a subset
  of long-lived memory T cells (Tm) sustain. Teff cells show metabolic shift to glycolysis
  and show increased pentose phosphate pathway activity. Teff cells tend to utilize
  glutamine instead of glucose as a major lipogenic precursor. Teff cells show hyperpolarized
  mitochondrial membrane potential, with a simultaneous rise in the production of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) that further mediate damage and inflammation. Tm cells
  show increased fatty acid oxidation. Rapamycin, which inhibits glycolysis, and Metformin
  which induces AMPK activity, that is involved in glycolysis inhibition, have shown
  to attenuate GVHD. This is mediated by enhanced fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in donor
  T cells which may reduce alloreactivity of T cells and enhance regulatory T cell
  (Treg) function.
