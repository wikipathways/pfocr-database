caption: (A) Simplified model of iron transport via trans-cellular pathway in enterocytes.
  Dietary iron is absorbed on the apical side of enterocytes [E-AS] in form of ferritin,
  heme, or as Fe2+. A molecular background behind the uptake of ferritin by enterocytes
  is not yet clearly understood. Internalized ferritin undergoes degradation in lysosomes
  and Fe2+ is released. Endocytosis of heme is mediated by HCP1 (haem carrier protein
  1). Heme is degraded in endosomes resulting in release of Fe2+. Nutritional iron
  has to be first reduced from Fe3+ to Fe2+ by ferrireductase DCYTB (duodenal cytochrome
  b) and it is uptaken as divalent cation by the enterocytes via DMT1 (divalent metal
  transporter 1), which operate in mode of Fe2+:H+ symporter. Recycling of H+ is maintained
  by NHE (Na+/H+ xchanger). SCFA (short chain fatty acids) produced by microbiota
  support the acidification on luminal side of the membrane. Fe2+ is exported from
  enterocytes on the basolateral side (E-BLS) by FPN1 (ferroportin 1). Released Fe2+
  is oxidized by a transmembrane copper-dependent ferroxidase HEPH [hephaestin] to
  Fe3+, which is utilized by transferrin in circulation. A was modified from Gulec
  et al. []. (B) Involvement of microbial metabolite signaling in systemic Fe homeostasis.
  Microbial metabolites DAP (1,3-diaminopropane) and reuterin (3-hydroxypropionaldehyde)
  inhibit ARNT (aryl hydro-carbon receptor nuclear translocator)–HIF-2α (transcription
  factor) heterodimerization/translocation. This inhibition results in downregulation
  of expression of DMT1, DcytB and FPN genes, which encode for the key components
  of Fe homeostasis and Fe2+ transport in enterocytes. Moreover, microbial metabolites
  DAP and propionate inhibit HIF-2α expression, thus influencing expression of Fe
  homeostatic factors/transporters.
