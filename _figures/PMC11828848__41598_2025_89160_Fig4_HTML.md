caption: 'Enzymes of energy metabolic pathways divergent in UGT2B17-deficient livers.
  Glucose-6-phosphate is a central metabolite produced by the phosphorylation of glucose
  by glucokinase (GCK). Its fate is diverse, feeding glycolysis, the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) and the uronic acid pathway. Lower GCK and higher hexose 6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (H6PD) and transketolase (TKT) expression could favor the pentose
  phosphate pathway and production of NADPH. Serine, glycine and NADH production catalyzed
  by 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is reduced. GCK: glucokinase; H6PD:
  hexose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; UGGT1: UDP-glucose glycoprotein transferase 1;
  TKT: transketolase. PC: pyruvate carboxylase; TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle. Created
