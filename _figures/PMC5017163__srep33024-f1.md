caption: 'Differences in enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism between Synechococcus
  7942 and Synechocystis 6803 were included. Blue indicates isozymes in Synechocystis
  6803 that are missing in Synechococcus 7942. Green indicates isozyme in Synechocystis
  6803 with higher amount of isozymes in comparison to Synechococcus 7942. Yellow
  indicates the newly added oxidative phase of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway,
  which is active also during the day (HC condition) in Synechocystis 6803, in contrast
  to Synechococcus 7942. Transaldolase was omitted due to low flux, and phosphogluconolactonase
  was neglected for simplicity. White indicates the metabolites whose concentrations
  are available in the metabolome data set. The model includes the Calvin-Benson cycle,
  glycogen synthesis (sink from glucose-6-phosphate), photorespiratory pathways, glycolysis,
  the oxidative pentose pathway and sink reactions (representing the adjacent pathway
  and the calculation of biomass production). The reversibility of a particular reaction
  is indicated by two small arrows. Red squares indicate the major carbon reallocation
  nodes for changing CO2 levels. Purple indicates the involved enzymes: RuBisCO–ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
  carboxylase oxygenase, PGK–phosphoglycerate kinase, GAP–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, TPI–triose-phosphate isomerase, ALDO–aldolase, FBPase–fructose-1,6
  bisphosphatase, PFK–phosphofructokinase, TKT–transketolase, SBPase–sedoheptulose-1,7
  bisphosphatase, RPI –phosphopentose isomerase, PPE–phosphopentose epimerase, PRK
  –phosphoribulokinase, GPI–glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, G6PD–glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, PGD–phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, PGPase–phosphoglycolate phosphatase,
  PKET–phosphoketolase, GOX –glycolate oxidase, SGAT–serineglyoxylate transaminase,
  HPR –hydroxypyruvate reductase, GLYK –glycerate kinase, AGT–alanine-glyoxylate transaminase,
  TSS –tartronatesemialdehyde synthase, TSR–tartronatesemialdehyde reductase, SHMT–serine
  hydroxymethyltransferase, GLOX –glyoxylate oxidase, PSAT*–phosphoserine transaminase
  (3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase is, for simplicity, not implemented), PGM–phosphoglycerate
  mutase, ENO–enolase. Open book symbol indicates an involvement of metabolite in
  other reaction(s).'
