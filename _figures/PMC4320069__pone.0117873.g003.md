caption: A total of 78 unique genes contained or were located within 100 Kb of SNPs
  in high LD (r2>0.80). Gene-gene interactions were identified using the Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis software. The most significant functional network demonstrating
  connectivity between genes was identified as having a potential function in Cancer,
  Cellular Growth and Proliferation, and Organismal Injury and Abnormalities. Gene
  products shaded in gray represent genes originating from the gene list.
