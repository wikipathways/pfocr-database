caption: The metabolic pathway map of biosynthesis related to photosynthesis. The
  heat map was drawn based on the FPKM values of differential expression levels. Red/green
  represents up/down-regulated genes, and small red circles indicated the differentially
  accumulated metabolites. W represented normal plants, and Z represented EBF plants,
  the same as below. All data in the 3.6 to 3.9 showed a common trend of E and S.
