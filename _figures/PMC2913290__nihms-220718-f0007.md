caption: Control of 5′ UTR transcript translation depends on mTOR signaling. In prostate
  cancer cells, PD98059 seems to have little effect on translation and most likely
  is not acting through the phosphorylation of MNK1/2 via ERK1/2 otherwise an effect
  on translation of transcripts with complex 5′ UTRs would be observed. On the other
  hand, treatment with LY294002 blocks far upstream and causes the largest decrease
  on translation because all different arms of the pathway are inhibited. However,
  rapamycin targets further downstream at mTOR and while it decreases the phosphorylation
  of S6 and 4E-BP1, it has only an effect on the translation of transcripts with complex
  5′ UTRs, indicating that it acts primarily through 4E-BP1 in our cell system.
