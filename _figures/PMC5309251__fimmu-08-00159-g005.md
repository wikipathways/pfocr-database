caption: Non-canonical signaling pathway of Shh. By coupling of G protein-coupled
  receptors, Smo modulates the activation of RhoA/ROCK (MYPT1) signaling through increasing/decreasing
  MLCP level to enhance/weaken traction force, which results in promoting/reducing
  rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) migration. On the
  other side, Rac1 induces actin polymerization to promote RA-FLSs migration through
  its downstream protein such as WAVE/ARP2/3 complex. It is likely that Smo serves
  as a principal mediator of cytoskeletal tension in the process of cell migration.
