caption: Molecular mechanism of PGRN in osteoarthritis. (A) IRE1α overexpression or
  BMP2 treatment reduced the expression of Col II, Sox9, Col X, MMP-13, Runx2, IHH
  and increased the expression of PTHrP, while IRE1 α point mutant (IRE1α-PM) completely
  lost these regulatory activities of IRE1α. PGRN combines with the kinase domain
  of IRE1α during endoplasmic reticulum stress, assists in IRE1α phosphorylation,
  promotes XBP1u splicing to generate XBP1s, causes IRE1α to undergo nuclear translocation,
  and up regulates the expression of Col II. In addition, ERN1 was positively correlated
  with the level of PGRN. ERN1 deficiency reduced the protein levels of Col II, PGRN,
  XBP1s and IRE1α/p-IRE1α and increased the number of MMP-13 positive cells by reducing
  the expression of PGRN and XBP1 splicing, resulting in abnormal collagen structure,
  which accelerated cartilage degeneration and homeostasis imbalance in OA. (B) PGRN
  deletion significantly increased the expression levels of autophagy markers LC3-II,
  P62 and ATG5-ATG12 complex, but PGRN deletion did not affect the mRNA levels of
  LC3, p62 and ATG12. PGRN overexpression increased the level of autophagosome markers
  and lysosome number, but did not promote autophagosome formation and lysosome biogenesis.
  PGRN treatment reduced the expression of Col X and COMP, while PGRN and autophagy
  inhibitor CO treatment down regulated the autophagy marker ATG5, Expression of LC3II
  and ATG12. PGRN deficiency reduced the interaction between PGRN and PGRN-ATG5-ATG12,
  increased the expression of P62, Caspase-3 and Caspase-12 in chondrocytes, and decreased
  the proliferation, increased apoptosis and impaired autophagy activation of chondrocytes.
  (C) The expression of PGRN mRNA and the expression levels of no, COX-2, MMP13 and
  VCAM-1 in differentiated chondrocytes treated with TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TLR-4
  agonists were significantly increased, while rpgrn significantly inhibited the results
  induced by inflammatory factors. Under the stimulation of IL-1β or LPS, si-TNFR1
  inhibited the anti-inflammatory effect of PGRN. In PGRN deficient mice, the cartilage
  degeneration related factors ALP, BGP, MMP-13, ADAMTS-5, ADAMTS-7, ADAMTS-12, iNOS
  and COX-2 were significantly increased, and the degradation rate of COMP and Aggrecan
  was accelerated, which was reversed by rPGRN. In addition, in a TNFR2 dependent
  manner, PGRN, on the one hand, increased the levels of anabolic biomarkers Col II
  and Aggrecan by activating ERK1/2 signalling pathway, and restored the metabolic
  balance of chondrocytes. On the other hand, PGRN inhibited the expression levels
  of MMP13, ADAMTS-5, COX-2 and iNOS and the excessive degradation of Col II and Aggrecan
  by interacting with TNF-α, blocking the progress of OA. (D) PGRN enhanced the expression
  and activity of SIRT1 in a dose-dependent manner, prevented P65 nuclear translocation
  through p65 deacetylation, inhibited TNF-α induced p65 nuclear accumulation, significantly
  increased the expression and secretion of Col IIA1 and Aggrecan, and decreased the
  expression of total p65 and acetylated P65, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 in chondrocytes
  induced by TNF-α. The effect of PGRN was reversed by the CO treatment of rPGRN and
  si-SIRT1
