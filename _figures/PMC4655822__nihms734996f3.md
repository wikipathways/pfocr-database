caption: Endothelial cells are connected with each other through the tight junction
  (TJ), adherens junction (AJ) and gap junction (GJ) proteins. In the TJs, occludin,
  claudins and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) form a impermeable barrier to
  fluids and are connected to F-actin filaments by the zonula occludens ZO-1, ZO-2
  and ZO-3 multi-domain scaffolding proteins of the membrane-associated guanylate
  kinase family. GJs formed by connexin hemichannels are specialized for direct intercellular
  communications. AJs are formed by homotypic binding of VE-cadherin, platelet endothelial
  cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and Nectin. Catenins link VE-cadherin to F-actin,
  while nectin is secured to F-actin by afadin.Pericytes communicate with the endothelial
  cells via growth factor-mediated signaling (unidirectional or bidirectional), adhesion
  via N-cadherin homotypic binding and GJs. Pericyte can modulate BBB permeability
  by regulating gene expression in the endothelial cells resulting in upregulation
  of TJ proteins, inhibition of bulk flow transcytosis and upregulation of brain endothelial
  specific docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) transporter, a major facilitator domain-containing
  protein 2A (MFSD2a). Both endothelial cells and pericytes are embedded in the basement
  membrane (BM) and anchored to BM via integrins. PDGF-BB, platelet-derived growth
  factor BB; PDGFRβ, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β.Astrocytes regulate
  expression of matrix metallo-proteinase-9 (MMP-9) in pericytes by secreting apolipoprotein
  E (ApoE). ApoE3, but not ApoE4, binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 1 (LRP1) in peri-cytes, which suppresses the proinflammatory cyclophilin
  A (CypA)-nuclear factor-κB (NFκB)-MMP-9 pathway and degradation of TJ and BM proteins
  causing BBB breakdown. Astrocytes signal endothelial cells by Src-suppressed C-kinase
  substrate (SSeCKS) to increase TJ protein expression. Neural activity-dependent
  glutamate release increases [Ca2+] in the astrocytic endfeet, which regulates vascular
  tone. The GJs connect the adjacent astrocytic endfeet. Glucose gets into the brain
  via the endothelial Glut1 transporter and is taken up by neurons via Glut3. Glucose
  is taken up by astrocytes mainly by Glut2 and is metabolized to lactate, which is
  exported to neurons by the monocarboxylic MCT1 and MCT4 transporters.
