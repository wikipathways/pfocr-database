caption: 'A convergent model for the canonical (Wnt/β-catenin) and non-canonical (Wnt/Ca2+)
  Wnt signaling, in mammalian cell lines (only the cell membrane and the nucleus shown
  in the schematic for clarity). Proposed steps of Wnt signaling in mammalian cells
  are as follows: binding of Wnts (3A, 4, 5A, 7, 9B, and 10B) (1) results in the activation
  of intracellular calcium stores (2) that increase in the intracellular concentration
  of free store-operated calcium ((3) – and supplemental Movies). The increase in
  free calcium depolarizes the cell membrane (supplemental Movies) and as calcium
  enters the nucleus (4), the NE is depolarized ( and supplemental Movies); the calculated
  diffusion constants for the activation of bound to free intracellular calcium is
  0.21 μm/s, and time constants for steps 1 to 4 are likely to be in milliseconds.
  We have shown, previously, that activation of Wnt/Ca2+pathway by Wnt5A increases
  (5) Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CamKII) activity to induce cytoskeletal modulation
  in prostate cancer cells (). It is well established by previous studies (see Ref.  for
  a review) that activation of Wnt signaling (6) desequesters the caged β-catenin
  (β-cat) that is phosphorylated (P) and ubiquitinated (UUU) prior to degradation
  in proteasomes, gray square) in the cytosol. The desequestered β-catenin (7) translocation
  is facilitated across the NE (), which is now depolarized (8) and has increased
  nucleoplasmic calcium (9). β-Catenin is now co-localized in the nucleus ( and )
  where it is known to bind to LEF/TCF proteins to initiate gene transcription. For
  simplification, many other proteins involved in Wnt signaling are not shown and
  multiple other pathways such as Wnt/PCP pathways are not included in the illustration.
  The steps for which evidence is given in the manuscript are shown with arrows shaded
  purple. See supplemental Movie SM16 for an animated version of the proposed model.'
