caption: STAT3 activation pathway. STAT3 is activated through the interaction of cytokines
  and growth factors. Growth factors have intrinsic kinase activity, whereas the receptors
  of ligands have associated JAK that, when phosphorylated, acts as a platform for
  un-phosphorylated STAT3 to become activated. Phosphorylated STAT3 dimers (not shown
  in figure for simplicity) translocates to the nucleus where it up-regulates a variety
  of genes that can contribute to tumourigenesis. The STAT3 pathway is negatively
  regulated by a number of ways. SOCS3 inhibits the phosphorylation of JAK proteins
  and PIAS3 inhibits dimerisation of STAT3 monomers. Phosphorylated STAT3 dimers are
  not shown for simplicity.
