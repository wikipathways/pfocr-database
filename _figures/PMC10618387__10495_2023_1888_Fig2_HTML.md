caption: 'Pyroptosis has two main pathways: canonical pathway and non-canonical pathway.
  The canonical pathway is regulated by inflammasome assembly which is mainly activated
  by PAMPs and DAMPs. Active NLRP3 binds pro-caspase-1 via ACS to form the NLRP3-inflammasome,
  further hydrolyzing and activating pro-caspase-1. Caspase-1 of dimerization cleaves
  GSDMD and pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, forming an unselective pore on the cytomembrane,
  secreting IL-1β and IL-18 and influx of water, causing cell death. Non-canonical
  pathway initialed by caspase-4/5/11 which is activated by LPS. Active caspase-4/5/11
  activates caspase-1 and cleaves GSDMD directly, leading to pyrotosis'
