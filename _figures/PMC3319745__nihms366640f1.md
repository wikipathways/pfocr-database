caption: 'Insulin signaling. Insulin binds to its receptor causes a conformational
  change, autophosphorylation of the receptor, and activation of two pathways; The
  PI3K/Akt pathway leads to IRS tyrosine phosphorylation, which further phosphorylate
  PI3K subunit p85 and heterodimerization of p85 and p110. Akt activation upon the
  heterodimerization leads to PIP3 generation, which causes tyrosine phosphorylation/activation
  of PDK1; leading to serine phosphorylation/activation of Akt (also termed PKB).
  Activated Akt/PKB causes serine phosphorylation of eNOS/activation, rab-GTPase-activating
  protein-AS160, and HSL serine phosphorylation, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3,
  threonine phosphorylation of S6K, and induction in Bcl-x gene expression; leading
  to NO generation, GLUT4 membrane translocation/glucose uptake, anti-lipolysis, glycogen
  synthesis, protein synthesis, and reduced-apoptosis. Exercise or insulin sensitizer
  adiponectin activates AMPK, which causes serine phosphorylation of IRS (at amino
  acid position 789- a positive regulation), eNOS (a positive regulation), and rab-GTPase-activating
  protein-AS160 and threonine phosphorylation of TSC1/2 (a negative regulation); leading
  to PI3K/Akt activation, NO production, glucose uptake, and protein synthesis inhibition.
  The MAPK cascade leads to activation of Ras signaling, cell proliferation, and inhibits
  apoptosis. IRS: insulin receptor substrate, PIP2: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate,
  PIP3: phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, PDK1: phosphoinositide-dependent
