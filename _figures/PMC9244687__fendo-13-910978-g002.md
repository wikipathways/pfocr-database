caption: 'PRL can initiate multiple signaling cascades in established cancers, which
  can result in different biological outcomes. Determination of the repertoire of
  PRL signals can be modulated by multiple factors, including properties of the ECM.
  In ER+ cell lines, the stiffness and density of the extracellular matrix (ECM) strongly
  influences the balance of these signals: in stiff matrices, PRL signals are shifted
  away from the canonical JAK2/STAT5A pathway, and toward FAK/SFK/ERK1/2. This shift
  permits PRL to drive proliferation, invasion, and resistance to tamoxifen (OHT),
  and further remodel collagen fibers in the ECM. These experimental findings support
  the clinical observations that ER+ cancers with regions of aligned collagen perpendicular
  to the tumor boundary have a worse prognosis, and that activated STAT5A is strongly
  linked to more differentiated cancers and tamoxifen sensitivity. See Section 3.4
  for details.'
