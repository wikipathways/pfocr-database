caption: A. 10 most abundant proteins realted to the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8
  and associated molecular and cellular functions. The relationships between IL-8
  and the proteins detected in MEE samples are represented by lines and arrows as
  detailed in the legend. The functions assigned by IPA along with the number of molecules
  implicated and the p value are listed on top. (LYZ lysozyme; AZU1 azurocidin; PRTN3
  proteinase 3; CTSG Cathepsin G; CAMP cAMP receptor protein; MPO myeloperoxidase;
  LTF lactoferrin; MUC5AC mucin 5AC; MUC5B mucin 5B; MUC2B mucin 2B; ELANE neutrophil
  elastase; BPIFA1 BPI Fold Containing Family A, Member 1; ITGAM integrin alpha M;
  SERPINB1 leukocyte elastase inhibitor; S100A8/9 S100 calcium-binding protein A8/9;
  PIGR Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor; DMBT1 Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumors-1.
  B. Neutrophil proteins detected in the MEEs centered/focused on ELANE. Relationships
  between these and other non-neutrophilic proteins are represented by lines an arrows
  as detailed the legend.
