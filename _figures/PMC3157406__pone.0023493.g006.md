caption: Glu activates NMDAR, causing an increase in calcium into the cell. Under
  normal conditions, this leads to a phosphorylation and activation of ERK/MAPK and
  ultimately cell survival. Bcl2 protein levels are increased, partially explaining
  the failure to activate caspase 3 and undergo apoptosis in response to excitotoxin.
  When ERK/MAPK is inhibited with PD98059, this survival pathway is blocked. Caspase
  3 activity rises, and the cells undergo apoptosis. The cell signaling pathway connecting
  NMDAR activity and cell death under conditions of ERK/MAPK inhibition is unknown
  at present, but it is possible that activation of p38/MAPK as well as reduction
  in Bcl2 lead to caspase activity and cell death.
