caption: (A) An overview of the design to compare the roles of glucocorticoids in
  the hippocampus and hypothalamus in HPA axis hyperactivity and depressive-like behaviors.
  (B) A model describing the different roles of glucocorticoids in the hippocampus
  and hypothalamus in depression. The Acute stress stimulates glucocorticoids synthesis
  and releasing in adrenal cortex. Under acute stressful state, when glucocorticoids
  arriving in the hippocampus or hypothalamus, glucocorticoids exerts negative regulation
  of the synthesis of CRF in PVN neurons by GR. Under chronic stressful state, glucocorticoids
  in the hippocampus impair the negative feedback modulation of the synthesis of CRF
  in PVN neurons in the hypothalamus by disrupting hippocampal GR. However, glucocorticoids
  in the hypothalamus still exert negative regulation on the synthesis of CRF in PVN
  neurons. Glucocorticoids in the hippocampus disrupt GR function through MR-nNOS-NO
  pathway. (−) exerting negative regulation of HPA axis activity; (+) exerting positive
  regulation of HPA axis activity.
