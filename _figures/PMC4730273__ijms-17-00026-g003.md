caption: 'Schematic representation of the tryptophan (TRP) metabolic pathway. Most
  TRP is used as the precursor of kynurenine (KYN) pathway, in which TRP is firstly
  oxidized by TRP 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) to the
  kynurenine (KYN). There are at least three pathways for KYN metabolism. (1) KYN
  aminotransferase (KAT) pathway: KYN is catabolized by KAT to form KYN acid (KYNA),
  which antagonizes N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and α7 nicotinic receptors
  (α7nAChR); (2) kynurenine 3-monoxygenase (KMO) pathway: KYN is converted into 3-HK
  by KMO. 3-HK is converted into 3-HAA by KAT; (3) KYNase pathway: KYN is metabolized
  by KYNase to form anthranilic acid (AA), which is converted into 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid (3-HAA) by AA3MO. 3-HAA is oxidized by 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxidase (HAAO)
  to quinolinic acid (QUIN), which generates NAD+ through quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase
  (QPRT). Additionally, TRP is metabolized to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) through
  TRP hydroxylase (TPH) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Serotonin is synthesized from
  5-HTP via aromatic acid decarboxylase (AADC) and the vitamin B6. Serotonin is converted
  into 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) or 5-hydroxytryptophol (5-HTOL) by monoamine
  oxidase (MAO) or into N-acetylserotinin by N-acetyl-transferase (NAT). Melatonin
  is generated via the hydroxyl-indole O methyltransferase (HOMT).'
