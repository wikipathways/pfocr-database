caption: 'Polypeptides binding to their cognate receptors activates the tyrosine (Tyr)
  kinase (TK) activities of the receptors, JAKs, or Src. Latent STAT3 is recruited
  to the activated receptor for phosphorylation (site A) by TKs on critical Tyr residue,
  leading to STAT3:STAT3 dimerization (site B) and activation. STAT3 accumulates in
  the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA response elements (site C) in the promoters
  of target genes, leading to gene transcription. Currently identified STAT3 inhibitors
  can block STAT3 biological activity and function via interrogating at specific sites
  A, B, C, and D (shown in Figure 1 and ).DBDIs: DNA binding domain inhibitors; JAKs:
  Janus kinases; P: Phosphate; SDIs: SH2 domain inhibitors or dimerizaton inhibitors;
  Src: Src family kinases; STAT: Signal transducer and activator of transcription;
  TPIs: Tyr phosphorylation inhibitors.'
