caption: A generalised metabolic pathway of prenylated flavonoids from beer. Initial
  changes occur in the harsh environment of the gut, with additional metabolism by
  gut bacteria. Absorbed compounds that are changed in the gut (including xanthohumol)
  then make it to the liver, where active metabolism occurs.
