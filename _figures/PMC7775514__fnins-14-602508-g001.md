caption: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in Alzheimer disease (AD). Following
  ligand binding, TLR4 activates downstream signaling pathways through myeloid differentiation
  primary response protein 88 (Myd88)-dependent and -independent pathways, leading
  to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon-β (IFN-β) activation. TLR4 activation
  enhances amyloid-beta (Aβ) phagocytosis by microglia. Scavenger receptors (SRs),
  cluster of differentiation (CD)14, and murine formyl peptide receptor 2 (mFPR2)
  are involved in this process. The two different pathways involved in Aβ uptake by
  microglia are MyD88–p38–SR and the MyD88-independent Cdc42/Rac pathway. TLR4 activation
  reduces CD36 expression, thereby inhibiting CD36-mediated phagocytosis of Aβ. Triggering
  receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) negatively regulates TLR-induced inflammatory
  cytokine production. TREM2 regulates TLR4/phospholipase C γ2 (PLCγ2)-dependent inflammatory
  signaling. TREM2 interacts with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) to affect phagocytosis of
  apoptotic neurons. High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) interacts with Aβ and
  inhibits Aβ phagocytosis by microglia via TLR4 signaling. Straight and dotted arrows
  represent activation and inhibition, respectively.
