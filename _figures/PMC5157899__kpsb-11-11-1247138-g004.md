caption: PEP-mediated metabolism in thermogenic cells of S. renifolius. PEP yielded
  by glycolytic pathway is predominantly catabolized by PEPC to produce oxaloacetic
  acid (OAA). OAA is either directly oxidized in the mitochondria or converted to
  malate (Mal) by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (MDH). Malate is catabolized by the
  malic enzyme (ME) in mitochondria to produce pyruvate (Pyr) and carbon dioxide (CO2).
  Intra-mitochondrially produced pyruvate can either enter the TCA cycle or allosterically
  activate the alternative oxidase (AOX). The CO2 produced in the TCA cycle and by
  the malic enzyme is catabolized by complex I-integrated mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase
  to form bicarbonate (HCO3−) and is catabolized by PEPC to yield OAA. Expression
  of PEPC and AOX can enhance the recycling of respired CO2 and energy dissipative
  mitochondrial respiration. Major metabolic pathways predicted in the present study
  are depicted by red arrows. Complexes I–V of the electron transport chain are shown.
  UK5099, an inhibitor of the pyruvate transporter, is also depicted. PK, pyruvate
  kinase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK);
  PEP phosphatase (PEPtase); PPi, pyrophosphate; Suc, succinate; Cit, citrate.
