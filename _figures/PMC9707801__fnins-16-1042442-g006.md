caption: The Effects of Nicotine on insulin resistance and NAFLD. Mental health illnesses,
  including mood disorders, have high co-incidence rates with smoking. Nicotine, found
  in both cigarettes and electronic vapes, has been linked to increasing insulin resistance.
  When Nicotine binds to its receptor, it activates mTOR which then activates P70S6K
  which activates P-IRS-1, preventing Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS-1) from binding
  to the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptors. As a result, intracellular pathway
  PI3K will not be activated resulting in eventual insulin resistance. Due to such
  reactions in the Hypothalamus, there is a decrease in AMPK activity, increased thermogenesis
  and reduced appetite. In adipocytes, there is an increase in lipolysis, leading
  to increased levels of free fatty acids in the body. Figure created with BioRender.com.
