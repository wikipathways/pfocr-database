caption: Proposed model for illustrating the essential roles of DNA sensors in recognition
  and innate interferons (IFNs) production during ectromelia virus (ECTV) infection.
  Upon viral entry, some of ECTV virions are processed in the endosome, and viral
  DNA is firstly detected by Tlr9, which signals through the Myd88–Irf7 axis to promote
  expression of type I IFNs. Moreover, some of viral DNA is detected by the cytosolic
  DNA sensor cGas, and cGas catalyzes the formation of cGMP-AMP (cGAMP), which through
  the Sting–Tbk1–Irf3/7 axis leads to the activation of IFN responses. Other cytosolic
  DNA sensors, including Ifi204 and Ddx41, potentially recognize viral DNA present
  in the cytoplasm for the activation of IFN responses. DAI, one of the receptors
  upstream of Sting, has been ruled out as the critical DNA sensor for the activation
  of IFN responses during an ECTV infection.
