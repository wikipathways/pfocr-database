caption: 'Various signaling molecules, such as glucocorticoids, androgens, progesterone,
  BMP4 (which activates SMAD), and IL-6 (which activates the downstream signaling
  molecule STAT3), regulate the transcriptional activity of S100P in cancer cells.
  The S100P protein is expressed in an inactive state and is activated by calcium
  ions to form active homodimers. These homodimers then interact with target proteins
  such as ezrin, a multidomain protein involved in adhesion, cell differentiation,
  and migration. Additionally, the S100P dimer activates cytokeratins through phosphorylation
  while reducing actin levels, ultimately affecting cell motility in cancer cells.
  The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a member of the immunoglobulin
  superfamily, is present on the cell surface. S100P acts as a ligand that binds to
  RAGE, activating several signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK), and serine/threonine protein kinase pathways. Activation of these pathways
  leads to cell proliferation and survival. Another signal transduction pathway involves
  the interaction between CacyBP/SIP and S100P, which promotes the degradation of
  beta-catenin and regulates tumorigenesis in tumor cells. Moreover, the S100P homodimer
  upregulates the expression of cathepsin D, leading to the degradation of the extracellular
  matrix and promoting tumor invasiveness. A feedback loop exists in which high levels
  of S100P suppress endogenous S100P mRNA. The glucocorticoid-mediated S100P pathway
  plays a critical role in cancer therapies. During tumor progression, certain nonsteroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) also impact S100P expression. In pancreatic cells,
  5-methyl cromolyn, an S100P inhibitor, binds to the RAGE receptor and inhibits tumor
  metastasis and growth. Another therapeutic approach involves using a RAGE-antagonistic
  peptide that blocks the interaction between RAGE and S100P. Additionally, the invasion
  of S100P-positive cells is suppressed by protease inhibitors such as aprotinin or
  α-2-antiplasmin. S100P: S100 calcium-binding protein P'
