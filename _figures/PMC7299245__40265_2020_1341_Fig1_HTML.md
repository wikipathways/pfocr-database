caption: Targets of new therapeutic options in beta-thalassemia. a SMAD2/3 signaling
  pathway is the target of activin receptor ligand trap molecules. Members of the
  transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily ligands binding leads to the multimerization
  of type I and type II receptors. Upon the activation of the type I receptor, phosphorylation
  of SMAD2/SMAD3 takes place. This leads to dissociation from the type I receptor
  and oligomerization with SMAD4 to form a complex that translocates into the nucleus,
  thereby regulating the gene and promoting a cellular response with inhibition of
  late-stage erythropoiesis. Luspatercept and sotatercept prevent the binding of the
  ligand, thus inhibiting this pathway and promoting late-stage erythropoiesis. b
  JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway is the target of JAK2 inhibitors, e.g., ruxolitinib.
  In β-thalassemia, erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis is increased, leading to activation
  of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway, thus altering the proliferation and differentiation of
  the erythroid progenitors. c Regulation of hepcidin expression in hepatocytes is
  the target of mini-hepcidin and TMPRSS6 inhibitors. The binding of bone morphogenetic
  protein 6 (BMP6) and hemojuvelin (HJV) to the BMP6 receptor leads to a downstream
  signaling mechanism via SMAD1, SMAD5, or SMAD8, which activate SMAD4. SMAD4 will
  then stimulate the transcription and expression of hepcidin (encoded by HAMP). The
  SMAD signaling pathway is also regulated by other molecules like transferrin receptor
  2 (TFR2) upon its association with human hemochromatosis protein (HFE) and HJV.
  Transmembrane protease serine 6 (TMPRSS6) negatively modulates HAMP expression by
  cleaving HJV from the cell surface. The secretion of erythroferrone (ERFE) inhibits
  hepcidin expression, the signaling pathway of which is currently unknown. The administration
  of synthetic hepcidins and the inhibition of TMPRSS6, which ultimately increases
  hepcidin expression, result in ferroportin internalization and iron restriction.
  Ferroportin inhibitors (not shown) are another class of drugs that induce iron restriction
  (see Sect. )
