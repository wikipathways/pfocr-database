caption: a Under normal conditions, a low level of NFE2L2 is primarily maintained
  by KEAP1-mediated proteasomal degradation. b Following ferroptosis stress, the NFE2L2
  protein is stabilized and initiates a multi-step activation pathway, including nuclear
  translocation, heterodimerization with its partner MAF protein, recruitment of transcription
  coactivators and subsequent binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) of
  the target gene promoter. SQSTM1 can stabilize NFE2L2 by inactivating KEAP1 through
  autophagic degradation.
