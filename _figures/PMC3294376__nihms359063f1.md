caption: The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway provides the sugar substrate for O-GlcNAcylation.
  When glucose enters into the cell, a small percentage is funneled directly into
  the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, where it is converted into UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc). The enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) catalyzes the addition of the
  amino sugar to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, whereas the enzyme O-GlcNAcase
  catalyzes the removal of the sugar. Modified proteins are involved in multiple cellular
  processes, such as transcription and translation, nutrient sensing, neuronal function,
  cell cycle, and stress. Acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; Fru, fructose; GFAT, glucose:fructose
  6-phosphate amidotransferase; Glc, glucose; NAc, N-acetyl; O-GlcNAc, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine.
