caption: 'JAK/STAT signaling pathway: the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is initiated
  by the binding of ligands (cytokines, growth factors) to specific receptors, associated
  with JAK proteins, which become activated following conformational changes triggered
  by the ligand. Once activated, JAK phosphorylates a tyrosine residue on the receptor,
  creating attachment sites for STAT that interacts with the receptor and undergoes
  phosphorylation by JAK, leading to the activation and dimerization of STAT proteins.
  The dimer is translocated to the nucleus, where it functions as a transcription
  factor for various genes that promote cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor
  invasion, and metastasis. SOCs and SHP1/2 can block the cascade by competing with
  STAT proteins for their binding sites on the receptor or dephosphorylating JAK protein,
  respectively. JAK—Janus kinase; STAT—signal transducer and activator of transcription;
