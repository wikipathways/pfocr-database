caption: 'Model of the CWI signaling cascade. The CWI signaling pathway and its impact
  on Cryptococcus morphological changes are currently being studied. In C. neoformans,
  the cell membrane acts as a sensor for environmental stress stimuli, although the
  specific stimuli are still unknown. It is similar to Mid2. In the S. cerevisiae
  fungus, a transmembrane CWI pathway receptor called CNAG_03308 is present, but its
  function in the CWI pathway is yet to be discovered. In C. neoformans, there are
  three homologs (Rom20, Rom2, and Rom21) that may activate small GTPases Rho1, Rho10,
  and Rho11, which then stimulate Pkc1, controlled by Ppg1 and Lgr1. In addition to
  the GTPases, DAG can also activate Pkc1. Pkc1 plays a crucial role in maintaining
  the CWI pathway and inducing morphological changes in C. neoformans. Several studies
  have highlighted the central role of Pkc1 in determining cryptococcal morphology,
  which contributes to cell wall integrity and influences morphological changes in
  C. neoformans to the CWI pathway. In addition, Pkcl phosphorylates the C. neoformans
  transcription factor Sp1, which is important for regulating the expression of C.
  neoformans virulence factors. Downstream of the pathway are transcription factors
  that maintain the integrity of the cell wall, as shown in the figure. In C. neoformans,
  some components of the CWI pathway are involved in morphological changes in C. neoformans
  cells during interactions with the host: the formation of capsules (red signals)
  and Titan cells (green signals). Cck1 cytokines also regulate the expression of
  the HOG pathway and link the CWI pathway to other cell wall integrality-related
  pathways, contributing to the morphological change of C. neoformans'
