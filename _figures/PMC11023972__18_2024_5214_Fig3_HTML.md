caption: DDR components regulate cytosolic RNA sensors-dependent IFNs and NF-κB signaling
  pathways. The cytosolic RNA sensors (e.g., RIG-I and MDA5) signal to MAVS (also
  known as IPS-1, VISA, and Cardif) and induce IFN-I production or NF-κB activation
  through the TBK1-IRF3/7 signaling pathway. To date, The cellular innate immune responses
  also have been implicated under the control of DDR components via RNA sensors-dependent
  IFNs or NF-κB signaling pathways. For example, the RIG-I or RNA polymerase III responds
  to mtRNA or viral-derived 5′-pppRNA in the context of DNA damage
