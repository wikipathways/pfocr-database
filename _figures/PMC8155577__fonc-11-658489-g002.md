caption: Potential Mechanisms and Molecular Underpinnings of HML-2 Induced Oncogenesis/Tumour
  Promotion. HML-2 Gag and Env are known to be immunogenic and may contribute to chronic
  tumour-promoting inflammation. In addition, HML-2 ssRNA binds and activates Toll-like
  receptor 8 (TLR8), while HML-2 and other HERV-derived dsRNAs may activate Toll-like
  receptor 3 (TLR3) and the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5)/mitochondrial
  antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) pathway to elicit a type I IFN response and
  nuclear factor -κB (NF-κB) activation. Conversely, Env has been shown to possess
  an immunosuppressive domain and may inhibit peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
  activation via interleukin-10 (IL-10) to aid tumour immune escape. Rec inhibits
  the androgen receptor (AR) repressor proteins human small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide
  repeat (hSGT) and testicular zinc finger protein (TZFP), potentially forming a positive
  feedforward loop driving chronic HML-2 transcription and AR activation. Np9 has
  been shown to activate multiple oncogenic signalling pathways (including ERK, Akt,
  NOTCH and β-catenin), while both accessory proteins have been shown to induce c-Myc
  transcriptional derepression by inhibiting the promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger
  protein (PLZF). Np9 can also bind and inhibit the E3 ubiquitin ligase mouse double
  minute 2 homolog (MDM2), however, the impact of the resultant p53 stabilisation
  would likely depend on p53 mutational status. Finally, HML-2 insertions may regulate
  neighbouring gene expression by (1) recruiting histone methyltransferases (HMT)
  or histone acetyltransferases (HAT) to regulate chromatin accessibility, or (2)
  serve as alternative enhancer regions that drive adjacent gene transcription. Created
