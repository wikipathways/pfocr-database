caption: Type I/II cells. Binding of transmembrane CD95L to CD95 leads to DISC formation.
  DISC consists of FADD and procaspase-8. c-FLIP and PEA-15 bind to FADD and prevent
  caspase-8 recruitment. At the DISC level, aggregation of procaspase-8 promotes its
  auto-cleavage and activation. Cleaved caspase-8 is then released in the cytosol
  where it promotes the cascade of caspase activation leading to apoptosis. Type I
  cells are characterized by an efficient DISC formation, which releases sufficient
  caspase-8 to directly activate caspase-3. By contrast, type II cells present a weak
  DISC formation, and the low amount of released caspase-8 activates the mitochondrion-dependent
  apoptotic pathway to amplify death signal
