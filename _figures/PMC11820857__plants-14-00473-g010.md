caption: In darkness (A), CRY1 remains in its inactive form and is unable to suppress
  BR signaling because it does not interact with dephosphorylated BES1. SINATs undergo
  self-degradation, leading to a rise in the levels of dephosphorylated BES1, while
  phosphorylated BES1 (pBES1) is degraded via the COP1 pathway. As a result, the ratio
  of dephosphorylated BES1 to pBES1 increases. The active dephosphorylated BES1 then
  regulates gene expression to promote hypocotyl elongation. During this phase, UVR8
  predominantly resides in the cytoplasm, whereas BIM1 and functional BES1 are localized
  in the nucleus, where they facilitate the transcription of BR-induced genes to enhance
  hypocotyl growth. The meaning of ‘X’ is not to express it in this situation. In
  light conditions (B), CRY1 becomes activated and binds to dephosphorylated BES1,
  inhibiting its ability to bind DNA. The accumulation of SINATs promotes the degradation
  of BES1, resulting in a decrease in dephosphorylated BES1/BZR1 levels and reducing
  the ratio of dephosphorylated BES1/BZR1 to phosphorylated BES1/BZR1 (pBES1/pBZR1).
  This reduction in the ratio leads to the suppression of hypocotyl elongation. Under
  UV-B light, UVR8 accumulates in the nucleus, where it interacts with nuclear BIM1
  and dephosphorylated BES1, blocking their DNA-binding activity and thereby repressing
  the transcription of BR-responsive genes and hypocotyl elongation. The varying font
  sizes for BES1 indicate different levels of dephosphorylated and phosphorylated
  BES1

  description: In darkness (A), CRY1 remains in its inactive form and is unable to
    suppress BR signaling because it does not interact with dephosphorylated BES1.
    SINATs undergo self-degradation, leading to a rise in the levels of dephosphorylated
    BES1, while phosphorylated BES1 (pBES1) is degraded via the COP1 pathway. As a
    result, the ratio of dephosphorylated BES1 to pBES1 increases. The active dephosphorylated
    BES1 then regulates gene expression to promote hypocotyl elongation. During this
    phase, UVR8 predominantly resides in the cytoplasm, whereas BIM1 and functional
    BES1 are localized in the nucleus, where they facilitate the transcription of
    BR-induced genes to enhance hypocotyl growth. The meaning of ‘X’ is not to express

    of SINATs promotes the degradation of BES1, resulting in a decrease in dephosphorylated
    BES1/BZR1 levels and reducing the ratio of dephosphorylated BES1/BZR1 to phosphorylated
