caption: . Overview of the RNA interference pathways.The RNAi pathway can be divided
  into the siRNA and miRNA pathways. The RNAi pathway involves two phases. During
  the initiation phase the double stranded RNA molecules (ds RNA molecules or pre-miRNAs)
  are cleaved by the enzyme Dicer. During the execution phase the gene specific inactivation
  occurs by hybridization to and degradation of the target mRNA (siRNA) or by translation
  inhibition (miRNA). Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (e.g. RISC) are essential
  for this phase.
