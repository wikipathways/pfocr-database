caption: 'Schematic representation of various published mechanisms of resistance to
  FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 inhibitors. This figure shows a number of models of resistance
  including desensitization of drug targets by FLT3 gene amplification or protein
  overexpression, decreased drug binding affinity by mutation, deletion or insertion
  in TKD, increased drug efflux by p-gp, activation of survival and proliferative
  pathways (molecules) such as RAS pathway, STAT pathway, anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, Survivin
  and DNA repair molecule RAD51. FLT3: FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3; TKD: Tyrosine kinase
  domain; STAT: Signal transducer and activator of transcription.'
