caption: Mutations in PI3K, PTEN and AKT have dual effects on neuronal development
  leading to the formation of HMEG and FCD. First, PI3K and AKT mutations have effects
  on cell signalling that do not involve the downstream mTOR pathway but likely alter
  distinct cellular processes including growth, survival, metabolism, and motility
  (downstream targets). Second, mutations causing activation of PI3K and Akt, or inhibition
  of PTEN, inescapably lead to enhanced downstream mTOR signalling. The mTOR pathway
  has well-established links to cell growth, maintenance of cell size, motility and
  polarity via substrate phosphorylation and effects of protein translation. Combined
  effects of changes in upstream and downstream signalling likely cause altered expression
  of numerous neuronal genes and proteins, leading to enhanced excitability, loss
  of network regulation, and epileptogenesis.
