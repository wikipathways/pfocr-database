caption: Fermentative metabolism of glucose derived from intracellular, reduced sugars
  in Synechococcus 7002 based on the sequenced genome and the measured metabolite
  concentrations for WT and ldhA mutant cultures. Tables indicate excreted metabolite
  concentrations in the media after 4 days (mol/1017 cells). 1, enzymes of glycolysis
  or pentose phosphate pathway; 2, enzymes of the TCA cycle from malate dehydrogenase
  to succinate dehydrogenase; 3, d-lactate dehydrogenase (insertionally inactivated
  in ldhA mutant); 4, alanine dehydrogenase; 5, pyruvate:ferredoxin (flavodoxin) oxidoreductase;
  6, Fd:NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR); 7, hydrogenase; 8, acetate-CoA ligase.
