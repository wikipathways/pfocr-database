caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanism by which M1 sEVs enhance palatal
  suture expansion. M1 sEVs promote the early inflammatory state by increasing the
  content of RANKL and promoting the formation of osteoclasts, thus increasing the
  effect of bone turnover. They also promote the activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway in the palatal region by increasing the content of p65 protein
