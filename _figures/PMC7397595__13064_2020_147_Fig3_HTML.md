caption: BMP Canonical and Non-Canonical signaling at the NMJ. a BMP canonical signaling
  includes a paracrine, retrograde mechanism whereby muscle-derived Gbb is released
  across the synapse where it activates BMPRs Wit and Sax/Tkv triggering internalization.
  Internalized Gbb is trafficked to the neuronal nucleus where it activates phosphorylation
  of the Mad to pMad to activate transcription of Trio-GEF promoting overall NMJ growth.
  A second autocrine canonical pathway involves release of Cmpy bound Gbb from the
  neuron where it sequestered by α2δ-3, a calcium channel subunit. Neuronally derived
  Gbb then binds BMPRs and causes transcriptional changes similar to the paracrine
  canonical pathway to regulate synaptic homeostasis and signal transmission. b BMP
  non-canonical signaling pathways include those that are Gbb dependent and independent.
  Gbb dependent non-canonical signaling involves retrograde release of Gbb where it
  is bound by Wit. LIMK acts as a Wit effector to inhibit Cofilin which normally promotes
  actin dynamics through filament severing. In a Gbb independent non-canonical mechanism,
  GluRIIA containing iGluRs form a positive feedback loop with local presynaptic pMad.
  This mechanism depends on Wit and Sax/Tkv, but not on transcription and is inhibited
  by Dlp (Glypican)
