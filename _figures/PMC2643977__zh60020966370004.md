caption: Proposed integrated model for local water transport inhibition by activation
  of P2Y2 and adenosine A1 receptors (A1R) in inner medullary collecting duct principal
  cell. Activation of vasopressin V2 receptors (V2R) by arginine-vasopressin (AVP)
  stimulates aquaporin-2 (AQP2)-mediated water flux, which increases cell volume.
  The latter increases basolateral and apical release of ATP (and potentially UTP?)
  by unknown mechanism. Basolateral water exit is mediated by constitutively expressed
  aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and AVP-regulated aquaporin-3 (AQP3) water channels. Urea transporters
  UT-A1 and UT-A3 play key roles in the urinary concentrating mechanism and fluid
  homeostasis; both are regulated by AVP. P2Y2 receptor activation may inhibit water
  reabsorption by (I) stimulation of volume-regulatory K+ channels, and (II) inhibition
  of protein kinase A (PKA). ATP may also be broken down to adenosine (Ado). Alternative
  sources of extracellular Ado are the extracellular cAMP-Ado pathway (conversion
  by extracellular phosphodiesterase, ePDE, and ecto-5′-nucleotidase) or transport
  mediated by equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT). To which extent extracellular
  ATP is degraded by ectonucleotidases to ADP, AMP, and Ado at the luminal (not shown)
  and basolateral surface is unclear. Activation of A1R and P2Y2 receptors inhibits
  AVP-stimulated water flux, which helps to normalize cell volume and accelerates
  the excretion of free water in response to water loading before circulating AVP
  levels fall. AC, adenylyl cyclase; AQP-3, -4, aquaporin-3, -4; CNT, concentrative
  nucleoside transporter; COX-1, cyclooxygenase 1; DAG, diacylglycerol; P, phosphorylation.
