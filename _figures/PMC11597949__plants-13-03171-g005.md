caption: 'Based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (A) and Pearson correlation
  analysis (B), key structural genes and transcription factors involved in the accumulation
  of organic acids in peach fruit were identified. A model for the significant accumulation
  of organic acids in peach fruit from high-altitude peach-producing areas is proposed
  (C): the down-regulation of key genes in the synthesis pathway and the up-regulation
  of key genes in the degradation pathway of organic acids ultimately lead to the
  accumulation of organic acids in the fruit'
