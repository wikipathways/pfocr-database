caption: 'Genetics-based mechanism for co-occurring pathologies in thyrogastric and
  APS disease. Solute carriers (SLCs) in tissues of interest and regulation involving
  parietal cells (PCs) are shown: parathyroid gland (orange), melanocytes (green),
  thyroid gland (red), pancreas (yellow) and stomach (blue), which is composed of
  antrum (gastrin secretion) and fundus (PC and ECL) areas. The tissue-specifically
  expressed gene (ATP4A) is shown in red. More widely expressed SLCs (co-expression)
  with variants observed in patients of the studied series are shown in blue (SLC26A7,
  SLC26A9, SLC4A2, and SLC9A2/A4). The non-tissue-specific expression of SLCs correlates
  with a monogenic model for co-occurring pathologies, as a unique genetic variant
  would alter the function of different tissues simultaneously. However, co-occurrence
  may also be explained by a pathway alteration model. PCs (blue) export H+ and parathyroid
  hormone 1 like hormone (PTHLH) to produce gastric acid at the stomach lumen and
  regulate the Ca2+ absorption pathway, respectively. H+ secretion is positively regulated
  by gastrin. Somatostatin (SST) negatively regulates gastrin but is also involved
  in insulin secretion by the pancreas. Likewise, PTHLH secretion is regulated by
  PTH from the parathyroid gland. Thus, variants in the PTH/PTHLH pathway deregulate
  PC function but would also affect Ca2+ homeostasis associated with collagen diseases.'
