caption: Simplified scheme of allosteric regulation of the central metabolism and
  lysine synthesis pathways in C. glutamicum. Feedback inhibitions of PEPC by aspartate
  and malate and AK by threonine and lysine strictly control the metabolic flux to
  lysine synthesis pathway. Dotted arrows represent pathways consisting of several
  reactions. PC, pyruvate carboxylase, PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; AK,
  aspartokinase.
