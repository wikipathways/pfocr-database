caption: Cells pyroptosis mechanism. In the classical pathway, under the stimulation
  of bacteria, viruses and other signals, intracellular NLRs act as sensors to recognize
  these cognate ligand signals, and combine with the precursor of caspase1 through
  the adaptor protein ASC to form a multi-protein complex and activate caspase-1.
  Activated caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD to form a peptide segment containing the nitrogen-terminal
  active domain of GSDMD, which induces cell membrane perforation, cell rupture, release
  of contents, and inflammatory response. Moreover, activated caspase-1 also cleaves
  the precursors of IL-1β and IL-18 to form an active structure, which is released
  outside the cell, recruiting inflammatory cells to gather, expanding the inflammatory
  response and mediating cell pyroptosis. In the non-classical pathway, human caspase-4,5
  and mouse caspase-11 can be directly activated by contact with bacterial LPS, then
  cleave GSDMD, and indirectly activate caspase-1, causing pyroptosis.
