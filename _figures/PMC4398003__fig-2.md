caption: Signal transduction cascade inducing antimicrobial peptide expression after
  epidermal wounding, based on Engelmann and Pujol. For details, see section titled
  “.” Not shown are genes such as nipi-3 or hsp-3, which are preferentially involved
  in the response to fungal infection. Induction of caenacins, such as cnc-1 or cnc-5
  after wounding is partly dependent on the PMK-1 pathway. The role of TGFβ signaling
  in wound responses is not yet known. SNF-12 and STA-2/STAT may act downstream of
  the p38 MAPK cascade; NIPI-4 acts downstream of GPA-12 but has not been further
  positioned in the pathway. MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. To see this illustration
