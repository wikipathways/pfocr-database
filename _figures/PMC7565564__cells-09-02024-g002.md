caption: Examples of molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of uremic toxins
  on various cells, with focus on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling (AHR) pathway.
  Indolic uremic solutes and kynurenine, all tryptophan metabolites, are agonists
  of the AHR pathway. These solutes enter cells through the organic anion transport
  channel (OAT) in target cells. Upon binding to the cytosolic AHR protein, the ligand-bound
  AHR (represented as a red circle on AHR) elicits distinct signaling cascades in
  various cell types. In endothelial cells, AHR activation regulates cell permeability
  through Src and prothrombotic propensity through tissue factor (TF) activation or
  through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. AHR activation in
  vSMCs induces thrombosis through TF stabilization and by activating the NF-κB pathway.
  In macrophages, AHR induces a proinflammatory state by increasing reactive oxygen
  species, and through the NF-κB-MAPK signaling cascade.
