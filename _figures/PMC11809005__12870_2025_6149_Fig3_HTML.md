caption: 'Reconstruction of the ginsenoside biosynthesis pathway in PN flowers, with
  expression profiles of structural genes across the six developmental stages. The
  pathway integrates two upstream biosynthetic routes: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway
  and the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, which converge to produce
  precursors for ginsenoside biosynthesis. Specifically, the MVA pathway and MEP pathway
  produce isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP),
  which are converted into various terpenoid precursors. These precursors are utilized
  downstream for the biosynthesis of ginsenosides, which are categorized into three
  types: protopanaxadiol-type, protopanaxatriol-type, and oleanane-type. The downstream
  pathway shows critical branch points mediated by key enzymes, such as PPDS (protopanaxadiol
  synthase), CYP716A53 (cytochrome P450 enzymes), and GT (glycosyltransferases), which
  govern the production of different ginsenoside classes. Heatmaps display gene expression
  levels (log₂ TPM) at different stages, with colors ranging from blue (low expression)
  to red (high expression)'
