caption: 'Schematic figures showing various signaling molecules influenced by the
  CO-HO-1 pathway. Firstly, CO can activate PI3K-Akt-eNOS-NO signaling. CO/NO crosstalk
  can lead to vessel dilation, angiogenesis and neurogenesis. NO-mediated HO-1 induction
  can produce CO, forming a positive feedback loop. Akt also inactivates GSK3β and
  the TBC1D7/TSC1/TSC2 complex. Then, activation of mTOR through inhibition of Rheb
  results in protein translation, such as HIF-1α. HIF-1α-mediated VEGF production
  and secretion induce cell survival, angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Secondly, through
  phosphorylation of HIF-1α by p38 MAPK and ERK, CO may stabilize HIF-1α resulting
  in its nuclear translocation and upregulation of ERRα expression. Thirdly, the combination
  of CO and bilirubin among HO-1 metabolites may initiate Ca2+ entry, consequently
  stimulating CaMKKβ-mediated AMPKα activation. AMPKα activates SIRT1, leading to
  PGC-1α deacetylation and de-ubiquitination. Stabilized PGC-1α upregulates ERRα,
  which are critical for mitochondrial biogenesis. Abbreviations: CO, carbon monoxide;
  HO, heme oxygenase; NO, nitric oxide; eNOS, endothelial NO synthase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositide
  3-kinase; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; TSC1, hamartin; TSC2, tuberin; TBC1D7,
  tuberin Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 domain family member 7; HIF-1α, Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular-signal-related kinase;
  AMPKα, adenosine monophosphate kinase α; ERRα, estrogen-related receptor α; CaMKKβ,
  Ca2+-calmodulin kinase kinase β; SIRT1, sirtuin 1; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ-coactivator-1α.'
