caption: TGF-β classical signaling pathway. Activated TGF-β1 combines with TGFBR1
  and TGFBR2 to form a complex. TGFBR2 phosphorylates and activates TGFBR1. The activated
  TGFBR1 binds to SMAD2 and SMAD3 and phosphorylates them. Phosphorylated SMAD2 and
  SMAD3 combine with SMAD4 to form a trimer complex. The complex is transported to
  the nucleus and jointly regulates the expression of specific genes with other transcription
  factors, co-activators, and co-inhibitors
