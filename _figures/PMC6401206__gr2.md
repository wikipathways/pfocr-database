caption: 'Striatal Neurochemistry and Neurotransmission. (A) The role of cholinergic
  interneurons in mediating extrapyramidal side effects . (i) In wild-type mice, D2Rs
  mediate inhibitory actions both by directly reducing firing of the indirect pathway
  MSN, and by reducing firing of cholinergic interneurons. (ii) In knockout mice without
  D2Rs on cholinergic interneurons, D2 antagonism of the MSN by itself is insufficient
  to induce catalepsy. (iii) Activating, in addition, M1Rs, results in catalepsy,
  which occurs due to increased firing of the cholinergic interneuron secondary to
  D2 antagonism. (B) The relationship between striatal dopamine, lateral inhibition,
  and behavioural selection . The figure illustrates three scenarios, based on a hypothetical
  pair of functional units (A and B) each controlling a specific behavioural outcome
  (behaviour A and B, respectively). (i) Localized dopaminergic signalling in functional
  unit A activates D1 direct pathway MSNs, while suppressing D2 indirect pathway MSNs,
  enabling the execution of desired behaviour A. GABAergic lateral inhibition suppresses
  competing behaviour coded for by functional unit B. (ii) Spatially disorganised
  dopaminergic signalling means that there is nonspecific activation of multiple functional
  units, and undesirable behaviours are no longer suppressed. (iii) Dopamine antagonists
  enhances the activity of indirect pathway neurons, but without regional specificity,
  meaning that desirable behaviours are also suppressed. Abbreviations: Ach, acetylcholine;
  DA, dopamine; D2R, dopamine D2 receptor; M1R, M1 muscarinic receptor; MSN, medium
  spiny neuron.'
