  and EMT of OSCCTGF-β1 is probably a novel enhancer or inducer of SMAD4 SUMOylation
  and forms a passive feedback loop in the TGF-β1/SMAD signaling pathway and subsequently
  accelerates the proliferation and migration of OSCC cells in vivo and in vitro.
  However, GA treatment significantly attenuated TGF-β1-induced SMAD4 SUMOylation.
  Meanwhile, GA released SMAD4, which associates with SMAD2/3 to form a heterooligomeric
  complex that is then translocated to the nucleus where it activates the transcription
  of various target genes to reduce proliferation and migration of OSCC cells.
