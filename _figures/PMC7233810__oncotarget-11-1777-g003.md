caption: 'Eleven separate primary tumors from eleven A-I Tg+/– or A-I KO mice were
  subjected to differential gene expression analysis. Probes were considered significant
  if they met the criteria FDR adjusted p < 0.05 and fold-change (FC) cut off > 1.2.
  The complete list of significant genes is shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.
  The transcripts for PHGDH and PSAT1 were down regulated (FDR adjusted p-value 0.027
  and 0.104, respectively) by at least 1.2-fold in day 7 B16F10L tumor homograft from
  A-I Tg+/– relative to A-I KO mice. 3PG: 3-Phosphoglycerate; PHGDH: 3-Phospho-glycerate
  dehydrogenase; P-PYR: 3-Phospho-hydroxypyruvate; Gln: Glutamine; Glu: Glutamate;
