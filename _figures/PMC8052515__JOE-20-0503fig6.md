caption: Asprosin modulates browning and adipogenesis in white adipose tissue through
  Nrf2-mediated mechanism. Asprosin expression was downregulated during white adipose
  browning. However, overexpression of asprosin in white adipose tissue inhibited
  its browning, reduced the body’s thermogenesis, increased fat synthesis, and aggravated
  the lipid deposition in adipocytes by inhibiting the Nrf2 pathway. A full color
  version of this figure is available at https://doi.org/10.1530/JOE-20-0503.
