caption: The roles of HP1 for BRCA1 function and the choice between HR and NHEJ repair.
  HP1 is a chromatin-associated protein, but the distribution of HP1 on chromatin
  is not even. Irradiation partially removes HP1 from chromatin, but the remaining
  HP1 molecules have active roles in recruiting BRCA1 to the damaged DNA sites. HP1
  facilitates BRCA1 recruitment to chromatin after DNA damage, thereby activating
  G2/M cell cycle arrest and error-free HR repair. However, if the chromatin is HP1-
  or BRCA1-deficient, 53BP1 should be recruited resulting in error-prone NHEJ repair
  of the DNA damage. The loss of both the G2/M checkpoint control and HR repair pathway
  may increase the likelihood of apoptosis.
