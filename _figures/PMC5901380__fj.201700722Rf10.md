caption: Model for TAZ involvement in CKD progression. Increased TGF-β1 expression
  in response to renal injury (e.g., UUO or AA) serves as an upstream regulator of
  renal TAZ activation. Elevated epithelial TAZ expression promotes fibrotic factor
  induction/secretion (e.g., CTGF, fibronectin), epithelial plasticity and growth
  inhibition via SMAD3-dependent CTGF up-regulation. CTGF secretion downstream of
  TAZ induction contributes to renal epithelial cell–cell crosstalk via nonautocrine
  mechanisms. TAZ is also necessary for TGF-β1-mediated induction of profibrotic genes,
  suggesting multiple modes of TAZ involvement in maladaptive repair pathways linked
  to CKD progression.
