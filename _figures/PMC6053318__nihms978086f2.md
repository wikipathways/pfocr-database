caption: 'The figure is based on data from [,,,]. The serine–threonine kinase mTOR
  plays a key role in, among others, the regulation of cell proliferation, cell metabolism
  (including glycolysis) and protein synthesis. It forms two complexes: mTORC1 and
  mTORC2. Sirolimus and everolimus bind to FKBP12 [] and then this complex inhibits
  activation of mTORC1 by dissociating Raptor from mTORC1. mTORC2 is not inhibited
  directly by the sirolimus/FKBP-12 complex. Nevertheless, but prolonged sirolimus
  treatment may reduce mTORC2 activity. However, as shown in [], everolimus is markedly
  more potent than sirolimus in inhibiting mTORC2 formation. Everolimus effectively
  targets mTORC2-dependent signaling and ERK1/2 activation, an effect that sirolimus
  is lacking. ERK1 and ERK2 are serine/threonine kinases that are involved in cell
  proliferation, differentiation, survival and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.
  A functional link between ERK and mTORC2 has been shown. Thus inhibition of ERK
  by everolimus may occur via mTORC2 []. Arrows and bars represent activation and
  inhibition, respectively. Please note that the mTOR pathway is greatly simplified.
  For more details and explanation of the acronyms, please see []. Abbreviations:
