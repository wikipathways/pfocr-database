caption: Overview of leukocyte-intrinsic Hippo pathway functions. Hippo pathway components
  are involved in regulating leukocyte activity, namely T lymphocytes. MST1 is also
  involved in both canonical and non-canonical signaling involved in T lymphocyte
  proliferation and survival. (1) MST1 plays a crucial role in regulating the cytoarchitecture
  of T lymphocytes to facilitate polarization, formation of the leading edge, adhesion
  and migration. This function is thought to be dependent upon the regulation of the
  integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). Direct and indirect interactions
  between MST1 and other proteins, including endosomal adaptor protein Rab13, cytoskeletal
  regulatory protein Kindlin-3, a number of RhoA GTPases (RAP-RAPL complex, Rac1),
  L-plastin (LPL) and myosin IIa all lead to proper LFA-1 activation, spatiotemporal
  distribution and appropriate low/high affinity partitioning on T lymphocyte membrane.
  These interactions allow for T lymphocyte migration, survival and adhesion, as well
  as enable correct thymic egress and secondary lymphoid organ infiltration. (2) MST1/2
  signaling is also involved in CD4+ T lymphocyte Th17 differentiation, through interactions
  with FOXO1/3 and upregulation of FoxP3 transcriptional activity. (3) Hippo signaling
  is also involved in regulating clonal expansion of CD8+ T lymphocytes vs. terminal
  differentiation, through transcriptional regulation of Blimp1. (4) Hippo signaling
  through LATS1 or MST/FOXO interactions is implicated in apoptotic control, homeostatic
  maintenance of T lymphocytes and control of oxidative stress. Solid lines represent
  direct interactions. Dotted lines represent mechanisms that are indirect or that
  have not been fully delineated.
