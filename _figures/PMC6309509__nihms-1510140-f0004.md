caption: NAD+ biosynthesis via the salvage pathway, circadian regulation, and P7C3-mediated
  NAMPT enhancement. NAMPT (green) catalyzes the conversion of nicotinamide to NMN,
  which is then converted to NAD+ (dark blue) through the activity of NMNATs (yellow).
  NAD+ is a critical cosubstrate for the downstream enzymatic activity of PARPs, SIRTs,
  and cADPR synthases, which have extensive influence on cellular function, viability,
  and organism homeostasis. The circadian clock and NAD+-dependent SIRT1 (purple)
  regulate the transcription of NAMPT (right inset). Oscillations in NAMPT levels
  rely on SIRT1 transcription, maintaining a positive feedback cycle between NAMPT,
  NAD+, and SIRT1. P7C3 compounds (red triangle) bind to and enhance the activity
  of neuronal NAMPT thereby increasing cellular NAD+ levels. NAD+-mediated neuroprotection
  implicates SIRT1 signaling cascades, critical prosurvival pathways governing a multitude
  of cellular processes associated with viability, repair, inflammation, and neurogenesis.
