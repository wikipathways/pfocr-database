caption: This schematic demonstrates some of the major steps associated with the canonical
  NF-κB signaling pathway under both unstimulated and stimulated conditions. The canonical
  pathway is triggered by a variety of stimuli that activate diverse receptors, such
  pattern recognition receptors, TNF receptors, and proinflammatory cytokine receptors.
  In this representative image, the TNF receptor is shown. When unstimulated, the
  IKK complex composed of NEMO (IKKγ), IKKβ, and IKKα, along with the heterodimer
  composed of NF-κB proteins RelA and p50 are inactive and located in the cytoplasm.
  The binding of a ligand to the cell surface receptor, such as TNF binding to TNF
  receptor, leads to the recruitment of adaptor proteins, such as TRAF2 or TRAF5 and
  TAK1. This upstream activity leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the
  regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, NEMO, which in turn leads to the phosphorylation
  of the catalytic subunit of the IKK complex, IKKβ. IKKβ then mediates the phosphorylation
  and induction of proteosomal degradation of IκBα, which then allows for nuclear
  localization of the heterodimer RelA/p50. Nuclear localization leads to the transcription
  of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6.
