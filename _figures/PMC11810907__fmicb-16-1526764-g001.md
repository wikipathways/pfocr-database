caption: Potential mechanisms underlying the impact of gut dysbiosis on skeletal muscle
  mass and function in the development of sarcopenia. Gut dysbiosis, characterized
  by an imbalance in the gut microbiota, disrupts the gut barrier and impairs the
  production of microbiota-derived bile acids and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).
  In gut dysbiosis, the decrease or absence of bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-harboring
  bacteria diminishes the production of secondary deconjugated bile acids, leading
  to the accumulation of the primary bile acid tauro-β-muricholic acid (TβMCA). TβMCA
  is known to act as an antagonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and its increase
  during gut dysbiosis inhibits the FXR–fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15/19 signaling
  pathway. This inhibition results in reduced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated
  protein kinase (ERK) 1/2 and its downstream target p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK/P90),
  along with decreased activity of ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6). Consequently, the
  downregulation of ERK signaling cascades impairs the muscle synthetic response due
  to decreased levels of FGF15/19, leading to a decrease in skeletal muscle mass and
  muscle atrophy. Through these major gut microbiota-derived metabolites and related
  signaling pathways, such as the bile acid–FXR–FGF15/19 signaling pathways, gut dysbiosis
  may lead to decreased muscle growth, mass, and strength, thereby contributing to
  the development of sarcopenia. AA, amino acid; AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated
