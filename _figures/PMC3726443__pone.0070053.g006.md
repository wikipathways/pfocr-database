caption: A close examination revealed that in our validated dataset genes that modulate
  Wnt-signaling are overrepresented. Interestingly, genes that are solely expressed
  in the dorsal side act usually as transcriptional repressors, while those genes
  that are also expressed in the ventrolateral mesodermal domains interact with the
  Wnt signaling pathway post-translationally. (Although foxa3 and mst1 both show circumferential
  expression, the dorsal expression domain is much more prominent for both genes,
  therefore we treated them as intermediates.) The most likely reason for this difference
  is that while dorsally Wnt-signaling has to be completely abolished to avoid its
  later ventralizing effects, in other domains the role of feedback repressors is
  just to ensure that Wnt-signaling is not overactivated. The majority of the Wnt-modulators
  carries “bivalent” H3K4/H3K27 histone trimethylation marks, suggesting they are
  in a “poised” status during MBT, which could also enhance the tight temporal and
  spatial control of the pathway. (In the case of zic2.1 the “bivalent” status could
  be detected only prior MBT, and not during MBT, indicated by the lighter orange
  color.).
