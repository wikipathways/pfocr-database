caption: Optogenetic control of phosphatidylinositol signaling. In the CLICR strategy,
  endogenous receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were put under BL control via AtCRY2-mediated
  clustering, and the PI3K/Akt signal pathway could be optogenetically manipulated.
  Once activated by the RTK, the PI3K kinase phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI)
  to produce the phosphoinositides PIP2 and PIP3. In turn, the Akt kinase binds to
  PIP3, is thereby activated and elicits downstream responses. Optogenetic intervention
  in the pathway was also accomplished at the level of PI3K via AtCRY2:AtCIB1-mediated
  membrane recruitment and concomitant activation., Likewise, the Akt kinase could
  be directly controlled by translocating it to the membrane upon BL exposure, again
  using the AtCRY2:AtCIB1 system.–
