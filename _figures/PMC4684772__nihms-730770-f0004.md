caption: (A) Direct and indirect interactions of palbociclib and ribociclib are represented
  by black and grey edges, respectively. Protein kinases are shown as red, lipid kinases
  as orange and other proteins as grey nodes. Known protein complexes are highlighted
  by red circles. Beige outlines denote proteins as part of a specific indicated pathway.
  (B) Representative pSer473 AKT and pGSK3 Western blots of H157 and H520 cells treated
  for 4 hours with indicated concentrations of palbociclib, ribociclib (in µM), BKM120
  (2 µM) or CAL101 (5 µM). (C) Representative LC3 Western blots of H157 and H520 cells
  treated for 48 hours with indicated concentrations of palbociclib, ribociclib (in
  µM) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, 25 µM). Palbociclib and ribociclib concentrations
  in combination with hydroxychloroquine were 5 µM each. (D) Quantitative analysis
  of autophagic vesicles by Cyto-ID upon 3 hour treatment with the indicated concentrations
  (in µM) of palbociclib, ribociclib, HCQ (25 µM) and the mTOR inhibitor and autophagy
  inducer AZD8055 (4 µM). Values are normalized to DMSO and plotted as differences
  to DMSO.
