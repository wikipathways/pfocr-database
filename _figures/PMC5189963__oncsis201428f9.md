caption: A proposed model for the coordinated regulation of MMP-3 transcription by
  IKKɛ. A diagrammatic representation is shown based on our and other data for potential
  mechanisms of action of IKKɛ in transcriptional regulation of MMP-3. PMA-mediated
  activation of PKCα results in the formation of a protein complex that recruits IKKɛ
  to the plasma membrane where it can be further activated and directly phosphorylate
  Akt. PI3K activity is required for the recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane
  and this may be provided by the presence of IGF-IR. Phospho-Akt can activate the
  canonical IKK pathway, resulting in nuclear translocation of the p65 transcription
  factor. The requirement for ERK pathway activation in MMP-3 induction by PMA may
  indicate that it () acts together with p65 to enhance signaling and/or () it is
  required for Akt-mediated activation of p65, as was also shown with the p38 MAPK.
