caption: Regulatory networks governing biofilm formation. Schematic of the complex
  regulatory pathways that control gene transcription during (A) planktonic growth
  and (B) growth as a biofilm. Rounded rectangles indicate proteins, triangles indicate
  open reading frames (ORFs), arrows indicate activation, T-bars indicate repression.
  Dashed arrows or T-bars indicate indirect activation and repression respectively.
  Green represents active gene transcription with a green arrow indicating translation,
  dark blue represents absence of gene transcription, red indicates a transcriptional
  repressor and orange indicates a protein–protein interaction. Light blue indicates
  a protein that is able to bind to DNA to activate transcription. Pink structure
  represents a flagellum, with the curved arrow indicating rotation and the cross
  indicating inhibition of flagellar rotation. Vertical rectangles labelled with “signal
  input” indicate sensor kinases for the Spo0A pathway, for more details see Vlamakis
  et al. (). Faded shading indicates parts of the pathway that are inactive.
