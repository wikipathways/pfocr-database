caption: WNT signalling pathways. (A) The best known WNT pathway is the WNT/β‐catenin
  pathway. During the OFF state, the destruction complex consisting of Axin, APC and
  GSK‐3β phosphorylates β‐catenin and marks it for subsequent degradation via the
  ubiquitin proteasome pathway. WNTs activate the pathway via FZD and LDL receptor‐related
  protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) receptors. This leads to phosphorylation of LRP5/6 initiating
  the recruitment of the destruction complex and stopping its function. As a consequence,
  β‐catenin accumulates and triggers transcription via T‐cell factor/lymphoid enhancer‐binding
  factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors. (B) WNTs can also activate pathways independent
  of β‐catenin. (1) The best known is the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway.
  Activation of the vertebrate PCP pathway is triggered by WNTs (typically Wnt5a or
  Wnt11) that interact with FZD and coreceptors (ROR1, ROR2, PTK7 or RYK) and via
  Dishvelled (DVL) and β‐arrestin to activate members of the Rho family of small GTPases.
  Coordinated activation of downstream effectors – JNK and ROCK – induces cytoskeletal
  rearrangements that in turn influence processes ranging from convergent extension
  movements to positioning of basal bodies or cilia. (2) WNTs were shown to induce
  the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores that can activate a multitude of Ca2+‐dependent
  effectors to modulate both transcription as well as actin cytoskeleton. This schematic
  overview does not cover all different pathways activated by WNTs. The figure was
  created by Jakub Harnoš and Igor Červenka.
