caption: Model of S. mutans XIP pheromone signaling pathway in peptide-free chemically
  defined medium. The model is based on the UA159 S. mutans strain. The S. mutans
  XIP pheromone is exported outside of the cells. Upon reaching a certain threshold,
  XIP is internalized via the Opp permease, and binds to the ComR regulator to activate
  comS, thus creating a positive feedback loop. ComS is the precursor of XIP but can
  also function in its unprocessed form as an internal signal to activate the ComR-pheromone
  signaling pathway. The ComR-pheromone complex activates sigX. This codes for the
  alternative sigma factor X (σX). σX is the master regulator of competence for natural
  transformation that regulates the expression of the streptococcal core set of genes
  involved in the competence response, most of them with functions that enable DNA
  acquisition and integration into its genome. σX induces also comR () and comED (;
  ; ). ComED is a two-component system comprising the histidine kinase ComD and the
  cognate response regulator ComE. ComD autophosphorylates upon CSP pheromone binding
  and transfers the phosphoryl group to ComE, which in turn induces the expression
  of bacteriocin and immunity proteins, including the gene for the non-lantibiotic
  bacteriocin cipB. In rich media, cipB expression is required for induction of sigX
  by an as yet unknown mechanism. In CDM, CSP induces the ComED pathway, but it is
  unknown whether the CSP pheromone system is endogenously activated. It is also unknown
  why in CDM cipB is stimulated by CSP, but not the competence response. The conservation
  of the CSP and XIP signaling pathways in CDM were examined in this study using sigX
  and cipB luciferase reporter bioassays.
