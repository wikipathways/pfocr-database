caption: ABA and nitrate regulate SCARECROW (SCR) gene expression in the Arabidopsis
  root tip. (A) Exogenous ABA (10 μM) or KNO3 (10 mM) treatments reduce expression
  of the proSCR-erGFP reporter gene (indicated by green arrowheads), as compared with
  a control treatment of 10 mM KCl. Treatment with ABA and nitrate simultaneously
  result in a strong reduction of proSCR-erGFP expression and an increase in root
  hair growth close to the root tip. Roots are counterstained with propidium iodide
  (red). Confocal images from www.plantcell.org. Copyright American Society of Plant
  Biologists. (B) Diagram of the regulatory network involving ABA, NO3¯, SCR and root
  growth. Nitrate stimulates expression of the BG1 β-glucosidase, thus resulting in
  the release of bioactive ABA from the inactive ABA-glucose ester (ABA-GE) conjugate,
  and the repression of proSCR-erGFP. Because the effects of ABA and nitrate on proSCR-erGFP
  expression are additive, it may be that they function in parallel to regulate SCR
  expression, with NO3¯, regulating SCR expression separate from its action on BG1
  and ABA accumulation. This second pathway is indicated with a dashed line, to indicate
  the lack of direct evidence to support it.
