caption: 'Possible mechanisms for the hypoglycemic effects of LBPs.Notes: LBPs significantly
  promote glucose uptake involving several signaling pathways in the liver and muscle.
  LBPs increase the content of GLUT4 and promote the translocation of GLUT4 from cytosol
  to cell membrane, enhancing glucose uptake in Wistar rats muscle. LBPs also increase
  the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 and repress the activation of JNK, promoting
  insulin-signaling pathway and insulin-dependent glucose uptake in C57BL/6J mice
  liver. Furthermore, LBPs activate PI3K- and p38MAPK-mediated signaling pathway,
  improving insulin sensitivity in rats. Moreover, consumption of GoChi, a standardized
  Goji juice containing 13.6 mg/mL LBPs promotes caloric expenditure and reduces waist
  circumference in healthy subjects.Abbreviations: LBPs, Lycium barbarum polysaccharides;
  JNK, Jun N-terminal kinases; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; p38 MAPK, p38 mitogen activated protein kinase; GLUT4,
  glucose transporter type-4; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1;
  SOD, superoxide dismutase; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β.'
