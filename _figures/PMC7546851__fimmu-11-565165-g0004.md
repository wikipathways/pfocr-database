caption: The role of neutrophils in pre-metastatic niche. Primary tumor cells secret
  various cytokines, chemokines, and signals to recruit neutrophils to distant organs
  to form pre-metastatic niche. For example, tumor cell secreted-IL-8, MCP-1, GROα,
  GROβ, and G-CSF can mobilize neutrophils to the pre-metastatic niche, which then
  facilitate colonization of tumor cells and subsequent metastasis; GM-CSF produced
  by tumor cells can induce transferrin synthesis in neutrophils through the Jak/Stat5β
  pathway; TIMP-1 increases SDF1 levels, which in turn promote recruitment of neutrophils
  to the liver to promote liver metastasis; tumor exosomal RNAs activate TLR3 to induce
  chemokines that are critical for neutrophil recruitment and lung pre-metastatic
  niche formation. At pre-metastatic niche, activated neutrophils produce IL-1β, TNF-α,
  IL-6, and Cox-2, and degranulate azurophilic granules to release elastase and cathepsin
  G, leading to degradation of the Tsp-1 and enhanced metastasis. In addition, neutrophils
  support metastatic lung colonization via ALOX5-dependent leukotriene (LT) synthesis/release.
