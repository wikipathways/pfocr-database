caption: The classic pathway involves generation of NO through L-arginine. In the
  presence of molecular oxygen and several cofactors, nitric oxide synthases (NOS)
  catalyze the oxidation of the amino acid L-arginine to NO. NO is oxidized to nitrite
  (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) (dashed arrows). The alternative pathway involves generation
  of NO through reduction of nitrate and nitrite. Endogenously generated nitrate and
  nitrate from the diet can be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. Nitrite is absorbed
  systemically, and via several enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways reduced to NO.
