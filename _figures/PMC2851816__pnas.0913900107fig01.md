caption: Model for dCK function in the context of cytosolic deoxycytidine metabolism.
  The two biochemical pathways (salvage and de novo) involved in deoxycytidine metabolism
  converge at the level of dCDP. The flux through the salvage pathway is bidirectional
  because of a substrate cycle in which deoxycytidine (dC) is continuously converted
  to (by dCK) and from (by NT) its corresponding monophosphate (dCMP). The rates of
  the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions are regulated by feedback mechanisms
  and by substrate availability. Upstream of dCK, cellular and extracellular dC pools
  are in equilibrium via the nucleoside transporters (ENTs). Downstream of dCK, the
  dCMP pool is in equilibrium with the dCDP pool. The de novo pathway contributes
  to the dCDP pool by RNR-mediated reduction of CDP. ENT, equilibrative nucleoside
  transporters; NT, 5′ nucleotidase; dCDP, deoxycytidine diphosphate; CDP, cytidine
  diphosphate; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase.
