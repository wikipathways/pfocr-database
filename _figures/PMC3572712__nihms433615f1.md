caption: Arachidonic acid, a constituent of cell membrane lipid domains is released
  by phospholipases, especially a cytosolic phospholipase (PL)A2, mobilized by physical
  and chemical stimuli, and is subject to metabolism by prostaglandin (PG) G/H synthases
  to form sequentially PG endoperoxides, PGG2 and PGH2. The latter is then subject
  to further metabolism by synthases and isomerases to form thromboxane (Tx)A2 and
  PGs, each of which activates G protein coupled receptors termed T,E,D, I of F prostanoid
  (P) receptors. Cells typically make one or two dominant PGs. Besides DP1, PGD2 also
  activates at low concentrations a member of the fMPL receptor superfamily, termed
  CRTH2 or colloquially, DP2. VSMCs denotes vascular smooth muscle cells. Reproduced
