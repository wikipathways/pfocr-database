caption: Critical roles of dendritic cells in immunity against Leishmania parasites.
  1) Leishmania promastigotes are injected into the host via needle injection or sand
  fly injection. 2) DCs interact with Leishmania parasites through TLR-2/4/9, Fc receptors
  and C-type lectin receptors. 3) Activation of DCs is indicated by the elevated expression
  of MHC-II/CD40/CD80/CD86. Leishmania infections also causes expression of co-inhibitory
  molecules. 4) DCs are the main producers of IL-12 in addition to TNF-α, IL-6, TGF-β,
  IL-23, and IL-1β, which determine the differentiation of naïve T cells. 5) Expression
  of IL-12 is affected by microRNAs, transcription factors such as HIF-1α and ligands
  such as VCAM-1/VLA-4. 6) Upon interaction with DCs in lymphoid tissues in presence
  of cytokine signals, naive T cells differentiate into Th1, Th2 or Th17 cells and
  produce pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, or anti-inflammatory cytokines
  IL-4, IL-13 or IL-17. 7) Infected DCs are characterized by upregulation of anerobic
  glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, pentose phosphate pathway, and by down regulation
  of oxidative phosphorylation, which results in poor expansion of Th1 cells. 8) Vaccination
  with live attenuated Leishmania parasites has shown elevated IL-12 production and
  expansion of Th1 cells. 9) Similar to other innate immune cells, metabolomic immune
  regulation in DCs upon vaccination remains an unexplored area.
