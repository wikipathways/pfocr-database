caption: Main metabolic pathways involved in the associations among metagenomics,
  metabolomics and the Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT). (A) Overview of the main
  catabolic pathways of tryptophan and tyrosine. Tryptophan and tyrosine are the precursors
  for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine, respectively.
  The gut microbiota can also metabolise tryptophan and tyrosine to indoles and hydroxyphenolic
  acids, respectively. Dietary tryptophan is mostly metabolised via the Kynurenine
  pathway, which is activated by inflammation. (B) Overview of the folate-mediated
  one-carbon metabolism. The folate cycle (green) is required for the synthesis of
  DNA (pink and blue) as well as methylation reaction (DNA, proteins and lipids) through
  the methionine cycle (orange). Histidine (purple), choline and betaine are two sources
  of 1C units feeding into the one-carbon metabolism. Bacterial pathways have been
  shaded in red. Metabolites involved in the one-carbon metabolism and significantly
  associated with the SCWT are highlighted in bold in a yellow box. Bacterial functions
  participating in the one-carbon metabolism and significantly associated with the
  SCWT are highlighted in bold in a red box. AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
