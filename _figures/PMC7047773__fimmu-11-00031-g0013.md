caption: The kynurenine pathway generates immune modulatory agents, but it also supplies
  Quin to be directed to NAD+synthesis in cells of the immune system. Regulation of
  the enzyme QPRT controls the flow of kynurenine pathway metabolism to NAD+. Increased
  NAD+ demand during inflammation and infection is driven by a number of cellular
  actions including energy derivation, the respiratory burst, and cellular redox homeostasis.
  In addition, there are a number of enzymatic reactions that use NAD+ as cosubstrate,
  and these reactions consume NAD+. These include the PARP reaction for DNA repair
  (poly-ADP ribosylation) and mono-ADP ribosylases, such as tankerases TNKS1 and 2.
  Increased NAD+ demand may also come from infections by bacteria that employ NAD+
  hydrolases to deprive phagocytes of intracellular NAD+. NAD+ is also consumed by
  the NAD+-dependent deacetylases known as sirtuins, which regulate metabolism. Certain
  host enzymes/receptors also have NAD+ hydrolase activity including CD38 and CD157,
  which are ADP-ribosyl cyclases and hydrolases.
