caption: Schematic summary of the present findings. On the basis of the results of
  the current study, we propose that CB irradiation triggers reactivation of the MEK–ERK
  pathway subsequent to initial downregulation, which then initiates the mitochondrial
  pathway of caspase cascade activation, culminating in apoptotic death of glioma
  cells. Molecules involved in this cell death signaling pathway could be new targets
  for augmentation of CB therapy against gliomas. For instance, EGF may be used for
  MEK–ERK pathway activation, ABT-737 for the activation of mitochondrial apoptosis,
  and SMAC mimetics for caspase cascade activation
