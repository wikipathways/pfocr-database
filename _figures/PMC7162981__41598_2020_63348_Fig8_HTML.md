caption: Proposed model of the time-dependent effects of 10 Gy irradiation in mouse
  cortex NSPC cultures. Exposure of mouse cortex NSPC cultures to high X-ray levels
  causes a rapid increase of γH2AX foci and p53 pathway gene expression levels within
  few hours, followed by an early cell cycle arrest in G2/M and a later arrest in
  G1. By 24 h post-irradiation, significant apoptosis and upregulation of differentiation
  markers (e.g. Gfap) ensues, but the surviving cells are able to mitigate DNA damage
  and the transcriptional changes in p53 pathway and differentiation genes, restoring
  normal viability and proliferation rates. The dashed arrow between 24 h and 8d indicate
  that a phenotypic recovery of irradiated NSPCs takes places between these time points,
  but the exact timing was not characterized. See text for further details.
