caption: SCFAs can directly regulate blood pressure by binding to their receptors.
  Basal concentration of SCFAs could activate GPR41/GPR43, which triggers Gαi and/or
  Gαo to decrease cAMP, thereby inducing vasodilation and lowering the blood pressure
  level. A higher concentration of SCFAs could activate Olfr78, which triggers AC3
  and Golf in the olfactory signalling pathway to induce cAMP production, thereby
  increasing renin release and inducing vasoconstriction. AC3, adenylate cyclase type
  3; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; GPR, G-protein-coupled receptor; Olfr,
  olfactory receptor; and SCFA, short-chain fatty acid.
