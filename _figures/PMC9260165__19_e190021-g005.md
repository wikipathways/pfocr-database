caption: Mechanisms of C–C bond formation by P450s. (a) Proposed radical coupling
  mechanism of flaviolin by CYP158A2 []. The crystal structure of CYP158A2 in the
  complex with flaviolin indicates that the enzyme can accommodate two flaviolin molecules
  in the substrate-binding site, resulting in the radical coupling mechanism. (b)
  P450 StaP (CYP245A1) catalyzes an unusual C–C coupling reaction between the two
  indole rings of chromopyrrolic acid in the staurosporine biosynthetic pathway. Arrows
  shown in magenta represent proton or hydrogen atom transfer [–].
