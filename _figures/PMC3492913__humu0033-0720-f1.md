caption: Diagrammatic representation of BMP signaling pathway. Bone morphogenetic
  proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor β superfamily of cytokines
  and signal through serine/threonine receptors on the cell surface. BMP ligands bind
  to the BMP type I receptor BMPR1A or BMPR1B (also known as ALK6; not shown) in complex
  with the BMP type II receptor (BMPR2). Binding of ligand to the receptor complex
  stimulates BMPR1A to phosphorylate SMAD1/5/8 transcription factors, which translocate
  to the nucleus in combination with SMAD4 protein to regulate BMP-responsive genes.
  SMAD6 inhibits BMP signaling by inhibiting BMPR1A and BMPR1B activity [; ] or by
  competing with SMAD4 for binding with phosphorylated SMAD1 [], as indicated in the
  figure. It can also inhibit BMP signaling by recruiting Smad ubiquitin regulatory
  factor to activated BMP receptors to prime them for degradation [] and by binding
  certain transcription factors to repress transcription in the nucleus [].
