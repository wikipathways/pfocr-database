caption: 'Signaling cascade and transcription factors that mediate epigenetic changes
  that inhibit host immunity in myeloid cells. TLR4 recognizes LPS, and engages the
  MyD88-TRIF pathway to induce the TFs: NF-κB, AP-1, IRF3, IRF5 which leads to the
  induction of pro-inflammatory genes such as TNFA, IL1B, IL6, COX2 etc. IRF3 induces
  the production of IFNβ and TGFβ, which adds to the IFN signaling and induces STAT1
  leading to transcription of CCL5, CXCL10 and IRF7. Overwhelming LPS stimulation
  as seen in sepsis, leads to lesser production and engagement of TLR4 and its pathway
  components, with over-inflammation leading to production of inhibitory molecules
  such as IRAK-M, A20, Pellino-3, SHIP, which inhibit various parts of the LPS-TLR4
  signaling cascade, leading to a tolerized phenotype. Epigenetically, multiple mechanisms
  have been shown to lead to and maintenance of the tolerized phenotype. Guided by
  TFs such as NF-κB and its isoform RelB, which can recruit HDACs (SIRT included)
  either alone or in a repressome complex, usually with a chromatin modifier such
  as SWI/SNF results in deacetylation of histones, followed by addition of repressive
  methylation (H3K9, H3K3) by DNMT such as SMYD5 (in the NCOR-HDAC3 repressome), or
  KMT such as G9a bound to HMGB1 (can recruit H1 and HP1) to close the chromatin and
  suppress gene expression. Lineage TFs such as PU.1 provide good example of this
  assembly of the SWI/SNF complex containing BRG1 which can recruit HAT (p300) to
  acetylate H4K, HMT (MLL1/2/3) to add permissive H3K4 and demethylase such as JMJD3
  to remove repressive H3K27 to activate inflammatory genes upon LPS stimulation.
  The same PU.1 when bound to co-repressor BCL6 can induce tolerance by losing the
  SWI/SNF complex and recruitment of NuRD, which recruits HDAC3 to remove acetylation
  and induce de novo methylation via DNMT1/3B to close the chromatin and thus shutting
  down inflammatory gene transcription in tolerance. Created with BioRender.com. TLR4,
