caption: Engineering designs in this study were emphasized with red color. Klebsiella
  Dextrose Citrate medium (KDC medium) containing 7.5 g L−1 each of glucose and citrate
  was used to enhance the nitrogenase activity of K. oxytoca NG13. Citrate synthase
  from C. glutamicum (CgCS) and the Na+-dependent citrate symporter from NG13 (CitS)
  were overproduced to increase the carbon flux to 2-OG, a direct precursor of glutamate.
  ϕ90 plates were used to increase the aerial nitrogen supply to cells and thereby
  improve the glutamate production titer and rate. Klebsiella Doubled-Dextrose Citrate
  (KDDC) medium containing 15 g L−1 glucose and 7.5 g L−1 citrate extended the diazotrophic
  period. Glucose is catabolized by the EMP pathway to produce ATP, and the NifJ-dependent
  conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA provides electrons to NifF (flavodoxin), which
  transfers electrons to nitrogenase. The ATP produced is utilized for nitrogen assimilation
  by the GS-GOGAT pathway. In consideration of ATP production and consumption (highlighted
  in blue), one mole of glutamate is theoretically produced from 4.5 moles of glucose.
  Stoichiometry catalyzed by NifJ is expressed by n because other metabolic pathways
  branching from pyruvate are expected to be active. In the strain overproducing both
  CgCS and CitS (CgCS+CitS strain), extracellularly produced glutamate originated
  from citrate only and the carbon flow of CgCS (dotted blue arrow) did not appear
  to be active.
