caption: 'Cholesterol trafficking through the hepatocyte. (A) Cholesterol uptake and
  synthesis. Dietary cholesterol is absorbed in the jejunal mucosa through NPC1L1,
  incorporated into chylomicrons (CMs), and reaches the liver in CM remnants. CM remnants
  are taken up by the liver through interaction of the apoE protein on the CM remnant
  and LDLR on hepatocytes, which also binds to circulating LDL particles through interaction
  with apoB‐100 on the LDL surface. After binding to the LDLR, the complex undergoes
  receptor‐mediated endocytosis, processing through the late endosome/lysosome compartment,
  and transport into the metabolically active pool of cholesterol in the cytosol through
  NPC1. CE taken from HDL particles are selectively transported into the cytosol through
  SR‐B1, followed by hydrolysis through nCEH to join the metabolically active pool
  of cholesterol in the cytosol. Cholesterol can also be taken up from bile through
  NPC1L1 on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, when cells are deprived of cholesterol.
  Finally, cholesterol can also be synthesized de novo through the HMGCoAR, which
  is tightly regulated by SREBP‐2, the principal transcriptional activator of HMGCoAR.
  (B) Cholesterol secretion and excretion. Transport of cholesterol out of the cell
  is performed primarily through members of a superfamily of ABC transporters that
  use ATP to transport lipids across membranes. ABCA1 is a transmembrane protein present
  on the basolateral plasma membrane of hepatocytes that removes lipids from the cell
  membrane to an extracellular acceptor apolipoprotein ApoA‐I. ABCA1 interacts with
  lipid‐free apoA‐1 to generate nascent HDL particles, promoting cholesterol efflux
  from the cell. On the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, ABCG5 and ABCG8 form
  a heterodimer that functions to excrete sterols into the bile. Cholesterol may also
  be secreted into the circulation in the form of VLDL particles. Finally, cholesterol
  may be converted to bile acids and excreted into bile through BSEP, an ABC transporter
  (ABCB11) located on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. In the classical pathway,
  the rate‐limiting step for cholesterol conversion into bile acid is the microsomal
  cytochrome P450 CYP7A1, which results in 7‐hydroxycholesterol; however, alternative
  pathways include the mitochondrial CYP27A enzyme and 25‐hydroxylase enzyme, forming
  27‐hydroxycholesterol or 25‐hydroxycholesterol, respectively. (C) Hepatocyte LD.
  The LD membrane consists of a monolayer of phospholipids, and FC and is covered
  with proteins, including perilipins. The interior of the LD consists of triglycerides
  and CEs. When the concentration of FC within the LD membrane exceeds the saturation
  threshold, FC can precipitate as cholesterol crystals in the periphery of the LD.
