caption: 'Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia. (A). Clinical manifestations of HHT,
  Curaçao criteria. Telangiectasias in ear, hands, tongue, and lips; arteriovenous
  malformations in internal organs, epistaxis and family history. (B). TGF-β/BMP9/10
  signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Once the ligand binds to its receptor complex
  formed by the kinase receptors I and II, and the auxiliary receptor III (endoglin),
  the signaling cascade leads to the phosphorylation of Smad proteins. The translocation
  of the Smad protein complex into the nucleus results in transcriptional regulation
  on target genes. Endothelial cells (EC) express two types of type I kinase Receptors:
  ALK1 and ALK5.'
