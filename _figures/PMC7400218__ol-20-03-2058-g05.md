caption: TLR4 signaling pathways in cervical cancer. (A) Binding of LPS to TLR4 leads
  to the transmission of signals via MyD88, At the same time the activation of TLR5
  leads to increased Nox1 signaling. The primary role of NOX1 is to generate ROS.
  NOX1 signaling also leads to the inhibition of HIF-1α degradation, which increases
  the possibly of developing cervical cancer MyD88 signaling in conjunction with NOX1
  leads to the activation of transcription factors and Interfrons (IFN), leading to
  a pro-inflammatory and antiviral response. This pathway demonstrates how inflammation
  can lead to cancer progression. CD1, cluster differentiation 1; HIF-1α, hypoxia
