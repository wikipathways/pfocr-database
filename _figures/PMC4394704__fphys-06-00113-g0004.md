caption: An illustration of the coupling between the circadian neurons and PTTH-secreting
  neurons that control photoperiodism in A. pernyi. The site of coupling is at aaNAT
  transcription. aaNAT gene, a clock controlled gene, has several E-box enhancer elements
  where Cyc/Clk heterodimer binds to stimulate nat transcription. Up-regulation of
  this process leads to NAT translation that changes a balance between 5HT and MEL
  in favor of the latter. MEL stimulates PTTH synthesis/secretion in A. pernyi as
  Richter et al. () and Huybrechts et al. () demonstrated in P. americana (PTTH) and
  Locusta migratoria (AKH-related peptide precursor peptides, neuroparsins), respectively.
  All instrumentation for MEL synthesis is co-localized in circadian neurons in the
  dorsolateral protocerebrum. They juxtapose the PTTH neurons that have both MT (Mohamed
  et al., ) and two 5HTRs (Wang et al., ). The MEL receptor seems to be the type two-like
  because anti-hMT2 antibody reacted to these neurons and luzindol was effective to
  block MEL action. Since the same cells were reactive to anti-Rab8, PKC and PTTH
  antisera in P. americana (Hiragaki et al., ), the most likely process of stimulation
  by MEL binding is coupling to the Gq/PLC/Ca2+pathway as in mouse photoreceptor cells
  (Baba et al., ) then PKC phosphorylates Rab8 required for exocytotic release of
  PTTH.
