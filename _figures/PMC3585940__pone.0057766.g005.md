caption: The gene nodes and their interactions were obtained from literatures, and
  the alteration of gene expression was from . Orange arrows indicate the metabolic
  flux of glucose and fatty acid. Purple arrows indicate the interaction between different
  metabolic processes and the indicated signaling pathway. Red arrows show that the
  indicated process and pathway are expected to be upregulated in diabetic mouse liver
  based on the detected mRNA levels. Red and gray circles labeled on each gene indicate
  the genes are upregulated and unaffected in diabetic mouse liver respectively. CD36,
  fatty acid translocase; GLUT2, glucose transporter 2.
