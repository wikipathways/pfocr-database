caption: Neuromodulation of the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) synapse. (A)
  Activation of the serotonin receptor 5-HT7R elicits the depression of the PF-PC
  synapse via a postsynaptic mechanism that involves the protein kinase C (PKC)-MAPK
  signaling pathway (see text). (B) α-adrenergic receptors (α1-ARs) exert an inhibitory
  effect on PF-PC synaptic transmission via Gq/11 and phospholipase C (PLC). α2-ARs
  are known to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, via Gi-proteins, leading to a decrease of
  cAMP concentration and protein kinase A (PKA). β-ARs activation facilitates the
  PF-PC synaptic transmission via the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. (C) Acetylcholine
  induces a transient depression of PF-excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) via
  M1/M3 postsynaptic muscarinic receptors, which are coupled to Gq and linked to the
  cannabinoid signaling pathway.
