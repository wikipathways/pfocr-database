caption: Schematic representation of the Fas–FasL pathway. Binding of the Fas leads
  to recruitment and activation by the protein adaptor FADD of procaspase-8 and formation
  of the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). Active caspase-8 directly cleaves
  caspase-3 and initiates the caspase cascade, which ultimately leads to cell death.
  Soluble Fas and soluble FasL bind to the respective ligands inhibiting activation
  of the pathway. FLIP inhibits activation of caspase-8 and is thus a major anti-apoptotic
  protein.
