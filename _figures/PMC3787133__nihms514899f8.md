caption: Schematic representation of ICP10PK-mediated protection of uninfected neurons.
  ICP10PK infection of primary hippocampal cultures activates Ras and its downstream
  signaling pathways MEK/ERK and PI3-K/Akt. Activation of both pathways stimulates
  increased release of VEGF; activation of the MEK/ERK pathway also stimulates increased
  release of FKN. VEGF protects hippocampal cultures from NMDA-induced apoptosis through
  direct neuron-neuron cross-talk. FKN has paracrine activity in microglia, inducing
  them to release increased levels of IL-10 and decreased levels of TNF-α. This altered
  cytokine balance protects uninfected hippocampal cultures from NMDA-induced apoptosis
  (bidirectional neuron-microglia cross-talk).
papertitle: Multi-targeted neuroprotection by the HSV-2 gene ICP10PK includes robust
  bystander activity through PI3-K/Akt and/or MEK/ERK-dependent neuronal release of
  vascular endothelial growth factor and fractalkine.
