caption: 'p19Arf is induced by potentially oncogenic signals stemming from overexpression
  of oncogenes such as c-Myc, E2F1 and activated Ras (1). This Arf induction quenches
  inappropriate mitogenic signaling by diverting incipient cancer cells to undergo
  p53-dependent and -independent growth arrest or cell death. Dmp1 is unique in that
  it directly binds and activates the Arf promoter and induces cell cycle arrest in
  an Arf-dependent fashion (2). Both Dmp1-null and heterozygous mice show hypersensitivity
  to develop tumors in response to carcinogen DMBA and γ-irradiation. This phenotype
  could be explained by the inactivation of the Arf–Mdm2–p53 pathway in the absence
  of the functional Dmp1 protein, although it is possible that Dmp1 has other targets
  than Arf. D-type cyclins inhibit Dmp1’s transcriptional activity in a CDK-independent
  fashion when E2Fs do not bind to the same promoter; however, D-cyclins cooperate
  with Dmp1 to activate the Arf promoter (3). The Dmp1 promoter is efficiently activated
  by the oncogenic Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK–Jun pathway (4), but is repressed by overexpressed
  c-Myc, E2Fs and by physiological mitogenic signaling (5) [,]. Our study shows that
  the induction of Arf by oncogenic Ras is dependent on Dmp1 []. The Dmp1–Arf pathway
  is inhibited by NF-κB proteins in response to genotoxic stress signaling. Both Mdm2
  and Hdm2 are direct targets of p53 (6), and both human and murine Arf promoters
  are repressed by p53 (7) [–]. It was reported that the Hdm2 promoter is also responsive
  to oncogenic Ras signaling (8), which can antagonize the Arf induction by the Dmp1
  pathway. However, the Arf induction by Ras eventually overrides the Mdm2 activity
  in normal cells, which undergo p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. AF: Assembly factor.'
