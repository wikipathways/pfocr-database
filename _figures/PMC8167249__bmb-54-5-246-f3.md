caption: Signaling transduction instigated by the Golgi complex. (Left) Palmitoylation
  of Ras obtained at the Golgi complex is required for membrane recruitment and activation
  of signaling pathways. Signaling pathway of N-Ras at the Golgi complex shows a sustained
  activity as compared to N-Ras signaling instigated from the plasma membrane. (Right)
  Retrograde COPI transport is regulated by KDELR-mediated PKA signaling pathway.
  Cargo export in TGN is regulated by SRC signaling pathway which is activated by
  KDELR.
