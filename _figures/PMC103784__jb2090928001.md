caption: Biosynthetic pathway of melanin in brown and black fungi. The solid arrows
  indicate the main melanin pathway, and the dashed arrows indicate branching pathways
  from the melanin pathway. The hollow arrowhead indicates that the conversion requires
  more than one step. The reduction steps are indicated by [H] and the oxidation steps
  are indicated by [O]. Dehydration steps are labeled −H2O. A reduction step which
  can be inhibited by the fungicide tricyclazole is indicated with Tc.
