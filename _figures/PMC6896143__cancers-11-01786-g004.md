caption: A diagrammatic representation of the pathways that can indirectly lead to
  inhibition of apoptosis in a cancer cell. (a) Janus activated kinase 1 (JAK1)/signal
  transducer and activation of transcription-3 (STAT3) pathway is upregulated due
  to the accumulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) which causes phosphorylation of JAK1
  and STAT3, promoting cell survival and increase proliferation. However, HO3867 inhibits
  phosphorylation of STAT3 causing apoptosis. (b) Wnt pathway is activated by the
  binding of Wnt molecule to the frizzled receptor (FZD). This causes the formation
  of a complex and accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. Saturation of β-catenin
  in cancer cells causes its translocation into the nucleus, where it initiates uninterrupted
  transcription leading to an increase in proliferation and chemoresistance. However,
  sinomenine (SIN) degrades β-catenin in the cytoplasm and berbamine inhibits transcription
  in the nucleus of cancer cells eventually causing apoptosis. (c) Hepatocyte growth
  factor (HGF) pathway initiates upon binding of HGF to c-Met (tyrosine kinase receptor)
  which leads to phosphorylation of c-Met, which in turn activates various other cell
  signaling pathways including AKT, PI3K pathways important for cell survival, proliferation
  and angiogenesis. BMS-777607 obstructs the phosphorylation of c-MET and SU11274
  decreases the concentration of c-MET in the cell to inhibit HGF pathway, both leading
  to apoptosis (d) Growth factors attach to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) present
  on the extracellular surface of the cell and can switch on the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in the
  cell. An increased concentration of growth factors leads to over-activation of MAPK/ERK
  pathway in cancer cells. Delphinidin and Mab216 down-regulates this pathway by inhibiting
  phosphorylation of ERK, AKT, which eventually leads to apoptosis.
