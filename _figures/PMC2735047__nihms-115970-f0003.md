caption: In Phase I, the recipient conditioning regimen damages host tissues and causes
  release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1 and IL-6. Increased levels
  of these cytokines leads to activation of host antigen presenting cells (APCs).
  In Phase II, host APCs activate mature donor cells. The subsequent proliferation
  and differentiation of these activated T cells produces additional effectors that
  mediate the tissue damage, including Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes, Natural Killer (NK)
  cells, TNFα and IL-1. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that has leaked through the damaged
  intestinal mucosa triggers additional TNFα production. TNFα can damage tissue directly
  by inducing necrosis and apoptosis in the skin and GI tract through either TNF receptors
  or the Fas pathway. TNFα plays a direct role in intestinal GVHD damage which further
  amplifies damage in the skin, liver and lung in a “cytokine storm.”
