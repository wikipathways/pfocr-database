caption: EGCG-Mediated Pathways Targeting Oxidative Stress. Showing the diverse molecular
  pathways through which EGCG mitigates oxidative stress. EGCG inhibits the phosphorylation
  of STAT3, thereby disrupting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which is crucial for
  cell proliferation and survival. Additionally, EGCG targets key proteins in the
  Delta-Notch pathway, including Notch, HEY, and HES1, further influencing cellular
  differentiation and survival mechanisms
