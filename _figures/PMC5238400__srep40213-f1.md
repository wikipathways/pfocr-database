caption: '(a) A schematic representation of a truncated transsulphuration pathway
  in malaria parasite: Absence of CBS and CGL enzymes results in a truncated transsulphuration
  (TS) pathway in the parasite. Abbreviations: CβS-Cystathionine beta synthase, CγL-
  Cystathionine gamma lyase, MT- Methyl Transferase, MS- Methionine Synthase, SAHH-
  S-Adenyl -L- Homocysteine Hydrolase, SAMS- S-Adenosyl Methionine Synthetase, γGCS-
  Gamma glutamyl Cysteine Synthetase, GS- Glutathione Synthetase, GR- Glutathione
  Reductase, GPx- Glutathione Peroxidase, PE- Phospho ethanolamine, PC- Phosphatidyl
  choline, HCy- Homocysteine, AdoMet- S-Adenosyl Methionine, AdoHCy- S-Adenyl-L- Homocysteine,
  GSH- Reduced Glutathione, GSSG- Oxidized Glutathione, MRP1- Multi Drug Resistance
  Protein1, ASC- Amino Acid Transporter Family. (b) Absence of cystathionine confirms
  a disrupted TS pathway in Plasmodium falciparum. The figure shows levels of cystathionine
  in normal RBC (nRBC), infected RBC (iRBC), Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae (Sc) as measured by LC-MS. Equal number of cells from each were analysed
  using LC-MS approach. Plasmodium falciparum, nRBC and iRBC showed negligible levels
  of cystathionine while Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the eukaryotic positive control
  for the transsulphuration pathway, showed a significant level of this metabolic
  intermediate. Cystathionine is a key metabolic intermediate of the TS pathway and
  its absence in Plasmodium validates the truncation of the TS pathway in the parasite
  (P = 0.0002, n = 3).'
