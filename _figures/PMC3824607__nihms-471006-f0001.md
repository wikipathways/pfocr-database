caption: TNFα-mediated transient IKK activation pathways. (A) Signaling pathways to
  full IKK activation. Upon ligation, TNFR1 recruits TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, and cIAP1/2.
  TRAF2 and cIAP1/2, in conjunction with UbcH5, catalyze RIP1 ubiquitination through
  linear (M1-pUb) and K63 linkages (K63-pUb), and also undergo autoubiquitination
  through K63-linkage. K63-pUb recruits the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex, and M1-pUb recruits
  the IKKα-IKKβ-NEMO complex, leading to TAK1-mediated activation of the early phase
  of IKK. Thereafter, K63-pUb recruits the HOIL-1L–HOIP complex, which in turn recruits
  and catalyzes linear ubiquitination of NEMO, leading to more IKK recruitment and
  full activation of IKK. Such full IKK activation is required for the efficient expression
  of NF-κB target genes. (B) RIP1-independent pathway to delayed IKK activation. RIP1
  protein is not detectable in embryonic hepatocytes. As a result, upon TNFR1 ligation,
  receptor-recruited TRAF2 and cIAP1/2 undergo increased autoubiquitination through
  K63 and K48 linkages. The K63-pUb chains then recruit the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 and HOIP–HOIL-1
  complexes, leading to activation of the delayed phase of IKK. Such delayed IKK activation
  is sufficient for induction of some NF-κB target genes (e.g., IκBα and IP-10).
