caption: Schematic illustration of the inhibitory effects of THL and its active fraction
  EAS5 on the oncogenic signaling pathways in NB4 cells. The arrow indicates promotion,
  and the T-shaped bar indicates repression. The dramatic inhibition on ERK pathway
  is indicated by a thicker T-shaped bar. The data of THL are presented in , and the
  data of EAS5 are presented in .
