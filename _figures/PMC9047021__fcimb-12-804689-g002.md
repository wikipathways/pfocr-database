caption: F. nucleatum promotes cell proliferation by upregulating miR-21 and induces
  chemoresistance in CRC patients by downregulating miR-4802 and miR-18a*. F. nucleatum
  initially recognizes TLR4/MYD88 signaling pathway and activates the key downstream
  effector NF-κB. NF-κB can bind to the promoter region of miR-21 and upregulate miR-21
  expression, resulting in the subsequent downregulation of the downstream target
  gene RASA1. The partial functional loss of RASA1 can activate the GTPase activity
  of RAS, triggering the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (RAS-MAPK) signaling pathway. MAPK signaling
  pathway plays an important part in increasing cell proliferation, eventually leading
  to tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in the F. nucleatum–mediated chemoresistance of CRC
  cells, miR-4802 and miR-18a*, which are both dependent on the TLR4 and MYD88 signaling
  pathways, are significantly downregulated. The selective loss of miR-4802 and miR-18a*
  induces the upregulation of ATG7 and ULK1, respectively, which are members of autophagy
  signaling elements. Therefore, when these F. nucleatum–infected CRC cells are treated
  with chemotherapy agents, the autophagy pathway will be activated and consequently
  promote chemoresistance via suppressing cell apoptosis.

  description: F. nucleatum promotes cell proliferation by upregulating miR-21 and
    induces chemoresistance in CRC patients by downregulating miR-4802 and miR-18a*.
    F. nucleatum initially recognizes TLR4/MYD88 signaling pathway and activates the
    key downstream effector NF-κB. NF-κB can bind to the promoter region of miR-21
    and upregulate miR-21 expression, resulting in the subsequent downregulation of
    the downstream target gene RASA1. The partial functional loss of RASA1 can activate
    the GTPase activity of RAS, triggering the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (RAS-MAPK) signaling
    pathway. MAPK signaling pathway plays an important part in increasing cell proliferation,
    eventually leading to tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in the F. nucleatum–mediated
    chemoresistance of CRC cells, miR-4802 and miR-18a*, which are both dependent
    on the TLR4 and MYD88 signaling pathways, are significantly downregulated. The
    selective loss of miR-4802 and miR-18a* induces the upregulation of ATG7 and ULK1,
    respectively, which are members of autophagy signaling elements. Therefore, when
    these F. nucleatum–infected CRC cells are treated with chemotherapy agents, the
    autophagy pathway will be activated and consequently promote chemoresistance via
    suppressing cell apoptosis.
