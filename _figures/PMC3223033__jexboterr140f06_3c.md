caption: 'Schematic illustration of the main metabolic pathways based on the proteins
  identified in the citrus pulp chromoplasts. Metabolic pathway reconstruction was
  performed using the PlantCyc database (http://www.gramene.org/pathway/). Identified
  pathways were numbered according to column (A) in Supplementary Table S1 at JXB
  online, and are depicted by solid lines. Missing pathways are shown by broken lines,
  and missing proteins are indicated by abbreviations of the protein plus #. Different
  coloured lines represent different biochemical reactions: pink, isoprenoid metabolism;
  purple, pathway of lipoxygenase; red, glycolysis pathway; blue, amino acid metabolism;
  lawn green, pentose phosphate cycle; bright green, pyruvate cycle; black, other
  pathways. DOXP, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; MEP, 2-C-methylerythritol 4-phosphate;
