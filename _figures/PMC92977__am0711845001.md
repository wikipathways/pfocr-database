caption: 'Schematic representation of pathways involved in glucose fermentation via
  glycolysis (upper grey box), galactose fermentation via the Leloir pathway (lower
  grey box), and biosynthesis of EPS in L. lactis. Cell membranes are indicated by
  vertical lines. The following enzymes are involved (encoding genes are indicated):
  phosphoglucomutase (pgm); UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (galU); UDP-galactose epimerase
  (galE); galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferease (galT); galactokinase (galK); galactose
  mutarotase (galM); and dTDP-rhamnose biosynthetic enzyme system (rfb). Multiple-step
  reactions are lumped together and are indicated by dotted arrows. The multiple reactions
  involved in synthesis of sugar polymers are indicated by diamonds.'
