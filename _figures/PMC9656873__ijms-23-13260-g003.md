caption: Aspirin strongly inhibited cGAS-mediated TBK1–IRF3 signaling. The sensing
  of cytosolic DNA by cGAS is central to the pathogenesis of several autoinflammatory
  syndromes and some autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
  because the presence of DNA in the cytoplasm is usually a sign of microbial infections
  and is quickly detected by cGAS, eliciting anti-infection immune responses. However,
  the chronic activation of cGAS by self-DNA leads to severe autoimmune diseases for
  which no effective treatment is yet available. The activation of cGAS signaling
  requires its deacetylation, while acetylation inhibits cGAS activation, and the
  compulsory acetylation of cGAS by aspirin forcefully suppresses self-DNA–induced
  autoimmunity, giving aspirin therapeutic potential in this context. Recently, the
  unique role of the cGAS–stimulator of the STING pathway in orchestrating innate
  and adaptive immunity has led to vast interest in employing antagonists of the cGAS–STING
  pathway as SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic adjuvants. The DNA sensor cGAS detects pathogenic
  or cytosolic nucleic acids and produces the second messenger, 2′3′-cGAMP, which
  binds to STING. Activated STING dimerizes and translocates from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. STING is ubiquitinated at the Golgi apparatus,
  an anchor for TBK1. Stimulation of the cGAS–STING pathway by cytosolic nucleic acids
  can activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB),
  and promote the transcription of type I interferons (IFNs) and other proinflammatory
  cytokines, modulating antigen presentation and immune responses. Therefore, cGAS–STING
  antagonists are promising adjuvants for constructing effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.
  Acetylation inhibits cGAS activation, and enforced acetylation of cGAS by aspirin
  robustly suppresses self-DNA–induced autoimmunity. Aspirin inhibited cGAS-mediated
  IFN production []. The acute or chronic use of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs was not
  associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes []. NSAID use might confer a modest
  benefit concerning survival []. Early aspirin prescription may be associated with
  lower odds of in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19
  in 2,446,650 COVID-19–positive patients []. Aspirin is associated with decreased
  mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and in-hospital mortality in hospitalized
  COVID-19 patients. NSAID use might confer a modest benefit concerning survival [].
