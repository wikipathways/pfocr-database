caption: (A) Architecture of classical voltage-activated channels. Kv channels are
  tetramers, with each subunit containing six segments spanning the membrane (gray
  slab). S1–S4 from each subunit form a voltage-sensing domain in the tetrameric channel
  (only one is depicted). S5–S6 from four subunits form the central pore domain. The
  S4 Arg residues (blue) drive motions of that helix in response to voltage changes.
  A well-conserved Phe in S2 (green) is the likely charge-transfer center. Acidic
  residues stabilizing Arg residues within the membrane are not shown. Both Nav and
  Cav channels contain four repeating S1–S6 segments within a subunit (pseudotetramers).(B)
  Architecture of dimeric Hv channels. Each subunit contains four transmembrane segments
  corresponding to the S1–S4 in Kv channels. Hv1 channels do not contain separate
  pore domains, and the permeation pathway for protons is contained within S1–S4.
  Dimerization interfaces exist between S1 helices and in the C-terminal coiled-coil.
  The S1 helix acidic residue studied by  is shown in red.(C) Chemical structures
  of an Arg side chain and the Hv1 inhibitor 2GBI described by , with guanidine groups
  (blue).
