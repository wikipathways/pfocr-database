caption: Proposed model for miR319c function in response to cold in melon. Low temperature
  induced a decrease of miR319c that promoted a TCP2-mediated increase in HY5 that
  transcriptionally modulated the accumulation of key components in the anthocyanin
  biosynthesis pathway (CHS and CHI), which is involved in cold response.
papertitle: Alternative processing of its precursor is related to miR319 decreasing
  in melon plants exposed to cold.
