caption: 'These include the pathways for leucine, valine, isoleucine, histidine, lysine,
  threonine, tryptophan, phenylalanine and methionine, which were all more complete
  in the Urchoanozoan than in the Urmetazoan. Green: pathway components present in
  the Urchoanozoan and the Urmetazoan. Purple: pathway components present in the Urchoanozoan
  but absent from the Urmetazoan.'
