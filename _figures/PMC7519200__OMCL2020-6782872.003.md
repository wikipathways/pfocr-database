caption: The innate immune system is the first line of defense against infection and
  injury and plays critical roles in the maintenance of brain homeostasis. It has
  been shown that astrocytes, microglia, macrophages, NK cells, mast cells, and oligodendrocytes
  serve as the innate immune cells of the brain []. Among these cells, microglia are
  mainly innate immune cells that are derived from the embryonic yolk sac []. Under
  physiological conditions, microglia constantly survey their microenvironments and
  present in the resting state with small cellular bodies and slender branching [].
  Under pathological conditions, microglia are activated and converted into amoeboid
  reactive cells, with the production of proinflammatory factors []. Overactivation
  of microglia has been implicated to the development of neuroinflammation []. In
  addition to microglia, astrocytes also are key innate immune cells involved in the
  regulation of neuroinflammation []. Astrocytes became reactive astrocytes with significant
  changes in morphology, function, and gene expression in response to CNS injuries
  and diseases []. A previous study suggests that the increase of inflammatory factor
  (TNF-α, IL-1β, and iNOS) gene expression is observed in both primary microglia and
  astrocytes after treatment with LPS []. Growing evidence supports a role for SIRT1
  in the regulation of inflammatory responses in CNS. For example, the SIRT1 activator
  decreases the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 in microglial BV2 cells by LPS stimulation,
  while the SIRT1 inhibitor increases the inflammatory factors release []. Another
  study found that SIRT1 inhibition upregulates the gene expression levels of TNF-α
  and IL-1β and ROS production in astrocytes after stimulation with LPS []. However,
  the molecular mechanisms involving SIRT1 and neuroinflammation are still unclear.
  Emerging potential regulatory mechanisms of SIRT1 in the process of neuroinflammation
  may involve the NF-κB pathway, Toll-like receptor pathway, NLRP3 inflammasome pathway,
  and MAPK signal pathway (). These signal pathways will be discussed in the following
  paragraphs.
