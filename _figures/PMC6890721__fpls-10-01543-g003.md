caption: MEP, carotenoid and chlorophyll biosynthetic pathways in plants, and expression
  patterns of genes related to pigment metabolism in ‘Xiaoxueya’ leaves. (A) Genes
  involved in the MEP biosynthetic pathway. (B) Genes involved in the carotenoid biosynthetic
  pathway. (C) Genes involved in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. Genes used
  for expression analysis are shown in red. The heat maps were generated using the
  mean of three replicates and MeV software. The blue-white-red schemes are labelled
  above the heat map. Red and blue represent relatively high and low expression levels,
  respectively, compared to those shown in white. Asterisks (*) indicate significant
  differences (p value ≤ 0.05) and |log2FoldChange| ≥ 1 between the values from the
  sample and third leaf.
