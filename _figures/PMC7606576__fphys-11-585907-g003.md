caption: The WNK/SPAK/CCC signaling pathway in cell volume homeostasis. Changes in
  extracellular osmolarity induce cell shrinkage or swelling. Hypertonic stress with
  higher extracellular solute concentrations will induce water loss and cell shrinkage.
  This activates the regulatory volume increase (RVI) response, in which influx of
  Na+, K+, and Cl– ions is stimulated to restore normal cell volume. On the contrary,
  lower extracellular solute concentrations (hypotonic stress) will induce water molecules
  entry and swelling, activating the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response, in
  which K+ and Cl– efflux is stimulated, followed by water loss and cell volume restoration.
  Transport proteins involved in RVI include the NKCC1 (green) cotransporter that
  is phosphorylated and activated by the SPAK and OSR1 kinases, which in turn are
  activated by phosphorylation mediated by the volume-sensitive kinases WNK1 and WNK3.
  The KCC cotransporters (orange) are inhibited by WNK-SPAK/OSR1-mediated phosphorylation.
  During RVD, KCCs and NKCC1 are dephosphorylated by phosphatases, which results in
  net K+ and Cl– efflux.
