caption: Transcriptional profiling of teratomas comparing wild-type (WT) vs mutant
  VHL. A) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes from embryonic stem (ES)
  cell teratomas. Stably transfected Vhl −/− mouse ES cells expressing WT, P81S (both
  clones represented), or R167Q VHL were injected subcutaneously into the flank region
  of nude mice and allowed to grow for 4 weeks. RNA was isolated from three to four
  independent tumors from each genotype and used to perform microarray analysis using
  the Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.1 whole genome array. Differentially expressed genes
  between VHL genotypes were determined using Partek Genomics Suite. Statistical significance
  was determined by Student t test and analysis of variance, P ≤ .01. B) List of pathways
  differentially regulated between both VHL mutants and the WT VHL teratomas. Biological
  pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis on 1644 genes that
  were differentially regulated between WT and mutant VHL teratomas; 1065 genes were
  downregulated and 579 genes were upregulated in mutant VHL teratomas compared with
  WT. Canonical pathway analysis was measured as a ratio of the number of genes from
  the dataset that map to a pathway divided by the total number of genes that map
  to the canonical pathway. Fisher exact test was used to calculate P values.
