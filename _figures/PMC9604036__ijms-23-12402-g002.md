caption: AhR signaling in pesticide-induced dysbiosis, and inflammation. AhR acts
  as a ligand-activated sensor of endogenous and exogenous factors. After dimerization
  with AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT), it binds to response elements in the DNA and
  promotes the transcription of genes involved in physiological pathways, notably
  CYP1A expression, contributing to maintain the epithelial barrier integrity. However,
  in dysbiosis, deregulated production of microbiome metabolites is responsible for
  altered stimulation of the AhR pathway, promoting inflammation. Created with BioRender.com.
