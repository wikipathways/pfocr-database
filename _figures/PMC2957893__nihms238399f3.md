caption: Genes in one pathway have complex “net” interactions, which should be taken
  into consideration when analyzing proteomics/genomic data. Generally, in pathway
  analysis, each pathway is deemed as a set of genes, and the goal is often to detect
  associations between the overall activities of the genes in the pathway and a phenotype
  of interest (e.g., disease outcomes). However, simplifying “pathways” into “sets”
  of genes results in the loss of information—the interaction relationships among
  genes within the same pathway or across different pathways. This figure illustrates
  the gene-gene interaction patterns for part of the cell cycle pathway. The topology
  of the network is from the KEGG database; www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway.html. Each
  gene in this network interacts with different neighbors and thus plays its unique
  role in maintaining the pathway function.
