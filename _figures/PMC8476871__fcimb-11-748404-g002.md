caption: Diagrammatic representation of the intriguing relationship between protozoan
  parasite virulence factors and the NF-κB pathway. The figure represents the regulation
  of the NF-κB pathway by the extracellular protozoan parasite Eh and its virulence
  factors, which includes SAP, EhCP-A1, EhCP -A4 and Eh genomic DNA (1) and by different
  intracellular protozoan parasites T. gondii virulence factors, namely, TgESAs, Cathepsin
  C1, ROP18 and HSP70 (2), L. major/Mexicana live infection (3), Plasmodium pathogenic
  component hemozoin (4) and T. cruzi secreted lysosomal peptidase cruzipain (5) at
  different levels by modulating the inflammatory response during host-pathogen interaction.
  Virulence factors and live infection modulates NF-κB signaling at multiple levels.
  Both intracellular and extracellular protozoan parasites differentially modulate
  the NF-κB pathway. Note, purple color arrows indicate activation/promotion while
  red color arrows depict inhibition. The detailed mechanisms of action of the virulence
  factors are described in the text.
