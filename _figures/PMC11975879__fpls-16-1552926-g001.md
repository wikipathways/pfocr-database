caption: 'Plant cell wall structure and oligogalacturonides (OGs) signalling pathway.
  The illustration represents the plant cell wall and the release of DAMPs, such as
  OGs, upon CW rupture. The inset illustrates OG biosynthesis: homogalacturonan is
  cleaved by PG, whose action is modulated by PGIP to produce and accumulate OGs with
  a DP of 10–15. OGs are recognised by Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) on the
  cell surface, triggering signalling cascades that involve Reactive Oxygen Species
  (ROS) production, activation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways,
  transcriptional reprogramming and hormone production and accumulation. Together,
  these responses collectively enhance plant resistance to pathogens'
