caption: Overview of macrophage-endothelial cell crosstalk in particle induced toxicity.
  Particle induced a cellular and a cellular oxidant generation leads to phosphorylation
  of JNK and NF-kB resulting in inflammatory cytokine gene and protein expression
  in RAW 264.7cells. Among the produced chemical mediators CXCR3 agonists (CXCL9,
  10 and 11) are prominent. These mediators act on endothelial cells and leads to
  impaired wound closure and increased monolayer permeability. Endothelial cells CXCR3
  inhibition partially prevents these changes and reduces endothelial cell toxicity
  and pro-inflammatory response.
