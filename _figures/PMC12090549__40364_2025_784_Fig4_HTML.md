caption: 'Immunosuppressive effects of adenosine within the tumor microenvironment.
  The tumor microenvironment is composed of a diverse array of immune and non-immune
  cells, each exhibiting distinct expression profiles of functional adenosine receptors
  and adenosine-generating enzymes, mainly including A2AR, A2BR, CD39, and CD73. Adenosine
  facilitates tumor immune evasion by impairing protective immune components such
  as DCs, NK cells, T cells, and neutrophils, while simultaneously promoting the activity
  of immunosuppressive cells, including Tregs, M2 macrophages, and MDSCs. Targeting
  the various adenosinergic pathways may effectively reverse the adenosine-mediated
  immunosuppressive microenvironment. DCs: Dendritic cells; NK cell: Natural killer
  cell; Treg cells: Regulatory T cells; MDSC: Myeloid-derived suppressor cell; Mø:
  Macrophage; CAF: Cancer-associated fibroblast'
