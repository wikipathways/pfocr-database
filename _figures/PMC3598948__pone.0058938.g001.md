caption: In thymidine salvage, thymidine is transported across the cell membrane and
  phosphorylated by TK1 into thymidine monophosphate (TMP). The thymidine is further
  phosphorylated into thymidine diphosphate (TDP) and thymidine triphosphate (TTP)
  and then incorporated into DNA. Alternatively, using the de novo synthesis pathway,
  deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) is converted to TMP by TS which can then be further
  phosphorylated and incorporated into DNA. Similarly to thymidine, [18F]-FLT is transported
  into the cell and phosphorylated into [18F]-FLT monophosphate ([18F]-FLTMP) and
  trapped by TK1. [18F]-FLTMP can be further phosphorylated into [18F]-FLT diphosphate
  ([18F]-FLTDP) and [18F]-FLT triphosphate ([18F]-FLTTP), however, due to the substitution
  of OH with 18F in the 5-prime position, [18F]-FLTTP is not incorporated into the
  DNA.
