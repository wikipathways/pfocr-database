caption: Figure 2. The cellular prion protein is absolutely required for the toxicity
  of infectious prions (A), implying that PrPSc exerts neurotoxicity by docking to
  PrPC (B). This toxicity may also be elicited by PrP variants occurring naturally,
  such as PrP carrying supernumerary octapeptide repeats (C), or experimentally constructed
  toxic variants such as PrP versions carrying deletions of the hinge region (D).
  It was recently discovered that prion infection results in a chain of events that
  ultimately quenches protein translation, but it remains to be seen whether the toxicity
  elicited by PrP mutants (Panels C and D) utilizes the same pathway.
