caption: Therapies targeting p53 functions. p53 is stabilized and accumulates upon
  environmental stresses such as DNA damage or oncogene activation, resulting in cell
  cycle arrest or cell death. AKT activation through the PI3K pathway can phosphorylate
  cytoplasmic MDM2, resulting in its nuclear import. Nuclear MDM2 ubiquitinates p53
  and targets it for proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm. RITA binds to p53 and
  interferes with the interaction of MDM2 and p53, enabling activation of p53. Agents
  such as PRIMA-1 restore the ability of mutant p53 to bind to the p53 transcriptional
  response elements of target genes and CP-31398 stabilizes the DNA binding domain
  of mutant and wild-type p53
