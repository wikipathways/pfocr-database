caption: 'Activation of MRS reconfigures mitochondrial metabolism in yeast. Glutamate
  starvation and mitochondrial respiratory deficiency in mtDNA-depleted cells (ρ0
  cells) activate MRS to express genes involved in mitochondrial TCA cycle (CIT1,
  ACO1 and IDH1/2) and the peroxisomal glyoxylate cycle (CIT2). When the RTG pathway
  is not in operation, the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors,
  Rtg1 and Rtg3 are sequestered to the cytoplasm where Rtg3 is hyperphosphorylated.
  Mks1 promotes Rtg3 hyperphosphorylation by somehow preventing the Rtg3 dephosphorylation
  and negatively regulates the pathway. When the retrograde pathway is turned on,
  Rtg3 becomes partially dephosphorylated, enters the nucleus together with Rtg1 and
  binds R box to activate transcription. Rtg2, a cytoplasmic protein with an N-terminal
  ATP-binding domain, localizes upstream of Rtg1 and Rtg3. In the absence of Rtg2,
  CIT2 is no longer responsive to mitochondrial abnormality. Rtg2 binds to and inactivates
  Mks1, enabling for activation of Rtg1/3 and the RTG pathway. Physiological concentrations
  of ATP dissociates Mks1 from Rtg2 and negatively regulates the pathway.() The SPS
  complex is a sensor for external amino acids and important for the glutamate repression
  of the RTG pathway and the inactivation of the SPS sensor system results in Rtg2-dependent
  increase of CIT2 expression and a loss of glutamate repression. Lst8, which is an
  integral component of the target of rapamycin (TOR) complexes, is also a negative
  regulator of the RTG pathway and regulates the RTG pathway at two points: upstream
  and downstream of Rtg2. Rtg1/3-dependent gene expression is activated in cells in
  which TOR signaling mediated by the PI kinase-related kinases, Tor1 and Tor2, is
