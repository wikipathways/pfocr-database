caption: Pathways that modulate canonical Wnt signaling. Canonical Wnt signaling requires
  Frizzled (Fz) receptors and a LRP5/6 co-receptor. This signal induces stabilization
  of β-catenin through Dishevelled (Dvl)-mediated inhibition of the destruction complex.
  Stabilized β-cateninaccumulates in the nucleus where TCFs recruits it and associated
  co-regulators BCL9 and Pygopus (Pygo) to Wnt target genes for regulation. Tankyrase
  is an enzyme recently discovered to inactivate the destruction complex through ADP
  PARsylation of Axin. Secreted inhibitors such as DKK-1, DKK-2, and DKK-3 prevent
  canonical signaling through negative actions on LRP5/6. Secreted inhibitors such
  as the SFRPs inhibit all types of Wnt signaling by direct binding to Wnt ligands
  (WIF and others not shown). Wnt ligands are present in the tumor microenvironment
  through production by cancer cells and infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages
  (green cells),which release Wnt 5a. Non-canonical types of Wnt signaling do not
  involve LRP5/6 co-receptors, and they trigger multiple kinase cascades, including
  those that involve calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), protein kinase
  C (PKC), and others (c-Jun-N-terminal kinase and the planar cell polarity pathway
  not shown). Activation of these signals can inhibit the actions of LEF/TCFs, including
  the nuclear export of TCF-1, even in colon cancer cells where the destruction complex
  is nonfunctional and high levels of β-catenin are constitutively available. Other
  signals released in the tumor microenvironment (i.e.,stromal fibroblasts, brown
  cells) activate pathways that enhance Wnt target gene regulation. Pathways relevant
  to colon cancer include signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) for epidermal
  growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF), or through
  integrin receptors to growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 (Grb2). RTK and integrin
  signaling activates K-RAS, a GTPase often detected as a mutation-activated oncogene
  in colon tumors and a pathway that stimulates the formation of the transcription
  factor activator protein-1 (AP-1).
