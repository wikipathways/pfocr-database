caption: Based on the information presented in this and previous studies [], we propose
  the following model of the signaling pathway required to activate the recombination-dependent
  arrest in mouse spermatocytes. DSBs are sensed by the MRE11 complex and lead to
  activatation of ATM, which in turn activates CHK2, leading to the upregulation of
  p53 and TAp63, which implement the recombination-dependent arrest that blocks progression
  to mid/late pachynema.
