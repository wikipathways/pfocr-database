caption: a Intrabacterial ATP concentration in intracellular persisters (exposed to
  50× MIC oxacillin for 24 h) and control samples (extracellular bacteria mixed with
  J774 cells lysate). Appropriate controls were performed to ensure the absence of
  contamination by eukaryotic ATP. Data are means ± SEM of three independent experiments.
  Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test. ns non-statistically
  significant. b Schematic pathway of genes related to central carbon metabolism,
  annotated according to KEGG orthology and Genbank database and their log2 Fold Change
  expression levels. c MA-plot of genes related to amino acid metabolism within the
  stringent response stimulon (Supplementary Fig. ). The graph displays the log2 Fold
  Change expression as a function of log2 Base Mean (mean expression signal across
  all samples). Genes prominently activated after amino acid depletion are pointed.
  The dotted line indicates the basal expression level in control samples. Statistical
  significance is based on adjusted P-value. d Quantitative real-time PCR of transcripts
  of genes related to amino acid synthesis in intracellular persisters exposed to
  50x MIC oxacillin for the indicated periods. Data are means ± SEM of three independent
  experiments. a, d Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
