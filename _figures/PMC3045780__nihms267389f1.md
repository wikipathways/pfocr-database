caption: Ipc1 consumes phytoceramide and generates diacylglycerol (DAG) in the synthesis
  of IPC, which is subsequently transformed into MIPC and M(IP)2C. Isc1 generates
  phytoceramide in the hydrolysis of IPC, MIPC or M(IP)2C. The mammalian homologs,
  sphingomyelin synthase (SMS1 and SMS2) and sphingomyelinase (SMases), which consume
  and generate ceramide, respectively, are shown for comparison. In fungal cells,
  the fatty acid in the phytoceramide species can be hydroxylated (in gray) in position
  2 (dotted line). Bracket's numbers represent the length of the sphingosine backbone
  and fatty acids. PI, phosphatidylinositol; DAG, diacylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine.
