caption: Type I interferons (IFN-I)-initiated signaling pathway leading to interferon-stimulated
  gene (ISG) expression. Cellular actions triggered by IFN-I [Janus kinase (JAK)/signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway] are indicated in purple
  (in italic) with arrows. Cellular organelle and the cellular molecules related to
  JAK/STAT pathway are indicated in green and purple, respectively. The detail of
  each step is described in the main text. “P” with yellow circle indicates phosphorylation.
