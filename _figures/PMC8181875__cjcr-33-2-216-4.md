caption: Mechanisms of novel strategies targeting signaling pathway and mitochondrial
  abnormalities under hypoxia condition. (1) Under hypoxia, MTA1 increased the expression
  of HIF-α and VEGF proteins; (2) EGFR/ERK/HIF-1α can be activated by hypoxic conditions.
  PHD3 can degrade HIF-1α in the hypoxic microenvironment of PC; (3) Hypoxia induced
  STK33 expression in PC cells. HIF-1α regulated STK33 via direct binding to a hypoxia
  response element in its promoter; (4) HIF-1α directly increased the expression of
  PAFAH1B2 by binding to an HRE on PAFAH1B2 promoter in PC cells; (5) PGC-1α activates
  NRF-1 and then up-regulates TFAM expression. HMGB1 can up-regulate the protein expression
  of PGC-1α, and then activate AMPK. AMPK can regulate mitochondrial biogenesis by
  increasing SIRT1 and inducing PGC-1 deacetylation; (6) SIRT4 is a downstream target
  of Ubiquitin like with plant homeodomain and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1) and negatively
  correlated with UHRF1, which can suppress HIF-1α; (7) PSK can not only inhibit SMO
  but also reduce mastermind-like 3 and recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin-kappa-J
  region (RBPJ) expression in PC cells under hypoxia. Hh signaling can be activated
  by increasing the transcription of SMO gene under hypoxia. Another mechanism is
  that RBPJ forms a complex with the NICD that is stabilized by MAML3, and Notch signaling
  is activated by binding of the RBPJ/NICD/MAML3 complex to DNA in the nucleus. Hes1-3,
  a target gene of Notch signaling, can be decreased by RBPJ and MAML3 inhibition.
  RBPJ and MAML3 inhibition under hypoxia led to decreased SMO. MTA1, metastasis-associated
  gene 1; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor;
  EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PC, pancreatic cancer; STK 33, serine/threonine
  kinase 33; PAFAH1B2, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase IB subunit beta;
  NRF, nuclear respiratory factor; TFAM, mitochondrial transcription factor A; HMGB1,
  High-mobility group box-1; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; SMO, smoothened;
  Hh, Hedgehog; MAML3, mastermind-like 3.
