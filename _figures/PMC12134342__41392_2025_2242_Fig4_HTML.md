caption: 'Tumor-associated neutrophil tumoricidal mechanisms. TANs exert antitumor
  effects through mechanisms such as direct cytotoxicity, antibody-opsonized killing,
  and inhibition of tumor metastasis. a Direct cytotoxicity. TANs directly kill tumor
  cells by releasing NE, NO, and H2O2 or forming NETs to produce MPO and defensins.
  The HGF/MET pathway can induce the production of iNOS and NO in TANs. H2O2 can activate
  TRPM2, leading to Ca2+ influx to kill tumor cells. TRPM2 also enhances the expression
  of CXCL2, promoting additional TAN recruitment. Moreover, the Fas/Fas-L interaction
  is implicated in the promotion of cytotoxic mechanisms. b Antibody-opsonized killing.
  Fc receptors on the surface of TANs interact with the Fc domains of antibodies bound
  to cancer cells, mediating ADCC. Mac-1 enhances FcγR-mediated trogocytosis, which
  is inhibited by the CD47-SIRPα axis and Siglec-9/7/5/14-sialic acid interactions.
  Therefore, using antibodies or blocking the CD47-SIRPα axis to promote TAN ADCC
  against tumors is another therapeutic approach. Trogocytosis mediates the removal
  of the target antigen CD20 from tumor cells. Enhancing the trogocytosis function
  of TANs against tumors and suppressing resistance are currently therapeutic avenues.
  c Inhibition of tumor metastasis. CG and NE produced by TANs can inhibit the migration
  of tumor cells. (Abbreviations: CG cathepsin G, iNOS inducible nitric oxide synthase,
  Mac-1 macrophage-1 antigen, RAGE receptor for advanced glycation end products, HGF
  hepatocyte growth factor.)'
