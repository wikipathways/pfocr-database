caption: Mn deregulates Gln and Glu transporters expression and function by PKC pathway
  activation. Glu released from synaptic terminals is taken up by surrounding astrocytes
  via Glu transporters and converted to Gln via the reaction mediated by GS. A proportion
  of Gln is released into the extracellular space by Gln carriers, with a predominant
  role of system N. In addition to system N, release of Gln from astrocytes is mediated
  by transporters belonging to systems L and ASC. Extracellular Gln is taken up into
  GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons by the unidirectional system A transporters.
  Once in neurons, Gln serves as a substrate for the mitochondrial enzyme, PAG for
  the synthesis of Glu, which supply neurotransmission pool of Glu, or can be converted
  to GABA by GAD or to αKG by GDH. Excessive levels of Mn deregulates processes related
  to the Gln and Glu transporter expression and function by PKC pathway activation.
