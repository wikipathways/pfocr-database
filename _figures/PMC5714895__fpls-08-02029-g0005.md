caption: Schematic diagram of regulation of inositol pathway in low phytic acid soybean
  mutants. Black arrows represent the flow of myo-inositol in multiple pathways in
  non-mutant plants. Red solid arrows with mips1 label represent mutation in the rate-limiting
  first step of inositol pathway, catalyzed by myo-inositol phosphate synthase. Red
  dashed double arrows represent mutation in MRP-type ABC transporters (mrp-l/mrp-n)
  that block the last step in the inositol pathway, which is the movement of phytic
  acid to storage vacuoles. The myo-inositol pathway is blocked in single mutant (mips1
  or 1mlpa) at the first step, and in triple mutant (mips1/mrp-l/mrp-n) at both first
  and last steps. Blue triangles represent predicted positive regulation in non-mutants.
  Red triangles represent predicted gene regulations in both single and triple mutants.
  For example, a bZIP transcription factor (Glyma.02G131700) is homologous to the
  well-known ABF1, and is involved in ABA signaling. This transcription factor is
  predicted to positively regulate raffinose synthase in non-mutant genotypes. A DOF
  transcription factor (Glyma.17G101000) is predicted to regulate inositol phosphatase
  in mutants. This enzyme is involved in breakdown of inositol pathway intermediates
  to form myo-inositol. A MYB transcription factor (Glyma.13G309200) is predicted
  to regulate myo-inositol transporter in mutants.
