caption: Innate and adaptive immune response are both involved in the pathogenesis
  of fungal keratitis(FK) (16). Corneal cells specifically recognize fungal-associated
  patterns associated with molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs) molecules by pattern recognition receivers (PRRs) (17, 18). Dendritic
  cells(DCs) can drive naïve CD4+ T cell proliferation, leading to inflammatory responses
  by activating signaling pathways. T helper cells, monocytes, macrophages, and mast
  cells play key roles in FK. Activation of signal transduction molecules promotes
  the expression of cytokines, chemokines, and rmatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (22,
  24). The fungus stimulates the production of oxidative stress-related markers in
  corneal cells. Inhibition of oxidative stress damage will be an effective way to
  alleviate corneal damage in fungal infections (52)
