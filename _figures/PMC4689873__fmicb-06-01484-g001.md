caption: 'Metabolic scheme for engineering Synechocystis strains. D-xylose enters
  the transformant strains by means of native and heterologous transporters. Direction
  of entry of sugars, water, inorganic carbon (CO2), and light into the cell is shown
  as dotted arrows. D-xylose is converted to D-xylulose by D-xylose isomerase (XylA)
  in the presence of manganese ions (Mn+2). D-xylulose is further converted to D-xylulose
  5-phosphate by the action of D-xylulokinase (XylB) in the presence of magnesium
  ions (Mg+2). D-xylulose 5-phosphate then enters the PPP. Bidirectional arrows indicate
  a reversible reaction or ability of an intermediate to enter and exit a pathway.
  Unidirectional arrows indicate a non-reversible reaction or the ability of an intermediate
  to either enter or exit a pathway. Dashed arrows indicate the involvement of one
  or more intermediates. Other abbreviations: CBB cycle, Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate;
  Gly-3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; D-fru-6P, D-fructose 6-phosphate; D-glu-6P,
  D-glucose 6-phosphate; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
