caption: Pathway analysis of GSEA-defined classifying genes. The 258 genes used for
  model building were mapped to KEGG pathways and GO biological processes, and the
  network created from these functional groups was then viewed. The network is color
  coded by the KEGG and GO terms and the TNBC subtype associated with the genes are
  designated by the shape of the network nodes
