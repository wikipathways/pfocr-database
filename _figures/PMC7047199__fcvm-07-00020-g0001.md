caption: Schematic of radiation-induced effects on pathways related to mitochondria
  in cardiac cells. Radiation therapy (RT) directly modifies mitochondrial DNA, as
  seen most notably with the common deletion mutation. RT also indirectly modifies
  mitochondrial dysfunction by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading
  to a disruption in the electron transport chain and increased levels of 4-HNE and
  increased production of antioxidant enzymes via Nrf2. Manganese superoxide dismutase
  (MnSOD) decreases ROS concentrations by converting superoxide () to hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2). RT decreases fatty acid energy production via activation of ERK/MAP kinase
  pathway, which inhibits PPAR-α. RT causes activation of Bax and release of cytochrome
  c, initiating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.
