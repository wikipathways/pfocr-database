caption: The metabolic pathways for a metabolism of glucose via the classical hexosamine
  pathway has a rate-limiting step at phosphofructose kinase (PFK1) that is inhibited
  by ATP, low pH and citrate. However, the conversion of glucose to fructose and fructose
  to fructose-1-PO4 by ketohexokinase allows for an uninhibited pathway for generation
  of substrates for all major metabolic pathways required for growth and development
  of the conceptus. Please see the list of abbreviations for each of enzymes noted
  in this figure [6, 59, 61]
