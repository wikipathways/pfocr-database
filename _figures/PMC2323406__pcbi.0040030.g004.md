caption: 'This schematic shows the major steps in EGFR signaling. At the top of the
  pathway ligand binds to the receptor and induces receptor dimerization and activation.
  The signal is then transduced through a series of adaptor proteins SHC, GRB2, and
  SOS, which in turn activates the MAPK cascade RAF, MEK and ERK. There are two negative
  feedback loops: internalization and degradation of the receptor complex, and ERK
  deactivation of SOS.'
