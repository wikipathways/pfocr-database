caption: The Proteolysis of Slit and Robo. (A) The slit protein has a conserved proteolysis
  site between the fifth and sixth EGF repeats and is cleaved by an unknown protease
  to grow the N-terminal fragment (Slit-N) and short C-terminal piece (Slit-C). They
  can bind to different receptors to perform various functions. (B) The binding of
  the Slit protein fixed to the extracellular matrix to the Robo on the cell membrane
  results in the exposure of the cleavage site of metalloproteinases in the area adjacent
  to the membrane of Robo protein. Under the action of Kuzbanian in Drosophila (ADAM10
  in mammals), the Robo protein is cleaved, and its extracellular domain falls away.
  In human cancer cells, the lagged residues of the extracellular domain of Robo are
  further cleaved by γ secretase, and the resulting C-terminal fragments can then
  be transferred to the nucleus.
