caption: 'Transforming growth factor β and bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway
  and Drosha. Ligands of the TGFb superfamily, including TGFβs and BMPs, bind to multisubunit
  complexes of type I, type II, and type III receptors. After the type III receptors
  attract them to the cell membrane, two pairs of type I and type II receptors form
  a heterotetrameric complex with the ligands, initiating intracellular signaling.
  The serine/threonine kinase domain of the type I receptor phosphorylates receptor-regulated
  Smad (R-Smad) proteins, which bind Smad4, translocate to the nucleus, and regulate
  gene expression by two alternative mechanisms: modulating transcription of target
  genes via binding to a consensus sequence known as Smad-binding element (SBE), or
  facilitating microRNA processing by Drosha and increasing the production of selected
  microRNAs.'
