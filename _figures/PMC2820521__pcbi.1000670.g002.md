caption: The red and blue arrows indicate activation and inhibition, respectively.
  Detailed information on the regulatory pathways is provided in the  section, and
  the rough sketch of the signal flow is as follows. Glutamate binds to its corresponding
  receptors and increases intracellular calcium. D1R binding to dopamine increases
  cAMP. Calcium and cAMP alter the number of AMPA membrane receptors via downstream
  cascades and, thereby, regulate the synaptic efficacy of the neuron. The bi-directional
  effect of calcium on  receptor should be mentioned. The activation level (open probability)
  of  receptor displays a bell-shaped response curve to intracellular calcium concentrations.
  The  receptor activation level is maximal when intracellular calcium concentration
  is approximately  . However, more (and less) calcium reduces  receptor activation.
  To represent this regulation, two complementary arrows represent activation and
  inhibition from calcium to  receptor in this diagram. In addition, one arrow originates
  from Ser137 and terminates at an arrow from PP2B to Thr34. Phosphorylation of Ser137
  decreases the rate of Thr34 dephosphorylation by PP2B. Therefore, Ser137 contributes
  to disinhibition of the PP2B-Thr34 pathway . The arrow from Ser137 represents this
  effect.
