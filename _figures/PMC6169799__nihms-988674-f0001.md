caption: Melaninsynthesispathwayscomparedinvertebratesand insects. (A) The generalized
  vertebrate melanin synthesis pathway emphasizing the early steps in which tyrosinase
  successively converts L-tyrosine to L-DOPA and DOPAquinone and subsequent reactions
  produce eumelanin. (B) A simplified insect melanin synthesis pathway in which TH
  converts L-tyrosine to L-DOPA and two subsequent branches in which PO is involved
  in the conversion of L-DOPA to produce DOPA-melanin and DDC is involved in the conversion
  of L-DOPA to dopamine to produce dopamine-melanin, both through a series of reactions.
  Enzymes are shown in blue. Enzyme inhibitors are shown in red. Red Xs illustrate
  the defective steps in the cavefish and planthopper pathways. Abbreviations are
  explained in the text. Multiple arrows are not representative of the number of steps
  in the pathways. The consensus insect melanin synthesis pathway (B) is drawn according
  to .
