caption: The role of NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 in disease models. NO, generated by NO-synthases
  (NOS), activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by binding to its reduced (Fe2+)
  heme moiety leading to the formation of cGMP from GTP. cGMP mediates protective
  effects, e.g. vasodilation and anti-inflammation. This signaling pathway is most
  likely disturbed by NOX1-derived superoxide (O2−) as shown in Angiotensin II-induced
  hypertension and spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR). Superoxide can either directly
  interact with NO to form peroxynitrite or oxidize the essential NOS cofactor tetrahydrobioapterin
  (BH4) and thus uncouple NOS. Uncoupled NOS forms superoxide itself (not shown).
  Further, superoxide can oxidize the Fe2+ heme of sGC. Thereby, sGC becomes insensitive
  to NO. These mechanisms most likely account, at least in part, for the acute effects
  of increased NOX1 activity mediating endothelial dysfunction and the chronic effects
  that are discussed to cause hypertension. NOX2-derived superoxide is a major signaling
  molecule in innate immunity mediating host defense. NOX4 is unlikely to directly
  interfere with the NO/cGMP-signaling pathway as it releases hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
  and not superoxide. However, in high concentrations, H2O2 causes acute cytotoxicity.
  This mechanism is suggested to be involved in NOX4-mediated effects after acute
  ischemic stroke, acute effects of pressure overload in heart, and bleomycin-induced
  cytotoxicity. The lower chronic activity of NOX4 seems to be involved in angiogenesis
  and wound healing, and thus rather protective
