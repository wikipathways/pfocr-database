caption: 'Positive feedback loops in apoptosis. (A) Caspases, kinases, and Bcl-2 family
  members are functionally linked in positive feedback loops to induce cell death.
  (1) Cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, a meeting point in the cell death
  pathways, induces caspase activation. Caspase-9 and subsequent caspase-3 activation
  produces Bcl-2 proteolysis, which in turn promotes more cytochrome c release [].
  (2) Caspase-3 induces proteolysis and constitutive activation of MEKK1 (MAPK/ERK
  kinase kinase 1), that promotes cytochrome c release and caspase-9/-3 activation
  though JNK/p38 activation [,,]. (3 and 4) Caspase-3 [,] or caspase-8 [] induce Bid
  proteolysis (tBid), which in turn promotes cytochrome c release and caspase activation.
  (5) Caspase-3 is activated by caspase-9, which in turn can induce proteolysis and
  full activation of caspase-9 [,]. (B) ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation and
  ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) activation are sustained by multiple
  positive feedback loops. (1) NADPH oxidase generates ROS and activates ASK1 and
  JNK, which in turn activates NADPH oxidase [,]. (2 and 3) JNK and/or p38 activation,
  induced by ROS, produces p53 activation, which in turn induces ROS generation [,].
  (4) Sustained activation of p38 increases ROS production, which in turn activates
  ASK1 and p38 [,]. (5) ASK1 activation induces the accumulation of Daxx protein,
  which in turn further activates ASK1 []. (6) ASK1 induces transcription of cyclin
  D1 through AP-1 (activator protein 1) activation, which in turn increases ASK1 levels
  via the Rb-E2F (retinoblastoma-E2F transcription factor) pathway []. (7) Ceramide
  activates the ASK1 and JNK signaling pathway, which in turn activates neutral sphingomyelinase
  (nSMase), thus increasing ceramide production [,]. The loops represented in the
  figure do not necessarily take place in the same cell and at the same time. Some
  loops are activated by a specific stimulus or in a certain cell type. Symbols used:
  activation (), inhibition (―•).'
