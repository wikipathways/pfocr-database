caption: 'Proposed mechanism for AHAS modification of ThDP. Our kinetic, structural,
  and MS data suggest that, upon herbicide binding, ThDP is primarily altered into
  two analogs: ThThDP or ThAthDP. Turnover conditions and molecular oxygen [which
  binds AHAS nearby ThDP ()] are required for this to occur (, ), implying that the
  presence of the hydroxyethyl (He) ThDP intermediate in the active site is required
  for either herbicide binding and/or the generation of peracetate, a product of the
  oxygenase activity of AHAS (). From these results, the following mechanism has been
  developed. In pathway a, free peracetate or molecular oxygen (, ) (both trapped
  in the active site by the herbicide) () react with the C2 carbene of ThDP, producing
  ThThDP. The thiazolone ring is then hydrolyzed by hydroxide and ring-opened, leading
  to intermediate thiamine ethenethiolcarbamate diphosphate (ThEthCDP), which undergoes
  decarboxylation of the carbamic acid group to give ThAthDP (). Alternatively, in
  pathway b, ThAthDP is produced by a parallel mechanism that involves direct nucleophilic
  ring opening of the thiazolium ring of ThDP, producing formamidoethenethiol diphosphate
  (ThFAthDP) (, ). Hydroxide then induces cleavage of the N–CHO bond to give ThAthDP
  (). The ThDP related molecules depicted in blue have been observed in the crystal
  structures of AHAS in complex with the herbicide, except for intact ThDP, which
  is observed in the crystal structure of uninhibited CaAHAS.'
