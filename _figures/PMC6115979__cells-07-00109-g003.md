caption: TRPM7 kinase in T cell signalling and transcriptional regulation. Upon binding
  of tumour growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), the TGF-β receptor complex (TGFβRI/II) initiates
  the phosphorylation of the c-terminal SXS-motif of SMAD2. Results gained from TRPM7
  kinase deficient murine T cells suggest an additional mechanism by which the TRPM7
  kinase phosphorylates SMAD2 directly, once it is anchored to the plasma membrane.
  Phosphorylated SMAD2 interacts with SMAD4 and promotes the transcription of Itgae,
  Il-17 and Rorc genes. The interleukin 6 (IL-6) dependent STAT3 as well as Erk1/2
  phosphorylation pathway is unaltered in TRPM7 kinase deficient murine T cells.
