caption: 'The hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis: pulsatile hypothalamic secretion
  of GnRH into the hypophyseal-portal circulation drives pituitary gonadotropin (LH
  and FSH) secretion. Circulating LH and FSH in turn regulate ovarian sex steroid
  production and trigger ovulation. Upstream of GnRH, the kisspeptin-neurokinin B-dynorphin
  (KNDy) neurons from the ARC nucleus project to the GnRH terminals to coordinately
  regulate the pulsatile release of GnRH while kisspeptin neurons from the AVPV project
  to GnRH somas and orchestrate the pre-ovulatory LH surge in females (). The metabolic/energy
  sensors including mTOR, AMPK, SIRT, and leptin act either directly or indirectly
  on the ARC KNDy neurons, regulating GnRH neurosecretory activity based on the energy/nutrition
  status (). Heras et al. implicate a novel central/ceramide pathway from the PVN
  that causes PP via ovarian sympathetic activation. In the periphery, excess adiposity
  increases production of aromatase from adipose tissue, induces insulin resistance,
  and lowers SHBG levels, leading to increased bioavailability of E2 to initiate premature
  thelarche (breast development) (). Other unknown factors that may affect the pubertal
  timing via any of the pathways described above include ED chemicals and social-economic
  status. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ARC, arcuate; AVPV, anteroventral periventricular;
