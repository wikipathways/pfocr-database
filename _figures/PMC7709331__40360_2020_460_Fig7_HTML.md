caption: 'NO/cGMP pathway in cardiomyocytes. NO in the body is produced from L-arginine
  as a raw material, which is transported into the cell via the cell membrane arginine
  transporter, and is produced under the action of NOS. The production of NO then
  activates soluble guanylate cyclase and catalyses the formation of cGMP. The formed
  cGMP activates PKG. Phosphodiesterase 5 is responsible for the decomposition of
  cGMP produced by soluble guanylate cyclase, while Phosphodiesterase 9 is responsible
  for the decomposition of cGMP produced by pGC. The drug stimulates the production
  of a second messenger cAMP via a Gs-coupled β-adrenergic receptor. cAMP activates
  PKA, and PKA thenactivates K + channels also increases hyperpolarization, thus indirectly
  preventing extracellular Ca2 + influx and promoting vasodilation. Abbreviations:
  cGMP:Cyclic guanosine monophosphate; eNOS: Endothelial nitric oxide synthase; NOS:
  Nitric oxide synthase; PKA: cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKG: cGMP-dependent protein
