caption: Glucan synthase (GS), comprised of catalytic subunit Fks1 (or Fks2) and its
  activator Rho1, is responsible for synthesis of the principal cell wall component
  β-1,3-glucan. It is the target of inhibition for echinocandin drugs. The GTP binding
  protein Rho1 plays a central role in cell wall biosynthesis and regulation through
  a direct activation of GS. It also mediates a wide range of cellular responses through
  Pkc1 and the protein kinase C (PKC) cell integrity pathway, as well as through the
  secretary (Sec3) pathway. External stimuli, including cell wall stress due to echinocandin
  action, are mediated in part through receptors Wsc1 and Mid2, which interact with
  Rho1 leading to a range of secondary interactions. The responses include activation
  of the PKC cell integrity pathway and Slt2, as well as modulation of chitin synthase
  genes Chs1/2/3/8. Feedback of the cell integrity pathway to cell wall biosynthesis
  and modeling also involves transcription factor Rlm1, which regulates genes encoding
  enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis. Ca2+-calcineurin indirectly affects
  Fks1 through Crz1. Overall, these complex pathways allow the cells to adapt to echinocandin
  action and the ensuing cell wall stress via compensatory cell wall biosynthesis
  and remodelling. (Schematic adapted from ; ; .)
