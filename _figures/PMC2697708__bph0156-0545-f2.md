caption: Spatial distribution and functions of calcium-activated potassium channels
  in the vascular wall. SKCa (SK3) and IKCa (IK1) are preferentially expressed in
  ECs. SKCa are preferentially located in caveolin-rich domains, at sites of homocellular
  endothelial gap junctions. A global increase in endothelial [Ca2+]i preferentially
  activates SKCa and an EDHF-mediated response involving a Cx-dependent pathway ().
  IKCa are preferentially localized at the sites of endothelial projections towards
  the underlying smooth muscle cells. Co-localized sarcoplasmic reticulum elements
  and associated local calcium release (calcium pulsar) regulate IK1 activation and
  vascular tone via potassium efflux and subsequent activation of smooth muscle Na+/K+-ATPase
  (). The activation of these two channels also favours calcium entry, amplifying
  NO production (). When BKCa channels are expressed in the ECs they can also contribute
  to this latter mechanism (). BKCa are preferentially expressed in smooth muscle
  cells and are often clustered in large groups. They are activated by calcium sparks
  or following a global increase in smooth muscle [Ca2+]i. They generate STOCs, leading
  to arterial smooth muscle hyperpolarization and relaxation (). IKCa are expressed
  in VSMCs undergoing de-differentiation and are involved in their proliferation ().
