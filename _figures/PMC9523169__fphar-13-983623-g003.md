caption: Dysfunction of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy induced ferroptosis in AD. NCOA4
  can release free iron by the autophagic degradation of ferritin. When cellular iron
  is overloaded, the binding of NCOA4 and HERC2 is enhanced. HERC2 mediates the degradation
  of NCOA4 in an ubiquitin-dependent manner, thereby suppressing the binding of NCOA4
  and ferritin and inhibiting the release of iron and ferritin degradation by ferritinophagy.
  When cellular iron is insufficient, ferritin-containing iron combines with NCOA4
  to form a complex through FTH1 subunit of ferritin, which mediates iron release
  from ferritin storage through the ferritinophagy pathway. However, the excessive
  Fe2+ content in cells transforms Fe2+ into Fe3+ through the Fenton reaction to generate
  ROS, which causes lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress and ultimately leads to
  ferroptosis.
