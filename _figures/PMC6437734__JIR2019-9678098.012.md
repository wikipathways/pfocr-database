caption: VPA promotes the generation of Treg cells. Naïve T lymphocytes that are treated
  with VPA differentiate into Treg cells due to epigenetic modifications (H4 histone
  acetylation) that allow the entry of the transcription factors Ets-1, Ets-2, and
  PU.1 into the promotor region of Foxp3, which induces its transcription and translation.
  VPA also increases the expression of miRNA-21, miRNA-18c, and miRNA-327, as well
  as of CD25, which are characteristic of Treg lymphocytes. However, it also induces
  the exhaustion molecule CTLA-4. Interestingly, VPA-induced Treg cells can block
  the proliferation of PBMC and T effector lymphocytes. Green arrows indicate the
  processes, molecules, or mediators in the signaling pathway that are augmented and/or
  promoted by VPA. Red arrows indicate processes, molecules, or mediators in the signaling
  pathway that are inhibited by VPA.
