caption: Gut microbiota modulation in cancer metabolic reprogramming. A Glycometabolism.
  Lactic acid increases the expression of PD-L1 of neutrophils, suppressing T cell
  activities; Butyrate acts as HDACi, promoting apoptosis in tumor cells. Butyrate
  also facilitates the dephosphorylation and tetramerization of dimeric PKM2, a process
  that inhibits the Warburg metabolism of tumor cells. B Lipid metabolism. SCFAs increase
  IgA antibody in the intestinal mucosa and inhibit the PI3 K-Akt signaling pathway.
  They also bind to the FFAR2 receptor, increasing E-cadherin expressions. But the
  excessive accumulation of SCFAs promotes the transformation of immunosuppressive
  cells; DCA promotes the translocation of RelA (p65) to the nucleus,activating the
  NF-κB signaling pathway. UDCA restricts the activity of DCA, reducing the production
  of inflammatory factors. DCA also works with lipoteichoic acid, inhibiting COX-2
  production. C Protein metabolism. Tumor cells and immune cells compete for amino
  acids.The expression of the glutamine receptor increases in cancer cells, helping
  them to absorb more amino acids. Gut microbiota produces hydrolase enzymes, which
  disrupts the epithelial barrier. D ROS production. ROS cause genetic mutations,
  DNA breaks, and chromosomal instability. MCT1, monocarboxylate transporter1; HDACi,histone
  deacetylase inhibitor; PKM2, pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2; SCFAs, short-chain
  fatty acids; FFAR2, free fatty acid receptor 2; TAM, tumor-associated macrophage;
