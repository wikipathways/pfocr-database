caption: A demonstration of MEHHs’ phenolic acids regulating pathways in glucose metabolism.
  The arrow (→) indicates enhancement, while the barred line (┤) signifies inhibition.
  Glucose metabolism encompasses the synthesis, cleavage, transport, and storage of
  glucose in living organisms, involving critical pathways such as glycolysis, the
  tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the processes of glycogen synthesis and breakdown,
  along with gluconeogenesis. MEHHs’ phenolic acids facilitate glucose uptake, inhibit
  gluconeogenesis, and enhance glycogen synthesis by increasing the expression or
  translocation of glucose transporters GLUT4 and GLUT2, thereby balancing blood glucose
  levels
