caption: 'Schematic representation of the putative evolution of the apicoplast and
  its metabolism. The ancestor of apicomplexans arose from the endosymbiotic merger
  of a protist host and a single celled red alga. The host likely benefited from the
  symbiont''s ability to photosynthesize. Initially there were two redundant isoprenoid
  synthesis pathways: a cytoplasmic pathway (likely using the mevalonate pathway as
  ciliates still do ) and a plastid DOXP pathway. Note that both pathways have multiple
  enzymatic steps and are shown highly simplified here. The cytoplasmic pathway was
  lost producing dependency. This forced maintenance of the apicoplast even after
  loss of photosynthesis (lower panel). High concentrations of exogenously supplied
  IPP can overcome this dependency and thus rescue clindamycin induced loss of the
  organelle  (clindamycin specifically blocks apicoplast protein synthesis). Fos,
  fosmidomycin; N, nucleus; P, plastid; Statin, the active principle of the cholesterol-lowering
  drug Lipitor).'
