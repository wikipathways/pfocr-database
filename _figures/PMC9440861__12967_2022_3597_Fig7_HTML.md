caption: Schematic of the source and functional role of lumican in the early course
  of ARDS. TNF-α is a proinflammatory cytokine that is produced in the early phase
  of ARDS and induces the production of lumican in lung fibroblasts. Lumican then
  modulates fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) via the ERK/Slug signaling pathway, resulting in early profibrotic responses
  in ARDS. ALI acute lung injury, ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, EMT epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition, IL interleukin, TNF-α tumour necrosis factor-alpha
