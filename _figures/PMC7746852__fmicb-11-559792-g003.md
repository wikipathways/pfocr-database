caption: 'Insights into the counteraction of host defense by viral protease and Vpu.
  (A) Inhibition of antiviral signaling by viral protease: The host RIG-I senses viral
  ssRNA to promote the antiviral signaling through MAVS and activates the IκB kinases
  (IKKs). The IKKε phosphorylates IRF3, which then translocates into the nucleus to
  trigger the IFN-I production. On the other hand, IKK-α/β phosphorylates and degrades
  IκB, reliving NF-κB to go into the nucleus for transcription of proinflammatory
  cytokine genes. The viral protease (PR) promotes the degradtaion of RIG-I in the
  cytosol. (B) Suppression of peroxisome biogenesis by Vpu: in the absence of HIV-1
  infection, the adapter protein βTrCP binds to β-catenin and promotes its degradation
  via ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway. Upon HIV-1 infection, the Vpu stabilizes
  the β-catenin by sequestering βTrCP. Subsequently, β-catenin enters into the nucleus
  and activates the transcription factor TCF-4, which is required to drive the expression
  of indicated microRNAs. These microRNAs were found to regulate the expression of
  peroxisome biogenesis factors for peroxisome synthesis. However, the peroxisomal
  MAVS triggers the rapid induction of type III IFNs downstream ISGs that acts as
  antiviral factors. The direct/indirect counteraction of peroxisomal MAVS signaling
  by HIV-1 remains to be elucidated.'
