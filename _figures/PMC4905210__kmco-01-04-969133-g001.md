caption: Targeting the mevalonate pathway using statins and its feedback loop using
  dipyridamole induces tumor cell apoptosis. (A) The mevalonate (MVA) pathway produces
  many critical cellular end products that are essential for cell proliferation and
  survival, including cholesterol, production of which is regulated by HMGCR, the
  rate limiting enzyme of the MVA pathway. The presence of cholesterol ensures that
  the transcription factor SREBP2 is maintained in the cytoplasm anchored to the endoplasmic
  reticulum. (B) Upon statin-mediated HMGCR inhibition (1), depletion of cholesterol
  and other sterol intermediates causes translocation of SREBP2 into the nucleus (2),
  and the ensuing transcription of sterol-responsive genes including HMGCR, HMGCS1,
  and LDLR, thereby blunting the anticancer efficacy of statins in tumor cells (3).
  When co-administered with statins, dipyridamole inhibits the feedback loop by preventing
  SREBP2 cleavage and thereby augmenting statin-induced apoptosis. MVA, mevalonate;
  HMGCR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; HMGCS1, HMG-CoA synthase
  1; SREBP2, sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2; FPP, farnesyl
  pyrophosphate; GGPP, geranaylgeranyl pyrophosphate; LDLr, low-density lipoprotein
  receptor.
