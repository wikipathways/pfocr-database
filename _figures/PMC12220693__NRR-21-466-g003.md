caption: 'Effects of kynurenine metabolism on ischemic stroke.This summary diagram
  illustrates the IS-promoting and IS-inhibiting effects of metabolites in the Kyn
  and 5-HT pathways. The products of the Kyn metabolic pathway exert their effects
  through inflammation, excitatory toxicity related to glutamate receptors, nicotinamide
  receptors, and oxidative stress. In the 5-HT metabolic pathway, the activity of
  the main rate-limiting enzyme TPH affects calcium-dependent kinases and CREB, which
  may play a role. 5-HT exerts a positive effect on IS by acting on the 5-HT receptors,
  and melatonin has a positive impact on IS from the perspective of regulating immune
  inflammation and oxidative stress. Created with BioRender.com. 3-HK: 3-Hydroxykynurenine;
