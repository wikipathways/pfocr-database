caption: The dual roles of AIF in cell death and in vital mitochondrial functions.
  (A) In AIF-dependent cell death, AIF is released from the mitochondria, translocates
  to the cytosol (step 1) and binds to protein partners and parthanatos-associated
  PAR induced by PARP-1 overactivation (step 2), which facilitates its nuclear entry
  (step 3). Once inside the nucleus, AIF works with endonucleases and mediates DNA
  degradation (step 4). (B) On the contrary, pro-survival roles of AIF rely on its
  interaction with CHCHD4 and involvement in the CHCHD4-dependent mitochondrial import
  pathway of nuclear-encoded cysteine-rich substrates. Thus, AIF contributes to anterograde
  signaling pathway from the nucleus to mitochondria. Here, particularly illustrated
  in the figure is the correct folding and retention of NDUFS5, a subunit of complex
  I in the mETC. Other mitochondrial activities relevant to AIF/CHCHD4 interaction
  are mentioned by text. mETC, mitochondrial electron transport chain; PAR, Poly(ADP-Ribose);
  Hsp70, Heat-shock protein 70; CypA, Cyclophilin A; PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1;
  MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane;
  IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane. The figure was adapted from Reinhardt et al.
