caption: Extrinsic and intrinsic cell death signaling pathways. The majority of proteolytic
  cleavage events that manifest the apoptotic phenotype are mediated by ‘effector’
  caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7, which become fully activated when the
  large and small subunits that are harbored within the dormant proenzyme are liberated
  after endoproteolysis by upstream ‘initiator’ caspases, such as caspase-8 and caspase-9.
  The initiator caspases themselves are activated by autoproteolytic activation after
  facilitated oligomerization. In the extrinsic pathway, this occurs as a consequence
  of ligand binding to ‘death receptor’ complexes, which leads to the recruitment
  of procaspase-8 via the adapter molecule FADD/Mort1. This pathway is modulated by
  the availability of the molecular components (putative type I and type II cells
  differ in this regard) and dominant-negative regulators such as decoy receptors
  and cFLIP/usurpin. For the majority of cell death stimuli, the intrinsic death signal
  is communicated through the mitochondrion by an unknown mechanism, which leads to
  several changes in the organelle, including the release of polypeptidic agents dangereux,
  such as cytochrome c and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC)/Diablo.
  This pathway is highly dependent on the stoichiometry of anti- versus proapoptotic
  Bcl-2 family members. When enabled, caspase-9 activation occurs at the hands of
  the oligomerization mediator APAF-1, which requires cytochrome c for the appropriate
  conformation. SMAC/Diablo helps to cross another apoptosis checkpoint by sequestering
  inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAPs), which would otherwise block the actions
  of downstream effector caspases even in the presence of proteolytic maturation.
  Controversy surrounds the degree to which cross-talk occurs between the extrinsic
  and intrinsic pathways in vivo. At a molecular level, this appears to occur via
  the proteolysis of BID, which normally serves an antiapoptotic role within the intrinsic
  pathway until it is truncated (to tBID) by caspase-8 (derived from the extrinsic
  pathway), whereupon it promotes activation of the intrinsic pathway. In principle,
  signals from the extrinsic pathway may require the assistance of the intrinsic pathway,
  for example, when the signal strength is weak or when the IAP barrier is high and
  the actions of SMAC/Diablo become necessary.
