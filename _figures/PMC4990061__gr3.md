caption: Model depicting proangiogenic lactate signaling in cancer. In the model,
  glycolytic cancer cells, depicted on the left, import glucose via glucose transporters
  (GLUT) and then sequentially convert glucose to pyruvate and ATP using glycolysis,
  and pyruvate to lactate using lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Lactate is exported
  together with protons via MCT4. MCT1 is expressed in endothelial cells and in oxidative
  cancer cells, depicted on the left, and catalyzes the uptake of lactate together
  with protons. In these cells, lactate is oxidized to pyruvate by LDHB, producing
  NADH as a byproduct. Pyruvate inhibits prolylhydroxylases (PHDs). In endothelial
  cells, PHD inhibition stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) subunit α, triggering
  HIF-1 activation and the transcriptional upregulation of vascular endothelial growth
  factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). HIF-1 also indirectly increases bFGF, which is secreted
  and activates the proangiogenic bFGF receptor (bFGFR). PHD inhibition further stabilizes
  inhibitor of NF-κB kinase β (Iκκβ), an inhibitor of inhibitor of NF-kB α (IκBα).
  NADH aliments NAD(P)H oxidases (Nox) that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  to further inhibit IκBα. Consequently, transcription factor NF-κB is activated and
  upregulates IL-8, which is secreted and activates the proangiogenic IL-8 receptor
  (IL-8R). Oxidative cancer cells share with endothelial cells the lactate-HIF-1 pathway,
  but not the lactate-NF-κB pathway. HIF-1 activation by lactate in these cells transcriptionally
  upregulates VEGF, which upon secretion can activate proangiogenic VEGFR2 in endothelial
  cells. Lactate signaling as a whole can thus trigger angiogenesis independently
  of hypoxia.
