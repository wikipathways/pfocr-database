caption: Schematic model of the pathway leading to CO2 avoidance in C. elegans CO2
  avoidance is mediated by the cGMP signalling pathway molecules TAX-2 and TAX-4 expression
  in the BAG neurons. The avoidance behaviour is also modulated by the neuropeptide
  Y receptor NPR-1, by the neuronal globin domain protein GLB-5, and by the insulin
  and TGF-β starvation pathways.
