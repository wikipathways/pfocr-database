caption: Mechanisms of constitutively high autophagy-lysosome activity in PDAC. The
  MiT/TFE family transcription factors are critical regulators of autophagy-lysosome
  genes. (Left) Under nutrient-rich conditions, MiT/TFE proteins are repressed by
  mTORC1 via phosphorylation and remain in the cytosol. (Middle) Upon starvation,
  mTORC1 is inactivated and MiT/TFE proteins enter the nucleus, where they activate
  autophagy-lysosome gene transcription. (Right) PDAC cells overexpress the nucleocytoplasmic
  transporter, importin (IPO)-7/8, to facilitate the nuclear translocation of MiT/TFE,
  thereby decoupling MiT/TFE from mTORC1-mediated suppression and upregulating autophagy-lysosome
  gene expression. Consequently, PDAC maintains constitutively high basal autophagy/lysosome
  activity under sustained mTORC1 activity, thus simultaneously employing the catabolic
  process mediated by the autophagy/lysosomal pathway and the anabolic process driven
  by mTOR signaling to maximize their proliferation []
