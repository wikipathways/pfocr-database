caption: Mitochondria-associated ER membranes and cell physiology. (A) Lipid synthesis
  and transfer. The MAMs account for PS generation through PSS, and PS synthesized
  in ER is then transferred to mitochondria by ORP5 and ORP8 for further conversion
  to PE. In addition, caveolin-1 inserted into the ER participates in ER-mitochondrial
  cholesterol transfer. (B) Ca2+ transfer and apoptosis. Ca2+ transfer from ER to
  mitochondria is mediated by a protein complex consisting IP3R1 in ER or RYR in SR,
  GRP75, and VDAC1 in OMM, then Ca2+ is transported into mitochondrial matrix via
  MCU. Excessive mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake triggers opening of mPTP to initiate apoptosis.
  Activation of caspase 8 activates downstream caspases and induces NOGO B cleavage,
  which is inhibited by cFLIPL. Some proteins are located on MAM govern the apoptotic
  pathway by preserving intraorganellar Ca2+ transfer, such as PML, BCL-XL, or PTEN.
  (C) Mitochondrial dynamics. The recruitment of main mitochondrial fission protein
  DRP1 to MAM is regulated by Mff, Fis1 and Syntaxin-17. And mitochondrial fusion
  is controlled by MFN2 on OMM and OPA1 on IMM. (D) Autophagy. At rest, Syntaxin-17
  binds to DRP1, but in the absence of nutrients, DRP1 is replaced by pre-autophagosome
  marker ATG14L, which promotes the enrichment of mTORC2 and AKT to initiate the formation
  of autophagosome. The anchor sets formed by VAPB in ER and RMDB3 on OMM regulate
  autophagy by maintaining MAMs. (E) ROS generation and ER stress. Oxidative condition
  induces ser36 phosphorylation of p66Shc, resulting in p66Shc transfer to MAMs and
  produce ROS, which stimulates ER stress via IRE1 and PERK. Sigma-1R located on MAMs
  could stabilize IRE1. (F) Inflammation. Upon stimulation, NLRP3 is transferred from
  ER to MAMs where it interacts with its adaptor ASC and TXNIP to initiate inflammasome
  formation. AKT, serine/threonine kinase; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein;
