caption: Schematic representation of ways of targeting MYC and its transcriptional
  output using specific signaling pathway, BET bromodomain, and complex inhibitors
  in MYC-dependent malignancies. Pathway inhibitors (top) target key proteins important
  for MYC-protein stability and activity. BET bromodomain inhibitors (lower left)
  compete with BRD4 in binding acetylated histone residues and thus halt the initiation
  of MYC transcription and subsequent regulation of MYC target genes. Complex inhibitors
  (lower right) disrupt complex formation and interaction with complex binding sites.
  MYC/MAX heterodimers bind to enhancer regions (E-BOX elements) and stimulate gene
  activation. Interaction of MYC/MAX together with MIZ-1, binding to the initiator
  (INR) region, promotes gene repression []. Disruption of these interactions would
  diminish gene target regulation and hence tumor progression in MYC-dependent malignancies.
