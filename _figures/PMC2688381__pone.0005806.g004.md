caption: 'A: The cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and the fold-changes induced for
  each of the enzymes within the pathway are indicated. Data are expressed as fold
  changes in gene expression values from 24 hr AZT vs. 24 hr PBS (left numbers), 24
  hr SMM vs. 24 hr PBS (center numbers) and 72 hr AZT (+addition of mucosal SMM during
  the last 24 hr) vs. 24 hr PBS (right numbers). Both SMM and AZT increased the enzymes
  involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, and their effect appears to be
  additive. B and C: Ingenuity Pathways Analysis™ was used to generate two top significant
  networks for genes regulated by AZT 24 hr vs. PBS 24 hr. The top two networks are
  shown. The analysis settings were as follows: only direct relationships were considered,
  endogenous chemicals were excluded, and only relationships where data sources = Argonaute
  2 or Ingenuity curated findings were considered. The network depicted in B was labeled
  “Lipid Metabolism, Small Molecule Biochemistry, Nucleic Acid Metabolism” and had
  a score = 47. The network depicted in C was labeled “Cancer, Cell Cycle, Reproductive
  System Disease” and had a score = 44. Red indicates up-regulation. Green indicates
  down-regulation.'
