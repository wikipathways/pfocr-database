caption: Amphiregulin induces an ‘inside‐out’ activation of integrin complexes that
  then lead to the local release of bioactive transforming growth factor (TGF)β. Amphiregulin
  induces a sustained PLCγ‐mediated signal via the epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR). Such a sustained PLCγ‐mediated signalling induces an intracellular rearrangement
  of local actin fibres, and the physical separation of complexed, trans‐membrane
  integrin‐α and integrin‐β subunits, and thus to their extracellular activation.
  Such an ‘inside‐out’ activation of integrin‐α V‐containing complexes can induce
  the local release of bio‐active TGFβ from its latent form, and thus to the local
  activation of the TGFβ signalling pathway. AREG, Amphiregulin.
