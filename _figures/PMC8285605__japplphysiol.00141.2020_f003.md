caption: 'Interactions of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in endothelial cells with three
  primary pathways associated with vascular function: the nitric oxide (NO) pathway,
  oxidative stress, and inflammation. 1: Hsp90 is essential for activation of endothelial
  NO synthase (eNOS) by calcium-calmodulin (Ca2+-CaM) and Akt (also known as protein
  kinase B). 2: Hsp70 upregulates superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Hsp25/27 upregulates
  glutathione peroxidase (GPx), such that the damaging effects of reactive oxygen
  species are attenuated. These damaging effects include a) upregulation of arginase,
  which then decreases available l-arginine for synthesis of NO; b) scavenging of
  NO; and c) scavenging of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and thus uncoupling of eNOS.
  3: Heat stress, most likely via Hsp70, suppresses nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB),
  a master regulator of proinflammatory gene transcription, and its downstream effects
  mediated by proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin
  (IL)-6. Hsp70 also upregulates the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which can suppress
  NF-κB activation. NADPH-Ox, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ONOO-, peroxynitrite; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; ECAM-1, endothelial cell adhesion
  molecule-1.'
