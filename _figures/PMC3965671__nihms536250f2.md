caption: Developmental plasticity in the Th17 pathway. Originally conceived as a pathway
  with a single precursor-effector relationship similar to the Th1 and Th2 pathways,
  recent studies have uncovered substantial developmental flexibility, or plasticity,
  in the Th17 developmental program. It is now apparent from studies in mice that
  Th17 precursor cells (Th17p) derived by differentiation in the presence of IL-6,
  IL-1β and TGFβ can give rise to progeny with many characteristics of classical Th1
  cells (socalled, “Th17/Th1” cells), contingent upon the balance of active TGFβ and
  IL-23 concentrations late in their programming, whereas true Th1 cells can also
  develop under the influence of IL-12 signaling in Th17p cells. It is also apparent
  that mature effectors that produce high levels of IL-22, with little of no IL-17A
  or IL-17F (so-called “Th22” cells), can develop from naïve precursors in the presence
  of IL-6, IL-1β and IL-23, absent TGFβ. At present it is unclear whether Th22 cells
  can develop from Th17p cells (dashed arrow).
