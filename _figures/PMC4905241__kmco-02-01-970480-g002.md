caption: DNA damage-dependent regulation of E2F1. (A) E2F1 is modified following DNA
  damage resulting in cellular accumulation and upregulation of apoptotic E2F1 target
  genes and repression of survival pathways. This results in transcription of proapoptotic
  target genes, which largely affect the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway at
  the mitochondria or, in the case of p53 and p73, increase apoptotic gene transcription
  to amplify these effects. The intrinsic p53-dependent and -independent pathways
  that culminate in caspase-3 activation and cell death are shown. Blue describes
  nuclear events, yellow portrays events at the mitochondrial outer membrane, and
  green depicts cytoplasmic events. Dashed lines represent steps that have been omitted.
  (B) The main domains of E2F1 include the nuclear localization signal (NLS), cyclin
  A binding domain (CycA), the DNA binding domain (DBD), the DP binding domain (DP),
  the marked box (MB), and the transactivation domain (TAD), which also contains the
  pRB binding domain (RB). The main modifications of E2F1, the respective residues,
  and the responsible enzyme are outlined in the figure. Encircled (P) signifies phosphorylation,
  (Me) methylation, (Ac) acetylation, and (Nd) NEDDylation.
