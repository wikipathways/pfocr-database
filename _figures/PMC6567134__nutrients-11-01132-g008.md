caption: Schematic representation of the transcriptional regulation and role of CIDE
  pathway in controlling hepatic lipid metabolism (red and green arrows indicate respectively
  up- and down- regulated genes) Under HFD–F treatment the gene expression of protein
  involved in triglycerides synthesis and storage, resulted increased. Particularly
  the HFD–F via Srebf1 activation, promoted the transcription of lipidogenic genes,
  such as Fasn and Cidea. BAR502 activates FXR thus suppressing a cluster of genes
  downstream to Srebf1 including fatty acid synthase (Fasn) and Cell death-inducing
  DFF45-like effector (CIDE) genes, Cidea and Cidec, involved in lipid droplets formation
  and triglycerides storage.
