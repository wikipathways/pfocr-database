caption: Schematic diagram of the hypothetical pathways that lead to CARF-suppression
  induced apoptosis. Our results excluded the crucial involvement of Ras-MAPK and
  RB–E2F1 pathways and demonstrated that mitotic arrest and cell death induced by
  CARF inhibition progresses via the ATR–CHK1 pathway
