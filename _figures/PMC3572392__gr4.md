caption: 'Almost all Theileria annulata proteins involved in glycolysis and citric
  acid cycle were identified in the study. The glycolysis pathway is shown on the
  left and the citric acid cycle is shown on the right. Reaction products: G6P, glucose

  dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Gly-3P, glycerol 3 phosphate; Gly, glycerol; GAD-3P,
  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 1, 3BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate;
  2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Pyr, pyruvate; AcCoA, acetyl
  coenzyme A. Enzymes with identified Theileria annulata proteins included in brackets:
  HK, hexokinase (TA19800); GPI, glucose 6-phosphate-isomerase (TA04045); PPi-FPK,
  pyrophosphate dependent phosphofructokinase (TA13950); PBP, fructose bisphosphatase;
  F1, 6BPA, fructose bisphosphate aldolase (TA20060); TPI, triosephosphate isomerase
  (TA08590); Gly-3PDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Gly-K, glycerol kinase;
  GAPDH, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (TA08145, TA15530); PGK, phosphoglycerate
  kinase (TA06655); PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase (TA10465); ENO, enolase (TA10425);
  PK, pyruvate kinase (TA11540, TA10915); LDH, lactate dehydrogenase (TA09590); PC,
  pyruvate carboxylase; ACO, aconitase (TA17020); IDH, isocitrate dehyrogenase (TA10850);
  OGDH, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (TA05275, TA08530); SCS, succinyl coenzyme A synthetase
  (TA02815, TA10625); SDH, succinate dehydrogenase (TA19430, TA03455); FH, fumarate
  hydratase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase (TA18100); CS, citrate synthase (TA14450);
  PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
  (TA20590); GLUD, glutamate dehydrogenase (TA11105) (). Transmembrane transporters:
  HT, Hexose transporter (TA02480); Na+/Glu-T, sodium glutamate symporter (TA10315).
  Green indicates proteins that were not identified, but predicted, red shows no prediction
  and grey indicates proteins that were identified and are also likely to be involved.
  Dashed arrows in the citric acid cycle indicate that only a branch of the cycle
  is active in the schizont stage.'
