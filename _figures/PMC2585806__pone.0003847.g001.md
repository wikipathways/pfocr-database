caption: A) Principles of metabolic network analysis with [1-13C] glucose. The 13C
  labelling pattern of pyruvate is dependent on the active metabolic pathways. For
  instance, pyruvate formed in the EMP pathway contains 13C carbon in position 3,
  while activity of the PP pathway results in loss of labelled carbon. Pyruvate is
  the precursor of valine, which is incorporated into biomass. Based on the labelling
  pattern of valine and other proteinogenic amino acids the fluxes in the central
  carbon metabolism can be resolved. B) Major metabolic fluxes of the A. nidulans
  strains investigated. The two strains, A4 (WT) and AR1phkGP74 (PHK). IA indicates
  the presence of iodo acetate in the cultivation medium. All fluxes are relative
  to a glucose uptake rate of 100 moles (arbitrary number).
