caption: An integrated model of wheat flowering regulation under LD. Three pathways
  regulate the expression of FT under LD in rice () and sorghum (, ), and a similar
  model is proposed here for wheat. We propose that light-activated Pfr forms of PHYC
  (homo- or heterodimers) operate upstream of these three different pathways, identified
  with the letters A to D. (Pathway A) The central pathway, indicated by thicker arrows,
  has the largest effect on the acceleration of flowering under LD. The PHYC-mediated
  light activation of PPD1 results in the convergence of light and circadian clock
  signals in the transcriptional regulation of PPD1, which is critical for measurement
  of day length, according to the external coincidence model (blue arrow). Under LD,
  PPD1/PRR37 up-regulates FT1 in barley and wheat () but down-regulates FT homologs
  in rice and sorghum (, ). Up-regulation of FT1 in wheat is associated with the up-regulation
  of FT2 (, ), which also promotes flowering (). (Pathway B) PHYC also modulates the
  expression of circadian clock and clock output genes CO1 and CO2. The role of these
  genes on wheat flowering is still not well understood, but the Arabidopsis (CO)
  and rice (HD1) homologs are involved in the photoperiodic regulation of FT (, ).
  Tentatively, a similar role is hypothesized in wheat (dotted blue arrow). (Pathways
  A and B) PPD1 mutations in wheat affect CO1 transcription suggesting a crosstalk
  between the A and B pathways (either directly or indirectly through a feedback effect
  of FT1, dotted black lines) (, ). (Pathway C) VRN2 is a long-day repressor of FT1
  that prevents flowering in the fall (, ). VRN2 is transcribed only in the light
  () and is down-regulated in the presence of the phyCB mutation (P < 0.0001) (SI
  Appendix, Fig. S11), which suggests that the light activation of VRN2 transcription
  is mediated by PHYC. This hypothesis is further supported by the drastic down-regulation
  of VRN2 transcription in the mvp mutants with a deleted PHYC gene (). VRN2 and PPD1
  compete for the activation of FT1, but the repressing effect of VRN2 is epistatic
  to the promoting effect of PPD1, preventing flowering in the fall. Long exposures
  to cold temperatures during the winter (vernalization) result in the up-regulation
  of VRN1 in both apices and leaves (, ). In the apex, VRN1 initiates the transition
  of the shoot apical meristem to the reproductive stage whereas, in the leaves, it
  acts as a transcriptional repressor of VRN2 (). The down-regulation of VRN2 results
  in the up-regulation of FT1 by PPD1 and the acceleration of flowering during the
  longer days of spring. The up-regulation of FT1 in the leaves further induces VRN1
  (), closing a positive feedback loop that accelerates flowering under LD (, ). (Pathway
  D) In the apex, FT1 induces VRN1 transcription and gibberellin biosynthesis and
  accumulation (). The simultaneous presence of gibberellin and VRN1 results in the
  up-regulation of SOC1-1 and LFY, which are required for normal wheat-spike development.
  The regulation of gibberellin biosynthesis in the apex by FT1 acts as a secondary
  LD regulatory point ().
