caption: Hypothetic model of Abcc6 function in cholesterol homeostasis of mice. This
  model summarizes the results obtained in this study and illustrates the possible
  effects of an Abcc6 loss of function in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in mice.
  We further demonstrated a disturbed reverse cholesterol transport by reduction of
  important apolipoproteins for HDL functionality in serum of Abcc6−/− mice (ApoA-I
  and ApoA-II). We found elevated cholesterol precursors in serum of Abcc6 knockout
  mice (zymosterol, desmosterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol) as hint for an increased overall
  cholesterol synthesis. In a former study, we showed that Abcg5/Abcg8 expression
  in the liver of Abcc6−/− mice was induced, suggesting an increased sterol excretion
  by the liver. In summary, we propose that Abcc6-deficiency in mice might be accompanied
  by a reduced absorption of cholesterol and thereby phytosterols in the intestine.
  Green arrows indicate increased target expression, increased protein/metabolite
  concentration or activation of a pathway, red arrows indicate the repression of
  target expression or protein/metabolite concentration or inactivation of a pathway.
