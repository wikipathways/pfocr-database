caption: Enhanced expression of PIM2 in MM bone lesions. PIM2 is a novel pro-survival
  mediator for MM cells. Interaction with MM bone marrow microenvironment potentiates
  PIM2 expression in MM cells through activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway for IL-6
  and the NF-κB pathway for TNF family cytokines, TNFα, BAFF, and APRIL, to promote
  MM cell growth and survival. At the same time, PIM2 is induced in osteoclasts and
  bone marrow stromal cells through the interaction with MM cells to cause bone destruction.
  Therefore, PIM2 is overexpressed in MM cells, and bone marrow microenvironment in
  MM appears to be an important therapeutic target.
