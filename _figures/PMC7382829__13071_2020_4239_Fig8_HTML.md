caption: Fatty acid metabolic pathways in macrophages infected with Nc-Spain1H versus
  non-infected cells. The KEGG pathway maps [] represent the molecular networks Fatty
  acid biosynthesis (a) and Fatty acid degradation (b) in which DEG in bovine macrophages
  infected with Nc-Spain1H versus non-infected macrophages are highlighted. Upregulated
  genes are represented in red and downregulated genes are represented in green. The
  color intensity corresponds to the level of up- or downregulation. Results were
  obtained from three biological replicates for each condition. Similar regulation
  was observed for Nc-Spain7 infection
