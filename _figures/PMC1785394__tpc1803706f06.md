caption: The Trp Metabolic Pathway.The pathway shows steps between the Trp precursor
  chorismate and the Trp-derived phytoalexin camalexin. The names in gray denote genes
  encoding pathway enzymes whose expression was called increased in 3-d-old vte2 seedlings
  relative to wild-type seedlings (expression data; see Supplemental Table 1 online).
  The number of enzymatic steps between indole-3-acetaldoxime and camalexin are not
  known. Enzymes are phosphoribosylanthranilate transferase (PAT1, also known as TRP1;
  At5g17990), indole-3-glycerol-phosphate synthase (IGPS; At2g04400), Trp synthase,
  α subunit (TSA1, also known as TRP3; At3g54640), CYP79B2 (At4g39950), CYP79B3 (At2g22330),
  and PAD3 (CYP71B15; At3g26830). CPADRP, 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1′-deoxyribulose-5′-phosphate;
  IAOx, indole-3-acetaldoxime; I3GP, indole-3-glycerol-phosphate; NPRA, N-(5-phosphoribosyl)-anthranilate.
