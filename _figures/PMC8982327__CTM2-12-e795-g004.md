caption: Figure showing molecular pathways involving the transforming growth factor‐β
  (TGF‐β) role in cancer. The TGF‐β signalling pathway regulates embryogenesis, cell
  homeostasis, proliferation, differentiation and death. TβRI, TβRII and TβRIII—TGF‐β
  receptor types—serine/threonine kinases induce heterotetrameric receptor complexes.
  TGF‐β can carry out apoptosis through small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad)‐dependent
  and ‐independent pathways. TGF‐β also follows a non‐Smad pathway where it binds
  with different cytokine‐like p38, c‐Jun N‐terminal kinases, extracellular signal‐regulated
  kinase and phosphoinositide 3‐kinase and promotes transcriptional activity. In the
  nucleus, it regulates gene expression by binding with two types of receptors in
  the cell membrane with intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity which is then
  conducted by intercellular Smad proteins. These are transcription factor that regulates
  gene expression. Created with BioRender.com
