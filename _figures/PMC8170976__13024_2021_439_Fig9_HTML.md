caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). IPA shows the relationships between altered
  miRNAs in the myenteric plexus (MP) of the large intestine (LI) from pre-symptomatic
  (ps)A30P mice compared with wild type (WT) controls and their target proteins. IPA
  functional pathway analysis was used to predict the top transcriptional regulators
  from differentially expressed proteins in murine PD models. miRNA target (protein)
  filter pairing analysis was done in order to identify co-regulated miRNAs/target
  pairs. We identified 77 protein-miRNA interactions which involved 25 dysregulated
  proteins and 31 miRNAs and eight protein-protein interactions. These predictions
  are based on Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base (IPKB). Nefl is targeted by let 7i-5p,
  miR-10a-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-23a-3p, miR-30c-5p, miR-99a-5p, miR-125a-5p, miR-126-3p,
  miR-126-5p, and miR-181a-5p; Vamp2 is targeted by let-7i-5p, miR-10a-5p, miR-22-3p,
  miR-30c-5p, miR-99a-5p, miR-135a-5p, miR-338-3p, miR-350-3p, miR-377-3p, and miR-495-3p;
