caption: A subset of the fatty acid elongation pathway. Structures correspond to FabB,
  FabI and FabH, three among the 15 top-ranked candidates in the scoring pipeline
  for drug target selection in Kp. Representation of the most druggable pocket is
  shown in yellow within the structures. Green nodes indicate proteins that were top-ranked
  in our analyses. Conservation (in percent) of each protein in 38 pathogenic Kp genomes
  is also shown.
