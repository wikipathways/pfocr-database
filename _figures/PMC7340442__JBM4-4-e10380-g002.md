caption: Current understanding of leucine‐rich repeat‐containing G protein‐coupled
  receptors (LGRs) as auxiliary receptors in the Wnt pathway. (A) In the absence of
  R‐spondins, the ubiquitination complex ZNRF3/RNF43 targets Fzd for degradation,
  removing receptor binding sites for Wnt ligands. The destruction complex is free
  to phosphorylate β‐catenin, preventing β‐catenin entry into the nucleus and leading
  to attenuated Wnt signaling. (B) R‐spondins bind to LGRs and sequester the ubiquitination
  complex ZNRF3/RNF43. This results in longer cell surface residence of Fzd, and in
  the presence of Wnt ligands, the destruction complex is deactivated. Free from phosphorylation
  and degradation, β‐catenin can enter the nucleus to bind TCF/LEF, driving the transcription
  of Wnt target genes and enhancing Wnt signaling.
