caption: 'The main inflammatory response is mediated by mtDNA/dsDNA in IR/I. When
  mitochondria are damaged by oxidative stress, the permeability of the mitochondrial
  membrane will increase, and the leakage of cytochrome c and other apoptosis-inducing
  molecules in the mitochondrial matrix will initiate the apoptosis pathway. Then,
  the released mtDNA/dsDNA causes a series of inflammatory reactions: NLRP3 recruits
  caspase-1 (caspase-1) to form inflammasomes through the caspase recruitment domain
  (ASC), and it induces cell burns. On the one hand, it responds to the pro-inflammatory
  signal of TLR; TLR can directly recognize mtDNA/dsDNA through the MYD88 pathway,
  cGAS recognizes mtDNA in the cytoplasm, produces cGAMP, promotes the dimerization
  and activation of STING, and STING can also promote the outflow of K+ ions to participate
  in the NLRP3 pathway. The resulting inflammatory signal can also further activate
  the TLR located in the endosome, so that inflammation can be magnified. Finally,
  the NFκB and IRF3 pathways induce the production of inflammatory signals, leading
  to the massive release of cytokines IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, etc., and triggering an inflammatory
  response.'
