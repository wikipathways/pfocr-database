caption: Effects of LH on spermatogenesis, LCs, and sperm cells. LCs originate from
  fibroblasts or lymphatic endothelial cells. LH can promote testosterone synthesis
  in LCs, as well as their proliferation, differentiation, and regulation of the biological
  clock. Upon LH binding to LHR on the surface of ALCs, multiple pathways are initiated,
  leading to the synthesis of StAR protein located on the mitochondrial membrane.
  StAR protein facilitates the transfer of cholesterol into mitochondria, where it
  is converted into pregnenolone by CYP11A1. Pregnenolone undergoes conversion to
  dehydroepiandrosterone by CYP17A1, which further metabolizes into androstenedione
  by 3βHSD1 or into progesterone by 3βHSD2 before being converted into androstenedione
  by CYP17A1. Androstenedione is then synthesized into testosterone by 17βHDS3. Testosterone
  enters LCs and binds to androgen receptors (ARs), causing dissociation of heat shock
  proteins. Activated ARs translocate to the nucleus and bind to ARE elements, initiating
  gene transcription (classical pathway). Activated ARs can also activate MAPK kinase
  activity through EGFR activation, phosphorylating CREB protein to activate gene
  transcription (non-classical pathway). Through a series of pathways, this ultimately
  promotes spermatocyte meiosis, maturation, release, formation, and maintenance of
  the blood–testis barrier and the development of spermatogonial stem cells. LHR is
  also present on spermatocytes, suggesting that LH may regulate processes such as
  sperm energy acquisition, morphological changes, and motility. Figure support was
