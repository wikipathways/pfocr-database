caption: Algorithm for the investigation of patients with elevated cardiac troponin
  concentrations in the context of an alternative acute illness. Change in cardiac
  troponin concentration on serial measurement is used to identify patients with acute
  and chronic myocardial injury. The definition of change in cardiac troponin will
  be dependent on the assay and should be consistent with the local pathway for the
  assessment of patients with an isolated presentation with suspected acute coronary
  syndrome. CAD, coronary artery disease.
