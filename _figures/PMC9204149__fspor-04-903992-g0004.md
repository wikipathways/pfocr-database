caption: 'The commonly understood electron transport chain, simplified (male), results
  in ROS buildup, a consequence of increased O2 diffusion into the mitochondria and
  subsequent consumption by CIV, greater ADP influx (due to greater ADP sensitivity)
  and ATP production. The parallel pathway (female) is depicted, however the degree
  in which it functions over or in conjunction with the common pathway (male) is not
  fully understood. Briefly: Decreased O2 consumption in peripheral tissues may have
  induced adaptation of mitochondria in females to require more efficient control
  of energy production, as evidenced by human and animal studies (in text). Decreased
  ADP sensitivity (sex differences in VDAC and ANT regulation unknown) in females
  would prevent large influx of ADP from the cytosol, reducing the production of ROS
  overall. Estrogen represses Ucp3 expression, preventing energy dissipation, and
  reduces proton transport into the mitochondria, a possible strategy for energy conservation
  and a response to decreased ROS production. Increased Malonyl-CoA production, inhibits
  CPT1 transport of free fatty acids into the mitochondria, resulting in greater triglyceride
  production in the cytosol and a more controlled energy production within the mitochondria.
  Greater CII involvement (female), requiring less proton influx may control production
  of ROS further. Overall, these adaptations suggest that females exhibit an efficient
  control of ATP production while simultaneously reducing ROS production. Created
