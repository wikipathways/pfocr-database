caption: 'Schematic of metabolic pathways showing key metabolic alterations in the
  DKO mice lipidome. Lipid classes detected in the study are indicated as bolded blue
  text, while unbolded blue text signifies other metabolites in the metabolic pathway.
  Red text indicates enzymes known to be overly expressed in ovarian cancer cells
  or other related cancer, with relevant references. For each detected lipid class
  presented, information about the cluster they belong to in the temporal trend analyses
  is provided, in addition to the breakdown information on discriminant lipids selected
  by ML algorithms. A red circle represents the cumulative change in the detected
  lipid classes (increase in DKO mice), a green circle (decrease in DKO mice), or
  a white circle (no cumulative change). Cumulative changes are computed by counting
  the number of both increased and decreased levels among the selected discriminant
  lipids in all lifetime stages. Pathway information was derived from the existing
  literature. Abbreviations: G3P: glycerol-3-phosphate, PA: phosphatidic acid, DG:
