caption: TGF-β signaling in GBM progression. In GBM cells, upregulation of TGF-β1
  and TGF-β2 activates the TGF-β signaling pathway, triggering a cascade of cellular
  events that drive tumor progression. This activation increases the expression of
  PDGF-BB and SMAD2/3, which enhance cell proliferation and tumor growth. Elevated
  SMAD2 and ZEB1 levels further promote tumor cell invasion, contributing to the aggressive
  and metastatic nature of GBM. TGF-β signaling also plays a crucial role in immune
  modulation by suppressing T cell activation and proliferation, reducing NK cell
  activity, and downregulating IL-2 production, thereby weakening the immune response
  and enabling tumor immune evasion. Additionally, TGF-β signaling drives M2 polarization
  of macrophages, leading to the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, which further
  enhance immune suppression within the TME
