caption: 'a Canonical Pathway: The NMIBC patients upregulate the IL-6 mediate JAK
  /STAT pathway followed by inhibition of CD4 + memory and regulatory T cells with
  increase the thrombo-inflammatory syndrome induced mortality in patients with Co-existing
  condition to COVID-19 response in infected patients. Whereas, IL-6 induced JAK/STAT
  in NMIBC inhibit cytotoxic T cell activation and elevate the rate of proliferation
  and progression of NMIBC to high-risk category. b BCG induced Pathway: The BCG instillation
  in NMIBC patients downregulate the IL-6 mediated JAK/STAT pathway with upregulation
  of CD4 + memory and receptor T cells with upregulation of cytotoxic T-Cells and
  affect the proliferation and progression of NMIBC. Furthermore, we proposed BCG
  induction in NMIBC patients with COVID-19 reduce the risk of mortality by alleveating
  the thrombi-inflammatory syndrome and could be a potential treatment for the COVID-19
  infection with reduced mortality rate'
