caption: Upon administration, pentavalent antimony (Sb(V)) is bioreduced to trivalent
  antimony (Sb(III)) within Leishmania parasites, leading to 2 primary pathways of
  action. Sb(III) inhibits trypanothione reductase (TryR), disrupting the parasite’s
  redox balance and increasing oxidative stress. Concurrently, Sb(III) affects DNA
  topoisomerase I activity, impairing DNA supercoiling essential for replication and
  transcription. Additionally, Sb(V) shows intrinsic antileishmanial activity independent
  of its reduction to Sb(III), further complicating the parasite’s survival. Trypanothione
  peroxidase (TryP) participates in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS), and
  the inhibition of TryR enhances ROS generation, leading to further damage to parasite
  macromolecules, including DNA and proteins, disrupting homeostasis and contributing
  to parasite death
