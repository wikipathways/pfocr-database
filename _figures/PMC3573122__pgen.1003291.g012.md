caption: Persistent injury of the respiratory epithelium causes release of profibrotic
  factors such as TGFβ. In lung fibroblasts, TGFβ binds to TGFβR I (RI) and II (RII)
  and the resultant complex can be internalized via two distinct endocytic pathways.
  The clathrin-coated pit pathway (red arrows) increases TGFβ signal transduction
  leading to the activation of lung fibroblasts and ultimately lung fibrosis whereas
  the CAV1 lipid raft pathway (green arrows) mediates TGFβ/TGFβR complex degradation,
  thus decreasing TGFβ signaling and preventing lung fibrosis . Production of miR-199a-5p
  in response to TGFβ in lung fibroblasts results in CAV1 downregulation and subsequently,
  impaired TGFβ/TGFβR complex degradation. This miRNA-mediated mechanism for low CAV1
  expression promotes TGFβ signaling and the pathogenic activation of lung fibroblasts.
  CAV1 = caveolin-1, TGFβ = Transforming Growth factor-β, TGFβR = Transforming Growth
  factor-β Receptor, SBE = SMAD Binding Element, ECM = Extracellular Matrix.
