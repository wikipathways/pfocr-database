caption: Components of the purinergic signaling pathway. Stimulation of specific surface
  immune cell receptors that recognize pathogens, antigens, cytokines or chemokines
  triggers the release of ATP through connexin or pannexin hemichannels. ATP in the
  extracellular space can stimulate the P2X or P2Y receptors to trigger an inflammatory
  response. The ecto-apyrase (CD39) catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP/AMP, and
  consecutively, the enzyme 5'-ectonucleotidase (CD73) catalyzes the limiting step
  of conversion to adenosine (ADO), which is the ligand for P1 receptors promoting
  anti-inflammatory responses. ADO can be removed by nucleoside transporters, which
  facilitates its cellular absorption, or by adenosine deaminase (ADA), which converts
  ADO to inosine
