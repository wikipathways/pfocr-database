caption: The central role of β-catenin in Wnt signaling and the cadherin complex.
  β-Catenin exists in a cadherin-bound form that regulates adhesion; in a complex
  with axin, APC, and GSK-3β, where it is phosphorylated and targeted for degradation
  by β-TrCP; or in the nucleus with TCF/LEF transcription factors. Wnt signaling,
  proceeding through Frizzled and Arrow–LRP-5/6, activates Dishevelled (Dsh), which
  results in uncoupling β-catenin from the degradation pathway and its entry into
  the nucleus, where it interacts with TCF/LEF to control transcription. Wnt protein
  can also interact with the Derailed receptor to control axon path-finding. The Wnt
  pathway is also subject to extensive regulation and feedback control by extracellular
  factors that bind Wnt [Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF) and Frizzled-related protein
  (FRP)] or the coreceptor LRP (Dickkopf). The insert displays possible levels of
  interactions between Wnt signaling and cadherin-mediated adhesion (dotted lines)
  and the central role of β-catenin in both processes that are the focus of the review.
