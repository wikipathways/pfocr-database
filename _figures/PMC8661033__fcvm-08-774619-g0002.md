caption: Mechanisms of mitochondria dynamics and mitophagy. Mitochondria are highly
  dynamic organelles undergoing coordinated cycles of fission and fusion. A series
  of GTPase-related proteins are involved in the dynamic process. Drp1 is the main
  regulator of mitochondrial fission, and Mfn1/2, combined with OPA1 regulate the
  fusion process. After mitochondrial fission, the mitochondrial fragments could be
  cleared out via PINK/Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway.

    is the main regulator of mitochondrial fission, and Mfn1/2, combined with OPA1
    regulate the fusion process. After mitochondrial fission, the mitochondrial fragments
