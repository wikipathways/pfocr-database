caption: Model of the Mb maturation process. Immature apo-Mb is bound directly to
  hsp90 in cells and during its maturation is part of a dynamic protein complex that
  can also contain hsp70 and the cochaperones STIP1, Aha1, Cdc37, and Aarsd1. The
  heme insertion into apo-Mb is blocked by hsp90 inhibitors and is stimulated when
  cells contain an active sGC-cGMP signaling pathway.
papertitle: Myoglobin maturation is driven by the hsp90 chaperone machinery and by
  soluble guanylyl cyclase.
