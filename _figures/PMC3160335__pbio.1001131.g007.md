caption: Ancestral regulatory interactions are indicated in black, and newly evolved
  interactions in red. In the ancestral condition (left), leg patterning genes lay
  down the basic bristle pattern and establish a domain of high Scr expression on
  the ventral-anterior surface of the distal Ti and ta1. High levels of Scr organize
  the ventral-anterior bristles into TBRs. dsx is not expressed in the TBRs so they
  develop in a sexually monomorphic manner. In the melanogaster-obscura clade (right),
  dsx was recruited into the TBR development pathway under the control of both Scr
  and leg patterning genes. Scr activates dsx in T1 at the late larval stage, while
  dsx modulates Scr at the pupal stage to make its expression sexually dimorphic in
  some species. Both genes have acquired new downstream targets involved in bristle
  patterning and morphogenesis.
