caption: Speculative model of TERRA, hnRNP A1, and hTR/DNA-PKcs interactions at telomeres.
  The presence of “free” hTR (not associated with TERRA) stimulates DNA-PKcs phosphorylation
  of hnRNP A1, an event that contributes to the removal of TERRA from telomeres and
  may be especially important at leading-strand telomeres due to sequence complementary
  with TERRA. hnRNP A1 shuttling of TERRA off telomeres and out of the nucleus to
  the cytoplasm may aid the NMD pathway of TERRA degradation and serve to regulate
  TERRA levels in a cell cycle dependent manner. This supposition is supported by
  previous demonstrations of SMG1 stimulation and UPF1 action at leading-strand telomeres
  (Chawla et al., ). As TERRA is also complementary to hTR, when TERRA levels are
  low in S-phase, hnRNP A1 may also aid in the recruitment of hTR to its 3′ single-stranded
  overhang/substrate on newly replicated lagging-strand telomeres. When TERRA levels
  are high (e.g., in G1), sequestration of hTR by TERRA limits TERRA localization
  to telomeres, and influences the balance of free to telomere-bound TERRA.
