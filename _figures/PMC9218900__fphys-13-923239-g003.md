caption: 'When cells are exposed to a variety of stimuli (inflammatory factors, bacterial
  infection, oxidative stress, etc.,). IκB flows through the degradation of the IKK
  phosphorylated proteasome, leading to abnormal NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation,
  thus promoting the transcription and translation of inflammation-related genes.
  The acute inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β induce the activation of the NF-κB
  signaling pathway by activating the membrane receptors TNFR-1 and IL-1R, respectively.
  Activation of TLR4, a receptor on the renal tubular epithelial cell membrane, can
  form a complex of related factors to activate the NF-κB signal transduction pathway.
  SIRT1 reduces NF-κB activity and indirectly inhibits the expression of downstream
  inflammatory cytokines. Inflammasomes located in the cytoplasm can activate caspase-1
  to release pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-18, and finally produce
  an inflammatory response. The current research suggests that ncRNAs play an important
  role in regulating the inflammatory response of AKI, and they are involved in regulating
  the NF-KB pathway and cell pyroptosis at the transcription level, thus regulating
  the inflammatory response. In the inflammatory response of AKI, ncRNAs usually work
  in the following ways: 1) miRNA directly targets the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR)
  of the target mRNA to inhibit transcription; 2) lncRNAs and circRNAs, commonly bind
  directly to miRNAs through competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that promote up-regulation
  of target mRNA levels.'
