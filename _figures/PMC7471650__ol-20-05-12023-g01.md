caption: Relationship between Sirt3 and autophagy in ovarian cancer. Metformin-induced
  overexpression of Sirt3 activates AMPK, which in turn increases the expression of
  LC3. This results in the elevation in the expression of proteins associated with
  cell migration, such as MTA1. S1 is a novel pan Bcl-2 inhibitor that has been documented
  to activate autophagy by interrupting the interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclin1.
  Sirt3 is involved in the regulation of autophagy via the GTSP1/JNK/autophagy pathway.
  S1 can promote the expression of JNK3. Knocking down Sirt3 expression can alleviate
  S1-induced apoptosis. MTA1, metastasis-associated protein; GTSP, glutathione S-transferase
  P; LC3, microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B; Sirt3, sirtuin; AMPK,
  5′AMP-activated protein kinase.
