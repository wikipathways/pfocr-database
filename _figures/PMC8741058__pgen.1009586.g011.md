caption: '(A) Schematic overview of the relationships between the biosynthetic pathways
  of individual components of the cell envelope. (B) A schematic of the imbalanced
  cell envelope of a yhcB mutant in comparison to wild-type (WT). The yhcB mutant
  suffers from defects in OM asymmetry, excessive phospholipid synthesis and altered
  crosslinking in the peptidoglycan layer. (C) The positional context of YhcB in conjunction
  with the reported protein interaction partners of YhcB in situ. YhcB interacts with
  both the elongasome (amber; depicted here as mediated via RodZ, but YhcB is reported
  to interact with RodA, MreD and MreC in addition to RodZ) and LapA from the complex
  that regulates LpxC degradation (grey). YhcB is spatially positioned to coordinate
  peptidoglycan expansion with LPS export, represented by the solid black double arrow.
  For simplicity, the LPS biosynthesis pathway has been replaced by a dashed arrow
  from LpxC, which exacts the first committed step of LPS synthesis, to the Lpt bridge,
  which facilitates LPS export. Abbreviations: Enterobacterial Common Antigen (ECA);
  Lipopolysaccharide (LPS); Peptidoglycan (PG); Phospholipid (PL); Undecaprenyl phosphate
  (Und-P); Undecaprenyl diphosphate (Und-PP); Uridine diphosphate (UDP); N-acetylglucosamine
  (G); N-acetylmuramic acid (M); Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP). Interaction of YhcB with
  RodZ and LapA has been reported by Li et al. [] and Hu et al. [].'
