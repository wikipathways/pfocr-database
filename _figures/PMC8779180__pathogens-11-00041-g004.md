caption: Glycerophospholipid (GPL) metabolism in regular trypanosomatids (RT), symbiont
  harboring trypanosomatid (SHT), and trypanosomatid proteobacterial endosymbiont
  (TPE). The scheme summarizes the metabolic pathways of GPL synthesis considering
  the genes identified in RT, SHT, and Candidatus Kinetoplastibacterium crithidii
  (A. deanei symbiont). The synthesis of GPL can use metabolic intermediates, such
  as DHAP and G3P, for the synthesis of PA, a central molecule in the metabolism of
  GPL. In RTs and SHTs, CDP-DAG is produced from PA, thus enabling the synthesis of
  zwiterionic GPL (PS, PE, and PC) or the production of PGP. It is important to note
  that in these organisms, the synthesis of CL does not pass through PGP but occurs
  through the metabolites CDP-DAG and PG to form CL. Differently, the TPE can use
  PGP to produce PG, but genes encoding prokaryotic enzymes that produce CL have not
  been found. RT and SHT present genes for PC synthesis from PE methylation through
  the Greenberg pathways (highlighted in the green background) and through de-novo
  synthesis via the Kennedy pathway (highlighted in the blue background). PE can be
  produced from the Kennedy pathway or in reverse from PS (the latter path was also
  identified in the symbiont). One possibility is that a phospholipase D (PLD) could
  act on the metabolism of lyso-PC and lyso-PE molecules, which could be obtained
  from the environment and used as a source to produce GPL. For detailed identification
  of enzymes and molecules of these pathways, check  and . CL, cardiolipin; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  DAGP, diacylglycerol phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone; G3P, glycerol 3 phosphate;
  Lyso-PA, lyso-phosphatidic acid; Lyso-PC:, lso-phosphatidylcholine; Lyso-PE, lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine;
  PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG,
  phosphatidylglycerol; PGP, phosphatidylglycerolphosphate; PS, phosphatidylserine;
  RT, regular trypanosomatids; SHT, symbiont harboring trypanosomatids; TPE, trypanosomatid
  proteobacterial endosymbiont.
