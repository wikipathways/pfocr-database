caption: The involvement of mini-YARS/mini-WARS in angiogenesisFull-length of YARS
  is extracellular cleaved by polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) elastase or other
  protease molecules into C- and N-terminal fragments (mini-YARS), which can regulate
  angiogenesis or immune response, respectively. Mini-YARS can also transactivate
  VEGFR. Full length of WARS is further processed outside of cells by PMN elastase
  or other proteases to form mini-WARS-like fragments. Mini-WARS inhibits angiogenesis
  by binding to the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin. When mini-WARS is combined
  with VE-cadherin, it inhibits the VEGF-induced signaling pathway and ultimately
  suppresses the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of ECs. In addition, mini-WARS
  could inhibit mini-YARS-induced angiogenesis.
