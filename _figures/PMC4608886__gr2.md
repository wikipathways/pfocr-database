caption: PPN cell types manifesting P/Q-type channels only, N-type channels only,
  or N- and P/Q-type channels. PPN cells with only P/Q-type calcium channels numbered
  20%, and are assumed to be “Wake-on” and modulated by CaMKII. PPN cells with both
  N- and P/Q-type calcium channels numbered 50%, and are assumed to be Wake/REM-on”
  and modulated by both CaMKII and cAMP/PKA metabolic pathways. PPN cells with only
  N-type calcium channels numbered 30%, and are assumed to be “REM-on” and modulated
  by the cAMP/PKA pathway. P/Q-only and N+P/Q cells thus are expected to be active
  during waking, while N-only and N+P/Q cells are active during REM sleep.
