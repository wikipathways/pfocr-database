caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Network 2 depicting relationship among up-regulation
  Genes in SL1344 vs SB1117 infection groups at 8 hours. Intensity of the red color
  indicates the degree of up-regulation. Nodes are displayed using various shapes
  that represent the functional class of the gene product. Edges are displayed with
  various labels that describe the nature of relationship between the nodes: ___ represents
  direct relationship, ----- represents indirect relationship → represents acts on.'
