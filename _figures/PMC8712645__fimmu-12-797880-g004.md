caption: DDR Inhibition and Antitumor Immunity. DDR Inhibition and DDR defects can
  increase cytosolic DNA that activates the cGAS to generate cGAMP and promote tumor
  neoantigen production. cGAMP can activate cell intrinsic STING pathway and spread
  the immunity to bystander cells. All these factors contribute to an inflammatory
  tumor microenvironment and promote the recruitment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and
  constrict cancer growth effectively. Combining DDR inhibition (such as PARP or PARG
  inhibition) with Immune checkpoint blockade (including PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA4 blockade)
  may be a promising strategy with the potential to improve survival outcomes.
