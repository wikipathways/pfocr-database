caption: The exocyst complex (comprised of Sec3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, Exo70, and Exo84)
  acts at the first stage of the secretory pathway, where it regulates the translocon
  in the ER, most likely by phosphorylation of Sec61β, for synthesis of basolateral
  proteins. The exocyst also acts at the final stages of the secretory pathway to
  target and dock vesicles carrying basolateral proteins, such as VSVG, at the region
  just below the tight junction, and ciliary proteins, such as IFT20, at the primary
  cilium. Sec10 and Sec15 act as a bridge between the Rab GTPase Rab8, found on the
  surface of the secretory vesicles carrying polarized proteins, and the rest of the
  exocyst complex, which is in contact with the plasma membrane. The green channel
  in the ER represents the translocon, which includes Sec61β, and the small red circles
  in the ER represent the phosphorylation of Sec61β.
