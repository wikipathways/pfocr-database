caption: Model of BTK signaling pathway in COVID-19 hyper inflammation. SARS-CoV-2
  entry is mediated by binding to ACE2 receptors in epithelial cells, stimulating
  the BTK pathway in COVID-19 inflammation. In macrophages, binding toll-like receptors
  (TLR3/7/8) to SARS-CoV-2 viral ssRNA stimulates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kβ)
  signaling pathway through BTK activation and leads to the production of multiple
  inflammatory cytokines , , . BTK-depend NF-kβ stimulation could increase cytokine
  release and recruit monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils in severe COVID-19 infection
  . The binding of BTK to NLRP3 could phosphorylate and converts it into NLRP3 inflammasome,
  which turns pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β , , .
