caption: Part of the structure of the RC from R. sphaeroides in  the charge-separated
  state (coordinates are from ref. ). Shown are the  two quinones with their bridging
  amino acid residues, His-M219 and  His-L190, and the nonheme Fe2+. The amino acid
  residues  Asp-M17, Asp-L210, Asp-L213, Ser-L223, and Glu-L212, involved in proton  transfer
  to QB are shown, with the transfer of  H+(2) (bold) to Glu-L212 (boxed). The pathway
  (thin arrow)  for H+(1) has recently been determined () and the pathway  for H+(2)
  (bold arrow) was studied in this work.  H+(2) is taken up to Glu-L212 in response
  to reduction of  the quinones and then is transferred to QB after  kAB(2) (see text
  and Fig. ). Filled  circles represent water molecules, and dashed lines potential
  hydrogen  bonds. Also shown are Asp-H124, His-H126, and His-H128 that bind  Zn2+
  and Cd2+ at the circled star.  Ni2+ binds to His-H126 and Asp-M17 at the boxed star
  ().  In the absence of metal ions, the positions of the circled and boxed  stars
  are occupied by water molecules. The illustration was made by  using the programs
  molscript () and  raster3d ().
