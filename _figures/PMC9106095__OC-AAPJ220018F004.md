caption: Schematic representation of the yin and yang inflammatory response carried
  out by the NF-κB signaling pathway. Intranuclear signal transduction can proceed
  via two pathways; pathway NF-κB can progress to enhance and perpetuate the inflammatory
  response by triggering the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and pathway
  nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation through oxidation
  of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) by peroxidases and other anti-inflammatory
  proteins can dampens proinflammatory signaling. NF-κB = nuclear factor κ B. Reproduced
