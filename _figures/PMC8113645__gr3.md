caption: Biosynthetic pathway of dammarenediol-II and MK4 in P. pastoris. This study
  was carried out on the basis of the natural triterpene synthesis pathway. By introducing
  the exogenous PgDDS gene, encoding a dammarenediol synthase, the target compound
  dammarenediol-II was produced from 2,3-oxidosqualene in P. pastoris. The green arrow
  indicated the down-regulated gene (ERG7) and the red arrow indicated the overexpressed
  genes. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the
