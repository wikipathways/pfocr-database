caption: The schematic illustration of BAF312@cRGD-CaP-NPs for tumor treatment through
  downregulating the S1PR1/P-STAT3/VEGFA axis. The BAF312@cRGD-CaP-NPs are gradually
  accumulated at the tumor sites in vivo via the EPR effect and active targeting mediated
  by cRGD and then uptaken by tumor cells and tumor blood vessel cells. Next, the
  nanoparticles release BAF312 in the acidic tumor microenvironment. Finally, BAF312@cRGD-CaP-NPs
  induce tumor cell apoptosis and destroy tumor blood vessel to maximize their antitumor
  efficacy through S1PR1/P-STAT3/VEGFA pathway
