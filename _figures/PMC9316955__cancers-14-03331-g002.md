caption: Key metabolic pathways of M1 and M2 Macrophages. M1 macrophages can first
  be activated by an increase in levels of LPS and IFN-γ, increase in glycolysis,
  and increase in fatty acid synthesis. Due to the increase in glycolysis, the enzymes
  PKME and UPFK2 are upregulated, making more pyruvate and increasing the glycolytic
  metabolism. This increase leads to an increase in PPP, creating more NADPH for ROS
  and NO production. The increase in pyruvate allows more acetyl CoA to enter the
  TCA cycle, increasing the levels of citrate and succinate. Higher citrate levels
  are then used in FAS. Succinate accumulation then regulates HIF1α leading to further
  release of IL-1ß and ROS production. Meanwhile, arginine is converted into NO and
  citrulline via enhanced iNOS activity, further depleting the cell’s arginine levels.
  M2 macrophages are activated by increased IL-4 and IL-10 levels, increased OXPHOS,
  and increased fatty acid oxidation. Lipoproteins go through the fatty acid oxidation
  process and are converted into acetyl-CoA. FAO inhibition can occur by a CPT-1 inhibitor,
  etomoxir. When acetyl-CoA goes through the TCA cycle, ATP, NADH, and FADH2 are made.
  The electron carriers NADH and FADH2 are used in OXPHOS. M2 macrophages also cause
  tryptophan depletion by converting tryptophan into KYN via IDO and TDO enzymes.
  Arginine is also converted into urea and ornithine by enhanced ARG1 activity. Ornithine
  then converts into polyamines using the ODC enzyme. HIF1α, hypoxia-inducible factor
  1α; LPS, Lipopolysaccharide; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; PKM2, pyruvate kinase; UPFK2, ubiquitous 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase;
  TCA, tricyclic cycle; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NO, nitric oxide; α-KG, alpha-ketoglutarate;
  iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; ARG1, arginase-1; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase;
  IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; TDO, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase; KYN, kynurenine.
