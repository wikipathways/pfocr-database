caption: Graphical illustration of the mechanism. SIGLEC11 is upregulated in TAMs.
  Overexpression of SIGLEC11 promotes the polarization of macrophages to M2 phenotype
  by promoting the phosphorylation of AKT–mTOR pathway in macrophages and regulating
  the secretion of macrophages cytokines. Alterations of these immune regulatory elements
  caused by TAMs play a vital role in immunosuppression. SIGLEC, sialic acid-binding
  immunoglobulin-like lectin; TAMs, tumor-associated macrophages
