caption: The pathways where mTORC1 remains activated or its function is bypassed and
  predispose to disease. (A) The mTOR remains activated by insulin and insulin like
  molecules and nutrients such as glucose, amino acids and other environmental factors
  [,,]. (B) Interaction of DAPK1 with TSC1 causes inhibition of mTORC1 suppression.
  Following, the liberated TSC2 from TSC1/TSC2 complex activates mTOR [,,]. (C) Phosphorylation
  of Beclin 1 in its BH3 domain causes dissociation of Beclin 1 from its inhibitors
  Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 to activate autophagy []. (D) During CD 28 signaling the Akt
  kinase activity is repressed therefore alleviating mTORC1 inhibition [,]. (E) Wnt
  pathway activates directly the mTORC1 bypassing GSK3β inhibition []. (F) Deactivation
  of p53 function pause breaks for mTROC1 activity [].
