caption: Model of the Wnt signaling pathway and the role of Mule during its constitutive
  activation. (A) In the absence of Wnt ligand, β-catenin is sequestered by the destruction
  complex. On phosphorylation, β-catenin is ubiquitinated by β-TRCP and degraded by
  the proteasome. No Wnt target genes are transcribed. (B) Wnt associates with Frizzled
  and LRP receptors, resulting in disruption of the destruction complex. R-spondin
  binds to Lgr5, which is believed to also associate with LRP receptors to enhance
  Wnt signaling. β-catenin is free to accumulate in the cytoplasm, translocate into
  the nucleus, and associate with the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor transcription
  factor to activate the transcription of Wnt target genes. (C) During constitutive
  activation of the pathway, as when APC is mutated (black triangle) rendering the
  destruction complex inactive, Mule targets β-catenin for degradation by the proteasome.
