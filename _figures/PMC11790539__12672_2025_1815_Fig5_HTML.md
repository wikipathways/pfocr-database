caption: The ferroptosis signaling pathway. E26 transformation-specific variant 4
  (ETV4) downregulation can lead to SLC7A11 downregulation and increase glutathione
  levels. This process ultimately induces ferroptosis in thyroid cancer cells. Diaryl
  ether derivative, 16 induces ferroptosis in thyroid cancer cells by suppressing
  glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ultimately suppressing thyroid carcinogenesis.
  CircKIF4A enhances GPX4 activity and suppresses lipid peroxidation through the circKIF4A/miR-1231/GPX4
  axis, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis and promoting thyroid carcinogenesis
