caption: Model for the biogenesis of major OMPs in C. glutamicum. After synthesis
  in the CYT and translocation across the PM through Sec-dependent (PorB and PorC)
  or –independent (PorA and PorH) pathways, OMPs are transported into the perisplam
  and acylated with one or several mycolic acids by the cMytC on serine residues located
  within short linear motifs. Specific posttranslational O-mycoloylations of OMPs
  are essential for targeting to the mycomembrane and may be involved in the subsequent
  formation of pore-forming assemblies. Nonacylated proteoforms are released in the
  extracellular medium (EM), but their function remains to be elucidated. AG, arabinogalactan;
  PG, peptidoglycan; M, O-mycoloylation; MM, mycomembrane; PM, plasma membrane; SEC,
  general secretion pathway; TAT, twin arginine translocation pathway.
