caption: Network interaction diagrams of the carotenoid pathways in roses. A. Connection
  network between DEGs and DAMs. B. Connection network between TFs and carotenoid-related
  genes. Yellow squares represent carotenoid-related metabolites. Pale yellow circles
  represent carotenoid-related genes. Blue triangles represent TFs. Black lines and
  green lines represent positive and negative correlations, respectively, as determined
  by a Pearson correlation coefficient |r|> 0.8
papertitle: Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses provide molecular insights
  into the transition of flower color in the rose cultivar ‘Juicy Terrazza’
