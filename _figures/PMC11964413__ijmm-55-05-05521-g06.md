caption: A proposed mechanism suggests that ABCG8 upregulation in RT-R-MDA-MB-231
  cells mediates cholesterol efflux, leading to increased cancer cell progression
  through the LRP6/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in RT-R-MDA-MB-231 cells. Induced
  HIF-1α in RT-R-MDA-MB-231 cells increases SREBP1 (mature form) and FASN, resulting
  in the production of cholesterol. Produced cholesterol is exported by ABCG8 to activate
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling through LRP6 receptors. Activated β-catenin can induce the
  expression of target genes such as PLK1 and Cyclin B1, ultimately leading to increased
  proliferation of cancer cells and tumor growth. ABCG8, ATP-binding cassette subfamily
  G member 8; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; FASN, fatty acid synthase; HIF-1α,
  hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; LRP6, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
  6; PLK1, Polo-like kinase 1; RT-R, radiotherapy-resistant; SREBP1, sterol regulatory
  element binding protein 1
