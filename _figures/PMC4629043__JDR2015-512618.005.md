caption: Pathways of NADH production during glucose combustion. These are the glycolytic
  pathway, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and the TCA cycle. Under diabetic conditions,
  the polyol pathway also becomes a significant pathway for NADH production that can
  further perturb the redox balance between NADH and NAD+.
