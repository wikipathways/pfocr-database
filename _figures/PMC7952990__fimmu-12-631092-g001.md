caption: Oxidative stress leads to impaired GR function through proinflammatory signaling.
  (A) Ozone inhalation generates ROS inducing release of alarmins through lipid peroxidation
  and proinflammatory activation of immune cells in the respiratory mucosal tissue.
  (B) IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-23 activate the RORγt proinflammatory signaling pathway
  that leads to mRNA activation of the IL-17A and IL-22 genes. The IL-1 family of
  cytokines and the related IL-33 together with IL-17A and IL-22 induce influx and
  activation of neutrophils (, ). In turn, activated neutrophils in the airway mucosal
  tissue will release more ROS. (C) Proinflammatory signaling activates NF-kB that
  in turn inhibits expression and function of the GR. Diminished GR function further
  activates NF-kB forming a vicious proinflammatory cycle. (D) The GR uses non-canonical
  transactivation of the surfactant protein D gene (sftpd) through STAT3. GR function
  impairment in alveolar type II epithelial cells leads to inhibition of the immunoprotective
  SP-D. (E) NF-kB inhibits expression of the GR and interferes with GR function through
  a.) inhibition of GR nuclear translocation b.) steric hindrance of nGRE binding,
  and c.) interference with transcription factor “tethering”.
