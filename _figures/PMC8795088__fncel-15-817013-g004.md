caption: Synaptic changes in the basal ganglia circuitry in HD. In the healthy brain,
  activation of D1-MSNs of the direct pathway (blue) leads to disinhibition of the
  thalamus, which increases excitatory feedback to the motor cortex. Activation of
  the D2-MSNs of the indirect pathway (purple) leads to inhibition of the thalamus,
  which decreases excitatory feedback to the motor cortex. Dopaminergic inputs from
  the SNc produces different outcomes in D1- and D2-MSNs; inhibiting D2-MSNs, while
  exciting D1-MSNs. Early in HD, there is a preferential loss of D2-MSNs leading to
  increased output along the direct pathway, mediated by D1-MSNs. The decreased inhibitory
  output through the indirect pathway and increased output through the direct pathway,
  lead to the development of unwanted, hyperkinetic movements called chorea (GPe,
  Globus pallidus externa; GPi, Globus pallidus interna; STN, Subthalamic Nucleus;
  SNc, Substantia Nigra pars compacta). Template taken and modified with BioRender.com.
