caption: The biosynthetic pathway in R. serpentina plant cells leading to the antiarrhythmic
  monoterpenoid indole alkaloid ajmaline through the indolenine intermediate vomilenine
  is shown. This intermediate can be formed by deglucosylation of the glucoalkaloid
  raucaffricine, which is catalyzed by raucaffricine glucosidase (RG). In a side-route
  of the pathway, vomilenine also serves as a precursor of perakine, which is in turn
  reduced by the NADPH-dependent perakine reductase (PR), producing the alkaloid raucaffrinoline
  (shown in the dotted box). The conversion of vomilenine into perakine is easily
  achieved chemically under acidic conditions, but the enzyme catalyzing this reaction
  has not yet been detected. Other enzymes involved in the pathway and for which three-dimensional
  structures have recently been analyzed in detail are strictosidine synthase (STR1),
  strictosidine glucosidase (SG) and vinorine synthase (VS).
