caption: Centrosome aberration-associated molecular pathways in cellular senescence.
  Oxidative stress and several stress-associated regulators activate p53 via phosphorylation
  (forming phosphorylated p53, P-p53) to stimulate the translocation of p53 to centrosomes
  or promote its degradation. Phosphorylation of centrosomal p53 subsequently triggers
  the activation of proteins that modulate the onset of senescence. In addition, dissociation
  of pericentrin or PCM-1 induces permanent exit from the cell cycle that is accompanied
  by an increase in the expression of cellular β-galactosidase, a hallmark of cellular
  senescence. Similarly, disruption of other PCM components, such as Cep192 (which
  recruits NEDD1 to the PCM) and NEDD1 (which recruits γ-tubulin to the PCM), leads
  to centrosome fragmentation and premature entry into the senescence pathway. The
  scissors indicate that p53 cannot translocate into centrosomes
