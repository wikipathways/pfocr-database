caption: Working model for NS action. The model is based on past and present results
  as detailed in Discussion. In brief, stimulation of RSV growth may result from (i)
  subversion of IFN signaling by NS proteins and (ii and iii) suppression of premature
  apoptosis by the NS-dependent PI3K→AKT→NF-κB pathway and NS-independent EGFR→ERK
  pathway. These pathways are incomplete, and multiple crossovers are possible but
  not shown to avoid complexity. Notable among them are sphingosine kinase, which
  mediates the activation of ERK and AKT (), and multiple protein kinase C isoforms
  that play an important role in activating ERK and NF-κB (, ).
