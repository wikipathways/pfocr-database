caption: ROS in HFrEF pathogenesis (created with BioRender.com on 9 February 2022).
  Decrease in O2 and nutrient supply in cardiomyocytes results in ROS overproduction.
  Increase in ROS leads to MMP activation and consequently fibroblast proliferation,
  vacuolar degeneration, excitation-contraction coupled protein oxidation (consequently
  leading to decrease in contractile function of cardiomyocytes) and oxidation of
  mitochondrial OMM and IMM proteins. OMM protein damage results in MAPK pathway activation,
  leading to apoptosis. IMM protein OPA1 oxidation (resulting in inhibition) with
  BNIP3 inhibition by ROS causes mitochondrial fragmentation. Both mitochondrial and
  other cytosol protein oxidation by ROS lead to decrease in ETC protein expression,
  resulting in ATP production decrease, resulting in poor contraction. Hyperacetylation
  of ETC complexes, fatty acid beta-oxidation and TCA cycle proteins lead to inhibition
  of its activity. SIRT, in healthy cardiomyocytes, inhibits hyperacetylation and
  activates AMPK-induced pathway, leading to enzyme-antioxidant synthesis which leads
  to hypertrophy inhibition. Excess of ROS inhibits beneficial SIRT effects. (EF—ejection
  fraction; MMP—matrix metalloproteinase; ROS—reactive oxygen species; BNIP3—mitochondrial
  mitophagy marker; OPA1—optic atrophy 1 protein; DRP1—dynamin-related protein 1;
  MFN2—mitofusin 2; MAPK—mitogen-activated protein kinase; ETC—electron transport
  chain; β-OX—beta-oxidation; SIRT—sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases;
