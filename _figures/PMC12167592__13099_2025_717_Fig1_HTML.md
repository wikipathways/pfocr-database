caption: Schematic representation of the composition of the gut microbiota in healthy
  and disease states. A A healthy gut microbiota is composed by a high taxonomic diversity
  of bacterial species, helping the maintenance of gut homeostasis. B In CRC patients,
  a dysbiotic gut is caused by various factors, such as antibiotic therapy and chemotherapy,
  resulting in the enrichment of pathobionts, such as F. nucleatum, enterotoxigenic
  B. fragilis, C. difficile, and E. coli. These bacteria induce DNA damage and activate
  different antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including macrophages, DCs, neutrophils,
  and T cells, which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-23,
  and TNF-α), and signaling pathways related to inflammation and cancer progression,
  such as the NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Activation of these signaling
  pathways and DNA damage contribute to tumorigenesis. C Gut microbiota dysbiosis
  increases the susceptibility to C. difficile. The adherence of C. difficile to intestinal
  epithelium activates APCs increases levels of cytokines, such asIL-6, IL-8, and
  TNFα, and contributes to neutrophil influx, which determine pseudomembrane formation,
  that characterizes C. difficile colitis. In addition, internalization of toxin TcdA
  and toxin TcdB activate signaling pathways related to inflammation and the release
  of inflammatory cytokines. TcdB may also play a role in tumorigenesis through activating
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling. APCs antigen-presenting cells; BFT Bacteroides fragilis
