caption: Schema summarizing the role of EGFR and ErbB family members in the corneal
  epithelium. (A) Schematic depicting expression of EGFR (ErbB1), ErbB2 (Her2), and
  ErbB3, but not ErbB4, in corneal epithelium. (B) Table summarizing the effects of
  endogenous EGFR ligand on in vitro and in vivo corneal epithelial wound healing.
  (C) Schematic depicting how EGFR endocytic trafficking affects receptor signaling
  in corneal epithelial cells. EGF stimulation promotes internalization of the EGF:EGFR
  complex to the early endosome. During internalization, the receptor is ubiquitylated
  and targeted for trafficking to lysosome for degradation. EGFR degradation can be
  diverted from a degradation pathway by promoting receptor recycling. This can be
  achieved by stimulating with TGFα, a ligand that dissociates in the mildly acidic
  environment of the early endosome and has reduced receptor ubiquitylation, or inhibiting
  the ubiquitin ligases of the EGFR in corneal epithelial cells (i.e., c-Cbl and Cbl-b).
