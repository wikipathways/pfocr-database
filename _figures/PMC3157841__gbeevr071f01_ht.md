caption: (A) Activation of the IS pathway negatively regulates the transcription factor
  DAF-16 by preventing its entry in the nucleus. The IS pathway interacts with multiple
  signal transduction pathways. Redrawn following (), with modifications to include
  additional interactions specified in  and . (B) Linear graph of the insulin/Tor
  pathway used to investigate the impact of the pathway structure on nucleotide divergence.
  Here, we focus on proteins that mediate signal transduction in response to stimuli
  detected by the insulin receptor DAF-2.
