caption: Key components of the canonical insulin signaling pathway. Upon insulin binding,
  the insulin receptor is activated, leading to the phosphorylation of IRS (insulin
  receptor substrate), which then engages the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This pathway
  subsequently activates several downstream effectors, including mTORC1 and GLUT4.
  mTORC1 mediates processes such as protein synthesis and lipid synthesis, while also
  inhibiting lipolysis. Simultaneously, GLUT4 translocates to the cell membrane, facilitating
  glucose uptake, and the pathway promotes glycogen synthesis
