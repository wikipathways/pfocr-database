caption: Bone remodeling is a dynamic process that is completed with the participation
  of BMU. This process is regulated by local intercellular signals and external signaling
  factors. The cellular components of BMU include osteoblasts, reversal cells, and
  bone-lining cells. Osteoblasts are derived from MSCs, a process that is dependent
  on the Wnt pathway and regulated by the transcription factors Runx2 and OSX. Sclerostin
  is a negative regulator of Wnt, which prevents mesenchymal stem cells from differentiating
  into osteoblasts. When the bone is stimulated by mechanical traction or PTH, the
  intracellular PKA and PKC pathways are activated, which initiates bone remodeling
  by inhibiting sclerostin expression and activating the Wnt signaling pathway. Osteoblasts
  stimulate osteoclast precursors to differentiate into mature osteoclasts by secreting
  M-CSF, MCP-1, and RANKL, but they may also inhibit the same cells by secreting OPG
  that scavenges RANKL, preventing it from binding to the RANKL receptors on the osteoclast
  precursors. Then, bone resorption begins, producing Howship’s resorption lacunae.
  After bone matrix resorption, macrophages produce MMPs to degrade and remove the
  bone matrix, and the release of active TGF-β and IGF-1 triggers osteoblasts to form
  a new collagen matrix in Howship’s resorption lacunae and fill the absorption space.
  Finally, the remodeling cycle ends when an equal amount of resorbed bone is replaced.
  In the bone reconstruction of healthy people, there was no change in bone mass and
  strength at the end of each reconstruction cycle. However, under some pathological
  conditions, such as osteoporosis, both bone mass and strength are decreased
