caption: Mechanisms of PD-L1 expression through NF-κB. (A) Oncogene-related mechanisms.
  MUC1 and EGFR up-regulate PD-L1 expression by activating NF-κB pathway. These pathways
  are intertwined with EMT. HPV modulates PD-L1 expression triggering STING that in
  turn activates NF-κB. (B) Inflammatory cytokine-related mechanisms. Tumor-infiltrating
  immune cells can produce several cytokines regulating PD-L1 expression. Two well-known
  cytokines acting via NF-κB pathway are TNFα produced by TAMs and IFN-γ produced
  by tumor infiltrating T and NK cells. (C) Drug- and stress-related mechanisms. Different
  drugs act on NF-κB transcriptional activity (e.g., Palblociclib). Stress response
  to UVR activates NF-κB, thus mediating PD-L1 up-regulation. Blue arrows indicate
  activation of NF-kB pathway; black arrows indicate NF-κB-mediated PD-L1 up-regulation;
  red T-arrows indicate negative regulation. EGFR, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;
