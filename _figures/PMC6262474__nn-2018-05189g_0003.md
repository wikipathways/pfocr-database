caption: Synthesis of the dual-delivery DOX/IND-Liposome. (A) Schematic to show that
  the carrier is synthesized by self-assembly of an IND prodrug to form a liposome,
  which is subsequently loaded with DOX. The synthesis commences by conjugating IND
  to a single chain phospholipid [1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
  (PL)] to derive the IND-PL prodrug, as previously described by us. The three-step
  synthesis process is schematically depicted in Figure S3. The prodrug is mixed with
  cholesterol and DSPE-PEG2K to form a lipid film for the construction of liposomes.
  (B) Schematic to outline the liposome synthesis steps. Briefly, the lipid film comprised
  of IND-PL, cholesterol, and DSPE-PEG2K at a molar ratio of 70:25:5, was hydrated
  in a (NH4)2SO4 solution, followed by sonication and removal of free (NH4)2SO4. DOX
  was remotely loaded by using a proton gradient, as shown in the bottom panel. (NH4)2SO4
  dissociates into protons, NH3 and SO42–. DOX is a weak basic molecule that is capable
  of diffusing across the IND-PL lipid bilayer into the liposome, where it is converted
  to a (DOX-NH3)2SO4 precipitate, incapable of back diffusion across the lipid bilayer.
  (C) Side-by-side comparison of DOX/IND-Liposome and Dox-NP for drug loading capacity,
  size, polydispersity, charge, and endotoxin levels (n = 3). (D) CryoEM pictures
  to show the morphological similarity between Dox-NP and IND-Liposome, including
  the presence of the drug precipitate.
