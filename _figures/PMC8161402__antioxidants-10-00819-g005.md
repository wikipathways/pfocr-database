caption: Schematic view of the roles of MsrA and MsrAB on B. cereus physiology under
  anaerobic fermentative conditions. MsrA has a more important role in fermentative
  metabolism, compared to MsrAB (thick green vs. thin blue solid arrows). The role
  of MsrA could be as important as the role of MsrAB in maintaining Met(O) levels
  of virulence factors, such as flagella and enterotoxins (green and blue dotted arrows).
  PTS, phosphotransferase system; PP, pentose phosphate pathway. Succinate is formed
  via the reductive TCA cycle.
