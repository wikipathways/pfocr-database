caption: Main interaction sites of anticancer metal complexes with cellular redox
  and oxidative stress pathways. Several metal compounds produce directly reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and activate several ROS-dependent signaling and protection
  pathways (e.g., mediated by stress responsive transcription factors Nrf2, NF-κB,
  and AP-1). Sustained stress can induce apoptosis, for example, via the intrinsic
  mitochondrial pathway resulting in caspase-mediated cell death. Beside ROS-induced
  DNA damage, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation also direct interactions with
  redox-regulatory mechanisms can disturb cellular redox homeostasis. Examples are
  the interaction of metal complexes with the thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione (GSH)
  systems in the cytosol as well as in other cellular compartments such as mitochondria
  and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Further, direct DNA damage by metal complexes and
  induction of ER stress due to accumulation of misfolded proteins can again lead
  to apoptosis (e.g., mediated by the transcription factors p53 and CHOP, respectively,
  as well as Ca2+ release after ER stress) and/or p53-mediated cell cycle arrests.
  In general, the different pathways are highly cross-linked and metal compounds target
  different sites. Metal complexes are indicated in bold face; cellular compartments
  in italic face; TrxR, thioredoxin reductase; TPx, thioredoxin peroxidases; GPx,
  glutathione peroxidases; GR, glutathione reductase; SOD, superoxide dismutase.
