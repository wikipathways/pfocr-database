caption: Overview of the two pathways that collect and deliver axonal cargo for degradation
  in lysosomes. Neurons pose a highly compartmentalized morphology endowed with a
  dendritic tree, the soma and a very long axon (in orange), and are decorated by
  many synaptic contacts (inset). Synapses are sites with high turnover rates and
  metabolic demands, where elements of autophagy, endolysosomal system and proteasomal-mediated
  degradation are present. Two main degradative pathways exist in axons that deliver
  cargo to lysosomes (described in the lower box) localized in the soma. In autophagy,
  autophagosome formation is initiated at distal axons at the phagophore assembly
  site (PAS). Cargo is sequestered by the phagophore which closes generating autophagosomes
  that are decorated by the autophagy adaptor LC3b-II. Autophagosomes are retrogradely
  transported in a dynein-dependent manner to the soma, where they fuse with degradative
  lysosomes generating autolysosomes. The endolysosomal pathway typically receives
  cargo from the plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and its fate is
  decided in early-endosomes (EE), organelles abundant in Rab5. Cargo is recycled
  back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes (RE) or is sent for degradation
  upon internalization into intraluminal vesicles by the ESCRT complex present in
  late endosomes (LE) and multivesicular bodies (MVB). EE matures into LE/MVB that
  are Rab7-positive. Cargo is then degraded in endolysosomes that originate from the
  fusion of LE/MVB with lysosomes. Amphisomes are generated upon the fusion of LE/MVB
  with autophagosomes and this is a necessary step for the acquisition of retrograde
  motors by autophagosomes. Ub ubiquitinated receptors
