caption: Anthocyanin and flavonol biosynthetic pathway.  The enzymes in bold represent
  the core genes of flavonoid biosynthesis.  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H,
  cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL,  4-coumarate-coenzyme A ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone  isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid  3′-hydroxylase;
  F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase; DFR,  dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; AS, anthocyanidin
  synthase; UF3GT,  UDP-glucose flavonoid 3-oxy-glucosyl transferase; RT, rhamnosyl  transferase.
  Also shown within the box associated with enzyme  designations are the gene super
  families from which particular enzymes  are thought to be derived.
