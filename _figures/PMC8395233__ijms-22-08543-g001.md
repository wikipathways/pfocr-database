caption: 'Following an acute ischemic stroke, VEGF, whose expression is enhanced,
  binds with VEGFR2 and triggers various signaling pathways in endothelial cells.
  For instance, the VEGFR2–PKC pathway may activate the transcription factor of VEGF
  and HIF-1α. Next, the PI3K–Akt pathway phosphorylates eNOS and activates eNOS enzymatic
  functions leading to NO production. Oxidative stress mediates ROS production. ROS
  reacts with NO to synthesize peroxynitrite (ONOO−). ROS signaling inhibits PHD2
  activity, leading to HIF-1a protein stabilization and activation of NF-κB protein,
  consequently upregulating expression of downstream genes related to NF-κB, such
  as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. ONOO− modifies VE-cadherin protein by
  nitrosylation of serine residues, resulting in the detachment of VE-cadherin from
  endothelial cells. Finally, the VEGFR2-mediated Src–Rac1–PAK pathway phosphorylates
  VE-cadherin, resulting in dissociation with the adherence junction between endothelial
  cells. Oxidative stress-mediated reduction in the expression of tight junction proteins
  also initiates BBB breakdown and monocyte infiltration. HIF-1α- and NF-κB-mediated
  gene expression facilitates BBB breakdown, inflammatory responses, and glial scarring.
