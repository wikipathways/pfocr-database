caption: The relative contribution of glyceroneogenesis and of glucose by the  direct
  and indirect (via lactate) pathways and its impact on the  14C/3H ratio of C-1 and
  C-3 of triglyceride  glycerol. The box represents the labeling pattern of G-3-P  derived
  from [14C]glucose, [3H]pyruvate, and  [14C]lactate. When G-3-P is formed from [14C]glucose,  all
  the carbons of G-3-P will be equally labeled with 14C. In  contrast, 3H, as a result
  of equilibrium in the triosephosphate  pool (), will appear on  C-1 and C-2 and
  not C-3. G-3-P formed from pyruvate will not have any  14C label, whereas the hydrogens
  on C-1, C-2, and C-3 will be  completely labeled with 3H. On a stoichiometric equivalent
  basis,  G-3-P formed from 1 molecule of glucose and 2 molecules of pyruvate will
  have  a 14C/3H ratio on C-1 of 2 14C/8  3H = 0.25 and on C-3 of 2 14C/4 3H = 0.5.  14C
  of glucose can also be incorporated into G-3-P via  [14C]lactate. However, as a
  result of randomization and the  exchange of label in the TCA cycle, [14C]lactate
  entering the  triose phosphate pool will have less label on C-1 relative to C-2
  and C-3.  Therefore, as the contribution of recycled glucose (via lactate) to G-3-P  increases,
  there will be an increase in the 14C/3H ratio  on C-3 and a decrease of the ratio
  on C-1. Thus, a high glyceroneogenic flux,  relative to glycolytic flux, will result
  in a high  14C/3H ratio on C-3 (or C-1 + C-3) as compared with that  on C-1. Carbons
  labeled with 14C are highlighted in  blue, and hydrogens labeled with 3H are  highlighted
  in red. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
