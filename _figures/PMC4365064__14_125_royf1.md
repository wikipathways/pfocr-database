caption: Autonomic regulation of cardiac function. (1) Baroreceptors in the carotid
  arteries and aortic arch monitor arterial pressure. Increased arterial pressure
  activates signaling to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) and reduces sympathetic
  output and simultaneously activates the parasympathetic nervous system. A decrease
  in arterial pressure has the opposite effect. (2) Activation of sympathetic nerves
  leads to positive chronotropic and inotropic responses as well as arteriolar constriction.
  (3) Activation of the parasympathetic system via the vagus nerve leads to negative
  chronotropy and lusitropy. (4) The cardiac NNCS amplifies parasympathetic cholinergic
  signaling and regulates heart rate recovery after activity. In addition, the cardiomyocyte-derived
  ACh prevents cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy under physiological conditions.
  (5) Vagus and/or sympathetic splanchnic nerve stimulation leads to activation of
  the antiinflammatory pathway, which involves secretion of nonneuronal ACh from splenic
  T cells. This T cell–derived ACh activates α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
  (α7nAChRs) on macrophages and inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines.
