caption: 'Comparison of different pathways for the production of amino acid monomers
  from chorismate. Chorismic acid is converted to prephenic acid (upper pathway) by
  the action of chorismate mutases (e.g: AroQ, PheA, TyrA). The canonical aromatic
  decarboxylation produces aromatic amino acids (prephenate dehydratase (Pht) for
  Phe and prephenate dehydrogenase (Phd) for Tyr). An unusual nonaromatic decarboxylation
  of prephenate is catalyzed by a group of prephenate decarboxylases (PDXs) which
  include BacA (anticapsin in bacilysin), SalX (tetrahydro-phenylalanine (H4Phe) in
  salinisporamide) and AerD (Choi in aeruginoside 126A). In secondary metabolism,
  chorismic acid is converted to 8 by a 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase (such as
  CmlB (chloramphenicol) and SvnN (stravidin)). Similar to the upper pathway, 8 rearranges
  to 9 by the action of a mutase (CmlD (chloramphenicol) and SvnK (stravidin)). In
  chloramphenicol biosynthesis, a typical aromatic decarboxylation is catalyzed by
  CmlC, followed by an aminotransferase to give the monomer p-amino phenyl alanine.
  However, for Acm (4), a unique nonaromatic decarboxylation retains the 1,4 cyclohexadiene
  functionality as in the prephenate skeletal structure, and we propose a novel PDX
  is catalyzing this step. Unusual nonaromatic decarboxylation pathways are highlighted.'
