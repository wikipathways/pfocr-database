caption: Various small molecules interact with shared ADs genes suggesting that SNPs
  in these genes could be modulated through these factors. This networking also demonstrates
  that current drugs those are used to treat various ADs interact with these newly
  associated genes. Susceptible gene with risk allele carrying patients could be better
  benefitted with the specific drug that interacts with that gene. Associated genes
  (dark blue), interconnecting genes (light blue), small molecules and miRNAs (red
  and orange respectively).
