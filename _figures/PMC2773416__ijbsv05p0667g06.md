caption: 'Diagrammatic representation of intracellular pathways that lead to the production
  of IL-12p40 and the mechanisms of azithromycin (AZM) to inhibit the expression of
  IL-12p40 upon the stimulation of LPS/IFN-γ. (A) Inflammatory stimulation leads to
  the activation of various signal transduction cascades in cells. Binding of LPS
  and toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 activates NF-κB. Soon after occurring LPS/TLR-4 signaling,
  IKB is degraded in this process. Subsequently, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus,
  and binds to its binding motif in promoter region of IL-12p40. Moreover, LPS/TLR-4
  signaling results in the activation of MAPK pathway, which leads to the phosphorylation
  of activator protein (AP)-1, such as JunB. Phosphorylated AP-1 binds to its binding
  motif in the promoter. Binding of IFN-γ and its receptor activates JAK-STAT pathways,
  and other pathways, such as PI3K and Pyk2. Activated STAT1 phosphorylates ICSBP.
  In this cellular activation process, calcium influx is induced, and elevated intracellular
  concentration of calcium activates calcineurin. Then, NFAT is dephosphorylated by
  activated calcineurin, and subsequently translocates into the nucleus. NFAT heterodimerizes
  with ICSBP, and this heterodimer binds to the binding motif in promoter. Activated
  PI3K and Pyk2 also activate the MAPK pathway. (B) In the presence of AZM, the phosphorylation
  of ICSBP and JunB is inhibited. This inhibition results in the reduced binding capacity
  of ICSBP/NFAT and JunB to their DNA binding motif in the IL-12p40 promoter, and
  IL-12p40 gene expression is suppressed. It was also reported that AZM inhibits NF-κB
  pathway by reducing the degradation of IKB (reference 23). Abbreviations: ICSBP,
  interferon consensus sequence binding protein; IKB, inhibitor of κB; JAK, Janus
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary
  response gene 88; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Pyk2, calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase; STAT1,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 1; TAK1, transforming growth factor-beta-activated
  kinase 1; TRA6, TNF receptor-associated factor 6.'
