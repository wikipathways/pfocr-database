caption: Multicompartmental modeling of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) synthesis
  and secretion from HepG2 cells. A schematic representation of the assembly and secretion
  of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins from hepatocytes (A). Secretion of apoB-100-containing
  lipoproteins requires the assembly of apoB, triglyceride (TG), free cholesterol,
  cholesteryl ester (CE), and phospholipid (PL) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
  Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is an absolute requirement for apoB
  secretion, facilitating the transfer of TG, CE, and PL to apoB as well as accretion
  of ER luminal TG for subsequent transfer to apoB. Assembly and secretion of apoB-100
  involves a) apoB mRNA transcription and translation, b) translocation of apoB-100
  across the ER membrane, and either c) association of apoB-100 with core and surface
  lipid via MTP and transport through the secretory pathway into plasma, or d) intracellular
  degradation via the cytoplasmic proteasome or luminal proteases. A diagram of the
  multicompartmental kinetic model used for analysis of apoB secretion and intracellular
  degradation (B). Compartments 1 to 5 and 7 are within the HepG2 cell. Compartment
  6 represents apoB in the culture media. Compartments 1 and 2 represent an intracellular
  pool of tracer and a delay compartment to allow for apoB synthesis after introduction
  of the tracer, respectively. Compartment 3 represents newly synthesized apoB. A
  parameter termed “Init” calculated by the model represents the amount of radioactive
  apoB-100 entering the system (initially compartment 3) required to achieve the tracer
  curve for total apoB (cell plus media) measured experimentally. ApoB-100 from compartment
  3 may be transferred to compartment 4 and subsequently secreted. From compartment
  4, apoB passes through a delay, compartment 5, before secretion into the media,
  compartment 6. ApoB may be degraded directly from compartment 3 by a rapid degradation
  pathway. A second, more slowly turning over pool of apoB destined for degradation
  is represented by compartment 7. The shaded compartments represent the compartments
  containing apoB radioactivity that were determined experimentally.
