caption: Toward better understanding of the mechanism of this hydroarylation reaction,
  the kinetic isotope effect studies were performed. The experiments on cyclization
  of 3, together with its protio analog 1b, and 5 revealed a substantial intermolecular
  (kH/kD=2.6) and intramolecular (kH/kD=3.5) kinetic isotope effect (). These data
  are in the range of the the isotope effects found in the Pd-catalyzed arylations
  proceeding via a C-H activation pathways. Based on these observations, we propose
  the following mechanism for this reaction (). According to the path a, upon the
  ortho-palladation of 1, the intermediate 8 is produced, which undergoes a migratory
  insertion to the triple bond to give a vinylpalladium species 9. Protiodepalladation
  of intermediate 9 produces fluerene 2 and regenerates the catalyst. Alternative
  pathway (path b) involves the formation of palladium hydride species 10, which upon
  carbopalladation of the triple bond produces intermediate 11. Consecutive reductive
  elimination gives the desired fluorenone 2. However, this pathway is considered
  to be less likely due to a substantial loss of the deuterium observed in the cyclization
  of 3. The Friedel-Crafts-type mechanism, which potentially could account for the
  cyclization of 1, was ruled out based on both the higher propensity of the electron-deficient
  biaryls in this hydroarylation reaction and the high values of the obtained kinetic
  isotope effects. The observed stereoselectivity of reaction also contradicts with
  the electrophilic mechanism. It should be mentioned that according to the literature
  reports,–, the Friedel-Crafts cyclization of biaryl 1 should proceed in trans-fashion,
  resulting in the formation of (Z)-fluorene (). However, the hydroarylation reaction,
  described herein, produces fluorenes with the alternative geometry of the double
  bond, thus strongly supporting the cis-cyclization pathway (, ).
