caption: Inferred pathway of irinotecan. Small rectangles and ellipses are instances
  of continuants and molecular events, respectively. Large rectangles such as small
  intestine are the compartments. Molecular event and trigger, situator, and resultant
  were connected by solid lines. Each molecular event was connected by the shared
  continuants. For example, TR0000020 and TR0000002 in the small intestine were connected
  because they share the same instance of SN-38. This connection can be interpreted
  as that irinotecan is metabolized into SN-38 (TR0000020) and then SN-38 is transported
  to the intestinal lumen. (This figure was generated by our inference system.).
