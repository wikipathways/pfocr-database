caption: The conventional metabolic pathways that generate NADH from NAD+. Shown are
  the glycolytic pathway, fatty acid oxidation, and the Krebs cycle. These are the
  major pathways that store electrons in NADH by breaking the chemical bonds in dietary
  components including glucose, fatty acids. Enzymes involved in direct production
  of NADH are also indicated in the diagram.
