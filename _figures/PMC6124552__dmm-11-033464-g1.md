caption: General metabolic features of cancer stem cells and mature cancer cells (non-CSCs).
  (A) Cancer stem cells tend to rely more on glycolysis for ATP synthesis, with overexpression
  of the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3, and increased expression of hexokinase
  2 (HK2), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFKFB), pyruvate kinase
  isozyme M2 (PKM2) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Nucleotide biosynthesis is often
  increased in cancer stem cells owing to overexpression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD) and amino acid synthesis. Glutamine uptake and metabolization to oxaloacetate,
  together with fatty acid oxidation, also appear to be important mechanisms in cancer
  stem cells. (B) In contrast, mature cancer cells tend to rely more on OXPHOS for
  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, leading to increased levels of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS); these cells show low levels of glycolysis and nucleotide synthesis,
  although this can vary. ASCT2, alanine, serine, cysteine-preferring transporter
  2; CPT1, carnitine-dependent transporter 1; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; Glut, glucose
  transporter (GLUT1 or GLUT3); GOT, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
