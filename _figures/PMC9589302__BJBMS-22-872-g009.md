caption: Schematic showing the possible mechanism of an IRAK1/4 inhibitor in relieving
  colitis. In the intestine, normal intestinal flora are found in the intestinal lumen,
  the outermost layer of the intestinal mucus, the central layer of intestinal epithelial
  cells (the most critical barrier proteins such as TJS form a barrier between cells),
  and the innermost layer of the lamina, which are infused with various immune cells.
  After DSS induction, an inflammatory response is activated through the TLR4/NF-κB
  pathway, destroying the intestinal barrier, suppressing pathway activation, and
  maintaining barrier stability. Part of this diagram refers to Li C, Ai G, Wang Y,
  et al. doi:10.1016/j.phrs.2019.104603.
