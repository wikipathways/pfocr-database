caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the differentially expressed angiogenic
  factors. The top panel shows data analysis of all compared study groups. The middle
  panel shows comparisons of healthy controls against all T2D patients compiled (with
  and without CAD), and the bottom panel shows comparisons between healthy T2D and
  the ones with CAD compiled. A, D, G Top networks and associated diseases/functions,
  with scores and associated molecules, obtained from IPA. B, E, H Representation
  of the most highly rated network in IPA. Highlighted are the differentially expressed
  molecules and relationships where the interaction is direct. C, F, I IPA prediction
  of the interactive network associated with the differentially expressed proteins
  in relation to CAD and their effect on endothelial function. Green: decreased measurement,
  blue: predicted inhibition, Orange: predicted activation. Straight-line: direct
  interaction, segmented line: indirect relationship. Data was generated by QIAGEN’s
  Ingenuity ® Pathway Analysis application (www.qiagen.com/ingenuity)'
