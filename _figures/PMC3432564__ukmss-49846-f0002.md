caption: Transmembrane CLRs involved in antifungal immunity and their intracellular
  signaling pathways. Dectin-1, Dectin-2 and Mincle induce intracellular signaling
  via tyrosine (Y)-based activation motifs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motifs or ITAMs) which recruit and activate Syk-kinase either directly, or indirectly
  through the FcγR adaptor chain. Signaling through protein-kinase C (PKC)δ, this
  pathway activates the Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 complex inducing gene transcription and
  the production of various inflammatory mediators. DC-SIGN and Dectin-1 can signal
  via the Raf-1 kinase pathway which modulates (dotted line) other signaling pathways,
  including those induced by the Toll-like receptors (TLR) and the Dectin-1/ Syk pathway.
  The mannose receptor (MR) can also induce intracellular signaling, but the mechanisms
  involved are unknown. CLR signaling can collaborate with that of the TLR (red bi-arrow),
  to synergistically induce or repress the induction of various cytokines and chemokines.
  CLR can also mediate fungal phagocytosis and induction of anti-microbial effector
  mechanisms (not shown).
