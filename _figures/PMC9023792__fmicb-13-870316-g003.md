caption: Therapeutic strategies based on viral modulation and pathological outcome
  of HH signaling. HBV, HCV, HDV, EBV (nasopharyngeal carcinoma), HPV, HTLV-1, MCPyV,
  and KSHV aberrantly activate HH signaling and drive multistep tumor development
  (pathway ➀). HIV (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and EBV (gastric cancer)
  also activate HH signaling, which contributes to immune suppression (pathway ➁).
  HIV (HIV-associated nephropathy), IAV, and HIV (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder)
  disturb tissue homeostasis by induction of either increased or decreased HH signaling
  (pathway ➂). ZIKA infection results in disruption of embryonic development by inactivation
  of HH signaling (pathway ➃). HTLV-1 and HCV hijack HH signaling and facilitate viral
  transcription and replication (pathway ➄). To reverse viral modulation and restore
  to the normal activity of HH signaling, SMO/GLI inhibitors could be applied to the
  scenarios of ➀, ➁, ➂, and ➄ (blunt arrows in blue), while SMO agonists could be
  applied to the scenarios of ➂ and ➂ (sharp arrows in red). Alternatively, chemical
  inhibitors could also target viral proteins that crosstalk with HH signaling or
  their interactions for blockage (blunt arrows in green).
