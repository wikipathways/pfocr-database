caption: Competition between MMEJ and other DSB repair pathways. MMEJ, as an alternative
  nonhomologous end-joining pathway, competes with C-NHEJ, especially when the KU
  family is defective. It could also be possible that losing DNApk subunits or blocking
  ATM phosphorylation of DNApk would lead to defective C-NHEJ but elevated MMEJ. In
  the S phase of the cell cycle, initial resection will be the key step in promoting
  both HR and MMEJ, and the synthetic lethal relationship between HR and MMEJ could
  mainly occur in the S phase. In addition, several important factors, such as PARP1,
  may contribute to initial resection and promote MMEJ, and POLQ could functionally
  inhibit RAD51 [] filaments, leading to less HR. In telomeres, MMEJ helps to repair
  most DSBs and does not generate fragile telomeres; however, it does cause telomere
  fusion. Instead, BIR would form fragile telomeres, which could be repaired better
  by MMEJ factors, such as PARP1 and ligase III.
