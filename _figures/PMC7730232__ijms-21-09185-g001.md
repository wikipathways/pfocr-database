caption: 'The metabolic pathway to bacterial cellulose biosynthesis in Komagataeibacter
  and example metabolic engineering interventions made in key papers. Native pathways
  from glucose to central carbon metabolism (growth) are shown as blue arrows. The
  native pathway to cellulose biosynthesis via the BcsABCD machinery (synthesis) is
  shown as black arrows. Heterologous expression of a 3-gene GlcNAc utilization pathway
  by Yadav et al. to produce chitin-cellulose co-polymers is shown as green arrows
  []. Interventions made by Gwon et al. to boost cellulose production are indicated
  in red; red arrow shows insertion of a pfkA enzyme, red asterisks show altered regulation
  of these genes via overexpression of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) regulator [].
  Interventions made by Hur et al. to boost cellulose production are highlighted in
  yellow: expression of enzymes encoded by the galU, ndp and pgm genes are optimized
  by RBS tuning []. Interventions made by Jang et al. are highlighted in orange: heterologous
  expression is used to boost enzyme levels encoded by pgi and gnd []. Genomic deletion
  of the gdh gene by Liu et al. to reduce gluconic acid bi-product formation is shown
  as a purple X []. Metabolite abbreviations; Glu-6-phos: glucose-6-phosphate; 6PGL:
  6-phosphogluconolactone; 6PGC: 6-phosphogluconate; Fru-6-phos: fructose-6-phosphate;
  Fru-1-6P: fructose-1,6-diphosphate; DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
