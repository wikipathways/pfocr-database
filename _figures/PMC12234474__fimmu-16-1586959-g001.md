caption: This figure presents the link between glycolysis, TCA cycle and glutamine
  metabolism. Glutamine is transported into cells via ASCT2/SLC1A5, and leucine activates
  mTORC1 for cell growth, which is inhibited by Torin1. Glutamine is partly used for
  amino acid/protein synthesis, partly into the mitochondria via GDH to participate
  in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which is regulated by HIF-1α and Sirt4. In glycolysis,
  glucose undergoes a series of enzymatic reactions to form pyruvate, which can enter
  the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and its product, citric acid, is used in lipid and
  amino acid synthesis, etc. It can also participate in the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway. Created in https://BioRender.com
