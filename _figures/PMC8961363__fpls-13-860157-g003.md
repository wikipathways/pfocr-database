caption: Fatty acid derivative biosynthetic pathway. Fatty acid precursors (linoleic
  and linolenic acids) enter the LOX pathway and are converted to 9- and 13-hydroperoxide,
  which are oxidized and converted to volatiles by hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) and alcohol
  dehydrogenase (ADH). AAT, alcohol acyltransferase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; AOS,
  allene oxide synthase; HPL, hydroperoxide lyase; LOX, lipoxygenase; PUFAs, polyunsaturated
  fatty acids.
