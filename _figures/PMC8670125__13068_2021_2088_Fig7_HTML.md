caption: 'Overview of putative carbon metabolism involving the induced mitochondria-mediated
  C4-like CCM in LC-cultivated P. tricornutum. This proposed metabolic map was based
  on enzymic activity, transcriptional abundances, predicted subcellular location
  and proteomic analysis. The upregulated enzymes are indicated by red color, and
  the downregulated enzymes are indicated by green color, while the non-detected enzymes
  are indicated by grey color. Red arrow and green arrow indicate the increase or
  decrease activity (or transcriptional abundances) of the enzyme under LC conditions,
  respectively. Predicted subcellular localization of P. tricornutum genes related
  to the biophysical CCM, C4-like-CCM, central carbon metabolism, photorespiration,
  the ornithine–urea cycle and PYR metabolism are listed in an additional excel sheet
