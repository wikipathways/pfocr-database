caption: 'The role of autophagy in cancer initiation, progression, and treatment.
  (A) Apart from its ambiguous role in normal mammary development and differentiation
  (D&D), autophagy influences virtually each step of cancer progression in a context-dependent
  manner. (B) Under normal conditions, high autophagic activity is predominantly cytoprotective
  and hence prevents cancer initiation. At the same time, autophagy facilitates the
  maintenance of CD44+/ALDH+ BCSC population. (C) During carcinogenesis, autophagy
  is frequently hijacked to support tumor expansion by promoting activation of the
  Ras pathway and the NRF2 oncogene, particularly in TNBC. However, inhibitory effects
  are often seen, which are here exemplified by the contribution of autophagy to block
  HER2- and WNT1-driven mammary tumorigenesis. (D) It is also evident that high autophagy
  activity may limit EMT traits, since several EMT-transcription factors are degraded
  via autophagy, including SNAIL and TWIST. In contrast, the inhibition of anoikis
  in malignant cells and accelerated cell migration (due to turnover of focal adhesions)
  were also attributed to enforced autophagy. (E) Furthermore, high levels of autophagy
  maintain the dormancy of the BCSCs, which is a main source of disease relapse, protecting
  them from metabolic stress. (F) Commonly induced autophagic activity upon anti-cancer
  therapy leads to an excessive autophagy potentiating drug cytotoxicity via the AMPK/mTOR/ULK
  pathway. In contrast, increased autophagy activates ERK and p53 signaling to limit
  the effect of chemotherapeutics, facilitating drug resistance. Green: tumor-suppressive
  roles, red: oncogenic roles. Created with BioRender.com, accessed on 3 May 2021.'
