caption: 'The intestinal enterocyte is a gatekeeper of cholesterol balance with two
  opposing pathways delivering cholesterol from opposite sides of this polarized cell.
  First, the cholesterol absorption pathway is initiated by NPC1L1-dependent delivery
  of dietary and biliary cholesterol to the ER, where it is packaged into nascent
  chylomicron particles for delivery into the lymphatics. Directly opposing the absorptive
  pathway, TICE flux is driven by the delivery of liver-derived apoB-containing lipoproteins
  that are taken up by the LDL receptor and likely other receptors. Once internalized
  these lipoproteins are trafficked through endosomal and lysosomal compartments,
  and ultimately effluxed from the apical membrane through ABCG5/ABCG8, ABCB1a/b,
  and likely other transporter. A portion of this newly effluxed cholesterol can be
  excreted into the feces. Collectively, these two opposing influx pathways (absorption
  and TICE) along with endogenous cholesterol synthesis comprise the total enterocyte
  cholesterol pool. Abbreviations used: ABCB1a/b = ATP-binding cassette transporter
  1a/b; ABCG5/G8 = ATP-binding cassette transporters G5 and G8; apoB = apolipoprotein
  B; ER = endoplasmic reticulum; LDLR = low density lipoprotein receptor; NPC1L1 =
  Niemann-Pick C1-like 1; TICE = transintestinal cholesterol excretion; ? = unknown
  receptor mediating the uptake of TICE lipoproteins.'
