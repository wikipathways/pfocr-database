caption: 'Strategies to overcome anti-angiogenic therapy resistance. Resistance to
  anti-angiogenic drugs in lung cancer (right) could be delayed by (1) the natural
  compound EGCG, which exerts its antiangiogenic effect by suppressing the expression
  of VEGF-A and HIF-1α and increasing the expression of angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin
  in cancer cells; (2) the combination of bevacizumab with immunotherapy, such as
  the adoptive transfer of cytokine-induced killer cells; (3) the inhibition of angiogenic
  VEGFR co-receptors NP1 and NP2 through histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA; (4) the
  inhibition of the translation of VEGF-A mRNA in lung cancer cell and VEGFR-2 and
  VEGFR-3 mRNA in endothelial cells with microRNA-128; and (5) the use of the multi
  tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib, which targets VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, PDGF,
  and FGFR. On the other hand, for breast cancer (right), the strategies to overcome
  anti-angiogenic therapy resistance include (1) the use of green tea extract EGCG
  to decrease the expression of VEGF transcription modulator PKC; (2) the combination
  of antiangiogenic antibody CVX-241 with the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1)
  antibody; (3) the combination of bevacizumab with camptothecin which inhibits HIF-1α;
  (4) the use of epigenetic modulator SAHA to suppress VEGF-C expression; (5) the
  blocking of chemokine CCL18, which is secreted by TAM, and CCL18 receptor on endothelial
  cells; and (6) the inhibition of the signal transduction pathway of VEGFR2 in endothelial
  cells through the down-regulation of signaling regulators (Ephrin type-B receptor
  2) EphB2 and Disabled homolog 2 (Dab2). Abbreviations: EGCG, epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HIF-1α, hypoxia inducible factor-1α; SAHA,
  suberanilohydroxamic acid; HDAC, histone deacetylase; NP1, neuropilin1; NP2, neuropilin2;
  miR, microRNA; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; FGFR, fibroblast growth
  factor receptor; Ang2, angiopoietin 2; PD-L1, programmed death-ligand 1; PLC-γ,
  phospholipase C-γ; PKC, protein kinase C; and TAM, tumor-associated macrophage.'
