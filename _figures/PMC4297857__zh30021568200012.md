caption: 'Model comparing the role of Klf4 in vitro (A) and in vivo (B and C) after
  γ-irradiation. A: in in vitro models, the expression of KLF4 is activated in a p53-dependent
  manner after γ-irradiation that then leads to increased p21 and decreased BAX expression.
  A net effect is to steer cells away from apoptosis and toward cell-cycle arrest.
  B: in vivo the interaction between p53, Klf4, and p21 might still hold in the intestinal
  epithelium following radiation injury; however, Klf4 might be required but not necessary
  for regulating the expression of p21. Klf4 is proposed to have short-term and a
  long-term roles in the intestinal epithelium following radiation injury. During
  the short term (gray boxes), Klf4 suppresses apoptosis and proliferation and is
  involved in DNA-repair response. During the long term (black boxes), Klf4 plays
  a role in increased crypt survival and might have a novel role in proliferation
  during the regenerative phase of the intestinal epithelium. C: in vivo deletion
  of Klf4 leads in the short term (gray boxes) to elevated p53, increased apoptosis,
  impaired DNA-damage repair, and unchecked proliferation. The expression of p21 shifts
  to a Klf4-independent pathway. In the long term (black boxes), p21 might divert
  crypt-cell fate toward senescence, and there is overall reduced crypt survival.'
