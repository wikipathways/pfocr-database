caption: Schematic of HAase- and α-PDL1-engineered CAR-T cells (H-P@CAR-T) for enhanced
  solid tumor immunotherapy. (a) Tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) degrading enzyme
  HAase and checkpoint blocking antibody α-PDL1 were engineered on the CAR-T cell
  surface by metabolic glycan biosynthesis and click reaction. α-PDL1 was conjugated
  with tumor extracellular acidity-responsive maleic acid amide bonds and could be
  released in a low pH tumor microenvironment. (b) H-P@CAR-T cells destroy tumor ECM
  by degrading hyaluronic acid and show enhanced tumor infiltration capability. Furthermore,
  the checkpoint blocking antibody α-PDL1 releases from H-P@CAR-T cells under the
  acidic condition of the tumor microenvironment which reverses the immunosuppression
  of PD1–PDL1 pathway and in turn improves the antitumor activity.
