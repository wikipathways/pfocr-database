caption: The SACK method for the expansion of tissue stem cells. (a) In vivo, tissue
  stem cells divide with asymmetric cell kinetics to produce progeny that eventually
  undergo a terminal cell cycle arrest and differentiate. Asymmetric cell kinetics
  maintains an equilibrium between renewal of differentiated tissue cells and preservation
  of constant tissue stem cell number. When tissue stem cells are cultured ex vivo,
  asymmetric cell kinetics results in their dilution and loss as a consequence of
  the accumulation of their differentiating progeny cells. The SACK method shifts
  tissue stem cells to symmetric cell kinetics that reversibly promotes their exponential
  expansion. Green circles, tissue stem cells; yellow circles, transient-amplifying
  lineage-committed cells; red circles, terminally arrested differentiated cells.
  (b) The guanine ribonucleotide biosynthesis pathway that controls tissue stem cells'
  self-renewal pattern. The rate-limiting step for cellular guanine ribonucleotide
  biosynthesis is the formation of xanthosine-5′-monophosphate (XMP) from inosine-5′-monophosphate
  (IMP), the reaction catalyzed by inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase II (IMPDH
  II). The asymmetric cell kinetics of tissue stem cells requires downregulation of
  IMPDH II expression by the tumor suppressor protein p53. Supplementation with exogenous
  guanine ribonucleotide precursors, like xanthosine, which expands guanine ribonucleotide
  pools, converts tissue stem cells to symmetric cell kinetics despite normal p53
  expression. Cells expressing a xanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (XPRT) transgene
  can use the highly membrane-permeable precursor xanthine to achieve symmetric cell
  kinetics. GMP, guanosine monophosphate; NsK, nucleoside kinase; PNP, purine nucleoside
  phosphorylase; XO, xanthine oxidase.
