caption: 'Schematic illustration of the mechanism by which lncRNA-CR11538 facilitates
  immune homeostasis recovery. Left diagram: In the early stage of immune response,
  Gram-positive bacteria activate Toll signaling pathway and promote Dif/Dorsal entering
  the nucleus to enhance AMP transcriptions, thereby eliminating pathogens. Right
  diagram: In the late stage of immune response, redundant AMPs increase the expression
  of lncRNA-CR11538, which acts as a Dif/Dorsal decoy to sequester them away from
  AMP promoters and inhibits the transcriptions of AMPs to restore immune homeostasis.'
