caption: 'Optogenetic regulation of cell-cell communications. A: self-assembly of
  MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells can be achieved by using a CRY2-CIBN photodimerization
  pair separately expressed on the cell membrane. Blue light stimulation induces MDA-MB-231
  cell cluster formation. B: optogenetic regulation of integrin interaction with the
  extracellular matrix (ECM). Under 660-nm light, OptoIntegrin (PIF6-fused to the
  extracellular domain of the β-subunit of integrin αVβ3) interacts with glass-coated
  OptoMatrix (glass surface-bound PhyB) to trigger integrin-ECM engagement-induced
  RAS-ERK activation and mechanosensory YAP1 activation. C: OptoBax-induced cell apoptosis
  upon exposure to blue light by translocating CRY2-BAX to interact with mitochondrion-anchored
  CIB to trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and cell death.
  The resulting active matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) cleave pro-EGF ligands on
  the apoptotic cells, which then triggers an ERK/Akt wave to support cell survival
  over hours through EGFR signaling in the healthy neighbors that could last for 5–15
  min. D: activation of Ras-ERK signaling in Opto-SOS (PIF-SOScat binds to membrane-targeted
  PhyB upon 660-nm illumination)-expressing sender cells triggers a paracrine pathway
  by secreting STAT3-activating factors, such as IL-6, while simultaneously inhibiting
  autocrine pathways to prevent self-activation of STAT3. See glossary for abbreviations.
