caption: Signaling pathway underlying the regulation of vacuolar protein sorting 34
  (Vps34) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invasion. A schematic drawing of the two
  mechanisms of Vps34 in inhibiting the HCC invasion by regulating the endosome-lysosome
  system. (A) When Vps34 is sufficient. Vps34 could promote lysosomal juxtanuclear
  accumulation through Rab7–Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) pathway (red
  arrow), thus less lysosomal peripheral transportation reduced the secretion of exosomes,
  degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and invasion (red cross). (B) When Vps34
  is deficient. Vps34 deficiency reduced endocytic degradation (red cross) and promoted
  the Rab11 mediated endocytic recycling of cell surface receptors, such as epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) (red arrow), inducing the activation of downstream
  signaling and invasion. RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.
