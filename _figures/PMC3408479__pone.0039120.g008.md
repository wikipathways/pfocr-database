caption: Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum
  induces activation of multiple signaling pathways. Many studies have indicated that
  activation of IRE1, ATF6, and PERK represents the standard UPR pathways and turns
  on the expression of many downstream genes such as GRP78. ER stress induced caspase-12/caspase-9/caspase-3,
  PERK/ATF-4/CHOP, IRE1/Ask1/JNK, and PERK/eIF2α/NF-κB signaling pathways and then
  those pathways may alter cellular homeostasis by regulating multiple genes, resulting
  in regulation of cell death or survival. This pathway (indicated by heavy arrows)
  is demonstrated in this report. We demonstrated that induction of p53 expression
  is mediated by NF-κB during ER stress.
