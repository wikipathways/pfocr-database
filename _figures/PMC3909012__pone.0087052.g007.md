caption: The cell lines are arranged in ascending order according to the degree of
  membrane folding, probed by the area-specific membrane capacitance C m. Resulting
  from the deficiency of either PTEN (U87-MG), p53 (GaMG), or both proteins (U373-MG
  and SNB19), the overexpression of mTOR () promotes synthesis of proteins and lipids
  which can be used for the plasma membrane production. The amplified membrane synthesis
  may lead to the excessive membrane area and folding as reflected, respectively,
  by a very large C C value of GaMG cells and increased C m data of U373-MG and SNB19
  cells. In addition to deregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and p53 pathways, the large
  surface areas of GaMG and U373-MG cells (C C = 28.8 and 25.3 pF) may be associated
  with the increased levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS, 0.56–0.57 a.u.), a key enzyme
  of the lipogenic pathway.
