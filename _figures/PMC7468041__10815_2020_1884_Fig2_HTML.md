caption: '1. Methionine (Met) is essential for the synthesis of SAM (S-adenosyl methionine)
  and downstream methylation reactions involved with epigenetic chromatin modifications.
  A fraction of Met is derived from the maternal oocyte pool, and its depletion following
  fertilization must be compensated in the culture medium for maintenance methylation
  to be sustained. Although Met is sensitive to spontaneous oxidation forming Met
  sulfone, oocyte-derived glutaredoxins (GRX) can restore Met to its non-oxidized
  state in the embryo during the first cleavage divisions. 2. Homocysteine cannot
  be recycled to cysteine: the two main sulfur amino acids cannot be linked. The CBS
  pathway is not expressed, and cysteine must be supplied externally to generate glutathione.
  Although the early embryo is able to synthesize glutathione, this is not the case
  for hypotaurine, as the CSD (cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase) enzyme is not expressed.
  Basically, protection against ROS depends on glutathione via or not the glutaredoxins
  (strongly expressed). 3. The BHMT pathway, betaine homocysteine methyltransferase
  is very marginally expressed. 4. Homocysteine recycling relies completely on the
  methionine synthase pathway, backed up by the folate cycle. The MTFR SNPs (methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase single-nucleotide polymorphism) can be a burden. Carriers of this SNP
  have a reduced ability to deliver 5MTHF (5 methylenetetrahhydrofolate), necessary
  as the fuel for MS to regenerate homocysteine [, ]'
