caption: IGF-IR signaling in CSCs-like cells biology. Schematic summary of the IGF-IR
  signaling in the regulation of CSCs-like cells biology. After long term of EMT-associated
  factors effects, some of the EMT cells acquire CSCs-like properties with over-activation
  of IGF-IR signaling. IGF-IR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway activation increases
  the CSCs population, which promotes EMT process. The activation of IGF/STAT3/Nanog/Slug
  axis induces the progression of EMT and self-renewal of CSCs. CSCs, cancer stem
  cells; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin
