caption: ENOs and 14-3-3 in neurodegeneration. Glycolytic ENOs also have a role in
  degradation of Aβ, mediated by plasmin. 14-3-3 proteins can regulate aggregation
  of SNCA [,], as well as influence hyperphosphorylation of tau []. ROS, generated
  for instance by Aβ and NFT, can deteriorate mitochondria leading to release of cytochrome
  C and initiation of pro-apoptotic pathway. As the 14-3-3 proteins, SNCA can interact
  with PKC, ERK and P-Bad []. Free Bad can interact with Bcl-xL, which leads to the
  release of cytochrome C from mitochondria and the initiation of the pro-apoptotic
  pathway []. Red arrow, influenced by IL-18 [,].
