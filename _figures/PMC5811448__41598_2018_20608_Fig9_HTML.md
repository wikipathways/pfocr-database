caption: Model linking the adaptive and innate immune responses during tumour development
  via IL-33-ILC2 axis. IL-33-expressing tumour environment stimulates the development
  of ILC2 cells and functionally activates them through the ST2 receptor pathway.
  Functionally active ILC2s alter the tumour microenvironment triggering both innate
  and adaptive immune responses. ILC2s recruit DCs through IL-13 production, stimulate
  Th2 cells and possibly Th1 cells through direct ILC2 antigen presentation via MHC-II
  molecules, and indirectly stimulate CTL precursor cells through DC endogenous antigen
  presentation or cross-presentation via MHC-I molecules. Th1 and Th2 cells may also
  be activated by DCs through exogenous antigen presentation via MHC-II molecules.
  Through the release of IL-5 by ILC2s and subsequent recruitment of eosinophils,
  the chemokine profiles of tumour microenvironment is changed to attract Th1 and
  CD8+ T cells and to direct the activation of CTL-mediated killing and cancer rejection.
  This mechanism acts to suppress the frequency of circulating tumours cell and subsequent
  metastasis. In metastatic tumours with low IL-33 content, the IL-33/ILC2 pathway
  is not initiated and immune escape is facilitated.
