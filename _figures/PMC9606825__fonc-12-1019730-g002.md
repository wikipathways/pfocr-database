caption: Intracellular signalling changes with a potential relevance for NOTCH1 activation
  as observed in SU-DHL4 cells after rituximab and obinutuzumab in-vitro treatment.
  Antigen binding to the B-cell receptor induces Ca2+-flux and activates the MAPK
  and Pi3K/AKT signalling pathways. All three signalling events have been linked to
  modulation of ADAM10/ADAM17 activity. Both metalloproteases were shown to promote
  the first cleavage step to release the NICD1 transcription factor. Likewise, an
  increase in NOTCH1 signalling could be associated with an activation of the B-cell
  receptor signalling cascade. As well as B-cell receptor activation, rituximab binding
  to CD20 can induce Ca2+-flux, MAKP signalling and AKT activation. In keeping with
  this notion, NOTCH1 signalling was shown to be inducible by rituximab treatment
  in SU-DHL4 cells. Phosphoproteomic studies in SU-DHL4 cells revealed a significant
  decrease in ADAM17 Ser791 phosphorylation at one hour after start of rituximab treatment.
  ADAM17 Ser791 de-phosphorylation has been associated with an increase in ADAM17
  activity. Obinutuzumab binding to CD20 induces MAPK signalling, but only weak AKT
  activation and no measurable Ca2+-flux in SU-DHL4 cells. NOTCH1 signalling was induced
  to a much lower degree by obinutuzumab than by rituximab treatment and ADAM17 Ser791
  phosphorylation was not significantly altered.
