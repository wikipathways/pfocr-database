caption: Autophagy is involved in the initiation of hepatocarcinoma (HCC). (A) Autophagy
  involvement in etiological factors of HCC. (a) Autophagy is induced by hepatitis
  B virus (HBV). Activating PI3K signal is one of the mechanisms in autophagy induced
  by HBV (,). (b) Autophagy is activated in hepatocytes infected with hepatitis C
  virus (HCV) through the activation of unfolded protein response signaling (). (c)
  Autophagy is suppressed in obesity in hepatocytes possibly because the mTOR signaling
  pathway is overactivated by the metabolism of overnutrition (). (d) Autophagy is
  inhibited by ethanol, which may be caused through the downregulation of AMPK activity
  (). (B) A multi-stage process in the formation of HCC.
