caption: An abbreviated summary of phenotypes resulting from HIPPO inactivation and/or
  YAP/TAZ activation in cell types relevant to the adult heart. Generally, YAP/TAZ
  are restrained by basal HIPPO activity under physiological conditions. Further HIPPO
  activation can elicit opposite phenotypes of those noted, although this has not
  been validated in all cell types. To date, the majority of studies that focused
  on non-myocyte HIPPO-YAP signaling were carried out in non-cardiac systems.
