caption: 'The change in the metabolism of adenosine signaling between the states of
  healthy and infected. Adenosine signaling is a crucial contributor to the innate
  host defense mechanism. Extracellular ATP (eATP) is released to the extracellular
  space through Pannexin-1 channels (Panx-1). Once in the extracellular space, eATP
  may activate the P2X7 purinergic receptor or may be converted to adenosine by the
  CD39/CD73-mediated adenosine pathway. Extracellular adenosine can be metabolized
  into three separate ways: (1) be transported back into the cell via bi-directional
  equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT) in the direction of concentration gradient;
  (2) activate adenosine receptors (ARs) on the plasma membrane with the stimulation
  of P2X7; or (3) be degraded into inosine via adenosine deaminase (ADA). During infection,
  a substantial increase in the amount of extracellular ATP released by host cells
  is observed across many species of microbes [,,]. Subsequently, the level of extracellular
  adenosine and activation of ARs may be altered, potentially changing the outcome
  of their intracellular signaling cascades. Mucosal pathogens such as P. gingivalis
  can promote activation of anti-inflammatory ARs. This will further result in elevated
  cAMP formation via adenylate cyclase activity and subsequent activation of protein
  kinase A (PKA) and cAMP response element (CRE)-mediated gene expression that are
  shown to non-redundantly down-regulate inflammation []. P. gingivalis has also been
  shown to attenuate host oxygen-reactive-species (ROS) production and IL-1β release,
  while increasing bacterial effector secretion [,,,]. These specific molecular events
  described above culminate in the modulation of inflammation, which may lead to change
  the course and severity of infection.'
