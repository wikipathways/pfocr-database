caption: 'The plant terpenoid metabolic network and potential metabolons involved
  in the biosynthesis of specific compounds. The plastid and endoplasmic reticulum
  are highlighted in green and purple, respectively. The MVA pathway enzymes localized
  in peroxisomes and the cytosol are labeled in blue and orange, respectively. Individual
  enzymes are depicted as boxes and black arrows indicate metabolic fluxes. Confirmed
  and putative (with question mark) interactions of prenyltransferases with downstream
  enzymes forming metabolons are indicated by red arrows. The unknown transporter
