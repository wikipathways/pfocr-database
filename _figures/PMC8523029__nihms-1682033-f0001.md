caption: The 12(S)-HETE receptor (GPR31) is Gαi/o coupled and inhibits adenylate cyclase
  from converting ATP to cAMP. This action causes the reassociation of the regulatory
  subunits of PKA to its catalytic subunits, inhibiting the kinase activity of PKA.
  RAF, a member of the MAPK pathway, is capable of being inhibited through phosphorylation
  by PKA. RAF has been shown to phosphorylate MEK which subsequently activates ERK1/2
  which can translocate to the nucleus and promotes gene expression through the activation
  of nuclear transcription factors. Additionally, RAF has also been shown to induce
  NF-кB through MEKK1 which also promotes gene expression. Additionally, through alterations
  of RAF activity, 12(S)-HETE acting on GPR31 may also exert an inhibitory effect
  on ROCK and MYPT1 related signaling. Lastly, the Gβγ effects of GPCRs like GPR31
  have been demonstrated to influence intracellular calcium levels as well as drive
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathways with downstream consequences to alter gene expression.
  It is still unknown how the pairing of 12(S)-HETE and GPR31 alters the activation
  of the large conductance K channels (BKCa).
