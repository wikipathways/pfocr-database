caption: 'Different signaling pathways leading to the induction of virus stress-inducible
  genes (VSIGs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Left: virus binding to TLR,
  stimulating the TLR/MyD88 pathway and leading to the activation and release of NF-κB
  into nucleus. Center: the dsRNA signaling pathway requires TLR3; there are at least
  3 different mechanisms of inducing VSIGs. Right: the JAK/STAT pathway is activated
  by IFNα, -υ, -β, or -λ; the ISGF3 complex, consisting of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9,
  is formed and translocates into nucleus, binding to the ISRE promoter sequence of
  different ISGs and components of the IFNγ pathway for the activation of GAS promoter
  sequences. IFNλ mediates the transcription of VSIGs and ISGs through initiation
  of ISREs or GASs. Abbreviations: TLR, Toll-like receptor; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; IFN, interferon; ISGF, interferon stimulated gamma factor; IRF, interferon
  regulatory factor; ISRE, interferon stimulated response element; STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; GAS, interferon-activated site.'
