caption: Model for PTGS pathway deregulation during colorectal tumorigenesis. Inflammatory
  processes, including overactivation of PTGS signaling, are present in the colonic
  mucosae during, and possibly before, tumor development. In the tumor, promoter hypermethylation
  and other mechanisms contribute to the repression of several prostanoid-specific
  synthases and membrane receptors. This leads to the prevalence of PGE2 as the major
  prostanoid in tumor cells, whose downstream actions may include evasion of apoptosis,
  tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis
