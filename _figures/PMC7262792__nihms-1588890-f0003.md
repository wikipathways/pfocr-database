caption: 1) Hypopituitarism associated with other central nervous system abnormalities
  (classic GH deficiency); 2) negative inhibition of GHRH from the IGF-1R signaling
  pathway being constitutively activated at the level of the hypothalamus; 3) negative
  feedback from cell growth signaling products of the constituently active PI3K pathway
  in target cells; and 4) increased clearance of growth factors. GHRH = growth hormone
  releasing hormone; GH = growth hormone; IGF-1 = insulin-like growth factor 1; R=receptor;
  IGFBP-3 = insulin-like binding protein 3
