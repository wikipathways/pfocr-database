caption: Retinal gene expression cluster analysis of hypertensive eyes using GO and
  KEGG pathway analysis. (A) Increased gene expression in glaucomatous retina early
  after induced pressure elevation is related to immune response, activation of the
  complement system, and increased expression of ribosomal genes related to the ubiquitin–proteasome
  system. (B) Decreased expression is found for genes encoding GABAA receptor subunits
  involving ligand–receptor interaction. Two additional clusters are found for the
  decreased expression of genes associated with axonal guidance and neuron projection.
