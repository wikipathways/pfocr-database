caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software indicated that the upregulation
  of IL-1β following BCG stimulation are primarily implicated in pathways which facilitate
  cellular communication between immune cells, with a p-value of 5,83E−11. The second
  top pathway it’s implicated in is T-helper cell differentiation with a p-value of
  1,65E−10, and is also implicated in the communication between innate and adaptive
  immune cells with a p-value of 3,77E−10. Purple boxes represent markers that are
  from the dataset and participate in the pathway. Red boxes indicate markers present
  in the dataset that are upregulated in the pathway. White boxes indicate markers
  present in the pathway, but not in the dataset.
