caption: Activated mTOR signaling induces the secretion of IL-4 in melanomas and YM1
  in macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Secreted YM-1enhances the EEA1-mediated
  xCT capture via the KEAP1/NRF2 signaling pathway to promote antioxidant mechanisms
  through GSH in radiotherapy. Therefore, the regulation of mTOR activity using rapamycin
  could increase tumor sensitivity to γ-radiation-induced ROS by inhibiting the interaction
  between melanoma and macrophages.
