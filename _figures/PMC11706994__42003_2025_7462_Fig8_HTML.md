caption: In macrophage cells, LCWE activates inflammatory signaling pathways through
  TLR2, unlike LPS through TLR4. MYD88 functions as the adaptor for the TLR receptors
  of both LCWE and LPS, activating the NF-κB signaling pathway and the expression
  of inflammatory cytokines including IL6, TNFα, pro-IL-1β, and NLRP3. These cytokines
  further increase inflammatory signaling, resulting in an inflammatory storm and
  ALI
