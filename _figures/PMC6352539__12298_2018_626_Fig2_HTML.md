  based on 1331 up-regulated probes over three fold-change between fertile monocyte
  anthers (Fer-anther) and F1 tetrad panicles (F1-rachis), which showed the complex
  metabolic network. b Network diagram based on 875 up-regulated probes over three fold-change
  between anthers at tetrad stage of sterile plant (Ste-anther) and anthers at F1
  tetrad stage (Ste-rachis), which showed inddoxal compound was the connection node
  from the sub-network to the amino acid metabolism main network. c The main network
