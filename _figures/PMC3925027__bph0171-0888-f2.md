caption: Schematic representation of cytokines and their receptors regulating peripheral
  B-cell survival. B-cell homeostasis relies on three cascades, BCR, TNFSF13B (BAFF)/TNFRSF13C
  (BAFFR) and MIF/CD74. The crosstalk between these cascades is shown. CD74 activation
  by MIF leads to the elevation of HGF and its receptor, HGFR (c-Met). HGFR engages
  with CD74 and CD44 on the cell membrane and, together with HGF, initiates an additional
  signalling pathway, leading to the up-regulation of MK. MK binding to its receptor,
  PTPRZ1 (RPTPζ), results in a survival pathway that involves the phosphorylation
  of Akt and Syk and elevation of Bcl2 levels.
