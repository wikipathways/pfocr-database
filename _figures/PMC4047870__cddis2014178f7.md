caption: The insulin/mTOR pathway in RPE cells. (a) Insulin activates IRS and causes
  Akt phosphorylation, resulting in mTOR activation. As a negative feedback loop,
  mTOR and S6K both block insulin signaling. In high-glucose conditions, S6K is chronically
  active, causing insulin resistance. This resistance is characterized (in RPE cells)
  by phospho-S636/639 IRS1, p-S6 and impaired insulin-induced activation of Akt. (b)
  In the presence of rapamycin, the events downstream of mTORC1 are blocked and therefore
  there is no feedback inhibition of insulin signaling
