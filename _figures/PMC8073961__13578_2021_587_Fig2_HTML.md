caption: Role of adiponectin in VSMC. Adiponectin enhances apoptosis and inhibits
  the proliferation of VSMCs through AdipoR1/dipoR2-mediated activation of MFN2-Ras-Raf-Erk1/2
  signaling pathway in pathological condition. Adiponectin-induced activation of AMPK
  attenuates mTORC1-S6K1-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling and subsequently
  increases protein synthesis and attenuates FoxO4-mediated inhibition of VSMC proliferation
  in atherosclerosis. Adiponectin-induced production of endothelial NO also diffuses
  into the VSMCs and subsequently inhibits the activation of RhoA protein, an upstream
  factor that induces VSMC hypertrophy through ROCK-Cofilin-mediated increase in F-actin/G-actin
  ratios following the formation of ROS
