caption: S-Nitrosylated proteins involved in photosynthesis. Top and middle, Diagrams
  of the light reactions and the Calvin cycle (the dark reaction) of photosynthesis,
  respectively. S-Nitrosylated enzymes or proteins are highlighted in red with accession
  numbers (for detailed annotation of these proteins, see Supplemental Tables S1 and
  S5). Other enzymes or proteins in the pathway are not shown. Bottom, Other S-nitrosylated
  proteins annotated as related to photosynthesis. S-Nitrosylated proteins identified
  by site-specific proteomics are marked by red asterisks.
