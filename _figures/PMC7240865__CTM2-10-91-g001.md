caption: 'An overview of mechanisms underlying NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3
  inflammasome activation occurs via two steps: priming and activating. PAMPs and
  DAMPs, detected by PRRs, trigger the downstream NF‐κB signaling pathway, promoting
  the transcription of NLRP3 and pro‐IL‐1β. However, several noncoding RNAs such as
  miR‐223, inhibit the transcription of NLRP3 and pro‐IL‐1β. NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  has lots of triggers including K+ efflux, Ca2+ mobilization, ER stress, lysosomal
  leakage and mitochondrial dysfunction. NLRP3 activation is also triggered via several
  mechanisms involving the Golgi apparatus and ER‐Golgi vesicle trafficking. Dispersed
  TGN provides a scaffold for NLRP3 puncta formation, promoting the assembly and activation
  of NLRP3 inflammasome; PtdIns4P serves as the binding site. NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  induces the cleavage of GSDMD, pro‐IL‐1β, and pro‐IL‐18. NT‐GSDMD forms a pore in
  the cell membrane, thereby inducing pyroptosis and release of intracellular factors.
