caption: Schematic representation of the cascade of inflammatory events induced by
  psychosocial stress and involved in the development of depression. The most relevant
  markers of inflammation and neurogenesis used in the reviewed studies are indicated.
  In addition, neurogenic processes and the inflammatory response pathway are specified.
  Additionally, we also include SIRT1, an important member of the sirtuin family,
  induces deacetylation of the NF-kB subunit p65, thereby inhibiting its activity.
  Continuous arrows represent a direct relation, and discontinuous arrows and indirect
  relation.
