caption: Microglial metabolism shifts from OXPHOX to glycolysis in the inflammatory
  state. Microglia can recognize PAMPs (e.g., LPS) and DAMPs (e.g., ATP) as well as
  various cellular inflammatory factors. Some inflammatory stimuli, including LPS,
  ATP, INF-γ, and BAFF, can cause enhanced glycolysis in microglia, promoting the
  transcription of inflammatory genes, which are mainly dependent on the activation
  of mTOR. Additionally, HIF-1α can promote glycolysis by upregulating the expression
  of key enzymes of glycolysis. LPS can upregulate the level of mitochondrial itaconate
  and inhibit SDH/complex II, leading to disruption of the TCA cycle and electron
  transport chain, which together inhibit mitochondrial OXPHOX. LPS can also upregulate
  COX-2 and promote the production of PGE2, which can act on EP2 to promote G6PD expression,
  enhance PPP, and increase NADPH production. EP2 can promote iNOS to produce NO and
  NOX2, which further generate free radicals. NO can inhibit complex IV of the mitochondrial
  electron transport chain, and free radicals can act on neighboring neurons and cause
  neuronal damage. When 2-DG, 3-BPA is used to inhibit HK2 or GLUT1 is silenced to
  inhibit glycolysis in microglia, the level of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate decreases,
  the AMP/ATP ratio increases, and the inhibition of AMPK is diminished, leading to
  AMPK inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway and suppression of inflammatory gene
  transcription
