caption: The signature model of immunity signalling. Details are explained in the
  discussion.  Binding of flg22 to the receptor will therefore result in a substantial
  increase of cytosolic calcium within a few minutes.  The stimulation of the membrane-bound
  NADPH oxidase RboH through specific calcium-dependent protein kinases, leading to
  an apoplastic oxidative burst generating superoxide anions.  Hydrogen peroxide is
  generated in the peroxisomes from superoxide.  Calcium reaching the plastid will
  activate specific lipoxygenases there as the first committed step of the oxylipin
  pathway generating jasmonates. MYB14 transcription factor.  Stilbenes.
