caption: 'Relevant signaling cascades for bone-related cells when stimulated by SMFs.
  (a) The differentiation promoting effect of osteoblast-like MG-63 cell by 0.4 T
  SMF is correlated to a calcium-activated calmodulin signaling pathway []. Increasing
  of the intracellular calcium ions concentration activates CaM and PDE1C, which further
  suppresses cAMP activity and decreases cell growth. Calcium ions act as a second
  messenger that induces subsequent signaling cascades and finally oseoblastogenesis;
  (b) The Wnt/β-catenin-p38 and JNK MAPKs-NF-κB signaling pathways were activated
  under SMF to stimulate osteoblastic differentiation []; (c) Direct effects of SMF
  on osteoclastogenic inhibition in macrophages []. SMF and the condition medium from
  SMF-treated osteoblasts suppressed RANK/RANKL and c-Fms/M-CSF signaling transduction,
  thus reducing TRAP activity and osteoclastogenesis. Abbreviations: GPCR = G-protein-coupled
