caption: Schematic showing the main metabolic pathways in which MAPK/ERK signaling
  is involved. The ERK pathway can be activated by two main receptors, i.e., receptor
  tyrosine kinase (RTK) (i) and G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) (ii). In addition,
  cytosolic mechanisms can also activate the pathway through protein kinase C (PKC)
  (iii) or calcium-calmodulin (CaM) (iv). The activation of the pathway can be directed
  by scaffolding proteins that hold together the components of the pathway. Once ERK
  is phosphorylated, cytoplasmic or nuclear changes may be induced, activating sets
  of genes responsible for neural differentiation, migration, the final fate, and
  plastic changes. Cytoplasmic p-ERK can promote processes such as apoptosis and neurogenesis.
