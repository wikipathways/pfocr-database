caption: Stimulators (red) and inhibitors (blue) of the tryptophan-kynurenine metabolic
  pathway. The tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) is stimulated by cortisol and 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid (3-HA) but inhibited by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) forming a
  negative feedback loop. The indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDOs) are stimulated by
  interferon (IFN)-β, IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) but inhibited by IL-4, IL-10 and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase
  (KMO) is stimulated by IFN-1 β, IFN-6, TNF-α, oxygen molecule (O2) but inhibited
  by IL-4, IL-10 and SOD. KMO is also inhibited by NADH forming another negative feedback
  loop.
