caption: 'Pictorial representation of a Notch protein and its signalling pathways.
  (a) The extracellular domain of Notch contains between 29 and 36 tandemly repeated
  epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, some of which are required for the interaction
  of Notch with its ligands, along with three Lin-12/Notch repeats. The most prominent
  motifs in the intracellular domain are six cdc10/ankyrin repeats and a PEST domain
  close to the C-terminus of the protein. The intracellular domain also contains two
  functionally defined domains: the juxtamembrane RAM23 domain that mediates the interaction
  of the intracellular domain of Notch with CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, Lag-1 (CSL)
  proteins; and a transcriptional activation domain that is C-terminal to the cdc10/ankyrin
  repeats. (b) The interaction of Delta, Serrate, Lag-2 (DSL) ligands (black) with
  EGF-like repeats 11 and 12 of Notch (dark blue and yellow) leads to two proteolytic
  cleavages, one extracellularly and one within the membrane, which release the intracellular
  domain of Notch (NICD). This fragment of Notch then migrates to the nucleus (dotted
  line) where it interacts with CSL proteins (orange) via its RAM23 domain to form
  a transcriptional activator. (c) Recent experiments have suggested that Notch can
  signal through a second distinct signalling pathway that requires the cytoplasmic
  protein Deltex (light blue). Deltex has been shown to interact directly with the
  cdc10/ankyrin repeats of Notch, and signalling through this pathway has been proposed
  to both inhibit Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling and to sequester the transcriptional
  coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300. It is not currently known whether signalling
  through this pathway is an intrinsic property of Notch proteins or whether it is
  activated by a ligand (green). It has been shown, however, that Wnt signalling can
  regulate this pathway and that this regulation requires both EGF-like repeats 17–19
  and 24–26, and the region C-terminal to the cdc10/ankyrin repeats.'
