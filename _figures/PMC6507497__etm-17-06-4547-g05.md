caption: GSK-3β/Snail pathway is involved in the synergistic effect of BAY 87-2243
  plus HDAC inhibitors. HDAC inhibitors can activate Snail and induce metastasis of
  HCC cells. BAY 87-2243, as a HIF-1α inhibitor, may reverse HDAC inhibitors-initiated
  metastasis in HCC cells via AKT/GSK-3β/Snail signaling pathway.
