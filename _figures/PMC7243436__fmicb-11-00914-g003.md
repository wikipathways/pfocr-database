caption: FA synthesis pathway of B. subtilis illustrating the observed changes in
  protein expression in response to both cerulenin addition and rescue of cellular
  growth with exogenous FA supplementation using n16:0 and a15:0 FAs. Cerulenin irreversibly
  binds to FabF, blocking FA synthesis. The observed 6.6-fold increase in FabF is
  consistent with previous reports (). These results also indicate that many other
  proteins in the pathway are overexpressed in response to these conditions, including
  the regulation protein, FapR. For locus tag, UniProt Description, log2 change in
  expression, and p-values for each differentially expressed protein (see ).
