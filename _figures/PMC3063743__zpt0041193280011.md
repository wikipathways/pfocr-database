caption: Regulatory pathways implicated in the stimulation of CYP4F2 gene expression
  by AICAR, A-769662, genistein, and resveratrol. AMPK plays an important role in
  regulating fatty acid oxidation, is activated when cellular AMP/ATP ratios are high,
  and subsequently modulates metabolic processes to increase ATP production (). AMPK
  is a heterotrimeric enzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit α and two regulatory
  subunits β and γ. Activation of AMPK requires phosphorylation of Thr-172 on the
  α-subunit by upstream kinases such as LKB1 or Ca2+/CaMKK. AMP binding to the γ-subunit
  allosterically increases Thr-172 phosphorylation, thereby significantly increasing
  kinase activity. Upon activation, AMPK phosphorylates key enzymes in fatty acid,
  sterol and glycogen synthesis such as ACC to decrease ATP utilization. The expression
  of CYP4F2 is increased at 24 h after treatment with three distinct AMPK activators,
  namely genistein, resveratrol, and AICAR. These effects are inhibited by compound
  C, an AMPK inhibitor, and by siRNAs targeting the mRNAs encoding the alternative
  α-subunits 1 and 2. A-769662 is a direct activator of AMPK that binds to the β-subunit.
  In contrast, AICAR acts indirectly after its conversion by adenosine kinase to ZMP,
  an AMP analog. 5-Iodotubercidin, an adenosine kinase inhibitor, blocks the increased
  CYP4F2 expression by AICAR (). Reservatrol has been demonstrated to activate AMPK
  indirectly by stimulation of the NAD+-activated deacetylase SIRT1, which in turn
  activates the AMPK upstream kinase LKB1. Splitomicin, a SIRT1 inhibitor, only partially
  blocked activation of CYP4F2 expression by resveratrol. CaMKK is also an AMPK upstream
  kinase. STO-609, a CaMKK inhibitor, reduced the level of expression of CYP4F2 elicited
  by genistein.
