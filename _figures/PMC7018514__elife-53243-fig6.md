caption: (A) Filament assemble when octamer interactions are stabilized by ATP binding
  to the regulatory domain (pink), and the N-terminal residues (blue) are released
  by flattening of the catalytic tetramer (green). Filament assembly interactions
  stabilize the flat conformation. (B) GTP binding stabilizes an inhibited, compressed
  conformation. Filament is less sensitive to GTP-induced compression, maintaining
  a population of octamers in mixed activity states. Filaments in the fully compressed
  GTP-bound state are strained, which promotes disassembly that is inhibited by substrate
  IMP binding. (C) The equilibrium in (B) explains the different cellular conditions
  in which IMPDH polymerization occurs. (i) Under homeostatic conditions IMPDH2 is
  dispersed and activity is regulated by GTP binding to octamers, which balances low
  levels of de novo synthesis between adenine and guanine pathways. ii) When guanine
  nucleotides are depleted the equilibrium shifts toward filaments. iii) Proliferative
  signaling can directly shift the equilibrium toward filaments, where higher flux
  is maintained through the guanine pathway under elevated GTP concentrations due
  to reduced sensitivity of the filaments to GTP inhibition (dashed line).
