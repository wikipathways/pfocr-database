caption: The network analysis of DEGs and DAMs in response to Cd stress and the addition
  of MT in cotton seedling leaves. (A) the correlation network of DEGs and DAMs involved
  in the pathway of valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation; (B) the correlation
  network of DEGs and DAMs involved in the pathway of ABC transporter; (C), the correlation
  network of DEGs and DAMs involved in the pathway of alpha-linolenic acid metabolism;
  ●The red circle represents DEGs; ♦the green square represents DAMs, the solid red
  line represents positive correlation, and the dashed black line represents negative
  correlation.
