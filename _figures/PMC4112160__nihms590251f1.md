caption: Metabolic drivers as determinants of HSC cell fate.The ‘ground state’ of
  adult HSCs is a ROS-low and ATP-low quiescent state, which is enforced by anaerobic
  glycolysis. Activation of energy generating metabolic pathways such as the TCA cycle
  and FAO pathway produce high ATP and ROS levels, which drive an ‘active state’ where
  HSCs are pushed towards commitment and differentiation through asymmetric cell divisions.
  Blockade of energy generating metabolic programs triggers symmetric cell divisions,
  which either expand HSCs or their progeny. A shifting balance between these different
  metabolic programs likely contributes to HSC function in normal, regenerative and
  disease conditions.
