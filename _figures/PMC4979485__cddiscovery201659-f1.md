caption: LINP1 regulation and role in the NHEJ DNA-repair pathway. LINP1 expression
  levels are positively and negatively regulated by the EGF and p53 signaling pathways,
  respectively. On recognition of DNA DSBs by the Ku70–Ku80 complex, LINP1 and DNA-PKcs
  are recruited to form a synaptic complex joining the broken DNA ends and initiating
  DNA repair. NHEJ inhibitors currently evaluated in anti-cancer clinical trials in
  combination with radiotherapy are indicated, with miR-29 mimetics potentially offering
  a novel therapeutic avenue.
