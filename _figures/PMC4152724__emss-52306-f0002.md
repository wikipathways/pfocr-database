caption: '(A) SOCS proteins interfere with Jak-STAT pathways induced by the interleukin
  receptors. SOCS-3 blocks STAT3 recruitment and reduces IL-6 and IL-17 expression.
  SOCS-1 is a negative regulator of Th1 response through the inhibition of STAT-1
  activation. Signalling pathway of p38 is involved in proinflammatory cytokines expression.
  Beside the classical pathway of p38 activation mediated by MAPK, T-cells show an
  alternative route that is specifically inhibited by Gadd45a. (B) IDO is expressed
  mainly on DCs and macrophages. Its expression is regulated by several signals, including
  the engagement of B7 molecules by CTLA-4. Tryptophan (TRP) catabolism by IDO activity
  counteracts T cell activation by two mechanisms: TRP-induced starvation and by the
  production of proapoptotic metabolites, named kynurenines. After binding to its
  ligands (i.e. kynurenines) AhR is translocated to the nucleus where forms a complex
  with ARNT which induces its binding to dioxin response elements (DRE) promoting
  the expression of IL-10 and IL-22. In addition, AhR activation blocks STAT-1 and
  STAT-5 and downregulates Th17 differentiation. AhR activation also induces IL-10
  expression on APC. Green plus symbols indicate tolerogenic signals.'
