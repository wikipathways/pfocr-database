caption: Hypothetical mechanism of glucose sensing in the heart in response to hemodynamic
  or metabolic stress. A loss of synchronization between glucose influx into the cardiomyocyte
  and pyruvate oxidation during pressure overload results in accumulation of glyoclytic
  intermediates. The latter can cause an increased flux through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (via G6PDH or TKL) and the hexosamine biosynthethic pathway (via GFAT),
  resulting in accumulation in xylulose 5-phosphate and UDP N-acetyl glucosamine,
  respectively. These metabolites affect the activity of various enzymes and transcription
  factors for phosphorylation and/or glycosylation events.
