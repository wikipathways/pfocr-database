caption: Schematic overview of pyrimidine salvage in Arabidopsis. Pyrimidine nucleotides
  are synthesized de novo in a pathway distributed between chloroplast and cytosol
  (dashed line). Nucleosides imported or derived from catabolic processes are salvaged
  by uridine/cytidine kinases (UCKs) in the cytosol. We postulate exchange of nucleotides
  (UTP, CTP) between cytosol and chloroplast. Uracil is imported into chloroplasts
  by PLUTO and subsequently channeled either into catabolism via PYD1 (dihydropyrimidine
  dehydrogenase1) or salvage via UPP. Resulting UMP can be further metabolized to
  UTP by PUMPKIN (plastidic UMP kinase) and NDPK2 (nucleoside diphosphate kinase2).
  Furthermore, UMP is a potent inhibitor of de novo synthesis at the transcriptional
  as well as enzymatic level (punctate line). Mutants directly involved in chloroplast
  uracil salvage (marked in red) show strong effects on chloroplast function (NDPK2)
  and early biogenesis (UPP, PUMPKIN). Other mutant enzymes and transporters around
  uracil metabolism (marked in blue) show little or no effect on growth and development.
  CDA1, Cytidine deaminase 1; CTPS, CTP synthase.
