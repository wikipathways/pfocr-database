caption: 'Autophagic Machinery. Box 1: Mechanism of autophagy. Autophagy initiates
  with the elongation of a precursor structure, called phagophore, surrounding cargo,
  to generate a double-membrane vesicle, called autophagosome [,]. Autophagosomes
  biogenesis is orchestrated by a subset of autophagy-related (ATG) proteins []. Upon
  autophagic stimuli, activation of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated
  protein kinase) and inhibition of mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex
  1) signaling pathway [,] leads to the activation of the ULK1/ULK2 (UNC51-like autophagy
  activating kinase 1/2) complex, which in turn activates the nucleation complex,
  including ATG13, RB1CC1 (RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1) and ATG101, which orchestrates
  the recruitment of further ATG proteins on the phagophore, promoting membrane elongation
  []. Nucleation complex phosphorylates AMBRA1 (autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1)
  and BECN1 (beclin1), disrupting the inhibitory association with BCL2 (BCL2 apoptosis
  regulator) and allowing PI3KC3 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit
  type 3) complex assembly []. The PI3KC3 complex, including the PI3KC3, PIK3R4 (PI3KC3
  regulatory subunit 4), UVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated), AMBRA1 and BECN1,
  controls the membrane nucleation stage and initial phagophore formation []. PI3P
  (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate) that is generated by PI3K activity in the newly
  formed membranes, serves as a landing pad, known as omegasomes, for effector proteins
  such as ZFYVE1 (zinc finger FYVE-type containing 1) and WIPI2 (WD repeat domain
  phosphoinositide-interacting 2), to promote the formation of isolation membrane
  []. Elongation of the isolation membrane requires the involvement on two ubiquitin-like
  conjugation systems. In the first system, the protease ATG4 cleaves the precursor
  form of MAP1LC3A (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha), allowing
  ATG7 (E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme) and ATG3 (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme)
  to catalyze the MAP1LC3A-I conjugation with phosphatidylethanolamine, to form MAP1LC3A-II
  [,]. At the same time, ATG12 is covalently conjugated to the ATG5 protein through
  the action of ATG7 and ATG10 (E2 ubiquitin-like enzyme) proteins [,]. Then, recruitment
  of the ATG16L1 protein (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase) stabilizes the ATG12-ATG5 complex.
  ATG12-5-16L1 oligomers facilitates MAP1LC3A-II localization to the phagophore membrane,
  where it drives autophagosomal maturation. Once autophagosome maturation is finished,
  ATG4 catalyzes the reverse modification reaction of MAP1LC3A-II to MAP1LC3A-I [].
  Following completion and closure, the autophagosome ultimately undergoes fusion
  with a lysosome (A). The fusion process is regulated by lysosomal membrane and cytoskeletal
  proteins. Finally, the fusion results in the exposure of autophagosomal cargo to
  the lysosomal acid hydrolases required for degradation and recycling []. Autophagy
  can be classified as non-selective or cargo-specific []. Selectivity of autophagy
  is ensured by two groups of autophagic cargo receptors, the ubiquitin-binding type,
  exemplified by SQSTM1 (sequestosome-1) [] and CALCOCO2 (calcium binding and coiled-coil
  domain 2) [], and the trans-membrane type, exemplified by BNIP3 (BCL2 interacting
  protein 3) and BNIP3L (BCL2 interacting protein 3 like) [,]. Although not essential
  for autophagosomal biogenesis itself, receptor proteins specifically bind the cargo
  material and the autophagosomal membrane, acting as a bridge that promotes cargo
  sequestration by the nascent autophagosome [] (B).'
