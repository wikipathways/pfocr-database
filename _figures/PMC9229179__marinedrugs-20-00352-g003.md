caption: Carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. Various kinds of carotenoid derivatives
  are synthesized based on the genes contained in the carotenoid gene cluster. MVA
  and MEP pathways are shown in green. Precursor, intermediates, and final product
  compounds are shown in yellow. Enzymes that play a role in the conversion of compounds
  are written next to the metabolic pathways.
