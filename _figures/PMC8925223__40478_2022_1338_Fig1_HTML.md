caption: The critical role of DHCR24 in cholesterol synthesis and homeostasis. In
  the post-lanosterol pathway of cholesterol synthesis, the final step in the Bloch
  pathway or the first step in the Kandutsch–Russell pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme
  DHCR24. Besides, as a link bridge between two pathways, DHCR24 can theoretically
  act on any intermediate from lanosterol through to desmosterol to transfer intermediates
  from the Bloch to the K–R pathway. Thus, DHCR24 play the critical role in maintaining
  cholesterol homeostasis via the control of cholesterol synthesis
