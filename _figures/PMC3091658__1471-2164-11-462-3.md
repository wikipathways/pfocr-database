caption: Fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Jatropha enzymes found in the fatty acid
  biosynthesis pathway. The icons beside each enzyme name show the total number of
  Jatropha ESTs corresponding to that enzyme in JD and JG, separately. KAS I participates
  from the 2nd to the 6th carbon-chain extension cycles. KAS II participates in the
  7th carbon-chain extension cycle. Both FatA and FatB can catalyse conversion of
  18:0-ACP into stearic acid. The fatty acids produced by this pathway are 16:0 (palmitic
  acid), 18:0 (stearic acid), 18:1 (oleic acid) and 18:2 (linoleic acid). See additional
  file  for the unisequences assigned to each enzyme.
