caption: The cGAS–STING pathway is linked to diabetes through Akt. A Insulin-mediated
  activation of Akt is essential for glucose handling and metabolism. Insulin activates
  PI3K/Akt. Akt is activated and phosphorylates many of its substrates, which regulate
  glycogen synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and glucose uptake. Akt can regulate cellular
  uptake of glucose by stimulating GLUT4 from cytoplasm to cell membrane. mTOR is
  a serine/threonine kinase that responds to a variety of environmental stimuli, including
  nutrient, oxygen, and energy levels, and forms two functionally distinct complexes,
  mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 can act as a nutrient/energy/redox sensor, controlling
  protein synthesis and growth factors. Prolonged activation of mTOR1 by glucose/fatty
  acids can further promote cellular damage, thereby exacerbating diabetes-associated
  cell and tissue damage while mTORC2 may also activate Akt function. B The link between
  the cGAS–STING pathway and Akt was shown earlier in rheumatoid arthritis, where
  Akt expression was significantly decreased when cGAS expression was suppressed [].
  However, in virus infection conditions, the relationship between the cGAS–STING
  pathway and Akt exhibits differently. Akt activation reported in the earlier experiments
  inhibited the cGAS–STING pathway [], but in later experiments, activated Akt positively
  regulated the cGAS–STING-mediated antiviral action [, ]. Reportedly TBK1 is able
  to inhibit mTORC1 activity in mice []. Given that the role of mTORC1 can be regulated
  by Akt and TBK1 (a downstream link of the cGAS–STING pathway), mTORC1 may be a key
  link connecting the cGAS–STING pathway to Akt. Limited information indicates that
  in HFD-treated Akt2-AMPKα2 double-knockout mouse hearts, Akt2-AMPKα2 double-knockout
  activated the cGAS–STING pathway, as the first evidence for the link between Akt
  and cGAS–STING pathway in metabolic disease. To date, there remains no study on
  whether knockdown of Akt alone activated the cGAS–STING pathway. Therefore, whether
  the cGAS–STING pathway functions in the pathogenesis of diabetes, whether the cGAS–STING
  pathway plays a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, and what function does Akt
  play in these diseases all need to be further investigated. AMPK AMP-activated protein
