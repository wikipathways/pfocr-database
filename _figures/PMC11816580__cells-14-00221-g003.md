caption: 'Downstream signaling in regard to the promotion of liver fibrosis by CS.
  The solid arrows represent ‘facilitation’, the dashed arrows in different colors
  represent ‘transport’, and the solid ‘T’ lines represent ‘inhibition’. (A) Nicotine
  promotes cholangiocyte proliferation. CS activates macrophages, generates ROS and
  inflammatory molecules to transform inactive HSCs into active MFBs. Additionally,
  the CS/MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathway in hepatic epithelial cells can promote EMT,
  which is a potential source of MFB. (B) CS-induced signaling pathway in HSCs. CS
  can trigger various downstream signaling pathways to activate collagen production,
  promote HSC proliferation and survival, and stimulate the recruitment of MDMs to
  continuously induce liver fibrosis. Abbreviations: CS: cigarette smoke; KC: Kupffer
  cell; MDM: monocyte-derived macrophages; MCP-1: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1;
  HSC: hepatic satellite cell; MFB: myofibroblasts, ROS: reactive oxygen species;

  IL-6: interleukin-6; EMT: epithelial–mesenchymal transition; AP-1: activator protein-1;
