caption: 'Representative metabolic pathway maps of differentially expressed proteins
  involved in pyruvate metabolic in KEGG. The enzyme codes were noted as follows:
  pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.1), dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase
  (EC 2.3.2.12), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4). Red for upregulated
  proteins'
