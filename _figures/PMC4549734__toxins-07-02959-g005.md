caption: Schema of GALR2 pathway and function in HNSCC cells. In GALR2-transduced
  HNSCC cells, galanin induced ERK1/2 activation and suppressed cell proliferation.
  Galanin stimulation reduced cyclin D1 expression and increased expression of the
  CKIs, p27 and p57. These signaling pathways were sensitive to PTX. Furthermore,
  a study using AAV vectors revealed that GALR2-mediated apoptosis may also occur
  in a caspase-independent manner; this involves the induction of the pro-apoptotic
  BCL2 family member, Bim after downregulation of ERK1/2.
