caption: VEGF protein family and receptor signaling pathway. A family of VEGF includes
  VEGF‐A, VEGF‐B, VEGF‐C, VEGF‐D, VEGF‐E, and PIGF. The high‐affinity receptors that
  specifically bind to VEGF are called VEGFR, which are mainly divided into VEGFR‐1,
  VEGFR‐2, and VEGFR‐3. VEGF signaling pathway can induce endothelial cell proliferation,
  migration, and increase vascular permeability, and then participate in the occurrence
  and progression of angiogenesis‐dependent diseases. PIGF, placental growth factor;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factors; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor
  receptors;
