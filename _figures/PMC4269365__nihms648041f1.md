caption: Potential pathways of androstenedione synthesis in the human adrenal gland.
  Cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone by CYP11A1. Conversion of pregnenolone
  to androstenedione might take place by either of two pathways. In the Δ5pathway,
  pregnenolone undergoes 17α-hydroxylation to 17α-hydroxypregnenolone and scission
  of the C17-C20 bond to yield DHEA, both catalyzed by CYP17. HSD3B2 can also convert
  each Δ5 steroid to its corresponding Δ4 steroid, including androstenedione. For
  progesterone to be converted to testosterone, it must follow a Δ4pathway through
  17α-hydroxyprogesterone and to androstenedione. However, CYP17 in human adrenal
  gland have high 17, 20-lyase activity only in the Δ5pathway ($). This figure was
  reproduced based on a previous study [].
