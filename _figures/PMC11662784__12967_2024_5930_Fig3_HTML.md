caption: 'The Role of DEAD-Box Helicases in Gastric Cancer: DDX5: DDX5 increases the
  expression of p-mTOR and p-S6K1, promoting the growth of gastric cancer. DDX6: DDX6
  binds to c-Myc mRNA, enhancing the expression of c-Myc protein, which promotes cell
  proliferation and the progression of gastric cancer. DDX18: DDX18 interacts with
  Drosha as a component of the protein complex, promoting the maturation of microRNA-21.
  MicroRNA-21 binds to the 3´-UTR of PTEN, leading to PTEN mRNA degradation and subsequent
  AKT phosphorylation, thereby promoting gastric cancer progression. DDX21: DDX21
  promotes gastric cancer progression by upregulating Cyclin D1 and CDK2 levels, increasing
  the G1/S phase transition in gastric cancer cells. Additionally, DDX21 upregulates
  the expression of Slug, further promoting gastric cancer progression. DDX24: DDX24
  positively regulates the level of HK1 by stabilizing HK1 mRNA at the transcriptional
  level, thereby enhancing glucose uptake and lactate production in gastric cancer
  cells, contributing to tumor progression. DDX27: DDX27 regulates LPP protein expression
  by reducing the SE event on the third exon of LPP transcripts, enhancing the translation
  of functional domain-containing LPP protein. This regulation via the DDX27/LPP/EMT
  axis promotes gastric cancer progression. DDX27 also reduces the proportion of cells
  in the G1 phase while increasing the proportion in the S and G2/M phases, thereby
  regulating the cell cycle and promoting cell proliferation and tumor progression
  in gastric cancer. DDX46: DDX46 promotes AKT phosphorylation and increases GSK-3β
  phosphorylation, leading to decreased GSK-3β-mediated β-catenin degradation and
  promoting gastric cancer progression through the Wnt signaling pathway. DDX56: DDX56
  inhibits the expression of FOXO1 and p21 Cip1, thereby activating the downstream
  cyclin E1/CDK2/c-Myc signaling pathway, which promotes gastric cancer progression'
