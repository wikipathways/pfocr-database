caption: A model of steps in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. Step 1, Hepatic
  and intestinal synthesis of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and its association with
  phospholipids and cholesterol by the ATP-bindind cassette A1 (ABCA1) transporter
  forming nascent pre-β high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Step 2, Efflux of cholesterol
  from peripheral tissues by ABCA1 and ABCG1 transporters. Step 3, Esterification
  of cholesterol in HDL by lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) and transformation
  of nascent HDL into spherical α-HDL. Step 4, Cholesteryl ester transfer protein
  (CETP)-mediated and phoshpholipid transfer protein (PLTP)-mediated exchange of cholesteryl
  ester and phospholipids between HDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Step 5, Hepatc
  uptake of cholesterol from HDL by scavenger receptor B type I (SR-BI) and from LDL
  by LDL receptor. LPL—lipoprotein lipase; VLDL—very low-density lipoprotein
