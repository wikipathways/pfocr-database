caption: 'Schematic diagram of the mating signal pathway of the yeast cell pheromone
  pathwayThe red horizontal line represents the inhibition of negative feedback; the
  green arrow represents the activation of positive feedback; the dashed arrow represents
  a shift in localization; I1 and I2 represent different negative feedback adjustment
  pathways; and P1 and P2 represent the two polar growth signaling pathways that are
  connected by light green arrows. The outline of the pathway is as follows: The binding
  of α-factor to its transmembrane receptor Ste2 leads to activation of the heterotrimeric
  G protein complex consisting of Gpa1 (Gα), Ste4 (Gβ), and Ste18 (Gγ). This causes
  dissociation of the Gβγ dimer (Ste4/Ste18) from Gα (Gpa1). The released Gβγ then
  recruits the PAK kinase Ste20 to the membrane and activates it. Ste20 initiates
  the MAPK cascade by phosphorylating the MAPKKK Ste11. Activated Ste11 phosphorylates
  the MAPKK Ste7, which then phosphorylates the MAPK Fus3. The activated Fus3 has
  two downstream effects: First, Fus3 directly phosphorylates and activates the formin
  Bni1, which nucleates actin cables for polarization. Second, Fus3 enters the nucleus
  and phosphorylates Ste12, a transcription factor that induces mating-specific genes.
  Fus3 also phosphorylates Far1, which inhibits the G1–S transition by binding to
  Cdc28-Cln2 complex. The Fus3-Far1 complex exits the nucleus and binds to Cdc24,
  promoting the activation of the Rho-GTPase Cdc42. Activated Cdc42 in turn stimulates
  Bni1.'
