caption: Proposed pathway. Innate immune stimulation by bacterial DNA (and possibly
  other TLRs) lead to activation of both NF-kB and MAP kinase pathways, especially
  p38 (1). Multiple cytokines are elaborated by DCs (2). In wild-type mice, there
  may be a yet-unknown putative regulatory ligand that is signals via G protein coupled
  receptor (3). In B6 mice, IL-10 is also produced following TLR stimulation which
  serves to decrease inflammatory signals (4). This pathway lacking in the Gαi1-deficient
  129 mouse. Putative regulatory signals go through G protein-coupled receptors which
  would normally serve to dampen the inflammatory signals (5). In the Gαi2-deficient
  mouse, this pathway is altered, with possible continuous activation of adenylate
  cyclase (AC), leading to increased MAPK activation (6) and cytokine secretion (7).
  Absence of (4) and (5) leads to over-production of inflammatory cytokines, especially
  IL-6 and IL-23 which promote a Th17 phenotype (8) and ultimately inflammation.
