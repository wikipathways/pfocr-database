caption: Antifungal high-carbon sugar nucleoside biosynthetic pathways. (A) Previously
  proposed malayamycin (Mal) and nikkomycin (Nik) biosynthetic pathways. The MalD
  and MalF functions were proposed based on gene knockout studies. (B) Revised nikkomycin
  (Nik)/polyoxin (Pol) and malayamycin (Mal) biosynthetic pathways. The nikkomycin/polyoxin
  pathways are based on a recent study, and the malayamycin pathway is the result
  of this study. The timing and mechanism of dephosphorylation remain unknown. In
  both panels, shown in parenthesis are enzymes whose functions are proposed without
  in vitro characterizations.
