caption: Time course metabolomics of in the central metabolic pathway (a) and amino
  acid metabolism (b). Relative abundances of metabolic intermediates in recombinant
  C. glutamicum strain KT01 during 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-AHBA) production
  under controlled dissolved oxygen (DO) levels at 0, 2.6, and 5.3 ppm using the DO-stat
  program in synthetic CGX II medium containing d-glucose as the sole carbon source
  are shown. The X-axis indicates cultivation time (h). For the profiling experiment,
  strain KT01 was grown under aerobic conditions until the late log phase in brain
  heart infusion medium, and the culture was then inoculated to an initial OD600 of
  0.2 into CGX II medium containing d-glucose as the sole carbon source (40 g/L).
  The cells were harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h of cultivation and subsequently subjected
  to metabolome analysis. Data are presented as average ± standard deviation calculated
  from the results of triplicate individual experiments. N.D. not determined below
  the detection limit
