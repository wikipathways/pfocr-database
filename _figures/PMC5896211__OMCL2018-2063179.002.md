caption: Molecular mechanisms involved in cachexia are modulated by oxidative stress.
  Atrophic factors can generate oxidative stress in skeletal muscle by the activation
  of different sources of reactive oxygen species, such as the mitochondria, xanthine
  oxidase (XO), and NADPH oxidase complex with Nox subunit, in addition to the decrease
  in antioxidant species. Oxidative stress is able to produce mitochondrial dysfunction,
  increase ubiquitin proteasome system activity, increase myonuclear apoptosis, decrease
  the protein synthesis pathway, and deregulate autophagy, all of which are involved
  in cachexia-skeletal muscle atrophy.
