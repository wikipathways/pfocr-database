caption: Schematic diagram showing insulin pathway in C. elegans. In C. elegans, the
  insulin signaling pathway involves AGE-1, the worm homolog of mammalian PI3K, which
  becomes activated upon the binding of an agonistic INS to the C. elegans insulin
  receptor, DAF-2. The phosphatase activity of DAF-18, the C. elegans homolog of mammalian
  PTEN negatively regulates the pathway. Activation of the insulin pathway inhibits
  DAF-16, the C. elegans homolog of mammalian FOXO, from translocating to the nucleus,
  where it regulates gene expression. (Created in https://BioRender.com)
