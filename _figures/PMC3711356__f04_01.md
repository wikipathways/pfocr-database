caption: The UVR8 photocycle.The UVR8 homodimer is monomerised by UV-B, with UV-B
  absorption proceeding via a tryptophan-based chromophore. The UVR8 monomer interacts
  directly with COP1 to initiate UV-B signaling. UVR8 monomer is redimerized through
  the action of RUP1 and RUP2, which disrupts the UVR8-COP1 interaction, inactivates
  the signaling pathway and regenerates the UVR8 homodimer again ready for UV-B perception.
