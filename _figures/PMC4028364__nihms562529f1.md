caption: Conservation of host cells and pathogen categories in zebrafish and mammalian
  infection by eukaryotes. The zebrafish is naturally infected by fungi, protozoans
  (microsporidian or dinoflagellate) and metazoans (myxozoan, cestodes or nematodes).
  In order to defend itself against pathogens, zebrafish use pathways conserved with
  mammals, with receptors such as TLRs or CLRs () as well as signaling pathways and
  molecules such as those involved in myelopoesis (), proinflammatory cytokines (),
  Th17 () and Th2 type-cytokines (; ) found in both fish and mammals. The cells participating
  in the immune response are also similar, with chemotaxis of both neutrophils and
  macrophages to sites of fungal infection () and activation of the NF-κB pathway
  in epithelial cells in response to the presence of fungi. Dendritic cells (), eosinophils
  (), and mast cells () are present in the juvenile zebrafish and eosinophils are
  able to respond to the presence of helminth secretory products (). In the adult
  zebrafish, B and T cells promote a specific adaptive immune response ().
