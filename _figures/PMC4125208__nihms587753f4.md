caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed TGF-beta signaling as the top
  “connected” network of differentially methylated candidates in HDM-exposed group.
  Candidates identified from MeDIP-seq are capitalized and in bold. The shapes of
  candidates in a picture represent the classifications of gene functions. PLCL2,
  P4HA2, PDE10A, and GAL3ST1 are classified as Enzymes. TGFB2, BMP2a, and IL36B are
  classified as Cytokine/Growth Factors. TRPM2 are Ion Channels. PRKG2 is a Kinase.
  CREBZF, SMAD2, and SKI are classified as Transcription Regulator. MSR1 and IL6R
  belong to Transmembrane Receptor. SLC25A12 belongs to Transporter. UNC93B1, FAM198B
  and CARTPT are classified as unknown functions. Solid line: direct interaction;
  broken line: indirect interaction. Candidates indicated by red circle were found
  to be significantly methylated and expressed (*P < 0.05 in comparison with saline-exposed
  mice) as assayed by quantitative MSPCR and RTPCR. [Color figure can be viewed in
  the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]'
