caption: 'Association of cytoplasmic peptidyl Cys with functional networks according
  to reduction and oxidation of Cys residues. Percent reduction values for the 20%
  most reduced Cys (Panel A) and the 20% most oxidized Cys (Panel B) were analyzed
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). In this analysis, symbols with colors represent
  proteins associated with peptides identifed with percent oxidation data in . Open
  symbols represent components of the functional network for which data were not available.
  Asterisks indicate that multiple identifers in the dataset fle map to a single gene/chemical
  in the global molecular network. In A, the top network associations of the most
  highly reduced Cys were with cancer, gastrointestinal disease, cellular assembly
  and organization and protein synthesis (Score 58). A large number of these proteins
  are associated with the cytoskeleton. In B, the most oxidized peptides had network
  associations with cancer, cell signaling and post-translational modifcation (Score
  51). Abbreviations: ACTB, beta-actin; ACTN4, alpha-actinin-4; AIMP2, aminoacyl tRNA
