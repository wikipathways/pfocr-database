caption: 'The mammalian UPR. In most mammalian cells, three UPR branches were identified:
  the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP pathway, the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway, and the ATF6 pathway.
  The functions of the three pathways overlap and are redundant in many cell types.
  However, complete ablation of any of the three branches causes embryonic/perinatal
  death in mice, suggesting their unique and essential role at the physiological level.
  See “” section for details. ATF6, activating transcription factor 6; PERK, pancreatic
  ER eIF2α kinase; UPR, unfolded protein response.'
