caption: Schematic representation of the proposed model to explain NHR-49/PPARα function
  in promoting the longevity of germline-less animals (modified from Ratnappan et al.,).
  Following germline loss, NHR-49/PPARα is upregulated by the joint activity of DAF-16/FOXO3A
  and TCER-1/TCERG1. NHR-49/PPARα, in turn, mediates the upregulation of genes involved
  in fatty-acid β−oxidation and desaturation. The synchronized enhancement of these
  processes allows the animal to adapt to loss of fertility and orchestrate a lipid-homeostasis
  profile that supports longevity. NHR-49/PPARα and NHR-71/HNF4, another NHR essential
  for germline-less longevity, are required for the upregulation of DAF-16/FOXO3A
  targets previously shown to be elevated upon germline loss, such as sod-3, stdh-1
  and mdt-15. Loss of nhr-49 causes membrane relocation of KRI-1, the only known common
  upstream regulator of DAF-16/FOXO3A and TCER-1/TCERG1, suggesting that NHR-49/PPARα
  may operate in a feedback loop to potentiate the activity of this pathway by regulating
  KRI-1 sub-cellular localization. Our data suggest that NHR-71/HNF4, similar to NHR-49/PPARα,
  may be upregulated by DAF-16/FOXO3A and TCER-1/TCERG1. MDT-15, a known co-regulator
  of NHR-49/PPARα, may also contribute to the increased expression of β-oxidation
  genes. Regulatory steps for which evidence is provided by our data are indicated
  by red arrows. Putative relationships suggested by our observations are represented
  by gray, stippled arrows.
