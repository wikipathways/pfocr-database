caption: TH action and its regulation by TH transporters and deiodinases. T3 binds
  the TR/RXR heterodimer attached to a TRE in the regulatory region of TH-responsive
  genes. The ability of TR/RXR to affect gene transcription is modulated by coactivators/corepressors
  (CoA/CoR) and factors regulating intracellular TH availability, TH transporters
  (THT) and TH deiodinases. As the first step in the regulation of TH action, D2 activates
  T4 by converting it to T3. Type 3 deiodinase (D3) catalyses the inactivating pathway
  by degrading T3 and converting T4 to the inactive reverse T3. The expression of
  the two main deiodinases, D2 and D3, varies according to cell type.
