caption: Schematic view of the metabolic pathway associated with bleomycin synthesis
  in S. verticillus. The precursors for bleomycin production were represented by colored
  rectangular boxes. The dashed arrows indicated that there were multiple reaction
  steps in this line. EMP, Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway; PP, Pentose Phosphate pathway;
  PEP, Phosphoenolpyruvate; PRPP, 5-Phosphoribosyl 1-Pyrophosphate; TCA, Tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; AKG, α-Ketoglutaric acid
