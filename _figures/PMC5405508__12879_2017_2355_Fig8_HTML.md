caption: 'Network analysis of inflammatory genes modulated in response to V3000 and
  V3034 infections in brain. Genes significantly modulated against (a) V3000 and (b)
  V3034 infection in brain at 96 h pi were used to perform in silico network analysis
  using the Ingenuity Pathway analysis software. V3000 infection resulted in enhanced
  inflammation by significantly upregulating the genes causing leukocyte migration,
  T cell migration, recruitment of lymphocytes, NK cell migration, infiltration of
  granulocytes and neutrophil movement. V3034, on the other hand, only resulted in
  enhanced infiltration of granulocytes and neutrophil cell movement to some extent.
  Legends: : leads to activation, : leads to inhibition, : finding inconsistent with
  the state of downstream molecule, : effect not predicted, : upregulated, : downregulated,
  : not expressed; intensity of the color is directly proportional to the level of
  modulation'
