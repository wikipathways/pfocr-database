caption: Communication between the gastrointestinal tract and cerebral lymphatic system
  is mediated directly and indirectly by immune, neural and endocrine pathways. (A)
  Changes in the gut microbiota occur when inflammatory damage occurs in the gut.
  Pathogenic microorganisms and their products, inflammatory factors, pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (MAMPs, PAMPs), TLRs, and TREMs-positive activated macrophages
  may reach the brain through blood circulation and lymphatic circulation, which in
  turn affect the function of cerebral lymphatic system. (B) Some neurotransmitters
  (e.g., serotonin) also act on astrocytes and lead to activation of related pathways,
  which in turn affects the function of cerebral lymphatic system. (C) The gut microbiota
  can regulate hormones related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which
  in turn affects the function of cerebral lymphatic system
