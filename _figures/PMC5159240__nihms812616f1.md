caption: 'The genomic locus for HER2 is amplified in ~20 % of human BCs, and is associated
  with aggressive disease with shorter overall and disease-free survival []. The protein
  is overexpressed in ~30 % of BCs in our samples [] suggesting additional mechanisms
  for HER2 overexpression exist. The signaling pathways stimulated by the ligand NRG
  activates ErbB2:ErbB3 (HER2:HER3) heterodimers [, ]. Following ligand engagement,
  HER3 engages and allosterically activates its kinase partner, in this case HER2.
  Although HER2 molecules make both homo-and hetero-dimers, HER3 do not form homodimers,
  and does not have protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Phosphorylation of its C-terminal
  tail leads to recruitment of adapter proteins leading to activation of Pi3k and
  Ras pathways []. Activation of Pi3k leads to phosphorylation of membrane phosphoinositides
  producing Pip3, which in turn docks the PH domain-containing proteins Pdk1 and Akt
  []. Membrane - bound Akt is phosphorylated and activated by Pdk1. Activated Akt
  proceeds to phosphorylate a plethora of cellular substrates involved in diverse
  biological processes. These processes include accelerated G1-S progression as demonstrated
  by increased cyclin D1 and decreased p27Kip1 levels, and enhanced cell survival
  through increased phosphorylation of Bad and increased NF-κB levels [, ]. Indeed
  aberrant overexpression of cyclin D1 is frequently observed in human cancers, caused
  by different mechanisms [, ]. The Jak-Stat pathway activation by HER2:HER3 also
  leads to cell proliferation through cyclin D1 induction. The signaling cascades
  also stimulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition through stimulation of Hsf1-Slug
  signaling to cause invasion/metastasis []. Thus deregulation of HER2/HER3 can lead
  to tumorigenesis. Aberrant overexpression of HER2 activates the Dmp1 promoter to
  stimulate the Arf-Mdm2-p53 self-autonomous tumor surveillance pathway through Pi3k-Akt-NF-κB
  and Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk-Jun cascades to eliminate incipient cancer cells by cell cycle
  arrest or apoptosis [, ]. D-type cyclins inhibit the transcriptional activity of
  Dmp1α in a Cdk-independent fashion on promoters without E2F sites [, ], but cyclin
  D1 collaborates with Dmp1α in Ink4a and Arf transactivation [, ]. Tumor surveillance
  by the DMP1-p53 pathway is mediated by DMP1α, but not DMP1β, since the latter is
  an oncogenic splice variant that blocks the tumor-suppressive activity of DMP1α
  []; it also has p53-independent functions for cell proliferation, and is a novel
  marker for BC [, ]. Dmp1*: these are identical molecules.'
