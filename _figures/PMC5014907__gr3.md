caption: Schematic representation of CD4+ T cell activation by antigen presenting
  cells and the IL-12/STAT4 pathway. Antigen activates APC through TLR, which in turn
  produce IL-12 after phosphorylation of IRF5. Antigen is presented to CD4+ T cells
  by HLA II with co-stimulation via CD80 and 86 to CD28. There is competitive inhibition
  of this co-stimulation by CTLA4. IL-12 activates a cascade of signaling factors
  including NFKB and STAT4 to promote the production of Th1-type cytokines including
  TNFα and IFNγ; the transcription factor IRF8 is involved. IL7R supports lymphocyte
  development. There is positive feedback from Th1 cytokines to APCs. Red text denotes
  confirmed risk associations with PBC; blue text putative associations. Arrows denote
  positive effects; barred lines denote negative effects. APC = antigen-presenting
  cell; CD = cluster of differentiation; CTLA4 = Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4;
  HLA II = human leucocyte antigen class II; IFN-γ = interferon-γ; IFNγR = interferon-γ
  receptor; IL-12 = interleukin-12; IL-12Rβ1/2 and IL-12 receptor β subunits 1 and
  2; IL7R = interleukin-7 receptor; IRF5 and IRF8 = interferon response factors 5
  and 8; JAK2 = Janus kinase 2; Lck = lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase;
  NFKB = nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enchancer of activated B cells; PKC = protein
  kinase C; SOCS1 = suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; STAT4 = signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 4; TCR = T-cell receptor; TLR = Toll-like receptor;
