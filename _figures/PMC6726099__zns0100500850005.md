caption: 'Conditioned immunosuppression model. The present results indicate that the
  IC may play an associative role being necessary to acquire and evoke the behavioral
  conditioned immune response. The Am seems to mediate the input of visceral information
  that is required at the acquisition time, whereas VMH lesions disrupt the brain
  to immune communication necessary to evoke the immunological conditioned response.
  At the acquisition time, there are two main possible afferent routes for the UCS
  (intraperitoneal CsA): indirect afferent route, the CsA may disrupt the peripheral
  cytokine homeostasis, which could be detected by the CNS immunesensing capacities
  (e.g., vagus nerve); direct afferent route, the CsA might reach the CNS through
  those brain areas with a weak BBB, like circumventricular organs, subsequently signaling
  to forebrain structures. At the evocation time, the neocortical-immune axis, with
  hypothalamic relays (VMH/LHA) and sympathetic peripheral mechanism, seems to be
  the efferent pathway through which the brain is able to modify peripheral immune
  functions. CR, Conditioned response; CVOs, circumventricular organs.'
