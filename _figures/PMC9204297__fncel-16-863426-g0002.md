caption: Pyroptosis, neuron damage, and neurological diseases. Pyroptosis is a potential
  target for the pathological mechanism and treatment of various neurological diseases,
  such as brain infection, hemorrhagic/ischemic injury, Huntington's disease, AD,
  or PD. SAE, H/R, TBI, OGD/R, isoflurane, Aβ, LPS, or HIV-gp120 stimulate NLRP3-mediated
  pyroptosis, resulting in increased caspase-1 activity in the brain and the release
  of a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18. I/R induces
  the release of dsDNA and activates AIM2 to induce neuronal pyroptosis. In addition,
  reduced LDLR, IncRNA-H19, ROS, and MDA lead to severe neuronal pyroptosis by activating
  the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway. SAH, TREM-1-activated microglial pyroptosis
  induced by NLRP3 inflammasome, and the use of TREM-1 inhibitor LP17 significantly
  ameliorated this damage. MCAO, induced by lncRNA MEG3, promotes AIM2-induced pyroptosis
  by sponging miR-485. NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950, olaparib, fluoxetine, CY-09, IGF-1,
  hypothermia, baicalein, celastrol, salidroside, melatonin, rapamycin, and salvianolic
  acid significantly reduce neuronal injury by inhibiting pyroptosis. AC-YVAD-CMK
  inhibits caspase-1 activation. Atorvastatin and melatonin inhibit NLRP1 expression.
  Osteocalcin inhibits the activation of GSDMD, thereby inhibiting pyroptosis. SAE,
  sepsis-associated encephalopathy; H/R, hypoxia/reoxygenation; TBI, traumatic brain
  injury; OGD/R, oxyglucose deprivation and reoxygenation; Aβ, amyloid β; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  NLRP3, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein
  3; (IL)-1β, interleukin; AD, Alzheimer's disease; PD, Parkinson's disease; I/R,
  ischemia-reperfusion; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; AIM2, the absent in melanoma 2;
  LDLR, the low-density lipoprotein receptor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MDA, malondialdehyde;
  GSDMD, gasdermin D; SAH, subarachnoid hemorrhage; TREM-1, trigger receptor expressed
  on myeloid cells 1; MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion; lncRNA MEG3, long non-coding
  RNA maternally expressed gene 3; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; ASC, the adapter
  protein apoptotic speck-like protein containing CARD.
