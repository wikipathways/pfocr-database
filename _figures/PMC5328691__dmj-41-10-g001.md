caption: . Canonical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein response
  (UPR) pathways in mammals. Homeostatic perturbations leads to the accumulation of
  unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER, which causes the dissociation of binding
  protein/glucose-regulated protein 78 (BiP/GRP78) from the luminal domain of three
  ER stress sensors PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1),
  and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) to exert its chaperone function. BiP/GRP78
  dissociation renders PERK to undergo dimerization and transphosphorylation, and
  activation of its kinase activity, which then phosphorylates Ser51 on eukaryotic
  initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) to decrease global protein translation but selectively
  increases translation of ATF4 mRNA. ATF4 acting as a transcription factor induces
  expression of UPR target genes involved in amino acid (AA) biosynthesis, anti-oxidant
  response, and apoptosis. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) as one of direct ATF4 target
  genes subsequently activates expression of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible
  protein (GADD34), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which contributes
  to dephosphorylation of eIF2α to resume protein translation. ER oxidoreductin 1
  (ERO1), another CHOP target gene, is an ER oxidoreductase. IRE1, the most conserved
  branch of UPR pathways throughout eukaryotes also undergoes dimerization (or oligomerization),
  transphosphorylation, and activation of endoRNase activity. This RNase function
  removes a 26-base intron from X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) mRNA to generate Xbp1s,
  a shorter spliced form of Xbp1 mRNA (XBP1s). XBP1s, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP)
  transcription factor controls a diverse range of UPR target genes including protein
  fold, ER-associated degradation (ERAD), trafficking, lipogenesis, inflammation,
  etc. This RNase activity also leads to a regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of
  mRNA to reduce protein loading in the ER. Activation of ATF6 translocates from ER
  to Golgi apparatus with unknown processes where it is proteolytically cleaved by
  the Ser protease site 1 and site 2 proteases (S1P/S2P), generating ATF6(n), n-terminal
  truncated form of bZIP transcription factor. ATF6(n) activates the expression of
  its target genes involved in protein folding, ERAD, and ER biogenesis. Overall,
  activation of each sensor generates bZIP transcription factor ATF4, XBP1s, and ATF6(n),
  respectively that induces the expression of their relevant target genes associated
  with protein-folding fidelity, ERAD, ER biogenesis, lipogenesis, inflammation, amino
  acid biosynthesis, anti-oxidant response, etc. Both PERK and IRE1 contribute to
  reducing protein loading in the ER by suppressing global protein translation via
  phosphorylation of eIF2α and triggering RIDD of mRNA, respectively. Therefore, ER
  stress is alleviated by various feedback mechanisms from three branches of UPR pathways
  at the level of transcription, post-transcription or translation. However, prolonged
  and unmitigated ER stress induces apoptosis by ATF4-CHOP pathway.
