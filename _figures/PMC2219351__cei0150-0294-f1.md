caption: Schematic illustration of mRNA expression levels significantly altered both
  in duodenal biopsy samples from untreated coeliac disease patients and in undifferentiated
  epithelial T84 cells in the epithelial cell differentiation model. Expression levels
  of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), related to the N terminus of tre (RN-tre),
  ephrin B2, Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein family member 1 (WAVE1), diacylglycerol
  kinase D (DGKD), phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PI3KR1), fused
  toes homologue (FTS), mature T cell proliferation (MTCP1) and β-catenin were increased
  in untreated coeliac disease and in undifferentiated cell culture samples. Red colour
  indicates a significant up-regulation of mRNA expression both in duodenal biopsy
  samples and in the epithelial cell differentiation model. White indicates genes
  not mutually altered. Yellow circles indicate the outcome of the pathway. The figure
  was drawn according to the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) (http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/).
