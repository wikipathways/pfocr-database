caption: Core components of the Hippo pathway in mammals. The core of the Hippo pathway
  is a kinase cascade primarily composed of MST1/2 and LATS1/2. MST1/2, in conjunction
  with SAV1, phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2 kinase. Subsequently, LATS1/2 kinase
  binds to MOB1 to phosphorylate the downstream effector molecules YAP1 and TAZ. Phosphorylated
  YAP1 and TAZ bind to 14-3-3 and remain in the cytoplasm, losing their transcriptional
  co-activation abilities. When Hippo signaling pathway activity is inhibited, YAP1
  and TAZ undergo dephosphorylation. The dephosphorylated YAP1/TAZ translocate to
  the nucleus, where they interact with other transcription factors, including TEAD,
  to induce gene expression that promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis.
  CTGF and CYR61 are among the targets identified for YAP1 and TAZ. MST1/2, mammalian
  STE20-like 1/2; SAV1, salvador homologue 1; LATS1/2, large tumor suppressor 1/2;
  YAP1, yes-associated protein 1; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding
  motif; TEAD, TEA domain family member; AREG, amphiregulin; CTGF, connective tissue
  growth factor; CYR61, cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61; AXL, AXL receptor tyrosine
  kinase; NUAK2, NUAK family SNF1-like kinase 2; MOB1, MOB kinase activator 1; P,
  phosphate
