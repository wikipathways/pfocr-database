caption: TNF-α/TGF-β2 co-stimulation activates the ERK, JNK, and p38MAPK pathways,
  Smad2/3 pathway, and mTOR pathway. Activation of the MAPKs and the Smad pathway
  induces EMT (downregulation of E-cadherin with upregulation of fibronectin and α-SMA),
  and also upregulates MMPs and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and VEGF. Activation
  of the mTOR pathway leads to cell proliferation. These changes disrupt the static
  RPE cell monolayer, leading to the formation of piled up cellular aggregates. When
  AICAR enters a cell, it is converted to ZMP, which mimics AMP that in turn activates
  AMPK and its downstream target, ACC. DPY prevents AICAR from entering the cell;
  AMDA inhibits AICAR’s conversion to ZMP. AICAR suppresses aggregate formation by
  inhibiting the ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, and mTOR pathways, at least partially via activation
  of AMPK.
