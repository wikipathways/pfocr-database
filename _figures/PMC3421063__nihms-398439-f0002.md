caption: Proposed mechanisms leading to VEGF signaling pathway inhibitor-induced hypertension.
  a) Activation of VEGFR-2 by VEGF-A leads to subsequent activation of multiple pathways
  including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT. PI3K-AKT phosphorylates and
  activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), increasing NO production. NO
  migrates to adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells, binds soluble guanylate cyclase
  (sGC) leading to cGMP generation and subsequent vasodilation mediated by cGMP-dependent
  kinases. When VEGF signaling pathway is inhibited, NO pathway is suppressed and
  ET-1 pathway is stimulated, promoting vasoconstriction and subsequent hypertension.
  The source of ET-1 is unknown. b) VEGF maintains capillary network integrity. When
  VEGF signaling pathway is inhibited, rarefaction, or reduction of the density of
  capillary beds, may occur.
