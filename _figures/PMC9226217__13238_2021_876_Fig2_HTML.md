caption: Closed-loop-mediated cell-based therapies. (A) Cell-to-cell mediated control
  of designer cells. This approach utilizes an antigen (biomarker) exposed on the
  surface of the targeted cell, and a physical interaction is needed for activation
  of the designer cell. SUPRA is a generalized CAR platform that enables a unique
  T cell to bind to different user-defined antigens and to trigger an endogenous signaling
  pathway upon activation. SynNotch relies on cleavage of a chimeric receptor after
  cell-cell interaction. The cleaved intracellular domain of synNotch translocates
  to the nucleus and initiates transcription of a desired therapeutic gene. Another
  cell-contact sensor is based on physical segregation of CD43ex-45int. In the absence
  of a target cell, CD43ex-45int suppresses an implemented JAK/STAT pathway. Once
  the designer cell binds to a targeted cell, CD43ex-45int is segregated from the
  cell–cell interface due to the physical force applied to the large extracellular
  domain of CD43ex-45int. Therefore, the JAK/STAT pathway will be activated and initiate
  expression of a therapeutic protein. (B) Metabolite-mediated closed-loop systems.
  A high level of soluble biomarker can stimulate designer cells to produce therapeutic
  agents to balance the level of the biomarker. In an immunomimetic cell, a TLR platform
  is used to activate the NFκB pathway and express an antibacterial peptide (lysostaphin)
  to treat MRSA. The β-cell-mimetic designer cell is designed to sense a high level
  of glucose in a diabetic model and to produce insulinogenic proteins (insulin and
  hGLP1) through expression of Cav1.3 on HEK293 cells rewired to a synthetic expression
  unit. The biomedical tattoo utilizes a designer cell that enables early disease
  detection by sensing a high level of calcium, and produces tyrosinase upon activation.

  cells
