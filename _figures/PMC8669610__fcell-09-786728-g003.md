caption: TGF-β signaling and resistance to chemotherapy; Multiple miRNAs are implicated
  in TGF-β-induced chemotherapy resistance in various cancer types by targeting components
  of the TGF-β pathway (SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4). Anti-microtubule drugs promote Bcl-2
  protein ubiquitination, which could be inhibited by TGF-β signaling to induce taxane
  resistance in malignancies. Hyperactivation of TGF-β signaling pathway induces resistance
  to DNA damaging agents and anti-metabolites through the activation of alternative
  survival pathways or anti-apoptotic signaling such as PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways,
  as well as elevated expression of ABC multi-drug transporters to facilitate cancer
  cell survival and drug efflux, respectively.
