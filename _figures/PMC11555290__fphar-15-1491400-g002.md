caption: '(By Figdraw, ID: RYWAR2b2b6) Fibrosis facilitates malignant tumor progression:
  (A) enhances tumor proliferation, (B) promotes immune evasion, (C) drives angiogenesis,
  (D) increases treatment resistance (A) Malignant tumors enhance tumor cell proliferation
  by secreting TGF-β, which activates pathways such as PI3K-AKT and MAPK/ERK. Furthermore,
  the increased tissue stiffness from fibrosis promotes tumor cell proliferation via
  mechanotransduction pathways (like the YAP pathway). (B) The interaction between
  Treg cells and CAFs not only promotes fibrosis but also intensifies immunosuppression.
  Moreover, the dense ECM structure resulting from fibrosis obstructs immune cell
  infiltration and aids tumor cells in evading immune surveillance by upregulating
  PD-L1 expression. (C) CAFs enhance the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors like
  VEGF and PDGF via the regulation of non-coding RNAs and signaling pathways such
  as JAK, thereby promoting tumor angiogenesis. The excessive deposition of ECM provides
  a physical scaffold for new blood vessel formation, supporting vascular expansion
  within the dense matrix. Additionally, excessive ECM accumulation restricts oxygen,
  activating HIF-1 and further promoting angiogenesis. (D) Fibrosis facilitates treatment
  resistance in malignant tumors through multiple mechanisms, including CSC activation,
  EMT induction, apoptosis inhibition, enhanced DNA damage repair, and reduced drug
  uptake, thereby weakening the efficacy of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy'
