caption: Signaling through PAK in the hyperosmotic response pathway.  Increased osmotic
  pressure signals to PI3K, resulting in the accumulation of  phosphoinositides, which
  can be reversed by pTEN activity. This may lead to  recruitment and activation of
  downstream effectors such as PDK1 and Rho-GEFs  through their pleckstrin homology
  domains. PAK may be activated by Cdc42 via  RhoGEF activity or directly by PDK1
  phosphorylation. PAK binding to its  partners PIX and GIT1, which targets the kinase
  to focal adhesions, is  required for its activation. Osmotic pressure also activates
  MAPK signaling,  and the MEK-ERK pathway is required for stress-induced focal adhesion  disassembly
  and full PAK activation. It is unclear whether phosphoinositide  generation links
  to MEK-ERK activation and whether MEK or ERK directly  phosphorylates PAK in this
  pathway. Activated PAK acts locally at focal  adhesions to promote turnover but
  also dissociates from them and targets to  the p38 complex, which in turn regulates
  transcriptional response. A  PAK-independent pathway is also likely to act on p38,
  as PAK inhibition by KID  overexpression did not fully abolish p38 phosphorylation.
  PP2Cα may act  on focal adhesion-associated PAK and on the dissociated PAK and p38
  complex to  down-regulate the MAPK response. Dashed lines represent intermediate  or
  unknown steps between the signaling components.
