caption: 'Different model-based explanations for the switch-like behaviour. (A) Hypoxia
  causes the oxygen-dependent HIF degradation rate (Kdeg) via PHD and VHL to be lower
  than the oxygen-independent HIF synthesis rate (K0) []. (B) Hypoxia causes the oxygen-dependent
  HIF degradation pathway (Flux 1) via PHD and VHL to be lower than the oxygen-independent
  pathway (Flux 2) []. (C) Oxygen regulates the activity of PHD as well as the HIF
  nuclear export and the dissociation rates for HIF: HRE and HIF-1α/1β complexes [].'
