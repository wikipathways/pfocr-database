caption: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) trigger dissociation of Gα and Gβγ heterotrimeric
  G proteins upon agonist stimulation. Uncoupled heterotrimer subunits elicit signaling
  cascades through downstream effector proteins. Many of these pathways elicit functional
  responses through signaling to PLD in multiple ways (). In the canonical pathway,
  upon agonist stimulation, GTP-Gαq stimulates PLCβ hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2, producing
  DAG and IP3 (see excellent reviews by Rhee 2001 on PLC subtype activation, Hubbard
  and Hepler 2006 for review on Gq family, and Harden review in this issue). IP3 triggers
  calcium release from the ER, and this coupled with DAG synergistically activates
  PKCα, which in turn bimodally activates PLD (discussed in section 10.3.4.2). Litosch
  and colleagues recently showed that this PLCβ signaling is potentiated by PLD-produced
  PA., Dissociated Gβγ also activates PLCβ, to indirectly activate PLD in a PKC-dependent
  manner. Additionally, Preninger et al. demonstrated that the Gβγ subunit of the
  heterotrimer can directly inhibit PLD activity via interactions through the PLD
  catalytic domain. Gβγ interaction disrupts both basal and Arf-stimulated activity.,
  As illustrated in , levels of PLD activation are intricately titrated in response
  to specific agonist-mediated or intracellular circumstances.
