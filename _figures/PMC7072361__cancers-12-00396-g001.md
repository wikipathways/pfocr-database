caption: 'Schematic representation of the potential role of podocalyxin (PODXL) in
  mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) progression. PODXL induces cell survival,
  proliferation, and drug resistance in mature B- NHL cells, likely through the activation
  of activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Additionally, PODXL promotes glutaminolysis, lipogenesis,
  and pentose phosphate pathway via activation of glutaminase 1 (GLS1), fatty acid
  synthase (FASN), and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), respectively, which
  would generate biomolecules and reducing agents necessary for tumor cell survival,
  proliferation, and drug resistance. This metabolic reprogramming may be mediated
  by PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. The PODXL-induced B-NHL-resistance to obinutuzumab
  could be due to the capacity of PODXL to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton. In addition
  to this, PODXL favors cell-to-cell adhesion in B-NHL by a beta2-integrin-mediated
  process, which would lead to cell survival. PODXL also enhances chemotaxis of B-NHL
  cells towards C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), which is released by stromal
  cells of distant sites and binds to C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), a
  chemokine receptor that interacts with PODXL. NHERF1: Na+/H+-exchanger regulatory
  factor; PPP: pentose phosphate pathway.'
