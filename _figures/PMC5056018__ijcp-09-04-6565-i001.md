caption: 'Pathways of estrogen regulation of gene expression have been shown. In the
  classical estrogen signaling, estrogen (E) binds estrogen receptors (ERs), induces
  dimerization of the protein, and activates gene expression through binding to estrogen
  response elements (EREs) in the promoter of target genes, in complex with co-activators
  (CoAs) and histone acetyl transferases (HATs). Activation of signaling events downstream
  of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can also lead to ER phosphorylation (P) through
  Erk or Akt serine/threonine kinases and subsequent ligand-independent activation
  of ER. Estrogen signaling can also be mediated through non-genomic mechanisms by
  ER in the cytoplasm or membrane. Ligand binding leads to the formation of functional
  protein complexes that involve other signaling pathways, resulting in transcription
  factor (TF) activation. For instance, ligand binding leads to methylation (M) of
  ER, and subsequent formation of the ER-PI3K-Src-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) complex
  which activates Akt, and ultimately alters gene expression. GF: Growth factor; RE:
  Response element; VEGF: Vascular endothelial growth factor; IGFR1: Insulin-like
  growth factor receptor 1; TGFα: Transforming growth factor α.'
