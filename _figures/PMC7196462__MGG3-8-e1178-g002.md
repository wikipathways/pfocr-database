caption: Roles of SMAD3 in the TGF‐β and the BMP pathway. The SMAD3 protein gets activated
  through TGF‐β signaling and can act in different downstream pathways. If SMAD3 binds
  to TRIM33, a chromatin reading and remodeling protein, the complex opens the histone
  to allow other TFs to enter the DNA. Complexes of SMAD3 and SMAD4 get recruited
  to different genes, and the transcription of a specific gene is determined by varying
  partner TFs. In those effector pathways SMAD3 is involved in chondrocyte and osteoblast
  maturation (Massagué, ). If SMAD3 binds to DROSHA it regulates the processing of
  different miRNA precursors. SMAD3 forming a complex with other SMAD proteins driven
  by BMP signaling also activates transcription via other TFs, regulating various
  bone formation processes (Rahman et al., ). TGF‐β, transforming growth factor‐β;
  TFs, transcription factors
