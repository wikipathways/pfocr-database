caption: Schematic representation of major glycosphingolipid biosynthesis pathways,
  highlighting GSLs participating in pathogen binding. Biosynthesis of GSLs proceeds
  in the endomembrane system, beginning in the endoplasmic reticulum by ceramide synthesis
  from sphingoid base and acyl-CoA, and continues in the Golgi apparatus. Ceramide
  may be galactosylated in the ER (producing GalCer) or transported to the cis-Golgi
  to produce GlcCer and LacCer. LacCer is used for the production of more complex
  GSLs by specific Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases, creating several GSL series
  pathways. LacCer is utilized by (1) β1,4-N-acetylgalactosylaminyltransferase (B4GALNT1)
  initiating the asialo series; (2) β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (B3GNT5),
  producing Lc3, which is converted to Lc4, the precursor for the lacto and neolacto
  series GSLs; (3) α1,4-galactosyltransferase (A4GALT), producing Gb3, thus initiating
  the globo series pathway; (4) α2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3GAL5), producing GM3, which
  belongs to the ganglio series. The ABO histo-blood group antigens are subsequently
  formed from the H antigen (it is also the precursor of the Leb antigen, belonging
  to the Lewis blood group system) by specific GTs; α1,3-N-acetylgalactosyltransferase
  (A transferase) synthesizes the A antigen, while α1,3-galactosyltransferase (B transferase)
  synthesizes the B antigen. The Lea and Lex blood group antigens are created by fucosyltransferase
  3. More complex glycan structures of ganglio-series GSLs are formed by a sequential
  action of different GTs, such as N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, galactosyltransferases
  and sialyltransferases, producing the GM2, GM1a and GD1a gangliosides. GM3 may be
  further processed by α2,8-sialyltransferase 1, forming GD3. GSLs in green play roles
  in interactions with pathogens. Glycosyltransferases involved in GSL synthesis are
  shown in red [Figure was created with BioRender.com].
