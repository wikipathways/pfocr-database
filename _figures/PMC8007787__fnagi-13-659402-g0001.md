caption: The reverse transsulfuration pathway and inputs from associated pathways.
  Transsulfuration refers to the transfer of sulfur from homocysteine to cysteine.
  Dietary methionine is converted to homocysteine, via S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
  and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Homocysteine is condensed with serine by cystathionine
  β-synthase (CBS) to form cystathionine, which is utilized by cystathionine γ-lyase
  (CSE) to generate cysteine. Cysteine can either enter the glutathione (GSH) biosynthetic
  pathway or be utilized as a substrate for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) biosynthesis. CBS
  generates H2S efficiently from a combination of cysteine and homocysteine, whereas
  CSE can utilize either cysteine or homocysteine by itself to generate the gaseous
  signaling molecule. A third enzyme, 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST)
  also generates H2S. 3-MST utilizes the 3-mercaptopyruvate generated by cysteine
  aminotransferase (CAT) by forming a persulfide on its active site (R-SH to R-SSH).
  The persulfide releases H2S in the presence of a reductant (R’-SH). Cysteine is
  converted to GSH by the sequential action of glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCL) and
  glutathione synthase (GS). Homocysteine is at the junction of the transsulfuration
  and remethylation pathway (where methionine is regenerated from homocysteine). Remethylation
  of homocysteine occurs in both a folate-independent and dependent pathway. In the
  folate-independent pathway, betaine/trimethylglycine (derived from choline) donates
  methyl groups in a reaction catalyzed by betaine–homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT) to generate methionine. In the folate-dependent pathway, the vitamin B12-dependent
  enzyme, methionine synthase (MS), converts homocysteine to methionine and tetrahydrofolate
  (THF), where 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) acts as the methyl group donor. THF
  is converted to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) by serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT) which utilizes serine and vitamin B6. 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
  (MTHFR), then reduces 5,10-MTHF to 5-MTHF, which remethylates another molecule of
  homocysteine. MTHFR uses flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD; the active form of vitamin
  B2) as a cofactor.
