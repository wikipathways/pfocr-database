caption: Local recycling of receptors through endosomes occurs at axon tips and in
  the soma as well as in dendrites. For some receptors, the endocytic pathways, endosomal
  compartments, and endosomal regulators are known. For instance, L1/NgCAM enters
  somatic endosomes by an EHD1/EHD4-sensitive endocytosis pathway and is sorted via
  EEA1-, and NEEP21-positive endosomes into a long-distance anterograde transport
  pathway (transcytosis). Neurotrophin receptors also enter somatodendritic endosomes
  via a dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway. They can be sorted into recycling endosomes
  either back to the somatic surface or to the axon via rab11-positive endosomal carriers
  (transcytosis). Whether or not EHD1 or NEEP21-containing compartments are involved
  in transcytotic sorting of Trk receptors is not established. At axon tips, many
  receptors are endocytosed via several different endocytic route, including EHD4/pincher
  for Trk receptors and NogoΔ20, clathrin for p75NTR, and numb/AP-2 for L1/NgCAM.
  Sorting of neurotrophin receptors into local recycling, or long-distance retrograde
  transport routes occurs in endosomes which are poorly characterized since axonal
  endosomes lack typical markers of early endosomes, such as EEA1. Rab proteins (especially
  rab5 and rab7) are crucial in regulating sorting decisions into either local recycling,
  long-range degradative, or long-range signaling pathways, but the exact nature of
  rabs involved is controversial. For L1/NgCAM and NogoΔ20, the involvement of rabs
  or other endosomal regulators in local/long-range sorting in axon tips has not been
  investigated.
