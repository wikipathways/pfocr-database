caption: Schematic depiction of the signal transduction events occurring in microglia
  following P2X7 receptor activation. Extracellular calcium influx triggered by activation
  of ionotropic P2X7 receptors leads to activation of calcineurin and dephosphorylation/activation
  of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells). P2X7 receptor activation also results
  in activation of phospholipases A2 and D (PLA2, PLD), as well as tyrosine phosphorylation
  (P-Tyr) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway proteins
  (MAPK kinase, MEK; extracellular signal-regulated kinase, ERK). The latter can then
  influence the activity of transcription factors like NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB),
  CREB (cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding protein), and AP-1 (activator protein-1)
  which upregulate expression of pro-inflammatory genes, such as cyclooxgenase-2 (COX-2)
  and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Activation of P2X7 receptors also leads
  to p38 MAPK activation with consequent phosphorylation/activation of CREB. Broken
  lines indicate multistep pathways.
