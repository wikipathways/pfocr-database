caption: 'Simplified schema demonstrating proposed mGluR–eEF2–AMPAR pathway: Postsynaptic
  binding of glutamate leads to activation of ionotropic (AMPAR, NMDAR shown) and
  metabatropic (mGlu1/5 shown) glutamate receptors. Activation of mGlu1/5 leads to
  Gq activation of PLC (not shown) and the mTOR pathway that can affect the activity
  of Ei4FE and initiation of local RNA translation. Binding of Ca2+/CaM to EEF2K releases
  eEF2K-Ca/CaM complex from mGlu1/5 and scaffolding protein Homer. EEF2K-CaM phosphorylates
  EEF2 and switches its activity in global RNA translation to specific RNA translation
  including CaMK2α and Arc. CaMK2α and Arc interact with AMPARs and with downstream
  proteins to modulate trafficking of AMPARs in the postsynaptic membrane and regulate
  synaptic plasticity. AMPAR, α-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-4-isoxasolepropionic acid receptor;
  CaMK2α, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha; mTOR, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin.'
