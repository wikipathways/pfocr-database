caption: Routes towards clearance or persistence of senescence in vivo. Senescent
  cells can be generated in response to multiple physiological and pathological stimuli.
  The canonical pathway involves the onset of acute senescence—a state associated
  with leukocyte recruitment and clearance of senescence—as seen in development and
  wound healing in vivo. With advancing age and in response to other stimuli there
  is often incomplete clearance of senescent cells, which undergo further phenotypic
  alterations, upregulate SASP release, nuclear remodeling, and alter the expression
  of multiple genes including Lamin B1 and β-gal. These chronically senescent cells
  appear resistant to apoptosis and phagocytosis, and are believed to mediate organ
  dysfunction and fibrosis via their secretory phenotype. Whether these altered outcomes
  reflect altered initial stimuli, the cell type, the age of the subject, or other
  unknown factors remain incompletely understood.
