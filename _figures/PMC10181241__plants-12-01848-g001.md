caption: Transcription factors and chelators facilitate the entry of Cd into the plant.
  Upon Cd entry into the root cell cytosol, the cell activates defense mechanisms.
  Cd is partly removed by binding to PCs and transported to the vacuole by ABC transporters.
  HMAs are also involved in the transfer of Cd to vacuoles, as well as to the xylem
  and subsequently to other parts of the plant. In hyperaccumulators, this transfer
  to aerial parts takes place. These plants can detoxify or sequester Cd in their
  leaves. When exposed to Cd, the ROS signalling pathway is activated, involving MAPKs.
  This pathway, along with Ca-calmodulin, affects the expression of ERFs, MYB, WRKY,
  and other transcription factor genes. Cd impacts several genes within the cell,
  although the precise effects are not yet fully comprehended. Plant hormones, such
  as IAA, also affect gene expression.
