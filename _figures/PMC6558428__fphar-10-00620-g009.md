caption: The protective mechanism of MLB against hepatic I/R. The Jak2/Stat3 signaling
  pathway was activated when excessive proinflammation mediators were secreted, and
  then the inflammatory cytokines were further expressed. MLB could inhibit the activation
  of the Jak2/Stat3 signaling pathway and decrease the pro-inflammatory cytokines
  to reduce the hepatic I/R injury.
