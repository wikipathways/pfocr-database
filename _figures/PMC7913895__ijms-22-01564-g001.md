caption: Maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and the ATPase cycle of
  BiP. Nascent secretory pathway proteins enter the ER in an unfolded state and immediately
  encounter the ER-resident molecular chaperones, such as the heat shock protein chaperones,
  BiP, GRP94, and GRP170, as well as the lectin chaperones, Calnexin and Calreticulin.
  Both of these chaperone families and their associated machineries together ensure
  that the nascent proteins fold correctly, upon which they can continue their journey
  along the secretory pathway to their final destination. However, proteins can fail
  to mature properly. These aberrant proteins are recognized by the same molecular
  chaperones and retrotranslocated to the cytosol for degradation by the 26S proteasome
  in a process called ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Aberrantly folded proteins
  can also be cleared by the autophagy–lysosomal system. (Inset) BiP depends on ATP-induced
  conformational changes to participate in multiple ER functions. BiP’s ATPase cycle
  is regulated by two families of co-chaperones, ER-localized DnaJ-like proteins (ERdjs)
  and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). ERdjs enable BiP to associate with its client
  proteins stably. However, proteins must be released from BiP in order to fold, a
  process mediated by NEFs, such as SIL1 and GRP170. The released clients can then
  fold, undergo protein maturation, and traverse the secretory pathway. Created with
