caption: The origin of PCP in early tubules is unknown, however, several molecules
  may potentially act as cues to initiate PCP in early nephrogenic structures. E.g.
  Wnt11 that expresses at the UB tip directs polarized NPC behaviors as they epithelize
  and transform into pre-tubular aggregates and renal vesicles. The link between apical-basal
  and PCP networks may coordinate establishment of planar polarization in the earliest
  structures. In the trunk, Wnt9b or Wnt7b may act locally in the UB trunk or non-autonomously
  on the cells adjacent to developing tubule to stabilize polarity of proliferating
  UB cells. Additionally, mechanical forces within the cells and/or from the ECM may
  provide polarity cues as comma- and S-shaped bodies undergo significant stretching
  and invagination. Onset of urine formation at E15.0 in the mouse nephron may provide
  further cues via ciliary mechanosensation to stabilize planar polarization along
  the growing tubule.
