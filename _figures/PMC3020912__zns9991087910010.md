caption: Schematic presentation of the summary of our work. Fibrillar Aβ alone is
  capable of activating the N-SMase–ceramide pathway in neurons, which leads to apoptosis
  and cell death (,). In astroglia, fibrillar Aβ-mediated activation of the N-SMase–ceramide
  pathway is responsible for the activation of NF-κB and the expression of different
  proinflammatory soluble mediators including NO. Once NO is produced, it can induce
  the expression of GFAP in astrocytes leading to astrogliosis. On the other hand,
  these glial-derived soluble mediators (e.g., NO) also induce neuronal apoptosis
  via the N-SMase–ceramide pathway. It appears that multiple neurotoxic signaling
  pathways converge on N-SMase. SM, Sphingomyelin.
