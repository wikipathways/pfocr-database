caption: Overview of autophagy. Cellular stresses, including reactive oxygen or reactive
  nitrogen species (ROS, RNS), or nutritional/energetic stress activate AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to signal
  autophagy through Atg1. Once initiated, Beclin-1 and VPS34, a class I phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase, trigger downstream events leading to activation of the first of two ubiquitin-like
  pathways. First, Atg12 is activated similarly to ubiquitin by Atg7, an E1-like enzyme,
  which then transfers it to Atg10, an E2-like enzyme, which then conjugates it to
  lysine 130 of Atg5. The Atg5/Atg12 conjugate then complexes with a homodimer of
  Atg16, and the complex assembles on a membrane structure termed the phagophore.
  This event is a prerequisite for the second ubiquitin-like pathway, which involves
  the cleavage of the terminal Cys residue of Atg8 (LC3) by Atg4, a cysteine protease,
  which exposes a terminal glycine residue. Atg4 is redox regulated and appears to
  upregulate autophagy in the face of oxidative stress. Atg4 in conjunction with Atg7
  facilitates conjugation of LC3 onto phosphatidylethanolamine in the lipid bilayer
  of the membrane. The cup-shaped phagophore is recruited to engulf targets via adaptor
  proteins such as p62, which binds ubiquitinated protein aggregates and LC3. The
  growing ends of the phagophore eventually meet and fuse to enclose the target within
  the double-membrane structure of the autophagosome. At this point Atg12/5/16L are
  released, and the autophagosome fuses with a lysosome; fusion and degradation of
  contents requires acidification, which is mediated by the vacuolar proton ATPase
  (VPATPase); lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsins, and lipases have pH optima well
  below 6.0. The entire process of formation and destruction occurs on a time-scale
  of minutes. PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate.
