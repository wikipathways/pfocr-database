caption: Model for the integration of the DUOX2 system into the intestinal epithelial
  defense response. (A) Epithelial contacting microbes (e.g., SFB) induce DUOX2 by
  an IL-22-independent pathway at homeostasis. DUOX2 activity triggers an anti-oxidative
  response (kat) in mucosa-adherent SFB but does not prevent their colonization. (B)
  Lack of DUOX2 activity leads to increased uptake of bacterial material (e.g., SFB,
  Proteobacteria). Expression of compensatory host defense systems resulting in a
  proinflammatory milieu. (C) Lack of IL-22 dependent mucosal defense leads to mucosal
  dysbiosis and compensatory induction of DUOX2. (D) In IBD-associated mucosal dysbiosis,
  increased epithelial contact with and uptake of indigenous pathobionts triggers
  a compensatory DUOX2 response before the onset of clinical inflammation. Sensing
  of bacterial factors by antigen-presenting cells (APC) activates the IL-23/IL-22
  cascade for secretion of antimicrobial effectors and further enhancement of DUOX2
  expression.
