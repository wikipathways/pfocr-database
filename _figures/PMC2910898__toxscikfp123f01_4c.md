caption: 'During normoxia, HIF-1α is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. However, under hypoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylase activity is attenuated,
  which decreases the proteasomal degradation of intracellular HIF-1α. The accumulated
  HIF-1α heterodimerizes with HIF-1β and translocates into the nucleus. The HIF-1
  complex binds to DNA regulatory sequences known as HREs, which are present in the
  promoter or enhancer regions of HIF-1 target genes. After recruiting transcriptional
  coactivators, such as p300 and CBP, the expression of target genes including VEGF,
  EPO, and LDH-A, are initiated. Abbreviations: ARNT = aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear
  translocator; EPO = erythropoietin; LDH = lactate dehydrogenase.'
