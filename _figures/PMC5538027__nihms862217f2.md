caption: 'LTA derived from the commensal microbiome on the skin surface increases
  the expression of cathelicidins in MC granules via induction of Cnlp. TLR2 mediates
  this LTA-Cnlp response. VV challenge to MCs can also induce weak Cnlp expression
  in MCs, but this pathway is not mediated by TLR2. When VV enter MCs by membrane
  fusion, this event induces S1P formation and S1PR2 activation, leading to MC degranulation.
  Cnlp: cathelicidin-like protein, LTA: lipoteichoic acid, S1P: sphingosine-1-phosphate,
  S1PR2: S1P receptor 2, TLR: Tolllike receptor'
