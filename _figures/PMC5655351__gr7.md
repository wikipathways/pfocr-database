caption: Examples of metabolic engineering for improved precursor pools. A) Overexpression
  of PCC for the conversion of propionyl-CoA to (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA allowed for
  the production of 6-deoxyerythronolide B in bacteria that don't natively produce
  methylmalonyl-CoA (such as E. coli). B) Expression of the methoxymalonyl-ACP biosynthetic
  pathway in a platenolide producer generated a platenolide analog containing the
  methoxy moiety. C) Higher titers of mithramycin were achieved by increasing the
  precursor supply of malonyl-CoA and glucose-1-phosphate. Green boxes denote upregulated
  pathways and red cross marks denote downregulation or knockout pathways. D) Post-translational
  modification of apo-ACPs by PPTases generated active holo-ACPs which can activate
  FAS biosynthetic pathways in primary metabolism or PKS pathways in secondary metabolism.
