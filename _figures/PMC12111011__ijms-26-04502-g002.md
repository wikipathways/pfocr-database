caption: A current model of ubiquitin-dependent plant protein degradation. After being
  ubiquitinated by E3 ligases, proteins undergo different fates depending on the type
  of ubiquitin chains formed. Proteins forming K48 chains are degraded by the proteasome.
  Proteins forming K63 chains are degraded by the vacuole through two different pathways.
  Membrane proteins undergo endocytosis, forming vesicles that are transported in
  the cytoplasm, eventually entering the vacuole. Non-membrane proteins form autophagosomes
  and are transported into the vacuole
