caption: Mechanisms of released mtDNA activation of inflammation. MtDNA can be released
  as circular molecules or DNA fragments when mitochondria are damaged or stressed.
  MtDNA release can be mediated through the mPTP, the MOMP, and the apoptosis-associated
  protein BAX/BAK. The released mtDNA is involved in the inflammatory response through
  a variety of signaling pathways. MtDNA binds to NLRP3, activating the NLRP3 inflammasomes,
  which induces caspase-1 activation, causing the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and participating in the inflammatory response. MtDNA binds to cGAS to
  form cGMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates STING, and the activated STING recruits and
  activates TBK1. This leads to IRF3, NF-KB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation,
  promoting increased expression of interferon and inflammatory genes. MtDNA binds
  to TLR9, promoting MyD88 pathway activation and participating in inflammatory cytokine
  transcription.
