caption: Working model of how the glucose dual-affinity transport system functions
  in glucose transport, signaling, and CCR. Under high levels of glucose, N. crassa
  predominantly uses the low-affinity, but high-capacity GLT-1 protein for nutrient
  assimilation. Adequate glucose stimulates CRE-1-mediated CCR to repress cellulase
  expression for non-preferred carbon (e.g., plant cell walls) utilization, whereas
  the cAMP-PKA pathway is induced for vegetative growth. When external glucose is
  depleted or limited, however, HGT-1/-2 are rapidly derepressed by the lifting of
  CCR and transport the limited external glucose. This process synergistically downregulates
  the cAMP-PKA pathway via one or more mechanisms to decrease cAMP levels and pkac-2
  expression, thus leading to attenuated glycolytic activity. Constant exposure of
  cells to glucose-limited conditions leads to sexual sporulation for survival, thereby
  also resulting in downregulation of clr-1/2 and cellulase expression, and reactivation
  of CCR on cellulose. Whether cAMP-PKA can regulate CRE-1 and/or CLR-1/-2 directly
  or through downstream transcriptional factors to function in plant cell wall deconstruction
  requires further investigation
