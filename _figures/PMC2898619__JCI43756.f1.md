caption: ERs are ligand-activated transcription factors that translocate to the nucleus
  upon estrogen binding and regulate gene expression. Classically, the hormone-bound
  receptor dimerizes and binds to specific DNA sequences called estrogen response
  elements (ERE), displacing corepressors (CoR) from the DNA, recruiting coactivator
  (CoA) proteins, and activating gene expression. ERs can also be transcriptionally
  activated via ligand-independent pathways in which growth factor receptor (GFR)
  activation leads to activation of specific kinases that directly phosphorylate the
  ER, again leading to altered gene expression, either directly by the ER or via ER
  interactions with other transcription factors (TFs). In the current issue of the
  JCI, Chambliss and colleagues demonstrate the in vivo importance of a long-recognized
  third signaling pathway mediated by non-nuclear ERs in ECs (). In this pathway,
  estrogen induces a subpopulation of cell membrane–associated ERs to form a signaling
  complex that results in rapid activation of specific kinases, which in turn phosphorylate
  and enzymatically activate eNOS.
