caption: A recently described signaling pathway links activated MK2 to RhoA through
  intermediates hsp27 and p115RhoGEF (63). Hsp27 phosphorylation by MK2 is an important
  ‘switch’ that allows local recruitment of p115RhoGEF to a signaling complex, promoting
  RhoA activity. We hypothesize that KapB mediated activation of this pathway contributes
  to several downstream effects of active RhoA.To address the importance of individual
  proteins within this signaling pathway in the mechanism of KapB-mediated RhoA activation,
  PB dispersion and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, we undertook several approaches
  to eliminate expression or activity of candidate proteins. These included the co-expression
  of dominant negative (DN) versions of RhoA and hsp27, co-expression of shRNAs designed
  to reduce expression of p115RhoGEF and MK2 using RNA interference, and chemical
  inhibitors that were specific for RhoA (C3) and its downstream effector kinase ROCK
  (Y-27632).
