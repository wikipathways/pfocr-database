caption: 'Artificial l-theanine biosynthetic pathways mediated by transaminase (TA)
  or alanine decarboxylase (AlaDC) in E. coli. l-Theanine is synthesized via the TA-utilizing
  pathway (orange and blue) or the AlaDC-utilizing pathway (green and blue). In the
  TA pathway, acetaldehyde is supplied by acetyl-CoA via EutE, and subsequently, PpTA
  catalyzes the transamination reaction that converts acetaldehyde to ethylamine.
  The amino donor l-alanine (Ala) is regenerated by Bacillus subtilis 168 alanine
  dehydrogenase (BsAld). In the AlaDC pathway, pyruvate is converted to Ala through
  the reaction catalyzed by BsAld, and Ala is decarboxylated to produce ethylamine
  via CsAlaDC. Finally, l-theanine is synthesized from ethylamine and l-glutamate
  (Glu) via γ-glutamylmethylamide synthetase (GMAS) in both pathways. Genes, their
  products, and their species of origin are as follows: eutE, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase,
  E. coli; PpTA, transaminase, Pseudomonas putida; BsAld, alanine dehydrogenase, Bacillus
  subtilis; CsAlaDC, alanine decarboxylase, Camelia sinensis; GMAS, γ-glutamylmethylamide
  synthetase; gdhA, glutamate dehydrogenase, E. coli; and gltA, citrate synthase,
  E. coli. TCA, tricarboxylic acid.'
