caption: Normally, as part of the down-regulation of the immune response, activated
  B and T lymphocytes up-regulate FAS and activated T lymphocytes up-regulate FAS-ligand.
  These interact and trigger the caspase cascade leading to proteolysis, DNA degradation,
  and apoptosis. This FAS-mediated pathway is part of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
  In contrast, mitochondrial-induced apoptosis after cellular stress is part of the
  intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Patients with ALPS have a defect in the FAS-apoptotic
  pathway, leading to abnormal lymphocyte survival. Courtesy of © Sue Seif.
