caption: In mammals, NAD+ can be generated from four precursors including tryptophan
  (Trp), nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NIC), and nicotinamide riboside (NR).
  The de novo pathway starts from Trp and is converged into the Preiss-Handler pathway
  through nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). In the Preiss-Handler pathway, nicotinic
  acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT1) produces NaMN from NA, and NAD+ is generated
  from NaMN via nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT)
  and NAD+ synthetase. In the salvage pathway, NIC is converted to nicotinamide mononucleotide
  (NMN) by the rate-limiting enzyme, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltranferase (NAMPT).
  Our recent data suggest that NMN is also found in our daily food (Yoshino and Imai,
  unpublished data). NAD+ is synthesized from NMN by NMNAT. NR is converted to NMN
  by nioctinamide riboside kinase (NRK) and utilized for NAD+ biosynthesis. NAD+ is
  consumed by various enzymes such as sirtuins, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs),
  and cyclic ADP ribose hydrose (CD38).
