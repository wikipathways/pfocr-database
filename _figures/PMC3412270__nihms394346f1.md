caption: The glutaminase II pathway. Glutamine transaminases catalyze a freely reversible
  transamination reaction between L-glutamine and a suitable α-keto acid substrate
  to generate the α-keto acid analogue of L-glutamine (α-ketoglutaramate; KGM) and
  an L-amino acid. Two glutamine transaminases have been described, namely glutamine
  transaminase K (GTK) and glutamine transaminase L (GTL). Both glutamine transaminases
  have a broad specificity toward α-keto acids. However, an especially prominent α-keto
  acid substrate for both enzymes is α-keto-γ-methiolbutyrate, an important component
  of the methionine salvage pathway [, , ]. Note that although the glutamine transaminase
  reaction is freely reversible, the reaction is drawn in the direction of glutamine
  utilization by the cyclization of the product KGM to a lactam (2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline)
  and by hydrolysis of KGM to α-ketoglutarate. Under physiological conditions ~99.7%
  of KGM is in the cyclized (lactam) form and only 0.3% is in the open-chain form
  (i.e., the substrate form of ω-amidase) []. Modified from []

  is markedly increased in urea cycle disorders.
