caption: A schematic representation which shows possible mechanisms of action by δ-
  and γ-tocopherol in multiple signaling pathways involved in mammary carcinogenesis.
  Induction of PPARγ by δ- and γ-tocopherol may increase PTEN and p21 and reduce ERα
  and cyclin D1 resulting in the decrease of inflammation and cell proliferation.
  The cell cycle (p53 and p21) may be regulated by δ- and γ-tocopherol. Tumor suppressor
  p53 is able to positively regulate PTEN, p21 and BAX, while inhibiting Bcl2 and
  cyclin D, which increases apoptosis and reduces cell cycle progression. PPARγ and
  p53 increase the levels of PTEN, and as a result inhibit the Akt cell survival pathway.
  δ- And γ-tocopherols reduce c-Myc and PCNA which consequently decrease cell progression
  and proliferation. Pro-apoptotic proteins BAX, c-Casp9, c-Casp3 and c-PARP are increased
  while anti-apoptotic proteins XIAP and Bcl2 are decreased by δ- and γ-tocopherol.
  In summary, δ- and γ-tocopherol may activate PPARγ, PTEN, p53, the apoptotic pathway
  and Nrf2 and decrease ERα, p-Akt, cyclin D1 and PCNA to inhibit cell cycle progression
  and cell growth resulting in the inhibition of mammary tumorigenesis.
