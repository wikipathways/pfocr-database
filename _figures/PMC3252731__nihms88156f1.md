caption: The TLR4 signaling pathway is highly regulated. A. Following LPS binding,
  TLR4 signals through two main adaptor molecules, MyD88 and TRIF. In the MyD88 dependent
  pathway, IRAK1 and IRAK4 are phosphorylated, then dissociate from the complex and
  activate TRAF6. TRAF6 activates the MAP kinases ERK, JNK, and p38, as well as the
  IKK complex. IKK phosphorylates IκBα, leading to its degradation, releasing NFκB
  to enter the nucleus and activate gene transcription. In the TRIF dependent pathway,
  TBK-1 phosphorylates IRF3, which then dimerizes and enters the nucleus to transcribe
  Type 1 IFN-inducible genes. TRIF signaling also leads to a delayed NFκB response.
  B. TLR4 induces multiple negative regulators. A20 deubiquitinates and deactivates
  TRAF6. IRAKM may inhibit dissociation of IRAK1 from the receptor complex. SIGRR
  and ST2 are inhibitory cell-surface receptors. SOCS1 inhibits IFNR signaling, SHIP
  antagonizes PI3K, and MyD88s is a non-functional splice variant of MyD88. An unknown
  regulator likely inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation. IL-10, TGFβ, and cholinergic stimulation
  also inhibit induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Schematic adapted with permission
