caption: Overview of STAT3 activation. Receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and
  VEGFR have intrinsic kinase abilities and can directly phosphorylate STAT3 following
  ligand binding. Receptor independent tyrosine kinases such as c-SRC can also phosphorylate
  JAK. For receptors that lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, such as the IL6R/GP130
  complex, STAT3 activation is initiated upon ligand-receptor interactions (1). Activated
  JAKs phosphorylate the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor subunit, which serves as
  a docking site for STAT3 (2). STAT3 is then phosphorylated by JAK, dissociates from
  the receptor, and forms homodimers that translocate into the nucleus to mediate
  gene transcription by binding to the TTC(n)3GAA promoter sequence (3). In the alternative
  trans-signaling pathway, IL6 binds to a soluble IL6 receptor, which then associates
  with GP130 to initiate downstream STAT3 signaling as per the classical pathway.
