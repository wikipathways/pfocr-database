caption: 'One-carbon metabolism. FA, arising from fortified foods or nutritional supplements,
  is reduced to DHF and THF by dihydrofolate reductase. Serine hydroxymethyl-transferase
  transfers one-carbon units from serine to THF, with PLP as a coenzyme, forming 5,10-methylene-THF.
  This is either used for the synthesis of thymidylate or reduced to 5-methyl-THF.
  Dietary folates can enter one-carbon metabolism as 5-methyl-THF. The methyl group
  of 5-methyl-THF is transferred to homocysteine in a reaction catalyzed by MTR and
  utilizing B12 as a cofactor, generating methionine and THF. Alternatively, in the
  liver, betaine can donate a methyl group for the remethylation of homocysteine in
  a reaction catalyzed by BHMT. Methionine adenosyltransferase enzymes activate methionine
  to form SAM—the methyl donor for numerous acceptors, including arsenicals, GAA (the
  precursor to creatine), and DNA—in reactions that involve substrate-specific methyltransferase
  enzymes. These methylation reactions generate the methylated products and SAH, a
  potent product inhibitor of most methyltransferases. SAH is hydrolyzed to generate
  homocysteine, which is either remethylated to regenerate methionine or directed
  to the transsulfuration pathway and ultimately glutathionine synthesis. Abbreviations:
  AS3MT, arsenic-3-methyltransferase; BHMT, betaine homocysteine methyltransferase;
  DHF, dihydrofolate; DMAsV, dimethylarsinic acid; DNMT, DNA methyltransferases; FA,
