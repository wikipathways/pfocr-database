caption: The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in LM and potential therapeutics. EphB4
  and NRAS mutations activate the RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. NRAS gene mutation
  in lymphatic endothelial cells of GLA and KLA has been discovered, MAPK inhibitors
  (U0126) require clinical trials to explore their potential in the treatment of LM.
  The somatic cell activation mutation of NRAS in lymphatic endothelium can increase
  phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in lymphatic endothelial cells of GLA. Recently,
  a new drug, trametinib, blocking the enhanced phosphorylation of ERK and reducing
  the viability of the endothelial cells, maybe a promising choice for the treatment
  of GLA. CCLA, is connected with the mutation in EPHB4 following the autosomal dominant
  inheritance. The inhibitors against RAS, MAPK, and EPHB4 may provide a new therapeutic
  target for the treatment of LM.
