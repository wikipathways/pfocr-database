caption: The current model describing Tor pathway regulation of Gln3  dephosphorylation,
  localization, and activation of NCR-sensitive  transcription. The model incorporates
  conclusions drawn from multiple  laboratories (,  ,  ,  -).  Green lines and arrows
  indicate positive regulation, whereas  red lines and bars indicate negative regulation.  Red
  and green letters indicate inactive and active forms of  the proteins, respectively.
  Dashed lines indicate weak regulatory  relationships. Pph21/22 indicates Pph21 or
  Pph22. The model is  neither exhaustive, for example the Tip41 protein  () is not
  described, nor  does it present all contending views of some steps, for example
  those reported  by Beck and Hall ()  versus Carvalho et al.  () or Jacinto et  al.
  () versus  Jiang and Broach ().
