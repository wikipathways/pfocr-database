caption: 'Solar irradiation inflict both electrophilicity and nucleophilicity in the
  cytosol. The two opposing characteristics of radicals were sensed by two distinct
  domains of TRPA1(A). Electrophilicity is often neutralized by the cytosolic reducing
  power, but nucleophilicity is not interfered with. C and R in the circles respectively
  represent cysteine and arginine critical for each activation pathway. Chevrons depict
  amphiphilicity of free radicals with two opposing ends.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18425.025'
