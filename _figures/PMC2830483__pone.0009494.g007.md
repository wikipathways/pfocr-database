caption: In the canonical DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway in C. elegans, DAF-2
  regulates DAF-16 through the activation of PI3K, composed of AGE-1 and AAP-1 for
  the catalytic subunit and the regulatory subunit respectively. PI3K activates the
  activity of PDK-1, which eventually inhibits the nuclear translocation and transcriptional
  activity of DAF-16. Here we demonstrate that the attenuated DAF-2 signal can also
  regulate an additional DAF-16-independent signal arm that diverges form PDK-1 to
  WWP-1 to defense against Cry5B PFT.
