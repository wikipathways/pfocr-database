caption: The Flowchart describes renoprotective effect of the recombinant anti-IL-6R
  fusion proteins (VHH-0031) by inhibiting IL6R/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in diabetic
  nephropathy. The red of the flowchart is express that the high glucose induces kidney
  injury and upregulates IL6R/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. After treated by anti-IL-6R
  fusion proteins (VHH-0031) downregulates IL6R/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The
  above improvement results are reflected in green.
