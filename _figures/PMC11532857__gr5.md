caption: Role of miRNAs in metastasis of HCC. . 1. To create metastasis, first, cancer
  cells are separated from the tissue mass with the origin of cancer by ADAM proteins,
  a family of secretory and membrane metalloproteinases, and SRPK1, which is a splicing
  factor of SRSF protein kinase 1. They cause the movement and migration of cells
  removed from tumor tissue in the tumor microenvironment of blood vessels 2. Tumor
  cells pass through the vessels reach the surrounding healthy tissues and create
  the characteristics of cancer cells in healthy tissues. 3. Metastasis occurs in
  distant and nearby tissues.Up-regulation of miR-1296 inhibits hypoxia-promoting
  effects on metastasis and EMT of HCC cells by targeting SRPK1 gene expression and
  inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation. Also, Mir-655 inhibits metastasis
  in HCC cells by directly targeting ADAM10 inhibiting the β-catenin pathway, and
  downregulating E-cadherin protein expression
