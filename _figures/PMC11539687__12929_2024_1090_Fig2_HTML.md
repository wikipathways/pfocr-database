caption: This figure illustrates the neuroprotective mechanisms of GLP-1 receptor
  agonists (GLP-1RAs) in neurons and microglia, highlighting the key molecular pathways
  involved in neurodegeneration and inflammation. In neurons, the binding of GLP-1
  to its receptor (GLP-1R) activates the cyclic AMP (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA)
  signaling pathway, which in turn activates PI3K/Akt signaling. This activation leads
  to the downstream phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK-3β, reducing tau phosphorylation—a
  critical event in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally,
  Akt activation promotes mitochondrial biogenesis by upregulating transcription factors
  such as Tfam, PGC-1α, and NRF-1, leading to enhanced energy production and reduced
  oxidative stress. The Akt/CREB pathway also activates Bcl-2 family proteins, inhibiting
  apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c release. Overall, these signaling events protect
  neurons from oxidative stress and apoptosis, which are central to neurodegeneration.
  In microglia, GLP-1R activation via PI3K/Akt signaling also reduces neuroinflammation
  by modulating NF-κB activity. This pathway decreases the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and NLRP3, and increases anti-inflammatory markers
  such as IL-10, IL-4, arginase, and CD206. This shift in cytokine balance promotes
  the transformation of microglia into an anti-inflammatory state, which is neuroprotective,
  reducing overall inflammation and damage in the brain. The figure highlights the
  dual role of GLP-1RAs in reducing neurodegeneration by improving neuronal survival
  and modulating microglial activity, providing a potential therapeutic approach for
  neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD. AGE advanced glycation end products,
