caption: The pathway of protein synthesis and degradation in the cell. (A) Nascent
  polypeptide chain is converted into its native folded protein with the help of molecular
  chaperones. (B) Nascent polypeptide chain with a mutation (blue ball) folds into
  its native-like protein (or partial unfolded protein). (C) Mutant (or partial unfolded)
  protein may be re-recognized as imperfect proteins, leading to ubiquitination by
  E1 (ubiquitin activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin
  ligase). (D) Misfolded protein enters into the proteasome system with the help of
  the ubiquitin complex. (E) Misfolded protein is degraded into small peptide by proteasome
  and ubiquitin is regenerated. (F) Impaired proteasome system could not degrade the
  misfolded protein. (G) Native protein molecule is converted into misfolded structure,
  which is caused by destabilization of the α-helical structure and the simultaneous
  formation of the β-sheet structure. (H) Mutations accelerate protein misfolding.
  (I) Molecular chaperones facilitate to direct the misfolded proteins to the proteasomal
  pathway. (J) Misfolded monomers aggregate into dimer as initial building blocks
  for the formation of amyloid fibrils. (K) These building blocks further polymerize
  to form oligomers. (L) Molecular chaperones disaggregate the compact aggregates
  and develop native folded monomer. (M) Oligomers further form photofibrils. (N)
  Amyloid hypothesis. (O) Channel hypothesis.
