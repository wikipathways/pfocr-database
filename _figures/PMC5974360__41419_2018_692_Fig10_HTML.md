caption: In the process of pulmonary fibrosis, TGF-β1 could activate Hedgehog pathway
  via inducing Gli1 translocate to nucleus, which promotes the transcription and translation
  of Wnt7b and Wnt10a through binding with their promoter areas. Furthermore, Wnt7b
  and Wnt10a can directly bind with Fzd10 receptor and induce the activation of Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling, leading to myofibroblast differentiation and pulmonary fibrosis. Oppositely,
  inhibition of Gli1 or knockdown Fzd10 can suppress myofibroblast differentiation
  and pulmonary fibrosis
