caption: In the healthy uninjured vasculature (left), vascular endothelial growth
  factor type 1 receptors (VEGFR1) are expressed exclusively on endothelial cell (EC)
  and not on smooth muscle cells (SMC). Aldosterone activation of SMC mineralocorticoid
  receptors (MR) in this setting modestly enhances placental growth factor (PlGF)
  transcription and local release that can act only on EC expressing VEGFR1. Thus
  in healthy vessels, aldosterone does not disrupt the quiescent SMC phenotype and
  vessels do not undergo adverse remodeling even when aldosterone levels are high.
  In the setting of vascular injury or disease (right), SMC-MR contributes to local
  upregulation of VEGFR1 expression on SMC and aldosterone activation of SMC-MR contributes
  to substantial PlGF expression and release. PlGF mediates aldosterone-enhanced SMC
  proliferation and vascular fibrosis after injury by binding to VEGFR1 receptors
  on SMC. This model provides insight into how aldosterone acts synergistically with
  endothelial injury to contribute to adverse vascular remodeling and how MR antagonists
  prevent adverse cardiovascular events in clinical trials.
