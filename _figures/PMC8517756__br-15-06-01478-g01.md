caption: SARS-Cov-2 binds to ACE2 in order to enter the cell. Subsequent activation
  of the RAAS pathway induces endothelial dysfunction, which will lead to the generation
  of ROS and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α), resulting
  in a cytokine storm as well as hypercoagulation and a rise in thrombotic events
  culminating in an increase in the severity of the disease. ACE, angiotensin converting
  enzyme; RAAS, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  IL, interleukin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; Ang, angiotensin.
