caption: 'Although a myriad of intracellular signaling is involved in passive therapies,
  their pathways show some overlap. In this figure, the checkpoint receptors PD-1
  and CTLA4 are both shown to activate SHP2 leading to inhibition of microcluster
  signaling molecules, indirectly opposing the actions of activated stimulatory receptor
  CD28; checkpoint blockade prevents T-cell inhibition in this regard. Small molecule
  targets such as CXCR5, CCR5, and TKR are all also shown to converge with the checkpoint
  inhibitor MOA at the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, some through inhibition or some
  through activation depending on whether these effects are seen in Treg or Teff.
  Intermediaries such as JNK and Ras are seen with CCR5 and TKR, respectively. Downstream
  of all pathways is the activation or inhibition of caspase-mediated apoptosis. Abbreviations:
  CCR5, C-C chemokine receptor type 5; CTLA4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein
  4; CXCR4, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; mTOR, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases;
  PP2A, protein phosphatase 2a; TKR, tyrosine kinase receptor. Some elements adapted
