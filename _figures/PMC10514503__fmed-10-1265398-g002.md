caption: S1P maintains the intestinal intraepithelial EC barrier. S1P binds to five
  receptors and transmits different intracellular signals depending on the G protein-coupled
  G subunit and the expression pattern of each receptor in the cell type. S1PR1 is
  mainly coupled to G αi/o and promotes vascular stability via cytoskeleton rearrangement
  adherens junctions, and limits plasma and leukocyte extravasation; S1PR2 and S1PR3
  are involved in G αi/o, G αq and G α12/13 pathways, S1PR4 connects G αi/o and G
  α12/13 pathways, interacts with Rho, leading to a diverse network of signals. S1PR2-4
  can cause the contraction of vascular ECs, increase vascular permeability, and weaken
  endothelial barrier function. S1PR5 is mainly expressed in astrocytes and enhances
  the blood-brain barrier.
