caption: Complement C3 derived from human hepatic cell sheets activates NF-κB via
  complement C5 resulted in nuclear translocation of NF-κB of hepatocytes. Thioredoxin
  also activates NF-κB through deoxidizing NF-κB, by which in turn thioredoxin is
  oxidized. Thioredoxin is involved in redox system accompanied by thioredoxin reductase
  and peroxiredoxin. Nuclear localized NF-κB upregulates transcriptional activity
  of IL-6, resulting in activation of IL6/STAT3 pathway and allowing hepatocytes to
  enter cell cycle. Activation of EGFR pathway is also involved in promoting cell
  growth.
