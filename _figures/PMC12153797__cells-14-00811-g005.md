caption: A visual representation detailing the pathways that play a role in bile acid
  synthesis and metabolic processes. Intestinal bacteria in the ileum catalyze the
  deconjugation of bile acids (BAs), converting them into secondary bile acids such
  as DCA and lithocholic acid (LCA). Most unconjugated bile acids undergo reabsorption
  in the colon. They are directed to the liver through the portal vein, allowing them
  to contribute to another digestive cycle called enterohepatic circulation. Heparin-binding
  epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) triggers the transactivation of the epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR) after being released from pro-HB-EGF by matrix metalloproteinase-7
  (MMP-7). The activation and expression of MMP-7 are also consequences of M3R activation,
  creating a ‘feed-forward’ effect. The signaling process continues downstream through
  the ERK1/2 and PI3K pathways, causing gene expression shifts that promote cancer
  advancement. This figure was generated using BioRender software version 04
