caption: 'The structure, source, and catabolism of myo-inositol. Intracellular myo-inositol
  is derived in three different ways: de novo synthesis, H+/myo-inositol transporter
  (HMIT)/Na+/myo-inositol transporter 1/2 (SMIT1/2)-mediated absorption, and dephosphorylation
  of inositol phosphates. De novo synthesis of myo-inositol from glucose is catalyzed
  by hexokinase, 1-d-myo-inositolphosphate synthase (MIPS), and inositol monophosphatase
  (IMPase) sequentially. Myo-inositol is catabolized by myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX),
  a renal proximal tubule-specific enzyme, to generate d-glucuronic acid, which is
  further converted into xylitol via the glucuronate-xylulose (G-X) pathway. Xylitol
  is catabolized into d-xylulose-5-phosphate, which is involved in the pentose phosphate
  cycle. ALR1, aldehyde reductase; DGDC, dehydro-l-gulonate decarboxylase; DXR, d-xylulose
  reductase; GDH, l-gulonate dedydrogenase; LXR, l-xylulose reductase. [Partially
