caption: Stimulation of a particular TLR by DAMPs and activation of the IL-1 pathway
  via stimulation of IL-1R. This results in activation of NF- κB, and leads to synthesis
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines released into the periprosthetic environment. IL-1α
  and IL-1β are synthesized as precursor proteins available for their biological action
  after enzymatic modification. This schema is an example of how the translation of
  an initial signal (either bacterial, tissue or wear debris origin) into protein
  synthesis could occur (redrawn according to O’Shea et al., 2019 []). DAMP, danger-associated
  molecular pattern; IκB, inhibitor of κ B; IKK, IκB kinase; IL-1R, interleukin-1
  receptor; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; TLR, toll-like receptor; TRAF6, tumor
  necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6.
