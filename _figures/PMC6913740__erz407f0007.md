caption: 'Schematic diagram of the carbohydrate metabolic pathway in ‘outer tissues'',
  endosperm, and embryo of a barley grain and the differential transcript expression
  of involved genes in 18-6 transgenic grain from 7 to 24 DAP. Expression of HvCslF6
  transcripts includes the transgene and wild-type (WT) gene expression. For each
  tissue, the transcript expression values are normalized against the WT, calculated
  as log2, and represented in a heat map. Genes where the maximum transcript value
  was <2000 arbitrary units were not included in the heat map. Vertical dashed lines
  separate the three grain tissues. UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) and ADP-glucose (ADP-Glc)
  are substrates for the biosynthesis of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan and starch, respectively.
  INV* indicates the HORVU6Hr1G011260 gene. INV** indicates the HORVU2Hr1G109120 gene,
  which are both involved in the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds between the carbohydrates,
  including fructans. Abbreviations: fructose (Fru), fructose-6-phosphate (Fru-6-P),
  glucose (Glc), sucrose (Suc), sucrose-6-phosphate (Suc-6-P). Expanded gene names
  and accession information is included in Supplementary. Magenta indicates increased
  expression, while green indicates decreased expression.'
