  p-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: quinate shikimate p-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; C3H, p-coumarate
  3-hydroxylase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; COMT: caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase;
  CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; DPO, dirigent
  protein oxidase; PLR, pinoresinol–lariciresinol reductase; SLD, secoisolariciresinol
  dehydrogenase; DOP7H, deoxypodophyllotoxin 7-hydroxylase.'
