caption: Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by inhibition of pyruvate transfer to mitochondria.
  The activity of the PDH complex is blocked by PDK enzymes. PDK1 can phosphorylate
  all three sites—S1, S2, and S3 (Ser-264, Ser-271, and Ser-203, respectively) whereas
  PDK2, PDK3, and PDK4 each phosphorylate only the sites S1 and S2. After phosphorylation,
  mitochondrial energy production depends only on fatty acids. Both isoenzymes of
  pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP1 and PDP2) can reactivate phosphorylated
  PDH enzymes []. Mitochondrial dysfunction transforms chemical changes into biophysical
  pathological processes along the transformation pathway to cancer.
