caption: Models of the Signaling Pathways of the Phototropic Response in Hypocotyls
  of Arabidopsis Seedlings.The pathway marked by an asterisk indicates the inhibitory
  effect of NPH1 to the RPT2-independent pathway by adaptation or unknown mechanisms
  at high fluence rates. See the text for more details.
