caption: Differential expression of genes associated with key metabolic pathways.
  Differential expression of C. albicans transcripts in FCS vs Serum was performed
  between LBF and HBF at 4h and 24h. Those genes that were differentially expressed
  and that also belonged to a metabolic pathway. These pathways were determined to
  be significant by PAPi analysis based upon differences in activity score between
  our sample groups according to FDR corrected ANOVA. Pathways filtered first on significance
  within the PAPi analysis then pathways with significantly DE genes from at least
  one condition are displayed. This left genes involved in pathways that had a log2
  fold change RPMI compared to serum for each strain at both 4 and 24h are represented
  within the heatmaps within each pathway shown.
