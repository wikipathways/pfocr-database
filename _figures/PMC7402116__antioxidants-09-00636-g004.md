caption: 'The porphyrin synthesis pathway in relation to COVID-19. The porphyrin synthesis
  pathway displaying COVID-19 binding the end product, hemoprotein, which binds non-enzymatically
  to porphyrin causing upregulation of heme production as a result of negative feedback
  due to a decrease in functional hemoprotein. This leads to increased free heme,
  decreased functional hemoprotein, and the release of toxic iron, resulting in tissue
  injury. Key: CoA = coenzyme A, ALA = delta-aminolevulinic acid, and HMB = hydroxymethylbilane.'
