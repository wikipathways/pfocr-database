caption: 'Tumors up-regulate detoxification enzymes like GSTs, which play a vital
  role in buffering the toxic effects of oxidative-stress by catalyzing the glutathione-conjugation
  of the products of lipid peroxidation like 4-HNE in the initial step of mercapturic
  acid pathway (MAP). The anticancer compound COH-SR4 inhibits the GST activity resulting
  in decreased metabolic flux. This results in increased intracellular concentration
  of toxic products of lipid peroxidation. The efflux of glutathione-conjugates by
  RLIP76 is essential for the clathrin-dependent ligand-receptor endocytosis (CDE)
  and downstream activation of signaling cascades []. AMPK forms a critical node of
  transducing oxidant and energy deficiency signals in tumors. Also, the presence
  of oncogenes like KRAS G12V in lung cancers and suppression of energy sensor proteins
  like AMPK in spite of high AMP and low ATP levels as seen in tumors, in contrast
  to normal cells where AMPK is activated when AMP levels are high, together enhance
  the rate of proliferation and survival of lung cancer cells. Hence, the ability
  of COH-SR4 to regulate the critical nodes of lung cancer signaling downstream of
  oxidative-stress and CDE like levels of pACC, pTSC2, raptor, mTOR, p70S6K along
  with regulating the expression of fibronectin, vimentin, E-cadherin and Ki67, represents
  a promising spectrum of causes for the anti-cancer effects of COH-SR4. Green arrow:
