caption: In the hippocampus, the regulation of NMDARs by Gαs coupled receptors involves
  multiple mechanisms. (a) Dopamine D1 receptors and NMDAR can communicate through
  direct physical interactions, which inhibits NMDAR activity; (b) in addition, dopamine
  D1 receptor activation can enhance NMDAR mediated currents through a PKA dependent
  signalling pathway.
