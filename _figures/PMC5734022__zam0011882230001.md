caption: 'The canonical pathway of assembly of the heterocyclic rings of biotin (A)
  and the B. subtilis enzymes of pimeloyl-thioester synthesis (B and C). Note that
  although the BioW reaction is well characterized (, ), the BioI cleavage of long-chain
  acyl-ACP substrates has not been shown to be catalytic in vitro (). Abbreviations:
  AON, 8-amino-7-oxononanoate; DAN, 2,8-amino-7-oxononanoate; SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine;
  AMTOD, S-adenosyl-2-oxo-4-thiomethylbutyrate; 5′-DOA, 5′-deoxyadenosine. In the
  literature 2,8-amino-7-oxononanoate is often informally called 7,8-diaminopelargonic
  acid (DAPA) and AON is often informally called KAPA.'
