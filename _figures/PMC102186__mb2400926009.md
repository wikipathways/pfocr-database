caption: Schematic diagrams of the downregulated and activated status of the downstream
  members of the Ras-mediated signaling pathways in the transfectants compared to
  those of the parental HT1080 and MCH603c8 cells. The down and up arrows indicate
  downregulation and activation of kinase activity, respectively, of those proteins
  that has occurred as a consequence of expression of transfected DN (HT1080-Raf DN,
  HT1080-MEK DN, and HT1080-Rac DN) and activated (MCH603c8-Rafact, MCH603c8-MEKact,
  and MCH603c8-Racact) mutants, respectively. The horizontal and diagonal arrows indicate
  probable cross talk between the Raf and Rac1 pathways. The positive or negative
  cross talk may be direct or indirect. Also, the specific level at which the cross
  talk takes place is not clear in every case.
