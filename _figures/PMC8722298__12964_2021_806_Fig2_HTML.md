caption: 'VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor, MMPs: matrix metalloproteinases,
  UPA: urokinase-type plasminogen activator, HUVECS:Human umbilical vein endothelial
  cells. Mechanisms by which sEVs promote angiogenesis when secreted to distant organs.
  When sEVs reach distant organs, TSPAN8 and other four asppanins carried on them
  can enhance the expression of pro-vascular factors such as VEGF, MMPs and UPA. Secondly,
  miRNA, circ-iars and other components carried by pancreatic cancer-derived sEVs
  promote angiogenesis by inducing HMVEC growth. In addition, non-tumor cell-derived
  sEVs can also promote angiogenesis. TAMS-derived sEVs promote angiogenesis by activating
  the TGF-β signaling pathway and down-regulating TGFbR3'
