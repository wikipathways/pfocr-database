caption: Metabolic competition between tumor cells and T cells in the tumor microenvironment.
  The nutrient interplay between malignant and nonmalignant cells, especially immune
  cells, can potentially influence cancer cells growth, survival, and function. Tumors
  might inhibit immunity through nutrient consumption and simultaneously produce metabolites
  to inhibit T cell function, resulting in tumor escape from the immune system. In
  TME, tumor cells outcompete T cells for glucose, leading to sustained mTOR signaling
  and glycolysis in the tumor cells. Additionally, increased glycolysis by tumor cells
  leads to the release of lactate via MCT4, which enhances immunosuppression and angiogenesis.
  In contrast to PD-1 and CTLA-4, which inhibit the mTOR-mediated upregulation of
  glycolysis, the co-stimulation of the CD28 signaling pathway and signaling mediated
  via cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-15 activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to promote
  the switch of the T cell metabolism to glycolysis. Tumor cells also affect T cells
  via releasing high-[K+]e, which induced inhibition of TCR-mediated Akt and mTOR
  phosphorylation and induced the upregulation of PD-1. Cancer cells also evade immune
  responses by releasing cytosolic ARG1 or mitochondrial ARG2 results in diminished
  levels of arginine and reduced mTOR activity and inhibition of T cells in the TME.
  Additionally, upregulation of IDO1 and TDO2 by cancer cells leads to the tryptophan
  degradation into kynurenine which supports the Treg phenotype in an AhR repentant
  manner. Overexpression of mTORC2 target SGK1 mediates tumor growth and invasion
  in different cancer types. Overexpression of the SGK1 target, NDRG1, is suggested
  to stimulate IL-1 expression and promote tumor angiogenesis through JNK/AP-1 activation.
  Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling induce lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake through
  promoting SREBP1 and PPARγ. CCL2 secreted by TAMs render cancer cells resistance
  through activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. TME, tumor microenvironment; mTOR,
