caption: A general schema of the multi-step process that leads to sumoylation of a
  target protein. 1. The SUMO peptide is activated by the formation of a thioester
  bond between its C-terminal glycine and the catalytic cysteine of the E1 activating
  enzyme heterodimer (Aos/Uba2) in a process requiring ATP hydrolysis. 2. activated
  SUMO is transferred to the catalytic cysteine of the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9.
  3. The SUMO moiety is next transferred from E2 to the specific substrate often harboring
  a lysine residue within the consensus sequence ΨKXE, where Ψ is a large hydrophobic
  residue and K the modified lysine, in the presence of an E3 ligases. 4. Sumo-specific
  peptidases (SENPs) complete the cycle by removing the Sumo moiety from target substrates.
