caption: 'The red blood cell—inflammation vicious circle in sickle cell disease. From
  RBC alterations to oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction: Sickled
  RBC are very fragile and prone to hemolyze. Hemolysis leads to the release of heme,
  iron, Hb and arginase into the plasma, which interfere with the metabolism/bioavailability
  of NO: (I) free arginase may hydrolyze the NO precursor Arginine; (II) free Hb scavenges
  NO at a rate of 1,000-fold faster than Hb encapsulated in the RBCs; (III) heme and
  iron increase ROS generation, which lead to the production of peroxynitrite. ROS
  production is also enhanced by Xanthine Oxidase activation, caused by the repetition
  of ischemic/reperfusion events. Decreased NO bioavailability and increased ROS activate
  endothelial cells, which in turn express adhesion molecules of both the CAM and
  Selectin families, promoting cell-cell interactions. Free heme is able to activate
  endothelial TLR4, which promotes inflammasome activation and cytokines production
  through NF-κB activation. Heme may also activate neutrophils, which would release
  NETs that can also affect endothelial cells and act as a scaffold for platelets
  and RBCs. Recent evidence also showed that free heme could stimulate the complement
  pathway with potential consequences at the endothelial cell level. From inflammation
  and oxidative stress to RBC alterations: This pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative
  environment, resulting from sickle RBCs alterations, also impacts on RBC rheology
  and physiology. Increased ROS production may lower RBC deformability and increase
  RBC aggregation. Decreased NO bioavailability could also participate in the decrease
  of RBC deformability and promote eryptosis. NETs could also promote RBC eryptosis.
  Circulating inflammatory molecules, such as ET-1 and TGF-β, may activate RBC NADPH
  Oxidase, which in turn would produce ROS and further alter RBC. ROS and ET-1 are
  known to activate the RBC Gárdos channel, which could favor RBC dehydration and
  further promote HbS polymerization. The enhanced release of MP by sickled RBCs could
  further exacerbate inflammation and oxidative stress. Increased RBC phosphatidylserine
  exposure may favor the binding of complement proteins at the surface of RBCs, which
  can induce their lysis. RBCs also act as a reservoir and/or a sink for pro-inflammatory
  cytokines/chemokines. IL-8, TNF-α, and RANTES promote RBC dehydration through Gárdos
  channel activation in RBCs expressing DARC. IL-8 and RANTES can also lead to the
  activation of α4β1 integrin in sickle reticulocytes expressing DARC, contributing
  to the adhesion of these cells to the endothelium.'
