caption: 'Potential proton transfer pathways in the bd oxidase from G. thermodenitrificans
  (PDB 5DOQ). The side chains of the residues that are involved in CydA and Cyd B
  proton transfer pathway are shown. Proton transfer pathways are crucial for protons
  to gain access to the oxygen-binding site. Two potential proton transfer routes,
  named the CydA pathway and CydB pathway respectively, have been identified: the
  former is located inside of the four-helix bundle α1–4 of CydA and the latter in
  the symmetry-related α1–4 four-helix bundle of CydB. HDD, haem d; HEB, haem b595.
