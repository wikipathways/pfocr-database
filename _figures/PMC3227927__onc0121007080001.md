caption: 'Signaling pathways and effects of EGFR. Upon binding to one of multiple
  ligands, EGFR dimerizes with another member of the EGFR family, leading to the activation
  of the TK domain, phosphorylation of critical tyrosine residues in the EGFR intracellular
  domain, and activation of downstream signaling pathways, including MAPK, JAK-STAT,
  PLC, and PI3K–Akt. Collectively, EGFR signaling may lead to increased cell proliferation,
  decreased apoptosis, increased angiogenesis, increased invasion, and increased metastasis.
  As depicted above, multiple opportunities exist to inhibit EGFR signaling; for example,
  monoclonal antibodies (e.g., cetuximab and panitumumab) interact with the extracellular
  domain of EGFR preventing ligand-induced activation of the receptor, and small-molecule
  inhibitors (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib, and lapatinib) block activation of the TK
  domain preventing induction of EGFR signaling pathways. Specific EGFR mutations
  may lead to constitutive activation of EGFR regardless of ligand binding and/or
  resistance of EGFR to the effects of TK inhibitors. Independent of receptor status,
  EGFR downstream signaling may become aberrantly activated; for example, mutant Ras
  may lead to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway or mutation/loss of PTEN
  may lead to loss of negative regulation of the PI3K–Akt pathway.Abbreviations: DAG,
  diacylglycerol; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; IP3, inositol triphosphate;
  JAK, Janus kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular
  signal–related kinase kinase; PDK, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase;
  PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; PKC, protein
  kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on
  chromosome ten; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TGF, transforming
  growth factor; TK, tyrosine kinase.'
