caption: 'The occurrence and regulation mechanism of ferroptosis in cells. The figure
  highlights the five currently known mechanisms involved in ferroptosis: lipid reactive
  oxygen metabolism pathway, cystine glutamate transport receptor (System Xc-) metabolic
  pathway, iron metabolism pathway, and VDAC receptor pathway.'
