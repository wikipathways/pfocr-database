caption: (A) A DNA ICL is recognized by the FANCM-FAAP24-MHF1/2 (FAAP16/FAAP10) complex
  and UHRF1 at stalled replication forks. CMG unloading is required for the replication
  fork to approach the ICL and is mediated by TRAIP-dependent MCM7 polyubiquitination
  and extraction from DNA by the AAA+ ATPase p97/VCP. (B) FANCM at stalled forks promotes
  the ATR checkpoint and activates the FA core complex, targeting it to DNA ICLs.
  The FA core complex is composed of three central modules that are responsible for
  catalysis, structural integrity, and substrate targeting. (C) UBE2T ubiquitin E2
  conjugating enzyme and the FA core ubiquitin E3 ligase complex monoubiquitinate
  FANCD2 to target the ID complex to ICLs. (D) FANCD2-Ub functions as a platform to
  recruit the SLX4/FANCP-XPF/FANCQ nuclease complex to incise and unhook the DNA ICL.
  The SNM1A exonuclease may process the unhooked intermediate to facilitate downstream
  lesion bypass. (E) The lesion bypass by the REV1-polζ TLS polymerase complex restores
  the nascent strand and resumes replication. (F) The DNA double-strand break (DSB)
  ends are processed and repaired by HR, which is mediated by the recombinase RAD51/FANCR
  and its associated HR factors. Regulated turnover of RAD51 (and RPA) by RFWD3/FANCW
  is required for completion of the HR step. (G) FANCD2-Ub activity is downregulated
  by the USP1-UAF1 deubiquitinase complex and p97-dependent extraction of the ID complex
  from DNA lesions.
