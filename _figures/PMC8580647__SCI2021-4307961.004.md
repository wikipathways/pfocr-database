caption: 'The main regulatory pathways of TGF-β and BMP in bone ECM. TGF-β is produced
  predominantly by osteoblasts and deposited into the matrix with LAP. Activated TGF-β
  requires osteoclastic bone resorption by dislodging LAP []. Smad2/3 is phosphorylated
  and connects with Smad4 when TGF-β combines with its receptors. The complex of Smad2/3
  with Smad4 could transport into the upstream of Col1α and into other target gene
  transcription start sites. The complex upregulates gene expressions to promote collagen
  production [, ], and it is inhibited by Smad7. The phosphorylated Smad2/3 could
  inhibit the expression of Runx2 by combining with HDACs []. On the other hand, TGF-β
  influences Runx2 expression to suppress bone mineralization and osteogenesis by
  the MAPK pathway, independent of Smad3. The p38 MAPK pathway directly regulates
  the expression of Runx2. And the MAPK-ERK pathway reduces the expression of Runx2
  by upregulating SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (SMURF1) [, ]. BMP could
  improve the expression of Runx2 by Smad1/5/8 and Smad4 or the p38 MAPK pathway for
  regulating skeleton formation [, ]. And the process of the combination of Smad4
  could suppress the formation of the Smad2/Smad3/Smad4 complex. TGF-β: transforming
