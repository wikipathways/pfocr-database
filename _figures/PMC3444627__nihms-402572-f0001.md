caption: 'Bone regeneration or bone remodeling involves bone resorption by osteoclasts
  (OC) and the following bone formation by osteoblasts (OB) within basic multicellular
  units (BMU). Three cytokines were considered: TGFβ, Wnt and BMP2. Intracellular
  signaling pathway consists of Smad2/3, Smad 1/5, βCatenin, and Runx2 and Osx. Runx2
  can promote the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into pre-osteoblasts
  (OBp) and can inhibit the differentiation of pre-osteoblasts into active osteoblasts
  (OBa). Osx also play a promoting role in the later stage of osteoblastic lineage
  which interacts with osteoclastic lineage through intercellular signaling pathway
  RANK-RANKL OPG.'
