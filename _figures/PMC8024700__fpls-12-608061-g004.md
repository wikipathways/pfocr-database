caption: 'Different doses of Brassinosteroid regulates the opening and closing of
  stomata: at low concentration of BR activate respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH)
  which further increases the level of H2O2 resulting in opening of stomata whereas
  at high concentration, it causes the accumulation of H2O2 and also reducing the
  uptake of K+ ions in guard cells lead to the activation of abscisic acid (ABA) cause
  closure of stomata (). Brassinosteroid hormone received by a specific receptor,
  brassinosteroid insensitive1 (BR1), on plasma membrane. Furthermore, there is increase
  in Ca2+ infux that activates the NADPH oxidase and then bind with EF-motif of RBOH
  enhancing the production of ROS (); another pathway is upregulation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) which further scavenge the reactive oxygen species (ROS);
  BR also stimulates the production of nitric oxide (NO) resulting the enhancement
  in antioxidative defense system ().'
