caption: Infection by SARS-CoV-2 intracellularly delivers NSP1 and ORF6, which efficiently
  inhibit STAT1 function (1). Repression of STAT1 increases STAT3 (2) activity. STAT3
  upregulates PAI-1 (3) by repressing miR-34a, a PAI-1 inhibitor (4). This increased
  PAI-1 reciprocally activates STAT3 by blocking PIAS3, a STAT3 inhibitor (5). STAT3
  can activate HAS2, a hyaluronic acid synthase, which produces hyaluronan (HA) and
  leads to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) characterized by hyaline membrane formation
  (6). Fragments of HA (LMW-HA) activate PAI-1 (3). An escalating cycle of stimulation
  between STAT3 and PAI-1 begins a catastrophic cascade of events, resulting in combinations
  of coagulopathy/thrombosis (7), macrophage production of cytokines and chemokines
  (8), and profibrotic changes (9). Hypoxia eventually results, which further induces
  PAI-1 transcription through HIF-1α (10). This elevated PAI-1 activity then drives
  IL-6 production via TLR4, which in turn stimulates even more STAT3 activity (No.
  11). Elevated STAT3 also activates PD-L1 in endothelial cells, leading to T cell
  lymphopenia (No. 12). Details of these events are described in the main text. Italicized
  outside labels are cell types, and non-italicized outside labels are locations.
  Bolded italicized text indicates disease states. Bent arrows indicate the transcriptional
  induction of the indicated target proteins. Straight arrows indicate direct activation.
  Dashed lines indicate direct inhibition.
