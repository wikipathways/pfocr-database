caption: 'Proposed CHIKV signalling cascades. Engagement of the pathogen receptors
  in cells (TLR-X) and (RIG-I) induces a cascade that activates the type I interferons.
  Recognition of viral RNA in the endosomes of infected cells leads to the recruitment
  of adaptor proteins such as MyD88. This results in activating several signalling
  cascades and the phosphorylation of transcription factors: IRF3, IRF7 and NF-kB
  (Nuclear factor kappa B). When phosphorylated, these transcription factors can translocate
  from the cytosol into the nucleus and induce the transcription of type I interferons
  (IFN-α and IFN-β) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-α). CHIK nsP2,
  E2 and E1 proteins suppress IFN-β through the MDA5-RIG-I pathway. Created with BioRender.com
