caption: (At left) A model for CLV pathway signaling at the shoot meristem. Apically-generated
  CLV3 signal primarily activates CLV1 on the apical face of L3 stem cells within
  the shoot meristem. CLV1 in turn negatively regulates POL/PLL1 primarily on the
  apical portion of the cell. Upon periclinal division, the asymmetric distribution
  of POL/PLL1 drives apical/basal fates, including the activation of WUS in the basal
  daughter.
papertitle: POLTERGEIST and PLL1 are required for stem cell function with potential
  roles in cell asymmetry and auxin signaling.
