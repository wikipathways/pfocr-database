caption: 'The cross-talk between BMP and cytokines signaling pathway in neural differentiation.
  (1) The interaction of cytokines and JAK components results in STAT3 phosphorylation
  and dimerization. Dimerized STAT3 is translocated into the nucleus, leading to astrocyte
  differentiation. (2) The synergistic effects between cytokines and BMP signaling
  in astrocyte differentiation are exerted through two different pathways: (a) LIF
  induces STAT3, while BMP2 activates Smad1 through their receptors. p300, a transcriptional
  coactivator, interacts with STAT3 and Smad1 resulting in the formation of STAT3/Smad1/p300
  transcriptional complex and promotion of astrocyte differentiation (Black arrows).
  (b) Cytokines (LIF), can create a booster para-regulatory pathway in which activated
  STAT3 increases the expression of BMP2. The presence of BMP2 increases the activated
  Smad1 which induces astrogliogenesis (Red arrows).'
