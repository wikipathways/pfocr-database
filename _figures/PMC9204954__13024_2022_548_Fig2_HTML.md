caption: Bile acids, TMAO and tryptophan metabolic pathways and their links to the
  brain. Primary bile acids are produced from cholesterol breakdown in the liver.
  They can be conjugated with taurine or glycine residues before travelling to the
  gut, where they are deconjugated and converted to secondary bile acids via microbial
  action. Bile acids have been found in the brain of humans and rodents suggesting
  they can cross the blood–brain barrier via either diffusion (unconjugated) or active
  transport (conjugated) and influence the central nervous system. TMAO is produced
  via a two-stage process. TMA is first formed from the microbial conversion of choline
  in the gut. TMA then travels to the liver, where the FMO1/3 enzyme converts it to
  TMAO. Recent evidence found TMAO in human brains, indicating it can cross the blood–brain
  barrier. Tryptophan can be metabolised via three key pathways. Firstly, via gut
  microbial action, tryptophan can be converted via the indole pathway into numerous
  indole derivatives, or into the amino acid, tryptamine. Indoles and tryptamine are
  known to cross the BBB. Secondly, around 3% of dietary tryptophan is metabolised
  into serotonin and melatonin via numerous enzymes in the serotonin pathway. Notably,
  serotonin produced in the gut cannot cross the blood–brain barrier. However, the
  serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and serotonin derivatives, N-acetylserotonin
  and melatonin, can cross the blood–brain barrier and influence the central nervous
  system. Finally, the majority of tryptophan (~ 90–95%) is metabolised via the kynurenine
  pathway, of which 90% occurs in the liver. This pathway is initiated by the TDO
  enzyme in the liver and the IDO enzyme in the brain. Only kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine
  and tryptophan itself can cross the blood–brain barrier. However, once in the brain,
  tryptophan can be metabolised via both the kynurenine and serotonin pathways to
  form the pathway’s intermediates
