caption: Ganglioside structure and biosynthetic pathway. Lactosyl-ceramide, formed
  by the addition of two carbohydrate moieties (glucose and galactose) to the terminal
  OH group of ceramide, is the precursor of gangliosides. GM1 has one terminal N-acetylneuraminic
  acid (sialic acid) group. GD1a, which has two terminal sialic acid groups, is converted
  into GM1 by neuraminidase.
