caption: 'The network of the metabolic pathways potentially related to SBPH resistance
  in the SBPH-resistant rice plant. The up-regulated metabolic pathway was marked
  with red box and the red arrows denote the steps in the up-regulated metabolic pathways;
  the down-regulated metabolic pathway was marked with green box and the green arrows
  denote the steps in the down-regulated metabolic pathways. Abreviations: IAA, indole-3-acetic
  acid; SAM, S-adenosyl-methionine; Dc-SAM, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine; VLCFA,
  the very long chain fatty acid; TCA cycle, tricarboxylicacidcycle acid cycle.'
