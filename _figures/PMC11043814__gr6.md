caption: Comprehensive metabolic pathways of non-volatile metabolites and enzymes.
  The left side of the small rectangle of the black border represents the content
  of the metabolite in FF Daqu, and the right side represents the content of the metabolite
  in CT Daqu. Red represents the higher content of the substance in the Daqu. The
  yellow rectangle and the blue rectangle represent the up-regulated expression and
  down-regulated expression of the enzyme, respectively. (For interpretation of the
  references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
