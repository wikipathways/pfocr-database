caption: Metabolic Reprogramming and Drug Resistance in Breast Cancer. Metabolic reprogramming
  drives drug resistance in breast cancer cells. Glycolysis converts glucose into
  lactate, which is exported by MCTs, creating a barrier that limits drug penetration.
  Pyruvate enters the TCA cycle in the mitochondria, producing energy molecules like
  NADH and FADH2 that support cell survival. Amino acid metabolism, particularly involving
  glutamine and glutamate, supplies crucial intermediates for cellular functions.
  Lipid metabolism, regulated by the mTOR signaling pathway, influences fatty acid
  oxidation and maintains energy homeostasis. These metabolic adaptations enable breast
  cancer cells to withstand therapeutic stress, promoting drug resistance
