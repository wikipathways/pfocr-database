caption: A model of the elements and downstream targets of the cAMP/protein kinase
  A (PKA) pathway in C. neoformans. The components upstream of the intended pathway
  are associated with the cell membrane and respond to external signals such as glucose
  and amino acids [39,49]. The components include the G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr4,
  a regulator of G-protein signaling Crg2, a Gbeta-like/RACK1 homolog Gib2, and the
  G-protein alpha subunit Gpa1 [46,49]. Together, these proteins drive the activity
  of adenylyl cyclase (Cac1) and the Aca1 protein, as well as CO2/HCO3−, ultimately
  affecting cAMP levels [40]. Additionally, phosphodiesterases (Pde1/2) can reduce
  cAMP levels, and signals can also modulate the function of protein kinase A (PKA)
  by affecting the levels of cAMP, which binds the regulatory subunit (Pkr1) and causes
  it to dissociate from the catalytic subunits Pka1 and Pka2 [21,50]. Transcription
  factors Rim101 and Nrg1 regulate some of these processes, although not all direct
  connections are recognized in every case [51]. This pathway is illustrated by arrows
  from Pka1, with the potential involvement of other regulatory factors suggested
  by the protein marked with a question mark
