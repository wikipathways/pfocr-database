caption: 'A schematic overview shows the impacts of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis
  C virus proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway. In an inactive state, cytoplasmic
  β-Catenin interacts with a multiprotein degradation complex comprised of CK1a, APC,
  GSK3β, and Axin, and following phosphorylation, is targeted for proteasome-dependent
  degradation. On binding Wnt ligands to FZD and LRP5/6 receptors, the scaffolding
  protein DVL is recruited to the membrane and phosphorylates GSK3β leading to the
  disassembly of the β-Catenin destruction complex. This event results in the rescue
  of β-Catenin from proteasomal degradation leading to its accumulation in the cytoplasm
  and eventually allowing its translocation to the nucleus. Consequently, β-Catenin
  activates the transcription of target genes through interaction with TCF and LEF
  family members. Wnt signaling is regulated by secreted proteins, including SFRPs
  and DKKs, which inhibit Wnt signaling by binding to FZD and LRP5/6 receptors, respectively.
  Independent of its transcriptional activity, β-Catenin, forming a complex with E-cadherin,
  also facilitates cellular junctions between cells. The disintegration of E-cadherin
  production causes the dissociation of the complex and subsequent internalization
  of β-Catenin, ending with activation of its target genes. Hepatitis B virus and
  hepatitis C virus proteins deregulate the expression of various components of the
  Wnt/β-Catenin pathway and contribute to tumor development and behavior. APC: Adenomatous
  polyposis coli; CK1: Casein kinase 1a; DKK: Dickkopf family of proteins; DVL: Disheveled
  segment polarity protein; FZD: Frizzled family of the receptor; GSK3b: Glycogen
  synthase kinase–3b; LEF: Lymphoid enhancing factor; Lrp5/6: LDL receptor-related
  protein 5/6; SFRPs: Secreted frizzled-related protein; TCF: DNA-bound T-cell factor;
