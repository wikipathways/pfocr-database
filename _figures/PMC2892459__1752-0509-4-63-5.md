caption: Overlay of Ifn-β timecourse analysis onto the macrophage pathway using BioLayout
  Express3D. Views of regions of the macrophage pathway where components were found
  to be regulated Ifn-β. Components regulated at the level of gene expression are
  enlarged and coloured according to their cluster membership. All non-regulated components
  and other nodes are grey. (a) Regulation of Toll Like Receptor Signalling. All endosomal
  TLRs, Myd88 and Tifa genes are induced from 1 h, their expression being maximally
  up-regulated at 4-8 h post-Ifn-β treatment. (b) Regulation of death-receptor and
  apoptosis signalling. The expression of all regulated components in this module
  rises from 1 h and reaches a maximum 2-4 h post-treatment. In contrast, the expression
  of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2 is suppressed at 4 h. (c) Regulation of the transcriptional
  targets of interferon signalling. 7 genes (shown in yellow) belong to cluster 2
  and their expression induced from 1 h, becoming maximal at 4 h. 4 genes (in purple)
  were in cluster 3, with expression rising from 1 h and remaining maximal throughout
  4-8 h post-treatment. Irf1 (in green) reaches maximal expression at 2 h. (d) Regulation
  of type I and type II interferon signalling. All receptor components, except Ifngr1,
  belong to clusters of induced genes. Socs1 and Socs3 are induced and reach maximal
  expression at early time points (1-2 or 2 h).
