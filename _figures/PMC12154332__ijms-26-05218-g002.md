caption: 'Serotonin and BDNF initiate neurogenesis. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis
  (AHN) persists throughout life in mammals, including humans. AHN is the creation
  (from neural stem cells (NSCs)) of new neurons, which integrate into the existing
  neural circuit of the adult brain. Most NSCs are concentrated in the dentate gyrus
  of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
  is one of the brain regions affected first in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
  Neurogenic processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and
  maturation, are led by neurotrophic factors. Expression of BDNF in serotoninergic
  neurons increases stress tolerance and stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis in adults.
  BDNF activates the TrKB receptor, which acts via protein kinase C to activate proteins
  involved in cell survival and cell migration. The hippocampus expresses various
  5-HT receptor subtypes, most of which (i.e., 5-HT1A, 2A, 3, 4, and 6) are expressed
  in the DG subregion of the hippocampus. The 5-HT2A receptor is the main subtype
  of serotonin receptors mediating its excitatory action. 5-HT2A receptors are localized
  predominantly in the plasma membrane and also enter the cell under the action of
  beta-arrestin. This results in the activation of NF-kB and NFAT, and mitochondrial
  biogenesis. The 5-HT1A receptor activates the CREB and K+ channel. Selective stimulation
  of 5-HT1A receptors increases the number of proliferating cells. Activation of the
  5-HT3 receptor leads to membrane depolarization, the opening of voltage-dependent
  Ca2+ channels, and activation of calcineurin phosphatase and the NFAT transcription
  factor. 5-HT4 initiates the expression of BDNF. The 5-HT6 receptor is involved in
  the initiation of neurite outgrowth (NeuOG) by the agonist independently activating
  the cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)-Cdc42 signaling pathway. The 5-HT signaling
  pathway activates the CREB, which promotes the transcription of the BDNF gene. Abbreviations:
