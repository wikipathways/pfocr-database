caption: 'Possible mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effect of acacetin on liver
  disease. JNK/STAT3 signaling pathway is activated in HCC; TLR4 signaling, and ER
  stress promote ALI development; ferroptosis/ER stress participates in the pathogenesis
  of NAFLD; TGF-β/Smad3 and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways play a critical role in fibrosis.
  Acacetin improves liver disease by inhibiting signaling pathways above in vivo and/or
  in vitro. HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma, NAFLD: Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,
  ALI: acute liver injury [168]'
