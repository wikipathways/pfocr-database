caption: 'Metabolic pathway of prenylated flavonoids in plants. The dashed red boxes
  show the prenylation sites related to MVA and MEP pathways. MVA pathway: Acetyl-CoA,
  thiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA, HMG-CoA synthase (HMGS), 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA
  (HMG-CoA), HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), mevalonic acid (MVA), mevalonic acid 5-kinase
  (MK); mevalonic acid phosphate (MVP), mevalonic acid phosphate 5-kinase (MPK); mevalonic
  acid 5-diphosphate (MVPP), mevalonic acid diphosphate decarboxylase (MVD); isopentenyl
  diphosphate (IPP), isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI), dimethylallyl diphosphate
  (DMAPP). MEP pathway: Piruvate + Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate
  synthase (DXS), 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP), 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate
  reductoisomerase (DXR), 2C-Methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP), MEP cytidyl transferase
  (MCT), 4-(Cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2C-methyl-D-erythritol (CDP-ME), Cytidyl MEP kinase
  (CMK), 4-(Cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2-phosphate (CDP-MEP), MEP-2,4-cyclodiphosphate
  synthase (MDS), 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP), (E)-4-Hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl
  diphosphate synthase (HDS), (E)-4-Hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate (HMBPP),
  (E)-4-Hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HDR), isopentenyl diphosphate
  (IPP), Dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI).
  Next, endogenous FPP synthase converts DMAPP and IPP into more extended prenyl donors,
  such as geranyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate. Additionally, flavonoid prenyltransferase
  enzymes (SfN8DT-1, SfG68DT, LaPT1) can produce diverse prenylated flavonoids by
  condensation with prenyl donors. This is the most crucial stage in PF compound production
  in plants'
