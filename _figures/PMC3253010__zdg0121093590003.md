caption: Upregulation of a highly significant Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) gene
  network (IPA network score = 50) in response to endurance training in high responders
  (A), but not in low responders (B). Aerobic training was found to be associated
  with differential increases (>1.5 FC, dark gray boxes) and decreases (>1.4 FC, light
  gray boxes) in gene expression mostly in the high responders to aerobic training.
  Those genes that were upregulated in the low responders were upregulated to a significantly
  greater extent in high responders (). The network involves a number of extracellular
  matrix genes, VEGF signaling and associates with terms such as “cardiovascular development.”
  This is consistent with the TopGO analysis presented online in Supplementary Fig.
  S4.
