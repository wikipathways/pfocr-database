caption: 1.In the context of ApoE4, microglia exhibit pathological features such as
  lipid accumulation, increased ROS production, elevated ICs secretion, and lysosomal
  dysfunction, which impair their phagocytic function and effective clearance of Aβ
  [36, 94, 129]. ROS reduce the activity of Aβ-degrading enzymes, such as IDE and
  NEP [130, 131], while inflammatory cytokines promote the expression of APP as well
  as β- and γ-secretases, thereby enhancing APP processing [132, 133]. 2.ApoE4 may
  drive microglia to shift from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis to meet the high energy
  demands of the inflammatory respons. In this process, the TREM2/mTOR pathway plays
  a crucial role [39]. However, ApoE4 may negatively regulate TREM2 signaling [95,
  97]. Furthermore, ApoE4 could interfere with Aβ uptake and internalization by competing
  with Aβ for receptors like LRP1 and LDLR [32, 33]. 3.ApoE4 can activate ERK and
  NF-κB signaling and inhibit insulin signaling, promoting the transcription of APP
  and BACE1 [10, 28, 57, 134]. 4.ApoE4 may act as a molecular chaperone to facilitate
  the internalization of APP and promote the co-localization of APP and BACE1 in EE,
  while delaying endosome-lysosome recycling [18–20]. 5.Both ApoE4 and Aβ can activate
  CDK5 signaling or increase ROS production, leading to GF, which increases the co-localization
  of APP and BACE1 and promotes Aβ generation [53, 135]. AKT, protein Kinase B; APP,
