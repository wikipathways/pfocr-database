caption: Cytoscape network analysis of serum lipid and amino acid metabolites in RB-fed
  infants at 12 mo compared with the control group at 12 mo. (A) Pathway-specific
  network visualization for serum lipid metabolites. (B) Pathway-specific network
  visualization for serum amino acid metabolites. Scores < or >1 represent PESs that
  indicate that the pathway contains ≥1 metabolites with statistically significant
  fold-differences between the RB group and control at 12 mo compared with all other
  pathways within the matrix. Red nodes indicate significant increased difference
  (P < 0.05) between the RB and the control groups, with a metabolite ratio of ≥1.
  Light red nodes indicate narrowly missed statistical increase cutoffs for significance
  (0.05 < P < 0.10) between the RB and control groups. Blue nodes indicate significant
  decrease differences (P < 0.05) between the RB and the control groups, with a metabolite
  ratio of <1. Light-blue nodes indicate narrowly missed statistical decrease cutoffs
  for significance (0.05 < P < 0.10) between the RB and control groups, and black
  nodes indicate nonsignificant differences between the RB and control groups. Each
  metabolite is represented as a node extending from a central submetabolic pathway
  node, also identified as the PES. The central hexagon is the super metabolic pathway.
  PES, pathway enrichment score; RB, rice bran. SAM, S-adenosyl methionine. *Indicates
  dual identification from RB food metabolome.
