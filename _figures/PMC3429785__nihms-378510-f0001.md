caption: Upon engagement with cellular receptor and coreceptor, gp120 and gp41 undergo
  a conformational change resulting in extension of gp41 into the prehairpin intermediate,
  exposing the hydrophobic pocket region of the N-trimer. gp41 collapses into the
  trimer-of-hairpins structure, juxtaposing the viral and host membranes and causing
  membrane fusion. The hydrophobic pocket targeted by PIE12 is an estimated 60 Å from
  the cell membrane, which can be bridged by a relaxed PEG24 linker. In contrast,
  the C-peptide C-terminus is directly adjacent to the membrane. Cholesterol (red)
  conjugated with PEG spacers (black lines) are shown.
