caption: Hedgehog (HH), Notch, and Wnt signaling are key stem cell self-renewal pathways
  that are deregulated in lung cancer and thus represent potential therapeutic targets
  (i). Agents inhibiting the hedgehog pathway include monoclonal antibodies against
  HH ligand and cyclopamine, which is a small molecule inhibitor of smoothened (SMO).
  Monoclonal antibodies against Wnt ligand and frizzled (FZD) receptor and inhibitors
  of protein complexes mediating Wnt signaling, such as Wnt-FZD or β-catenin–transcription
  factor (β-Cat-TCF), are examples of ways of targeting the Wnt pathway. Strategies
  of blocking or silencing Notch signaling can be either selective, such as the targeting
  of individual Notch receptors with antisense or monoclonal antibodies, or nonselective,
  such as the use of soluble receptor decoys that sequester Notch ligands or γ-secretase
  inhibitors. Solid and dashed arrows represent multiple components of these pathways
  that, for simplicity, are not detailed here. These components also represent potential
  therapeutic targets. Other methods of targeting cancer stem cells include immunotherapy-based
  approaches against antigens present on cancer stem cells (ii); targeting cancer
  stem cell mechanisms of resistance to cytotoxic therapy by inhibiting DNA repair
  enzymes such as the checkpoint kinases (Chk1, Chk2) (iii); targeting stem cell–specific
  survival mechanisms with telomerase inhibitors (GRN163L) (iv); and inducing stem
  cell differentiation with soluble factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)
  (v). GLI, glioma-associated oncogene; GLIACT, active form of GLI; GLIREP, repressor
  form of GLI; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; CSL, CBF1, suppressor of hairless,
  Lag-1; TACE, TNF-α–converting enzyme; ADAM10, a disintegrin and metalloprotease
  domain 10; PTCH, patched homolog; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; CSK1α, cyclin-suppressing
  kinase 1; DSH, dishevelled.
