caption: A wiring diagram describing the multiple interactions downstream of FGFR
  that lead to activation of the Ras/MAPK and PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways.
  The adaptor protein Grb2 is recruited by FRS2α directly and indirectly by means
  of Shp2 molecules in complex with FRS2α. Recruitment of Grb2 by tyrosine-phosphorylated
  Shc provides an alternative FRS2α-independent mechanism for MAPK activation. FGF
  stimulation of coordinated assembly of a ternary Gab1/Grb2/FRS2α complex results
  in tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1, followed by recruitment and activation of PI
  3-kinase (PI-3K). Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), the reaction product
  of PI 3-kinase, is responsible for activation of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase
  (PDK) and the antiapoptotic protein kinase Akt. In addition, the binding of the
  PH domain of Gab1 to PIP3 results in a feedback loop for recruitment of Gab1-bound
  signaling proteins. MAPKK, MAPK kinase.
