caption: 'The genes that are shaded red are up-regulated and those that are green
  are down-regulated. The intensity of the color shows the degree of up-or down-regulation.
  A solid line represents a direct interaction while a dotted line represents an indirect
  interaction between the two gene products (A). Working Model: Increased expression
  of UCH L1 in malignant cells leads to cell cycle progression, increased proliferation
  and migration and at the same time abrogation of apoptotic pathways and immune responses
  and thus promotes tumor progression (B).'
