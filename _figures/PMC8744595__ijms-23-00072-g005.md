caption: A schematic representation of how MDA-7/IL-24 regulates toxic autophagy in
  cancer cells leading to cell death. MDA-7/IL-24 regulates autophagy mediated through
  ER stress and ceramide production. MDA-7/IL-24 first interacts with its receptors
  which leads to a downstream signaling pathway mediated by reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). ROS regulates DICER and through this molecule MDA-7/IL-24 downregulates miR-221,
  which in turn upregulates Beclin-1 to induce toxic autophagy leading to cell death.
  The transition of protective to toxic autophagy is explained by the cleavage of
  ATG5 by Calpain, which is also mediated by ROS induced from MDA-7/IL-24 treatment.
