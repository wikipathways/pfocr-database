caption: Simplistic overview of the top two mutation-enriched transduction signaling
  pathways in ATC as according to the Genomatix Pathway System. The ErbB (top) and
  MAPK/Erk (bottom) signaling pathways are illustrated with each mutated gene depicted.
  Gene products are drawn as rounded rectangles, snip-sided rectangles denote proteins
  with kinase properties and star-shaped symbols denote co-factors. The top right
  number denotes the number of sources for a chemical association with established
  molecules (for therapeutic purposes), the lower right number refers to the number
  of established interactions within the pathway in addition to the drawn association.
  Filled lines with arrows denote an activating effect; filled lines with stop line
  and circle denote inhibitory effect. Dotted lines indicate evidence at the level
  of co-citation, in contrast to filled lines which indicate evidence at expert-curation
  level.
