caption: In addition to glucose, the synthesis of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP-GlcNAc) requires input from major metabolic pathways, including amino acid
  (blue), fatty acid (red), and nucleotide (green) metabolism. The first and rate-limiting
  step in this nutrient sensitive pathway involves the isomerization of fructose-6-phosphate
  to produce glucosamine-6-phosphate and is catalyzed by the enzyme glutamin-fructose-6-phosphate
  amidotransferase (GFAT). Alternatively, glucosamine enters the pathway downstream
  of this rate-limiting step. Protein O-GlcNAcylation involves the enzymatic O-linked
  addition of the GlcNAc moiety via the Ser/Thr hydroxyl side chain of a nucleocytoplasmic
  protein (shown as ribbon diagram) and is catalyzed by the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase
  (OGT). The enzyme O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes the removal of the O-GlcNAc modification.
