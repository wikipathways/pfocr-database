caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway created using ‘IL-1β’ as
  a key word. (A) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the NF-κB pathway.
  (B) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the MAPK signaling pathway.
  (C) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the Toll-like receptor signaling
  pathway. (D) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the apoptosis signaling
  pathway. (E) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the pertussis signaling
  pathway. (F) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the legionellosis
  signaling pathway. IL, interleukin, NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase. Activation is reflected as a straight arrow and inhibition is reflected
  as an inverse ‘T’ shape. Indirect activation is reflected as a dotted arrow and
  indirect inhibition is reflected as a dotted inverted ‘T’ shape. Dissociation is
  reflected as equal lines and a missing interaction is reflected as a half arrow.
  The round-edged rectangle represents a membrane receptor and diamond shapes represent
  phosphorylation. The ‘V’ shape represents similarities with factors in . The hexagon
  represents factors found in , the ellipse with white color represents factors found
  in  and the octagon represents factors found in both . Round-edged rectangles with
  white color indicate that both membrane receptor and be found in  and dotted round-edged
  rectangles indicated that both membrane receptor and be found in . White dotted
  round-edged rectangles indicate that both membrane receptor and is found in . Overlapping
  shapes represent a complex.
