caption: Schematic diagram of Nrf2/ARE signaling and mitophagy mediated by UA treatment
  against ALI. UA, a metabolite of ellagitannin natural products in the gastrointestinal
  flora, alleviated acetaminophen-induced oxidative stress and hepatic necrosis via
  activating Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway rather than mitophagy activation. Mechanistically,
  UA interacted with Nrf-2/Keap1 complex, which in turn trigger Nrf2 nuclear translocation,
  subsequently leading to activation of Nrf-2 target genes (HO-1, NQO1), followed
  by suppression of oxidative stress and JNK phosphyralation, thereby protecting against
  AILI.
