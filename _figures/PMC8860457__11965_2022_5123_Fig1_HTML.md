caption: Ebolavirus entry is accomplished by viral spike glycoproteins (GP) and it
  triggers the macropinocytosis pathway. As a result GP are processed by the host
  Cathepsin L and cathepsin B into GP1, it is also has been confirmed Cathepsin L
  and B are not always required for EBOV replication in some cells or all species
  of EBOV. Then this GP1 interacts with the NPC-1 (niemann-pick C-1) in late endosome
  and causes fusion of virus membrane with the vesicle membrane, as result ribonucleocapsid
  is released into cytoplasm. Viral mRNAs transcribed by viral polymerase and viral
  proteins are translated. Replication starts when enough nucleoprotein present to
  encapsulate neo synthesized anti-genomes and genomes. VP40 helps in assembly of
  viral particles and in budding. VP24 suppresses the host immune system by inhibiting
  interferon signaling.
