caption: Graphical representation of selected intracellular effects and induction
  of apoptosis in mammalian cells following internalization of Shiga toxin holotoxins
  (Stx). Upon binding to the Gb3/CD77 receptor, Stxs undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis
  and incorporation into the early endosomal pathway. Along the microtubule, the toxin
  reaches the trans-Golgi network and, by further retrograde transport, the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and eventually the nucleus. In the ER, the A subunit of the holotoxin
  is cleaved and the A1 fragment is translocated into the cytosol. At the ribosomes,
  A1 fragments lead to depurination of 28S rRNA subsequently causing decreased ribosomal
  binding affinity to e(EF1), irreversible inactivation of ribosomes, and inhibition
  of protein synthesis (ribotoxic stress response). In the ER, A1 fragments induce
  the unfolded protein response (UPR) indicated by activation of ER stress markers
  (IRE-1, PERK, not shown). C/EBP homologous protein is induced, which acts pro-apoptotic
  as Bcl-2 is inhibited (not shown). The ribotoxic stress response is linked to NLRP3
  inflammasome generation and IL-1β formation. Via nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD),
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) initiate an increased Ca++ influx into the cytosol
  by opening NAD-dependent Ca++ channels. Intracellular, the calcium-dependent cysteine
  protease calpain is activated. Calpain can activate caspase-8 directly, yet many
  other targets of calpains are known like actin, caspases-3 and -9 (activation),
  and cleavage of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), resulting in inhibition
  of protein translation. Starting from caspase-8, a cascade of events is initiated
  encompassing activation of caspase-3 and caspase-6. The subsequent activation of
  signaling molecules/caspases is also subject to positive feedback loops (e.g., caspase-6
  activating caspase-8, not depicted) and linked to the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
  (caspase-9). The integrity of DNA is targeted via activation (lamin A, acinus, CAD)
  or inactivation of factors (PARP), or depurination by Stx A1 fragment. ROS and tBid
  cleavage are linked to depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and Apaf-1/cytosolic
  cytochrome C-mediated caspase-9 activation. Stress-induced proteins like HSP70 inhibit
  activation of CAD. Dotted lines indicate fundamental cellular biology mechanisms
  not yet specifically linked to Stxs; for details and references see text.
