caption: Biosynthesis and regulation of carotenoids. The red oval indicates the carotenoid
  biosynthetic pathway in the chromoplasts. The yellow arrows indicate the regulatory
  mechanisms initiated by ethylene and light which upregulate carotenoid biosynthesis.
  However, the ABA signaling mediated by PYL 9 inhibits lycopene accumulation
