caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming of activated lung fibroblasts. Activated lung fibroblasts
  utilize aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) over mitochondrial glucose oxidation.
  Although this metabolic reprogramming event generates less ATP than mitochondrial
  respiration, it also supplies various biosynthetic intermediates for activated myofibroblasts.
  This includes the production of glucose-6-P, which is diverted to the pentose phosphate
  pathway for the production of NADPH and ribose-5-P, and the production of glycerate-3-P,
  which is diverted to the de novo serine and glycine synthesis pathway. Aerobic glycolysis
  also yields large amounts of lactate acid, which serves to activate latent TGF-β1
  by reducing extracellular pH. By-products of aerobic glycolysis can also feed the
  TCA cycle, leading to an increase in succinate production. Succinate stabilizes
  HIF-1α, which then amplifies glycolysis by inducing the expression of various glycolytic
  genes and promotes myofibroblast differentiation via the induction of α-SMA expression.
  Activated myofibroblasts also exhibit enhanced glutaminase activity, leading to
  augmented glutaminolysis, which in turn promotes the conversion of glutamine to
  glutamate. Glutamine metabolism via the TCA cycle can yield high levels of α-KG,
  which activates mTOR, leading to increased transcription, translation, and hydroxylation
  of collagen. Abbreviations: α-KG, alpha-ketoglutarate; α-SMA, alpha-smooth muscle
  actin; GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; HIF-1α, hypoxia-induced factor-1 alpha; LDH,
  lactate dehydrogenase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; P, phosphate; PHGDH,
  phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-beta 1.'
