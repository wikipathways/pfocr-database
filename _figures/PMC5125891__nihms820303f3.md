caption: The receptor-mediated (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis is initiated when
  ligands of TNF-α family such as FAS and TNF-α bind their plasma membrane-bound death
  receptors, this binding leads to activation of caspase-8 via TNFR-associated death
  domain (TRADD) and FAS-associated death domain (FADD) proteins. TRADD is required
  for induction of apoptosis in response to TNF-α a binding to TNFR. TRADD and FADD
  activate effector caspases (caspase-3, 6 and 7) causing apoptosis. Moreover, caspase-8
  generates the active truncated form of BID (tBID) that inhibits pro-survival BCL-2-like
  proteins (BCL-2) and engages in the mitochondrial pathway. However, this engagement
  is only apparent in certain cells such as liver cells (type 2 cells), while it is
  absent in type 1 cells, such as thymocytes. Several stimuli such as DNA damaging
  agents, oncogenes, and ER stress stimulate the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway
  via activation of BH3-only family of proteins that inhibit pro-survival BCL-2 like
  proteins. Such inhibition leads to activation of pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK and subsequent
  disruption of the mitochondrial membrane and the release of cytochrome c and SMAC
  (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases). Cytochrome c activates caspase-9
  via APAF1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor 1) that activates effector caspases,
  whereas SMAC blocks the caspase inhibitor protein XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
  protein).
