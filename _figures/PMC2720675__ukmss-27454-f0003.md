caption: 'Primary purine salvage pathways. P,T,C indicate that the pathway or step
  is utilised in Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium respectively. In Toxoplasma,
  the only parasite of the three capable of all of the reactions depicted, the predominant
  route to the purine nucleoside monophosphates is via AdoK. Numbered enzymes are
  as follows: 1, AD; 2, AdoD; 3, PNP; 4, AMP deaminase; 5, adenoylsuccinate synthase
  + adenoylsuccinate lyase; 6, IMPDH; 7, GMP synthetase. Note also the ability of
  P. falciparum PNP to process 5′-methylthioinosine arising from the polyamine biosynthetic
  pathway (see text). Figure adapted from []. For abbreviations of enzymes, see text.'
