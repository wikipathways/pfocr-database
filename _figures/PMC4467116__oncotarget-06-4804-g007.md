caption: When DNA damage stresses occur in middle of the mitosis, ATM-Chk1 pathway
  is activated and Plk1 is dephosphorylated by PP2A and other phosphatases within
  6 hours from release into fresh media [, ]. Then, cells fail to finish-up cytokinesis,
  progress into interphase with 4N-DNA contents, and initiate S-phase by pre-RC formation.
  Although normal cells are ready to initiate DNA replication with pre-RC assembly
  and activation of Cdk2 under the severe DNA damage condition, these cells are blocked
  in DNA replication due to activation of G1-S checkpoint, and finally are removed
  by induction of apoptosis within 24h. However, in the case of p53-inactive or null
  cells, although DNA damage remains in cells, they go through G1 phase with damage,
  and undergo re-replication within 24 hours of incubation for recovery. Since then,
  cells might be adapted in multiploidy, and destined to be a cancer.
