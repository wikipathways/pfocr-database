caption: 'The Nrf2–Keap1 UPS system is the major pathway of Nrf2 regulation. Nrf2
  activity is regulated by various mechanisms such as ubiquitination, post-translational
  modifications, and autoregulation. In the Keap1–Nrf2 UPS system, the Keap1 homodimer
  binds to the ETGE and DLG motifs of the Neh2 domain of Nrf2. Under basal conditions,
  Keap1 binds to Nrf2, is subsequently ubiquitinated by the Keap1–Cul3 complex, and
  is then degraded by the 26S proteasome. Under oxidative stress conditions, oxidation
  of the cysteine residues of Keap1 causes conformational changes in Keap1 and prevents
  Nrf2 ubiquitination, thereby allowing entry of newly synthesized Nrf2 to the nucleus.
  Majority of the Nrf2 agonists, which are electrophilic, covalently bind to Keap1-C151
  cysteine residues, thereby cause conformational changes of Keap1 and prevent Nrf2
  ubiquitination. P62, a ubiquitin-binding protein, competes with Nrf2 for binding
  to Keap1. Accumulation of P62 disrupts the DLG-Keap1 interaction and releases Nrf2.
  In addition, phosphorylation of Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1 and translocates to
  the nucleus. Through heterodimerization with sMAF proteins, Nrf2 binds to cis-acting
  consensus DNA sequences (referred to as AREs). The Nrf2–sMAF complex activates transcription
  of cytoprotective genes. Nrf2 activates expression of its own gene (a process called
  autoregulation), leading to increased production of Nrf2 protein. Abbreviations:
