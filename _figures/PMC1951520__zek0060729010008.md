caption: Model of Dd-STATa suppression by dutA overexpression. Overexpression of dutA
  RNA reverts the expression of various potential Dd-STATa target genes, including
  cudA (), ecmF (), and aslA (), in the parental strain, GFP::STATa(core)::ORF+. In
  Ax2, ecmF and cudA are expressed in the pstA/tip cells, whereas the aslA gene is
  expressed in the pstAB core cells. The expression of the ecmB gene is repressed
  in the pstA and tip cells by Dd-STATa (). Because patterns of cudA(pst) expression
  are complicated, we have not shown the data; nevertheless, cudA(pst)::lacZ expression
  is clearly influenced by dutA overexpression. We have not yet proved that the expression
  of the ecmB gene is influenced by dutA overexpression. Adenylyl cyclase (ACA), phosphodiesterase
  (PDE), and RegA regulate the level of cAMP. Although PKA is activated by cAMP and
  dutA by PKA, dutA expression is independent of cAMP pulses (). Ammonium transporter
  C (AmtC) regulates culmination by repressing histidine kinase (DhkC), which otherwise
  activates RegA via RdeA (). Inversely, AmtA may promote phosphorelay in response
  to high ammonia levels (). Dd-STATa is activated by elevation of extracellular cAMP
  and the signal relayed through the cAMP receptor cAR1 (, ). The protein tyrosine
  phosphatase PTP1 is thought to negatively regulate Dd-STATa (). The tyrosine kinase
  which activates Dd-STATa has yet to be identified. Most likely, overexpression of
  the dutA RNA regulates the activity of the tyrosine kinase but could work as a regulatory
  RNA at other points in the pathway. The effect of overexpression of truncated dutA
  may be dominant negative, and endogenous dutA could repress Dd-STATa activity. Subtypes
  of prestalk cells are illustrated at the bottom.
