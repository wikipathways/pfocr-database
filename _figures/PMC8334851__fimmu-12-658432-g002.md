caption: A schematic diagram of the hypothetical metabolic homeostasis of immune cells
  in testes under physiological or inflammatory condition. In normal testes, immunologically
  tolerant cell phenotypes, comprising with macrophages (Mφ), immature DCs, Tregs,
  and regulatory NK cells, principally rely on OXPHOS and fatty acid oxidation pathway
  to fuel immunosuppressive functions and synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines
  (e.g., IL-10 and TGF-β). However, when testes suffer from pathogens or germ cell
  antigens attack, the number of macrophages and mast cells are markedly increased,
  and the location of these cells partially shift from the interstitium to the tubular
  compartment of infertile men testes. Furthermore, inflammatory phenotype cells such
  as infiltrating macrophages, mature DCs, effector T helper cells, and mast cells
  markedly show a metabolic shift towards the anaerobic glycolytic pathway to meet
  the rapid energy requirements and increased demands for synthesis of proinflammatory
  cytokine, like IL-6, NO and TNF-α. Then this cause ‘cytokine storm’ to disrupt the
  delicate equilibrium between immune privilege and tolerance, which trigger testes
  inflammation and impair normal spermatogenesis, followed by male infertility. Meanwhile,
  Sertoli cells also contribute to the immune-privileged status of mammalian testes,
  especially, maintain immature DCs, and inhibit effector T cells and NK cells via
  paracrine cytokines IDO and PDL-1. Similarly, Leydig cells play an immunoregulatory
  effect on maintenance of regulatory macrophage phenotype and inhibition of T cells
  immune responses through secreting lipid metabolites, such as testosterone, PGE2
  and PGI2. Treg, regulatory T cells; DC, dendritic cell; Th, T helper cell; FAO,
