caption: Changes in the levels of m6A regulators, the methylation levels of resistance-related
  genes, and the expression of autophagy-related genes in tumor tissues may all lead
  to increased or decreased tumor responsiveness to therapeutic drugs. Therefore,
  it may be possible to reverse tumor drug resistance by targeting these targets.
  In the figure, drugs marked in red indicate that the tumor has increased sensitivity
  to them, drugs marked in blue indicate that the tumor has decreased sensitivity
  to them, and drugs marked in green can act on this pathway to reverse the tumor’s
  drug resistance
