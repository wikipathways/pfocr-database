caption: 'Molecular targets and mechanism of action of GA in T2DM. Green arrows and
  red arrows indicated promotion and inhibition, respectively. Description: This figure
  illustrates the molecular mechanisms by which GAexerts therapeutic effects in T2DM.
  GA enhances insulin secretion by inhibiting oxidative stress, apoptosis, and the
  formation of SFRP4. Simultaneously, GA improves insulin resistance by activating
  the PPARγ-PI3K/Akt-GLUT4 signaling pathway, thereby increasing glucose uptake. Additionally,
  GA delays glucose absorption by inhibiting the activities of SGLT1, GLUT2, and α-amylase.
  In the figure, green arrows indicate processes or pathways promoted by GA, while
  red arrows highlight inhibitory effects'
