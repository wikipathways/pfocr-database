caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of microarray data showing predicted activation
  of (A) EGF signaling and (B) PDGF signaling at 24 hr in APAP 300 group vs PHX, based
  on downstream gene expression profile. Positive z-score (absolute z-score > 2 considered
  as significant) represents predicted activation of upstream regulator based on expression
  profile of downstream genes. p-values signifies extent of overlap between set of
  downstream target genes of a upstream regulator in dataset compared to all known
  downstream target genes of that upstream regulator in the reference genome. (red
  shapes: upregulated genes; green shapes: downregulated genes with intensity of color
  reflecting extent of upregulation or downregulation; orange center shape: predicted
  activation)'
