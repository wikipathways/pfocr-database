caption: (A) MSP in B. subtilis and other organisms. Enzyme names are derived from
  Ashida et al.  and Salim et al. . The MSP recycles organic sulfur from MTA, a by-product
  of polyamine synthesis, to methionine. MTA phosphorylase (MtnP) in mammals and yeasts
  catalyzes a one-step reaction to yield MTR-1-P from MTA. In almost all microorganisms,
  plants, and specific protozoa except for T. thermophila, this phosphorylase is replaced
  by two enzymes; MTA nucleosidase (MtnN) and MTR kinase (MtnK). (B) Diversity of
  MSP enzymes among various organisms. In B. subtilis, the MSP consists of eight enzymes
  because it has one enzyme for each reaction. While B. subtilis utilizes two separate
  enzymes (MtnW and MtnX) to catalyze the enolization and dephosphorylation steps,
  in most living organisms including proteobacteria, yeasts, plants, and animals,
  DK-MTP-1-P is converted into HK-MTPenyl-1-P by a bi-functional DK-MTP-1-P enolase/phosphatase
  (MtnC) belonging to the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily. In plants and T. thermophila,
  MtnB is fused with MtnC and MtnD, respectively.
