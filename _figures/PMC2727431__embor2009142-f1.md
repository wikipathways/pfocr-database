caption: 'Various states of pluripotency. mESCs are derived from E3.5 mouse blastocysts
  in the presence of BMP + LIF. Epi-SCs are derived from E5.5–E5.75 post-implantation
  epiblasts in the presence of activin and bFGF. FAB-SCs can be derived from mouse
  blastocysts in the presence of bFGF, activin, BIO and an anti-LIF antibody. Cell-fate
  changes induced by cell-culture conditions are indicated by a red dotted arrow.
  hiPSCs derived in the presence of the four factors alone, and hESCs derived from
  human blastocysts, more closely resemble Epi-SCs (black dotted line). hiPSCs derived
  in the presence of hLIF and the signalling pathway inhibitors PD0325901, A-83-01
  and CHIR99021, resemble mESCs (black dotted line). The developmental potential of
  the cell types is colour coded as follows: dark green depicts fully pluripotent
  cells, light green depicts cells that cannot form chimaeras and yellow depicts cells
  that are not pluripotent (based on embryoid body and teratoma-formation assays).
  The pluripotency of hESCs and hiPSCs can be judged only by embryoid body and teratoma-formation
  assays. The limited differentiation potential of FAB-SCs can be rescued by culturing
  them in the presence of LIF/BMP4 or by overexpression of E-cadherin. Epi-SCs can
  acquire an ESC fate by KLF4 overexpression in conjunction with mESC culture conditions.
  Notably, reprogramming to an earlier developmental state or transdifferentiation—that
  is, cell-fate changes between somatic lineages—seems to require ectopic gene expression,
  whereas forward conversion—that is, ESC to Epi-SC—needs only a change in culture
  conditions. Ab, antibody; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; BIO, 6-bromoindirubin-3-oxime;
  BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; E, embryonic day; Epi-SC, epiblast stem cell; FAB-SC,
  fibroblast growth factor/activin/BIO-stem cell; hESC, human embryonic stem cell;
  hiPSC, human induced pluripotent stem cell; hLIF, human leukaemia inhibitory factor;
