caption: A proposed model of programmed cell death in mod1. A proposed signalling
  pathway, showing the initiation and suppression of the mod1 cell death. A deficiency
  in the fatty acid biosynthesis in chloroplasts leads to the generation of an unidentified
  signal, which induces the formation of ROS through the mitochondrial ETC to initiate
  the PCD process in mod1 plants. Mutations (som3, som42, bir6-2, nMat1-1, and ndufs4-1)
  or chemicals that affect the electron transfer along the ETC to form ROS can suppress
  the phenotypes of mod1 mutant plants, suggesting that the ROS generated in mitochondria
  through ETC, plays an essential role in triggering plant PCD. SOM3 and NDUFS4 are
  nuclear-encoded subunits of complex I, while NAD1, NAD2, NAD4, and NAD7 are mitochondria-encoded
  subunits of complex I. The nMAT1 protein is a nuclear maturase that affects NAD1,
  NAD2 and NAD4 splicing. SOM42 and BIR6 are PPR proteins that affect the splicing
  of NAD7. CSD, Arabidopsis cytosolic Cu/Zn SOD.
