caption: Scheme of linear hydrocarbons degradation in Ulva lactuca. Pathway 3 involves
  alkane monooxygenase (alkB), alcohol dehydrogenase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase that
  oxidize the carboxy terminal methyl group of alkanes to a hydroxyl, aldehyde, and
  carboxylic acid group, thus producing fatty acid that are metabolized by β-oxidation
  pathway to produce acetyl-CoA that enter the TCA cycle.
