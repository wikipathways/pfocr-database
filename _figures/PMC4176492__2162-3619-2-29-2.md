caption: Role of cell cycle regulators in the cellular dormancy (“intrinsic dormancy”)
  mechanism. (a) In the “typical” cell cycle pathway, upregulation of CDK inhibitors,
  such as p21 and p27, can inhibit cells from entering the cell cycle by downregulating
  cyclin/CDK activation. In this scenario, cells can enter into a quiescent state
  (G0). The ubiquitin ligase APC/CDH1 enhances the upregulation of p21/p27 expression
  by increasing the degradation of Skp2 (one of the units that constitute SCF, a p21/p27/p57
  inhibitor). (b) The DREAM complex in the quiescent state (G0). MuvB recruits and
  interacts with p130 (RB-like), E2F4, and dimerization partner (DP), forming the
  DREAM complex. DYRK phosphorylates MuvB and activates the DREAM complex, which triggers
  cells to become quiescent. DYRK also stabilizes p27Kip1 through phosphorylation
  and prevents cells from moving into the G1 phase by reducing the expression of cyclin
  D.
