caption: is a pictorial representation of the intracellular insulin signaling pathway.
  When insulin binds to its receptor, the insulin receptor auto-phosphorylates tyrosines
  in the receptor. Subsequently, kinase activities phosphorylate IRS-1, PI3K and Akt
  which change metabolic processes including glucose uptake and lipid and protein
  metabolism. Interruption of this signaling pathway causes insulin resistance with
  impairment of insulin-stimulated metabolic functions. The insulin signaling pathway
  can be interrupted by chronic kidney disease inducing inflammation, excess angiotensin
  II, metabolic acidosis and several uremic toxins leading to defective metabolism
  of glucose and lipids plus reduced protein synthesis and increased protein degradation
  causing loss of muscle mass.
