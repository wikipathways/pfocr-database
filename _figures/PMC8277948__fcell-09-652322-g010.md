caption: Mechanism diagram. EVs activated CAFs and promoted invasion and metastasis
  of OC cells via the miR-630/KLF6 axis. OC cells-derived EVs could be internalized
  by NFs, so miR-630 carried by EVs could enter into NFs to promote activation of
  CAFs and facilitate invasion and metastasis of OC by targeting KLF6 and activating
  the NF-κB pathway.
