caption: 'Tumor-derived exosomes are secreted via a constitutive/inducible pathway
  that can be activated by a p53-mediated response. Through this pathway (and possibly
  additional ones that remain unknown), exosomes can transport microRNAs into the
  vascular system and regulate important cellular processes such as immunosurveillance,
  apoptosis and angiogenesis. For example: (a) TP53 can induce the activity of TSAP6
  proteins, thereby modulating key functions associated with tumor-derived exosome
  trafficking. Exosomes are generated by reverse budding of the membrane of multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) that fuse with the plasma membrane, causing the release of these particles
  outside the cell. (b) From this moment on, exosomes enter the vascular or lymphatic
  system and circulate freely until they bind to their specific target. (c) The release
  from the cell is possible after the membrane is stimulated by calcium ionophores
  or phorbol esters. Inositol 3-kinase inhibitors can inhibit this process'
