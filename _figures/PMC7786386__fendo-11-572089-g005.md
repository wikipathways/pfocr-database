caption: The p38-mediated adipose tissue secretome. The p38 pathway controls the expression
  or secretion of distinct adipokines in WAT and BAT. In white adipocytes, p38 activation
  is required for the production of IL6, PAI-1, and Wdnm1-like after TNFα stimulation.
  p38 signaling also controls leptin secretion in response to TNFα, playing a positive
  role in the presence of dexamethasone, but an inhibitory role in response to alamandin.
  p38 is also involved in the secretion of IL6 in response to amlexanox and in the
  induction of PAI-1 after β3AR stimulation. In brown adipocytes, p38 controls the
  secretion of FGF21 induced by NE, GW9805, or EPA and directs the secretion of CXCL14
  after cAMP stimulation. cAMP, cyclic AMP; EPA, eicosapentanoic acid; FGF21, fibroblast
  growth factor 21; IL6, interleukin-6; NE, norepinephrine; PAI-1, plasminogen activator
  inhibitor-1; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α.
