caption: Cooperation of Kras-mutant tumor cells with pancreatic stellate cells in
  tumor microenvironment (TME) immunomodulation. Kras-mutant tumor-cell-derived transforming
  growth factor β (TGF-β) induces the activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)
  in the pancreatic TME, resulting in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
  activation and induction of TGF-β transcription and secretion by PSCs. Increased
  TGF-β levels can both promote T regulatory (Treg) recruitment and macrophage M2
  polarization, thereby contributing to immunosuppression in the TME. Similarly, interleukin
  (IL)-6 produced by Kras-mutant tumor cells binds to IL-6 receptors on PSCs, resulting
  in intracellular signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation
  and IL-6 transcription and secretion into the TME. High IL-6 levels amplify the
  recruitment and M2 polarization of macrophages, thereby promoting tumor growth.
  Although the mechanism of transcriptional induction of IL-10, granulocyte macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), CXCL10, and CXCL12 by PSCs has not been directly
  addressed, their secretion by PSCs cooperates with IL-10, GM-CSF, CXCL10, and CXCL12
  derived from Kras-mutant tumor cells to amplify Treg cell recruitment (CXCL10),
  dampen CD8+ T-cell responses (CXCL12), or promote macrophage M2 polarization (IL-10,
  GM-CSF) in the pancreatic TME. NF-κB, Nuclear factor κB.
