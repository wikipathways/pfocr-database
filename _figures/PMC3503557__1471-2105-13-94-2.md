caption: Protein network and pathway structure for biologically informative priors
  in the synthetic response data study. Responses were generated from published phospho-proteomic
  data [] consisting of 11 proteins and 853 samples (baseline data only). Network
  structure shown here is based on that given in Sachs et al.[] and reflects current
  knowledge of signalling interactions. Proteins were divided into four pathways,
  denoted by node colours red, blue, green and yellow. The grey nodes are each members
  of all four pathways.
