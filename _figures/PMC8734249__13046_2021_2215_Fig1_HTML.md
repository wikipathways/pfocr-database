caption: The CD70-CD27 axis in hematopoiesis and oncology. During normal hematopoietic
  development, expression of CD70 is tightly regulated and plays a role in priming,
  survival and differentiation for a subset of immune cells through NF-κB and c-Jun
  pathway activation via TRAF 2/5 leading. Alternatively, apoptosis can be induced
  by activating the caspase pathway via Siva. Reverse CD70 signaling can activate
  PI3K/Akt and MEK signaling pathways leading to regulation of cell expansion, differentiation
  and effector functions. In oncology CD70 and CD27 are frequently co-expressed on
  malignant cells which can deliver proliferation signals and a growth advantage to
  the malignant cells. Apart from improved growth, dysregulation of the axis can provide
  other tumor promoting effects via different signaling pathways. Figure created with
