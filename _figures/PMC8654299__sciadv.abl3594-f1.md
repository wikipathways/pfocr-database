caption: 'The inset shows coexpression network, which was reconstituted from the top
  1000 coexpressed genes from ATTED-II (http://atted.jp/) using Arabidopsis CoQ biosynthetic
  genes Coq1 (At2g34630), Coq2 (At4g23660), Coq3 (At2g30920), Coq4 (At2g03690), Coq5
  (At5g57300), Coq6 (At3g24200), Coq8 (At4g01660), Coq9 (At1g19140), Coq10 (At4g17650),
  Coq11A (At5g10730), and Coq11B (At5g15910) as queries. The network was drawn on
  the basis of rank of correlation. The top 100, top 101 to 500, and top 501 to 1000
  coexpressed genes from every gene were used as bold, normal, and thin edges, respectively.
