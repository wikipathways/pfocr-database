caption: Potential pathways and novel targets of TRD. (1) Inflammation increases levels
  of prostaglandins leading to increased cytokine levels and microglial activation
  leading to ROS and RNS formation which leads to neurotoxicity, decreased neuroplascticity,
  decreased BDNF levels and glutamate modulation. Cytokine production also leads to
  IDO activation, which in turn converts tryptophan to its catabolites and decreases
  serotonin (5-HT) levels. HPA axis activation also activates TDO, which has the same
  enzymatic effect of IDO. NSAIDS and O3PUFA can prevent the production of PGE2 thereby
  inhibiting this inflammatory-mood pathway. Similarly, infliximab can stop the pathway
  at the level of TNF-alpha. Minocycline can also prevent inflammation and oxidative
  stress. NAC can prevent oxidative stress and thus prevent the complications of ROS
  and RNS production. Metyrapone can prevent the production of cortisol thereby preventing
  TDO activation and decreasing the risk of insulin resistance. (2) Metabolic dysfunction
  can lead to insulin resistance and thus decreased transport of insulin across the
  blood brain barrier leading to decreased central levels of insulin and decreased
  neuronal trophic effects of insulin. GLP-1 or DPP-IV inhibitors or other insulin
  sensitizers such a TZDs (ex. Pioglitazone) can prevent this effect, thereby increasing
  the trophic effects of insulin and increasing the levels of intracellular glucose
  via insulin dependent uptake of glucose at Glut4 transporters. Intranasal insulin
  can also have this direct effect. (3) Glutamate is produced in the pre-synaptic
  neuron and reuptake occurs in the surrounding glia cell which converts glutamate
  to glutamine by glutamine synthetase and transports glutamine back to the pre-synaptic
  neuron where it is converted back to glutamate via the action of glutaminase. Increased
  synaptic glutamate levels and inhibition of NMDA by ketamine can lead to increased
  influx of sodium via AMPA and calcium via voltage gated calcium channels (VG CC)
  leading to PI3K and MAPK/ERK activation which activates mTOR, thus inhibiting 4E-BP,
  preventing the inhibition of BDNF production and ultimately leading to increase
  neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. AMPA may be directly activated by Org 26576 having
  a similar effect.
