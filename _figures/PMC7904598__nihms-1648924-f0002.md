caption: EVs can transport different types of cargo, including DNA, RNA, receptors
  and other proteins. Both astrocytes and glioblastoma cells shed EVs, carrying various
  cargoes as illustrated in the schematic. Moreover, EVs that originate from glioblastoma
  cells contain CD147, which increases MMP expression in astrocytes and in turn contributes
  to the breakdown of the ECM, leading to enhanced invasion of glioblastoma cells.
  Gfap mRNA is upregulated in astrocytes, indicating a conversion to reactive astrocytes
  in the context of glioblastoma. Moreover, the MYC signaling pathway, an oncogene,
  is activated in astrocytes, whereas TP53, a tumor suppressor gene is downregulated
  upon glioblastoma-derived EV uptake, suggesting that astrocytes transform to tumor-like
  cells. Both mTOR and p70S6K signaling pathways, critical for translational regulation,
  and initiation and control of protein synthesis, are upregulated in astrocytes as
  a result of exposure to glioblastoma-derived EVs. Concurrently, EVs shed by astrocytes
  contain multiple PTEN targeting miRNAs, including miR-19b and miR-20a, leading to
  a decrease in PTEN expression in the tumor cells, which enhances tumor cell proliferation.
  In addition, astrocytes induce an upregulation of MMP14 in glioblastoma cells which
  promotes ECM degradation and tumor cell migration. Taken together, glioblastoma
  cells are able to alter astrocytes by the release of EVs, which change the phenotype
  of astrocytes to become supportive of tumor progression. The “transformed” astrocytes
  shed EVs supporting glioblastoma cells instead of defending the CNS.
