caption: 'Proposed model for the actions of H2O2 as a signaling molecule and substrate
  for lignification activated upon Cd exposure. Glutathione depletion is an immediate
  effect of Cd exposure (1). This depletion is followed by an upregulation of GSH
  biosynthesis (2). Hydrogen peroxide has been implied as signaling molecule regulating
  this upregulation (3). Glutathione is important for H2O2 homeostasis and a key component
  in the transcriptional activation of PAL (4). Enzymes further downstream in the
  lignin biosynthesis pathway were shown to be activated by H2O2 (5), although it
  is currently not known whether GSH is able to transcriptionally activate them as
  well. Furthermore, H2O2 leads to increased biosynthesis of and is a key substrate
  for lignifying PODs (6), the last step in lignification as an effective defense
  response to Cd (7). The levels of H2O2 required to activate monolignol biosynthesis
  transcription (5) or provide sufficient substrate for monolignol oxidation by class
  III PODs (6), are maintained by APX (8). In addition to being an essential substrate
  of APX, AsA is able to scavenge radicalized monolignols (9), with a correlation
  between lower or more oxidized pools of AsA and decreased lignification. Abbreviations:
  AsA, ascorbate; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; C3H, coumarate 3-hydroxylase; C4H, cinnamate
  4-hydroxylase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase;
