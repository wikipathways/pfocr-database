caption: A. Annotated pNTCUltra-1 restriction map. Critical features such as the trpA
  terminator, dual terminator site from pNTCUltra1-term+ and functional domains in
  the origin (PAS-BL, RNAII promoter, RNase H cleavage site) are indicated. B. Plasmid
  DNA replication steps are shown, with critical gene products indicated. For the
  leading strand, a RNA polymerase transcript (RNAII) forms an R-loop (RNA DNA hybrid)
  that is cleaved by RNase H, the resulting 3′ OH serving as a primer for DNA polymerase
  I (Pol I) DNA synthesis. DNA synthesis then converts to DNA Pol III about 400 bp
  downstream of the origin. In pBR322, Pol III leading strand synthesis may be initiated
  by primosomal assembly at either phiX174 type (at PAS-BH, a leading strand primosomal
  assembly site; ) or dnaA type (at dnaA binding sites within the origin; ) assembly
  sites. PAS-BH is deleted in pUC origin vectors. Replication of the leading strand
  exposes a phiX174 type primosome assembly site on the lagging strand (PAS-BL), which
  binds priA, which, in turn, recruits the remaining proteins to form the preprimosome
  [priB, dnaT, recruits dnaB (delivered by dnaC)], which then also recruits primase
  (dnaG), which then makes a short RNA substrate for DNA polymerase III. PriC may
  also be involved in this pathway. Lagging strand replication initiated at PAS-BL
  terminates at a termination site (ter) within the origin. Leading strand synthesis,
  with dnaB/dnaC bound to polIII generating lagging strand Okazaki fragments every
  1–2 kb, proceeds around the plasmid, also stopping at the ter site. DNA Pol I and
  DNA ligase are required after Pol III replication to remove primers and seal nicks,
  respectively. DNA gyrase then negatively supercoils the resultant covalently closed
  circular (CCC) plasmid. Plasmid replication is different than chromosomal replication,
  wherein initial replication is set by OriC priming initiated with dnaA (reviewed
  in ).

  description: A. Annotated pNTCUltra-1 restriction map. Critical features such as

    For the leading strand, a RNA polymerase transcript (RNAII) forms an R-loop (RNA
    DNA hybrid) that is cleaved by RNase H, the resulting 3′ OH serving as a primer
    for DNA polymerase I (Pol I) DNA synthesis. DNA synthesis then converts to DNA
    Pol III about 400 bp downstream of the origin. In pBR322, Pol III leading strand
    synthesis may be initiated by primosomal assembly at either phiX174 type (at PAS-BH,
    a leading strand primosomal assembly site; ) or dnaA type (at dnaA binding sites

    Replication of the leading strand exposes a phiX174 type primosome assembly site
    on the lagging strand (PAS-BL), which binds priA, which, in turn, recruits the
