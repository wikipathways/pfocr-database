caption: 'BTN3A interaction patterns and signaling pathways. BTN3A-dependent co-stimulatory
  mechanisms: (1) engagement of BTN3A with its putative ligand on APC and/or (2) treatment
  of BTN3A with CD277 mAb 20.1 provides a co-stimulatory T cell activation signal
  that induces production of IL-2 and IFNγ as well as T cell proliferation via the
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. BTN3A-dependent co-inhibitory mechanisms; (3) interaction
  of BTN3A with a specific mAb 232.5 suppresses c-FLIP expression. The cellular inhibitory
  protein type FLICE-like (c-FLIP) is well-known to promote the maturation and survival
  of T cells through interaction with pro-caspase, which activates the activation
  cascade ERK/NF-κB. The inhibition of c-FLIP expression by BTN3A triggers an inhibiting
  signal that interferes with the production of IFNγ, IL-4, and the proliferation
  of T cells. (4) BTN3A1 binds the N-mannosylated residues of CD45 and, thus, elicits
  the inhibition of the TCR signal on T cells. CD45 is well recognized to play a key
  role in T cell activation through the TCR signaling pathway. The BTN3A1 and BTN3A2
  provide differential regulation of NKp30-induced IFNγ production: (5) The co-engagement
  of BTN3A1 with NKp30 after treatment with anti-NKp30 mAb modulates the NKp30-induced
  IFN-γ production, (6) whereas the lack of B30.2 domain in the BTN3A2 structure impair
  the co-engagement of BTN3A2 with NKp30 and thus lead to the attenuation of the NKp30-induced
  IFN-γ production. LSECtin on tumor-associated macrophages improves the stemness
  of tumor cells through interaction with BTN3A receptor: (7) BTN3A1/2 Interaction
  with LSECtin in tumor cells actives the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, which promotes
  cancer cell survival, invasion, and proliferation.'
