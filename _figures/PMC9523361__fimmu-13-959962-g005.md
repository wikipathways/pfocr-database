caption: Novel aspects of Rex and its effects on cellular pathways; (A)The interactome
  analysis between Rex and human cellular proteins revealed that Rex interacts with
  proteins involved in cellular pathways from transcription to translation (arrows
  in deep purple). Especially, Rex shows interactions with many ribosomal proteins,
  indicating a possible involvement of Rex in the host translational pathway. (B)
  Rex also interacts with proteins involved in immune response and signaling pathways
  (arrows in deep purple), suggesting that Rex may alter T cell functions and phenotypes
  by affecting these intracellular pathways (arrows in light purple). (C) Rex-overexpressing
  T cells showed alterations in a wide range of gene expression profiles (arrows in
  light purple). In the Rex expressing cells, the genes involved in the regulation
  of gene expression, cell cycle, and viral infection response are upregulated, while
  those involved in the humoral immune response and chemokine signaling pathway are
  downregulated. In addition, changes in splicing patterns were observed in various
  mRNAs in Rex expressing T cells (arrows in light purple). Particularly, exon inclusion
  in mRNAs encoding EGF-like domains and exon skipping in mRNAs encoding Ig-like domains
  are observed in high frequencies. In addition, the expression levels of natural
  NMD target mRNAs involved in various signaling pathways were elevated in Rex expressing
  T cells (arrows in light purple), possibly because of the NMD inhibitory function
  of Rex. Generated using Servier Medical Art, provided by Servier, licensed under
