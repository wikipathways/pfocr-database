caption: (A) In yeast, mitotic exit requires Nud1 phosphorylation by Cdc15. This essential
  step causes recruitment of the Dbf2–Mob1 kinase complex to spindle pole bodies,
  where it is activated by Cdc15 (adapted from []). (B) In mammalian cells, Cdk1–cyclinB
  phosphorylates the AKAP gravin during the cell cycle, and allows phosphorylation-dependent
  binding of Plk1. Active Plk1 recruitment in the complex is then able to locally
  phosphorylate targets that are crucial for cell-cycle progression. (C) A third example
  of phosphorylation-dependent interactions comes from scaffolding in the Wnt signaling
  pathway. Axin is a scaffolding protein that participates in both β-catenin ‘stabilization
  complexes’ and β-catenin ‘destruction’ complexes. The formation of these complexes
  is dependent on phosphorylation–dephosphorylation cycles that are based on the balance
  between GSK3β and PP1cγ (PP1) activities (adapted from []).
