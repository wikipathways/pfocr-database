caption: 'Adrenal steroidogenesis. Enzymes are boxed with dotted lines extending to
  arrows denoting each enzymatic conversion; 2 enzymes, CYP11B2 and CYP17, catalyze
  several successive enzymatic conversions. Accessory proteins required for activity
  of cytochrome P450 enzymes are shown next to each such enzyme: POR, P450 oxidoreductase,
  required by CYP enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum; FDXR/FDX1, ferredoxin reductase
  and ferredoxin, required by mitochondrial CYP enzymes. Cytochrome B5 (CYP5A) is
  required for full 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17A1. There are 2 11β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase isozymes; HSD11B1, expressed mainly in the liver, catalyzes reduction
  (eg, cortisone to cortisol), whereas HSD11B2, expressed mainly in the kidney, catalyzes
  oxidation (eg, cortisol to cortisone). The steps affected by 21OHD, including steroids
  secreted in increased amounts in this disease, are denoted by red lines and red
  lettering. Steps taking place only in the adrenal glands are in unshaded boxes;
  steps taking place partly or predominantly outside the adrenal cortex are denoted
  by shaded boxes. Planar structures of cholesterol, aldosterone, cortisol, and testosterone
  are illustrated; the position of the 11-oxo (11-keto) group in 11-ketotestosterone
  is illustrated in green. Colored rectangles indicate the following: gray, early
  steps of steroidogenesis common to all zones of the cortex; orange, steps in the
  zona glomerulosa leading to aldosterone; blue, steps in the zona fasciculata leading
  to cortisol; magenta; steps in the zona reticularis and extra-adrenal tissues leading
  to androgens; purple, the “backdoor” or alternate pathway from 17-OH progesterone
  to dihydrotestosterone (for clarity, the alternative pathway from progesterone is
  not shown); green, conversions leading to 11-oxo androgens.'
