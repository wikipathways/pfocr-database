caption: The cAMP-PKA signaling pathway is involved in conidial germination, appressorium
  penetration and invasive hyphae formation. The MAPK CoMekk1–Cmk1 signaling pathway
  is involved in conidial germination and appressorium formation. The CoRas2 localization
  pattern in the coira1 mutant was similar to that in DARS2. Moreover, BiFC assays
  supported that CoIra1 interacted with CoRas2 in the plasma membrane. Therefore,
  CoIra1 negatively regulates CoRas2. The coira1 mutant and DARS2 significantly induced
  abnormal appressorium formation and the frequency of abnormal appressorium formation
  in iDNRS2 was lower compared with that in the coira1 mutant. Moreover, intracellular
  cAMP levels in the coira1 mutant and DARS2 was high compared with those in the wild
  type. Therefore, CoIra1 regulates cAMP-PKA signaling pathway through CoRas2. The
  conidia of the coras2 mutant failed to germinate, whereas DRS2/DAMK1 restored the
  phenotype of the coras2 mutant. Therefore, CoRas2 is an upstream regulator of the
  MAPK CoMekk1–Cmk1 signaling pathway. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of MAPK
  Cmk1 in the coras2 mutant was higher compared with that in the wild-type, although
  CoRas2 is an upstream regulator of CoMekk1–Cmk1. Therefore, that CoIra1 may be a
  key factor for regulating the crosstalk between the cAMP–PKA and CoMekk1–Cmk1 MAPK
  signaling pathway through CoRas2. Intracellular cAMP levels in DARS1 were higher
  compared with those in the wild-type in vegetative hyphae. However, DARS1 showed
  lower sensitivity to exogenous cAMP in appressorium development compared with DARS2.
  Moreover, the intensity of pathogenesis in DARS1 was similar to that in the wild-type.
  Therefore, CoRas1 could be involved in the cAMP–PKA signaling pathway in vegetative
  hyphae but not during infection related morphogenesis.
