caption: Perturbation of neural Ca2+ homeostasis under ischemic conditions. Neuronal
  and glial cell death is primarily mediated by oxidative stress and excess glutamate.
  Ca2+ entry through NMDAR mainly triggers the excitotoxic Ca2+ overload. As a result,
  calpains are activated, which inactivate by cleavage both NCX3 and PMCA. This precludes
  the capability to remove accumulated Ca2+. High [Ca2+]i induces stimulation of nNOS,
  which leads to production of ONOO•− and to the feedforward activation of TRPM7 currents.
  The decrease in [Ca2+] in the extracellular space disinhibits Ca2+-sensing channels,
  such as KCa3.1, leading to a further membrane depolarization. As a result of high
  [Ca2+]i, excessive rise of intramitochondrial Ca2+ triggers the opening of the mPTP.
  Mitochondria also release Ca2+via NCXmito. This induces a depletion of ATP. Under
  ischemic conditions, the mode of operation of NCXmito is reverted. Then, the NCXmito
  acts as an influx pathway for Ca2+ into the mitochondrial matrix. ROS induce a high
  activity response of RyR2 and thus amplify the increase of [Ca2+]i. (For interpretation
