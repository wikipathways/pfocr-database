caption: Principle auxin metabolic pathways in seed plants. Auxin (indole-3-acetic
  acid, IAA) is synthesized from tryptophan (Trp) via indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA),
  and undergoes irreversible catabolism via oxindole-3-acetic acid (oxIAA). Auxin
  can be reversibly conjugated to a wide variety of compounds, generally considered
  to be storage forms of IAA. Conjugation with aspartic acid to make indole-3-acetyl
  aspartic acid (IAAsp) is irreversible, so this constitutes a second catabolic pathway.
  The figure also shows reversible conversion to indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), an auxin-like
  compound with a role in adventitious root formation. Blue boxes indicate the name
  of the gene family responsible for each pathway. Pink ellipses are added for clarity,
  to indicate the portion of each chemical structure that differs from IAA.
