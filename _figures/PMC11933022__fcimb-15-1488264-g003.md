caption: 'Model of TMAO effect on AKI: The figure mainly shows that TMAO can stimulate
  NLRP3 in macrophages and stimulate T cell differentiation, produce a variety of
  inflammatory factors, and aggravate the inflammatory response. At the same time,
  by inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating PI3K/Akt/NF-κB
  signaling pathway, the imbalance of autophagy process can lead to increased death
  of renal tubular epithelial cells and damage kidney function. Secondly, it can affect
  the function of some transporters, such as organic anion transporters (OATs) and
  organic cationic transporters (OCTs), leading to the accumulation of waste in the
  cell, further aggravating cell damage and inflammatory reaction'
