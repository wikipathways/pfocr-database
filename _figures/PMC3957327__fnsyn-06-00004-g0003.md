caption: 'Crosstalk between signaling pathways implicated in pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric
  diseases. When synaptogenic growth factors bind to their respective receptors, they
  can trigger a number of intracellular signaling cascades. Depicted here are the
  PLC/IP3/CAMK pathway, the MAPK/ERK pathway, and the PI3K/Akt pathway. Although there
  are a number of downstream effectors of each pathway, they may converge on the CREB
  transcription factor and gene expression, including expression of genes that modify
  neuronal activity, such as BDNF and the L-type VGCC. Although only one cell is depicted
  here, the model could apply to a presynaptic or postsynaptic cell. Abbreviations
  used: β-cat, β-catenin; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CaM, calmodulin;
  CaMKII, calmodulin-dependent kinase II; CREB, calcium response element binding protein;
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FGF, fibroblast
  growth factor; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; IGF, insulin-like growth factor;
  IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K,
  phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; TrkB, tyrosine receptor kinase
  B; VGCC, voltage-gated calcium channel.'
