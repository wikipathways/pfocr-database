caption: 'Metabolic scheme. Carbon flow from [U-13C]-glucose through glycolysis, Krebs
  cycle, PPP, pyruvate carboxylation, malate/Asp shuttle, and synthesis of GSH and
  pyrimidine nucleotides as discussed in the text. Also shown are the expected 13C
  isotopomers of key metabolites in this network. Excretion of lactate and Ala into
  serum is part of the alanine and Cori cycles. Solid oval represents the plasma membrane
  and the dashed oval represents the mitochondrial space. Double-headed arrows: exchange
  or reversible processes. The label patterns arise from [U-13C]-glucose. Open circles:
  12C; filled circles: 13C. Glc = glucose, G6P = glucose-6-phosphate, Rib = nucleotide
  ribose, DHAP, GAP = dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, PEP
  = phosphoenolpyruvate, Pyr = pyruvate, Lac = lactate, Cit = citrate, 2 = OG = 2-oxoglutarate,
  Mal = malate, OAA = oxalacetate, U = uracil base. Critical enzymes are shown in
  cyan. HK= hexokinase (entry to glycolysis), G6PDH = glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (entry to the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway), TK, TA transketolase
  and transaldolase (non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway), PK = pyruvate kinase,
  PDH = pyruvate dehydrogenase, PC = pyruvate carboxylase, AAT = aspartate amino transferase,
  MDH = malate dehydrogenase, ME = malic enzyme. Glutaminolysis is the pathway from
  Gln to pyruvate via ME, leading to unlabeled malate, Asp, Ala and lactate. Where
  two patterns are shown in the Krebs'' cycle intermediates, this is due to the scrambling
  at the succinate step (first turn only). For U and OAA, the labeling from PC activity
  gives rise to a third labeling pattern, shown in red. The isotopomer pattern for
  U shows the three ring carbons (4,5,6) derived from Asp. The exchange of [13C-1,2,3]-Asp
  via the malate/Asp shuttle into the cytosol leads to the synthesis of [13C-1,2,3]-malate.'
