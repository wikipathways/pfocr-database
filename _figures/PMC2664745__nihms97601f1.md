caption: 'N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function can be positively regulated
  by α calcium calmodulin kinase (αCaMKII) phosphorylation and by the transient activation
  of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) through the positive regulator p25. Transport
  of the NR2B subunit to synaptic sites can be increased by overexpressing the motor
  protein KIF17. Calpain, possibly modulated by Cdk5, downregulates NR2B by proteolysis.
  The β3 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) and the nociceptin receptor
  ORL1 also negatively regulate NMDAR expression or function by unknown mechanisms.
  Calcium influx through NMDARs activates αCaMKII, which in turn positively regulates
  NMDAR and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)
  function, contributing to the induction and expression of long-term potentiation
  (LTP), respectively. In addition, neuronal calcium concentration can be regulated
  by Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCXs), which extrude Ca2+ from neurons. Calcium/calmodulin
  (CaM) activates downstream kinases and phosphatases: it activates adenylyl cyclase
  (AC) to produce cAMP, which activates protein kinase A (PKA) and eventually regulates
  cyclic-AMP response-element-binding protein (CREB) activity in the nucleus. By phosphorylating
  inhibitor-1 (I-1), PKA can antagonize the action of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1),
  which is activated by the calcium/CaM-activated phosphatase calcineurin (CN). CaM
  also activates calcium CaM kinase kinase (CaMKK), which in turn activates calcium/CaM
  kinase IV (CaMKIV), another positive regulator of transcription. Activation of TrkB
  by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) triggers the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and ultimately regulates transcription. Sharp and
  blunted arrows represent positive and negative regulation, respectively. tPA/PS,
  tissue-type plasminogen activator/plasmin; PDE, phosphodiesterase.'
