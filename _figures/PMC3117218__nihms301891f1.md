caption: A) Spatial organization is necessary to achieve high fidelity intracellular
  information transfer. Proteins can be assembled into specific complexes by compartmentalization
  (organelle targeting), membrane localization, and by scaffold proteins. B) Intracellular
  signaling pathways often use scaffold proteins. Canonical examples include Ste5,
  essential to the yeast mating MAPK pathway, and KSR, which directs signaling in
  the mammalian Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway. C) Scaffold proteins also play an important
  role in organizing cell-cell communication junctions, such as neuronal synapses.
  The PDZ scaffold, PSD-95, controls NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptor targeting to
  the synapse. D) Assembly line processes such as protein folding use scaffold proteins.
  The HOP protein promotes transfer of unfolded proteins between Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones.
