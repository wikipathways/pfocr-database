caption: 'Model showing plasma membrane NKCC1 and mitochondrial respiration: a link
  through leucine? Aerobic respiration utilizes the KREBS cycle and the electron transport
  chain. Through the consumption of oxygen (O2) and NADH (produced by the KREBS/TCA
  cycle), complexes I–IV produces a proton (H+) gradient in the inner membrane of
  the mitochondria, which is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. The KREBS or
  TCA cycle is powered by pyruvate which comes from glucose through the process of
  glycolysis. The glucose comes from uptake at the plasma membrane through a Na+-driven
  glucose transporter. Glucose transport is facilitated by activation of the IGF-R
  receptor by insulin and stimulation of the IRS1/PI3K/AKT pathway. AKT also stimulates
  mTORC1, which stimulates protein translation, thereby facilitating cell growth and
  proliferation. mTORC1 is also stimulated by leucine which enters cells through the
  LAT1 transporter – which requires interaction with NKCC1. Note that mitochondrial
  respiration also produces hydrogen peroxide (through complexes I–IV and through
  SOD2), which can be converted to water by peroxidases.'
