caption: Schematic representation of the sensory, protective, and regulatory mechanisms
  triggered by environmental low pH conditions in E. coli (A) and L. monocytogenes
  (B). Red arrows represent upregulated (+) or downregulated (−) gene expression modulated
  by either periplasmic or cytoplasmic acidic pH. Decarboxylation and deamination
  reactions (represented by blue arrows) consume a proton (H+) and produce CO2, or
  produce ammonia (NH3), respectively. Ammonia can accept protons and yield ammonium
  (NH4+), thus contributing to pH homeostasis. (A) EvgS is thought to act as the periplasmic
  acidic pH sensor in E. coli and is responsible for the initiation of a complex signal
  transduction pathway that activates GadE and ultimately results in the upregulation
  of acid tolerance mechanisms. (B) It is hypothesized that the stressosome acts as
  the cytoplasmic pH sensor in L. monocytogenes and is responsible for the initiation
  of a signal transduction pathway that results in the release of σB and upregulation
  of the general stress response regulon (GSR).
