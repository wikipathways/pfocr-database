caption: A diagram of the tetrandrine’s anti-survival and pro-apoptotic mechanisms
  (signaling pathways) in SW872 cells. Tetrandrine may activate the intrinsic (caspase-9/3-dependent)
  apoptotic pathway, which is crucial for the drug’s apoptosis-inducing and growth-suppressive
  effects on SW872 cells. In addition, tetrandrine may further inhibit STAT-3 and
  down-regulate XIAP, which may also confer the drug’s anti-survival and probably
  pro-apoptotic properties. Moreover, tetrandrine may induce the GRP78/ATF-4/eIF-2α-dependent
  ER stress and/or global translational inhibition, which could further contribute
  to the drug’s anti-survival and pro-apoptotic effects on SW872 cells.
