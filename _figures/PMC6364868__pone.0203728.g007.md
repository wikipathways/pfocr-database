caption: 'The model is divided into genes expressed in leaves (green background) and
  those expressed in the shoot apical meristem (yellow background). Genes tested in
  this study are framed by a blue outline. In the leaves, three pathways are depicted:
  aging, photoperiod and autonomous. The photoperiod pathway is represented by the
  module ZmCCT10 (rice Ghd7)—ZmEhd1–ZCN8/7/12/15 (FT-like genes) which is conserved
  in other short-day monocots, rice and sorghum. ZmCCT10 is likely a repressor of
  the flowering activator ZmEhd1 gene which is a homolog of rice Ehd1 and sorghum
  SbEhd1. ZmCCT10 is not expressed under inductive SDs releasing ZmEhd1 from repression
  and activating the FT-like ZCN8/7/12/15 genes. ZmCCT10 is expressed under non-inductive
  LDs leading to repression of the FT-like ZCN8/7/12/15genes which occurs directly
  or indirectly via repression of ZmEhd1. However, the FT-like ZCN14 gene is not repressed
  by ZmCCT10 and may be placed in the autonomous pathway. In the aging pathway, ZmRap2.7
  represses flowering via suppression of ZmEhd1 or ZCN8/7 genes. In the autonomous
  pathway, ID1 is required for activation of ZCN8/7 and possibly ZmEhd1 or other upstream
  regulators of ZCN8/7. Once transported to the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the florigenic
  ZCN8/7proteins interact with DLF1 forming the florigen activation complex (FAC,
  yellow oval). The florigen-antagonistic protein ZCN2 may compete with ZCN8/7 in
  the FAC leading to delayed flowering. Expression of DFL1 and ZCN2 is independent
  of the photoperiod pathway. Formation of the FAC in the SAM induces transcription
  of the AP1-like MADS box meristem identity genes ZAP1, ZMM4 and ZMM15 marking the
  onset of inflorescence specification. The ZFL1/2 genes are positioned downstream
  of the AP1-like genes.'
