caption: A. VEGF in the circulation binds to VEGFR-2 expressed on endothelial cells,
  triggering the production of NO by activation of eNOS. NO acts in a paracrine fashion
  on adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), where it activates soluble guanylate
  cyclase (sGC) to produce cGMP, which causes VSMC relaxation. B. Activation of VEGFR-2
  on endothelial cells activates multiple downstream signaling pathways, including
  both SRC and PI3k. This results in activation of the kinase Akt, which directly
  phosphorylates and activates eNOS. Resulting NO binds to sGC in adjacent VSMC, increasing
  cGMP and causing vasodilation mediated by cGMP-dependent kinases (not shown). VEGFR-2
  activation also activates phospholipase C (PLC), which triggers a signaling cascade
  resulting in the transcriptional activation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which produces
  vasodilatory prostacyclin (PGI2), contributing to the vasodilatory reponse.
