caption: CGRPergic neurotransmission at the vascular level. (a) CGRPergic sensory
  neurons play an important role in the modulation of vascular tone. Indeed, CGRP
  (from perivascular sensory neurons) can be released from primary afferent fibers.
  Certainly, CGRP can be also released after activation of TRPV1 channels by capsaicin;
  if this stimulation is strong enough, an antidromic conduction may be induced and
  probably also an axonal reflex. Furthermore, a strong stimulus in the periphery
  could reach the spinal dorsal horn by PAF and consequently could be sent to supraspinal
  sites. (b) The CGRP release induced by antidromic stimulation, axonal reflex, or
  activation of TRPV1 channels can be modulated by several heteroreceptors. Most of
  the heteroreceptors are described as GPCR. Certainly, prejunctional activation of
  α 2A/2C-adrenoceptors, 5-HT1B/1F, D2-like, H3, and probably Y1/2 receptors inhibits
  the CGRPergic neurotransmission in the systemic vasculature. These heteroreceptors
  are coupled to G i/o proteins and activation of this system is classically related
  to inhibition of neurotransmitter release. It is interesting to note that activation
  of α 2A/2C-adrenoceptors and Y1/2 receptors supports the role of the sympathetic
  nerves modulating CGRPergic transmission by noradrenaline and neuropeptide Y (a
  cotransmitter of sympathetic nerves). (c) At cellular level, the responses to CGRP
  are mainly mediated by an increase in cAMP by activation of CGRP receptors coupled
  to Gsα proteins. This atypical receptor belongs to the metabotropic GPCR superfamily
  and to be functional the CGRP receptor are composed of tree proteins forming a CRLR-RAMP1-RCP
  complex. At vascular level, the increase in cAMP induces vasorelaxation by a direct
  (vascular smooth muscle cell) and indirect (K+ATP channels) effect. Furthermore,
  the NOS pathway can be activated. In addition, recruitment of several intracellular
  signaling involving ERKs or CREBs may be related to the fact that CGRP has protective
  properties by attenuation of vascular smooth muscle proliferation, hyperplasia inhibition,
  and stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation. AC, adenylyl cyclase; cAMP, cyclic
