caption: A model of flowering time regulation in response to different ambient temperatures.
  Changes in ambient temperature cause alterations in the expression of miR156, which
  negatively regulates SPL3. The SPL3 protein directly binds to FT to regulate ambient
  temperature-responsive flowering. Although FUL is another direct target of SPL3
  (; ), it is unlikely to play an important role in ambient temperature-responsive
  flowering but is possibly important in age-dependent flowering. SPL9 may act redundantly
  with SPL3 in the regulation of ambient temperature-responsive flowering (see “Discussion”).
  The miR156-SPL3 module and the miR172 pathway may act in parallel, although the
  genetic relationship between the miR156-SPL3 module and the target genes of miR172
  is not clear. Arrows represent promotion effects, whereas T-bars indicate repression
  effects. Dotted lines indicate unclear interactions.
