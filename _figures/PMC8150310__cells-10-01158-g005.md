caption: Representative scheme descending analgesic control in an experimental Parkinson’s
  disease (ePD) model comparing animals treated with motor cortex stimulation (MCS)
  or sham. The striatal 6-OHDA, beyond the progressive dopaminergic loss in the nigrostriatal
  pathway, decreased the serotonin immunoreactivity in the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM).
  This serotonergic nucleus projects to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (DHSC)
  to control the ascendant nociceptive inputs. However, probably due to loss of serotonergic
  efferences in the spinal cord, the ePD induced an increase in neuronal activation,
  and increased immunoreactivity of astrocytes and microglial hyperplasia and hypertrophy
  in the DHSC, a phenomenon responsible for the maintenance of hypernociception pain.
  The MCS was able, not only to restore, but also increase the serotonin immunoreactivity
  in the NRM, without change in dopamine loss induced by ePD. In addition, the MCS
  decreased the neuronal activation pattern and the immunoreactivity of astrocytes
  in the DHSC, without interfering with the ePD-induced microglial hyperplasia and
  hypertrophy. Taken together, we suggest that MCS-induced analgesia is partially
  due to restoration of the descending serotonergic pathway resulting in the increase
  in spinal serotonin release, with consequent inhibition of the hyperactivation of
  spinal neurons and astrocytes in hemiparkinsonian rats. Different monoamines, such
  as dopamine and noradrenaline, play an important role in pain control and may be
  also related to the MCS-induced analgesia in ePD rats.
