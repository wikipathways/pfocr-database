caption: Representation of part of phenylpropanoids and oleuropein biosynthetic pathway
  in olive fruits. For each enzymatic step, rectangular boxes outlined in green and
  red indicate up- and down-regulated genes in ‘Cellina di Nardò’ vs. ‘Salella’ comparison,
  respectively. Heat map of transcript expression for each DEG was reported. The green
  dots indicate the metabolites more accumulated in ‘Cellina di Nardò’ with respect
  to ‘Salella’. The solid arrows indicate the consequential processes, and the dashed
  arrows represent those processed with unknown intermediates. Fold Change (FC).
