caption: Activation of AhR by multiple factors promotes the occurrence and development
  of human SLE. On the one hand, factors such as ultraviolet, environmental toxins,
  and gut microbiota will mostly affect the binding of AhR to ligands. AhR regulates
  the pathophysiological functions of multiple immune cells in a ligand-specific manner,
  which in turn affects SLE. Meanwhile, many signaling pathways that regulate disease
  (e.g., mTOR, PD-1, NF-κB, STAT, TGF-β1, GLK signaling pathway, etc.) also involve
  activation of AhR, which promotes the development of SLE with the involvement of
  multiple cytokines. On the other hand, immune cells also secrete various pro-inflammatory
  substances and cytokines that influence the activation of certain signaling pathways.
  In conclusion, multiple pathways together contribute to the development of SLE through
  AhR. mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin, IFN, interferon, STAT, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription, TGF, transforming growth factor, GLK, germinal center
  kinase-like kinase, SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.
