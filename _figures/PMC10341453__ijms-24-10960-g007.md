caption: Ovarian SKOV-3/CDDP cells develop resistance to cisplatin through various
  mechanisms, including oxidative stress, enhanced antioxidant thioredoxin (Trx/TrxR)
  system, and abnormal signaling pathways. QU pre-treatment has been shown to influence
  various targets, including Trx/TrxR anti-oxidant system and signaling pathways involved
  in tumor development and progression. This antioxidant system is composed of thioredoxin
  reductases (TrxR), thioredoxins (Trx-1), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADPH). Reduced Trx is maintained by TrxR, which accept reducing equivalents from
  NADPH to the oxidized forms of Trx, that in turn catalyze the reduction of disulfides
  (s-s) within oxidized cellular proteins, such as (STAT3). Inhibition of TrxR by
  QU pre-treatment results in the accumulation of oxidized STAT3, which prevents STAT3-dependent
  transcription. QU pre-treatment also targets mTOR. Inhibition of mTOR is associated
  with inhibition of phosphorylation of STAT-3 at both Ser727 and Tyr705 that collectively
  inhibit SKOV-3/CDDP cell survival and proliferation
