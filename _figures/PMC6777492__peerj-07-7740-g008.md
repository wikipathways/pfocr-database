caption: '(A) Network of unigenes in the turquoise module, which is highly connected
  to the BU group. The unigenes aligned to the plant hormone signal transduction pathway
  are amplified to show detail. (B) Network of unigenes in the lightgreen module,
  which is highly connected to the BI group. (C) Network of unigenes in the darkturquoise
  and orangered4 modules, which are highly connected to the CU group. (D) Network
  of unigenes in the paleturquoise module, which is highly connected to the CI group.
  Each node indicates a gene, and its size indicates the number of hits to this gene.
  The log2FC values of the unigenes are characterized by five colors: green, showing
  log2FC <  − 2; blue, showing −2 ≤ log2FC <  − 1; pink, showing −1 ≤ log2FC ≤ 1;
  orange, showing 1 < log2FC ≤2; and red, showing 2 < log2FC. The unigene names are
  provided when Q values < 0.05, and two sizes are used based on different significance
  levels: the larger indicates a significant expression change at the 0.01 level,
  and the smaller size indicates a significant expression change at the 0.05 level.'
