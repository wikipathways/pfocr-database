caption: Endothelial metabolism and its links to cellular damage, function, and proliferation
  control. Metabolism, including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle,
  fatty acid oxidation, and nitric oxide synthase are represented in red. Useful products
  of metabolism, NO, ATP, and Ca2+signaling are shown in green. Damaging side products
  of metabolism are shown in yellow.
