caption: The cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator
  of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) signalling pathway. cGAS binds to the sugar-phosphate
  backbone of cytosolic double stranded (ds)DNA of a viral, apoptotic, exosomal, mitochondrial,
  or micronuclei nature, in a sequence-independent manner []. This binding results
  in conformational changes to cGAS which facilitates the catalysis of ATP and GTP
  into cyclic Gp(2′,5′)Ap(3′,5′) (cGAMP) [,,]. As an autoregulatory mechanism, cGAMP
  is degraded by ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) [,,].
  STING is then activated by cGAMP at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in
  its oligomerisation and tetramerization after which it translocates to the Golgi
  [,]. STING can also be directly activated by bacteria derived cyclic dinucleotides
  (CDNs) []. STING then recruits and activates TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) which
  phosphorylates the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) [,].
  Phosphorylated IRF3 then translocates to the nucleus and upregulates the expression
  of Type I interferons (IFNs) which results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  such as IFN-β [,]. This is an original figure created with BioRender.com.
