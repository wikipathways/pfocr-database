caption: Notch signaling pathway. The Notch signaling pathway consists of Notch, Notch
  ligand (DSL or Jagged1/2) and CSL (a class of DNA-binding proteins, include RBPJ).
  Notch signaling is generated by the interaction of Notch ligands of neighboring
  cells with the receptor, initiating ADAM10-mediated proteolysis of the extracellular
  domain. After three times of cleavage, Notch protein is released into the cytoplasm
  from the NICD and enters the nucleus to bind to the transcription factor CSL to
  form the NICD/CSL transcriptional activation complex, which activates the target
  genes of the transcriptional inhibitory factor family such as Hes and Hey, and plays
  a biological role.
