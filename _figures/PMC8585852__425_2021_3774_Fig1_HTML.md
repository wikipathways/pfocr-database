caption: 'Overview of the genes involved in dhurrin biosynthesis, recycling, transport,
  bioactivation and in prevention of auto-toxicity. a Dhurrin is synthesised from
  tyrosine by the sequential action of three key enzymes. b Bioactivation of dhurrin
  to release a hydrogen cyanide bomb occurs upon tissue disruption by the action of
  specific β-glucosidases (DHR) and an α-hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL). c Auto-toxicity
  is prevented by β-cyanoalanine synthase and nitrilases retrieving the nitrogen of
  the hydrogen cyanide for production of amino acids and ammonia. d Endogenous recycling
  pathway mediated by glutathione transferases and a heteromeric NIT4A/NIT4B2 nitrilase
  resulting in formation of ammonia and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid without the release
  of HCN. e Dhurrin synthesis occurs in the cytosol and two potential genes, SbMATE2
  and SbCGTR1, may be involved in dhurrin transport to sites of storage within the
  cell or to other parts of the plant. Abbreviations: Asn asparagine; Asp aspartic
  acid; DHR dhurrinase; NH3, ammonia'
