caption: Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The extrinsic pathway is initiated
  by binding of ligands (FasL, tumour necrosis factor, or other cytokines) to death
  receptors, which recruits the adaptor protein Fas-associated Death Domain (FADD),
  and, consequently, procaspase-8. The formation of the death-inducing-signaling-complex
  (DISC) results in cleavage and auto-activation of caspase-8. The activated caspase-8
  can then proteolytically activate downstream caspases (particularly caspase-3),
  which induce cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing and DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis
  can also be triggered by various apoptotic stimuli, which results in the activation
  of the intrinsic pathway. Here, caspase-8 cleaves and activates Bid. Subsequently,
  t-Bid translocates to the mitochondria where it can induce the oligomerization of
  Bax and/or Bak in the outer mitochondrial membrane leading to cytochrome c release.
  Afterwards, Apaf-1 binds cytochrome c and recruits caspase-9 to form a large complex,
  called apoptosome, which is responsible for the following avtivation of caspase-3.
  Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL oppose the effecst of Bid and Bax.
