caption: Cancer cells can traverse the tumor suppressive TGF-β bottleneck by accumulating
  mutations (“X”) that disable the signal transduction pathway. In many gastrointestinal
  cancers, TGF-β receptor and SMAD mutations deeply disable the pathway, and this
  now allows stromal TGF-β to exert pro-tumorigenic effects including immune suppressive
  action on T and NK cells and activation of stromal paracrine loops such as the production
  of tumorigenic cytokines (e.g. IL-11) by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). In
  many other types of cancer, the TGF-β receptors and SMADs remain intact but downstream
  alterations prevent the pathway from triggering tumor suppressive effects. Thus
  corrupted, the TGF-β–SMAD pathway can drive a non-lethal EMT as well the production
  of factors that promote metastatic extravasation, immune evasion, and colonization
  of target tissues.
