caption: Cellular responses induced by IGF signaling pathway in pulmonary fibrosis.
  IGF-1 is produced by alveolar macrophages (AMs) and fibroblasts. IGF-1 activates
  fibroblast via PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling and leads to fibroblast-myofibroblast
  transition via PI3K/Akt, MAPK, EGR1/2, and FOS signaling. Transition of type II
  alveolar epithelial cells to fibroblast-like cells is mediated by IGF-1-induced
  ERK activation. IGF-1 mediates alternative activation of alveolar macrophages, generating
  type 2-activated macrophages. Except for fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, EMT-generated
  fibroblast-like cells and alternative type 2-activated macrophages are all capable
  of producing extracellular matrix (ECM) and profibrotic signals.
