caption: Scheme of biosynthetic origins of secondary metabolites detected in bioreactor
  cultures of A. terreus ATCC 20542 based on the previously published works. The underlined
  names of molecules indicate the metabolites that were encountered in the course
  of the study. For clarity, some metabolic intermediates are not included in the
  scheme. Malonyl-CoA is presented as the precursor of polyketide-type compounds (a),
  (b), (d), and (f), while 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid fuels the formation of butyrolactone
  I (c) and aspulvinone E (e). a 3α-Hydroxy-3,5-dihydromonacolin L acid and mevinolinic
  acid originate from the common metabolic pathway (Barriuso et al. ; Kennedy et al.
  ). It is proposed here that 4a,5-dihydromevinolinic acid may be formed via hydroxylation
  of 4a,5-dihydromonacolin L acid and subsequent esterification with methylbutyrate
  (reactions marked by question marks). f Eight of out 15 identified molecules have
  their origin in the common octaketide pathway (Chen et al. ; Nielsen et al. ). It
  is suggested here that (+)-erdin (Raistrick and Smith ) and demethylasterric acid
  (Natori and Nishikawa ) are the results of hydrolysis of ester bonds in (+)-geodin
  and asterric acid, respectively. Desmethylsulochrin is a precursor of sulochrin,
  but its presence can also be attributed to ester bond hydrolysis in sulochrin (not
  shown). The activity of biosynthetic pathways of (b) dihydroisoflavipucine (Gressler
  et al. ), (c) butyrolactone I (Guo et al. ), (d) terrein (Zaehle et al. ), and (e)
  aspulvinone E (Guo et al. ) have also been observed in the experiment
