caption: Assembly and disassembly of FMDV capsids and control of pentamer switching.
  Black arrows indicate pathway of normal FMDV capsid assembly and disassembly. The
  green arrow represents the pathway taken by the ‘maturation engineered’ pentamers
  generated in this study. Processing of P1-2A facilitates folding of P1-2A into an
  assembly competent protomer (5S) followed by assembly of 5 protomers into a pentameric
  structure with 14S sedimentation containing intact VP0 protein. Twelve pentamers
  assemble into intact capsids in a concentration dependent manner and if viral RNA
  is encapsidated they form virions (146S). Low pH, heat or cell entry trigger the
  disassembly of intact capsids into disassembly versions of pentamers (12S) containing
  VP2 and lacking VP4. An introduced maturation cleavage mutation allows conversion
  of assembly pentamers directly into disassembly pentamers. Created with Biorender.com.
