caption: Working model on the molecular mechanism by which the H. pylori T4SS induces
  potent IL-8 induction in human endothelial cells. We propose that the H. pylori
  T4SS triggers IL-8 induction in endothelial cells by interacting with an as yet
  unidentified integrin (shown as yellow/beige heterodimer) via the T4SS-associated
  adhesin, CagL, and its RGD motif. This triggers the activation of downstream signaling
  intermediates (diamond symbols), leading to activation of NF-κB and subsequent expression
  of IL-8. Other transcription factors (TFs) important for regulating inflammatory
  genes, such as EGR1, AP-1, or STAT3, may also contribute to the induction of IL-8
  in endothelial cells. This study shows that the H. pylori T4SS/CagL is capable of
  upregulating EGR1 expression (not depicted). The latter is a known downstream response
  of EGFR activation. The precise mechanism by which the H. pylori T4SS/CagL triggers
  activation of EGFR signaling is currently unclear. It may occur either via integrin-EGFR
  crosstalk subsequent to the binding of CagL to integrin (blue solid arrow) or direct
  interaction of CagL with EGFR via an unknown mechanism (blue dashed arrow). Alternatively,
  CagL-integrin interaction may activate an ADAM17-like metalloprotease that results
  in the shedding of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) (solid circles),
  which then binds to EGFR and activates EGFR signaling. Finally, our findings show
  that H. pylori T4SS/CagL is able to upregulate EGFR expression. We propose that
  this occurs via stimulation of a hitherto unknown receptor (rectangle) and the corresponding
  downstream signaling pathway, acting as a positive feedback mechanism by which H.
  pylori further potentiates EGFR-dependent IL-8 induction in HUVECs. The number of
  signaling intermediates illustrated is arbitrary.
