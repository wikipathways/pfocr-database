caption: 'Cordycepin biosynthesis pathway in C. militaris and qRT-PCR results. Bar
  chart with 4 colors represents the relative expression levels of four genes in response
  to distinct salt treatments. The bars represent the average (±SE) of biological
  repeats. NaCl-3, 5, and 7 represent 3%, 5%, and 7% salt concentrations, respectively.
  Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between groups (Student''s
  t-test): * and ** indicating significance level was accepted at P ≤ 0.05 and P <
  0.01, respectively, ns: no significant difference, as compared to control.'
