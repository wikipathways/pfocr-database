caption: The metabolic shifts in shr fruits during ripening in comparison to WT. The
  relative changes in the metabolite levels at MG, BR, and RR stage in shr fruits
  were determined by calculating the shr/WT ratio at respective ripening phases. Log2-fold
  changes are represented by varying shades of colors in the boxes with dark red and
  dark green color representing a maximum increase and decrease respectively at bottom
  left-hand corner. The white box represents Log2 fold changes in the range of −0.5
  to + 0.5. The metabolites in gray letters on pathway were not detected in GC-MS
  analysis. The pink colored circle on pathways denotes the enzymes reported to be
  modulated by NO in literature. The values are the mean ±SD (n = 3–5 fruits). The
  metabolites which level were higher or lower to log2FC (−0.5 or +0.5) and statistically
  significant (Supplementary Table ) in shr in comparison to WT were only showed on
  pathways.
