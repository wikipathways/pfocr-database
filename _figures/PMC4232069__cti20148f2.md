caption: A FOXO3-driven pathway abrogates inflammatory responses in a transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β1-dependent manner. Upon monocyte activation, FOXO3 is translocated
  out of the nucleus leading to the inactivation of its transcriptional programme.
  The re-instatement of this transcriptional programme is dependent upon transcription
  and de novo protein production, and leads, via a TGFβ1-dependent mechanism, to the
  abrogation of inflammatory responses by augmenting production of anti-inflammatory
  cytokines and suppressing that of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Minor allele carriage
  at rs12212067 (a SNP in FOXO3A) facilitates the earlier recovery of nuclear FOXO3
  by increasing FOXO3A transcription during inflammatory responses and is associated
  with a milder course of Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis but increased susceptibility
  to severe malaria.
