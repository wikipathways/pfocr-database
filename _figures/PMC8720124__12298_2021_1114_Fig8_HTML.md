caption: Illustrated model comparing the differences, between PK and ND 019 leaves,
  in Na+ stress response of genes encoding the ion transporters (SOS1 and NHX1) regulated
  by SOS2 which is sequentially activated through the signal transduction pathway
  involving Ca2+ as the second messenger and the Ca+2 binding protein (SOS3). [PK,
  Pokkali (the green-leaved genotype); ND 019, Niew Dam 019 (the purple-leaved genotype);
  ↑, upregulation; − , stable expression]
