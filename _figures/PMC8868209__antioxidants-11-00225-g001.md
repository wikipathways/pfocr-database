caption: ROS signaling, the activation of the MAPK cascade and redox ROS homeostasis
  in the cell. In biotic and abiotic stressors, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  signaling pathway is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). ROS
  is a common messenger that is produced in response to both the stress response and
  the MAPK cascade. Despite having a similar MAPK signaling regulator, the plant’s
  reaction to both stressors is distinct.
