caption: Protective role of the insulin-Akt2/ATP7A/superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) pathway
  against diabetes mellitus (DM)-induced endothelial dysfunction. Decreased ATP7A
  expression in diabetic vessels with either hypoinsulinemia (type1 DM) or selective
  impairment of insulin/Akt signaling (type 2 DM) contributes to decreased SOD3 activity,
  resulting in increased O2·− production and endothelial dysfunction. Mechanistically,
  insulin increases Akt2 binding to ATP7A to induce ATP7A phosphorylation, which may
  increase ATP7A protein expression via preventing proteasomal degradation as well
  as ATP7A translocation to the plasma membrane, which contributes to full activation
  of SOD3 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and preserves endothelial function.
  ECs, endothelial cells; TGN, trans-Golgi network.
