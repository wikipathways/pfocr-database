caption: 'Cross talk between E2–estrogen receptor-α (ERα) signaling pathways and circadian
  rhythms in breast cancer. Two of the four estrogen signaling pathways involve E2
  stimulation and are shown here (). In the classical genomic pathway, E2-bound estrogen
  receptor (ER) (either ERα or ERβ) dimerizes, changes conformation, translocates
  to the nucleus, and binds to the estrogen response elements (EREs). After binding
  to the EREs, the E2–ER complex recruits other co-activators, including Circadian
  Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) and possibly brain and muscle Arnt-like protein
  1 (BMAL1) (), to initiate the transcription of target genes. CLOCK overexpression
  in breast tumors and promotion of tumor cell proliferation may be caused by co-activation
  with E2–ER complexes (, ). In the non-genomic pathway, E2–ERα complexes accumulate
  near the membrane and then recruit protein kinases [Src and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K)] to activate signaling cascades (Akt and Ras/MAPK). BMAL1 has been shown
  to suppress the Akt/MMP2 pathway and further inhibit cancer cell invasion (). BMAL1
  can suppress cancers, and its expression is downregulated or disrupted in various
  breast cancer cell lines (, –). By contrast, REV-ERBβ (a repressor in the secondary
  transcriptional/translational feedback loop) is generally overexpressed in breast
  tumor samples; its protective function can allow cancer cells to develop chemotherapy
  resistance (). PER2 is a direct ERα target gene and can bind to ERα and cause its
  degradation. In ERα-positive breast cancer cells, both PER2 and ERα lose their circadian
  oscillations, the underlying mechanism of which is not well understood. The cancer
  suppressor p53 can directly bind to the PER2 promoter and inhibit its transcriptional
  activity (). E2–ER complexes can block the induction of proapoptotic p53 target
  genes by binding to p53 protein in ER-positive breast cancer cells, thus helping
  cancer cells avoid apoptosis (). Re-introduction of PER2 into the ER-positive breast
  cancer cells can induce p53 expression (). Abbreviations: TF, transcriptional factor;
  RE, response element; E2, 17 β-estradiol.'
