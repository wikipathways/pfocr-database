caption: Immunotherapies that target CAFs. Four general approaches that target cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) for cancer immunotherapy. ① Fibroblast activation protein+ (FAP+)
  CAFs can be directly eliminated by transgenic technologies, immunotherapies, and
  oncolytic adenovirus. ② Targeting the important signals and effectors of CAFs, such
  as CX-chemokine ligand 12-CX chemokine receptor 4 (CXCL12-CXCR4) interaction, Janus
  kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK-STAT3) pathway, transforming
  growth factor-β (TGF-β), and Hedgehog signaling pathway, can be used to inhibit
  the function of CAFs. ③ A reprogramming strategy such as vitamin A and vitamin D
  can be adopted to dedifferentiate activated CAFs to resident (normalized) fibroblasts.
  ④ CAF-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and associated signaling pathway
  can be targeted to induce stromal depletion. CAR chimeric antigen receptor, mAb
  monoclonal antibody, MDSC myeloid-derived suppressor cell, TAM tumor-associated
  macrophage, Treg cell regulatory T cell
