caption: Figure 3. The fly-substratum niche and the impacts of gut associated microbes
  on Drosophila. Drosophila larvae and adults are saprophytic, feeding on microbes
  growing on decaying fruit (A) These microbes, or others acquired from the environment
  soon after birth, can also persist in the gut and form stable associations along
  the life cycle. These microbes have important impacts on host physiology, such as
  increasing larval growth rate by optimizing host metabolism and inducing the basal
  epithelial immune response. (B) Yeasts are essential to Drosophila development and
  nutrition by providing sterols, B vitamins, and RNA. Gut-associated bacteria increase
  larval growth. In nutrient-limited conditions this has been shown to be due to their
  impact on TOR-insulin signaling, either by production of acetic acid (Acetobacter
  pomorum) or increased amino acid metabolism (Lactobacillus plantarum). (C) The Imd
  pathway is activated upon the recognition of DAP-type peptidoglycan by PGRP-LC.
  The downstream nuclear translocation of the NF-κB factor Relish activates the transcription
  of genes encoding antibacterial peptides and negative regulators of the pathway,
  such as amidase PGRPs and Pirk. Amidase PGPRs reduce the immune response to microbiota
  by degrading peptidoglycan, while Pirk acts at the level of Imd pathway signaling.
  The transcription factor Caudal reduces antimicrobial peptide expression in the
  posterior midgut. This permits persistence of a beneficial microbiota in this segment.
  Dietary microbes induce the production of ROS by the NAPDH-oxidase Duox, which controls
  their density in the gut.
