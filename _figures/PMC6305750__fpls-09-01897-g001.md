caption: Schematic view of cryptochromes (cry) role in stress acclimation responses.
  (A) Domain structure of cry consists of Photolyase-Homologous Region (PHR) domain
  and CRY C-terminal extension (CCE) domain. The cry chromophores methenyltetrahydrofolate
  (MTHF) and FAD are binding to PHR, a light perception domain. (B) FAD chromophore
  redox states of cry. FAD is oxidized (FADox) in the darkness (D), with the absorption
  peak in blue light (BL). On light exposure, FADox changes to the neutral semireduced
  state (FADH°), which allows the biological activity of cry in the plant cell. With
  the absorption peak in green light (GL), FADH° is induced to change to the totally
  reduced form (FAD-). An unclear subject around the reoxidation of FAD is the production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the process. Stress signaling pathway regulated
  by cryptochromes. From the blue light signaling, cry coordinate the negative regulation
  of COP1-dependent degradation of HY5 and PIF4 transcription factors, triggering
  changes in stress response target genes expression. Note that these are key pathways
  in the induction of genes related to signaling and/or biosynthesis of hormones,
  ROS and stress components. Although the complex signaling of cry in stress acclimation
  still involves some unknown components, certainly this photoreceptor play a crucial
  role in BL-dependent stress responses. Arrows means downregulation, T-bars indicate
  upregulation and dotted lines indicate unknown (?) signaling routes. E3 ubiquitin-ligase;
  COP1, constitutive photomorphogenic 1; HY5, long hypocotyl 5; PIF4, phytochrome
  interacting factor 4; ET, ethylene; SA, salicylic acid; ABA, abscisic acid; AUX,
  auxin.
