caption: 'The activation of serotonin receptors (5-HT-R) initiates a signaling cascade
  that leads to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Once
  activated, p-ERK increases α-secretase activity and reduces β- and γ-secretase cleavage
  of APP (1). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and serotonin (5-HT) regulate
  synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and neuronal survival. The activation of 5-HT-R
  stimulates the expression of BDNF, which in turn enhances the growth and survival
  of 5-HT neurons (2). BDNF binds to its high-affinity tyrosine receptor kinase B
  (TrkB) resulting in the recruitment of proteins that activate two different signal
  transduction cascades: (i) insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI-3K), and protein kinase B (Akt) and (ii) Ras, Raf, and extracellular signal
  regulated kinases (ERK) (3). BDNF signaling pathways activate one or more transcription
  factors that regulate the expression of genes encoding proteins. Such transcription
  factors include cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB), serum response factor
  (SRF), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) that exert an inhibitory action in the
  amyloidogenic pathways (4). 5-HT binds 5-HT-2C resulting in the recruitment of proteins
  that activate two different signal transduction cascades: (i) adenylate cyclase
  (AC), cAMP, and protein kinase A (PKA) and (ii) phospholipase C (PLC), diacylglycerol
  (DAG), and protein kinase C (PKC) (5). The 5-HT signaling pathway activates one
  or more transcription factors that regulate expression of genes encoding proteins
  (CREB, SRF, and NF-kB) leading to an inhibitory action in the amyloidogenic pathways
  (4). The 5’-untranslated region (5’UTR) of the APP mRNA is a key regulatory sequence
  that determines the amount of intracellular APP holoprotein present in brain-derived
  cells in response to interleukin-1 (IL-1) and iron (IRE). Paroxetine acts as an
  intracellular iron chelator to limit the translation of APP holoprotein guided by
  sequences of untranslated APP mRNA 5’UTR regions (6). Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)
  signaling, through tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), mainly results in activation
  of the transcription factors NF-kB and induces pro-inflammatory effects that exacerbate
  neuroinflammation and secondary neuronal damage. Imipramine blocks TNF-α/TNFR1 signaling
  and prevents the appearance of cognitive deficits in AD and Aβ formation (7).'
