caption: Net effect of changes in intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis caused by inhibiting
  glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in motor neurons. Illustration shows the change
  in the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways affected by the GSK-3β inhibitor.
  The greater the decrease in GSK-3β activity was, the greater the decrease in intrinsic
  apoptosis was observed. However, extrinsic apoptosis increased paradoxically.
