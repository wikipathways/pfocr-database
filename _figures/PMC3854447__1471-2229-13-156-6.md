caption: VvCCD-mediated cleavage of members of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway.The
  cleavage of tested members of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is shown together
  with the volatile apocarotenoids produced. The 5,6 (5’,6’) and 9,10 (9’,10’) double
  bond cleavage sites are indicated with a diagonal line (/) through the carotenoid
  backbone. The circled (light grey circle) double bonds represent an increase in
  desaturation of the carbon bonds that is required for substrate acceptance.
