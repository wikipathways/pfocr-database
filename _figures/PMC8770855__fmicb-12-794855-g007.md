caption: Model depicting cellular responses during ER stress. Early (initial) exposure
  to ER stress initiates the autophosphorylation of Ire1, leading to the activation
  of its ribonuclease (RNase) activity and the subsequent splicing of the intron from
  HAC1u (unspliced) mRNA. Spliced (HAC1s) mRNA codes for the Hac1 protein, which activates
  the UPR target genes. During ER stress, Ire1 promotes the activation of HOG MAP
  kinase pathway (indicated by dotted arrow). Subsequently, adaptation to ER stress
  is allowed, when Ssk1-mediated activation of Hog1 MAP kinase attenuates the activity
  of Ire1 (indicated by dotted blunt line). The attenuation of Ire1 activity could
  be due to the influence of Hog1, directly or indirectly, on the dephosphorylation
  of Ire1, which in turn regulates the RNase activity-mediated processing of HAC1u
  mRNA. As the UPR is terminated, the amplitude of the signal through the HOG pathway
  decreases and the stress response is fully terminated. Consequentially, the concerted
  action of the UPR and HOG MAPK pathways facilitate adaptation to ER stress, and
  guides the recovery of C. albicans from ER stress.
