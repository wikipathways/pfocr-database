caption: In the kynurenine pathway, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase
  convert tryptophan into N-formyl-L-kynurenine, which is further metabolized to L-kynurenine
  by formamidase. L-kynurenine is metabolized into kynurenic acid (KYNA) and quinolinic
  acid along distinct pathways within the brain due to their reliance on the respective
  kynurenine aminotransferase and kynurenine 3-hydroxylase enzymes. KYNA has inhibitory
  action on α7 nicotinic and NMDA receptors. Galantamine and memantine cross the blood-brain
  barrier and would target α7 nicotinic and NMDA receptors, thereby counteracting
  tire effects of KYNA.
