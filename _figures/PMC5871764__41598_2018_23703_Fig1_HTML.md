caption: Summary of significant and nominally significant findings in Notch pathway
  mRNA expression between the schizophrenia and the healthy control group after controlling
  for age, gender and Bmal1. Results are given as p-values, adjusted for multiple
  testing, where significant results are indicated in red/dark blue (for increased/decreased
  mRNA expression) and nominally significant results (0.001 < p < 0.05) are shown
  as pink/light blue (for increased/decreased mRNA expression). Non-significant results
  are depicted as boxes with white background. The figure is based on the Notch signaling
  pathway in the KEGG database (hsa04330, version date 5/9/17). Hey1 is included by
  the authors due to its known role as a target gene for Notch signaling.
