caption: Diagram illustrating histamine receptor signalling—Gspathway. Histamine binds
  to the H2 receptor subtype that is coupled with the Gs‐type protein. Gs α subunit
  activates AC, with subsequent production of cAMP, which then stimulates PKA. PKA‐dependent
  phosphorylation activates ligand gated α‐AMPA receptors, which open and facilitate
  influx of Na+ and, less commonly, Ca2+. PKA also suppresses K+ efflux through small
  conductance Ca2+‐activated potassium channels (SK channels). Both the activation
  of AMPA receptors and inhibition of SK channels depolarize the neurons, with consequent
  augmentation of their excitability and increased pain signalling
