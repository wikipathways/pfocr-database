caption: Alterations within the TP53 and RB1/E2F3 pathways in high-grade bladder cancer.
  (A) Heatmap showing the distribution of TP53 and MDM2 alterations. (B) The RB1 cell
  cycle regulatory pathway with incidence of mutations and copy number alterations
  displayed for each gene along with a heatmap showing the co-occurrence of genetic
  alterations in this pathway. The boxplot (right) depicts the association between
  an E2F3 expression signature score and alterations within genes involved in the
  RB1 pathway (“multiple” refers to more than one gene in this pathway altered in
  the same tumor sample). Those samples harboring E2F3 amplification or amplification
  of multiple genes within the RB1 pathway display significantly increased E2F3 activity
  scores compared with tumors lacking amplification of any component of the pathway
  (labeled as “none”). P values were calculated by t test.
