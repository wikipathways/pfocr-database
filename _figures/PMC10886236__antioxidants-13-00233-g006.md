caption: Heat map of the pathways of DEGs and DAMs in the flavonoid synthesis pathway
  under different treatments. Pathways were constructed based on the KEGG pathway
  and references. The four treatments are CK, Na, Ca, and Na_Ca from left to right.
  Data in boxes indicate the average expression of DAMs in the four treatments, indicated
  by circles, where red indicates up-regulation and blue indicates down-regulation.
  The square under the arrows indicates the average expression of genes corresponding
  to key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway under the four treatments, where orange
  indicates up-regulation and green indicates down-regulation
