caption: Catabolism of inositol. Ensifer aridi-predicted encoding genes (PEGs) involved
  in the transport and catabolism of inositol are shown in the metabolic pathway.
  The presence of putative IolR, ThuR, and RpoE2 binding sites upstream of genes (shown
  on the right boxes) are indicated, respectively, by “$”, “#”, and “σ” on the left
  of genes when identified and the position of conserved residues are bolded and colored
  accordingly in boxes. The salt response refers to fold change previously found by
  RNAseq []. Positive fold changes indicating upregulation (green) in salt containing
  medium are bolded when ≥ 2.
