caption: 'Mechanism of adenosine pathway in tumor microenvironment. Adenosine is autonomously
  produced from ATP through ADP via CD39 and CD73 expressed mainly on the surface
  of cancer cells, B cells or Tregs. The work of extracellular adenosine is mainly
  divided into two directions. For immune cells, adenosine has a potent immunosuppressive
  ability through A2AR and A2BR. For cancer cells, adenosine stimulates tumor growth
  and metastasis through A2BR. Abbreviations: CTL, cytotoxic lymphocyte; DC, dendritic
  cell; NK, natural killer; M2, M2 macrophage; MDSC, myeloid derived suppressor cell;
  Th1, T helper 1; Th17, T helper 17; Treg, regulatory T cell.'
