caption: A, in skeletal muscle microvascular blood vessels, oral glucose tolerance
  test (OGTT) leads to vasoconstriction whereas intravenous glucose tolerance test
  (IVGTT) results in vasodilatation. B, this difference in vascular response to the
  same glucose load is probably related to the marked increased in gastric inhibitory
  polypeptide (GIP) and not dependent on the increase in plasma insulin or glucagon
  like peptide 1 (GLP‐1). C, the proposed vasoconstrictive effect of GIP is the result
  of GIP‐receptor dependent MAPK induced increase in endothelin‐1 release via increases
  in endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) (Ding et al. ). GLP‐1 acts via activation
  of G‐protein coupled receptors, activating several intracellular signalling pathways
  via phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K) to increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase
  (eNOS) phosphorylation and ultimately release of the vasodilator compound nitric
  oxide (NO). Insulin also acts via endothelial cell located G‐protein coupled receptors
  and may induce both vasoconstriction via the endothelin‐1 pathway or vasodilatation
  via increased eNOS activity.
