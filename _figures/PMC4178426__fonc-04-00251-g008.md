caption: Homologous recombination (HR) pathway. The HR is the principal, non-error-prone,
  repair mechanism for DNA double-strand breaks. SQ and SCLC had 10 of 11 overexpressed
  genes throughout the pathway, including the very important BRCA2, RAD51 paralogs,
  and BLM (Bloom syndrome mutated). Red indicates significantly overexpression, dark
  green significant downregulation, and light green no differential expression. COID,
  carcinoids; AD, adenocarcinoma; SCLC, small-cell lung cancer; SQ, Squamous cell
  lung cancer; MESO, mesothelioma.
