caption: DM and molecule network related to oncostatin M pathway regulation in RECZIKV+.
  The network was built using IPA software. Each molecule was represented as a node,
  and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line).
  All edges are supported by at least one reference from the literature or canonical
  information stored in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IKB). The molecule network is
  directly or indirectly related to the oncostatin M signaling canonical pathway.
  MiR-30a-5p is a central node targeting some other node molecules like signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and 3 (STAT3), activator protein 1 (JUN),
  and neuronal differentiation 1 (NEUROD1).
