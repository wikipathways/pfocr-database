caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways activated in the unfolded
  protein response (UPR). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can trigger UPR that consists
  of at least three independent pathways identified by their transmembrane sensor
  proteins, namely, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol requiring enzyme
  1 (IRE1), and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase
  (PERK). Under normal conditions, these sensor proteins are inactive because of their
  association with an ER-resident chaperone protein, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein
  (GRP78). However, in ER stress conditions, GRP78 preferentially binds to unfolded/misfolded
  proteins in the ER lumen leading to the release and activation of the sensor proteins
  that, in turn, induce their respective downstream signaling pathways. In the ATF6
  pathway, GRP78-released ATF6 moves to the Golgi apparatus and is cleaved by both
  serine proteases and metalloproteases at S1 and S2 sites, respectively. Cleaved
  ATF6 acts as a transcription factor that binds to the promoters of UPR target genes,
  such as GRP78 and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), and upregulates their expression.
  In the IRE1 pathway, after its autophosphorylation and oligomerization, GRP78-released
  IRE1 processes the XBP1 mRNA to generate spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) that, in turn, induces
  UPR target genes to restore ER homeostasis. Additionally, activated IRE1 also induces
  the expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α
  (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), through the TNF receptor-associated factor 2–IκB
  kinase–c Jun N-terminal kinase (TRAF2–IKK–JNK) signaling axis. Under some circumstances,
  it can rapidly degrade some specific subset of mRNAs. In the PERK pathway, after
  its autophosphorylation and oligomerization, GRP78-released PERK globally attenuates
  mRNAs to protein translation by phosphorylating the α-subunit of translational initiation
  factor (eIF2) complex. Additionally, increased eIF2α phosphorylation also modulates
  the pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways by activating the alternative transcription
  factor 4-C/EBP homologous protein (ATF4–CHOP) signaling axis.
