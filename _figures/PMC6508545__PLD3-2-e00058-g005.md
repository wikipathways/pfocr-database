caption: Model for ethylene signal transduction. Signal output from the ethylene receptors
  diverges to regulate the CTR1/EIN2/EIN3 and AHP/ARR pathways. ETR1 is shown here
  as a representative ethylene receptor that has histidine kinase activity. Ethylene
  responses may be dependent on an individual pathway or have varying contributions
  from both pathways
