caption: Schematic showing the possible signaling pathways involved in the TNF-α/IL-1β-mediated
  regulation of the functional state of Cx43 HCs and GJs in mesangial cells. High
  TNF-α/IL-1β concentrations could promote activation of a RhoA/ROCK-dependent pathway
  through TNF-α/IL-1β receptors (TNF-R and IL-1R) (continuous black arrows). Once
  the RhoA/ROCK-dependent pathway is activated, the formation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) takes place (generating TBARS) along with NF-κB-dependent production of proinflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β. The activated RhoA/ROCK-dependent pathway could
  increase the activity of Cx43 HCs, since Fasudil or Y-27632 (ROCK blockers) inhibit
  this response. The resulting increase in [Ca2+]i will also activate Cx43 HCs, allowing
  the increase in Ca2+ influx. The latter results in the rise of [Ca2+]i and further
  generation of ROS. The influx of Ca2+ establishes a positive feedback loop sensitive
  to different compounds such as the mimetic peptides Gap19 and TAT-L2, selective
  Cx43 HC blockers. This increase in the cellular activity caused by TNF-α/IL-1β,
  where the RhoA/ROCK pathway could be involved, also reduces cell–cell communication
  through GJs. Of note, alterations in [Ca2+]i homeostasis mediated by Cx43 HCs or
  Panx1 HCs might affect diverse aspects of MC functions (e.g., morphology and proinflammatory
  profile). Discontinuous black arrows indicate cell responses identified in other
  systems, whereas straight black arrows denote responses identified in the present
  work. Elaborated in biorender.com.
