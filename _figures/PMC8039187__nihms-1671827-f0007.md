caption: (A) Schematic illustrating the core proteinaceous nucleoid components bound
  to mtDNA at a replication fork. Nucleoid components are covalently modified at cysteine
  residues (to generate 2-succinocysteine modifications) in the presence of elevated
  fumarate concentrations in FH−/− tumor mitochondria. 2-succinocysteine modification
  of the DNA polymerase POLG leads to decreased and error-prone polymerase activity,
  which over time leads to loss and mutation of mtDNA in FH−/− tumor cells. Mutations
  in mtDNA were observed in three of the five patient-derived FH−/− tumor cell lines
  (UOK262, UOK268, UOK348), whereas depletion or complete absence of mtDNA was observed
  in all five FH−/− tumor cell lines. (B) Schematic illustrating a normally functioning
  TCA cycle and respiratory chain (left). Respiratory complexes that require mtDNA-encoded
  proteins for their function are indicated in blue, and FH and complex II which are
  encoded by nuclear genes only are colored in green. Following loss of the remaining
  functional FH allele, excess fumarate accumulation in FH−/− renal tumors results
  in the succination of POLG (right). Loss and mutations of mtDNA resulting from POLG
  succination lead to impaired respiratory chain assembly and activity, promoting
  aerobic glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux and driving anabolic
  pathways that require NADPH, thus facilitating tumor cell growth and progression
  (right). These mtDNA mutational events induce a permanent commitment of FH−/− tumor
  cells to aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect).
