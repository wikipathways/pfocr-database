caption: '. : diagram of genes that have been implicated in susceptibility to cutaneous
  leishmaniasis (CL) and mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) disease caused by Leishmania braziliensis
  in the area of Corte de Pedra, state of Bahia, Brazil, showing involvement of, and
  interaction with, the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway. Polymorphisms
  in genes annotated in red lettering have been associated with CL or ML disease.
  Turquoise circles indicate the pathway through which interleukin (IL)-6 influences
  SMAD4 via FLI1. SP1/3 are transcription factors that influence FLI1 expression.
