caption: Figure 5. DEAD box RNA helicases function in the E. coli cold stress response.
  Association of the five E. coli DEAD-box RNA helicases with cellular pathways associated
  with cold stress is indicated. DeaD is present at significantly reduced levels at
  37°C with expression induced in response to cold stress at 15°C. DeaD helicase activity
  is associated with a number of cellular pathways. RhlE, SrmB, DeaD and DbpA function
  in ribosome biogenesis, including 50S and 30S subunit assembly. Whether these helicases
  function in a linear sequence of reactions associated with 50S subunit assembly
  or RhlE dictates either an SrmB- or DeaD-specific pathway, as proposed by Jain,
  remains to be elucidated. At 37°C, RhlE is proposed to direct initial assembly followed
  by SrmB while at 15°C, RhlE is proposed to direct a DeaD-dependent pathway, possibly
  associated with formation of a cold-adapted ribosome. Evidence for DeaD functioning
  at a late stage in 30S assembly has also been presented, aiding association of S1
  and thus S2 onto the ribosome. RhlB is an integral subunit of the RNA degradosome
  at 37°C, catalyzing RNA turnover. The degradosome complex assembles into two interacting
  cytoskeletal helices, one formed by RNase E and one by RhlB. At 15°C, DeaD and potentially
  RhlE can functionally replace RhlB, creating a cold-specific degradosome. DeaD also
  enhances translation at low temperature, potentially by removing RNA secondary structure
  which prevents translation initiation. However, this effect has been ascribed to
  reflect DeaD loading of S1 and S2 onto the 30S subunit late in assembly, rather
  than DeaD unwinding of 5′ UTR secondary structure. Evidence for RNA helicase function
  in the degradosome catalyzed turnover of sRNA-mRNA complexes, directed to the degradosome
  by the RNA chaperone Hfq, is circumstantial, although evidence has been presented
  indicating that RNA helicase activity could be required under specific conditions,
  for example cold stress. Resch et al. have shown that DeaD is a cofactor required
  for regulation of rpoS translation by the sRNA, DsrA. At low growth temperature,
  rpoS translation depends upon DsrA binding which relieves the iss blocking ribosome
  entry to the rpoS ribosome-binding site. DeaD is proposed to unwind the iss secondary
  structure prior to Hfq annealing of DsrA to rpoS. It is also possible that DeaD
  RNA helicase activity extends to a requirement to unfold DsrA and/or Hfq removal
  once the rpoS-DsrA duplex is formed and/or the requirement for an annealing RNA
  helicase, such as CrhR, to anneal the mRNA-sRNA duplex before interaction with Hfq
  at low temperature.
