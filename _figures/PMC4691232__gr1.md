caption: 'Heptoses in Gram-Negative Bacteria(A) Schematic representation of exopolysaccharide
  structures. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) forms the outer leaflet of the outer membrane
  of Gram-negative bacteria, which comprises several regions: the lipid A portion
  composed of two linked glucosamine residues (oblongs) with fatty acid side chains
  (curved lines), an internal oligosaccharide bound to lipid A by 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic
  acid (Kdo; blue hexagon). Heptose moieties (green hexagons; P, phosphate groups)
  complete the inner core of LPS. Attached to the inner core are various hexose sugars
  (violet hexagons), which form the outer core region. The O chain is a repeating
  unit (n) of specific sugar residues (pink hexagons) that forms the basis for serotyping,
  and is bound to the internal oligosaccharide. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS),
  associated with the LPS, is an unbranched homopolymer with the structure -3)-2-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-β-D-manno-heptopyranose-(1-.(B)
  Proposed biosynthetic pathway of CPS in Burkholderia pseudomallei. GDP, guanosine
  diphosphate; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate.'
