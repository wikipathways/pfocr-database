caption: 'Pathways for UDP-sugar release. UDP-glucose (UDPG) and other UDP-sugars
  are synthesized in the cytosol and enter the secretory pathway via ER/Golgi-resident
  SLC35 transporters, using UMP as antiporter substrates. ER/Golgi UDP-sugars are
  used for glycosylation, yielding UDP as a reaction product, and UDP is metabolized
  to UMP. (i) Residual UDP-sugars in the ER/Golgi lumen are released as cargo via
  the constitutive secretory pathway. (ii) Unlike ATP and UTP, UDP-sugars are not
  predicted to be substrates of the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), but Golgi-derived
  vesicles are a source of UDP-sugars in specialized granules susceptible to Ca2+-regulated
  exocytosis. Not shown: Golgi UDP is released with UDP-sugars. Whether pannexin 1
  mediates the release of cytosolic UDP-sugars is not known. PPi, pyrophosphate; G-1P,
  glucose-1P.'
