caption: 'The two branches of the unfolded protein response. As a result of accumulation
  of misfolded proteins in the ER, the unfolded protein response is initiated. Three
  signal transduction pathways coordinate the pathway and require the dissociation
  of the ER chaperone BiP. The kinases are: PKR-like kinase (PERK). PERK activation
  sends both pro-and anti-apoptotic signals but its main function is translation attenuation
  via phosphorylation of eIF2α which reduces the ER load. ATF6 induces expression
  of chaperones like BiP, but also the apoptosis factor CHOP. IRE1 is activated and
  becomes an endonuclease that process the XBP1 mRNA. XBP1 protein is a transcription
  factor that drives the transcription of both pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. The
  delicate balance between the protective and destructive branches of the UPR determines
  if the cell will overcome the stress or will die via the PCD pathway.'
