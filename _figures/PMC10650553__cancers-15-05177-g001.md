caption: 'The cholesterol synthesis pathway. Enzymes involved in the reaction are
  colored in blue, and inhibitors and inhibition symbols are colored in red. Enzymes
  involved in ketone body biosynthesis, such as HMG-CoA lyase and β-hydroxybutylate
  dehydrogenase, are also included in the figure. ACAT: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase;
  HMG-CoA: 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-CoA.'
