caption: Life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and potential anti-viral agents.SARS-CoV-2 infects
  host cells, reproduces itself and spreads depending on a variety of viral and host
  proteins. Key steps of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle inhibited by current treatment
  options as well as promising antiviral agents that are currently being examined,
  represent attractive antiviral targets and are highlighted in red. These include
  ACE2 receptor inhibitors, ACE2 mimic compounds, fusion inhibitors, several protease
  inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, passive immunization with convalescent plasma,
  monoclonal antibodies or nanobodies. Furthermore, immunomodulators such as corticosteroids,
  a selective Janus kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor (baricitinib), and various agents targeting
  the interleukin-6 pathway are presented.
