caption: A proposed model for the dual function of PRKCSH in ER protein quality control.
  Under resting conditions, PRKCSH functions as the noncatalytic beta subunit of glucosidase
  II, which catalyzes glucose trimming from newly synthesized glycoproteins and ensures
  secretion of properly folded glycoproteins and targeting improperly folded glycoproteins
  for degradation by the ERAD pathway. This is mediated by the interaction of PRKCSH
  with glucosidase II alpha subunit (GIIα) through the G2B domain and with mannose
  residues of glycoproteins through the MRH domain of PRKCSH. Under ER stress, PRKCSH
  dissociates from the GIIα subunit and subsequently associates with IRE1α through
  its internal E/P domain, which leads to autophosphorylation and oligomerization
  of IRE1α followed by RNase-mediated splicing of XBP1 and kinase domain-mediated
  phosphorylation of MAPKs, thereby selectively promoting activation of the IRE1α
  signaling branch. Findings from this study are shown on a yellow background, whereas
  the known function of PRKCSH is shown on a white background
