caption: Schematic of the phosphoinositide cycle in the PM, Golgi, and ER. Phosphoinositides,
  lipid phosphatases, and lipid kinases are shown in the PM, ER, and Golgi. Enzymes
  are shown in blue, fatty acid tails as squiggly lines, inositol as a hexagon, and
  phosphate as small filled circles. In the PM, PtdIns is phosphorylated by PI4K to
  PtdIns4P, which then is phosphorylated to PtdIns(4,5)P2 by PIP5K. The phosphatases
  PtdIns4P–4-phosphatase (4-Pase) and PtdIns(4,5)P2–5-phosphatase (5-Pase) mediate
  dephosphorylation reactions. Activation of PLCβ hydrolyzes PtdIns(4,5)P2 to Ins(1,4,5)P3
  and DAG and may also act on PtdIns4P. Ins(1,4,5)P3 is dephosphorylated stepwise,
  the final step being catalyzed by a lithium-sensitive IMPase. Enzymes in the ER
  regenerate PtdIns, which can translocate to the PM or Golgi. Golgi PtdIns can be
  converted to PtdIns4P, which in turn goes to the PM to maintain PtdIns(4,5)P2. Reaction
  arrows are color-coded according to whether they were included in our first simulation
  model (black), our second model (black and gray), or neither (green). CDP, cytidine
  diphosphate; CDS, cytidine diphosphate DAG synthase; DGK, DAG kinase; IPPase, inositol
  polyphosphate phosphatase; PIS, PtdIns synthase.
