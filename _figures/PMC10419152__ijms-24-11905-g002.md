caption: 'Modulation of mammalian MAPK pathways by effector proteins: This figure
  depicts the various components of MAPK pathways targeted by the bacterial effector
  proteins. The inhibitory (red Ʇ) or stimulatory (green →) effects of bacterial effectors
  on specific MAPK components are shown. The effector proteins are color-coded based
  on the bacterial colors (see inset). Notably, bacterial effectors seem to target
  multiple components of the canonical but not of the non-canonical pathways. Additionally,
  TAK1, a major MAPK component, appears to be targeted by various effectors. The reason
  for that could be the predominant involvement of TAK1 in eliciting proinflammatory
  responses. MAPKs can be indirectly affected by effectors whose mechanism of action
  on MAPKs is unclear. Examples are represented by the A/E pathogen effector Map and
  the Cholerae effector VopE, which regulate MAPK activity by targeting mitochondria.
  Additionally, some effector effects on MAPKs have been researched in yeast cells.
  For simplicity, both cases of MAPK targeting modes are not depicted in the Figure
  but are described in the text. For a similar reason, we did not include the effects
  of secreted toxins'
