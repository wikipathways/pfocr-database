caption: 'Coagulation and complement cascades. a The coagulation branch of the hemostatic
  system. Coagulation takes place via the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The intrinsic
  pathway is initiated in vitro by contact activation of factor XII, in a plasma kallikrein-high
  molecular weight kininogen-dependent fashion (contact system). Triggering of the
  extrinsic pathway, which is considered the primary mode of in vivo coagulation,
  is tissue factor (TF) dependent and takes place on the surface of activated cells.
  The two pathways are based on the sequential activation of the coagulation factors,
  which converge in the catalytic generation of active thrombin by its zymogen proteinase.
  Thrombin is responsible for the proteolytic transformation of fibrinogen to fibrin
  and the subsequent generation of fibrin clots. The designation “a” following the
  various clotting factors represents a state of activation of the factors. Activated
  platelets have a major role in this process, as they can provide their negatively
  charged phospholipid area as a surface for initiation of coagulation. b Complement
  activation pathways. The components of complement system can be organized into three
  major pathways: the classical pathway is mainly initiated by the binding of C1q
  to antigen–antibody complexes, whereas the lectin pathway is triggered by binding
  of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins to glycosylated surfaces on microbial
  cell walls. Both pathways lead to the formation of a common C3 convertase, an enzyme
  complex with serine proteinase trypsin-like specificity. The alternative pathway,
  on the other hand, can be triggered by spontaneous hydrolysis of the internal thioester
  bond of C3, leading to the formation of C3H2O. This non-proteolytically activated
  form of C3 can lead to the formation of the alternative pathway C3 convertase by
  interacting with factors B and D. This convertase formation can be further induced
  and stabilized by properdin. C3 convertases generated by all pathways are able to
  cleave C3 into C3a and C3b, the latter of which forms additional convertases, thereby
  rapidly amplifying complement response. C3b vitally contributes to the clearance
  of pathogens by phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils) and is a major component
  of the C5 convertase, which in turn cleaves C5 to C5a and C5b. The anaphylatoxins
  C3a and C5a mediate the inflammatory responses of complement. C5b subsequently takes
  the lead in formation of the terminal C5b-9 complement complex, also called MAC,
  ultimately resulting into cell lysis. Potential roles in the proteolytic activation
  of C3 and C5 have also been assigned to non-complement proteinases, including enzymes
  of the coagulation and fibrinolysis cascades'
