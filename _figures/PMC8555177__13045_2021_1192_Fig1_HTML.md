caption: 'Integrin structure and integrin signalosome. a Schematic domain structure
  of a generic integrin. The α subunit contains 8 β-propeller domain repeats, a thigh
  domain, two calf domains (Calf-1 and Calf-2) and an α-tail domain. Notably, for
  9 out of 18 α subunits, there is an I-domain inserted between β propeller domains
  2 and 3. The β subunit typically comprises a plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain,
  an I-like domain followed by a β-sandwich hybrid domain, four cysteine-rich integrin
  epidermal growth factor-like (I-EGF) repeats and a β-tail domain. b Bidirectional
  integrin signalosome. Integrins exist in different conformational states that determine
  the receptor affinity for ECM components and other ligands: from a bent-closed (inactive)
  to an extended closed (active with low affinity) and finally to an extended open
  conformation (active with high affinity). When binding to ECM proteins, integrins
  are activated and clustered, and are capable of eliciting downstream signaling and
  controlling cellular responses to environmental cues (outside-in signaling). Integrins
  also response to an “inside-out signaling”, whereby Talin binding to the β integrin
  tail triggers conformational switch to an extended open state and further recruit
  integrin activating proteins such as Kindlins to activate integrin. The most well-studied
  hub pathway activated by integrins is focal adhesion kinase (FAK), with subsequent
  recruitment and activation of the Src family kinase (SFK), which ultimately affects
  cell behavior via crosstalk with many other signaling effectors. See text for details'
