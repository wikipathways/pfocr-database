caption: Autophagy inhibition in combination with other cancer treatments can potentiate
  overall treatment effectiveness and overcome resistance. One common cancer treatment
  involves the use of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway inhibitors, but tumor cells can adapt
  resistance to this therapeutic strategy. ERK inhibition can partially downregulate
  mTOR activity, leading to de-repression and activation of protective autophagy,
  which may partially explain tumor adaptation to ERK pathway inhibitors such MEK
  inhibitors. Combining an ERK inhibitor with both autophagy inhibition and mTOR inhibition
  can therefore overcome resistance pathways and increase overall response to these
  treatments.
