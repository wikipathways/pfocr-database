caption: Schematic representation of the proposed physiological role of paraventricular
  nucleus (PVN) Gαi2 proteins in salt resistance. In response to high dietary-sodium
  intake, upregulation of PVN Gαi2 proteins acts as peripherally sensed sodium-responsive
  “anti-hypertensive” pathway that mediates systemic sympathoinhibition, natriuresis
  and central anti-inflammatory responses to maintain normotension and a salt resistant
  phenotype. Image was generated using BioRender.
