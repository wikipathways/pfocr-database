caption: Mechanism of modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by coffee polyphenols.
  (a) Normal OFF state. The β-catenin degradation complex regulates the levels of
  β-catenin and controls its transcriptional activator activity (b) The normal ON
  state. The β-catenin degradation complex doesn’t work, β-catenin levels increase,
  and translocation to the nucleus possibility its transcriptional activity. The possible
  mechanism of modulation associated with coffee polyphenols; CGA (Chrologenic acid),
  TC (Toasted coffee), and GC (Gree coffee) decrease the levels of β-catenin in the
  cytoplasm and nucleus, possibly through a β-catenin degradation mediation and nuclear
  translocation inhibition. Figure adapted from [].
