caption: PTEN signaling pathway. Graphical representation of the differentially expressed
  genes in cultured myotubes compared to SM tissue and their molecular relationships.
  Genes are represented as nodes. Node color indicates the direction of change of
  gene expression. Downregulated genes are highlighted in green and upregulated genes
  in red. Color intensity corresponds to the magnitude of change. Nodes are displayed
  using various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product. The
  lines in between genes represent known interactions. The pathway image was created
  using IPA software.
