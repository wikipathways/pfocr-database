caption: Host innate immune responses during ADE. (i) Dengue fever immune complex
  can enter target cells through FcR to activate negative regulators, dihydroxyacetone
  kinase (DAK) and autophagy-related 5 autophagy-related 12(Atg5-Atg12), thereby destroying
  the RIG-I / MDA-5 signaling pathway. Including beta interferon promoter stimulator
  1 (IPS-1), inducible I-kappa B predominate kinase (IKKi), tumor necrosis factor
  receptor-associated factor 3(TRAF-3), and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-I), etc Eventually
  inhibit type I IFN production. (ii) The expression of TLR-3, -4, -7 and TLR signal
  molecules was down regulated when the immune complex entered the target cells, resulting
  in inhibition of NF-κB activity and negative regulation of TLR signal transduction
  activity. (iii) The binding of leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor B1 (LILRB1)
  with DENV virus inhibited the activation of Syk and eliminated the expression of
  ISG. Activated Syk upregulates IL10 via PI 3K/PKB, CREB signaling pathwayIL-10 stimulates
  the expression of SOCS3 and inactivates Janus kinase JAK-STAT signal, thus inhibiting
  the production of proinflammatory cytokines.IL-10 also inhibits the expression of
  nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by inhibiting the activities of STAT-1 and IRF-1, thus
  inhibiting the production of nitric oxide (NO).
