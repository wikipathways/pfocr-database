caption: Gene cluster mining and proposed biosynthetic pathway of globisporamic acid.
  (A) Genetic organizations of the BGCs of globisporamic acid and cinnamoyl moiety-containing
  compounds. The blue-shaded region represented the amino acid sequence alignment
  of PKS genes with their homologs. The chemical structure of the natural products
  from the corresponding BGCs was shown on the right. (B) Proposed biosynthetic process
  of globisporamic acid. The pathway putatively catalyzed by KS1-CLF1 (GlaE-GlaQ)
  or KS2-CLF2 (GlaF-GlaG) was highlighted in blue, while that catalyzed by KS3-CLF3
  (GlaJ-GlaK) was highlighted in green.
