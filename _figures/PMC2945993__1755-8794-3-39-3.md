caption: Regulation of the pathway for bile acid biosynthesis of both analyzed datasets.
  Red frame indicates up-regulation in at least one dataset, green frame down-regulation
  in at least one dataset, yellow frame up-regulation in the two respective datasets,
  and grey frame down-regulation in the two datasets, respectively, and grey frame
  no differential regulation in both datasets. The map was taken from KEGG []. The
  lower part of this pathway was mainly down-regulated to prevent degradation of steroids
  into bile acids, whereas the upper part was mainly up-regulated to support steroid
  metabolism.
