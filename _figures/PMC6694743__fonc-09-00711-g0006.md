caption: Physiopathology of JCPyV in the brain. JCPyV enter the brain and infects
  both phenotypes of glial cells, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, which results in
  the activation of the normally dormant protein Survivin, which results in the inhibition
  of apoptosis, a mechanism to dispose of virally infected cells. In oligodendrocytes,
  permissive to active infection, this allows time for JCPyV to complete its life
  cycle, which results in active viral replication in the nuclei, the formation of
  inclusion bodies, and the lytic destruction of the myelin producing cells end in
  Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy. In astrocytes, where the infection is
  abortive, no viral replication takes, but the viral oncoprotein T-Antigen is expressed.
  T-Antigen binds and inactivates p53 and pRb, crucial tumor suppressors and can affect
  important cell cycle regulator pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway, resulting
  in the activation of c-Myc. Infection with JCPyV also causes DNA damage, and by
  binding to IRS-1, the downstream protein if the IGF-1 pathway, it inhibits faithful
  DNA repair, forcing cells to repair their DNA via non-homologous end-joining, which
  results in mutations. All these are contributing factors of cellular transformation,
  which in certain individuals may results in the development of brain tumors.
