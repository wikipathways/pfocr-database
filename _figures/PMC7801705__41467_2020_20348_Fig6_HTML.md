caption: This translocation of IgA is regulated by WT NOD2 upon decrease of Dectin-1
  and Siglec-5 expression in M cells, ensuring proper homeostasis. This pathway is
  controlled by endosomal proteins such as EEA-1, Rab-5, and Rab-17. We would like
  to emphasize that this identified mechanism is likely one among others that is involved
  in the initiation and/or perpetuation of mucosal inflammation observed in CD patients.
