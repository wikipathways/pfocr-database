caption: Proposed model of action and mechanism by which CVB3 infection causes cardiomyocyte
  death. CVB3 infection causes cleavage of desmosomal cadherins by both CVB3 protease
  and virus-activated caspase, which leads to the direct damage of cardiomyocytes
  and the release of γ-catenin from the desmosomal complex to the cytosol, where it
  degrades through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. The degradation of γ-catenin
  benefits Wnt/β-catenin signaling and downregulates the IFN-β antiviral immune response,
  which promotes CVB3 replication and eventually causes cell death. Large arrows indicate
  up- or down-regulation.
