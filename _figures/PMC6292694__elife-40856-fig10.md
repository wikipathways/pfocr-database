caption: Following DNA damage stress, p53 rapidly promotes the transcription of numerous
  downstream targets involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Some
  p53 targets, such as the members of the sestrin family, cause a reduction in mTORC1
  activity, thus leading to TFEB and TFE3 activation. This p53-dependent activation
  of TFEB and TFE3 results in enhanced p53 signaling.
