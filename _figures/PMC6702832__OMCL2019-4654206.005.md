caption: Modulation of the NFE2L2 pathway in keratinocytes. Several compounds can
  potentiate the NFE2L2 response in keratinocytes leading to enhanced expression of
  antioxidant enzymes. The binding of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) to their receptors,
  activation of MAPK1 by D3T, and activation of AHR by ketoconazole all enhance NFE2L2
  transcriptional activity. On the other hand, ROS, formaldehyde, carbonitriles, sterols,
  and sulforaphane (SFN) lead to the release of NFE2L2 from KEAP1 mediating its activity
  each in its unique mechanism. Activated NFE2L2 will be translocated to the nucleus
  to interact with MAF and favor expression of antioxidant enzymes.
