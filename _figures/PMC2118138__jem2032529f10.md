caption: Potential mechanisms by which 12/15-LO may regulate ICSBP. Absence of 12/15-LO
  leads to increased PI3-K pathway activation, possibly via loss of inhibition of
  activators such as PDK1 or gain of activity of PTEN. PI3-K–dependent phosphorylation
  of ICSBP may reduce nuclear levels by diminished nuclear translocation, increased
  nuclear turnover, or both.
