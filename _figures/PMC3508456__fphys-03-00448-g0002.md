caption: Dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway. Microbial sulfate reduction relies
  on sequential catalytic reactions in which reduction of sulfate is coupled with
  oxidation of H2 or simple organic molecules. This anaerobic respiration pathway
  is less favorable thermodynamically than aerobic respiration.
