caption: 'Neuroprotective intracellular signaling pathways in the central nervous
  system involving TRPC6 activation. A detailed description of pathways is given in
  the 3rd, 4th and 5th sections. Presumably, TRPC6 may impede the extrasynaptic NR2B-containing
  NMDAR-dependent calcium influx via calcineurin-involving dephosphorylation mechanism
  (see the dashed lines). On the other hand, activation of synaptic NR2A-containing
  NMDAR may increase TRPC6 mRNA synthesis through a calcineurin/nuclear factor of
  activated T-cells-dependent pathway in cortical neurons (see the solid lines). Agonism
  of synaptic NMDAR has been proposed to underlie the activation of synaptoprotective
  store-operated calcium entry via TRPC6 in hippocampal silent synapses. TPRC6 is
  key component of store-operated calcium entry in hippocampal neurons. TRPC6 may
  be activated directly either by DAG or pharmacological agent such as hyperforin
  as well as by store-depletion (following IP3R activation). Upon store depletion
  of ER, the STIM2 detects calcium level reduction and activates Orai2/TRPC6 channels
  complex. Calcium entry via TRPC6-neuronal SOCE is needed to activate CaMKII, which
  can phosphorylate AMPAR. This promotes AMPARs trafficking to the post-synaptic membrane,
  which increases membrane depolarization and enhances NMDAR’s contribution to LTP
  maintenance. In addition, in neuronal tumor cells TRPC6-induced calcium entry is
  essential for the biosynthesis of endocannabinoids (2-AG, AEA) that have anti-inflammatory
  properties. Supposedly, neuroprotective effects are achieved by suppressing NF-κB
  via activation of the PPARγ. The binding of BDNF to TrkB results in the PLC-dependent
  activation of TRPC6. Calcium influx through TRPC6 may also activate CREB through
  three signal cascades: Ras/MEK/ERK, RAS/PI3K/Akt, and CaM/CAMKIV. Neuroprotective
  effect is achieved via CREB-dependent activation of the BDNF transcription. Moreover,
  in DGC and GABAergic interneurons TRPC6 may impact on Kv4.3 translocation to the
  neuronal membrane via ERK-dependent signaling (indicated by a wavy line). Kv4.3
  impedes fast-spiking in interneurons, and afterwards increases neuronal excitability
  in principal neurons. Thus, TRPC6 possibly plays a role in regulation of neuronal
  excitability. Finally, TRPC6-ERK1/2 neuroprotective signaling pathway has been also
  reported to protect DGC via facilitation of mitochondrial fission (indicated by
  a wavy line).'
