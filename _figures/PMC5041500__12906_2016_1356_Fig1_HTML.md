caption: The ERK signaling pathway. BDNF combines with its specific receptor Trk-B
  and the compound object can activate the Ras-dependent cascade. The Ras-dependent
  cascade is Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) can
  further phosphorylate CREB and promote the transcription of BDNF mRNA. PD98059 prevents
  the ERK1/2 from being phosphorylated. Activating reactions were depicted by an arrow
  with a black color and the inhibiting effect of PD98059 was depicted by a line with
  a red color. The proteins involved in the present study were marked by a rectangle
  box with a black color. BDNF brain-derived neurotrophic factor, CREB cAMP response
  element-binding protein, ERK1/2 extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, MEK ERK1/2
  kinase, p-CREB phosphor-CREB, p-ERK1/2 phosphor-ERK 1/2, Trk-B tyrosine receptor
  kinase B
