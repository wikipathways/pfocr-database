caption: DNAM-1 signaling pathway leading to natural killer (NK) cell activation.
  (A) NK cell, not interacting with target cell, is not functional. FOXO1 negatively
  controls, at transcriptional level, many NK cell effector functions, including the
  cell homing and late-stage maturation. (B) When the immunological synapse is established
  between a NK cell and a target cell, several activating signal pathways trigger
  NK cell activation, including those mediated by DNAM-1. Upon the engagement of DNAM-1
  with Nectin-2 or PVR activating ligands, expressed on the target cell, PKC phosphorylates
  the cytoplasmic domain of DNAM-1. At the same time ICAM-1, expressed on the target
  cell, binds LFA-1; thus promoting its conformational change; the recruitment of
  Fyn that phosphorylates the DNAM-1 cytoplasmic domain; and, as a consequence, the
  association of DNAM-1 with LFA-1. The DNAM-1 downstream signaling cascade leads
  to the phosphorylation of SLP-76 and Vav1, that induce the activation of PLCγ2 and,
  downstream, of ERK and AKT. This DNAM-1-dependent signaling cascade promotes the
  expression of genes involved in the degranulation and calcium (Ca2+) mobilization,
  leading to the NK cell activation. Activated AKT phosphorylates FOXO1, thus mediating
  the FOXO1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is degraded
  and inactivated. The expression of the immune checkpoint molecules TIGIT and CD96
  renders NK cell functionally exhausted, since both receptors compete with DNAM-1
  for the binding to the same activating ligands (indicated by black arrows).
