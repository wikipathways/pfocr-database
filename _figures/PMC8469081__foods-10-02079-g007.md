caption: Color, sucrose content, and chlorogenic acid content changes in sweet potato
  tuberous roots during 14 d of storage. The figure contains the metabolite map of
  the sucrose and chlorogenic acid synthesis pathway. The relative expression levels
  of C0, C14, and CS14 are shown as heat maps.
