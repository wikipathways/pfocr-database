caption: Pathways activated in metastatic cancers to relieve various microenvironmental
  stresses and therapeutic options to restore such stresses. The clockwise schematic
  diagrams list various molecular mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. (CAFs) Cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumor progression and metastasis by secreting supportive
  factors, such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Monoclonal antibody (Sibrotuzumab)
  and monoclonal antibody conjugated with cytotoxic drug maytansine (FAP5-DM1) target
  CAFs, while Dovitinib and monoclonal antibody GP369 inhibit FGF receptor. (ECM stiffness)
  Both tumor cells and the recruited CAFs increase collagen and fibronectin deposit
  to make a stiffer extracellular matrix (ECM). All-trans retinoic acid that deactivates
  CAFs and fibronectin neutralization antibody L19-TNF restore the ECM stress to inhibit
  metastasis. Other ECM targeting strategies including inhibitors against ECM-modifying
  enzymes such as lysyl oxidases (LOXs) and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), or against
  ECM receptors. (Hypoxia) Hypoxia is commonly observed in solid tumors. Although
  long-term hypoxia could inhibit metastasis by suppressing angiogenesis, intermittent
  hypoxia promotes metastasis via hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated pathways.
  Anti-metastasis agents that target HIFs (EZN-2968, Acriflavine, PT2385, and PT2399)
  or block HIF's transcriptional activity (Chetomin and Bortezomib) are under development.
  (Metabolic reprogramming) In addition to inducing hypoxia, HIFs also reprogram metabolic
  pathways by altering the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and enhancing glycolysis
  to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Such metabolic adaptation of metastatic
  cancer can be blocked by dichloroacetate (DCA) and metformin, which target pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and mitochondrial complex I, respectively, to influence
  TCA. In addition, 2-deoxyglucose treatment and targeting lactate dehydrogenase A
  reduce endogenous glycolysis. (Immunesurveillance) Tumor cells can be recognized
  and eliminated by immune cells such as NK and cytolytic T cells. Such immune stress
  inhibits tumor survival and distant metastasis, but tumor cells often develop multiple
  pathways to relieve the immune stress. First, tumor cells could modulate the microenvironment
  to enhance the inhibitory immune checkpoint pathway, and induce T-cell exhaustion.
  Meanwhile, tumor cells can inhibit immune cell activity by recruiting suppressive
  cell types, such as neutrophils and regulatory T cells. Tumor cells can also reduce
  antigen presentation to inhibit the immune recognition. A few therapeutic strategies
  have been approved by the FDA or are under development to restore immunosurveillance.
  These strategies include immune checkpoint blockade antibodies and agents that target
  T-cell intracellular pathways to reduce the exhaustion, engineered T cells (CAR-T
  and TCR-T) to enhance the T-cell activity and tumor recognition, oncolytic virus
  to induce proinformatory environment and enhance T-cell recognition and activity;
  and elevating tumor antigen presentation by targeting tumor intrinsic pathways,
  such as Panobinostat that inhibits histone deacetylases to restore human leukocyte
  antigen (HLA) class I antigen presentation machinery expression.
