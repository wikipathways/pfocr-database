caption: Schematic representation of multiple myeloma (MM) cell metabolism compared
  to normal plasma cells. Flow of metabolites is shown by colored arrows. Glycolysis,
  OXPHOS, serine synthesis pathway (SSP), glutaminolysis, fatty acid synthesis and
  fatty acid oxidation (β-oxidation) are all upregulated in MM cells compared to normal
  plasma cells, as indicated by red arrows. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and B (LDHB)
  are upregulated in MM cells. It is unclear whether the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) are up/downregulated in MM cells
  compared to normal plasma cells, as designated by question marks. MM cells express
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that increases bone marrow oxygenation
  by inducing angiogenesis. Increased bone marrow oxygenation may stimulate oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in MM cells. CD38-dependent nanotubes transport mitochondria
  from stromal cells to MM cells, mitochondrial fusion further sustains OXPHOS.
