caption: Schematic representation of the cellular response to ionizing radiation in
  Aβ42-induced AD models. Balancing between AKT and p38 pathway activation controls
  cellular responses to low- or high-dose ionizing radiation. Low-dose ionizing radiation
  induces beneficial effects against Aβ42-induced apoptosis through activation of
  AKT signaling and suppression of the p38 pathway in Aβ42-associated AD models.
