caption: The PIKK-driven DDR pathways in Trypanosomatid parasites and the canonical
  Eukaryotic pathways. (A) A schematic illustration of a simplified eukaryotic DDR
  pathway (left) compared to known or predicted components of the trypanosomatid DDR
  pathway (right). Dark shaded factors indicate that functional characterization has
  been performed in one or more organisms. Light shading indicates limited data availability.
  White indicates no data are available or the factor is not present in the genome,
  as further illustrated by question marks. For more intricate details on eukaryotic
  DDR factors and pathways, we encourage the reader to refer to recent reviews (;
  ; ; ; ; ). DSB, double-stranded break; DDR, DNA damage response; ssDNA, single-stranded
  DNA. (B) Summary table of PKs and their associated families in T. brucei, T. cruzi,
  and L. mexicana. Data collated from , , and . (*) = the pseudokinases in T. brucei
  are included among the counts for the other families and their respective numbers
  have not been adjusted to remove pseudokinase family members. N/A = no kinases have
  been identified as members of these kinase families.
