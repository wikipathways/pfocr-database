caption: 'Schematic illustration of the effects of EC‐EVs in sepsis‐related ALI/ARDS.
  In extra‐pulmonary sepsis, the number of VCAM1+ EVs released by endothelial cells
  was increased, and they were preferentially taken up by monocytes in the lung. VCAM1,
  highly expressed on these EVs, activates the NF‐κB pathway by acting on ITGA4, thus
  promoting the differentiation of monocytes into M1‐type macrophages. The latter
  secreted much proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, recruiting more inflammatory
  cells to amplify the inflammatory response and further exacerbate ALI. EC: endothelial
  cell; Mo: monocyte; PMN: polymorphonuclear neutrophil; RBC: red blood cell; Mo‐Mφ:
  monocyte‐derived macrophage; TR‐Mφ: tissue resident macrophages; MVB: multivesicular
  body'
