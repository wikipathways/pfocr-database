caption: PDC113.824-mediated biased signaling effects through FP receptor. PGF2α induces
  ERK1/2 activation via Gαq, and actin reorganization and contraction through Gα12.
  PDC113.824 increases the coupling of the FP receptor to Gαq, which increases PGF2α-mediated
  activation of PKCβI and ERK1/2 (i.e. acts as a positive allosteric modulator, PAM).
  In contrast, PDC113.824 reduces PGF2α-induced cytoskeletal reorganization, modulation
  of cell ruffling, and myometrial cell contraction via decreased coupling of FP to
  Gα12 (i.e. acts as a negative allosteric modulator, NAM). FP receptor-mediated activation
  of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) and production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) promotes
  intracellular Ca2+ release, which stimulates Ca2+-dependent, calmodulin-mediated
  activation of myosin light chain kinase and subsequent phosphorylation of myosin
  light chain to promote smooth muscle cell contraction. Activation of the Rho-ROCK
  pathway through Gα12 facilitates inhibitory regulation of the myosin light chain
  (MLC) phosphatase and the increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation, which
  maintains the cell in the contracted state ().
