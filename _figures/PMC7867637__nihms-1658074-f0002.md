caption: The fibrogenic effects of hyperglycemia may involve several distinct mechanisms,
  including activation of neurohumoral pathways, induction and activation of growth
  factors (such as TGF-β and PDGFs), stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such
  as TNF-α and IL-1β), generation of AGEs, induction of surface integrins and secretion
  of matricellular proteins (such as TSP-1, SPARC and CCN2). A central pathway involved
  in fibroblast activation in response to high glucose involves the generation of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, high glucose may disrupt DNA repair, thus
  accentuating the effects of ROS on DNA damage and promoting cellular senescence,
  inflammatory activation and fibrosis. In response to high glucose fibroblasts proliferate,
  and undergo activation, secreting collagens, proteases and antiproteases involved
  in matrix remodeling, and matricellular proteins. Although in vitro studies have
  suggested that high glucose may enhance fibroblast to myofibroblast conversion,
  to what extent diabetic fibrosis is dependent on myofibroblasts (vs. activated fibroblasts)
  remains unknown.
