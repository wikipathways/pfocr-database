caption: Model for the roles of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis during SGIV infection.
  The de novo fatty acid biosynthetic pathway was utilized through SGIV infection.
  Inhibition of ACC1 (converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA), FASN (catalysis malonyl
  CoA with acetyl-CoA to generate palmitate) and fatty acid β-oxidation significantly
  decreased SGIV replication. Key FAs synthesis enzymes and processes are shown in
  blue. Inhibitors and siRNA are shown in dark green.
