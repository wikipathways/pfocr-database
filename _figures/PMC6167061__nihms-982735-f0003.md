caption: Diagrams of a dendrite, showing possible explanations for the 1- to 2-hour
  delay before antidepressant actions of ketamine and related N-methyl-D-aspartate
  (NMDA) receptor blockers. Ketamine exerts at least some of these antidepressant
  effects via increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secretion (,,,),
  and we therefore diagram mechanisms leading to BDNF secretion. Brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor secretion presumably requires depolarization, which may explain the requirement
  for 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA) receptor activation
  (). Note that dendritic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi are thought to be simpler
  than the somatically located organelles shown in previous figures. The selective
  NMDA receptor 2B antagonist Ro 25-6981 had similar effects to ketamine (). The transcription
  of BDNF is not required (as shown by insensitivity to actinomycin D), but its synthesis
  is required (as shown by sensitivity to anisomycin). In hippocampus, ketamine and
  NMDA, in the absence of neuronal activity, led to dephosphorylation of eukaryotic
  elongation factor (eEF2) (also called calcium/calmodulin-dependent eukaryotic elongation
  factor 2 kinase), but only ketamine produced this effect in cortex. Rottlerin and
  NH125, which inhibit several kinases including eEF2 kinase, also had BDNF-dependent
  antidepressant activity. (A) An outside-in mechanism, downstream from NMDA receptor
  block. Ketamine binds within the NMDA receptor pore but does not enter the neuron.
  The data have generally been interpreted in light of the knowledge that ketamine
  blocks spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents through NMDA receptors
  (). It is implied that decreased Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors begins the transduction
  pathway leading to effects on presynaptic or postsynaptic efficiency. (B) Possible
  inside-out mechanisms, resulting from intracellular binding to nascent NMDA receptors.
  Existing data show that ligands can act as pharmacological chaperones for glutamate
  receptors within the ER (), analogous to experiments in which nicotine acts as a
  pharmacological chaperone for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Two possible sequelae
  could lead to increased BDNF secretion. First, enhanced ER exit would decrease ER
  stress, for instance by decreasing phosphorylated protein kinase R-like ER-localized
  eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase (pPERK). This would decrease phosphorylated
  eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α), increasing synthesis of ER proteins,
  including BDNF, thus producing the observed BDNF increase. Activation of NMDA receptors
  increases ER stress markers such as eIF2α phosphorylation and CCAAT/enhancer-binding
  protein homologous protein (CHOP) (). However, it is not known whether blockade
  of NMDA receptors by ketamine has any effect on eIF2α phosphorylation in the absence
  of ER stress. This would be a key test of the chaperoning-ER stress hypothesis.
  Blockade by MK-801 did decrease caspase-12 activation, even in the absence of ER
  stress; however, caspase-12 activation may occur in a pathway distinct from ER stress
  (). Second, an escort effect of intracellular ketamine-NMDA receptor binding arises
  from the fact that both NMDA receptors and BDNF are trafficked via a nonstandard
  ER and Golgi vesicle pathway involving synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) and
  calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) (,). Additional knowledge
  about the synapse-associated protein 97-calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein
  kinase trafficking pathway is crucial for evaluating the escort hypothesis. Chaperoning
  and/or matchmaking would occur in the ER. Escorting would occur when both the NMDA
  receptor and BDNF bind to Sec24 or at a later step. BiP, immunoglobulin binding
  protein; COPI and COPII, vesicle coat protein I and II complex; CSF, cerebrospinal
  fluid; IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme 1; mRNA, messenger RNA; p-eEF2, phosphorylated
  eukaryotic elongation factor.
