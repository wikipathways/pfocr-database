caption: The tumor microenvironment in endometrial cancer. Two different mechanisms
  of immune resistance mediated by the IDO1 enzyme activity and expression in the
  TME in endometrial cancer. (Left) IDO1 is constitutively expressed in cancer cells
  (intrinsic or primary resistance) typically in non-inflamed tumors, such as endometrial
  and ovarian cancers. This expression prevents the accumulation of the activated
  antitumor CD8+ T cells, thus inducing an immunosuppressive TME. (Right) IDO1 is
  induced in endometrial cells (IDO + EC cells) and other cell types (stromal and
  endothelial cells) by IFN-γ released by neighboring activated T or NK cells in the
  context of a negative feedback loop (adaptive or acquired resistance). EC, endometrial
  cancer; IDO1, indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1; PD-L1, programmed death-ligand 1; TCR,
  T-cell receptor; TME, tumor microenvironment.
