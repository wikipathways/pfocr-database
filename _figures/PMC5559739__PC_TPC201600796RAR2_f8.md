  for polyprenol biosynthesis. Polyprenols, as well as other -derived isoprenoids,
  are incorporated into the thylakoid membranes and also into the envelope membranes
  of plastids. Intermediates: farnesyl diphosphate, ; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate,

  multiple steps in the biosynthetic pathway. ω and α represent the terminal isoprene
  units in dolichols and polyprenols.'
