caption: 'Schematic of the intracellular delivery of EV-mimetic with RNAi cargo to
  OC. Increased targeting of therapeutic EV-mimetic to OC cells and extension of their
  half-life of EV-mimetic in extracellular space can be achieved by coating EV-mimetics
  with molecules that enable specific targeting of tumor cells (such as EGF) or with
  molecules that enable escape of phagocytosis by macrophages (synthetic peptide CD47).
  Interaction of CD47 with SIRPα receptor on macrophages (MΦ) impedes the clearance
  of EV-mimetics and enhances accumulation in target tissue (1). After encountering
  the target cell, the EV-mimetic is typically bound to its surface via cell-surface
  receptors, integrins, etc. After establishing an interaction with the cell surface,
  EV-mimetics can be taken up by the OC cell via two mechanisms of internalization:
  firstly, involving direct fusion with the plasma membrane (2) or secondly via endocytosis;
  whereby EV-mimetics are taken up by early endosome (3). siRNA cargo is released
  into the cytoplasm (4). siRNA recognize and degrade targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs)
  (5). This in turn leads to the suppression of OC and increases overall survival
  (6). Early endosomes will gradually transform into late endosomes (7) and possible
  release of siRNA to the cytoplasm (8). Further down the endocytic pathway, endosomes
  fuse with lysosomes, consequently cargo that has not been released to the cytoplasm
  will be degraded (9). Adapted from O’Brien et al. [].'
