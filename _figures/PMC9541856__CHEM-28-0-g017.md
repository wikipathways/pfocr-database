caption: Photocatalytic reaction mechanism in a Jablonski type diagram (left, vertical
  axis represents a relative energy scale) and the structures of photocatalysts with
  increasing IHAE (right). DIPEA as a sacrificial electron donor (Ssac) reacts either
  with the excited singlet or triplet state of the deazaflavin initiating either the
  unproductive (red) or productive (blue) pathway. In the unproductive pathway a singlet‐born
  spin‐correlated radical pair, 1[dFlsq,Ssac.+], is formed after eT, which recombines
  faster than it is formed. In contrast, in the productive pathway eT to the triplet
  state results in a triplet‐born radical pair, 3[dFlsq,Ssac.+], allowing the accumulation
  of the considerably stable dFlsq. A second photon can be absorbed by dFlsq enabling
  a consecutive photo‐induced electron transfer from dFlsq* to the substrate, (EDG)Ar−Br/Cl/F,
  regenerating dFlox in its ground state, closing the photocatalytic cycle, and initiating
  dehalogenation. The concentration of Ssac is decisive on the systems′ reaction pathway,
  where the enhancement of the ISC by the IHAE promotes the productive pathway via
  the triplet manifold. Bromine in the deazaisoalloxazine moiety provides maximal
  ISC, but photodissociates after prolonged illumination.
