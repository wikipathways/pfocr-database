caption: 'Protein networks around RXFP2 (red). A: Two most enriched Gene Ontology
  (GO) biological pathways were “cellular response to glucagon stimulus” (GNB1, GNB4,
  GNB2, and GNB3) and “positive regulation of cAMP biosynthetic process” (RXFP2, RLN2
  [relaxin], AVPR2, and INSL3), with false discovery rates 4.6 ×10−5 and 2.8 ×10−4,
  respectively. Protein network was generated with STRING, version 10.5, selecting
  all active interaction sources, minimum required interaction score 0.90 (highest
  confidence), and no more than 10 interactions. B: Only database interaction sources
  were selected with minimum required interaction score 0.90 (highest confidence)
  and no more than 10 interactions. Six out of 11 proteins in this network belong
  to “positive regulation of cAMP biosynthetic process” (GO biological process), which
  was the most enriched pathway in this network, connecting proteins RXFP2, GIPR,
  GCG, ADCYAP1, MC1R, and FSHR (false discovery rate 1.3 ×10−8). Of note is that gastric
  inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) and glucagon (GCG) present in this protein
  network have a high relevance in glucose homeostasis and diabetes.'
