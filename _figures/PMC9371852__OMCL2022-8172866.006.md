caption: The summarization of the effect of apigenin in cSCC cell lines. After treatment
  with apigenin, the MAPK signaling pathway was activated gradually through the form
  of phosphorylation, especially the ERK1/2 pathway. Then, Phospho-MAPK from the cytoplasm
  to nucleus may generally downregulate the expression of Srx by inhibiting the expression
  of Nrf2. Then, apigenin might induce cell apoptosis in cSCC cells.
