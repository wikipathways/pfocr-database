caption: Pro-inflammatory cytokines induce POSTN expression, revealing the underlying
  mechanism of many chronic inflammatory diseases. (1) POSTN cross-talks with TNF-α
  or IL-1α derived from epithelial cells or inflammatory cells to induce various chemokines/inflammatory
  cytokines, including IL-1β, by activating the NF-κB pathway in fibroblasts; this
  leads to the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, which accelerates pulmonary
  fibrosis. (2) The pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17 work synergistically
  to promote the expression of POSTN in order to induce liver inflammatory injury
  eventually leading to fibrosis. (3) POSTN overexpression promotes caspase 1-mediated
  pyroptosis by activating NLRP3 in MIRI. (4) POSTN promotes the migration and osteogenic
  differentiation of PDLSCs by activating the JNK signaling pathway in response to
  inflammatory stimuli.
