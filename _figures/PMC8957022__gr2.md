caption: 'Analysis Pipeline. Step1: Signature Generation: Initially, each GSE dataset
  is processed with Limma R package to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
  This is done for each stage of AD separately; Braak stage I-II (incipient), Braak
  stage III-IV (moderate), Braak stage V-VI (severe). Step 2: Drug repurposing: The
  generated lists of over- (top 150) and under-expressed genes (top 150) are used
  as input in the four drug repurposing tools. Top 50 drugs were selected from each
  tool from each dataset. Step 3: Drug Re-ranking: A three-branch approach is then
  followed: the network-based approach, which ranks drugs based on a normalized CT
  score (see Methods), the CoDRes (Composite Drug Reranking Scoring) re-ranking of
  candidate repurposed drugs and the drug permeability through the BBB using the tool
  LightBBB. Top 10 drugs per stage (incipient, moderate and severe) were selected,
  comprising a group of 26 drugs. Step 4: Structural clustering and target identification:
  hierarchical clustering of the 26 candidate repurposed drugs was performed. Moreover,
  the current status of candidate repurposed drugs in clinical trials was recorder.
  Finally, drug targets of our elite candidate repurposed drugs were detected. Step
  5: Functional analysis: Pathway analysis of drug targets of our elite candidate
  repurposed drugs as well as pathway analysis of top-curated genes of AD from DisGeNET
  was performed to detect pathways that are strongly connected to the disease.'
