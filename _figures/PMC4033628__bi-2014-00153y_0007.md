caption: Synthesis of representative core M3 structures that are dependent on multiple
  initial activities based in the ER. Evidence suggests that phosphorylation of position
  6 of O-mannose that is dependent on β1,4-GlcNAc extension precludes β1,2-GlcNAc
  addition in the Golgi. Core M3 is the only core known to be modified with the α-DG
  functional glycan structure. Various steps as well as the structures ultimately
  built have not been fully elucidated. See Figure  for the monosaccharide code legend.
