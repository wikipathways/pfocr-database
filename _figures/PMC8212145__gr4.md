caption: Results for CPTAC breast cancer(A) A subgraph of the correlation-based causal
  network with phospho regulations focused on the upstream regulators of proteins
  that are implicated in breast cancer as provided by the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census
  (CGS) database. There are 43 genes in CGS annotated with breast cancer, for 11 of
  which we identify phosphorylation regulators.(B) Subgraph of the correlation-based
  causal network with expression regulations where RNA-seq changes are explained by
  upstream proteomic changes, focused on the neighborhood of proteins with significant
  downstream.(C) Luminal A and luminal B subtypes are collectively compared with the
  basal-like subtype. Only the ESR1 downstream relations are shown.
