caption: Scheme illustrating the main hippocampal mechanisms observed in the diabetes-related
  depression. The hippocampus represents a site of convergence for cellular and molecular
  changes observed in diabetes-associated depression. At the cellular level, there
  is an increase in the reactivity of astrocytes and microglia, a reduction in hippocampal
  neurogenesis, apoptosis of pyramidal neurons, and synaptic plasticity with dendritic
  retraction. At the molecular level, there is an increase in glucocorticoid signaling,
  a reduction in BDNF production, an increase in mGluR2/3 activity leading to caspase
  3 activation and an increase in the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, with an
  augmentation in reactive oxygen species and transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  such as TNF-α, production. Together these pathways regulate gene transcription,
  increasing inflammation and apoptosis and decreasing progenitor proliferation, which
  in turn promotes a decrease in the hippocampal size.

  description: Scheme illustrating the main hippocampal mechanisms observed in the
    diabetes-related depression. The hippocampus represents a site of convergence
    for cellular and molecular changes observed in diabetes-associated depression.
    At the cellular level, there is an increase in the reactivity of astrocytes and
    microglia, a reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis, apoptosis of pyramidal neurons,
    and synaptic plasticity with dendritic retraction. At the molecular level, there
    is an increase in glucocorticoid signaling, a reduction in BDNF production, an
    increase in mGluR2/3 activity leading to caspase 3 activation and an increase
    in the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, with an augmentation in reactive oxygen
    species and transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, production.
    Together these pathways regulate gene transcription, increasing inflammation and
    apoptosis and decreasing progenitor proliferation, which in turn promotes a decrease
    in the hippocampal size.
