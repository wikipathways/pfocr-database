caption: The two distinct base-excision-repair pathways in mammalian cells. To repair
  a modified base, the glycosylic bond linking the deoxyribose (dR) and the damaged
  base (G*) is excised via glycosylase (1) to generate an abasic (AP)-site intermediate.
  The damaged base can also be released spontaneously, without enzyme. The DNA backbone
  5′ to the AP site is cleaved by AP endonuclease in Step 2, to generate a single-stranded
  break with 3′ hydroxyl and 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) termini that can be repaired
  by one of two pathways. In the classical pathway, dRP is removed by DNA polymerase-β
  (DNA pol-β; 3a) followed filling of the one-nucleotide gap (4a) and DNA ligation
  (5). The alternative pathway (3b and 4b), which occurs in the absence of functional
  DNA pol-β, involves repair synthesis by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),
  DNA pol-δ or -ε and flip endonuclease (FEN). AP endonuclease, DNA pol-β and DNA
  ligase I form a multiprotein complex in which DNA ligase I can be replaced by DNA
  ligase III plus complementary factor XRCC1.
