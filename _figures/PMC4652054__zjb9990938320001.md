caption: Proposed O-antigen repeating unit synthesis pathway of E. coli serotype O104
  involving sialyltransferase WbwA. In the proposed O104 antigen pathway, WecA may
  transfer GalNAc-phosphate from UDP-GalNAc to undecaprenol-phosphate (P-Und). Alternatively,
  GlcNAc-phosphate is transferred and 4-epimerase forms GalNAcα-PP-Und, the substrate
  for WbwC. WbwC then adds a Gal residue in β1-3 linkage to GalNAc-PP-Und. WbwA transfers
  sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid to the Gal residue of Galβ1-3GalNAc-PP-Und. Further
  conversion is catalyzed by yet uncharacterized α4-Gal-transferase WbwB and putative
  sialate O-acetyltransferase WckD to synthesize the O104 antigen repeating unit d-Galα1-4Neu5,7,9Ac3α2-3-d-Galβ1-3-d-GalNAc.
  Flippase Wzx transfers the oligosaccharide to the periplasm, where it is polymerized
  by polymerase Wzy to form the O antigen. Chain-length terminator Wzz may help to
  restrict the number of repeating units assembled by polymerase. The O antigen is
  then ligated to the outer core structure of the growing lipopolysaccharide by ligase
  WaaL. The Lpt complex extrudes LPS to the outer membrane.
