caption: Tan and Ebony regulate the β-alanine conjugation and hydrolysis of dopamine
  to β-alanyl dopamine. In the lamina and possibly in the distal medulla, they also
  regulate the comparable conjugation of histamine to β-alanyl histamine (ebony) and
  its subsequent hydrolysis (tan) to yield free histamine. In both cases, conjugation
  requires β-alanine, which is also liberated during hydrolysis, along with the corresponding
  amine. Synthesis of β-alanine from aspartate or uracil by decarboxylation is under
  the control of the gene black.
