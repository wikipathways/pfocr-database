caption: The major ascending routes through which gustatory and visceral signals are
  transmitted from the periphery to the hindbrain and forebrain are illustrated. Blue
  lines represent the putative gustatory pathways. Red lines represent the putative
  visceroceptive pathways. Although these two sources of input ascend the central
  nervous system (CNS) in a roughly parallel manner, there are some notable distinctions.
  For instance, it appears that neurons originating in the caudal (visceral) NTS project
  to key structures in the forebrain in two distinct ways. One comprises a set of
  direct projections to several subnuclei in hypothalamus, the amygdala, the ventral
  tegmental area (VTA), the nucleus accumbens, just to name a few. The other pathway
  ultimately reaches many of these same ventral forebrain structures, but through
  a relay in lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN). A second putatively visceroceptive
  pathway emerges from the lPBN as well. These afferents project to the thalamus [ventroposterolateral
  parvicellular (VLMpc)] and, from there, to insular cortex (IC) [i.e., visceral cortex
  (VC)]. The functional relevance of this, both with respect to the separate pathways
  and to the redundancies, remains to be more fully elucidated, but there is some
  evidence that these populations are involved in different aspects of ingestive behavior.
  Additionally, cNTS neurons project to medullary motor nuclei, presumably to subserve
  various digestive reflexes. A subpopulation of gustatory neurons in the rostral
  nucleus of the solitary tract (rNTS) likewise project locally to motor nuclei, which
  are involved in oromotor, salivatory, and digestive reflexes, while a separate population
  of gustatory neurons originating in the rNTS terminate in the parabrachial nucleus
  (PBN), primarily the medial PBN (mPBN). From there, two forebrain-projecting gustatory
  pathways emerge. Some neurons in the mPBN project to the thalamus [ventroposteromedial
  parvicellular (VPMpc)] and then onto the gustatory cortex (GC), terminating in close
  proximity to VC. In general, the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)→PBN→thalamus→IC
  pathway maintains a rough topographic organization throughout. The second pathway
  that emerges from the mPBN targets various ventral forebrain structures, with particularly
  dense inputs to the central amygdala (CeA) and the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Spinal
  afferents from the gut appear to be highly connected to many of these same structures
  (here represented in dark red arrows). These neurons synapse in the caudal NTS,
  reticular formation (RF), lPBN, and several subnuclei with the thalamus (and then
  onto various cortical structures including IC). The visceroceptive afferents of
  the spinal system reach the amygdala (in particular, the CeA) and the hypothalamus
  by way of these various tracts. There is also suggestion of direct spino-hypothalamic
  and spino-amygdalar tracts. Blood-borne signals (e.g., physiological, metabolic,
  inflammatory, and toxin-related) are also sensed in circumventricular organs (CVOs)
  of the hindbrain and forebrain [e.g., area postrema (AP), median eminence (me),
  subfornical organ, and the vascular organ of lamina terminalis]. For clarity’s sake,
  some projections were omitted, including projections from cNTS to ventrolateral
  medulla, mPBN and lPBN to the RF, PBN to zona incerta, PBN to substantia inominata,
  VPMpc to amygdala, among others. It is important to note these routes are color-coded
  according to their presumptive role (gustatory vs. visceral), but in many cases,
  this has yet to be confirmed with functional measures. Moreover, this schematic
  does not show pathways of cross-talk among cells within a particular brain area;
  such local connections likely represent a significant means of integrative processing.
