caption: 'Visualization of parallels between apparent respective redundancy in terpenoid
  and shikimate pathways. Although they both produce IPP and DMAPP, the MEP and MVA
  pathways of terpenoid synthesis (left panel) differ in localization, substrate source,
  and physiological function. A similar scenario is proposed as part of the shikimate
  Dual Pathway Hypothesis (right panel). For simplicity, intercompartmental transport
  and metabolic interconnections between central catabolic (glycolysis, pentose phosphate
  pathway) and anabolic (Calvin-Benson cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis)
  processes are omitted from schematic. Abbreviations not described elsewhere in the
  manuscript: GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; Pyr, pyruvate.'
