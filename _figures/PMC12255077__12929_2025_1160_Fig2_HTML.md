caption: ARs and second messengers signalling pathway activated by extracellular adenosine.
  Each of the four ARs is characterized by the activation of characteristic signal
  pathways that define the quality of the cellular response. Some common molecules
  stimulated by ADO are, activation of MAPKs such as p38, ERK1/2, stimulation of increased
  intracellular Ca2+ levels, cAMP activation, and activation of PKC and activation
  or inhibition of PKA. Of course, the final outcomes of AR activation depend on the
  interaction of the signaling pathways and the type of cell involved and its state. "Created
