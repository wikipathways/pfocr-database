  Orange region indicates C6C3-compounds; Yellow region indicates C6C1-compounds;
  Purple region indicates a class of metabolites. Red indicates the key enzymes, the
  following abbreviations are used for different pathway enzymes: CM (chorismate mutase),
  ICS (isochorismate synthase), PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), C4H (trans-cinnamate
  4-monooxygenase), and AS (amyrin synthase). The solid-line arrow represents one-step
  reaction, and dashed-line arrow means multi-steps reactions.'
