caption: Diagrammatic presentation of regulation of Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. Under
  the oxidative stress condition, disruption of the Keap1 dimer occurs due to the
  mutation on ser-104 residue of BTB/POZ domain of Keap1 []. In turn protein kinase
  C phosphorylates Nrf2–Neh2 domain at ser-40 residue, which is essentially required
  for complete release of Nrf2 from Keap1 dimer into the cytoplasm []. The free form
  of Nrf2 showed disabled NES motifs and activation of NLS. The NESTA, which was disabled
  due to the sulphhydryl modification on C183 residue, caused steric hindrance upon
  interaction with Crm1/exportin []. The NESZIP motif, however, turned off due to
  the masking of export sequences when Nrf2 heterodimerize with small Maf proteins
  within the nucleus []. NLS motif on Nrf2 is recognized by the importin a5 and ß1
  receptor homology on nuclear membrane for entering into the nucleus [,]. Within
  the nucleus, core sequence (5'-TGACnnm GC-3’) of cis-acting regulatory element ARE
  binds to the Nrf2 (5'-TGA(C/G)TCA-3') with a complementary sequence homology. The
  Nrf2–ARE regulates transcription of antioxidants and phase II detoxifying enzymes
  which in turn play important role in cellular defence. Upon achieving redox homeostasis,
  the Keap1 independently enters into the nucleus via the receptor importin alpha-7
  (also known as KPNA6) recognized by the C-terminal Kelch repeats having NLS motifs.
  The nuclear Keap1 mediates Nrf2 dissociation from ARE. Subsequently, Nrf2 NES activation
  directs the exporting of Keap1–Nrf2 complex out of the nucleus via Crm1/exportin
  []. The Keap1–Nrf2 complex bind to the Cul3–E3 ligase ubiquitin core complex within
  the cytosol resulting in further ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2.
