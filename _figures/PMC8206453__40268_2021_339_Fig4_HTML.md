caption: AffiMab treatment induces downregulation of housekeeping pathways and upregulation
  of cancer-related pathways. Differential expression and a gene set enrichment analysis
  was carried out on cells treated with AffiMabs, trastuzumab, and controls. The ErbB
  pathway was significantly upregulated after treatment with any of the two AffiMabs
  compared with trastuzumab. On the gene level, notably HER3/ErbB3 and PI3K were significantly
  upregulated, whereas EGFR/ErbB1, HER2/ErbB2, and HER4/ErbB4 were not. Housekeeping
  function pathways were significantly downregulated. Among these were metabolic pathways
  such as the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways, cell division pathways such
  as cell cycle and DNA replication, and protein synthesis pathways, such as ribosome
  and RNA polymerase. EGFR epidermal growth factor receptor, HER3 human epidermal
  growth factor receptor 3, P13K phosphoinositide 3 kinase
