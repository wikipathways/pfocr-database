caption: '(A) Predicted compound-target interactions between 33 major components in
  SND and CVD targets. (B) Predicted interaction network between the three selected
  constituents (aconitine, liquiritin and 6-gingerol) and CVD targets. Squares represent
  targets, and circles represent compounds. Different colors are used to distinguish
  targets from different physiological systems and constituents from different herbs:
  (Outer ring) Constituents from Aconitum carmichaeli are colored in cyan, from Glycyrrhiza
  uralensis are magenta colored and from Zingiber officinale are colored in blue;
  (Inner squares) Targets in autonomic nervous system are colored in pink, in coagulation
  pathway are colored in purple, and in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are colored
  in yellow. In addition, the sizes of the squares refer to the number of interactions.
  The edges stand for the interactions: blue dashed edges stand for the interactions
  without validation; green solid edges stand for the validated interactions.'
