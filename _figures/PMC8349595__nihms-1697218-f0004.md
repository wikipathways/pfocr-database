caption: One-Carbon Metabolism (OCM). In the folate cycle, a methyl group is transferred
  from serine to THF by serine hydroxymethyl-transferase, with pyridoxal phosphate
  (PLP) as a coenzyme, forming 5,10-methylene-THF. This is either used for the synthesis
  of thymidylate or is reduced to 5-methyl-THF. 5-methyl-THF is the most prevalent
  form of naturally occurring dietary folate. Fortification of foods uses the synthetic
  and chemically stable form of folate, folic acid (FA), which can be reduced by dihydrofolate
  reductase to THF. The methyl group of 5-methyl-THF is transferred to homocysteine
  in a reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase (MTR) and utilizing B12 as a cofactor,
  generating methionine and THF. Alternatively, in the liver, betaine can donate a
  methyl group for the remethylation of homocysteine in a reaction catalyzed by betaine
  homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). Methionine adenosyltransferase enzymes activate
  methionine to form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor for numerous acceptors,
  including arsenicals, guanidinoacetate (GAA, the precursor to creatine), and DNA,
  in reactions that involve substrate-specific methyltransferase enzymes. These methylation
  reactions generate the methylated products and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a potent
  product inhibitor of most methyltransferases. SAH is hydrolyzed to generate homocysteine
  which is either remethylated to regenerate methionine or is directed to the transsulfuration
  pathway and to glutathionine synthesis. (Inset) Betaine can either be obtained from
  the diet or can be generated through endogenous synthesis from choline. However,
  because choline is synthesized de novo through a pathway in which PEMT catalyzes
  three sequential SAM-dependent methylation reactions, endogenous choline synthesis
  is a significant consumer of SAM. PEMT uses three molecules of SAM to synthesize
  phosphatidyl choline (PC) from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and is transcriptionally
  regulated by estrogen.
