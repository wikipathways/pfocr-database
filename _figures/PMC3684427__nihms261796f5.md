caption: 'The regulation of clot formation (colored entities). Steps discussed in
  previous figures are in gray. Regulation checkpoints during coagulation include
  tissue factor (TF), Factors VIIIa and Va, and Factor Xa. If these are inhibited,
  then thrombin production essentially stops. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)
  blocks the TF pathway. The protein C pathway blocks Factors VIIIa and Va. This pathway
  creates the activated protein C (APC) enzyme by the combined contributions of the
  endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), thrombin, and thrombomodulin (TM) on cell
  surfaces. With the help of protein S (PS), APC cleaves the VIIIa and Va cofactors,
  which slows clotting by orders of magnitude. The drug Xigris® is recombinant human
  APC and is effective in patients with severe sepsis. Antithrombin is the natural
  inhibitor of several coagulation enzymes, including Factors IXa and Xa and thrombin.
  Its activity is accelerated by heparin and becomes specific for Factor Xa with low-molecular-weight
  (LMW) heparin. Hirudin is derived from leeches and inhibits only thrombin. Dysfunctional
  coagulation is common in sepsis patients, and the challenge is to prevent clot formation
  without increasing the risk of bleeding. Abbreviations: FDP, fibrin degradation
  product; PAR, protease-activated receptor; TAT, thrombin-antithrombin complex.'
