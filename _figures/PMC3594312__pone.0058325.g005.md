caption: (a) Up-regulated genes in heat-exposed siLuc-transfected cells (Group 2 in
  Fig. 3A). This group comprises anti-apoptotic genes such as NFκB pathway related
  genes, AHR and NR1D1; (b) Up-regulated genes in heat-exposed siDNA-PKcs-transfected
  cells (Group 3 in Fig. 3A). This group comprises pro-apoptotic genes that are normally
  inhibited by DNA-PK activity such as EGR2, KLF4 and ATF4.
