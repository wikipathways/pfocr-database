caption: Itaconic acid production pathway in Aspergillus terreus. The itaconic acid
  biosynthesis pathway in Aspergillus terreus. Glucose is converted to pyruvate through
  glycolysis. Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA that together with oxaloacetate
  forms citric acid and start the TCA cycle. MttA transports cis-aconitate from the
  mitochondrion into the cytosol where CadA facilitates the conversion of cis-aconitic
  acid to itaconic acid and concomitantly MfsA transports itaconic acid out of the
  cell. Note that only direct pathway steps towards IA production are shown
