caption: (A) Schematic illustration of the processes involved in MTO-induced immunogenic
  cell death (ICD). ICD facilitates tumor antigen cross-presentation by APC cells
  by promoting a cell death response that is accompanied by CRT expression on the
  dying tumor cell surface. CRT provides an “eat-me” signal for APC uptake. In addition,
  the release of adjuvant stimuli from the dying tumor cells, e.g., HMGB1 from the
  nucleus and ATP from autophagic vesicles, are responsible for DC maturation and
  antigen presentation to cognate immune cells. The immunogenic effects of MTO include
  the recruitment of NK cells and CD8low CTL, which are capable of inducing tumor
  cell lysis by releasing granzyme B and perforin. Both cell types also produce IFN-γ.
  (B) Mechanistic explanation of the counter-regulatory effect of IFN-γ release on
  the ICD response by upregulating IDO-1 and PD-L1 expression, as well as Treg generation.
  (C) Schematic illustration of the role of IDO-1 in regulating the tumor microenvironment.
  IDO-1 exerts an immune suppressive effect by converting tryptophan to kynurenine.
  The kynurenine excess and tryptophan depletion leads to interference in the mTOR
  pathway and P-S6 kinase activity but enhances the activation of a kinase known as
  “general control nonderepressible 2” (GNC2) as well as the transcriptional activity
  of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). This results in decreased cytotoxic T cell
  activity, T-cell anergy, and increased Treg production. In addition, the activation
  of increased IL-6 production by the AhR is responsible for more IDO-1 production.
