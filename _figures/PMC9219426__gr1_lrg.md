caption: Schematic signaling pathway for the role of mtDNA in the activation of TLR9
  in COVID-19. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are critical players for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. SARS-CoV-2
  induces the release of mtDNA as the result of mitochondrial dysfunction. The transportation
  of mtDNA fragments to endosomes exposes them to TLR9. TLR9-MyD88-dependent activation
  of the NF-κB pathway induces the immune response by production of IL-6.
