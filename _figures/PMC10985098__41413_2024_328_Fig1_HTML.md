caption: Diagram of the interoception circuits. The interoceptors located at the peripheral
  sensory nerve terminals perceive interoceptive signals generated by peripheral organs.
  The spinal and vagal nerves are two major ascending/afferent pathways that transmit
  interoceptive signals to the brain. In spinal nerve pathway, the somatosensory neurons
  in DRG project to the brain via the SDH. The spinal nerves primarily transmit somatic
  sensations such as temperature, injury, and pain-related signals from the skin,
  muscle, and skeleton. The vagal nerves transmit mechanical and chemical signals
  originating from visceral organs through JG and NG. Upon receiving interoceptive
  signals, various barin regions, including the NTS, thalamus, hypothalamus, PBN,
  hippocampus, ACC, amygdala, SC, PIC, AIC, PFC, and OFC, partake in the integration
  and interpretation of these signals. Finally, the brain sends the regulatory signals
  back the origin organs of interoceptive signals through descending/efferent interoceptive
  pathways. The SG, receiving projection from preganglionic sympathetic neurons in
  the spinal IML, and the PSG are two interoceptive effectors to maintain the internal
  organ homeostasis. This figure is a modified version of Fig. 1 published in Cell
  Metab Dec 6;34(12):1914-1931. DRG dorsal root ganglia, SDH spinal dorsal horn, JG
