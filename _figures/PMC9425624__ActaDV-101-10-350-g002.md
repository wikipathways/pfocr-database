caption: 'Proposed model of the functional interaction between mast cells and the
  synapse of the sensory nerve in the skin. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) bounds antigens
  (different allergens) and triggers the IgE receptor FcεRI signalling pathway, which
  results in mast cell degranulation. Mast cells release various mediators, such as
  chymase, tryptase, serotonin, histamine, and interleukins (including interleukin
  (IL)-31). Transmitters released from mast cells interact with their specific receptors
  (protease-activated receptor (PAR-2), serotonin receptor 5HTR, histamine receptor
  (HR), interleukin 31 receptor (IL-31R)) on nerve terminals, which leads to direct
  activation of pruriceptors. Stimulation of PAR-2 receptors leads to coactivation
  of transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels). In turn, activated nerve
  fibres release several mediators, including neuropeptides, such as calcitonin gene-related
  peptide (CGRP), substance P, nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurokinin 1, which elicit
  feedback activation of the mast cell through respective receptors (Masrelated G
  protein-coupled receptor-X2 (MGPRX2), neurokinin 1 receptor (NK-1R), tropomyosin
  receptor kinase A (TrkA)). CALCRL/RAMP1: calcitonin receptor-like receptor/receptor
  activity-modifying protein 1; DRG: dorsal root ganglion.'
