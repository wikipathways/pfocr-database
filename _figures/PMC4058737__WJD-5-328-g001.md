caption: 'Crosstalks between ghrelin and insulin signaling. A: In the CNS, the interaction
  between GHS-R1a and ghrelin leads to the activation of PKC and PKA and ultimately
  to the opening of calcium channels. In the ARC, AG’s orexigenic effects are solely
  mediated through PKA activation and the intracellular entry of Ca2+; which in turn,
  generate a depolarization/activation of NPY neurons. GHS-R1a activation also triggers
  AMPK phosphorylation. Also, the activation insulin signaling pathway leads to a
  phosphorylation cascade that involves PI3K, Akt/PKB and mTORC1. mTORC1 has been
  shown to reduce food intake by inhibiting NPY expression in ARC neurons. This suggests
  the existence of a crosstalk between these two signaling pathways, considering that
  AMPK inhibits mTORC1 activation while ghrelin also reduces the anorexigenic effects
  of insulin-mTORC1. GHS-R1a could also mediate mTORC1 activation through an AMPK-independent
  mechanism. Moreover, GHS-R1a has been shown to dimerize with some GPCRs such as
  Gpr83, DRD1/2 and MC3R; B: In the periphery, the adipogenic effects of ghrelin have
  been shown to synergize with insulin signaling. In contrast to its central effects,
  the interaction between GHS-R1a and AG leads to decreases in AMPK activity in the
  periphery. GHS-R1a also activates Akt, PKB, mTORC1 and ultimately PPAR-γ to stimulate
  insulin-induced adipogenesis. CNS: Central nervous system; PKC: Protein kinase C;
  PKA: Protein kinase A; ARC: Arcuate nucleus; GHS-R1a: Growth hormone secretagogue
