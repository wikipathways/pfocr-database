caption: Proposed model depicting classical and nonclassical functions of choline
  kinase alpha (CHKA). Classical model involves ubiquitination and activation of androgen
  receptor (AR)–dependent transcription, which results in upregulation of CHKA, which
  is required for the execution of the Kennedy pathway to produce phosphatidylcholine
  required for plasma membrane biogenesis. In addition to its role in Kennedy pathway,
  CHKA can also interact with the AR in cytoplasm and promotes its stability (nonclassical).
  This could lead to AR overexpression and increased AR signalling, which in turn
  may allow for more CHKA production. AR = androgen receptor; CHKA = choline kinase
  alpha; mRNA = Messenger RNA.
