caption: Mechanisms and regulation of the reduction-based iron acquisition mechanism.
  The transcription factors FIT and bHLH38/39 regulate proton extrusion, Fe(III) reduction,
  and uptake of Fe(II). In addition, FIT and bHLH38/39 control the mutually exclusive
  induction of the phenylpropanoid pathway in Arabidopsis and flavin synthesis in
  M. truncatula, leading to the production of putatively iron-binding compounds (IBCs)
  that are excreted via specific transporters in the plasma membrane. The consensus
  sequence hhbhAAACCAAv (indicated by green circles) is likely to be involved in the
  regulation of the pathways. Iron-binding compounds chelate Fe(III) from nonsoluble
  ferrihydroxides. The resulting chelates are split by reduction via FRO2, and the
  released ferrous iron is taken up via IRT1. Yellow circles indicate genes that are
  regulated by AtFIT.
