caption: Schematic displaying the sites of intervention and chemogenetic approach
  to activate parasympathetic vagal pathway to the heart. Selective expression of
  designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) within paraventricular
  nucleus oxytocin (PVN OXT) neurons or cardiac cholinergic (ChAT) neurons of the
  cardiac ganglia provides for cell-specific and chronic activation of those neurons
  by the designer drug, clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Chemogenetic activation of PVN OXT/ICG
  ChAT Cre neurons decreases heart rate, cardiac inflammation and fibrosis, mortality
  and increases cardiac functions i.e., ejection fraction, stroke volume, cardiac
  output, and heart rate recovery following peak effort capacity. This approach circumvents
  the off-target effects of electrical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) and is a novel
  target of opportunity for potent and selective treatments that increase parasympathetic
  tone to the heart, with its many cardioprotective benefits.
