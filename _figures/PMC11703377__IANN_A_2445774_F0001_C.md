caption: 'Remodeled fatty acid metabolism in tumor cells. The synthesis of FAs involves
  several key enzymes, including ACC, ACLY, and FASN. ACC carboxylates acetyl-CoA
  to form malonyl-CoA, while ACLY catalyzes the transfer of acetyl-CoA from the mitochondria
  to the cytoplasm for de novo FAs synthesis. The expression of FASN is regulated
  by EGFR, ER, AR, and PR. Downstream of these receptors, the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway
  is a candidate pathway. Dysregulated Akt can directly phosphorylate ACLY, leading
  to increased synthesis of acetyl-CoA. Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment can
  also result in overexpression of FASN, possibly through Akt phosphorylation and
  activation of HIF1, which upregulates the transcriptional regulator SREBP-1. The
  presence of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also stimulates the upregulation
  of ACC by activating the AMPK signaling pathway. The β-oxidation of FAs occurs in
  three stages: activation, transfer, and oxidation. FAs are activated in the cytoplasm
  as acyl-CoA, transferred to the mitochondrial matrix via CPT, and oxidized to produce
  one molecule of acetyl-CoA and a new acyl-CoA, along with three times the energy
  generated by glucose oxidation. Thin blue arrows indicate biological processes and
  thick blue arrows indicate up-regulation'
