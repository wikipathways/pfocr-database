  monocytogenes. Branched-chain amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine (not shown)—are
  used as precursors in a BKD-dependent pathway for the synthesis of odd-number iso-BCFA,
  anteiso-BCFA, and even-number iso-BCFA (not shown), respectively. Alternatively,
  the carboxylic acids 2-methylbutyric acid (2MB) and butyrate can also be used as
  precursors in a BKD-independent pathway for the synthesis of anteiso-BCFA and straight-chain
  FAs, respectively. BKD, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase.
