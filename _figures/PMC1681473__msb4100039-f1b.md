caption: (B) The bow-tie architecture also exists at the signal transduction level.
  There are bow-tie structures in the TLR signaling network and adaptive immunity
  where antigen presenting and recognition is the hub of the network. APCs express
  a diverse range of receptors to recognize a wide variety of pathogens via PAMPs,
  etc. Signaling pathways and capturing processes converge into a smaller variety
  of core processes. For TLRs, only a handful of adaptor proteins and kinases mediate
  the signaling process that results in diverse responses including cytokine release,
  transcription, and other events. The innate immune system comprises TLRs and their
  downstream cascades that form the characteristic shape of the network called a bow-tie,
  or hour-glass, structure (; ). A wide variety of pathogens and their molecules are
  represented by much smaller numbers of ligands, called PAMPs, recognized by IL-1R
  and 10 TLRs (; ). Only a handful of adaptor proteins, such as MyD88, MAL/TIRAP,
  TRIF, and TRAM, and two primary kinases (TBK1 and IRAK) mediate various responses
  and trigger massive changes in a broad range of transcription of target genes including
  secretion of cytokines and chemokines (). MyD88 has special importance as it constitutes
  a non-redundant core element of the main bow-tie network. Although there are collateral
  pathways such as MyD88-independent pathway, MyD88 is largely responsible for activation
  of TLR-mediated responses. Collateral pathways play roles in modulating different
  responses. This is a versatile architecture that enables organisms to evolutionarily
  add a new kind of receptor for new molecular signatures that eventually activate
  TBK1 and IRAK to bring about some responses. This is a bow-tie architecture at the
  signaling pathway, and exists in a broad range of somatic cells, but most saliently
  in macrophage and DC. In this bow-tie structure, there are nested bow-tie structures
  as well as positive feedback loops. For example, NF-κB and TNF form bow-tie structures
  having extensive input signals and changes in transcription and cytokine production
  (). Positive feedback loops involving NF-κB play an important role in the dynamics
  of the immune system in boosting innate immune response. An antigen-processing and
  presentation process captures a variety of peptides and presents them on MHC-I or
  MHC-II molecules that are recognized by TCRs. This antigen presentation and recognition
  part is a critical core process in adaptive immunity. A breach in proper presentation
  and recognition leads to improper immune reactions such as autoimmune diseases.
  Details of TLR signaling network are reported elsewhere (K Oda and H Kitano, in
  preparation).
