caption: The molecular mechanism of pyroptosis and its role in PDAC suppression. The
  molecular mechanism of pyroptosis is mainly divided into canonical and noncanonical
  pathways. The canonical pathway (left panel) is triggered by DAMPs or PAMPs. This
  process facilitates the formation of inflammasomes, including PRRs (e.g., NLRP3),
  ASCs and procaspase-1. Activated caspase-1 not only cleaves GSDMD but also contributes
  to IL-1β and IL-18 maturation. The GSDMD N-terminus is translocated to the plasma
  membrane where it oligomerizes to form a lytic pore. MST-1 is a component of the
  Hippo signaling pathway and has been reported to induce caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis
  via ROS. The noncanonical pathway (right panel) is initiated by LPS and executed
  by caspase-4/-5/-11 not caspase-1, eventually leading to GSDMD cleavage and membrane
  pore formation. Yellow fluorescence represents active form.
