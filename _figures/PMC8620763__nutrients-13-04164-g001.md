caption: 'Aspirin metabolism pathway. Roughly 10% of aspirin remains unchanged and
  is excreted in the urine as aspirin. Aspirin is broken down into various metabolites,
  the most active of them being salicylic acid [,]. Various enzymes are involved in
  the metabolism pathway. The percentages indicate how much of the drug is being metabolised
  in that pathway. Abbreviations: BChE, butyrylcholinesterase; PAFAH1b2, platelet-activating
  factor acetylhydrolase 2; PAFAH1b3, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 3;
  UGT1A6, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1–6; ACSM2B, Acyl-CoA Synthetase Medium-Chain
  Family Member 2B and CYP450, cytochrome P450.'
