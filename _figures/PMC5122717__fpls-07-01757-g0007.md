  mites/CiLV-C. Left and right leaf halves show hallmarks during the plant interaction
  with non-viruliferous and viruliferous mites, respectively. During the feeding of
  non-viruliferous mites, saliva and putative mite-encoded effectors are delivered
  into the mesophyll cells targeted by the mite's stylet. Reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) burst, localized cell death and SA and JA/ET pathways are triggered. Mite
  induces the expression of the ERF-branch responsive gene PDF1.2 rather than the
  MYC-branch responsive gene VSP2, which might restrain plant response against herbivores.
  In plant infested by CiLV-C viruliferous mites, virions reach mesophyll cells mixed
  with the salivary flow. CiLV-C multiplies in the initially infected cell and locally
  moves to the neighboring cells. Mite feeding and the increasing viral loads generate
  a stronger stimulus which intensifies the ROS production, the number of dead cells
  around the mite feeding site and the SA-mediated response. Increased activity of
  the SA pathway likely promotes the inhibition of the JA/ET pathways, leading the
  downregulation of PDF1.2 and VSP2, which probably improve the mite performance.
  Both non-viruliferous and viruliferous mite infestations induce expression profile
  changes in the core genes of the gene silencing mechanism. Enhanced SA signaling
  activity in viral presence may contribute to higher RDR1 expression. A putative
  virus suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR) may target and inactivate AGO1, leading
  to the up-regulation of AGO2, which addresses a second antiviral defense line of
  the RNA silencing. CiLV-C remains restricted at cells surrounding the inoculation
  site and chlorosis symptoms develop seven to 10 days after inoculation, probably
  as a result of a hypersensitive-like response (HR) as consequence of an incompatible
  interaction.
