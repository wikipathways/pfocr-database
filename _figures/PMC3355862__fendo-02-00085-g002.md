caption: Proton circuit. UCP1 is inserted in the mitochondrial inner membrane where,
  also present, is a multienzymatic complex called the respiratory chain made of complexes
  I to IV. The respiratory chain reoxidizes reduced coenzymes and electrons are driven
  to oxygen. This oxido-reduction step liberates energy which is used to generate
  an electrochemical gradient of protons across the inner membrane. This gradient
  is normally consumed by the ATP-synthase which phosphorylates ADP. UCP1 transports
  protons passively and makes possible a futile cycle of protons across the inner
  membrane leading to increased energy expenditure. This schema illustrates the situation
  encountered in brown adipocytes of mammals where a large amount of respiratory chains
  as well as a large amount of UCP1 are present. Activation of the futile cycling
  increases considerably energy expenditure and thus heat production by these thermogenic
  cells. In other cells where homologs of the UCP1 are expressed at much lower level,
  this pathway would represent a minor contributor to energy expenditure, but might
  be of importance to avoid oxidative damage (Figure kindly designed by Frédéric Bouillaud).
