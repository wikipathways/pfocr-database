caption: Schematic representation of the hypoxia inducible factor pathway. In normoxia
  HIFα subunit is hydroxylated by proline hydroxylase (PHD). The hydroxylated (OH)
  HIFα is recognised by a product of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor gene
  (VHL) which tags the HIFα-OH with polyubiquitin for subsequent degradation by the
  ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. In hypoxia HIFα and HIFβ subunits dimerize, then translocate
  in the nucleus where subunits interact with hypoxia regulatory elements (HREs),
  recruiting the transcriptional co-activator p300, activating the full transcription
  of downstream genes which regulate cell survival, motility, metabolism and angiogenesis.
