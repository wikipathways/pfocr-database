caption: Proposed signaling pathway for ATP release from erythrocytes in response
  to activation of the prostacyclin receptor. Exposure of human erythrocytes to prostacyclin
  (PGI2) analogs results in activation of Gs, leading to increases in cAMP that are
  regulated by phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) activity. Increases in cAMP activate PKA
  and, subsequently, CFTR. The final conduit for ATP release is VDAC. AC, adenylyl
  cyclase.
