caption: (A) Carbohydrates can be stored as glycogen, which can be rapidly utilized
  for fast energy production. As storage is limited to a handful of organs, mainly
  the liver and skeletal muscles, sustained usage of glycogen will deplete stores
  in a few h. During catabolism, glycogen is first broken down into glucose molecules
  that enter into glycolysis, yielding pyruvate. The process of glycolysis yields
  a low amount of ATP and NADH. After the addition of a CoA group, pyruvate (now acetyl-CoA)
  enters into the TCA cycle to produce NADH and FADH2. (B) In contrast to carbohydrate
  storage, storage of lipids, in the form of triglycerides, is virtually limitless.
  Catabolism of lipids is a slow process and is therefore mainly utilized during prolonged
  energy need (i.e., when carbohydrate storage is expended). The process yields fatty
  acids and glycerol. The addition of a CoA group to fatty acids generates acyl-CoA,
  which is carried into the mitochondria via the carrier protein carnitine. Once inside
  the mitochondria, acyl-CoA is catabolized via β-oxidation to produce NADH and FADH2.
  Glycerol can enter into the end steps of glycolysis or is reprocessed to form glucose
  (i.e., gluconeogenesis). (C) Proteins can be broken down in smaller polypeptides
  or amino acids during ATP production but cannot be stored. As proteins are required
  for biological functions other than ATP production, they are thought to be used
  for ATP production only in conditions of extreme demand, such as sickness or chronic
  inflammation. Proteins used for ATP production do not go through glycolysis, but
  instead are converted to TCA metabolites or pyruvate. (D) NADH and FADH2 generated
  by glycolysis, β-oxidation, and the TCA cycle are converted via the electron transport
  chain (ETC) in the mitochondria. The ETC is a series of 5 protein complexes that
  work in synchrony to produce ATP. This process, called oxidative phosphorylation,
  requires oxygen. CoQ10 functions as an electron carrier between the complexes of
  the electron transport chain. (E) In the absence of oxygen, or when mitochondria
  are impaired, glycolysis is the dominant energy-producing metabolic pathway. In
  order for glycolysis to continue, however, NAD+, a secondary substrate along with
  glucose, must be regenerated from NADH. To do so, pyruvate is converted into lactate,
  an energy-requiring mechanism that utilizes NADH and thus decreases overall ATP
  production. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CoA, coenzyme A; CoQ10, coenzyme Q10; ETC,
  Electron transport chain; FADH2, flavin adenine dinucleotide; NADH and NAD+, forms
  of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
