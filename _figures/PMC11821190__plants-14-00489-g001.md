caption: 'Abiotic factors trigger post-translational modifications (PTMs) in plants,
  influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. An example of anthocyanin biosynthesis
  is presented: on the left, acetylation (Ac) opens chromatin, allowing transcriptional
  activation of the MBW complex and downstream enzymes (DFR, ANS, UGT), leading to
  anthocyanin production. On the right, methylation (Me) condenses chromatin, inhibiting
  transcription of the same biosynthetic pathway, preventing anthocyanin accumulation.
  This highlights how PTMs, such as acetylation and methylation, regulate chromatin
  dynamics in response to environmental stimuli. Created in BioRender: https://BioRender.com/k98j551
