caption: Metabolic interactions between folates and vitamins B12, B6, and B2. 677C
  → T thermolabile polymorphism with weakened interaction with B2 NAD cofactor disables
  MTHFR function by up to 70% in homozygotes. 15% of population is homozygous (2 inherited
  genes) 50% is heterozygous (one inherited gene). In the presence of this mutation
  (677C → T) when folate is plentiful this pathway provides adequate SAM for DNA methylation
  maintenance and shunts more 5,10 methylene THF to support DNA synthesis with less
  Uracil misincorporation into DNA with less 50% decreased incidence of colon cancer
  and acute lymphocytic leukaemia. However, in the presence of the mutation, if folate
  is low, then SAM DNA methylation may increase OR decrease and de novo DNA thymidine
  synthesis may decrease. There is disruption of normal intracellular methylated folate
  forms and all or some of these perturbations favour increased incidence of colon,
  breast, gastric, cervical and prostate cancer. Under most circumstances DNA synthesis
  through dTMP generation takes precedence over SAM DNA methlyation. Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT) recently found to shift folate metabolism in the direction favoring de novo
  dTMP - DNA synthesis. B2 found to modulate (lessen) effects of MTHFR polymorphisms.
  Diet and all B vitamin levels modulate various folate pathways and therefore risks
  for malignancy!. Newly noted polymorphisms of DHFR (rs1677693 & rs1643659) have
  30% decreased risk while MTR polymorphism (rs4659744) has 25% decreased risk of
  colon cancer only in the absence of FA supplements or FA supplemented diet. Changes
  in B vitamin concentrations and enzyme polymorphisms may produce unpredictable DNA
  methylation changes in part by varying DNA methyl transferase concentrations and
  SAM/SAH concentrations i.e. folate depletion may cause global DNA hypomethylation
  and specific CpG hypermethylations.
