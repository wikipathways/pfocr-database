caption: Involvement of mutant p53 in lamellipodium dynamics and cell migration. To
  safeguard sustained forward movement of the leading edge, integrin and RTKs constantly
  internalize and directionally recycle by means of vesicular trafficking. A critical
  player is the RCP, a Rab11 effector, that physically binds with both RTKs and integrins
  such as the fibronectin receptor α5β1. This enables cotrafficking of adhesion and
  signaling molecules to the forefront of the leading edge. Importantly, the endosomal
  protein RCP, like its partner, Rab25, is overexpressed in some tumors and indirectly
  down-regulated by p63. The latter transcription factor is a member of a tumor suppressor
  family that includes also p73 and the wild-type form of p53. Notably, oncogenic
  mutant forms of p53, such as R175H and R273H, transcriptionally repress p63. Thus,
  in cancer cells expressing p53 mutants, both RTKs and certain integrins evade degradation
  in lysosomes, thereby enhancing cell migration and downstream signaling, primarily
  to the Akt pathway.

  description: Involvement of mutant p53 in lamellipodium dynamics and cell migration.
    To safeguard sustained forward movement of the leading edge, integrin and RTKs
    constantly internalize and directionally recycle by means of vesicular trafficking.
    A critical player is the RCP, a Rab11 effector, that physically binds with both
    RTKs and integrins such as the fibronectin receptor α5β1. This enables cotrafficking
    of adhesion and signaling molecules to the forefront of the leading edge. Importantly,
    the endosomal protein RCP, like its partner, Rab25, is overexpressed in some tumors
    and indirectly down-regulated by p63. The latter transcription factor is a member
    of a tumor suppressor family that includes also p73 and the wild-type form of
    p53. Notably, oncogenic mutant forms of p53, such as R175H and R273H, transcriptionally
    repress p63. Thus, in cancer cells expressing p53 mutants, both RTKs and certain
    integrins evade degradation in lysosomes, thereby enhancing cell migration and
    downstream signaling, primarily to the Akt pathway.
