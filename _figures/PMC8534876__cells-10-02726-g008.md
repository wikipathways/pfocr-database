caption: Nuclear uptake and nuclear functions of cofilin. Cofilin can chaperone actin
  transport into the nucleus ① via Importin 9, probably as ADP-actin to which it has
  much higher affinity than to ATP-actin. Export of actin ② is via profilin-actin-Exportin
  6. ③ Nuclear actin is a required subunit in RNA polymerases and chromatin remodeling
  factors []. Forces within the nucleus that result in nuclear envelope protrusions
  ④ are driven by actin assembly [], but strong cytoplasmic forces ⑤ by filaments
  linking the nuclear matrix through the nuclear envelope via SUN1/2 and nesprin1/2
  also result in nuclear deformations that are controlled by cofilin competing with
  cytoplasmic myoII []. Actin rods in the nucleus ⑥ form under stress and may contain
  cofilin (heat shock stress) as well as being formed from αlpha-actinin and actin
  ⑦, especially prevalent in some muscle diseases []. α-Actinin-4 mediates gene expression
  for proliferation by binding beta-catenin, which is an activator of the wnt signaling
  pathway for cell proliferation. Rods that form under stress tie up the α-actinin,
  blocking this cell proliferation pathway. Thus, rod formation might be a rapid and
  efficient method for sequestering proteins in response to stress. ⑧ Nuclear Rho
  GTPases can signal via ROCK/PAKs to LIMK2 to inhibit proliferation (a decline in
  LIMK 2 enhances tumor progression via beta-catenin and wnt signaling). Active LIMK2
  causes cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition. Nuclear uptake ⑨ of p53, a tumor
  suppressing protein that stimulates the production of BAX and other proapoptotic
  genes, is regulated in part by cytoplasmic F-actin [,] and cofilin-mediated depolymerization
  aids in p53 nuclear translocation. Further details on nuclear actin may be found
  in [,].
