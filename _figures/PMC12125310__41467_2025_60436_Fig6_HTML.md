caption: The transcript of the gibberellin biosynthetic gene GA20ox3 is negatively
  feedback-regulated by DELLA proteins in a DOF6-dependent manner. The DOF6-GA20ox3-mediated
  GA signaling pathway is influenced by cold. SNPs in the GA20ox3 promoter region
  affect the recognition efficiency of DOF6, causing differences in fruit length and
  seed germination timing. Hap1/4 and Hap2/3 have developed distinct adaptive mechanisms
  to cope with variations in cold exposure duration resulting from differences in
  high and low altitudes
