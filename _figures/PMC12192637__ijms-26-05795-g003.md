caption: 'Simplified scheme of Shigella spp. and EIEC enteroinvasion: (I) Bacterial
  internalization causing NOD activation and NF-κB signaling pathway upregulation
  resulting in IL-8 secretion. Neutrophil migration and activation cause the degradation
  of tight junctions (occludins and claudins), which potentiate bacterial infiltration
  of submucosal tissue. (II) Internalization of bacterial cells into M cells and their
  transcytosis to macrophages located downstream. Fusion of lysosome with endosome
  is inhibited, the bacterium escapes from the endosome to the cytosol, and virulence
  factor IpaB promotes apoptosis of macrophages. (III) Shigella/EIEC, after escaping
  from the macrophage, invades the enterocyte via T3SS and its effectors (e.g., IpaA-C).
  Then, the bacterium induces phagosome lysis and translocates into the cytosol, and
  the IcsA protein induces the formation of F-actin polymer (actin tail). The pathogen
  migrates to the surrounding enterocytes. Elements common to other pathogens can
  be found in the scheme: L. monocytogenes ((III) formation of actin tail), Salmonella
  and Yersinia ((I–III) the difference is that these pathogens do not polymerize F-actin
  and stay in primary formed vacuoles inside phagocytes or enterocytes—lack of phagosome
  escape). Abbreviations: CD4—cluster of differentiation 4; IcsA—Intracellular chromosome-mediated
  spreading Actin-based motility protein; IL—interleukin; INF-γ—interferon gamma;
  IpaA-D, IpgB1/2—invasiveness factors of Shigella/EIEC; Mφ—macrophage; MHC II—Major
  Histocompatibility Complex class II; NF-κB—nuclear factor κB; NK cell—natural killer
  type cell; NOD—nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors; TCR—T-cell
