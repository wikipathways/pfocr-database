caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed signaling mechanism that stimulates EMT.
  TGF-β1 (or TGF-β2) promotes the up-regulation of E-cadherin repressors Snail and
  Slug via MAPK signaling. Snail and Slug inhibit E-cadherin gene expression, thus
  limiting β-catenin substrate binding at the cell membrane. Through this mechanism,
  β-catenin–TCF-4 complexes up-regulate synthesis of TGF-β3. TGF-β3, in turn, through
  Smad signaling can up-regulate levels of LEF-1, a new substrate for β-catenin. β-catenin
  is further stabilized in the cytoplasm by the actions of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3
  to signal through PI3K. PI3K can then signal molecules such as ILK and AKT, which
  can phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3β, a protein that targets both Snail and β-catenin
  for degradation through the ubiquitin proteosome pathway. This high amount of cytoplasmic
  β-catenin achieved through GSK-3β phosphorylation and E-cadherin repression will
  promote association with LEF-1, upon which these β-catenin–LEF-1 complexes will
  translocate to the nucleus to promote transcription of EMT target genes (vimentin,
  fibronectin).
