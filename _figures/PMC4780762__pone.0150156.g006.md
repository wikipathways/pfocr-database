caption: Intracellular pool sizes of metabolic intermediates in the TCA cycle, urea
  cycle, glycolysis, lipid metabolism pathway, disaccharide metabolism pathway and
  purine metabolism pathway. Grey fonts represent the undetectable metabolites. The
  black font represents the unchanged metabolites. The red font represents the significantly
  increased metabolites (increased pool size>50%, p-value<0.05), and the green font
  represents the significantly decreased metabolites (decreased pool size>50%, p-value<0.05).
  The quantitated pool size changes are indicated in .
