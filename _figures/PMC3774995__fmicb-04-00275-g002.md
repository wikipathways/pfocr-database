caption: (A) Schematic representation of p30 functions. (1) Interaction of p300 and
  p30 influences cellular gene expression (2) p30 inhibits PU.1 transcriptional activity,
  affecting TLR4 expression and ultimately the innate immune response. (3) p30 activates
  Myc-mediated transcription by recruiting TIP60. (4) p30 disrupts p300 recruitment
  to the TRE by Tax thereby reducing viral gene transcription. (5) p30 inhibits tax/rex
  mRNA export possibly through REGγ interaction, Rex counteracts p30 inhibitory function.
  (6) p30 causes increased phosphorylation in cdc25C on S216 and reduced phosphorylation
  on S198 leading to G2/M checkpoint activation. (7) p30 disrupts Cyclin E-CDK2 complex
  formation causing delayed S phase entry. (8) p30 interaction with Regγ down-regulates
  ATM levels, in addition p30 inhibits MRN complex formation during DNA damage activating
  NHEJ. (B) Schematic representation of p28 functions. p28 is recruited by Tax to
  the viral promoter where it co-migrates with the transcriptional machinery until
  the response element is made. p28 interacts with tax/rex mRNA and inhibits its nuclear
  export by modulating the Tap/p15 pathway. p28 interaction with PRMT5 leads to reduced
  viral gene expression.
