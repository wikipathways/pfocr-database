caption: Schematic representation of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. The binding of SARS-CoV-2
  spike (S) protein to the ACE2 receptor on the host cell surface leads to the fusion
  of viral and cellular membrane. The cellular surface serine protease TMPRSS2 is
  required for the priming of viral S protein. SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell through
  the endosomal pathway, followed by the release of nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm.
  The virus then dissolves its protein shells and releases its genome inside the cell.
  The viral RNA attaches to the cell translation machinery to synthesize two large
  polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). These polyproteins are broken down into smaller NSPs
  by host and viral proteases. Among them, RdRp is the core catalytic subunit that
  drives the replication and amplification of viral RNA genome. The resultant negative-sense
  RNA acts as a template to produce genomic RNA and a collection of subgenomic RNAs
  (sgRNAs) that encode viral structural and accessory proteins. The viral RNA and
  N protein are synthesized in the cytoplasm. Viral S, M and E proteins are translated
  from sgRNAs by the ribosomes present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are subsequently
  embedded in an intermediate compartment of ER with Golgi (ERGIC). The viral genome
  is encapsulated by N proteins and assembled with the structural proteins in ERGIC.
  The mature virion is formed by budding from the lumen of ERGIC. The progeny virus
  is then liberated into the extracellular environment via exocytosis. SARS-CoV-2,
  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; TMPRSS2, transmembrane protease
  serine 2; ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase;
  ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment; N, nucleocapsid; S,
