caption: A net synthesis of TCA cycle intermediates occurs when the initial reaction
  is catalysed by GDH which paves the way for the complete oxidation of the carbon
  skeleton of GLU. This requires pyruvate recycling via the concerted action of malic
  enzyme (ME) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) converting malate into acetyl-CoA producing
  NAD(P)H. Acetyl-CoA is oxidized completely in one turn of the TCA cycle. A partial
  oxidation of GLU is acquired when pyruvate (PYR) is reduced to lactate (LAC) instead
  of being oxidized to acetyl-CoA. The redox state of the cell is likely important
  in the regulation of the destiny of the GLU molecule. Alternative to the activity
  of GDH, AAT facilitates the formation of α-KG from GLU at the expense of OAA (oxaloacetate);
  thus no net synthesis of TCA cycle intermediates is obtained. In contrast to the
  complete oxidation initiated by the activity of GDH, AAT enables the truncated TCA
  cycle which refers to the net synthesis of aspartate from GLU, a pathway shown to
  accelerate during hypoglycaemic conditions. PC, pyruvate carboxylase; CIT, citrate.
