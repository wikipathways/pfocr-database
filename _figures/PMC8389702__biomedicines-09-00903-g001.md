caption: 'Depicts the interaction of SARS-CoV2 with the ACE2 receptor and the inflammatory
  profile pattern before and after Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection in patients
  with or without CVD. The initial entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  2 (SARS-CoV-2) into cells is shown with involvement mainly of type II pneumocytes.
  SARS-CoV-2 binds to its functional receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
  (ACE2). After endocytosis of the viral complex, surface ACE2 is further down-regulated,
  resulting in unobstructed accumulation of angiotensin II. Local activation of the
  renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system may mediate lung injury responses to viral
  insults. The elderly and the young may present with different pathophysiological
  profiles. The simplified scheme of the pre-infection inflammatory profile among
  predisposed older individuals compared to their younger counterparts is illustrated.
  Abbreviations: ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ARB, angiotensin-receptor
  blocker; CVD, cardiovascular disease; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2.'
