caption: Metabolic pathways in T cells and Tfh-specific alterations. Several signaling
  networks underly cellular metabolism. Glucose is broken down to produce glycolysis
  and two ATP molecules in a process known as Glycolysis. Glycolytic intermediates
  support the pentose phosphate pathway for generation of nucleotides. The pyruvate
  produced during glycolysis is either converted into lactate or Acetyl-CoA, the latter
  is subsequently funneled into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Glutaminolysis
  also fuels the TCA cycle through the breakdown of glutamine into α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG). Products of the TCA cycle, along with the oxidation of fatty acids (FAO),
  support the electron transport chain (ETC) which is coupled with OXPHOS for the
  generation of over 30 ATP molecules. When in excess, Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  generated by the ETC, induce cellular oxidative stress, promoting apoptotic signaling.
  Several Tfh signaling pathways either promote or inhibit select metabolic pathways.
  Lipid metabolism, responsible for the generation of lipids, promotes expression
  of CXCR5 on the cell surface. Bcl6 can repress the transcription of several glycolytic
  intermediates, thought to prevent differentiation of alternative T cell subtypes,
  while TCR, CD28, and ICOS signaling in Tfh potently activate glycolysis through
  PI3K-linked activation of mTOR signaling. Created with BioRender.com.
