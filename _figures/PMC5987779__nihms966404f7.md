caption: (A) In response to pheromone, Ste18 is rapidly phosphorylated at its N-terminal
  tail (P-lollipop). Ste5 is simultaneously phosphorylated via negative feedback controlled
  by Fus3/Ste5FBD docking (P-lollipops). Together, this constitutes a phospho-inhibitory
  system that prevents otherwise rapid Ste5/PM association. While not shown outright
  here, previous work implicates pheromone-stimulated expression of Ptc1 phosphatase
  and removal of inhibitory phosphorylation on Ste5 as the inhibition release () (dashed
  orange box). Consequently, the mating pathway is activated with a kinetic delay,
  as evident by the slower rate of Ste5 association at the membrane and delayed peak
  activation of Fus3.(B) Cells engineered to prevent activation of the Ste18/Ste5
  system (Ste183A/Ste5ND) respond ~6 times faster with ~4 times greater intensity
  than observed in wild-type cells—a response that demonstrates synergy between the
  two phospho-regulatory elements (phosphorylated Ste18 and Ste5) in the system.
