caption: The representative diagram of circRNA mediated ceRNA network and oncogene
  signaling pathways. The current study in glioma highlights the regulatory relationship
  of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network for different signaling pathways. Multiple identified
  circRNAs function as miRNA sponge and subsequently up-regulate relevant target genes
  expression level. However, these target genes or proteins further regulate downstream
  factors associated with cancer signaling pathways via acting as transcriptional
  factors or regulatory proteins and other mechanisms. The drawing mainly shows that
  circ-0000177 activates the wnt/β-catenin pathway through miR-638/FZD7. circTTBK2,
  circSHKBP1 and circHIPK3 activate PI3K/AKT and MARK/ERK signaling pathway through
  miR217/HNF1β, miR544a/FOXP1, and miR379/FOXP2 respectively. Additionally, circNPIX
  activates the Notch signaling pathway through miR34a/NOTCH1. More importantly, a
  large number of miRNAs, including miR-124, miR-29, and miR-654 sponged by circHIPK3,
  affect several signaling pathways, suggesting circRNA mediated ceRNA network plays
  crucial roles in glioma progression through signaling pathways
