caption: Off-target resistance mechanisms generally involve activation of bypass signalling
  pathways (blue boxes) which could be downstream of the oncogenic driver pathway
  (red box) or a parallel signalling pathway that could sustain survival and proliferation
  of tumor cells even in the presence of the TKI. This off-target resistance could
  be overcome by using a combination of lorlatinib treatment with other inhibitors
  such as pictilisib (PI3K inhibitor), trametinib (MAPK inhibitor), erlotinib (EGFR
  inhibitor) or afatinib (HER4 inhibitor) based on the involvement of the respective
  signalling pathways.
