caption: Alcohol consumption increases gut permeability and facilitates translocation
  of bacteria-derived LPS from the gut to the liver. LPS activates TLR4-TRIF/IRF-3
  pathway in Kupffer cells, which results in increased proinflammatory cytokine production
  subsequently leading to hepatocyte damage. Alcohol consumption also activates complement
  C3 and C5, which bind to the receptors on Kupffer cells and increase their TNF-α
  production, which leads to activation of NF-kB and other inflammatory pathways in
  hepatocytes and hepatocyte injury. In response to pro-inflammatory stimuli hepatocytes
  secrete chemokines to attract more inflammatory cells.
