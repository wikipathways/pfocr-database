caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of DPP4 and RBP4. (A) IPA investigated the
  molecular pathways of DPP4 involved in NAFLD and NASH. All identified pathways of
  RBP4 were screened individually. Representative canonical pathways of RBP4 are associated
  with other related genes and molecules of NAFLD and NASH. Functional relationships
  of these genes, molecules and DPP4 are depicted using straight lines with arrows.
  DPP4 is functionally related to 1. FXR/RXR signaling; 2. Hepatic fibrosis signaling;
  3. Hepatic stellate cell activation; 4. Adipogenesis pathway; 5. p38-AMPK signaling
  and 6. NF-κB signaling (Right). (B) IPA investigated the molecular pathways of RBP4
  involved in NAFLD and NASH. All identified pathways of RBP4 were screened individually
  (left). Representative canonical pathways of RBP4 are associated with other related
  genes and molecules of NAFLD and NASH. Functional relationships of these genes and
  RBP4 are depicted using straight lines with arrows. RBP4 is functionally related
  to 1. FXR/RXR signaling; 2. Hepatic fibrosis signaling; 3. Hepatic stellate cell
  activation; 4. LXR/RXR pathway and 5. NF-κB signaling (Right). Solid lines show
  direct regulation while dotted lines depict indirect interactions. SLC2A4, Solute
  carrier family 2 member 4; MAP3k5, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase
  5; AGT, Angiotensinogen.
