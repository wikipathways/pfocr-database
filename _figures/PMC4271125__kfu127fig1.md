caption: 'Pathway for the production of ROS by 3,5-DMAP following exposure of a metabolically
  competent biological system to 3,5-dimethylaniline. 3,5-DMA: 3,5-dimethylaniline;
  N-OH-3,5-DMA: N-hydroxyl-3,5-dimethylaniline; 3,5-DMAP: 3,5-dimethylaminophenol;
  3,5-DMQI: 3,5-dimethylquinone imine; CYP450: cytochrome P450 enzymes; NAC: N-acetyl
  cysteine. CYP450s convert 3,5-DMA to N-OH-3,5-DMA and 3,5-DMAP. The N-hydroxylamine
  undergoes N-O-bond heterolysis, catalyzed by acyl- or sulfo-transferase activity
  that forms an unstable N-O- ester. The intermediate nitrenium ion formed reacts
  with a DNA base to produce a mutagenic adduct. The 3,5-DMAP produced by P450-catalyzed
  hydroxylation of the aniline or by nucleophilic attack of H2O on the appropriate
  resonance form of the nitrenium ion is oxidized to its quinone imine form. The electrophilic
  3,5-DMQI undergoes redox cycling to generate ROS that results in genotoxic and cytotoxic
  activities. ROS scavengers, NAC, and uric acid are able to attenuate the cycling
  pathway between 3,5-DMAP and 3,5-DMQI.'
