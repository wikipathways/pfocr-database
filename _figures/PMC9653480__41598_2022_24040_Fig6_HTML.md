caption: Summary and proposed model of impact of maternal obesity on placental lipid
  metabolism. High maternal triglycerides (TG) drive fatty acid uptake into the trophoblast,
  increasing (green) peroxisomal ACOX1 protein (star symbol/shape) activity and oxidation
  of long chain fatty acids, including PPARα ligands. The decrease in endogenous ligands
  for PPARα reduces PPAR response element (PPRE) binding and thus decreases (red)
  the expression of PPARα target genes (e.g. MFSD2a, CPT2, PLIN2, ACOX1 in oval shapes).
  Low MFSD2a levels may reduce DHA uptake, another PPARα ligand, further decreasing
  this pathway. Reduction in lipid esterification and storage may lead to accumulation
  of free FA and lipotoxicity as seen later in gestation. Red dotted lines = inhibition
  of PPARα target genes Red arrows = inhibition of FA entry to pathway.
