caption: Microbiota and the intestinal barrier against infectious threats. (A) Symbionts
  shape mucosal immunity and protect intestinal epithelia. The commensal flora, intestinal
  epithelia covered by mucus, and the mucosal immune response form a complex intestinal
  barrier against infectious threats. The first line of defense is represented by
  the mucus layer as well as by antimicrobial peptides (cathelicidin), bacteriocins,
  and intestinal IgA that ensure the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).
  The commensal flora is interconnected through Quorum-sensing signals (e.g., AI-2
  inducer) and is anchored to the protective mucus, at a distance from the intestinal
  epithelia. Thus commensal species reach high densities in mucosal niches and use
  available nutrient sources contributing to the colonization resistance. The mucosal
  immunity is best represented by a network of cells and cytokines within the lamina
  propria, submucosa and mesenteric ganglia that are ultimately modulated by the commensal
  flora. Commensals activate resident submucosal dendritic cells (DCs) and initiate
  an immunosuppressive response through NFkB/TGFβ pathway which in turn activates
  the lymphnode CD103+ DCs mesenteric population. These DCs subset have the ability
  to prime naïve CD4+ T cell lymphocytes from mesenteric ganglia and induce immunosuppressive
  CD4+ T cells lineages, namely Th3, FoxP3+ (TREG) and Th2-inducing IL10, and TGF-β
  cytokines. The immune-tolerant response protects IECs and allows symbiotic relationships
  between the organism and commensal flora. (B) Intestinal pathogens activate inflammatory
  mediators and promote invasion. Pathogenic species possess virulence factors (T6SS
  or T3SS system, flagella, mucus binding proteins, mucinases, etc.) that enable their
  mucus diffusion and translocation across IECs. Herein pathogens activate TLR4 and
  5 receptors and subsequently induce the release of inflammatory cytokines, IL1,
  IL6, and IL8. These cytokines further activate the CD103+/-DCs population and either
  promote CD4 T helper cells polarization into inflammatory Th1, Th17, and CD8-cytotoxic
  subsets or stimulate B lymphocytes to express IgG, while also reducing the immunosuppressive
  response. The IgG activity and inflammatory response driven by Th1/Th17-related
  cytokines, IFN-γ, IL-17, limits the bacterial invasion. The AI-2 inducer produced
  by certain symbionts can also prevent intestinal colonization with pathogenic species
  through negative feedback signals. However a significant gut inflammatory response
  allows bacterial translocation.
