caption: Schematic illustration of ER-Golgi system-targeting nanodrugs downregulating
  lysosomal degradation pathways for precise tumor therapy. (a) Schematic representation
  of the intracellular trafficking pathways of different NPs. (b) Diagram illustrating
  the inhibitory effect of Golgicide A. (c) Representative images showing the colocalization
  of EhCv/siRNA NPs with the ER, GA, and lysosome, with or without Golgicide A treatment
  [377]. (Reproduced with permission, copyright 2019, Nature Portfolio.) (d) CPD/siRNA/CS
  was internalized via caveolin- and thiol-mediated uptake, bypassing endolysosomal
  degradation and targeting GA. GSH-responsive depolymerization released siRNA, although
  ER/GA-associated exocytosis remained unresolved. (e) Monensin enhanced RNAi by inhibiting
  exocytosis and autophagy, while KDEL modification directed sorting to the ER, reducing
  exocytosis [378]. (Reproduced with permission, copyright 2025, ACS Publication.)
