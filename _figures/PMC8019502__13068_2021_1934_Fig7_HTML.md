caption: The degradation of protocatechuic acid is categorized as 3, 4-cleavage pathway,
  4, 5-cleavage pathway, and 2, 3-cleavage pathway. However, the degradation of catechol
  is mainly catalyzed by dioxygenases through ortho- or meta-cleavage pathway [].
  After completing aromatic ring cleavage, the molecules succinate, acetyl-CoA, and
  pyruvate enter the TCA cycle for cell growth and products’ synthesis
