caption: '(A) Under normal circumstances, insulin stimulation of the INSR activates
  apparently independent arms of the signaling pathway: (i) AKT2 activation, phosphorylation
  of FOXO1, and inhibition of gluconeogenic gene transcription, leading to decreased
  glucose output, and (ii) activation of SREBP-1c target lipogenic genes, leading
  to secretion of triglyceride-rich VLDLs (VLDL TG). (B) Mutation in INSR prevents
  activation of both arms of the pathway, resulting in increased glucose levels without
  increased TG levels. (C) Mutation in the AKT2 gene impairs inhibition of gluconeogenesis
  without abolishing the lipogenic effect of insulin, resulting in increased glucose
  and TG levels. ACC, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase; FAS, fatty acid synthase; PEPCK,
  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.'
