caption: 'Relationships among miRNAs and canonical Wnt signaling, metastasis, and
  tumor-initiating cells. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is activated via Wnt
  and R-spondin interaction with Frizzled (FZD) receptors together with LRP5/LRP6
  co-receptors and LGR4/LGR5 co-activators (depicted at the top of the figure). This
  causes inhibition of the APC-Axin-GSK3β complex, leading to the stabilization of
  β-catenin, which interacts with TCF7L2 (previously TCF4; shown in orange). This
  triggers the transcriptional activation of target genes. This pathway also enhances
  a stem cell phenotype in intestinal epithelial cells and drives metastasis of tumor-initiating
  cells (TICs). Several miRNAs directly modulate canonical Wnt signaling or other
  effectors, such as NUMB, NOTCH and ASCL2. Oncogenic miRNAs are depicted in blue,
  tumor-suppressive miRNAs in red. Direct relationships are shown with solid lines,
  indirect relationships with dotted lines. Official human gene symbols and full names:
  RSPO1-RSPO4, R-spondin 1-4; FZD1-FZD10, frizzled class receptor 1-10; LRP5/6, LDL
  receptor related protein 5/6; LGR4/5, leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled
  receptor 4/5; SNAI1, Snail family transcriptional repressor 1; NUMB, endocytic adaptor
  protein; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli or Wnt signaling pathway regulator; AXIN1/2,
  axin 1/2 ; GSK3B, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; TCF7L2, transcription factor
  7 like 2 (previously TCF4); CTNNB1, β-catenin; ZEB1, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox
