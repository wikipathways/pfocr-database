caption: YAP is regulated by various factors during hepatocarcinogenesis in addition
  to the members of the Hippo signaling pathway. These factors have an important role
  in YAP-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. BTRC and TRIB2 inhibit the overexpression
  of YAP. The interactions between YAP and other factors (CREB, c-Myc, CD166 and MCAM)
  promote hepatocarcinogenesis. High/hippo dependent refers to the effects of BTRC
  on YAP, which are dependent on the Hippo pathway. When BTRC is overexpressed, or
  the Hippo pathway is activated and YAP turnover is inhibited; however, at normal
  levels of BTRC, YAP is protected from degradation. BTRC, β-transducin repeat-containing
  E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; CD, cluster of differentiation; CREB, cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate response element-binding protein; C/EBPα, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein
  α; MAPK14, mitogen-activated protein kinase 14; MCAM, melanoma cell adhesion molecule;
  p-MEK1, phosphorylated-mitogen-activated protein kinase; TRIB2, tribbles homolog
  2; YAP, yes-associated protein.
