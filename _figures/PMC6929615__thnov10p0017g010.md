caption: Macrophage MSR1 is essential for maintaining M2-like activation and promoting
  BMSC osteogenic differentiation. In the communication between macrophages and BMSCs,
  MSR1 plays a crucial role in maintaining M2-like polarization and facilitating BMSC
  osteogenic differentiation. MSR1-mediated activation of PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin
  signaling promotes BMSC osteogenic differentiation. Notably, PGC1α is regulated
  by MSR1-mediated PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling in the macrophages. Increased
  PGC1α promotes oxidative phosphorylation by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis to
  maintain M2-like activation in macrophages.
