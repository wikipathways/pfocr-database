caption: Proposed conserved cyclic adenosine monophosphate–protein kinase A (cAMP‐PKA)
  pathway for Fusarium graminearum and F. verticillioides. Endogenous cAMP produced
  by FAC1 activates CPK1 and other CPKs to regulate many conserved biological functions
  (blue boxes), such as metabolism, protein synthesis, the cell cycle, homeostasis,
  ion transport and chromatin remodelling via orthologous genes differentially expressed
  in both species (ovals). These processes are dependent on FAC1 (blue arrows) or
  FAC1–CPK1 (black arrows), and cAMP can activate CPK1 and regulate detoxification
  and iron transport, including siderophore transport, independently of FAC1 (green
  arrows). Cellular function association is based on functional enrichment of differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) in the Δfac1 and Δcpk1 mutants (Tables S2 and S3) using FunCat
  (Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences, MIPS). Fusarium graminearum and
  F. verticillioides gene annotations are derived from the Fusarium genome annotation
  database (MIPS) and yeast homology information (Saccharomyces Genome Database).
  GPCR, G protein‐coupled receptor.
