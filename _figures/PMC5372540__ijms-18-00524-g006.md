caption: Schematic summarizing how ANE decreases cisplatin toxicity in OSCC cells
  by inducing autophagy, and that the ROS and AMPK/mTOR pathways were involved in
  this process. Non-toxic concentration of ANE could induce autophagy via activation
  of the AMPK/ROS signaling pathway coincided with the activation of ROS accumulation.
  The ANE-induced autophagy was related with decreased cisplatin toxicity in OSCC
  cells.
