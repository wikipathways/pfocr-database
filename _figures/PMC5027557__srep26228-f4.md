caption: 'Prevalent metabolic pathways leading to production of acids (green), alcohols
  (blue), and gases (red) are shown derived from commonly employed growth substrates.
  Many arrows represent multiple enzymatic conversions. The acetone formation pathway
  is depicted using dashed lines since acetone is not a common product of C. pasteurianum
  fermentations. The incomplete citrate cycle and other intermediary metabolic pathways
  are not depicted. Electron bifurcation by the Bcd-EtfAB enzyme complex is shown
  using 2NADH as reductant. Electron transfer via the EtfAB complex is not shown.
  Refer to main text for further discussion on central metabolic pathway enzymes and
  reactions. Abbreviations: EMPP, Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway; N-O PPP, non-oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway; MEDP, modified Entner-Doudoroff pathway; CFP, central
  fermentative pathways; PTS, phosphotransferase system; PMF, proton motive force;
  GFPC, glycerol facilitator protein channel; Glc, glucose; Suc, sucrose; Fru, fructose;
  DHA, dihydroxyacetone; 3-HPA, 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde; 1,3-PDO, 1,3-propanediol;
  GA, glyceraldehyde; FDOX, oxidized ferredoxin; FDRED, reduced ferredoxin.'
