caption: 'The probable mechanisms of the effects produced by lncRNAs on TBI.Notes:
  There are several lncRNAs that have been reported to play different roles in the
  process of TBI. Knocking down GAS5 would alleviate RGCs oxidative stress injury
  by upregulating miR-124. GAS5 could also inhibit microglia M2 polarization by suppressing
  transcription of TRF4. lincRNA-p21 may promote microglial activation through a p53-dependent
  transcriptional pathway. In addition to neuroinflammation, lncRNA MALAT1 is also
  related to neurodegeneration and astrocyte apoptosis via CREB signaling pathway
  and alternative splicing of PKC δII respectively. Astrocyte apoptosis are associated
  with NEAT1 and Gm4419 in which Gm4419 could play the role of sponge for miR-466l
  which could target TNF-α. H19 is considered to alleviate hypoxia-induced injury
  by downregulated miR-28 expression. SNHG1 protected secondary cerebral ischemia
  and hypoxia via sponging miR-338.Abbreviations: lncRNA, long noncoding RNA; TBI,
  traumatic brain injury; GAS5, growth arrest-specific 5; RGC, retinal ganglion cells;
  MALAT1, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1; CREB, cAMP response
  element-binding protein; NEAT1, nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1; TNF-α, tumor
  necrosis factor-alpha; SNHG1, small nucleolar RNA host gene 1.'
