caption: Schematic indicating the role of cellular and EBV miRNAs in EBV latency and
  reactivation. Cellular miRNAs have distinct functions in EBV latency and lytic reactivation
  by directly targeting transcription factors on Zp or regulating the signaling pathway
  related to expression of Zta. Nevertheless, the EBV-encoded miRNAs inhibit the transition
  from latent to lytic viral replication, which occurs both through modulation of
  specific signaling pathways as well as through the restriction of its own gene expression.
  Notably, the EBV-encoded mi-BART20-5p can directly target the transcripts of the
  BZLF1 and BRLF1 genes.
