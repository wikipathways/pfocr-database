caption: Canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. Under resting states, inhibitory
  IκB proteins are bound to NF-κB dimers, which restrict the complexes of NF-κB to
  the cytoplasm. Stimulus-dependent degradation takes place through phosphorylation
  of IκB proteins by IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of two catalytically
  active kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, and the regulatory subunit IKKγ (NEMO). Once phosphorylated,
  IκB proteins undergo extensive ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which
  sets the bound NF-κB dimers free for nuclear translocation. NF-κB signalling is
  divided into canonical and non-canonical pathways. The induction of the canonical
  pathway, which is represented as TNFR1 signalling (left), mainly involves physiological
  NF-κB stimulus, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL‑1 and Toll-like receptor
  ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Stimulus-induced IκBα phosphorylation
  takes place in IKKβ- and NEMO-dependent manner, which allows the p65 and p50-containing
  heterodimers to translocate into the nucleus. The activation of this pathway significantly
  upregulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, cell
  proliferation and metastasis. On the contrary, the non-canonical pathway (right)
  can be stimulated by specific TNF family cytokines, including lymphotoxin β (LT-β),
  B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF), CD40+ligand (CD40+ L) and receptor
  activator of NF‑κB ligand (RANKL). IKKα-derived p100 phosphorylation takes place
  in RelB dependent manner that results in the production of transcriptionally active
  p52-RelB complexes and activation of this pathway. The non-canonical pathway is
  involved in the induction of genes associated with B cell survival and maturation,
  tumour microenvironment, differentiation, secondary lymphoid organ development and
  maintenance.
