caption: Oxysterols are important regulators of many biological processes in the cell.
  The regulation of sterol metabolism is mediated by various ways – through transcription
  factors (liver X receptors - LXRs, or sterol regulatory binding proteins - SREBPs),
  by interaction with oxysterol-binding proteins - OSBPs, or by regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, a key enzyme of cholesterol metabolism. Oxysterols influence
  the biophysical properties of lipid membranes, such as the ordering of the bilayer
  [] and play role in vesicular transport. Oxysterols also interact with integral
  or peripheral membrane proteins and are capable of modulation of their activity.
  They modulate the activity, e.g., of ABC transporters, or Na+/K+ ATPase. Oxysterols
  also interact with signaling pathway proteins and may modulate the Hedgehog, Wnt,
  or MAP kinase signaling.
