caption: Activation of PAR1 by α-thrombin (α-Th) promotes rapid coupling to heterotrimeric
  Gαq and Gα12/13 proteins comprised of α and βγ subunits. PAR1 coupling to Gαq activates
  phospholipase C beta (PLC-β), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) generating inositol-1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG). IP3 triggers release of intracellular Ca2+, which activates calcium/calmodulin
  (CaM) resulting in the activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK phosphorylates
  MLC promoting MLC interaction with F-actin, resulting in stress fiber formation
  and cell contraction, which facilitates endothelial barrier disruption. The activation
  of protein kinase C delta (PKC-δ) is mediated by DAG and Ca2+, which phosphorylates
  Rho-GDP guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) and thereby increases the
  stability of active RhoA bound to GTP. PAR1 coupling to Gα12/13 activates Rho GTP
  exchange factors (GEFs) to activate RhoA, which promotes Rho kinase phosphorylation
  of MLC phosphatase (P’tase) and thereby prevents MLC dephosphorylation and enhances
  endothelial barrier permeability. Thrombin-stimulation also promotes activation
  of p38 MAP kinase, which promotes endothelial barrier disruption through a poorly
  characterized pathway mediated by caldesmon and stress fiber formation that appears
  to be independent MLC phosphorylation.
