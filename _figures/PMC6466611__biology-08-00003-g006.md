caption: Cyclin C-Cdk8/19/3 inhibit the Notch pathway by phosphorylating the Notch
  intracellular fragment (NICD) and promoting its degradation in leukemic T cells.
  In canonical Notch signaling, a contiguous cell exposes a Notch ligand which is
  recognized by a Notch receptor paralog on a receiving cell. Subsequently, a two-step
  proteolytic cleavage produces NICD which stimulates with a transcriptionally paused
  RNA Pol II complex resulting in the downstream expression of genes involved in stem
  cell differentiation and self-renewal.
