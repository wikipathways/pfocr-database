caption: Schematic presentation of the OPG/RANK/RANKL/TRAF6 pathway in osteoclasts.
  The RANK signaling cascade is initiated upon the binding of RANKL to the extracellular
  domain of RANK which panes the signal along to TRAF6. The activation of TRAF6 initiates
  pathways leading to the activation of several transcription factors (among which
  NFκβ and MAP kinase mediators), which contribute to osteoclast differentiation,
  activation and survival. OPG is able to prevent the interaction between RANKL and
  RANK.
