caption: Schematic of signaling events that are induced by the LH surge and regulate
  the processes of ovulation and luteinization. The LH surge induces the epidermal
  growth factor (EGF)–like factors (amphiregulin, epiregulin, and betacellulin) by
  activating the adenylyl cyclase, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and protein
  kinase A (PKA) pathway. These EGF-like factors activate the EGF receptors, leading
  to the activation of extracellular-regulated kinases [ERK1/2; also known as mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK)3/1]. These kinases along with PKA activate the transcription
  factors CAAT and enhance binding proteins α and β (C/EBPα/β). ERK1/2 are essential
  for activating oocyte maturation, cumulus cell oocyte complex (COC) expansion, ovulation,
  and the downregulation of FSH target genes such as Cyp19a1 and Fshr. C/EBPα/β are
  essential for regulating genes associated with the formation, maintenance, and vascularization
  of the corpus luteum (CL) as well as steroidogenesis. Adapted from Fan et al. ().
