caption: Schematic of the proposed role of MSC-sEVs in DOX−induced cardiomyopathy.
  In cardiomyocytes, DOX induces an increase in the transcription factor p53 and a
  decrease in Sp1 through Akt inhibition, thereby inducing cardiomyocyte death by
  downregulating the expression of survivin and Bcl2 related to cell survival. The
  miR−199a−3p in MSC-sEVs plays a key role in the protective effects of MSC-sEVs against
  DOX−induced cardiomyopathy, by upregulating survivin expression via regulating the
  Akt−Sp1/p53 signaling pathway.
