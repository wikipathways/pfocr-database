caption: Complexes involved in translation, degradation and post translational modification
  in yeast. Schematic representation of different multi-protein complexes involved
  in processes related to translation, which were identified in several triplets of
  complexes predicted to be coordinately regulated. RNA polymerase I and III complexes
  are part of the transcriptional machinery that transcribe the ribosome precursors,
  35S and 5S, that after proper processing form the ribosome subunits (40S and 60S)
  []. The Processome is involved in ribosome processing and maturation, as is the
  20S Proteasome []. The eIF2B (eukaryotic initiation factor 2B) complex is required
  for protein translation initiation and its regulation []. Protein translation initiation
  is the first step in protein synthesis and precedes the elongation and termination
  steps to complete polypeptide production. Another complex in this pathway is Aut2/Aut7,
  authophagy related complex which is active in the cytoplasm and responsible for
  degradation during environmental changes [,]. The M-POL II, mannosyltransferase
  II is the third complex enzyme in "mannan" modification of N-linked glycan processing
  in the Golgi apparatus. The two processes of translation and authophagy are both
  known to be mediated by the TOR complex [,].
