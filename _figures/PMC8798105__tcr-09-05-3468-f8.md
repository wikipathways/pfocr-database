caption: A proposed model depicting the potential mechanisms of hydrogen-mediated
  cell apoptosis via a positive feedback regulation of TNF/NF-κB inflammasome pathway.
  TLRs induces the activation of NF-κB pathway, and promotes the expression levels
  of inflammatory genes such as TNF-α and IL-1β. Hydrogen penetrates across biomembranes
  and diffuses into the cytosol, mitochondria and nucleus, leading to the increased
  expression levels of TNF-α, NF-κB and IL-1β, and eventually triggers cell apoptosis.
  TLR, toll-like receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor.
