caption: 'Figure 1. Control of growth and metabolic pathways by AMPK. Phosphorylation
  and activation of AMPK on α-Thr172 is regulated by the upstream kinases LKB1 and
  CaMKK. In turn, AMPK directly phosphorylates multiple downstream targets to balance
  cell growth with energy supply. Substrates that regulate proliferation and metabolism
  and are well-established to be phosphorylated directly by AMPK are shown. Abbreviations:
  LKB1, liver-kinase B1; CaMKK, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase; AMPK,
  AMP-activated protein kinase; TSC2, tuberous sclerosis protein 2; HMGCoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA
  reductase; ACC1/2, acetyl CoA carboxylase 1/2; FOXO3, forkhead box O3; PGC1α, proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1-α; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c;
  and H2B, histone H2B.'
