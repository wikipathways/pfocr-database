caption: Lens microdissection, RNA isolation, RNA-sequencing, and data analysis. Lens
  microdissections were performed as described by . Two sets (N = 2) of pooled (n
  = 100) lens differentiation-state specific fractions were subjected to RNA isolation
  using Trizol and Illumina directional mRNAseq library preparation performed. High-throughput
  sequencing using the Illumina GAIIx platform with 35-bp unidirectional reads generated
  millions of sequencing reads that were processed, aligned by Tophat to Galgal4 and
  biological replicate based statistical modeling and transcript abundance and identity
  assembled by cufflinks using the maximum transcript abundance likelihood estimate
  model described by . Statistical testing was performed using cuffdiff pairwise statistical
  gene expression analysis. CummeRbund was used to statistically assess data and literature
  searches were performed to verify expression results. Ontologically based pathway
  analysis was performed using DAVID and GenoMatix software packages. Gene clustering
  was performed that placed mitochondrial-associated transcripts into mitochondrial
  regulation, biogenesis, homeostasis or degradation functional clusters.
