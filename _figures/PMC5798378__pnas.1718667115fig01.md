caption: Structure and biosynthesis of capuramycin-type metabolites. Proposed biosynthesis
  of the shared CarU core of capuramycin-type metabolites A-500359s and A-503083s
  starting from UMP. CapA and CapH, along with the homologs LipL and LipK from the
  biosynthetic pathway for A-90289 that contains an intact (5′S,6′S)-GlyU in the final
  metabolite, have been previously assigned in vitro. *LipK was previously shown to
  stereospecifically generate (5′S,6′S)-GlyU. αKG, α-ketoglutarate.
