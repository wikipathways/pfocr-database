caption: Graphical representation of acylated (AG) and unacylated (UnAG) ghrelin signalling
  in isolated rat skeletal muscle during acute lipid oversupply, and the effects on
  insulin stimulated glucose uptake and palmitate oxidation. This figure serves as
  a representative schematic; thus, not everything included in the figure was assessed
  in the current study. Schematic represents sedentary animals and chronic treadmill
  trained animals on a high-fat diet (HFD). Sedentary animals on a low-fat diet shared
  a similar metabolic profile to sedentary animals on a HFD and were not included
  in this figure. Dashed lines and question mark represent unassessed mechanisms.
  Upward arrow indicates increase. Downward arrow indicates inhibition. Broken arrow
  indicates loss of signaling pathway. GHS-R1; Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor
  1, CRF-2R; Corticotropin-Releasing Factor 2 Receptor, FAT/CD36; Fatty Acid Translocase,
  FABPpm; Fatty Acid Binding Protein plasma membrane, IR; Insulin Receptor, GLUT4;
  Glucose Transporter 4, DAG; diacylglycerol. This figure was created with use of
