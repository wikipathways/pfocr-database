caption: 'Interaction between metabolism and histone acetylation and DNA/histone methylation.
  Different nutrient substrates including glucose, fatty acids, amino acids and acetate
  lead to production of intermediary metabolites which play a role in protein acetylation.
  Acetyl-CoA derived from glucose, fatty acid or amino acid metabolism is the substrate
  for histone acetylation after conversion into citrate by TCA cycle and back to Acetyl-CoA
  in the cytoplasm by ACLY. Acetate is also a source of acetyl-CoA which leads to
  histone acetylation. Histone and DNA methylation depends on the dietary methionine
  which enters a cycle for conversion into SAM which is used as a donor of the methyl
  group. This leads to formation of SAH which is recycled back to methionine through
  methylation of homocysteine. PDC: Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex; ACLY: ATP-dependent
  Citrate Lyase; SAM: S-Adenosylmethionine; SAH: S-Adenosyl-Homocysteine; DNMTs, DNA
  N-Methyltransferase; MATs: Methionine Adenosyltransferase. Dashed arrows: multiple-step
  metabolic pathway; solid arrows: one-step metabolic reaction.'
