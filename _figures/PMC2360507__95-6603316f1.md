caption: 'A model for endocrine resistance and its treatment: crosstalk between growth-factor
  receptor and ER pathways. Increased growth factor signaling may contribute to endocrine
  resistance by directly activating ER and leading to the transcription of oestrogen-related
  genes. Novel therapies can target a number of steps along this dysregulated signaling
  pathway and may therefore have an important role in the treatment of endocrine resistant
  breast cancer.'
