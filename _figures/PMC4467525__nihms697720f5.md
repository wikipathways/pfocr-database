caption: Summary of altered glucose metabolism in MCF10A-ras cells. MCF10A-ras cells
  exhibited enhanced glycolytic activity and lactate production, decreased glucose
  flux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as well as a potential increase
  in glucose utilization in the pentose phosphate pathway. GLUT1, glucose transporter
  1; SGLT1, sodium dependent glucose transporter1; HK2, hexokinase 2; PGK1, phosphoglycerate
  kinase1; PK, pyruvate kinase; PKM1, pyruvate kinase isoform M1; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase
  A; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDK1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase.
