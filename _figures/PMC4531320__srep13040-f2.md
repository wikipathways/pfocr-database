caption: 'Red arrow indicates enforced flux achieved by overexpression of target gene
  using either plasmid-based expression or changing native promoter to trc promoter.
  Dotted arrow indicates feedback inhibition. Red X indicates genes knocked out, promoter
  change, or removal of feedback inhibition as indicated. The codon optimized dat
  and ddc genes are represented as datopt and ddcopt, respectively. Abbreviations
  of genes and metabolites are as shown in . Other genes and metabolites shown here
  are: pfkA, 6-phosphofructokinase I; pfkB, 6-phosphofructokinase II; gltA, citrate
  synthase; aspC, aspartate aminotransferase; thrA, aspartokinase I; metL, aspartokinase
  II; lysC, aspartokinase III; asd, aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; ASPP, L-4-aspartyl-phosphate.'
