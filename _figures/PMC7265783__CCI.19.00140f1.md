caption: 'Overview of the TransPRECISE framework. The first step of TransPRECISE involves
  implementing the PRECISE pipeline on two sets of RPPA protein expression data –namely,
  cancer patients (7,714 samples across 31 different cancer types) and cancer cell
  lines (640 samples across 16 different cancer tissues). For each combination of
  47 cancer types across cell lines and patients and the 12 pathways, the PRECISE
  procedure is executed in three consecutive steps: fitting cancer-specific protein
  networks using Bayesian graphical regression (step 1); deconvolving these cancer-specific
  networks to fit sample-specific pathways networks (step 2); and aggregating the
  sample-specific networks to obtain calibrated TransPRECISE scores and pathway activity
  status (step 3). The cancer-specific networks from step 1 are compared across patients
  and cell lines for each pathway for pan-cancer identification of differential and
  conserved pathway activities. The TransPRECISE scores from steps 2 and 3 are used
  to identify potential avatar cell lines and the lineages for patient tumors and
  to construct prediction models for drug sensitivity trained in in vivo drug sensitivity
  and used for in silico drug sensitivity prediction of patients′ drug response. The
  bottom panel provides the details and equations for the computational steps of the
  Bayesian graphical regression procedure and post-processing of the regression outputs
  to obtain the cancer-specific and sample-specific summaries. All probabilities are
  computed under the fitted Bayesian graphical regression model with the estimated
  parameters, with the superscripts 0, +, and −, respectively corresponding to the
  neutral, activated, or suppressed status of the pathway. The pijs are the posterior
  probabilities corresponding to protein i and sample j, and the kjs are the aggregated
  pathway scores for sample j.'
