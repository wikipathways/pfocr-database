caption: Gα13‐mediated signaling pathway in germinal center (GC) cells and diffuse
  large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells. (A) In GC cells, S1PR2 initiates Gα13‐mediated
  signaling leading to the suppression of Atk phosphorylation, which leads the control
  of apoptosis and confinement of B‐cells to the GC. (B) In DLBCL cells, the loss
  of suppressive pathway via the absence of Gα13 leads to the increase in survival
  and migration of GC B‐cells.
