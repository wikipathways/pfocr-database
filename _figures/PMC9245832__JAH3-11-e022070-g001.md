caption: Canonical Gq/11signaling pathway of the AT1R (purple blue) causes myogenic
  vasoconstriction whereas noncanonical β‐arrestin‐biased signaling is not involved
  in this process. Gq/11 proteins are heterotrimeric G proteins, which are made up
  of alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) subunits. The alpha subunit is attached to
  either a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) or guanosine diphosphate (GDP), which serves
  as an on‐off switch for the activation of the G‐protein. Upon activation of the
  AT1aR by either ligand‐independent mechanical stretch or the natural‐biased ligand
  Ang II, the Gβγ complex is released from the Gα subunit after its GDP‐GTP exchange
  for canonical G protein signaling to cause myogenic and/or humoral (Ang II‐mediated)
  vasoconstriction. This pathway is inhibited by the Gq/11 inhibitor FR900359. Although,
  GRKs and arrestins play a role in multiple noncanonical signaling pathways in cells,
  this pathway is unlikely engaged by mechanoactivated AT1Rs in response to tensile
  stretch or their natural ligand angiotensin II to cause vasoconstriction. Ang II
  indicates angiotensin II; GRK, G protein‐coupled receptor kinase; and SII, Sar1Ile4Ile8‐angiotensin.
