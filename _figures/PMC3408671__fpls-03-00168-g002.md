caption: A truncated fatty acid synthesis pathway depicting the roles of the enzymes
  described in this study. The fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD2), fatty acid elongase
  (FAE1), and fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase B (FATB) enzymes are in bold. In short,
  FATB is an acyl–acyl carrier protein thioesterase which primarily hydrolyzes saturated
  acyl-ACPs before the export of the fatty acid. 18:1Δ9, which is synthesized by other
  enzymes, can be either elongated by FAE1 or desaturated by FAD2.
