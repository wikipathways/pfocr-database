caption: Schematic illustration of RDNVs reverse osteoporosis by potentiating osteogenic
  differentiation of hBMSCs via targeting estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling. RDNVs,
  a natural product isolated from fresh Rhizoma Drynariae root juice by differential
  ultracentrifugation, exhibited potent bone tissue-targeting activity and anti-osteoporosis
  efficacy in an ovariectomized mouse model. RDNVs, effectively internalized by hBMSCs,
  enhanced proliferation and ERα expression levels of hBMSC, and promoted osteogenic
  differentiation and bone formation. Mechanistically, via the ERα signaling pathway,
  RDNVs facilitated mRNA and protein expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 and
  runt-related transcription factor 2 in hBMSCs, which are involved in regulating
  osteogenic differentiation. Further analysis revealed that naringin, existing in
  RDNVs, was the active component targeting ERα in the osteogenic effect
