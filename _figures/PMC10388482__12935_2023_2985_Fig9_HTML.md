caption: Proposed model of SALL4’s role in gastric cancer angiogenesis. SALL4 functions
  as a transcription factor that binds to VEGF-A, B, and C promoters and activates
  their expression. Exosomal delivery of si-SALL4-B and thalidomide results in targeted
  inhibition of SALL4-B and VEGF-A, B, and C expression, leading to suppression of
  gastric cancer angiogenesis
