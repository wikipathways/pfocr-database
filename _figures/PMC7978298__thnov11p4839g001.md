caption: 'The primary generation and elimination mechanisms of intracellular ROS.
  (Ⅰ) The two major sources of endogenous ROS are mitochondrial ETC and NOXs: oxygen
  gains electrons leaked from complex Ⅰ, Ⅱ and Ⅲ of ETC to generate superoxide; NOXs
  transfer electrons from NADPH in the cytosol to oxygen at extracellular to produce
  superoxide; superoxide is dismutated to H2O2 by SOD for subsequent transmembrane
  transportation. (Ⅱ) Intracellular ROS are scavenged by three enzymatic antioxidants:
  PRXs, GPXs and CAT. PRXs and GPXs use NADPH as reducing equivalent; CAT use non-NADPH
  hydrogen donors. (Ⅲ) NADPH is synthesized in cytoplasm and mitochondria: cytosolic
  NADPH is primarily generated from PPP pathway; in mitochondria, GLUD generate NADPH
  by converting glutamate to α-KG; IDHs and MEs are contributed to NADPH pools both
  in the cytosol and mitochondrial by respectively catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation
  of isocitrate to α-KG and malate to pyruvate; one-carbon metabolism contributes
  to NADPH production both in cytosol and in mitochondria.'
