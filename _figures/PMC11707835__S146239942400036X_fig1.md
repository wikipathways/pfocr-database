caption: Chemokine signalling pathway.Chemokine receptor (CKR) remains in an inactive
  stage in which chemokine is not associated with it, and G-protein is in an inactive
  state and bound with GDP. CKR on interaction with specific chemokine triggers the
  activation of the bound heterotrimeric G-protein composed of αβγ subunits which
  leads to an exchange of GDP with GTP and dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein
  complex into Gα and Gβγ subunits where GTP remains attached to Gα subunit. Depending
  on the nature of the inducing signal and types of Gα protein, different signalling
  pathways get activated. (a) Gαi inhibits the activity of adenylate cyclase enzyme
  and reduces the cAMP generation; (b) Gαs stimulate the activity of adenylate cyclase
  enzyme and stimulates the production of cAMP which further activates PKA; (c) Gα12/13
  activates rho-family GTPase and regulate the actin cytoskeleton remodelling; (d)
  Gαq (or Gβγ) activate PLC-β enzyme which cleaves PIP2, located in the plasma membrane,
  into DAG molecules and intracellular secondary messenger IP3. DAG further activate
  PKC and IP3 binds to its receptor on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causing Ca2+ release
  into the cytoplasm; (d) Gβγ can also activate the Akt pathway, MAP kinase pathway,
  and Ca2+ dependent pathway. (d) Both the Gα and Gβγ subunits are capable of initiating
  a downstream signalling cascade that results in a range of cellular activities,
  including changes in cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration that ultimately regulate
  the physiological and pathological response of the cells
