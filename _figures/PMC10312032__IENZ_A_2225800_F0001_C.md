caption: '(A B). Pathway of canine uric acid. Schematic diagram of the canine uric
  acid pathway in human peripheral and brain. Modified from,. (A) In the periphery,
  tryptophan is metabolised into uric acid mainly by liver tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
  (TDO) (activated by glucocorticoids) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) (activated
  by inflammatory cytokines). After the first rate-limiting step, kynurenine is metabolised
  into kynurenic acid by kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) through the neuroprotective
  branch (A: 1-2-3), or into quinone by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) through the
  potential neurotoxic branch (A: 1-2-4-6-8). (B) Cytokines, tryptophan, kynurenin,
  and 3-hydroxyuric acid (3-HK) can cross the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain,
  cytokines and glucocorticoids stimulate the uric acid pathway, and inflammation
  increases the favourable neurotoxic quinone branch due to its activation of KMO.
  The quinone branch of the uric acid pathway mainly occurs in activated and resting
  microglia [branch] and infiltrating macrophages (B:1-2-3-5-7), while the kynurenic
  acid branch mainly occurs in astrocytes (B:1-2-3). HAA: 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid;
