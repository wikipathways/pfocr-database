caption: IPA Network analysis of targeted miRNAs. (A) IPA Network map of miRNA hits
  and their mRNA targets. Genes targeted by >1 miRNA hits are shown according to their
  subcellular localization. Arrows represent post-transcriptional silencing of genes
  by connected miRNA. Downregulated miRNA hits are shown in red, upregulated ones
  are in green, whereas gene targets likely to be upregulated are shaded in green,
  and those likely to be downregulated are shaded in orange. Gene icons shaded in
  white are targeted by both up and downregulated miRNA. (B) Pathway analysis results
  suggest upregulation of IL-6 family cytokines and those transcribed through the
  IL-6-response element (IL6RE). In the NF-κB signaling, TRAF6 and TAK1 are targets
  of hits miR-146a-5p and miR-322-5p. Downregulation of these hits may lead to upregulation
  of TRAF6 and TAK1 and increase the transcription of the IL6RE, resulting in increased
  mRNA levels of cytokines. Of these, IL-8 is directly targeted by miR-146a-5p and
  its levels could be particularly upregulated with depletion of this miRNA. Also
  of key import is the targeting of SOCS3 by the upregulated miRNA miR-203-3p. SOCS3
  is a negative regulator of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and is required to turn off the
  pathway to prevent excessive production of cytokines.
