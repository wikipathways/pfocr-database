caption: Possible mode of cell death pathway in Caco-2 cells. Red arrows show either
  up- or down-regulated genes. Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) was up-regulated,
  signaling its proactive role in the receptor induced pathway and involvement of
  Caspases that precede apoptotic nuclear damage. TP53 (p53) activates pro-apoptotic
  genes (BAK and BIK), resulting in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
  and subsequent release of mitochondrial apoptotic contents such as cytochrome C
  (Cyto C) and direct IAP binding protein with low pI (DIABLO). DIABLO deactivates
  inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) in order to potentiate apoptosis. Up-regulated
  CD27 and PYCARD are suggestive of an inflammatory response; however, NFKβ1 was neither
  up- nor down-regulated in Caco-2 cells, hence the uncertainty (?) regarding the
  involvement of inflammasomes.
