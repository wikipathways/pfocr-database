caption: In this figure, cycles are distinguished from paths in that TEM-1 (0000)
  is the first and last genotype visited, thus creating circular paths. An arrow indicates
  a substitution included in a mutational pathway which starts and ends at 0000, where
  the mutational pathway has a non-zero probability for the optimal treatment cycle.
  The substitutions that are included in optimal two steps cycles are shown in red.
  Substitutions that are included in optimal four and six step cycles are shown in
  blue. Four and six step cycles differ only in the number of substitutions and reversions
  that occur within each cycle. Their probabilities are identical.
