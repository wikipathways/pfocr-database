caption: The reverse TCA cycle is activated to replenish carbon loss due to dysfunctional
  electron transport chain (ETC) in CreTW cartilage and increases amino acid levels
  to activate the mTORC1 signaling pathway. mTORC1 hyperactivation disturbs organelle
  and ECM organization associated with age-related chondrocyte death and premature
  cartilage degeneration
