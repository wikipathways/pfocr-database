caption: 'CD44 structure and downstream signaling pathways, adapted from (). (A) Top:
  CD44 gene structure. CD44 full-length pre-mRNA consists of 20 (mice) or 19 (human)
  exons, the first and last 5 of which are constant and 9-10 exons in the middle are
  variable (v) exons regulated by alternative splicing. Bottom: standard (CD44s) and
  most widely studied cancer-associated alternatively spliced variant isoforms (CD44v3
  and CD44v6). Exon coloring parallels corresponding protein domains. (B) CD44 protein
  structure. Four main regions of the CD44 protein are presented with exon matching
  colors: constant extracellular ligand binding domain, variable extracellular domain,
  constant transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain. (C) Main CD44-mediated downstream
  signaling pathways. Canonical CD44 activation relies on extracellular ligand stimulation,
  such as HA and subsequent PI3K and MAPK pathway activation, which leads to cancer
  cell metabolic shift and resistance to apoptotic stimuli. Via intracellular ERM
  protein recruitment, the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 can either interact with VEGFR
  and support tumor angiogenesis or promote cytoskeletal changes and promote cancer
  cell invasion. Additionally, CD44 may act as a coreceptor for several receptor tyrosine
  kinases, such as Met, to facilitate cancer progression. ERM: ezrin, radixin, and
  moesin. VEGFR: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.'
