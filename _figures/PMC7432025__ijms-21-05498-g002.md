caption: A. baumannii forms biofilms on solid surfaces and pellicles at the air-liquid
  interface. (A) Extracellular appendages involved in biofilm/pellicle formation include
  exopolysaccharides (capsular polysaccharides, poly-β-(1–6)-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG),
  alginate), and pili []. Csu pili are assembled via the chaperone-usher pathway.
  The CsuE adhesin, which is located at the pilus tip, exposes three hydrophobic finger-like
  loops that may insert into cavities in abiotic surfaces []. Type IV pili (T4P) are
  composed of PilA subunits with variable amino-acid sequences in different A. baumannii
  strains. Depending on the PilA structure, the pili promote twitching motility or
  biofilm formation []. The chaperone–usher P pili are overproduced in A. baumannii
  pellicles []. The homotrimeric Ata autotransporter binds to extracellular matrix
  components and abiotic surfaces. The transmembrane anchor domain (TM) facilitates
  the export of the passenger domain (PSD) to the cell surface through a pore formed
  by the TM. Flexible PSDs allow interactions with different surfaces []. Bap and
  Bap-like proteins (BLP1, BLP2) stabilize the three-dimensional biofilm structure
  on abiotic surfaces and play a role in the adhesion of A. baumannii to the host
  cell [,]. Three resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pumps (AdeABC, AdeFGH,
  and AdeIJK) affect A. baumannii biofilm development [,,]. The AdeFGH efflux pump
  participates in the transport of quorum-sensing (QS) molecules []. OmpA is responsible
  for the attachment of A. baumannii to plastic surfaces and epithelial cells [].
  The CarO, OprC, and OprD porins may be involved in the uptake of metabolites required
  for the synthesis of siderophores in pellicles []. The iron uptake systems, including
  acinetobactin and enterobactin receptors, are upregulated during pellicle formation
  [,]. (B) The formation of the A. baumannii biofilm and pellicle is regulated by
  the nucleotide second messengers, two-component signal transduction systems, and
  QS. cAMP inhibits pellicle formation []. The synthesis of Csu pili depends on cyclic
  di-GMP (c-di-GMP) [] and the BfmRS and GacSA systems [,,]. The hybrid two-component
  regulator CheA/Y controls the expression of Csu pili and acinetin-505 via QS [,].
  The QS system of A. baumannii consists of an AbaI inducer and its cognate receptor
  AbaR. AbaI is an autoinducer synthase producing N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)
  molecules bound by AbaR. The AbaR–AHL complexes activate the synthesis of AbaI and
  the expression of QS-dependent genes, which in turn triggers the production of acinetin-505
  and Csu pili [,]. Biofilm formation may be inhibited by quorum-quenching (QQ) enzymes,
  which degrade AHLs [,], as well as high concentrations of FeIII ions that bind AHLs
  []. On the other hand, FeIII ions are required for pellicle development [,]. The
  AdeABC (controlled by the two-component signal transduction AdeRS system) and AdeFGH
  efflux pumps participate in biofilm formation [,]. However, other studies revealed
  that the overproduction of efflux pumps may result in decreased biofilm/pellicle
  growth []. ppGpp regulates the expression of genes encoding the efflux pump’s components
  [] and inhibits the production of AbaR and acinetin-505 [].
