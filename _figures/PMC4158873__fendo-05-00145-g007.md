caption: ChREBP activation is shown. ChREBP is phosphorylated by PKA. Dephosphorylation
  of Ser196 and Thr666 ChREBP is required for its translocation into the nucleus and
  DNA binding. A particular isoform of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), selectively
  activated by Xyl-5-P, an intermediate of pentose phosphate pathway, is responsible
  for both cytosolic and nuclear dephosphorylation of ChREBP. O-GlcNAcylation of ChREBP
  increases its protein level and transcriptional activity. Overexpression of FoxO1
  attenuates ChREBP activity.
