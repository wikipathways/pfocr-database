caption: The Musashi2 (Msi2) gene is a major factor in normal hematopoietic and leukemia
  stem cells. (A) The elevated level of Msi2 leads to the downregulation of the cell-fate
  determinant, Numb gene, which probably relates to other signaling pathways like
  Hedgehog and Notch. Numb may decrease the number of Leukemia stem cells via ITCH
  factor. ITCH ubiquitinates Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and GLi that are respectively
  the component of Notch and Hedgehog pathways. It is worth noting that Hedgehog and
  Notch pathways are important pathways that play significant roles in the self-renewal
  of resistant cancer stem cells. (B) The continued suppression of Numb gene is required
  to maintain the blast crisis in CML. While the increasing of Numb expression or
  the inhibition of Msi2 expression might lead to inhibition of the Notch signaling
  pathway. Therefore, the CML blastic phase is suppressed. This figure was drawn by
  the writer to summarize the pathways involved in cell fate
