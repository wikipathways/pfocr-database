caption: The role of unfolded protein response (UPR) in cell survival upon induction
  of ER stress. GRP78 is normally associated with PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. GRP78 disassociates
  from these molecules and binds to unfolded proteins as they accumulate, keeping
  them sequestered in the ER. Recruitment of GRP78 away from these molecules leads
  to their activation. PERK dimerizes and auto-phosphorylates upon removal of GRP78.
  It then phosphorylates eIF2α, which leads to inhibition of translation for most
  proteins, while UPR specific translation increases. One of those molecules upregulated
  is ATF4, which functions as a transcription factor and promotes the expression of
  proteins important in stress response. Upon release of GRP78, ATF6 travels to the
  Golgi where it is cleaved by S1P and S2P, resulting in a fragment that is active
  in promoting gene transcription. IRE1 dimerizes and auto phosphorylates as well
  upon removal of GRP78. It then can splice Xbp-1 mRNA, allowing for the production
  of a transcription factor that works in tandem with ATF6 to promote genes involved
  in protein folding and degradation. IRE1 activates the regulated IRE1-dependent
  decay (RIDD) pathway which results in the degradation of mRNAs, which reduces the
  load in the ER. All of these pathways promote cell survival.
