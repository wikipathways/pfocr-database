caption: '(a) The Omega 3 pathway. Arrows represent synthesis steps. Molecule colors
  indicate the dietary source of a given fatty acid: Green is plant based, blue is
  from marine sources, and grey are intermediates. When indicated, members of the
  fatty acid desaturase (FADS) family play a role in synthesis steps. (b) In response
  to cold temperatures, transient receptor protein (TRP) cation channels, including
  TRPM8, are activated in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons that innervate
  the skin.'
