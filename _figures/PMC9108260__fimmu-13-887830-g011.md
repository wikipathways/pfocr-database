caption: Inhibitory rhomboid proteins (iRHOM1/2) regulate TNF-α converting enzyme
  (TACE) membrane trafficking. Macrophages recognize M. paratuberculosis ManLAM through
  toll-like 2 receptors (TLR-2) and external mannose receptors (EMR). Upon binding,
  the p38 MAPK pathway is activated, which facilitates TACE trafficking from the ER
  to the cell surface via iRHOM1/2 regulation. Increasing TACE activity cleaves transmembranous
  TNF-α and induces TGFβRII shedding, which exacerbates inflammation and attenuates
  TGF-β signaling pathway. Silencing iRHOM1/2 downregulates TACE trafficking and maturation,
  which consequently decreases TNF-α cleavage and restores TGF-β signaling pathway.
