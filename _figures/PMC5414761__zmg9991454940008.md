caption: In the UrM, GDNF binds and activates the GFRα1/RET coreceptor complex, and
  subsequent RET-mediated signaling activates the MEK-ERK pathway, which up-regulates
  RET expression and stimulates proliferation of mesenchymal cells. In the UrE, GDNF
  binds and activates another coreceptor complex consisting of GFRα1 and a putative
  coreceptor signaling component (coRSC), and subsequent RET-independent signaling
  is responsible for increased proliferation of epithelial cells.
