caption: 'Cancer-derived TGF-β1 reshapes the epigenetic signature of normal stromal
  fibroblasts surrounding a growing tumor via SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent
  signaling pathways. For clarity’s sake, only the SMAD-dependent pathway is shown.
  TGF-β1 signaling induces changes in nuclear enzymes and regulatory proteins such
  as DNMTs, histone-modifying enzymes and BET proteins governing the multi-tiered
  epigenetic program of fibroblast cells. The outcome is chromatin reprogramming and
  the generation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of pro-tumorigenic CAFs bearing
  a stable phenotype. CAFs, in turn, secrete TGF-β1 and therefore participate in a
  vicious pro-tumorigenic cycle shown in . Target candidate genes denote stromal fibroblast
  genes known to be regulated by TGF-β for which, in contrast to target genes, experimental
  evidence for TGF-β reshaping of epigenetic landscape is, to date, circumstantial.
  This figure is based on selected papers discussed in the review presenting evidence
  for TGF-β1-induced alterations in the epigenetic signature of stromal fibroblasts
  during trans-differentiation to CAFs in cancer (target genes) or in myofibroblasts
  resident in non-neoplastic fibrotic loci (candidate genes). Green arrow: up-regulation.
  Red arrow: down-regulation. In brackets: the coded protein. Co-F: co-factors.'
