caption: Mechanisms of action for therapies used in LTP of HAE.,  Mechanisms of action
  for therapeutic agents in treating or preventing HAE. Multiple pathways are capable
  of complement activation and generating inflammatory mediators including complement
  anaphylatoxins C3a and, more important, C5a. Activation of the final complement
  cascade produces a membrane attack complex that produces cellular injury. Angioedema
  occurs after tissue injury from multiple causes. Tissue injury can activate contact
  activation (Hageman factor or factor XII) to generate kallikrein from prekallikrein,
  its precursor. Kallikrein in turn generates and activates plasmin from plasminogen,
  and plasmin can directly activate the C1 esterase complex to initiate complement
  activation. Under normal circumstances, C1INH functions to inhibit both complement
  activation and, to a lesser extent, modulate contact activation. In HAE‐C1INH, because
  of quantitative or qualitative defective C1INH, the pathway proceeds unchecked,
  generating mediators that increase capillary permeability to produce angioedema.
  Therapeutic approaches for LTP of HAE include restoring C1INH levels with C1INH
  replacement or inhibiting kallikrein with lanadelumab or berotralstat. Attenuated
  androgens have been used as second‐line options to increase liver synthesis of C1INH.
