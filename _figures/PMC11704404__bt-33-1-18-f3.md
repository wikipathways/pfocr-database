caption: 'Regulation of NF-κB signaling by AMPK and its downstream effectors in chronic
  low-grade inflammation. In chronic low-grade inflammation, upon stimulation by inflammatory
  cytokines, the IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα, leading to its ubiquitination and
  proteasomal degradation. Oxidative stress further exacerbates this degradation by
  phosphorylating IκBα, resulting in the release of NF-κB family members (RelA/p50),
  which translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of target proinflammatory
  genes. In contrast, under conditions of energy stress, AMPK inhibits this pathway
  through several mechanisms: directly phosphorylating IKKβ and indirectly activating
  SIRT1, PGC-1α, and p53. SIRT1 deacetylates the RelA (p65) subunit of NF-κB, while
  PGC-1α physically blocks its binding to DNA. Additionally, p53 indirectly inhibits
  IKKβ by suppressing glycolytic activity, which is linked to reduced IKKβ phosphorylation
  and activity. When glycolysis is downregulated, the O-glycosylation of IKKβ (which
  normally enhances its activity) is reduced, leading to a decrease in IKKβ’s ability
  to phosphorylate IκBα, thereby reducing NF-κB activity. IκB kinase, IKK; Nuclear
