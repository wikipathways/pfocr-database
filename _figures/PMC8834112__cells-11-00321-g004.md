caption: Intracellular signaling and actin polymerization during myoblast fusion.
  After the establishment of the Duf–Sns adhesive interaction, intracellular proteins
  are recruited myoblast-type specifically to the myoblast membrane. In response to
  WAVE activation in founder cells, the Arp2/3 nucleates a thin sheath of F-actin
  at the site of cell–cell contact. Additionally, the Rho1–Rok–MyoII pathway becomes
  activated in founder cells. In fusion-competent myoblasts, the activation of WAVE
  and WASp promotes Arp2/3-depemdent F-actin polymerization, which results in the
  formation of an F-actin-enriched focus.
