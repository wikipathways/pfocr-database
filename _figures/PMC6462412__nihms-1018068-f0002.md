caption: 'DNA repair pathways—a toolkit for viral replication. (a) Classical nonhomologous
  end joining occurs through limited DNA end processing and religation. This repair
  pathway is thought to mediate viral genome integration into host genomes and can
  also affect concatemer formation. (b) Homologous recombination repair is triggered
  when DNA ends are extensively resected and coated with RPA. Subsequently, the recruitment
  of RAD51 by the action of BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 leads to homology search and the
  formation of a displacement loop (D loop) upon invasion of the homologous template.
  D loops are resolved by synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) or by processing
  of a Holliday junction (HJ). The latter processes can be achieved through the actions
  of endonucleases (resolution) or by combining the activities of a helicase and a
  topoisomerase (dissolution). Many viruses have been reported to rely on homologous
  recombination repair to replicate. For example, the endonuclease activity ofMREll
  as well as the resolvase processes intermediates created upon replication of circular
  genomes and concatemers. (c) Stalled or stressed replication forks can either restart
  or collapse. Stabilization of the fork by ATR enables the fork to bypass a DNA lesion
  and restart (). Alternatively, the fork can be processed by nucleases (MRE11, DNA2,WRN,
  EXO1, CtIP) and translocases (ZRANB3, SMARCAL1). BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, and FANCD2
  protect forks from extended resection in this process. This pathway is particularly
  important to support high levels of viral replication where viral helicases may
  be more prone to collapse. Virus abbreviations: EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HPV, human
