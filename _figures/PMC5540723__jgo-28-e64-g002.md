caption: Primary immune checkpoint inhibitors in cells. T cells recognize the MHC-antigen
  complex through TCR. The ligation of PD-1 with PD-L1/PD-L2 triggers a negative signal
  in T cells. CTLA-4 competes with CD28 to bind to the costimulatory molecules B7-1
  and B7-2 on APCs, mediating an inhibitory signal that leads to the suppression of
  T cell activation. IgV-like regions are depicted in blue and IgC-like regions in
  green.APC, antigen-presenting cell; CD, cluster of differentiation; CTLA-4, cytotoxic
  T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4; IgC, immunoglobulin constant; IgV, immunoglobulin
  variable; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PD-1, programmed death-1; PD-L1,
  programmed death-ligand 1; PD-L2, programmed death-ligand 2; TCR, T cell receptor.
