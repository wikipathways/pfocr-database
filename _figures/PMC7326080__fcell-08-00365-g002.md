caption: TNF induced cell death signaling. Inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK signaling
  can divert TNF-mediated signaling to the formation of an intracellular complex II
  centered on FADD and caspase-8 in a RIP1-dependent apoptotic cell death. This cell
  death pathway can be augmented by A20 or by the absence of the E3 ligases c-IAP1/2
  or LUBAC, thereby eliminating the ubiquitination of complex I components and promoting
  the switch to complex II. Activation of RIP1-dependent cell death under caspase-8
  inhibited or deficient conditions can lead to a necroptotic form of cell death that
  is mediated by kinase activity of RIP1 and RIP3, and results in the activation of
  MLKL and membrane permeabilization.
