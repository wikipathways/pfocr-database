caption: Involvement of the lysosome–autophagosome and ubiquitin–proteasome systems
  in acetylcholine receptor turnover at the neuromuscular junction. In the Golgi apparatus,
  newly formed nicotinic acetylcholine rectors (nAChR) are shuttled to the sarcolemma
  by rapsyn, where under the motor neuron terminal, they cluster together. Turnover
  of nAChRs begins with endocytosis, and then depending on the signaling pathway activated,
  the receptors are recycled or degraded. Activation of PKA or CaMKII leads to recycling,
  while activation of PKC or inhibition of PKA or CAMKII leads to degradation via
  autophagy. Under atrophy conditions, such as denervation, nAChR degradation is increased
  and MuRF1 has been shown to colocalize with endocytosed nAChRs and components of
  the autophagosome. Furthermore, decreases in sympathetic input at the NMJ has been
  shown to increase nAChR turnover through a HDAC4-myogenin-MuRF1 axis. Created with
