caption: 'Fumarate, accumulated upon FH loss, leads to a post translational modification
  of cysteine residues of a variety of proteins (violet hexagons) called succination.
  The chemical reaction between fumarate and reactive thiol residues of proteins is
  in depicted in the insert. Succination of KEAP1 causes the stabilisation and activation
  of the NRF2-mediated anti-oxidant response. One of the targets of NRF2 is Haem Oxygenase
  1 (HMOX1), which is required for the haem biosynthesis and degradation pathway,
  an essential pathway for the survival of FH-deficient cells. Succination of Iron
  Responsive Element Binding Protein 2 (IRP2) inhibits the repressive function of
  this protein on the translation of ferritin. The subsequent increase in ferritin
  causes a drop in free intracellular iron. In parallel, ferritin promotes the expression
  of Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1), a pro-mitotic protein that supports cell growth.
  Succination of the Fe-S cluster proteins Nfu1, Bola and Iscu impairs the Fe-S clusters
  assembly required by the electron transport chain complex I, contributing to defects
  in mitochondrial respiration. The reduction of iron and the succination of key cysteine
  residues in its catalytic core also inactivates the TCA cycle enzyme Aconitase 2
  (ACO2). In the nucleus, the succination of SWI/SNF complex protein SMARCC1 inactivates
  this complex, affecting gene expression and chromatin remodelling. Finally, GSH
  succination causes the depletion of glutathione (GSH) stores, increasing oxidative
  stress, and triggering senescence in primary FH-deficient cells. CI-V=electron transport
