caption: General signalling responses during plant interactions with symbionts and
  pathogens. Rhizobia and AM fungi produce signals (Nod factor for Rhizobia and Myc
  factor for AM fungi) that are perceived by the plant’s cognate receptor(s). These
  signals activate downstream responses via a common symbiosis (SYM) pathway (grey
  box). The CCamK may be differentially perceiving or transmitting the calcium signal,
  leading to activation of rhizobia and AM specific transcription factors and subsequent
  downstream responses. For more details of AM and rhizobial symbioses, refer to the
  recent reviews of Parneske (2008) and . Plant pathogens are also perceived by the
  plant by receptors and during incompatible interactions, they trigger many downstream
  responses, including the production of defence signalling hormones such as ET, SA
  and JA. Interestingly, certain rhizobia and Nod factors can negatively regulate
  production or accumulation of these hormones (; ). ET, SA and JA negatively regulateCa2+
  spiking and other Nod factor induced responses (). Auxin and cytokinin signalling
  pathways can be manipulated by certain pathogens to facilitate infection processes.
  They also regulate nodule specific transcription factors and are required for nodule
  organogenesis (; ). AM, arbuscular mycorrhiza; LRR-RLK, leucine rich repeat receptor-like
  kinase; CCamK, calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase; ET, ethylene; JA, jasmonic
  acid; SA, salicylic acid; PPA, pre-penetration apparatus; TF, transcription factors.
