caption: Diagram to show how the entropic output from serpentinization fuels an emergent
  metabolic engine within the concomitantly precipitated alkaline hydrothermal mound
  with methane and hydrogen, augmented by pyrophosphate condensation driven by the
  ambient proton motive force. The natural titration of the alkaline hydrothermal
  solution with the acidulous ocean leads to precipitation of chemical garden-like
  compartments. A secondary acidulous ocean current bearing the oxidants is convectively
  driven by heat emanating from the mound and also pulled upward by entrainment in
  a manner comparable to a carburettor so that the reductants—delivered at a similar
  rate to the oxidants—are partially oxidized to organic intermediates [,,]. Reactions
  are catalysed by the (dislocated) surfaces of transition metal sulfides or in the
  interlayers of green rust acting here as a di-iron methane monooxygenase [,]. The
  specific model engines argued here to have driven the first metabolic pathway are
  (i) electron bifurcation on Mo-sulfides reduced by H2 in a two-electron reaction
  but ejecting these electrons in a gated manner towards a high potential acceptor
  (such as nitrate or nitrite) and a low potential iron–nickel–sulfur-containing mineral
  such as violarite [,,]. This low potential mineral is considered to achieve reduction
  of CO2 to CO in a reaction reminiscent of that at the catalytic metal cluster of
  CO-dehydrogenase (CODH); (ii) positive redox feedback loop in the reaction sequence
  from CH4 through CH3OH to CH2O. CH4 activation towards integration of an oxygen
  atom (resulting from NO produced by engine 1) requires reducing equivalents which
  are provided by the (lower midpoint potential) subsequent oxidation step of CH3OH
  to CH2O; (iii) condensation of the two C1-moieties issued from the high and low
  potential branches (i) and (ii) into acetate or an acetyl moiety on greigite [,];
  (iv) a pyrophosphatase engine comprising green rust interlayers where water activity
  is close to zero, opens at the oxidized exterior through positive charge repulsion
  as the ferrous iron is oxidized () [,], allowing protons access to the interior
  which pull orthophosphates by charge attraction (2×HPO42− or Pi2−) into the subnanometric
  compartments. Clamped by the ferric iron atoms bordering the walls of the interlayers,
  neighbouring orthophosphates condense to the pyrophosphate (which has an overall
  lower charge as HP2O73− or PPi3−) on interaction with protons. The flux of the remaining
  protons drives the pyrophosphates towards the rear exit of the green rust nanocrysts
  where they phosphorylate organic intermediates produced by engine 1.
