caption: A Putative Model of Central Carbon and Energy Metabolism in Tomato GTs.A
  type VI glandular cell with its plasma membrane as a black line. The three main
  compartments involved (chloroplast, cytosol, and mitochondria) are indicated in
  blue. The yellow star represents the sun, which emits light of photosynthetically
  active wavelengths (λ). These allow the photosystems in thylakoid membranes (represented
  by stacks of green horizontal bars) to produce chemical energy (ATP) and reducing
  power (NADPH). Photosynthesis and metabolic activity are accompanied by the production
  of , which are detoxified by  and glutathione. CO2 is in red in reactions where
  it is released and in green in reactions where it is fixed. Black arrows between
  metabolites represent either metabolic pathways or reactions that are discussed
  in detail in the main text. AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; C6, hexose; CIT, citrate; DMAPP,
  dimethylallyl diphosphate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate;
  MAL, malate; OA, oxaloacetate; OPP, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway; Rib5P,
  ribulose-5-phosphate.
