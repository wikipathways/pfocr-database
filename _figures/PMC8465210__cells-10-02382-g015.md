caption: The c-Met/Crk/JNK pathway is enhanced by GAB1 and c-Cbl by promoting JNK
  phosphorylation. (A) c-Met is activated by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), leading
  to its autophosphorylation. The adaptor protein, Gab1, recognizes and binds to phosphotyrosine
  residues on activated c-Met. Then c-Met phosphorylates Gab1 and enables it to recruit
  Crk (via Tyr residue) to promote JNK phosphorylation. (B) Similarly, c-Cbl also
  recognizes and binds to the phosphotyrosine residues on activated c-Met. Subsequently,
  c-Cbl is phosphorylated by c-Met-induced Src kinases at either Tyr700 or Tyr774,
  which enables the recruitment of Crk and the enhancement of JNK phosphorylation.
  In addition, c-Cbl simultaneously ubiquitinates the c-Met receptor, resulting in
  its degradation. Both c-Cbl and GAB1 enhance JNK phosphorylation, which promotes
  cellular transformation.
