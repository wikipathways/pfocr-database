caption: Schematic illustration of the role and regulatory effects of MCP-1 and IL-8
  in human TM cells. CMV or HSV-1 infection in human TM cells dramatically increases
  the expression of inflammatory chemokines MCP-1 and IL-8 as well as TGF-β, which
  is also increased in the aqueous humor of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). TM
  cells express the receptors of MCP-1 and IL-8 (CCR2 and CXCR1, respectively), and
  MCP-1 and IL-8 are augmented in an autocrine manner, and exhibited reciprocal regulatory
  effects on each other, while TGF-β inhibited the expression of MCP-1 and IL-8. Short-term
  treatment with MCP-1 and IL-8 increases the focal adhesion, actin reorganization,
  and stress fibers via Rho-A pathway, which collectively increases TM cell contractibility.
  Long-term treatment with MCP-1 and IL-8 enhanced EMT markers, ECM accumulation and
  TM cell migration, indicating increased fibrogenic activity and cell plasticity.
  This short term and long-term effects of inflammatory chemokines might contribute
  to the increased resistance to the aqueous humor outflow facility in hypertensive
  anterior uveitis and POAG.
