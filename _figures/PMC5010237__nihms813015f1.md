caption: 'Processing of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by α, β and γ secretases.
  The proteolytic cleavage in non-amyloidogenic pathway by α secretase within the
  Aβ sequence and γ secretase resulting in the formation of soluble APP fragments:
  APPsα, p3 and p7. The APP processing by secretases β and γ in the amyloidogenic
  pathway leads to the formation of C-terminal APP domain AICD and soluble Aβ37–40
  or insoluble Aβ42, which depends on the γ secretase cleaving site. Aβ42 aggregates
  into amyloid plaques in the brain tissue.'
