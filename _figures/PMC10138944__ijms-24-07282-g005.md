caption: 'Proposed mechanism through which insulin promotes BVRA protein levels changes
  depending on the regulatory role for BVRA within the insulin signaling pathway.
  Upstream in the pathway (red oval): Under physiological conditions, the insulin
  receptor (IR) activation promotes the phosphorylation of its direct substrate (IRS1)
  on specific tyrosine (Y) residues. In parallel, IR phosphorylates BVRA on specific
  Y residues and activates BVRA to function as S/T/Y kinase. Then, as part of a regulatory
  loop, BVRA phosphorylates IRS1 on inhibitory serine (S) residues (e.g., S307) to
  avoid IRS1 aberrant activation in response to IR. In subjects with reduced insulin
  sensitivity, a greater decrease in BVRA protein levels can be observed in response
  to insulin to favor IRS1 activation. Downstream in the pathway (blue oval): Once
  activated, IRS1 works as a scaffold protein, driving the activation of the two main
  arms of the insulin signaling: (1) the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway (ERK1/2) mainly involved
  in gene transcription and (2) the PI3K/Akt axis that is critical for glucose uptake
  as well as for protein and lipid metabolism. Within both axes, BVRA works as a kinase
  or as a scaffold protein facilitating (1) the ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the subsequent
  translocation in the nucleus; (2) the PDK1-mediated activation of AKT; and (3) the
  PDK1-mediated activation of the atypical PKCζ; both these latter events are needed
  for GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane to increase glucose uptake. See text
  for more details. In subjects with reduced insulin sensitivity, a greater increase
  in BVRA protein levels can be observed in response to insulin to favor the activation
  of MAPK and AKT axes. Green arrows refer to BVRA protein levels; blue arrows refer
  to the molecular events regulated by BVRA.'
