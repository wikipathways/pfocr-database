caption: 'Biosynthesis pathway of phenylpropanoid in P. chienii and the differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in four organs of
  P. chienii. (a) A simplified diagram of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway.

  phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in four organs. PAL: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H:
  trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase; 4CL: 4-coumarate CoA ligase; CCR: cinnamoyl-CoA
  reductase; HCT: shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase; C3H: 5-O-(4-coumaroyl)-d-quinate
  3′-monooxygenase; CAD: cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase; POD: peroxidase; CSE: caffeoyl
  shikimate esterase; COMT: caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase; CCoAOMT: caffeoyl-CoA
