caption: Main signaling pathways involved in CD19-BBζ T cells and CD19-28ζ T cells.
  a A high mitochondrial respiratory capacity promotes metabolism and differentiation.
  4-1BB domain signaling activates the PI3K pathway and upregulates Bcl-xL and BFL-1
  expression. Tonic CAR-derived 4-1BB signaling activates the NF-B pathway and enhances
  FAS-dependent apoptosis. CD19-BBζ T cells diminish the expression of exhaustion-associated
  molecules more than CD19-28ζ T cells. b The main signaling pathways involved in
  CD19-28ζ T cells. CAR T cell inhibition induced by regulatory T cells, IL-10 and
  TGF-β can be reduced by the incorporation of the CD28 domain. CD19-28ζ T cells exhibit
  enhanced activation of the transcription factor NF-B and promote cytokine secretion.
  CD19-28ζ T cells are more likely to result in the development of severe CRS than
  CD19-BBζ T cells. However, tonic CAR CD3ζ phosphorylation triggered by clustering
  of the CAR single-chain variable fragment (scFv) leads to more rapid exhaustion
