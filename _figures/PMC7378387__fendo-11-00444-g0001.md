caption: Brain reward circuitry involved in central effects of sweeteners. The dopaminergic
  pathway is strictly involved in hedonic processes (“liking”), reinforcement (“learning”),
  and motivation (“wanting”). Midbrain dopaminergic circuits include Lateral Hypothalamus
  (LHA), Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), and Nucleus Accumbens (NAc). Dopamine release
  is driven by orexin (ORX) peptides and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) secreted
  by LHA. In particular, ORX and MCH neurons from LHA project to VTA, where Orx peptides
  and MCH mediate the activation of dopamine (DA) neurons and increase the release
  of DA in projection areas such as the NAc. It has been established that dopamine
  reward pathway response induced by caloric sweeteners consumption, such as sucrose,
  is greater compared to non-calorie sweetener sucralose. Interestingly, a preclinical
  study provided evidence that MCH neurons account for the natural preference for
  sucrose over sucralose and that such effect can be reversed by stimulating MCH neurons
  with light. This suggests that non calorie-sweeteners require additional stimuli
  to obtain the same rewarding effect of sucrose.
