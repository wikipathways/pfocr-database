caption: 'Immune response mechanism after the administration of BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech
  vaccine. After its administration, the vaccine, which is composed of lipid nanoparticles
  with encapsulated mRNA, induced the production of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2
  in the host cells. After its recognition by the immune system, it generates a specific
  cellular and humoral immune response. Released antibodies promote ADCC, CDC, opsonization,
  neutralization, and complement activation (classical pathway). ACE2: angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2; APC: antigen presenting cell; MHC-I: major histocompatibility complex
  type I; MHC-II: major histocompatibility complex type II; Tfh: T follicular cell;
