caption: Mosquito immune signaling and RNAi pathways. In Toll pathway signaling, detection
  of pathogen-derived ligands by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as PGRP-SA
  and -SD triggers proteolytic cleavage of the cytokine Späetzle, which binds to and
  activates the Toll receptor. This triggers signaling through the adaptor proteins
  MyD88, Tube, and Pelle, resulting in the phosphorylation and degradation of Cactus,
  a negative regulator which binds to and sequesters the Rel1 transcription factor
  in the cytoplasm. Cactus degradation allows Rel1 translocation to the nucleus to
  activate transcription of Toll-pathway regulated genes. The IMD pathway is activated
  by ligand binding to PGRP-LCs and -LEs. This triggers signaling through IMD and
  various caspases and kinases, leading to a functional split in the pathway. One
  branch triggers JNK signaling to activate the transcription factor AP1, while the
  other results in the phosphorylation of the Rel2 transcription factor and its subsequent
  DREDD-mediated cleavage. Activated Rel2 translocates to the nucleus to activate
  IMD-regulated transcription. The JAK-STAT pathway is triggered by Unpaired (Upd)
  binding to the receptor Dome, activating the receptor-associated Hop Janus kinases,
  which phosphorylate each other and subsequently recruit and phosphorylate the STAT
  transcription factor. Phosphorylated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus
  to activate JAK-STAT-regulated transcription. The exogenous siRNA pathway is activated
  when virus-derived long dsRNA is recognized and cleaved by Dcr2 into siRNAs, usually
  21 bp in length. siRNAs are loaded onto the multi-protein RISC complex, which degrades
  one strand of the duplex and uses the other for targeted degradation of complementary
  single stranded viral RNA. Sensing of viral dsRNA by Dcr2 also activates TRAF, leading
  to Rel2 cleavage and activation via a distinct pathway. Rel2 activates transcription
  of Vago, a secreted peptide which subsequently triggers JAK-STAT pathway signaling.
