caption: 'The inferred and enriched PPI network from 43 genes that sensitize yeast
  to Mn when deleted. Analysis performed using the String database. Network properties
  are as follows: The minimum required interaction score, to be included at the predicted
  network, was accepted with a threshold on the high confidence equal 0.7; Number
  of nodes: 143; Number of edges: 594; Expected number of edges: 287; Average (avg)
  node degree: 8.31; avg. local clustering coefficient: 0.652; PPI enrichment p-value:
  <1.0e-16. Nodes and edges represent proteins and PPIs, respectively. Red nodes (protein
  processing in endoplasmic reticulum); blue nodes (metabolic pathways); dark green
  nodes (N-Glycan biosynthesis); cyan nodes (cell cycle); yellow nodes (ubiquitin-mediated
  proteolysis); orange nodes (meiosis); maroon nodes (DNA replication); purple nodes
  (amino acid biosynthesis); magenta nodes (arginine and proline metabolism); lime
  green nodes (alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism). The protein with black
  points in the center represent the MAPK signaling pathway. Proteins that are not
  connected to at least one partner are not shown.'
