caption: 'Metabolic model used for the determination of intracellular fluxes. Free
  net fluxes are indicated with red arrows, while free exchange fluxes are indicated
  with red circles. All other exchange fluxes were constrained to zero during parameter
  fitting. The direction of arrows indicates the direction of positive flux as defined
  in the model. Flux names are given in italics. Abbreviations: fum (fumarate), OAA
  (oxaloacetate), cit (citrate), αKG (α-ketoglutarate). Standard abbreviations of
  amino acid names are used. Dashed boxes indicated where the subcellular localization
  of a metabolite or reaction cannot be inferred from the data or from the literature.
  The letters “p”, “c,” and “m” preceding metabolite names indicate separate pools
  of that metabolite in the plastid, cytosol, and mitochondrion, respectively. PPP
  indicates the pentose phosphate pathway. Output of CO2 from the system is included
  in the model but not illustrated here.'
