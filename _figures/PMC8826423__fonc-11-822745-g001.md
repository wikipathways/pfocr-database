caption: Network of competitive endogenous RNAs. (A) mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs
  all contain microRNA (miRNA) response elements (MREs) that can bind to miRNAs and
  regulate the expression of RNA targets at the post-transcriptional level. (B) LINC01133
  exerts oncogenic effect by acting as a sponge for miR-106-3p, which regulates the
  expression of APC and inactivates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. circCYFIP2
  exerts oncogenic effect by acting as a sponge for miR-1205, which regulates the
  expression of E2F1. miRNA-204 inhibits the transcription of CKS1B, CXCL1 and GPRC5A
  mRNAs by binding to AGO2 to form the RISC complex, which ultimately inhibits the
  proliferation of GC.
