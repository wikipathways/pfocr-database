caption: Biosynthetic pathways of the major volatile compound classes and selected
  examples of volatiles from these classes that are discussed in this review. Fatty
  acid‐derived VOCs (including GLVs and methyljasmonate) are produced from C18 fatty
  acids, produced through the acetate pathway that gets its substrate, acetyl‐coA,
  from glycolysis (Fu et al., ). Acetyl‐coA from glycolysis is also the substrate
  for the cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway, while pyruvate from glycolysis is
  the substrate for the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway (Beyraghdar
  Kashkooli et al., ; Pichersky and Raguso, ). The benzenoids and phenylpropanoids
  are produced through the shikimate pathway that gets its substrates from glycolysis
  and the pentose phosphate pathway (Widhalm et al., ; Santos‐Sánchez et al., ).
