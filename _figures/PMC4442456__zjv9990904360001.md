caption: Changes in the expression of cell cycle-related genes during MNV-1 infection.
  Asynchronously growing RAW264.7 cells were mock infected or MNV-1 infected for 18
  h prior to RNA extraction, and gene expression was analyzed by Affymetrix Mouse
  430 2.0 microarrays (as described in Materials and Methods). Only the genes in the
  “Cell cycle (Mus musculus)” pathway (WP190) are shown; the full set of data is available
  from NCBI GEO (accession no. GSE61562). Genes with higher mRNA expression are shown
  in orange to red (2-fold), and those with lower levels are in shades of green (5-fold).
  Those in darkest green are reduced >5-fold. Visualization used PathVisio (). When
  multiple Affymetrix probe sets correspond to a gene, more than one bar is shown.
  Several of the downregulated cyclin genes (designated with the format Ccnxx [e.g.,
  Ccna2 and Ccnb2]) showed highly significant reductions and were chosen for further
  study.
