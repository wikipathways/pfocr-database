caption: A, the insulin receptor family includes the insulin receptor (IR) in two
  isoforms (IR-A and IR-B), the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R),
  and the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptor (IGF-2R). IR and IGF-1R are expressed
  as preformed dimers, either homodimers or heterodimers. IGF-2R is a non-signaling
  receptor that acts as a “sink” for IGF-2. Insulin binds primarily to IR-A or IR-B,
  but also has weak affinity for IGF-1R. IGF-1 and IGF-2 are ligands for the IGF-1R
  and IGF-1R/IR hybrid receptor along with IR-A. Insulin-like growth factor binding
  proteins (IGFBPs) bind to and prevent IGF-1 and IGF-2 from activating receptor signaling
  cascades. B, signaling of the IGF-1R/IR system is mediated by the insulin receptor
  substrate (IRS) and Shc. PI3K-AKT activation is the predominant downstream event
  of IGF-1R/IR, but the MAPK pathway can also be activated.
