caption: . Metabolic reprogramming into M1 phenotype. Stimulation with LPS, INF-γ,
  or TNFα of macrophages favors a reprogramming toward the pro-inflammatory phenotype.
  One of the very first events is the TCA cycle halt resulting in the accumulation
  of citrate and succinate. The dysfunction of the TCA cycle activates a metabolic
  process known as the “Warburg effect.” The accumulation of succinate inhibits the
  succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) increasing the level of HIF-1α, a signaling molecule
  characteristic of the M1 phenotype. Inducible NO synthase, adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, ROS, and other pathways are also involved in this
  metabolic system. See text for details.
