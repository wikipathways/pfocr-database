caption: Nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic pathways. When cortical neurons
  activate the NMDA receptors on neurons of the direct pathway (red) in the striatum,
  striatal neurons are primed to send GABA signals to the SNr/GPi, which would inhibit
  the tonic GABA to the thalamus, allow glutamate signals to fire in the cortex, and
  further activate cortical neurons. The indirect pathway (blue) is primed when cortical
  neurons activate the NMDA receptors on the striatal neurons that express D2 receptors,
  which would send inhibitory signals to the globus pallidus externa (GPe), reduce
  GABA signaling to the STN, and stimulate the SNr/GPi to enhance GABA inhibiting
  of thalamocortical signaling. The mesolimbic pathway (green) consist of dopaminergic
  projections from the VTA to the NAcc, which sends inhibitory signals to the SNr/GPi.
  The mesocortical pathway (orange) consists of dopaminergic projections from the
  VTA to the cortex, innervating both pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons which express
  D1 receptors. Reciprocal pathways (purple) from the cortex to the VTA and NAcc provide
  cortical feedback to subcortical structures. CTX, cortex; GABA, gamma-aminobutyric
  acid; NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate; GPe, globus pallidus externa; SNr, substantia
  nigra pars reticulata; GPi, globus pallidus interna; TH, thalamus; STN, sub thalamic
  nucleus; NAcc, nucleus accumbens core; VTA, ventral tegmental area. Round structures
  indicate dopamine cell bodies; star shaped structures indicate GABA cell bodies;
  triangular structures indicate glutamate cell bodies.
