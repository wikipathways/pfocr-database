caption: 'Normal pregnancy induced physiological remodeling which largely returned
  to baseline shortly after delivery (). However, mice with preexisting MetS showed
  signs of pathological remodeling after pregnancy (). Increased metabolic processes
  led to an activation of TNFα signaling pathway (–). As a downstream factor of the
  TNFα pathway, Angptl4 gene expression level was upregulated (). Angptl4 activated
  cultured cardiac primary fibroblast migration, proliferation, and activation (–),
  which may interface dysregulated metabolism in mice with MetS with pathological
  cardiac remodeling during pregnancy in mice with MetS. The aberrant cardiac remodeling
  could lead to long-term abnormalities after pregnancy in mice with MetS () and predispose
  those mice to increased risks of future adverse cardiac remodeling when challenged
  with pathological stimuli (). (CSA: cross-sectional area, TNFα: Tumor necrosis factor
  alpha, Angptl4: Angiopoietin like protein 4).'
