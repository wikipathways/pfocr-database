  description: Lipid metabolic alterations induced by oncogenic events and TME cues.
    Alterations in lipid metabolism in tumor cells are driven by oncogenic events
    and tumor environmental cues, such as hypoxia and nutritional deficiency conditions.
    a Activating mutations in oncogenes (such as MYC) and inactivation of tumor suppressor
    genes (such as p53 and PTEN) often occur in various tumor cells. Alterations in
    these genes subsequently upregulate the expression of key enzymes involved in
    lipid metabolism by regulating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway to activate
    transcriptional activity of SREBPs, or acting directly on key enzymes. As a consequence,
    lipid metabolism in tumor cells is enhanced. b TME encompasses various factors
    such as hypoxia, acidosis, and nutrient deficiency that promote tumorigenesis
    and cancer progression through reprogramming lipid metabolism in tumors. Lipid
    uptake, synthesis, and intracellular lipid accumulation are significantly upregulated
    in TME by activating key signaling pathways and enzymes
