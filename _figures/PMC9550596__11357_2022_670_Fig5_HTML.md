caption: Strategies of the Nipah virus (NiV) to modulate and evade the type I interferon
  (IFN-I) synthesis and signaling. (a) Once the NiV infection occurs, viral RNA is
  released, which activates PRRs (TLR and RLR) pathways in the cell, leading to the
  activation of IFN-I and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Different NiV proteins are
  able to interfere these pathways using several strategies. NiV-V disrupts MDA5 stimulation
  and subsequent RIG-I activation. NiV-C protein frustrates the activation of IRF3
  and IRF7/8 by affecting the IKK dimerization. NiV-W protein prevents nuclear transport
  of phosphorylated IRF3/7 dimers. In addition, NiV-V protein inhibits RIG-I activation
  and its signaling pathway. NiV-M gene expression highlighted the effect of NiV-M
  could also degrade TRIM6 and IKK-dependent signaling. (b) NiV-induced production
  of IFN-I leads to the stimulation of IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) and subsequent anti-viral
  signaling, which could be interrupted by several NiV proteins. NiV-N could impede
  nuclear import of STAT1/2 dimer, while NiV-M triggers degradation of TRIM6 and disrupts
  subsequent IKK, TBK1, and STAT1/2 phosphorylation. NiV-P and V could interfere with
  STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation while NiV-W prevents their nuclear exportation
