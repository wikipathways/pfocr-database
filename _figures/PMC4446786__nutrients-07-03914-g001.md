caption: Intracellular mechanisms activated by leucine. The mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex 1 (mTORC1) comprises mTOR, Raptor, mLST8, PRAS40, and DEPTOR. mTORC1 is
  activated by amino acids (especially leucine) as well as by hormones such as leptin,
  insulin, and IGF-1. mTORC1 can be activated by different pathways. Hormonal activation
  primarily occurs through the TSC complex. However, amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation
  occurs through the Rag complex. The leucyl-tRNA synthetase is responsible for sensing
  leucine cellular levels and activating the Rag complex. The cellular uptake of L-glutamine
  and its subsequent rapid efflux in the presence of leucine represent the rate-limiting
  step of mTOR activation. The protein p70-S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation
  factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) are key downstream targets of mTORC1.
  S6K1 also phosphorylates components of the insulin signaling pathway, which may
  lead to insulin resistance in situations of nutrient abundance such as in obesity.
  The anorexigenic effects of leptin require both the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathways. Because mTOR is a downstream target
  of PI3K signaling, the acute anorexigenic effects of leptin may depend on the PI3K/mTOR/S6K1
  pathway.
