caption: Schematic of D-loops at telomeric ends and in homologous recombination. A,
  the 3′ ssDNA tails generated at a double strand break by nucleases or present at
  a collapsed replication fork are coated by Rad51 filaments. Then Rad51 promotes
  strand invasion and pairing with homologous sequence in duplex DNA. A polymerase
  can initiate DNA synthesis at the 3′-end of the invading strand. D-loops also exist
  at telomeric ends, whereby the 3′ tail invades homologous telomeric duplex DNA.
  Branch migration of the D-loops in the direction of the green arrows mediates D-loop
  disruption for replication fork progression at the telomeres or for completion of
  repair as in the synthesis-dependent strand-annealing pathway. B, schematic of 5′-tailed
  telomeric (Tel) mobile D-loop. The star denotes the 5′-end radiolabel. The invading
  strand base-pairs with the plasmid to form an 84-bp duplex with 10 TTAGGG repeats
  flanked by 12 bp of unique sequence with a protruding 5′ 36-nt single strand tail.
