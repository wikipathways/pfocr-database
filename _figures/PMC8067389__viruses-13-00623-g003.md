caption: 'HCMV dysregulates the Notch signaling pathway. When Notch ligands (Dll1/3/4
  and Jag1/2) bind with Notch receptors, proteolytic cleavage of Notch receptors by
  ADAM and γ-secretase complex releases Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Then NICD
  translocates into nucleus and binds with CSL (CBF1/SuH/Lag-1) to activate transcription
  of target effector genes (Hes and Hey). Hes1 and Hes5 can facilitate STAT3 phosphorylation
  which leads to STAT3 shuttling to nucleus for SOX2 transcription. HCMV tegument
  protein pp71 dysregulates Notch signaling by altering the subcellular localization
  of the ligand Jag1 and NICD1 and promoting their degradation through proteasome.
  In addition, two important genes (Hes1 and SOX2) in development of inner ear are
  regulated by HCMV IE1: IE1 promotes Hes1 degradation and sequesters unphosphorylated
  STAT3 in the nucleus, both of which contribute to decreased SOX2 transcription.'
