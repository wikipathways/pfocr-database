caption: Schematic representation of the hypothesized pathogenesis in anti-MDA5 DM-ILD.
  MDA5 protein can recognizes viral dsRNA then activates IFN-I pathway. Activation
  of the IFN-I system promote the production of MDA5 and cause MDA5 overexpression.
  Abnormal accumulation of MDA5 protein may lead to a loss of immune tolerance, resulting
  in the production of anti-MDA5 autoAb. Anti-MDA5 autoAbs may potential contribute
  to the pathogenesis through binding to MDA5 on cell surface, forming immune complexes,
  and interacting with cytoplasmic MDA5. In the lungs, CX3CL1 can be produced by endothelial
  cells when exposed to IFN-I and induce recruitment of alveolar M2 macrophages. Local
  production of TGF-β by M2 macrophages directly promotes pulmonary fibrosis. CD4+CXCR4+
  T cell subset in anti-MDA5 DM-ILD can produce profibrotic agents (TGF-β, α-SMA,
  collagen I, and IL-21). The process of activated neutrophils releasing NETs could
  expose MDA5 autoantigens. MDA5, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5; DM,
