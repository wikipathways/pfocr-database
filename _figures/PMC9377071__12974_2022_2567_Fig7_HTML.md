caption: Hyperphosphorylated tau contributes to v by inducing necroptosis and inflammation
  mediated by activating the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL and NF-κB pathways. Hyperphosphorylated
  tau promotes necroptosis by activating RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL axis. Meanwhile, necroptosis
  is accompanied by the up regulation of pro-inflammatory factors transcription mediated
  by NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, microglia is activated by pro-inflammatory factors
  and jointly lead to neuronal cells death. Necroptosis and pro-inflammatory factors
  induction could be blocked by inhibition of RIPK1. However, NF-κB inhibitors can
  down regulate the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors, but promote necroptosis
