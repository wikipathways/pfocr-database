caption: Extracellular pH sensing mechanisms mediated by small peptides (SPs) in plants
  This figure illustrates pH‐dependent signaling pathways mediated by SPs that regulate
  root growth and immune responses in plants. In extracellular acidic environments,
  CLE45 interacts with BAM3, inhibiting root growth while promoting protophloem differentiation.
  This interaction is pH‐sensitive, with specific residues, such as an arginine at
  position 4, playing a crucial role in recognition by BAM3. RGF1 peptides, which
  are essential for RAM activity, show high responsiveness to pH changes. Under acidic
  conditions, sulfotyrosine modifications enhance RGF1 binding to RGFR receptors,
  promoting root elongation and cell division in the RAM. In contrast, alkaline conditions
  weaken this binding, reducing RAM activity and shifting plant responses toward defense,
  including immune activation. In alkaline environments, PEP1 undergoes deprotonation,
  increasing its affinity for PEPR and thereby activating immune responses. RALF peptides
  induce extracellular alkalinization, enhance salt tolerance by maintaining cell
  wall integrity, and promote immune responses, such as those induced by RALF22. This
  figure underscores the pivotal role of pH‐sensitive SPs in balancing growth and
  stress responses in plants. MAPKs, mitogen‐activated protein kinases; RGF, root
  growth factor; CLE, CLAVATA3/ESR‐related peptide; PEPR, PEP receptor; RALF, rapid
