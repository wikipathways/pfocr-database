caption: Vesicle mediated flavonoid transport. After anthocyanin biosynthesis (biosynthetic
  site-endoplasmic reticulum), they are transported to the vacuolar membrane and sequestered.
  Anthocyanins are transported by macrophagocytosis or microphagocytosis via ER-derived
  vesicles. On the other site, the transporter-mediated pathway is facilitated by
  vacuole-associated proteins such as ABC, BTL and MATE-like transporters. GSTs function
  as ligandins, via the formation of glutathione conjugated anthocyanins, to accommodate
  the efficient and dynamic transport of anthocyanins from endoplasmic reticulum to
  vacuoles
