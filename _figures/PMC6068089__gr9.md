caption: Schematic depicting neuroprotective roles of BRCA1 towards I/R injury. Excessive
  ROS production damages macromolecule DNA and lipids. BRCA1 binds directly to NRF2
  via its BRCT domain and facilitates NRF2-mediated antioxidant response. Then the
  downstream ARE genes, including HO-1, NQO1, GCLC, GPX4 and SOD2 are induced, which
  reduces ROS production and attenuates lipid peroxidation. Meanwhile, BRCA1 promotes
  DSBs repair through up-regulating Ku70/Ku80 in NHEJ pathway. As a result, neuronal
  cell death is inhibited.
