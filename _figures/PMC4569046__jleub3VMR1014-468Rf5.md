caption: P. gingivalis can manipulate C5aR signaling in neutrophils by means of enzymes
  (HRgpA and RgpB gingipains) that have C5 convertase-like activity and generate high
  local concentrations of the C5a ligand. Therefore, the bacterium can coactivate
  C5aR and TLR2 in neutrophils, and the resulting cross-talk leads to E3 ubiquitin
  ligase Smurf1-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MyD88, thereby
  inhibiting a host-protective antimicrobial pathway. Moreover, the C5aR–TLR2 cross-talk
  activates PI3K, which prevents phagocytosis through inhibition of RhoA and actin
  polymerization, while promoting an inflammatory response. In contrast to MyD88,
  Mal is a component of the subversive pathway, acting upstream of PI3K. The integrated,
  subversive strategy provides "bystander" protection to otherwise susceptible bacterial
  species and promotes dysbiotic inflammation in vivo; from reference [] with permission.
  HRgpA, high molecular mass arginine-specific gingipain A; Pg, P. gingivalis; P.RgpB,
  arginine-specific gingipain B.
