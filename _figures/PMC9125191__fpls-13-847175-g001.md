caption: Phytomelatonin biosynthetic pathway in chloroplasts and mitochondria. (A)
  Schematic of melatonin biosynthetic pathways. (B) Molecular structures of key intermediate
  products in the melatonin biosynthetic pathway. Plants usually synthesize melatonin
  in chloroplasts under normal conditions. If this pathway is blocked, melatonin biosynthesis
  may be switched to the mitochondria. Trp, tryptophan; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine;
  5-HTP, 5-hydroxytryptophan; aHT, N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-MT, 5-methoxytryptamine;
  MT, melatonin; TDC, tryptophan decarboxylase; T5H, tryptamine 5-hydroxylase; SNAT,
  serotonin N-acetyltransferase; ASMT, N-acetylserotonin-O-methyltransferase (plant
  type SNATs and ASMTs appear to have origins distinct from the origins in animals);
  COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; TPH, tryptophan hydroxylase; AADC, aromatic
  amino acid decarboxylase; AANAT, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (also known
  as arylamine N-acetyltransferase); and HIOMT, hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase
  (also known as N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase).
