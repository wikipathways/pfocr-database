caption: Complex IV assembly is driven by the coalescence of three distinct modules
  named after the mtDNA-encoded subunits they contain, COX1, COX2 and COX3. COX1 receives
  heme and copper (Cu) cofactors and joins COX4 and COX5A to form the COX1 module.
  COX2 receives copper and is assembled with COX5B, COX6C, COX7B, COX7C and COX8A
  to form the COX2 module. COX1 and COX2 module are integrated prior to addition of
  the COX3 module, which is composed of COX6A, COX6B and COX7A. NDUFA4 is the last
  subunit to be added to form the mature complex IV. IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane;
  Matrix, mitochondrial matrix.
