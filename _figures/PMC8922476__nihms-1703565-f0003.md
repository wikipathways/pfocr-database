caption: The gut microbiome and gut barrier are drivers of cavernoma formation. Gram-negative
  bacteria (GNB) and GNB-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocate across the mucosal
  and epithelial gut barrier into blood stream. LPS activates Toll-like Receptor 4
  (TLR4) on brain endothelial cells and serves as an inflammatory upstream input into
  the MEKK3-KLF2/4 signaling pathway. PDCD10, unlike KRIT1 and CCM2, is required for
  the secretion of mucus by intestinal goblet cells. Germline loss of one PDCD10 allele
  reduces the gut barrier, thereby increasing translocation of LPS to the blood and
  accelerating the growth of CCM lesions in the brain. Adapted from Tang et al.,
