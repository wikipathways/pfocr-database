caption: Suggested cinnamic acid metabolic pathways in Aspergillus niger. Arrows in
  black are observed metabolic conversions in literature and in gray are suggested
  conversions. Boxed in blue are characterized enzymes of A. niger involved in this
  metabolic pathway. Cinnamic acid decarboxylase (CdcA), Flavin prenyltransferase
  (PadA), sorbic acid decarboxylase regulator (SdrA), benzoate 4-monooxygenase (BphA),
  cytochrome P450 reductase (CprA). *FdcA is renamed to CdcA, see Discussion.
