caption: Chemistry of the retinoid cycle reactions in the vertebrate retina. The retinoid
  cycle reactions were reviewed recently (). In the rod outer segment (ROS), light
  causes the isomerization (reaction a) of rhodopsin chromophore, 11-cis-retinylidene
  (1), to all-trans-retinylidene. All-trans-retinal (2) is hydrolyzed and then reduced
  (reaction b) in the reaction catalyzed by all-trans-retinal-specific RDH(s). All-trans-retinol
  (3) diffuses to RPE where it is esterified by LRAT (reaction c) to retinyl esters
  (4). All-trans-retinyl esters can be hydrolyzed by a yet unidentified retinyl hydrolase
  (reaction f) generating all-trans-retinol. Next, the pathway branches and all-trans-retinol,
  or its derivative, is isomerized to 11-cis-retinol (5) in a reaction that involves
  an abundant RPE protein, termed RPE65 (poorly defined reactions d). 11-cis-retinol
  is then oxidized by 11-cis-RDH (RDH5) and other dehydrogenases () to 11-cis-retinal
  (6) (reaction e) to complete the cycle (modified version from ()). An alternative
  branch involves oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal (reaction g)
  and photoisomerization by RGR of the aldehyde to 11-cis-retinal (reaction h). 11-cis-retinal
  diffuses back to ROS, where it recombines with opsin to reform rhodopsin.
