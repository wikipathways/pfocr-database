caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways of UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-GlcA is synthesized
  from glucose-6-phosphate. Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to glucose-1-phosphate
  and UDP-glucose. Finally, UDP-GlcA is synthesized from UDP-glucose by UDP-glucose
  dehydrogenase (UGDH). UDP-GlcNAc is synthesized via the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway. Glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) utilizes glutamine
  as an amine donor to generate glucosamine-6-phosphate. In the next step, acetyl-CoA
  is transferred to glucosamine-6-phosphate by glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase
  1 (GNPNAT1). The resulting N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate is then converted to
  N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM3). In the final step,
  uridine-5‘-triphosphate (UTP) is transferred to N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate
  by UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (UAP1) to form the end product, UDP-GlcNAc. PPi;
  pyrophosphate.'
