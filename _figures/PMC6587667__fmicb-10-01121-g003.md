caption: 'Crosstalk between mitochondria and peroxisome: the pathogenic Mtb enters
  into the macrophage cells via different PRRs like mannose receptor (MRs) or TLRs.
  After phagocytosis, Mtb modulates cellular oxidative stress mechanisms. Inside the
  mitochondria, NOX2 generates the superoxide radicals during the ETC cycle. These
  superoxide radicals are then metabolized to hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase.
  Anti-oxidant enzyme catalase eventually breaks down the toxic H2O2 into water and
  molecular oxygen. This phenomenan helps to increase the bacillary count inside the
  cells. In peroxisomes, the bacteria metabolize the stored fatty acids and lipids
  for its survival. During the peroxisomal β- fatty acid oxidation, acyl CoA oxidases,
  and other peroxisomal oxidases metabolizes the very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)
  into short chain fatty acids (SCHFA) and acetylCoA. The SCHFA is exported into the
  mitochondria for further metabolism to generate ATP. The acetyl CoA is used as an
  intermediate molecule in the glyoxylate shunt pathway. In addition to generation
  of SCHFA, cellular ROS is formed which is further catalyzed by the array of anti-oxidant
  enzymes in peroxisomes like catalase, glutathione peroxidise (GPX), and so on. This
  phenomenon further provides a favorable niche for the bacilli to survive.'
