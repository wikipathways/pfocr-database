caption: Schematic/proposed signaling model of role and regulation of claudins in
  a cell during invasive or metastatic stage. Deregulated claudin expression and delocalization
  occurs as a consequence of epigenetic factors, growth factors and cytokines, inducing
  loss of “gate and barrier” function and thereby promoting inflammation, EMT and
  disease progression. Once the cell is destined to be a tumor cell, it further becomes
  more aggressive. During this stage, the well-regulated junctional molecules between
  cells become more and more permissible to various factors responsible for the up
  regulation of the survival, rapid growth and proliferative signaling pathways. Also,
  the inhibitor for apoptosis (IAP) proteins, which are critical for inhibiting cancer
  cell death and promoting their survival, are also upregulated. Further, along with
  the PI3-K/Akt and RAS-RAF-ERK pathways, NOTCH pathway is also upregulated which
  further enhances the growth potential of the cancer cell. Further, tight junctional
  protein, such as claudin-1 is associated with beta-catenin and help in the enhanced
  translocation of beta catenin into the nucleus. At this stage both the NOTCH and
  the Wnt pathway act in co-ordination to enhance the metastatic potential of the
  cancer cell.
