caption: B. subtilis synthesizes lipids via the non-mevalonate pathway (blue) . We
  removed this pathway from the B. subtilis genome-scale model and then tried to fill
  the gap using both the likelihood and parsimony-based approaches. The parsimony-based
  gap filling approach instead filled the gap with the mevalonate pathway (red), which
  is shorter but not supported by genetic evidence. The likelihood-based approach
  filled the gap with the correct pathway. Black indicates reactions that were not
  knocked out (there was no explicit link to literature evidence in the B. subtilis
  model). The numeric labels are the computed likelihoods of gap filling reactions.
