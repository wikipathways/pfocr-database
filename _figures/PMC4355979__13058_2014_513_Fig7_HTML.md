caption: Loss of periostin activates an AR response. Through an unknown mechanism,
  the presence of Postn in the microenvironment stimulates or maintains Notch processing
  and NICD activity (1). Loss of periostin (2) results in NICD downregulation and
  AR upregulation by an undefined mechanism (dotted lines). This is accompanied by
  Hey1 downregulation and the activation of AR target genes without any effect on
  development. Activation of the AR pathway or Notch signaling is sufficient to drive
  normal mammary tumor progression. However, in a Postn-deficient environment tumor
  growth at heterotopic sites is impaired (3).
