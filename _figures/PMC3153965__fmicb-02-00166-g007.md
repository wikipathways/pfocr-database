caption: Network representation of altered cellular functions during colonization
  of the mouse colon by A. muciniphila for the gene ontology (GO) category “immune
  response.” The network shows that most of the genes regulating the immune response
  are up-regulated during colonization. Central regulatory genes encode growth factors
  (e.g., Igf1), cell surface molecules (Cd19, Cd37), (receptor) phosphatases (Ptprc
  or Cd45), and protein kinases (Lck, Fyn) that regulate (immune) cell proliferation
  and differentiation. The protein interaction network was derived from the transcription
  data using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Nodes indicate proteins, the yellow
  lines connecting them represent interactions (e.g., protein–protein binding or phosphorylation
  events) that are mapped by Ingenuity’s knowledge base (see ). Colors indicate altered
  transcription of the encoding genes, with deeper shades of red indicating stronger
  up-regulation, and deeper shades of green indicating stronger down-regulation. The
  genes and their encoded proteins that are used to reconstruct specific networks
  were selected based on overrepresentation of GO categories (“cellular functions”
  in IPA) and involvement in significantly (see ) modulated canonical pathways. The
  overlays with blue radiating lines represent some of these canonical pathways (CP)
  and are useful to indicate in which cellular pathways differentially regulated genes
  and their interacting products participate for the given GO categories. Note that
  in this network exemplifying the genetic regulation of the mouse colonic immune
  response to A. muciniphila, most of the genes are up-regulated, indicating that
  the immune response was induced following colonization of these bacteria.
