caption: Iron–sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis in eukaryotes. Fe–S cluster biogenesis
  is a complex pathway involving many enzymes and proteins. (a) In the mitochondria
  and cytosol of mammalian cells, cysteine desulfurases (m-ISCS and c-ISCS) remove
  sulfur from free cysteine and donate the sulfur to scaffold proteins (e.g. m-ISCU
  and c-ISCU), whereas frataxin (FXN) is proposed to be an iron chaperone that delivers
  iron in an accessible form. Scaffold proteins can assemble and donate either [2Fe–2S]
  (not shown) or [4Fe–4S] clusters to recipient proteins. In the mitochondria, redox
  proteins such as FDX and FDXR likely deliver reducing equivalents needed for cluster
  assembly, and protein chaperones HSPA9/HSCB and glutaredoxin GRX5 facilitate the
  transfer of the cluster from scaffolds to recipient proteins. In the cytosol, additional
  factors including NUBP1, NUBP2, NARF and CIAO1 might facilitate cluster transfer.
  ISCS and ISCU are shown in ribbon structures. Other mitochondrial cluster biogenesis
  factors are shown in light blue ovals and cytoplasmic factors in dark blue ovals.
  (b) In yeast mitochondria, cysteine desulfurase Nfs1p, Isd11p, frataxin homolog
  Yfh1p and redox proteins Yah1p and Arh1p facilitate cluster assembly in scaffold
  proteins, whereas chaperone proteins Ssq1p and Jac1p and glutaredoxin Grx5p facilitate
  cluster transfer from scaffold to recipient proteins. The scaffold proteins Isu1p,
  Isu2p and Yfh1p have thus far only been detected in the mitochondria matrix, leading
  to the proposal that cluster assembly occurs exclusively in the mitochondria matrix,
  and preformed clusters are exported through Atm1p and transferred to cytosolic recipients
  through Cfd1p, Nar1p, Cia1p and Nbp35p. Nfs1p and Isu1p are shown in ribbon structures.
  Other mitochondrial cluster biogenesis factors are shown in light blue ovals and
  cytoplasmic factors in dark blue ovals.
