caption: Schematic molecular structure of HGF and its receptor, c-Met. HGF (A) and
  c-Met (B) are initially expressed as precursor proteins and are then cleaved to
  mature heterodimers composed of an alpha- chain subunit and a beta-chain subunit
  linked by a disulfide bond. Mature HGF is a heterodimer composed of an alpha chain,
  which contains an N-terminal hairpin domain and four kringle domains, and a beta
  chain consisting of a serine-protease-like domain without enzymatic activity. Mature
  c-Met is composed of a glycosylated alpha subunit and a transmembrane beta subunit.
  The extracellular region of mature c-Met contains a Sema domain, a cysteine-rich
  Met-related sequence (MRS) domain, and four immunoglobulin-like structure domain.
  The intracellular region is composed of a juxtamembrane domain, a tyrosine kinase
  domain, and a C-terminal regulatory tail.
