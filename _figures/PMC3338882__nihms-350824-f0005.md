caption: '(A) Western blot showing pan-histone 3 acetylation (H3ac) levels in HCT116
  cells grown in DMEM formulated without glucose (−Glu, left lane) or formulated with
  25mM glucose (+Glu, right lane). β actin serves as the loading control. (B) A model
  of how glucose increases histone acetylation. First, it contributes carbons that
  can be incorporated into acetyl-CoA via the following pathway (denoted by thick
  arrows): glycolysis, PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase), the TCA cycle and citrate shuttle,
  and ACL. Second, increased TCA-cycle activity increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio to inhibit
  SIRT1, which inhibits histone acetylation. Enzymes and metabolites that are most
  relevant are highlighted in blue and yellow, respectively.'
