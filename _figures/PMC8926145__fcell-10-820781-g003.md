caption: The role of OTUB2 in the NF-kappaB pathway. (A). In cancer tissue, OTUB2
  could not only remove the K48 polyubiquitin chain bound to TRAF6 but also increase
  the level of phosphorylated p65 (The intermediate pathway may be OTUB2-mediated
  K48 deubiquitination of phosphokinase targeting p65, not shown in the figure). As
  an E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRAF6 could ubiquitinate the key molecules TAB2 and NEMO
  in the NF-kappaB pathway. The K63 polyubiquitination chain of TAB2 interacted with
  the regulatory subunit of TAK1 to initiate the catalytic activity of TAK1. TAK1
  made the phosphorylation activation of the IKK complex inevitable. The IKK complex
  dissociated the downstream molecule inhibitor of kappaB alpha (IkappaBα) from NF-kappaB
  (p-p65 + p50). The next fate of IkappaBα in isolation was added with the K48 polyubiquitin
  chain followed by proteasome degradation. Then the NF-kappaB escaped the restriction
  of the IkappaBα, entered the nucleus to induce the expression of related anti-apoptotic
  genes, and promoted the progression of cancer. (B). In pancreatic tissue, OTUB2
  cleaved the K63 polyubiquitin chain of NEMO guided by TRAF6, and the K63 polyubiquitin
  chain of NEMO was a sufficient condition for the activation of the IKK complex.
  Therefore, the NF-kappaB pathway was blocked in the IKK complex. Different from
  cancer tissue, physiologically, the expression of target genes induced by NF-kappaB
  tended to cause the apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells, so OTUB2 protected the only
  pancreatic β-cells that secreted hypoglycemic hormones in the human body.
