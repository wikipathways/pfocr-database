caption: Pathway analysis shows apolipoprotein E along with its respective interactions
  in Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia pathway. Apolipoprotein E is shown in white
  node, its interacting nodes in Parkinson’s disease pathway are highlighted in green,
  interacting nodes in schizophrenia pathway are highlighted in pink, and nodes that
  are common to both the pathways are in blue colour. First node interactions are
  shown circled by bold lines; and interactions from there on are shown circled by
  normal lines. Interactions that are connecting the nodes are shown by grey lines.
