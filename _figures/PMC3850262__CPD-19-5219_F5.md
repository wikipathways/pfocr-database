caption: The insulin signalling pathway in hepatocytes. Insulin (I) binding to the
  extracellular subunits of insulin receptor (InsR) leads to activation of tyrosine
  kinase in the intracellular domain, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding and finally
  receptor autophosphorylation. ENPP1 is a membrane glycoprotein that interact with
  InsR inhibiting its kinase activity. InsR autophosphorylation is followed by phosphorylation
  of the insulin-receptor substrates (IRS), activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3-kinase) and subsequent phosphorylation of Akt/PKB (protein kinase B), which
  are involved in mediating the metabolic effect of insulin. FOXO1 is a transcription
  factor that in the absence of insulin induces gluconeogenesis, lipoprotein export,
  and apoptosis. Insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation of FOXO1 leads to its nuclear
  exclusion, ubiquitination, and subsequent proteasomal degradation.
