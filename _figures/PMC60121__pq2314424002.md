caption: Construction of pALH251 for complementation of inactivated rpoN with constitutively
  expressed rpoS. (a) A 965-bp fragment was excised from pJRS525 and a 1,158-bp fragment
  containing a PflaB-kan promoter fusion was inserted into the AlwNI and FspI sites,
  yielding pALH227. (b) pALH251 was obtained on ligating a PflgB-rpoS fusion construct
  (1,224 bp) into the BamHI and NcoI sites of the multiple cloning site of pALH227.

  regulatory pathway.
