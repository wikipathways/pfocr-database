caption: Shows that, owing to aging, there is an increased release of proinflammatory
  adipokines that stimulate the activation of TNF, TGFBR, and insulin receptors. These
  factors in turn activate the PPAR and C/EBP transcription factors, leading to abnormal
  adipogenesis and oxidative stress. However, the negative (_) sign in green indicates
  that polyphenols inhibit these pathways and instead activate AMPK and the Wnt signaling
  pathway, as shown by the plus (+) sign. This protective action helps mitigate the
  effects of aging on regulated pathways
