caption: 'PIGR signaling pathway in cancer. Mechanistically, PIGR binds to dimerized
  IgA and IgM on the basolateral surface of gut epithelial cells, followed by the
  endocytosis of IgA into vesicles. PIGR then transports IgA, becoming part of the
  secreted IgA molecule, which is further transported from the lamina propria across
  the epithelial barrier to the mucosal lumen. This process enables PIGR to serve
  as a link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. The expression of PIGR
  is regulated by immune system mediators such as interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and tumor
  necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). Various immune signaling cascades, including Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) activation and inflammatory cytokine signaling, also directly influence
  the upregulation of the PIGR gene. NF-κB activation subsequently enhances the transcytosis
  of PIGR: PIg. PIGR-IgA transcytosis induces transcriptional changes that promote
  inflammatory pathways in cancer cells, including the upregulation of interferon-gamma
  receptors, the downregulation of tumor-promoting ephrins, and antagonism of the
  RAS pathway. This sensitizes tumor cells to cytolytic killing by T cells. Consequently,
  tumor-dependent antibodies facilitate the destruction of cancer cells through antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP)
  mechanisms. PIGR: Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor'
