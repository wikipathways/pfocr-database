caption: A few autophagies that happen in healthy cardiomyocytes can help in removing
  the damaged organelles and maintain the physiological function of cells. Additionally,
  resveratrol can enhance autophagy during the aging process, but it can also provide
  an additional enhancement effect on IGF1R cardiac survival pathway in hearts. The
  autophagy induced by ETS exposure is entirely alien to resveratrol. The ETS exposure
  will increase the IGF2R more than the IGF1R signaling pathway, and further reduce
  the expression and activities of SIRT-. This proved that the ETS did not seem to
  affect the appearance; in fact, it could have accelerated the aging process and
  harmed the heart.
