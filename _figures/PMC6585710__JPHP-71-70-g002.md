caption: 'The molecular mechanism of elicitation: Recognition of elicitors by plasma
  membrane‐bound receptors results in ion fluxes, Ca2+ burst, cytoplasmic acidification,
  ROS burst, NADPH oxidase activation, G‐protein activation and mitogen‐activated
  protein kinase phosphorylation. It also activates downstream signalling pathway
  messengers like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and methyl jasmonate. Messengers activate
  transcription factors and gene expression, which lead to reprogramming secondary
  metabolism. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]'
