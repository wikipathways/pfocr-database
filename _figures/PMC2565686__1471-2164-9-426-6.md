caption: Merger of the interaction maps for the three human proteins ING1, MEKK, and
  p38a (p38MAPK) based on empirical data retrieved from the STRING database. Lines
  connecting p38a and its interactors have been excluded for clarity, except where
  the interactor is directly shared with MEKK4 as part of a well-defined stress response
  pathway. MEKK4 and ING1 have relative few confirmed interactions, but the interactions
  predicted and confirmed in our study (shown as thick lines) are the first to directly
  tie ING1 to multiple key proteins in this stress response. Examining such interaction
  overlap graphs can help, in deciding which interaction predictions to validate biochemically,
  based on biological tenability and salience.
