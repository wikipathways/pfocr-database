caption: A schematic representation of the role of several ncRNAs in regulating the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in OSCC, TSCC and Cutaneous SCC. Accumulating evidence
  has revealed that various ncRNAs (lncRNAs, circRNAs, and miRNAs) could be negatively
  involved in triggering different kinds of SCCs via activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  cascade. As an illustration, previous study has authenticated that up-regulation
  of lncRNA MALAT1 could promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of tongue
  cancer cells via increasing the expression levels of AKT and MMP-9 []. Another finding
  confirms that overexpression of miR-21-5p could inhibit apoptosis via down-regulating
  the expression levels of PDCD4 as well as pro-apoptotic protein Bax and up-regulating
  FOXO1 and Bcl2 through directly activating the PI3K/AKT pathway in tongue squamous
  cell carcinoma []. Furthermore, mounting research has demonstrated that miRNA‑451a
  via directly targeting PDPK1 could suppress cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma development
  by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway []. Green lines indicate the positive
  regulatory effect among ncRNAs and their targets, and red lines depict negative
  one among them. All the information regarding the role of these ncRNAs involved
  in the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in several kinds of squamous
  cell carcinomas can be seen in Tables ,
