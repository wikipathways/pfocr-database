caption: '(a) Insulin signal transduction system in individuals with normal glucose
  tolerance (see text for a detailed discussion). NOS, nitric oxide synthase. (b)
  In individuals with T2DM, insulin signaling is impaired at the level of IRS-1, leading
  to decreased glucose transport/phosphorylation/metabolism and impaired nitric oxide
  synthase activation/endothelial dysfunction. At the same time, insulin signaling
  through the MAPK pathway remains normally sensitive to insulin. The compensatory
  hyperinsulinemia (due to insulin resistance in the IRS-1/PI3K pathway) results in
  excessive stimulation of the MAPK pathway, which is involved in inflammation, vascular
  smooth muscle cell proliferation, and atherogenesis (see text for a more detailed
  discussion). SHC, Src homology collagen. [DeFronzo RA: From the triumvirate to the
