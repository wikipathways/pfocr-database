caption: PD-1 signal inhibits T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway through several
  different mechanisms. (a) PD-1 engagement with PD-L1 or PD-L2 ligands blocks TCR
  signal transmission by promoting microcluster formation and degradation of TCR.
  Accumulation of PD-1 within the synapse stabilizes the interaction between T cells
  and antigen presenting cells causing “immune paralysis” and cell motility arrest.
  PD-1 ligation also enhances TCR internalization and degradation by Casitas B-lymphoma
  (CBL)-B E3 ubiquitin ligase. (b) PD-1 signaling recruits SHP2 phosphatase to immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch
  motif (ITSM). SHP2 dephosphorylates ZAP70, ERK1/2 and suppresses the phosphatidylinositide
  3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/Mammalian Target of Rapamyc from (mTOR) pathways, thus inhibiting
  multiple T-cell activation pathways. (c) PD-1 suppresses T-cell proliferation by
  blocking the transcription of Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein ubiquitin ligase (SKP2),
  which controls cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) activation. A Basic leucine transcription
  factor, ATF-like (BATF) is also a downstream target of PD-1 signaling that causes
  repression of T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Besides, by inhibiting
  TCR signaling, PD-1 blocks IL-2 production to limit T-cell proliferation. (d) PD-1
  signaling promotes FOXO1 retention in nucleus and enables Pdcd1 gene transactivation.
  Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1) in the absence of AP-1 interaction
  promotes the expression of Pdcd1 (PD-1 encoding gene). The transcription of Pdcd1
  is inhibited by AKT/mTOR signaling, which promotes phosphorylation of FOXO1 and
  14-3-3 docking to sequester FOXO1 molecule from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.
  PD-1 signaling stops the process by targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway.
