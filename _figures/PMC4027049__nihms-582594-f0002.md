caption: 'a | Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) family ligands signal by assembling
  a hetero-tetrameric receptor complex with two type I (which are the main signal
  propagators) receptor components (shown in light grey) and two type II (which are
  activators) components (shown in dark grey). Signalling is mediated via a cytoplasmic
  Ser/Thr kinase domain. Signalling modality 1 is the canonical SMAD pathway, and
  modality 2 its companion. Signalling modalities 3–5 are considered as non-canonical
  TGFβ signalling pathways. Receptor-phosphorylated SMAD proteins (R-SMAD proteins)
  form transcriptional complexes that pair with other context-dependent transcription
  factors to regulate hundreds of genes (1) (for details, see ,). Activated R-SMAD
  proteins can also form a complex with TRIM33 (tripartite motif containing 33) that
  recognizes certain histone marks and disables their repressive action, which results
  in chromatin opening and thereby allows access for canonical SMAD complexes (2)
  (for details, see ). R-SMAD proteins can participate in microRNA (miRNA) processing
  by Drosha complexes for the biogenesis of a subset of SMAD-binding miRNA precursors
  (3). TGFβ and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type II receptors signal by directly
  activating partitioning defective 6 (PAR6) and LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1), respectively
  (4). TGFβ and BMP receptors can activate various mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPKs) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (5). b | Seven classes of
  determinants regulate the access of ligand to TGFβ receptors. These include: the
  level of expression of a ligand in source cells, the type of ligand isoforms that
  is available, factors that can sequester the ligands (termed traps) or release them
  (termed releasers), decoy ligands that occupy the receptors or co-receptors without
  triggering signalling and the type of receptor and co-receptor that is expressed
  in target cells. c | Direct signalling by type II receptor kinases. TGFβ receptor
  type II (TGFBR2) phosphorylates the tight junction regulator PAR6 to recruit the
  E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF1 and target RHOA for degradation. This leads to dissolution
  of tight junctions in epithelial cells. BMP receptor type II (BMPR2) contains a
  long carboxy-terminal tail that binds and activates LIMK1, thereby inhibiting the
  actin-disassembling protein cofilin. This results in stabilization of actin filaments.
  d | TRAF6 (tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6) acts together with
  SMAD7 and both are known binding partners for TGFβ receptors. The interaction between
  TRAF6 and SMAD7 is implicated in the activation of TAK1 (TGFβ-activated kinase 1),
  which is a protein kinase upstream of the signal transduction kinases p38, JNK (Jun
  amino-terminal kinase) and IKK (inhibitor of κB kinase). TGFβ and BMP receptors
  can activate several other signal transducers (such as mTORC (mammalian target of
  rapamycin), PI3K, SHC (SH2 domain-containing transforming protein), ERK (extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase) and RHO), although the biochemical and structural bases
  for many of these links remain unknown.'
