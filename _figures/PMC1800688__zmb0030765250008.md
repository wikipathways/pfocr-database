caption: (A) Proposed model of Kar4 action in the pheromone response. During the pheromone
  response, cytoplasmic Fus3 (Fus3-C) enters the nucleus (Fus3-N), where it phosphorylates
  Far1 and Dig1 and Dig2, leading to cell cycle arrest, and the activation of Ste12,
  which in turn induces the early pheromone response genes. Ste12 also induces the
  expression of the pheromone-specific short form of Kar4, which begins to accumulate
  in the cell. After sufficient Kar4 has accumulated, it facilitates Ste12 binding
  to the promoter regions of genes involved in functions required late in the pheromone
  response. (B) Representation of the feed-forward loop. The diagram was modified
  from that of Mangan and Alon (). Coherent type I feed forward loop (AND gate logic)
  in which transcription factor X is represented by Ste12 and transcription factor
  Y is represented by Kar4 and the target gene, Z, is represented by KAR3. The inducer
  of X and Y is pheromone, although other inducers of Kar4 are possible. This type
  of feed-forward loop is suggested to act as a persistence detector where only persistent
  stimulus of both X and Y will lead to activation of Z (). (C) Incoherent type I
  feed-forward loop (AND gate logic) in which X is represented by Ste12, Y is represented
  by Kar4, and Z is represented by CIS3. This type of feed-forward loop is characterized
  by the combined induction of X and Y by a stimulus (pheromone) in order to cause
  Z to be repressed by Y.
