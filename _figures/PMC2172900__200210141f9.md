caption: A model of how the Tor1/2 and Lst8 proteins affect amino acid biosynthesis
  and Gap1p sorting. Tor1/2p and Lst8p negatively regulate the activity of the Rtg1p
  and Rtg3p transcription factors, decreasing the expression of enzymes responsible
  for α-ketoglutarate synthesis and limiting the synthesis of α-ketoglutarate, glutamate,
  glutamine, and the other amino acids. Tor1/2p and Lst8p lso negatively regulate
  the activity of the Gln3p transcription factor, decreasing the expression of GDH1
  and GLN1, further limiting amino acid biosynthesis (; ). Thus, mutation of lst8
  or other impairment of Tor1/2p activity (such as treatment with a sublethal concentration
  of rapamycin) causes increased amino acid levels, which act as a signal for sorting
  Gap1p to the vacuole.
