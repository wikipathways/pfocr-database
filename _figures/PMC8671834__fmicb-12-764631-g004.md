caption: 'Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle and related pathways in Ca. A. pyornia. Candidatus
  A. pyornia has an incomplete TCA cycle and is missing genes that code for two enzymes:
  citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase (red arrows o and g). Oxaloacetate can
  still be produced from L-aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate, and oxaloacetate can be decarboxylated
  to pyruvate. Acetate can be produced through multiple pathways, including the phosphate
  acetyltransferase-acetate kinase pathway. The enzymes labeled a – s are as follows:
  a: pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase, b: pyruvate kinase, c: pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  d: acetyl-CoA synthase, e: putative phosphotransacetylase, f: acetate kinase, g:
  citrate synthase, h and i: aconitase, j: isocitrate dehydrogenase, k: α-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase, l: succinyl-CoA synthetase, m: succinate dehydrogenase, n: fumarase,
  o: malate dehydrogenase, p: aspartate aminotransferase, q: oxaloacetate decarboxylase,
