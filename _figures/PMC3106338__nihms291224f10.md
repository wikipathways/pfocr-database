caption: 'The effects of IFNα involve at least two primary processes: (1) The first
  pathway involves the induction and release of cytokines/chemokines that mediate
  the recruitment of immune cells that induce autoimmune cell death. This, “bystander
  mechanism” can lead to the activation of resident T-cells within the thyroid intiating
  an autoimmune response. The induction of Granzyme B in the thyroids from TG mice
  strongly suggested the activation of this well-described pathway of immune mediated
  cell death, which can trigger thyroiditis. This process could be augmented in genetically
  susceptible individuals. Indeed, backcrossing the TG animals to the CBA/J thyroiditis-susceptible
  strain worsened the phenotype suggesting genetic augmentation of this mechanism.
  (2) The second pathway involves a direct toxic action of IFNα on thyroid cells.
  The observation of thyroid cell death in vitro and in vivo in the high expressing
  lines strongly suggested direct thyroid toxicity independent of the recruitment
  of the peripheral immune system. The thyroid specific effects we observed, upregulation
  of thyroid antigens, antigen presentation pathways, and innate immune response pathways,
  coupled with induction of thyroid cell-death by IFNα could lead to a T-cell response
  to the thyroid and development of thyroid autoimmunity.'
