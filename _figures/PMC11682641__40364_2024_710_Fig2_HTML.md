caption: BCR signalling and associated pathways network, genetic resistance mechanisms
  and pathway adaptive resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies in CLL. BCR signalling
  activation is initiated when an antigen binds to the receptor, leading to CD79 phosphorylation
  through LYN and SYK tyrosine kinases. This event forms a signalosome that includes
  B-cell linker protein (BLNK), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and phosphoinositide
  3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ). These proteins transduce signals to the calcium-signalling
  modulator phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2). PLCγ2 catalyses the degradation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which facilitates
  the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This increase in intracellular
  calcium promotes the activation of protein kinase C beta (PKCβ), which in turn activates
  the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-κB) pathway
  and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling. The ROR1 pathway, activated
  by Wnt5a binding, is associated with the BCR pathway and contributes to CLL cell
  survival and proliferation. The diagram shows the phosphorylation of ROR1 by kinases,
  such as SRC and MET, leading to downstream activation of PI3K and AKT, which are
  involved in cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. The TLR signalling pathway
  involves TLRs recognising PAMPs, leading to recruitment of MyD88 or TRIF adaptor
  proteins. MyD88 recruits IRAK1/4, forming the Myddosome complex, whereas TRIF interacts
  with TRAF3 to promote type I interferon production. Both pathways converge on NF-κB
  activation, which enhances cell survival and inflammatory responses. The figure
  also indicates the genetic mechanisms of resistance, such as mutations in BTK and
  PLCγ2, which confer resistance to BCR signalling inhibitors. Adaptation mechanisms
  have been shown, including alterations in the PI3K pathway and ROR1, which lead
  to resistance to BCR inhibitors. These mechanisms underscore the dynamic nature
  of CLL cells in adapting to therapeutic pressure. This visual summary underscores
  the complexity of signalling pathways in CLL, molecular targets for therapy, and
  challenges posed by resistance mechanisms. Figure created in BioRender inspiration
