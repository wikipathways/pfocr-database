caption: Different concentrations of key effectors of the Hippo and Akt pathways.
  In the quiescent state, the Akt (protein kinase B) pathway can keep forkhead box
  O3 (FOXO3) unphosphorylated preventing follicular activation. In the Hippo pathway,
  yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif
  (TAZ) are phosphorylated keeping them from relocating to the nucleus thereby preventing
  activation. In contrast, in an activated follicle, there will be a higher concentration
  of phosphorylated FOXO3 causing it to leave the nucleus and enabling follicular
  activation. In addition, more YAP/TAZ will be in an unphosphorylated state. When
  the follicle senses mechanical disruption, globular actin (G-actin) is polymerized
  to filamentous actin (F-actin) which is also associated with follicular activation
