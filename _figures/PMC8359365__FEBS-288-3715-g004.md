caption: 'Central carbon metabolism and viral infection. (a) Central carbon metabolism
  (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle) converts sugars to the building
  blocks of DNA and RNA, proteins and lipids. Additionally, it generates energy in
  the form of ATP and redox cofactors NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH. Abbreviations: LDs,
  lipid droplets; G6P, glucose 6‐phosphate; F6P, fructose 6‐phosphate; FBP, fructose
  1,6‐biphosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate;
  1,3‐BPG, 1,3‐biphosphoglycerate; 3PG, 3‐phosphoglycerate; 2PG, 2‐phosphoglycerate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; 2‐OG, 2‐oxoglutarate. (b) A systems engineering analogy
  describing function of the protein products of ISGs as (1) direct effectors of viral
  replication and (2) in the remodelling of central carbon metabolism to support broad‐spectrum
  immune response. The cell is like a factory and central carbon metabolism is the
  process 1. If an infectious agent enters the factory, the first response of the
  control room would be to use some of the available products and energy (process
  2) to either directly inhibit viral replication (path 1) or to inhibit the production
  process (path 2). The outcomes of path 2 will be (i) reduction in formation of products
  and energy to limit access of pathogen to these resources and (ii) support of process
  3, which restricts replication of the infectious agent.'
