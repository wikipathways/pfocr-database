caption: 'Regulation of major EMT transcription factors by signalling pathways. Epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) is driven by SNAIL, zinc-finger E-box-binding (ZEB), and basic
  helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that act as downstream effectors from
  several other signalling molecules. 1, Wnt signalling: WNT inhibits glycogen synthase
  kinase-3β (GSK3β) to stabilize β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus to recruit
  the transcription factors; lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF) and T-cell factor
  (TCF) and promotes expression of SNAIL1 and SNAIL2. 2, Notch signalling: binding
  of a ligand (such as delta-like or jagged) with Notch receptors initiates the Notch
  signalling through the proteolytic cleavage by γ-secretase complex to release NICD.
  NICD then undergoes nuclear translocation to regulate the expression of target genes,
  including SNAIL, ZEB, and bHLH families. 3, Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)
  promotes EMT by acting at various strata; SMAD-mediated and non-SMAD signalling
  (i) SMAD-mediated signalling: Activation of the TβRI and TβRII turns on SMAD2 and
  SMAD3, which then integrate with SMAD4 to form a trimeric SMAD complex. This complex
  translocates into the nucleus to stimulate the expression of EMT transcription factors
  (ii) non-SMAD-mediated signalling: TGFβ also activates ERK through the RAS-MAKP
  pathway. Activated ERK can then stimulate the expression of SNAIL1 and SNAIL2 (unspecified
  in the image). 4–6, Growth factors (EGF, FGF, and HGF): various growth factors such
  as EGF, FGF, and PDGF activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), triggering dimerization
  and autophosphorylation of the intracellular domain of these receptors, which allows
  them to activate other downstream signalling molecules, including PI3K, PAK1, and
  STAT 3 and increase expression of SNAIL1 and SNAIL2. 7, Oestrogen; oestrogen is
  one of the few molecular candidates that negatively regulate EMT. It does this through
  direct inhibition of Slug transcription by forming a co-repressor complex consisting
  of ligand-activated ERα, HDAC1, and nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) that binds
  to the oestrogen-response elements at the slug promoter sequence and inhibit its
  expression. 8, Hypoxia: in normoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylases are activated
