caption: Pathways for utilization of L-Arg and potential biological effects relevant
  to colonic homeostasis. Solid lines represent known biochemical processes, and dotted
  lines indicate potential effects. L-Arg is imported into cells by the transport
  proteins CAT1 and CAT2. This process is competitively inhibited by L-Orn and L-Lys.
  Once inside cells, L-Arg can be utilized by two competing pathways. 1. The arginase
  pathway generates L-Orn, which is the substrate for ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)
  that produces the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Polyamines have
  been shown to play a role in wound repair and are potential regulators of immune
  response, apoptosis and phagocytosis. 2. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
  pathway produces high levels of nitric oxide, which can have a wide variety of effects
  in the innate immune response. L-Arg may also have important roles in modulating
  the additional cellular functions indicated.
