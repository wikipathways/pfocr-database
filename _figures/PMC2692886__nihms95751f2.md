caption: Serial digestion of amyloid precursor protein (APP) releases aggregation-prone
  amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, which spontaneously form small toxic oligomers. Heat-shock
  factor 1 (HSF-1)-regulated disaggregation machinery disrupts the Aβ aggregates and
  prepares them for degradation. When the disaggregation pathway is overtaxed, a DAF-16-regulated
  active aggregation activity creates high-molecular-mass aggregates of lower toxicity
  that might subsequently be secreted from the cell. If they are not secreted, the
  high-molecular-mass aggregates undergo slow disaggregation and subsequent degradation.
  The insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling (IIS) pathway compromises the
  activity of both protective mechanisms in an age-dependent manner by negatively
  regulating HSF-1 and DAF-16.
