caption: Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Inflammation in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
  Mitochondrial-Driven Inflammation and NF-κB Signaling Pathways Mediating NLRP3 Inflammasome
  Activation in TBI. (A) Post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) inflammatory responses
  begin with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, facilitating the infiltration of
  immune cells into the brain. Damaged neurons release damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs), which are detected by microglia and astrocytes, triggering an
  inflammatory cascade. Microglia adopt a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, releasing
  cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α),
  which stimulate astrocytes to produce additional cytokines and chemokines, further
  intensifying inflammation. Mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs)
  exacerbate the response, activating microglia to produce reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) and engage in chronic maladaptive activation, causing neuronal damage. Reactive
  astrocytes lose their neuroprotective functions, including glutamate buffering and
  neuronal energy support, and instead release inflammatory mediators such as IL-1α,
  CXCL10, and complement protein C3. The crosstalk between reactive microglia and
  astrocytes amplifies inflammation, impairs synaptic repair, and worsens neuronal
  injury, driving neurotoxicity progression in TBI. (B) DAMPs and cytokines activate
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytokine receptors, leading to the activation of
  the NF-κB signaling pathway. NF-κB translocates into the nucleus to promote the
  transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and components of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into
  active caspase-1, which processes pro-IL-1β into its mature form. These inflammatory
  cytokines, alongside mitochondrial ROS, sustain neuroinflammation and exacerbate
  neuronal damage. Additionally, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP)
  releases cytochrome c into the cytosol, linking mitochondrial dysfunction to apoptosis
  via caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. Caspase-3 also contributes to pyroptotic
  cell death through gasdermin D (GSDMD), releasing further DAMPs and perpetuating
  the inflammatory response (See text for abbreviations). This figure is created with
