caption: Generation of cGMP is shown from both a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) –soluble
  guanylate cyclase (sGC) pathway, and natriuretic peptide receptor-receptor GC pathway.
  These are two very different pools, and appear to regulate different aspects of
  cardiac myocyte function and stress adapatation. Their stimulated PKG is also likely
  compartmentalized though this remains to be clarified and is depicted here for simplicity
  as a common pool. Once generated, cGMP can stimulate its effecter kinase PKG, and
  also regulates and is regulated by phosphodiesterases. Four PDEs (PDE1a, c; PDE2,
  PDE3a, and PDE5a) have been identified as contributing to hydrolytic regulation
  and/or signaling in myocytes. PDE1 is calcium-calmodulin (CaM) dependent and is
  a dual esterase, PDE2 is a cGMP-stimulated cAMP esterase, while PDE3A is principally
  a cAMP esterase that can be competitively inhibited by cGMP. PDE5a is the only selective
  cGMP esterase of this group. It has several post-translational activation mechanisms;
  cGMP binding to N-terminus GAF domains, and PKG phosphorylation at serine 92.On
  the right of the figure are the targets of PKG. PKG can activate PDE5a – to lower
  cGMP, but may also target the rGC/NPR complex to stimulate cGMP generation, PKG
  also phosphorylates phospholamban (PLB) to enhance calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum (SR), and mitochondrial proteins to regulate KATP channel opening and
  provide cardioprotection. Recent studies have also shown revealed it phosphoryates
  and binds to regulator of G-coupled protein signaling RGS2 and RGS4, both acting
  to suppress Gαq-coupled signaling cascades (e.g. Ras, MAP kinase, CamKII, and associated
  transcription factors, NFAT, MEF2 and GATA-4) Studies have also shown PKG directly
  phosphorylates and suppresses transient receptor potential channel 6, reducing the
  trigger calcium that has been linked to calcineurin (Cn) activation and subsequent
  dephosphorylation of NFAT, leading to the latter’s nuclear translocation.
