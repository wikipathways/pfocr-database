caption: Schematic representation that GL-V9 inhibits prostate cancer by intervening
  in the interactive signaling networks of AR-AKT-HKIIThe synthesized flavonoid GL-V9
  is potent anti-PCa candidate and suppresses the growth in both AR-negative and AR-expressing
  PCa. In AR-negative PCa cells, GL-V9 downregulates the protein level and mitochondrial
  location of HKII by inactivating AKT induced-phosphorylation of HK-II, leading to
  cell growth inhibition and mitochondrial pathway mediated apoptosis. Whereas in
  AR-expressing PCa cells, AKT-regulated glycolytic pathway and the mitochondrial
  localization of HKII can potentially be feedback activated by the AR inhibitor.
  In addition to regulate HKII-regulated glucose catabolism and apoptosis, GL-V9 inhibits
  the expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of AR protein. This demonstrates
  a synergistic effect in anti-PCa effects with AR inhibitors, such as bicalutamide
