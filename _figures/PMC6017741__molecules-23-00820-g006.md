caption: A schematic representation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway leading
  to anthocyanins. The expression pattern of each structural gene involved in anthocyanin
  synthesis in BL, WL, and RL is arranged from left to right. WL, RL, and BL indicates
  samples treated by white light, red light, and blue light, respectively. The color
  scale represents re-processed log10 (FPKM+1) using Pheatmap, representing the relative
  expression level. The expression variance for each gene is indicated by colors ranging
  from low (blue) to high (red).
