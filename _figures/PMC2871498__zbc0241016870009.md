caption: Working model for S1P/SK/S1PR interplay during acrosomal exocytosis. The
  interaction between S1P with a Gi-coupled receptor (S1PR) activates a VOCC and a
  heterotrimeric Gi-protein leading to PLC activation. PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate to generate DAG and IP3. IP3 binds to IP3-sensitive calcium channels
  on the acrosomal membrane leading to intra-acrosomal calcium efflux. The emptying
  of the acrosomal store stimulates the opening of SOCCs at the plasma membrane. The
  other product of PLC activity, DAG, activates the serine/threonine kinase PKC. PKC
  may act directly or indirectly through ERK phosphorylating SK1 on residue Ser225
  and favoring its interaction with the plasma membrane. Once the enzyme resides on
  the membrane, it catalyzes sphingosine (SPH) phosphorylation. S1P produced reaches
  the extracellular medium through an ABCC1 transporter and/or a Spns2 transporter
  interacting with its receptor and amplifying the signaling pathway. The sustained
  calcium increase induced by SOCCs opening activates Rab3A leading to acrosomal exocytosis.
