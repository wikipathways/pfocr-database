caption: Generalized view on functioning of the malate/oxaloacetate shuttle in the
  mesophyll. The depicted metabolic scenario was elaborated based on the Flux Balance
  Analysis. PS – photosynthesis system; PPP – pentose-phosphate pathway; CBC – Calvin-Benson
  cycle; NADPH-MDH –NADPH-dependent malate dehydrogenase, which is marked as light
  sensitive; OAA – oxaloacetate; OxPhos – oxidative phosphorylation; ATP/ADP translocator
  is bidirectional in plastid and unidirectional in mitochondrion

  thaliana in relation to sucrose translocation.
