caption: . Inhibition of anti-tumor immune response. The purinergic pathway through
  adenosine molecules creates an immunosuppressive and tolerogenic condition in the
  tumor medium. The biologic function of different immune cells such as T cells, DCs,
  MDSCs, NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils are influenced by adenosine, and aid
  in tumor progression.
