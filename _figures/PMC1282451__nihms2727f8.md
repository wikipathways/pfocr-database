caption: A, the normal pathway; B, the CDG-Ia pathway proposed around 1994 (); C,
  the revised CDG-Ia pathway model based upon diminished GDP-M synthesis, M6P accumulation,
  and stimulation of OT by M6P to cleave G3M9Gn2-P-P-Dol. Molecules expected to increase
  in concentration in CDG-Ia are indicatedby larger red lettering, whereas those expected
  to decrease are indicated by smaller blue lettering. The thickness of the arrows
  emphasizes relative metabolic flux.
