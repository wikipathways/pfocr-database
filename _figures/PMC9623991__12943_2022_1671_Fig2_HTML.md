caption: Multiple mechanisms regulate the formation of ILVs. MVBs are characterized
  by containing intralumenal vesicles which can be controlled by multiple mechanisms.
  Generally, they can be divided into two categories which are ESCRT-dependent pathway
  and ESCRT-independent pathway. For the classical ESCRT-dependent pathways, ESCRT-0,
  -I, -II, -III subcomplexes and ATPase VPS4 cooperate in a stepwise manner to mediate
  the ILV formation (1). For the non-canonical ESCRT-dependent pathways, HD-PTP (2)
  or Alix (3) can both recognize specific cargos and recruit ESCRT-III and VPS4 to
  limiting membrane of MVBs, during which other ESCRT subcomplexes are not indispensable.
  In addition, several other proteins or pathways especially components of lipid rafts
  paly crucial roles in ESCRT-independent ILV formation. For example, CD63 could promote
  ILV formation by both ESCRT and ceramide-independent mechanism; nSMase2-ceramide
  pathway could drive ILV formation and MVB sorting of cargos such as PE-conjugated
  LC3 and its binding partners in an ESCRT-independent mechanism. Moreover, caveolin-1
  or flotillins could drive lipid raft dependent ILV formation, during which process
  nSMase-ceramide pathway is required in some cell lines. Specially, F-actin formation
  on the limiting membrane of MVBs that was regulated by S1P signaling promotes ILV
  sorting of cargos, though the precise role of F-actin formation during the generation
  of ILVs is still elusive
