caption: Molecular mechanism of lncRNAs and miRNAs mediated accumulation of Aβ plaques
  and pTAU, neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation in AD. (A) Dysregulation of BACE1-AS,
  XIST, and lnc-51A leads to overproduction of Aβ, contributing to pathogenesis of
  AD. BACE1-AS, XIST, and lnc-51A are highly expressed in brains of the AD patients
  and APP transgenic mice, regulates the expression of BACE1 mRNA and increases the
  production of Aβ. Enhanced expression of lnc-51A in AD patient altered splicing
  mode of SORL1, thereby causing damage to APP processing and leading to promotion
  of the A β deposition. XIST and BACE1 are targets of miR-124 because there is a
  binding site in these two targets. The XIST-miR-124-BACE1 axis regulates the expression
  of BACE1 in AD, determining the formation of Aβ. (B) LncRNAs regulate pTAU accumulation.
  Linc-00507, SOX21-AS1, and NEAT1 have been characterized to be involved in Tau hyperphosphorylation.
  Significantly upregulated expression of linc-00507 downregulates miR181c-5p, thereby
  elevating the levels of MAPT and TTBK1 and consequently enhancing hyperphosphorylation
  of tau protein by activating P25/P35/GSK3β signaling pathway. On the other hand,
  silencing of SOX21-AS1 could attenuate the level of Tau phosphorylation mediated
  by miR107 inhibition. Similarly, downregulation of NEAT1 promoted Tau protein phosphorylation
  via FZD3/GSK3 β/p-tau pathway. (C) LncRNAs regulate neuronal apoptosis. LncRNA-SNHG1,
  lnc-EBF3-AS, and MEG3 have been identified to be involved in neuronal apoptosis,
  linking to pathogenesis of AD. SNHG1 silencing inhibited miR-137, therefore repressing
  KRENEN1 expression and increasing cell viability and inhibiting apoptosis. was maladjusted
  in late-onset AD patients (), its upregulation of lnc-EBF3-AS stimulated the expression
  of EBF3, thus promoting the apoptosis of neurons in AD. (D) LncRNAs regulate neuroinflammation.
  Some lncRNAs, and miRNAs such as MALAT1 and MEG3, have been identified to be involved
  in the neuroinflammation. Upregulation of MALAT1 downregulated expression several
  inflammation-related miRNAs, such as miR-125b and miR-155. These miRNAs target to
  the genes involved in many signaling pathways, such as JAK signal transduction and
  activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, nuclear factor –kB (NF-kB) signaling
  pathway, JNK pathway and p38 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting neuroinflammation
  of AD. downregulated expression of MEG3 promoting the occurrence of inflammation.
