caption: The differences between the ECM− and ID+ fibroblast clusters are largely
  replicated in PDF and JDF spheroids, with distinct features present in PDF fibroblasts.
  Changes common to both samples (left) are enriched in genes downregulated in ECM−
  clusters and participating in several KEGG pathways related to the extracellular
  matrix and TGF-β signalling. Changes specific to PDF spheroids (right) include hyperactivation
  of genes participating in cytokine signalling in the ECM− cluster. No KEGG pathway
  enrichment specific to the JDF sample was observed. The Venn diagram (inset) displays
  a significant overlap (p < 10−6, Fisher’s exact test) of differentially expressed
  genes (false discovery rate FDR < 0.05, at least two-fold change in gene expression)
  in the comparison of the ECM− and ID+ fibroblast clusters in JDF and PDF samples.
