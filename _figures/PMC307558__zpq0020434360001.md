caption: TGF-β signaling pathway. TGF-β binding to the type II receptor results in
  phosphorylation and activation of the type I receptor. The activated type I receptor
  then phosphorylates the receptor-associated SMADs (SMAD 2/3) that promote dimer
  or trimer formation with SMAD4 followed by nuclear translocation. SMAD complexes,
  in collaboration with cofactors, modulate transcription of TGF-β target genes. Induction
  of cell-cycle arrest by TGF-β involves transcription of CDK inhibitors p15INK4b
  and p21CIP1. p15INK4b specifically inhibits CDK4/6, whereas p21CIP1 inhibits cyclin
  E–CDK2 complexes. The inhibited cyclin–CDK complexes can drive progression of the
  cell cycle for a longer time. Activation of CDK2 requires phosphorylation of its
  Thr-160 residue by CAK and removal of inhibitory phosphates on Thr-14 and Tyr-15
  by Cdc25A phosphatase. The new pathway proposed by Bhowmick et al. () involves TGF-β
  activation of the RhoA/p160ROCKsignaling pathway. By an undefined mechanism, TGF-β
  activates RhoA and causes the translocation of p160ROCK to the nucleus, where it
  phosphorylates and inactivates Cdc25A and thereby prevents activation of CDK2.
