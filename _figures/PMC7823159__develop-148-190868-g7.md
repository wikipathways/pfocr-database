caption: Control of InR/TOR signaling network and muscle growth by Activin signaling
  pathway. Activin signaling positively regulates InR/TOR signaling by promoting the
  transcription of Pdk1 and Akt1. Activation of InR increases PI3K-dependent PIP3
  generation, leading to increased activity of PDK1. PDK1 then phosphorylates AKT1
  at Thr342 and S6K at Thr238. The PI3K-generated PIP3 is also necessary for activation
  of the TORC2 complex, which phosphorylates Ser505 of AKT1. When phosphorylated at
  Thr342 and Ser505 sites, AKT1 initiates a cascade of inhibition leading to activation
  of TOCR1 complex that phosphorylates S6K at Thr398. The sequential phosphorylations
  at Thr398 and Thr238 sites fully activate S6K. Mammalian homologous sites of phosphorylation
  are presented in parentheses. The activated S6K then promotes the production of
  certain sarcomeric proteins as well as inhibits signal transduction from InR to
  PI3K. InR/TORC1 signaling increases the steady-state level of Mhc, which can be
  preferentially added to the lateral side of existing sarcomeres when Activin signaling
  is low or absent. However, when activin signaling is high in the muscle this promotes
  epidermal growth, which enables lengthwise addition of sarcomeres, perhaps as a
  consequence of reduced muscle tension and/or the expression of putative factor(s)
  whose function is to shift the mode of Mhc addition toward formation of new sarcomeres
  and vertical expansion of existing sarcomeres.
