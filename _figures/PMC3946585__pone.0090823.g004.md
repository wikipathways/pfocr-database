caption: 'This was modified from pathways presented in KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
  ANOVA was performed to assess the statistical significance of differences between
  samples (p<0.05). Data are mean values with error bars representing standard deviation
  values. Different letters in bars represent the difference of statistical significance
  of metabolites levels. The superscript numbers in compounds represent analysis methods.
  1: NMR analysis of D2O extracts, 2: GC-MS analysis of 70% methanol extracts, 3:
  GC-MS analysis of n-hexane extracts.'
