caption: 'Glycosyltransferases as emerging effectors of melanoma progression. Schematic
  representation of selected glycosyltransferases and their role in the different
  stages of melanoma progression, based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer
  (AJCC) staging system. Stage I melanoma is no more than 1 mm thick; stage II extends
  beyond the epidermis into the thick dermis layer of the skin; stage III has metastasized
  to nearby lymph nodes, lymph vessels or skin; stage IV has metastasized to other
  places throughout the body, such as the brain, lungs or liver. Expression levels
  of FUT1/2, GCNT2 and GnT-III are high in early-stage and diminish during melanoma
  progression, whereas expression of FUT4/8, GCNT3, GnT-V, ST3GAL1, ST3GAL3 and ST6GAL1
  are higher in late-stage melanomas. Glycosyltransferases may promote melanoma progression
  by several mechanisms: (1) interaction between Siglec1-expressing macrophages and
  metastatic cells facilitates metastatic colonization []; (2) loss of GCNT2 enhances
  growth factor receptor and integrin-mediated cell proliferation signaling pathways
  promoting melanoma growth and survival []; (3) Siglec-9/sialoligand interactions
  result in a tumor glycosylation-dependent circuit that suppresses CD8+ T cell effector
  responses in the tumor microenvironment []; (4) FUT8-mediated core fucosylation
  prevents L1CAM cleavage by plasmin, facilitating melanoma cell invasion []; (5)
  ST3GAL1 promotes melanoma metastasis through AXL []; (6) GnT-III represses metastasis
  through regulation of EGFR, integrins and cadherins [,,]; (7) FUT4 regulates melanoma
  cell migration and invasion through activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  []; (8) GCNT3 promotes melanoma cell migration and invasion through stabilization
  of MCAM []. See text for details regarding the role of the reported glycosyltransferases.
