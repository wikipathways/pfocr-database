caption: 'Visual dissection* of the events during AMF colonization and virus infection:
  changes in hormones levels and related processes may enhance (left) or limit (right)
  viral infection leading to the final outcome of the complex tripartite interaction.
  In the early stage of mycorrhization, the increase of salicylic acid (SA) induces
  the priming of SA-dependent defenses, the major defensive pathway against viruses,
  and enhances the siRNA-mediated antiviral silencing. At the same time, abscisic
  acid (ABA) increases with both positive and negative consequences on plant defenses:
  it induces callose deposition on plasmodesmata, limiting cell-to-cell movement,
  suppresses SA signaling transduction, thus inhibiting defenses controlled by this
  pathway and weakens siRNA-antiviral system. In the late AMF colonization stage,
  the increase of jasmonate (JA) and ethylene (ET) induces the priming of JA- and
  ET-dependent defenses. JA has been shown to reduce viral symptoms at early infection
  stage but increase susceptibility in late infection stage; on the other hand, JA
  treatment decreases viral titre during geminivirus infection. ET antagonizes the
  pathway downstream the SA signaling and may be involved in symptom development,
  viral systemic movement and formation of necrotic lesions. However, spraying plants
  with the ET precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid may reduce viral titre.
  Finally, mycorrhizal plants have been shown to improve aphid survival and increase
  attractiveness toward aphids parasitoids. PR: pathogenesis-related proteins, HR:
  hypersensitive response, ROS: reactive oxygen species, brown hexagones indicate
  viral particles (; ; ; ).'
