caption: Biological function of MXRAs. MXRA1, through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif
  (PBM) that interacts with proteins like nNOS, CASK, Homer 1, PISP, and PDLIM1 to
  modulate calcium signaling, and its calmodulin-binding domain (CBD) that regulates
  calcium ion activity via calmodulin interaction, maintains intracellular and extracellular
  calcium homeostasis, inhibits the Calcineurin (CaN)/nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT) pathway (downregulating RCAN1.4 and COX-2 to impair angiogenesis);
  MXRA2, through its C-terminal CH2 domain that binds integrin-linked kinase (ILK)
  to activate integrin signaling, remodel the actin cytoskeleton, and modulate cell
  adhesion/migration (via a conserved paxillin-binding subdomain (PBS) interacting
  with paxillin’s LD motif to connect integrins and ECM, an absence of the C-terminal
  fragment impairs MXRA2 function); and its N-terminal region containing cyclin B1/Cdc2
  phosphorylation sites, a tyrosine phosphorylation site, and PKC/casein kinase II
  phosphorylation sequences activated by the ERK pathway to regulate Rho family signaling
  and cell spreading/movement/migration (inhibited by MEK1 inhibition via UO126),
  directly interacts with Rac (deficiency augmenting Rac activation and lamellipodia
  formation) and activates Src or promotes phosphorylation of p21-activated kinase
  (PAK) and p38 MAPK to degrade ECM and initiate metastasis; MXRA3 modulates cell
  migration by forming an MXRA3-talin complex (KN motif-mediated interaction with
  talin’s R7 domain) that is recruited to adhesion plaques (β-integrins) to induce
  structural modifications and competitively inhibit integrin-actomyosin interactions
  (reducing adhesion strength/traction), recognizes KIF21A (ANK domains) to inhibit
  microtubule growth and influence cell transport/cytoskeleton maintenance/cellular
  development, regulates Rho GTPase activity (reducing podocyte migration by increasing
  GTP-bound RhoA), inhibits NF-κB p65 while enhancing VEGF/bFGF expression to benefit
  myocardial infarction, suppresses inflammation in a Parkinson’s disease astrocyte
  model (reducing TNF-α/IL-1β secretion, decreasing oxidative stress, and enhancing
  antioxidant enzyme activity), and attenuates apoptosis in sepsis-related acute lung
  injury by interacting with HSP70 to inhibit AIF release. MXRA4, existing in soluble
  form (secreted by HUVECs as a serum complement C1q receptor) and membrane-bound
  form, exhibits pro-angiogenic capabilities by forming complexes with MMRN2 or IGFBP7
  to activate VEGF-A/TGF-β2 signaling pathways and enhance tumor angiogenesis; MXRA5,
  activating the MAPK signaling pathway to promote cell proliferation and invasion
  in osteoarthritis cartilage/synovial fluid, appears to protect against kidney tissue
  injury by promoting an anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrotic response (linked to the TGF-β
  pathway by inhibiting chemokine/fibronectin expression to alleviate inflammation/fibrosis);
  MXRA6, with key functional SH2/PTB domains that bind tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins
  (PI3K, EGFR, FAK) to initiate PTK-mediated signaling for cell growth/polarization/migration
  and interact with integrin β subunits to modulate cell adhesion/migration/proliferation,
  regulates Rho GTPase activity by interacting with DLC1 to activate the Hippo signaling
  pathway (impacting cell proliferation/EMT/tumor progression), interacts with PP1α
  via the ABD I region to govern cell polarization/migration/invasion, and potentially
  influences cytoskeletal organization/membrane dynamics/intracellular signaling;
  MXRA7 modulates inflammatory responses (exacerbating liver injury by enhancing matrix
  remodeling genes FN1/TIMP1), and regulates other physiological processes (inhibiting
  corneal neovascularization/promoting skin wound healing); MXRA8, with its extracellular
  domain facilitating intercellular adhesion by interacting with integrin αvβ3 (directly
  impeding integrin αv/β3 heterodimerization, with genetic deletion upregulating osteoclast-related
  Ig-like receptors/integrin αvβ3 and negatively modulating osteoclast differentiation),
  suppresses integrin αvβ3/FAK signaling and inhibits angiogenesis upon overexpression
  in HUVECs, and functions as a key receptor for arthritis-causing alphaviruses by
  interacting with viral E2-E1 heterodimers to promote viral entry
