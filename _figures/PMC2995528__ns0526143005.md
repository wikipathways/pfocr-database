  to neurons, these pathways could potentially alter the13C distribution into brain
  glutamate and glutamine described in Figure . However, it can be calculated that
  these fluxes do not contribute significantly to glutamate and glutamine C4 labeling
  during an infusion of [2-13C] acetate.VPDHg, Glial pyruvate dehydrogenase flux;
