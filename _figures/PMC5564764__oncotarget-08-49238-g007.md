caption: Upon stimuli, BMX, as well as AKT, was activated by tyrosine phosphorylation
  of downstream PI3K via binding to PIP3 through the PH domain [, , ]. BMX could activate
  the phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3. Using three specific inhibitors of the AKT/mTOR
  and STAT3 pathways, the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin,
  and STAT3 inhibitor cryptotanshinone, cell proliferation was further inhibited in
  BMX-knockdown groups. These findings provide new evidence of the BMX function in
  cell proliferation and carcinogenesis of cervical cells through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  and STAT3 pathways.
