caption: Nitric oxide (NO) is generated from the oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline
  by endothelium Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS). NO diffuses into target cells such
  as smooth muscle cells to bind and activate soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which
  in turn generates cyclic GMP (cGMP) from GTP to promote vasodilation, and inhibit
  cell migration and proliferation. The signal is turned off upon cGMP hydrolysis
  to GMP by phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5). Inhibition of this pathway is thought to contribute
  to the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Increase NO biovailability through
  nitrite or nitrate delivery, stimulating sGC with Riociguat, or inhibiting PDE5
  with Tadalafil all provides therapeutic means for the treatment of certain type
  of PH. See Text for details.
