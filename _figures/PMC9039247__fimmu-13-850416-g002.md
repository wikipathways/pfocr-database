caption: Metabolic pathways involved in NETosis. Various metabolic routes have been
  implicated in the release of NETs. Glycolysis is an essential metabolic pathway
  for NADPH oxidase-dependent and -independent NETosis triggered by various stimuli.
  Pentose phosphate pathway has also been shown to participate in classical NETosis,
  by providing the NADPH necessary to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the
  NADPH oxidase complex. Other metabolic pathways associated with mitochondrial activity
  also appear to be partially involved in NET formation, including hydrolysis of glutamine
  by glutaminase (GLS) and subsequent anaplerotic reactions to form α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG) that enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and β-oxidation of fatty
  acids to supply acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to the TCA cycle. In addition, the adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP) synthesized in mitochondria as a product of oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) would be released into the extracellular space through pannexin 1 (Panx1)
  channels and would enhance NET formation through purinergic signaling mechanisms
  dependent on P2X1 receptors.
