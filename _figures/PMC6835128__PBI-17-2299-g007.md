caption: Proposed hypericin biosynthetic pathway based on our metabolomics, transcriptomics
  and functional annotation (given in Table S6). Compounds positively correlated with
  the presence of dark glands are highlighted by a pink background and accompanied
  by numbers in bold as given in Table . Enzymes shown in bold were suggested by previous
  literature. The numbering of the carbon skeleton according to Gill and Giménez ()
  and used throughout the text is given in the structural formula of atrochrysone.
  Pictured masses represent calculated exact masses.
