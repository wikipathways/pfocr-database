caption: The Canonical Hedgehog Signaling Pathway. In the absence of a Hh ligand,
  PTCH inhibits SMO and SUFU binds to GLI transcriptional factors. PKA, CK1, and GSK3β,
  in turn, phosphorylate GLI transcriptional factors GLI2 and GLI3, leading them to
  proteolytic cleavage. Upon binding of a ligand to PTCH, the inhibition of SMO is
  relieved. SMO is phosphorylated by CK1α and GRK2, promoting its accumulation in
  the cilium. Consequently, SUFU, phosphorylated by GSK3β, releases GLI2 that translocates
  in the nucleus and activates the Hh target genes. To note, the dual role of GSK3β,
  which can act as both a promoter and a suppressor of the Hh pathway.
