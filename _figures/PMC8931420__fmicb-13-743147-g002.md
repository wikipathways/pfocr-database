caption: Zika virus-induced mitochondrial stress. ZIKV infection causes mitochondrial
  stress by altering its structure and metabolism to supply energy for viral replication
  through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) pathway. This leads to an increase in
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) which causes DNA damage. Then the DNA damage response
  (DDR) is induced to activate repair pathways to monitor DNA damage.
