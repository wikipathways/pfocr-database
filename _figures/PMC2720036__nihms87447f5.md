caption: 'The program STRING (‘Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins’,
  http://string.embl.de/) collects known physical interactions from the following
  databases: BIND, DIP, MINT, BioGRID, and HPRD. Each interaction is annotated by
  STRING with a benchmarked numerical confidence score. In addition, STRING can retrieve
  indirect protein associations (e.g., genetic and functional interactions) from pathway
  databases (e.g., http://pid.nci.nih.gov), and by text mining the scientific literature.
  C-Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf interactions were collected with a cut-off score of 0.4
  (medium confidence) for experimental data only; 0.9 (highest confidence) for text
  mining; and 0.98 for pathway mining. Data were imported in the Cytoscape software
  (www.cytoscape.org). In addition, BIND, DIP, MINT, BioGRID, HPRD and Intact databases
  were also searched using the BioNetBuilder plugin for Cytoscape and additional search
  tools. All data were imported in Cytoscape and merged. Although there are numerous
  interactions among the group of Raf family-interacting proteins, only direct interactions
  with Raf proteins are shown here (a full version is available on request). Nodes
  (circles; indicating discrete proteins) were color-coded according to confidence
  level of the interaction with Raf as follows: pink, >0.9; green, >0.7; blue, > 0.4;
  yellow, not rated (e.g. the database providing the information lacked sufficient
  annotation for assignment). In addition, the edges (lines) are color-coded as follows:
  blue, direct protein-protein interaction; red, pathway maps; green, text mining.'
