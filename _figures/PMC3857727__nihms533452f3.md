caption: 'Under normal conditions, an appropriate level of nmnat transcription is
  maintained. In Drosophila, there is one NMNAT gene, under the regulation of stress
  transcription factor HSF. During acute stress conditions, NMNAT is upregulated by
  direct binding of HSF to a HSE present in its promoter. In mice, NMNAT2 is involved
  in neuronal maintenance and its transcription is regulated by CREB. CREB can be
  activated by a variety of signaling cascades including activation through the AC–cAMP-PKA
  pathway and direct phosphorylation via activity-dependent increase in CaMKIV. AC
  activity can be triggered by calcium influx through NMDAR or voltage-gated calcium
  channels upon depolarization. However, in tauopathy, toxic Tau species (phosphorylated
  Tau oligomers) reduce synaptic NMDAR function, which could account for a reduction
  in pCREB levels. Alternatively, AKT activity and pGSK3 levels have also been shown
  to affect pCREB levels and these signaling cascades are disrupted in tauopathies.
