caption: 'Methyl groups introduced by O-methyltransferases, and oxidation steps catalyzed
  by cytochrome P450 enzymes are highlighted in green and red, respectively. Bold
  arrows represent the main pathway, whereas thin arrows indicate a shunt pathway.
  The dashed arrow indicates low-level conversion as previously reported (). Color
  codes in the myc gene cluster are: Red, cytochrome P450 genes; purple, ferredoxin
  gene; indigo blue, polyketide synthetase genes; blue, glycosyltransferase genes;
  orange, O-methyltransferase genes; green, deoxysugar biosynthetic genes; yellow,
  self-resistance gene (rRNA methyltransferase gene).'
