caption: Model of Lentinan‐mediated activation of Nrf‐2/ARE antioxidant pathway in
  chronic ethanol consumption‐instigated pancreatic β‐cell oxidative stress. Chronic
  ethanol intake leads to diminished Nrf‐2 expression and its nuclear transcriptional
  regulation activity (probably due to increased Keap1 activity that degrades Nrf‐2),
  which induces insufficient antioxidant enzymes activities, ROS accumulation, oxidative
  stress, and ultimately impaired insulin secretion and β‐cell apoptosis. Lentinan
  stabilizes both cytoplasmic and nuclear Nrf‐2 expression and conquers ethanol‐instigated
  β‐cell oxidative stress, thereby improving glucose metabolism and glucose response
  in chronic ethanol consumption‐induced diabetes
