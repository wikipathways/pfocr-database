caption: Study design. This study was under the NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) project
  consortium. Spaceflight mice after flight were euthanized and frozen on orbit. The
  retinas were isolated from both the ground habitat control and flight mice after
  returning to ground. RNA and DNA were extracted from the retinas, and then RRBS
  and RNA-seq libraries were constructed to obtain DNA methylome and transcriptome,
  respectively. Retinal epigenetic age was calculated using MouseEpigeneticClock script.
  Disease and bio-functional pathways were generated using the DAVID GO functional
  annotation and the Ingenuity Pathway through Analysis (IPA) based on DMGs & DEGs.
