caption: 'Secretion of IL-1β by monocytes in inflammatory diseases. Ligation of pattern
  recognition receptors, such as TLRs, induces expression of inactive pro-IL-1β; its
  cleavage by caspase-1 leads to mature IL-1β and secretion.109 Activation of caspase-1
  requires assembly of the inflammasome, a multimolecular complex that includes NALP3
  (cryopyrin) and the adaptor protein ASC.110 Exogenous ATP triggers the receptor
  P2X7 and its associated pore, pannexin-1, inducing a strong redox response (generation
  of ROS followed by upregulation of antioxidant systems) and facilitating assembly/activation
  of the inflammasome. TLR signaling also stimulates ROS generation and release of
  endogenous ATP, resulting in autocrine stimulation. NLRP3 mutant monocytes (from
  patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes) have altered basal and TLR-stimulated
  redox states, causing increased and abnormally fast secretion of LPS-stimulated
  IL-1β. IL-1 secretion is not increased further by ATP, seemingly due to depletion
  of this pathway after LPS alone.27,45,111 sJIA monocytes do not share this overall
  phenotype,45 but are resistant to ATP-enhanced IL-1 secretion.37 Anakinra treatment
  results in increased P2X7 transcripts in sJIA blood cells,37 suggesting that excess
  IL-1 activity leads to suppression of P2X7. IL-18 processing and secretion is similar
  to that of IL-1; however, pro-IL-18 is constitutively produced by monocytes. Abbreviations:
  ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD; DAMP, damage-associated
  molecular pattern molecule; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PAMP, pathogen-associated
  molecular pattern molecule; P2X7, P2X purinoceptor 7; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  sJIA, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis; TLR, Toll-like receptor.'
