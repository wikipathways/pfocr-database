caption: DNA methylation/demethylation enzymes. Methylation of the promoter regions
  of genes significantly suppresses transcription by direct inhibition of transcription
  factor binding and recruitment of methyl-CpG-binding proteins within their recognition
  sites of transcription factors. DNA methylation occurs at carbon 5 of cytosine (5-methylcytosine
  [5mC]) in CpG dinucleotides. DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation patterns during cell
  proliferation via methylation of a hemimethylated nascent DNA strand. DNMT3A and
  DNMT3B are required for genome-wide de novo methylation and play crucial roles in
  the establishment of DNA methylation patterns. Methylation by DNMTs is counterbalanced
  by DNA demethylation. TET oxidizes 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and subsequently
  to 5-formyl cytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxy cytosine (5caC). The carboxyl group of
  5caC is excised by TDG to restore cytosine. An active demethylation pathway through
  consecutive oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) mediated by TET proteins and subsequent
  BER in mammalian system DNA methylation dynamics. BER, base excision repair; CpG,
  cytosine-phosphate-guanine; DNMT1, DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1; TDG, thymine
  DNA glycolase; TET, ten-eleven translocation. To see this illustration in color,
