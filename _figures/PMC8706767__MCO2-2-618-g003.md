caption: NF‐κB signaling pathway in tumorigenesis. Schematic diagram of the mechanism
  of gene mutation, exogenous carcinogenic stimulation, and inflammation leading to
  liver cancer. In the mice model, the deletion of Mdr gene leads to the accumulation
  of bile acids and induces chronic inflammation of the liver. After inflammatory
  cells migrate to the liver matrix, they release TNFα and invade the liver parenchymal
  cells between the liver epithelium. TNFα activates the NF‐κB signaling pathway,
  resulting in the expression of apoptosis‐inhibiting proteins, pro‐proliferation
  proteins and TNFα and promotes the development of dysplastic nodules into hepatocellular
  carcinoma. In the damage‐promoted diethylnitrosamine liver cancer model, Kupffer
  cells are activated by IL‐1α released by dead liver cells. In the low‐grade inflammation‐promoting
  hepatocellular carcinoma model, the hepatocytes with activated NF‐κB produce cytokines
  and chemokines. These cytokines and chemokines activate Kupffer cells. In these
  two models, activated Kupffer cells produce cytokines and growth factors, which
  promote the expansion of mutated liver cells and the development of liver cancer
