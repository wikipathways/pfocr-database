caption: TCA (tricarboxylic acid cycle) canonical pathway. Canonical pathway of the
  citric acid cycle derived from the IPA analysis. Predicted outcome of the dysregulation
  of several key metabolism rate-limiting enzymes in the TCA cycle is overall downregulation
  of the TCA energy output. Differential protein expression is denoted as red (significantly
  upregulated), green (significantly downregulated), orange (software predicted upregulation),
  blue (software predicted downregulation). The intensity of color indicated the magnitude
  of change. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
