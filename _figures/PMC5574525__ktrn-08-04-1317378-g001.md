caption: Abf1-dependent changes at Ribi gene promoters in response to nutrient signaling.
  Partially speculative scheme illustrating the changes in transcription factor interactions,
  histone acetylation and transcription activity of Abf1-dependent Ribi genes in response
  to TORC1 inactivation (upper panel) or glucose starvation (lower panel). The different
  shapes and colors of Abf1 refer to its different phosphorylation states that may
  predominate under certain conditions. SAGA could support gene activation in the
  absence of promoter-bound Abf1 (see text). The possibility of an Rpd3L-independent
  pathway of repression, which might involve Stb3 and Dot6 only, in the absence of
  bound Abf1, is labeled with an interrogation mark to indicate its purely speculative
  character. Such a pathway would help to explain how full repression could be attained
  even at those promoters that do not carry bound Abf1 and would thus be incapable
  of Rpd3L recruitment. Nucleosomes located upstream and downstream of the nucleosome-free
  region are indicated (−1, +1). For simplicity of representation, the cis-acting
  elements recognized by Abf1, Stb3 (RRPE element) and Dot6/Tod6 (PAC element) are
  not represented on the DNA; their relative positions are approximately indicated
  by the positions of the corresponding DNA-binding proteins.
