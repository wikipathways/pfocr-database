caption: Schematic representation of intrinsic and exrtinsic pathways of anoikis.
  When cells are detached from ECM, normal cells induce anoikis through both intrinsic
  and exrtinsic pathways. Upon cell detachment, FAS and FasL are upregulated and FLIP
  is downregulated, leading to activation of Caspase 8, followed by activation of
  caspase-7 and caspase-3. Loss of cell adhesion also increases and activates proapoptotic
  Bcl-2 proteins (Bik, Puma, Bad, Noxa, Bmf, Bid, Bim, Bax, and Bak), which inactivate
  antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1), and thus causing mitochondria
  membrane permeabilization through Bax/Bak oligomerization. Released cytochrome c
  from mitochondria activates caspase-9, subsequently caspase-3. Smac/DIABLO is released
  and inhibits XIAP, an inhibitor of apoptosis, leading to caspase-3 activation. Activaiton
  of these pathways leads to anoikis. However, increased FLIP expression in cancer
  cells inhibits extrinsic pathway and oncogene expression such as EGFR and hypoxia
  downregulate Bmf and Bim, resulting in inhibition of mitochondrial pathway in suspended
  cells. Accordingly, cancer cells acquire anoikis resistance.
