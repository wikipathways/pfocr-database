caption: (Left) In the absence of Wnt ligands, the Wnt signaling is suppressed. Cytosolic
  β-catenin is phosphorylated by a destruction complex composed of Axin, APC, GSK3β
  and CK1 and then ubiquitinated and targeted to proteasomal degradation. Into the
  nucleus, the transcription of Wnt target genes is repressed by Groucho binding to
  Tcf/Lef. (Right) Wnt activation. The binding of Wnt ligands to their receptors Fzd/LRP5/6/Dvl,
  determines the disruption of the β-catenin destruction complex, thus inducing the
  stabilization of the protein, which can translocate into the nucleus, function as
  a cofactor for Tcf/Lef and activate Wnt target genes (APC, adenomatous polyposis
  coli; β-cat, β-catenin; CK1, casein kinase cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding
  factor).
