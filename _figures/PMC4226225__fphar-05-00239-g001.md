caption: 'The cascade of arachidonic acid (AA). AA is a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty
  acid which is released from the sn2 position of membrane phospholipids by the activity
  of cPLA2. Free AA can be metabolized to eicosanoids through three major pathways:
  the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway, and the cytochrome
  P450 (CYP) pathway. In the CYP pathway, AA is converted to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids
  (EETs) and 20-HETE by CYP epoxygenases and CYP ω-hydroxylases, respectively. All
  EETs are then further metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) forming the
  less active dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs). Modified from .'
