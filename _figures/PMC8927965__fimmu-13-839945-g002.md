caption: The survivin-miRNA axis is depicted schematically. Several survivin-targeting
  miRNAs regulate survivin expression either directly by binding to the 3′-UTR of
  survivin mRNA or indirectly by influencing the pathways that alter survivin expression
  as a downstream target. For example, miR-16 inhibits the p53/survivin signaling
  pathway, resulting in survivin downregulation, while miR-21 and miR-150 downregulate
  PTEN. PTEN inhibits Akt via the PI3k axis, NF-κB-dependent survivin upregulation
  occurs. Similarly, miR-203 and miR-16 regulate survivin expression by interacting
  with NF-κB. MiR-20 is another well-established survivin-targeting miRNA that inhibits
  SFMBT1 and regulates the TGF-β1/Survivin pathway. Moreover, miR-125 and miR-34a
  indirectly regulate survivin expression through interaction with STAT3 and E2F3,
  respectively. Conversely, miR-34a, miR-203, miR-16, miR-708, miR-485, and miR-335
  specifically target the 3’ UTR of survivin mRNA and hence downregulate survivin
  expression. PTEN, Phosphatase and tensin homolog; Akt, Protein kinase B; NF-κB,
  Nuclear factor-kappa B; TGF-β, Transforming growth factor-beta; E2F3, Transcription
  Factor 3; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; 3′-UTRs, 3′-untranslated
  regions.
