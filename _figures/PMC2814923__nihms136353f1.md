  []. Glucose imported into the cells is rapidly phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate
  and converted to fructose-6-phosphate, which is subsequently metabolized to glucosamine-6-phosphate
  by L-glutamine-D-fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) ultimately leading
  to the synthesis of uridine-diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). UDP-GlcNAc
  is the obligatory substrate for OGT (uridine-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine: polypeptide
  β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase), which catalyzes the formation of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine
  (O-GlcNAc) on serine and threonine residues of proteins. β-N-acetylglucosaminidase
  (O-GlcNAcase) catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc from the proteins. Glucose entry
  into the HBP can be attenuated by inhibition of GFAT by the glutamine analogs 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine
  (DON) and O-diazoacetyl-L-serine (Azaserine). The level of O-GlcNAc on proteins
  can be blocked by inhibiting OGT with the uridine analog Alloxan or with TTO4 (2[(4-chlorophenyl)imino]
  tetrahydro-4-oxo-3 (2-tricyclo[3.3.1.13.7]dec-1-ylethel)); whereas O-GlcNAcylation
  of proteins can be rapidly increased by inhibiting O-GlcNAcase with PUGNAc (O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate)
  or with NAG-thiazoline (1,2 dideoxy-2-methyl-D-glucopyranoso(2,1-d)-2-thiazoline).
  As described in the text several different interventions that have been shown to
  be cardioprotective, such as increasing levels of glucose, glutamine, insulin and
  most recently glucosamine all have the potential to increase flux through the HBP
  and thus augment protein O-GlcNAc levels.'
