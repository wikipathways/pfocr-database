caption: Mammalian choline degradation pathway with DMGDH as metabolic branch point.
  Choline degradation to dimethylglycine is catalyzed by three enzymes, choline dehydrogenase
  (CHD), betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BAD), and betaine homocysteine S‐methyltransferase
  (BHMT). Conversion of dimethylglycine (DMG) to sarcosine by DMGDH reduces the FAD
  cofactor and a methyl group is donated to THF resulting in FADH 2 and N‐5,10‐methylene‐THF.
  The enzyme is reoxidized by the interaction with hETF and the derived electrons
  are further channeled by ETF‐QO to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. N‐5,10‐methylene‐THF
  is consumed in further reactions catalyzed by methylene‐THF reductase (MTHFR) and
  serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). DMGDH is the only enzyme converting dimethylglycine
  to sarcosine and the only other known route to sarcosine is via glycine N‐methyl
  transferase (GNMT). Sarcosine is further converted to glycine, mostly by sarcosine
  dehydrogenase (SARDH), and is also a substrate for dimethylglycine dehydrogenase
  and peroxisomal sarcosine oxidase (PIPOX).
