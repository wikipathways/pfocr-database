caption: Electrical stimulation elevates peripheral nerve regeneration-associated
  genes within the neuronal cell body.ES increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), which upregulates the expression
  of cyclic AMP (cAMP) through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. The signal Ras-mitogen
  activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK) pathway, which is essential for the neurophin-induced
  differentiation of neuronal cells, is activated by BDNF as well. Ras, which is stimulated
  by the trkB receptor, also causes activation of kinases phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt
  (PI3K/Akt). The different neurotrophin signaling pathways activated by cAMP response
  element-binding protein (CREB) converge at the level of transcription in the nucleus.
  CREB induces increased expression of regeneration-associated genes such as growth-associated
  protein-43 (GAP-43), which promotes axonal sprouting and prevents growth cone collapse,
  and Tα1 tubulin, which is an integral protein for cytoskeletal assembly. See the
  text in the section “Staggered axonal regeneration” for a detailed description.
