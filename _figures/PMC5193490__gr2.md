caption: Nrf2 affects mitochondrial function at multiple levels. Nrf2 activation increases
  the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), the availability of substrates for respiration,
  and ATP production. Nrf2 positively regulates the levels of NADPH by enhancing the
  expression of genes encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the enzymes
  of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), malic enzyme 1 (ME1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase
  1 (IDH1). In addition to NADPH, ME1 regenerates pyruvate, which can cycle back to
  the mitochondria. Nrf2 also regulates the levels of GSH by enhancing the expression
  of genes encoding enzymes involved in its biosynthesis and regeneration from its
  oxidized form, GSSG, including glutathione reductase (GR). Nrf2 negatively regulates
  ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl
  CoA desaturase, four critical enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis (FAS). A
  decrease in the levels of malonyl-CoA may increase mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO) by relieving its inhibitory function on carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1),
  which mediates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria. The
  red and the blue colors indicate positive and negative regulation by Nrf2, respectively.
  The presentation of the structure of each respiratory complex is adapted from reference
  . IMS, mitochondrial intermembrane space.
