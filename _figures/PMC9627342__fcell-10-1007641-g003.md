caption: Schematic representation of the impact of hypoxia-associated metabolic adaptation
  in MB. Hypoxia is a major component of the tumor microenvironment that shapes tumor
  heterogeneity; the levels of oxygen in cancer cells decrease with increasing distance
  from the blood vessels. In hypoxic MB cells, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α)
  supports the Warburg effect by upregulating the expression of genes involved in
  the glycolytic pathway, such as GLUT1, carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). The use of PDK1 inhibitor OSU03012 induces mitochondrial-dependent
  apoptosis in MB. Moreover, hypoxic conditions were found to trigger upregulation
  of NOTCH, which correlates with a poor prognosis in MB. A connection between HIF1α
  and NOTCH signaling is also found, driving stemness and cancer stem cells (CSCs)
  expansion. Finally, hypoxia upregulates CD133 (staminal marker) expression in MB
  cells and contributes to therapy resistance (after both etoposide (Eto) and radiotherapy
  (X-ray) treatments) by attenuating DNA damage signaling. Figure is created in “BioRender.com”.
