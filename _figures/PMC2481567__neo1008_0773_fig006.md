caption: Notch1, p53, and HMGA1 interplay in normal and HPV-infected keratinocytes.
  p53 directly controls Notch1 expression in normal keratinocytes, thus contributing
  to the inhibition of cell growth and induction of cell differentiation (A). In infected
  keratinocytes (B), HPV oncoproteins, whose expression is sustained by AP1 and HMGA1,
  reduce p53 expression, and by inducing HMGA1, further decrease its activity leading
  to Notch1 repression, inhibition of cell differentiation, and ablation of growth
  inhibitory signals, thus providing a strong contribution to carcinogenesis. Overexpression
  of Notch1 intracellular domain in this context (C) impairs AP1-dependent E6/E7 transcription,
  and as a consequence, HMGA1 levels decline, further reducing E6/E7 enhanceosome
  activity and HPV oncoproteins' expression. Both conditions favor the accumulation
  of active p53, the induction of its strong oncosuppressive pathway, and the increase
  in the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to chemotoxic drugs.
