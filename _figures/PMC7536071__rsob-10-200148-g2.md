caption: Pathways involved in the consequences of aneuploidy. The role of aneuploidy
  in tumorigenesis depends on tumour stage, cell type, genomic context, tumour microenvironment
  and immune response. Aneuploidy promoting detrimental cellular stresses, such as
  proteotoxic stress (HSP inhibition, proteasome inhibition), metabolic stress (AMPK
  stimulation), replication stress (MCM inhibition, nucleoside depletion) and mitotic
  stress (microtubule poisons) can activate apoptosis and senescence, suppressing
  tumour development. On the other hand, cancer cells can develop tolerance mechanisms
  to permit the propagation of aneuploid cells. Some proliferating aneuploid cells
  may stimulate the DNA damage response leading to senescence and cGAS activation.
  The resulting senescent cells can produce SASPs and the activated cGAS pathway increases
  pro-inflammatory cytokines to elicit NK cell recognition to suppress tumorigenesis
  or to promote tumorigenesis or metastasis.
