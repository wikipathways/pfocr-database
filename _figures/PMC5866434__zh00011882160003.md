caption: Effect of CO on cell death pathways. CO can modulate apoptotic signaling
  and prosurvival pathways leading to cytoprotection. CO-dependent antiapoptotic effects
  have been related to the upregulation of the MKK3/p38 MAPK pathway, resulting in
  modulation of the expression and activation of apoptotic effector molecules. CO
  may target mitochondria, leading to modulation of mtROS flux and downstream adaptive
  signaling. Furthermore, the stimulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
  and NF-κB-dependent prosurvival pathways has been associated with the protective
  effects of CO.
