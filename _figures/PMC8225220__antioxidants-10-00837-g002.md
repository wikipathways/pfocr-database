caption: 'Probable mechanism of association of pesticide-induced ROS with hypogonadism
  and ED. Diazinon enhances LTH levels, which in turn lowers the activity of LH. Diazinon
  also stimulates producing serotonin that inhibits the action of both LH and FSH,
  thereby decreasing testosterone levels. Chlorpyrifos can reduce the activity of
  AChE in the hypothalamus. Consequently, the entire HPG axis is disrupted, leading
  to reduced testosterone production. Chlorpyrifos also reduces the concentration
  of sialic acid, which then inhibits Leydig cells. Cypermethrin disrupts the HPG
  axis by inhibiting the activity of the hypothalamus. Organophosphorus pesticides
  diazinon and chlorpyrifos, as well as pyrethroid pesticide cypermethrin, cause a
  decline in the antioxidant enzyme activity, thereby enhancing ROS generation. ROS
  causes lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, which inhibits the activity of Leydig
  cells, followed by reduced testosterone synthesis. Reduction in testosterone levels
  brings about the inactivity of the NOS enzyme, which ultimately leads to ED. Red
  arrows represent the increase and decrease of the respective substances, which have
  a negative impact on testosterone production, leading to hypogonadism and ED. (LTH:
  luteotropic hormone, AChE: acetylcholinesterase, GnRH: gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
  LH: luteinizing hormone, FSH: follicle-stimulating hormone, SOD: superoxide dismutase,
  NOS: nitric oxide synthase, ED: erectile dysfunction, ROS: reactive oxygen species).'
