caption: Proposed mechanism of HoxA10-mediated inhibition of HBV replication. (Left)
  HBV life cycle. HBV virions enter the cell through the sodium taurocholate cotransporting
  polypeptide (NTCP) receptor and release rcDNA-containing nucleocapsids into cytoplasm.
  rcDNA is transported to the nucleus and forms cccDNA. Transcription of cccDNA by
  RNA polymerase (Pol) produces 4 pregenomic RNAs (pgRNAs) (3.5 kb, 2.4 kb, 2.1 kb,
  and 0.7 kb) encoding surface antigens, core or HBeAg, X, and DNA polymerase. The
  pgRNA is encapsidated, together with polymerase, and reverse transcribed into negative-strand
  DNA [(−)DNA] inside the nucleocapsid. Positive-strand DNA [(+)DNA] synthesis from
  (−)DNA generates rcDNA and forms HBV virions, which are released from the cells.
  (Right) HBV replication activation. In response to HBV infection or other stimuli,
  p38 MAPK is activated by phosphorylation, enters the nucleus, and phosphorylates
  STAT3. Activated STAT3 binds the EnhI/X promoter to facilitate HBV gene expression.
  (Middle) HBV replication repression. HBV activates HoxA10, which subsequently inhibits
  HBV replication through several strategies. First, HoxA10 directly interacts with
  p38 MAPK to repress the signaling pathway. Second, HoxA10 recruits SHP-1 to facilitate
  p38 MAPK dephosphorylation, which leads to repression of STAT3. Third, HoxA10 directly
  binds the HBV X promoter to compete with STAT3 and repress HBV genome transcription.
  TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor.
