caption: “KEGG Pathways in cancer” signaling pathway shown as an interacting network.
  This pathway was hyperactivated in the patient’s tumor tissue. Green arrows indicate
  activation, red arrows–inhibition. Transcript nodes are shown in ovals. The color
  depth of transcript nodes reflects the extent of node activation (logarithms of
  the case-to-normal (CNR) expression rate for each node, in which “normal” is a geometric
  average between expression levels in normal tissue samples). Molecular targets of
  regorafenib are indicated by black arrows. Visualization was implemented using Oncobox
  software. The PI3Ks-AKT signaling axis is marked in blue ellipse.
