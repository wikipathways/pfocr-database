caption: Schematic summary of the relationship between αvβ3 and α5β1 integrin recycling,
  ROCK signaling, and migrational persistence in fibroblasts. (A) αvβ3 integrin is
  internalized and recycles rapidly via the short-loop pathway under the control of
  Rab4 and PKD1 to engage ECM ligand (VN/FN). This process exerts a tonic inhibition
  on the return of internalized α5β1 integrin from the Rab11 compartment to the plasma
  membrane. Under these circumstances, α5β1 has little or no ability to promote cofilin
  phosphorylation via the ROCK pathway, and cells migrate persistently. (B) After
  disruption of the short-loop pathway (by RNAi of PKD1, expression PKD1916A, dominant-negative
  Rab4, or β3 mutants that cannot bind PKD1), reduction of αvβ3 levels by shRNA or
  pharmacological blockade of its interaction with ECM ligand (c-RGDfNmeV), the rate
  at which α5β1 recycles from the Rab11 compartment is increased (bold arrow). Under
  these circumstances, α5β1 promotes ROCK-dependent cofilin phosphorylation and migrational
  persistence is suppressed. (C) When short-loop recycling or αvβ3 engagement is suppressed,
  addition of an α5β1 function-blocking antibody (mAb16) or a ROCK inhibitor (Y27632)
  reduces phosphocofilin levels, and the cells migrate persistently.
