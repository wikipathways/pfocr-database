caption: Proposed model of mitochondrial XIAP action in relation to the canonical
  MOMP pathway. During intrinsic apoptosis signaling, mitochondria contribute to the
  progression of apoptosis through the release of pro-apoptotic proteins, including
  cytochrome c and Smac, from the intermembrane space to the cytosol. This is accomplished
  via Bcl-2 family of protein-regulated MOMP (indicated by solid lines). In the cytosol,
  cytochrome c promotes caspase activation through apoptosome complex formation, and
  Smac inhibits XIAP to relieve caspase suppression. In parallel, BH3-only protein
  activity or mitochondrial bioenergetics stress in combination with high XIAP levels
  induced a pro-survival XIAP-mediated mitochondrial processing pathway (indicated
  by dashed lines and yellow nodes). XIAP translocates to and enters into mitochondria,
  where its E3 ligase activity results in ubiquitylation (Ub) of OMM and inner mitochondrial
  compartments. Consequently, the XIAP inhibitor Smac is degraded through concerted
  endolysosomal and proteasomal action (). XIAP entry into mitochondria depends on
  Bax/Bak and is opposed by Bcl-2/-xL. Intramitochondrial XIAP-associated Smac degradation
  occurs independently of Drp1-regulated cytochrome c release, i.e. uncoupled from
  canonical MOMP.
