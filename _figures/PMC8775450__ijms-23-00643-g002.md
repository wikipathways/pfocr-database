caption: SIRTs-regulated pathways where viral protein Tat induces cytotoxicity. (1)
  Mitochondria biogenesis. SIRT1 participates in this cellular process through several
  deacetylation reactions. First, SIRT1 deacetylates LKB1, which in turn activates
  AMPK. This kinase phosphorylates FOXO3, which is also deacetylated by SIRT1 to induce
  transcription of genes such as PGC1α. SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of PGC1α promotes
  the expression of genes involved in mitochondria biogenesis, such as Nrf1-2 and
  TFAM. SIRT2 could participate in this process by interaction with PGC1α in the same
  way that SIRT1 (2) UPR. SIRT1 influences the phosphorylation of eIF-2α in two ways,
  one of which is through modulating phosphorylation levels of PERK, which activates
  eIF-2α. The second pathway is when SIRT1 regulates dephosphorylation/deacetylation
  of eIF-2α via GADD34/PP1 complex. (3) Mitophagy. The SIRT1/3-mediated deacetylation
  of FOXO3 promotes transcription of PINK1, a key protein in mitophagy. SIRT3 deacetylates
  p53/Parkin complex, allowing parkin translocation to the OMM to initiate mitophagosome
  formation. (4) Mitochondria fusion. SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of OPA1 promotes
  mitochondrial fusion and modulation of mtDNA copies, morphology, and size of mitochondria.
  (5) Antioxidant response. Expression of MnSOD is induced by SIRT3-mediated deacetylation
  of FOXO3. (6) mtDNA repair. SIRT3-mediated deacetylation prevents degradation of
  OGG1, which in turn DNA eliminates oxidized guanine 8-oxoG to repair the mtDNA.
  (7) Microtubule stability. SIRT2 interacts with α-tubulin, which is part of the
  cytoskeleton. Acetylation levels correlate with microtube stability. Image created
