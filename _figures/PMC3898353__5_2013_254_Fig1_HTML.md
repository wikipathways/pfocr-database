caption: Complement activation pathways. Classical pathway is activated by C1 assembled
  on antigen-bound antibodies or in an antibody-independent manner by some viruses
  or Gram-negative bacteria, and the lectin pathway by mannose-binding lectin (MBL)
  attached to carbohydrates on the surface of microorganisms. Both pathways converge
  to release the common C3 convertase (C4bC2b). The alternative pathway is constantly
  activated at a tightly controlled level and generates C3 convertase (C3(H2O)Bb/C3bBb)
  that release C3b at low level, which can readily initiate amplification. The assembled
  convertases cleave C3 to anaphylactic and antimicrobial C3a and C3b, an opsonin
  that is deposited on nearby surfaces and serves to amplify the activation signals.
  C3b also serves to generate the next generation C5 convertases, which further activate
  the cascade, leading to terminal membrane attack complex and target cell lysis
