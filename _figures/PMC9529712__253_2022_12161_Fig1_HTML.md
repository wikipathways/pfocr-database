caption: 'Overview of ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (EMCP) in M. extorquens AM1. The EMCP
  is interlaced with the serine cycle, the PHB cycle, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
  Cleavage of (2R/3S)-methylmalyl-CoA by malyl-CoA/beta-methylmalyl-CoA lyase (mcl)
  releases glyoxylate, which replenishes the serine cycle (indicated by boxes). Further
  genes of EMCP are: β-ketothiolase (phaA); acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (phaB); crotonase
  (croR); crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (ccr); ethylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (epi);
  ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase (ecm); methylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase (msd); mesaconyl-CoA
  dehydratase (mcd); propionyl-CoA carboxylase (pcc); methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mcm).
  Expression of heterologous thioesterase-encoding gene yciA leads to hydrolysis of
  (2S)-methylsuccinyl-CoA and mesaconyl-CoA (bold blue arrows). The corresponding
  products, namely 2-methylsuccinic acid and mesaconic acid, are released into the
  supernatant'
