caption: 'The Role of DEAD-Box Helicases in Colorectal Cancer: DDX3: DDX3 enhances
  the transcription of KRAS by increasing the binding of SP1 to the KRAS promoter,
  leading to increased KRAS expression and activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. This
  results in the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9, reducing GSK3β-mediated degradation
  of β-catenin, thereby increasing β-catenin levels. This subsequently promotes tumor
  invasion and metastasis through the β-catenin/ZEB1 axis. Additionally, DDX3 acts
  as a regulatory subunit of CK1ε, promoting CK1ε-mediated phosphorylation of Dvl2.
  The increased phosphorylated Dvl2 blocks PP2A-mediated degradation of β-catenin,
  enhancing β-catenin stability and increasing its binding to TCF in the nucleus.
  This upregulates the downstream genes of the β-catenin/TCF signaling pathway, promoting
  tumor invasion and progression in colorectal cancer. Knockdown of DDX3 induces G1
  phase cell cycle arrest. DDX5: DDX5 and β-catenin occupy the TCF4/LEF binding elements
  (TBE) on the FOXM1 promoter, acting as a transcriptional co-stimulatory factor to
  promote FOXM1 transcription. Overexpression of FOXM1 enhances the proliferation,
  migration, and tumor growth in colorectal cancer. O-GlcNAcylation of DDX5 protein
  increases its stability, which activates the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, promoting
  colorectal cancer progression. DDX10: DDX10 selectively splices the mRNA of RPL35,
  increasing the occurrence of AT (alternative terminator) in RPL35 mRNA. This then
  affects downstream E2F transcription factor-mediated signaling pathways, promoting
  colorectal cancer progression. DDX17: DDX17 reduces the levels of Claudin-1 and
  E-cadherin while increasing the levels of Vimentin and N-cadherin, thereby promoting
  the EMT process. DDX17 downregulates miR-149-3p, reducing its inhibitory effect
  on CYBRD1 expression by binding to the 3´-UTR of CYBRD1. The resulting increase
  in CYBRD1 expression promotes CRC cell metastasis and EMT, contributing to the aggressive
  progression and invasion of colorectal cancer. DDX21: DDX21 interacts with WDR5,
  a core component of the MLL/SET1 complex, increasing the enrichment of H3K4me3 on
  the CDK1 promoter and enhancing CDK1 expression at the transcriptional level. This
  accelerates the cell cycle, promoting colorectal cancer cell proliferation and tumor
  growth. DDX21 also promotes the G2/M transition in CRC cells and enhances tumor
  proliferation and growth in vivo. Furthermore, DDX21 promotes the expression of
  MMP-2 and MMP-9. DDX27: DDX27 regulates EMT by upregulating mesenchymal markers
  (Slug and Vimentin) and downregulating epithelial markers (E-cadherin), thereby
  promoting colorectal cell migration and invasion. DDX27 protein directly interacts
  with NPM1, facilitating its interaction with p65 in the nucleus, which increases
  the binding activity of p65 to NF-κB target gene promoters. This enhances transcription
  and upregulates downstream NF-κB target genes, promoting colorectal tumor progression'
