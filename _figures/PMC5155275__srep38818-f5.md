caption: Acids/solvents producing pathway (A), amino acids producing pathway (B).
  The fold change (FC) value is indicated directly beside the gene ID of 12 h and
  24 h respectively. Text in red and green represents the up-regulated and down-regulated
  genes, respectively. The blue dash box indicated the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from
  pyruvate. Detailed enzymes and their associated gene ID can be found in .
