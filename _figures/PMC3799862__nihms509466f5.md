caption: Role of TRAF6 in RANK Signal Transduction Pathway. Receptor Activator of
  NF-κB (RANK) Signaling is the Main Signal Pathway Associated With Osteolytic Bone
  Disease (OBD) In Multiple Myeloma (MM). TRAF6 is Critical in Regulation of RANK-Signaling
  Events. The N-Terminal Zinc-Binding Domain of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor–Associated
  Factor (TRAF)6, Especially the Really Interesting New Gene (RING) Domain, Appears
  to Mediate These Downstream Signaling Pathways. Receptor Activator of NF-κB Ligand
  (RANKL) Stimulates the Lys63-Linked Polyubiquitination of TRAF6 in the Presence
  of the Dimeric E2 Enzyme Consisting Of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 13 (Ubcl3) and
  Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme Variant (UevlA). The Lys63-Linked Polyubiquitin Chain
  on TRAF6 Recruits Transforming Growth Factor-β–Activated Protein Kinase 1-Binding
  Protein (TAB) to the Complex, which Results in the Autoactivation of TGF-β–Activated
  Kinase 1 (TAK1) by an Unknown Mechanism. Subsequently, TAK1 Activates Downstream
  Kinases to Activate the Transcription Factors NF-κB and AP-1 (Consisting of c-Fos
  and c-jun). TRAF6 also Mobilizes Intracellular Calcium to Activate Calcineurin,
  Causing the Dephosphorylation of Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells Cytoplasmic
  1 (NFATcl) and its Translocation Into the Nucleus, where, in Concert with NF-κB
  and AP-1, it Leads to the Promotion of the Expression of Key Genes Associated With
  Osteoclast Differentiation. RANKL Also Stimulates the Src Kinase Pathway (PI3K/Akt)
  Through TRAF6 to Initiate Cytoskeleton Rearrangements and Actin ring Formation for
  the Bone-Resorbing Activity of the Osteoclast and Induces Antiapoptosis Activity
  of MM Cells. AKT also Plays a Key Role in the Phosphorylation of the IκB Kinase
  (IKK) Complex to Activate NF-κB.,,,–,
