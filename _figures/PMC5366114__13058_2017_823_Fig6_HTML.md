caption: Potential pathway through which stress hormones may stimulate the production
  of reactive nitrogen species (RNS)/reactive oxygen species (ROS). Glucocorticoid
  (GC) and norepinephrine (NE) induce DNA damage through the production of RNS/ROS.
  Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) may facilitate non-genomic effects
  on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) through a post-translational modification.
  Binding of glucocorticoids to the GR promotes translocation to the nucleus to act
  on GR response elements (GRE), facilitating transactivation or transrepression of
  genes. Binding also induces conformational changes including dissociation of a multiprotein
  complex comprising heat shock proteins (HSP) and Src. Src may then mediate phosphorylation
  of iNOS extending its half-life and promoting the generation of nitric oxide (NO).
