caption: Biological pathway of hemostasis (coagulation cascade)Pathway visualization
  based on Reactome and complemented with details from KEGG and the literature. Tiles
  illustrate log-fold change values of PD compared with CTRL in pancreatic islets.
  Proteins leading the increase of the pathway are marked as driving and are shown
  in black font and colored tiles. Proteins participating in the pathway and identified
  from MS proteomics, but not marked as leading edges, are in white tiles, whereas
  those in gray were not identified in this analysis.
