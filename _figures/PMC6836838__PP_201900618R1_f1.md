caption: The tocopherol biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis and its P. syringae-triggered
  induction in leaves. Tyr, l-Tyr. In Arabidopsis, TAT1 and HPPD are localized in
  the cytosol, while other tocopherol pathway enzymes are in the chloroplast (). The
  coloring of the tocopherol biosynthetic genes represents their degree of regulation
  in response to P. syringae inoculation (red, strongly up-regulated; orange, moderately
  up-regulated; black, no significant change; green, down-regulated). The coloring
  of the frames surrounding the metabolites indicates the degree of pathogen-induced
  metabolite accumulation (red, strong; orange, moderate; gray, no significant change),
  and the frame line widths illustrate the absolute levels of the metabolites in inoculated
  leaves of wild-type plants.
