caption: Network includes Mφ genes exclusively regulated in the cervix from D21 rats
  and those regulated in both in D21 prepartum and NP groups, as well as known key
  molecules. Red signifies up-regulated genes and green indicates down-regulated expression.
  IPA drawn lines predicted activation (orange) or inhibition (blue) of gene expression
  between key molecules. Other lines indicate no known relationship (black) or uncertainty
  about relationship (yellow). Color intensity indicates relative expression based
  upon p-value or prediction intensity. Groups of genes are clustered into Inflammation,
  Extracellular matrix, or Signaling based on annotations provided by IPA.
