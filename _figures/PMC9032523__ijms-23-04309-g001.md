caption: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthetic pathways. NAD+ is de
  novo synthesized from tryptophan in the kynurenine pathway. The rate-limiting enzymes
  tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) convert tryptophan
  to N-formylkynurenine, which is then transformed into L-kynurenine and converted
  to 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO). Kynureninase
  (KYNU) converts 3-HK to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), from which 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid oxygenase (3HAO) generates α-amino-β-carboxymuconate ε-semialdehyde (ACMS).
  ACMS is either diverted, by the activity of alpha-amino-beta-carboxy-muconatesemialdehyde
  decarboxylase (ACMSD), away from NAD+synthesis or can spontaneously convert into
  qunilinic acid (QA). Qunolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) transforms QA into
  nicotinamide mononucleotide (NAMN), at which point the kynurenine pathway converges
  with the Preiss-Handler pathway. In the Preiss-Handler pathway, nicotinic acid (NA)
  is converted by nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) to NAMN, which
  is transformed by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNAT 1–3) into
  nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD). Finally, NAD+ synthetase converts NAAD
  to NAD+. NAM liberated in NAD+-consuming reactions, catalyzed by PARPs, SIRTs and
  CD38/CD157, is recycled to NAD+ in the salvage pathway. Intracellular nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) converts NAM to NMN, which is then converted to
  NAD+. In conditions of either excessive liberation of NAM in NAD+-consuming reactions,
  or dietary surplus, nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) methylates NAM to generate
  N1-methylnicotinamide (MNAM) and prevent NAM’s inhibitory effect on PARPs and SIRTs.
  Aldehyde oxidase (AOX1) transforms MNAM into N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide
  (2PY) and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (4PY). NAM, MNAM, 2PY and 4PY are secreted
  from cells and excreted in urine.
