caption: Role of the glutathione pathway and ABC-transporter family in drug elimination
  and defense from ROS-mediated oxidative stress. Shaded diamonds represent intracellular
  drug and drug metabolites. Glutathione (GSH) is represented by clear pentagons.
  The rate-limiting step in its de novo biosynthesis is the enzyme glutamate-cysteine
  ligase (GCL). The balance of drug/drug metabolites and intracellular GSH is a significant
  determinant of drug levels and ROS stress. Glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) reduces
  hydrogen peroxide generated after exposure to certain drugs, by oxidizing GSH to
  its disulfide form GSSG. Glutathione S-transferases (GST) conjugate GSH to drugs
  and drug metabolites, thus facilitating drug-conjugate elimination and efflux. GSTs
  also function as peroxidases to a lesser extent than GPx1 (not shown for simplicity).
  The ABC transporters ABCB1 (MDR1), ABCC1 (MRP1), and ABCC2 (MRP2) among others are
  involved in ATP-dependent efflux of drugs or drug-GS conjugates.
