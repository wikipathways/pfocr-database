caption: The figure illustrates known roles of KLFs in various aspects of lymphocyte
  differentiation and function. The KLFs written in green promote the indicated activity,
  while KLFs indicted by red text inhibit the response. Note that KLFs expressed in
  the same cell may cooperate or antagonize with each other. The role of KLF2 and
  KLF4 in control of T cell quiescence is shown with a dotted line, since the physiological
  significance of this pathway is unclear. The capacity of KLF3 to oppose KLF2 in
  control of some lymphocyte trafficking molecules has been shown in B cells but not
  yet addressed in T cells, hence KLF3 is written in parenthesis. Details of individual
  functions are provided in the text.
