caption: Schematic representation of TLR and NLR pathways driving pro-inflammatory
  state after exposure to extracellular and Intracellular microbial products. TLRs
  are localized either on the cell surface (TLR 2, 1,4, 6, 11) or within an endosome
  (TLR 3, 7, 9) of biliary epithelial, sinusoidal, endothelial, stellate, Kupffer
  cells and hepatocytes. TLR 2, 1 and 6 associate with each other and adaptor proteins,
  thereby initiating (i) MyD88 adaptor protein-dependent NFκB activation and subsequent
  transcription of inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β and IL-18). TLR3 and TLR4, when
  stimulated, also initiate (ii) the TRIF pathway, which activates downstream IRFs
  and subsequent transcription of type I interferons. NLRs such as NOD1/2, when stimulated
  by intracellularly incorporated signals (e.g. bacterial peptidoglycans), form inflamma-
  some complexes that lead to both (iii) NFκB activation and caspase production, the
  latter of which (iv) activates precursor cytokines, e.g. IL- 1 β and IL-18. IL,
  interleukin; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; NLR, NOD-like receptor; NOD, nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain; TLR, toll-like receptor; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing
  interferon-β.
