caption: Platforms for complement activation. (A) Properdin is released from activated
  neutrophils and is bound to the cell membrane where it recruits C3b to form the
  alternative pathway C3 convertases. C5a then activates additionally neutrophils
  and they secrete more properdin. This installs a vicious cycle of neutrophil and
  complement activation. (B) Properdin released from neutrophils or in the plasma
  binds to activated platelets promoting C3(H2O) recruitment and complement activation.
  (C) Stimulation of endothelial cells with C3a, heme, or other agonists induces expression
  of P-selectin. P-selectin contains CCP domains and binds C3b, promoting formation
  of C3 convertases that generate more C3a to stimulate cells.
