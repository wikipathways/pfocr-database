caption: (Left panel) In unstretched myocytes, Shp2 associates with and dephosphorylates
  FAK, inhibiting FAK activity. In response to a pathologic degree of cyclic stretch
  (15% above initial length), Shp2 dissociates from FAK, relieving this repression.
  Activated phosphorylated FAK then phosphorylates and activates the tyrosine kinase
  Src, and the activity of FAK and Src are necessary for the phosphorylation of Akt
  and TSC2. Akt phosphorylation of TSC2 relieves repression of the mTORC1 pathway,
  promoting protein synthesis and cell growth. (Right panel) Muscle-specific genetic
  deletion of Shp2 results in hyperactivation of RhoA/ROCK, and impaired ERK1/2 activation
  and cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload. ERK1/2 promotes and RhoA/ROCK
  inhibits cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. (Note that arrows in the figure do not necessarily
  indicate a direct relationship between proteins.)
