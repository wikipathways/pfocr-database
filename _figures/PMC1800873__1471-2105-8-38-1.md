caption: 'Progression pathway network with w = 0.8, ε = 0.8 and the LH algorithm.
  The methylation data analyzed here are from 86 primary breast cancers. A set of
  9 gene promoter CpG islands is investigated. The methylation statuses of the genes
  in each node are represented in a color-coded pie chart, with red signifying hypermethylation
  while green denoting lack of differential methylation. There are five phenotype
  measurements for each tumor. They are: age (1, age > 55; 2, age ≤ 55), ER/PR (1,
  +/+; 2, +/- or -/+; 3, -/-), histology (1, well-differentiated; 2, moderately-differentiated;
  3, poorly-differentiated), clinical stage (1, 2, 3, or 4), and metastasis status
  (0, M0; 1, M1). The phenotype center for each phenotype is listed above each node
  in the order described above. The pathway network presented here conforms to strict
  heritability and tumor phenotype progression.'
