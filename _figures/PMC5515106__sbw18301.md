  increased shedding from their membrane-bound form in BD, but blood leukocytes seem
  an unlikely source as TNF mRNA is downregulated in both disorders

caption: Elevated soluble plasma cytokine levels in SCZ and BD may be a result of
  increased shedding from their membrane-bound form in BD, but blood leukocytes seem
  an unlikely source as TNF mRNA is downregulated in both disorders. There are no
  strong indications of alterations in TNF-related signaling molecules in prefrontal
  cortex, however, soluble plasma cytokines can pass through the blood brain barrier,
  and differential expression of these molecules may occur in other regions of the
  brain. The increase in plasma cytokines may also be a result of heightened immune
  activity in other lymphatic tissues and organs as well as endothelial cells.
