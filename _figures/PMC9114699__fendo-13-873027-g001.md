caption: 'Molecular pathogenesis and therapeutic drug targets of thyroid cancer. The
  molecular pathogenesis of thyroid cancer mainly involves the imbalance of two classical
  signaling pathways: mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (right) and phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinase (PI3K)/Akt (left). Ras can transmit receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signals
  to these two pathways. Common mutations in MAPK pathway include RET-PTC and NTPK
  rearrangement, RAS and BRAF mutations. Common changes in PI3K pathway include RAS
  mutation, PTEN mutation or deletion, PIK3CA mutation or amplification and AKT1 mutation.
  Inhibitor drugs that block these signals are also depicted.'
