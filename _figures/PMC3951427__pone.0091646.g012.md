caption: 'A. In ccRCC, the most important biological functions of the top deregulated
  miRNAs were: 1) Cancer (p = 8.71E-11-4.91E-02); 2) Renal and Urological Disease
  (p = 8.71E-11-2.12E-09); 3) Inflammatory Disease (p = 2.12E-09-2.14E-03); 4) Inflammatory
  Response (p = 2.12E-09-2.4E-04) and 5) Reproductive System Disease (p = 3.37E-05-2.58E-02).
  The associated functions of the major miRNA network (score = 30) were: Inflammatory
  disease, inflammatory response, renal inflammation. Argonaute RISC catalytic component
  2 (EIF2C2), tumour protein p53 (TP53), v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog
  (MYC) and EPH receptor B6 (EPHB6) constituted some of the major central nodes in
  this network. B. In papRCC, the most important biological functions of the top deregulated
  miRNAs were: 1) Cancer (p = 9.4E-09-4.15E-02); 2) Endocrine System Disorders (p = 9.4E-09-4.54E-02);
  3) Reproductive System Disease (p = 9.4E-09-5.11E-03); 4) Inflammatory Disease (p = 2.17E-06-2.17E-06)
  and 5) Inflammatory Response (p = 2.17E-06-1.65E-03). The associated functions of
  the major miRNA network (score = 22) were: Endocrine System Disorders, Reproductive
  System Disease, Cellular Development. Tumour protein p53 (TP53) and EPH receptor
  B6 (EPHB6) constituted some of the major central nodes in this network. C. In chRCC,
  the most important biological functions of the top deregulated miRNAs were: 1) Cancer
  (p = 8.99E-07-4.73E-02); 2) Inflammatory Disease (p = 1.64E-06-1.64E-06); 3) Inflammatory
  Response (p = 1.64E-06-1.19E-03); 4) Renal and Urological Disease (p = 1.64E-06-7.96E-03)
  and 5) Reproductive System Disease (p = 3.02E-04-2.39E-02). The associated functions
  of the major miRNA network (score = 22) were: Hereditary Disorder, Skeletal and
  Muscular Disorders, Developmental Disorder. Tumour protein p53 (TP53), B-cell CLL/lymphoma
  2 (BCL2) vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and v-myc myelocytomatosis
  viral oncogene homolog (MYC) constituted some of the major central nodes in this
  network. D. In UT-UC, the most important biological functions of the top deregulated
  miRNAs were: 1) Inflammatory Disease (p = 2.7E-12-3.42E-02); 2) Inflammatory Response
  (p = 2.7E-12-1.75E-05); 3) Renal and Urological Disease (p = 2.7E-12-3.35E-09);
  4) Cancer (p = 4.67E-10-4.53E-02) and 5) Reproductive System Disease (p = 3.82E-06-4.96E-02).
  The associated functions of the 2 major miRNA networks were: 1) Connective Tissue
  Disorders, Inflammatory Disease, Inflammatory Response (score = 25); and 2) Cancer,
  Reproductive System Disease, Renal and Urological Disease (score = 24). Insulin,
  hydrogen peroxide and ribosomal protein S15 (RPS15) constituted some of the major
  central nodes in the first network; whereas tumour protein p53 (TP53) constituted
  a central node in the second network.'
