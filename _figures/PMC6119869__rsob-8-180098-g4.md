caption: Mechanisms of resistance to SMO inhibitors. Three mechanisms of acquired
  resistance to SMO inhibitors have been identified in tumours, all of which result
  in downstream activation of the pathway. (a) Mutation of SMO in the drug-binding
  site leads to loss of inhibition. (b) Loss of SUFU leads to downstream activation
  of the pathway. (c) Amplification of GLI1, or GLI2, leads to increased expression
  and downstream activation of the HH pathway.
