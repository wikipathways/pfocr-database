caption: Hnf1 β regulates the transcription of several cystogenic genes including
  Pkhd1, the mouse orthologue of the principal ARPKD gene; Cys1, the gene mutated
  in the cpk model of ARPKD, and Kif12, a candidate modifier of the Cys1 cpk/cpk phenotype.
  Therefore, we propose that the four proteins encoded by Hnf1b, Cys1, Kif12, and
  Pkhd1 may define a functional complex that modulates the progression of recessive
  PKD (black font). This hypothesis is supported by the very high correlations among
  structural and developmental expression patterns of these four genes (). In addition,
  components of the recessive PKD-associated pathway may interact at different levels
  with functional components of ADPKD-associated pathways (white font). For example,
  HNF1β also regulates the expression of Pkd2, an ADPKD gene. Furthermore, genetic
  interaction studies suggest that abnormal Pkd1 expression sensitizes renal tubular
  cells to Pkhd1 defects [, ]. The latter interaction may physically occur within
  the primary apical cilium (shaded oval), where these proteins all co-localize. The
  proposed Kif12 modulating effect on Cys1 function is designated by dashed line,
  solid lines correspond to previously described relationships.
