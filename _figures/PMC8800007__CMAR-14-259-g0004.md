caption: Effect of PARP1 and Ku70-associated acetylation and deacetylation on NHEJ
  repair in cancer. Upon DSB damage, cisplatin-induced PARP1 acetylation activates
  NF-kB to promote chemo-resistance by enhancing NHEJ repair. Histone deacetylase
  inhibition (HDACi) and trichostatin A (TSA) may impair the NHEJ pathway by promoting
  PARP1 acetylation in leukemia cells. MORC2-mediated NAT10 acetylates PARP1 at K949
  to promote its own stability and PARylation, which further enhances NHEJ repair
  in colon, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. Furthermore, the interaction
  between Ku70 and Bax induces NHEJ repair, which may be inhibited by EGCG, CBP, and
  PCAF-mediated acetylation, and promoted by HDAC6-mediated deacetylation. SIRT1 and
  SIRT6 deacetylate Ku70 to promote NHEJ repair, and HDACi increases Ku70 acetylation
  to inhibit NHEJ repair.
