caption: Glucose-Sparing Effect in the brain and in the liver by Ketone Bodies. Ketone
  bodies (KBs) serve as an alternative energy source for the brain and the liver,
  thereby conserving glucose, which can be redirected to the pentose phosphate pathway
  allowing an increase in biosynthesis. In the liver, KBs inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis,
  reducing glucose production and lipolysis, while maintaining stable insulin and
  glucagon levels
