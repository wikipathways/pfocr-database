caption: 'Apoptosis occurs via two molecular pathways, extrinsic and intrinsic. The
  extrinsic pathway involves death ligand-induced activation of receptors, resulting
  in the formation of the death complex. The intrinsic pathway is activated by cellular
  stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. ER stress can induce apoptosis through JNK
  and CHOP, which activate the proapoptotic protein Bax, leading to mitochondrial
  dysfunction. Both apoptotic pathways activate intracellular proteases, the caspases,
  that cleave cell components in an organized way. The engulfment of the resulting
  apoptotic bodies by Kupffer cells promotes hepatic fibrosis and inflammation through
  the activation of stellate cells and the release of cytokines.CHOP: C/EBP homologous
  protein; Cyto c: Cytochrome c; ER: Endoplasmic reticulum; FasL: Fas ligand; PERK:
  PKR-like ER kinase; TRAIL: TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.'
