caption: 'The proteins/enzymes in this pathway regulate both calcification and atherosclerosis.
  ABCC6 activity facilitates the cellular efflux of ATP from liver and other tissues/cells,
  which is quickly converted to pyrophosphate (PPi), a potent inhibitor of mineralization.
  Decreased plasma PPi levels cause calcification in PXE (OMIM #264800) and GACI (OMIM
  #614473 and #208000). NT5E activity leads to adenosine production which has numerous
  biological activities towards inflammation, atherosclerosis and inhibition of TNAP
  synthesis. TNAP degrades PPi into inorganic phosphate (Pi), an activator of calcification
  which leads to vascular calcification in Calcification of Joints and Arteries patients
  (CALJA, OMIM #211800). In addition to ABCC6, both ENPP1 and NT5E functions have
  been linked to atherosclerosis development in ApoE−/− mice. ENTPD1 function overlaps
  with that of ENPP1 and also plays a role in atherosclerosis in mice lacking ApoE,
  though this ectoenzyme does not seem to regulate ectopic calcification. Symbols:
  ∅ : no known effect; ➚: increase; ➘: decrease.'
