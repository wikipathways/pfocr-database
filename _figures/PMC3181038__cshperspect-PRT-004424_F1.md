caption: 'Signaling the unfolded protein response: Three proximal sensors IRE1, PERK,
  and ATF6 regulate the UPR through their respective signaling cascades. Under nonstressed
  conditions, BiP binds to the lumenal domains of IRE1 and PERK to prevent their dimerization.
  On accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, IRE1 released from BiP, dimerizes
  to activate its kinase and RNase activities to initiate XBP1 mRNA splicing, thereby
  creating a potent transcriptional activator. Primary targets that require IRE1/XBP1
  pathway for induction include genes encoding functions in ERAD. Similarly, ATF6
  released from BiP transits to the Golgi compartment for cleavage by S1P and S2P
  proteases to yield a cytosolic fragment that migrates to the nucleus to further
  activate transcription of UPR-responsive genes. Finally, PERK released from BiP
  dimerizes, autophosphorylates, and phosphorylates eIF2α on Ser 51 leading to general
  attenuation of translational initiation. Paradoxically, eIF2α phosphorylation induces
  translation of ATF4 mRNA. The PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 regulatory axis also induces expression
  of anti-oxidative stress response genes and expression of genes encoding proteins
  with proapoptotic functions, such as CHOP.'
