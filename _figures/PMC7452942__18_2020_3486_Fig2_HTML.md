caption: Soluble protein sensors built by means of bottom-up approaches. a VEGF (vascular
  endothelial growth factor) sensor based on MESA (modular extracellular sensor architecture).
  Binding of dimeric VEGF induces dimerization of the hetero receptors, which results
  in trans-cleavage and release of a transcription factor (TF) from the plasma membrane.
  TF binds to the transcription factor-binding domain (TFBD) and induces transgene
  expression. b GEMS (generalized extracellular sensor) platform to sense various
  molecules. The affinity domains connected to the Epo receptor (EPOR) scaffold dimerize
  upon addition of input molecules. The affinity domains can be various proteins including,
  but not limited to, FKBP and FRB (for sensing rapamycin), camelid heavy chain antibody
  A52 (for sensing an azo dye RR120), heavy chain and light chain of the variable
  chain of nicotine antibody (for sensing nicotine, fused separately in the receptor
  for heterodimeric receptors based on nicotine-induced stabilization of the heavy
  and light chain interaction), and two different scFvs to distinct epitopes of prostate-specific
  antigen (PSA). Upon dimerization of the extracellular domain, the orientation of
  the intracellular domain changes, triggering downstream signaling pathways. Different
  kinds of intracellular domains, such as those of IL-6RB, VEGFR2, and FGR1, can be
  used to activate corresponding downstream signaling pathways (JAK-STAT pathway,
  PI3K/Akt (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B; induced by VEGFR2) pathway,
  PLCG (phospholipase C gamma) pathway, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway),
  which can be rewired to transgene expression from inducible promoters. c Chimeric
  antigen receptor (CAR) engineered to sense soluble TGF-β (tumor growth factor-β).
  CAR contains an extracellular scFv (single-chain variable fragment) that binds to
  TGF-β and is linked to the CD28 and CD3ζ endodomains. Upon sensing dimeric soluble
  TGF-β, CAR dimerizes, and downstream T-cell signaling is triggered
