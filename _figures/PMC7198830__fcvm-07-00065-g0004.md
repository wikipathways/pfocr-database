caption: Emerging roles of high density lipoprotein (HDL) in cancer and cancer therapy
  associated cardiotoxicity from preclinical studies. HDL induces cardioprotective
  effects in cardiomyocytes via SR-B1 receptor and activation of PI3K-Akt pathway
  as well as via S1P2 receptor leading activation of STAT3-JAK-ERK1/2 pathway (, ).
  rHDL used as a drug delivery system may allow for targeted delivery to at least
  some types of tumors, sparing cardiomyocytes (, ). Furthermore, the major apoliprotein
  of HDL (ApoA1) directly attenuates tumor growth and metastasis in preclinical models
  (). These pathways are not necessarily muatually exclusive.
