caption: Schematic representation of the HCV-dysregulated hepatic gluconeogenesis
  signaling pathway. HCV induces mitochondrial dysfunction (). This results in increased
  ROS production and JNK activation, which induces the nuclear accumulation of FoxO1
  by reducing its phosphorylation status. Consequently, PEPCK and G6Pase gene expressions
  are upregulated, leading to an upregulation of G6P and glucose production. NS5A
  plays a role in HCV-induced gluconeogenesis via the induction of ROS production.
  IRE, insulin response element.
