caption: The interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3)-induced acquired
  tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance mechanism represented in a schematic
  diagram. In patients resistant to sunitinib, overexpression of IFITM3 is observed.
  The binding of IFITM3 to TRAF6 leads to the activation of TRAF6 associated with
  IRAK1, which induces oncogenic signaling pathways, including MAPK/AP-1 pathways.
  As a result, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) can accelerate tumor growth,
  survival, and proliferation despite TKI treatment
