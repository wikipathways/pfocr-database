caption: 'The underlying protective mechanism of EOs against oxidative damage induced
  by chemical overexposure. (1) Mitochondrial Protection: EOs suppress the expression
  of P53 and Bax, and upregulate Bcl-2 expression, thereby preventing mitochondrial
  dysfunction and reducing cellular damage. (2) Autophagy Modulation: Certain EOs
  activate autophagy via the p53 signaling pathway, leading to the upregulation of
  hepatic LC3-Ⅱ, which facilitates the clearance of necrotic cells. Conversely, other
  EOs inhibit autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway and p62, promoting liver cell
  survival under stress conditions. (3) Antioxidant gene transcription: EOs enhance
  the expression of anti-oxidative genes such as HO-1 through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2
  or Smad2/NF-κB p65 pathways, thereby leading to increase in SOD, CAT, GPX, GR, GST,
  GSH, GCL and decrease in MDA, LP, FRAP, ALT, ALP, AST, AOPP, HYP, PC, γ-GT, and
  MPO. (4) Anti-inflammatory Effects: EOs modulate signaling pathways to suppress
  the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α, thereby inhibiting inflammation. (5) Alleviating
  cellular damage: through the combined effects of the above factors, DNA damage,
  lipid peroxidation, and protein damage are reduced, ultimately alleviating cellular
  damage. (6) Alleviating tissue damage: All the mechanisms work together to mitigate
  tissue injury and maintain both its structural integrity and functional capacity.
