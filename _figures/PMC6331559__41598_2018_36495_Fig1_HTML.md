caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of longifolene in this study. Enzymes involved in the
  MEP pathway includes: Dxs, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase; Dxr, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate reductoisomerase; IspD, 4-pyrophosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  synthase; IspE, 4-pyrophosphocytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol kinase; IspF, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  2,4-cyclopyrophosphate synthase; IspG, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl pyrophosphate
  synthase; IspH, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-butenyl 4-pyrophosphate reductase. Enzymes involved
  in the MVA pathway includes: MvaE, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase/HMG-CoA reductase;
  MvaS, HMG-CoA synthase; MK, mevalonate kinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; MVD,
  mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase; IDI, IPP isomerase; FPPS, farnesyl pyrophosphate
  synthase; LgfS, longifolene synthase. Reactions responsible for NADPH, ferredoxin
  (Fd) and ATP consumption are indicated.'
