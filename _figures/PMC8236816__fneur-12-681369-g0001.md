caption: The roles of PD-associated proteins in endolysosomal pathways responsible
  for α-synuclein degradation. Extracellular and intracellular α-synuclein species
  (both soluble and aggregated) are transported into lysosomes for degradation through
  several pathways, including endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy. PD-associated
  proteins VPS35, LRRK2, and Rab29 influence multiple steps of these degradation pathways,
  both individually and cooperatively. The retromer complex component VPS35 regulates
  the recycling of cathepsin D (CATD), the main lysosomal hydrolase responsible for
  α-synuclein degradation, by retrieving the lysosomal hydrolase receptor CI-MPR from
  endosome to the TGN. VPS35 pathogenic mutation may affect the recycling of CATD
  and thus impair α-synuclein degradation. LRRK2 and Rab29 further interact with VPS35
  and regulate its function cooperatively. In endocytosis pathway, LRRK2 regulates
  AP-3-mediated intracellular recycling of lysosomal membrane proteins, whereas LRRK2
  modulates the phagocytic activity by interacting with actin-cytoskeletal regulator
  WAVE2. VPS35 has been shown to function in macroautophagy pathway together with
  its interactors WASH complex and ATG9a, thereby regulating the transport of LC3-positive
  compartments. LRRK2 also regulates the autophagic flux, and ATP13A2 influences the
  clearance of autophagosomes. The perturbation of macroautophagy pathway is thought
  to contribute to the impaired degradation of α-synuclein, especially those of aggregated
  species.
