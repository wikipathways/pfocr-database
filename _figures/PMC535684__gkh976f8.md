caption: Models for drug-induced repeat deletion. Left panel. (A) Replication restart.
  DNA damage within a (CAG)n tract in the leading template strand, indicated by the
  asterisk, may cause DNA synthesis arrest and replication fork collapse. The dark
  thick region represents a (CTG)n tract, while the lighter thick region represents
  the complementary (CAG)n strand. Steps a–i are based on the understanding of the
  pathway for replication fork restart that involves a double-strand break. This pathway
  appears to be a major source of spontaneous deletion in E.coli (,). Following fork
  collapse (b and c), fork reversal forms a ‘chicken-foot’ structure (d). If cleaved
  by a Holliday junction resolvase (at the arrows), a double-strand break ensues (e).
  End resection by a nuclease will lead to a single-strand 3′ end (f), which can initiate
  homologous strand invasion. During this process, misalignment can occur resulting
  in a (CAG)n hairpin (g). Branch migration will generate a Holliday junction (h),
  the resolution of which will restore the replication fork (i). Repeat deletion can
  occur at the point of misalignment at strand invasion or during synthesis of the
  restored lagging strand, in which the (CTG)n tract may form a stable hairpin. Right
  panel, following the introduction of a DNA damage within the repeat, two DNA repair
  pathways could lead to repeat deletion. (B) Repair involving a gap. An excision
  repair pathway may open up a gap (c) in which a (CTG)n [or (CAG)n] hairpin may form
  (d). Slipped misalignment with DNA replication would lead to repeat deletion in
  the nascent strand (e). Excision of the loop or a subsequent round of replication
  would lead to repeat deletion. (C) Double-strand break repair. A pathway involving
  a double-strand break within the repeat (c) may also lead to repeat deletion. Following
  end resection to generate complementary single strands (d), homologous pairing could
  occur with flaps (e) that, on removal and ligation, would lead to repair with deletion
  (f).
