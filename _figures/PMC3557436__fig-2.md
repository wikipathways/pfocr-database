caption: 'Interaction of gallium with cellular iron metabolism. The potential sites
  of gallium''s interaction with cellular iron metabolism are identified in the bordered
  boxes. Membrane transport: TfR mediated. In the circulation, gallium(III) is transported
  and bound to Tf as Tf-Ga and is incorporated into TfR1-expressing cells by TfR1-mediated
  endocytosis of Tf-Ga complexes. Tf-Ga inhibits cellular iron incorporation by interfering
  with TfR-mediated uptake of Tf-Fe and the release of Fe from Tf within the endosome.
  Non-TfR mediated. Low-molecular-weight gallium and iron chelates in the circulation
  may also be taken up by certain cells through a shared Tf-independent pathway. In
  this pathway, gallium may enhance cellular iron uptake and vice versa. In cells,
  gallium can be detected in a low-molecular-weight pool. TfR1 and ferritin mRNA translation:
  Consistent with the induction of cellular iron deprivation, cells exposed to gallium
  display an increase in TfR1 mRNA and protein. This results from an increase in IRP-IRE
  mRNA interaction that leads to increased TfR mRNA translation. RR: Gallium blocks
  iron incorporation into the R2 subunit and may itself be incorporated into this
  subunit, rendering it inactive. Gallium also blocks RR enzyme activity more directly
  through competitive inhibition of substrate binding. This could result from the
  formation of Ga-ADP/CDP complexes that compete with (Fe)-ADP/CDP binding to the
  enzyme. The inhibition of RR activity contributes to gallium-induced cell death.
  Iron-dependent mitochondrial function: Gallium may perturb mitochondrial function
  by action on the numerous iron-containing proteins present in the citric acid cycle
  and the electron transport chain (shown in ). Upstream from the mitochondrion (mito),
  gallium may activate proapoptotic Bax, which translocates to the mitochondria, produces
  a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the release of cytochrome c and
  apoptogenic factors to the cytoplasm. This triggers the activation of effector caspases-3
  and -7, leading to apoptotic cell death. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; CDP, cytidine
  diphosphate.'
