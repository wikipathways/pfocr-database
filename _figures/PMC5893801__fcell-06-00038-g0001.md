caption: Potential therapeutic strategies to enhance immune checkpoint inhibitors
  by targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). (A) Cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cell
  in the tumors is suppressed by immune checkpoint pathways activated by cancer cells
  and TAM. TAM also suppresses CD8+ T cell functions via checkpoint pathway independent
  mechanisms that are still under investigation. (B) Blockade of immune checkpoint
  pathway by antibodies for CTLA4, PD1, and PD-L1 enhances CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity.
  However, immune suppressive tumor microenvironment, especially TAM in it, will limit
  the anti-tumor efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitors. (C) Therapeutic efficacy of
  checkpoint inhibitors can be improved by TAM targeting through different strategies,
  i.e., TAM depletion (left), TAM reprogramming (central), and targeting functional
  molecules of TAM (right). MΦ means macrophage.
