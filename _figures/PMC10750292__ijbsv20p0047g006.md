caption: Illustration of the crosstalk between APLNR palmitoylation and neuropathic
  cancer pain (NCP). During the occurrence and development of NCP, the expression
  of palmityltransferase ZDHHC9 increased, and palmitylated APLNR promoted its stability.
  The use of morphine can lead to the accumulation of the metabolite M3G in vivo,
  activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway through APLNR, leading to the activation
  of microglia, release of inflammatory factors and, finally, formation of morphine
  tolerance.
