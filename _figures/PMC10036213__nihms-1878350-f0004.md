caption: '(a) Left: cGAS binds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) via its positively charged
  N-terminal IDR and its C-terminal nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) domain, which also
  mediates cGAS dimerization. These multivalent interactions rapidly nucleate the
  formation of cGAS:dsDNA condensates, dramatically lowering the concentration threshold
  for cGAS activation and leading to ultrasensitive dsDNA detection and cGAMP production.
  Right: However, excess cGAMP production has been shown to trigger LLPS of the ER-resident
  cGAMP receptor STING, which requires interactions mediated by the C-terminal IDRs
  in STING dimers and forms condensates containing intricately folded membrane networks.
  Because LLPS requires cGAMP-bound STING, these condensates may function to buffer
  excess cGAMP and regulate immune signaling. (b) Left: The formation of PKA-RIα biomolecular
  condensates requires the docking and dimerization (D/D) domain and a disordered
  linker region containing an inhibitory site (IS) that binds the PKA-C subunit. The
  binding of cAMP to RIα triggers a conformational rearrangement in the PKA holoenzyme
  that exposes the disordered linker to help drive LLPS, though the precise molecular
  mechanism remains unclear. Right: RIα condensates dynamically buffer cAMP levels,
  allowing PDEs to efficiently degrade free cAMP and act as cAMP sinks. In the absence
  of RIα condensates, PDEs catalytic activity is overwhelmed, resulting in the collapse
  of cAMP sinks and the breakdown of compartmentalized cAMP signaling.'
