caption: Model for cellular regulation upon CaCl2 stress. High concentration of CaCl2
  activates Puf1p and Puf2p proteins. These maintain low levels of Zeo1 mRNA, most
  likely by inducing its degradation. Thus, Zeo1 protein levels are low and its known
  repressive effect on the Cell Wall Integrity (CWI) pathway is excluded. This permits
  proper transcriptional response to the stress. In strains deleted of Puf1p and Puf2p
  (right panel), Zeo1 mRNA levels are high, hence an increase in Zeo1 protein levels
  and inhibition of the CWI pathway. This leads to improper transcriptional response
  and the observed growth defect.
