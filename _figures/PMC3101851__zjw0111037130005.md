caption: Unique glucose metabolic characteristics in GCC may have potential as targets
  for cancer therapy. A, the fingerprint map of the glucose metabolic network in GCC
  highlighting those enzymes and metabolic intermediates that are dysregulated. B,
  normal cells preferred the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) compared
  with anaerobic respiration. This favored pathway is controlled by the high activity
  of PDH and relatively low activity of LDH (left). GCC cells not only favor glycolysis
  by up-regulating the enzymes involved but also strongly prefer anaerobic respiration
  with production of prominent lactic acids rather than the Krebs cycle and oxidative
  phosphorylation because of activating LDH and suppressing PDH (middle). This divergence
  between GCC and normal tissues will give us new therapeutic opportunities (right).
  GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; Lac, lactic acid; Pyr, pyruvate.
