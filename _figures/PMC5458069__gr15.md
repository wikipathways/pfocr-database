caption: Cysteine supply pathways in astrocytes. Cysteine is either taken up in its
  oxidized form, cystine, from the extracellular medium via the xc- cystine-glutamate
  exchanger, or generated from methionine via the transsulfuration pathway. Cysteine
  is the immediate precursor for GSH, which is synthesized by the first two enzymes
  of the γ-glutamyl cycle, as well as taurine and hydrogen sulpfide. CBS, cystathionine-β-synthase;
  CDO, cysteine dioxygenase; CSA, cysteine sulfinic acid; CSE, cystathionine-γ-lyase;
  GCS, glutamate cysteine ligase; GS, glutathione synthase; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  SAM, S-adenosylmethionine.
