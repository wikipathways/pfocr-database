caption: The kynurenine pathway. TRP is converted to KYN by the enzymes IDO and TDO,
  as reflected by KTR. The KTR increases in response to inflammation, particularly
  through IFN-γ, which also increases neopterin, a pteridine. KYN can be further degraded
  into KA, 3-HK and AA by, respectively, the enzymes kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT),
  kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) and kynureninase (KYNU); 3-HAA and XA can be synthesised
  from 3-HK, QA and picolinic acid (PIC) from 3-HAA and, finally, QA is synthesised
  into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Riboflavin and PLP, active forms
  of, respectively, vitamin B2 and vitamin B6 are cofactors of enzymes of the kynurenine
  pathway
