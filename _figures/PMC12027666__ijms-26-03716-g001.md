caption: Sphingolipid synthesis pathways. Schematic illustration of sphingolipid synthesis
  showing that SLs can be formed via de novo synthesis in endoplasmic reticulum through
  a cascade of enzyme-catalyzed reactions or through the breakdown of glycosylceramides
  or sphingomyelins in the salvage pathway. Ceramides play a central role in the sphingolipid
  metabolism and are modified to form more complex sphingolipids. Tumor-suppressing
  and tumor-promoting functions are indicated with green and red arrows, respectively.
  Sphingolipids (SLs); GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase;
