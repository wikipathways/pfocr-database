caption: The asparagine biosynthesis pathway. See Figure 2 for description. Both ASN1
  and ASN2 are correlated with AAT2 but are anti-correlated with AAT1 (selected pairwise
  similarities are shown). The later is localized to a different cellular compartment
  than the others, and is likely to be involved in other pathways (see text for details).
