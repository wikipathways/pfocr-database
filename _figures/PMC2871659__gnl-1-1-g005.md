caption: Wnt signaling pathway is regulated by SFRPs, epigenetic gatekeepers and APC;
  a genetic gatekeeper. In normal colon epithelial cells, secreted frizzled related
  proteins (SFRPs) inhibit Wnt signaling by competing with Wnt ligand for binding
  to their receptor, Frizzled (FRZ). In cancer cells, however, methylation of CpG
  islands of the promoters of SFRPs inhibits their transcription causing the Wnt signaling
  pathway to become active. Thus, SFRPs function as an epigenetic gatekeeper. When
  Wnt signaling is inactive in normal colon epithelial cells, the APC complex phosphorylates
  β-catenin leading to its degradation preventing the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin
  and its binding to Lef/Tcf HMG box transcription factors. These events result in
  the differentiation and homeostasis of colonic epithelial cells. In cancer cells,
  mutated APC allow unphosphorylated β-catenin to translocate to nucleus and activate
  transcription of genes that promote cell proliferation and survival. Therefore,
  APC expression functions as a genetic gatekeeper.
