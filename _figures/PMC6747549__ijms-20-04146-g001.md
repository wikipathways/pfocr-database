caption: 'Schematic summary of the molecular pathways of F. nucleatum in CRC tumorigenesis.
  F. nucleatum mediates its oncogenic properties through three major components: the
  Fap2, and FadA molecules along with the LPS. LPS can interact with TLRs (namely
  TLR2 or TLR4), activating the MyD88 and NF-κΒ pathway. This interaction leads to
  reduced caspase activity and increased autophagy, resulting in reduced apoptosis.
  Furthermore, FadA binds to E-cadherin, causing dephosphorylation and activation
  of β-catenin. NF-κΒ and β-catenin alter the gene expression, increasing the synthesis
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, TNF-α) and upregulating
  oncogenic pathways of Cmyc/CyclinD and miR-21. The pro-inflammatory state is further
  enhanced by the binding of Fap2 to Gal-GalNAc. Additionally, the interaction of
  LPS with the TIGIT receptor of NK and T cells leads to suppression of anti-tumor
  immunity. Eventually, these events create inflammation which impairs DNA, promotes
  cell proliferation and results in CRC tumorigenesis. CRC: colorectal cancer; Gal-GalNAc:
  D-galactose-β(1–3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine; IL: interleukin, LPS: lipopolysaccharide;
  miR: microRNA: NF-κΒ: nuclear factor kappa-beta; NK: natural-killer; TIGIT: T-cell
  immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain; TLR: toll-like
  receptor; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Upward red arrows: enhancement/stimulation;
  Downward red arrows: reduction.'
