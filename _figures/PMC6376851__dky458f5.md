caption: Proposed pathway associated with K. pneumoniae polymyxin and octapeptin C4
  resistance observed in this study. (a) To facilitate resistance to polymyxins, genomic
  variations are acquired in TCSs. These encompass CrrAB, QseBC, PmrAB and PhoPQ with
  MgrB acting as a negative repressor. Once this pathway is activated during resistance,
  sensor histidine kinases (CrrB, QseC, PmrB and PhoQ) will phosphorylate response
  regulators (CrrA, QseB, PmrA and PhoP) and allow for the expression of target genes
  [crrC, unknown (?), pmrD and pmrHFIJKLM]. Disruptions in MgrB allow for the up-regulation
  of this pathway resulting in the expression of pmrHFIJKLM, which allows for Ara4N
  to be attached to phosphate groups on lipid A. The pEtN lipid A modification, facilitated
  via the pmrCAB operon, was not observed in this study. (b) The major disruptions
  identified during octapeptin C4 resistance were in the Mla and Pqi pathway. OmpC
  removes PLs from the outer membrane and transfers these to MlaA. PLs are transported
  across the periplasm via MlaC and transported to the MlaBDEF complex where the subsequent
  fate of PLs is unknown. An unknown porin complexes with PqiC to transport metabolites
  and potentially PLs across the periplasm via the PqiAB complex. Mutations in these
  pathways elevate the octapeptin C4 MIC and subsequently hydroxymyristate and palmitoylate
  are added to lipid A to potentially stabilize the outer membrane. This figure appears
  in colour in the online version of JAC and in black and white in the print version
  of JAC.
