caption: An “integrator” role for Smad3 in the maintenance of chronic myelogenous
  leukemia (CML) stemness. Smad3 participates in nutrient-activated p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling that supports CML stem cell self-renewal and in
  TGF-β signaling that supports CML stem cell quiescence. The nutrient-activated p38
  MAPK pathway phosphorylates Ser208 in the Smad3 linker region. Activated TβRI kinase
  phosphorylates Smad3 at the carboxy-terminal two-serine residues, which then controls
  stem-cell quiescence. CML stem cells show Smad3 phosphorylation at Ser208 in the
  linker region and at the carboxy-terminal serines. Posttranslational modification
  of Smad3 therefore integrates two intracellular pathways to regulate the self-renewal
  capacity and resistance of CML stem cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Because
  nutrient-activated p38 MAPK–Smad3 signaling does not occur in normal hematopoietic
  stem cells (HSCs), inhibitors targeting this nutrient pathway might provide clinical
  benefits for CML patients.
