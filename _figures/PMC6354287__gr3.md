caption: The molecular mechanism of S1P signaling via its receptors. Extracellular
  molecules, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and S1P itself,
  can induce intracellular signaling that leads to the activation of kinases that
  phosphorylate Sphk1. S1P is subsequently generated following phosphorylation of
  Sphk, and S1P localizes to the cell membrane from the cytosol to convert sphingosine
  to S1P via phosphorylation events. S1P1 is linked to Gi and is a potent activator
  of the Rac signaling pathway, while S1P2 and S1P3 are linked to G12/13 and activate
  the Rho signaling pathway.
