caption: 'Cerebral CYP enzymes in major endogenous substance metabolism. (A) Cholesterol
  metabolism: Overview of key steps in the conversion of cholesterol and its derivatives
  mediated by cerebral CYP enzymes, highlighting pathways involved in neurosteroid
  synthesis and oxysterol production. Cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone by
  CYP11A1, while CYP46A1 catalyzes the production of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, and CYP27A1
  converts cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol. (B) Polyunsaturated fatty acid
  metabolism: Representation of major pathways catalyzed by cerebral CYP enzymes in
  the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). CYP epoxygenase converts
  arachidonic acid into 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, which is further metabolized
  into 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid by epoxide hydrolase. Additionally, CYP
  ω-hydroxylase facilitates the formation of hydroxylated derivatives, such as 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid and 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid'
