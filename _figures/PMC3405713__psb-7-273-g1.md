caption: Figure 1. Control of BiP phosphorylation by the TOR pathway and ER stress
  in Chlamydomonas. Phosphorylation occurs at a conserved region within the peptide-binding
  domain (PBD) of BiP and is associated to an inactive state of the protein that can
  be efficiently converted into an active, dephosphorylated form in response to increased
  protein synthesis or specific ER stress. Regulation of BiP function by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
  events is therefore coordinated with nutritional and environmental inputs via the
  TOR pathway and ER stress signaling components.
