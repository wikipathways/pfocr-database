caption: General signaling cascades responsible for downstream activation of TLRs.
  Activation of TLRs activates the NFκB pathway triggering expression and production
  of inflammatory cytokines and interferons. Activated cells also up-regulate the
  expression of MHCI/II, CD80/86 and CD40. MyD88 is the predominant adaptor protein
  between TLR activation and inflammatory cytokines. TRIF is the other major adaptor
  protein. Many synergies occur through the simultaneous activation of both pathways.
