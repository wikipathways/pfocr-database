caption: Quantified levels of metabolites produced by the pentose phosphate pathway,

  levels of metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism. Average metabolite
  concentrations (nmol/g DNA) in organoids treated with E7386 at concentrations of
  0, 30 and 100 nM superimposed onto a metabolic pathway map. Pathways included glycolysis,
  pentose phosphate and the Kreb's cycle pathways. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001.
