caption: 'Illustration of main mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance (in red) and targeted
  agents to circumvent resistance (in blue). Truncated HER-2 expression prevents binding
  of trastuzumab. Alternative signaling, such as through HER-3, can lead to continued
  downstream signaling. The PI3K–AKT pathway can be constitutively activated through
  loss of PTEN or PIK3CA mutations. Lapatinib inhibits downstream signaling of HER-2
  and p95HER-2. T-DM1 provides additional cytotoxic activity. HSP90 inhibitors, such
  as tanespimycin, lead to degradation of p95HER-2. Pertuzumab prevents dimerization
  of HER-2 and HER-3. Cixutumumab inhibits IGF-1R. Everolimus is a mTORC1 inhibitor.
  Other investigational agents in early clinical development are also shown in italics.Abbreviations:
