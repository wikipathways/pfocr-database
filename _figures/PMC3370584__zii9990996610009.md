caption: Model of the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production
  by MAPKs in THP-1 cells. After retrotranslocation of the Stx A1 fragment (purple
  circle) across the ER membrane, depurination of a single adenine in the 28S rRNA
  ribosomal subunit (blue circles) may lead to a conformational change that allows
  PKR and possibly other kinases to bind the ribosome. ERK, p38, and JNK MAPKs are
  activated, resulting in differential regulation of cytokine and chemokine expression.
  ERK and p38 activation is negatively regulated by DUSP1, while DUSP1 mRNA expression
  is regulated by p38 MAPKs, creating an autoregulatory loop. Asterisks denote statistical
  significance. (Adapted from reference  with permission of the publisher, John Wiley
