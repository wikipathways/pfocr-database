caption: SLN1 pathway organization and regulation. (a) Schematic showing flow of phosphoryl
  groups through the SLN1 pathway. Plasma membrane associated Sln1 kinase is autophosphorylated
  on the H576 residue under normal growth conditions. Hyper-activation occurs under
  conditions causing weakening of the cell wall (wall stress). Hyperosmolarity and
  other conditions causing reduced turgor lead to a reduction in Sln1 kinase activity
  and accumulation of Sln1 in the dephosphorylated form. The phosphoryl group on H576
  (H) is transferred to D1144 (D) in the receiver domain of Sln1 and then to H64 of
  the phosphotransferase, Ypd1, and finally to D554 and D427 in the receiver domains
  of the Ssk1 and Skn7 response regulators, respectively. When Ssk1 is unphosphorylated
  it interacts with and stimulates the activity of the Ssk2 and Ssk22 MAPKKKs of the
  HOG1 pathway. Phosphorylation of Ssk1 renders it inactive with respect to the HOG1
  pathway. Phosphorylation of Skn7 leads to activation of SKN7 dependent genes such
  as the mannosyltransferase, OCH1. (b) Schematic depicting the domain structure of
  Sln1. Two molecules of a Sln1 dimer are shown associated with the plasma membrane
  via two transmembrane domains (TMDs). An extensive extracellular domain (ECD) protrudes
  into the periplasmic space. This protein configuration is conducive to detection
  of changes in pressure against the membrane (turgor pressure) and changes in composition
  of the cell wall which may lead to altered rigidity. The stimulus is transduced
  through several juxtamembrane domains including a coiled-coil domain (CC) which
  appears to be contiguous with the phosphoaccepting H576 residue. Rotation of the
  coiled-coil domain in response to a stimulus is thought to regulate access of H576
  to the kinase domain (HK) and hence the level of kinase phosphorylation. The structure
  of the Thermotoga maritima TM0853 HK domain (PDB ID 2C2A) ()is depicted here. Transfer
  of the H576 phosphoryl group to the receiver domain (Rec) is a prerequisite for
  subsequent phosphotransfer to Ypd1 and the response regulators Ssk1 and Skn7 (not
  shown). The structure of the Sln1-Rec domain is shown here (PDB ID 2R25) ()and the
  dashed lines represent linker regions of unknown structure. (c) Several types of
  regulation are embodied in the Sln1 pathway. (1) The Sln1 kinase itself is positively
  regulated by changes in the cell wall structure, and negatively regulated by hyper-osmolarity
  and other situations leading to reduced turgor. (2) The HOG1 pathway is positively
  regulated by an inactive SLN1 pathway. Only the dephosphorylated form of the Ssk1
  response regulator stimulates the Ssk2 and Ssk22 MAPKKKs of the HOG1 pathway. Finally,
  (3) the HOG1 pathway is inactivated and Skn7 is activated by the phosphorylated
  SLN1 pathway intermediates.
