caption: Mechanisms of autophagy initiation regulated by AMPK and mTORC1. AMPK, as
  a sensor of energy deficiency, plays a critical role in initiating autophagy by
  phosphorylating key regulators involved in autophagy and mTORC1 signaling pathways.
  Under low energy or nutrient-deficient conditions, AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 (in
  the TSC1/TSC2 complex), Raptor, and Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), each triggering
  downstream reactions that promote autophagy. AMPK phosphorylates TSC2, a GTPase-activating
  protein (GAP) for Rheb. This phosphorylation inhibits Rheb by converting it from
  its active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound form, reducing mTORC1 activity,
  which normally inhibits autophagy. AMPK phosphorylates regulatory-associated protein
  of mTOR complex (Raptor), an essential regulatory component of mTORC1, thereby inhibiting
  mTORC1 function. Reduced mTORC1 activity promotes autophagy by allowing ULK1 activation.
  AMPK directly phosphorylates ULK1, which serves dual roles—either restraining the
  overactivation of autophagy or stimulating the downstream autophagy machinery. Phosphorylation
  of ULK1 by AMPK promotes the initiation of autophagy in response to nutrient deficiency.
  These interconnections illustrate how AMPK, by sensing low energy levels, suppresses
  mTORC1, and promotes the activation of the autophagy machinery, ensuring cellular
  homeostasis under stress conditions. AMP-activated Protein Kinase, AMPK; Mammalian
