caption: The inhibitory of melatonin on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. When ER
  stress occurs, GRP78 is separated from PERK, ATF6, and IRE1α, which activates three
  signal pathways and leads to increased levels of downstream molecules, including
  p‐elf2α, p‐ATF4, CHOP, p‐IRE1α, p‐JNK, and cleaved caspase 12, which eventually
  leads to cell apoptosis. Melatonin activates Sirt1, which is inhibited by hyperglycemia
  in cardiomyocytes, and inhibits the PERK‐p‐elf2α‐ATF4‐CHOP signaling pathway, thus
  reducing ER stress and reducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis in diabetic patients. ATF‐6,
  activated transcription factor 6; IRE1α, inositol‐requiring protein‐1α; PERK, protein
  kinase RNA‐like endoplasmic reticulum kinase
