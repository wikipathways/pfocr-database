caption: Genus beta HPV E6 bind MAML1 to inhibit NOTCH signaling. A schematic of activated
  NOTCH signaling in the absence (A) and presence (B) of genus beta HPV E6. Upon activation
  of the NOTCH signaling pathway, proteolytic cleavage of NOTCH releases the NOTCH
  intracellular domain (ICD), which can translocate to the nucleus. It displaces transcriptional
  repressors and forms a transcriptionally active complex including NOTCH, MAML1,
  and RBP-J. Genus beta HPV E6 bind to an LxxLL motif present in the MAML1 C-terminus.
  The oncoprotein does not disrupt formation of the transcription complex but does
  inhibit NOTCH signaling.
