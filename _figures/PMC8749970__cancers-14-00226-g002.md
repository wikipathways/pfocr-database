caption: Polarization of tumor-associated macrophages. Macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor (M-CSF) and C–C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) drive the generation of monocytes
  in cancer. In response to IL-12 and SPON/α4β1 signaling, monocytes differentiate
  into macrophages with antitumor properties, which are classified as M1-like. On
  the other hand, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, the TGF-β/CTGF pathway, necrotic debris
  from tumor cells and immunoglobulins released by B cells facilitate the polarization
  of macrophages towards a M2-like phenotype with tumor promoting properties. M2-like
  macrophages drive tumor growth directly, through the release of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10,
  CCL18 and CCL20, and indirectly, via the suppression of cytotoxic cell populations,
  including CD8+ T cells and NK cells.
