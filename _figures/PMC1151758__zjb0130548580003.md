caption: Overview of prominent metabolic and medically relevant features of C. jeikeium
  K411 deduced from the complete genome sequence. Processes and relevant proteins
  associated primarily with carbohydrate metabolism (yellow), fatty acid metabolism
  (blue), iron and manganese uptake (orange), antibiotic efflux (green), and virulence
  (red) are indicated. Putative transport systems are shown within the cell membrane;
  the numbers in parentheses indicate the approximate numbers of each type. Structural
  elements of ABC transporters are depicted as circles for membrane-spanning permeases
  and diamonds for nucleotide-binding proteins; other transporters are drawn as ovals.
  Major metabolic pathways are shown in the center of the cell; the numbers in parentheses
  indicate the numbers of paralogous genes present in the C. jeikeium K411 genome.
  Prominent proteins most likely secreted by the machinery of the general secretory
  (sec) pathway are shown on the right, along with sortase (SrtA) processed proteins
  and a predicted collagen adhesin (CbpA), which are anchored to the cell wall. The
  putative membrane-damaging role of the predicted virulence factors, ensuring the
  availability of exogenous fatty acids for growth of C. jeikeium, is indicated.
