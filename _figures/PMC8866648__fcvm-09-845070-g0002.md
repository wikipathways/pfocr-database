caption: The differentiation signaling pathway of vascular progenitor cells. Vascular
  development and remodeling depend on many genes and are usually initiated by fluid
  shear stress which acts on the Notch signaling and closely associated with the vascular
  remodeling diseases. DKK3 induces ECs migration through Wnt-PCP signaling pathway,
  accelerating re-endothelialization, and reducing neointima formation. DKK3 can induce
  the differentiation of Sca-1+ progenitor cells and fibroblasts into VSMC by activating
  TGF-β/ATF6 signaling pathways.
