caption: 'Summary of the possible implication of R2R3‐MYB transcription factors in
  the regulatory mechanisms of the flavonoid pathway during grape development. The
  roles of VvMYBA2r, VvMYB5a, VvMYB5b, VvMYBPA1, VvMYBPA2, VvMYBPAR and VvMYBA1 were
  assigned according to gene expression levels during berry development together with
  functional characterization data presented in this article for VvMYBA2r, in Deluc
  et al. () for VvMYB5a, in Deluc et al. () for VvMYB5b, in Bogs et al. () for VvMYBPA1,
  in Terrier et al. () for VvMYBPA2, in Koyama et al. () for VvMYBPAR and in Walker
  et al. () for VvMYBA1. According to several previous studies, VvMYB5a, VvMYB5b,
  VvMYBPA1 and VvMYBPA2 appear to be particularly involved in the regulation of PA
  synthesis before veraison in seed and skin tissues. At veraison, PA synthesis is
  complete, and anthocyanin synthesis begins in pericarp cells where UFGT gene expression
  is specifically regulated by VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2r, whereas genes encoding enzymes
  of the general flavonoid pathway required for anthocyanidin synthesis appear to
  be regulated by VvMYB5b. Abbreviations are as follows: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia‐lyase;
  C4H, Cinnamate 4‐hydroxylase; 4CL, 4 coumarate: CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone‐3‐beta‐hydroxylase; F3’H, flavonoid 3′‐hydroxylase;
  F3’,5’H, flavonoid 3′5′‐hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4‐reductase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; LDOX,
  leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; UFGT, UDP glucose‐flavonoid 3‐O‐glucosyltransferase;
  OMT, O‐methyltransferase; SK, shikimate kinase; and DHD/SDH, 3‐dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate
  5‐dehydrogenase. The values, calculated as log2 gene expression levels throughout
  berry development, are represented as blue, green, yellow and red. The berry samples
  were harvested at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 95 days after anthesis (DAA).'
