caption: Probable metabolic pathway for the biosynthesis of 3-methylbutanal from l-leucine
  degradation by B. thermosphacta. All the genes encoding the necessary enzymes for
  the direct (dark line) and the indirect (gray line) pathways were present. Alcohol
  dehydrogenase was also present. BCAA refrers to branched-chain amino acids. *The
  kdcA gene is fragmented in B. thermosphacta CD 337. The underlined gene bkdAB is
  fragmented in BSAS1 3
papertitle: One complete and three draft genome sequences of four Brochothrix thermosphacta
  strains, CD 337, TAP 175, BSAS1 3 and EBP 3070.
