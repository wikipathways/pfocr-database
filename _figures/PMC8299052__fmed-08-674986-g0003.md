caption: mROS formation mediated by MCU-dependent calcium uptake. With the stimulation
  of oxidative stress, the elevated mCa2+ took up by MCU interrupts energy metabolism
  causing the generation of mROS while the mROS formation can impact the cell metabolic
  function in turn. mCa2+ increases the activity of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GPDH), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), and α-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase (α-KGDH) in the TCA cycle, thus promoting mROS production. mtNOS,
  activated by mCa2+, hampers the conduction of electron, making complexes I and III
  generate mROS. mPTP opening results in the rupture of the outer membrane and thus
  causing the release of cytochrome c. Overloaded mCa2+ has an effect on Ca2+-CL binding,
  inducing the reorganization of membrane components, which causes the high-rate generation
  of mROS at the ubiquinone level.
