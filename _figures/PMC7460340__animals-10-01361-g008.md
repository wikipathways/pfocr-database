caption: Proposed model for SPARCL1 regulation of bovine MDSC migration and differentiation
  through ITGB1. As an extracellular matrix protein, SPARCL1 interacts with the transmembrane
  receptor ITGB1 and regulates changes in the expression of adhesion-plaque-associated
  proteins, such as ITGB1, p-FAK, FAK, p-paxillin, paxillin, and vinculin to affect
  the formation of focal adhesions. The Cdc42 and Arp2/3 complex was also affected
  by SPARCL1 through ITGB1. Further, bovine MDSC migration was stimulated by SPARCL1,
  and cells gathered and apparently expressed MyoD to begin an early-stage differentiation.
