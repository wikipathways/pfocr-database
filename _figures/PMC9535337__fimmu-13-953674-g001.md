caption: 'Hypothesized role of complement in HS. Despite finding no evidence for the
  activation of complement in our study, complement proteins have several well-known
  functions which are likely to contribute to HS pathogenesis. This figure illustrates
  the mechanisms of activation and regulation of the complement cascade and outlines
  how it’s effector functions could fit into the pathogenesis of HS. The complement
  cascade can be activated by three different pathways: the classical, lectin and
  alternative pathway. The classical pathway is triggered by antibody-antigen complexes,
  cell particles and acute phase proteins binding to C1 (consisting of C1q, C1r, and
  C1s), and is therefore more likely to play a more prominent role in later stages
  of the diseases. Activation of the lectin pathway occurs through the binding of
  the complex of mannose-binding lectin or ficolins to PAMPs or DAMPs released from
  dilated and ruptured follicles and tunnels. Both pathways result in the activation
  of C4 and C2, to form the C3 convertase, C4b2a. The alternative pathway depends
  on constitutive spontaneous low-grade hydrolysis of C3, ultimately forming the alternative
  C3-convertase C3bBb. All pathways converge on the cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b.
  C3b forms a C5 convertase by combining with previous C3 convertases initiating the
  terminal complement pathway by cleaving of C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b forms a complex
  with C6 and C7, which is inserted in the cell membrane. Subsequently, C8 and multiple
  C9 molecules bind to this complex, resulting in a fully functional MAC (C5b-9) capable
  of lysing for example bacteria expelled from ruptured follicles and tunnels or direct
  attack on epithelial cells. C3a and C5a are potent anaphylatoxins resulting in increased
  vessel permeability and further attracting monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, mast
  cells and T cells (C5a) to the HS lesion. These cells are also capable of locally
  producing complement components. In addition, interaction of C3a with C3aR and C5a
  with C5aR1 induces macrophages to secrete HS associated pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  increases proliferation of T cells, and promotes Th1 and Th17 expansion, cell types
  that play prominent role in HS pathogenesis. In addition, regulatory T-cell generation
  and function are decreased by C3a and C5a (not shown in figure). Activation of neutrophils
  leads to the release of prostaglandins, reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species,
  and MMP-9. The latter potentially aiding the characteristic HS tissue destruction.
  Two therapies, vilobelimab and avacopan, aimed neutralizing C5a and blocking C5aR1
  respectively, have shown promising preliminary results in HS. Bacterial opsonization
  with (i)C3b facilitates phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils and has been
  shown to stimulate NETosis. Prominent NET formation found in chronic HS lesions
  could be contributing to further complement activation through for example MPO and
  cathepsin G depositions on extruded NETs which are able to respectively cleave C3
  and C5. Recognition of C3dg-coated bacteria by antigen-specific B-cell receptors
  and CR2 lower the threshold of B cell activation and promotes antibody production.
  Local secretion of antibodies may in turn aid activation of the classical pathway.
