caption: The Hedgehog signaling pathway. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway involves
  a series of inhibitory interactions between secreted ligands, cell surface receptors,
  and cytoplasmic proteins, culminating in the activation of transcription and up-regulation
  of Hh target genes by the DNA-binding transcription factor GLI. The Hh signaling
  pathway is activated by binding of Hh ligands—Sonic, Desert, or Indian hedgehog
  (SHH, DHH, IHH)—to the 12-transmembrane receptor Patched (PTCH). This interaction
  releases the inhibitory effects of PTC on the 7-transmembrane smoothened (SMO) receptor,
  and the conformational change with activation that SMO undergoes, in turn, facilitates
  its inhibition of the cytoplasmic protein Suppressor of Fused (SUFU). SUFU inhibition
  allows GLI to escape cytoplasmic sequestration, on which it undergoes nuclear translocation
  and activates the transcription of Hh target genes.
