caption: 'The dual roles of DAMPs in antitumor immunity and tumor development in breast
  cancer cells. Anticancer agents induce an ER stress response and autophagy, which
  determines whether cells die or survive. When cells die, CRT in the ER lumen migrates
  to the tumor cell membrane, exposing the CRT/ERp57 complex as an “eat me” signal.
  This signal induces an antitumor immune response via ICD-mediated signals. CRT overexpression
  is associated with tumor progression and metastasis via the MAPK signaling pathway.
  Nuclear HMBG1 is released extracellularly to trigger inflammatory responses and
  is involved in tumor progression, metastasis, angiogenesis, drug resistance, and
  antitumor immunity in response to the tumor microenvironment and external stimuli.
  In TN breast cancer, cytoplasmic HMGB1 is associated with increased numbers of TILs,
  which are involved in antitumor immunity. ATP, which is secreted abundantly extracellularly,
  binds to P2X7 receptors on breast cancer cells and is involved in tumor migration
  and invasion. Extracellular ATP also triggers an inflammatory response and is involved
  in tumor migration, invasion, and chemotherapy resistance due to EMT. DAMPs, such
  as CRT, HMBG1, and ATP, in breast cancer cells play dual roles in tumor progression
  and antitumor immunity, depending on the magnitude and duration of external stimuli
  in the tumor microenvironment. Abbreviations: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  COX-2, cyclooxygenase 2; EMT, epithelial—mesenchymal transition; HIF, hypoxia inducible
  factor; SOX9, sex-determining region Y-box 9; JAK1, Janus kinase 1; TN, triple negative.'
