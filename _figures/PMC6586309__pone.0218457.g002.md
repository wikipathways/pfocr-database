caption: Glutaminolysis, the metabolic conversion of glutamine to glutamate, aspartate
  and alanine, represents an alternative pathway to supply the mitochondrial citric
  acid cycle with a surplus of α-ketoglutarate. As this pathway is preferentially
  used by proliferating tissue, glutaminolysis measured as (cAla+cAsp+cGlu)/cGln is
  increased in tumor tissue.[] Metabolites determined in this study are marked in
  grey.
