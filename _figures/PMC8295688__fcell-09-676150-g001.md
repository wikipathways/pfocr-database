caption: Synergic destructive effects of diabetes and SARS-CoV-2. In the hyperglycemia
  situation, accumulation of glucose into the cell can induce mitochondrial dysfunction,
  production of AGEs and polyol pathway activation that can induce ROS. Production
  of ROS can lead to cell injury and also inflammation through activation of the NFκB
  pathway. Also, after the virus enters into the cell through ACE2, the initial virus
  replication can lead to ROS induction. Once more, ROS can induce inflammation through
  activation of the NFκB pathway or induction of macrophage activity. Recognition
  of the virus by NLRP3 at the cell surface leads to binding of NLRP3 to the pro-caspase-1
  through the ASC. This connection activates caspase-1 which leads to the cleavage
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines like pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and GSMD. This results
  in the production of mature IL-1β and IL-18 and N-terminal products, respectively.
  N-terminal products located into cell membranes result in the creation of the GSMD
  pore. Following cell perforation and release of the cellular content into the extracellular
  space, inflammation, cell swelling, and pyroptosis can occur. After appearance of
  the adaptive immune response, generation of neutralizing antibodies and binding
  of macrophage virus receptors to the virus, cytokines, and chemokines such as IL-6,
  IFNγ, MCP-1, and IP-10 are produced and secreted into the bloodstream of patients.
