caption: 'Roles and metabolism of glutathione. γ-GCS and GSS coordinately catalyze
  de novo synthesis of GSH from three amino acids: Cys, Glu, and Gly. GPX reduces
  various peroxides, including hydrogen peroxide, by electrons from GSH. The resultant
  GSSG is reduced back to GSH by GSR via the donation of electrons from NADPH supplied
  from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). GSH not only supplies electrons to peroxides,
  but also plays multiple roles in cells.'
