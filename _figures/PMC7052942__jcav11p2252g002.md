caption: 'Verified signaling pathways of YWHAZ in HCC. A. Phosphorylation of Smad3
  linker region by Axl/YWHAZ and JNK activates the expression of TGF-β1, leading to
  HCC invasion and metastasis by TGF-β resistance. Additionally, under hypoxic circumstance,
  YWHAZ interacts with HIF-1α and enhances HIF-1α protein stability by recruiting
  HDAC4 and activating PI3K/Akt/NF-кB pathway, then inducing cell migration, invasion
  and PVTT formation in HCC. B. MiR-375, miR-22 directly targets 3′-UTR of YWHAZ mRNA
  to inhibit YWHAZ expression. YWHAZ can induce autophagy by ATG3, ATG5, ATG7 and
  promote EMT by suppressing CDH1 in HCC. Additionally, phosphorylated AKT inhibits
  the activity of FOXO3a by promoting its phosphorylation and binding YWHAZ with FOXO3a,
  then promoting HCC migration and invasion. In cytoplasm, YWHAZ/FOXO3a complex inhibits
  the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated FOXO3a and promotes FOXO3a degradation.
  C. Cryab complexes with YWHAZ and elevates its expression, leading to activation
  of ERK1/2/Fra-1/slug signaling pathway and then inducing EMT progression by decreasing
  E-cadherin expression. Moreover, sorafenib response is impaired in this signaling
  pathway. HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma; TGF-β: transforming growth factor-β; HIF-1α:
  hypoxia-induced factor-1α; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition; PVTT: portal
  vein tumor thrombus; Cryab: αB-Crystallin.'
