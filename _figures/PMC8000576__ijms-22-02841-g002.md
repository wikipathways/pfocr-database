caption: The mechanisms by which MYC induces apoptosis. The P53-dependent pathway
  to MYC-induced death is primarily mediated by the ARF-MDM-P53 axis following the
  upregulation of ARF expression by MYC. This leads to the stabilisation of P53 and
  the induction of P53 pro-apoptotic target genes. In contrast, the P53-independent
  pathway to MYC-induced apoptosis is reliant on the direct transcription of pro-apoptotic
  genes or the repression of pro-survival protein expression. Given the cooperativity
  between MYC signalling and the BCL-2-regulated apoptotic pathway in promoting tumourigenesis,
  combining drugs targeting both arms (e.g., MYC with JQ1, BCL-2 pro-survival proteins
  with BH3-mimetics) is a promising therapeutic avenue (see ). Figure created with
