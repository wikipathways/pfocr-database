caption: Glycolysis-driven mevalonate metabolism versus fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-driven
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Glycolysis-derived pyruvate can enter the mitochondrion
  and fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to drive OXPHOS. Cells thus generate
  energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). However, activated immune or
  cancer cells can also export citrate to the cytosol, where it is converted back
  to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by ATP citrate lyase. Abundance of cytosolic acetyl-CoA
  enables both, fatty acid synthesis (FAS) and mevalonate metabolism, collectively
  referred to as lipogenesis. Three molecules of acetyl-CoA are required to generate
  HMG-CoA. HMG-CoA is the substrate of HMG-CoA reductase, the mevalonate-generating
  enzyme, which catalyzes the first committed step and thus initiates the pathway
  leading to farnesyl diphosphate, also known as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP = branching
  point). Whereas FPP is the precursor in cholesterol biosynthesis, both, FPP and
  geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), represent activated isoprenoid moieties in posttranslational
  protein prenylation. Concurrent FAO may influence the availability of acetyl-CoA
  for mevalonate metabolism, because FAO usually serves to drive OXPHOS and thus diverts
  acetyl-CoA from lipogenic pathways.
