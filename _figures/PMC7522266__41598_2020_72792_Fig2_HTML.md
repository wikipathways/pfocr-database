caption: Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis metabolic pathway for utilization
  of 2′FL, 3FL, DFL and their constituent monosaccharides. FLs are internalized by
  ABC transporters and hydrolyzed intracellularly by a set of β-galactosidases and
  α-fucosidases of various substrate specificities (listed in Fig. ). The resultant
  monosaccharides enter the Bifid shunt and fermentative pathways characteristic of
  this taxon. L-fucose catabolism in bifidobacteria has not yet been fully elucidated
  and is depicted as predicted in, with modifications. Known or predicted genes implicated
  in L-fucose catabolism are shown as Blon IDs. The central role of the pyruvate node
  for metabolism of small fucosylated HMOs is highlighted. Dissipation of the excess
  of L-fucose via yet unidentified efflux transporters for fucose and pyruvate is
  shown on the left. Enzymes are in gold, compounds in black, secreted fermentation
  end products are in green or red (for pyruvate). See Supplemental Table  for explanation
  of abbreviations.
