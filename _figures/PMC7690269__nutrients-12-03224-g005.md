caption: Schematic summary of glutathione synthesis, catabolism, regulation and putative
  connections with polydatin. Reduced glutathione (GSH) can be produced by continuous
  recycling mediated by the enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase
  (GR). GPX uses GSH as substrate and oxidizes it to its dimeric oxidized form (GSSG),
  reducing peroxides and acid peroxides to water and alcohol. GR brings back GSSG
  to its reduced form GSH which will again be oxidized by GPX, thus leading to the
  antioxidant status necessary for cellular homeostasis. Instead de novo synthesis
  of GSH is mediated by glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) and glutathione synthetase
  (GS) when the building blocks (Glutamate, Cys = Cysteine, Gly = Glycine) are available
  in sufficient quantities. A negative feed-back mechanism exists since GSH inhibits
  GCL, avoiding unnecessary biosynthesis of GSH. In order to perform its detoxification
  function GSH is consumed by its conjugation to drugs or other xenobiotics mediated
  by glutathione S-transferase (GT), whereas its catabolism is initiated by γ-glutamyl
  transpeptidase (GGT) which yields the CysteinylGlycine (CysGly) dipeptide. Polydatin
  may impact GSH metabolism either augmenting the quantity or activation of GCL through
  the Nrf2 pathway or by triggering sirtuins which in turn modulate the activity of
  GPX and GT. The precursors present in the GluS and GluReS dietary supplements are
  depicted in red. GSH-X = reduced glutathione bound to a xenobiotic substance; X
  = xenobiotic substance; AA = aminoacids; NAC = N-acetylcysteine; Ala = alanine;
  Gln = glutamine; αKG = α-ketoglutarate.
