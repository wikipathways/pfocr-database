  Briefly, stages 1 and 2 of their model are characterized by the early development
  of alpha-synuclein rich Lewy bodies within lower brainstem regions and the olfactory
  bulb and represent a “preclinical” phase of the disease. Stages 3 and 4 mark the
  onset of clinical symptoms in PD due to spreading pathology to several key mid-
  and forebrain regions largely implicated in PD. including the substantia nigra (SN)
  and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), among others. Stages 5 and 6 are thought to
  represent the end stages of disease progression as Lewy bodies spread diffusely
  up through the cortex. We thus propose that the clinical and other biological manifestations
  of PD occur within the context of the Braak staging model. (1) As noted, alpha-synuclein
  accrual in prodromal PD occurs in dopaminergic-rich brainstem regions including
  the SN and PPN, the latter of which projects to both the ventral tegmental area
  (VTA) and the SN (; ). (2) Deterioration of the VTA leads to the disruption of mesolimbic
  and mesocortical dopaminergic pathways (; ), which in turn (3) alter circadian functioning

  ; ; ; ). (5) Altered clock gene expression is highly implicated in the development
  of several forms of sleep disturbances, including RBD (). (6) Concurrent deterioration
  of the SN leads to disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway via dopaminergic depletion,

  production (), and reduced dopamine levels in turn blunt daily rhythms in clock
  gene expression (). (9) We propose that disrupted sleep via RBD that is perpetuated
  by dysregulated clock gene expression, (10) along with dopaminergic dysfunction

  system functioning and (11) contributes to alpha-synuclein buildup in perivascular
  pathways, thereby exacerbating neurodegeneration and emerging disease symptoms ().
  Continued mechanistic disturbances in dopaminergic pathways, sleep, and glymphatic
  clearance of alpha-synuclein over time perpetuate the course of PD development,
