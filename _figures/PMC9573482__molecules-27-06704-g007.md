caption: 'Schematic of FcεRI structure and signaling. The receptor is composed of
  4 subunits: one α chain, one β chain and two γ chains joined by two disulphide bridges.
  When activated by IgE crosslinking, FcεRI phosphorylates and recruits adaptor proteins
  Lyn and SYK. Lyn phosphorylation of SYK, especially at tyrosine (Y) residues 348
  and 352, and SYK’s autophosphorylation, leads to activation of SYK which then phosphorylates
  LAT, allowing for recruitment of PLC γ and Grb2. Resveratrol may inhibit this pathway
  downstream of tyrosine 348 phosphorylation, which is detected by the specific anti-phospho-SYK
  antibody used in this study. It may inhibit SYK autophosphorylation or phosphorylation
  of the downstream targets to ultimately prevent ERK phosphorylation. Some possible
  mechanisms by which resveratrol and quercetin might inhibit FcεRI surface expression
  include: (a) translation of FcεRI subunit mRNAs via inducing phosphorylation of
  eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) or (b) vesicular trafficking of FcεRI complex
  from endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane via inhibiting phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3-Kinase).'
