caption: Mechanisms of glutathione-mediated ferroptosisFirst, the pathways of system
  Xc−/GSH/GPX4 are shown. Following uptake by system Xc−, cystine is catalyzed to
  GSH by GCL and GSS. GPX4 converts GSH to GSSH to reduce lipid ROS production and
  inhibit ferroptosis. Second, the transsulfuration pathway is shown. Methionine is
  catalyzed to cysteine by transferase, CBS, and CTH to produce GSH. BAP1, ATF3, Beclin1,
  and p53 inhibit SLC7A11, increasing cystine uptake and leading to ferroptosis.
