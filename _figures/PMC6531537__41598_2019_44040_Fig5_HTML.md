caption: 'The purine metabolic pathway surrounded by the scaled intensities of relevant
  biochemicals. Biochemical node colour corresponds to day by progesterone (P4) interaction
  – dark red indicates a significant (p ≤ 0.05) interaction (node border thickness
  is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the p-value). Within these statistically
  significant nodes, node diameter is correlated to metabolic hierarchy (cofactor
  and intermediate metabolite nodes are smallest, followed by by-products, and central
  metabolites). Light red depicts an increasing trend (0.05 < p < 0.10), black depicts
  an identified amino acid which did not exhibit a day by progesterone interaction,
  and grey represents a biochemical present in the metabolic library but not detected
  in this study. Box plots: The y-axes are the relative metabolite concentrations,
  with the central horizontal line representing the median value with outer boundaries
  depicting the upper and lower quartile limits. Error bars depict the minimum and
  maximum distributions, with + representing the mean value and ○ the extreme data
  point. Abbreviations: Day 12 Normal P4 (12N), Day 12 High P4 (12H), Day 13 Normal
  P4 (13N), Day 13 High P4 (13H), Day 14 Normal P4 (14N), Day 14 High P4 (14H).'
