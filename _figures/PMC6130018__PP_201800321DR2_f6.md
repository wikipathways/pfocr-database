caption: Proposed model of integration between SA signaling and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis
  guard cells. SA triggers a SHAM-sensitive peroxidase-mediated ROS signal that activates
  CPKs but not OST1 protein kinase. Then, the CPKs together with other unknown protein
  kinases (e.g. CIPKs) phosphorylate S59 and S120 of SLAC1 and activate it, whereas
  ABA requires OST1 as well as CPKs for the activation of SLAC1. These suggest that
  SA signaling integrates with ABA signaling via the Ca2+/CPK-dependent signaling
  pathway in guard cells. The two MAPKs, MPK9 and MPK12, also function downstream
  of ROS and Ca2+ in guard cell SA signaling and regulate SLAC1 activity indirectly.
  The molecular mechanism underlying the interdependence of the CPK-dependent and
  MPK-dependent pathways for SLAC1 activation is unknown.
