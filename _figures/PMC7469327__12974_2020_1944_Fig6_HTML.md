caption: Drugs targeting inflammasome signaling in MS and EAE. Interferon (IFN) regulates
  the transcriptional level of signal transducer and activator transcription 1 (STAT1)
  to suppress activity of the (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) and NLRP3
  inflammasomes. STAT1 target gene products directly repress these inflammasomes.
  Additionally, IFN/STAT1 pathway increases IL-10 synthesis in macrophages, IL-10-mediated
  STAT3 activation, and the suppression of interleukin (IL)-1β precursor synthesis
  by activated STAT3. Ketotifen is an anti-histamine that inhibits mast cell degranulation
  to block activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. MCC950 directly targets the NLRP3
  NACHT domain and interferes with the Walker B motif function, preventing NLRP3 conformational
  change and oligomerization. IC100, a humanized monoclonal antibody, binds to apoptosis
  speck-like staining protein containing a CARD (ASC) and prevents recruitment of
  ASC into the NLRP3 signaling complex and blocks formation of ASC specks intracellular
  and extracellularly
