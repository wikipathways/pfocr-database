caption: This figure illustrates the simplified cholesterol biosynthesis pathway with
  a focus on SQLE. The pathway features key rate-limiting enzymes, including HMGCR
  and SQLE. HMGCR catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to MVA. SQLE first converts
  squalene to 2,3-epoxysqualene. This intermediate then undergoes further enzymatic
  reactions to eventually produce cholesterol. When lanosterol synthase activity is
  low, SQLE diverts 2,3-epoxysqualene to dioxidosqualene, which is then converted
  to 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol and subsequently to 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. 24(S),25-Epoxycholesterol
  binds to LXR, activating it and leading to the upregulation of ABCA1, which enhances
  cholesterol efflux
