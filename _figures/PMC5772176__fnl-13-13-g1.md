caption: (A) Normal homeostatic synaptic plasticity. On the left are pathways involved
  in homeostatic upregulation in response to chronic hypoactivity and on the right
  are those involved in downregulation following persistent hyperactivity. Negative
  feedback compensation alters synaptic number, strength or size in order to return
  network activity to an optimal, balanced level. Multiple homeostatic mechanisms
  have been identified and only a subset is depicted here. (B) Proposed mechanisms
  of aberrant homeostatic plasticity that may contribute to neurological disorders.
  On the left is a hypothetical pathway that may promote development of epilepsy,
  in which an initial insult leads to a latent period of hypoactivity, triggering
  overcompensation and excessive synaptic strengthening due to dysfunctional homeostatic
  machinery that ultimately leads to seizures. Therapeutic strategies for epilepsy
  could be to inhibit: kappa opioid receptors or synaptoporin function to prevent
  development of seizures or perform closed-loop bioengineering control to terminate
  seizures acutely. On the right is a proposed model for pathogenesis of Alzheimer's
  disease in which aggregation of Aβ leads to hyperactivity of neurons rather than
  downregulation as in the normal condition. Hyperexcitation leads to further production
  of Aβ via Plk2, forming a positive feedback, amplifying loop instead of a negative
  feedback control system. A therapeutic approach to address this model could be to
  inhibit Plk2 activity and interrupt the vicious cycle.
