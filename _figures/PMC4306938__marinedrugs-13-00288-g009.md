caption: Schematic presentation for araguspongine C-induced autophagic death in breast
  cancer cells. Proposed direct inhibition of c-Met and HER2 receptor tyrosine kinases
  by araguspongine C. The inhibition of c-Met and HER2 activation in BT-474 breast
  cancer cells resulted in suppression of downstream molecular transducers, as indicated
  by suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. In addition, araguspongine C treatment
  resulted in a reduction in the total levels of IP3 receptor expressed by BT-474
  cells. Taken together, araguspongine C inhibition of mTOR signaling pathway and
  inhibition of IP3 receptor resulted in the induction of autophagy in BT-474 cancer
  cells and subsequent inhibition of cell growth and proliferation.
