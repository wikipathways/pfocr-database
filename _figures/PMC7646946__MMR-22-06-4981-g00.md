caption: Interaction between the metabolic pathways and the immune cell network in
  pancreatic cancer. The immune network comprises the complex interactions between
  the innate immune cells, adaptive immune cells and the pancreatic cancer cells.
  Immunity in pancreatic cancer is greatly influenced by the chemokines and cytokines
  released by the tumor cells, such as IL-6 and IL-10, as well as those released by
  the immune cells, such as IL-4, IL-13 and IFN-γ. Metabolic pathways also serve an
  important role in the reprogramming of these immune cells, either by activating,
  inhibiting or polarizing these immune cells. For instance, the switch from M1 to
  M2 macrophages is greatly influenced by FAO and the TCA cycle. Enhanced glycolysis
  is necessary for T cell differentiation into their subsets, Th1, Th2, Th17 and T-regs.
