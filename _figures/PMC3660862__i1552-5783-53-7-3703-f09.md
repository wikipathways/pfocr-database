caption: Proposed model of Fas-mediated death of photoreceptors under light stress.
  Intense and prolonged light causes damage of photoreceptors by photo-oxidative stress
  via generation of ROS. The toxic all-trans retinal (ATR) and retinal derivatives
  generated during photoisomerization of the chromophore 11-cis retinal also render
  photoreceptors vulnerable to death. Early damaged photoreceptors can have disorganized
  outer segments, followed by their reduction and loss. Eventual death of photoreceptors
  can be executed by apoptosis through the “intrinsic” pathway as shown. Necrosis
  as demonstrated in this study and activation of the scavenging pathway by autophagy
  also are involved. We also demonstrate that apoptosis in photoreceptors under light
  stress occurs through the “extrinsic” FasL/Fas pathway involving activation of downstream
  caspases. While inhibition of caspases or Fas can prevent apoptosis by light, it
  simultaneously induces secondary cell death by necroptosis.
