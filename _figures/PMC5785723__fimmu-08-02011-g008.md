caption: The proposed model for the mechanism through which wild-type (wt) and lab-attenuated
  rabies virus (RABV) infect astrocytes. During infection, lab-attenuated RABV produces
  double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is recognized by retinoic acid-inducible gene
  I (RIG-I)/melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Activation of mitochondrial
  antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), the common adaptor protein for RIG-I and MDA5,
  leads to enhanced production of interferon, as well as some IFN-stimulated genes,
  which limit RABV replication and spread. MAVS activation stimulates the p38 and
  NF-κB signaling pathways and induces cytokine production in astrocytes. Inflammatory
  cytokines promote blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, enabling peripheral inflammatory
  cells and antibodies to infiltrate into the central nervous system, thereby facilitating
  RABV clearance. In contrast, wt RABV prevents activation of the MAVS signaling pathway
  by restricting dsRNA production.
