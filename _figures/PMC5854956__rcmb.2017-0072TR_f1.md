caption: Major pathways involved in mucus hypersecretion. Cigarette smoke is believed
  to constitutively upregulate acute-phase reactants and stimulate the adaptive immune
  response that leads to production of IL-13. Allergic inflammation also stimulates
  the adaptive immune response to increase production of IL-13. IL-13 upregulation
  of MUC5AC production is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Cigarette
  smoke also actives the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, which then
  acts through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT)
  pathway to induce HIF-1–mediated upregulation of MUC5AC. Downregulation of forkhead
  box A2 (FOXA2) and hypersecretion of IL-13 contribute to STAT6-mediated production
  of HIF-1, which in turn stimulates MUC5AC production. LPS and pyocyanin (PCN) act
  through their respective Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to induce production of NF-κB
  and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which upregulate MUC5AC. Although the processes
  regulating MUC5B production are not well understood, IL-6, IL-17, and STAT6-STAT3
  are believed to be involved.
