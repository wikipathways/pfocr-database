caption: SnoN possesses both pro-oncogenic and anti-oncogenic activities. In the nucleus,
  SnoN can have either pro-oncogenic or anti-oncogenic activities through two pathways.
  SnoN may promote epithelial cell proliferation by antagonizing the growth-inhibitory
  activity of the TGF-β/Smad pathway. Very high levels of SnoN may also trigger premature
  senescence through stabilizing p53 in a PML-dependent manner, and this pathway mediates
  the anti-oncogenic activity of SnoN.
