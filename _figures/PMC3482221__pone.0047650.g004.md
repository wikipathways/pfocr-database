caption: Cer is considered the central hub of sphingolipid metabolism . It is synthesized
  de novo in the endoplasmic reticulum by the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA
  to form 3-keto-sphinganine (not shown), which is reduced to Sa. Sa is then N-acylated
  by a series of Cer synthase enzymes that display some selectivity towards particular
  fatty acyl chain lengths. The enzyme desaturase converts these DH-Cer into Cer,
  which are then transported to the Golgi apparatus. At this cellular subsite, Cer
  can be converted into a variety of interconnected sphingolipid products. Cer can
  be glycosylated to form Glc-Cer, followed by transformation into more complex GSL.
  Alternatively, Cer can be converted into SM, or follow a degradative pathway leading
  to So and SoP. The enzymes catalyzing these conversions are shown in italics, and
  the specificity of the three inhibitors used in the study (myriocin, CBE and PDMP)
  are illustrated. Sphingolipids that displayed significant (*p<0.05) age-related
  differences in their relative abundance in both the non-IS and IS fractions have
  a solid boundary. Sphingolipids that displayed a significant (*p<0.05) age-related
  difference or a trend (∧p<0.1) in at least one fraction have a dashed line. Legends
  (IS/NON-IS) indicate in which fraction(s) the difference was found. Blue indicates
  higher in young; red indicates higher in old.
