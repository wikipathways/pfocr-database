caption: A schematic showing hepcidin involvement in CAG injury. CAG can increase
  IL-6 expression and then activate hepcidin via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
  On the one hand, high levels of hepcidin restrain FPN1, causing iron overload and
  ferroptosis in CAG gastric tissue, as indicated by a higher level of 4-HNE and a
  lower level of GPX4. On the other hand, hepcidin is expressed and released by parietal
  cells and flows into the duodenum. Subsequently, high levels of hepcidin inhibit
  FPN1 expression in the basal membrane of epithelial cells and DMT1 expression in
  the brush border membrane of the duodenum, resulting in iron uptake deficiency in
  the duodenum.
