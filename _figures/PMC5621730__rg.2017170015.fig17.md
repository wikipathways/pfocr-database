caption: Schematic view of the VEGFvascular endothelial growth factor pathway and
  the sites of action of its inhibitors. VEGFvascular endothelial growth factor is
  a key factor in angiogenesis and regulates vascular proliferation and permeability.
  Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against VEGFvascular endothelial growth factor
  and inhibits the VEGFvascular endothelial growth factor pathway by binding to circulating
  VEGFvascular endothelial growth factor. Other VEGFvascular endothelial growth factor
  inhibitors, such as sunitinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib, inhibit the intracellular
  tyrosine kinase domain of the VEGFvascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR);
  they also act on other transmembranous receptors, including platelet-derived growth
  factor (PDGF) receptor and C-Kit. VEGFvascular endothelial growth factor inhibition
  by these agents leads to bleeding due to the decreased renewal capacity of endothelial
  cells, or to thrombosis due to tissue factor activation secondary to exposure to
  subendothelial collagen (62,63.)
