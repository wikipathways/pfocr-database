caption: 'Exposure of 60S subunit-associated peptidyl-tRNA in response to ribosome
  stalling and splitting is the key trigger for NEMF recruitment, the first step in
  mammalian RQC. Subsequent ubiquitylation of the nascent-chain by Listerin promotes
  extraction and proteasomal degradation (RQC-L; L for Listerin). The extent to which
  NEMF elongates nascent-chains with Ala tails prior to Listerin-mediated ubiquitylation
  likely varies according to the Lys accessibility of each substrate, with the dashed
  arrow indicating situations in which C-terminal tailing is not required for Listerin
  to act. When Listerin action becomes limiting, NEMF-mediated Ala tails serve as
  a proteolytic signal for the E3 ligases Pirh2 and KLHDC10, which bind to and ubiquitylate
  the released nascent-chains (RQC-C; C for C-end rule pathway). Represented are:
  ribosomal subunits (grey), tRNA-Lys and Lys (blue), NEMF (green), tRNA-Ala and Ala
  (orange), Listerin (yellow), Ubiquitin (red), E2 (navy) and Pirh2 or KLHDC10 (magenta).'
