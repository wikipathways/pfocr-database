caption: Possible mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 can regulate its replication by overcoming
  the antiviral system. SARS-Cov-2 targets B-chain haemoglobin after infection and
  haemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs) and binds haem through Orf8 releasing iron.
  The haem-DGCR8-DROSHA complex initiates RNA processing, resulting in virus-encoded
  miRNA. Some of these are cleaved by RISC, while others, such as nucleocapsid N,
  are viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs). VSRs antagonize the RNAi pathway
  and thus the antiviral response. The possible therapeutic strategies are shown in
  the yellow square.
