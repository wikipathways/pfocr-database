caption: Major hub gene BrPLA2-ALPHA-centered gene coexpression network using probes
  with at least one  (after correction). Only genes that are connected with BrPLA2-ALPHA
  in the whole gene-metabolite coexpression network (Supplemental Fig. S2) are shown.
  Nodes represent genes or s. Genes from different pathways are shown in different
  node colors, while metabolites are shown in triangle-shaped nodes in purple. Edges
  represent high absolute correlations (r > 0.5). Edges connecting the major hub gene
  and genes from the same pathway (lipid degradation) are in blue, edges between the
  major hub gene and genes from the other pathways are in red, and edges connecting
  genes and s are in green. Edges connecting genes (other than with the major hub
  gene) of different pathways have been left out to improve the visibility of the
  network. The shapes of gene nodes indicate cis-s (chevrons), trans-s (squares),
  and cis-/trans-s (diamonds). Node names are coded by concatenating the gene name,
  cis-/trans-regulation, and the linkage group. For example, node FAD2_C-5 indicates
  gene FAD2, C for cis-, and 5 for linkage group A05, where the cis- was detected.
  In the case of a cis-/trans-, CER10_CT-9_1 indicates gene CER10 and CT-9_1 indicates
  a cis- on A09 and trans-s on A01. Solid lines indicate positive correlations, and
  dotted lines indicate negative correlations. All the gene names are prefixed with
  Br because of B. rapa gene nomenclature. Multiple occurrence of the same gene name
  represents genes with multiple paralogs or probes.
