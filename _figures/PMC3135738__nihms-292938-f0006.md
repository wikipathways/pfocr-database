caption: 'An evolving schema of the pathophysiologic paradigm contributing to the
  dyshomeostasis of cardiomyocyte cytosolic free [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]m as prooxidant,
  and subsarcolemmal mitochondria and [Zn2+]i and [Zn2+]m, as antioxidant, during
  chronic aldosteronism is presented, which is accompanied by secondary hyperparathyroidism
  evoked by ionized hypocalcemia (decreased [Ca2+]o). Elevations in plasma parathyroid
  hormone (PTH) cause intracellular Ca2+ overloading via L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCC),
  and the induction of oxidative stress with reactive species (ROS) generation contributing
  to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and ensuing
  cardiomyocyte necrosis followed by tissue repair and a replacement fibrosis, or
  myocardial scarring. Antioxidant defenses are mobilized to counteract the prooxidant
  state. These include: ROS-mediated generation of nitric oxide (NO) from endothelial
  eNOS, present in both endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, where NO and its generation
  of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) via guanylyl cyclase (GC) serves to inhibit
  LTCC. NO also promotes the release of inactive Zn2+ bound to metallothionein (Zn/MT)
  to raise both [Zn2+]i and [Zn2+]m. The rise in [Zn2+]i activates its sensor, metal-responsive
  transcription factor (MTF)-1 which, in turn, upregulates transcription of antioxidant
  defense genes. Zn2+ transporters, induced by ROS, also contribute to increased Zn2+
  entry and a resultant rise in [Zn2+]i and [Zn2+]m. In response to catecholamine
  receptor-ligand binding, β3 adrenergic receptors (β3R) evoke the NO-mediated pathway
  to Zn2+ release and inhibition of Ca2+ entry via LTCC.'
