caption: 'Feedforward activation, feedback inhibition, and activation and cross talks
  of the condensed gene and protein regulatory networks are coordinated by a bow-tie
  core, that is, TFs, of gene and protein network in response to hypo-osmotic stress
  (blue), sorbitol osmotic stress (brown), and pheromone stress (orange), simultaneously:
  the connections from stresses to TFs are reconstructed according to Figures –. For
  example, if a MAPK pathway under stress A, from membrane protein B to the downstream
  TF C of the pathway, is fully connected in Figures –, the relationship, from stress
  A to membrane protein B and then to TF C, is connected with the same color through
  the whole pathway. The transcription regulations from TFs to target genes (solid
  thin lines) are deduced according to Figures –. A target gene transcriptionally
  regulated under a certain stress may be transcribed to influence the concentration
  of its protein (TF) (dot lines) in response to the stress. In order to provide the
  protection against a variety of environmental stresses, the bow-tie core network
  can detect a broader range of molecular signatures for stresses and invoke effective
  response under resource-limited condition.'
