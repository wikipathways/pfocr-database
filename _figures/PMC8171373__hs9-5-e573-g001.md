caption: 'Currently recognized key pathways in T-PLL and T-LGL that provide potential
  targets for novel treatment strategies. Illustrated are receptors and molecular
  signaling nodes as well as their interactions in alignment with the modes of action
  of most promising compound classes in the treatment of T-PLL and T-LGL. A defective
  response to DNA damage caused by dysfunctional ATM is a pathogenetic hallmark of
  T-PLL. Re-activation of p53 or downstream modification of the BCL2/MCL1 equilibrium
  provide reasonable approaches to restore the tumor cell’s ability to undergo intrinsic
  apoptosis. Further strategies aim to inhibit vital growth signals, that is, via
  inhibition of proliferation and differentiation signals induced by cytokine or TCR
  signaling. Preliminary efforts (displayed transparent) are undertaken in the field
  of immunotherapies: CAR-T cells targeting the TCR β-chain are under development.
  The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and modulation of the non-T-immune cell
  synapse (eg, NK-cells, macrophages [MΦ]) is effective in other T-cell malignancies,
  but has thus far not been evaluated systematically in T-PLL or in T-LGL. Ac = acetylated;
