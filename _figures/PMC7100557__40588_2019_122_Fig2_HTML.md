caption: MERS-CoV inhibits innate antiviral signaling. Mammalian cells have evolved
  conserved pathogen sensing molecules called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).
  When a coronavirus, such as MERS-CoV, infects a human cell, the virus produces dsRNA
  as replication and transcription intermediates. dsRNA stimulates cellular sensors
  of viral nucleic acid such as TLR3, RIGI, and MDA5. These sensors, through adaptor
  proteins and cellular kinases (TBK1 and IKKε), activate interferon regulatory factor
  3 (IRF3). Activated IRF3 molecules form homodimers and translocate to the nucleus
  of the infected cell to induce the expression of type I IFNs (IFNα and IFNβ). IFNs
  then bind to IFN α/β receptor (IFNAR) to stimulate the Jak/Stat pathway, which in
  turn induces the expression of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs
  protect cells from subsequent virus replication and associated cell damage. MERS-CoV
  proteins M and ORFs 4a, 4b, and 5 (depicted in italics) have evolved different strategies
  to inhibit the expression of interferon and ISGs. ER = endoplasmic reticulum
