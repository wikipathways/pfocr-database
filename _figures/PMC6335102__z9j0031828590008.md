caption: 'ANG II induces cardiac hypertrophy by multiple means involving direct actions
  on cardiac myocytes (cm) or the release of paracrine factors from other cell types,
  such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. Developments within the
  last 5 yr are noted in darker text and are highlighted here. Three processes are
  dominant in cardiac myocytes: canonical signaling, transactivation of EGFR, and
  inflammatory signaling. The later may involve other cell types as the source of
  ROS. For canonical signaling, Gα13 was recently shown to regulate RhoA activation
  that was linked to activation of myocardin-related transcription factors. A background
  Ca2+ entry pathway formed by TRPC1 and TRPC4 channels was also implicated in ANG
  II-induced cardiac hypertrophy via canonical means. AT1R may couple to cardiac hypertrophy
  as a mechanosensor for increased blood pressure (BP) via β-arrestin 2 biased signaling
  that involves activation of Src and ERK1/2. As a mechanosensor, AT1R may conceivably
  activate canonical signaling as well. Inflammation is driven by Nox4- and Nox2-derived
  ROS that leads to the engagement of a number of processes that sustain hypertrophic
  signaling, such as the downregulation of the TLR4 inhibitor, SIRPA, as well as the
  activation of RhoA and Akt/mTOR signaling. Mitochondria are an additional source
  of ROS for cardiac hypertrophy (MitoROS). The adaptor molecule CIKS may couple AT1R
  to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, downstream of Nox2 activation. ANG II enhances
  expression and activation of CIKS in cardiac myocytes leading to IKK/NF-κB and JNK/AP-1
  activation and subsequent induction of MMP-9 and IL-18, a growth factor for cardiac
  myocytes. Secreted Nampt from cardiac myocytes, as well as the generation and activation
  of the immunoproteasome, may also contribute to ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
  In response to ANG II, endothelial cells release ET-1 and inflammatory cytokines
  that induce cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Activated fibroblasts stimulate hypertrophy
  by releasing FGF-2, fibulin-2, TGF-β, and exosomes that are enriched in passenger
  strand miR-21*.'
