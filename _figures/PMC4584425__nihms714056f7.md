caption: (A) Cartoon depicting a hypothetical cellular pathway (left), the regulatory
  interactions it would confer (middle), and the resulting predicted hierarchy with
  terminal nodes (right).(B) Paths leading to physical interactions displayed by promoter.
  Only promoters for which we identified interactions that were both physical and
  regulatory in the Intestinal Hierarchical TF model are shown. Color indicates target
  gene, colored lines indicate regulatory paths in the model that include TFs that
  physically interact with the target promoter. All TFs connected by a colored line
  act as regulators of the indicated (by color) target genes. TFs that represent the
  last node in a regulatory path to the target gene (terminal nodes) are boxed. Not
  all paths leading to the NHR-10 super-node are colored for visual clarity (some
  red and orange lines have been removed).
