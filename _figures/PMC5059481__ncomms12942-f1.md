caption: State of the knowledge on the biosynthetic pathway from GGPP to CA, CO and
  PA before this study. The terpene synthases CPS and MiS cyclize GGPP to miltiradiene,
  which spontaneously oxidizes to abietatriene. Ferruginol synthases oxidize abietatriene
  to ferruginol. A further intermediate is presumed to be 11-hydroxyferruginol. Oxidations
  at the C20 position should lead to pisiferic acid (PA) from ferruginol and to carnosic
  acid (CA) from 11-hydroxyferruginol. Further oxidation of CA at the C7 position
  results in carnosol.
