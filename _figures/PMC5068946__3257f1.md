caption: The MEI-1 regulatory pathway. Proteins active in meiosis are in blue and
  those active in mitosis are in black. During meiosis, the katanin MEI-1/MEI-2 complex
  is activated by PPFR-1 and HECD-1 and so severs microtubules (MTs). When meiosis
  is completed, CUL-3/MEL-26 increases and EMB-27/APC/C activates CUL-2/MBK-2, leading
  to MEI-1 degradation. CUL-2 also functions during meiosis to prevent premature MEL-26
  accumulation. RFL-1 and HECD-1 function at both divisions. Dashed lines indicate
  that interactions may be indirect. Not shown are mitotic translational inhibition
  of MEI-1 mRNA (messenger RNA) by IFET-1/SPN-2 and OMA-1 or the other PP4 subunits
  that act with PPFR-1.
