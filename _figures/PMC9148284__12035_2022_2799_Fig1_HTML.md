caption: The major molecular targets of paraquat that lead to cellular damage and
  apoptosis. (1) Paraquat crosses the blood–brain barrier via LAAT. (2) It then enters
  neuronal cells via transporters such as dopamine transporter DAT, OCT2, and OCT3.
  (3) Upon entry to the cells, paraquat undergoes a process of redox cycling, a process
  of alternate reduction and reoxidation. Paraquat is reduced by enzymes present in
  the mitochondria to form a monocation free radical, PQ•+. PQ•+ is then rapidly reoxidized
  in the presence of oxygen to generate O2•− and regenerates its parent compound PQ2+.
  If there is sufficient NADPH as an electron donor and O2 as an electron acceptor,
  paraquat will repeatedly undergo the reduction–oxidation cycle, generating O2•−.
  This results in the initiation of a reaction cascade leading to ROS generation,
  such as H2O2 and OH−, in addition to RNS such as ONOO−. (4) The generation of ROS
  and RNS are counterbalanced by the activation of the Nrf2-Keap1-ARE signaling pathway
  to activate endogenous antioxidant enzyme genes, such as HO-1 and NQO1. (5) Paraquat
  increase α-synuclein modifications, misfolding, and fibrillation rate resulting
  in aggregation to form Lewy bodies which are toxic to the cell. (6) Paraquat can
  also induce ER stress by activating the UPR signal proteins, such as PERK, ATF6,
  and IRE1, consequently leading to the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic transcription
  factor, CHOP. (7) Ultimately, the activation of various pathological cellular processes,
  such as oxidative and nitrosative stress, ER stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction,
  results in the apoptotic pathway activation, leading to the cell death of dopaminergic
  neurons. ARE antioxidant response element, ATF6 activating transcription factor
