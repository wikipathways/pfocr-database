caption: The canonical pathway of ET-1. Active ET-1 is synthesized from precursors
  via endothelin converting enzymes (ECE). ET-1 signals via two G protein-coupled
  receptors, ETA and ETB, both of which share the same Gq/11signaling pathway. Activation
  of a receptor leads to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), which processes
  the molecule phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol trisphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds its receptor located on the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum (SR), followed by a release of Ca2+ into the cytosol. Arrows describe
  cause–effect relationships. The right panel is a zoom-in (big arrow) of the box
  region. CaM, calmodulin; MLCK, myosin light-chain kinase; PKC, protein kinase C;
  ROC, receptor-operated channel; RyR, ryanodine receptor; VOC, voltage-gated channel.
