caption: Biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Arachidonic acid (AA) is a phospholipid present
  in cell membranes and is liberated from the cellular membranes by cytoplasmic phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2). Free AA is converted to PGE2 through the COX pathway. AA is metabolized
  to the intermediate prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), which is then reduced to PGH2 by the
  peroxidase activity of COX. PGH2 is sequentially metabolized to PGE2 or other eicosanoids
  by specific synthases.
