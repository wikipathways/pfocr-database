caption: A) the model represents different types of neurons and glia cells, excitatory
  pyramidal neurons (blue), activity-regulating astrocytes (green), inhibitory GABAergic
  nitric oxide (NO), neuropeptide-Y (NPY), and somatostatin (SOM) releasing neurons
  (orange). These neurons, represented by the states NPyr, NNO, NNPY, and NSOM, can
  be excited with an external stimulation, ui={1,2,3,4}. The excitation is unique
  to every unique stimulation configuration, indicated by the pink-coloured arrows.
  When excited the pyramidal neurons increase the level of intracellular calcium ions
  (CaPyr2+). The calcium level controls the release of neurotransmitters and the activity
  of intracellular synthesis of vasoactive substances. The neurotransmitters released
  are excitatory glutamate, by pyramidal neurons, and inhibitory GABA, by GABAergic
  interneurons. These neurotransmitters act on the other neurons and are regulated
  by the astrocytes, which can both synthesize glutamate and GABA dependent on their
  level of intracellular calcium ions (CaAst2+). The purple-coloured arrows indicate
  that these signalling pathways are allowed to vary due to the anaesthesia conditions
  differing between different studies. The intracellular calcium is controlled by
  the neuronal activity of the neurons. The intracellular pathways of the excitatory
  and inhibitory neurons end with the release of vasoactive substances that influence
  the vascular smooth muscles (VSM) surrounding the arterioles. Pyramidal neurons
  release the vasodilating substance Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), NO neurons release the
  vasodilating substance NO, NPY neurons release the vasoconstricting substance NPY,
  and SOM neurons release both the vasodilating substance NO and vasoconstricting
  substance NPY. The dilation and constriction of the arterioles control the rate
  of blood entering the arterioles. A generalized expression of removal or breakdown
  is denoted with ∅. Further, the vascular compartment of the model describes the
  volume (Vi={A,C,V,E}), blood flow (fi={in,AC,CV,out}), oxygen content (niO2,i={a,c,v,t}),
  and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) of the arterioles (A), capillaries
  (C), venules (V), tissue (t), and extravascular volume (E). The compartmental volume
  and oxygen saturation are used to calculate the functional magnetic resonance imaging
  blood oxygen-level dependent (fMRI-BOLD) signal. The total fMRI-BOLD signal is the
  sum of the signal from each compartment (Si={A,C,V,E}) B) The three-compartment
  vascular model, consisting of arterioles (A), capillaries (C), and venules (V),
  describes the blood volumes (Vi), pressures, and flows (fi) corresponding to an
  analogue electrical circuit. The drop in blood pressure over a compartment can be
  represented by a voltage drop, the blood flow is represented by an electric current,
  and the blood volume can be seen as an electric charge stored in capacitors. The
  vessel compliance (Ci={1,2,3}) is represented by the capacitance of the capacitors,
  and the vessel resistance (Ri={1,2,3}) is analogous to the electric resistance.
  The blood pressure difference (ΔPr) maintained by the intracranial pressure corresponds
  to the electromotive force created by a voltage source. C) The oxygen transport
  model depicts the amount of oxygen (niO2,), oxygen saturation (SiO2,i={A,C,V}),
  oxygenated haemoglobin (HbOi={A,C,V}) and deoxygenated haemoglobin (HbRi={A,C,V}),
  for each respective compartment. The rate of oxygen metabolism, which occurs in
  the extravascular tissue, is regulated by the activity of intracellular Ca2+ transportation
  in the different neurons (pyramidal, astrocyte, NO−, NPY−, SOM-interneurons). Oxygen
  diffusion from the vessel compartments to the extravascular tissue is concentration-driven.
  Additionally, oxygen can diffuse from the arterioles to the venules. The amount
  of oxygen can be translated into oxygen saturation (SiO2), from which the level
  of oxygenated (HbOi) and deoxygenated blood (HbRi)can be estimated
