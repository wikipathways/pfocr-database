caption: The role of ubiquitination enzymes in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  of CRC. Under normal cellular conditions (in the absence of WNT), β-catenin in the
  cytoplasm undergo UPS-mediated degradation by interacting with a destructive complex
  (DC) consisting of APC, Axin, CK1 and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3-β). DVL removes
  FZD6 from the cell membrane via RNF43/ZNRF3 binding. LPR is also deleted. The ubiquitination
  enzymes β-TrCP and UBES2S promote the degradation of β-catenin. On the other hand,
  Wnt binding to the LPR and FZD6 prevents β-catenin degradation, the C-terminus of
  LRP is phosphorylated and the binding of Axin inhibits the interaction of β-catenin
  with DCs, leading to stable transfer of β-catenin to the nucleus that binds to the
  TCF/LEF transcription factors to activate transcription of Wnt target genes. Expression
  of β-catenin is promoted by TRIM29 and TRIM27. RNF14 promotes β-catenin binding
  to TCF/LEF. β-Catenin degradation has been shown to be inhibited by NEDD4L, Smurf2,
  CRBN, SIAH and RNF146
