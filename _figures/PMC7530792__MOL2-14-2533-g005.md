caption: Proposed model for how cAMP‐hydrolyzing PDE inhibitors potentiate statin‐induced
  cancer cell death. Compounds that increase intracellular cAMP levels, including
  PDE inhibitors (e.g., dipyridamole, cilostazol) and forskolin, can sensitize cancer
  cells to statin‐induced apoptosis. Dipyridamole and cilostazol also inhibit statin‐induced
  activation of SREBP2 through a cAMP‐independent mechanism, which abrogates the restorative
  feedback loop of the MVA pathway and further sensitizes cancer cells to statin‐induced
  apoptosis.
