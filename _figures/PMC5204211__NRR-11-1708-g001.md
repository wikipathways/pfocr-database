caption: 'Current model of Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway activation.Nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is constitutively produced in the cell, however, in the
  absence of environmental stress, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding
  to an inhibitory protein, Kelch-like ECH associated protein-1 (Keap1), which promotes
  continuous ubiquitinylation. Keap1 serves as a bridge between Nrf2 and the Cul3-Rbx1
  E3 ubiquitin ligase. Electrophilic stress leads to modification of reactive cysteines
  within Keap1 that induces conformational changes resulting in Nrf2 stabilization.
  The Nrf2 protein then translocates into the nucleus. There, it forms heterodimers
  with other transcription regulators, such as small Maf proteins. This binding of
  the Nrf2-Maf complex to the (antioxidant response elements) antioxidant response
  elements (AREs) of the ARE-containing genes occurs following the nuclear exit of
  the Nrf2 repressor BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (Bach1) to subsequently induce Nrf2-dependent
  gene expressions. DGR: Double glycine repeat; GST: glutathione S-transferase; HO-1:
  heme oxygenase 1; NQO1: NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase.'
