  A Sucrose metabolism. B TCA cycle with Asp and Glu metabolism. C Branched-chain
  amino acid metabolism. D Fatty acid metabolism. E Surfactin biosynthesis. The numbers
  indicate the absolute value of log2FoldChange in transcript levels of relative genes
  in the sample C14 and C15 relative to those in control sample. The colors red and
  green show considerable upregulation and downregulation, respectively. The numbers
  at left and right side of the gene name indicate the transcriptome results of samples
  C14 vs control and C15 vs control, respectively
