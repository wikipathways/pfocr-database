caption: Schematic showing proposed mechanism of ECM synthesis following CDH11 engagement.
  CDH11 engagement activates TGF-β and ROCK pathways as evidenced by phosphorylation
  of MYPT and Smad2. Activation of Rho–ROCK leads to actin polymerization and nuclear
  localization of MRTF-A. Phosphorylation of Smad2–Smad3 leads to increased levels
  of MYOCD. These two transcription factors, perhaps with the help of other co-factors
  such as SRF, bind to the SBE or CARG response elements leading to transcription
  of collagen and elastin as well as CDH11, indicating the presence of a positive-feedback
  loop. The dotted lines denote that the pathway is not fully defined.
