caption: Figure 12. Schematic model of ER involvement in L-Arg depletion-induced autophagy,
  survival and apoptosis. (A) This is a schematic outline to portray a plausible mechanism
  of how L-Arg deprivation induces autophagy via ER stress. Activated ERN1 splices
  a 26-nucleotide sequence from XBP-1, resulting in a translational frame-shift to
  generate sXBP1, a potent transcription factor involved in the expression of ER-associated
  degradation (ERAD) genes, such as ER degradation-enhancing mannosidase-like protein
  1 (EDEM1). At the same time, MAPK8 is phosphorylated, allowing the release of BECN1
  from the BECN1-BCL2 complex and the generation of the autophagosome. In addition,
  phosphorylation of EIF2S1 by EIF2AK4, or by EIF2AK3 in the absence of EIF2AK4, induces
  the expression of genes as ATF4 and other genes involved in the activation of the
  autophagy pathway. (B) Apoptosis (right) and survival (left) responses triggered
  by L-Arg depletion are dependent on ER stress and autophagy. Depletion of L-Arg
  induces an ER stress response that triggers autophagy as a way for survival (left).
  When autophagy is inhibited, ER stress signals lead to apoptosis (right). See the
  text for further details.
