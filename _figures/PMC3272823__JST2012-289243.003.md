caption: The involvement of the ERK pathway in the TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition. After TGF-β induces the phosphorylation of serine and/or tyrosine on
  TβRI and/or ShcA, ShcA is capable of recruiting Grb2 and Sos to active ERK1/2 through
  Ras, Raf, and MEK1/2. The activation of Ras can also be induced by HGF to control
  the EMT, which is regulated by Snail. This figure depicts the cross-talk between
  ERK, TGF-β, and other factors in different cellular systems and illustrates how
  these networks may function in a stimuli-dependent manner to determine the EMT response.
