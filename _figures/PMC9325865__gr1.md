caption: 'UPR signaling in mammals and fungi. Top: The mammalian UPR comprises three
  ER-transmembrane sensors that are activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins
  in the ER lumen: IRE1, PERK and ATF6. The IRE1 protein has a cytosolic region containing
  both kinase (K) and RNase (R) domains. Upon activation, the RNase cleaves an intron
  (shown in red) from the XBP1u (unspliced) mRNA. The resulting XBP1s (spliced) mRNA
  contains a translational frame-shift that directs the synthesis of the XBP1 transcription
  factor required for UPR target gene induction in the nucleus. The PERK sensor contains
  a cytosolic kinase domain which, when activated, phosphorylates eIF2α (eukaryotic
  initiation factor 2 alpha), resulting in a global attenuation of protein synthesis
  that serves to reduce further influx of client proteins into the ER. However, the
  mRNA encoding the ATF4 transcription factor is able to bypass this translational
  block, allowing it to contribute to the transcriptional rewiring necessary to restore
  ER homeostasis. The ATF6 sensor has a cytosolic transcription factor domain (ATF6p50).
  Upon activation, the protein moves to the Golgi apparatus, where the ATF6p50 transcription
  factor is released from the sensor by the activity of site-1 protease (S1p) and
  site-2 protease (S2p). Bottom: The UPR pathway in A. fumigatus. Unfolded proteins
  activate the IreA RNase to cleave an intron from the hacAu mRNA, creating a frame-shift
  in the resulting hacAi mRNA that translates the HacA transcription factor (the canonical
  pathway). Both canonical and non-canonical functions for IreA contribute to the
  expression of virulence-related traits, which jointly support both pathogenicity
  during infection and resistance to antifungal drugs.'
