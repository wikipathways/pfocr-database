caption: Factors shown to promote or inhibit the vascular normalization phenotype
  in tumors. This schematic depicts a tumor cell (green), endothelial cell (red),
  surrounding pericytes (blue), and the extracellular matrix. Molecules that lead
  to characteristic vessel abnormalities are in red, and those that promote the normalization
  phenotype are in blue. The principal angiogenic molecule responsible for vascular
  abnormalities is VEGF-A. This is produced by tumor cells (in reponse to hypoxia
  via the PHD2/HIF pathway; or due upregulation by oncogenic activation, sex hormones,
  inflammatory cytokines, etc.). VEGF-A may also be derived from tumor-infiltrating
  myeloid cells, pericytes, or released from the extracellular matrix, and acts primarily
  via VEGFR2 on ECs. In addition, VEGF-A stimulation of VEGFR2 on pericytes inhibits
  PDGFB-PDGFRβ mediated pericyte recruitment to ECs. In addition, PlGF may contribute
  to tumor vessel abnormalities (possibly by changing the number or phenotype of macrophages),
  potentially acting through the VEGFR1 or NRP1. Other mediators of the abnormal vessel
  phenotype shown include Ang-2 (acting on the Tie-2 receptor), Rgs5 (which inhibits
  PDGFR-mediated pericyte recruitment), and tumor cell integrins (in the case of GBM).
  Factors that may restore tumor vessels toward a more normal phenotype include Ang-1
  (derived primarily from perivascular cells and acting on Tie-2), SEMA3A, PDGF-B,
  and other factors whose mechanism of action is less clear (eNOS, PDGF-C, PDGF-D,
  IFN-β, TSP-1). Importantly, the differential effects of hypoxia in the tumor cell
  and endothelial cell are to potentially “abnormalize” or normalize vessels, respectively.
