caption: Mechanisms of HBV evasion and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. HBV employs
  multiple strategies to evade detection by the cGAS-STING pathway, including nucleocapsid
  shielding of viral DNA, HBx-mediated cGAS degradation, epigenetic silencing and
  nuclear relocalization of cGAS, and disruption of STING ubiquitination by HBV polymerase.
  Despite these evasion tactics, activation of the cGAS-STING pathway through STING
  agonists can enhance antiviral activity by increasing the production of interferons
  (IFNs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; STING,
