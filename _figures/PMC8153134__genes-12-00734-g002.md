caption: Schematic illustration of Vitamin D metabolism. Vitamin D resulting either
  from cutaneous synthesis or, directly from the diet, is metabolized to 25(OH)D by
  the liver mitochondrial 25-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), and the microsomal 25-hydroxylase
  (CYP2R1). 25(OH)D is further metabolized to 1,25(OH)2D, by the renal 1α-hydroxylase
  (CYP27B1). 1,25(OH)2D may exerts its biologic effects through its receptor (VDR)
  or be catabolized by the 24-hydroxylse (CYP24A1). The net effect of 1,25(OH)2D on
  Ca/P metabolism is the increase in Ca/P serum concentration. PTH on the other hand,
  ensures increased levels of sCa and decreased levels of sPi. In this figure, the
  genetic defects associated with alterations in the Vitamin D metabolic pathway are
  marked in boxes, next to the respective enzymes.
