caption: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis signaling and regulation of
  hepatic functions. (A) Neuroendocrine signaling pathway of HPA axis. Stimuli of
  central nervous system (CNS) result in activation of HPA axis signaling, starting
  with the hypothalamus' increased secretion of corticotropic releasing hormone (CRH).
  CRH activates the anterior pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone
  (ACTH) which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to produce glucocorticoids (GC)
  and androgens (DHEAS). The adrenal steroids reach vital organs such as the liver
  where they bind specific receptors with transcriptional functions. GC bind to glucocorticoid
  receptors (GR) which are highly expressed in liver, and modulate the expression
  of many genes involved in energy production and homeostasis, growth and inflammation.
  The liver is mainly regulated by HPA axis, but there are interactions of HPA axis
  with other hypothalamus-dependent signaling pathways. While GC stimulate downstream
  pathways, they also trigger a negative feedback loop, inhibiting CRH and ACTH production
  in hypothalamus and pituitary, respectively. (B) HPA axis regulation of liver functions
  in response to CNS stimuli. The liver controls the rate of energy fuel distribution
  to the body depending on HPA axis signaling. In periods of rest and relaxation the
  activity of HPA axis is low so that the liver stores glucose into glycogen and has
  a reduced rate of lipolysis directing the lipids for storage in the adipose. In
  contrast, in times of intense activities of the body when large amounts of energy
  are needed, the HPA axis is stimulated and results in signaling the liver to produce
  glucose and put it in blood circulation, to oxidize lipids and to enhance the rate
  of ATP production in the whole body.
