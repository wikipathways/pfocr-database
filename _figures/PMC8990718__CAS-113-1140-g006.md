caption: Proposed model for the role of serum amyloid A 1 (SAA1) in promoting immunosuppressive
  neutrophils in breast cancer. Secreted by breast cancer cells, SAA1 activates the
  Toll‐like receptor 2 (TLR2)/myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88)
  regulatory pathway in neutrophils. Activation of TLR2/MYD88 stimulates the PI3K/nuclear
  factor‐κB (NF‐κB) signaling pathway; however, SAA1 bound to TLR2 receptor induces
  neutrophil apoptosis resistance through the p38 MAPK pathway. Both effects of SAA1
  on neutrophils promote the secretion of interleukin‐10 (IL‐10), arginase (Arg),
  and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) from neutrophils, which exert an immunosuppressive
  phenotype in breast cancer. Thus, there is a potential positive feedback loop between
  breast cancer cells and immunosuppressive neutrophils through SAA1
