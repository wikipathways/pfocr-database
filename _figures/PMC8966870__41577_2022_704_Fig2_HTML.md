caption: In mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (part a), loss of KLRG1-mediated
  inhibition in a population of KLRG1– type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) results
  in the production of IL-13 as well as of the chemokines CXCL2 and CXCL8. CXCL2 and
  CXCL8 recruit neutrophils to the tumour site, which, under the influence of IL-13,
  produce the immunosuppressive factor arginase 1 (ARG1). ARG1 suppresses T cell responses,
  ultimately promoting tumour growth. In mouse models of melanoma (part b) and pancreatic
  cancer (part c), IL-33 induces ILC2s that subsequently activate CD103+ dendritic
  cells (DCs) to prime antitumour CD8+ T cells. In the case of melanoma, the production
  of granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by ILC2s also recruits
  eosinophils to promote tumour rejection. Anti-PD1 therapy blocks cell-intrinsic
  inhibition of CD8+ T cells and ILC2s through the checkpoint molecule PD1 to further
  enhance tumour rejection. In mouse models of colorectal cancer (part d), PD1+ ILC2s
  enhance tumour growth, for example through the inhibition of natural killer (NK)
  cell responses and enhancing the responses of regulatory T (Treg) cells and myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs). Inhibition of PD1 signalling in ILC2s, through either
  pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ
  (PPARγ) pathway (which reduces PD1 expression) or anti-PD1 therapy promotes tumour
  rejection in colorectal cancer. These mechanistic insights from mouse models are
  supported by data derived from human cancer tissues (see inset schematic graphs).
  Genome-wide transcriptional data indicative of high intratumoural levels of IL33
  (in hepatocellular carcinoma (part a) and pancreatic cancer (part c)) or high levels
  of ILC2-associated gene expression (in melanoma (part b) and colorectal cancer (part
  d)) predict better survival in humans.
