caption: 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection of human cells causes IL-8 secretion,
  which leads to the recruitment of neutrophils. Neutrophil apoptosis is inhibited
  through degradation of XIAP and dampening of apoptotic caspase function, such as
  CASP3 and CASP8. The p38 MAP kinase and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are involved
  in this process. ROS production is inhibited by modulating NADPH oxidase assembly
  and/or regulation of gene expression. The ERK pathway is also affected by this pathogen.
  PSGL-1 signaling is activated during infection leading to actin reorganization via
  the molecules Syk and ROCK1. A. phagocytophilum entry also requires lipid rafts,
  caveolin-1, GPI–GAP and flotillin 1. Recently, Ub was shown to decorate the A. phagocytophilum
  vacuole. GPI–GAP: Glycoinositol phospholipid anchored proteins; ROS: Reactive oxygen
  species; Ub: Monoubiquitination.'
