caption: 'Reversibility of phospho-Smad3 signaling between tumor suppression and fibro-carcinogenesis.
  A: Additional treatment of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activates TGF-β
  receptor type I (TβRI), further leading to direct phosphorylation of Smad3C, which
  inhibits normally hepatocytic growth by upregulating p21WAF1 transcription; B: Mitogens
  drastically alter phospho-Smad3 signaling via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
  pathway, increasing nuclear fibro-carcinogenic pSmad3L activity while shutting down
  TGF-β-dependent cytostatic pSmad3C. Although the TGF-β signal weakly phosphorylates
  Smad3L in normal hepatocytes (dotted line), hepatitis viral components, including
  HBx, pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and somatic
  mutations such as Ras, additively transmit a fibro-carcinogenic signal through the
  JNK-dependent pSmad3L pathway to participate in hepatocytic growth and ECM deposition,
  possibly by stimulating transcription of c-Myc and PAI-1 genes. Linker phosphorylation
  of Smad3 indirectly prevents COOH-tail phosphorylation, pSmad3C-mediated p21WAF1
  transcription and cytostatic function; C: Either various JNK inhibitors or a Smad3
  mutation causing lack of JNK phosphorylation sites in the linker region can eliminate
  fibro-carcinogenic pSmad3L signaling, restoring or maintaining the tumor-suppressive
  pSmad3C signaling characteristic of mature hepatocytes.'
