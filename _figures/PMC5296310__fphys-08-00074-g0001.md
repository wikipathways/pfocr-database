caption: 'Putative stress signal network between ER stress and hypoxia in CKD. Abbreviations:
  Epo, erythropoietin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum CKD: chronic kidney disease; vLDL-R,
  very low lipoprotein receptor. Hypoxia and ER stress interact through a number of
  complicated pathways and lead to the exacerbation of CKD. The progression of CKD
  is caused via vascular damage, glomerular damage and tubulointerstitial injury.
  The mechanisms by which ER stress induces hypoxia include a change of oxygen demand
  in tissue, dysfunction of iron metabolism and reduction in EPO production. By contrast,
  chronic hypoxia induces ER stress through oxidative stress, epigenetic regulation
  by microRNA, overexpression of vLDL-R and the Akt pathway. These pathogenic factors
  could be targets for CKD therapy.'
