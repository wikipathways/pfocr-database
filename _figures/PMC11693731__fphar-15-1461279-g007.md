caption: The diagram of catalpol enhance Shh signaling pathway to promote neurogenesis
  and synaptogenesis by regulating mitochondria. Catalpol upregulated shh, then shh
  connected with ptch, which normally combined with smo. Smo was released to activate
  Gli-1. Gli-1 got into the nuclear and affect expression of proteins, which lead
  to the recovery of mitochondrial structure and fuction. Finally, these promoted
  Synaptogenesis and Neurogenesis
