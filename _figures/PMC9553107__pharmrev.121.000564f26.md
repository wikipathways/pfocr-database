caption: 'Possible molecular mechanisms for the actions of CO and CORM-2 on ion channels.
  CO released from CORM-2 binds to heme-containing ion channels through two possible
  mechanisms: 1) direct binding to the heme prosthetic group in the ion channel and
  2) binding to the free heme first before engaging the ion channel. CO binding modulates
  the function of ion channel; CO inhibits COX, thus increasing intracellular ROS
  production, which acts on redox-sensitive ion channels; CO interacts with NOS, thus
  affecting NO production, leading to direct modulation of NO-sensitive ion channels
  or through a second messenger pathway to regulate ion channels; CORM-2 itself exhibits
  CO-independent activities on ion channels as well.'
