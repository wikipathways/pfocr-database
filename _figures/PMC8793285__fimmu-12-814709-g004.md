caption: The cGAS-STING pathway in bacterial infection and bacterial immunity. (A)
  cGAS senses cytosolic dsDNA, catalyzes 2’3’-cGAMP that binds and activates STING
  anchored on ER, leading to IFN-I production. (B) The activity of the bacterial cGAS-like
  enzyme is inhibited by some metabolites or other unknown molecules in normal conditions.
  In response to phage infection, the inhibition of bacterial cGAS-like enzyme is
  relieved. Surprisingly, in addition to 3’3’-cGAMP, c-di-AMP, c-di-GMP, 2’3’-cGAMP
  can be generated by AbCdnD. The SAVED domain of Cap4 recognizes 2’3’-cGAMP, then
  its endonuclease domain cleaves viral DNA to defend against phage infection. Bacterial
  STING-TIR fusion protein activated by its ligands like c-di-GMP induces bacterial
  growth arrest by degrading NAD+. Upon activated by 3’3’-cGAMP, phospholipase degrades
  bacterial membrane to control phage infection.
