caption: '(1) Store‐operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) mediated by STIM1‐ORAI1 is triggered
  by high‐dose receptor stimulation, for example FPRs, PAFR or C5aR. Receptor engagement
  results in InsP3 generation, binding of its cognate receptor in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and the release of Ca2+ from ER‐Ca2+ stores. This initiates STIM1
  conformational change, translocation and gating of plasma‐membrane residing channels
  such as ORAI or TRPC. (2) SOCE contributes to the assembly and stabilization of
  the NADPH oxidase (NOX2), e.g. by activating PKC, in collaboration with additional
  factors such as DAG, to provide phosphorylation of the cytosolic NOX2 subunit p47phox.
  NOX2 produces superoxide (O2−) anions that in the phagosome are enzymatically transformed
  to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) by superoxide dismutase
  (SOD) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), respectively. (3) Phagocytosis, mediated by engagement
  of pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMP) with specific receptors, is dependent
  on SOCE. (Suggested) Phagocytosis is promoted by local Ca2+ signals fuelled by STIM1‐ORAI1
  interactions on phagosomes. (4) Low‐dose agonist receptor engagement, for example
  FPR activation by low doses (<100 nM) of its agonist fMLF, activates SOCE mediated
  by STIM2. (5) (Suggested) STIM2‐mediated SOCE is triggered by PAMP/Chemokine‐receptor
  engagement and involved in the Ca2+‐dependent phosphorylation and activation of
  downstream signalling cascades activating IKKα/β kinase and the transcription factor
  (TF, purple) NfkB, regulating the expression of target genes (e.g. cytokine expression).
  The MAP‐kinase pathway and the phosphorylation of kinases p38 and ERK1/2 were shown
  not to be regulated by STIM2. Dashed lines indicate multi‐step interactions, orange
  lines indicate STIM2 dependency, P indicates phosphorylation. Only the functions
  and molecular players linked to STIM‐mediated Ca2+signalling are depicted, excluding
  a broad range of factors contributing to ROS production, phagocytosis and cytokine
  synthesis. Abbreviations: MAP, mitogen‐activated protein (kinase); IKKα/β, IκB kinase
  alpha/beta; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase; NfkB, nuclear factor ‘kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer’
  of activated B‐cells; InsP3, inositol trisphosphate; FPR, formylated peptide receptor;
  PKC, protein kinase C.'
