caption: Biliverdin reductase signaling reduces hepatic fat accumulation. Biliverdin
  reductase A (BVRA) generation of unconjugated bilirubin from biliverdin activates
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα; ), which is a transcription
  factor that interacts with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to increase genes in the
  β-oxidation pathway that burn fatty acids in the mitochondria. BVRA activates Akt,
  which inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) through increased phosphorylation
  at serine 9 (S9) to prevent hepatic steatosis (). BVRA can also directly interact
  with GSK3β to regulate activity (). Inhibition of GSK3β results in increased activity
  of PPARα via decreased phosphorylation (P) at serine 73 (). Z, zinc finger DNA binding
  domains. The signaling functions of BVRA and bilirubin have been reviewed further
  by Hamoud et al. (), O’Brien et al. (), and Rochette et al. ().
