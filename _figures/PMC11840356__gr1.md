caption: Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Pathways of Apoptosis in Traumatic Brain Injury
  (TBI). Schematic representation illustrating mitochondrial dysfunction and its role
  in the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in TBI. Mitochondrial dysfunction
  is triggered by cellular insults such as calcium overload, oxidative stress, and
  mechanical injury. These events lead to the activation of Bid, which is cleaved
  into tBid. tBid translocates to the mitochondria, where it activates Bax while inhibiting
  Bcl-2, resulting in the release of cytochrome c and second mitochondria-derived
  activator of caspase (Smac) into the cytosol. Cytochrome c participates in the intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway by forming the apoptosome complex with Apaf-1 and caspase-9, which
  subsequently activates caspase-3. Smac enhances apoptosis by inhibiting inhibitor
  of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), thereby ensuring sustained caspase-3 activation. The
  activated caspase-3 leads to DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. Additionally, mitochondrial
  release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (Endo G) triggers
  caspase-independent cell death by inducing chromatin condensation and DNA cleavage.
  In parallel, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated by external death signals,
  such as the binding of Fas ligand (FasL) to their respective death receptors. This
  activates the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and caspase-8, which directly
  activates caspase-3. Caspase-8 also amplifies the intrinsic pathway through the
  cleavage of Bid into tBid, thereby enhancing mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis (See
  text for abbreviations). This figure is created with BioRender.com
