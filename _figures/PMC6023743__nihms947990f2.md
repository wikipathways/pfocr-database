caption: SM is the most abundant sphingophospholipid in the nucleus and a major component
  of chromatin (; ). Additionally, SM is also enriched in nuclear matrix (). Nuclear
  SM metabolism is independent from the Golgi/ER; its levels are in a dynamic state
  in the nucleus and modulated by high fat diet, stress, cell cycle and tissue regeneration.
  Rats on high fat diet revealed elevated SM and ceramide levels in both liver homogenates
  and hepatocellular nuclei with a shift towards greater fatty acid saturation status
  in SM and ceramide (Cer) (). Enzymes regulating SM biosynthesis and catabolism have
  been identified in the nucleus and nuclear fractions. In the nucleus, the primary
  pathway involved in generation of SM requires de novo biosynthesis of the Cer intermediate
  from palmitoyl-CoA and L-serine. Condensation of palmitoyl CoA and L-serine to 3-ketosphinganine
  is mediated by serine palmitoyl transferase, the rate limiting enzyme in SM biosynthesis,
  while other enzymes involved in Cer generation are 3-ketosphinganine reductase,
  Cer synthase and Cer desaturase (). Conversion of Cer to D-erythro-N-palmitoyl-sphingosine-1-phosphocholine
  (SM) requires SM synthase 1 or 2, which utilize phosphocholine derived from nuclear
  PC, which is present in both the chromatin and NE (). SM generated in the nucleus
  is metabolized by neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase), first detected in the nuclear
  matrix of rat ascites hepatoma cells () and subsequently in NE (), chromatin (),
  and nuclear matrix (). Another SM metabolizing enzyme that carries out the reverse
  reaction of SM-synthase, namely transfer of phosphocholine from SM to DAG with the
  formation of PC was detected in rat liver chromatin (). The role of SM-synthase
  and reverse SM-synthase in chromatin is unclear; however these two enzymes may modulate
  Cer/DAG ratio in the chromatin and thus regulate proliferation or apoptosis ().
  Recent studies on intra-nuclear SM localization in various cell types were carried
  out using nSMase conjugated to colloidal gold particles and transmission electron
  microscopy, which revealed preferential localization of SM within the peri-chromatin
  region (). Further, microinjection of SMase into living cell nucleus led to deterioration
  of nuclear structures supporting the intra-nuclear SM association with transcriptionally
  active ribosomal genes within the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus and
  possible involvement of SM in internal nuclear architecture and mRNA processing
  (). However, it is unclear if the resultant loss of SM or accumulation of Cer is
  responsible for the rapid degradation of intra-nuclear structure. It is not only
  SM, but also nSMase and SM synthase that appear to be associated with intra-nuclear
  complexes containing STAT3, a transcriptional factor, showing SM and its metabolizing
  enzymes to be part of the newly synthesized double stranded RNA in active chromatin
  (). Nuclear SM also interacts with CHOL and PC in nuclear lipid microdomains (NLMs)
  (; ) and the ratio of CHOL/SM/PC is higher in nuclear matrix during rat liver regeneration
  suggesting an inverse relationship between nuclear matrix fluidity and DNA synthesis
  (). Thus, NLMs may facilitate cross-talk between glycerolipids, sphingolipids, CHOL
  and lipid mediators generated by metabolic enzymes, which regulate cellular processes
  such as proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle in normal and pathological situations.
  Interestingly, NLMs isolated from hepatocytes and hepatoma cells showed a shift
  in the ratio between very long chain fatty acid (C24:0) and long chain fatty acid
  (C16:0). In hepatoma cells, NLMs had a higher proportion of C16:0 fatty acid compared
  to C24:0 in SM fraction, an increase in the expression of STAT3, Raf1 and PKC δ
  and a decrease in relative levels of vitamin D receptors () indicating a potential
  link between enhanced dynamic properties of NLMs with increasing shuttling of signaling
  proteins in the nucleus of cancer cells. Increased expression of PKC δ and SM synthase
  and decreased SMase activities in murine melanoma cell line compared to the wild
  type resulted in elevated DAG and decreased ceramide pools in the nucleus, (). The
  inhibition of SMase, in turn, may increase nuclear SM-synthase activity and enrichment
  of nuclear SM pool or alter the ratio of Cer to DAG levels in the nucleus to modulate
  nuclear signaling. Interestingly, exposure of non-Hodgkin lymphoblastic lymphoma
  cells to gentamycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, stimulated cytosolic SMase, inhibited
  nuclear SMase, increased nuclear SM-synthase activity with elevated nuclear SM levels
  and induced cell death (). Further analysis of nuclear fractions and NLMs using
  lipidomics and proteomics should allow identification, quantification and association
  between SM and its metabolites with proteins in the nucleus, chromatin and nuclear
  matrix.
