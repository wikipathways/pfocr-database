caption: 'Main metabolic and redox circuits regulated by the inhibition of the H+-ATP
  synthase by inhibitory factor 1 (IF1). Dephosphorylated IF1 (green rod) inhibits
  the H+-ATP synthase (structure) when bound to the enzyme, while IF1 phosphorylation
  (yellow) prevents its binding and hence its inhibitory activity (). The inhibition
  of a relevant pool of molecules of H+-ATP synthase by IF1 reduces cellular ATP availability,
  promoting metabolic reprogramming to an enhanced glycolysis and the activation of
  AMPK (–). Moreover, IF1 inhibition of the H+-ATP synthase triggers mitochondrial
  hyperpolarization because prevents H+ backflow through the enzyme enhancing the
  production of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) that activate the canonical NFκB pathway
  (, , ). Activation of NFκB triggers the induction of different tissue-specific mitohormetic
  programs in the nucleus of the cell. In colon cancer cells overexpressing IF1, these
  programs favor proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cell death (). In transgenic
  mice overexpressing IF1 in neurons or liver, promote the activation of survival
  pathways and antioxidant defenses (, ). In transgenic mice overexpressing IF1 in
  the intestine, the activated programs modulate the immune response of the tissue,
  favoring the development of an anti-inflammatory phenotype (). Abbreviations: p-IF1,
  phosphorylated IF1; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; NFκB, nuclear factor kappa
