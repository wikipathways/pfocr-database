caption: Exacerbation of AD pathology through gradual dysregulation of p53-induced
  adaptive responses. Upon chronic exposure to mild/subacute stress, p53 becomes activated
  through ROS or through the induction of DNA damage sensing genes, such as ATM kinase.
  Following p53 activation, several antioxidant genes (e.g., TIGAR, MnSOD, and PGC-1α)
  are upregulated to subsequently restore cellular damage. In the AD brain, levels
  of ATM are strongly upregulated. However, there appears to be a defect in the downstream
  canonical p53 pathway, as p53-induced adaptive responses are progressively dysregulated
  during the continuum of the disease, exacerbating AD pathology. AD, Alzheimer’s
  disease; ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase;
  PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c coactivator-1a; TIGAR, TP53-induced
  glycolysis regulatory phosphatase; ROS, reactive oxygen species
