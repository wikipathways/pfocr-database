caption: Proposed molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of statins in coronavirus
  disease 2019. SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019, enters the
  cell by binding to ACE2. Once in the cell, SARS-CoV-2 causes ACE2 down-regulation,
  thus reducing its protective effects mediated through conversion of angiotensin
  II to angiotensin [, , , , , , ]. Statins upregulate ACE2. Coronaviruses are also
  known to induce a pro-inflammatory host response via the activation of the TLR–MYD88–NF-κB
  pathway, which is inhibited by statins. Finally, statins may also reduce viral entry
  by depleting cholesterol content in cell membrane, but this effect remains controversial.ACE2-angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2; MYD88-myeloid differentiation factor 88; NF-κB- nuclear factor kappa light
  chain enhancer of activated B cells; SARS-CoV-2- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2;
