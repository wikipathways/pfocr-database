caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways activated through CD44.
  (A) Interaction between adaptor molecules Ankyrin (blue) and Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin
  (green) with the intracellular domain CD44-ICD. This interaction triggers modifications
  in the cytoskeletal disposition and the activation of specific pathways (e.g., c-Met
  activation, Ras-MAPK cascade, Snail/β-catenin translocation, or PI3K-AKT pathway
  activation). As consequence, this via is involved in epithelial‐mesenchymal transition
  mechanisms (EMT) and the activation of angiogenesis, proliferation, and invasion
  mechanisms. (B) Schematic representations of CD44-ICD signaling via, including the
  sequential proteolytic cleavage of the CD44 protein. 1) The ectodomain shedding
  is induced by PKC, Ca2+ influx or cytokines that activate the MMPs (ADAM17, ADAM10
  and MMP14, respectively). 2) The presenilin-y-secretase complex is activated and
  processes the ICD through the specific cleavage sites in the transmembrane domain
  (residues L-A and residues I-A). GSIs (γ-secretase inhibitors) and the merlin protein
  can inhibit this second proteolytic processing. 3) The ICD is released and translocated
  to the nucleus upregulating stemness factors, activators of cell proliferation,
  epithelial‐mesenchymal transition mechanisms (EMT) regulators and CD44 itself.
