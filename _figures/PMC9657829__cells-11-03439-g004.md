caption: 'A schematic representation of the selected mechanisms in the pathogenesis
  of AD. Under physiological conditions, APP is cleaved in the non-amyloidogenic pathway
  (not shown). In the absence of SORL1 due to epigenetic silencing or mutation, APP
  is shunted into the late endosomal pathway. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP enters
  the late endosome, where it is cleaved by the β-secretase (BACE1), and then by γ-secretase.
  AICD enters the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor, whereas the Aβ40/42
  peptides and sAPPβ are secreted to the extracellular space. An imbalance of Aβ production
  and its clearance from the brain promotes Aβ aggregation and deposition. The Aβ
  aggregates can activate the kinases involved in the tau pathway, leading to tau
  hyperphosphorylation. The aberrant hyperphosphorylation of tau causes p-tau to be
  separated from microtubules (MTs), leading to MTs depolymerization and axonal degeneration.
  The disruption of the tau pathway leads to the accumulation of tau aggregates to
  form oligomers and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) within neurons. The p-tau oligomers
  (tau seeds) can be released into the extracellular space and taken up by unaffected
  neurons. The tau aggregates sequester BRCA1 protein in the cytoplasm and prevent
  it from executing its physiological function, leading to the accumulation of DNA
  damage induced by Aβ. Red and green colors highlighted hypermethylation and hypomethylation,
  respectively. AICD: amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain; APP: amyloid
  precursor protein; BRCA1: breast cancer type 1; CAMK2: calcium/calmodulin-dependent
