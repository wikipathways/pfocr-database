caption: Warburg Effect and Metabolic Disorders with Features of Metabolite Shunting(A)
  The observed Warburg effect in cancerous cells is a metabolic phenomenon of aerobic
  glycolysis, that is, diversion of glucose via pyruvate to lactate even in the presence
  of abundant oxygen. In addition to the Warburg effect, other important features
  of metabolism in cancerous cells include increased synthesis of nucleotides to synthesize
  DNA, diversion of citrate to cytosolic acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis, and
  increased need for glutamine, a precursor for alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG), intrinsically
  linked to the HIF-pathway.(B) The sum of metabolic derangements observed in GSD
  Ia, where the inability to convert G6P to glucose results in increased shunting
  of G6P to P5P pathway. G6P is also used as a substrate for fatty acid and triglyceride
  synthesis. Oversupply of lactate and pyruvate through Cori cycle and hepatic gluconeogenesis
  could result in alteration of the ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD+ ratios in favor of tumorigenesis.(C)
  Metabolic abnormalities highlighting the role of Krebs cycle intermediates—succinate,
  fumarate, and α-KG—in the regulation of the HIF-dependent pathway. Impaired function
  of Krebs cycle might adversely affect oxidative phosphorylation and thus lead to
  cell-autonomous shunting of glucose to pyruvate and lactate.(D) Citrin deficiency
  is characterized by increased metabolism of simple carbohydrates resulting in high
  NADH/NAD+ and lactate/pyruvate ratios, which can also be observed under the Warburg
  effect. Fatty liver in citrin deficiency implies increased flux of citrin via acetyl-CoA
  for fatty acid synthesis.
