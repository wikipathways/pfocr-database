caption: Pathological regulation of the mTOR pathway in neurological disease. Dysregulation
  of the mTOR pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a variety of different
  neurological diseases. In some disorders (shown in black boxes), there is convincing
  evidence of a direct molecular or genetic link between the disease and a specific
  upstream component of the mTOR pathway, specifically TSC and hamartin/tuberin, polyhydramnios,
  megalencephaly and symptomatic epilepsy syndrome (PMSE) and STRADα, and glioblastoma
  and PTEN. In other disorders (shown in gray boxes), the mechanistic link to the
  mTOR pathway is not as well established, although there is some evidence that traumatic
  brain injury (TBI), other acquired epilepsies, and fragile X syndrome may involve
  activation of PI3K/Akt. The least is known about how neurodegenerative disorders,
  such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s disease, affect the mTOR pathway,
  although downstream effects likely involve regulation of autophagy, clearance of
  protein aggregates, and neuronal death mechanisms. See legend to  for other abbreviations.

  description: Pathological regulation of the mTOR pathway in neurological disease.
    Dysregulation of the mTOR pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of
