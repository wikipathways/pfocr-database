caption: Pathway impact (A) and network mapping (B) of differential metabolites in
  T2 after administration. A, Bubble plots of the metabolic pathways affected in estrous
  versus anestrous subjects. The lighter and smaller bubbles represent least affected
  pathways, whereas the larger and darker bubbles represent the more markedly affected
  pathways. B, Blue font represents upregulation, red font represents downregulation
