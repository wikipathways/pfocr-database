caption: Amyloidogenic pathways of amyloid-beta peptide development in Alzheimer’s
  disease and islet amyloid polypeptide in diabetes. (1) Proteolytic cleavage of the
  transmembrane glycoprotein β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase (amyloidogenic
  pathway) into the extracellular sAPPβ and the membrane β-C-terminal membrane-bound
  (CTF-β) 89/99 or (1′) by alpha secretase resulting into extracellular sAPPα and
  membrane CTF-α 83 fragment (non-amyloidogenic pathway). (2) Further cleavage of
  the CTF-β fragments at multiple sites by γ-secretase, resulting in the formation
  of extracellular Aβ 40–42 monomers and intracellular APP intracellular domain (AICD)
  that can translocate to the nucleus (2′) CTF-α cleavage by γ-secretase generating
  non-toxic extracellular P3 peptide and intracellular AICD. (3) Aβ conformational
  rearrangement from α-helical structure to β-sheet secondary structure monomers.
  (4) Assemblage of β-sheet Aβ monomers into soluble oligomers responsible for neuronal
  toxicity through mitochondrial dysfunction and membrane receptor binding. (5) Gradual
  aggregation of Aβ oligomers into insoluble amyloid fibrils and (6) deposits of amyloid
  senile plaques characteristic of AD. The initially 89 amino acid long islet amyloid
  polypeptide (IAPP) pre-pro peptides/along with the pro-insulin precursor/are synthesized
  in the endoplasmic reticulum of the pancreatic islet β-cells and then processed
  by enzymatic cleavage at both C-terminal and N-terminal to 67 amino acid pro-IAPP
  peptide. The pro-IAPP intermediate is subsequently cleaved by enzymes/prohormone
  convertase in the Golgi apparatus and in the secretory granules to form the 37 amino
  acid IAPP molecules. Mature IAPP stored together with insulin in the secretory granules
  may undergo misfolding processes, leading to potentially toxic intracellular and
  subsequent extracellular IAPP oligomers. Overexpression of the human IAPP molecules
  further induces IAPP aggregation into amyloid fibrils and plaques deposited intra-
  and extracellularly. IAPP oligomers may enter in the brain by crossing the blood–brain
  barrier, and IAPP deposits may contribute to AD pathology. Aβ, amyloid-β peptide;
  APP, amyloid precursor protein; AICD, cytoplasmic polypeptide; BACE1, beta-secretase
  1; BBB, blood–brain barrier.
