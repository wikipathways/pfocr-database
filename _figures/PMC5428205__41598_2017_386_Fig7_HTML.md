caption: Schematic representation of the putative signaling pathways underlying the
  migration-stimulating effect of c-MWCNTs on RAW264.7 macrophages based on the present
  study and related reports. The c-MWCNTs are internalized and act intracellularly.
  After entering the cells, c-MWCNTs first activate PLC, leading to hydrolysis of
  PIP2 and production of IP3 and diacyl glycerol (DAG). IP3 triggers calcium release
  via the Ca2+-releasing channel IP3 receptor (IP3R) and leads to depletion of the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER-resident STIM1 senses ER depletion and translocates
  to the ER-PM junctions and thus activates the Orai1 calcium channel and generates
  CRAC current (Ca2+ influx). Ca2+ influx, together with Ca2+ release, triggers the
  downstream signaling cascades responsible for macrophage activation and migration.
  Activated RAW264.7 macrophages release cytokines including chemokines, further stimulating
  macrophage migration. In addition, the KCa3.1 channel is activated by [Ca2+]i elevation
  and mediates K+ efflux, thus resulting in repolarization of the membrane potential
  (Vm) and providing a feedback signal to the activated macrophages.
