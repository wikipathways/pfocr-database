caption: Compensatory up-regulation of the expression and activity of chaperones and
  the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) prevents the accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional
  proteins in vascular cells subjected to the stress of cardiovascular risk factor
  exposure. The UPS activity also contributes to the classical activation pathway
  of nuclear factor kappa-B and thereby to inflammation and cell proliferation. With
  the formation and growth of a metabolically active atherosclerotic plaque, there
  is further production of misfolded and damaged proteins in the progression phase.
  Once the classical protein quality mechanisms are overwhelmed and fail, these dysfunctional
  proteins accumulate (and aggregate) and autophagy remains the final clearance pathway.
  The accumulating proteins can undergo further oxidation, ubiquitination, and cross-linking.
  As yet another unique characteristic, beta-pleated sheets can be formed and hence
  amyloid fibrils via the intermediate steps of pre-amyloid oligomers and protofibrils.
  In addition to intracellular proteins, proteins in the extracellular matrix can
  undergo conformational changes. For instance, oxidation and phospholipid hydrolysis
  of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) produces oxidatively modified and electronegative
  particles with unfolding of the apolipoprotein components. Recognition of amyloid-like
  fibrils by CD36 (and conceivably the receptor for advanced glycation end-products)
  leads to the production of reactive oxygen species, chemokines, and cytokines, which
  contributes further to the atherosclerotic disease process, including its complication
  phase. Modified from [].
