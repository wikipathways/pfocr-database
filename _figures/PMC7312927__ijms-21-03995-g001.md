caption: 'Schematic representation of the midbrain dopaminergic pathways. The figure
  illustrates in a schematic representation the two dopaminergic pathways originating
  from the midbrain (delimited by a red rectangle). The ventral tegmental area (VTA)
  and the substantia nigra (SN) in the adult ventral midbrain are visualized by anti-tyrosine
  hydroxylase antibodies. On the left: the nigrostriatal pathway connects the SN pars
  compacta in the midbrain with the dorsal striatum (i.e., caudate nucleus and putamen)
  in the forebrain. The main function of the nigrostriatal pathway is to control voluntary
  movement through basal ganglia motor loops. Degeneration of SN dopaminergic neurons
  leads to diminished concentrations of dopamine in the caudate-putamen. Degeneration
  of this pathway causes Parkinson’s disease (see text). On the right: the meso-cortico-limbic
  system pathway connects the VTA in the midbrain to the ventral striatum (i.e., nucleus
  accumbens) and to the prefrontal cortex. It regulates motivation, emotions, reward
  and cognitive functions. Dysfunction of this pathway is associated to schizophrenia,
  drug addiction, attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), depression and chronic
  pain (see text).'
