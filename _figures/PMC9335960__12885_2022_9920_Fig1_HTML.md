caption: Forest plots of altered metabolites identified in meta-analysis (A) Forest
  plot of 19 metabolomic studies using AUC values and computed standard error. Heterogeneity
  (I2) was assessed for fixed and random effects (B) Forest plot of lipid metabolites
  retrieved from 11 studies (C) Forest plot of carbohydrate metabolites retrieved
  from 6 studies (D) Forest plot of amino acid metabolites retrieved from 13 studies.
  Metabolic pathway analysis using metaboAnalyst identified (E) Enriched glycerophospholipid
  pathway for circulatory metabolites detected in healthy control and PDAC. Metabolites
  marked in red are altered in PDAC patients as compared to healthy controls (F) metaboAnalyst
  analysis identified enriched arginine and glutamate metabolism for circulatory metabolites
  detected in PDAC as compared to healthy controls/chronic pancreatitis. Metabolites
  are marked in red and their fold changes are in blue color (G) metaboAnalyst analysis
  identified enriched sphingomyelin pathway and TCA cycle for circulatory metabolites
  detected in PDAC and CP patients. Metabolites are marked in red and their fold changes
  are in blue color
