caption: Regulation of the early myogenic transcriptional program by the kinome. The
  figure shows the mechanisms by which the kinases described in the text coordinate
  embryonic precursor activation, myoblast proliferation and the prevention of premature
  myoblast differentiation. Wnt1 and Wnt7a stimulation of precursor cells activates
  protein kinase A (PKA), which, through the phosphorylation of CREB, induces the
  expression of the myogenic transcription factors Myf5, MyoD and Pax3, resulting
  in the myogenic commitment of embryonic precursors. PKA then prevents the premature
  differentiation of proliferating myoblasts by phosphorylating and inhibiting the
  transcriptional activity of MEF2D. The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate
  cell cycle transitions and are activated at the appropriate time by the availability
  of their respective cyclins, depicted in the boxed inset. Cell cycle progression
  is achieved by the CDKs through the phosphorylation of Rb, which, when phosphorylated,
  is unable to bind and inhibit the E2F family of transcription factors that promote
  the expression of genes involved in cell division. Phosphorylation of Rb by the
  CDKs also prevents it from associating with and transactivating MyoD, thereby inhibiting
  cell cycle exit and differentiation. Cell cycle exit is further prevented by the
  proteolytic degradation of MyoD that results from direct CDK phosphorylation. The
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is activated by growth factors such
  as fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), although the substrates
  ERK acts on to promote proliferation and inhibit differentiation are unknown. IGF
  also activates the Akt1 pathway and stimulates proliferation when myoblasts are
  subconfluent. Phosphorylation of FoxO1 by Akt1 prevents this transcription factor
  from accumulating in the nucleus, inhibiting the expression of genes involved in
  cell cycle exit, such as p27.

  description: Regulation of the early myogenic transcriptional program by the kinome.
    The figure shows the mechanisms by which the kinases described in the text coordinate
    embryonic precursor activation, myoblast proliferation and the prevention of premature
    myoblast differentiation. Wnt1 and Wnt7a stimulation of precursor cells activates
    protein kinase A (PKA), which, through the phosphorylation of CREB, induces the
    expression of the myogenic transcription factors Myf5, MyoD and Pax3, resulting
    in the myogenic commitment of embryonic precursors. PKA then prevents the premature
    differentiation of proliferating myoblasts by phosphorylating and inhibiting the
    transcriptional activity of MEF2D. The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate
    cell cycle transitions and are activated at the appropriate time by the availability
    of their respective cyclins, depicted in the boxed inset. Cell cycle progression
    is achieved by the CDKs through the phosphorylation of Rb, which, when phosphorylated,
    is unable to bind and inhibit the E2F family of transcription factors that promote

    CDKs also prevents it from associating with and transactivating MyoD, thereby

    The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is activated by growth factors
    such as fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), although
    the substrates ERK acts on to promote proliferation and inhibit differentiation
    are unknown. IGF also activates the Akt1 pathway and stimulates proliferation
