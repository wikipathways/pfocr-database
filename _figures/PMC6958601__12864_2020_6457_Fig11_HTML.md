caption: A schematic showing gene expression in TB, ER and FER in Ramie. Gene activation
  in FER for phloem development is clearly evidenced in our study. Secondary cell
  wall synthesis genes are up-regulated in both ER and FER but more activated in FER.
  The genes in the ethylene pathway and gibberellins acids biosynthesis are activated
  during the maturation of ramie stem
papertitle: Comparative transcriptomics of stem bark reveals genes associated with
  bast fiber development in Boehmeria nivea L. gaud (ramie).
