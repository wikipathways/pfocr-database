caption: Oxygen-substrate stoichiometry in brain. Substrates are delivered to brain
  by blood where they are metabolized by brain cells that consume oxygen. Glucose
  (Glc) and the glucose analog fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) are phosphorylated by hexokinase
  (HK) to their respective hexose-6-phosphate (P). FDG-6-P is trapped in the cell
  where phosphorylated, whereas Glc-6-P is further metabolized via the glycolytic
  pathway to a 3-carbon product that can be oxidized in mitochondria as either as
  pyruvate (Pyr) via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in all cells and pyruvate carboxylase
  (PC) in astrocytes, or as lactate (Lac) that may be taken up into mitochondria and
  converted to Pyr by mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (see text and legend
  to Figure ). Glc-6-P can also enter the pentose phosphate shunt pathway (PPP) to
  generate NADPH for management of oxidative stress or for use in biosynthetic reactions.
  The PPP also generates ribulose-5-P that is a precursor for nucleic acid synthesis
  and intermediates are rearranged to produce fructose-6-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P
  that can re-enter the glycolytic pathway and fructose-6-P may recycled into the
  PPP. In astrocytes, Glc-6-P is also stored as glycogen. Lactate can be released
  from brain when non-oxidative metabolism is upregulated more than the oxidative
  pathways. Lactate and ketone bodies can also be taken up from blood and oxidized,
  particularly in suckling mammals during development, as well as during exercise
  and starvation, respectively, when their blood levels rise. Different substrates
  consume different amounts of oxygen when completely oxidized, and the relationship
  between total oxygen consumption and total utilization of various substrates is
  illustrated. The oxygen-glucose index (OGI) is based on the stoichiometry of glucose
  oxidation, and assumes no other substrates are metabolized. The same OGI will be
  obtained whether Lac or Pyr is oxidized, as long as there is no uptake of these
  substrates from blood. Metabolism of other substrates is taken into account by the
  oxygen-carbohydrate (OCI) and oxygen-carbohydrate-ketone body (OCKI) indicies. Note
  that Lac and Pyr are converted to glucosyl units. Ketone bodies, acetoacetate (AcAc)
  and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), are metabolized in mitochondria.
