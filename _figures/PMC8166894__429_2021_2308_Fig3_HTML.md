caption: Schematic representation of putative mechanisms and molecular pathways contributing
  to dendritic spine remodeling induced by general anesthetics. The majority of general
  anesthetics activate Ca2+ influx via stimulation of voltage-gated calcium channels
  (VGCC), ligand-activated receptor channels (LARC) or stimulation of G-protein coupled
  receptors (GPCR), with the downstream enhancement of VGCC. An increase of intracellular
  free Ca2+ can also cause Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from intracellular stores
  and primarily from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As a second messenger, Ca2+ binds
  and activates calmodulin, which acts as part of a Ca2+ signal transduction pathway
  by modifying its interactions with various target proteins, with the Ca2+calmodulin-dependent
  kinase II (CaMKII) playing a key role in controlling molecular processes underlying
  the stability and dynamics of the cytoskeletal protein actin, governing the dynamics
  of dendritic spine remodeling and plasticity. This involves four major signaling
  pathways mediated via several members of the Rho family of small GTPase, PAK-phosphatases
  slingshot, Cdc42, WASP, IRSp53 proteins converging on two effectors—cofilin and
  Arp2/3 proteins. While the former, cofilin, when activated, causes severing of polymerizing
  actin with shrinkage of dendritic spines (grey arrowhead), Arp2/3 promotes the assembly
  of actin and branching (green arrowhead), with enlargement and stabilization of
  dendritic spines
