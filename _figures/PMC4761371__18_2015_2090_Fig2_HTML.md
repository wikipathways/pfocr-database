caption: The RhoGTPase switch at the cell–cell contact. a Cadherin-11 sequesters Trio
  to the contact where it is inhibited. Trio activates Rac1 and inhibits RhoA. As
  Trio is sequestered and inhibited at the contact, Rac1 cannot be activated and the
  inhibition on RhoA is lifted. It is possible that Cadherin-11 inhibits Trio via
  the recruitment of the polarity protein Par3. b N-cadherin may be influencing the
  behaviour of the RhoGTPases through several means. One possibility is that it recruits
  Par3 to the contact and that in turn inhibits Trio. Secondly N-cadherin leads to
  the inhibition of the GEF—Tiam1 via its association with nm23. Nm23 binds and inhibits
  Tiam1 at the contact site. Tiam1 is an activator of Rac1 and its inhibition prevent
  the activation of Rac1 at the contact site. Interaction with p120-catenin is the
  determining factor influencing the differential behaviour of the RhoGTPases downstream
  of E- and N-cadherin. It is likely that p120-catenin is signalling through an as
  yet unidentified means leading to the activation of RhoA and inhibition of Rac1
  at the contact. c The non-canonical Wnt-planar cell polarity pathway is activated
  by Wnt11 binding to the receptor Frizzled. Dishevelled, Prickle1 and Strabismus
  are recruited to the receptor at the contact upon a collision. The activation of
  this pathway results in the activation of RhoA near the contact. Due to the shared
  component p120-catenin it is possible N-cadherin binding stimulates signalling through
  the planar cell polarity pathway. d EphA binds EphrinA from the neighbouring cell.
  This stimulates bidirectional signalling that results in the activation of the GEF—Vav2.
  Vav2 in turn activates RhoA
