caption: A schematic depiction of the nitric oxide-induced cGMP signaling pathway
  in developmental, abiotic and biotic stress processes. During water stress, an increase
  in the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) activates the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO).
  Subsequently, NO stimulates the NO-dependent guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP (;
  ). Concurrently, ABA also activates the production of H2O2 which reacts with NO
  to produces reactive nitrogen species (RNS; ). A reaction between the RNS and cGMP
  produce 8-Nitro-cGMP which in turn activates the accumulation of cytoplasmic calcium,
  [Ca2+]cyt and the SLOW ANION CHANNEL 1 (SLAC1) which results in stomatal closure.
  Similarly, during a pathogenic attack, plants close their stomata; however, the
  NO-cGMP pathway is initiated by the hormone salicylic acid (SA; ). Furthermore,
  during a pathogenic attack, NO-cGMP signaling cascade activates the transcription
  of the pathogenic marker, PAL in an SA-independent manner (). Furthermore, NO-cGMP
  signaling pathway is important during pollen tubule development. NO-cGMP signaling
  pathway is also involved in adventitious root formation stimulated by exogenous
  and endogenous chemicals, for example, N-Acyl-homoserine-lactones (AHLs) produced
  by gram negative rizobacteria. AHLs promote polar auxin transport which activates
  the NO-cGMP dependent signaling cascade leading to the development of adventitious
  root formation (; ; ). Similarly, gravitropism bending requires the auxin induced
  NO-cGMP signaling pathway ().
