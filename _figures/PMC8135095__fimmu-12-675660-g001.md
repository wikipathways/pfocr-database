caption: The induction of microglial polarization by several transcription factors.
  Activation of high mobility histone 1 (HMG1) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 or TLR4
  promotes the pro-inflammatory phenotypic polarization of microglia. Interferon-gamma
  (IFN-γ) promotes the pro-inflammatory phenotypic polarization of microglia through
  the signaling sensors signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1
  and Janus kinase (JAK). This series of processes involves the nuclear factor kappa
  B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. On the other hand, STAT6 accumulates under the action
  of IL-4 and is responsible for the transcription of M2 phenotype-related genes.
  The sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor signaling pathway downregulates the expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhances anti-inflammatory responses following
  intracerebral hemorrhage.
