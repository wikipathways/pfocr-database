caption: Left, the mechanism, described by , for the proapoptotic function of TSP1
  or 2. HRGP, histidine-rich glycoprotein. Right, the coordinate and integrated interaction
  of TSP1 or 2 with VLDLR and VEGF-bound VEGFR, together with the activation of Src
  and the adapter protein, Shc, lead to an inhibition of the PI3K and MAPK pathways
  and consequently of cell cycle progression in ECs. The bridging of the VLDLR and
  the VEGFA-ligated VEGFR by TSP1 or 2 is conjectural. The mechanisms encompassed
  by the bracket are based on analogous pathways recently described for the activated
  PDGF receptor and LRP1 (see Discussion). As indicated by arrow 1, the activated
  VEGFR phosphorylates an NPXY sequence on the VLDLR. Arrow 2 indicates that the kinase
  domain of the VEGFR also activates Src, which phosphorylates the VLDLR, and Shc,
  which bridges the two receptors by virtue of its two docking domains, SH2 and PTB.
  The coordinate action of these reactions then leads, by mechanisms that have not
  yet been defined, to the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt (3) and MAPK (4) pathways and
  the consequent inhibition of cell cycle progression.
