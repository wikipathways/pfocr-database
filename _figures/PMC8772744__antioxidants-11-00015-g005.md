caption: Medicinal plants and bioactive compounds with anti-fibrotic activity. The
  canonical transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFβ1) pathway involves the binding
  of TGFβ1 to transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR). This leads to the
  phosphorylation and activation of small mothers against decapentaplegic 2/3 (SMAD
  2/3). SMAD7, the inhibitory SMAD, inhibits the activation of SMAD 2/3 by the TGFBR.
  SMAD 7 is negatively regulated by microRNA-21 (miR-21). Active SMAD 2/3 binds the
  common SMAD (SMAD 4) and translocates to the nucleus to drive the transcription
  of genes encoding proteins that make up the extracellular matrix, proteins that
  are involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and pro-fibrotic miRNA. The
  advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and angiotensin II (ANG 2) drive the activation
  of MAPKs that activate SMAD 2/3. Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the inhibition
  of SMAD 2/3. Chrysin, rutin, and proanthocyanins inhibit the receptor for advanced
  glycation end products (RAGE), thus reducing the activation of MAPKs. In addition,
  propolis inhibits the activation of SMAD 2/3 by MAPKs. Astragalus membranaceus increases
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and the level NO. A high level of NO inhibits
  the activation of SMAD 2/3. Rutin directly activates SMAD 7, leading to a reduction
  in activation of SMAD 2/3. Carya cathayensis inhibits miR-21, the negative modulator
  of SMAD7. Phylanthus niruri, propolis, bee venom, chrysin, ursolic acid, naringenin,
  genistein, rutin, betulinic acid reduce the level of TGFβ1, thus inhibiting the
  activation of TGFBR. Apigenin activates AMPK leading to a decrease in the level
  of TGFβ1.

    The canonical transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFβ1) pathway involves the binding
