caption: mTOR Signaling Pathway. Collectively growth factors and amino acids (via
  Rags mediated binding of mTORC1 to Rheb) activate mTORC1. Insulin binds to its IRS1
  that activates PI3K and recruits PDPK1 from cell membrane via to PIP3 conversion.
  PI3K and mTORC2 phoshorylate Akt at Thr308 and Ser473, respectively. Through inhibition
  of TSC1-TSC2 and FOXO, Akt stimulates mTORC1 to promote mRNA translation and inhibits
  apoptosis by phosphorylating S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Negative feedback inhibition of IRS1
  is initiated by S6K1 to downregulate glucose metabolism. PTEN regulates mutagenic
  stimulation of PI3K (via PIP3 to PIP2 reconversion) to keep cellular propagation
  within controlled levels while FOXO is responsible to control hyperactivation of
  mTORC1.
