caption: (A) Extracellular APP is cleaved by β-secretase (BACE) producing soluble
  N-terminal fragments (sAPPβ) shed to the extracellular space. It is currently believed
  that the remaining membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (APP-CTFβ) is then cleaved
  by γ-secretase at several γ sites to produce Aβ peptides with variable c-terminal
  ends, Aβ 40 and 42 being the most abundant. Cleavage of APP-CTFβ by γ-secretase
  at the ε site produces AICD released to the cytosol. The temporal relationship of
  the γ-secretase cleavages however is unclear and available data are also consistent
  with the suggestion that γ-secretase cleaves only at the ε site of APP-CTFβ releasing
  AICD (see text). The carboxy terminus of the remaining membrane peptide is then
  “trimmed” by carboxypeptidases producing Aβ peptides of variable lengths (not shown
  here). Produced soluble Aβ peptides may then aggregate to form amyloid depositions.
  (B) Cleavage of APP and other transmembrane proteins by ADAMs near the extracellular
  face of the plasma membrane, produces a shed ectodomain (N-terminal fragment; NTF)
  and a membrane bound peptide termed CTF1 (C-Terminal Fragment 1) that is then processed
  by γ-secretase at the ε site to produce CTF2 peptides (C-terminal Fragment 2) released
  to the cytosol. CTF2 peptides have been shown to function in cellular signaling
  (green arrow, see also text). This processing pathway may be stimulated by calcium
  influx through NMDA receptor and/or by ligand binding to receptors (). Brown arrow
  indicates an APP-like ε-cleavage that occurs two or three residues inside the membrane
  while the blue arrow indicates a cadherin-like cleavage that occurs on the membrane/cytoplasm
  interface (see also text). The red bracket indicates the position of Aβ sequence
  of APP cleaved in the non-amyloidogenic (α-secretase) processing pathway
