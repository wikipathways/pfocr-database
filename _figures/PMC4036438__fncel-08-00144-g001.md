caption: Schematic diagram of proposed CXCR4–CXCR7 crosstalk affecting major signaling
  pathways related to cell survival, proliferation, and migration. CXCL12 binds to
  CXCR4 and CXCR7, which can form homodimers or heterodimers. CXCR4–CXCR7 heterodimerization
  induces a conformational change of CXCR4/G-proteins and blocks signaling. CXCL12–CXCR4
  interaction activated by CXCL12 triggers GPCR signaling through PI3K/Akt, PLC/IP3,
  and ERK1/2 pathways, and mobilization of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum via inhibition
  of adenyl cyclase mediated cAMP production, thus regulating cell survival, proliferation,
  and chemotaxis. Beta-arrestin pathway can be activated through GRK to internalize
  CXCR4. When CXCR7 binds CXCL12, activation of the β-arrestin may lead to scavenging
  of CXCL12. In glioblastoma CXCL12/CXCR7 also controls cell survival through ERK1/2.
