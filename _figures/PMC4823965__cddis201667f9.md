caption: A schematic depicting the role of Nupr1–Chop/P53–PUMA/Beclin1 signaling pathway
  in METH-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Briefly, Nupr1 expression is increased
  following METH treatment. Increased Nupr1 upregulates the expression of Chop. As
  a transcription factor, Chop upregulates the expression of P53, and P53 raises up
  PUMA expression, which mediates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by changing
  the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Meanwhile, Chop also increases the expression of Beclin1,
  which forms th eBcl-2/Beclin1 complex, thereby decreasing the dissociative Bcl-2.
  As a result, the ratio of dissociative Bcl-2 to Bax is also significantly decreased.
  The increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 results in translocation of cyto c, an apoptogenic
  factor, from the mitochondria to cytoplasm and activation of caspase-dependent apoptotic
  pathways
