caption: cGAS/STING signaling pathway. Components and mechanisms ensuring signal transduction
  in this pathway are depicted, with black arrows indicating ubiquitination processes
  and grey arrows phosphorylation. K63-linked polyubiquitination is indicated with
  green hexagons. Blue filaments represent activating double strand DNA. Activation
  occurs at the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. See text for details.
