caption: a Formation of salsolinol (13) from acetaldehyde (12) and dopamine (2) occurs
  spontaneously in yeast strains engineered for dopamine production. b NCS-catalyzed
  formation of substituted THIQs through catabolism of endogenous amino acids via
  the Ehrlich pathway. Amino acids are converted to the respective aldehyde species
  via sequential transamination (Aro8/Aro9) and decarboxylation (Aro10) reactions.
  In the presence of dopamine (2) and NCS, aldehydes are converted to the corresponding
  substituted THIQs. Stereochemistry of non-canonical substituted THIQs is omitted.
  c Relative levels of substituted THIQs in yeast strains engineered for (S)-norcoclaurine
  (3) production. Strain 1373 possesses the dopamine pathway and lacks an NCS biosynthetic
  enzyme. Refer to Fig.  and Supplementary Data  for genotypes of engineered strains.
  All of the depicted substituted THIQs were synthesized de novo by strain LP295 and
  all subsequent engineered strains. Error bars represent the mean ± s.d. of n = 3
  independent biological samples. Asterisk (*) denotes a significant increase or decrease
  (P < 0.05) in product titer relative to the precursor strain. Statistical differences
  between control and derivative strains were tested using two-tailed Student’s t-test.

  PAA phenylacetaldehyde, spont. spontaneous. Source data underlying Fig. 3c are provided
