caption: Schematic representation of the role played by TCL1 in multiple signaling
  pathways. TCL1 regulates many proteins responsible for cellular proliferation, survival
  and epigenetic regulation through multiple signaling pathways. TCL1 promotes the
  activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway directly through its interactions with AKT,
  AP1 elements (c-JUN, c-FOS), and ROR1, and indirectly by inhibiting the tumor suppressor
  PTPROt and sustaining the BCR pathway. TCL1 enhances the activation of the NF-κB
  pathway by direct actions on IκB alpha and ATM. Other signaling pathways mediated
  by physical interactions of TCL1 with p63 and HSP70 or with EP300 supports the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  and the NF-κB pathways, respectively. Black arrows indicate the protein-protein
  interactions described in the text; Red lines represent published interactions among
  proteins and pathways.
