caption: 'The one-carbon metabolism and DNA methylation. The Folate cycle: folic acid
  (supplement form) is reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF) by
  the enzyme dihydrofolate (DHFR). The carbon of serine is transferred to THF by serine
  hydroxyl-methyltransferase (SHMT), 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate (5,10-MeTHF)
  can be reduced to 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHR metabolised from food folate)
  by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with vitamin B2 serving as a cofactor.
  The Methionine cycle: 5-MTHR serves as a methyl donor in the conversion of amino
  acid, homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine (Met), catalysed by methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine
  methyltransferase (MTR) and vitamin B12 serves as a cofactor. Alternatively, homocysteine
  can be remethylated by the enzyme betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT)
  and betaine, producing methionine and dimethylglycine (DMG). Betaine can be derived
  directly from the diet or converted from dietary choline. Methionine is metabolized
  to S-S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) by the enzyme methionine adenosyltranferase (MAT).
  SAM can also be converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by methyltransferase (MT).
  SAH is converted to homocysteine by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY). The
  Transulfuration pathway: Homocysteine can also be metabolized to cysteine via the
  actions of two vitamin B6-dependent enzymes cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) and
  cystathionine gamma lyase (CGL). DNA methylation: A family of enzymes called DNA
  methyltransferase (Dnmts) catalyses the transfer of methyl groups from SAM to DNA
  cytosine bases at the 5th carbon (5-mC). Active demethylation of 5-mC by ten-eleven
  translocation (TET) enzymes producing 5-hydromethylcytosine (5-HMC), then formylcytosine
  (5-FMC) and lastly 5-carboxylcytosine (5-CMC).'
