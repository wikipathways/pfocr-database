caption: Thiamine biosynthetic pathway. (A) Map of the pathway (downstream flow visualized
  by black arrows). Genes accumulate in areas related to stress response, and the
  two STRS trajectories are shown by gray arrows. (B) Heatmap depicting the thiamine
  biosynthetic pathway gene expression in response to WS. (C) KEGG pathway with gene
  color code derived from their positions in the SOM portrait indicated by the colored
  waterline portraits of SG CTRL and STRS and MP CTRL and STRS (see the upper right
  part)
