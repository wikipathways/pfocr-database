caption: Transcriptional regulation of glucose metabolism during active TB disease
  and in PBMCs stimulated with Mtb. (A, B) Principal component analysis of the glycolysis
  and TCA cycle whole blood gene signatures of microarray data from publically available
  cohorts from (A) the United Kingdom (UK) and (B) South Africa (SA), previously published
  by Berry et al. (Series GSE19444) . Data for each sample, including active pulmonary
  TB (PTB), LTBI (TST positive), and CON (TST negative) individuals were plotted along
  PC1 for glycolysis versus PC1 for the TCA cycle. For the UK cohort, PC1 accounted
  for 37% of the total variation for both glycolysis and the TCA cycle. For the SA
  cohort PC1 accounted for 44 and 34% of the variance for glycolysis and the TCA cycle
  respectively. (C–E) Individual and mean whole blood gene expression for (C) GAPDH,
  (D) hexokinase‐3, and (E) IDH3B in controls and PTB patients on 0, 2, or 12 months
  of TB treatment (Series GSE19435). Microarray data derived from Berry et al . Symbols
  represent individual samples and data are shown as means ± SEM; means were compared
  using the Mann–Whitney U test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (F) Heatmap
  of gene expression pattern of glycolysis or TCA cycle genes in in vitro‐stimulated
  PBMCs and in vivo whole blood (UK and SA publically available cohorts). All data
  was log‐2 transformed. The in vitro Mtb stimulations were normalized to RPMI by
  subtracting means whereas the in vivo PTB cohort was normalized to the corresponding
  LTBI cohort. p‐values were considered significant when less than 0.05 as determined
  by the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test for the in vitro data set and by the Mann–Whitney
  U test for the in vivo data sets. Red represents a significant up regulation, blue
  a significant down regulation and grey no difference. (G) Schematic representation
  of upregulated (in red) and downregulated (blue) genes in the glycolysis and TCA
  cycle pathways as determined by microarray analysis of Mtb‐stimulated PBMCs.
