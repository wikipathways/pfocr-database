caption: Differential cytokine secretion by CF MDM versus WT MDM predicts reduced
  chemoattraction of immune cells in response to EV-PA. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  for all cytokines that were differentially (FDR < 0.05) secreted by CF MDM exposed
  to CF EV-PA compared with WT MDM exposed to WT EV-PA. Cytokines that are secreted
  more by CF MDM compared with WT MDM are highlighted in shades of red while cytokines
  that are secreted less by CF MDM compared to WT MDM are shown in shades of green.
  Orange is predicted activation of downstream processes and functions, based on the
  activation status of the detected cytokines, whereas blue denotes predicted repression.
  Based on the overall cytokine secretion profile of EV-PA exposed CF MDM compared
  with WT MDM, IPA predicts increased activation of phagocytes but reduced chemotaxis
  and recruitment of cells. Specifically, the increased secretion of GM-CSF by CF
  MDM is predicted to result in increased antibody response and decreased T cell activation,
  whereas the reduced secretion of IP-10, RANTES, and IL-8 is predicted to lead to
  reduced chemoattraction of T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and neutrophils.
  n = 3 donors each for WT and CF MDM exposed to EVs secreted by WT AEC from 4 donors
  or CF AEC from 3 donors. AEC, airway epithelial cell; CF, cystic fibrosis; EV, extracellular
  vesicles; EV-PA, EVs secreted by P. aeruginosa-exposed AEC; FDR, false discovery
  rate; MDM, monocyte-derived macrophages; WT, wild type.
