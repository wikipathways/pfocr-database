caption: Transcription factors (TFs) involved in the development and activation of
  macrophages. The Pioneer TFs involved in macrophage development include PU.1, C/EBPα
  and β, RUNX1, and IRF8. These TFs engage target sites in chromatin generating regions
  of open chromatin that enable rapid recruitment of TFs activated in response to
  external cues in differentiated cells. Microbial activation of macrophages initiates
  the inflammatory signaling pathway first resulting in translocation of TFs such
  as NFκB and IRFs from the cytosol to the nucleus rapidly activating the primary
  response genes (PRGs). PRGs are associated with poised RNA polymerase and possess
  histone tail modifications commonly found at the promoters of actively transcribed
  genes (H3K4me3 and H3K9ac). The final class of TFs include C/EBPδ and ATF3 that
  get induced after the PRGs and are critical for the induction and control of the
  secondary response genes (SRGs). The SRGs require chromatin remodeling mediated
  by the SWI–SNF complex. CEBPδ acts as an amplifier of NFκB signaling and is critical
  for SRG induction whereas ATF3 plays a role in negatively regulating the pathway
  enabling efficient termination of the inflammatory response.
