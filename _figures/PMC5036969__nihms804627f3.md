caption: Key mechanisms of mitochondrial regulation by c-MYC, K-RAS, PI3K and p53
  signaling pathways. Through transcriptional regulation, c-Myc induces mitochondrial
  biogenesis and metabolism in addition to its stimulation of cell cycle progression
  and glycolysis. c-Myc promotes mitochondrial fusion and respiration, which can result
  in increased ROS production and oxidative signaling. Hyperactive PI3K signaling
  through either PI3K mutation or loss/mutatoin of the PTEN tumor suppressor results
  in mTOR activation, which is additionally regulated by nutrient availability, to
  regulate cell growth. mTOR promotes mitochondrial biogenesis both transcriptionally
  and translationally. Low nutrient conditions that result in a high AMP/ATP ratio
  result in AMPK activation, which opposes the mTOR pathway. During chronic nutrient
  deprivation, AMPK can also promote mitochondrial biogenesis to allow for metabolic
  flexibility. Loss of p53 promotes survival not only via transcriptional regulation
  of cell death programs but also through direct interactions with Bcl-2 proteins
  at the mitochondria. p53 can also induce mitochondrial respiration to promote tumorigenesis
  by allowing for metabolic flexibility. Oncogenic K-Ras mutations result in a coordinated
  program of mitochondrial regulation, inhibiting respiration through multiple mechanisms
  as well as promoting mitochondrial fission and mitophagy.
