caption: (A) In nutrient-rich media, abundant glucose results in high rates of flux
  through the glucolipid biosynthesis pathway (black arrows) driving UgtP to the septal
  site where it inhibits FtsZ assembly and delays maturation of the division apparatus.
  (B) UgtP delays division in short cells by inhibiting FtsZ assembly and/or extending
  the length of the Z period (C) Nutrient-dependent localization of UgtP couples maturation
  of the division apparatus to growth rate. Under nutrient-rich conditions (left),
  active UgtP (green) is distributed throughout the cytoplasm and concentrates at
  the cytokinetic ring (red) in an FtsZ-dependent manner. During growth in nutrient-poor
  medium (right), UgtP expression levels are reduced and the remaining protein is
  sequestered in randomly positioned foci. (D) A homeostatic circuit coordinates cell
  size with division on a cell autonomous level. A temporal signal “licenses” a bacterial
  cell to divide, however, UgtP-dependent inhibition of FtsZ assembly either delays
  FtsZ ring formation or extends the Z-period until the cell reaches critical mass.
  Once critical mass is achieved, a second nutrient-dependent sensor relieves division
  inhibition and permits progression through the remainder of the division cycle.
  (E) Carbon flow through the glucolipid biosynthesis pathway is responsible for the
  majority of the increase in cell size under conditions that promote multifork replication
  (shaded area). Wild type cells (blue line) cultured under nutrient-rich conditions
  are ~2-fold longer than their slow growing counterparts. In the absence of carbon
  flow through the glucolipid biosynthesis pathway (dashed red line) cell size remains
  relatively constant regardless of growth rate.
