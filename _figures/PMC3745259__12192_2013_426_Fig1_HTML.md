caption: The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway provides the donor substrate for O-GlcNAcylation
  and other types of protein glycosylation. Upon entry into the cell, a small percentage
  of Glucose (2–5 % in adipocytes) is directed into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  and converted into UDP-GlcNAc via glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase
  (GFAT), glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyltransferase (EMeg32), N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate
  mutase (pgm3), and UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (uap1). OGT catalyzes the addition
  of the glycoside to yield O-GlcNAcylated nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial
  proteins, whereas the enzyme O-GlcNAcase catalyzes the removal O-GlcNAc from proteins.
  O-GlcNAc-modified proteins are involved in many cellular processes including the
  cellular stress response. HK hexokinase, G6P-I glucose 6-phosphate isomerase, Glc
