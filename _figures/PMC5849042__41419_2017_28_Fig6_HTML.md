caption: i Under standard culture conditions, hiPSCs show a remarkable potential to
  self-renew while maintaining their pluripotency when the circuitry of pluripotency
  network is activated; on the other hand, hiPSCs can give rise to any cell lineage
  when the pluripotency network is inactivated upon stimulation of differentiation.
  ii Short-term RA treatment of hiPSCs regulates pluripotency and differentiation
  through inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway and activation of mTOR signaling.
  hiPSCs exposed to RA maintain pluripotency in culture and improve the differentiation
  potential
