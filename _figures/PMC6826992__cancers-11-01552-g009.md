caption: Models of EGFR-ligand dependent pathway and EGFR-ligand independent pathway
  in EIS cells. (A) In the EGFR-ligand dependent pathway, proliferation is promoted
  via ERK/cyclin D1 by EGFR activated by the binding of an EGFR-ligand and EGFR. The
  activity of FAK or sheddase may be involved in EGFR phosphorylation. (B) In the
  EGFR-ligand independent pathway, EGFR transactivated via Src by cell-substratum
  adhesion phosphorylates ErbB3 and promotes proliferation via AKT.
