caption: Utilization of selected BDPs for terpenoid production in S. cerevisiae. (A)
  Miltiradiene biosynthesis and production under selected BDPs. The biosynthetic pathway
  (left) shows sequential conversion of GGPP to miltiradiene by CPS and MilS, which
  were co-expressed divergently under BDPs (gene construct shown on the right). To
  enhance production titer, CPS is fused with ERG20(F96C), a mutant form of the farnesyl
  diphosphate synthase gene denoted as ERG20*, which encodes an enzyme possessing
  GGPP synthase activity. The bar chart (right) presents miltiradiene titers across
  different BDPs with varying promoter orientation and strength. (B) β-Carotene biosynthesis
  and promoter-dependent production under selected BDPs. The biosynthetic pathway
  (left) involves phytoene synthase/lycopene cyclase (crtYB) and phytoene desaturase
  (crtI), which were co-expressed divergently under BDPs (gene construct shown on
  the right). Feedback inhibition by lycopene (red) limits crtYB activity, necessitating
  fine-tuning of metabolic flux. The bar chart (right) displays total carotenoids
  (dark orange) and β-carotene (light orange) yields under various BDPs. Yeast spotting
  assays visually indicate carotenoid accumulation, with stronger pigmentation reflecting
  higher production. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological
  replicates, with individual data points shown as circles
