caption: Anti-inflammatory ILs in ischemic stroke. After stroke, increased IL-2 activates
  Tregs, leading to the increased expression of CD39 and CD73. The increased IL-4
  promotes the polarization of macrophages to the M2 phenotype and decreases the expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α by activating STAT6. IL-10
  also reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, maintains the activity
  of Th1, ultimately exerting an anti-inflammatory action. IL-13 also increases the
  polarization of macrophages to the M2 phenotype, decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and decreases the loss of neurons. IL-19 mainly preserves the reduced
  the number of CD4+, CD8+, and B cells and reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. IL-33 inhibits inflammation after stroke mainly through the ST2/IL-33
  signaling pathway.
