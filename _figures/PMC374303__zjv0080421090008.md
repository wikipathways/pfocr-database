caption: Schematic representation of the multiple mechanisms by which HSV-1 blocks
  cellular IFN-based defense systems. (A) Accumulation of complementary RNA capable
  of annealing induces the synthesis of IFN and activates PKR (, ). Activated PKR
  dimerizes, phosphorylates eIF-2α and, in the absence of viral anti-IFN gene function,
  shuts off protein synthesis. (B) In cells infected with wild-type virus the γ134.5
  protein binds and redirects phosphatase 1α to dephosphorylate eIF-2α (). Protein
  synthesis is not affected by activated PKR. (C) Secreted IFN binds IFN receptor
  to activate the signaling pathway. In the case of IFN-γ, the receptor-associated
  kinases Jak1 and Jak2 are activated and phosphorylate Stat1 (). These and associated
  proteins are translocated into the nucleus, where they induce antiviral proteins.
  The activation of antiviral response is mediated by PML (). (D) In wild-type-virus-infected
  cells, Jak1 disappears, PML is degraded, and the constituents of ND10 are dispersed
  (). As a result, the infected cell does not respond to exogenous IFN to curtail
  viral replication.
