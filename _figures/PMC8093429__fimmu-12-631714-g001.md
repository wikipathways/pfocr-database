caption: Efferosome Maturation Pathways. Efferocytosis can occur through the canonical
  endo-lysosomal maturation pathway (left) in which the GTPases Rab5 and Rab7 mediate
  the sequential fusion of early endosomes (EE), late endosomes (LE), and lysosomes
  (LY) with the maturing efferosome. Unlike phagocytosis, this efferosome maturation
  pathway also involves Rab17 which directs the degraded contents from the efferosome
  to the recycling endosome from where they may be exocytosed, thereby avoiding the
  delivery of these materials to antigen loading compartments. In addition to the
  canonical pathway, some efferosomes may mature through an LC3-mediated, autophagy-like
  pathway (right). In this pathway, the efferosome recruits the protein LC3 which
  then mediates a rapid degradation of the efferosome in a fashion which suppresses
  antigen presentation. Similar to LC3-associated phagocytosis, the recruitment of
  the autophagy-related proteins ATG5 and ATG7, as well as Rubicon to the nascent
  efferosome appear to be important for efferocytosis through this pathway. The activity
  of ATG5 and ATG7 are inhibited by Rab35a, which is activated downstream of TLR signaling.
