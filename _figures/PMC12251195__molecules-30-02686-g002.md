caption: 'Mechanisms of programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1
  (PD-1/PD-L1)-mediated immune evasion in the tumor microenvironment. This illustrates
  the complex interactions between tumor cells and various immune cells in the context
  of PD-1/PD-L1-mediated immune evasion. The diagram is divided into four main sections
  (A–D), each highlighting a key aspect of this process. (A) PD-L1 expression on tumor
  cells: Tumor cells upregulate PD-L1 expression in response to various stimuli. Interferon
  gamma (IFN-γ) produced by activated T cells induces PD-L1 expression through the
  Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling
  pathway. Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment (TME) activates hypoxia–inducible
  factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), which directly increases PD-L1 expression. Genomic instability
  in cancer cells, including mutations in oncogenes like epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR) or Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), can also lead to constitutive
  PD-L1 expression. (B) T cell exhaustion: Chronic exposure of T cells to PD-L1-expressing
  tumor cells leads to T-cell exhaustion. Exhausted T cells are characterized by increased
  expression of inhibitory receptors (PD-1, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein
  4 (CTLA-4), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3), lymphocyte-activation
  gene 3 (LAG-3)), reduced production of effector cytokines (IFN-γ, tumor necrosis
  factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-2 (IL-2)), and diminished proliferative capacity.
  The T-cell receptor (TCR) of exhausted T cells interacts with tumor antigens presented
  on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), while PD-1 simultaneously engages
  with PD-L1, leading to inhibitory signaling. (C) Regulatory T cell (T-reg) expansion:
  The PD-1/PD-L1 interaction promotes the expansion and activation of T-regs in the
  TME. T-regs suppress effector T-cell responses through various mechanisms, including
  the production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, transforming growth factor
  beta (TGF-β), IL-35), direct cell-to-cell contact inhibition, and metabolic disruption
  (cluster of differentiation 39 (CD39/CD73)-mediated adenosine production). T-regs
  also interact with dendritic cells (DCs), inhibiting their ability to activate effector
  T cells. (D) Suppression of innate immune cells: PD-1/PD-L1 interactions affect
  innate immune cells in the TME. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) expressing PD-1
  are polarized towards an M2 phenotype upon interaction with PD-L1, leading to reduced
  pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-12) and increased immunosuppressive
  factors secretion (IL-10, TGF-β). Natural killer (NK) cells expressing PD-1 exhibit
  reduced cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production when engaging with PD-L1-expressing tumor
  cells. Created in BioRender. Kciuk, M. (2025) https://BioRender.com/bb5n1sm (accessed
