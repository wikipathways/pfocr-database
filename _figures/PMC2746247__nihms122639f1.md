caption: 'a) Conversion of Glucose to PRPP. Glucose and ATP are converted to glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P) by the action of glucokinase (glk) with the production of ADP. G6P and NADP+
  is converted to 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf)
  with the production of NADPH. 6PG and NADP+ is converted to ribulose-5-phosphate
  (Ru5P) by the action of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (gndA) with the production
  of NADPH. Phosphoriboisomerase (rpiA) interconverts Ru5P and ribose-5-phosphate

  production of ADP. NDP’s and creatine phosphate are converted to NTP’s by the action
  of creatine phosphokinase (ckmT) with the production of creatine. Nicotinamide Adenine
  Dinucleotide Regeneration (Green). NAD(P)H, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and NH3 are converted
  to NAD(P)+ by the action of glutamate dehydrogenase (gdhA) with the production of
  glutamate. Glutamine Recycling (Purple). Glutamate, ATP and NH3 are converted to
  glutamine by the action of glutamine synthase (glnA) with the production of ADP.
  Aspartate Recycling (Orange). Fumarate and NH3 are converted to aspartate by the
  action of aspartate ammonia-lyase (aspA). Folate Regeneration (Blue). THF and serine
  are converted to 5,10-CH2-THF by the action of glycine hydroxymethyl-transferase
  (glyA) with the production of glycine. 5,10-CH2-THF and NADP+ is converted to 5,10-CH-THF
  by the action of methylene-THF dehydrogenase (folD) with the production of NADPH.
  5,10-CH-THF is converted to 10-CHO (formyl) THF by the action of methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase
