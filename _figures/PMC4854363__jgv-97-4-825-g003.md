caption: Negative regulatory NLR functions during viral infection. Three negative
  regulatory NLRs, NLRC3, NLRP12 and NLRX1, have been described. Upon stimulation
  with virus-associated PAMPs or DAMPs, NLRC3 blocks the association and migration
  of the STING/TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex, resulting in downregulation
  of IFN production responsible for keeping virus replication in check. NLRX1 is uniquely
  localized at the mitochondria, which facilitates its inhibitory association with
  MAVS and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). This results in dampening of IFN
  production. NLRX1 also interacts directly with TRAF6 to act as an inhibitor of NF-κB
  signalling. Additional functions of NLRX1, such as modulation of autophagy and ROS,
  also have implications in host defence against viral pathogens. NLRP12 is capable
  of suppressing elements of the NF-κB pathway and may have a role in regulation of
  the host immune response following viral infection. IRAK1, IL-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1.
