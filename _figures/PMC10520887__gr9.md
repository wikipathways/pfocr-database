caption: The schematic diagram of pIKKε together with pTBK1 to mediate porcine cGAS–STING
  pathway–induced type I interferon response. DNA virus infects cells and releases
  viral nucleic acid into cells. ① cGAS recognizes and binds with the dsDNA, and the
  activated cGAS utilizes GTP and ATP to synthesize 2′3′-cGAMP. ② 2′3′-cGAMP, as a
  second messenger, binds with STING and causes its oligomerization and translocation
  from ER. ③ The oligomerized STING recruits TBK1 as well as IKKε via the conserved
  TBK1-binding motif (TBM) of C-terminal tail (CTT). ④ Both TBK1 and IKKε are activated
  and phosphorylate the Ser365 in the conserved pLxIS motif of CTT, allowing recruiting
  IRF3 on its IRF3 association domain (IAD). ⑤ The phosphorylated IRF3 translocates
  into cell nucleus to induce the production of type I IFNs. cGAS, cyclic GMP–AMP
  synthase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IFN, interferon; pIKKε, porcine IKKε; pTBK1,
  phosphorylated TANK-binding kinase 1; STING, stimulator of interferon genes.
