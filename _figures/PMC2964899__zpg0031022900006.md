caption: Scheme showing the signaling elements and frequent deregulations in the Hh
  signaling network and potential cross-talk with the EGFR signaling pathway involved
  in the malignant behavior of cancer cells. The molecular events associated with
  the cellular processing of the SHH precursor into a biologically active form via
  autocatalytic cleavage and lipid modifications are illustrated. Autocrine and paracrine
  stimulation of the cancer cells by the monomeric and multimeric SHH molecules is
  also illustrated. The repressive effect of SUFU on the GLI activity is shown. Moreover,
  the frequent deregulations, including overexpression of the SHH ligand; inactivating
  mutations in HHIP, PTCH, or SUFU; or activating mutations in SMO coreceptor, which
  may contribute to cancer development, are also indicated. The potential stimulatory
  effect induced by the activation of EGFR pathway and oncogenic mutations in K-RASmut
  and B-RAFmut on the GLI transcriptional activity is indicated. The target gene products
  induced through the activation of Hh and EGFR signaling pathways are also described.
  Moreover, the stimulatory effect induced through the activation of TGF-β/TGF-βR/Smad3-Smad4
  and Wnt/β-catenin on the GLI2 expression is illustrated. In addition, the potential
  inhibitory effect induced by diverse pharmacological agents, such as a mAb directed
  against SHH ligand, EGF, EGFR, and Wnt, selective inhibitors of SMO (cyclopamine,
  KAAD-cyclopamine, IPI-269609, or GDC-0449), EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (gefitinib
  and erlotinib), TGF-β type I activin receptor-like kinase, and ALK5 (SB431542) are
  also indicated. COX2, cyclooxygenase 2; CXCR4, CXC chemokine receptor 4; FOXM1,
  forkhead box M1 transcription factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; VEGF, vascular
  endothelial growth factor.
