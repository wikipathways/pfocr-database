caption: The binding mechanism of LPS for TLR4 activation. A series of events takes
  place prior to LPS recognition by the TLR4-MD2 complex. (1) LBP extracts LPS from
  the bacterial membrane and (2) transfers it to membrane anchored CD14, where it
  binds to the hydrophobic pocket located at the N terminus and forms a monomeric
  complex. (3) CD14 facilitates LPS transfer to the TLR4-MD2 complex where it initiated
  the intracellular pathway.
