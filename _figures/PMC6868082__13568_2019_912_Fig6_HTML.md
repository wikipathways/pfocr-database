caption: Putative metabolic pathway for the bioproduction of bikaverin 1 and intermediates
  thereof in F. oxysporum LCP531 based on both the identified compounds profiles produced
  in either intracellular or extracellular extracts and the previously reported model
  for bikaverin biosynthesis in F. fujikuroi (Arndt et al. ; Caspi et al. ). Numbers
  are referring to the compounds characterized in Figs.  and , and colors correspond
  to the shades of the pigments isolated in this study. Major pigments are highlighted
  in bold (bikaverin 1, norbikaverin 2, oxo-pre-bikaverin 3, me-oxo-pre-bikaverin
  4, dinor-bikaverin 5, and pre-bikaverin 6). Pre-bikaverin was first described by
  Ma et al. ()
