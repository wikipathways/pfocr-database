caption: Primary metabolic pathway reflecting the metabolite changes in C. mopane
  under different fire frequency regimes, low fire frequency (S6 and S2) and high
  fire frequency (S7 and S3). The relative values are represented by log2 of the ratio
  between S7/S6 ± SE and of the ratio between S3/S2 ± SE of ten accessions. Relative
  values are normalized to the internal standard (ribitol) and dry weight (DW) of
  the samples. Dots indicate that the differences are statistically significant by
  Student’s t-test (p < 0.05).
