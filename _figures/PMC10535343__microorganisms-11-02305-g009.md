caption: Proposed chlorophyll f biosynthesis reaction schemes. The proposed free-radical
  reaction schemes for chlorophyll f synthesis from chlorophyll a involve the transformation
  of a C2 methyl group in Chl a into a formyl group in Chl f. The first step involves
  the formation of an anion radical (D−•) that might be the overexcited Pheo a in
  an oxygenated aqueous environment or a light-activated radical species through the
  coupled electron donation by the Chl a molecule. Deprotonation forms the radical
  methyl cation of the Chl a substrate (Step 2), followed by reaction with oxygen
  to generate a peroxo radical (Step 3) that reacts with a superoxide or hydroxy radical
  (Step 4a) produced through the reduction of oxygen by light-activated reductants,
  such as Pheo a (−610 mV) and QA (−80 mV). This forms the unstable hydroperoxymethyl
  Chl, which is further hydrolyzed to the formyl group (Chl f). Alternatively, the
  peroxo radical may decompose into the hydroxymethyl Chl derivative (Step 4b), which
  further reacts in an unknown pathway to form the formyl group (Step 5b). The partial
  structure of chlorophylls showed the side group containing the C2-methyl of Chl
  a (shaded region).
