caption: Network of lncRNAs involved in regulating the Th cell activation pathway
  in tongue squamous cell carcinoma. The lncRNAs were derived from the co-expression
  network and had similar expression trends compared with the mRNAs in the Th cell
  activation pathway. The triangles represent lncRNAs. Round and oval represent mRNAs.
  Red and pink represent upregulation, green represents downregulation and white represents
  no difference in expression. lncRNA, long non-coding RNA.
