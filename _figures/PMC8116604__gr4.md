caption: AKT pathway, regulated by m6A methylation, mediates the metabolism of diverse
  cancer cellsThe AKT pathway mediates metabolism through several downstream transcription
  factors, including FOXO, HIF1, MYC, ATF4, SREBP, and NRF2. These factors control
  the expression of genes that encode metabolic enzymes and modulate the process of
  glucose uptake, glycolysis, nucleotide and lipid synthesis, pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP), and redox homeostasis. The PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling pathways are significantly
  affected by m6A RNA methylation regulators in most human cancers, and m6A methylation
  acts as a regulator of the AKT pathway through decreasing expression of the negative
  AKT regulator PHLPP2 and by increasing expression of the positive AKT regulator
  mTORC2.
