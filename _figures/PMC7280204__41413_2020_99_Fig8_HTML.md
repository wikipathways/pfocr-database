caption: Signaling pathways involved in osteocyte mechanobiology. The Wnt/β-Catenin
  pathway mechanistically, the canonical Wnt/β-Catenin pathway is activated through
  the binding of Wnt ligands to a coreceptor complex consisting of Lrp5 or Lrp6 and
  FZD., This binding further activates the intercellular effector Dsh by FZD-mediated
  phosphorylation. Activated Dsh leads to the phosphorylation of Gsk-3β, which inhibits
  free β-Catenin in the cytosol by phosphorylating β-Catenin at multiple serine/threonine
  sites. Once Gsk-3β is phosphorylated by Dsh, it releases captured β-Catenin. As
  a result, free β-Catenin is translocated to nuclei, where it binds the coeffectors
  Tcf and Lef, inducing downstream gene transcription. Downstream effects of β-Catenin
  include the expression of Wnt target genes and secretory proteins (Opg, Osteopontin),
  and load-induced PGE2 secretion. Sclerostin antagonizes Wnt signaling through its
  competitive binding to Lrp5 and Lrp6 at their first two YWTD-EGF repeat domains.
  Mechanical stimulation can suppress Sost expression through both Peger2/4 and the
  MT pathway. In addition, the Tgfβ-Smad2/3 pathway can enhance sclerostin expression.
  As a result, during the osteocyte mechanotransduction process, the Wnt/β-Catenin
  pathway enhances osteoblastogenesis and bone formation; however, sclerostin negatively
  regulates the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. Focal adhesion As the central proteins in the
  FA complex, Integrins, especially Integrin β subunits, are essential for bone development
  and osteocyte mechanotransduction. The “Integrin adhesome” is a network of 156 proteins
  in the FA complex. In the FA complex, Kindlin-2, Talin, and other structural proteins
  are directly linked to the cytoplasmic tail of the Integrin β subunit, which further
  connects with the Pinch, Paxillin, Vinculin, and Arp2/3 proteins., This Integrin
  adhesome complex links the ECM and F-actin cytoskeleton and enhances the activation
  of downstream pathways, such as the Erk, PI3K, Gsk3, and Rho pathways. Upon F-actin
  cytoskeleton polymerization, YAP/TAZ coordinate signals from Rho GTPase and tension
  of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, initiate downstream target gene expression, and
  finally enhance osteogenesis and bone remodeling and inhibit osteocyte apoptosis.
  Apoptosis/senescence osteocyte apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, and senescence,
  a death-resistant cell fate program, are common features of aging bone tissue. Appropriate
  mechanical stimulation prevents osteocyte apoptosis, whereas aging, damage-inducing
  loading and disuse induce osteocyte apoptosis and senescence through several different
  pathways. In contrast, mechanical stimulation induces Src/Erk activation through
  Integrin and the cytoskeleton in osteocytes, inhibits apoptotic and senescence-related
  pathways and supports osteocyte survival.
