caption: Hypoxia signaling facilitates glucose metabolism by upregulating glucose
  transporters and other glycolytic machinery. As glucose enters the cell it is phosphorylated
  into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by hexokinase II and then enzymatically converted
  into fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) by phosphoglucose isomerase. While most F6P continues
  on into glycolysis, a small fraction is shunted into the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway where it is joined by other metabolic inputs to synthesize the charged sugar
  UDP-GlcNAc. This sugar moiety serves as the substrate for O-linked glycosylation
  of Ser/Thr residues on target proteins, a post-translational modification catalyzed
  the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Under hypoxic conditions, glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD) is O-GlcNAc modified resulting in enhanced activity and shuttling
  of G6P through the PPP, producing ample NADPH for biosynthetic and detoxification
  processes. In ccRCC, G6PD activity has been shown to be elevated and enhance NADPH
  production and NOX4 expression supporting tumorigenesis.
