caption: Activation of the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway in response to OS in cells and
  its antioxidant effects. Nrf2 binds to Kelch-1ike ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)
  in normal physiological conditions. Upon cellular exposure to OS, Nrf2 dissociates
  from Keap1 and is activated. Activated Nrf2 enters the nucleus and dimerizes with
  sMaf, and the dimer subsequently binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE),
  promoting the expression of antioxidant genes in the cell. This leads to a rise
  in the expression of SOD and GPx in the mitochondria, and CAT in the peroxisome,
  which work together to counteract intracellular OS. SOD can catabolize O2− into
  oxygen and H2O2, and the catabolized H2O2 can be further catalyzed by GPx to produce
  water, or by CAT to water and oxygen, as well
