caption: AhR activation mechanisms in mammalian cells. The inactive form of AhR is
  retained as a complex with chaperone proteins, including HSP90, XAP2, and P23, in
  the cytoplasm. Many exogenous AhR ligands, such as environmental pollutants, natural
  compounds, various drugs, and some endogenous substances, induce a conformational
  alteration in AhR to activate nuclear transport. In the nucleus, AhR works through
  two signaling pathways. In the canonical pathway, AhR and ARNT binding expose 5′-GCGTG-3′
  as the core consensus motif. Subsequently, it regulates its target genes, such as
  CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and NQO1, which are involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Noncanonical
  signaling occurs mainly through interactions with other regulatory proteins, such
  as KLF6, RelB, and NF-κB, which are involved in cell cycle regulation, growth differentiation,
  and the inflammatory response.
