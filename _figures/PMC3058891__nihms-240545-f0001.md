caption: 'In the liver, homocysteine is converted to methionine by two enzymes: (1)
  methionine synthase (MS), which utilizes methylcobalamin (MeCbl) as a cofactor and
  acquires methyl groups from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-THF). (2) betaine-homocysteine
  methyltransferase (BHMT), which uses betaine as a methyl donor. BHMT is only active
  in liver and kidney, not in brain. Methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM), which supplies methyl groups to various acceptor molecules such as DNA, RNA,
  phospholipids and proteins via the action of methyltransferases. Methyltransferases
  convert SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is reversibly converted to HCY.
  HCY is either remethylated to methionine or converted to cysteine by the transsulfuration
  pathway, which supports glutathione (GSH) synthesis. GSH reacts readily with hydroxocobalamin
  (OHCbl) to form glutathionylcobalamin (GSCbl), which is converted to MeCbl in a
  SAM-dependent reaction.'
