caption: Autophagy in HIV-1 infection. Left) HIV-1 replication requires early autophagic
  events for its replication [], perhaps because the autophagosomal membrane provides
  a scaffold for virion assembly. Incomplete, or fully formed virions that enter the
  cell via endocytosis [], could be degraded by the autophagy (xenophagy) pathway.
  However, HIV-1 can inhibit the late stage of autophagy to avoid the digestion of
  virions within autolysosomes. Right) Autophagy is a crucial component of innate
  and adaptive immune responses to HIV-1 infection. Autophagy is required for the
  TLR7-mediated signaling of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) production by plasmacytoid dendritic
  cells (innate immunity) in response to HIV []. Autophagy also contributes to proteolytic
  processing for the presentation of HIV-1 peptides in the context of MHC class II
  (adaptive immunity).
