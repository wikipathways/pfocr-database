caption: (A) ATRA cell-survival signalling is proposed to be mediated through PLA2-dependent
  AA release and metabolism to lipoxygenase products such as 5-oxo-ETE, which activate
  PPARδ1 to promote expression of survival genes. We suggest that the expression of
  inhibitory PPARδ2 transcripts is suppressed when this pathway is activated. (B)
  When the PLA2/5-LO/PPARδ pathway is inhibited, we propose that the expression of
  genes facilitating cell survival is prevented, a process facilitated by up-regulation
  of PPARδ2 and PPARδ2-mediated suppression, allowing the expression of either stress-induced
  or RAR-induced (or both) death genes to predominate and drive cell death.
