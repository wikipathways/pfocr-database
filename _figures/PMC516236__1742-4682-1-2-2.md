caption: 'Schematic representation of metabolic Insulin signaling pathway used for
  the steady state analysis. Nomenclature: I, Insulin; X, unbound surface insulin
  receptor; XI, unphosphorylated once-bound surface receptor; XIP, phosphorylated
  once-bound surface receptor; XI2P, phosphorylated twice-bound surface receptor;
  Xi represents intracellular receptor pool; XIPi and XI2Pi are internalized form
  of XIP and XI2P; phosphatase PTP catalyzes the dephosphorylation of AP, XIP, XIPi
  and XI2Pi. A, unphosphorylated IRS-1; AP, phosphorylated IRS-1; B, inactive PI3-kinase;
  APB, phosphorylated IRS-1 and PI3-kinase complex; CP3, lipid PI[3,4,5]P3; CP2, lipid
  PI[4,5]P2; CP2'', lipid PI[3,4]P2; phosphatase SHIP2 catalyzes dephosphorylation
  of CP3 to form CP2'', phosphatase PTEN catalyzes dephosphorylation of CP3 to form
  CP2; F, inactive Akt and PKC-ς; FP, phosphorylated Akt and PKC-ς; E8 dephosphorylates
  FP; E6 phosphorylates CP2'' to form CP3; FP activates GLUT4 from intracellular location
  to plasma membrane. GC and GM represent GLUT4 in cytoplasm and on plasma membrane
  respectively. Kd1 to Kd3 are dissociation constants; Kd4 and Kd5 are distribution
  coefficients; Kmr, Km, Km1to Km8 are Michaelis-Menten constants; k, kp, kd, ks,
  k0, k1 to k13 are reaction rates as shown in the figure.'
