caption: Biosynthetic pathway of glycosphingolipids (GSLs). Ceramide (Cer) is the
  biosynthetic origin of GSLs. Glucosylceramide (GlcCer) is synthesized from Cer by
  GlcCer synthetase, and subsequently, lactosylceramide (LacCer) is synthesized from
  GlcCer by LacCer synthetase. Our results indicate that LacCer synthetase is encoded
  by B4galt-5 and B4galt-6 genes in mice. LacCer is the starting point of various
  gangliosides, including o-, a-, b-, and c-series gangliosides.
