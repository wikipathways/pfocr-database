caption: Post-transcriptional control of mammalian clock genes. (A) The regulation
  of Cry1 or Per2 mRNA stability by hnRNP D or I (hnD/I). During the night-time, the
  expression of hnRNP proteins in the cytoplasm is relatively high and more Cry1 and
  Per2 mRNAs are subject to degradation, leading to lower levels of mRNA (relative
  RNA levels depicted by curves on the left). By contrast, the level of hnRNPs is
  relatively low during the day; therefore, both Cry1 and Per2 mRNA can escape from
  the degradation caused by hnRNPs. Thus, these mRNAs become more stable, leading
  to higher mRNA levels. (B) Post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation
  of AANAT protein expression. During the night-time, hnRNP Q (hnQ) expression increases
  and this promotes the translation of AANAT through the interaction with IRESs. AANAT
  protein is phosphorylated by a PKA-mediated pathway and this prevents it from being
  degraded by the proteasome. Both of these post-transcriptional and post-translational
  regulatory steps contribute to the extreme amplitude of AANAT expression during
  the night. At the same time, hnRNP Q also binds to the 3′-UTR of Aanat mRNA and
  promotes degradation of Aanat mRNA. During the day, Aanat mRNA expression and the
  level of cytoplasmic hnRNP Q are low, and little or no AANAT protein is made. Melatonin
  is synthesized from tryptophan by four enzymatic steps, of which AANAT catalyzes
  the third to convert serotonin to N-acetylserotonin. The effects of hnRNP L and
  hnRNP R are not depicted here for simplicity. m7Gppp, 7-methylguanosine cap.
