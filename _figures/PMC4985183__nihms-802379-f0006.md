caption: '(A) Phosphorylation-based cancer hallmarks using integrated personalized
  signatures (pCHIPS) analysis for patient RA40 revealed strong enrichment of cell
  cycle and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway networks. The pCHIPS wheel summarizes enrichment
  between genes in each patient-specific network and the corresponding pCHIPS category:
  labels indicate categories with significant enrichment after multi-hypothesis correction
  (FDR < 0.1). Black dots indicate SNV and copy-number genomic events in this patient.
  Patient-specific network nodes and edges related to cell cycle pathway (B, C), nuclear
  receptor pathway (D), PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (E), and stemness pathways (F). Edges
  belonging to both the patient-specific network model and the cell cycle related
  scaffold network are shown as thick yellow edges, while corresponding genes are
  shaded in dark grey. Yellow arrows indicate that the upstream kinase directly phosphorylates
  the downstream substrate. “Circleplot” quadrants for each gene summarize genomic,
  transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic activity relevant to metastatic CRPC phenotype
  (upper right: amplification; lower right: deletion; lower left: mutation; upper
  left: transcriptional regulatory activity; center: kinase regulatory activity).
  Node “ears” peripherally attached to circleplots represent relative phosphorylation
  of specific, functionally annotated peptides sites on each protein. Genes and edges
  that are not represented in the patient-specific network but are in the scaffold
  network are shown in light grey. See also , .'
