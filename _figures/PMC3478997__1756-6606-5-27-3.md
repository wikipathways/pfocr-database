caption: The signaling pathway for CREB in the regulation of FMRP by Group I mGluRs
  in ACC neurons. Stimulation of mGluR1/5 triggers the Ca2+ release from intracellular
  calcium stores by IP3 and Ca2+ influx from L-VDCCs through membrane depolarization.
  The increase of Ca2+ leads to activation of Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM) dependent pathways,
  including Ca2+ and CaM stimulated AC1-cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) and CaMKIV.
  PKA and CaMKIV then phosphorylates CREB. Phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) initiates the
  CREB-dependent transcription of Fmr1 gene and upregulates FMRP in the cytoplasm.
  The mutant CREB (Y134F) contributes to transcription of Fmr1 gene, whereas DREAM
  may not be involved in Fmr1 gene expression. FMRP may interact with its interactors
  and modulate neuronal functions in ACC.
