caption: Figure 4. Role of PPARs in the paracrine interaction between adipocytes and
  adipose tissue macrophages. As sensors of dietary fatty acids, PPARs play an important
  role in maintenance of white adipose tissue homeostasis. In adipocytes, PPARγ activation
  reduces fatty acid efflux by promoting fat storage and increasing adiponectin production,
  which improves systemic lipid and glucose metabolism. In the macrophage, PPARs can
  suppress inflammatory responses by anti-inflammatory mechanisms or by Th2 polarization,
  which increases the production of an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Th2 cytokines
  are produced locally by many cell types (eosinophils, T lymphocytes, mast cells
  and adipocytes) to activate downstream transcription factors in the macrophage,
  including STAT6 and PPARδ/PPARγ. Studies have demonstrated that disruption of the
  IL-13-PPARδ paracrine pathway leads to white adipose tissue inflammation and insulin
  resistance, highlighting the importance of PPAR signaling in controlling the initiation
  of metabolic inflammation.
