caption: The P+ condition is shown on the left, in which regulation functions in the
  SPX mutant is shown in the inset, whereas the P− condition on the right. Positive
  and negative regulations are indicated by arrows and flat-ended lines, respectively.
  The vertical red arrow indicates upregulation. Crosses depict blockage of the pathway.
