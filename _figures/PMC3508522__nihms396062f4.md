caption: A. A schematic representation of the relationship between AR activity and
  PSA expression, and the strategy to exploit this relationship for PET imaging. The
  kallikrein PSA is an AR target gene, and has a complicated post transcriptional
  lifetime. The gene is transcribed as a catalytically inactive proenzyme (“pro” PSA),
  and is activated by the proteolytic activity of human kallikrein 2 (hK2). The pool
  of PSA with an unobscured catalytic cleft is referred to as “free” PSA, and can
  be secreted into extracellular space. Through an undefined mechanism, a small portion
  of free PSA will leak into the blood stream, whereupon it is rapidly and irreversibly
  complexed with serpins (e.g. alpha-1 antichymotrypsin). To target tumor-associated
  PSA, an antibody that specifically recognizes free PSA was radiolabeled (89Zr-5A10).
  The color bar at bottom highlights the gradient of PSA concentrations in the various
  tissue compartments, further underscoring the utility of targeting tumor associated
  PSA species for imaging. B. A schematic representation showing how 89Zr-5A10 PET
  can inform on the in vivo pharmacology of androgen deprivation therapies. The model
  was derived from that established with J591 PET.
