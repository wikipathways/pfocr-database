caption: This cell signaling pathway is important for the cellular response to a variety
  of growth and differentiation factors. Aberration of this pathway in ovarian SBTs
  and low-grade serous carcinomas is mainly due to activating mutations of KRAS and
  BRAF, which result in constitutive activation of MAPK-mediated signaling in these
  tumors. Activated MAPK signaling alters expression of downstream target genes, including
  up-regulation of cyclin D1. Several MEK small compound inhibitors such as CI-1040
  have been generated. These inhibitors effectively suppress MAPK activation and hold
  promise for treatment of patients with advanced stage low-grade serous carcinomas.
