caption: The maturation of DCs and IL-1α/β mediated by CARD9. The synthesis of IL-1α/β
  involves two signals, signal 1 comes from ITAM-Syk-mediated pro-IL-1α/β synthesis,
  and signal 2 comes from Syk-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Bioactive IL-1α/β
  can prime T cells via IL-1R1-MyD88 pathway (A). Immature DCs can recognize and take
  up pathogens, initiating the innate immunity. The maturation of DCs requires CARD9,
  and mature DCs could present antigens to naïve T cells and induce their differentiation,
  thus mediating the adaptive immunity (B).
