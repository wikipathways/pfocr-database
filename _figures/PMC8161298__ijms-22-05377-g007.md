caption: The regulatory mechanisms of the P53 pathway. P53 is regulated by MDM2 and
  MDM4, which are all affected by the PTMs and are also determining each other’s activity.
  MDM2 is indirectly activated by miR-cluster 371a-3 and ANRIL, while it is inhibited
  by ARF and miR-339. MEG3, CTCF, TRIM proteins, and miR-125 can regulate P53 activity
  directly. All these regulatory mechanisms combined will lead to the inhibition or
  activation of P21 expression, leading to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, or senescence.
  MDM2 and MDM4 are both able to inhibit DNA repair mechanisms, resulting in genomic
  instability.
