caption: (A-B) ERα located on the cytomembrane (A) and/or ERα located in the cytosol
  (B) can regulate rapid signaling pathways, including activating the PI3K/Akt pathway
  and inhibiting the AMPK pathway. (C) ERα in the nucleus may act as a classic nuclear
  receptor and regulate targeted gene transcription via directly binding to the EREs.
  (D) Nuclear ERα can also form complex with other nuclear receptors (NR) or transcription
  factors (TF) to regulate gene transcription via an ERE-independent mechanism. While
  mechanisms described in grey boxes (A) and (C) have been excluded by observations
  from MOER and NERKI mouse models, respectively, contributions of cytosolic ERα-initiated
  rapid signals (B) and ERα-initiated ERE-independent gene transcription (D) in body
  weight control have not been directly tested.
