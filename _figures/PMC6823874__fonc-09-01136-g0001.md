caption: '(A) Network diagram of genes associated with 10 DNA damage response pathways
  at different level of DNA repair: base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair,
  mismatch repair, double strand break repair, homologous recombination repair of
  replication independent DNA double strand breaks, non-homologous end joining, G2-M
  DNA damage checkpoint, Fanconi anemia pathway, P53 dependent DNA damage response
  and P53 independent DNA damage response. (B) Somatic mutations in genes from the
  10 DNA damage response pathways in 17 cancer types. We included genes that are mutated
  in at-least 1% of tumor samples in more than one tumor types. Numbers in each cell
  represents frequency of samples carrying mutation in corresponding gene in that
  cancer type. Rows and columns are sorted by the frequency of mutation of the DDR
  genes in the tumor types.'
