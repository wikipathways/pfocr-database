caption: 'Signaling pathway involved in the development of persistent bladder hyperalgesia.
  Repeated activation (3×) of bladder PAR4 receptors establishes a spinal (L6/S1)
  mechanism involving MIF and HMGB1 that maintains persistent bladder pain. MIF acts
  upstream of HMGB1. Blocking either MIF or HMGB1 reduces persistent bladder pain.
  Both TLR4 and RAGE (both HMGB1 receptors) mediate persistent bladder pain. TRIF
  may modulate the onset of persistent bladder pain, though the role of MyD88 remains
  to be determined. HMGB1: High mobility group box 1; MIF: Migration inhibitory factor;
  PAR4: Protease-activated receptor-4; RAGE: Receptor for advanced glycation end product;
  TLR4: Toll-like receptor-4'
