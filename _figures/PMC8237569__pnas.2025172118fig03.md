caption: F420 and folate pathways and mechanism of action of TA-C. Enzymes are indicated
  by gray background. Enzymes for which TA-C–resistant mutations were isolated are
  underlined (in the case of DfrA [DHFR], an engineered over-expressor strain conferred
  resistance). Metabolites are gray. TA-C and its derivatives are dark red. TA-C is
  converted by the FDORs Ddn and Rv1558 to TA-C-Red, which undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis
  to the highly potent DHFR inhibitor TA-C-Acid. The drug PAS is bright red. PAS is
  converted by FolP (DHPS) and FolC into the DHFR inhibitor hydroxy-DHF. Target X,
  unknown target(s) proposed to be intercepted by TA-C-Met and TA-C (). PABA, para-aminobenzoic
  acid; DHF, dihydrofolate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; and mTHF, methylene-tetrahydrofolate.
  The F420pathway is according to Bashiri et al. (). The folate pathway is according
  to Hajian et al. ().
