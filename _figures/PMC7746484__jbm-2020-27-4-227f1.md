caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. TLRs are located on the surface
  of cell membranes or endosomal compartments. The activation of different TLRs recruit
  specific sets of adaptors. All TLRs, except TLR3, use the myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway, whereas TLR3 and TLR4 use the TLR domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent pathway. Recruitment of the various
  signaling adaptors activate downstream signaling pathways to provoke the induction
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines or the production of type I interferons (IFNs). TIRAP,
  toll-like receptor domain-containing adaptor protein; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase; TRF, T-cell replacing factor; TAK, transforming growth factor-β-activated
  kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; RIP, receptor-interacting protein; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
  factor; IRF, interferon regulatory factor.
