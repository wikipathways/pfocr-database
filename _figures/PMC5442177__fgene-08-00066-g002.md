caption: Transcriptional regulation of hepatic mIndy mRNA levels in model organisms
  and humans. Hepatic mIndy expression levels are upregulated by glucagon released
  during early starvation via a cAMP and cAMP-responsive-element binding-protein (CREB)-dependent
  mechanism. A CREB binding site (C-BS) was identified in the promoter region of mINDY.
  Increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) associated with inflammation and metabolic
  disease, activate transcription of hepatic mIndy via the signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT-3) signaling pathway. Diet and benzo[a]pyrene activate
  aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its heterodimerization to AhR nuclear translocator
  (ARNT). In nucleus AhR activates transcription of mIndy via binding to potential
  binding site (BS) in the mIndy promoter (). Rifampicin activates the pregnane X
  receptor (PXR), which increases mIndy transcription by activation of two enhancer
  modules located upstream of the mIndy (SLC13A5) transcriptional start site (). Increased
  INDY levels result in higher citrate uptake and its incorporation in lipids, leading
  to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), insulin resistance and type 2-diabetes
  (T2D).
