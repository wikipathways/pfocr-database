caption: NER is the major DNA repair pathway in mammals which removes UV-induced CPDs
  and (6–4) PPs from the genomic DNA. It is broadly classified as global genomic NER
  (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER). Of the two, GG-NER is the major
  type of NER which is initiated upon detection of photolesions by XPC (sensor proteins),
  which then recruits other NER proteins. NER in its entirety is a self-driven process
  which helps maintain the genomic integrity of the cell; however, it takes input
  from various cellular process to function effectively. In melanocytes, apart from
  the standard endogenous regulator of NER, it is influenced by exogenous factors
  like the melanin stimulating hormone (MSH) and endothelin 1 (ET1), classified as
  paracrine factors. These factors influence the DNA damage sensor protein ATR, which
  in turn influences NER either directly through a p53-mediated pathway or by stabilization
  of XPA, an essential rate-limiting protein of NER. In parallel, the circadian clock
  influences NER through transcriptional regulation of XPA. Overall, the clock regulation
  of NER makes the process efficient, as it anticipates the requirement of NER according
  to time of the day.
