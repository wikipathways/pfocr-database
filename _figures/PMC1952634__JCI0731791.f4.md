caption: (i) Amplification. Prostate cancer cells develop the ability to utilize low
  levels of androgen for survival by increased sensitivity of the AR to testosterone
  (T), by increased local conversion of testosterone to DHT by 5α-reductase, and by
  increased numbers of ARs. Once DHT binds to AR, the receptor dimerizes and phosphorylates
  and is transported to the nucleus, where it binds to androgen-responsive elements
  of genes. This process is modulated by cofactors that act as coactivators and corepressors
  and results in increased cell proliferation and survival. (ii) Promiscuous pathway.
  Nonandrogenic steroid molecules normally present in the circulation, as well as
  antiandrogens, bind and activate the AR. (iii) Outlaw pathway. AR is activated by
  phosphorylation by nonhormone growth factors through their tyrosine kinase receptors.
  (iv) Bypass pathway. Prostate cancer cells develop the ability to survive independent
  of AR. The best-known bypass pathway occurs through upregulation of the molecule
  Bcl-2 by androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, which protects them from apoptosis.
  (v) Stem cell regeneration. Prostate cancer stem cells, which are not dependent
  on the AR for survival, continually resupply the tumor cell population. SHBG, sex
  hormone–binding globulin; HSP, heat shock protein; GFR, growth factor receptor;
  P, phosphate group; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; Grb2, growth factor receptor–bound
  protein–2; SOS, son of sevenless. Figure modified from Clinical Cancer Research
