caption: Proposed mechanisms for the pro-tumor effects of propofol. Propofol enhances
  migration of breast cancer cells by increasing intracellular Ca2+ level and rearrangement
  of F-action. Propofol also promotes cell proliferation through Nrf2 pathway, and
  inhibits apoptosis by decreasing the expression of p53 and caspase-3
