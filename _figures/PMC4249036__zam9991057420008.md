caption: Schematic diagram depicting the activation of lipA expression by the Gac-Rsm
  system in P. protegens Pf-5. Transcription of three sRNAs (RsmX, RsmY, and RsmZ)
  depends on the presence of GacA. The function of sRNAs is to relieve translational
  repression of two RNA-binding proteins, RsmA and RsmE. RsmA mainly activates lipA
  translation by inhibiting rsmE translation, but it also represses lipA transcription
  via an unknown pathway. However, RsmE inhibits lipA translation by binding to the
  SD sequence of lipA mRNA. Among these regulatory pathways, the RsmE-mediated pathway
  plays a major role in the regulation of lipA expression. Solid line, direct regulation;
  dotted line, indirect regulation; double line, physical interaction; arrow, positive
  effect; bar, negative effect.
