caption: RNA Silencing. The RNA silencing pathway in plants and animals. In general,
  small RNA duplexes are generated from long viral dsRNA (in the case of siRNAs) or
  from single stranded RNA with stem loop structures (in the case of miRNAs). In vertebrates,
  miRNAs are generated in two steps. A stem-loop structure in the primary transcript
  (pri-miRNA) is cleaved by an RNase, Drosha, into pre-miRNA, which is then trimmed
  by Dicer into a mature miRNA duplex. The vertebrate Dicer generates small RNA duplexes
  only from single stranded RNA precursors with specific types of RNA secondary structure
  (stem-loops) and lacks the ability to process long dsRNA substrates. Long dsRNA
  molecules are potent triggers of the IFN response in vertebrates. Plants and invertebrates
  have multiple Dicer proteins, some of which can process long dsRNA substrates into
  siRNA. In many plants and invertebrates, the RNAi response is also amplified by
  the generation of secondary siRNAs by RDRPs from the RNAi degradation products and
  the spread of siRNA between cells (systemic RNAi). After the mature small RNA duplex
  is generated, the guide strand is loaded onto an Argonaute (AGO) family protein
  in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). One of the strands of the RNA duplex,
  called a guide strand, is loaded onto a member of the AGO family protein in the
  RISC. The guide strand directs RISC to complementary targets in mRNA (indicated
  in red). Some AGO family proteins have slicer activity and can catalytically cleave
  the target mRNA. This also requires an extensive match of the guide strand with
  the target. AGO family members lacking slicer activity induce translational suppression
  of the target mRNA. In vertebrates, this does not require perfect complementarity
  of the guide strand with the target, and the ability of the 5′ end of the guide
  strand (seed region) to base-pair with the target mRNA is crucial in determining
  its specificity. Most organisms have both types of AGO family proteins.
