caption: PG‐cytokine crosstalk in the regulation of lymphocyte‐mediated chronic inflammatory
  responses. (A) PGE2 and PGI2 crosstalk with IL‐12 and IL‐23 signalling pathways
  in Th1 and Th17/Th22 cells, respectively, and promote differentiation and expansion
  of these Th cell subsets both in vitro and in vivo, producing inflammatory cytokines
  such as IFN‐γ, IL‐17A, IL‐17F and IL‐22. These PG actions underlie Th1 and Th17
  cell‐mediated autoimmune inflammation in mouse models of MS, RA, IBD, atopic dermatitis
  (AD) and psoriasis. (B) In response to IL‐23 stimulation, type 3 innate lymphoid
  cells (ILC3) produce the cytokine IL‐22, critical to epithelial homeostasis and
  modulation of inflammation. PGE2 has been shown to augment IL‐23‐induced IL‐22 production
  from ILC3s through the EP4‐cAMP‐PKA pathway, facilitating intestinal epithelial
  homeostasis and control of systemic inflammation. (C) PGE2 and PGI2 inhibit antigen‐dependent
  activation of Th2 cells and production of type 2 cytokines (e.g. IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐13)
  and thus limit type 2 allergic inflammation. In contrast, PGD2 promotes allergic
  inflammation through DP2 receptor‐mediated Th2 cell migration. (D) Epithelial cytokines
  such as IL‐25, IL‐33 or thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) stimulate ILC2 to produce
  type 2 cytokines, developing type 2 allergic immune diseases such as asthma and
  AD. While PGD2 promotes type 2 allergic immune responses through driving ILC2 cell
  migration via DP2 receptors, PGI2 and PGE2 inhibit allergic immune responses through
  suppressing epithelial cytokine‐induced production of type 2 cytokines from ILC2
  cells.
