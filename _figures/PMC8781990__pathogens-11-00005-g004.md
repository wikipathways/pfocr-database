caption: The SPS sensing system of C. albicans. Ssy1 is the primary amino acid sensor
  that functions with the scaffold protein Ptr3 and the protease Ssy5 as a multimeric
  receptor complex. Stp1 and Stp2 are the effector transcription factors of this pathway.
  ((Left panel), OFF state) In the absence of extracellular amino acids, Stp1 and
  Stp2 are produced as latent cytoplasmic precursors that are retained in the cytosol
  due to N-terminal regulatory domains that possess both a cytoplasmic retention motif
  and a nuclear degron, the latter recognized by the E3-ubiquitin ligase, Asi3. ((Right
  panel), ON state) In the presence of amino acids, Ssy1 is stabilized in a signaling
  conformation, which initiates downstream events, resulting in the activation of
  the Ssy5 protease. Activated Ssy5 endoproteolytically cleaves the N-terminal regulatory
  domains of Stp1 and Stp2. The shorter, cleaved forms efficiently translocate into
  the nucleus, where they bind upstream activating sequences (UASaa) and induce the
  expression of SPS-regulated genes (SRG). Importantly, Stp1 and Stp2 induce divergent
  subsets of genes, and STP1 expression is under NCR control; STP1 is repressed in
  cells grown in the presence of millimolar concentrations of amino acids, whereas
  Stp2 is constitutively expressed. Activated Stp2 induces the expression of amino
  acid permease (AAP) genes. AAPs are translated and initially inserted in the ER
  membrane, where they require the assistance of the ER-membrane-localized chaperone
  Csh3, the ortholog of yeast Shr3, to attain native structures. In the absence of
  Csh3, AAPs aggregate and are retained in the ER. Activated Stp1 derepresses the
  expression of SAP2, a secreted protease, and multiple oligopeptide transporter genes
  that facilitate peptide uptake. Stp1 triggers responses required for host protein
  utilization, whereas Stp2 induces amino acid utilization.
