caption: Functional plasticity of Tregs and Th17 cells. Multiple molecules can affect
  the functional plasticity of Tregs and Th17 cells. TGF-β and IL-2 induce the differentiation
  of Tregs, which exert immunosuppressive functions and promote immune escape through
  the secretion of inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and VEGF or through the cell-mediated
  engagement of inhibitory checkpoint molecules such as GITR, PD-1, CTLA-4, TIGIT,
  CD25, IDO1, and GARP. IL-1β induces alternative splicing of FoxP3, inhibits Treg
  cell differentiation, and promotes IL-17 production. RORγt is a key transcription
  factor in Th17 cell development. The SKI-SMAD4 complex inhibits RORγt, in which
  the SKI protein inhibits acetylation of the Rorc site. TGF-β was shown to modulate
  the SKI-SMAD4 complex, and in the presence of TGF-β, SKI is degraded, allowing RORγt
  to be expressed in CD4+ T cells and ultimately driving Th17 cell differentiation.
  IL-2 induces STAT5, reduces STAT3 binding, and inhibits Th17 differentiation. PTEN
  in Th17 cells inhibits the IL-2 signaling pathway, reduces STAT5 and Treg differentiation,
  and upregulates STAT3. When FoxP3+ Tregs are exposed to IL-6 with or without IL-1β
  and IL-23, FoxP3 is downregulated, which promotes the expression of Th17 genes,
  including IL-17, IL-22, IL-23R, and RORγt. TGF-β and PGE2 can also induce Th17-to-Treg
  cell conversion

    RORγt is a key transcription factor in Th17 cell development. The SKI-SMAD4 complex
