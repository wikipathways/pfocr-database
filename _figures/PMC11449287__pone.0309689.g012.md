caption: (A and B) The RNA-seq data shown in S4 Fig were used. Expression levels of
  each gene were visualized on KEGG pathway maps of “TNF signaling pathway” (A) and
  “p53 signaling pathway” (B), as described in the Materials and Methods. The red
  and green colors, according to shading, show an increase and decrease in gene expression,
  respectively, with D2O treatment compared to H2O treatment. (A) Characteristic groups
  of genes with increased or decreased expression are surrounded by red or green dashed
  lines, respectively

  transcription, presumably via quantum-level mechanisms of kinetic isotope effects
