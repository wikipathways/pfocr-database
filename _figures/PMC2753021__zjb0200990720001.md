caption: Pivotal role of the GuaAB proteins in the purine salvage pathway of B. burgdorferi.
  A novel pathway for purine salvage has recently been elucidated for B. burgdorferi
  (). Extracellular adenine and hypoxanthine are salvaged by B. burgdorferi from mammalian
  and tick host environments (). Following transport, adenine can be converted to
  hypoxanthine by adenine deaminase (BBK17) (). This pathway proposes two possible
  fates for hypoxanthine, as follows. (i) Hypoxanthine is converted to IMP by a putative
  xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (BB0103), IMP is converted to XMP by
  IMPDH (GuaB or BBB17), and XMP is converted to GMP by GMP synthase (GuaA or BBB18),
  resulting in guanine nucleotides for RNA synthesis. (ii) Direct transport of deoxynucleosides
  appears to provide a source of deoxyribose for interconversion of hypoxanthine to
  deoxyinosine by a deoxyribosyl transferase (BB0426) (). dIMP is generated by a putative
  deoxynucleotide kinase (BB0239). GuaB converts dIMP to dXMP, and GuaA converts dXMP
  to dGMP, providing guanine deoxynucleotides for DNA synthesis (). Salvage of free
  guanine nucleosides and guanine deoxynucleosides, when they are available in the
  host environment, may allow B. burgdorferi to circumvent the GuaAB requirement for
  GMP and dGMP biosynthesis. The dashed arrows indicate dephosphorylation of nucleotide
  monophosphate or deoxynucleotide monophosphate prior to transport by the spirochete
  and rephosphorylation of nucleoside and deoxynucleoside to nucleotide triphosphate
  and deoxynucleotide triphosphate, respectively, for RNA and DNA synthesis. NMP,
  nucleotide monophosphate; N, nucleoside; dN, deoxynucleoside; dNMP, deoxynucleotide
  monophosphate; OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane.
