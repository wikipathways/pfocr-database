caption: Model for FRK-1 regulation of Wnt asymmetry in dividing seam cells. During
  normal seam cell divisions, high levels of FRK-1 in the anterior nucleus influence
  POP-1 accumulation, while low levels of FRK-1 facilitate export from the posterior
  seam cell (top). FRK-1 activity is likely via modification of the WRM-1 complex
  or perhaps through POP-1 to prevent a WRM-1/POP-1 interaction. Additionally, FRK-1
  appears to act in parallel with SYS-1 in either case. In the absence of FRK-1, the
  WRM-1 complex is improperly localized, with no change in SYS-1, compromising the
  fate of each daughter cell (bottom), resulting in a symmetric division with an anterior
  cell size but more posterior gene expression pattern. Thus, the cells in the bottom
  frame are labeled “compromised” because it cannot be assumed that the posterior
  fate is the default setting in the absence of FRK-1, since normally there are low
  levels of FRK-1 in the posterior nucleus, as opposed to none.
