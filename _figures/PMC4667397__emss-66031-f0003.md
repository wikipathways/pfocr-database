caption: (A) Different stages of Drosophila neurogenesis. NBs (blue) are generated
  during embryonic development; enter quiescence at the embryo to larva transition;
  re-enter the cell cycle in early larval stages; and cease proliferating during pupal
  stages. Embryonic and pupal NBs do not increase back to the size of their parent
  NB after each asymmetric cell division, whereas larval NBs do re-grow. (B) NB exit
  from quiescence in early larval stages is triggered by larval feeding. Amino acids
  are sensed by the receptor Slimfast (Slif) in the fat body. Slif activates the TOR
  pathway and the release of a fat body derived signal (FDS). The FDS stimulates glial
  cells to secrete Insulin like peptides (dILPs) that activate Insulin signaling and
  PI3K/TOR signaling in NBs and consequently their proliferation. (C) The switch from
  growing larval NBs to shrinking pupal NBs is triggered by a pulse of Ecdysone (Ecd)
  at the larva to pupa transition. Ecd is produced and released by the prothoracic
  gland (PG), a component of the ring gland. The secreted Ecd binds to its receptor,
  EcR, in NBs where it induces this change in NB growth properties and, ultimately,
  NB disappearance.
