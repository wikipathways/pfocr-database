caption: A In wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the heme biosynthetic pathway is
  bifurcated between the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Blue arrows depict transport
  across mitochondrial membranes. B In engineered S. cerevisiae, heme was synthesized
  via the protoporphyrin-dependent and coproporphyrin-dependent pathways. The coproporphyrin-dependent
  pathway, which is not present in the wild type, was completed by introducing HemQ
  from Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, the complete pathways were targeted to
  mitochondria by attaching mitochondria targeting sequences (MTSs) at the N-terminus
  of HEM2, HEM3, HEM4, HEM12, and HemQ
