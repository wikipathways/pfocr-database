  a Bubble plot displaying the pyroptosis pathway associated genes that are significantly
  differentially expressed between human ASH or CA and healthy control. The bubble
  color represents different change modes of the expression level. b Schematic diagram
  illustrating the pyroptosis signaling pathway
