caption: Astrocytes protect dopaminergic neurons against aminochrome neurotoxicity.
  Astrocytes secrete GSTM2 which is internalized by dopaminergic neurons in order
  to increase their protection against aminochrome. Dopamine oxidation to neuromelanin
  is a harmless pathway due to the presence of DT-diaphorase and GSTM2 that prevent
  aminochrome-dependent neurotoxicity by inhibiting the formation of alpha-synuclein
  (SNCA) neurotoxic oligomers, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, autophagy,
  and proteasome dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress.
