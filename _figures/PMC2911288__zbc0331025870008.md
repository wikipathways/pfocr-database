caption: Model for the signaling pathway of ApNHE3 activation upon oocyte spawning.
  Upon stimulation with 1-MeAde, prophase-arrested ovarian oocytes resume meiosis
  and arrest at metaphase of meiosis I. Starfish NHE (ApNHE3) is up-regulated downstream
  of PI3K (arrow marked with ①) within 10 min of hormone treatment. The active state
  of ApNHE3 is maintained until or even after spawning, however, cytoplasmic alkalization
  of MI-arrested ovarian oocytes is impaired (<7.0) presumably by acidic pH of ovarian
  fluid (∼5.8) and also by an unknown mechanism. Once released into seawater, MI-arrested
  oocytes resume and complete meiosis. Upon spawning, a prominent increase of pHi
  (∼7.4) is driven cooperatively by NHE and extracellular alkalization (pH 8.0). Shortly
  after spawning, MAPK is activated, which stimulates p90Rsk activation. Active p90Rsk
  then phosphorylates ApNHE3 (arrow marked with ②) to sustain elevated pHi homeostasis
  during GI-phase. MAPK continues to be active for ∼8 h after hormone treatment, and
  becomes inactivated spontaneously. Accordingly, dephosphorylation of ApNHE3 and
  a decrease of pHi occur simultaneously, followed by onset of membrane blebbing,
  an initial phase of apoptosis.
