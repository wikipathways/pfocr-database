caption: Sixteen genes associated with enzastaurin response were established by pathway
  analyses and prediction of drug response using an eight-gene signature. (A) Sixteen
  genes (blue circle) associated with enzastaurin response and PKC (red circle) belonged
  to the same signal pathway. (B) Principal component analysis based on the eight-gene
  profile correctly distinguished the sensitive cells from the resistant ones. The
  colour reproduction of this figure is available at the British Journal of Cancer
  online.
