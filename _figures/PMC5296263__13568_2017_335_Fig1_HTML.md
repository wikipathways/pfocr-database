caption: 'Metabolic map representing the main mechanisms that connect the xylose consumption
  pathway with the PHB producing pathway. Two alternative xylose reductases (XR) are
  represented: wild-type XR from S. stipitis present in TMB4443 and a mutated version
  of it that has different cofactor affinity present in TMB4425. The size of the size
  of the letters in the XR alternatives represent the preference for NADPH or NADH
  (bigger size → higher affinity). Two alternative acetoacetyl-CoA reductases that
  are part of the PHB producing pathway from acetyl-CoA are also shown: the first
  from Cupriviadus necator (present in TMB4443) and the second from Allochromatium
  vinosum (present in TMB4425). The dashed arrows represent more than one metabolic
  reaction in order to simplify the scheme'
