caption: The mechanism of cold tolerance in plants. Cold is sensed by receptors in
  the plant membrane and followed by the increase of Ca2+, CAMP, ROS, and ABA as well.
  The chloroplast modulates the signal to the nucleus through ROS production while
  Ca2+signaling mediates plant response to cold stress. Besides, Ca2+, CAMP, and ROS
  signaling mediate signal transduction via CBL, CPKs/CDPKs, and CIPKs to the nucleus
  through a pathway mediated by ICE-CBF TFs. The MEKK1–MKK2–MPK4 cascade and mitogen-activated
  protein kinases also involve in the gene regulatory network to regulate TFs and
  cold tolerance genes. ICE1 and CBFs (member of AP2/ERF TF family) are associated
  with the COR signaling pathway to increase cold tolerance in plants. Furthermore,
  WRKY, bZIP, MYB, bHLH, C2H2, NAC, and other AP2/ERF transcription factor members
  regulate gene expression for the activation of COR genes. In addition, the CBFs
  were induced by other TF families, such as WRKY, bHLH, bZIP, MYB, NAC, and C2H2.
  The up-regulated CBFs regulate and activate the expression of COR genes and resulted
  in improving cold tolerance in plants
