caption: Proposed model for the NOTCH-ROCK pathway and its biological significance.
  NOTCH1 can be activated by dissociation of cells with EDTA as well as physiological
  ligand binding. The cytoplasmic form of NOTCH1, independent of its transcriptional
  activity, triggers caspase-mediated cleavage (activation) of ROCK1 by an as-yet-unknown
  mechanism. ROCK1 activation drives actomyocin reorganization through MYPT phosphorylation
  which results in cell differentiation or loss of stemness. The ROCK inhibitor Y-27632
  blocks this pathway so as to inhibit differentiation of keratinocytes and maintain
  stemness of hiPSCs, as shown in this study.
