caption: Graphical illustration of molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Wnt
  signaling in regulating both paracellular transport and transcytosis across the
  retinal vascular endothelium. Under physiological conditions in the retina, a Wnt
  ligand (Norrin or Wnt) binds to the FZD4 receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptor complex
  to activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in RMECs. This prevents phosphorylation
  and degradation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. Stabilized cytoplasmic β-catenin
  may either become a major component of adherens junctions to regulate paracellular-mediated
  iBRB integrity by stabilizing tight junctional proteins such as Claudin5, or translocate
  into the nucleus to directly bind to and activate expression of Claudin5 and Mfsd2a
  genes. Whereas the former, Claudin5, is important for maintaining paracellular-dependent
  iBRB integrity, the latter, MFSD2A, is a membrane transport protein that represses
  CAV1 protein levels, inhibits CAV1-positive caveolae formation, and restricts EC
  caveolar transcytosis to maintain iBRB integrity. FZD, Frizzled; LRP, low-density
  lipoprotein receptor-related protein; TCF, T cell factor; MFSD2A, major facilitator
  superfamily domain-containing protein 2a; CAV1, caveolin-1; RMEC, retinal microvascular
  endothelial cells; iBRB, inner blood–retinal barrier; EC, endothelial cells. Figure
