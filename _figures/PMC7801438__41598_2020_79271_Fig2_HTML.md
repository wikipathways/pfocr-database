caption: Cellular respiration is a metabolic pathway consisting of two major locations,
  in the cellular cytoplasm for glycolysis and in mitochondria, which produce ATP,
  in which the “committed” step of glycolysis at pacemaker PFK-1 activity is modulated
  by allosteric activators, including ADP, F6P, and phosphate (Pi), as well as those
  inactivators of citrate, fatty acids, and ATP. In the whole reaction, water is necessary.
  There are water channels (shaded yellow) in the protein to regulate the distribution
  of water.
