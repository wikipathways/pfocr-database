caption: Proposed model of the salt stress response of Qinghua45 (QH) and Biyuchunhua
  (BY). Salt stress resulted in Chinese cabbage suffering from ion stress and osmotic
  stress. Na+ content increased under salt stress. Salt-tolerant plants promote the
  transport of sodium ions in vacuoles, increase calcium content through ER stress
  signaling VDAC and indirectly promote the transport of sodium ions to vacuoles through
  the SOS2pathway. Galactinol synthase and soluble protein content increased to balance
  the osmotic pressure.
