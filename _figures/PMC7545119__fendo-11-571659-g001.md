caption: Diagram of substrate utilization and suspected pathways in BAT. Glucose enters
  the brown adipocyte via GLUT4 and GLUT1 where it undergoes glycolysis to form pyruvate.
  Pyruvate is converted to lactate and exported from the cell by the monocarboxylate
  (MCT) transporters, this pathway accounts for the majority of glucose uptake by
  human BAT during both warm and cold exposure. Following export, lactate may activate
  GPR81 which inhibits lipolysis. Alternatively, pyruvate can enter the mitochondria
  and be incorporated into the TCA cycle following conversion to acetyl-CoA. Citrate,
  one of the TCA cycle intermediates, may also be converted to acetyl-CoA in the cytosol
  as the first step of de novo lipogenesis (DNL). A proportion of glucose may be converted
  to glycerol-3-phosphate (Glycerol-3-P), generated from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  during glycolysis, to form the backbone for replenishment of intracellular triglycerides
  (TRGs). Free fatty acids (FFAs) hydrolysed from local TRGs are the primary energy
  substrate used for uncoupled respiration during thermogenesis, which is mediated
  by mitochondrial UCP1. Glycerol released by this process can either be exported
  or recycled through conversion to Glycerol-3-P by glycerol kinase (GK) for subsequent
  TRG synthesis. In addition to DNL, uptake of circulating FFAs either directly or
  following lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated hydrolysis of triglyceride rich lipoproteins
  (TRLs) occurs via the fatty acid transporters or potentially by passive diffusion.
  BAT utilizes other circulating substrates during thermogenesis such as BCAAs, succinate
  and glutamate which are all likely incorporated into the TCA cycle. Arrows in black
  indicate substrate transport/movement. Arrows in red represent enzymatic conversion.
  Wording in black indicate pathway confirmed both in human and rodent BAT. Wording
  in blue indicate pathways confirmed in rodent BAT. Some reactions have been simplified/omitted
  for brevity. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACL, ATP citrate lyase; AGPAT2, 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate
