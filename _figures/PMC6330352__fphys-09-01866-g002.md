caption: Cardiac and macrophage inflammatory pathways. In metabolic disorders, enlargement
  of adipocytes contributes to the activation of macrophages and release of SFFAs
  through lipolysis (). The exposure of cells to increased levels of these inflammatory
  molecules leads to the activation of inflammatory pathways. The cartoon representation
  shows the activation of the TLR signaling pathways (MyD88-dependent and -independent),
  by SFFAs in both macrophages and cardiomyocytes. Infiltration of cardiomyocytes
  by M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages may lead to cardiac electrical dysfunction, cause
  arrythmias leading to cardiomyopathies of metabolic disorders. The MyD88-dependent
  pathway involves sequentially, activation of IRAK4, phosphorylation of IRAK1/2,
  and TRAF6, followed by activation of IKK and NF-κB, and the subsequent production
  or secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β). The MyD88-independent
  pathway also involves the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines through activation
  of TRAF6 by TRAM/TRIF. SFFA, Saturated free-fatty acid; TLR, Toll-like receptor;
  MD-2, myeloid differentiation protein-2; TIR, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor; TRIF,
  TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β; TRAM, TRIF-related adapter
  molecule; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; IRAK, interleukin-1
  receptor-associated kinase; TAK, transforming growth factor β activated kinase;
  IKK, inhibitory kappa B alpha kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; Ub, ubiquitin.
