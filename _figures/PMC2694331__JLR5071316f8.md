caption: Three major pathways in which ABCA1 and HDL might be involved. The first
  (A) represents the centripetal movement of cholesterol out of the parenchymal cells
  of the peripheral organs during plasma membrane sterol turnover. The contribution
  of synthesis and LDL-C uptake to this normal turnover is shown for both the abca1+/+
  (numbers without parentheses) and abca1−/− (numbers in parentheses) animals. Also
  shown are the rates of cholesteryl ester movement from HDL to the liver and the
  rates of total sterol excretion in the feces. The second pathway (B) represents
  reverse cholesterol transport from primarily macrophages in the periphery. These
  flux rates are very small and essentially unmeasurable. Finally, the third pathway
  (C) illustrates the role of ABCA1 in transferring cholesterol and phospholipids
  from cells of the liver and small bowel to newly synthesized apoAI in order to prevent
  its rapid degradation and excretion by the kidneys. Again, this flux is presumably
  very small.
