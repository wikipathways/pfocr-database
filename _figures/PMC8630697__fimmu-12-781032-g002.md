caption: Shows the effect of the cGAS-STING pathway on different types of cells in
  the pancreas. The cGAS-STING pathway exacerbates acute pancreatitis by increasing
  tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and IFNβ. On the other hand, this pathway regulates
  the production of Th17, which protects against chronic pancreatitis. The cGAS-STING
  pathway is also involved in the lipotoxic injury of β cells.
