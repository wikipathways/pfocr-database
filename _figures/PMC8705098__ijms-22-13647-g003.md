caption: Microglial cells (shown in green) under physiological conditions have ramified
  appearance and are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (neuronal
  cells shown in yellow). Microglia are involved in a variety of functions such as
  pruning of synapses, phagocytosis of pathogens, apoptotic and necrotic cells, and
  regulation of neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity, thus helping in overall effective
  functioning of the central nervous system. During development of the brain, synaptic
  pruning takes place where the complement system aids microglia in the removal of
  weak synapses. However, in AD, neurons and glial cells synthesise and secrete complement
  proteins such as C1q. C1q can bind to synapses and cause activation of the complement
  classical pathway leading to cleavage of C3 to yield C3b, an opsonin which will
  tag synapses. Microglia recognise the tagged C3b neurons via their CR3 receptor
  and phagocytose the neurons which can eventually lead to neurodegeneration. (Figure

  disorders and emerging complement-targeted therapeutics. Nat Rev Neurol. 2020, 16,
