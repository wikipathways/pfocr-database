caption: Schematic diagram illustrating central role for ROS and Src in hypoxia-induced
  pY654-β-catenin/HIF1α formation and tumor EMT. Hypoxia exposure generates reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and stabilizes HIF1α (). Increased ROS activity results in
  the activation of Src family kinase(s) (p-Src) () that then promotes activation
  of tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and c-Met, further promoting p-Src. Active Src
  phosphorylates β-catenin at Y654, favoring β-catenin association with HIF1α over
  β-catenin degradation, binding to E-cadherin, or association with TCFs in the Wnt
  pathway. pY654-β-catenin/HIF1α complexes promote transcription of EMT genes as well
  as other hypoxia responsive genes. Although not shown, Src is also in complexes
  of pY654-β-catenin/HIF1α. TGFβ1 signaling is not enhanced by hypoxia but remains
  active within the tumor microenvironment and further promotes hypoxia-induced EMT.
