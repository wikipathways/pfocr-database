caption: 'Schematic diagram showing the role of quercetin in reversal effect of docetaxel
  resistance. As depicted: (1) quercetin inhibits androgen receptor and PI3K/Akt signal
  pathway; (2) quercetin reverses EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and stem-like
  cell phenotypes of docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells; (3) docetaxel up-regulates
  P-gp, quercetin down-regulates P-gp; (4) although docetaxel can induce apoptosis
  through stabilizing microtubule, P-gp pumps out docetaxel to keep it at a low level
  in cytoplasm. Q is short for quercetin; Q'' is short for quercetin metabolites;
  D is short for docetaxel; D'' is short for docetaxel metabolites, P is short for
  phosphorylation; T is short for testosterone; DHT is short for double hydrogen testosterone;
  AR is short for androgen receptor; HSPs is short for heat shock proteins. The →
  indicates activation or induction, and → indicates inhibition or blockade.'
