caption: Expression profiling of proteome reveals co-expression clusters and functional
  modules in HCC. (A) Distribution of modules size. Modules were identified by the
  superimposition of proteins in HCC onto the PPI network. The numbers of members
  from each module are exhibited in the figure. (B) Five interconnected modules of
  cell cycle derived from HCC, presenting the protein names and representative functional
  terms. (C) Allocation of 121 modules. Each node represents the individual module
  and their interactions by the module size. Edges connect modules that share PPIs.
  Boxed modules are further enlarged in (B) and (D). (D) Modules of DNA replication,
  epoxygenase P450 pathway, fatty acid beta-oxidation using acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  and long-chain fatty acid biosynthetic process derived from HCC. HCC, hepatocellular
  carcinoma; PPI, protein-protein interaction.
