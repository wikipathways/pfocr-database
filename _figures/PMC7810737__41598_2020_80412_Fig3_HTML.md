caption: Pathway analysis of metabolites with significant differentially quantified
  concentrations using MetaboAnalyst–. Red indicates upregulation in DEL and green
  denotes downregulation. Grey represents metabolites not included in our targeted
  metabolomics protocol. Superscripts signify direction of change for the metabolites
  that did not exhibit significant differential concentrations. The +, −, and × superscripts
  indicate upregulated (in DEL), downregulated (in DEL), and signal too low or not
  present, respectively. (a) At PREOP, the valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis
  pathway was the only one with metabolites with significantly differentially quantified
  concentrations (FDR < 0.04). Dashed boxes represent the reactions that are specific
  to human. (b) At POD2, the citrate cycle pathway was the most significantly enriched.
