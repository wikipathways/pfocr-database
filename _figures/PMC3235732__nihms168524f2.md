caption: At the top is an image of a reconstructed SNc DA neuron showing the pacemaker
  driven somatic spiking and dendritic Ca2+ oscillations associated with pacemaking.
  This dendritic Ca2+ influx is attributable almost entirely to flux through Cav1.3
  Ca2+ channels. At the bottom is a cartoon depicting the hypothetical mechanisms
  involved in elevating mitochondrial oxidative stress. Ca2+ influx through Cav1.3
  channels is either sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum by uptake through smooth
  endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ (SERCA) pumps or taken up by mitochondria through channels
  created by voltage dependent anion channels (VDAC) and Ca2+ uniporter (UP); the
  extent to which this pathway is important is in question (hence the question mark
  on the arrow). Ca2+ could also enter mitochondria through this VDAC/UP channel at
  points of apposition between the ER and mitochondra where inositol trisphosphate
  receptors (IP3) and/or ryanodine receptors (IP3R/RYR) are positioned at specializations
  – mitochondrial associated membrane (MAM). This entry route has not been established
  in SNc DA neurons, hence the question mark. Ca2+ entering through Cav1.3 channels
  is moved back across the plasma membrane through either the Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) or
  through a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) that relies upon the Na+ gradient maintained
  by the Na/K ATPase at energetic cost; leading to conversion of ATP to ADP. ADP and
  ATP are exchanged by mitochondria with the VDAC and adenine nucleotide transporter
  (ANT). ADP stimulates oxidative phosphorylation. Ca2+ entering the mitochondrial
  matrix can stimulate enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that produces
  reducing equivalents for the electron transport chain (ETC); complex I through V
  are shown at the inner mitochondrial membrane; complex V (ATP synthase) uses the
  electrochemical gradient to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate
  to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Electron movement along the ETC generates superoxide,
  leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can produce a variety
  of deleterious effects that can be viewed as accelerated aging (red arrow at the
  bottom). One other action of ROS is to promote opening of the mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore (mPTP); irreversible opening of the mPTP leads to release of pro-apoptetic
  factors into the cytosol. A basic question is whether reversible opening of the
  mPTP is possible under conditions of mild oxidative stress; mPTP opening and depolarization
  of the inner mitochondrial membrane could serve to diminish ROS production. Ca2+
  is removed from mitochondrial through mitochrondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCXs).
  Lastly, genetic mutations associated with Parkinson's disease, like those to DJ-1
  or PINK1, might directly compromise the competence of mitochondria, leading to accelerated
  aging or increased oxidative stress.
