caption: 'Impact of elm leaf beetle egg deposition and larval feeding on putatively
  identified Ulmus minor phenylpropanoid metabolites. UHPLC/ESI–QTOFMS-analysis of
  semipolar compounds present in a methanolic elm leaf extract. a Heatmap shows log2
  fold change of metabolite levels in a treated leaf relative to an untreated control
  leaf. Relative peak areas were standardised to leaf fresh weight. Log2 fold change
  relative to control was calculated by log2 of the ratio of the mean peak area per
  metabolite in a treated leaf relative to the mean of the peak area of the respective
  metabolite in the control. Colouring and numbers next to substance names code for
  pathway affiliation (see b). Treated leaves are labelled as follows: E = locally
  egg-treated leaves; F = locally feeding-damaged leaves, 24 h feeding period; EF = locally
  egg-treated, feeding-damaged leaves, 24 h feeding period; C = untreated control
  leaves. Statistics: ANOVA, in case of significance (P < 0.05) followed by Tukey
  test as post-hoc test with single-step adjusted P values. Different letters indicate
  significant differences between treatments (P < 0.05); n = 9–10. Compounds referred
  to twice are isomeric structures with the same molecular weight but differing retention
  times. b Simplified visualisation of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Colours and indexed
  numbers represent the compound affiliation of respective compounds in the heatmap
  shown in a. Enzymes catalysing selected biosynthetic steps are indicated; PAL phenylalanine
  ammonia lyase, 4CL 4-coumarate ligase, HCT shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyl-transferase,
  CAD cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, COMT caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, F3H
  flavanone 3-hydroxylase, F3′H flavonoid 3′-monooxygenase, FLS flavonol synthase,
  ANS leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase'
