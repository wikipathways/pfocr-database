caption: 'The Ehrlich pathway in S accharomyces cerevisiae. Phenylalanine is converted
  into 2-phenylethanol in the Ehrlich pathway. The biosynthetic pathway of 2-phenylethanol
  consists of three steps: Phenylalanine is deaminated to phenylpyruvate by transaminases
  (encoded by ARO8 and ARO9). Next, phenylpyruvate is decarboxylated and converted
  into 2-phenylacetaldehyde by decarboxylase (encoded by ARO10). Finally, alcohol
  dehydrogenases (e.g., Adh1p) reduces 2-phenylacetaldehyde to 2-phenylethanol. The
  genes encoding enzymes that catalyze each step are indicated. The transcriptional
  activator Aro80p induces the transcription of ARO9 and ARO10. ARO8 is constitutively
  expressed and not affected by Aro80p.'
