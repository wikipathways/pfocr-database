caption: Predicted pathways for regulating rice drought memory response. The ABA/SnRK2-mediated
  pathway actives downstream genes in response to the first drought stress. ABA might
  act as memory factor to regulate genes related to photosynthesis, proline synthesis
  and ROS repair, result in accumulation of protective substances (such as proline)
  to respond to subsequent drought stress. During this process, TFs might also take
  part in regulating proline synthesis to accumulate proline. Broken lines indicate
  possible, but not confirmed, routes. Full lines represent the routes have been demonstrated
  in previous studies. Heatmap of memory transcripts involved in these pathways are
  shown.
