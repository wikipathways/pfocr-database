caption: Elevated UA and reduced intracellular XOR contribute to tumor cell proliferation,
  migration, and survival. ROS scavenging properties of extracellular UA are postulated
  to promote cancer cell growth and survival in part by protecting cells from oxidative
  stress induced apoptosis. This arises because tumor cells in general exhibit poor
  capacity to survive oxidative stress compared with normal cells and may therefore
  be protected by the antioxidant ROS scavenging properties of UA (J-Shaped dose–response
  curve;  []). Loss of XOR expression in the most aggressive cancer cells also contributes
  to tumor cell proliferation, migration, and survival. In cells showing high level
  XOR expression, XOR modulates COX-2 and MMP expression reducing migratory activity  [].
  However, loss of XOR expression in cancer cells increases COX-2 levels, MMP expression,
  and migratory activity. Loss of XOR expression may arise for many reasons, including
  the entry of UA into cancer cells. Import of UA into XOR deficient cancer cells
  may further promote proliferation and survival in part by stimulating expression
  of COX-2. The diminished XOR expression found in aggressive cancer cells would result
  in shunting the XOR substrates hypoxanthine and xanthine into the salvage pathway,
  providing substrates for nucleotide synthesis, tumor growth, and proliferation.
  The independent effects of leptin on cancer cells notwithstanding  [,], the elevated
  levels of leptin observed in MetS associated cancer may also drive these processes
  both by inducing hyperuricemia and by down regulating cancer cell XOR.
