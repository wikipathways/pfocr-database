caption: Extreme resistance to viruses in potato and soybean hosts. The potato antiviral
  extreme resistance response to Potato virus X (PVX) is conferred by Rx1 in potato
  (A) and extreme resistance to soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is conferred by genes within
  the Rsv1 locus in soybean (B). The first step in immune activation in either pathway
  relies on an nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR) protein, Rx1 in
  potato (A) or an Rsv1 protein in soybean (B), directly or indirectly recognizing
  a pathogen-produced effector protein. The PVX coat protein is likely recognized
  after binding a RANGAP 2 (Rg2) protein “guarded” by Rx1, although this relationship
  is yet to be experimentally validated. After pathogen recognition, the activated
  (ATP-bound) Rx1 then translocates to the nucleus, at which point it binds a GOLDEN
  2-LIKE transcription factor (GLK). The activity of Rx1-GLK complex is likely negatively
  regulated by a bromodomain-containing protein (DBCP). The Rx1-GLK complex binds
  DNA and may regulate expression of defense genes associated with the extreme resistance
  phenotype, although the genes that Rx1-GLK regulates are not known. The activated
  Rx1 protein relies on helper NLR proteins (NRC1, NRC2, and NRC3) to transmit an
  immune response. Rx1-mediated extreme resistance causes translational arrest of
  the PVX genome to occur, possibly through involvement of ARGONAUTE 4. (B) The SMV
  Helper-component protease (HC-Pro) or P3 protein is recognized directly or indirectly
  by an Rsv1 protein. Gene silencing of ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBLITY 1 (EDS1), PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT
  4 (PAD4), JASMONIC ACID-AMINO ACID SYNTHETASE (JAR1), or ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE
  1 (EDR1) abrogates the resistance response. Similarly, silencing of WRKY3 and WRKY6
  disables resistance. In these diagrams, experimentally validated proteins involved
  in extreme resistance are highlighted, while proteins not validated but likely involved
  in extreme resistance responses are faded and have a dashed outline.
