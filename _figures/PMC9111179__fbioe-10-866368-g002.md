caption: Schematic illustration of the process of SARS-CoV-2 infecting the host and
  its life cycle. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates
  the infection by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on
  the surface of host cells (). The virus enters the cell by endocytosis, and then
  releases the RNA genome. Subsequently, the specific sequence translate polyprotein
  (pp)1a/1ab are translated to the polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. Pp1a
  and pp1ab are self-cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) by proteolysis
  (). The nsps coalesce to form replicase/transcriptase complexes containing multiple
  enzymes. Within the complexes, the offspring RNA is transcribed, which is used as
  sub-RNA to translate the structural proteins (E, N, M, S) and some auxiliary proteins
  of the virus (). Then, the structural proteins enter the Golgi intermediate region
  of the endoplasmic reticulum along the secretory pathway to complete self-assembly.
  Meanwhile, the replicated RNA copies bind to N protein to form a ribonucleoprotein
  complex. Through the intake of ribonucleoprotein complex by the viral vesicles,
  the matured viruses are formed and then released outside the cell.
