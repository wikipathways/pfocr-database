caption: Plasmodium falciparum enters a cell cycle stage-dependent slow growth program
  upon extracellular isoleucine removal. If isoleucine is removed in the early stages
  of the cell cycle, P. falciparum enters a state of slow growth in which it can complete
  schizogony and reinvade new erythrocytes. If isoleucine is removed after approximately
  30 h post-invasion, the parasite continues schizogony at the normal rate of growth.
  This refractory point coincides with the onset of S-phase and occurs well after
  establishment of the New Permeability Pathway (NPP) and the PTEX-dependent growth
  arrest point
papertitle: The response of Plasmodium falciparum to isoleucine withdrawal is dependent
  on the stage of progression through the intraerythrocytic cell cycle.
