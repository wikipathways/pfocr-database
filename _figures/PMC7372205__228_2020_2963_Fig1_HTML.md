caption: The ACE2/TMPRSS2 pathway and its interaction with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2
  binds to membrane-bound ACE2 to enter the host cells. This interaction with ACE2
  is mediated via the spike glycoprotein on SARS-CoV-2 surface. Spike protein priming
  is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 and relies upon TMPRSS2. The ectodomain of
  ACE2 can be shed by ADAM-17 generating the soluble form of ACE2 (sACE2). CALM interacts
  with ACE2 and inhibits shedding of its ectodomain. AR activation up-regulates TMPRSS2
  expression, whereas ER activation potentially regulates ACE2 expression. Upregulation
  is represented by green. Potential up- or down-regulation is represented by orange.
  AR, androgen receptor; ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ADAM-17, disintegrin
  metalloproteinase 17; CALM, calmodulin; ERs, oestrogen receptors; sACE2, soluble
  ACE2; TMPRSS2, transmembrane protease, serine 2
