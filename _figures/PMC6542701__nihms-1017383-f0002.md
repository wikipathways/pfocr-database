caption: ER’s coregulatory proteins and genomic binding sites differ between endometrial
  cancer and breast cancer cells. ER binds to mostly different locations in endometrial
  and breast cancer cells and the majority of these differentially bound loci exhibit
  differential chromatin accessibility. FOXA1 and GATA3 play a key role in enabling
  ER genomic binding in breast cancer, but the corresponding transcription factors
  (TF) in endometrial cancer remain unknown with FOXA1 playing a minor role. While
  some ER cofactors (e.g., SRC-3) are shared between breast and endometrial cancer,
  it is unclear if endometrial cancer-specific ER cofactors exist
