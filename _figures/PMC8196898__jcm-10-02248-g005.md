caption: Schematic illustration summarizing the role of JAG1, PTGS2, GUCY2C and PLGF
  in tumor angiogenesis. PLGF (also termed PGF) may promote angiogenesis in vascular
  endothelial cells by binding to the VEGF receptor (VEGFR1), thereby increasing the
  availability of VEGF A for activation of VEGFR2, which exhibits higher kinase activity
  to induce angiogenesis-promoting signaling and other processes that favor tumor
  growth. The Notch pathway is activated through the binding of JAG1, among other
  ligands, to the receptor on the tumor cell surface, releasing the intracellular
  domain from the membrane that translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex
  to induce the transcription of several target genes that favor sustained angiogenesis.
  Transcription of PTGS2 (also termed COX2) mediates the production of prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE2) by tumor cells, which may act in a paracrine way by binding to prostaglandin
  receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3 or EP4) on the endothelial cell and inducing proliferation
  and angiogenesis, or in an autocrine way to further support angiogenesis and tumor
  promotion. In colon cancer, the tumor-suppressor gene GUCY2C (also referred to as
  GC-C) is upregulated but maintained in a hypoactivated state due to a lack of ligands,
  resulting in impaired signaling and leading to loss of genomic integrity, apoptosis
  inhibition and angiogenesis.
