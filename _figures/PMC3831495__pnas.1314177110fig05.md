caption: Putative mechanism of action of proteasome inhibitors and pharmacologic chaperones
  in congenital erythropoietic porphyria. UROSC73R and UROSP248Q proteins are misfolded
  and subjected to premature degradation by the proteasome pathway, leading to a profound
  UROS enzymatic activity deficiency and the accumulation of URO I and COPRO I. Proteasome
  inhibitors could partially rescue UROSC73R and UROSP248Q expression and restore
  the metabolic heme biosynthetic pathway by preventing proteolysis. PCT ideally would
  stabilize UROSP248Q and UROSC73R proteins and prevent premature degradation by the
  proteasome pathway.
