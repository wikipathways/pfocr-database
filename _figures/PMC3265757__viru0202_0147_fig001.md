caption: The role of YjeK and PoxA in the modification of EF-P. (A) A model for the
  post-translational modification of the conserved lysyl 34 residue of EF-P by the
  PoxA and YjeK enzymes. As shown the YjeK enzyme converts L-lysine to (R)-β-lysine,
  which is subsequently ligated onto EF-P to generate the lysyl-β-lysine modification,
  although the order of these two enzymes in this pathway could be reversed. The modified
  elongation factor subsequently interacts with the ribosome and the initiator tRNA
  to facilitate the formation of the first peptide bond of specific transcripts. The
  mechanism underlying why only certain transcripts are regulated by EF-P remains
  unclear. (B) The three dimensional structures of tRNA (left, PDB 1EHZ) and EF-P
  (right, PDB 1UEB) reveal their similar overall structure. The sites of their modification
  by LysRS or by the aaRS paralog, PoxA, are indicated with arrows.
