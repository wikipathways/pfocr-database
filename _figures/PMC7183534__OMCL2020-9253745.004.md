caption: Botanical active substances restrain the EMT process through ERK1/2 signaling.
  High glucose or some growth factors can induce cancer cell EMT through the ERK1/2
  signaling pathway. Botanical active substances, such as andrographolide and allicin,
  can imprison the EMT process through the dephosphorylation (inactivation) of ERK1/2.
