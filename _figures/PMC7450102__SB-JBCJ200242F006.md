caption: Overview of viperin's interaction with other proteins. A, viperin perturbs
  the formation of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, which stalls budding of enveloped
  viruses such as influenza A. This is thought to occur through the down-regulation
  of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes, including FPPS. B, translocation of viperin
  to the mitochondrion results in down-regulation of the thiolase activity of HADHB,
  the β-subunit of the MTP complex involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, which impacts
  ATP production. C, viperin interacts with the protein kinase IRAK1 and E3 ubiquitin
  ligase TRAF6 to facilitate Lys-63–linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1 by TRAF6, thereby
  activating the IRF7-mediated interferon expression. D, viperin interacts with various
  structural and nonstructural viral proteins and promotes their degradation through
  the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway.
