caption: Role of Ctsk+ cells in the pathogenesis of various skeletal system diseases.
  Ctsk+ cells help determine the origin cells of some musculoskeletal system-related
  diseases. Increased secretion of Ctsk from mature osteoclasts and chondrocytes leads
  to enhanced collagenolytic activity and subsequently contributes to osteoporosis,
  OA, and RA. Knockouts of some key genes, such as Bmpr1a, Wnt5a, and Stat3 in Ctsk+
  osteoclasts break the balance of bone formation and resorption. In Ctsk+ mesenchymal
  stem/progenitor cells, Ctsk serves as a genetic marker and helps us deeply understand
  the property and function of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells. PSCs play a significant
  role in intramembranous bone formation under physiological conditions. They differentiate
  into chondrocytes after bone injury, thereby participating in endochondral bone
  formation to promote bone healing. PSCs also serve as pathological precursors in
  osteogenic tumors through the LKB1/AMPK/mTORC1 signaling pathways. Ptpn11 depletion
  in CCPs leads to MC via the ERK and Ihh signaling pathways. Ctsk+ TDPCs with targeted
  Sufu deletion result in heterotopic HO via Hh pathway activation. Translocation
  of GLI2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus transactivates the GLI1 promoter. Increased
  Gli1/Gli2 in Ctsk+ TDPCs enhances the Hh signaling activity and promotes HO progression.
