caption: Roles for Teneurins at diverse synapses. (A) Teneurin function at the Drosophila
  neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Ten-a in the presynaptic motoneuron and Ten-m in the
  postsynaptic muscle interact transsynaptically to organize the cytoskeleton and
  ensure active zone apposition with glutamate receptors (Mosca et al., ). (B) Teneurin
  function in the Drosophila CNS. Ten-a in presynaptic olfactory receptor axons interacts
  transsynaptically with Ten-m in postsynaptic projection neuron dendrites to organize
  the spectrin cytoskeleton and ensure proper active zone and acetylcholine receptor
  number (Mosca and Luo, ). It is unknown whether postsynaptic Ten-m also regulates
  cytoskeletal organization (question mark). (C) Two models of Teneurin function in
  hippocampal neurons. On the left, Teneurin-2 is a postsynaptic receptor for Latrophilin
  (Silva et al., ). The downstream mechanisms that ensure synaptic organization and
  function on both sides remain unknown (question marks). On the right, Ten-1 interacts
  with β-Dystroglycan (β-DG) to activate a MEK/ERK pathway resulting in cytoskeletal
  rearrangement (Chand et al., ). The source of Ten-1, is unknown; though hypothesized
  to be postsynaptic, it could also be presynaptic (question mark). (D) A potential
  model for Teneurin signaling with integrins at the Drosophila NMJ. Ten-m and αPS2
  interact (Graner et al., ), and PGANT3 and PGANT35A regulate Ten-m and integrin
  levels, leading to normal synaptic function (Dani et al., ). Ten-m has a minor presynaptic
  role (Mosca et al., ), and could interact with αPS2 either in cis or trans; as such,
  both models are presented (question mark). It is currently unclear how these interactions
  enable cell adhesion, synaptic organization, and function.
