caption: 'A SASP promotes senescence and fibrosis: senescent cells in the lung secrete
  the SASP. The SASP results in a chronic inflammatory microenvironment around young
  cells and promotes cell senescence. Senescent cells, such as fibroblasts, alveolar
  epithelial cells, and vascular endothelial cells, transform into ECM-secreting stromal
  cells through FMT, EMT, and EndMT to induce fibrosis. B Classical signaling: IL-11
  binds to IL-11Rα and gp130 on the cell membrane to activate downstream signaling
  pathways. C Trans-signaling: IL-11 binds to sIL-11Rα cleaved by ADAM10 and interacts
  with gp130 on the cell membrane to activate downstream signaling pathways. D Trans-presentation:
  After binding to IL-11Rα-expressing cells, IL-11 binds to another gp130-expressing
  cell to activate downstream signaling pathways'
