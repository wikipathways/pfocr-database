caption: (A) IL-7 stimulation triggers PI3K-Akt activation in naïve CD8+ T cells,
  which followed by FoxO1/FoxO3a phosphorylation. FoxO1/FoxO3a phosphorylation leads
  to their translocation into the cytoplasm from the nucleus, in this regard, naïve
  CD8+ T cell survival was maintained as the pro-apoptotic Bim expression was turned
  off. (B) Absence of TSC1 causes hyper-activation of mTOR which leads to suppression
  of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. IL-7 stimulation of Akt activation is compromised
  in Tsc1 KO naïve T cells and thus Akt-dependent phosphorylation of FoxO1/FoxO3a
  is decreased. The accumulation of FoxO1/FoxO3a in the nucleus drives the pro-apoptotic
  Bim expression which promotes naïve CD8+ T cell death.
