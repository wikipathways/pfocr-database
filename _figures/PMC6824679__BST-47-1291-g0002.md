caption: 'De novo synthesis of PI starts with the formation of the simple phospholipid
  PA in the ER. At this point, glycerophospholipid synthesis diverges into two branches:
  the CDP-DG pathway for the synthesis of PI and the DG pathway for the other ER lipids.
  CDP-DG is also the precursor of CL but its synthesis takes place in the mitochondria
  using a different CDP-DG synthase (TAMM41). A selective channelling of C38:4 PA
  molecules towards the CDP-DG branch might contribute to the enrichment of this species
  in PI. Once synthesized, PI molecules can be remodelled into C38:4 PI by the Lands
  cycle, which involves the release of one of their acyl chains and the re-acylation
  of the resulting LPI via acyltransferases selectively incorporating C18:0 and C20:4
  chains in sn-1 and sn-2, respectively. Abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  G-3-P, glycerol-3-phosphate; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PA, phosphatidic acid;
  DG, diacylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine;
  TG, triacylglycerol; PGP, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate; CL, cardiolipin; CDP-DG,
  CDP-diacylglycerol; PI, phosphatidylinositol; LPI, lysophosphoinositol; FFA, free
  fatty acid; CTP, cytidine triphosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate
