caption: Overview of the Notch signaling pathway. Canonical Notch signaling pathway.
  Notch receptors are synthesized as single-chain precursors, transported and glycosylated
  at the EGF-like repeat domain in the endoplasmic reticulum, and undergo S1 cleavage
  in the Golgi by furin into an extracellular and a transmembrane subunit. Then, the
  matured proteins are transported and transferred in the plasma membrane. Interaction
  between Notch receptors and their ligands creates a pulling force that allows ADAM
  proteases to remove the extracellular subunit and the γ-secretase complex to cleave
  the receptor (at the S2 and S3 cleave site, respectively), releasing the intracellular
  domain (NICD) to the cytoplasm of the signal-receiving cell. After S2 cleavage,
  the remaining part of the Notch receptor is called NEXT. NEXT is further cleaved
  at the S3 site, releasing NICD or transported into lysosomes for degradation. Concurrently,
  the extracellular segment of the Notch (NECD) and the ligand are internalized by
  the signal-sending cell. In signal-sending cells, Notch ligands are distributed
  on the cell membrane and can bind to Notch receptors on signal-receiving cells.
  However, the ligands are inactive before ubiquitylation. After ubiquitylation, ligands
  can be endocytosed, thus producing a pulling force for the binding receptors. The
  second proteolytic cleavage generates the translocation of the NICD into the nucleus.
  In the nucleus, NICD binds with a transcription factor, RBP-Jκ (also known as CSL,
  coactivator Mastermind-like (MAML) proteins), and constitutes an activated transcriptional
  complex. Then, the activated complex upregulates the expression of target genes.
  Non-canonical pathway. Non-canonical signaling pathways are able to trigger signaling
  independently by interaction of CSL. NICD can interact with the Wnt, IL-6/JAK/STAT,
  PI3K/AKT, NF-kB, PINK1/mTORC2/AKT pathways at the cytoplasmic and/or nuclear level
  to regulate the transcription of target genes. ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase);
  AKT (AKT Serine/Threonine Kinase); IL-6 (Interleukin-6); JAK (Janus Activated Kinase);
  mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1); NF-kB (Nuclear factor kappa B);
  NEXT (Notch extracellular truncation); PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase); PI3K
  (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B); Wnt (wingless-type)
