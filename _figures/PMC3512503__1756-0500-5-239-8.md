caption: 'Hypothetical Model of RASSF1C action in lung cancer cells: we hypothesize
  that RASSF1C in part activates the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway which controls a wide variety
  of genes that promote cell division and proliferation. The model proposes a mechanism
  through which RASSF1C may impact PIWIL1 expression. Since PIWIL1 is widely over-expressed
  in tumors compared to normal tissue, it may have important functions in cancer initiation,
  maintenance, or progression. PIWI-like proteins interact with PIWI-interacting RNA
  molecules (piRNAs) to form complexes that regulate transcriptional and translational
  repression leading to inhibition of apoptosis and stimulation of cell division and
  proliferation. Up-regulation of PIWIL1gene expression by RASSF1C is a novel and
  exciting discovery, suggesting a potential role for RASSF1C in early lung cancer
  development and progression.'
