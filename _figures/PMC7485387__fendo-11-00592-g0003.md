caption: FGF23 signaling in the kidney. In kidney proximal tubules, circulating FGF23
  binds to FGFR1-Klotho complexes at the basolateral membrane, and activates the MAPK
  signaling cascade involving ERK1/2. This signaling leads to the internalization
  and degradation of NPT2A/C and the decrease of urinary phosphate reabsorption promoting
  phosphate wasting. In the proximal tubule, FGF23 signaling induces downstream mechanisms
  which suppress the transcription of the vitamin D 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and increases
  the transcription of the vitamin D 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1); both events work in
  concert to limit the conversion of 25D to 1,25D as well as degrading 1,25D into
  inactive metabolites. In the kidney distal tubule, circulating FGF23 binds to the
  FGFR-Klotho receptor complex at the basolateral membrane, and activates the MAPK/pERK/EGR1
  pathway as well as cascade signaling for ERK1/2, SGK1, and the WNK4 complex via
  their phosphorylation. Activation of WNK signaling increases the expression of TRPV5
  and NCC at the apical membrane promoting the reabsorption of calcium and sodium,
  respectively.
