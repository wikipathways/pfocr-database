caption: 'Key mechanisms involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. The top half depicts
  key mutations that are required for progression along the adenoma–carcinoma axis
  in the chromosomal instability (CIN) pathway. One of the major mutational targets
  of MUTYH is the APC gene, the so-called gatekeeper to the adenoma–carcinoma axis.
  Progression along this axis is accompanied by corresponding mutations in genes such
  as KRAS and TP53. The bottom half depicts some of the key mutations in the microsatellite
  instability (MSI) pathway, MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6. The DNA mismatch repair gene MLH1
  can be inactivated either by a mutation or by promoter hypermethylation, which typically
  occurs in the context of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). BRAF mutations
  and MLH1 hypermethylation are associated with an alternative form of polyp—serrated
  polyps. Abbreviations: LOH—loss of heterozygosity; APC—Adenomatous Polyposis Coli;
  COX2—cyclooxygenase 2; MLH1—mutL homolog 1; MSH2—mutS homolog 2; MSH6—mutS homolog
  6; MYH—mutY homolog.'
