caption: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate immune escape in the tumor immune
  microenvironment (TME). The TME plays a crucial role in tumor development and metastasis.
  Importantly, it also regulates the expression of lncRNAs across various cell types,
  including fibroblasts, B cells, macrophages, T cells, and tumor cells, thus, impacting
  their phenotype and functionality. For example, lncRNA NEAT1 modulates the proliferation
  and function of Tregs through the STAT5 signaling pathway. Conversely, lncRNA PVT1
  is negatively correlated with Treg-associated cytokine levels, enhancing the immunosuppressive
  effects of MDSCs by regulating their differentiation and function, which in turn
  promotes tumor progression. Additionally, lncRNA HAGLROS is highly expressed in
  TNBC cells, promoting tumor growth and metastasis by inducing M2 polarization of
  TAMs. In contrast, lncRNA NBR2 enhances immune responses against tumors by promoting
  TAM polarization toward the M1 phenotype through the downregulation of miR-19a.
  Moreover, lncRNA GNAS-AS1 influences the functionality of CAFs by regulating miR-4319,
  which facilitates tumor cell migration and invasion. Lastly, lncRNA UCA1 inhibits
  the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells by upregulating PD-L1 expression, thereby
  facilitating immune evasion by tumor cells
