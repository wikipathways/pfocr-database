caption: 'The AHR signaling pathway controls a variety of processes in the skin that
  are deregulated in lesional psoriasis skin. AHR signaling is therefore considered
  a therapeutic target in psoriasis, and also in atopic dermatitis. Canonical signaling
  involves the binding of ligands from the tissue ligand pool (LP) to the AHR leading
  to dimerization with its main nuclear partner, ARNT leading to transcription regulation
  and control of biological processes. The concomitant induction of cytochrome p450
  enzymes (CYP450) results in a negative feedback loop as many of the polycyclic AHR
  ligands are subject to CYP450 metabolism and degradation. Unbalanced AHR signaling
  is associated with skin disease pathophysiology. For inflammatory skin diseases,
  (re)activation of AHR signaling can be achieved through various approaches:AHR ligand
  supplementation: topical therapy (e.g coal tar or tapinarof), microbiome-derived
  (e.g. using pro- or prebiotics), or via dietary supplementation.Reduction of enzyme
  activity involved in ligand degradation, as now proposed for CYP450, but also likely
  for other enzymes (like KYNU, IDO).Identification and targeting of AHR interaction
  partners involved in downstream processes.Immune modulatory drugs changing the inflammatory
  milieu to normalize enzymatic levels or aberrant expression of molecules involved
  in deregulated AHR signaling.'
