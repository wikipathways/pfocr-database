caption: Signals delivered by the engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR; Signal 1)
  and co-stimulatory molecules (CD28; Signal 2) induce different signaling pathways
  that result in the activation of multiple transcription factors. Ligation of the
  TCR by peptide–MHC complexes triggers the recruitment of signaling molecules, such
  as phospholipase C-1 (PLC), which induces the Ca2+ influx, and nuclear factor of
  activated T-cells (NFAT) and protein kinase C-θ (PKCθ) that regulate the nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP1) pathway, respectively, which control
  nuclear transcriptional and gene activation. In the nucleus, NFAT cooperates with
  AP1 and other transcription factors to induce a program of gene expression, leading
  to interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. TCR engagement in the absence of co-stimulation
  results in the induction of NFAT proteins without concomitant AP1 activation. In
  the absence of cooperative binding to AP1 (FOS and JUN), NFAT regulates the transcription
  of a distinct set of anergy-inducing genes, such as Casitas B-lineage lymphoma B
  (CBL-B). Anergy-associated factors inhibit T-cell function at different levels leading
  to T-cell unresponsiveness.
