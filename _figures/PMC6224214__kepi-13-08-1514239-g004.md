caption: 'Changes in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in HepG2 cells
  macroH2A1 knockdown (KD) compared to control (CTL) cells. A. schematic depiction
  of the PPP. Abbreviations: phosphate (P), bisphosphate (BP), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  (G3P), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), phosphoglycerate (PG), phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP), 6-phosphogluconolactone (6PGL), 6-phosphogluconate (6PG), nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide P (NAD+, NADH), D-ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P), D-ribose 5-phosphate
  (R5P), xylulose 5-phosphate (Xu5P), sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (Su7P), D-erythrose
  4-phosphate (E4P). The chart has been generated using the proprietary interactive
  web-application for metabolomics data analysis Owl Stat App (http://rstudio.owlmetabolomics.com:8031/OwlStatApp/).
  B. CTL and KD HepG2 cells were subjected to metabolic analysis by measuring the
  extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, reflecting the rate of glycolysis and the
  PPP) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR, reflecting the rate of mitochondrial respiration),
  in the presence or absence of 200 μM 6-Aminonicotinamide (6-AN, a PPP inhibitor)
  using the Seahorse XF Glycolysis Stress Test Kit. * P < 0.05; n = 3.'
