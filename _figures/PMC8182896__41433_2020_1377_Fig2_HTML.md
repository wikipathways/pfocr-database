caption: The Ang/Tie pathway regulates vascular stability under physiological and
  pathological conditions. The receptor components of the Ang/Tie pathway, Tie1 and
  Tie2, are expressed primarily in the endothelium. In a healthy vessel (left), Ang-1/Tie2
  signalling at cell–cell junctions leads to downstream activation of the PI3K/AKT
  pathway and induction of eNOS and survivin, leading to EC survival. Tie2-mediated
  phosphorylation of FOXO1 prevents its nuclear translocation, inhibiting transcription
  of its target genes, including Ang-2, while inhibition of NFκB cells suppresses
  the expression of inflammatory genes such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin. Ang-1/Tie2
  signalling via GTPase pathways (Rac1/Rap1 or Iqgap1/Rap1) results in cortical actin
  cytoskeleton stabilisation. In migrating ECs, Tie2 is localised at the cell–extracellular
  matrix contacts and preferentially activates ERK signalling. Recruitment of adaptor
  proteins such as DOKR and GRB2 to the Tie2 receptor supports PI3K-mediated EC migration.
  Overall, Ang-1/Tie2 signalling and its downstream effects promote EC integrity,
  contributing to vascular stability. In a diseased vessel (right), Ang-2/Tie2 signalling
  leads to pericyte detachment, which sensitises the retinal vasculature to VEGF and
  other proinflammatory factors via activation of FOXO1 target genes, downregulation
  of Tie1 and consequent suppression of Tie2. Cells are not represented to scale.
