caption: 'Microarray analysis of Wnt signaling component gene in kidney of WT and
  KLTG. Diagram of mammalian Wnt signaling pathway superimposed on oligonucleotide-based
  chip data at 14 days after UUO. Downregulated genes are displayed in green and upregulated
  genes are displayed in red. A: illustration of Wnt signaling pathway. B: gene expression
  of KLTG sham compared with WT sham. C: gene expression of WT UUO compared with WT
  sham. D: gene expression of KLTG UUO compared with KLTG sham. Six samples in each
  group were mixed and used for microarray analysis.'
