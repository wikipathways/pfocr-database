caption: The mechanism of 16α-OHE promoting pulmonary hypertension. In PASMCs, 16α-OHE1
  binds with ERα to inhibit Nrf2, resulting in upregulation of Nox1 and Nox4, decreased
  antioxidants increased ROS production, and irreversible PTP oxidation. Activation
  of the p38MARK pathway leads to increased phosphorylation of CRE region and ATF-2,
  upregulation of cyclinD1, and promotion of cell oxidative damage and proliferation.
  Upregulation of miRNA-29 inhibits expression of PPARγ, further reducing CD36 and
  Glut4 and upregulating PFKP, resulting in insulin resistance and increased aerobic
  glycolysis of 16α-OHE1, which may promote cell, migration, and antiapoptosis by
  reducing BMPR2 levels and inhibiting the BMPR2-Smad1/5/8-ID1, BMPR2-AkT-Wnt/β-Catenin,
  and BMPR2-PPARγ-apoe signaling pathways through lysosomal activation. In PAECs,
  16α-OHE1 binds with Erα to inhibit X17, upregulate HIF-2α, and increases cyclin
  D2 and E2F1, promoting cell proliferation. Additionally, 16α-OHE1 inhibits PPARγ
  and attenuates mitochondrial bioenergy and insulin resistance, leading to metabolic
  abnormalities. Inhibition of PPARγ and BMPR2 promotes EndoMT through inhibition
  of p-Smad1/5/8-Smad4 signaling and enhancement of TGF-β-Smad2/3-Smad4 signaling.
