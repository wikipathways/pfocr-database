caption: 'Intracellular activation of innate immune signaling by hyaluronan matrix.
  Activation of innate immune receptors TLR2, 4 and 5 leads to the activation of the
  MyD88 pathway, resulting in NFκB activation and inflammatory cytokine release (e.g.
  IL-6, TNFα). Activation of kinases (examples shown: ERK, RhoA, Rho kinase, myosin
  light chain) lead to additional pro-inflammatory responses, cell migration and contraction.
  Signaling by intracellular hyaluronan signaling by intracellular receptors or the
  inflammasome is also possible but less well understood and not shown here.'
