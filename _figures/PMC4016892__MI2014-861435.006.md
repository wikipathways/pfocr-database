caption: Schematic model illustrating the signaling pathway by which ANG suppresses
  the inflammatory response involving TBK1-mediated NF-κB nuclear translocation in
  HCFs inflamed by TNF-α. ANG reduces the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines
  (IL-1β, -6, and -8) and enhances the mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines
  (IL-4 and -10). ANG also inhibits NF-κB nuclear translocation through a reduction
  in TNFR1 and 2 mRNA expression and TBK1 production. The cascade underlying the effect
  of ANG results in a decrease in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as MCP-1
  and IL-6 and -8.
