caption: Establishment of 3HP production in A. pseudoterreus. (A) Ideal carbon flux
  in a high theoretical yield (2 mol/mol) metabolic pathway for production of 3HP
  from sugar monomers. (B) The beta-alanine metabolic pathway to enable 3HP production
  was codon optimized for A. pseudoterreus and placed under the control of high expression
  promoters. The engineered pathway was targeted to the cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase
  (cad1) locus to disrupt the gene. 3HP, 3-hydroxypropionate; AAT, aspartate aminotransferase,
  Ala, alanine; ALT, alanine transaminase; αKg, alpha-ketoglutarate; Asp, Aspartate;
  βAla, beta-alanine; BcBAPAT, beta-alanine pyruvate aminotransferase; EcHPDH, 3-hydroxypropionate
  dehydrogenase; Glc, glucose; Glu, glutamate; Msa, malonate semialdehyde; Oaa, oxaloacetate;
  PYC, pyruvate carboxylase; Pyr, pyruvate; TcPAND, aspartate 1-decarboxylase.
