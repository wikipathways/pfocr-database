caption: 'Schematic model of the dengue virus (DENV) life cycle. DENV particles bind
  to host cell factors and then enter the cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. After
  trafficking to endosomal compartments, envelope protein-mediated fusion of viral
  and cellular membranes occurs with changes in pH, allowing disassembly of the virus
  particles and release of single-stranded viral RNA into the cytoplasm, where translation
  occurs. The viral RNA is then translated to a polyprotein, which is processed by
  host cellular and viral proteases. Nonstructural (NS) proteins then replicate the
  viral RNA. Viral particle assembly occurs on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), and particles then bud into the ER as immature virus particles. During egress
  of the progeny virus particle through the secretory pathway, pre-membrane (prM)
  protein is cleaved by the cellular serine protease furin. Mature virus particles
  are released into the extracellular space. The red inset indicates the putative
  membrane topology of the viral proteins. TGN: trans-Golgi network.'
