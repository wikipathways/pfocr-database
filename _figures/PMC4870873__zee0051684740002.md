  The “+” dots represent the identified metabolites that were increased, the “−” dots
  represent the identified metabolites that were decreased, and the white dots represent
  the metabolites predicted to be involved in the corresponding biochemical pathway.
  The gray boxes are the enzymes catalyzing the reactions linking substrates and products.
  Metabolites: M1, (S)-2-[5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido]succinate;
  M2, 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide. Enzymes: (1), phospho-ribosyl-amino-imidazole-succino-carboxamide
  synthase; (2), phospho-ribosyl-amino-imidazole-succino-carboxamide formyltransferase.'
