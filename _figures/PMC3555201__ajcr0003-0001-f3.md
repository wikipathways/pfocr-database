caption: HMGB1 in the tumor microenvironment and hypothesis of HMGB1 functioning via
  NF-kB and epigenetic pathways. A. The release of HMGB1 in the tumor microenvironment.
  HMGB1 has yin-yang effects on cancer. Acute release of HMGB1 after cancer therapies
  promotes maturation of DCs through interaction with TLR4 and clonal expansion of
  tumor antigen-specific T cells and thus elicits antitumor responses. In contrast,
  persistent hypoxia in growing tumors leads to necrosis, causing chronic release
  of HMGB1, which promotes angiogenesis and tumor growth through the recruitment of
  macrophages (TAM) and endothelial precursor cells (EPC) and activation of local
  endothelial cells through RAGE signaling. The acutely and chronically released HMGB1
  molecules are represented in red and black, indicating that they may be differently
  modified by redox or other mechanisms. This figure is modified from a figure by
  Srikrishna and Freeze []. B. The hypothesis of HMGB1 acting via NF-kB and epigenetic
  pathways to exert its long lasting effects on surviving tumor cells, immune cells
  and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. The NF-kB pathway is regulated
  partly via epigenetic pathways (EP) both upstream and downstream. STAT3 and NF-kB,
  both inflammation-regulated genes, regulate genes to promote cancer cell proliferation,
  survival, caner angiogenesis and metastasis. As an example to illustrate the point
  of role of epigenetic mechanisms, we showed that IL-6, produced and released from
  macrophage stimulated by HMGB1 and modulated via epigenetic mechanisms, regulates
  transcription of DNMT1, one of the key enzymes for DNA methylation in cancer cells.
  The TNF-stimulated and phosphorylated p65 binds and recruits DNMT1 to the promoter
  of BRMS1 gene, thus inhibits the production of BRMS1, an inhibitor of tumor metastasis.
