caption: Glycolytic breakdown of glucose in T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is
  reduced as a result of diminished activity of the regulatory enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphophastase
  3 (PFKFB3), which curbs ATP production. With increased activity of glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (G6PD), glucose is shunted to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
  yielding high amounts of the electron donor NADPH and generation of biosynthetic
  precursors. Cellular stores of glutathione are shifted towards the reduced form,
  cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are depleted and cellular oxidant
  signalling is impaired. ETC, electron transport chain; GLUT1, glucose transporter
  type 1; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
