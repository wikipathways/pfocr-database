caption: A double-strand break (DSB) introduced by Spo11 is resected to expose 3′
  ssDNA tails. Mediated by Rad51 and Dmc1, one of the 3′ ssDNA tails first invades
  the homologous chromosome to form a displacement loop (D-loop) and heteroduplex
  DNA (highlighted), and then initiates DNA synthesis. In the canonical pathway, capture
  of the second end, DNA synthesis and ligation generate Holliday junctions flanking
  the DSB site. The Holliday junctions can be resolved by cutting the outside strands
  (filled arrowheads) or crossed strands (open arrowheads) of each junction (two of
  the four possible resolution configurations are shown here). In principle, resolution
  can lead to either a crossover or a noncrossover configuration of the DNA flanking
  the recombination site. In vivo, however, most resolution products are crossovers.
  An alternative recombination pathway depicted on the right (known as synthesis-dependent
  strand annealing (SDSA)) leads primarily to noncrossovers. In both types of pathway,
  gene conversion can occur by mismatch repair if DNA sequence polymorphisms are incorporated
  into the heteroduplex DNA that forms as part of the recombination process.
