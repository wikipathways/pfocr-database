caption: 'After PNI, several cellular changes are observed in the spinal cord, the
  injury site, and target organs.Following PNI, at the site of the injured nerve,
  M1 macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines in the short term, and long-term axonal
  deprivation leads to Schwann cell atrophy and upregulation of inhibitory molecules
  that hinder axon regeneration. In the spinal cord, there is an increase in oxidative
  stress response and gene expression levels inducing neuronal apoptosis, resulting
  in apoptosis of anterior horn motor neurons. At the target muscle, reactive oxygen
  species trigger inflammation-related genes, and inflammatory proteins cause sustained
  damage to skeletal muscle, further activating the proteasome signaling pathway,
  leading to increased protein degradation and muscle atrophy. Created using Adobe
  Illustrator 2022 version 26.0.0. CSF1: Colony stimulating factor 1; DRG: dorsal
  root ganglion; EARLY: in the early stages after PNI; LATE: in the late stages after
  PNI; PNI: peripheral nerve injury; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SCs: Schwann cells'
