caption: The effects of BPs on bone remodeling. (1) The increased secretion of IL-6
  from BPs-treated osteocyte enhances the expression of RANKL, thereby, promoting
  the osteoclast differentiation. (2) However, BPs inhibit osteoclast differentiation
  by suppressing the RANKL/OPG/RANK signaling pathway. (3) BPs have an inhibitory
  effect on the osteoclast differentiation by suppressing the osteoclastogenic cytokines
  (IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, and IFN-γ) and increasing anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines (IL-4,
  IL-10, and TGF-β). (4) Osteogenic differentiation is inhibited by the reduced release
  of PDGF-BB from preosteoclasts. (5) Moreover, BPs affect osteoblastogenesis by altering
  the release of the pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNFα, IL-1β, DKK-1, sclerostin,
  and TGF-β1.
