caption: In NF2/Merlin-mutant tumors, dysregulated CRL4DCAF1 and mTORC1 are two predominant
  oncogenic signaling nodes sustaining tumor growth. MLN4924 inhibits YAP activity
  in multiple Merlin-mutant tumors and transcription of canonical pro-proliferative
  and anti-apoptotic YAP targets in mesothelioma. GDC-0980 inhibits mTOR and PI3K,
  thereby inhibiting downstream mechanisms supporting tumor growth and maintenance
  including proliferation, survival, protein synthesis, and cell growth. Tumor-promoting
  mechanisms are indicated in red, tumor-suppressive mechanisms in blue.
