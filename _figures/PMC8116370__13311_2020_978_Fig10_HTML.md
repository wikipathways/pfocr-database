caption: Role of distupted O-GlcNAcylation homeostasis in DS neuropathology. The hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP) is a minor branch of the glycolitic pathway that results
  in the production of UDP-GlcNAc, the activated substrate for protein O-GlcNAcylation.
  As the HBP flux integrates molecules from carbohydrate (fructose-6-phosphate), amino
  acid (glutamine/glucosamine), neucleotide (UTP), and lipid (Acetyl-CoA) metabolism,
  the production of UDP-GlcNAc is considered a valuable intracellular sensor of cell
  metabolic status. An early upregulation of the insulin cascade (IR-IRS) is present
  in our DS murine model, which could reasonably imply an increase in glucose availability.
  In line with that, the HBP rate-limiting enzyme GFAT1 lack the inhibitory action
  of the metabolic-sensor kinase AMPK. Therefore, the altered OGT functionality and,
  mostly, aberrant increase of OGA-driven hydrolysis of O-GlcNAc seem to be the main
  cause for reduced protein O-GlcNAcylation in our DS model. The loss of protein O-GlcNAcylation
  is kown to give rise to an aberrant increase of protein phosphorylation, because
  of the mutual inverse relationship between these two modifications. This process
  aquires particular relevance when it comes to the post-transaltional modifications
  of proteins implicated in the DS neurodegenerative process. Indeed, the unbalanced
  O-GlcNAcylation/phosphorylation ratio of tau is known to promote its aggregated
  forms (NTFs, neurofibrillary tangles) while the aberrant increase of phosphorylated
  APP favors its amyloidogenic cleavage that results in the formation of β-CTF and
  thus, to β-amyloid accumulation. In this scenario, data collected on our model confirm
  the relevance of O-GlcNAcylation disruption in the appearance of AD-related hallmarks.
  Furthermore, TMG-mediated inhibition of OGA proved to restore protein O-GlcNAcylation
  and further exert its neuroprotective effects by boosting autophagic clearance of
  toxic aggregates and inducing the expression of proteins related to synaptic transmission
