caption: Simplified diagram of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt
  proteins bind to receptors thought to be composed of a Frizzled protein and either
  of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins LRP5 or LRP6. Signaling
  via Dishevelled and/or Axin then results in inactivation of a multiprotein complex
  that normally renders β-catenin unstable. This complex (shown by a dotted rectangle)
  includes Axin, APC, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). By inhibiting this
  complex, Wnt signals lead to accumulation of β-catenin in the cytosol and its entry
  into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, β-catenin binds to proteins of the T-cell
  factor (Tcf)/lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (Lef1) family and modulates the expression
  of several target genes. * Components of the pathway identified as oncogenes in
  naturally occurring mouse or human cancers, ** components identified as tumor suppressors.
