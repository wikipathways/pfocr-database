caption: The molecular mechanism of attenuation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
  by gingipains. Gingipains (RgpA, RgpB, and Kgp) cleave the membrane proteins associated
  with PI3K p85α, which is the regulatory subunit of PI3K, resulting in inactivation
  of PI3K and inhibition of PDK1 translocation to the plasma membrane. Hence, Thr-308
  of Akt is not phosphorylated by PDK1, which is required for Akt activation. Consequently
  the phosphorylation levels and activation status of the Akt downstream proteins
  including GSK3α/β, mTOR, and Bad are impacted. PIP3, PI(3,4,5)P3.
