caption: 'Different metabolic strategies used by neurons and astrocytes. In astrocytes,
  glucose is imported through glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and preferentially stored
  as glycogen, or metabolized via glycolysis. The generated pyruvate is converted
  to lactate thanks to the expression of lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5). Glucose enters
  neurons via GLUT3, and once inside the cell is phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK),
  resulting in glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) subsequently directed to the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) and the glycolytic pathway. The final product of glycolysis is pyruvate,
  which after entering the mitochondria will be subjected to the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle, and subsequently to oxidative phosphorylation consisting of the electron
  transport chain (ETC). This process consumes O2 and leads to the production of ATP
  and CO2. G6P undergoing PPP is transformed into 6-phosphogluconate (6PG), and is
  thereafter converted to ribulose-5-phosphate (R5P). In this process, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is produced, an essential molecule to regenerate
  oxidized antioxidants. The weak glycolytic activity of neurons may reduce pyruvate
  formation and, therefore, obtain limited energy production in mitochondria from
  glucose metabolism. However, this may be compensated by the uptake of lactate from
  astrocytes, given that glutamate stimulates lactate release from astrocytes (astrocyte–neuron
  lactate shuttle; ANLS). Abbreviations are as follows: 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; 6PG,
  6-phosphogluconate; ETC, electron transport chain; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; F1,6P,
  fructose-1,6-diphosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;
  MCT, monocarboxylic acid transporter; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; R5P, ribulose-5-phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.'
