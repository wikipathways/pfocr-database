caption: TLR and RLR signaling pathways present in airway epithelial cells in response
  to viral infections. Viral structural proteins can be detected by TLR2 and TLR4
  expressed on the cell surface. Within the endosomes are nucleic acid sensors such
  as TLR3, 7, 8, and 9. TLR signaling and PAMP recognition can be mediated through
  MyD88, resulting in AP-1 and NF-κB activation and their translocation into the nucleus
  to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. The activation of TLRs can
  also lead to signaling through TRIF, resulting in the activation of IRFs, which
  are important in the induction of type I interferon responses. Cytosolic nucleic
  acid can also be sensed through RLRs such as RIG-I and MDA5, which signal through
  converging pathways with TLR. Figure adapted from “TLR signaling pathway” and created
  in BioRender.com
