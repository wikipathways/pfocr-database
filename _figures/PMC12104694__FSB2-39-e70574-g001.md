caption: 'Indole‐3‐acetic acid (IAA)‐mediated signaling pathways in epithelial and
  endothelial cells. In endothelial cells: IAA acting as a USP40 activator stabilizes
  the endothelial barrier integrity and reduces inflammation by enhancing HSP90β deubiquitination,
  consequently inhibiting NF‐kB activity. Elevated IAA levels in patients with chronic
  kidney disease (CKD) induce endothelial oxidative stress and inflammation by increasing
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of COX‐2 and tissue factor via activating
  the AhR/p38MAPK/NF‐kB pathway, which contributes to the high cardiovascular risk
  of patients with CKD. In epithelial cells: IAA may act as a TLR4 ligand ameliorates
  colitis by activation of ERK signaling and inhibits cell proliferation through TLR4‐JNK
  activation. The crosstalk between IAA‐AhR and Wnt/β‐catenin promotes intestinal
  stem cells (ISCs) homeostasis. IAA activates AhR can improve gut motility and enhance
  intestinal mucin sulfation through the AhR‐3′‐phosphoadenosine 5′‐phosphosulfate
  synthase 2 (Papss2)‐solute carrier family 35 member B3 (Slc35b3) pathway, contributing
  to the protection of intestinal homeostasis. IAA modulates lipid metabolism via
  the AhR/SREBP‐1C pathway in liver. Indole‐3‐acetonitrile (IAN), the indole‐3‐acetamide
  (IAM), the tryptophan side‐chain oxidase (TSO), the tryptamine (TPM), and the indole‐3‐pyruvic
  acid (IPA/IPyA), indole 3 aldehyde (IAld), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), Ubiquitin
  carboxyl terminal hydrolase 40 (USP40), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), sterol regulatory element binding protein‐1c
  (SREBP‐1c), T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer binding factor (LEF), Ephrin type
