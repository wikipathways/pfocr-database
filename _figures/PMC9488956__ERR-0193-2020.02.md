caption: 'Relationships of protein complexes involved in Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome
  (HPS), biogenesis of intracellular organelles and clinical manifestations of disease.
  Four stages (I–IV) of melanosome maturation and platelet δ-granule (dense granule),
  lamellar body and lysosome formation via the endosomal pathway from the TGN are
  shown. Defects in these vesicles are associated with oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding
  diathesis, pulmonary fibrosis and excessive cellular deposits in HPS. Protein complexes
  associated with HPS, including AP-3, BLOC-1, BLOC-2 and BLOC-3, and a Rab32/38 guanine
  nucleotide exchange factor comprised of HPS1 and HPS4 protein subunits, are involved
  in the formation of melanosomes, platelet δ-granules, lamellar bodies and lysosomes.
  TGN: trans-Golgi network; AP: adaptor protein; BLOC: biogenesis of lysosome-related
  organelles complex.'
