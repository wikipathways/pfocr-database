caption: The local hydrogel releases a cocktail combination of anti-inflammatory drugs
  and LAs on the wounds of diabetic mice. The structure and sustained release of the
  hydrogel are enhanced by the surface properties of the drug nanoparticles during
  crosslinking. Within the cell, the combination of drug molecules modulates the signaling
  pathway to inhibit the secretion of PGE2, thereby achieving anti-inflammatory efficacy
