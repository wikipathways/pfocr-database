caption: Representative schema of epithelium-mesenchyme interactions during lung budding.
  Many factors are secreted and exchanged between the lung epithelium (blue arrows)
  and mesenchyme (red arrows). For instance, fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) is
  locally expressed by distal submesothelial mesenchymal cells and interacts with
  its receptor expressed in the distal epithelium. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is expressed
  by epithelial cells, and downregulates FGF10 expression through its receptor Patched
  1, but also activates FGF10 through the Wnt pathway.
