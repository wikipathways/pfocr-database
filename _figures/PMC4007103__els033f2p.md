caption: 'Biogenesis of Drosophila small regulatory RNAs. miRNA: primary microRNAs
  (pri-miRNA) are transcribed from the genome and processed by DROSHA/PASHA into precursor
  hairpins (pre-miRNA). Some miRNAs (mirtrons) are spliced from introns by the spliceosome
  machinery bypassing the action of DROSHA/PASHA. pre-miRNAs are processed in the
  cytoplasm by DCR-1/LOQS producing double-stranded miRNAs (ds-miRNA), from which
  one of the arms in sorted and loaded into AGO1 or AGO2 inducing either translational
  repression or RNA interference, respectively. endo-siRNA: long endogenous double-stranded
  RNAs (endo-dsRNA) are encoded in transposon-rich genomic locations, and they are
  processed by DCR-2/R2D2 into double stranded siRNA. Exogenous dsRNAs follow the
  same path as endo-siRNAs. Other siRNAs are produced from the processing of genome
  encoded long hairpins (hpRNA) by DCR-2/LOQS. siRNAs trigger the RNA interference
  response in association with AGO2. Somatic piRNA: Long piRNA clusters are transcribed
  into precursors (pre-piRNA), which are cleaved by PIWI generating small piRNAs.
  PIWI/piRNA complexes mediate the silencing of RNA transposons in the nucleus. Germline
  piRNA: AGO3/AUB mediate the cleavage of genomic encoded piRNAs and RNA transposons
  in the cytoplasm in a feed-back loop called the ping-pong mechanism. PIWI is required
  in this pathway, but its role has not been clarified so far.'
