caption: Oncogenic mechanisms of HBsAg mutants in hepatocarcinogenesis. Mutated envelope
  proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum and regulate cytoplasmic signaling
  pathways through ER stress-dependent and ER stress-independent signals, thereby
  causing proliferation, cell cycle progression, genome instability, and inducing
  the occurrence of HCC. In addition, when deletion mutations occur in the preS1 region,
  including deletion of the S promoter. It will affect the reduction of downstream
  2.1 kb preS2/S RNA production and the relative increase in the 2.4 kb preS1 RNA
  production, resulting in an increase of HBx and HBeAg as well as an imbalance in
  the production of three surface proteins, thereby promoting the occurrence of HCC.
