caption: a SP may stimulate aldosterone secretion through both an indirect vascular
  effect leading to an increase in adrenal blood flow and a direct action on adrenocortical
  cells, the two mechanisms being mediated by the NK1 receptor (NK1R). The action
  of SP seems to be complementary to that of Ang II which is involved in the aldosterone
  response to upright posture while SP may mainly control basal aldosterone production.
  b At the cellular level, binding of SP to the NK1R expressed by zona glomerulosa
  cells induces an activation of the ERK pathway but has a minor effect on the calcium
  signalling pathway in contrast to angiotensin II (Ang II) which strongly activates
  the two transduction mechanisms. Schemas created using medical diagrams available
