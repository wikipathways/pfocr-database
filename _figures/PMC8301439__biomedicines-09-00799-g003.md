caption: Therapeutic approaches for IDH-mutant gliomas. IDH1/2 mutations induce 2-HG
  accumulation and NADPH depletion, which lead to global metabolic and epigenetic
  changes in tumor cells. The first-line therapeutic strategy is using mutant IDH1/2
  inhibitors to reverse an IDH mutation-induced phenotype. On the other hand, 2-HG
  is shown to inhibit many 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases such as KDMs, TETs, BCATs,
  COX, and C-4PH enzymes. NADPH depletion inhibits de novo lipogenesis and causes
  oxidative stress. Inhibition of KDMs and TETs leads to histone and DNA hypermethylation,
  which makes targeting epigenetic enzymes a therapeutic option. Upon inhibition of
  BCATs, cells become dependent on GLS for glutamate production, which is highly important
  for tumor cell growth. Therefore, GLS inhibition is another therapeutic option.
  Inhibition of COX, which has an important role in electron transport chain and induction
  of oxidative stress, renders IDH-mutant cells sensitive to mitochondrial stress
  inducers. On the other hand, 2-HG-induced hypermethylation phenotype results in
  the repression of the NAPRT1 gene, which is responsible for NAD+ biosynthesis. Therefore,
  inhibition of NAMPT responsible for the salvage NAD+ synthesis pathway is another
  therapeutic option. Depletion of the NAD+ level, 2-HG-dependent inhibition of KDM4A/B,
  and hypermethylation of the MGMT promoter also inhibit DNA damage response, rendering
  IDH-mutant cells sensitive to DNA damage inducers like TMZ, irradiation, or PARP
  inhibitors. Finally, as the specific IDH1R132H mutation creates an immunogenic epitope,
  immunotherapeutic approaches including peptide vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors
  and CAR-T cell therapy emerge as other therapeutic strategies. Dark blue, green,
  purple, and light blue boxes and lines indicate therapeutic approaches targeting
  metabolic, epigenetic, DNA damage, and immunogenic pathways, respectively. Yellow
  arrows indicate mutant IDH inhibition directly. Black lines with an arrowhead indicate
  activated cellular pathways and blunt-end arrows indicate inhibition. 2-HG, 2-hydroxyglutarate;
  BCAT, branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) aminotransferase; C-4PH, collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase;
  COX, cytochrome C oxidase; GLS, glutaminase; KDM, lysine demethylase; MGMT, O6-methylguanine
  DNA methyltransferase; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADPH, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced); NAMPT, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase;
  NAPRT1, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase; TET, ten–eleven translocation enzymes;
