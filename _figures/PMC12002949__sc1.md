caption: 'In this study, a bioactive and biomimetic periosteum (i.e., PEC-Apt-NP-Exo)
  was constructed by combining the electrospun membrane with engineered Exos: (1)
  the biomimetic electrospun membrane comprised PCL core-ECM shell fibers created
  via coaxial electrospinning; (2) the bioactive engineered Exos derived from M2 macrophage
  were modified with BMSC-specific aptamers; and (3) the engineered Exos were covalently
  bonded to the electrospun membrane. In vitro and in vivo results revealed that PEC-Apt-NP-Exo
  promoted immune regulation, osteogenesis, and angiogenesis through the Rap1/PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway, demonstrating significant efficacy in repairing large bone defects'
