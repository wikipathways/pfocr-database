caption: It is not clear whether BER and TOP1-mediated SSBs actually require a sensing
  step; however, direct breaks are detected by polyADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1).
  Various activities collaborate to generate 3′ OH and 5′P ends that are compatible
  for ligation. For instance, 3′ phosphoglycolate, and 3′ phosphate and 5′ OH intermediates
  generated from ROS-mediated sugar disintegration, and products of abortive TOP1
  reactions are variously processed by APE1 PNKP, and TDP1, respectively. Occasionally,
  failure of ligation can result in the formation of a 5′AMP-associated SSB, which
  is processed by APTX. Like in BER, any gap-filling synthesis is mediated by polβ
  and nicks are sealed by either XRCC1/LIG3 or FEN1/LIG1.
