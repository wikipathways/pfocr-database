caption: 'The mechanism of Nrf2 activation and Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses
  in the lungs. Under unstressed conditions, Keap1 protein traps Nrf2 in the cytoplasm
  and targets this protein for the Cul3-Rbx1 ubiquitination system, which promotes
  the proteolysis of Nrf2 by the 26S proteasome. Diverse oxidative insults or pharmacological
  Nrf2 activators impair the ability of Keap1 to target Nrf2 for ubiquitination and
  degradation, promote newly synthesized Nrf2 to translocate to nucleus, and induce
  ARE-driven cytoprotective gene expression. Several accepted mechanisms include the
  modification of cysteine in Keap1: (a) Keap1 dissociation, (b) Keap1 hinge and latch,
  and (c) Keap1 ubiquitination. (2) There are also Keap1-independent pathways, among
  which protein kinases including PI3K, MAPKs, PKC, and GSK-3 play an essential role
  in phosphorylation of Nrf2 to increase its stability and transactivation activity.
  (3) Moreover, a noncanonical pathway induces Nrf2 activation by autophagy, which
  declares that p62 competes with Nrf2 for Keap1 binding, sequesters Keap1 into the
  autophagosome, and promotes its degradation. After de novo synthesized Nrf2 translocates
  to the nucleus, it heterodimerizes with small Maf then binds to ARE in the regulatory
  regions of Nrf2 target genes to induce their expression, which confer protective
  effects to various pulmonary diseases including BPD, respiratory infection, ARDS,
  COPD, asthma, IPF, and lung cancer.'
