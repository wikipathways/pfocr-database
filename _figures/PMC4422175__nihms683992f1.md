caption: 'Bile acid biosynthetic pathways. Two major bile acid biosynthetic pathways
  are shown. The neutral (or classic) pathway is initiated by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
  (CYP7A1) located in the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver, whereas the acidic (or
  alternative) pathway is initiated by mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1).
  There are three sterol hydroxylases that convert cholesterol to oxysterols: CYP27A1
  in macrophages and other tissues, microsomal sterol 25-hydroxylase in liver microsomes,
  and sterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) in the brain. Oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1)
  is nonspecific and catalyzes hydroxylation of 27- and 25-hydroxycholesterol to 3β,
  7α-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid and 5-cholesten-3β, 7α, 25-triol, respectively.
  A brain-specific oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP39A1) catalyzes hydroxylation of 24-hydroxycholesterol
  to 5-cholesten-3β, 7α, 24(S)-triol. These oxysterols could be converted to CDCA
  if transported to the liver. In the liver, 3β-hydoxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD,
  HSD3B7) convert 7α-hydroxycholesterol to 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), which
  is converted to 7α, 12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one by a sterol 12α-hydroxylase
  (CYP8B1), leading to synthesis of cholic acid (CA). Without 12α-hydroxylation, the
  pathway produces CDCA. Aldos-keto reductase 1D1 (AKR1D1) and AKR1C1 catalyze isomerization
  and saturation of the steroid ring. Then CYP27A1 catalyzes steroid side-chain oxidation
  to form cholestanoic acids, THCA, and DHCA. Bile acid-Co-A synthase (BACS) or very
  long-chain Co-A synthase (VLCS) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ligates Co-A to
  the carboxyl groups. Bile acid thioesters are transported into peroxisomes, where
  an α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) converts the methyl group from 25(R) to 25(S)
  conformation, and three peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes, branched-chain acyl-CoA
  oxidase, D-bifunctional enzyme, and thiolase (or sterol carrier protein x) catalyze
  oxidative cleavage of a propionyl group from the steroid side-chain to form cholyl-CoA
  and chenodeoxycholyl-CoA. Cytosolic or peroxisomal bile acid: amino-acid transferase
  (BAAT) catalyzes conjugation of amino acids, glycine or taurine to the carboxyl
  group of cholyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholyl-CoA to form tauro- or glycol-conjugated
  CA or CDCA. ER: endoplasmic reticulum.'
