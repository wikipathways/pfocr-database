caption: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway targeting PPARγ in the adipogenesis process.
  (A) A simplified version of the Wnt pathway. Interactions of Wnt with a Wnt receptor
  and a co-receptor LRP6 induce intracellular signaling through β-catenin. β-catenin
  enters the nucleus to interact with TCF/LEF to form a transcriptional complex that
  suppresses expression of the PPARγ and CEPBα, blocking adipogenesis. MiR-30e-5p
  targets the LRP6 transcript and suppresses LRP6 translation (thick red arrow), freeing
  β-catenin to enter the nucleus to associate with TCF/LEF to unblock the suppressed
  expression of PPARγ and CEPBα, hence, promoting adipogenesis (upward-pointing thick
  green arrows; the symbols are also used in other figures). (B) The LRP6 mRNA and
  miR-30e-5p are highly conserved in different species, including chicken. The seed
  sequences of the miRNA-mRNA interactions are boxed. (C) Identification of the putative
  gga-miR-30e-5p seed sequences in the 3’-UTR of the chicken LRP6 transcript by bioinformatics
  analysis.
