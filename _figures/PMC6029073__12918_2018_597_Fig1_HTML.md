caption: Schematic diagram of the Sho1-dependant branch of the yeast high osmolarity
  glycerol (HOG) pathway as a model system for analysis of short linear motif function
  in signal transduction. Upon exposure to high osmolarity, the SH3 domain of the
  membrane-bound osmosensor Sho1 binds to PXXP motif in the MAPK kinase (MAPKK) Pbs2,
  initiating a phosphorylation cascade (grey arrows) that culminates in phosphorylation
  of the MAPK Hog1. Activated Hog1-P then accumulates inside the nucleus and initiates
  a complex transcriptional response in order to re-establish homeostasis within the
  cell. A Hog1-responsive promoter driving yeGFP reporter expression was used to quantify
  pathway activity for a series of deletions in predicted short linear motifs in pathway
  components – deleted residues shown in ovals for each module
