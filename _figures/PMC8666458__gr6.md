caption: Potential of CCAT1 as diagnostic, prognostic biomarker, and therapeutic target
  in Breast Cancer.CCAT1 is highly expressed in BC. CCAT1 acts as a potential prognostic,
  diagnostic biomarker, and therapeutic target for BC. CCAT1 can regulate miR-148b
  and modify the radiosensitivity of BC. Additionally, it was revealed that CCAT1
  can promote proliferation, migration, and invasion through targeting miR-218/ZFX
  axis in TNBC and activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in BC cells.
