  using a maximum of 4 steps and either the default scoring weights, or default weights
  but with the weight for number of steps with literature precedent set to zero, are
  shown. Pathways are marked as identified even where RetroBioCat suggests additional
  steps. * indicates pathways where the data from the relevant paper has not been
  added to the database of literature precedent reactions in RetroBioCat. TDL: thiamine-dependent
  lyase, ADH: alcohol dehydrogenase, PAL: phenylalanine ammonia lyase, CAR: carboxylic
