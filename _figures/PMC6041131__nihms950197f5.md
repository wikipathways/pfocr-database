caption: SCFAs bind to and activate FFAR2, which inhibits its downstream cAMP–PKA–CREB–HDAC
  pathway. SCFAs also can be transported across cell membrane to inhibit HDAC activities.
  Loss of FFAR2 results in enhanced cAMP–PKA–CREB pathway and overexpressed HDAC.
  The expression levels of inflammation suppressors, such as sfrp1, dkk3, and socs1,
  were decreased, which promote the progression of colon carcinogenesis. However,
  absorption-mediated HDAC inhibition by SCFAs could still occur in FFAR2-deficient
  cells.
