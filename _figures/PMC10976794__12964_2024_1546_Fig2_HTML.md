caption: 'A schematic overview of the Hippo signaling pathway. A The laminopathic
  cell experiences stress, and activate the canonical Hippo pathway, resulting in
  the YAP1-TEAD complex to drive the transcription of proliferative genes. During
  homeostasis, residue-phosphorylation generates a 14–3-3-protein binding site, causing
  cytoplasmic sequestration and marking them for proteasomal degradation, ultimately
  inhibiting YAP and WWTR1 (previously known as TAZ) activity and partial degradation
  of YAP1. Note that the 14–3-3 protein family is encoded by six genes (YWHAB, YWHAE,
  YWHAG, YWHAH, YWHAQ, YWHAZ, and SFN) B Single-cell RNA expression profiles of genes
  encoding crucial proteins of the Hippo pathway in selected myocardial cell types
  (source: Multi-Gene Single Cell Viewer from GTEx). While the displayed genes are
  considered to be involved in the Hippo pathway and laminopathy, only some of them
  show sufficient RNA expression in cardiac cells (e.g., see the difference between
  paralogues MST1 and STK3) and might have different involvement in cardiolaminopathy'
