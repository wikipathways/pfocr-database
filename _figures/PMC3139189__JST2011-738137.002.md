caption: β1/Fak/Src integrin signaling, cell survival, and suppression of anoikis.
  Binding of an (α)β1 integrin to its ECM ligand primarily allows the recruitment
  and activation of Fak. On the one hand, Fak activates PI3-K directly or indirectly
  via Src and/or an IRS, leading to activation of Akt. Activated Akt then performs
  various cell survival functions. On the other hand, Fak may directly recruit Grb2-Sos,
  or indirectly via Src, leading to the activation of the small GTPase Ras and thereby
  stimulating the Raf/MEK/Erk pathway. This latter pathway can also be stimulated
  by certain partner α subunits of β1, through the recruitment/activation of Fyn or
  Yes, two other Src family members, and their subsequent recruitment of p52Shc-Grb2-Sos.
  The Raf/MEK/Erk pathway then likewise performs cell survival functions. Additionally,
  the stimulation of the PI3-K/Akt and/or Raf/MEK/Erk pathways generally results in
  an upregulation of Bcl-2 expression for the anti-apoptotic homologs and a down-regulation
  for the pro-apoptotic homologs, as well as an upregulation of IAP expression and
  other apoptosis suppressor molecules, such as c-Flip. Alternatively, Fak and/or
  Src will participate in the recruitment of paxillin, talin, vinculin to assemble
  focal adhesions in direct association with actin microfilaments. Similarly, ILK
  will be engaged by β1 integrins to assemble and regulate focal adhesions along with
  its PINCH and parvin partners, whereas ILK can also contribute in microtubule assembly/stability.
  The overall stabilization of the cytoskeleton enables the sequestration of the pro-apoptotic
  homologs Bmf and Bim. Note that various other survival signaling pathways stimulated
  by integrin β1/Fak/Src signaling (e.g., p130CAS-Nck-PAK, and PKC) are not shown
  here for reasons of clarity and conciseness. Pα/β/γ, parvin α, β, γ; Pax, paxillin;
  PINCH1/2, particularly interesting new cysteine-histidine rich protein-1/-2; Tal,
  talin; Vin, vinculin.
