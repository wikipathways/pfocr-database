caption: 'Comparison of enzyme expression between Plin2-HF and WT-HF mice. Two pathways
  are shown: the TCA cycle (a) and glycolysis and gluconeogenesis metabolic pathway
  (b). For each pathway, circular nodes indicate enzymes, with size indicating a relative
  difference in expression between sample types (Plin2-HF vs. WT-HF) and color indicating
  the direction of change (see inset key). Associated heatmaps indicate global changes
  in expression for each enzyme, in addition to taxon-specific changes in expression
  for each of the 17 defined taxa colored according to phylum. Key metabolites mentioned
  in the text are indicated with bold blue text. The following abbreviations are used:
  S-adhlam-E (S-acetyldihydrolipoamide-E), 2H–ThPP (2-hydroxyethyl-ThPP), dhlam-E
  (dihydrolipoamide-E), S-sdhlam-E (S-succinyldihydrolipoamide-E), and 3C-1H-ThPP
  (3-carboxy-1-hydroxypropyl-ThPP)'
