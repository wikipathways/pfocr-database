caption: A diagram of mechanisms of glucose metabolism within the cumulus–oocyte complex.
  The carbohydrate metabolism in oocytes and cumulus cells is distinct yet closely
  related. Cumulus cells collect glucose from follicular fluid and convert it into
  pyruvate through glycolysis. Glucose in cumulus cells can also be metabolized via
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). The
  products of the HBP are converted into hyaluronic acid, which aids cumulus cells
  in synthesizing the extracellular matrix, facilitating cumulus expansion. Oocytes
  primarily utilize pyruvate provided by cumulus cells for the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation to generate energy. In addition, oocytes
  regulate glycolysis within cumulus cells through paracrine signaling factors. A
  small portion of glucose can be metabolized via the PPP pathway, producing nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which helps clear reactive oxygen species
  generated during oxidative phosphorylation, thus assisting in meiosis and nuclear
  maturation of oocytes. COC, cumulus–oocyte complex; HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic
