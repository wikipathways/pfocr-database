caption: 'Regulatory mechanism of AIM2 in inflammatory response. In the pro-inflammatory
  aspects: The AIM2 inflammasome activation leads to the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18,
  and activation of NLRC4 inflammasome and its downstream IRF1/NF-κB signaling pathway,
  playing a pro-inflammatory role. AIM2 mediates inflammatory response by enhancing
  the expression of XIAP and promoting the secretion of IFN-γ. AIM2 can also promote
  the differentiation of Tfh cells and Th17 cells to produce IL-21 and IL-17A to enhance
  inflammatory response. In the anti-inflammatory aspects: AIM2 suppresses inflammation
  by enhancing Treg cell stability and inducing pyroptosis'
