caption: 'Pathway maps showing changes in gene expression for tumour necrosis factor
  receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) patients compared with healthy volunteers
  and for patients with TRAPS with canakinumab treatment compared with baseline. (A)
  Immune response TLR signalling. (B) Immune response IL-1 signalling. (C) Apoptosis
  and survival: endoplasmic reticulum stress response. (D) Autophagy. Next to each
  differentially expressed gene, a small icon representing a thermometer can be seen.
  The thermometers marked as ‘1’ reflect transcriptional levels at baseline relative
  to healthy subjects, while the ones marked as ‘2’ reflect changes post-treatment.
  Downregulation is indicated by a blue thermometer, while upregulation is marked
  by a red thermometer, with the level of dysregulation proportional to the length
  of the colour in the thermometer. Transcripts with a fold change of 1.4 or better
  are shown in solid black boxes, while those with a fold change between 1.3 and 1.4
  are shown in dashed black boxes. Even though many of the fold changes in the pathway
  maps are lower than 1.4, the directionality of the dysregulation is consistently
  opposite between patients with TRAPS at baseline versus healthy subjects and in
  postcanakinumab-treated patients versus precanakinumab-treated patients. This lends
  support to the interpretation that these transcriptional changes are disease and
  treatment induced, respectively. In some of the cases, the transcripts are seen
  to be upregulated in the post-treatment contrast, but there is no thermometer denoted
  for the disease versus healthy contrast. In many of these cases, the fold change
  is in the opposite direction, but the absolute value is <1.3.'
