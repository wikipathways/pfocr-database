caption: CircRNAs are actively involved in host immune responses to exogenous pathogens.
  (A) CircRasGEF1B, a circRNA induced by LPS, can protect cells from bacterial infection
  by regulating the expression of ICAM-1 mRNA in the TLR4/LPS pathway. (B) Exogenous
  circRNAs released by viruses can be recognized by RIG-I, thus activating the host
  innate immunity to viruses (i). Moreover, NF90/NF110 not only promotes circRNA production
  in the nucleus but also interacts with mature host circRNAs to form circRNP complexes
  in the cytoplasm. Upon viral infection, NF90/NF110 can be released from circRNP
  complexes and bind viral mRNAs to inhibit viral replication (ii). In addition, circRNAs
  can form RNA duplexes and act as inhibitors of PKR under normal conditions. When
  a virus invades the cells of its host, RNase L is activated to efficiently degrade
  circRNAs, and PKR is released and activated to initiate the early cellular innate
  immune response (iii)
