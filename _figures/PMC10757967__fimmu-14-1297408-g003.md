caption: mTOR regulates necroptosis via various mechanisms. mTOR inhibits autophagy,
  which suppresses necroptosis by disturbing the interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3.
  Autophagy specifically recognizes and degrades ubiquitinated RIPK3 and negatively
  affects necroptosis. Furthermore, damaged mitochondria are the primary source of
  ROS, which can activate RIPK1 directly and promote the interaction between RIPK1
  and RIPK3, facilitating the assembly of necrosomes. Mitophagy restrains ROS production
  by eliminating injured mitochondria. Furthermore, RIPK1 can be activated by mTOR
  directly through phosphorylation. mTOR can elevate the level of TNRα mRNA and promote
  the autocrine effect of TNFα by activating the JNK pathway, both of which can boost
  necroptosis. Tipping the balance of the redox reaction is another approach for mTOR
  to regulate necroptosis. p62 assists with the release and stabilization of Nrf2
  by counteracting Keap1, and the released Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and governs
  the expression of genes associated with antioxidant defense to antagonize necroptosis.
  mTOR displays bidirectional effects on this process. On the one hand, mTOR inhibits
  p62 to promote necroptosis, thereby suppressing the antioxidant reaction. In contrast,
  mTOR promotes nuclear translocation to inhibit necroptosis. TNF-α, tumor necrosis
