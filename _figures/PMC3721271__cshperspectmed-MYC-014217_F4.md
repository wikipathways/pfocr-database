caption: MYC is shown to stimulate genes involved in lipid synthesis. Citrate generated
  from glucose or glutamine is converted to acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. Glycerol
  coming from glucose provides the glyceride backbone for lipid synthesis. Not shown
  is the pathway for cholesterol synthesis, which is likely to be dependent on SREBP.
