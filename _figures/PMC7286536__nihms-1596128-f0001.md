caption: This simplified figure highlights components of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K)-regulated cellular signalling events that occur downstream of the interaction
  between insulin and its receptor. While a myriad of growth factors and their cognate
  receptors (such as insulin growth factor or epidermal growth factor) activate PI3K
  signalling, here we highlight the insulin receptor, which is of particular importance
  to the systemic feedbacks central to this Review. The effects of insulin are mediated
  through both AKT-dependent (left side) and AKT-independent mechanisms (right side).
  From an evolutionary perspective, systemic insulin drives the intracellular PI3K
  signalling pathway to integrate systemic nutrient status and cellular metabolism
  with cellular functions, including proliferation and survival. This function enables
  insulin to coordinate cellular activities with systemic features, such as glucose
  availability, and provides a unified mechanism for the generation and utilization
  of key metabolites, such as deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). Under normal
  conditions, this integration of systemic and cellular activity protects the organism
  by linking metabolic requirements and cellular growth, thereby constraining cellular
  activities based on systemic factors. In the context of oncogenic transformation,
  this integration makes the insulin–PI3K signalling axis a vulnerability, as activating
  mutations in oncogenes (encoding p110 and AKT) or inactivating mutations in tumour
  suppressors (encoding p85 and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)) can decouple
  this integration. IRS, insulin receptor substrate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MTHF,
  5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway.
