caption: The notch signaling pathway. The multistep notch signaling pathway is presented
  from left to right in the figure. The first stage of notch signaling occurs in the
  ligand containing cell (top), where inactive ligands are ubiquitinated by Mib1 to
  become active. The ligands can then bind to a notch receptor present in the target
  cell membrane (middle). This receptor has an extracellular domain and an intracellular
  domain. The extracellular domain is cleaved by the metalloprotease ADAM10, before
  being endocytosed by the ligand containing cell. The intracellular domain in the
  target cell is then cleaved by γ-secretase and transported to the nucleus (bottom).
  Here, it forms a complex with Rbpj and Mam, activating transcription of target genes
  such as HES1 and HES5.
