caption: Molecular mechanisms activated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) which
  causes hypercontractility of cavernosal smooth muscle cells. Norepinephrine release
  from sympathethic nerve terminals activates α-adrenergic receptors that lead to
  the subsequent activation of specific G proteins and phospholipase C (PLC), which
  causes a rise in the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+. Increased intracellular
  Ca2+ then activates myosin light chain (MLC) and triggers smooth muscle contraction
  and subsequent penile flaccidity. Activation of Ras homolog gene family member A
  (RhoA) which is facilitated by guanosine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), stimulates
  downstream effectors, such as Rho-kinase. Activated Rho-kinase phosphorylates the
  regulatory subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase and inhibits its activity,
  thus facilitating smooth muscle cells contraction and flaccidity. TNF-α increases
  sympathetic- and α-adrenergic agonist-mediated contractions in corpora cavernosa
  and activates the RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway.
