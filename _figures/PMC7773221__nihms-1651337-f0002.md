caption: 'Thrombomodulin (TM), C4b-binding protein (C4BP), and C1-inhibitor (C1-INH)
  regulate the coagulation and the complement systems. (A) TM regulates the coagulation
  system by forming a complex with thrombin leading to the generation of APC that
  further degrades Factors Va and VIIIa. (B) TM-bound thrombin activates TAFI that
  cleaves C3a and C5a. (C) C4BP acts as a cofactor for protein S in cleaving Factors
  Va and VIIIa. (D) C4BP inhibits the classical and lectin complement pathways by
  accelerating the decay of C4b2a, the C3 convertase. C4BP acts as the cofactor for
  Factor I-mediated cleavage of C4b, and less efficiently of C3b. (E) C1-INH inhibits
  Factor XIa and the kinin-kallikrein system in the intrinsic coagulation pathway.
  (F) C1-INH dissociates the C1qrs complex assembled on the antigen-antibody complex
  in the classical complement pathway. APC: activated protein C; aTAFI: activated
  thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor; EPCR: endothelial cell protein C receptor;
  HMW kininogen: high molecular weight kininogen; PC: protein C; PS: protein S; TAFI:
  thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor.'
