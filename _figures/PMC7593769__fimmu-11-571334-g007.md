caption: Model of the C. acnes-induced intracellular signaling pathways. C. acnes
  recognition in human macrophages is carried out by membrane bound toll-like receptors
  with its adapter MyD88. This further leads to the activation of the NF-κB pathway
  and the subsequent expression of inflammatory cytokines. The TLR adapter TRIF shows
  importance during C. acnes-induced IFN-signaling. TRIF can be activated by specific
  TLR activation on the cell membrane or in the endosome and has also been shown to
  positively regulate the cGAS/STING pathway. Whether C. acnes is recognized by membrane-bound
  or endosomal TLR-TRIF or simply boosts the cGAS/STING pathway in a TRIF-dependent
  manner is not known.
