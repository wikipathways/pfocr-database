caption: 'Cholesterol metabolism in the tumor microenvironment affect the function
  of tumor-infiltrating immune cells: Tumor-derived cholesterol can induce a dysfunctional
  state of CD8+ T cells with loss of antitumor function by overexpressing inhibitory
  receptors, inhibit the antitumor function of Tc9 cells by activating the LXR signaling
  pathway and lowering IL-9 expression. Tumor-derived oxysterols can reduce the expression
  of CCR7 in mature DCs and ultimately inhibit the migration of DCs to draining lymph
  nodes and anti-tumor immune response. In addition, tumor-produced oxysterols promote
  the recruitment of neutrophils by binding and activating CXCR2 and recruited neutrophils
  have been shown to promote tumor growth by releasing large amounts of total MMP-9
  and enhance mRNA levels of Bv8. What’s more, oxysterols released by cancer cells
  can inhibit the activation of macrophage and promote M2 polarization of macrophages
  by binding to LXR in immune cells.'
