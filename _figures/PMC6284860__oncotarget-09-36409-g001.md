caption: In B cells, the balance of BCR activation initiation, amplitude and duration
  can be influenced by a specific immunoglobulin structure, adaptor molecules (e.g.
  GAB1, BLNK), kinases (e.g. LYN, SYK, BTK, PI3K) or phosphatases (e.g. SHIP1, SHP1
  and PTEN) activity and miRNAs levels. The cell-membrane proteins depicted in red
  represent the "negative" BCR pathway regulators (left part of the figure), and the
  cell-membrane proteins depicted in green represent the "positive" regulators (right
  part of the figure). The role of p53→miR-34a┤FOXP1 axis during DNA damage response
  and BCR signalling is highlighted in bold. The regulation of miRNA targets happens
  at the mRNA stability and/or translation level, which is not visualized here. Direct
  miRNA transcription regulation by transcription factors in the nucleus is depicted.
  The sharp point arrow indicates activation; the blunt-end arrow indicates repression.
