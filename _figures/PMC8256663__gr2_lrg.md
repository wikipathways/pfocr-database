caption: The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in the host cells. The S glycoproteins of the
  virion utilizes the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and
  cellular protease TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) to enter target cells
  through an endosomal pathway. The viral RNA is uncoated and released into the cytoplasm
  soon after the entry of the virus into the host cell. ORF1a and ORF1ab are translated
  to produce pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins, which are then cleaved by viral proteases
  encoded by ORF1a to produce 16 non-structural proteins that assemble into the RNA
  replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC). Both replication and transcription of negative-sense
  RNAs[(-)RNA)] are carried out by this RTC complex; during the replication phase,
  full-length (−) RNA copies of the genome are produced and used as templates for
  full-length (+) RNA genomes, in the transcription process, a subset of 7-9 sub-genomic
  RNAs, including those encoding all structural proteins, are produced through discontinuous
  transcription. Following the production of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, nucleocapsids
  are assembled in the cytoplasm from genomic RNA and N protein. Virion particles
  are formed by budding into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi intermediate
  compartment and finally released from the infected cell through exocytosis.
