caption: Proposed model of miR-30c-5p-EVs as new avenues for the treatment of PTC
  cancer. PELI1 was highly expressed in PTC cancer, while miR-30c-5p was poorly expressed.
  MiR-30c-5p could inhibit PTC cell proliferation and migration by negatively mediating
  the expression of the PELI1. MiR-30c-5p-EVs could significantly downregulate PELI1
  expression and suppress the progression of PTC in vitro and in vivo, concomitant
  with reduced p-AKT, Ki-67 and MMP-2 expression
