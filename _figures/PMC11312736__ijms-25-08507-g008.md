caption: Overview of the saturated and unsaturated fatty acid metabolic pathways and
  mevalonate and isoprenoid biosynthesis at intermediate and mature stages of YGD
  and MPT zygotic embryos. (A) saturated fatty acid biosynthesis, (B) saturated fatty
  acid degradation, (C) mevalonate and isoprenoid biosynthesis, (D) polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFAs) degradation. The black bars correspond to MPT, while the empty
  bars correspond to YGD. The dotted arrows represent several reaction steps that
  connect pathways, the continuous arrows represent a direct reaction of the pathway.
  The boxes outlined in red represent metabolic pathways. ACSL = putative long chain
  acyl-CoA synthetase; CPT1A = carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1; CPT2 = carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1; ACADVL = acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; echA1 = enoyl-CoA hydratase;
  HACL1 = 2-hydroxy acyl-CoA lyase; fadA = acetyl-CoA acyltransferase; ACAT = acetyl-CoA
  acetyltransferase, cytosolic 1; Polyprenyl_synt = geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase
  large subunit 1 chloroplastic
