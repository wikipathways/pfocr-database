caption: S1P is synthesized from serine and palmitoyl-CoA by a de novo pathway or
  from the ubiquitous membrane lipid sphingolipia (SMD). Sphingosine is produced by
  hydrolysis of ceramides, which can be recycled by acylation, a process known as
  the “rescue pathway” that can lead to ccramide regeneration. In the cell membrane
  and cytoplasm, sphinganine is converted to S1P by sphinganine kinases (SphKs). Finally,
  SIP is cleaved by SIP cleaver (SPL) or dephosphorylated to hexadecaneal and phosphothanolamine
