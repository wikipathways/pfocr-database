caption: Integrated metabolic pathways of BH4 metabolism in ME/CFS pathogenesis. (Red
  enclosure) The glycolysis pathway of glucose metabolism leads to the formation of
  pyruvate. Pyruvate is transported to mitochondria, converted to acetyl CoA, and
  metabolized by the TCA cycle, generating reduced intermediates for ATP production.
  The utilization of glucose by glycolysis is compromised in ME/CFS pathogenesis.
  Reduced oxygen consumption by mitochondria was reported to uncouple the electron
  transport chain for ATP synthesis. (Green enclosure) Augmented pentose phosphate
  pathway by the enzymic activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH),
  Transketolase (TK), and transaldolase (TALDO). Reduced oxygen consumption by mitochondria
  and enhanced bioavailability of NADPH may induce the reduction potential in the
  cell, causing reversible enzymes TALDO and TK to increase the biogenesis of ribose-5-phosphate
  (R5P). (Yellow enclosure) Synthesis of purine metabolites. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate
  synthase (PRPPS) enzyme converts R5P to inosine-5-monophosphate (IMP), which is
  converted to GMP by the successive enzymic actions of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH)
  and GMP synthase (GMPS). GTP is synthesized by GTP, which generates BH4 via the
  direct pathway by the enzymic action of GTPCH1. R5P is the direct precursor for
  purine biosynthesis. Once the bioavailability of R5P increases and its utilization
  via glycolysis is inhibited, it is expected that the downstream formation of purine
  metabolites via the nucleotide biosynthetic pathway (yellow enclosure) will be operative.
  Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase (PRPPS) is the first enzyme of the purine
  biosynthetic pathway that catalyzes the synthesis of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate
  (PRPP) from R5P. Previous studies reported that the induction of hypoxia enhanced
  the enzymic activity of PRPPS [52]. Accordingly, our biochemical assay also identified
  a very strong level of PRPP in the microglial cells when a hypoxic or less-oxygenated
  environment was implemented [21]. Moreover, we also demonstrated that inosine-5-monophosphate
  dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a rate-limiting enzyme of purine biosynthesis, and GMP synthase
  (GMPS), another key enzyme of purine biogenesis, were upregulated in hypoxic condition.
  Interestingly, inhibition of the non-oxidative PPP by taldo1 siRNA also attenuated
  the expression of both IMPDH and GMPS in microglia. Collectively, these observations
  demonstrated that the augmentation of the non-oxidative PPP by hypoxia-induced strong
  reductive potential guided R5P for purine biogenesis
