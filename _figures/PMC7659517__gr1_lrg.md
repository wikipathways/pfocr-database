caption: 'The Warburg effect likely supports replication of SARS CoV2 in airway cells.Enhanced
  aerobic glycolysis sustains the replication of many viruses in a similar way to
  the Warburg effect. Glycolysis sustains the production of molecules required for
  nucleotide synthesis, such as R5P, glycine and methyl groups (not represented).
  This metabolism is stimulated in particular by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway which
  promotes PDK1 activity. PDK1 inhibits PDH, thus blocking the entry of pyruvate into
  mitochondria. A part of the glucose is transformed into pyruvate, which is further
  transformed by LDH into lactate. This molecule is expulsed outside the cell in the
  microenvironment by monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) where it participates to
  immune response inhibition. AKT also stimulates ACLY reaction sustaining production
  of acetyl-CoA molecules for histone acetylation (required for transcription) and
  de novo FAS (required for membrane replication). ACLY also produces OAA which sustains
  aspartate formation required for nucleotide synthesis (not figured). Glutamine metabolism
  participates in supporting nucleotide synthesis and ATP production. Glutamine can
  also support citrate synthesis by sustaining glutamate production, and TCA cycle
  functioning. Of note, AKG carboxylation followed by IDH1 reverse reaction can also
  sustain citrate synthesis (not figured).ACE2: viral receptor angiotensin converting
  enzyme 2; ACLY: ATP citrate lyase, AKT or Protein Kinase B, AKG: α-ketoglutarate,
