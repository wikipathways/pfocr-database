caption: Cardiac voltage‐gated potassium channel structure, accessory proteins and
  signaling. (A) The contribution of the outward current Ito (upper) mediated by Kv4.3
  to action potential (AP) Phase I (lower). (B) Kv4.3 is formed by the α subunit and
  accessory protein K+ channel interacting protein 2 (KChIP2, β subunit). A tripartite
  complex including the anchoring protein SAP97 and kinase CaMKII is formed at the
  Kv4.3 carboxyl‐terminal domain (CTD) via a PDZ domain‐binding motif Ser‐Ala‐Leu
  (SAL). The channel current is modulated by CaMKII and NF‐kB activation, which are
  themselves mediated by β‐AR stimulation. (C) The contribution of the outward current
  IKs (upper) is mediated by the delayed rectifier potassium channel (Kv7.1) to AP
  Phase II and III (lower). (D) Kv7.1 is formed from the α1 subunit, which consists
  of four homologous domains with avoltage sensing S4 segment and pore‐forming S5
  and S6 segments in each domain. Auxiliary subunit KCNE1 interacts with residue V141
  of S1 in KCNQ1 to allow the complex only open from a fully activated S4 conformation
  by altering the VSD S4‐to‐gate coupling, and also interacts with F339 in KCNQ1 to
  reduce the open probability at negative voltages. PIP2 binds to the S4‐S5 linker
  during membrane depolarization. CaM binds at the Kv7.1 C‐terminus, where it can
  compete with and replace PIP2. CaM also interacts with the Kv7.1 voltage sensor
  domain. Kv7.1 is modulated by the β‐AR/PKA pathway, which phosphorylates Kv7.1 at
  its amino‐terminal domain (NTD; S27). A‐kinase anchoring protein 9 (AKAP9) interacts
  with the LZ motif in the Kv7.1 CTD and is anchored by PKA and PP1. (E) The contribution
  of the outward current IKr (upper) mediated by the inwardly rectifying potassium
  channel (Kv11.1) to AP Phase II and III (lower). (F) The α subunit of Kv11.1 contains
  six transmembrane helices, with S4 acting as the voltage sensor and S5‐S6 forming
  the pore. The KCNE β subunits KCNE1 and KCNE2 interact with Kv11.1. The adaptor
  protein 14‐3‐3ℇ interacts with Kv11.1 in the NTD and CTD. β1‐AR competes with Kv11.1
  for association with 14‐3‐3ℇ proteins. β‐AR/PKA, α1‐AR/PKC, and AT1/PKC are involved
  in Kv11.1 channel modulation. PKA and PKC phosphorylate the α1 subunit (red arrows).
  (G) The contribution of the strong inward rectifier potassium current IK1 (upper)
  mediated by the Kir2.1 channel to AP Phase 0, III, and IV (lower). (H) Kir2.1 channels
  have two membrane‐spanning domains; a p‐loop that forms the ion selectivity filter
  and intracellular N‐ and C‐terminal domains. The CTD of Kir2.1 directly associates
  with AP1, AKAP79, and SAP97. SAP97 also interacts with β1‐AR and to modulates the
  effect of β1‐AR on Kir2.1. AKAP79 can bind with SAP97 and also anchor kinases (PKA,
  PKC), and phosphatase (PP2B) close to Kir2.1phosphorylation sites. The NTD of Kir2.1
  directly interact with, caveolin‐3 which regulates Kir2.1 trafficking and surface
  expression. PIP2 binds to both the CTD and the NTD to modulate channel gating
