caption: A model illustrating how ARFs, miRNAs, and GH3s proteins regulate adventitious
  rooting by controlling IAA and JA homeostasis during AR formation in Arabidopsis
  seedlings. Auxin controls adventitious root initiation by activating ARF6 and ARF8,
  leading to the downregulation of inhibitory COI1 signaling (, ). ARF6, ARF8, and
  ARF17 and their regulatory miRNAs interact in a complex network and act upstream
  of GH3.3, GH3.5, and GH3.6. ARF6 and ARF8 are positive regulators of these three
  GH3 genes, whereas ARF17 is a negative regulator. The three GH3 proteins control
  free IAA levels and JA homeostasis. The JA level determines the JA-Ile level. JA-Ile
  negatively regulates adventitious rooting by activating the COI1 signaling pathway.
  AGO1 upregulates GH3 genes by downregulating ARF17, thereby regulating adventitious
  rooting through this pathway, as well. Another feedback circuit consist of DAO1,
  IAA, and COI1-dependent JA signaling. COI1-dependent JA signaling actives the expression
  of DAO1, which in turn regulates IAA homeostasis by irreversible degradation ().  and  proposed
  a model of the involvement of SAUR15 in auxin signaling-mediated AR formation in
  Arabidopsis seedlings. ARFs directly bind to the promoter of SAUR15 to activate
  its expression. SAUR15 promote AR formation via two pathways. SAUR15 inhibit PP2C.D
  activity, leading to the release of membrane H+-ATPase activity, which then causes
  apoplastic acidification and cell expansion, thereby facilitating AR emergence.
  SAUR15 also activates auxin biosynthesis to promote AR formation. Red arrows represent
  positive regulation, and blue bars represent negative regulation.
