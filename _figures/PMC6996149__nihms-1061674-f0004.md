caption: 'Cholesterol is synthesized de novo in brain. Cholesterol is not able to
  pass blood-brain barrier (BBB). The most predominant pathway of cholesterol excretion
  is by 24(S)-hydroxylation which is catalyzed by CYP46A1 expressed exclusively in
  the brain, particularly in neurons and some astrocyte. Cholesterol can also be converted
  to 26HC in the brain by CYP27A1 expressed in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.
  However, most brain 26HC originates from the circulation. The import rate of 26HC
  from circulation to brain is reported to be 4–5 mg/24 h. 25-Hydroxylation can also
  be occurred in brain. 25HC and 26HC are 7α-hydroxylated by CYP7B1. Resulting 7α,25-diHC
  and 7α,26-diHC are converted to 3-oxo-Δ forms (C4–25-ol and C4–26-ol) and excreted
  out of brain. In AD, higher brain 26HC have been reported. A decreased brain 24HC
  and increased its’ level in plasma as well as cerebrospinal fluid are reported.
  Significance of oxysterols to the pathogenesis of AD and PD are not yet defined.
  However, increased 26HC in MS can be transported to the brain which possibly alters
  the levels and ratio of 26HC and 24HC. Abbreviations: BAs, bile acids; CH25H, cholesterol
