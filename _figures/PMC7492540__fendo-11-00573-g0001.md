caption: A schematic of known pathways regulated by AR in various breast cancer subtypes.
  (A) In ER-positive BC, it has been found that AR influenced the ER pathway by competition
  with ER for attaching to the modulatory regions of ER genes; meanwhile, the AR/ER
  expression ratio makes a critical difference in the regulation of BC cell proliferation.
  (B) In HER2-positive BC, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is up-regulated by
  the AR. AR/β-catenin complex, together with FOXA1, induces HER3 gene transcription.
  Next, HER3 and HER2 create a heterodimer, thereby stimulating the PI3K/AKT pathway
  and MYC gene expression. Additionally, ERK, AR, and HER2 take part in a positive
  feedback cycle. (C) In TNBC, the up-regulation of PTEN through AR or ERβ represses
  PI3K action, which in turn reduces AR activity. Suppression of GPER by AR can also
  modulate cell behavior positively, while suppression of ARNILA results in negative
  modulation.
