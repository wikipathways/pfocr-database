caption: Schematic illustration of the PM@QR/RP-NP preparation (Scheme A). The expression
  of the Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathway is enhanced by using quercetin to clear ROS
  and maintain mitochondrial stability, thereby alleviating oxidative stress damage
  to endothelial cells in the early stage of IRI. In the middle and late stages of
  IRI, rapamycin is used to reduce the JNK signaling pathway in M1 macrophages, alleviating
  the effects of inflammatory factors on the inflammatory microenvironment and promoting
  macrophage polarization to M2, thereby solving the long-term inflammatory damage
  caused by excessive release of inflammatory factors by synergistic treatment to
  alleviate biliary complications after liver transplantation (Scheme B)
