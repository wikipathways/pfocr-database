caption: The extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Engagement of death receptors (e.g., Fas,
  also known as CD95) by their cognate ligands (e.g., Fas/CD95 ligand) leads to the
  recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD. FADD in turn recruits procaspase-8, procaspase-10
  (not shown), and a caspase-8/10-like molecule c-FLIP. These proteins form the DISC,
  in which procaspase-8 (and procaspase-10) becomes activated through an autoproteolytic
  cleavage. The active caspase-8 then cleaves and activates the effector caspases,
  caspase-3 and caspase-7. DISC, death-inducing signaling complex.
