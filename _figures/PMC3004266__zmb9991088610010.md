caption: Proposed model for the impact of the active Cdk1/cyclin B1 complex on the
  extrinsic death pathway. During the cell cycle, Cdk1/cyclin B1 associates with procaspase-8.
  As cyclin B1 becomes abundant in G2, the active Cdk1/cyclin B1 complex phosphorylates
  Ser-387 on procaspase-8 at the centrosomes. This phosphorylation event inhibits
  the processing of procaspase-8, thus blocking its enzymatic activation and the downstream
  initiation of apoptotic signaling. This cellular barrier seems to protect mitotic
  cells against Fas-mediated apoptosis. The identification of Ser-387 phosphorylation
  of procaspase-8 in primary lymphocytes and breast tissues suggests both a physiological
  and a pathophysiological role for this process in vivo.
