caption: The main steps of MVA pathway. MVA pathway, also known as cholesterol/isoprenoid
  biosynthetic pathway, is a pivotal metabolic pathway expressed in all mammalian
  cells. It leads to the production of several end-products, required for the proper
  functioning of cell physiology. HMGR represents the key and rate-limiting enzyme
  of the whole pathway, and is responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA into MVA.
  HMGR is strongly inhibited by statins.
