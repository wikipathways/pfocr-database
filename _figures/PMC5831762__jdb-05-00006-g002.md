caption: A simple diagrammatic representation of the (known) key events in Shh signaling
  at the primary cilium. In the absence of signal (OFF), Ptch1 accumulates at the
  ciliary membrane and represses Smo. GLI proteins are sequestered by Kif7 and Suppressor-of-fused
  (SuFu), and phosphorylated through the activity of Gpr161, PKA, CK1 and GSK3B. The
  phosphorylated GLI proteins are proteolytically processed into truncated repressor
  forms, which act to inhibit transcriptional activation of the pathway. The signaling
  pathway is activated (ON) through the binding of Shh to Ptch1, which is facilitated
  by Cdo, Boc and Gas1 co-receptors. The receptor complex is internalized and degraded,
  which leads to the accumulation of Smo in the ciliary membrane, where it is phosphorylated
  and interacts with Ellis-van Creveld (EvC) proteins in the basal component of the
  cilium. The Kif7, SuFu, and GLI complex moves to the tip of the cilium where GLI
  is concentrated and then transported back to the cytosol where it enters the nucleus
  as a full length activator of transcriptional targets.
