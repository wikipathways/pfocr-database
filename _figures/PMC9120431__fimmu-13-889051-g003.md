caption: The comparison of NKG2D and NCR signaling pathways between γδ T cells and
  NK cells. NKG2D in NK cells associates with adapter DAP10 (PI3K and Grb2-Vav1 signaling)
  or DAP12 (Syk/ZAP70 signaling) to directly induce cytotoxicity and/or cytokine release.
  NKG2D in γδ T cells not only directly triggers cytotoxicity via PI3K-dependent pathway
  by coupling with DAP10, but also enhances the effector function in a TCR-independent
  way via PKCθ. However, the impact of NKG2D-DAP12 complex on the function on γδ T
  cells remain elusive. NCRs in NK cells and γδ T cells can induce cytotoxicity activity.
  However, signaling pathways of NCRs-ligands in NK cells are well-understood, which
  in γδ T cells remain unclear.
