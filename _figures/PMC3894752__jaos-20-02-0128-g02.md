caption: 'NF-κB pathway: IκBs bind to functional NF-kB transcription factors (p50/p60)
  in cytoplasm in absence of stimuli and prevent their nuclear translocation. Signaling
  through TNF receptor (TNFR), IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), or toll-like receptor (TLR)
  can activate a cascade that involves the recruitment of MYD88 (myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88) and IRAK (interleukin-1-receptor associated kinase). Activation
  of IRAK results in the phosphorylation of TNF-receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6),
  leading to transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) activation, which,
  in turn, is required for IκB kinase complex (IKK) phosphorylation. IKK then phosphorylates
  the IκBα protein, which results in ubiquitination, dissociation of IκBα from NF-κB
  and degradation of IκBα by the proteosome. The NF-κB protein then translocates to
  the nucleus where it binds to its specific DNA and initiates transcription of multiples
  genes. The IKK inhibitor, BMS-345541 prevents IκBα degradation and therefore activation
  of NF-κB'
