caption: Transition of carbons in the synthesis of citrate from lactate reflects the
  prochiral nature of citrate in the TCA cycle (a symmetrical molecule that reacts
  asymmetrically). Oxaloacetate is the precursor of aspartic acid. 2-Oxoglutarate
  is the precursor of glutamate. The FT-ICR MS spectrum of glutamic acid confirms
  that the C-5 (#) originated from the C-4 of oxaloacetate and that the C-1 (^) of
  glutamic acid originated from the C-1 of acetyl-CoA.
