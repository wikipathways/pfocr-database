caption: Representation of the secretory pathway followed by the N-glycoproteins.
  The biosynthesis of the N-glycans is initiated on the cytosolic face of the ER.
  The resulting Man5GlcNAc-PP-Dol precursor is then flipped onto the luminal side
  ER lumen where further maturation of the sugar precursor occurs (Glc3Man9GlcNAc-PP-Dol).
  At this point the N-glycan structure is transferred to the nascent polypeptide.
  After removal of three Glc residues the N-glycoproteins enter the calnexin-calreticulin
  cycle (CNX/CRT; Hebert et al., ). The alternate action of glucosidase II and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein
  glucosyltransferase drives the glycoprotein through this cycle until it is correctly
  folded and exported from the ER to the GA. Misfolded proteins are directed from
  the ER to the cytosol by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery for proteasomal
  hydrolysis (Hebert et al., ; Crofts et al., ; Helenius and Aebi, ; Jin et al., ;
  Lederkremer, ). Glucosyl transferase and glucosidases implicated the in the sugar
  trimming in the ER and identified in plants so far, are enlisted in Table . Subsequent
  modifications of the N-glycans occur in the GA and potentially in other cellular
  compartments, such as the chloroplast and vacuole (based on a model presented in
  Gomord et al. (). The first indirect insights into the location and orientation
  of plant glycosyltransferases were provided by immunolocalization of the enzyme
  products (Laine et al., ; Fitchette et al., , ). Such studies indicated that β-1,2-xylose
  is added to plant N-glycans mainly in the medial Golgi while the α-1,3-fucosylation
  occurs predominantly in the trans-Golgi (Fitchette et al., ).
