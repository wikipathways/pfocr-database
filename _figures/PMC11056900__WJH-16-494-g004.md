caption: 'Molecular mechanism of Chinese medicines regulating the treatment of chronic

  to reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, etc.
  to stabilize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Rhein is capable of anti-lipid peroxidation
  and scavenging of ROS, and inhibits the activities of TNF-a and IL-1β to stabilize
  the ER. vA significantly reduces malondialdehyde and elevates the levels of SOD
  to reduce ROS in mitochondria. vA has the ability to reduce lipid accumulation in

  Ca2+ homeostasis through the regulation of PERK-MAMs pathway. VA has the ability
  to reduce intracellular lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and effectively protect
  ER and Ca2+ homeostasis. quercetin inhibits alcohol-induced iron death in hepatocytes
  and alleviates alcoholic liver injury through the regulation of the PERK-MAMs pathway.
