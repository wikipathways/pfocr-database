caption: Mechanisms of antifungal tolerance. The mechanisms include rapid coordination
  of numerous signal transduction pathways that depend on the antifungal drug used.
  Echinocandin tolerance mechanism, known as the cell wall integrity pathway, involves
  protein kinase C (PKC), high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG), and calcineurin pathways,
  followed by the overexpression of chitin synthase, and FKS1 and FKS2 to compensate
  for the reduction of β-1,3-d-glucan level in the cell wall. Membrane integrity pathway
  orchestrates the azole tolerance pathways, which includes PKC and calcineurin pathways.
  As it is shown, HSP90 plays a critical role in antifungal tolerance by stabilizing
  the key regulatory proteins.
