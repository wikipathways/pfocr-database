caption: (a) Host mRNAs differ from HCV RNA with respect to the presence of a 5′m7GpppN
  cap and a 3′ poly(A) tail, both of which help to stabilize host cell mRNA. General
  mRNA decay initiates with removal of the 3′ poly(A) tail by a deadenylase complex
  and is followed by either 5′-to-3′ or 3′-to-5′ degradation. In the 3′-to-5′ pathway,
  the RNA body is degraded by the 3′ exosome complex. The residual cap-oligonucleotide
  is cleaved by the scavenger decapping enzyme, DCPS. In the 5′-to-3′ pathway, the
  5′ cap is removed by decapping enzymes and the RNA body degraded by the cytoplasmic
  5′ exonuclease, XRN1. (b) Positive-strand HCV RNA possesses a 5′ triphosphate and
  terminates in a stable 3′ stem-loop. Its decay by constitutive mRNA decay pathways
  commences with removal of the 5′ triphosphate by an unknown cellular pyrophosphatase,
  followed by XRN1-mediated degradation as in the host mRNA 5′-to-3′decay pathway.
  HCV RNAs are protected from decay by their location within the detergent-resistant
  membranes of the membranous web, and by miR-122 interactions with the 5′UTR. Whether
  miR-122 mediates protection against the putative pyrophosphatase or XRN1 (or both)
  is not known. Unlike decay of host mRNAs, the exosome complex plays no role in this
  process. Interferon and cytokine-inducible endoribonucleases and exoribonucleases
  represent alternative mechanisms for degradation of HCV RNA. Whereas these ribonucleases
  are actively expressed within the HCV-infected liver, their level of expression
  may be moderated by the ability of the HCV NS3/4A protease to cleave key adaptor
  proteins involved in signaling from pathogen recognition receptors such as RIG-I
  and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are capable of sensing the presence of foreign
  RNA.
