caption: (A) Convergent biosynthetic pathways for the production of fosfomycin as
  found in different genera. For the pathway in pseudomonads (top), the reactions
  that have been confirmed by experimental data are shown as single transformations.
  For the pathway from streptomycetes (bottom), only the methyl transfer step has
  not been definitively confirmed and is shown with dashed lines. For the pathway
  in Pseudomonas, the epoxide oxygen in fosfomycin is hypothesized to originate from
  the β-carbonyl of PnPy (shown in red). This has been confirmed for the pathway in
  Streptomyces. (B-C) Reactions catalyzed by the orthologous enzymes Psf4 and HppE
  on different enantiomers of 2-HPP. The reactions are drawn using oxygen and an electron
  source a performed initially, but recent studies show that the reactions can also
  proceed using hydrogen peroxide as a co-substrate.
