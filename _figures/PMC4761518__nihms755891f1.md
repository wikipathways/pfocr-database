caption: Muscle wasting processes are regulated by a number of receptor mediated signaling
  pathways. The binding of IGF-1 to its receptor results in the activation of insulin
  receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which promotes the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K). The PI3K in-turn is responsible for the addition of a phosphate group to
  the intramembranous phosphoinositide-(4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2) to result in phosphoinositide-(3,4,5)-triphosphate
  (PIP3). IGF-1 receptor mediated activation of protein synthesis is PI3K dependent.
  The serine/threonine kinase Akt, binds PIP3 on the membrane through an N-terminal
  pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and is activated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1
  (PDK1). The recruitment of Akt to the membrane and the activation of Akt through
  PDK1 promotes Akt release into cytosol to activate mTOR and other downstream effectors.
  mTOR can also signal upstream to further activate Akt. Akt acts on mTOR by TSC1
  and TSC2, which in turn increases mTOR activity. Myostatin (MSTN) and TGF-β when
  activated, bind to their respective receptors and activate the Smads (Smad2/3) as
  well as p38 MAPK signaling. MSTN can activate FOXO directly or through the activation
  of smad, while TGF-β mostly signals through the Smad2/3 alone. p38 MAPK is activated
  by TAK1 downstream of the activin and TGF-β receptors, and it can regulate the activity
  of various transcription factors to control gene expression related to muscle function.
  Under stress, the glucocorticoids act on the muscle antagonistic to the actions
  of insulin, resulting in the enhancement of protein degradation, reduced protein
  synthesis, and marked reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Both genetic
  and epigenetic mechanisms have been found to be at play in muscles that in turn
  regulate or are regulated through protein and glucose signaling through modulation
  of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway. MuRF1 possesses a GRE in its proximal promoter, and
  its regulation by GCs depends on GR homodimerization. In contrast, Atrogin-1 is
  activated through an indirect mechanism, involving competitive binding of GR with
  AKT leads to the downstream activation of FOXO1/3, transcriptional regulators of
  MAFbx, thus, indirectly inducing MAFbx expression.
