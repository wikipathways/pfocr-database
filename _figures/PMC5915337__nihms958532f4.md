caption: A. Diagrammatic and pie chart representation of cell cycle, G1/S transition,
  AR axis and PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways and proteins altered by expression
  of the SiM-miRNA mimetics in LNCaP cells. The order of the SiM-miRNAs in each pie
  chart follows that depicted in (B) for AR. C. Pathway analysis of the RPPA results
  indicates that many of the targets altered by the SiM-miRNA mimetics (at least six
  in the same direction) are involved in G1/S transition, DNA replication, eukaryotic
  translation initiation, activation of post-cap dependent binding to ribosomes, AKT
  and mTOR signaling. The AKT/mTOR pathway was significantly targeted, with phospho-AKT(pSer473
  and Thr308), phospho-GSK3(Ser9), phospho-S6(Ser235/236 and Ser240/244), phospho-p90RSK(pThr359/Ser363)
  and phospho-4EBP1(pSer65, Thr37/46/70) being suppressed by SiM-miRNA mimetic transfection.
  Interestingly, mTOR (phospho and total) tended to be increased. D. Heatmap of RPPA
  results from LNCaP cells transfected with miR135a-5p mimetics in biologic triplicates
  for 48 hours. Each column represents a separate transfection for miR-NT (non-target
  miR) or miR-135a-5p.
