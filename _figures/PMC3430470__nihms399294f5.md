caption: The major pathways for monosaccharide metabolism in cells and their intracellular
  locations are shown in schematic. The 3 compartments are cytoplasm, mitochondrion
  and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Glucose (Glc), Galactose (Gal) and Fructose (Frc)
  enter and exit the cell on Class 1, 2 and 3 GLUTs. Lactate (produce by glycolysis)
  can enter or leave the cell on monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). Galactose and
  glucose enter glycolysis as glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P). Fructose enters at later
  steps in the glycolytic pathway as either dihydroxyacetone phosphate or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
  Glycolysis produces 2 ATP molecules per entering glucose molecule. The Pentose phosphate
  pathway produces to NADPH molecules and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
  produces 34–36 ATP molecules per glucose. Gluconeogenesis, which can be fed by pyruvate,
  amino acids or glycerol, produces G-6-P which is transported into the ER by a G-6-P/Pi
  antiporter (G6PT), dephosphorylated to Glc, which is then exported to the cytoplasm
  by ER GLUTs. G-6-P is converted reversibly to a useful glucose storage form (glycogen)
  by glycogen synthesis. Anabolic use of Glc, Gal or Frc in membrane protein and lipid
  glycosylation is not shown.
