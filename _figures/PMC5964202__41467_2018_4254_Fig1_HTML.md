caption: Schematic overview of the SCRaMbLE-in toolkit for metabolic engineering.
  Once designed, the synthetic pathway of interest will be rapidly prototyped in vitro.
  The pathway is pre-assembled in such a way that all genes are assembled with respective
  regulatory elements, except that one key gene is left “promoter-less”, having a
  recombination site upstream. Three recombination systems, Cre-loxP, VCre-Vlox, and
  Dre-rox, were developed to integrate a range of promoters upstream to the key gene
  in the pathway. The assembled library is transformed into yeast and potentially
  productive pathways are selected and integrated in vivo in the next step. The selected
  productive pathways are flanked with a pair of loxPsym sites and can subsequently
  be integrated into the synthetic chromosomes through SCRaMbLE, and simultaneously
  the synthetic yeast chassis undergoes whole-genome rearrangement to result in strain
  optimization. The successful integrated strains will be profiled with mass spectrometry
  analysis and next-generation sequencing
