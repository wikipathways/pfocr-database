caption: The Kynurenine Pathway and its downstream pathways of Serotonin/Melatonin,
  BH4, Glycolysis, and NAD+. Tryptophan is converted into serotonin and melatonin,
  that regulate mood and sleep. The tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathway interacts with
  the KP in three ways, (1) the sharing of the enzyme TPH that degrades tryptophan,
  (2) the inhibition of a key BH4 pathway enzyme, sepiapterin reductase, (3) both
  BH4 and KP are induced by inflammatory cytokines. Tryptophan also feeds into the
  glycolysis cycle via ACMS, affecting ATP production. Finally, the KP is the de novo
  synthesis pathway of NAD+ which is associated with cellular energy, repair and fatigue.
  The key KPMs are bolded, neurotoxic metabolites represented in red, neuroprotective
  metabolites in green, and dual functioning in blue.
