caption: 'The dynamic and reversible processes of DNA methylation. The whole epigenetic
  progression of 5mC contains three aspects: de novo methylation, methylation maintenance,
  and demethylation. DNMT3A and DNMT3B were reported to be involved in de novo methylation,
  while DNMT1 was found to participate in the maintenance of DNA methylation. Besides,
  the process of demethylation can be divided into two parts: passive demethylation
  and active demethylation. Passive DNA demethylation is attributed to the absence
  of DNMTs, while active demethylation is due to the involvement of TET or TDG enzymes
  and BER repair pathway. Abbreviation: DNA methyltransferase: DNMT; Ten eleven translocation:
  TET; Thymine DNA glycosylase: TDG; Base excision repair: BER; Fifth position of
  cytosine: 5mC; 5-hydroxymethylcytosine: 5hmC; 5-formylcytosine: 5fC; 5-carboxylcytosine:
  5caC.'
