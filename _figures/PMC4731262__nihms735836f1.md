caption: Wnt expression, modification and secretion. In Wnt producing cells, Wnt proteins
  are lipid modified in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by Porcupine and then
  transported to the Golgi, where they encounter Wntless (Wls). Supported by Wls,
  Wnt ligands are directly delivered to the plasma membrane through Trans-Golgi network
  (TGN). Wls is then taken up by the clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the retromer
  complex routes Wls back to the Golgi from the plasma membrane. (B) The principle
  of Wnt signaling. Once released from the producing cells, Wnt initiates signal by
  interacting with the Frizzled receptor and co-receptors LRP5/6 at the plasma membrane
  of target cells and activates Dsh. At Dsh level, Wnt signaling is branched into
  canonical and non-canonical pathways. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling
  leads to β-catenin stabilization, accumulation and nuclear translocation, which
  enables β-catenin to influence the expression of downstream target genes. Non-canonical
  Wnt signaling invokes several β-catenin independent pathways via the activation
  of the Frizzled receptor. In Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, Dsh transfers
  signal to the small GTP-binding proteins Rho and Rac. In Wnt/Ca2+pathway, the Frizzled
  receptor also interfaces with a trimeric G-protein and results in the release of
  calcium from ER. When concentration of calcium rises, protein kinase C (PKC) and
  calcineurin will be activated. Calcineurin induces the nuclear factor of activated
  T-cells (NFAT), which regulates cell fate and migration.
