caption: The GTωA (glutaminase II) pathway. Note the involvement of two enzymes—an
  l-glutamine transaminase and ω-amidase—that are involved in the production of ammonium
  from l-glutamine. Note also the equilibrium between open-chain (ω-amidase substrate)
  and lactam forms of KGM. KGM greatly favors the lactam form. GTK and GTL are glutamine
  transaminases (see Section 3 below)
