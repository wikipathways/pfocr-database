caption: Tanshinone-targeted genes related part of the top two KEGG pathways. 1 PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway. 2 p53 signaling pathway. 3 MAPK signaling pathway. (A) Tanshinone-targeted
  genes related part of the Small cell lung cancer pathway. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway
  is involved in the process, resulting in proliferation, resistance to apoptosis
  signal, G1/S progression; (B) Tanshinone-targeted genes related part of the Pathways
  in cancer. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is involved in the process, resulting in proliferation,
  evading apopsis. (C) Tanshinone-targeted genes related part of the Chronic myeloid
  leukemia pathway. PI3K-Akt and p53 signaling pathway are involved in the process,
  resulting in proliferation, uncontrolled proliferation, G1/S progression, genomic
  instability, increased survival. (D) Tanshinone-targeted genes related part of the
  Cell cycle pathway. MAPK signaling pathway is involved in the process, resulting
  in apoptosis, S-shape proteins, CycE. (E) Tanshinone-targeted genes related part
  of the Glioma pathway, resulting in cell survival and G1/S progression.
