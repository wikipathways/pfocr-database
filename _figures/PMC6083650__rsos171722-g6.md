caption: Schematic metabolic pathway network analysis of P. harmala responses to different
  growth stages based on the findings and information obtained from the KEGG database.
  Metabolite changes are represented in bar graphs. Metabolites coloured grey are
  not detected. Single solid arrows represent one-step process, while two connected
  solid arrows represent multi-steps process. Dash line boxes with different colour
  indicate metabolism networks of particular metabolites.
