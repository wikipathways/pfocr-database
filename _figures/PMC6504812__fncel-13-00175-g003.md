caption: α-Synuclein and the modulation of lipid signaling. α-Synuclein is able to
  intervene lipid signaling by the modulation of phospholipase activities. The α-synuclein
  -induced impairment of cPLA2 and iPLA2 signaling triggers an imbalance in the AA/DHA
  ratio that finally could affect the balance of inflammation and resolution processes.
  Calcium signaling and ERK 1/2 activation are modulated by α-synuclein through PLC
  pathway impairment. α-Synuclein intervention in PLD signaling impacts on diverse
  cellular functions as vesicular trafficking, membrane curvature, and membrane protein
  targeting, lysosomal activity and PA-dependent signaling. AA, arachidonic acid;
  DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; PA, phosphatidic acid; cPLA2, calcium-sensitive cytosolic
  phospholipase A2; iPLA2, calcium-independent phospholipase A2; PLC, phospholipase
  C; PLD, phospholipase D.
