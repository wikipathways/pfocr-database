caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling is responsible for the development of all subtypes
  of hair follicles, a process that can be completely blocked by Dkk1 or Dkk2. Primary
  hair follicle formation is solely dependent on the Wnt-Eda-Shh cascade. A Dkk4-dependent
  pathway (red lines) regulates secondary hair follicle induction and differentiation,
  which is further mediated by Shh. Eda plays a modulatory role, as yet undefined
  in detail, in this process. Sox2, Sox18, Noggin and Troy may also regulate secondary
  hair follicle development, independent of Dkk4 action.
