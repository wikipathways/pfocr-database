caption: Mitochondrial fission and fusion cycles normally consist of fission mediated
  by DRP1 and fusion mediated by MFN1, MFN2 and the short and long forms (S and L)
  of OPA1. Cells that are committed to apoptosis (equated here with high levels of
  stress) use DRP1-mediated fission to promote cytochrome c release. The newly discovered
  SIMH pathway, which is induced by low levels of stress, has the opposite effect,
  namely the formation of a closed mitochondria network through the actions of MFN1
  and L-OPA1, but not MFN2 or S-OPA1, SIMH pathway confers resistance to further stress,
  but eventually cells might succumb to apoptosis.
