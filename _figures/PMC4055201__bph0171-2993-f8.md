caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the possible mechanisms responsible for CORM-2
  effects on LPS-induced VCAM-1 expression in RASFs. LPS activates a TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6/c-Src
  pathway leading to enhance two distinct signalling cascades, including NIK/IKKα/β-dependent
  activation of NF-κB and MAPKs-dependent activation of AP-1 transcription factors
  in RASFs. CORM-released CO decreased inflammatory responses by interfering with
  activation of NF-κΒ and AP-1, and expression of VCAM-1 protein, thereby suppressing
  leukoyte adhesion to RASFs.
