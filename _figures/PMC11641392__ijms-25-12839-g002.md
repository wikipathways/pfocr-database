caption: 'Overview of the Notch signaling pathway with Notch and Bcl-2 therapeutic
  targets in T-ALL. The Figure depicts the major sites of Notch receptor trafficking
  as therapeutic sites to contrast Notch signaling by affecting generation and exposition
  of a furin-cleaved heterodimer of Notch receptor on the cell-surface. Upon ligand
  binding, the HD domain of the extracellular Notch is exposed to ADAM metalloproteases
  cleavage. A sequential cleavage by the γ-secretase complex at the transmembrane
  region releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). It translocates to the nucleus,
  binds the transcription factor CSL, recruits p300, Co-A, and Maml, and activates
  target genes. To shut down the signaling, FBXW7-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation of the receptor will occur. Notch targeting can be performed at different
  levels: (1) by inhibiting receptor proteolytic cleavage by γ-secretase inhibitors;
  (2) by blocking ligand-receptor interaction with monoclonal antibodies; (3) by interfering
  with Notch receptor maturation and trafficking with SERCA inhibitors; (4) by targeting
  post-translational modification (PTM) to affect receptor functionality; (5) by epigenetic
  mechanisms to contrast Notch expression. Interactions between initiator BH3 domains
  (BAD and NOXA) and guardians (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-W, Mcl1, Bcl2A1) and sensitizer
  BH3-only proteins (BIM, PUMA, BID). The overexpression of guardian proteins enables
  cancer cells to evade apoptosis. This led to the development of BH3 mimetics that
  displace guardian-bound executioners (BAX, BAK) or initiators and promote apoptosis
  [25]. GSI treatment in combination with BH3 mimetics has been already described
  in the text. A hypothetical new combined strategy may imply SERCA inhibitors as
  a double hit to tackle T-ALL. Created in Biorender.com'
