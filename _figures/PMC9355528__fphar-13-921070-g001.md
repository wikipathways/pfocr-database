caption: Production and regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can be generated
  both by the endogenous and exogenous pathways. Endogenous pathway includes the mitochondrial
  respiratory chain and NADPH oxidase. Exogenous pathway includes hypoxia, chemotherapy,
  and radiation, among others. When oxidation is imbalanced with antioxidant systems
  will overproduce ROS. And these pathways lead to disease production, promote DNA
  damage, increase cell autophagy and apoptosis.
