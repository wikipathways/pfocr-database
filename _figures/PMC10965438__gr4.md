caption: Nanomaterials enhancing TAMs phagocytosis for the treatment of CRC via the
  CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway.(A) Do not eat me. The SIRPα receptor in macrophages
  binds to CD47 overexpressed by tumor cells and sends a “do not eat me” signal, leading
  to phagocytic resistance and immune evasion of cancer cells.(B) Nanomaterials enhancing
  TAMs phagocytosis for the treatment of CRC via the CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway.
  (1) Exo-SIRPα binds to CD47 on tumor cells, blocks the CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway,
  and enhances the tumor phagocytosis ability of macrophages. (2) SNALPssiCD47-Dox
  knocks out CD47 in tumor cells and induces ICD. ICD promotes CRT production and
  synergistically enhances TAM phagocytosis. TAMs, Tumor-associated macrophages; CRC,
  Colorectal cancer; SIRPα, Signal regulatory protein α; Exo-SIRPα, Exosomes-SIRPα;
