caption: 'Nucleic acid-sensing innate immune signalingThe nucleic acid sensing system
  plays a fundamental role in anti-viral immunity. A cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS recognizes
  DNA from DNA viruses and generate the second messenger cGAMP, which activates STING
  located on the endoplasmic reticulum. TLR9 in the endosome also recognizes virus-derived
  DNA and transmits the downstream signal through the adaptor MyD88. Notably, DNA
  released from dying tumor cells is also incorporated into intratumoral DCs and activates
  them through STING and TLR9. TLR7 and TLR8 in the endosome recognize single-stranded
  RNA (ssRNA) from RNA virus and transmits the downstream signal through the adaptor
  MyD88, whereas TLR3 in the endosome recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from
  RNA viruses and transmits the downstream signal through a different adaptor, TRIF/TICAM-1.
  Cytosolic RNA sensors, RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I and MDA5), also recognize dsRNA
  and transmit the downstream signal though the adaptor IPS-1/MAVS. Engagement of
  all these nucleic acid sensors leads to the final common pathways: the TBK1-IRF3/7
  pathway to the production of type I IFN (IFN-α/β) and the IKK-NF-κB pathway to the
  production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6. Whereas the cytosolic
  nucleic acid sensors are expressed broadly in numerous tissue types of both immune
  and non-immune origin, expression of the endosomal TLRs is largely restricted to
  antigen-presenting cells including monocytes, macrophages, DCs, and B cells. MyD88,
