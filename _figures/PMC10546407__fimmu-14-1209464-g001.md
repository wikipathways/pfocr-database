caption: 'Uremia Modulates Vasculoprotective KLF2 Expression (Graphical Abstract).
  (A) Expanded Hemodialysis Therapy (HDx) MCO Study Design and KLF2 Homeostasis: Recently,
  particular attention has been placed into lowering chronic treatment-associated
  adverse cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and new optimized treatment concepts, such
  as “Expanded Hemodialysis Therapy” with improved molecular cut-off hemodialyzers
  (7, 9, 10). Within the PERCI-II study n=48 hemodialysis patients underwent crossover
  randomized multi-center comparison employing novel medium-cut-off (MCO; MCOI-Ci400,
  Gambro) dialyzers in comparison to standard of care high-flux (HF) hemodialyzers
  (PERCI-II-MCO; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02084381) (7, 17). These novel MCO dialyzers
  have an improved molecular size cut-off, which positively modulates systemic microinflammation
  and may thus be protective to lower uremia associated endothelial dysfunction and
  organ damage (7, 17). A key factor in regulating endothelial homeostasis and inflammation
  is Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), which is the main focus of this mechanistic follow-up
  study to the PERCI-II clinical trial (7). (B) Elucidating molecular mechanisms of
  vasculoprotective KLF2 modulation by uremic serum: During the biomarker follow-up
  of the initial PERCI-II clinical trial KLF2 was identified as a potential target
  for mechanistic follow-up of the molecular signalling mechanisms underlying KLF2
  impairment by uremia associated with the conventional HF dialysis regimen, but its
  improved KLF2 maintenance or restoration with the novel improved MCO dialyzer approach.
  For the mechanistic studies, to have sufficient amounts of standardized uremic serum
  available, we compared in detailed signalling pathway analysis and concomitant blocking
  experiments the response of microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) to either healthy
  serum pools (HSP) or uremic serum pools (USP), as described in more detail in an
  earlier publication that identified TNF-signalling/triggering as a crucial mediator
  of USP activation in HMECs (7). In the current study, we first-of-all documented
  a strong impairment of KLF2 expression and concomitant pleiotropic upregulation
  of a panel of proinflammatory mediators in response to USP but not HSP, thereby
  triggering a vicious self-amplification loop to trigger the release of more inflammatory
  uremic toxins from HMECs (e.g. TNF-a, IL-6 etc). Signalling pathway analysis found
  that this was mediated by preferential engagement of map-kinase/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (MAPK/ERK) instead of protein kinase B (AKT) signalling by employing the
  respective molecular inhibitors (ERKB: PD-184352 and AKTB: MK-2206). Next, we found
  that this is mediated by modulation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and early response
  element (c-FOS) transcription factor complex (AP-1/c-FOS) signalling (Employing
  AP1B: SR-11302) and its concomitant binding to the respective promoter region in
  endothelial KLF2 gene. Importantly, the introduction of a KLF2 overexpression plasmid
  could restore physiological KLF2 levels and downmodulate the detrimental vascular
  inflammation in a mechanistic rescue approach. These findings provide new avenues
  for molecular targets and treatment modalities to reduce chronic microinflammation
  in the context of hemodialysis.'
