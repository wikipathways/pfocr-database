caption: 'Based on the expression of different special proteins, the origin and development
  of oligodendrocyte lineage cells can be subdivided into three stages: oligodendrocyte
  progenitor cells (OPCs), premyelinating oligodendrocytes and mature oligodendrocytes
  (OLs). Originating from neural stem cells, OL lineage cells begin to express PDGFRα,
  NG2 (OPCs), galactocerebroside, Oligo2 (premyelinating OLs) and, finally, mature
  myelin antigens such as MBP and PLP (proteolipid protein). The purple and yellow
  dashed lines indicate the diverse differentiation potential of OPCs, although this
  signaling pathway is still under debate.'
