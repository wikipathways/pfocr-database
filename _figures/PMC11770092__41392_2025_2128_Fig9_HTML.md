caption: Hypothetical model. The microprotein TPM3P9 encoded by lncRNA-TPM3P9, is
  a tumor-promoting protein that drives kidney cancer proliferation. TPM3P9 interacts
  with the N-terminus of the RNA-binding protein RBM4, inhibiting RBM4’s regulatory
  effect on exon 13 skipping in TCF7L2 pre-mRNA, thereby facilitating the formation
  of the TCF7L2-L variant. TCF7L2-L further binds to the transcription factor SAM68
  to promote the transcription of RELB, and thus activating the NF-κB signaling pathway
  and enhancing ccRCC cell proliferation. The diagram was edited using Adobe Illustrator
