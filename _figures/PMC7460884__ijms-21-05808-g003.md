caption: 'MCSs regulating cholesterol trafficking to the ER. (A) NPC1 appears to improve
  the kinetics of NPC2-mediated cholesterol insertion into late endosome/lysosome
  (LE/Lys)-limiting membranes, and to also participate in MCS formation through its
  interactions with ER membrane-anchored LTPs (GramD1b and oxysterol-binding protein
  (OSBP)-related protein 5 (ORP5)) that have both been shown to be essential for cholesterol
  transport. (B) ORP1L adopts a conformation that occludes its VAPA binding site in
  response to increasing levels of endosomal cholesterol. (C) Mechanisms that bypass
  NPC1 deficiency: (1) RIDα protein localized to endosomal membranes induces formation
  of ORP1L–VAPA MCSs that appear to mediate spontaneous cholesterol transfer to the
  ER following its insertion into limiting membranes by NPC2 under cholesterol-loading
  conditions. (2) The sterol-binding domain (SBD) in the ORP1L–ORD lid is dispensable
  in the RIDα pathway. (3) SBD-deleted ORP1L also reconstitutes ACAT-driven lipid
  droplet formation in NPC1-deficent cells independently of RIDα. (D) Mutations ablating
  the ORP1L FFAT (two phenylalanines (FF) in an acidic tract) binding motif inhibit
  ACAT-driven lipid droplet formation in NPC1-deficent cells with ectopic RIDα expression.
  Inset: ORP1L domain structure. PH, Pleckstrin homology; FFAT, two phenylalanines
  (FF) in an acidic tract; SBD, sterol-binding domain located in lid at entrance to
  oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related domain (ORD).'
