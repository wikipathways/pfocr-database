  Various stress stimuli, such as mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt),
  exercise, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, activate the integrated stress
  response (ISR) pathway to induce the expression of GDF15. Regulators such as heme‐regulated
  inhibitor (HRI), protein kinase R (PKR), PKR‐like ER kinase (PERK), and general
  control non‐depressible 2 (GCN2) phosphorylate eIF2α, activating ATF4 and CHOP,
  which form heterodimers to upregulate GDF15 expression [52, 53]. It has been reported
  that metformin [54] and AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) agonists (AICAR, R419,
  A769662) induce GDF15 expression through activation of the AMPK signaling pathway
  and the PERK–eIF2α–ATF3/4–CHOP axis [55]. Berberine enhances GDF15 expression via
  the PKC, ERK, and GSK3β pathways and induces ATF3 expression through P53 [56]. In
  brown adipose tissue (BAT), berberine activates pERK, initiating eIF2α phosphorylation,
  which subsequently increases ATF4, CHOP, and FGF21 expression [43]. Colchicine activates
  P62, leading to KEAP1 (Kelch‐like ECH‐associated protein 1) degradation and subsequent
  NRF2 activation, thereby stimulating GDF15 secretion [57]. Apigenin disrupts the
  binding of NRF2 to KEAP1, causing NRF2 degradation and stimulating GDF15 secretion
  [58]. GDF15 is primarily synthesized in the cytoplasm as an inactive precursor protein
  (pre‐pro‐GDF15), which is subsequently cleaved to form pro‐GDF15. The pro‐GDF15
  monomer forms pro‐GDF15 homodimers via disulfide bonds, which are then transported
  to the Golgi, where they are cleaved to form mature GDF15 dimers and secreted extracellularly.
  In certain cell types, GDF15 can also be secreted as pro‐GDF15 monomers or dimers.
  Dashed lines represent processes with unclear mechanisms [52]. Created in BioRender.
