caption: (A) The centrosome cycle is entrained with the cell cycle. Similar to the
  chromosomes, centrosomes duplicate in S-phase. Centrosome maturation, the recruitment
  of PCM and concordant increase in MTOC activity, occurs during G2 and into M-phase
  to support the elaboration of the bipolar mitotic spindle. Centrosome activity attenuates
  in late mitosis such that each centrosome that segregates to a daughter cell (G1)
  is associated with a basal level of PCM. (B) Activation of the DNA damage response
  pathway leads to centrosome dysfunction (e.g., inactivation in Drosophila embryos
  and fragmentation or amplification in mammalian cells) and triggers a block to mitotic
  entry. (C) Centrosome dysfunction can itself alter cell cycle progression. In some
  cells, a centrosome integrity checkpoint impedes interphase progression by triggering
  a G1 arrest.
