caption: Strategies to target KRAS mutations. Several therapies have been developed
  to target KRAS, namely, KRAS plasma membrane association inhibitors, KRAS synthetic
  lethal interactors, KRAS downstream signaling pathways blockade, KRAS-mediated inflammation,
  and immunotherapy. One of the most promising strategies is the novel KRAS synthetic
  lethal interactors that specifically target the cysteine in the mutated KRASG12C
  through covalent irreversible binding and favor KRAS-GDP state over GTP. These alterations
  impair RAF binding and the activation of the signaling pathway, decreasing cell
  viability and increasing apoptosis of those cells harboring KRASG12C mutations.
