caption: Iron metabolism in prostate cancer microenvironment. Prostate cancer cells
  are characterized with a differential expression of iron-related proteins compared
  to normal cells. These changes include upregulation of iron-import proteins (TFR1),
  overexpression of intracellular regulators of iron metabolism (IRP2), downregulation
  of iron export (FPN). In addition, recent data suggest that prostate cancer cells
  increase their labile iron pool by increasing the activity of hydrogen pumps and
  ferrireductases, which causes increased release of iron from endosomes. These actions
  will further increase labile iron pool. In addition, prostate cancer cells interact
  with their surroundings to increase iron delivery. This is believed to be done by
  stimulating TAMs to produce Lp2, which then binds iron and delivers it to cancer
  cells. Also, PCa cells secrete hepcidin locally to reduce their iron export through
  FPN downregulation and Lp2 to increase iron supply. Iron dymetabolism is also a
  feature of CSCs and sensescent prostate cells, whose numbers are increased in cancer.
  It is believed that iron dysregulation observed in CSCs is important for their survival
  and renewal of cancer cells. On the other hand, senescent prostate cells are known
  to secrete different molecules, some of which can directly influence the production
  of iron-related proteins by prostate cancer cells. CSC, cancer stem cell; Feph,
