caption: Schematic description of the dog cloning process via somatic cell nuclear
  transfer (SCNT), showing the descendant pedigree and phenotype of offspring. Donor
  cells were collected from a 5-year-old male German shepherd dog (original donor).
  NT refers to the cloned offspring produced via SCNT. Red colors (NT-1 and NT-2)
  were represented cloned dogs with brachygnathia inferior.
