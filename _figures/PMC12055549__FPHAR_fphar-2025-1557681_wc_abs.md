caption: Proposed signaling pathway of tetramethylpyrazine (TMPZ) in protecting against
  acute pancreatitis through inhibition of pyroptosis via the NRF2 pathway. (1) AP
  cell model was established by treating AR42J cells with 100 nM cerulein for 24 h;
  (2) TMPZ promoted translocation of NRF2 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
  and activated HO-1 protein expression; (3) NRF2 siRNA inhibited the effect of TMPZ;
  (4) TMPZ reduced pyroptosis in AP cells by modulating levels of IL-1β, IL-18, and
  expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC, and GSDMD at both mRNA and protein levels
