caption: a Virus entry routes into the central nervous system (CNS). (I) The virus
  in the bloodstream may infect the peripheral immune cells. These infected leukocytes
  may traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) composed of specialized tight junctions,
  endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. In addition, the virus may also cross
  the BBB which could be severed due to the action of the cytokines or may enter the
  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by direct interaction with the brain microvascular endothelium
  cells. Both the mechanisms result in alterations in the brain homeostasis and aggravate
  cytokine production within the CNS (II) Several viruses like HSV and influenza viruses
  are known to infect the olfactory epithelial membrane. SARS-CoV-2 may also infect
  and damage olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the epithelium lining. The damage
  may be direct or due to the production of cytokines produced by the accessory cells
  in the olfactory system. The virus may anterogradely reach the olfactory bulb through
  the cribriform plate. Finally, the virus may potentially gain entry into the CNS
  through the mitral cells along the olfactory tract. (III) Alpha herpesviruses (e.g.
  HSV-1, PRV) and polio virus (PV) along with rabies viruses (RV) may migrate to the
  CNS through the peripheral nerves. (i) Viruses may infect the mucosal epithelium
  following infection of the axonal termini of the peripheral nerves. The virus may
  spread to the spinal cord through retrograde axonal transport. (ii) Viruses infect
  the smooth muscle cells and spread through the neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) from
  muscles into the sensory/motor neurons of PNS ganglia. (IV) The gastrointestinal
  epithelium expresses ACE-2 receptors. Therefore, the cells may be easily infected
  by the virus. The virus may directly invade the enteric nervous system or indirectly
  it may prime the immune cells which may result in delayed neurological impairment.
  b SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine storm. After attachment and entry into the epithelial
  cells through ACE-2 receptor, the virus may activate the pro-inflammatory pathway
  through TLR or NF-κB signaling followed by the formation of inflammasome. Various
  pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released due to this autonomous intrinsic
  defense mechanism include CCL-2, CCL-4, CXCL-10, and IL-6. These proteins attract
  various immune cells in the circulation like the monocytes, macrophages, T cells,
  and neutrophils at the site of infection. Additionally, the situation is worsened
  by production of TNF-β, IL-6, IL-4, IL-12, and IL-23 by the T lymphocytes, which
  further accumulate the immune cells establishing a pro-inflammatory feed-back loop.
  These cytokines may damage the BBB and activate astrocytes and microglia, the CNS
  resident immune cells. In response, the activated microglia and astrocytes produce
  IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8. Elevated levels of these inflammatory cytokines can
  impart neurotoxic effects leading to neuronal dysfunction and various CNS disease–associated
  pathologies
