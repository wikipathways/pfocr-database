caption: LPS/ KLA stimulated eicosanoid metabolism and signaling pathway. The numbers
  above the arrows are reaction numbers () and default degradation reactions are not
  labeled. Black lines represent lipid metabolism and red lines indicate signaling
  pathways. Metabolites and enzymes are represented as rectangular and ovals boxes,
  respectively. The measured and unmeasured metabolites are differentiated by thick
  and thin borders, respectively. Purple color is used for eicosanoids and green for
  glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids (Reprinted with permission from Reference
