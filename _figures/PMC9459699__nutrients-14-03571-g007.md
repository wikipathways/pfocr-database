caption: Possible mechanisms implicated in the antagonistic effects of low selenite
  and SeNP supplementation on WAT homeostasis during adolescence. Selenite supplementation
  favors adipocyte maturation and fat deposition in WAT by increasing insulin secretion
  and IRS-1 expression, enhancing the insulin signaling pathway and adipogenesis.
  It also reduces LCN2, a PPARγ inhibitor, and abrogates adipogenesis arrest. As a
  hypothesis, selenite could be previously transformed into SELENOP, which when arrives
  to LRP2 and activates PPARγ. By contrast, SeNP supplementation impairs insulin secretion,
  which cannot properly activate the insulin signaling pathway and adipogenesis, despite
  high amounts of IRS-1 being expressed and adiponectin being secreted. SeNPs also
  decreased FOXO3a expression, related to lipid accumulation and inflammation in adipocytes,
  by promoting autophagy.
