caption: 'Schematic overview of the MHC-I antigen processing and presentation pathway
  in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection rs2248374-A ERAP2 expressing
  cells produce wild type ERAP2 (ERAP2-wt) which can homodimerize or heterodimerize
  with ERAP1-wt (ERAP2-wt + ERAP2-wt; ERAP1-wt + ERAP2-wt), in order to process viral
  antigens to be presented on cell surface for recognition by specific CD8+ cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte (CTL) clones. Rs2248374-G ERAP2 expressing cells may also produce an
  alternative spliced isoform: ERAP2-ISO3. This variant, unlike ERAP2-wt, lack the
  catalytic domain but can still heterodimerize with both ERAP2-wt and ERAP1-wt. As
  a result, these unconventional heterodimers (ISO3 + ERAP2-wt; ISO3 + ERAP1-wt) may
  process viral antigens differently from the canonical ones, generating an alternative
  antigenic repertoire. This in turn may activate other CTL clones possibly triggering
  a more or less protective immune system response. ER: Endoplasmic reticulum; TAP:'
