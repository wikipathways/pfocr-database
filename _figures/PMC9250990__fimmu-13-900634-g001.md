caption: Inflammatory and antimicrobial pathways in acne vulgaris. Multiple interconnected
  innate and adaptive immune pathways contribute to skin inflammation associated with
  acne. C. acnes is the pre-dominant organism in the sebaceous region of the skin.
  Dysbiosis of the skin microbiome, C. acnes colonization or a disrupted homeostasis
  can upregulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by skin-resident APCs
  such as dendritic cells, including high levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, and
  TGFβ. Cytokines such as IL-6 and TGFβ induce naive T cells to differentiate into
  effector TH17 cells, whereas IL-12 drives a TH1 differentiation program. C. acnes
  strains within the pilosebaceous unit can also influence CD4+ T cell differentiation;
  C. acnes strains-associated with healthy skin promote the differentiation of naïve
  T cells into IL-10-producing AMTH17 cells whereas acne-associated strains promote
  the development of a non-antimicrobial TH17 subpopulation (n-AMTH17). IL-8, IL-17,
  IL-26, LL-37 and TET production by immune cells within acne lesion promote neutrophil
  recruitment and increased antimicrobial activity. Expression of defensins can also
  drive antibacterial action. On the other hand, NET/TET release and formation of
  LL-37/RNA and/or IL-26/DNA complexes can activate both myeloid and plasmacytoid
  DCs leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines that further promote
  inflammation (). mtDNA can also activate the cGAS-STING pathway and production of
  type I IFNs (, ). C. acnes can also activate TLR2 receptor expression on macrophages
  and subsequent secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 secretion in an inflammasome-mediated
  fashion. IFN-γ release by TH1 cells further drives the inflammatory responses within
  acne lesions. In addition, proinflammatory conditions exist when IFN-γ-producing
  TH1 cells are exposed to TNF-α and IL-12. APC, Antigen presenting cell; TGFβ, Transforming
  growth factor- Beta; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cell; IFN-γ, Interferon gamma;
