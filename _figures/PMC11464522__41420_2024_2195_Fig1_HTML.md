caption: 'The conversion of PUFAs to PL-PUFAs can be mediated by ACSL4 and LPCAT3.
  PL-PUFAs can be easily converted to PL-PUFA-OOH through various pathways, which
  can cause lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Extracellular Fe3+ enters the cell
  by binding to TF and undergoes reduction or ferritinophagy, ultimately converting
  into Fe2+ and forming the LIP. When LIP becomes overloaded with iron, it becomes
  prone to a Fenton reaction, facilitating lipid peroxidation and thereby triggering
  ferroptosis. The cysteine transported into cells by SLC7A11 can be converted into
  cystine, which is an essential component of GSH. GSH, mediated by GPX4, can be transformed
  into GSSG while reducing PL-PUFA-OOH to PL-PUFA-OH, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis.
