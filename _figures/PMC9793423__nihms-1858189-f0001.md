caption: Structure of LIFR and its interaction with LIF ligand. (A) LIFR is composed
  of 8 different domains, and these domains were sub-classified as the extracellular
  domain (789 amino acids) containing two cytokine binding module/domain (CBM) separated
  by Ig-like domains which subsequently trailed by 3 fibronectin type III domains,
  transmembrane domain (26 amino acids, and intracellular domain (238 amino acids).
  (B) Snapshot of holo complex and heterodimerization of IL6 family ligands and their
  interaction with LIFR-gp130 in cancer cells. The IL-6 family of ligands (LIF, oncostatin
  M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic growth factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1, and cardiotrophin-like
  cytokine (CLC))) bind to LIFR and subsequently dimerize with co-receptor glycoprotein
  130 (gp130) to form tertiary complex and signals through JAK/STAT pathway. Interleukin-like
  EMT inducer (ILEI) a cytokine from the FAM3 family, also functions as a ligand for
  LIFR-gp130 heterodimer and mediates intracellular signal through STAT activation.
