caption: A. The PI3K pathway is activated by signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases.
  PI3K is composed of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit. Regulatory
  subunits are expressed by variants of the PIK3R1—3 genes. Catalytic subunits are
  expressed by PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and PIK2CD genes. PI3K phosphorylates and actives AKT.
  AKT1 and AKT2 are isoforms of AKT, which activates mTOR, a protein kinase that regulates
  many cell functions such as cell growth, proliferation, motility, and survival.
  PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that negatively regulates the PI3K pathway. B. The
  MAPK/ERK pathway is activated by the cell surface receptor, EGFR. EGFR activates
  the small GTPase, RAS. The RAS family includes HRAS, KRAS and NRAS. RAS in turn
  activates RAF kinases, including ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF, which activate MAP2K, a kinase
  enzyme encoded by seven genes, MAP2K1—7. MAP2K phosphorylates MAPK, a protein kinase
  involved in many signaling cascades.
