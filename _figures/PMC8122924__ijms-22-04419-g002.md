caption: Illustration of the intracellular signaling pathways affected by lipin-1
  silencing in cancer cells. In (1), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is no longer
  stabilized by lipin-1 leading to an inhibition of Raf-1 and of its downstream targets
  including c-fos and AP-1. Lipin-1 silencing altered phospholipids synthesis (2).
  This activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and leads to endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress. The increased concentration of phosphatidic acid (PA) due
  to the lack of lipin-1 activity can activate RhoA and inhibits cell migration (3).
  Lipin-1 depletion enhanced autophagy initiation, as indicated by enhanced LC3 and
  ULK phosphorylation, while a blockage of autophagosome maturation was observed,
  likely related to a lack of diacylglycerol (DAG). This leads to autophagosome accumulation
  (4). The precise contribution of lipin-1 transcriptional regulator activity to cancer
  cell phenotype has not yet been specifically addressed (5).
