caption: 'Main targets of RhoA and ROCK, involved in organization of the cytoskeleton.
  Arrows carrying a stop sign symbolize inactivation; arrows without a stop sign indicate
  activation. Molecules attached to numbered arrows lead to the following effects:
  1 = decreased depolymerization of actin filaments; 2 = stress fiber formation and
  increased contractility; 3 = actin polymerization regulation → contractile ring
  → cytokinesis; 4 = also involved in formation of contractile ring → cytokinesis;
  5 = disrupted actin binding activity/signaling mainly unknown so far; 6 = actin-cytoskeletal
  reorganization; 7 = assembly of actin filaments (spectrin-actin meshwork beneath
  plasma membranes); 8 = actin organization and focal adhesions; 9 = disruption of
  intermediate filaments. ? = pathway that is not yet known; P = phosphorylated molecule;
  RhoA = Ras homology gene family member A; ROCK = Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing
  protein kinase; CitK = citron kinase; mDia = mammalian diaphanous; CPI-17 = protein
