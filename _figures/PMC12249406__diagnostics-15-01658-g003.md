caption: Mechanism of action of anti-tumor necrosis factor (Anti-TNF) agents. Anti-TNF
  agents selectively bind to TNF-α, inhibiting its interaction with TNFR1 (p55) and
  thereby preventing the activation of NF-kB, MAPK, and apoptotic pathways. Additionally,
  they block TNF-α from binding to TNFR2 (p75), leading to a significant increase
  in Treg cells, which can produce TGF-β, contributing to immune regulation and granuloma
  formation
