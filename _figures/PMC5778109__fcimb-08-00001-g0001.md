caption: IFN-γ-tryptophan-kynurenine and indole pathways. IFN-γ induces IDO1 levels,
  which catabolizes tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway. Tryptophan depletion
  and high levels of kynurenine down-regulates IFN-γ activity. Chlamydial tryptophan
  synthase gene (trpBA) converts available indole back to tryptophan, as well as other
  vaginal tract bacterial trpBA. Indole-producing bacteria can synthesis indole from
  tryptophan using tnaA gene. Tryptophan can be accumulated in the epithelial cell
  in many ways, such as through diet, cell degradation and microbial source.
