caption: This figure shows the IPA canonical TREM1 signaling pathway. TREM1 is an
  important signaling receptor that plays role in systemic infections, inflammation,
  neurological development and coagulation. Seven genes involved in TREM-1 signaling
  pathways were modified with exposure to COVID-19, red filled path designer shapes
  are upregulated genes and green filled path designer shapes are downregulated genes.
