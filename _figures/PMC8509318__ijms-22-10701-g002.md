caption: The importance of MAPK cascades for the HIF-1 activation pathway. During
  chronic hypoxia, MAPK cascades, in particular ERK MAPK and p38 MAPK, are activated
  by ROS and increased calcium ions. These kinases cause phosphorylation of HIF-1α
  and consequently increase the stability and transcriptional activity of HIF-1. p38
  MAPK can also cause the activation of SIAH2, which results in the ubiquitination
  and degradation of PHD3. Important in this model of HIF-1 activation are also phosphatases,
  in particular DUSP1 and DUSP2—enzymes that catalyze a reaction reverse to ERK MAPK
  and p38 MAPK. In chronic hypoxia, there is a decrease in DUSP2 expression but an
  increase in DUSP1, which is a mechanism for regulating HIF-1 activation.
