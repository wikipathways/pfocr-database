caption: The figure was obtained using Pathway Studio . The program received as input
  the 50-probes displayed in  and automatically searched all the known putative common
  regulators relationships. The highlighted proteins are the 5-protein signature (IL1-
  α, TNF-α, IL-3, EGF and GCSF) of . We have also highlighted IL-6 (discussed in  in
  the context of results of classifiers that also use it) and CSF1, Colony-stimulating
  factor 1, (macrophage).
