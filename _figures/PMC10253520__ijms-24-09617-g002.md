caption: 'Galectin-3 in Viral Infections: A Comprehensive Overview. This figure depicts
  the intricate interplay between Galectin-3 (Gal-3), viral particles, and host cells
  during viral infections, emphasizing the activation of the Nuclear Factor Kappa
  B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Viral particles interacting with Gal-3 on the host
  cell surface trigger various intracellular signaling pathways, including the NF-κB
  pathway. Normally, the inactive NF-κB complex—comprising RelA (p65), p50, and IκBα—is
  confined to the cytoplasm. The viral–Gal-3 interaction activates IκB kinase (IKK),
  which then phosphorylates IκBα. This phosphorylation signals IκBα for ubiquitination
  and subsequent proteasomal degradation, revealing the nuclear localization signal
  of the NF-κB dimer (RelA/p50), which translocates to the nucleus. Here, the NF-κB
  dimer binds to κB sites on DNA, thereby regulating the transcription of target genes
  with assistance from coactivators. This activity leads to diverse cellular responses,
  including immune response and inflammation. Concurrently, the figure illustrates
  immune cells, such as macrophages and T-cells, migrating towards the host cell in
  response to the Gal-3–virus interaction, underlining their essential roles in the
  immune response. Key components involved in this context include Nuclear Factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB), Receptor Enhancer of Nuclear Factor Kappa-B Ligand A (RelA), Inhibitor
  of Nuclear Factor Kappa-B Alpha (IκBα), NF-kappa-B p50 subunit (p50), I kappa B
  kinase (IKK), and Galectin-3 (Gal-3)'
