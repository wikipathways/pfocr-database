caption: Metabolic pathway disruptions induced by cadmium exposure and their impact
  on neurotoxicity and metabolic health. This figure illustrates the role of cadmium
  (Cd) exposure in disrupting key metabolic pathways, with a focus on its neurotoxic
  effects and adverse impacts on metabolic health. Cd exposure leads to significant
  alterations in the Krebs cycle, affecting amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan,
  asparagine, arginine, and histidine, which play essential roles in cellular energy
  production and metabolism. These disruptions may impair cellular respiration and
  metabolic efficiency, ultimately influencing overall energy balance. Cd also exerts
  toxic effects on the tryptophan–kynurenine pathway, redirecting tryptophan metabolism
  towards increased production of neurotoxic metabolites like quinolinic acid, while
  reducing levels of neuroprotective metabolites such as kynurenic acid. This imbalance
  can contribute to neurotoxicity, as quinolinic acid is associated with neuroinflammatory
  and excitotoxic effects. The pathway’s altered metabolite profile reflects Cd’s
  neurotoxic potential, which poses risks to neural health and cognitive function.
  In the urea cycle, Cd exposure impacts the body’s ability to detoxify ammonia, leading
  to an increase in urea levels. Disruptions in the urea cycle also affect nitric
  oxide synthesis, potentially compromising vascular and immune functions. Cd further
  interferes with histamine metabolism by disrupting the conversion of histidine to
  histamine. This disturbance is partially attributed to Cd’s interference with essential
  metals like magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn), which are critical for immune response
  regulation. Reduced histamine levels may impair immune response, increasing susceptibility
  to infections and inflammatory diseases. Lastly, Cd exposure has significant effects
  on lipid metabolism, particularly through disruptions in sphingolipid and ceramide
  pathways. Elevated levels of sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide are associated with
  insulin resistance and T2DM, suggesting that Cd exposure may contribute to metabolic
  disorders. By affecting multiple pathways, Cd exposure not only increases neurotoxic
  risk but also interferes with metabolic processes that are crucial for maintaining
  health. This figure underscores Cd’s pervasive impact on metabolic and immune health,
  highlighting the importance of mitigating exposure to this toxic metal
