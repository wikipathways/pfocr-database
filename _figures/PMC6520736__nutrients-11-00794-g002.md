caption: The insulin signaling pathway under physiological condition. Insulin action
  is initiated via its binding to insulin receptor (IR). The activation of IR contributes
  to the dimerization of the receptor and generation of the heterotetrameric form.
  Autophosphorylation of IR leads to the formation of numerous phosphotyrosine residues
  which are potential docking sites for the component of other signaling pathways
  []. The recruitment and phosphorylation of numerous substrate proteins, including
  insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, are allowed via multiple phosphotyrosines
  []. Phosphorylated IRSs activate and translocate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)
  to the plasma membrane, and PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate
  (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-biphosphate (PIP3)—a key lipid signaling molecule.
  The level of PIP3 is under control of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and
  SH2-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase-2 (SHIP2) that perform PIP3 dephosphorylation
  []. Insulin-mediated elevation of PIP3 level induces serine threonine kinase PDK1
  (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1), thus leading to the phosphorylation
  and activation of protein kinase C (PKC ζ/λ) and protein kinase B (PKB also known
  as AKT). One of their actions is the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)
  to cell membrane and, in consequence, the elevation of glucose uptake []. AKT also
  stimulates synthesis of protein, glycogenesis, and lipogenesis, but represses lipolysis,
  glucogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and proteolysis [].
