caption: Regulatory mechanism of expression of DNA damage response genes by the checkpoint
  pathway. Upon the phosphorylation of Dun1p by the checkpoint pathway, Crt1p in the
  repressor complex bound to the promoter region of damage-inducible genes is phosphorylated.
  This leads to the dissociation of the repressor complex from the promoter to induce
  the expression of target genes
