caption: NLRP3 activation triggers the inflammatory pathway of atherosclerosis in
  monocytes and macrophages resident cells. The ischemic insult due to ischemia and
  reperfusion after acute myocadial infarction activates the inflammatory pathway
  mediated by NLRP3. ROS—reactive oxygen species; NLRP3 - nucleotide-binding and oligomerization-like
  receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3; IL—interleukin; SAA—serum amyloid A;
  CRP—C-reactive protein; TNF-alpha—tumour necrosis factor—alpha; PAI-1—plasminogen
  activator inhibitor type 1. NLRP3 inflammasome is a common inflammatory platform
  where many stimuli (e.g., cholesterol crystals, ischemic conditions) can activate
  IL-1beta triggering the inflammatory pathway, including IL-6. The activation of
  IL-1beta reduces contractility in response to beta adrenergic stimuli and is associated
  with ventricular remodeling. Further, increase in CRP levels can be used for monitoring
  of the low-grade inflammation.
