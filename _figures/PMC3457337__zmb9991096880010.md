caption: Schematic view of possible role of Scly in glucose and lipid metabolism in
  the liver. Scly decomposes Sec (yellow circles) obtained from selenoprotein degradation
  into alanine (ala) and the Se form selenide. This Se will reenter the selenoprotein
  synthesis pathway by the action of SPS enzymes. Selenoproteins are mostly involved
  in cell detoxification reactions, such as breakdown of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
  Oxidative status influences the activity of insulin signaling inhibitor protein
  PTP1B, a phosphatase that disrupts the insulin signaling cascade by dephosphorylating
  the insulin receptor (IR) and its substrate (IRS). This results in attenuation of
  downstream events regulated by Akt, such as gene transcription, glucose uptake,
  and lipogenesis. Se from Scly activity regulates PTP1B levels (dashed arrow), favoring
  the negative regulation of insulin signaling.
