caption: The biosynthesis pathways of isoprenoids and the biosensors that are responsive
  to isoprenoids and their precursors. (a) The mevalonate (MVA)-responsive biosensors.
  The MVA auxotroph strain survived only when the MVA was supplied. Otherwise, the
  absence of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) will
  cause growth defects. The AraC variant AraC-mev was able to inhibit the corresponding
  promoter and can be depressed by MVA. (b) The IPP-responsive biosensor. The engineered
  AraC was coupled with Idi enzyme and can activate the transcription of the corresponding
  promoter. The activation process was inhibited by IPP. The downstream MutD5 is a
  mutator; when the mutations which enhance IPP supply were generated, the expression
  of the mutator will be inhibited. (c) The farnesyl diphosphate (FPP)-responsive
  biosensors. PgadE was identified to be inhibited by FPP, while PyrbL and PrstA were
  identified to be activated by FPP. These biosensors have been applied to regulate
  the MVA pathways and screen for high producers. (d) The geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  (GGPP)-responsive biosensor. crtR is a repressor to the corresponding promoter and
  can be released with the binding of GGPP. This biosensor has the potential to regulate
  downstream carotenoid biosynthesis. (e) The Isoprene-responsive biosensor. TubT
  activates the transcription of the corresponding promoter with the binding of isoprene.
  (f) Bicyclic monoterpenes-responsive biosensor. The transcriptional repressor CamR
  was engineered to respond to some bicyclic monoterpenes. G-3-P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  PYR, pyruvate
