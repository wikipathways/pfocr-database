caption: 'JAK2 mutations in hematological malignancies. (A) Model of JAK2 JH2-JH1
  interface showing the positions of known activating JAK2 mutations. The JAK2 JH2-JH1
  model was generated by  using molecular dynamics simulations and annotated using
  ChimeraX-1.2.5 (University of California). The JH2 (pseudokinase domain) N-terminal
  (residues 536–629) and C-terminal (residues 630–839) lobe are colored in light blue
  and green respectively. The JH1 (kinase domain) N-terminal (residues 840–931) and
  C-terminal (932–1,132) lobes are colored in pink and purple respectively. Residues
  that when mutated are known to be activating are shown as red spheres (α carbon).
  Two critical inhibitory phosphorylation sites, pS523 and pY570, are encircled. Other
  key residues predicted to be involved in activating JAK2 mechanisms are colored
  in red and presented with amino acid side chains shown. Proposed interactions are
  represented by dashed lines. Figure adapted from , ,  and . (B) Schematic representation
  of JAK/STAT signaling pathway activation through mutant-JAK2. CRLF2 (dark grey)
  heterodimerizes with IL-7Rα (light grey) to form the cytokine receptor for TSLP.
  The JAK2 FERM and SH2-like domains associate with the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane
  motifs of the receptor to recruit JAK2 to the cell membrane. The four domains of
  JAK2 are presented: FERM (green), SH2-like (orange), pseudokinase (JH2, purple),
  and kinase (JH1, blue). JAK2 is shown bound to ATP (black). The proposed model of
  mutant-JAK2 activation suggests that mutations such as JAK2 p. R683G (represented
  by a yellow sphere) disrupt the JH2-mediated autoinhibitory interaction with the
  kinase domain. This shifts the equilibrium of JAK2 from the inactive, auto-inhibited
  state towards the partially active state, supporting mutant-JAK2 dimerisation. Although
  mutant-JAK2 alone remains dependent on cytokine binding, additional mechanisms such
  as receptor overexpression may promote malignant transformation. Adapted from “Cytokine
  Signaling through the JAK-STAT Pathway” (BioRender.com, 2021).'
