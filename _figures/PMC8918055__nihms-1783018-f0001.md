caption: Dichotomous role of endothelial SR-BI as a transporter of both HDL and LDL.
  a Circulating HDL binds to SR-BI on the luminal surface of endothelial cells, and
  HDL-SR-BI complex is transported via a vesicular trafficking pathway. VEGF-VEGFR2
  signaling promotes HDL transport by upregulating plasma membrane SR-BI. HDL is then
  released in the interstitial space, where it is further delivered to the lymphatic
  system through lymphatic endothelial cells in an SR-BI-dependent manner, as a critical
  step of the reverse cholesterol transport. b SR-BI facilitates internalization of
  LDL in a dynamin-dependent manner. LDL binding to SR-BI recruits DOCK4 to the C-terminal
  cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, which in turn promotes LDL internalization by
  Rac activation. Estrogen binding to GPER negatively regulates LDL transcytosis through
  downregulation of SR-BI. LDL-SR-BI complex is transported across endothelium to
  be released in the sub-intimal space, where it is engulfed by macrophages to contribute
  to atherogenesis
