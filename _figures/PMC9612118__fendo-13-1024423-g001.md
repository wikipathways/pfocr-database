caption: The cAMP-signaling pathway. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large
  family of 7-helix transmembrane proteins that are the physiological receptors for
  circulating hormones (e.g., TSH, ACTH, FSH, and LH, among many others) and neurotransmitters
  that bind to their extracellular regions (the plasma membrane is indicated by the
  pair of curved lines). Orphan GPCRs (e.g., that encoded by GPR101), encode GPCRs
  for which the physiologic ligand has yet to be determined. GPCRs interact with trimeric
  G-proteins by recruiting them to specific regions on their intracellular loops.
  G-proteins have three subunits (α, β, or γ) and the members of the α family can
  be divided into stimulatory (Gαs) or inhibitory (Gαi) isoforms (e.g., GNAS is one
  of several genes encoding Gαs isoforms). Gα and/or Gβγ bind to, and regulate, one
  of several downstream effectors, including membrane-associated adenylyl cyclase,
  which catalyzes the synthesis of cAMP from ATP. cAMP is a soluble “second messenger”
  that can diffuse widely in cells. cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs) catalyze the hydrolysis
  (breakdown) of cAMP and thereby play a central in regulating cAMP signaling in cells.
  cAMP can activate several targets, including the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein
  kinase A, PKA), EPAC, Popeye proteins and ion channels. The PKA holoenzyme is a
  tetramer of 2 catalytic subunits (C-subunits, Cα or Cβ), and 2 regulatory subunits
  (R-subunits, RIα, RIβ RIIα or RIIβ). The subcellular localization of PKA is determined
  by its binding to A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). In the inactive PKA holoenzyme,
  the R-subunits bind tightly to the C-subunits and inhibit their activity. cAMP activates
  PKA by binding to the R-domains, producing a conformational change that activates
  the C-domains. PKA is a serine-threonine protein kinase that can phosphorylate numerous
  substrates, depending on the specific cell type and subcellular location. The cAMP-responsive
  element binding protein (CREB) is an important substrate and downstream target of
  PKA; it regulates the transcription of numerous genes. The oncoprotein BRAF is regulated
  in part by PKA, as well as other signaling proteins, such as RAS proteins and tyrosine-protein
  kinases.
