caption: Tissue‐specific function of Blimp‐1 expression in dendritic cells. In peripheral
  lymphoid organs, Blimp‐1 expression in cDCs regulates follicular helper T (Tfh)
  cell expansion and antigenic specificity. Together with Irf4, Blimp‐1 regulates
  peptides which are presented on major histocompatibility class II (MHC II) through
  the expression of Cathepsin S. Blimp‐1 expression also negatively regulates IL‐6
  which is required for Tfh cell differentiation. Therefore, low levels of Blimp‐1
  in DCs lead to an increase in Tfh cell differentiation, and autoreactive B cell
  activation in germinal centers. Blimp‐1 expression is also necessary in tissue‐resident
  DCs. Absence of Blimp‐1 in intestinal DCs leads to a hyperactivation of the NOD2
  signal pathway. This abnormal response generates increased IL‐1β and IL‐6 production,
  and subsequently induces increased matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) from neighboring
  tissue macrophages. DC, dendritic cell; IL‐6, interleukin‐6.
