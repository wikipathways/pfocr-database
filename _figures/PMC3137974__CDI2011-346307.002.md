caption: Epithelial cell recognition of C. albicans. Epithelial cells recognise C.
  albicans via a two-step process []. Initial recognition of yeast by surface PRRs
  results in prolonged activation of NF-kB and an early transient activation of MAPK
  signalling leading to activation of c-Jun through the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways. When
  the burden of hyphae passes a threshold, recognition of these hyphae triggers a
  second, prolonged activation of MAPK signalling. This results in activation of MKP1
  through the ERK1/2 pathway and c-Fos via p38 signalling. NF-κB and c-Fos then play
  essential roles in the transcription of cytokines secreted by the epithelial cells,
  whilst MKP1 acts as a negative regulator to control the activation of JNK and p38
  signalling.
