caption: In the presence of simultaneously elevated levels of glucose and fatty-acid
  (FA), the increase in cytosolic malonyl-CoA resulting from glucose metabolism inhibits
  the enzyme carnitine-palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1). Transport of long-chain acyl-CoA
  (LC-CoA) in the mitochondria is reduced, and the esterification pathway is preferentially
  activated, leading to cytosolic accumulation of lipid-derived signaling molecules
  such as ceramide, diglycerides (DG), phosphatidic acid (PA), phospholipids (PL),
  and triglycerides (TG).
