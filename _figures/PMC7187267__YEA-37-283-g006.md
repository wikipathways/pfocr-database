caption: Nicotinic acid de novo synthesis and salvage pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
  NAD+ is de novo synthesized from L‐tryptophan in nine catalytic steps involving
  the Bna enzyme family and enzymes Nma1, Nma2, and Qns1. Nicotinic acid can be imported
  into the cell via Tna1 and enters the NAD synthesis pathway as NaMN by catalytic
  activity of Npt1. Similarly, NaR can be salvaged by catalytic activity of Nrk1 to
  form NaMN. NaR can be also converted to nicotinic acid by Urh1 and Pnp1. Nrk1 also
  converts NR into NMN subsequently converted to NAD+ by Nma1 and Nma2. NR is imported
  by activity of Nrt1 transporter and might be used by Pnp1 or Urh1 to form nicotinamide.
  Alternatively, nicotinamide can be synthesized via Sir2 from NAD+. Pnc1 uses nicotinamide
  to form nicotinic acid. The regulators Hst1 (with aid of Rfm1 and Sum1) and Mac1
  repress the expression of genes encoding Bna enzymes upon binding to NAD+ and nicotinic
  acid. Metabolites, proteins and negative regulators are shown in bold, blue and
  red respectively. NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NaMN, nicotinic acid
  mononucleotide; NAR, nicotinamide riboside; NMN, nicotinamide nucleotide; NR, nicotinamide
  riboside [Colour figure can be viewed at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com]
