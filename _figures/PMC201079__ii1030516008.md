caption: Schematic diagram showing the signaling pathways involved in NTHI-induced
  IL-8 transcription. The small cytoplasmic molecules (○) released from lysed NTHI
  cells activate p38 and ERK MAP kinase pathways, and probably NF-κB through the ERK
  pathway, leading to IL-8 expression (▵). High levels of IL-8 secreted by epithelial
  cells cause massive infiltration and activation of neutrophils in infected tissue,
  resulting in neutrophil-mediated tissue destruction. The PI3K-Akt pathway of epithelial
  cells is also activated due to interaction of IL-8 with receptor, which may account
  for other epithelial responses to NTHI infection.
