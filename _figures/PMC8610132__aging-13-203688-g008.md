caption: Schematic diagram of roles of miR-6745-TIMP1 axis on Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  and its function in gastric tumorigenesis. Under normal non-transformed conditions,
  miR-6745 binds to the 3-UTR in the TIMP1 mRNA and down-regulates TIMP1 protein levels.
  In GC, there is reduced levels of miR-6745 leading to elevated TIMP1 expression
  and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
