caption: 'The influence of alcohol consumption on one-carbon metabolism. A schematic
  representation of the impact of ethanol on the main components of one-carbon metabolism
  (1CM) consists of three interlinked modules, folate and methionine cycles, and the
  transsulfuration pathway. Ethanol decreases the bioavailability of folate, a crucial
  “fuel” in 1CM. This is thought to occur by reducing the uptake of dietary folate
  and inhibiting enzymes involved in the folate cycle [,,]. Ethanol inhibits methionine
  synthase (MS/MTR) [] causing hyperhomocysteinemia and disrupts the production of
  S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), a global methyl donor. Ethanol may also lower SAM production
  in a more direct manner by inhibiting methionine S-adenosyltransferase (MAT). DNA
  methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTs) can also be inhibited
  by ethanol to result in DNA and histone hypomethylation, which would affect gene
  regulation and expression. This would have a resultant effect on decreasing cellular
  glutathione levels, augmented by the inhibitory effects of ethanol on cystathionine-β-synthase
  (CBS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase L (CGL) indicated with red arrow. The resulting
  elevated levels of ROS and RNS would increase the oxidative and nitrosative damage,
  further diverting 1CM away from SAM production to augment hypomethylation []. Genetic
  polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) can alter THF production
  []. Alcohol consumption can decrease THF production by inhibiting MTHFR []. Enzymes
  are shown in green text and metabolites in black text. DHF: dihydrofolate, THF:
