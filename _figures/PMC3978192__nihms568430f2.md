caption: '(A) Hepcidin regulation by extracellular iron. The BMP/Smad pathway is central
  to the transcriptional regulation of hepcidin expression. The BMP pathway signaling
  is further modulated by hemojuvelin (HJV), a BMP co-receptor. The sensing of holotransferrin
  is proposed to occur through the following mechanism: binding of holo-transferrin
  (Fe-Tf) to TfR1 displaces HFE from the complex with TfR1 and promotes its interaction
  with TfR2. TfR2 protein is itself stabilized by the binding of Fe-Tf. The HFE/TfR2
  may promote BMP signaling by forming a complex with HJV, or even acting independently
  of HJV or each other. Additional proteins (TMPRSS6/matriptase-2 (MT2) and neogenin)
  modulate the cleavage of membrane HJV and thus alter hepcidin transcription. (B)
  Hepcidin regulation by inflammation. IL-6 and other cytokines (e.g. oncostatin M,
  IL-22) were shown to regulate hepcidin expression by activating the Stat3 pathway.
  Activin B acting via BMP receptors and the Smad1/5/8 pathway was also proposed to
  stimulate hepcidin expression during inflammation.'
