caption: Key signaling events underlying D-lactate-induced metabolic reprogramming
  in bFLS. D-lactate enters bovine fibroblast-like synoviocytes (bFLS) through MCT-1
  and induces the activation of the PI3K/Akt, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 MAPK pathways, and
  the subsequent activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and HIF-1. Through
  these signaling pathways and transcription factors, D-lactate induces the synthesis
  and secretion of IL-6, an inflammatory marker characteristic of bovine polysynovitis
  associated with D-lactic acidosis. Additionally, the local inflammatory response
  is sustained thanks to the activation of HIF-1, which favors glycolytic metabolism
  by increasing the expression of GLUT1 (which increases the incorporation of glucose
  from the extracellular medium), PDK1 (blocking the mitochondrial use of pyruvate
  through the TCA cycle) and LDHA (ensuring glycolytic flux by favoring the oxidation
  of pyruvate to lactate). IL-6, interleukin 6; MCT1, monocarboxylate transporter
  1; GLUT1, solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter) member 1; PI3K,
  phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; p38, p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK); ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 MAPK; HIF-1α
  and HIF-1β, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha and beta subunits, respectively; NF-κB,
  nuclear factor kappa B; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A subunit; PDK1, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase 1; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid. Figure created with
