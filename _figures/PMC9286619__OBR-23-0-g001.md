caption: 'Summary of putative testosterone signaling mechanisms. DNA‐binding dependent
  signaling (1) occurs via diffusion of testosterone (T) across the cell membrane
  where it binds directly to the androgen receptor (AR) or is converted by 5α reductase
  to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which also binds to the AR. The androgen/AR complex
  translocates to the nucleus where it binds to androgen response elements to activate
  or repress the transcription of target genes. T can also be converted to estradiol
  (E2) by the enzyme aromatase and mediate its actions following binding to estrogen
  receptors (ER). Examples of non‐DNA binding‐dependent AR signaling pathways are
  depicted: (2) testosterone activation of ionotropic receptors such as transient
  receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) to enable influx of calcium or sodium, ,
  ; (3) testosterone can bind membrane‐bound g protein coupled receptors (GPCR) to
  activate several canonical GPCR signaling pathways including phospholipase C‐mediated
  signaling, which regulates calcium levels, ; (4) testosterone activation of membrane‐associated
  AR which binds to Src and activates the mitogen associated protein (MAP) kinase
  pathway via transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); and
  (5) via non‐EGFR signaling'
