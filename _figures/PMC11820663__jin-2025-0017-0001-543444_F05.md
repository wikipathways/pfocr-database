caption: Mechanism of cellular pyroptosis (by Figdraw). One of them is the classical
  inflammasome pathway under the stimulation of a variety of pathogenic microorganisms,
  and the body detects pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated
  molecular patterns and recruits the assembly of inflammasome NLRP3, which then starts
  to recruit and activate the precursor of caspase-1 under the mediating effect of
  articulin ASC to become the mature, shear-functioning effector protein caspase-1.
  Then, caspase-1 cuts off the C-terminal end of GSDMD, a key protein for pyroptosis,
  and only the remaining GSDMD-N-terminal end has a pore-forming effect, which eventually
  localizes on the plasma membrane to form a plasma membrane pore, allowing the release
  of cellular contents. The second is the nonclassical inflammatory vesicle pathway,
  which is mediated by LPS, a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria, to form
  mature active caspase-11/4/5, which functions to cleave GSDMD. In addition to different
  effector protein caspases, the classical pathway process releases large amounts
  of inflammatory factors IL-1β and IL-18, which accelerate the inflammatory response
