caption: Illustration of aptamer involvement in cancer immunotherapy. (A) Two most
  crucial (most known) immune checkpoints. (B) Antagonistic aptamers, selected against
  either receptor or ligand, inhibit their interaction. Therefore, the downstream
  pathway is not triggered. Agonistic aptamers dimerize receptor dimers that result
  in switching on respective signaling. (C) Selected immune system receptors that
  have already been targeted by aptamers. (D) Whereas standard approaches use aptamers
  as targeting agents to deliver therapeutic cargo to cells, aptamer-engineered NK
  cells are directed by cell-membrane-embedded aptamers to lymphoma cells.
