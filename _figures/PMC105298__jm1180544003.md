caption: Potential biosynthetic pathway of GDP-colitose () with gene names. The pathway
  commences with d-mannose-6-phosphate, which is converted from fructose-6-phosphate
  by the phosphomannose isomerase encoded by manA. The manA gene is located outside
  the O-antigen gene cluster (). Genes assigned to each step are based on sequence
  similarity described in the text. Pyr, pyridoxamine.
