caption: CAT has anti-osteoporotic effects through other pathways. Among them, CAT
  is involved in the mechanism research of regulating the course of osteoporosis through
  various pathways such as antioxidative stress injury, bone repair, antioxidant glucose
  deprivation injury, regulation of immune cell polarization, and promotion of osteogenesis-angiogenesis
  coupling
