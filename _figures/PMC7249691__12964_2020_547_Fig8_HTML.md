caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the different in canonical versus non-canonical
  response to IL-12. a The canonical IL-12 pathway is triggered by (1) ligand-mediated
  heterodimerization of the receptor subunits IL12RB1 and IL12RB2. (2) Formation of
  the receptor complex promotes the phosphorylation of receptor associated kinases
  JAK2 and TYK2 and of a signal transducer binding site on the cytoplasmic tail of
  IL12RB2. (3) Phosphorylation of this IL12RB2 binding site attracts STAT4 that is
  subsequently phosphorylated by JAK2. (4) Phosphorylated STAT4 dimerizes and translocates
  into the nucleus to initiate STAT4-mediated transcription that promotes cell proliferation
  and Interferon-gamma production. b The non-canonical IL-12 pathway is triggered
  by (1) IL-12-enhanced homodimerization of IL12RB2 subunits. (2) Homodimerization
  of IL12RB2 activates the JAK2 receptor associated kinases, which in turn (3) recruit
  and activate PI3K via the p85a subunit. (4) Activated PI3K then phosphorylates Thr308-primed
  Akt at the Ser 472/473 loci, which engages the canonical Akt response that includes
  enhanced survival
