caption: Canonical and non-canonical STAT3 signaling. Binding of ligands such as cytokines
  and growth factors to their cognate receptors stimulate receptor dimerization and
  recruitment of Janus kinase (JAK). JAK phosphorylates the cytoplasmic tails of the
  receptor to create a docking site for STAT3. In the canonical pathway, STAT3 is
  phosphorylated at the Tyr705 residue and form homodimers or STAT3:STAT1 heterodimers
  that modulate gene expression in the nucleus. Maximal transcriptional activation
  can also be induced by the non-canonical activation of STAT3 via phosphorylation
  at the Ser727 residue. p-Ser727 STAT3 can then translocate to the mitochondria to
  regulate the electron transport chain (ETC) and production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS).
