caption: Eph and Notch receptors are asymmetrically distributed from their ligands
  at cell-cell contacts. Activation of both of these receptors can promote actin reorganization
  generating the tension needed to form separate clusters as suggested by the DITH.
  Also, ADAM metalloproteases can modulate these signaling pathways by cleaving ephrin
  and Notch extracellular domains. Reverse signaling through ephrin-Bs activate a
  JAK2/STAT/JNK pathway and inhibit cadherin-dependent adhesion strength resulting
  in tissue separation as proposed by the DAH. Initiation of Notch signaling causes
  cleavage of the intracellular domain by γ-secretase allowing for it to translocate
  to the nucleus and act as a transcription factor for cell fate pathways. Notch can
  directly affect Eph/ephrin signaling by modifying ephrin-B1 protein expression,
  initiating crosstalk between these receptor families in the regulation of cell segregation
  and boundary formation.
