caption: Schematic of the distinct effects of HND-1 and 17-AAG on stemness of breast
  cancer by affecting Hsp90 regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3β). The
  17-AAG and HDN-1 had distinct effects on Hsp90-PGK1 interaction, resulting in different
  changes and the instability of GSK3β. They all inhibited AKT expression and its
  phosphorylation. HDN-1 significantly inhibited the Wnt-β-catenin cascade, yet 17-AAG
  did not affect the signaling pathway, leading to different effects on the stemness
  of breast cancer.
