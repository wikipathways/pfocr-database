caption: 'Possible adverse effects of obesity on osteoclast. Upon binding of RANKL
  with the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-β (RANK) activates the adaptor
  protein TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which thereby activates the transcription
  factor NFATC1 via three different signaling pathways: (1) MAPK/AP1 mediated (2)
  IKK/NF-κB mediated, and (3) Rac/ROS/PLCγ/Ca2+/calcineurin mediated. Obesity induces
  RANKL signaling by decreasing the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a RANKL antagonist.
  IL-6 induces IL6R activation and thereby positively regulates the osteoclastic gene
  by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Binding of MCP1 with the C-C motif chemokine
  receptor 2 (CCR2) induces osteoclasogenesis via JAK/STAT and Ras/MAPK signaling
  pathways. TNF-α activates TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and this activation leads to recruits
  TNFRSF1A associated via death domain (TRADD) and Receptor-Interacting Protein 1
  (RIP1) with TNFR1 and this complex thereby activates TRAF2/5/6, which in turn activates
  the specific gene via IKK/NF-κB and MAPK mediated signaling pathways. M-CSF activates
  NFATC1 through PI3K/AKT/NF-κB mediated signaling pathway or induces the activation
  of transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)
  and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) through the PI3/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway. Obesity is associated with increased expression of IL-6, TNF-α, MCP1, and
  M-CSF.'
