caption: Human MET protein is proteolytically processed to yield an extracellular
  α-subunit (50 kD) and a transmembrane β-subunit (145 kD) that are linked together
  by a disulfide bond. The beta subunit contains extracellular, transmembrane and
  intracellular signaling domains. The extracellular domain in both subunits contain
  a SEMA domain, the beta chain has a MET-related sequence (MRS), glycine-proline
  rich PSI domain, and four immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig domain). The intracellular
  beta subunits contain tyrosine kinase domain and binding sites. Upon activation
  by its sole ligand HGF, which is proteolytically processed by urokinase-type plasminogen
  activtor (uPA) into active form from pro-HGF, MET RTK dimerizes, and the Tyr1234
  and Tyr1235 within the tyrosine kinase domain are phosphorylated. This activates
  the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor. Two phosphorylated tyrosine residuals
  (Tyr 1349 and Tyr 1356) located in the multi substrate docking sites near the c-terminus
  recruit adaptor proteins such as Src, SHC, Gab1, Grb2, or PI3K. For the purpose
  of clarity, this figure only depicts signaling pathways relevant to dendrite and
  spine development, which include potential activation of Ras > Erk1/2; PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway that promotes dendritic morphogenesis. In addition, small GTPase cdc42 and
  rac1 activation likely engage LIMK1/cofilin to control spine morphogenesis, actin
  dynamics and structural plasticity of the developing synapse. Note other potential
  molecular signaling events (??) are not depicted. Disrupted MET signaling, such
  as the hypomorphic ‘low activity’ rs1858830 ‘C’ allele, in developing neurons may
  collectively affect a large number of developmental events leading to increased
  risk for autism.
