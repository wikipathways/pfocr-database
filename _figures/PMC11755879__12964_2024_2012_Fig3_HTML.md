caption: 'Regulation of NLRC5 in cancer. a Regulation of signalling pathways involving
  NLRC5 as tumour-promoting factor. NLRC5 mediates proliferation, invasion, and migration
  of Glioma, ccRCC, and HCC cells by activating key target genes of Wnt/β-catenin
  signalling pathway: c-Myc, cyclin D1, and MM7. NLRC5 also promotes progression of
  HCC and EC through AKT/VEGF-A signalling pathway. b Regulation of NLRC5 gene expression
  as tumour promoter. LncRNA SCAMP1 regulates transcription of NLRC5 by repressing
  miR499-5p. miR499-5p represses NLRC5 by reducing expression of LMX1A to repress
  NLRC5. MiR-4319 binds to 3′-UTR and downregulates NLRC5 expression. MiR-125b-5p
  downregulates NLRC5 expression by destabilising its mRNA and inhibiting translation.
  MiR-125b-5p is regulated by lncRNA XIST. c Regulation of NLRC5 gene expression as
  tumour suppressor. DNA hypermethylation of NLRC5 promoter, somatic mutations, or
  chromosome copy number loss result in impaired NLRC5 expression and function, downregulation
  of MHC I expression, impaired antigen presentation, inability of CD8 + T cells to
  perform their normal immunosurveillance role, and escape of cancer cells. d Promotion
  and suppression of NLRC5 in tumour models. NLRC5 acts as tumour suppressor. NLRC5
  expression is essential for antitumour response mediated by CD8 + T cells through
  MHC-class I pathway. Normal NLRC5 expression enables effective immune surveillance
  to detect and eliminate cancer cells. NLRC5 act as tumour-promoting factor that
  enhances tumour cell migration and invasion through signalling pathways depicted
  in Fig. 3a'
