caption: Molecular mechanisms underlying cargo recognition for selective mitophagy.
  In yeast, the transmembrane autophagy-related protein 32 (Atg32) acts as a mitophagy
  receptor through an association with Atg8 (a). This association may occur directly
  through its WXXL-like LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif or via the adaptor protein
  Atg11. Although there are no structural homologs of these proteins in humans, analogous
  transmembrane LIR motif proteins serve similar purposes. During erythrocyte differentiation,
  hypoxia, or metabolic stress, NIP3 like protein X (Nix), Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19kD-interacting
  protein 3 (Bnip3), and FUN14 domain containing protein 1 (FUNDC1) act as mitophagy
  receptors (b) [reviewed in Feng et al. ()]. Dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane
  potential, or other insults that interfere with mitochondrial protein import, can
  trigger the accumulation of PINK1 on the OMM, resulting in recruitment and activation
  of parkin (c). Parkin mediates the poly-ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins,
  including the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). Sequestosome-1-like LIR motif
  adaptor proteins such as p62 and optineurin (OPTN) serve potentially redundant roles
  to bind these poly-ubiquitin chains, promoting the sequestration of damaged mitochondria
  into autophagosomes. An enzyme-dependent translocation of cardiolipin from the inner
  leaflet of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) to the outer leaflet of the OMM
  mediates selective mitophagy in response to staurosporine and the parkinsonian toxins
  rotenone and 6-hydroxydopamine (d). Although drawn as separate pathways, selective
  mitophagy in mammals mostly likely involves redundant and/or additive effects of
  more than one pathway (b-d) activated by a given stimulus or injury.
