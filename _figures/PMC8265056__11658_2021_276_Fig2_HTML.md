caption: Relationship between MAFLD and the GPR119/incretin axis. When GPR119 is activated
  by different ligands, it leads to an increase in cAMP and combines with PKA to secrete
  incretins. After further activating the corresponding receptor, it can improve the
  disease characteristics in MAFLD through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. AC, adenylyl
  cyclase. cAMP, cyclic AMP. PKA, protein kinase A. ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated
  protein kinase 1 and 2
