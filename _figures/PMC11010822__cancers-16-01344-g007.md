caption: Schematic representation of MTA1/mTOR pathway in prostate cancer. MTA1 overexpression
  in R26MTA1; Ptenf/f preclinical model of prostate cancer leads to hyperactivation
  of mTOR resulting in phosphorylation of downstream target proteins such as S6K and
  4EBP1 and CyclinD1. These changes promote cell growth, proliferation, and survival.
  Gnetin C, plant-derived stilbene, inhibits MTA1-associated mTOR pathway activation
  resulting in antitumor activity
