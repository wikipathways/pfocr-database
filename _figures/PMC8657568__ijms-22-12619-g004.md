caption: The MAPK cascade pathway is an upstream regulator of dehydrin gene expression.
  Under drought conditions, MAP3K-MKK3-MPK1/2/7/14 is activated by the core ABA component
  and regulates the expression of downstream dehydrins including RD29B and RAB18 by
  phosphorylating ABF TFs. In response to chilling, the MEKK1-MKK2-MPK4 cascade pathway
  is activated by Ca-CaM, counteracts the inhibitory effect of MAPK3/6 on ICE1, and
  upregulates downstream CORs. OST1 involved in the ABA signaling pathway can phosphorylate
  ICE1 to prevent its degradation and induce its accumulation. However, it is unclear
  whether ABA participates in this pathway. We use arrows and bars showing positive
  and negative adjustment, and solid and dashed lines indicate direct and indirect/unknown
  adjustment, respectively.
