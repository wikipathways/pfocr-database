caption: Symptoms of Mpox, immuno‐mechanisms, and treatment targets of MPXV. After
  the incubation period of MPXV, except for skin rashes on the head, face, trunk,
  limbs, nail bed, anus, and genitals, patients generally have symptoms such as fever,
  cough, sore throat, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, etc. A
  few patients experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea due to proctitis.
  Typical features of systemic viral invasion include swollen lymph nodes in the neck,
  armpits, and groins. Three types of immune defense mechanisms are involved in MPXV
  infection, namely antigen‐antibody binding (e.g., JYNNEOS vaccine), host interferon
  response, and interferon‐mediated signaling pathway. IL‐15 therapy can induce the
  production of NK and CD8+ cells, and increased NK cell counts prevent fatal MPXV
  infection. MPXV activates IFN‐1 secretion in almost all cell types, and IFN‐1 activates
  the JAK/STAT pathway in an antiviral state. The drug targets of MPXV are summarized
  on the right side. The targets of MPXV inhibition and related drugs were as followed
