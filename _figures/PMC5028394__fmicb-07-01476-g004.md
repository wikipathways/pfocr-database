caption: The proposed molecular model of circadian rhythms in S. costatum. Genes are
  indicated using oblong shapes with the italic gene names in the shape. Proteins
  are indicated using oval shapes with the protein name in the shape. Transcription
  and translation is indicated by dashed lines. Positive action is indicated by solid
  lines with lines ending in arrowheads, and negative action is indicated with lines
  ending in perpendicular dashes. The core CCA1 (circadian clock associated 1)/LHY/TOC1
  circadian oscillator is highlighted in red lines. Phosphorylation of LHY and CCA1
  by CK2 (casein kinase II) is indicated with circled P’s in purple. The shaded area
  indicates activities peaking in the nighttime, and the white area activities peaking
  in the daytime. The gray oblong and oval shapes represent the genes or proteins
  that are identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (; ), but not identified in the S. costatum
  transcriptome in our study. Because the sampling was conducted in the daytime, so
  the genes which are active in the nighttime were not detected in this study. In
  part of the input pathway, light, temperature and nutrient (N, Fe, etc.) have been
  identified as the main input signal, but P as the input signal has not been reported.
  For the output pathway, the metabolic pathways affected by circadian rhythms that
  are demonstrated in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the flagellate Euglena
  gracilis, the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongata, and the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax
  polyedra () and Arabidopsis thaliana () might also be affected in S. costatum. The
  circles and questions marks indicate possible regulatory mechanisms of circadian
  rhythm in S. costatum responses to ambient P changing.
