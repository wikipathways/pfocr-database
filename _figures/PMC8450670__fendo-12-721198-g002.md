caption: Model diagram of potential mechanisms of neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory
  effects of GLP-1. GLP-1 analogues like native GLP-1 have a longer half-life. Their
  effects are mediated through binding to GLP-1R, which could inhibit pathways such
  as the NF-κB pathway and MAPKs pathway. LPS, combined with TLR-4, activates the
  NF-κB pathway and triggers an inflammatory response while GLP-1 could inhibit the
  response to protect the synaptic plasticity. Besides, GLP-1 binds to GLP-1R to the
  active AMPK pathway involved in neuroprotection.
