caption: 'Schematic overview of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis
  (based on ; ). Catalyzing enzymes, AGI codes, and corresponding genetic loci in
  parentheses are indicated. Graphs represent the expression profiles of the corresponding
  genes in response to 0, 3, and 8 h of HL irradiation: solid line, control; dashed,
  CAT2HP1. Dashed arrows indicate different branches of the flavonoid pathway involved
  in the biosynthesis of other flavonoids or secondary metabolites that were not activated
  in the experiment. The names of the major classes of (flavonoid) end products are
  boxed. C4H, Cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; CHI, chalcone
  isomerase; F3H, flavonone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′ hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  reductase; ANS/LDOX, anthocyanidin synthase/leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; UFGT,
  UDP-Glc:flavonoid glycosyltransferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TT, testa
  transparent; DIN, dark-inducible.'
