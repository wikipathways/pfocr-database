caption: Potential biological signaling networks related to PM-induced skin diseases
  predicted from our NGS-based experimental data. Direct biological interaction among
  the identified DEG from in vitro RNA-seq analysis. (a) Biological functions predicted
  to be altered according to the signaling networks were analyzed using Pathway Studio.
  The predicted functions are presented as a “functional class” among the genes in
  the pathway. (b) Cellular processes predicted to be affected according to the signaling
  networks were analyzed using Pathway Studio. The descriptions of the schematic symbols
  are located to the left of each figure. Upregulated and down regulated genes are
  highlighted in pink and blue respectively.
