caption: The amino acid biosynthetic pathway in the parasitoid wasp C. chilonis and
  its host C. suppressalis. The amino acid biosynthetic pathways were redrawn from
  the KEGG pathway, map01230. The pathway genes in gray are lost in both genomes of
  C. chilonis and C. suppressalis. The pathway genes in green are present in both
  genomes of C. chilonis and C. suppressalis. The pathway genes in orange are present
  in the genome of C. suppressalis but are lost in the genome of C. chilonis. The
  gene losses in the amino acid biosynthetic pathway of C. chilonis have disrupted
  the biosynthesis of ten amino acids (ASL-AA, Arg). However, the gene losses in the
  amino acid biosynthetic pathway of C. suppressalis have disrupted the biosynthesis
  of nine amino acids (ASL-AA), and the biosynthesis of these nine amino acids was
  thought to have been lost in the common ancestor of animals []. Gene copy number
  (GCN) of each pathway ortholog in C. chilonis and C. suppressalis was shown
