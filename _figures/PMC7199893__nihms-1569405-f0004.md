caption: ALT cancer cells must maintain a balance between pro- and anti-recombinogenic
  signals. A shift from this equilibrium poses a therapeutic vulnerability that can
  be exploited for selective killing of ALT cancers. Synthetic lethality with ATRX/DAXX
  is a promising target since ATRX/DAXX loss of function mutations are prevalent in
  ALT cancers. Similarly, ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) is an attractive target
  for therapy since APBs are unique to ALT cancers and are implicated in telomere
  metabolism of ALT cells. Disruption of APBs with infection of Herpes Simplex Virus-1
  (HSV-1) or depletion of TSPYL5 have been shown to elicit cytotoxicity. In addition,
  several lines of evidence report that inhibition of HDR factors perturbs ALT activity
  and provokes to cell death. Intriguingly, the absence of STING in ALT cancers enables
  activation of the pro-survival autophagic pathway. This reliance on autophagy may
  present a unique opportunity in ALT cancers to tip the balance in favor of apoptotic
  cell death.
