caption: 'Graphical representation for Mel regulation in DRG neurons. (A) Overview
  of altered trends in all DEGs in the MAPK and calcium signaling pathways in the
  1 mM Mel group and 100 μM 8MP group on microarray. There were more down-regulated
  genes in the MAPK and calcium signaling pathways in the 1 mM Mel compared to the
  100 μM 8MP group. (B) Diagram of the proposed signaling pathway for Mel in the DRG
  neurons: 1: Activation of RORα by high-dose Mel could inhibit the biological effects
  of MT2; 2: Inhibition of MAPK-calcium signaling pathways by MT2 activation could
  suppress c-fos, CGRP, TNF-1α, and IL-1β; and 3: Inhibition of NOS1 by Mel was independent
  of MT2, and RORα was also involved in the pain-related regulation.'
