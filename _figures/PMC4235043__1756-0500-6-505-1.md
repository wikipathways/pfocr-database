caption: 'Schematic representation of Glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway. Broad
  arrows indicate the enzymes (indicated by the names of the corresponding genes)
  highly related to itaconic acid production as identified from the A. terreus clone
  based transcriptome data analysis (see Additional file : Table S1). Group I (black
  arrows) pgdA (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase), rpeA (ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase),
  rpiB (ribose 5-phosphate isomerase), cadA (cis-aconitate decarboxylase), group II
  (vertically striped arrow) gpdA (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), group
  III (white arrows) gpdB (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), pppA (transaldolase).
  The vitamins dependent tklA (transketolase), pycA (pyruvate carboxylase) and pdcA
  (pyruvate decarboxylase) (thus related to the upregulated vitamin biosynthetic genes
  in group II and IV) were indicated with the blocked filled arrows.'
