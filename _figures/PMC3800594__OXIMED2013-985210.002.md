caption: Schematic model of novel cytoprotective mechanisms in response to oxidative
  stress in β-thalassemic (β-thal) erythroid precursors. In β-thalassemic erythropoiesis
  the radical oxidative species (ROS) induces peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2) expression.
  In the early stage of β-thalassemic erythropoiesis, ROS and heme levels are both
  increased and PRDX2 acts on both targets; in more mature cells, when ROS levels
  are still high and heme levels are reduced, ROS might become the PRDX2 major target
  (see text for details). ROS promotes HRI activation, which requires the heat shock
  proteins 70 and 90 (HSP70,-90). HRI activation results in phosphorylation of the
  α-subunit of eIF2, an important regulatory translation initiating factor, which
  inhibits the α-, β-globin chain synthesis and activates the Atf4 pathway towards
  redox genes such as heme-oxygenase-1 (ho-1), glutathione S-transferase (gst), and
  NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1). The upregulation of these genes in combination
  with the decrease in α-, β-globin chain synthesis might beneficially affect the
  ineffective erythropoiesis of β-thalassemia. The α chains (AHSP, α hemoglobin-stabilizing
  protein) is another cytoprotective system, which partially protects the erythroid
  precursors from the α chain excess. AHSP binds free α-globin chains, stabilizing
  their structure. AHSP prevents their precipitation and might be important in β-thalassemic
  erythropoiesis characterized by unbalance in globin chain synthesis.
