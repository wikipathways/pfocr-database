caption: 'Classes of drugs that modulate the cGMP-PKG pathway in relation to SERCA2a
  within cardiac myocytes (cardiomyocytes). cGMP is produced by sGC, which is activated
  by NO, or by the transmembrane pGC, which is activated by natriuretic peptides (ANP,
  BNP). Class of NO and nitroxyl donors is shown (①). sGC stimulators (②) target only
  nonoxidized sGC (Fe2+); in contrast, sGC activators (③) target oxidized sGC (Fe3+)
  by ROS. NEPs responsible for ANP and BNP breakdown are indicated (④). PDE5 operates
  the breakdown of cGMP produced by sGC, while PDE9 is responsible for the breakdown
  of cGMP produced by pGC (⑤). Abbreviations: 5’GMP, guanosine 5’-monophosphate; Ang-II,
  angiotensin-Π; ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; BNP, brain natriuretic peptide;
  cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; ECM, extracellular matrix; ET-1, endothelin-1;
  GTP, guanosine triphosphate; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction;
  IC, intracellular; LTCC, L-type calcium channel; NEP, inhibitor of neprilysin; NO,
  nitric oxide; P, phosphate group; PDE5, phosphodiesterase 5; pGC, particulate guanylate
  cyclase; PKG, protein kinase G; PLB, phospholamban; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  RyR2, ryanodine receptor 2; SERCA2a, sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase
  2a; sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase; SR, sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum; T-tubule,
  transverse tubule; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β. Figure adapted with permission
