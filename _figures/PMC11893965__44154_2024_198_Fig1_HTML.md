caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways for ethylene (ET), nitric oxide (NO), and polyamines
  (PAs) and their interconnected regulation in plants. (1) The general precursor of
  ET, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) is formed by SAM synthetase (SAMS) using methionine
  at the expense of ATP. (2,3) SAM is utilized for ET and PA biosynthesis as per their
  demands. SAM gets converted into 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) through
  ACC synthase (ACS) and then to ET by ACC oxidase (ACO) by consumption of O2, forming
  CO2 and CN− as by-products. (4) ACS and ACO activities are regulated by NO through
  S-nitrosylation. (5-10) The Yang cycle functions to recycle 5′-methylthioadenosine
  (MTA), a by-product of ACC biosynthesis, back to methionine. (5) MTA is converted
  to 5′-methylthioribose (MTR) by MTA nucleosidase (MTN) releasing adenine. (6) MTR
  is then phosphorylated by MTR kinase (MTK) into MTR-phosphate (MTR-P). (7-9) This
  intermediate is subsequently isomerized by MTR-P isomerase (MTI) to produce 5′-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate
  (MTRu-P) which is then converted to 1,2-dihidroxy-3-keto-5′-methylthiopentene (DHKMP)
  by the enzyme dehydratase-enolase-phosphatase (DEP) in a single step and finally
  to 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate (KMTB) by acireductone dioxygenase (ARD). (10) Methionine,
  the precursor for ET biosynthesis, is formed by the transamination of KMTB. (11)
  SAM also gets converted to decarboxylated SAM by the dcSAMS enzyme that provides
  the intermediate for PA synthesis. (12) NO also regulates dcSAMS activity. (13-15)
  During PA biosynthesis, arginine is converted to Putrescine (Put) in a series of
  reactions catalyzed by arginine decarboxylase (ADC), agmatine iminohydrolase (AIH),
  and N-carbamoyl putrescine amidohydrolase (CPA). (16) Arginine amidinohydrolyase
  (ARGAH) converts agmatine to Put, or hydrolyse arginine to ornithine (Orn). (17)
  Conversion of Orn to Put is catalyzed by Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). (18–20)
  Put is also used for the biosynthesis of Spermidine (Spd) by Spd synthase (SPDS)
  which is further converted to the Spermine (Spm) and Thermospermine (tSpm) by Spm
  synthase (SPMS) and Thermospermine synthase (ACL5), respectively. (21) Polyamine
  oxidases (PAOs) oxidize Spd, Spm, and tSpm to produce different small molecular
  weight amines and a common by-product H2O2. (22) ET induces gene expression of PAOs
  to promote PA catabolism and (23) putative nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that leads
  to NO biosynthesis using L-Arginine as substrate in the presence of O2 and NADPH.
  (24–25) Nitrate reductase (NR) and Plasma membrane-bound Nitrite-Nitric oxide reductase
  (PM:Ni-NOR) use NO2⁻ as a substrate to generate NO. (26) Non-enzymatic sources are
  also reported to generate NO in vivo. ± : Positive or negative regulation'
