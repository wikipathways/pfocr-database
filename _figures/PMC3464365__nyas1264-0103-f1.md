caption: Linking cellular metabolism with the circadian clock transcriptional complex.
  A series of studies demonstrated that the circadian clock machinery controls the
  cyclic synthesis of NAD+ through control of the NAD+ salvage pathway., The gene
  encoding the enzyme NAMPT, the rate-limiting step in the NAD+ salvage pathway, contains
  E-boxes and is controlled by CLOCK-BMAL1. A crucial step in the NAD+ salvage pathway
  is controlled by SIRT1, which also contributes to the regulation of the Nampt promoter
  by associating with CLOCK-BMAL1 in the CLOCK chromatin complex. Oscillating levels
  of NAD+ also regulate chromatin remodeling events through SIRT1 and ultimately connect
  clock-dependent transcriptional control with a cellular metabolic pathway. MLL1
  also directs the cyclic histone H3 Lys4 trimethylation event that is responsible
  for CLOCK:BMAL1 recruitment and permits circadian gene expression. Also included
  is the HDAC3 complex, which targets H3K9 acetylation in a circadian manner, EZH2,63
  and Jarid1a. NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; ∼ indicates oscillation; Me,
  methylation; Ac, acetylation.
