caption: Schematic pathway of HIV-1 B and C differentially influence central nervous
  system. A comprehensive model showing how HIV-1 clade B and C differentially impact
  signaling through dendritic cells (DC), T cell and macrophages (and the closely
  related microglial cells) in the brain and their contribution to the pathogenesis
  of AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC) and neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The viral Trans
  activator protein (Tat) leads to secretion of neurotoxin QUIN and Arachidonic acid
  metabolites mediators’ which influence dopamine and mGlu receptor can activate astrocytes,
  and that may damage neurons differentially.
