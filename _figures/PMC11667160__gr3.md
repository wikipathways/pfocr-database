caption: 'A schematic representation of ERS-induced apoptosis. The induction of ERS-mediated
  apoptosis involves four major pathways, namely PERK, IRE1α, ATF6, and Ca2+. Among
  these pathways, the CHOP pathway plays a pivotal role in driving apoptosis, while
  all three transmembrane sensors can trigger apoptotic responses. Additionally, ERS
  can also induce apoptosis through the IRE1α-TRAF2-JNK pathway. Perturbation of Ca2+
  homeostasis leads to calpain activation and subsequent formation of mitochondrial
  permeability transition pores. Subsequent release of CytC as a consequence of this
  cascade event ultimately activates the mitochondrial apoptotic program. This figure
  is created with BioRender.com. Abbreviations used: ATF6, Activating transcription
  factor 6; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; ERS, Endoplasmic reticulum stress; IRE1,
  Inositol-requiring enzyme 1; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PERK, Protein kinase-like
  ER kinase'
