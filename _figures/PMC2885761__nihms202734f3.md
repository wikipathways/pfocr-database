caption: Schematical overview of the signaling pathway mediated by OA1. Endogenous
  OA1 resides on the membrane of late endosomes/lysosomes and melanosomes, where it
  could function as a “sensor” of melanosome maturation and be activated by molecules
  belonging to the melanin biosynthetic pathway, possibly L-DOPA. It appears coupled
  to Gi proteins, through which it regulates proper biogenesis of melanosomes and
  restrains their transport toward the cell periphery by still unknown effectors.
  While a role in melanosome biogenesis and transport is supported by numerous lines
  of evidence, it is unclear whether the lysosomal localization of endogenous OA1
  in melanocytes has a functional or downregulation role. In addition, a minor fraction
  of endogenous OA1 might travel to the cell surface of RPE cells, where it could
  become activated by L-DOPA and in turn trigger a Gq-mediated signaling pathway eventually
  leading to the secretion of neurotrophic factors. In contrast, exogenous OA1 overexpressed
  in non-melanocytic cells can be substantially missorted to the plasma membrane,
  downregulated by arrestins and coupled to Gq proteins, leading to phospholipase
  C activation and inositol phosphate or intracellular calcium increase (not shown).
