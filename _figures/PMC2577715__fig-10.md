caption: Posttranscriptional regulation of γ-GCSh mRNA stability by the MAP kinase
  pathway under oxidative-stress conditions. Oxidative stress activates MKK kinase,
  which phosphorylates its downstream mediators, MKK, MAPK, and MAPKAPK2, resulting
  in the translocation of mRNA stabilizing factor, HuR, from the nucleus into the
  cytoplasm. HuR binds to the 3′-UTR of γ-GCSh mRNA and stabilizes it from degradation.
  Increased γ-GCSh leads to elevation of an amount of GSH, which in turn suppresses
  oxidative stress.
