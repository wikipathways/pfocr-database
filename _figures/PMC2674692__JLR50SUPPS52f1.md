caption: Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) synthesis, metabolism, and function. EETs
  are synthesized by cells that express cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase. When cytosolic
  phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is activated, the arachidonic acid hydrolyzed from intracellular
  phospholipids is converted to EETs. The EETs are released into the extracellular
  fluid and produce paracrine effects on other cells in the local environment. This
  may occur through EET binding to a receptor that is coupled to a signal transduction
  system, or through uptake and direct interaction of the EET with intracellular effector
  systems. Cytosolic fatty acid binding protein (FABP) may facilitate the uptake of
  EETs and modulate their incorporation into cell phospholipids and conversion to
  dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). EETs also
  can produce autacrine effects through similar intracellular or receptor-mediated
  mechanisms.

  description: Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) synthesis, metabolism, and function.
    EETs are synthesized by cells that express cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase.
    When cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is activated, the arachidonic acid hydrolyzed
    from intracellular phospholipids is converted to EETs. The EETs are released into

    (FABP) may facilitate the uptake of EETs and modulate their incorporation into
    cell phospholipids and conversion to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) by
