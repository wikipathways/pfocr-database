caption: (Left) The adrenal gland is innervated by sympathetic splanchnic nerves.
  These nerves form en passant synapses with chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla.
  (Right) PACAP is released as a result of synaptic vesicle fusion. Subsequent activation
  of PAC1 receptors stimulates adenylyl cyclase, generates cAMP, and activates PLCε
  via Epac and Rap. PLCε is a key signaling node in this pathway. PLCε hydrolyzes
  PIP2 to produce IP3 and DAG. DAG, in turn, activates PKC. PKC may enhance Ca2+ entry
  through L-type Ca2+ channels and may also sensitize vesicles to Ca2+. Ca2+, entering
  through voltage-gated channels (VGCCs), gates liganded-IP3R1s and enables Ca2+ release
  from the ER (Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, CICR). These pathways promote a persistent
  elevation in intracellular Ca2+ that underlies the strong secretory response stimulated
  by PACAP. ER Ca2+ is refilled by Ca2+-release activated channels (CRAC) formed by
  stromal interaction molecule (STIM) and Orai proteins. Once Ca2+ enters the cell,
  it is pumped into the ER by sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA)
