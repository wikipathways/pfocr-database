caption: 3,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde derived from phenylalanine and tyramine derived
  from tyrosine are condensed to form norbelladine. Norbelladine is methylated by
  NpN4OMT to 4′-O-methylnorbelladine. 4′-O-Methylnorbelladine is oxidized to N-demethylnarwedine.
  N-demethylnarwedine is then reduced to N-demethylgalanthamine. In the last step,
  N-demethylgalanthamine is methylated to galanthamine.
