caption: Schematic representation of the known functional interactions between Notch
  and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways. Notch signaling regulates the expression of PD-1 in CD8+
  T lymphocytes, promoting PDCD1 transcription (depicted by the red arrow) by the
  direct interaction of the NICD-CSL complex with the PDCD1 promoter. In tumor cells,
  the Notch pathway determines the upregulation of PD-L1 ligand expression (red arrow).
  However, the exact mechanism of regulation needs to be elucidated further. Figure
