caption: Platelets involvement in the pathogenesis of AAVs. Neutrophils play a crucial
  role in the development of AAVs. Platelet receptors CD40L and P-selectin enable
  the interaction with neutrophils promoting ROS generation and NET formation. ROS
  and NETs are toxic to the endothelium and can lead to VWF release and vascular injury.
  VWF is well-known to mediate platelets adhesion and aggregation. Similar to neutrophils,
  sCD40L-CD40 can also mediate platelet -endothelial cell interaction, which can enhance
  the expression of endothelial cell adhesion proteins (e.g., E-selectin, VCAM-1,
  and ICAM-1). C5a, a chemoattractant anaphylatoxin, can directly attract and activate
  neutrophils promoting the exposure of tissue factor. Tissue factor initiates the
  plasmatic coagulation which culminates in the generation of thrombin. Thrombin is
  able to further activate platelets and endothelial cells through PAR signaling pathway,
  followed by platelet degranulation and VWF release. In addition, C5a can also directly
  active endothelial cells accelerating vascular injury.
