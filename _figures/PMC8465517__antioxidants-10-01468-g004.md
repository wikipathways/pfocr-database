caption: The Golgi stress response and its intersection with redox homeostasis in
  Huntington’s disease (HD). (a) Golgi stress response in normal cells. Golgi stress
  activates PERK, which phosphorylates eIF2α to inhibit general protein synthesis.
  Only mRNAs such as ATF4 are translated. ATF4 regulates amino acid homeostasis and
  one of the genes induced by ATF4 is CTH (which encodes the biosynthetic enzyme for
  cysteine, also called CSE). CSE utilizes cysteine to produce the gaseous signaling
  molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S). H2S signals by a post-translational modification
  termed sulfhydration/persulfidation and modulates the activity of target proteins.
  H2S stimulates cystine uptake by the cystine transporter, leading to increased cysteine
  levels in cells. ATF4 also regulates expression of SLC7A11 (xCT), a subunit of the
  cystine transporter, by activating its transcription through heterodimerization
  with Nrf2, a master regulator of redox homeostasis. (b) Harnessing the Golgi stress
  response to elicit cytoprotection in HD. Normal cells express CSE and ATF4 during
  basal conditions and during stress to produce cysteine. Cysteine is also imported
  into cells via the cystine transporter, Xc-. In HD, both basal expression of CSE
  (regulated by specificity protein1, SP1) as well as stress-induced expression of
  CSE and the xCT subunit of the cystine transporter by ATF4 are compromised, causing
  a cysteine deficit which leads to decreased H2S levels and sulfhydration. When cells
  are treated with monensin, a Golgi stressor, CSE is induced via the PERK/ATF4 pathway
  to increase cysteine and H2S levels and mediate cytoprotection.
