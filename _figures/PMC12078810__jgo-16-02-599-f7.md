caption: Mechanism by which ART inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma cells. LPS could
  activate the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma. ART
  could inhibit the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting proliferation,
  invasion, and migration and inducing apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
