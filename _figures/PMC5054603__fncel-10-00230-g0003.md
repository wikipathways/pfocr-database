caption: Gene expression changes in neurotransmitter signaling pathways. (A) GABA-ergic
  synapse pathway. Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA) of the microarray data
  revealed significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the
  “GABAergic synapse” pathway (Bonferroni p = 0.005). Nodes and edges of the graph
  represent genes and their relations, respectively. Colored nodes indicate DEGs with
  color proportional to log2 fold change values. White node are genes that are not
  expressed differentially. (B) DEGs of the cholinergic synapse pathway. Gene expression
  data analysis by SPIA revealed differentially expressed genes that are involved
  in the “cholinergic signaling” pathway (Bonferroni p = 0.038). Interaction of differentially
  expressed genes are presented here. The complete pathway is shown in Supplementary
  Figure . (C) DEGs of the dopaminergic synapse pathway. Microarray data analysis
  by SPIA showed that a significant number of the differentially expressed genes was
  enriched in the dopaminergic signaling pathway (Bonferroni p = 0.035). Interaction
  of differentially expressed genes are presented here; the complete pathway is depicted
  in Supplementary Figure .
