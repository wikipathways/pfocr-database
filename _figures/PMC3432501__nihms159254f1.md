caption: MAPK and NFκB signaling pathways. The MAPK pathway is activated in vitro
  by Ras or Raf and the phosphorylation of MAPKinase (P-MAPK) is observed to indicate
  activation of the pathway. The NFκB pathway is activated byTRAF6, NIK, or MEKK1,
  and the phosphorylation of IκB (P-IκB) is observed to indicate activation of the
  pathway.
