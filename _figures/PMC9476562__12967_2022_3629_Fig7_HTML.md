caption: The metabolic network for the key pathways in the renoprotection effect of
  Empa in db/db mice. The background color for each pathway represents the active
  state after Empa intervention. Yellow, elevated activity after Empa intervention;
  Blue, decreased activity after Empa intervention. The color of the box below each
  metabolites represents the log2 (fold change) of this metabolite between db/db and
  db/m or Empa and db/db group. ‘a’, the serotonin metabolism pathway; ‘b’, the indole
  pathway; ‘c’, the kynurenine pathway; ‘d’, NAD+ de novo synthesis pathway; ‘e’,
  the salvage synthesis pathway of NAD+; ‘f’, purine degradation pathway; ‘g’, ATP-degradation
  mediated purine nucleotide conversion bypass; ‘h’, pyrimidine de novo synthesis
  pathway
