caption: Osteoblast differentiation is induced by several receptors, and leads to
  the activation of osteoblast transcription factors, including runt-related transcription
  factor 2 (Runx2), osterix, and Dlx5. Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) superfamily
  members (including bone morphogenetic proteins, BMPs) signal via serine/threonine
  receptor kinases and phosphorylation of Smad molecules. Phosphorylated Smads bind
  with the common Smad4 and forming a trimeric structure which is translocated to
  the nucleus, where they induce transcription of osteoblast genes. TGFβ superfamiliy
  receptors also signal through mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.
  Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor signals through cytoplasmatic parts possessing
  tyrosine kinase domains, activated upon conformational changes induced by ligand
  binding. They phophorylate and activate MAPK and protein kinase C (PKC).Wnt ligand
  binds to a frizzled (FZZ)/low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP)
  complex, activating the intracellular protein dishevelled (DSH). DSH inhibits the
  activity of complex protein structure which transports β-catenin to the proteasome,
  and results in β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol. β-catenin is then translocated
  to the nucleus where it regulates transcription.Ephrin (Eph) B4 is expressed on
  osteoblasts and signals through RhoA GTPase, while EphB2 expressed on osteoclasts
  signals through PDZ proteins. Interaction of EphB2 and EphB4 couples bone resorption
  to formation.Osteoclast differentiation is driven by several transcription factors,
  including nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATc1), Jun and Fos proteins, and
  NFκB. Receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF) κB (RANK) is a receptor from the
  tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, which is essential for osteoclastogenesis.
  Binding of its ligand (RANKL) activates various signaling pathways including NFκB,
  MAPK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), and phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K). PI3K signaling links the RANK signaling pathway to the Akt proliferation
  and survival pathway. Binding of monocyte–colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) to its
  receptor (c-Fms) is essential for proliferation and survival of osteoclast precursors,
  and signals via PI3K/Akt and ERK. Additionally, signaling through the immunoglobulin
  (Ig)-like receptor, involving DAP12 protein or FcRγ activates PLCγ, and induces
  calcium release, and transcription of osteoclast genes via calmodulin (CaM) and
  calcineurin.Yellow arrows point to the components of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation
  pathways, which are proposed to be regulated by Fas signaling.
