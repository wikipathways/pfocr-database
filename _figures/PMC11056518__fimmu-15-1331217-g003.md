caption: Schematic representation of IL-23 and IL-12 and their receptors, with summary
  of associated effector cells, cytokines, and immune function. IL-23 comprises the
  p19 and p40 subunits that bind to the IL-23R and IL-12Rβ1 subunits of the IL-23
  receptor, respectively. IL-12 also contains the p40 subunit, which pairs with the
  p35 subunit that binds to IL-12Rβ2 (39). Engagement of the IL-23 receptor results
  in formation of a cytokine-receptor ternary complex that includes IL-23, IL-23R,
  and IL-12Rβ1 (40). Formation of this ternary complex activates a range of JAKs,
  including JAK2 and TYK2, which associate with intracellular domains of the receptor
  subunits and initiate specific signaling cascades (40–42). IL-23 activates pathogenic
  functions of CD4+ Th17 cells and stimulates other effector cells, including γδ T
  cells, NKTs, “natural” Th17 cells, Tc17 cells, MAITs, and ILC3s, that collectively
  produce IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, GM-CSF, IL-6, and TNF-α (32, 41). In contrast, IL-12
  promotes differentiation of Th1 cells and activates NK cells, ILC1s, and cytotoxic
  T cells leading to production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, granzymes, and perforin (41). In
  addition, IL-23 activation of transcription factors, including STAT3, RORγt, and
  Blimp-1, enhances IL23R expression and, in a positive-feedback loop, can amplify
  IL-23 signaling (39, 43). RORγt represents a particularly notable IL-23–induced
  transcription factor essential for differentiation of naive T cells into Th17 cells.
  Simultaneous priming with TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-1 activates RORγt and induces expression
  of the IL-23 receptor, thus amplifying IL-23 signaling, which is critical for maturation
  and stabilization of the proinflammatory Th17 phenotype (18, 34, 35). The IL-23/Th17
  pathway is important for protection against extracellular bacterial and fungal infections,
  while it appears to be dispensable for protection against most intracellular infections.
  In contrast, the IL-12/Th1 pathway is required for host responses to intracellular
  pathogens (44). Blimp-1, B lymphocyte–induced maturation protein 1; GM-CSF, granulocyte
