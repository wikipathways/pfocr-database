caption: Overview of the canonical lipolysis pathway in adipocytes. (A) In the basal
  status, PLIN1 sequesters CGI-58, the co-activator of ATGL, limiting its function.
  This, together with the fact that ATGL can be further inhibited through direct interaction
  with G0S2 and FSP27, leads to a low TG hydrolysis rate. (B) In stimulated lipolysis,
  norepinephrine, secreted by sympathetic nerves innervating the adipose tissue, binds
  to β adrenergic receptors and activates AC. Consequently, there is an increase in
  the cytosolic levels of cAMP, which stimulates PKA, a kinase that phosphorylates
  PLIN1 and HSL. The phosphorylation of PLIN1 results in the release of CGI-58, which
  can then bind to ATGL, promoting the hydrolysis of TGs into DGs. In addition, upon
  phosphorylation of HSL, this lipase relocates to the lipid droplet surface where
  it can interact with PLIN1 and degrades DGs into MGs, which are further processed
  by MGL. Finally, the fatty acids generated in each lipolytic step, and their derivatives,
  can act as signaling ligands or as precursors for ligands of PPARα/γ and stimulate
  the expression of genes involved in energy homeostasis. AC, adenylyl cyclase; AR,
  adrenergic receptor; ATGL, adipose triglyceride lipase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CGI-58, comparative gene identification 58;
  DG, diglyceride; FFA, free fatty acid; FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; FSP27,
