caption: 'The effect of tumor suppressor genes during suppression of pathways involved
  in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis and progress (Source: The authors of this paper).SLC5A8
  and TSHR inhibit the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, involved cell cycle through cyclin D1
  and angiogenesis.RASSF1 acts through three ways. First, inhibiting the RAS oncogene
  and consequently preventing RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, cell cycle and angiogenesis. Second,
  motivating pro-apoptotic kinases (MSTs) and then inducing apoptosis. Third, activating
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and then stopping cell cycle through cyclin
  D1.RUNX3 interrupts Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, involved in cell proliferation
  and invasion. It also forms the complex with TCF4-b-catenin complex and consequently
  inhibiting the cyclinD1 activity. RUNX3 cooperates to activating the Transforming
  growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway by induction of p21 and Bim and regulates apoptosis.
  RARβ forms complex with RARα and induced apoptosis and inhibit cell cycle.P16 forms
  complex with Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and then inhibits cyclin D1, prevents
  cell growth and stop cell cycle.PTEN interrupts in the phosphoinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K) AKT pathway through effects on common genetic alterations in this pathway,
  which plays an important role in tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer.DAPK1 inhibit the
  RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, involved cell cycle and angiogenesis through Mitogen- and stress-activated
  kinase 1 (MSK1). In addition,TIMP3 inhibits angiogenesis through effects on Vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMPs)'
