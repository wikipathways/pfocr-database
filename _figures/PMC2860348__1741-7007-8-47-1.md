caption: p38 MAPK mediates the transcriptional response to stress. The p38 MAPK pathway
  is activated by stresses and leads to the phosphorylation of a number of transcriptional
  regulators that can orchestrate a program of gene expression, including the upregulation
  of many transcription-factor genes. The transcription-factor genes listed in the
  light-blue shaded box were upregulated by all the stresses to some extent. The other
  transcription-factor genes listed are color coded and are examples of genes that
  are upregulated by individual stresses or by two of the stresses (dark blue, osmotic
  stress; green, anisomycin; purple, TNFα). Functional categories of genes that were
  enriched are depicted at the bottom of the figure.
