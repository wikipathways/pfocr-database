caption: (A) Intestinal epithelial barrier and inflammatory responses in symbiotic
  and dysbiotic gut microbiota. A symbiotic gut microbiota leads to development of
  a functional barrier, with normal amounts of mucus, pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs), antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and secreted IgA, which in turn contain the
  microbiota in the intestinal lumen and away from the intestinal epithelial cells.
  As a result, the intestinal immune system becomes largely tolerant to the resident
  commensals. Similar to immune cells, the signaling cascades that occur downstream
  of TLRs (enlarged on the left) are used by epithelial cells to detect microbes through
  PRRs, such as the TLR4. Briefly, upon LPS ligation, the MYD88 is recruited, which
  activates the NF-κB pathway and leads to production of antimicrobial proteins and
  proinflammatory cytokines. In a symbiotic gut, epithelial cells are desensitized
  by continuous exposure to LPS or are attenuated by (1) LPS-mediated downregulation
  of the IL-1 receptor–associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which is the proximal activator
  of the NF-κB cascade; (2) LPS-mediated induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ (PPArγ), which can divert NF-κB from the nucleus; or (3) commensal bacteria-derived
  reactive oxygen species (ROS)–mediated inhibition of polyubiquitylation and degradation
  of the aortic inhibitor of κB. (T bars indicate the checkpoints that are controlled
  by the microbiota.) Exposure to LPS induces epithelial cells to secrete TGF-β, B-cell–activating
  factor of the TNF family (BAFF), and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), all
  promoting the development of tolerogenic immune cell responses to the microbiota.
  CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) support the development of regulatory T (Treg) cells
  secreting IL-10 and TGF-β, and together they stimulate the production of commensal-specific
  IgA. (B) Increased intestinal concentration of uremic toxins associated with the
  progression of CKD leads to microbial dysbiosis and overgrowth of pathobionts. Pathobiont
  overgrowth leads to the loss of barrier integrity and the breach in the epithelia
  barrier. Translocation of bacteria and bacterial components triggers the intestinal
  immune system to direct a potentially harmful proinflammatory response to clear
  invading bacteria by secreting IL-1 and -6 from intestinal epithelial cells, promoting
  a TH1 and TH17 response by DCs and macrophages and producing higher levels of commensal-specific
  IgG by B cells. In this context, LPS binding to its receptor complex on macrophages
  (enlarged on the left) results in enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines
  including IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and IL-12, the production of which has
  been shown to require activation of p38MAPK. Subclinical endotoxemia is a potential
  cause of inflammation in CKD.– Dysregulated immune response and chronic production
  of proinflammatory cytokines lead to systemic inflammation, which could further
  accelerate the progression of CKD and development of cardiovascular disease. IκB,
  inhibitor of NF-κB.
