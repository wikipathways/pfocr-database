caption: Signaling pathways that induce epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β might affect both Smad-dependent and -independent pathways.
  Smad2 and Wnt activate the Notch signaling pathway. The Notch receptor is cleaved,
  and subsequently the Notch intracellular domain (NIC) translocates into the nucleus.
  The role of this protein shifts from that of a repressor to an activator through
  binding to DNA-binding proteins, such as CBF1, Su (H) and LAG-1. Wnt signaling is
  initiated through the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β. β-Catenin
  subsequently enters the nucleus and forms a complex with lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell
  factor to control the expression of target genes. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
  has a critical role in the induction of these intermediates. PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase.
