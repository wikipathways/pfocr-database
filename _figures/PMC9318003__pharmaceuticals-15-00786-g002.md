caption: Metformin effects in the interplay between EGFR, IGFR, and AMPK pathways.
  Mutated EGFR and IGF pathways can increase PI3K activity, through activation of
  PKB/AKT, stimulating the rest of the pathway, and, also, these kinases can promote
  the glycolytic cell phenotype through HIF1α expression by the stimulation of mTOR
  and its downstream effectors. This effect promotes the translocation and increasing
  the expression of GLUT1 and HKs, giving cells a greater glycolytic potential. When
  metformin treatment is incorporated by OCTs, it can inhibit mTOR activity through
  AMPK activation, increasing TSC2/RHEB function, and these processes can attenuate
  protein synthesis that is promoted by mTOR and its effectors. LKB1 can also increase
  its activity through calcium-dependent processes or through the influence of SIRT1.
  LKB1 activation leads to increased AMPK activity associated with an inhibition of
  membrane EGFR and IGFR activity, and metformin has also shown direct inhibition
  of expression of both transmembrane receptors. (Created with BioRender.com).
