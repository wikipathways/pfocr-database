caption: Possible and known applications of diclofenac. Diclofenac can act as an analgesic
  agent by activating transient outward potassium channels in neurons and simultaneously
  reducing the production of prostaglandins. Diclofenac can also act as a potent inhibitor
  of oligomerization of β-amyloid fibrils and plaque formation, which can be used
  in the development of therapies for diseases involving amyloid aggregation. Alternatively,
  diclofenac also interferes with the activation of glial cells, which may further
  contribute to its neuroprotective properties. Diclofenac has both inhibitory and
  inducing effects on cell death under different conditions. Endoplasmic reticulum
  stress generated by thapsigargin leads to activation of caspases and causes mitochondrial
  depolarization. Diclofenac suppresses the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by interfering
  with caspase activation and mitochondrial depolarization. On the other hand, diclofenac
  treatment can result in proteasomal dysfunction generating downstream apoptotic
  signals such as mitochondrial cytochrome c release, causing stimulation of caspases
  leading to apoptosis. The pathway shown under dotted dual faced arrow curve in the
  top right shows the role of diclofenac in the inhibition of β-amyloid fibrils and
  plaque formation. The activation/formation and inhibition are depicted with arrows
  and blunt heads, respectively. The green color coding on arrows and blunt ends depicts
  the cell survival, whereas, the red color indicates cell death promoting signals.
