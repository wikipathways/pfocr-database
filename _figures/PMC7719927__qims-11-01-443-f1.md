caption: The MAPK signaling pathway and NF-κB signaling pathway are mediated by LIPUS
  through TLR to regulate inflammatory responses. When exposed to LIPUS, the TLR/MyD88
  complex is inhibited. The down-streaming signaling pathways (NF-κB and MAPK signaling
  pathways) are also suppressed. These changes lead to the decrease of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and so on. LIPUS, low intensity pulsed ultrasound;
  TLR, toll-like receptor; MYD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; MAPKs, mitogen-activated
  protein kinases; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; IL-1β,
  interleukin-1β; IL-6, interleukin-6.
