caption: A model of RCS-mediated carbonylation processes in the hormonal signaling
  pathway in guard cells. ABA or MeJA induced the production of ROS by NAD(P)H oxidases
  (RbohD and RbohF) located on the plasma membrane in the guard cells. The RCS derived
  from the oxidation of membrane lipids by ROS trigger the activation of Ca2+-permeable
  cation channels in the plasma membrane, which initiates the elevation of the cytosolic
  free Ca2+ concentration through Ca2+ influx from the apoplast and the intracellular
  stores. RCS likely induce the carbonylation of an unknown protein target upstream
  of the calcium channels. CPK6 is a positive regulator of ABA- or MeJA-induced stomatal
  closure, whereas CDPK6, an isozyme of CPK6, is responsible for the regulation of
  Ica channels in ABA- or MeJA-induced stomatal closure. The increase in cytosolic
  Ca2+ is sensed by CDPKs and CPK6 and results in the activation of the S-type anion
  channels and stomatal closure. GSH is a negative regulator of ABA or MeJA signaling
  in the guard cell-induced stomatal closure by depletion of intracellular levels
  of GSH. This model is based on the previous studies from the literature [,,,,,,,].
