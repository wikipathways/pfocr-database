caption: 'The AHR signaling pathway. Prior to ligand binding, the AHR (Aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor) is located in the cytoplasm as a complex comprising menu proteins, including
  Hsp90 (Heat shock protein 90), XAP2: (Hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2),
  p23, and Src Kinase. Upon entry of the ligand-AHR into the nucleus, the associated
  proteins are dissociated, and the ligand-AHR complex binds to the ARNT (Aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor nuclear translocator,), which, in turn, binds to the AHRE (Aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor responsive elements) on the CYP1A1 promoter, leading to transcriptional
  activation of CYP1A1 and other phase II genes.'
