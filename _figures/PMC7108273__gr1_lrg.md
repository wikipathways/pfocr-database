caption: Scheme of targeting CoV and IFV infection by host-based repurposed drugs.
  CoV entry into cells relies on either a nonendosomal pathway or the endosomal pathway
  involving the host protease TMPRSS2 or the host adapter protein clathrin, respectively.
  IFV entry utilizes the endosomal pathway or the macropinocytic pathway. These pathways
  render the release of vRNA into the cytoplasm, followed by importing vRNA into the
  nucleus for viral replication. The host protein kinases Raf, Mek, Erk and CDKs have
  important roles in regulation of transcription and translation at various stages
  of viral replication. CoV and IFV utilize the host eIF-involved cap-dependent translational
  machinery to produce viral proteins. Activation of the host protein kinases PKR,
  PERK, HRI and GCN2 can phosphorylate the eIF2α to attenuate translation. Assembly
  of viral particles requires the host TMPRSS2 for cleavage of CoV spike and IFV HA
  in the Golgi apparatus to produce viral progeny to be released by budding. In addition,
  the NF-κB pathway is activated through inactivation of IκBa to induce proinflammatory
  cytokines, such as IFNs, for innate immune response to viral infection. These host-based
  pathways are targetable by repurposed agents to control viral infection. Representative
  repurposed drugs have a pink background. Green thick arrows indicate induction.
  Green thick stop signs indicate inhibition. Scissor signs indicate proteolytic cleavage.
