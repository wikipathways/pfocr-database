caption: In the presence of insulin/growth factor, all the growth factor binds with
  the receptor and activates the PI3K/AKT/SGK pathway. AKT and SGK phosphorylates
  the FOXO at different sites, and upon phosphorylation, it binds with 14-3-3 protein.
  The binding of 14-3-3 protein with phosphoryated FOXO helps FOXO translocate form
  nucleus to cytoplasm.
