caption: Biosynthesis of bacterial lipoproteins. (A to C) Two-step biosynthetic pathway
  in Gram-positive bacteria. (A to D) Three-step biosynthetic pathway in Gram-negative
  bacteria. (A) The precursor of lipoproteins is the preprolipoprotein, with an N-terminal
  signal peptide possessing a characteristic consensus sequence of the lipobox. (B)
  During lipoprotein maturation, the thiol group of the invariant cysteine in the
  lipobox is modified by a diacylglyceryl moiety by lipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase
  (Lgt), which serves as a membrane anchor. (C) After lipidation, lipoprotein signal
  peptidase (Lsp) cleaves the signal peptide, leaving the cysteine as the new amino-terminal
  residue forming the mature lipoprotein in Gram-positive bacteria. (D) In Gram-negative
  and some Gram-positive bacteria, the mature lipoprotein has an additional amide-linked
  fatty acid at the N-terminal cysteine residue attached by lipoprotein N-acyl transferase
  (Lnt). Amino acid residues at position +2, +3, and +4 have a role in membrane localization
  of Gram-negative bacterial lipoproteins.
