caption: Overview of apoptosis signaling pathway that contains effective therapeutic
  targets in lymphoma. The naturally occurring apoptosis pathway functions through
  extrinsic and intrinsic signaling and is controlled by a series of highly conserve
  molecules. Interfering pathologic apoptosis pathway and restoring its normal function
  seem to have therapeutic potential in many types of cancer. Among these therapeutic
  targets, BCL2, MYC, and p53 might be the suitable target candidates. FasL, Fas ligand;
  TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; FADD, fas associated
  via death domain; TRADD, TNFRSF1A associated via death domain; BID, BH3 interacting
  domain death agonist; tBID, truncated BID; BAX, BCL2 associated X; BCL2, B-cell
  lymphoma 2; BAK, BCL2 antagonist/killer; Myc, v-Myc avian myelocytomatosis viral
  oncogene homolog; ARF, alternate open reading frame; MDM2, mouse double-minute 2
  protein; ATR, Ataxia telangiectasia and Rads-related protein; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated; chk2, checkpoint kinase 2.
