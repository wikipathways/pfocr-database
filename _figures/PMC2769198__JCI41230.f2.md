caption: As shown by Bornstein et al. in their study in this issue of the JCI (),
  attenuated Smad4 levels in HNSCC lead to genomic instability, upregulation of phosphorylated
  R-Smad3 (R-Smad3-PP), excessive Ras activation (through overexpression or mutation),
  increased production of TGF-βs, and enhanced inflammation. In theory, oncogenic
  Ras can enhance Smad4 degradation (red line), and ligands such as EGF or HGF can
  activate the Ras/MAKP pathway to further modulate Smad4 function. The net result
  is altered transcriptional regulation of numerous genes leading to enhanced cancer
  spread and metastasis.
