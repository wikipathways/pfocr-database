caption: Functional biased pattern of gene loss by coelimination of genes of the retinoic
  acid metabolic gene network (RA-MGN). The losses of the genes Rdh10, Rdh16, Bco1,
  Aldh1a, and Cyp26 occurred in a context of low mutational robustness with no compensatory
  rerouting for the synthesis of atRA by any alternative pathway, and likely in an
  scenario of regressive evolution in which the loss of RA-signaling and its nuclear
  receptor genes (e.g., RAR, PPAR) did not imply major phenotypic changes related
  to RA-target genes, such as Hox1 that show the same expression pattern in Oikopleura
  dioica and ascidians.
