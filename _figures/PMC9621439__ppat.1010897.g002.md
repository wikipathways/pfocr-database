caption: (A) In a simplified mammalian immune pathway, the innate immune pathway is
  OFF in the resting state, especially as indicated by no nuclear NF-κB-dependent
  transcription of immune genes. In the pathogen-induced state—either via activation
  of TLRs or cGAS-STING—the nuclear translocation of active NF-κB leads to rapid and
  robust activation of immune effector genes. (B) In many basal invertebrates, in
  the resting state, it appears that there is constitutive activation of the NF-κB
  pathway, either due to resident microbes or presumably chronic exposure to microbes
  in marine environments. An acute exposure to pathogens can lead to a hyperimmune
  state, which is characterized by further nuclear translocation of NF-κB, as well
  as increased transcription of innate immune pathway components (indicated by the
  larger TLR and NF-κB fonts in the right half of the figure). Further details can
  be found in the text.
