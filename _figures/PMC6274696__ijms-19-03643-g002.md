caption: Transcriptional regulation network of the genes involved in ABA production
  and inactivation. Transcription factors in upper half of the nucleus positively
  contribute ABA content while transcription factors in the lower half play the opposite
  role. In nucleus, green and blue lines show promoter region of the related genes,
  arrow heads (brown) and end lines (blue) indicate positive and negative regulation,
  respectively. Green and blue dotted arrows represent nuclear export of the mRNA
  involved in ABA production and inactivation, respectively. Brown dotted arrow from
  cytosol to nucleus indicates an unknown pathway. In cytosol, green arrow indicates
  ABA catabolic pathway. In plastid, green arrows and dotted arrows represent ABA
  one-step and multi-step biosynthetic pathway, respectively. In ER, green arrow indicates
  ABA glycosylation pathway. ER, endoplasmic Reticulum.
