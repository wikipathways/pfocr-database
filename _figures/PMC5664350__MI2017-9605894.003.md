caption: Summary of intracellular TLR4 signalling pathways in nucleated cells. LPS
  is transferred to CD14 (or albumin), via a process involving LBP and albumin, which
  transfers LPS to TLR4:MD-2 to complete the heterotetramerisation. There are two
  major signalling pathways, namely, the MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways,
  for TLR4 signalling. In the MyD88-dependent pathway, TIRAP (or Mal) enables MyD88
  binding to TLR4 and formation of the Myddosome, which contains MyD88, IRAK4, and
  IRAK1/2. The kinases found at the base of the Myddosome activate TRAF6 and TAK1
  followed by the activation of NEMO and its associated kinases. IKKβ stimulates the
  degradation of inhibitory IκB, which leads to nuclear translocation of NF-κB and
  transcription of proinflammatory genes. In addition, TAK1 activates JNK1/2, ERK1/2,
  and p38, which can then stimulate the transcription factor AP-1. In the MyD88-independent
  pathway, following CD14-dependent internalisation into the endosomes, TRAM and TRIF
  are recruited to TLR4 before activating TRAF3. Activation of TRAF3 activates TBK1
  and IKKε, which phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor IRF3 that stimulates
  the transcription of anti-inflammatory cytokines.
