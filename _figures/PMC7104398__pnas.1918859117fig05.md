caption: A graphical summary of changes in energy and metabolism in SimCells (I-CeuI+
  strains). Elements in red indicate up-regulation of proteins, while elements in
  blue indicate down-regulation of proteins. Cells favored sections of the glycolysis
  and pentose phosphate pathway that produced ATP/NADH, while the sections that consumed
  ATP were down-regulated. The TCA cycle was largely shut down. Fermentation and respiration
  regenerated NAD+ to be fed back to the glycolysis pathway. The complexes that were
  up-regulated to generate the proton gradient are shown (other complexes were down-regulated).
  The resulting proton gradient should drive ATP synthase to produce ATP for the energy-starved
  cell.
