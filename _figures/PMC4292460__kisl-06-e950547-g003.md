caption: Possible pathways of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling in pancreatic β-cells. Following
  interaction of IL-4 with its cognate receptors, Jak kinases are phosphorylated.
  This leads to the recruitment and activation of STAT6 and to activation of the PtdIns-3K/Akt
  pathway. IL-13 also activates both the STAT6 and PI-3K/Akt pathways but there is
  evidence that STAT3 may also become phosphorylated. IL-4 and IL-13 induced cytoprotection
  is probably mediated via STAT6 and the extent of phosphorylation of this molecule
  is also regulated by PTP-BL. The functional consequences of IL-13-induced STAT3
  phosphorylation are unclear. In addition, the increase in Akt phosphorylation mediated
  by IL-13 is not obligatory for cytoprotection.
