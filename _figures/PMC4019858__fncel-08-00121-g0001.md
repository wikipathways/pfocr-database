caption: 'Schematic illustrating the pro-nociceptive mechanism of CatS/FKN signaling
  in the spinal dorsal horn during neuropathic pain. (A–B) In the dorsal horn area
  innervated by damaged fibers (Panel A) microglia transform from a surveillance state
  into a reactive state following exposure to injury induced factors released by primary
  afferent terminals, including Adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP; Panel B). (C) High concentrations
  of extracellular ATP leads to P2X7 receptor activation on microglia (1), which ultimately
  leads to the release of CatS. A decrease in intracellular potassium concentration
  following efflux through the P2X7 receptor activates phospholipase C (PLC), resulting
  in an increase in intracellular calcium and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. P38 phosphorylation
  then allows phospholipase A2 (PLA2) mediated translocation of CatS containing lysosomes
  to the cell membrane, whereby exocytosis releases CatS into the extracellular space
  (2). Extracellular CatS is then able to cleave membrane bound FKN from dorsal horn
  neurons, liberating soluble FKN (sFKN) (3). (D) sFKN feeds back onto the microglial
  cells via the CX3CR1 receptor (4) to further activate the p38 MAPK pathway and release
  inflammatory mediators, (5) that activate neurons and result in chronic pain. Abbreviations:
  DRG, dorsal root ganglia, cPLA2, cytosolic PLA2.'
