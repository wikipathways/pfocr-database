caption: The main phase I metabolic pathway of 4F-MDMB-BINACA based on findings in
  the ZF larvae model (a) and from human screening (b). In panel (b), red arrows indicate
  results from human blood samples, and blue arrows indicate results from human urine
  samples. Metabolites in blue represent molecules not detected in the respective
  model. Four metabolites (M7, M8, M13, and M14) were not detected in the microinjected
  ZF larvae despite the detection of M3 and M10 as their following sequential metabolites.
  In contrast, terminal metabolites M1, M2, and M12 and a cross-connection between
  M3 and M4 were not found in human samples.
