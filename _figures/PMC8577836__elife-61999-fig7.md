caption: RNA-containing TEV is incorporated into the endosomes in dendritic cells
  (DCs), where phosphatidylserine (PS) on TEV binds to CD300a and inhibits the TLR3–TRIF–IRF3
  signaling pathway initiated by TEV-derived RNA binding to TLR3, resulting in the
  decrease in interferon-β (IFN-β) production by DCs and the number of tumor-infiltrating
  Treg cells. The Treg cells regulate tumor development.
