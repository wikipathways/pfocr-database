caption: NKG2D/NKG2DL interaction activates NK cells. The activating receptor NKG2D
  can directly bind to a diverse family of ligand molecules expressed on the surface
  of tumor cells. In NK cells, NKG2D interacts with either DAP10 (both human and mouse)
  or DAP12 (mouse only) and induces cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production. DAP10/YXXM-mediated
  signaling regulates NK cell cytotoxicity via the Grb2 and PI3K pathway, while the
  NKG2D-DAP12 complex is involved in IFN-γ production through the Syk and ZAP70 pathway.
