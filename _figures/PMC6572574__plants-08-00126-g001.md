caption: 'Possible biosynthetic pathway of sulfur amino acids in seed of the common
  bean. Solid arrows indicate steps taking place in seeds based on gene expression
  analysis. Multiple arrows refer to multiple steps. Broken arrows represent hypothetical
  steps. Metabolites in boxes are related to S-methylcysteine and were profiled in
  this study. The predominant pathway of cysteine biosynthesis in seed is cytosolic
  and BSAS4;1 is the main cytosolic cysteine synthase expressed in seed. Formation
  of free S-methylcysteine by cysteine synthase is inferred from data in Arabidopsis.
  The presence of S-methylhomoglutathione suggests a pathway similar to that of the
  S-alk(enyl) sulfoxides in Allium leading to the formation of γ–glutamyl-S-methylcysteine
  (see text for details). OAS: O-acetylserine; γ–Glu-Cys, γ-glutamylcysteine; γ–Glu-S-methylCys,
  γ–glutamyl-S-methylcysteine; S-methyl-hGSH, S-methylhomoglutathione; BSAS4;1, β-substituted
  alanine synthase 4;1; PCS2, phytochelatin synthase 2; GCL1, glutamate–cysteine ligase
  1; hGS, homoglutathione synthetase; MGL, methionine γ-lyase.'
