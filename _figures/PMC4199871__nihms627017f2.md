caption: In the absence of an upstream ligand, receptor Frizzled (FZD) and co-receptor
  LRP5/6 are inactive (1). The cytoplasmic β-catenin will be recruited into a “destruction
  complex” consisting of Axin, APC, casein kinase 1a (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase
  3 (GSK3) (2). This “destruction complex” facilitates the phosphorylation of β-catenin
  by GSK3 and subsequent ubiquitinylation (Ub) by β-TrCP, an E3 ligase, targeting
  β-catenin for proteasome-mediated degradation. In this context, the transcription
  repressor Groucho occupies T-Cell Factor/Lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) DNA
  binding sites (7). This inactive state could also be caused by lack of co-receptors
  availability due to effectors (DKK1/WISE/SOST) binding to LRP5/6 and preventing
  its association with Wnt (3), or by other effectors associating with Wnts and blocking
  their ability to interact with the co-receptor complex (4). When a Wnt ligand engages
  the receptor complex (5), the C-terminus of LRP5/6 is phosphorylated, creating a
  binding site for Axin, resulting in inhibition of the destruction complex (6). This
  inhibits GSK3 activity, allowing cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin to increase (8).
  β-catenin subsequently translocates into the nucleus and complexes with LEF/TCF
  proteins and other co-factors to activate transcription of target genes (9).
