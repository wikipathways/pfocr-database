caption: EP3 mediated signaling (adapted with kind permission from O’callaghan, G.;
  Houston, A.; 2015; reference []). EP3 has multiple isoforms, most of which are coupled
  with the inhibitory G-protein Gi that acts by inhibiting AC-cAMP-PKA pathway. Those
  coupled with Gs stimulate AC-cAMP-PKA pathway. Those coupled with G12/13 are involved
  in Rho family GTPase signaling utilized in cell migration by cytoskeleton remodeling.
