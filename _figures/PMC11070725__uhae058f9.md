caption: Working model of PgbHLH28 in the regulation of saponin biosynthesis in P.
  grandiflorus. PgbHLH28 specifically binds with the promoters of the key structural
  genes involved in saponin biosynthesis (including PgDXS2 and PgHMGR2) and activates
  their transcription, resulting in enhanced saponin accumulation in P. grandiflorus.
  Furthermore, intermediate products produced by both the MVA and MEP pathways can
  be utilized in both pathways via transmembrane transport
