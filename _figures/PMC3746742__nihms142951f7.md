caption: Model of the mechanism by which the EGF-induced DMR signal is mediated in
  UPCI-37B SCCHN cells and its application for HTS of EGFR pathway inhibitors. The
  PI3K/Akt (solid arrow), but not Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (dotted arrow) pathway, mediates
  the EGF-induced DMR signal in UPCI-37B SCCHN cells. Our established cell-based optical
  signature assay is a novel approach for the discovery of inhibitors targeting the
  EGFR signaling pathway through HTS.
