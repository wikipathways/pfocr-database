caption: Schematic model of cyclin E-associated kinase activity as an integrative
  convergence point for the regulation of G1/S transition by the “classic” pRb/E2F
  and the “parallel” Myc-dependent pathways in mammalian cells (thick arrows). Mitogenic
  signals lead to inactivation of pRb and release of E2F and to activation of Myc.
  The resulting transcriptional activities may independently contribute to cyclin
  E and Cdc25A expression, thereby inducing cyclin E-CDK2 activity, which stimulates
  DNA synthesis (see text for details). This model appears to be part of a more complex
  setting in which E2F may further control the S phase by inducing other downstream
  targets involved in DNA replication (Cdc6, MCM1 to MCM7, cyclin A, etc.), whereas
  Myc may control cyclin E-CDK2 activity also indirectly through functional inactivation
  of CKIs (thin arrows). The role played by Myc downstream targets other than cyclin
  E and Cdc25A in S-phase induction remains to be defined (dotted arrow). Also, the
  possibility that E2F and Myc stimulate each other's expression and activity cannot
  be ruled out.
