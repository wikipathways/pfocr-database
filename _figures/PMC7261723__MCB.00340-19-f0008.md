caption: Proposed model for the role of Isc1 and Cdc55 in the HU-induced signaling
  pathway. When cells are treated with HU, a checkpoint signal would be activated
  through the SLPS genes. SLPS genes transmit the signal to Isc1, which produces C18:1
  phytoceramides, which functions as a signal to directly activate Cdc55 and thus
  its downstream targets Cdc16, Cdc23, Cdc27, Cdc14, Net1, Clb2, and Clb5 or inhibit
  SWE1 kinase and its target Cdc28 kinase. Cdc55 phosphatase activity controls Cdc28
  and APC/cdc20 activity through its multiple downstream targets. Swe1 can act directly
  on the activation of Cdc28, which then acts on APC/cdc20, with the latter triggering
  chromatid separation through pds1 (securin), Esp1 (separase), and cohesin cleavage.
  Separase can also regulate INCENP (Sli15)-Aurora B (Ipl1) anaphase spindle function
  through Cdc14 released from Net1 entrapment in the nucleolus. Cdc14 dephosphorylates
  Sli15 and thereby directs the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) to the spindle
  midzone and away from kinetochores. Dam1, part of the DASH complex, couples the
  kinetochores to spindle microtubules. Dam1 is directly activated by Ipl1 phosphorylation
  and is essential for proper chromosome segregation. Dam1 interacts with another
  mitotic spindle protein, She1. Kin4 is activated by Elm1 kinase, it inhibits the
  mitotic exit network (MEN), and it prevents cell cycle progression when the spindle
  position checkpoint (SPOC) is activated. SLSP proteins are highlighted in blue,
  Csm3-related proteins in red. Potential Cdc55 substrates, identified in our phosphoproteomics
  study, are highlighted in green.
