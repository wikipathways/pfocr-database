caption: 'Overview of biosynthetic pathways of antiviral natural products discussed
  in this review. (a) Production of aromatic compounds including flavonoids (magenta),
  phenol derivatives (indigo), and others (purple). Note, DNJ is not aromatics but
  belongs to the piperidine alkaloid family. (b) Production of terpenoids (green).
  MEP pathway is used by bacterial hosts, whereas MVA pathway is used by eukaryotes.
  (c) Production of the antibiotic ivermectin B1a (grey). (d) Production of the polyketide-terpenoid
  mycophenolic acid (orange). Abbreviations: ANTA, anthranilate; CHA, chorismate;
  DAHP, 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate; DHMP, 3,5-dihydroxy-6-methylphthalide;
  DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; DMMPA, demethylmycophenolic acid; E4P, erythrose
  4-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; FDHMP, 4-farnesyl-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methylphthalide;
  FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; G3P, glucose 3-phosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate;
  GPP, geranyl pyrophosphate; HPP, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvare; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate;
  l-Phe, l-phenylalanine; l-Trp, l-tryptophan; l-Tyr, l-tyrosine; MEP, 2-C-methylerythritol-4-phosphate;
  MVA, mevalonate; 5-MOA, 5-methylorsellinic acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PPA,
  prephenate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; PPY, phenylpyruvate; SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine.'
