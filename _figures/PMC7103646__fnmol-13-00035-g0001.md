caption: 'IAPP on physiological and pathological contexts and (poly)phenols-mediated
  protection. (A) In healthy conditions, IAPP is co-secreted with insulin to regulate
  glucose metabolism and homeostasis in a post-meal condition. Several functions are
  attributed to IAPP: slowing down gastric emptying, thereby reducing food intake
  and body weight; reducing glucose output from liver and glucagon secretion; and
  stimulating the renin-angiotensin system, vasodilation, and blood glucose uptake.
  (B) In disease conditions, IAPP pathological species deposit in the pancreas and
  in brain microvasculature where they induce the injury of small vessels and reach
  the brain parenchyma. In the brain environment, IAPP forms heterogeneous deposits
  with Aβ molecules increasing neurotoxicity. Proteostasis imbalance caused by Aβ/IAPP
  and tau may promote a set of molecular changes that culminate in glucose homeostasis
  dysregulation, cell death, and neurodegeneration. The molecular pathways of β-cell
  dysfunction are depicted: autophagy dysregulation; ER stress; UPP overload; membrane
  instability; and mitochondrial damage. (C) Protection mediated by (poly)phenols
  is associated with the stabilization of IAPP monomers, the remodeling of amyloids,
  protofibrils, and toxic oligomers to non-fibrillogenic “off-pathway” oligomers and
  monomers. Aβ, Amyloid beta; ER, Endoplasmic Reticulum; IAPP, Islet Amyloid Polypeptide;
