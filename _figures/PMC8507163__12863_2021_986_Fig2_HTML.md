caption: The network of common pathways. Each node represents the pathway, the size
  and the color depth of each node indicate the number of common core miRNAs between
  COPD and NSCLC in that pathway; also, the thickness of an edge in this network represents
  the number of shared miRNAs between the two pathways. P53 signaling, cell cycle,
  and non-small cell lung cancer pathways have the highest number of common miRNAs
  between COPD and NSCLC, in which the number of core miRNAs in p53 signaling, cell
  cycle, and non-small cell lung cancer pathways are 15, 15, and 10, respectively
