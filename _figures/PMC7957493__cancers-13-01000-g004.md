caption: 'Mutations in components of niche-signalling pathways lead to “ISC emancipation”
  and subversion of homeostatic mechanisms. “ISC emancipation”, whereby ISCs gain
  autonomy from niche signalling, arises when a mutation either negates ISC dependence
  on pro-proliferative and pro-survival niche signals, or enables ISCs to evade growth-inhibitory
  stimuli. From right to left: Amplification of EGFR, activating mutations in KRAS
  (KRASG12D), BRAF (BRAFV600E), or PIK3CA (which encodes PI3K), and PTEN loss-of-function
  mutations can stimulate MEK/ERK signalling, leading to increased proliferation and
  survival. The aberrant activation of Wnt signalling during CRC progression is associated
  with: (1) RSPO2/3 gene fusions that elevate RSPO levels in the TME, (2) epigenetic
  silencing of genes encoding secreted Wnt antagonists (WNT-ligand antagonists: SFRP1–5
  and WIF1; WNT-receptor antagonists: DKK1–4), (3) loss-of-function mutations in negative
  feedback regulators of the Wnt pathway, such as APC, ZNRF3, RNF43, or Axin2, or
  (4) activating mutations in CTNNB1 (which encodes β-catenin). The pro-proliferative
  Wnt-target genes MYC and CCND1 are typically overexpressed, whereas ISC-associated
  genes are often methylated in aggressive human tumours. Mutations in KRAS or APC
  correlate with increased crypt fission. Often found in human polyposis syndromes,
  disruption of BMP gradients (through overexpression of GREM1 or the acquisition
  of mutations in BMPR1A) leads to the formation of ectopic crypts and polyps. SMAD4
  deletion/mutation and/or deregulated TGFβ signalling are further associated with
  niche independence, EMT, metastasis, and therapy resistance. An inflammatory drive
  exacerbates tumour progression, with activated CAFs and infiltrating tumour-associated
  populations elaborating multiple cytokines, including TGFβ, IL11, HGF, OPN, SDF1,
  and IL17A, which stimulate Wnt/β-catenin signalling and confer aggressive traits.
  Activation of Notch signalling in advanced tumours is associated with elevated levels
  of NOTCH1 and HES1, and inactivation of FBXW7, impairing NICD degradation. The Notch
  and BMP pathways synergize in a SMAD5-dependent manner to induce EMT, and BMPs activate
  Wnt/β-catenin signalling in the context of SMAD4-deficiency. Grey colouring indicates
  suppression/inactivation, multiplicity of symbols and/or red denote aberrant upregulation/activation,
  asterisks signify unspecified mutations, and circled P indicates phosphorylation.
  Solid arrows indicate direct activation, dashed arrows signify multiple intermediary
  steps, and lines ending with a bar denote inhibition. CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts;
  ECM, extracellular matrix; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.'
