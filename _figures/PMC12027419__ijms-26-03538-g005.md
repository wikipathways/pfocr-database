caption: 'Identification of key players in burn injury-related REC network. KEGG Pathview
  analysis of the molecular signature of the REC signaling pathway in burn injury
  compared to control. This analysis illustrates the pre- and postsynaptic components
  of REC signaling at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The KEGG pathway analysis
  indicates that burn injury leads to the upregulation or downregulation of multiple
  components in the REC pathway. Each box represents a certain gene family or a single
  gene, with color indicating the log2-based fold change. Gene expression levels are
  shown as higher (red), unchanged (green), or lower (blue) in burn-injured samples
  compared to non-treated controls. The synaptic vesicle cycle shows downregulation
  in presynaptic terminals, regardless of the functional nature of the synapse. On
  the other hand, oxidative phosphorylation was typically upregulated in the axon
  terminals in response to burn injury. Abbreviations: CB1R, cannabinoid receptor
  type 1; VGCCs, voltage-gated calcium channels; GIRKs, inwardly rectifying potassium
  channels'
