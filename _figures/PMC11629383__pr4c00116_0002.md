caption: 'Truncated yet functional NOTCH2NL genes. A. Emergence of the NOTCH2NL genes
  (yellow) started from a partial duplication of the NOTCH2 gene (green) in the last
  common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. This partial duplication yielded
  a pseudogene fusing the PDE4DIP gene and the duplicated first exons of NOTCH2. Then,
  unique to the human lineage, the pseudogene is thought to have been recycled through
  ectopic gene conversion, thereby regaining the NOTCH2 promoter and first exon. This
  first NOTCH2NL gene duplicated itself twice more to yield the 3 copies existing
  today. B. The NOTCH2 protein is a receptor for membrane-bound ligands like Delta-1
  (DLL1). The protein contains a N-terminal domain, 36 EGF-like repeats, a juxtamembrane
  negative regulatory region (NRR), a protein-binding domain (RAM), ankyrin repeats
  (ANK), a Notch cytokine response region (NCR), a transcriptional activation domain
  (TAD), and C-terminal PEST domain enriched in proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine.146NOTCH2NLB,
  the most expressed NOTCH2NL gene, encodes a protein that has an N-terminal domain,
  6 EGF-like repeats, and a C-terminal domain. This heavily truncated copy of NOTCH2
  is secreted in the intercellular space and binds to NOTCH2 EGF-like repeats, thereby
  decreasing free DLL1 and upregulating the Noch signaling pathway. C. Quiescent neural
  stem cells (NSC) undergo asymmetrical self-renewal: one daughter cell returns to
  the stem cell state, while the other differentiates into a neural progenitor cell
  (NPC). NOTCH2NL is one of the drivers of the clonal expansion of cortical cortical
  progenitors'
