caption: Common mechanisms of developmental regulation by miRNAs. (A) miRNAs modulate
  proliferation of differentiating cells by targeting either positive or negative
  cell-cycle regulators. (B) miRNAs act in regulatory loops to ensure complete commitment
  to specific cell lineages during development. (C) Multiple lineage-promoting miRNAs
  can converge on a single pathway to cooperatively regulate cell fate. (D) miRNAs
  act in regulatory loops with self-renewal genes to maintain the balance between
  progenitor cells and their differentiated progeny. (Adapted from .)
