caption: Deubiquitinases functioning in asthma pathology. The deubiquitinating enzyme
  Ubiquitin specific protease 10 (USP10) can inhibit the degradation of T-bet by removing
  the ubiquitin residues connected to T-bet, thereby promoting the proliferation and
  differentiation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and ultimately promoting the development
  of airway inflammation. Similarly, Ubiquitin specific protease 38 (USP38) promotes
  T helper 2 (Th2) cell proliferation and differentiation by inhibiting JunB ubiquitination
  and degradation. Ubiquitin specific protease (USP4) can promote the development
  of airway inflammation by promoting the proliferation of Th2 and T helper 17 (Th17)
  cells and inhibiting the proliferation of Treg cells. Ubiquitin specific protease
  25 (USP25) inhibits airway inflammation by promoting BRCA1 Associated RING Domain
  1 (BARD1), which in turn inhibits the secretion of inflammatory factors Interleukin-13
  (IL-13), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α), Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-8 (IL-8).
  Ubiquitin specific protease 21 (USP21) can inhibit the ubiquitination of GATA Binding
  Protein 3 (GATA3), thereby increasing the expression of GATA3, promoting the function
  of Treg, and ultimately inhibiting airway inflammation. A20, as a common deubiquitinating
  enzyme, can inhibit the expression of GATA3, thereby inhibiting the proliferation
  and differentiation of Th2 cells, and then inhibiting airway inflammation. Cylindromatosis
  (CYLD) can inhibit the ubiquitination and degradation of Nuclear Factor Kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  (NF-κB), thereby activating the NF-κB inflammatory pathway and promoting airway
  inflammation. OTU domain-containing ubiquitin aldehyde-binding protein 1 (OTUB1)
  promotes the formation of inflammasome by inhibiting the ubiquitination and degradation
  of Tumor necrosis factor Receptor-Associated Factors (TRAF3), which ultimately promotes
  airway inflammation. BRCA1/BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3 (BRCC3) inhibits the
  activation of NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3)
  inflammasome by reducing the ubiquitination level of NLRP3, thereby reducing airway
  inflammation in asthma
