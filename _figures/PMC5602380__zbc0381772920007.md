caption: Model of the calcineurin–NFAT signaling pathway and the potential role of
  CEFIP. A model diagram depicts the cardiac localization and function of CEFIP. CEFIP
  is localized to the z-disc and plays an important role in calcineurin–NFAT signaling.
  CEFIP directly activates calcineurin, which in turn induces the expression of hypertrophic
  gene markers in cardiomyocytes via dephosphorylation of NFAT. Notably, CEFIP interacts
  and co-localizes with FHL2 that negatively regulates calcineurin signaling. However,
  FHL2 and CEFIP modulate calcineurin signaling in opposing and independent ways.
