caption: The two versions of reductive carboxylation that allow cells to circumvent
  the MAS (a). The cytosolic version, adapted from Reference . This picture is schematic;
  the malate and fumarate produced in the cytosol are in part exported from the cell.
  (b) The mitochondrial version, adapted from Reference . This picture is also schematic;
  the succinate produced must be transported from the mitochondria and the cell. The
  broken line indicates the mitochondrial membrane. 2‐OG, 2‐oxoglutarate; 6‐P‐Gluc‐NH2,
  glucosamine‐6‐P; Bis‐P‐Glyc, 1,2‐bis‐P‐Glycerate; F‐6‐P, fructose‐6‐P; GAP, glyceraldehyde‐3‐P;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; Pi, inorganic P
