caption: BCAA metabolism and tumours. BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, valine) are transported
  into the cell by LAT1 and catalysed by BCAT1 to produce BCKAs in the cytoplasm.
  After entering the mitochondria through the SLC25A44 transporter, BCKAs can be catalysed
  by BCAT2 for transamination and then undergo irreversible oxidative decarboxylation
  to generate branchchain acyl coenzymes through BCKDH, and then generate acetyl-CoA
  and succinyl-coenzyme A through a series of pathways to enter the TCA cycle for
  functional production. The activity of BCKDH is regulated by BCKDK and PPM1K. The
  phosphorylation of BCKDH by BCKDK inhibits BCKDH activity, whereas PPM1K dephosphorylates
  BCKDH and activates BCKDH. Elevated levels of LAT1-mediated BCAAs lead to the proliferation
  of HCC cells and drug resistance in breast cancer patients. GPRC5C increases the
  aggressiveness of AML through the NF-κB-LAT1. The LAT1 inhibitor JPH203.The BCAT1
  inhibitor EB and WQQ-345. The BCAT2 inhibitor 2-Aryl Benzimidazole
