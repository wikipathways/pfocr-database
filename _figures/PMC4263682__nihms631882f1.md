caption: 'An example of a cluster illustrating Ras activation. Ras signalling affects
  many cellular functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, fate
  specification, and differentiation. Ras is a membrane-anchored GTPase that is normally
  activated in response to the binding of extracellular ligands, such as epidermal
  growth factor (EGF), to a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), e.g. epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR). Under normal physiological conditions, the EGFR kinase domain
  is intrinsically autoinhibited. EGF binding to the extracellular domain transmits
  a signal which propagates through the transmembrane domain resulting in EGFR dimerization
  and activation. EGFR activation results from the formation of an asymmetric dimer
  in which the C-terminal lobe of one kinase domain plays a role analogous to that
  of cyclin in activated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/cyclin complexes (). Signalling
  proceeds through SHC-transforming protein 1 (SHC), Growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2 (Grb2) and Son of sevenless (SOS). SOS1, the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor (GEF) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related
  kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway, is recruited by the adaptor protein Grb2 in response
  to EGFR activation. Under physiological conditions, Ras is in its inactive GDP-bound
  state. GEF exchanges GDP for GTP and by so doing activates Ras. Active, GTP-loaded
  Ras binds monomeric Raf, thereby leading to Raf dimerization, which is the active
  form of Raf (see ). Ras activates a number of signalling pathways, including the
  Raf/MAPK kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Raf/MEK/ERK) pathway, the
  MEK kinase/SAPK-ERK kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase (MEKK/SEK/JNK) pathway, a phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) Akt for proliferation, and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) pathway
  which is mostly related to inflammation. There are three major Ras forms, K-Ras,
  H-Ras and N-Ras, which largely differ in their hypervariable region (HVR), and in
  their lipophilic post-translational modification (PTM) group, farnesyl, palmitoyl,
  prenyl, etc. Calmodulin inhibits K-Ras signalling, but not H-Ras or N-Ras. Ras cofactors,
  and proteins in their pathways, are partners of the Ras GTPase-activating-like protein
  (IQGAP1) scaffolding protein. IQGAP1 is a large multi-domain protein with tens of
  partners already identified. Cytoskeleton proteins actin and myosin, as well as
  other proteins, are also partners of IQGAP1. Some of these proteins are scaffolding
  proteins too, including actin which itself also has tens of partners. Further, like
  Ras, some of these proteins are also anchored in the membrane, including Raf (see
  ) and actin. Ras acts as a binary signal switch cycling between ON and OFF states.
  Ras returns to its OFF state via GTP→GDP hydrolysis with the help of the GTPase-activating
  protein (GAP). GDP-bound Ras is unable to bind its effectors. IQGAP1 binds to and
  regulates the function of numerous proteins. Over 90 proteins have been reported
  to associate with IQGAP1, directly or as part of a larger complex (). Most of the
  binding is to the IQ or C-terminal regions. Some proteins interact with expected
  binding motifs, such as actin to the CHD, and calmodulin and S100 to the IQ motifs.
  Unfortunately, no structure is available for complexes of any of IQGAP1 protein
  partners with the respective IQGAP1 domain. As the figure illustrates, IQGAP1 is
  also a scaffold in the MEK/ERK cascade. It binds to both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 and modulates
  their activation to proximal Raf. There are three Raf kinases, A-Raf, B-Raf and
  C-Raf. IQGAP1 binds B-Raf, except in the heart where it binds C-Raf. Together with
  binding Ca2+/calmodulin, it couples Ca2+ to the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. IQGAP1
  also binds directly to actin and promotes cross-linking of actin filaments. The
  dynamic cross-linking through IQGAP1, acting to both increase the effective local
  concentration and allosterically to coordinate function hints at how higher level
  cellular regulation takes place; in our case here, it also provides insight into
  how actin dynamically controls and is controlled by cluster molecules, such as Ras.
  A cluster consists of multiple copies of each of the proteins, and is highly dynamic
  persisting only sufficiently long for a burst of signalling activity to go through.
  Abbreviations used in the figure are: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; Cdc45, cell
  division control protein 42 homolog; Clip-170, cytoplasmic linker protein-170; Rac1,
  Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1; S100B, S100 calcium binding protein
