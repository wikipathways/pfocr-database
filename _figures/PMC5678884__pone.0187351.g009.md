caption: Adding KA causes mycelia to respond to injury faster by increasing the content
  of eATP (). The mycelial regeneration capacity is enhanced by increasing antioxidative
  enzyme activity (SOD and CAT) and antioxidants (GSH and AsA) () as well as the KA
  content (). KA also activates signaling pathways including the MAPK pathway (mapk),
  Ca2+signaling pathway (cam, cac, cpe), and oxylipin signaling pathway (phoa, phob,
  phoc and phod) (Figs  and ). In addition, pyk, gpd, lacc, and cel were up-regulated
  by KA (Figs  and ). The solid line indicates that the results were confirmed by
  transcriptomic analysis and experimental data; the dotted line indicates that the
  results were only confirmed by transcriptomic analysis.
