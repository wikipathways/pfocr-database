caption: Scheme of Campylobacter concisus-induced impairment of ENaC-dependent Na+
  absorption in colonic epithelial cells. In diarrheal state, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
  receptors (GR and MR) are activated by glucocorticoids (GC) like dexamethasone and
  mineralocorticoids (MC) like aldosterone respectively. GR and MR forms a heterodimer,
  binds to steroid-responsive element (SRE) and activates the expression of β/γ ENaC
  genes with the subsequent protein synthesis to enhance the electrogenic Na+ absorption.
  Butyrate inhibits histone deacetylation to intensify the expression of β/γ ENaC
  genes. GC (dexamethasone), MC (aldosterone) and butyrate were the activators of
  ENaC used in our experimental setup []. From the findings of our study, the red
  arrows in the figure represent C. concisus-induced transcriptional down-regulation
  or dysregulation of protein synthesis. The green arrows in the figure represent
  the transcriptional up-regulation and activation of signaling pathways (ERK pathway)
  by C. concisus. C. concisus promoted the transcriptional up-regulation of interleukin-32
  (IL-32), which might increase its protein expression (indicated by upward green
  arrow) and lead to activation of neural precursor cell expressed developmentally
  down-regulated protein (NEED4-2)-dependent ubiquitination of ENaC (via ERK) and
  impair ENaC-dependent Na+ absorption. The dotted green lines represent the predicted
  activation of IL-32 by upstream regulators IFN-γ, IL-1β and bacterial LPS (lipopolysaccharides),
  which could contribute to ERK activation leading to ENaC dysfunction in DBA-stimulated
  controls 48 h after C. concisus infection (bioinformatics prediction from RNA-Seq
  data by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software). The mRNA expression of NEED4-2
  in the HT-29/B6-GR/MR cell model is confirmed through RNA-Seq data. However, the
  regulation of NEDD4-2 via ERK1/2 and ubiquitination of ENaC which might lead to
  disassembly of ENaC subunits from epithelium is also a prediction through IPA. The
  reduction in claudin-8 protein expression by C. concisus is indicated by red color.
  The reduction in claudin-8 expression and protein redistribution perturbs the ionic
  paracellular barrier and leads to back leakage of Na+ into the apical side, contributing
  to the net loss of Na+.
