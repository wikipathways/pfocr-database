caption: Interactions between CAFs and CCA cells. CAFs release HGF, TGF-β1, HB-EGF
  and SDF-1 to enhance the malignant phenotype of CCA cells. HB-EGF, released by CAFs,
  can interact with EGFR on the plasma membrane of CCA cells to activate EGFR and
  stimulate ERK and STAT3, leading to the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and the
  disruption of adherens junction complexes with E-cadherin internalization, triggering
  a transcriptional program involved in tumor progression. CAF-derived SDF-1 binds
  to CXCR4 on CCA cells in a paracrine manner, which stimulates ERK1/2 and AKT signaling
  to increase the invasive ability of CCA. The HGF interaction with MET ligand expressed
  by CCA cells can activate ERK signaling pathway to accelerate tumor growth. PDGF-D
  released by CCA cells interacting with the cognate receptor PDGFRβ presenting in
  fibroblasts contributes to fibroblast aggregation. PDGF-D can stimulate fibroblast
  to secrete VEGF-A and VEGF-C, that increase the generation of tumor lymphangiogenesis
  pronouncedly and lead to invasion of tumor cells in lymphatic vessels. In turn,
  binding of CAF-secreted PDGF-BB to PDGFRβ in CCA cells can activate the Hedgehog
  signaling to promote tumor proliferation and metastasis. CCA, cholangiocarcinoma;
  CAF, cancer-associated fibroblasts; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding
  epidermal growth factor; SDF-1, stromal cell-derived factor-1; CXCR4, C-X-C chemokine
  receptor 4; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth
  factor.
