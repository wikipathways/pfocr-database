caption: Therapeutic strategies that have been used to target the TGF-β signaling
  pathway to reduce scarring. (1) Neutralizing TGF-β antibodies and (2) ligand traps
  bind TGF-β and neutralize TGF-β activity by preventing its binding to the TGF-β
  signaling receptors (TβRII and TβRI). (3) Small molecules that inhibit ALK5 kinase
  activity, including CP-639180 (depicted), prevent ALK5-induced phosphorylation of
  Smad2 and Smad3 and downstream signaling events. (4) Recombinant TGF-β3 protein
  (avotermin) binds to TGF-β signaling receptors and elicits Smad2/3-dependent signaling.
  Unlike TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 isoforms that have pro-scarring effects, TGF-β3 has anti-scarring
  properties. The molecular mechanisms underlying the different responses of the TGF-β
  isoforms have not been elucidated. (5) Antisense oligonucleotides are single-stranded
  DNA or RNA sequences that are complementary to a specific mRNA sequence. They bind
  to their target mRNA sequence and silence gene expression by blocking protein translation
  or promoting degradation of the mRNA transcript. To see this illustration in color,
