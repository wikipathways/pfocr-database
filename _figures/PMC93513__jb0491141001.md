caption: Possible metabolic pathway of GP in archaea. In autotrophic archaea (e.g.,
  methanogens) triosephosphates (DHAP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate [GAP]) are synthesized
  from CO2 and DHAP is converted to G-1-P, which is the sole source of enantiomeric
  backbone of archaeal polar lipids. Although some autotrophic methanogens (e.g.,
  Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum) have G-3-P dehydrogenase, this enzyme is not
  necessary for lipid biosynthesis. In heterotrophic archaea, exogenously supplied
  glycerol is incorporated and phosphorylated by ATP to form G-3-P, which is catabolized
  via DHAP. Endogenous DHAP and glycerol-derived DHAP are mixed in the intracellular
  pool, and some fraction of it is incorporated into lipids. Thus sn-1 and sn-3 carbons
  of exogenous glycerol are inverted to sn-3 and sn-1 carbon of lipid glycerol backbone,
  and sn-2 hydrogen of exogenous glycerol is not retained in lipids. G-1-P-DH, G-1-P
  dehydrogenase; G-3-P-DH, G-3-P dehydrogenase; FDP, fructose diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate;
  2,3-diGG-sn-G-1-P, 2,3-di-O-geranylgeranyl-sn-glycerol-1-phosphate; unsat. archaeol,
  unsaturated archaeol. The solid arrows indicate the anabolic route and the broken
  arrows indicate the catabolic route.
