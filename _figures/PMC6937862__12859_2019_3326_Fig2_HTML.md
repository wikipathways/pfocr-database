caption: The graphical user interface and output of ZDOG. a. The interface window,
  where the user can select which mutation types and datasets available in either
  COSMIC or TCGA are used for analysis (left). The loaded pathway will be annotated
  with mutations and displayed. Mutated genes are colored red, blue or grey depending
  on whether they are oncogenes, tumor-suppressors or neither. Unmutated genes are
  not colored. By clicking the “calculate dominator tree” button, the user can examine
  the extent to which mutations in a gene will affect downstream protein components
  and signaling processes in the pathway under the dominator tree model. b. Dominator
  tree for the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, with CSF1 chosen as root. The genes are
  colored in terms of their mutation frequencies in the COSMIC breast cancer dataset.
  Protein complexes are represented by a box. Four additional dark arrows are used
  to highlight the key genes discussed in the case study
