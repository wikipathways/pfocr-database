caption: Control of norepinephrine release and VSMC tension. A rise in [Ca2+]i stimulates
  vesicular release of norepinephrine in sympathetic nerve terminals (Upper) and precipitates
  VSMC contraction through activation of myosin light chain kinase (Lower). A rise
  in [Ca2+]i occurs in the nerves in response to depolarization which activates the
  entry of Ca2+ through L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ (Cav). In VSMC, a rise in [Ca2+]i
  occurs through activation of the PLC pathway, stimulated by for instance by the
  α1AR. The PLC pathway allows the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (not
  indicated), or the entry of Ca2+ through Cav, either directly, or through depolarization
  following inhibition of Kv7 channels. Hyperpolarizing Kv7 channels will therefore
  stabilize both cell types and prevent transmitter release and VSMC contraction.
  Pointed arrows—stimulation. Blunted arrows—inhibition. NE, norepinephrine; NET,
  norepinephrine re-uptake transporter.
