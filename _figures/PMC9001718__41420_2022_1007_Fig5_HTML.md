caption: Under weak H2O2 stimulation, NAD+ is consumed by PARP1 but resynthesized
  via the NAMPT-dependent salvage pathway. This NAD+ recovery is necessary for the
  synthesis of ATP and induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. On the other
  hand, NAD+ resynthesis is abrogated upon strong H2O2 stimulation, probably because
  of the impairment of the NAMPT-dependent step in the NAD+ salvage pathway, resulting
  in the depletion of ATP, suppression of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and induction
  of necrosis.
papertitle: NAMPT-dependent NAD+ salvage is crucial for the decision between apoptotic
  and necrotic cell death under oxidative stress.
