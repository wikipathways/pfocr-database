caption: 'Schematic illustration of the molecular interactions and signaling pathways
  involved in the association between TSC and diabetic kidney disease development
  (by Figdraw). TSC is a key inhibitor of mTORC1. Abnormal activation of mTORC1 in
  glomerular podocytes leads to glomerular dysfunction, as well as induces insulin
  resistance and may promote the progression of diabetic kidney disease. In vitro,
  insulin-induced activation of PI3K-Akt signaling inhibits TSC1 or TSC2 signaling,
  which promotes activation of the mTORC1 pathway. Furthermore, in cells with knocked-out
  TSC1 or TSC2, the mTORC1 pathway was significantly activated, leading to the progression
  of diabetic kidney disease. When the AMPK pathway is inactivated, it activates the
  TSC-mTOR signaling pathway, which inhibits the ULK kinase complex and prevents autophagy
  initiation, thereby exacerbating diabetic kidney disease. TSC: Tuberous sclerosis
  complex; mTORC1: Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; PI3K-Akt: Phosphoinositide
  3-kinase-Protein kinase B; TSC1/TSC2: Tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2; AMPK: AMP-activated
  Protein Kinase; ULK: Unc−51 Like Autophagy Activating Kinase; DKD: Diabetic kidney
  disease'
