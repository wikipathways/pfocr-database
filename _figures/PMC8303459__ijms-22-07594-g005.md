caption: The MEK5/ERK5 pathway serves as an escape route to promote proliferation
  and survival of cancer cells under MAPKi. Oncogenic driver mutations in components
  of the RTK/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway lead to hyperactivation of the MEK/ERK1/2
  cascade in multiple cancers. Existing inhibitors of the ERK1/2 pathway (MAPKi) targeting
  MEK1/2 (MEKi) or ERK1/2 (ERKi) trigger compensatory activation of the MEK5/ERK5
  pathway via stimulation of different receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) [,,] in order
  to allow tumor cells to escape MAPKi-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Additionally,
  ERK5 activity appears to be upregulated by DUSP6 regulation, an ERK5 specific dual
  specificity phosphatase, whose inhibition by miR211 was shown to increase basal
  ERK5 phosphorylation [].
