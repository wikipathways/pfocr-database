caption: Progestins diffuse through the plasma membrane and bind PR causing rapid
  SUMOylation on Lys388 on a subset of receptors resulting in transcriptional repression
  at many cancer relevant genes. Persistent MAPK (or CDK2) pathway activation (e.g.
  EGF treatment) results in efficient PR Ser294 phosphorylation, inhibition of PR
  SUMOylation, and transcriptional activation. Phosphorylated PR is highly ubiquitinated
  and rapidly degraded by the 26S proteasome; whereas, SUMOylated PR is highly stable
  with a longer half-life.
