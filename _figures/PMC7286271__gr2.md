caption: Schematic drawing depicting FCγ receptor (FCγR)–mediated antibody-mediated
  enhancement. This response is mediated by the type of nonneutralizing antibodies
  mounted against infection or vaccination. The immune response to such vaccines is
  subverted, leading to exacerbated illness. The Fc-region of the antibody binds to
  FCγR on the immune cells, which subverts the immune response by reducing TH1 cytokines
  (IL-2, TNF-a, and IFN-γ) and skews TH2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-6, PGE-2, and INF-ά)
  and inhibits STAT pathway leading to increased viral replication. STAT-A, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription protein-A; IRF, interferon regulatory
  factor, INOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase.
