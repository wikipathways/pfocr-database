caption: Schematic model of the evolution of CIN+ tumors. CIN creates an immune pressure
  in the nascent tumor cells due to the activation of the STING pathway and subsequent
  innate anti-tumor response. This immune pressure allows for the selection of CIN+
  clones that have uncoupled genomic instability from the activation of the STING
  pathway activation and consequent immunostimulation. The resultant tumors are thus
  immunologically cold.
