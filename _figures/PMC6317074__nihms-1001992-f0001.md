caption: 'Proposed cholesterol-lowering mechanisms of PS. Intestinal PS mediated lowering
  of cholesterol is facilitated through decreased micellarization of cholesterol esters
  resulting in decreased absorption and increased fecal sterol loss. Decreased intestinal
  cholesterol status activates the transcription factor SREBP2, resulting in the increase
  of lipoprotein receptors LDLr and SR-B1, facilitating the excretion of plasma cholesterol
  via the TICE pathway. Decreased expression of NPC1L1 and diminished activity levels
  of ACAT-2 and MTP coupled with the activation of LXR-mediated expression of ABCG5/G8
  further inhibit cholesterol absorption and packaging into chylomicrons. Similarly,
  reduced hepatic cholesterol concentrations result in SREBP2 activation resulting
  in a subsequent upregulation of LDLr and HMG-CoAr. Hepatic LXR activation also induces
  cholesterol efflux transporters ABCG5/G8 and ABCA1 resulting in reduced hepatic
  cholesterol status.Abbreviations: adenosine triphosphate binding cassette A1 (ABCA1),
  adenosine triphosphate binding cassette G5/G8 (ABCG5/G8), acyltransferase-2 (ACAT-2),
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoAr), liver X receptor (LXR), microsomal
