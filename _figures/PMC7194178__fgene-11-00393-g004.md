caption: 'eGenes from all four phenotypes (GS, MG, MS, and ALS) co-occurred within
  the axon guidance and mTOR signaling pathways. (A) The axon guidance pathway is
  involved in neural development and defects are associated with neuronal disorders.
  (B) The mTOR signaling pathway controls cellular processes including: cell growth,
  protein synthesis, cytoskeletal organization, and autophagy (). GS-, MG-, MS-, and
  ALS-associated eQTLs spatially regulate multiple eGenes that encode proteins involved
  in these pathways. Notably, proteins encoded by ALS eGenes are upstream regulators
  in both pathways.'
