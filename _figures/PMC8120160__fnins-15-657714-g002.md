caption: 'Schematic representation of some potential mechanisms involved in the antidepressant
  actions of ketamine. (1): Ketamine reduces NMDA receptor mediated stimulation of
  GABA interneurons reducing the inhibitory action on presynaptic glutamatergic neuron;
  (2) the reduced inhibition produces a rapid glutamate burst acting on AMPA receptors
  located on pyramidal neurons; (3) Such activation leads to the opening of voltage-dependent
  calcium channels (VDCC) that stimulate BDNF; (4) BDNF induce the translation and
  synthesis of key synaptic proteins in synaptogenesis and maturation of dendritic
  spines, including GluA1 and PSD95), via the TrkB/Flk-1 - mTORC1-signaling pathway;
  (5) ketamine acting as NMDA inhibited the eukaryotic elongation factor2 (eEF2) kinase,
  resulting in reduced eEF2 phosphorylation and increased BDNF translation and protein
  synthesis; (6) ketamine metabolite can stimulate AMPA receptors independently of
  NMDA receptor blockade by ketamine; (7) kainate receptor can contribute to Na+ and
  Ca++ entry, neuronal depolarization and postsynaptic responses.'
