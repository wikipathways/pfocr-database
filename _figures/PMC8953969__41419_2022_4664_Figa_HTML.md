caption: STING agonist diABZI induces neutrophilic lung inflammation and PANoptosis
  A, Airway STING priming induce a neutrophilic lung inflammation with epithelial
  barrier damage, double-stranded DNA release in the bronchoalvelolar space, cell
  death, NETosis and type I interferon release. B, 1. The diamidobenzimidazole (diABZI),
  a STING agonist is internalized into the cytoplasm through unknown receptor and
  induce the activation and dimerization of STING followed by TBK1/IRF3 phosporylation
  leading to type I IFN response. STING activation also leads to NF-kB activation
  and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6. 2. The activation
  of TNFR1 and IFNAR1 signaling pathway results in ZBP1 and RIPK3/ASC/CASP8 activation
  leading to MLKL phosphorylation and necroptosis induction. 3. This can also leads
  to Caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis induction. 4. Self-dsDNA or mtDNA sensing by
  NLRP3 or AIM2 induces inflammsome formation leading to Gasdermin D cleavage enabling
  Gasdermin D pore formation and the release mature IL-1β and pyroptosis. NLRP3 inflammasome
  formation can be enhanced by the ZBP1/RIPK3/CASP8 complex. 5. A second signal of
  STING activation with diABZI induces cell death and the release of self-DNA which
  is sensed by cGAS and form 2′3′-cGAMP leading to STING hyper activation, the amplification
  of TBK1/IRF3 and NF-kB pathway and the subsequent production of IFN-I and inflammatory
  TNFα and IL-6. This also leads to IFI204 and DDX41 upregulation thus, amplifying
  the inflammatory loop. The upregulation of apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis
  is indicative of STING-dependent PANoptosis.
