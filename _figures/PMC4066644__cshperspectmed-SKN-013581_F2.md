caption: Model of tumor heterogeneity. A normal cell (green) can convert to a tumor
  cell (purple) by acquiring an HH pathway mutation. As the tumor cell divides, clonal
  populations (blue) can gain secondary mutations that promote drug resistance. When
  SMO antagonist is applied, tumors with no resistant clones will shrink, whereas
  tumors with resistant clones will continue to grow.
