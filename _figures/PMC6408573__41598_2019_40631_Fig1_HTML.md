caption: Schematic illustration of an artificial cytosolic isobutanol biosynthetic
  pathway. Pyruvate is converted to 2-ketoisovalerate (2-KIV) by sequential catalytic
  reactions of α-acetolactate synthase (ALS), ketol-acid reductoisomerase (KARI),
  and dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (DHAD), and then 2-KIV is converted to isobutanol
  by 2-ketoacid decarboxylase (KDCs) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Deleted gene
  is indicated by double slash (//) and dashed line indicate multiple enzymatic actions.
