caption: 'Intrinsic interferon (IFN) response to microbiota tonic induction may suppress
  obesity in addition to its role in potentiating rapid antiviral response. In homeostatic
  situation, gut epithelia and the underlying leukocytes (mainly macrophages and dendritic
  cells, for example) sense natural shedding of microbial molecules from microbiota
  (particularly virobiota) and sustain an intrinsic expression of innate immune IFNs,
  particularly including IFN-β and probably IFN-λ. Acting through a non-canonical
  AKT-mTOR pathway, intrinsic IFNs signal IL-10/TGF production and contribute to maintain
  an anti-inflammatory microenvironment, which attenuates meta-inflammation and adipogenesis
  related to visceral obesity. The anti-obesity effect of transfecting IFN-β was recently
  demonstrated in addition to its role in potentiating rapid antiviral response via
  IFN autocrine loop of regulation. Abbreviations: AKT-mTOR, protein kinase B and
