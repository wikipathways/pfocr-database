caption: Response of p53 to DSBs generated by ionizing radiation. Activated p53 can
  induce cell cycle arrest at the G1, S and G2 phases, trigger apoptosis or force
  a cell into cellular senescence. Stabilization of p53 protein is mediated by multiple
  phosphorylations on p53 and Mdm2 via the ATM/ATR and Chk1/2 kinases. p53-mediated
  transcription of p21 inhibits both cyclin D-cdk4/6 (G1 arrest) and cyclin E/A-cdk2
  (S-phase arrest). Cyclin-cdk inhibition allows unphosporylated Rb to sequester E2F
  necessary for transition into S phase. Prolonged p53 activation may lead to chromatin
  remodeling and permanent cell cycle arrest (senescence). p53-mediated transcription
  of 14-3-3s and Gadd45 inhibit cyclin B-cdc2 (G2 arrest). Prolonged p53 activation
  can also trigger apoptosis through transcription of proapoptic proteins bax, noxa
  and puma. p53-mediated transription of DRAM can lead to cell macroautophagy.
