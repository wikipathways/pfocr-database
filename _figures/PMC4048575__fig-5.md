caption: Transcriptional regulation of antioxidant defenses by autophagy and the ubiquitin/proteasome
  system. Keap1 is a key regulator of the Nrf2-signaling pathway. (1) Under basal
  conditions (white background), the Nrf2 switch is in the off position, as Keap1
  (reduced) functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, constantly targeting Nrf2 for ubiquitination
  and degradation. As a consequence, the constitutive levels of Nrf2 are very low.
  (2) Under stressed conditions (pink background), the Nrf2 switch is turned on when
  Keap1 is oxidized and restrains Nrf2 ubiquitination, enabling its translocation
  to the nucleus. (3) In the nucleus, Nrf2 forms a complex with the transcription
  factor Maf and activates the transcription of downstream target genes via promoters
  containing AREs (canonical regulation). (4) p62-dependent autophagic degradation
  of Keap1 has also been shown to activate Nrf2 and protect against oxidative stress.
  Thus, (5) under normal conditions, basal autophagy continuously degrades p62. However,
  (6) under oxidative stress conditions that produce autophagy deficiency, p62 accumulates
  in the cytoplasm and interacts with Keap1, disrupting the degradation of Nrf2 and
  enabling, in consequence, the transcription of Nrf2-targeted genes. (7) Transcriptional
  up-regulation of p62 by Nrf2, subsequently, creates a positive feedback loop. To
