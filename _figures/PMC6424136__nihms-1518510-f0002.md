caption: Schematic depicting the dependence of both vascular shear stress and endothelial
  insulin signaling on the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein
  kinase B (Akt)/nitric oxide (NO) pathway signaling cascade. Briefly, vascular shear
  stress causes the deformation of luminal endothelial mechanoreceptors/glycocalyx
  which stimulate intracellular activation of the PI3K/Akt/NO pathway and insulin
  stimulates activation of both the endothelial PI3K/Akt/NO and the mitogen activated
  protein kinase (MAPK)/endothelin-1 (ET-1) pathway. The vascular actions of insulin
  are influenced by the balance between the two pathways. The dependence of both vascular
  shear stress and endothelial insulin signaling on the PI3K/Akt/NO pathway raises
  the possibility that vascular shear stress enhances vascular insulin sensitivity
  by promoting activation of the PI3K/Akt/NO pathway. VASC=vascular, IRS1/2=insulin
  receptor substrate 1/2, ETA/B=endothelin receptor, CaM=calcium calmodulin complex,
  cyt=cytosolic, PIP=phosphatidylinositol 4,5-phosphate, GC=guanylate cyclase, PDE5=phosphodiesterase
  5, eNOS=endothelial NO synthase, O2=oxygen, BH4=tetrahydrobiopterin, P=phosphorylated.
