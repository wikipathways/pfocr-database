caption: Synthesis and mechanisms of LNP-based mRNA vaccine in immunotherapy. (A)
  Synthetic raw materials of LNP -based mRNA vaccine. (B) Morphology of the assembled
  mRNA. The mRNA structure in the liposome is composed of a 5’cap structure, 5’- and
  3’- UTR, a 3’ poly (A) tail and an open reading frame. (C) Immune responses of LNP-based
  mRNA vaccine in vivo. After entering the human body, the LNP-based mRNA vaccine
  enters antigen-presenting cells through endocytosis before releasing the mRNA in
  the cells. The released mRNA translates the target antigen in the ribosome. Subsequently,
  endogenous antigens are degraded into polypeptides and are presented by MHC I and
  activate CD8+ T cells (pathway I). In addition, secreted antigens can be taken up
  by cells, degraded inside endosomes, and presented on the cell surface to CD4+ T
  cells by MHC II. Finally, CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to promote B cell maturation
  and then B cells produce specific antibodies to play an anti-tumor role (pathway
  II).
