caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the role of hepatic AMPK in regulating lipogenesis
  and lipolysis. Hepatic AMPK acts as a critical energy sensor and regulator of lipid
  metabolism by inhibiting lipogenesis and promoting fatty acid oxidation (FAO). It
  is activated by main upstream kinases, TAK1, CaMKK2 and LKB1, in response to the
  increased intracellular calcium concentration and energy state. Upon activation,
  AMPK inhibits its key substrates, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase 2 (ACC2). ACC1 catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA
  in the cytosol, driving de novo lipogenesis (DNL), while ACC2 inhibits FAO by regulating
  malonyl-CoA levels and controlling CPT1 at the mitochondrial membrane. AMPK suppresses
  lipogenesis by inhibiting ACC and its upstream transcriptional regulators, including
  mTOR, LXRs, and SREBP1c. This action reduces lipid accumulation in the liver. Additionally,
  AMPK enhances FAO by activating key pathways, including SIRT1 and PGC-1α. SIRT1
  is upregulated by an increased NAD+/NADH ratio, which is influenced by AMPK and
  CPT1. AMPK also boosts SIRT1 activity by increasing NAMPT levels, which further
  enhances NAD+ synthesis. Moreover, SIRT1 can reciprocally activate AMPK both directly
  and indirectly by promoting the translocation of LKB1, creating a positive feedback
  loop that reinforces AMPK activity and lipid metabolism regulation. AMP-activated
