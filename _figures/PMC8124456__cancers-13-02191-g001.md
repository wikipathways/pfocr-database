caption: 'The impact of DPP-4 inhibitor on mammary tumor via CXCL12/CXCR4 downstream
  pathway. (A) DPP-4 digests CXCL12 for enzymatic action, thus the CXCL12-mediated
  CXCR4 downstream pathway in cancer is not strongly activated in the presence of
  DPP-4. (B) The DPP-4 inhibitor suppresses the degradation of CXCL12 and increases
  the level of CXCL12. Elevated CXCL12 interacts with its receptor CXCR4 and induces
  mTOR activation. The DPP-4 inhibitor-induced CXCL12/CXCR4/mTOR pathway causes mammary
  tumor proliferation. The activation of mTOR also causes EMT, which induces metastasis
  and chemoresistance in the mammary tumor. CXCL12: C-X-C motif chemokine 12; CXCR4:
  C-X-C receptor 4; DPP-4: dipeptidyl peptidase-4; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition;
  mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin.'
