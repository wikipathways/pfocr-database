caption: 'Signaling systems anchored at cilia. Schematic representation of cilia-based
  signaling components of the Hedgehog (A), Notch (B), WNT (C; canonical Wnt signaling
  right of dotted line, non-canonical Wnt signaling left of dotted line), and PDGFRa
  (D) signaling systems.A. HH ligands bind to the Patched (PTCH1) receptor, which
  is localized to the ciliary membrane. In the absence of HH binding, PTCH1 and G-protein-coupled
  receptor 161 (GPR161) provide repressive signals that sequester a second protein,
  Smoothened (SMO) in intracellular vesicles outside the cilium. HH binding causes
  PTCH1 to be trafficked out of cilia, allowing SMO to translocate into the cilia,
  where it activates GLI effectors, which translocate to the nucleus and trigger transcription
  of GLI-targeted genes.B. Notch pathway signaling requires cleavage of ligand-bound,
  activated Notch by the γ-secretase complex, localized proximal to the basal body;
  this releases an intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus
  as part of the CSL transcription factor complex, and induces MYC, CCND3, HES1 and
  other genes.C. In the absence of Wnt ligand, the β-catenin destruction complex (DC),
  composed of axin, APC, PP2A, glycogen GSK3 and CK1α, efficiently promotes β-catenin
  degradation by proteasome. In the canonical Wnt pathway, a Wnt ligand (e.g. WNT1–3,
  8a, 8b, 10a, and 10b: blue oval) binds to Frizzled (FZ) and low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6) which recruit Dishevelled (DVL) and the
  DC. This association inactivates the DC, allowing β-catenin to translocate to the
  nucleus to induce transcription of target genes (indicated by red arrows). The ciliary
  protein inversin/NPHP2 (INV) regulates proteasomal degradation of DVL, and hence
  influences accumulation of β-catenin. In the non-canonical pathway, distinct WNT
  ligands (e.g. WNT4, 5a, 5b, 6, 7a, 7b, and 11; blue circle) bind FZ, but INV here
  acts to promote DVL recruitment and activation of JNK and RHOA, regulating planar
  cell polarity (PCP)  (indicated by blue arrows).D. PDGF-AA ligand binds to cilia-localized
  PDGFRα receptors. Downstream activation of the MEK1/2 and AKT effectors is mediated
  proximal to the basal body, and results in transcription of pro-proliferative genes
  including STATs, c-Fos, and c-Jun.'
