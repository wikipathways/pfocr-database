caption: 'Proposed alternative biosynthetic pathways of ibotenic acid. Pathway A involves
  N‐hydroxylation of the amide of 7 by IboF. Pathway B involves N‐hydroxylation of
  a hypothetical external compound which does not end up in the final structure of
  ibotenic acid (1). Enzymes are indicated by colored circles: filled for verified
  function, non‐filled for inferred function. PLP: pyridoxal phosphate‐dependent enzyme;
  FMO: flavin‐dependent monooxygenase.'
