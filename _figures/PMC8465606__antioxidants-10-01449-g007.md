caption: The potential TLR signaling pathway in the digestive gland and gill of abalone
  (Haliotis discus hannai) after a 100-day feeding trial. The upregulated and downregulated
  genes are marked by flammulated up-triangle (digestive gland) or up-arrow (gill),
  and down-triangle (digestive gland) or down-arrow (gill), respectively. The green
  up-triangle (digestive gland) or up-arrow (gill) and down-triangle (digestive gland)
  or down-arrow (gill) indicate the increasing and decreasing trend of the genes,
  but their expression levels were not significant. The signaling pathway of TLR-A
  and TLR-B is unclear in the recent study and marked by “?”.
