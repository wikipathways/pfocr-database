caption: 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR signaling protects the mucosal barrier. In early stage of
  colitis development, 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR signaling preserves tight junction barrier
  by down-regulating long MLCK (this study). With colitis progress, 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR
  inhibits MLCK-independent epithelial cell apoptosis by down-regulating PUMA (see
  ). The mechanism of both regulatory pathways is the blockade of NF-κB activation.
  Conversely, TNF-α, via induction of miR-346, down-regulates epithelial VDR to attenuate
  its protective effects (see ).
