caption: The TNF-bound TNFR1 is shown with the formation of complex I, leading to
  NF-κB activation on the left side, and formation of complex II, leading to cell
  death, on the right side. Ubiquitination modifications are shown, indicated as ‘M1’
  for linear and ‘K63’ for lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains. Proteins that were used
  as bait proteins in this study are indicated in blue.
