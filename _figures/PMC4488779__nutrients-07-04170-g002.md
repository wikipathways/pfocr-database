caption: Proposed model of the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway. Toll-like
  receptor (TLR)-2/1 ligand, TLR-8 ligand (innate immune mechanisms), interferon-gamma
  (IFN-γ) and CD40 ligand (CD40L) (acquired immune mechanisms) induce antimicrobial
  response in human monocytes/macrophages through different signaling pathways; yet
  they converge on the upregulation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1)
  and vitamin D receptor (VDR). CYP27B1 hydroxylates 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) into
  the bioactive 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D), triggering VDR mediated upregulation
  of antimicrobial peptides (cathelicidin and human β-defensin 2 (DEFB4)), as well
  as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), which
  indirectly contributes to further DEFB4 increase. At the same time, the 1,25D-bound
  VDR mediates downregulation of hepcidin (HAMP). HAMP favors the cellular export
  of iron and makes the intracellular compartment inconvenient for the survival/proliferation
  of pathogens. In addition, cathelicidin promotes autophagy, which enhances autophagolysosomal
  fusion and antimicrobial activity.
