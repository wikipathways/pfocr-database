caption: Role of SOCS proteins in the regulation of the signaling pathways induced
  by recognition of gram-negative bacteria. Recognition of gram-negative bacteria
  through LPS by TLR4. Activation by LPS of TLR4 leads to the activation of transcription
  factor NF-κB and MAP kinases (JNK, p38, ERK) by myeloid differentiation factor 88
  (MyD88)-dependent pathway, serine/threonine kinase IL-1R-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4),
  and TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6) resulting in the induction of essential cytokines
  and chemokines (Nakagawa et al., ; Qin et al., ; Freudenberg et al., ; Hu et al.,
  ). The regulation of TLR signaling by the specific SOCS protein involved is highlighted
  in red.
