caption: Cholesterol synthesis commences with 3 molecules of acetyl-CoA, which in
  the mevalonate pathway are converted to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). IPP gives
  rise to lanosterol in a series of enzymatic reactions. Two separate enzymatic pathways
  generate cholesterol from lanosterol. Metabolites from both pathways are interconvertible
  via 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (Dhcr24). For detailed metabolic pathway information
  see (). Metabolites measured in the current study are shown in green, important
  enzymes are shown in red.
