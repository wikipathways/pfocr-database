caption: Suggested model for modulation of Wnt pathway by OCC-1 splice variants. An
  elaborated Wnt signaling model is suggested based on the literature and the current
  results, which incorporates the OCC-1 gene in this pathway. The OCC-1A/B activator
  peptide and OCC-1-originated miR-ex1 both result in up-regulation of the Wnt signaling
  pathway in this model. Attenuation of the Wnt signaling pathway is also attributed
  to the noncoding RNA function of the OCC-1 gene. The latter function is suggested
  to be exerted through suppression of the OCC-1 neighboring gene (APPL2) at the transcriptional
  level. The findings of this study are shown as red lines, and black lines denote
  the previously known interactions.
papertitle: Alternative splicing of the OCC-1 gene generates three splice variants
  and a novel exonic microRNA, which regulate the Wnt signaling pathway.
