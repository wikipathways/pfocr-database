caption: 'Regulation of glycolysis, glutaminolysis and de novo nucleotide biosynthesis
  in tumor cells. Oncogenic activation of the PI3K/Akt and Myc pathways promotes glucose
  and glutamine uptake and catabolism. Tumor cells obtain precursors (in pink rectangles)
  including ribose 5-phosphate, glycine, glutamine, aspartate and NADPH for de novo
  biosynthesis from glucose and glutamine metabolism. Increased glucose uptake and
  PFK-1 activity by the PI3K/Akt pathway, inactivation of PK-M2 by p-Tyr signaling,
  as well as HIF-1-induced TKT activation allows glycolytic intermediates to enter
  the non-oxidative PPP for ribose 5-phosphate production in tumor cells. Hatched
  lines indicate that the oxidative arm of PPP is not the main pathway for ribose
  5-phosphate or NADPH production in tumor cells. Glutamine is converted to lactate
  if mitochondrial malate is exported into the cytoplasm and decarboxylated to produce
  pyruvate by malic enzyme (ME). The glutaminolysis pathway and the reaction catalyzed
  by cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) may serve as the major sources of NADPH
  for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis in tumor cells [,,]. In addition to its role
  in providing tumor cells with NADPH, Myc also directly regulates several genes encoding
  key enzymes in the purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Abbreviations: P,
  phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; F1,6BP, fructose
  1,6-bisphosphate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate;

  6-phosphate dehydrogenase; PFK-1, phosphofructokinase-1; TKT, transketolase; PK-M2,
