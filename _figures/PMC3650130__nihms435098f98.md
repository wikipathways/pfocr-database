caption: Later, Padwa reported a regioselective Rh(II)-catalyzed room temperature
  cycloisomerization of trisubstituted cyclopropenyl ketones into 2,3,4-trisubstituted
  furans 2-319. In contrast, employment of a Rh(I) catalyst affords 2,3,5-trisubstituted
  furans 2-324 as single regioisomers in high yields (). It was proposed that in the
  case of the Rh(II) catalyst, a preferential electrophilic attack by bulky Rh(II)
  catalyst occurres at the cyclopropene double bond (2-315) to produces the most stabilized
  tertiary cyclopropyl carbocation 2-316 (Path A). A subsequent ring opening of the
  latter produced key Rh-carbenoid intermediate 2-317 that undergoes a cyclization
  into zwitterionic species 2-318, wherein elimination of the Rh(II) catalyst affords
  “normal” product 2-319. To account for the opposite regiochemistry in the case of
  Rh(I) catalyst, a formation of metallacyclobutene species 2-322, available either
  via a direct oxidative addition of Rh(I) into the C1–C3 bond of a cyclopropene or
  through the cycloreversion–cycloaddition pathway, was suggested. A subsequent cyclization
  of 2-322 followed by a reductive elimination (2-323) furnished furan 2-324 ().
