caption: TGFβ receptor signaling is initiated by the binding of TGFβ ligands to the
  TGFβ type II receptor (TGFbRII) to recruit and catalyze phosphorylation of the TGFβ
  type I receptor (TGFbRI), which subsequently phosphorylates the transcription factors
  SMAD2 and/or SMAD3. Phosphorylated SMAD2 and/or SMAD3 generate a complex with the
  Common (CO-) smad, SMAD4, and then the SMAD-CO-SMAD4 complex translocates to the
  nucleus and modulates gene expression to regulate cellular functions, e.g. cell
  cycle control. SMAD7 is a potent inhibitor of TGFβ receptor signaling. SMAD7 can
  block R-SMAD phosphorylation, degrade type I receptors, and even exert an inhibitory
  effect on the nucleus. SMAD2/3 nuclear translocation can similarly be affected by
  other non-superfamily pathways, e.g. activation of epidermal growth factor receptor
  (EGFR) signaling pathway by M2 macrophages in inflammation following an injury.
  Macrophages can directly boost smad7 expression which, in turn, can inhibit SMAD2/3
  translocation and induce beta cell proliferation.
