caption: Schematic of three different natural QS systems. (A) V. fischeri’s LuxI/LuxR
  QS system. AHL is one of the QS signal molecules. LuxI is an AHL synthetase, and
  LuxR binds to AHL to form the LuxR-AHL complex, which initiates transcription of
  the lux cluster by binding to the plus promoter. The lux CDABE in the Lux cluster
  is responsible for bioluminescence. (B)AI-2 QS system. AI-2 is one of the QS signaling
  molecules synthesized by luxS. AI-2 is transported into and out of the cell by membrane
  materials, and lsrK can phosphorylate AI-2. In the absence of phosphorylated AI-2,
  LsrR inhibits transcription of PlsrR and Plsr by binding to these promoters. When
  phosphorylated AI-2 appears and binds to LsrR, transcription is inhibited by the
  release of LsrR promoter binding. (C) The AI - 3 / epinephrine, norepinephrine signaling
  pathway. AI - 3 and epinephrine/norepinephrine appear to be recognized by the same
  receptor and interact with sensor kinases located in the periplasm. The adrenergic
  receptor, QseC, makes uppart of the QseB/C two-component system that regulates the
  flagellumegulon and thus motility
