caption: The roles of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in Multiple myeloma (MM), basal cell
  carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma (MB). In MM, 1q21 amplification, inflammatory
  cytokines and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) upregulate ADAR1 editing activity.
  Increased ADAR1 edits glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) and stabilizes GLI1 expression
  by preventing the binding of its negative regulator, suppressor of fused (SUFU).
  Edited GLI1 activates the Hedgehog signaling pathway and promote malignant regeneration
  of MM. In MB and BCC, edited GLI1 is less accessible to its activator, Dual specificity
  tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) and shows reduced oncogenic
  potential. In addition, edited endonuclease 8-like 1 (NEIL1) in MM shows reduced
  oxidative damage repair ability.
