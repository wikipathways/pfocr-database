caption: 'Exercise is a Powerful Behavioral Intervention Against CNS Aging and Alzheimer''s
  Disease. Multiple studies have shown that exercise can have potent rejuvenating
  effects in the CNS. Increases in secretion of CNS-targeting myokines such as FNDC5/Irisin,
  Cathepsin B (CSTB), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are seen in response to exercise. Although
  the mechanisms (if any) of transport across the blood-brain barrier remain currently
  poorly understood, they all culminate in increased expression of Brain Derived Neurotrophic
  Factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. This elevation in BDNF is required for the neurocognitive
  benefits of exercise, including increases in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, improvements
  in synaptic plasticity, increased angiogenesis, and finally improvement or maintenance
  of cognitive ability. Plasma transfer experiments have demonstrated the existence
  of these factors in circulation, and their ability to transfer the neurocognitive
  benefits of exercise in sedentary animal models. Development of therapeutics that
  reproduce the CNS rejuvenation effects of exercise (exercisemimetics) should perhaps
  recapitulate not just the local skeletal muscle effects of exercise, but also the
  exerkine profile seen in circulation. (Inset): Exercise stimulates the AMPK and
  PGC1α which can work synergistically with PPARβ/δ. This pathway is under intense
  scrutiny as a potential target for therapeutics that mimic the benefits of behavioral
  exercise may serve as a neuroprotectant signaling pathway, including AICAR, Metformin,
  and GW501516.'
