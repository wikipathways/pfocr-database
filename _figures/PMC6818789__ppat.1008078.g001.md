caption: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) converts initial MEP pathway
  substrates pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate
  (DXP). Dxr converts DXP to MEP. Two additional steps occur generating 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate
  (MEcPP). MEcPP is converted to 4-hydroxy-3-methylbutenyl 1-diphosphate (HMBPP) by
  IspG. IspH converts HMBPP to the isoprenoid precursor molecules IPP/DMAPP. IPP/DMAPP
  are stereoisomers produced in a 5:1 ratio and are used to generate isoprenoids.
  In bacteria, the isoprenoid bactoprenol (purple rectangle), is critical for peptidoglycan
  synthesis. 1, Peptidoglycan precursor Lipid II is synthesized in the bacterial cytoplasm
  through a series of enzymatic reactions and is anchored to the inner leaflet of
  the inner membrane of the Gram negative bacterial cell envelope via bactoprenol;
  2, The lipid II molecule is flipped into the periplasm; 3, Periplasmic lipid II
  is incorporated into the peptidoglycan ring and bactoprenol is recycled. We postulate
  that both FSM and iron deprivation can disrupt isoprenoid synthesis since IspG and
  IspH are iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes. In both cases, isoprenoid synthesis
  is halted, bactoprenol availability is reduced and peptidoglycan synthesis is prevented,
  resulting in persistence induction in Chlamydia.
