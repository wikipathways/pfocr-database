caption: 'The life cycle of coronavirus: At the beginning, S protein binds to the
  ACE2 receptor in host cells. Then, the conformation of S protein is changed and
  causes the virus envelope to merge with the cell membrane via the endosomal pathway.
  Next coronavirus releases its RNA into the host cell. Genome RNA is translated to
  viral replicas polyproteins pp1a and 1ab. That polyproteins disparted to small proteins
  by proteinases. Polymerase makes some of subgenomic mRNAs by discontinuous transcription
  and finally translated to viral proteins. Viral proteins and genome RNA are assembled
  to the ER and Golgi. After that, it transported via vesicles and released out of
  the cell. ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC,
  ER–Golgi intermediate compartment'
