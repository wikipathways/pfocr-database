caption: 'Mechanism of calreticulin (CRT) exposure in the response to immunogenic
  cell death (ICD) inducers. After exposition of cells to stress factors causing ICD,
  the loss of ER homeostasis leads to activation of unfolded protein response (UPR)
  signaling pathways. During ICD, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase
  (PERK) activation leads to the phosphorylation of α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation
  factor 2 (eIF2α), inducing the downstream ER stress: pre-apoptotic, caspase 8-based
  cleavage of B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BAP31) and activation of BCL2-associated
  X protein (Bax), as well as Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak). Finally, CRT
  that has transited to the Golgi apparatus is exocytosed through soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
  fusion protein-attachment protein receptor (SNARE)—dependent pathway. Exocytic vesicles
  fuse with plasma membrane by interactions between SNAREs related with vesicles and
  synaptosome associated protein 23/25 (SNAP23/25) associated with cell membrane and
  CRT is exposed on the cell membrane of dying cell.'
