caption: Mechanisms of bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and the
  brain. A network of entero-epithelial cells (EECs) along the gut wall mediates the
  bidirectional communication. In response to various stimuli and external cues, the
  central nervous system (CNS) modulate EECs via vagal efferents and the hypothalamic
  pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. Gut microbiota return signals to the brain through
  different afferent pathways. Microbial metabolites, cytokine induction and neurotransmitters
  function via endocrine pathways; vagal afferents form part of the neurocrine pathway.
  Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by bacteria in the gut include acetate,
  lactate, butyrate and propionate. SCFAs modulate the integrity of the blood–brain
  barrier (BBB). Butyrate induces the expression of tight junction proteins, including
  claudins and occludins, and is therefore important for maintaining gut epithelial
  barrier integrity. A disrupted barrier encourages translocation of gut microbiota
  and their metabolites from the lumen to the circulatory system, resulting in the
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, which can lead to changes
  in cognition and mood. Acetate crosses the BBB and accumulates in the hypothalamus,
  thereby controlling appetite. The bidirectional flow of information via the gut–brain
  axis can modify the gut microbiota and modulate behavior, mood and mental health.
