caption: 'A schematic representation of the common upstream signaling pathways of
  autophagy and apoptosis under ERS. Under the condition of ERS, PERK is triggered,
  leading to its phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of eIF2α. Consequently,
  this triggers the specific initiation of ATF4, which promotes autophagy and apoptosis.
  ATF4 not only stimulates autophagy by inducing various ATG genes but also facilitates
  apoptosis by degrading XIAP and collaborating with CHOP during prolonged ERS. CHOP
  initiates the apoptotic response by regulating pro-apoptotic proteins such as BIM
  and DR5, as well as anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2, and by facilitating Ca2+
  release through ERO1. IRE1α forms a complex with TRAF2 and ASK1, thereby inducing
  downstream activation of JNK signaling pathway and facilitating the processes of
  autophagy and apoptosis. ATF6 indirectly modulates autophagy or apoptosis through
  XBP-1 and CHOP. Disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis by ERS is additionally implicated
  in the initiation of autophagy and apoptosis. This figure is created with BioRender.com. Abbreviations
