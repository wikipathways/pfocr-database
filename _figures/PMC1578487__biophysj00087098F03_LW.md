caption: (a) A schematic representation of the potential binding pathways involved
  in the piecewise assemblage of a proliferative signaling complex of FGF2/HSPG/FGFR
  in a 2:2:2 stoichiometry. In all three pathways, binding order of the constituents
  vary in the initial and intermediate binding steps. In Pathway A, FGF2 (L) binds
  to FGFR (Rs), forming CsRF, which binds to an HSPG (Hs), to form the intermediate
  complex (CsI). In Pathway B, FGF2 (L) binds to an HSPG (Hs) forming CsHF, which
  can be internalized (kiCHF) or released into the medium (krelCHF). CsHF then binds
  to an FGFR (Rs) to form CsI. In Pathway C, the receptors (Rs and Hs) bind initially
  to form CsHR, then FGF2 (L) binds to that complex to form the intermediate complex
  CsI. The tertiary binding event is the same in all pathways—two intermediate complexes
  bind to form the ternary signaling complex (CsT), which can be internalized (kicT).
  Cell surface HSPGs can also be internalized (kiH) or released into the surrounding
  medium (krelH). (b) The potential intracellular processing events of endocytosed
  FGF2. The growth factor can enter the cell when bound to HSPGs (CsHF) or when part
  of the ternary signaling complex (CsT). Surface HSPG (Hs) and HSPG-bound FGF2 (CsHF)
  can also be released into the surrounding medium without being internalized (krelH,
  krelCHF). Once internalized, the 18 kDa growth factor is cleaved into a 16 kDa form
  (). FGF2 in the ternary complex can be transported with its receptors to the nucleus
  for further signaling. Some internalized (,) FGF2 is degraded into low molecular
  weight fragments (CLMW) before further degradation and subsequent release for the
  cell. Internalized HSPG (Hi) can also be degraded into low molecular weight fragments
  (HLMW) before further degradation and subsequent release for the cell.
