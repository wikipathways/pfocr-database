caption: The PD-L1 promoter has binding sites for transcription factors IRF-1 and
  NF-κB, so IFN-γ-mediated signaling through the JAK/STAT-1/IRF-1 pathway and TLR
  ligand-mediated signaling through the MEK/ERK/NF-κB pathway can upregulate PD-L1
  gene transcription. Signaling through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, usually inhibited
  by PTEN, can activate S6K1, which regulates the 5′ UTR of PD-L1. This results in
  recruitment of PD-L1 transcripts to polysomes and associated PD-L1 translation.
  By contrast, miR-513, which can be inhibited by IFN-γ signaling, prevents PD-L1
  translation by binding to the PD-L1 3′ UTR. B7-H3 expression can also be enhanced
  by IFN-γ signaling, perhaps through blocking miR-29, which otherwise represses B7-H3
  translation. It seems that different types of cells use overlapping yet divergent
  pathways to regulate the expression of PD-L1 and B7-H3.
