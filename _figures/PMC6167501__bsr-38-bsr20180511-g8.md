caption: 'Initially, the Notch receptor is translocated to the trans-Golgi network
  as a full-length protein which is cleaved to form membrane-attached heterodimeric
  receptor. The signaling cascade initiates after binding of the ligands JAG1 and
  2 or DSL 1, 3, and 4 to the Notch receptor between neighboring cells. This binding
  initiates two successive proteolytic cleavages that culminate in the release of
  the NICD, which is translocated into the nucleus, where it interacts with the transcription
  factors. In normal skin, Notch signaling is expressed in all epidermal layers and
  is fundamental to keratinocyte differentiation. The downstream effectors of Notch-mediated
  epidermal homeostasis include Hes, Hey, p21, Keratin1/10, and Involucrin Abbreviation:
  DSL, Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 domain.'
