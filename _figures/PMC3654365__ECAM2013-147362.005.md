caption: Summary of the metabolic pathways in which the metabolites described in this
  paper are involved. Red indicates metabolites with increased levels due to cerebral
  ischemia. Black indicates metabolites not found or not identified. Green indicates
  lowered metabolites due to cerebral ischemia. The pathways associated with energy
  metabolism, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and membrane disruption are labeled
  in red, blue, green, and yellow background, respectively.
