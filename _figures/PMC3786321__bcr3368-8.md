caption: Stress-elicited extrinsic phenotypes (SEEPs). In human mammary epithelial
  cells with an intact p16/Rb pathway (HMEC, green cells), DNA damage (or telomere
  malfunction) causes cell-cycle arrest and is self-limiting. In contrast, the same
  type of damage in human mammary epithelial cells with a compromised p16/Rb pathway
  (vHMEC, red cells) results in the activin A-dependent induction of COX-2 and continued
  cell proliferation []. Activin A can drive increased COX-2 expression in adjacent
  epithelial cells [] and fibroblasts (tan cells; current work) via paracrine signaling.
  Fibroblasts adjacent to epithelial cells with telomere malfunction, or exposed to
  activin A or PGE2, upregulate a number of genes to induce cell-extrinsic phenotypes
  associated with a protumorigenic microenvironment, as shown [,]. Collectively, these
  factors can alter the extracellular matrix, induce angiogenesis, increase immune
  cell influx, drive cell proliferation, damage DNA, facilitate the switch to anaerobic
  metabolism, and promote cell motility [,,,,,,-].
