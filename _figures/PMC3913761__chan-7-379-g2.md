caption: 'Figure 2. The role of ORAI and STIM proteins in carcinogenesis. The second
  messenger Ca2+ plays an important role in regulating many signaling pathways related
  to cancer development and progression. SOCE in tumor and endothelial cells results
  from the activation of cell surface receptors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF),
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and secreted frizzled-related protein
  2 (SFRP2). The subsequent activation of phospholipase C (PLC) leads to the production
  of InsP3 and release of Ca2+ from ER Ca2+ stores via the opening of InsP3 receptor
  channels. The reduced Ca2+ concentration in the ER, or [Ca2+]ER, is sensed by stromal
  interaction molecule (STIM) 1, which binds to ORAI1, the pore-forming subunit of
  the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel. Opening of CRAC channels results
  in Ca2+ influx and a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, [Ca2+]i. Several
  cytoplasmic enzymes associated with cancer development and progression are regulated
  by Ca2+. ERK and AKT are phosphorylated in a Ca2+-dependent manner, whereas mRNA
  and protein levels of others molecules such as COX2 and cyclins are controlled by
  [Ca2+]i. SOCE has been linked to the regulation of cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis
  and metastasis as well as neovascularization of tumors. Abbreviations: SPCA2, secretory
  pathway Ca2+ ATPase 2; ERα, estrogen receptor-α.'
