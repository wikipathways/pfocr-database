caption: DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) add a methyl group to the 5′ carbon of cytosine.
  Methyl binding domain (MBD) proteins recognise this modification and recruit transcription
  factors to deacetylate histones and otherwise repress gene transcription. Alternatively,
  TET oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) leads to the formation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
  (5hmC), which can be further oxidised to 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxycytosine
  (presumably these molecules can act as signalling scaffolds in their own right,
  although this remains to be seen). 5hmC can be deaminated by the activation-induced
  deaminase/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing cytokine (AID/APOBEC3) family, leading to
  base excision repair in an active DNA demethylation pathway. Alternatively, 5hmC
  can serve as an intermediate signalling molecule, recruiting unique transcriptional
  complexes or otherwise ‘priming’ for gene expression. BER, base excision repair;
  TET, ten eleven translocation.
