caption: 'TGFβ Smad-independent Signaling Pathways: TGFβ exerts its effect by binding
  and activating type II receptor (TGFβR2) and then type I receptor (TGFβR1). Smad
  independent pathways are then activated and include various branches of MAP kinase
  (MAPK) pathways, Rho-like GTPase signaling pathways, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K)/AKT pathways and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) pathway. These pathways then
  regulate gene transcription in the nucleus. The exact mechanism of activation of
  these various Smad-independent signaling pathways remains to be elaborated.'
