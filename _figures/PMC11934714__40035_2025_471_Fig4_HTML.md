caption: The role of HERV in schizophrenia. Overexpression of HERV-W env is widespread
  in the neurons of patients with schizophrenia. This triggers a series of intracellular
  signaling pathways that ultimately lead to neuronal apoptosis, ferroptosis, impaired
  morphology, and other functional changes that cause schizophrenia. The HERV-W Env
  protein interacts with and activates DRD2, leading to neuronal apoptosis through
  the DRD2/PP2A/Akt1/GSK3 pathway [144]. In addition, HERV-W Env reduces inhibition
  of the cGAS-STING pathway by inhibiting linc01930, which induces an immune response
  and ultimately leads to neuronal apoptosis [187]. HERV-W represses genes involved
  in ferroptosis repression, leading to an increase in ferroptosis [188]. HERV-W also
  recruits YY1, which promotes the transcription of miR-141-3p, leading to activation
  of the Wnt5A/JNK/Arp2 signaling pathway, resulting in neuronal morphological defects
  [189]. In addition, HERV-W Env inhibits 5HT4R and activates the SK2 gene [194].
  HERV-W Env upregulates the expression of TRPC3, leading to an increase in intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration and activation of CREB [190]. This leads to the upregulation
  of schizophrenia-related genes such as SK3, DRD3, and BDNF, causing functional changes
  in neurons and ultimately leading to schizophrenia [146, 195, 196]
