caption: 'Metabolic network centered on arginine. In the physiological state, arginine
  is regenerated from citrulline by citrulline–arginine recycling in the blood vessel
  and the kidney, and the vascular endothelium cells can maintain NO synthesis via
  this pathway. In inflammatory pathology (increased oxidative stress status), arginase
  is induced in many cells, such as the blood vessels and macrophages, and NO synthesis
  derived from the vascular endothelium decreases through the “arginine steal phenomenon”.
  Increased catabolism of arginine via arginase may not only compromise the ability
  to synthesize NO constitutively but also increase the production of ornithine, a
  precursor for the synthesis of proline and polyamines, which are required for cell
  proliferation and collagen synthesis in the lungs. Abbreviations: ADMA, asymmetric
  dimethylarginine; ASL, argininosuccinate lyase; ASS, argininosuccinate synthetase;
  DDAH, dimethylaminohydrolase; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; OTC,
  ornithine transcarbamylase; PRMT, protein arginine methyltransferase.'
