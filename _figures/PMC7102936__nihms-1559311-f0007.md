caption: A. In the brain, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling is activated not just
  by nutrients and insulin but also by several tissue-specific inputs, including the
  neurotransmitter glutamate and the neurotrophic growth factor brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF). Dysregulation of the mTORC1 pathway is associated with a set of characteristic
  neurodevelopmental diseases, collectively termed ’mTORopathies’. Patients with mTORopathies
  suffer from severe epilepsy and may also display focal cortical dysplasia, macrocephaly
  or megalencephaly, cognitive and social defects, and benign tumours. Proteins from
  genes bearing mutations in neurodevelopmental diseases are shown in blue. B. Roles
  of mTORC1 and mTORC2 during neuronal development. Ablation of mTORC1 or mTORC2 in
  the nervous system perturbs cell and organ size and disrupts the cortical architecture
  of the brain. mTORC1 deletion also causes early postnatal lethality. C. Roles of
  mTORC1 and mTORC2 in postnatal maintenance of synaptic plasticity and homeostasis.
  mTORC1 regulates activity-dependent synaptic translation through its substrates
  eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2) and p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)
  to strengthen or weaken a given neuronal circuit; moreover, it also promotes synaptic
  plasticity by pruning obsolete synapses through autophagy. Autophagy may additionally
  play a neuroprotective role by degrading misfolded proteins and damaged organelles.
  mTORC2 remodels the actin cytoskeleton in response to neuronal signal transmission
  and helps convert transient excitatory events into long-term memory. AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; ASD, autism spectrum disorder; GATOR, GAP activity towards the Rags;
  IRS, insulin receptor substrate; LKB, liver kinase B1; NF1, neurofibromatosis type
  1; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate;
  PKC, protein kinase C; PMSE, polyhydramnios, megalencephaly and symptomatic epilepsy;
  PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue; STRADα, STE20-related kinase adapter protein-α;
