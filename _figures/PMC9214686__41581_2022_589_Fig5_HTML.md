caption: The cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING)
  pathway can be inhibited at many stages. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTI)
  block the synthesis of cGAS-activating complementary DNA from endogenous retroelements.
  Aminoquinoline-type antimalarial drugs (AMDs) block DNA binding to cGAS, whereas
  aspirin acetylates the cGAS residues Lys414, Lys384 and Lys394, which leads to its
  inactivation. Active site inhibitors block the synthesis of the second messenger
  2′,3′-cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP). For STING inhibition, both naturally occurring nitro-fatty
  acids (NO2-FAs) and the nitrofuran derivative, H-151, block palmitoylation of crucial
  cysteine residues on STING, preventing oligomerization of the protein. A number
  of different TBK1 inhibitors, mostly belonging to the aminopyrimidine class, such
  as compound II, have been generated and used to treat autoimmune disorders in mice.
  In contrast to attenuation of the cGAS–STING pathway, STING can be activated by
  synthetic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), which might be useful in enhancing antitumour
  immunity.
