caption: JAK-STAT signaling pathway and its interaction with viral proteins. The auto-
  and paracrine actions of IFNs lead to activation of JAK-STAT pathway and terminate
  into the formation of ISGF3. This transcription factor will initiate the transcription
  of hundred of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) containing interferon stimulated
  response element (ISRE). IAV proteins and IAV-induced cellular proteins such as
  SOCS act as negative regulators of JAK-STAT signaling pathway
