caption: 'Schematic diagram of natural and engineered pathways to biofuels and biofuel
  precursors in microbial platforms. Note, not all pathways are simultaneously present
  in any single microbe. Metabolic pathways are coloured thus — Core metabolism: light
  blue. Short chain alcohol pathways: purple. The Ehrlich degradative pathway to fusel
  alcohols: orange. Fatty acid metabolism: yellow. Isoprenoid MVA and MEP pathways:
  green. Terpenoid synthetic pathways: blue. The various biofuels are highlighted
  in red. Black arrows represent enzymatic transformations, with the enzymes or enzyme
  classes indicated. Blue arrows represent multiple enzymatic transformations in the
  metabolic pathways indicated. The red arrow represents abiotic, chemical conversion
  of TAGs to FAMEs and FAAEs. Abbreviations for enzymes are: PDC, Pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex; ALS, Acetolactate (acetohydroxyacid) synthase; ADH, Alcohol dehydrogenase;
  KDC, α-keto acid decarboxylase; PDH, Pyruvate dehydrogenase; FabH, 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]
  synthase; FabD, Malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase; Acc A/B/C/D, Acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; ACat, Acetyl transferase; AAS, Acyl-ACP synthase; TES, Thioesterase;
  AAR, Acyl-ACP reductase; FadD, acyl-CoA synthase; OleTJE, CYP152L1(cytochrome P450
  fatty acid peroxygenase); FAP, fatty acid photodecarboxylase; CAR, carboxylic acid
  reductase; CER, Wax ester synthase; DGAT, Diglyceride acyltransferase; FAR, Fatty
  acid reductase; ACR, acyl-CoA reductase; AHR, Aldehyde reductase; ADO, aldehyde
  deformylating oxygenase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HMGR, HMG-CoA
  reductase; MK, mevalonate kinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; PMD, phosphomevalonate
  decarboxylase; DXR/ispC, DXP reductoisomerase; IPPS, IPP isomerase; IDI, Isopentenyl-diphosphate
  delta isomerase; GPPS, geranyl diphosphate synthase; PS, pinene synthase; LS, limonene
  synthase; agBIS, bisabolene synthase; FS, farnesene synthase.'
