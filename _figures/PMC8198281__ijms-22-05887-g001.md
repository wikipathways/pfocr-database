caption: 'Glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis in the brain. Glucose enters the
  cell through GLUT and is converted to G6P by HK. Then, G6P can be processed by different
  metabolic pathways: (1) Glycolysis (shown by red arrows), which leads to lactic
  acid production or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. NADH and FADH2 are subsequently
  re-oxidized in ETC to produce ATP. (2) The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (shown
  by green arrows), which metabolizes G6P and generates NADPH. NADPH is then used
  for oxidative stress defense and biosynthetic reactions. (3) Glycogenesis (shown
  by blue arrows). Abbreviations are as follows: GLUT: glucose transporters; HK: Hexokinase;
  G6P: glucose-6-phosphate; G1P: glucose-1-phosphate; 6-PG: 6-phosphogluconate; G3P:
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; 1,3-BPG: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; Ru-5P: ribulose-5-phosphate;
  R-5P: ribose-5-phosphate.'
