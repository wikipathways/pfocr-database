caption: Impaired regulation of lipid metabolism by AMPK in renal cells in obesity/diabetes.
  Inhibition of AMPK and the increased FA overload lead to a decreased mitochondrial
  FA oxidation and an enhanced lipogenesis, initiating lipotoxicity in renal cells.
  Inhibitory phosphorylation of ACC by AMPK is removed, allowing for malonyl-CoA production,
  leading to inhibition of CPT-1 activity and suppression of FA oxidation in mitochondria.
  HMGCR and SREBP1-c are enhanced and initiate cholesterol and FA synthesis that contributes
  to a general increase of lipogenesis, leading to further lipid accumulation in renal
  cells. Excess FA content associated with impaired AMPK pathway and related lipid
  metabolism initiates ectopic lipid accumulation in renal cells, including harmful
  lipid metabolites (DAG, ceramides, and eicosanoids) that cause lipotoxicity. AMPK,
  AMP-activated protein kinase; ACC, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase; CPT1, Carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  I; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; HMGCR, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme
  A reductase; RXR, retinoid X receptor; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding
  proteins; FAS, fatty acid synthesis; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; DAG diacylglycerol;
  FFAs, free fatty acids. The arrow indicates whether the regulation is activating
  (black) or inhibitory (red). The dashed arrow indicates a potential regulation.
