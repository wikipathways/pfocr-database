caption: Schematic illustration of the possible mechanisms of Phi on TBI-mediated
  BBB damage. As illustrated, microglia become activated into an inflammatory state
  and release plenty of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-α,IL-1β, and IL-6 in
  the lesions of TBI. At the same time, phospho-NK-κB p65 is upregulated and translocates
  into the nuclei. Phi inhibits the nuclear translocation of phospho-NK-κB p65 by
  enhancing the PPARγ signaling pathway, promoting microglial “M2” polarization. Therefore,
  Phi mitigates BBB injury following TBI.
