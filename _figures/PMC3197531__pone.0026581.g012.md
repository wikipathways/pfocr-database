caption: Activation of ERK1/2-related signaling and the mTOR/P70S6K/S6 axis favors
  the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. Akt-induced phosphyrylation of GSK-3α/β
  inhibits its activity, thereby nullifying its anti-hypertrophic effect. Akt-induced
  phosphorylation of FOXOs also inhibits ist activity, negating its effects on activation
  of atrogin-1 and MuRF1, which results in decreased protein breakdown (atrophy).
  These multiple signaling scenarios likely contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiac
  hypertrophy and/or the anti-atrophic effect following sustained βAR stimulation.
  “→” represents activation, “⊣” represents inhibition. Solid lines represent data
  supplied by our study, and dotted lines represent hyperthetical schematics.
