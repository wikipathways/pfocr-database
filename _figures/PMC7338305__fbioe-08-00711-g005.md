caption: Strategies for precise single base editing. (A) Two-step stuffer-assisted
  point mutation. In the first step, a 20-nucleotide target genome sequence close
  to the target is replaced by a heterologous stuffer fragment via homologous recombination.
  In the second step, the stuffer fragment acts as the target sequence, recognized
  by a second gRNA, and the original sequence with arbitrary mutation is inserted
  back. Chr, chromosome. (B) ‘C→T’ mutation through DSB independent pathway. The dCas9
  or Cas9 nickase (nCas9, D10A) is fused with cytidine deaminase and uracil DNA glycosylase
  inhibitor (UGI), and binds to a DNA target. Cytidine deaminase converts the cytidine
  (‘C’) to uracil (‘U’) in the non-targeted strand, which is protected by UGI from
  the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. And in the next replication cycle,
  the ‘G:C’ base pair is repaired to ‘T:A’. (C) ‘A→G’ mutation through DSB independent
  pathway. The dCas9 or nCas9 is fused with adenosine deaminase and binds to a DNA
  target. Adenosine deaminase converts the adenosine (‘A’) to hypoxanthine (‘I’) in
  the non-targeted strand. And in the next replication cycle, the ‘T:A’ base pair
  is repaired to ‘C:G’.
