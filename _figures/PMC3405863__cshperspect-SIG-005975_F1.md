caption: Patterning of the early Drosophila embryo. (A) Anterior–posterior patterning
  and segmentation of the embryo is initiated by maternally deposited gene products
  that regulate the expression of gap genes. Gap genes in turn control the expression
  of pair-rule genes, which themselves regulate segment-polarity genes. The gene hierarchy
  and activation/repression interactions between different transcription factors that
  coordinate patterning of the anterior–posterior axis of the early Drosophila embryo
  are shown to the right. (B) Dorsal–ventral patterning is initiated by a Dorsal nuclear
  gradient regulated by the Toll/NF-κB pathway. Graded nuclear localization of Dorsal
  subdivides the dorso–ventral axis into distinct domains expressing twist (twi) and
  snail (sna), rhomboid (rho) and decapendaplegic (dpp), zerknullt (zen) and tolloid
  (tld), which will form the prospective mesoderm, neurogenic ectoderm, and dorsal
  ectoderm, respectively. Dorsal activates the zygotic transcription program in the
  dorsoventral axis. (C) Terminal patterning is initiated in the germline by the localized
  expression of Torsolike in the space outside the poles of the embryo. Torsolike
  activates the Torso ligand (Trunk) locally and this is followed by Torso activation
  at the poles of the embryo, which will lead to induction of the terminal patterning
  genes tailless and huckebein. Torso is an RTK and its action is propagated through
  the MAPK pathway.
