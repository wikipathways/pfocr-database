caption: The single-cell RNAseq analysis workflow. It starts with sequencing of cancer
  cells and goes to the use of unsupervised learning methods, combined with pathway
  analysis, to generate a list of a few genes. Those genes become candidates for informing
  the design of focused laboratory experiments for learning novel biology of drug
  action.
