caption: 'Key steps for the synthesis of steroids and adrenal androgens are shown
  along with the enzymes inhibited by drugs used for treatment of CRPC including ketoconazole
  (Keto) and CYP17A1 inhibitors: Abiraterone acetate (AA), Orteronel (Ort), Galetertone
  (Gal), VT464, and CFG920. CYP17A1 catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone to 17α-pregnenolone
  and progesterone to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone through its 17α-hydroxylase activity
  pulling steroids down the pathway for androgen synthesis. In addition, CYP17A1 catalyzes
  the final steps in androgen synthesis through its C17,20-lyase activity, converting
  17α-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and 17α -hydroxyprogestrone
  to androstenedione. The enzyme 3β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) is also
  important in androgen production as it catalyzes the conversion of DHEA to androstenedione.'
