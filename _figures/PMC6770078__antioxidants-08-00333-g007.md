caption: Effects of anthocyanins on pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signaling pathways.
  Anthocyanins modulate several signaling pathways involved in cell survival and death.
  Anthocyanins inhibit the activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p53, which
  are responsible for activating pro-apoptotic family members of the Bcl-2 family
  of proteins, Bim, Bad, Puma, and Noxa. Bim, Puma, and Noxa are known to inhibit
  the pro-survival functions of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), causing activation of the
  pro-apoptotic protein, Bax. Bax can also be activated by interaction with Bad. Bax
  then forms pores in the mitochondrial membrane, allowing the release of cytochrome
  c from mitochondria. Cytochrome c interacts with apoptosis protease activating factor-1
  (APAF-1) and caspase-9 to form the apoptosome. The apoptosome then cleaves procaspase-3
  to form active caspase-3, stimulating apoptosis. Anthocyanins also enhance the activity
  of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pro-survival signaling pathway, which
  inhibits activity of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members including Bim, Bad, and
  Bax, in addition to inhibiting the activity of p53. This activity inhibits entry
  of neurons into caspase-dependent apoptosis. Alternatively, anthocyanins have also
  been shown to inhibit caspase-independent apoptosis by blocking the translocation
  of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the cytosol and subsequently,
  the nucleus (dashed arrow).
