caption: Schematic representation of the equilibria involved in HCO4− formation from
  H2O2 and HCO3−/CO2 (A) and of the mechanism proposed for the stimulatory effect
  of HCO3−/CO2 on H2O2-mediated Prx1 hyperoxidation and inactivation is shown. A,
  mechanism of HCO4− formation from H2O2/HOO− was from Richardson and co-workers ();
  the rate constants of all proposed reactions (Table S1) were used to perform the
  computer simulation HCO4− formation from H2O2 (0.5 mm) and HCO3−/CO2 (25 mm) displayed
  in Fig. S4. B, stimulatory effect of HCO3−/CO2 on H2O2-mediated Prx1 hyperoxidation
  is attributed to HCO4−. 2-Cys Prx is represented by its minimal functional unit,
  which is a homodimer, with one of the peroxidatic (CPS−) and one of the resolving
  Cys (CRSH) shown. HCO4− coexists in H2O2 solutions containing HCO3−/CO2 (A) and
  oxidizes CPSOH to CPSO2− with a second-order rate constant 2 orders of magnitude
  higher than that of H2O2. HCO4− should not influence the first step of the Prx1
  catalytic cycle, because the reduction of H2O2 and concomitant oxidation of CPS−
  to CPSOH is extremely rapid. Prx1 hyperoxidation is an inactivation pathway that
  depends on specific Prx1 structural features that determine the lifetime of the
  CPSOH intermediate. Because HCO4− is considerably more reactive toward the CPSOH
  intermediate than H2O2, it will redirect higher levels of CPSOH from the catalytic
  cycle to the hyperoxidation and inactivation pathway. Our data suggested but did
  not prove that HCO4− oxidizes CPSO2H to CPSO3H more rapidly than H2O2 justifying
  the use of broken lines in the second step of the hyperoxidation pathway (see text).
