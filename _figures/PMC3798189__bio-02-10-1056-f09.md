caption: In cold exposure, hepatic glycogen and glucose are thought to be used in
  the pentose phosphate pathway for NADPH supply rather than in energy production
  through glycolysis. This mechanism suppresses oxidative stress derived from iron
  accumulation caused by hepatic erythrocyte degradation. Abbreviations for the substrate
  and enzymes are shown in .
