  tracer studies using [13C2] glycine, [13C] formate, [13C5] glutamate, and [U13C] yeast
  extract. The carbon fluxes were normalized to the specific riboflavin production
  rate (8.7 ± 2.3 µmol g−1 h−1), which was set to 100%. Riboflavin was obtained at
  the end of the growth phase of riboflavin producing A. gossypii after 144 h. Data
  are derived from positional 13C enrichment obtained from 13C NMR measurements (Table ),

  medium. Note that the model is simplified and cannot distinguish between carbon
  flux through e.g. gluconeogenesis or lower PP pathway as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase.

  for riboflavin biosynthesis were considered and all reactions represent net fluxes.

  i.e. all decarboxylation reactions and in general all reactions with more than one
  educt or product can be expressed as a single flux. All fluxes from the medium into
  the cell are not fluxes based on concentrations, but solely derived from 13C labeling
