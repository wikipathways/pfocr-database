caption: Direct immunomodulatory function of TDEs on CD8+ T cells. TDEs exert regulatory
  control over CD8+ T cells through their cargo and surface molecules. These surface
  molecules, including PD-L1, FasL, TRAIL, PS, and NKG2DL, directly interact with
  cognate ligands or receptors, impeding the activation and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T
  cells while promoting apoptosis. In addition, TDEs indirectly modulate CD8+ T cell
  function by influencing molecules like CD39 and CD73, which convert ATP into adenosine,
  thereby suppressing the cytotoxic abilities of CD8+ T cells. ICAM-1, through its
  interaction with LFA-1, promotes the adhesion of TDEs and CD8+ T cells. Additionally,
  TβRII induces CD8+ T cell exhaustion by activating the TGF-β signaling pathway.
  Simultaneously, the cargo enclosed within TDEs also holds significant importance
  in immune regulation. The TDEs contained miRNAs, circRNAs, and proteins function
  by suppressing the proliferation (e.g., miR-24-3p, ARG1, etc.), differentiation
  (e.g., miR-891a, miR-106a-5p, etc.), activation (e.g., miR-3187-3p, etc.), and cytotoxicity
  (e.g., HLA-G, etc.) of CD8+ T cells, while facilitating cellular exhaustion (e.g.,
  circUSP7, OGT, etc.). As a result, they effectively undermine the anti-tumor effects
  of CD8+ T cells. TDEs, tumor-derived extracellular vesicles; PD-L1, programmed cell
  death ligand-1; FasL, Fas ligand; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
