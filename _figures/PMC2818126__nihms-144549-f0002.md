caption: Metabolic pathway schematic. Two key regulatory enzymes of mitochondrial
  metabolism include the αketoglutarate dehydrogenase (αKGDH) and pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH). αKGDH balances TCA cycle flux to exchange of metabolite across the αKG-malate
  carrier. PDH is a key enzyme regulating the balance between glucose and fatty acid
  (palmitate) oxidation. Both αKGDH and PDH are sensitive to Ca2+ load in normal heart.
  In this study, we determined if both responded to the reported reduction in calcium
  overload observed in reperfused hearts overexpressing SERCA1 (). We found metabolite
  exchange across the αKG-malate carrier increased with SERCA1 expression, while the
  balance between palmitate and glucose oxidation via PDH was unaffected.
