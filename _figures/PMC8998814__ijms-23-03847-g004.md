caption: 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Extracellular
  signals such as growth factors and cytokines, as well as intracellular signals such
  as oxidative and DNA damage, activate MAPK pathways. GTPases (activators) such as
  RAS, RAS-related protein (RAC), and cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42)
  constitute the first layer of MAPK signaling cascade, which conveys the signal to
  downstream protein kinases. The MAPK signaling cascades consist of three kinases:
  mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase (MAPKK), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and results in
  proliferation, migration, differentiation, survival, or apoptosis. Mammalian MAPK
  pathways include ERK MAPK, P38 MAPK, and JNK MAPK signaling events. ERK/MAPK pathway
  is activated by RAS, which is attracted to the plasma membrane through receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) activation. In this
  cascade, MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  1/2 (ERK1/2). P38/MAPK and JNK/MAPK pathways are triggered by various insults that
  activate signaling through MKK3/6 or MKK4/7 (MAPKKs), respectively, that are activated
  upon MAPKKK s such apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), transforming growth
  factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), MEKK1 (MAPKKK), and MLK3 (MAPKKK). ERK3/4 are
  considered atypical MAPK kinases [].'
