caption: PD-1 signaling in B cells and T cells. a In B cells, upon PD-1 activation,
  SHP-2 is recruited to the C-terminal of PD-1 and dephosphorylates downstream members
  of the BCR pathway (e.g., SyK, Igα/β), thereby disrupting the normal BCR response
  as well as inhibiting PLCγ2, ERK, and PI3K signaling. This PD-1 activation consequently
  reduces the stability of the immunological synapse as well as B cell cycle arrest
  and causes disorder of Ca2+ mobilization. b In T cells, when PD-1 combines with
  PD-L1, SHP-1/2 are recruited to the C-terminal of PD-1 immediately and dephosphorylate
  key signal transducers, including the ZAP70, CD3δ, and PI3K pathways, thus suppressing
  TCR-mediated cell proliferation and cytokine production
