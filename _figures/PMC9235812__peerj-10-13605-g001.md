caption: In this study, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used to establish
  prenatal maternal stress model. The period was 21 days. After the stress was completed,
  fresh feces were collected from the mother rat. The fresh feces of offspring were
  collected at 20 days after birth (PND20) for testing, they was weaned at PND21 and
  the emotional function were determined using Sucrose preference test (SPT), Open-field
  test (OFT) and tail suspension test (TST) at PND42. The microorganisms in feces
  of mother and offspring was determined by the 16S rRNA V3–V4 region sequence in
  Illumina MiSeqPE300 sequencing technology. The offspring’s plasma was collected
  PND50, the expression of hippocampal BDNF, TrkB and CREB were respectively measured
  using RT-PCR and Western blotting.
