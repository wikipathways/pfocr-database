caption: Classical pathway of glycogen metabolism in prokaryotes. Pgm converts glucose-6-phosphate
  into glucose-1-phosphate, which serves as a substrate for ADP-glucose synthesis
  catalyzed by glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase (GlgCD) encoded by glgC and
  glgD genes. Then, GlgA catalyzes the transfer of glucosyl moieties from ADP-glucose
  to the elongating chain of linear α-1,4-glucan; GlgB subsequently cleaves off a
  portion of the glucan and attaches it to existing chains via α-1,6 linkages to form
  the glycogen structure. For glycogen degradation, GlgP sequentially releases glucose
  moieties from the non-reducing ends to form glucose-1-phosphate and α-1,6-branched
  dextrins. GlgX or Amy hydrolyzes the α-1,6 branches of the phosphorylase-limit dextrins
  (typically 3–5 glucosyl residues in length) leading to the release of maltodextrins.
  Glycogen biosynthetic steps are indicated in red arrows, whereas glycogen degradation
  pathway is indicated in dashed purple arrows.
