caption: The proposed biosynthetic pathways of hypericin. The biosynthesis of hypericin
  and its protoforms using emodin (1) and emodin anthrone (2) as precursors is represented
  on the left side with green colored arrows. The localization of compounds is represented
  in blue color according to our previous work []. The biosynthesis of skyrin (7)
  and proposed hypericin (6) production through skyrin (7) as a precursor is represented
  on the right with violet arrows []. Our present work reports for the first time,
  the occurrence and spatial distribution of skyrin (7) and its precursors in Hypericum
  leaves concomitant to hypericin (6), its protoforms (3–5), as well as its previously
  proposed precursors emodin (1) and emodin anthrone (2).
