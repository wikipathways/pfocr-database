caption: Schematic outline of CD30 signaling and CD30 promoter induction by Ets-1–JunB
  in ALCL and HL. Although the contribution of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
  factor (TRAF)–IκB kinase (IKK)–IκB–NF-κB pathway differs in HL and ALCL cells, the
  CD30-ERK1/2 MAPK–Ets-1–JunB pathway is a common pathway that maintains overexpression
  of CD30 and supports cell survival. NPM-ALK supports overexpression of CD30 and
  survival of lymphoma cells by activating the NPM-ALK-ERK1/2 MAPK–Ets-1–JunB pathway
  in systemic ALCL NPM-ALK(+).
