caption: Model for KSHV v-cyclin-induced dysregulation of Notch signaling during lymphomagenesis.
  Expression of v-cyclin within T-cells reprograms the functions of its cognate kinase
  CDK6, an important regulator of lymphocyte development. By hijacking CDK6, v-cyclin
  alters intracellular signaling and up-regulates expression of Notch 3. Proteolytic
  cleavage of Notch at the cell surface by gamma-secretase causes accumulation of
  the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus and facilitates
  transcription of HES1, HEY1 and CCND3. The emerging role for Notch pathway dysregulation
  during KSHV infection suggests that therapeutics targeting this pathway, such as
  gamma-secretase inhibitors, may be used to combat KSHV-associated lymphomas.
