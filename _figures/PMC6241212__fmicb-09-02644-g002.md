caption: Innate antiviral immune responses during viral infection. Upon viral infection,
  viral RNA is detected by cytosolic RLRs (RIG-I, MDA-5 or LGP2) and/or membrane bound
  TLRs, triggering a signal transduction cascade that culminates in the transcription
  of innate molecules including IFN, pro-inflammatory cytokines and ISGs. Cytosolic
  RNA is detected by RIG-I, MDA5 and presumably LGP2. RIG-I recognizes RNAs containing
  5′ppp and panhandle-like secondary structures. MDA5 recognizes dsRNA. LGP2 might
  regulate the functions of RIG-I and MDA5. Interaction of RIG-I and MDA5 RNA exposes
  their CARD domains. RIG-I is subsequently ubiquitinated with unanchored K63-linked
  Ub chains. MDA5 stacks along dsRNA and form helical filaments. Discrete CARD oligomers
  (with or without Ub) align on CARD domains of mitochondrial MAVS inducing its polymerization.
  Endosomal RNAs are detected by TLR3 or TLR7/8, which interact with adaptor proteins
  TRIF and MyD88, respectively. MyD88 uses other adaptors, IRAK1/4 to allow for interaction
  with TRAF proteins. Polymerization of MAVS or conformational changes on TRIF and
  MyD88/IRAK1/4 recruit E3 ligases, mainly TRAF3 and TRAF6. These E3 ligases synthesize
  poly-Ub that are sensed by NEMO to recruit TBK1 or IKK. NEMO/TBK1 complexes lead
  mainly to phosphorylation of IRF3/7 (although IRF1 or IRF5 might also be phosphorylated).
  Phosphorylated IRFs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus. The IKK complex phosphorylates
  IκB causing its degradation and detachment of NF-κB which then translocates to the
  nucleus. The same IKK complex can phosphorylate IRF7. Nuclear homo and heterodimers
  of IRF3 and IRF7 bind to the IFNβ promoter to stimulate its transcription. Nuclear
  NF-κB binds the IFNβ promoter but also promoters of many proinflammatory cytokines
  such as TNFα, IL-1, etc. Binding of dimers of phosphorylated IRF7 is essential for
  the expression of IFNα. In parallel, E3 ligases can activate MAPK3 and subsequently
  other kinases including ERK1/2 and JNK which phosphorylate the components of the
  AP1 heterodimer followed by translocation to the nucleus to cooperate with the induction
  of IFNβ transcription. Secreted IFN can act in an autocrine and paracrine manner
  by binding to its receptor (IFNR). Upon binding JAKs (JAK1 and TYK2) are activated
  to phosphorylate the IFNAR receptor, also allowing for JAK dependent phosphorylation
  of STAT1 and STAT2 (although other STATs may also be affected). Heterodimers of
  STAT1/2 interact with IRF9 to form the ISGF3G complex which translocate to the nucleus
  and binds DNA to drive the expression of over 300 ISGs, many of which display antiviral
  activity. Homodimers of STAT1 translocate to the nucleus and mainly enhance transcription
  of proinflammatory cytokines. Many proteins of the pathway (RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, TRAF3/6,
  MyD88, and IRF3/7/1/5) are targets for deUbiquitination and/or deISGylation and
  serve as negative regulators of the IFN signaling pathway. For instance, USP18 remove
  ISG15 from ISG15-conjugated substrates by cleaving the isopeptide bond between ISG15
  and its targeted substrate. Other negative regulators of IFN signaling include SOCS
  and PIAS. Formation of SGs and activation of autophagy can be detected during innate
  immunity signaling responses.
