caption: Tryptophan homeostasis overview. The figure represents the main checkpoints
  of tryptophan homeostasis from food intake to elimination. The steps increasing
  the systemic concentration of tryptophan are depicted in red and the steps decreasing
  tryptophan, in blue. Entry of tryptophan in the systemic circulation is first conditioned
  by intestinal absorption through polarized cells (left side), optimized to get a
  maximum of dietary tryptophan. Once absorbed, the tryptophan contained in the portal
  vein is filtered by the liver and mainly metabolized by TDO (center), before entering
  in the systemic circulation. High amino-acid levels and postprandial hormones activate
  the mTOR pathway in muscles and peripheral tissues (top), stimulating protein synthesis
  and amino-acid storage. When amino-acid levels are low, inactivation of mTOR slows
  down translation and induces protein autophagy, which contributes to amino-acid
  saving and release. A small percentage of tryptophan is metabolized in serotonin
  by TPH1/2 and in kynurenine by IDO1 in peripheral tissues (right side). Almost all
  the tryptophan present in the glomerular ultrafiltrate is actively reabsorbed by
  polarized cells of the proximal renal tubules (bottom). Excess circulating tryptophan
  is filtered by hepatocytes and degraded by TDO (center).
