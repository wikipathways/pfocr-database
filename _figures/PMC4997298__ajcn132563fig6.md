caption: 'Upstream regulatory analysis of weight-loss–associated genes identified
  strong C/EBPα activation. With the use of 161 genes that were correlated with weight
  loss, their respective Pearson correlation coefficients were used in an ingenuity
  pathway analysis: upstream analysis, which identified potential regulators that
  either are responsible or mimic the effect of exercise- and diet-induced weight
  loss (Supplemental Table 4). A strong activation of C/EBPα (z score = 2, P = 6.6
  × 10−7) occurred, which led to numerous downstream signalings that ultimately affected
  adipogenesis. *Significantly regulated by C/EBPα in multiple species. ACACA, acetyl-CoA
