caption: This network represents the interactions among the top-ranked genes participating
  in fusions in (A)T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and (B) B-cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia. Biological network analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA). Input for this analysis is the list of unique genes that form fusions in
  a cancer type. IPA compares this list to relevant networks, gene regulators, and
  mechanistic networks based on their connectivity score. Two genes are considered
  to be connected in a network if a path (edge) is present between them in the network.
  Arrows indicate gene/protein interactions of molecules (in gray) within genes in
  the pathway. The shape of the gene represents the molecule/functional class, which
  are nodes in the network, and the relationship between them is indicated by edges.
  Genes participating in fusions in each cancer is highlighted in blue in this figure.
  Biological network analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).
