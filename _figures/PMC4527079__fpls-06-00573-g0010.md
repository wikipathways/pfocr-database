caption: Schematic presentation of main plant defense processes in Aspergillus flavus-maize
  interactions. A. flavus can attack kernels during all the six stages of their development.
  However, infection in non-injured kernels takes place later in the field, during
  the dent (R5) developmental stage just prior to physiological maturity (R6) (Marsh
  and Payne, ). As soon as 4 days after inoculation A. flavus mycelium reaches the
  aleurone, endosperm and germ tissue (Dolezal et al., ). Transcriptional analysis
  of the maize—A. flavus pathogen interaction revealed down-regulated (black arrow)
  starch biosynthesis and up-regulated genes (white arrows) of plant starch hydrolytic
  enzymes like β-amylase as well as downstream invertases and fructokinase. The produced
  hexoses flow through the up-regulated shikimate (SM) pathway, the methylerithryole
  (ME) pathway and toward up-regulated jasmonic acid (JA) and oxylipin biosynthesis,
  and feed pathogenesis related (PR) protein synthesis, e.g., peroxidases, glutathione
  S-transferase (GST) or chitinases that were also found up-regulated during infection.
  Oxylipins up-regulate aflatoxin (AF) biosynthesis and sexual reproduction in A.
  flavus and down-regulate fungal growth. Up-regulation of the SM pathway leads to
  the production of antifungal compounds flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, phytoalexins,
  and up-regulated lignin production in maize. Up-regulated plant hormone JA and abscisic
  acid (ABA) production is crucial in these defense mechanisms (Dolezal et al., ).
