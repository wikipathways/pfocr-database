caption: 'The secretion, activation and ligand-receptor binding of PDGF signaling
  pathway. PDGF-A, and PDGF-B are activated intracellularly while PDGF-C and PDGF-D
  are secreted in a latent state and activated by matrix enzymes extracellularly.
  Distinct affinity exists in binding between PDGFs and receptors. PDGF: platelet-derived
  growth factor'
