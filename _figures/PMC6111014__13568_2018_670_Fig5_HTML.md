caption: Differences in metabolic pathways for production of ethanol and energy supply
  with glucose, xylose and mixed sugars fermentation. Ethanol, aromatic acids and
  ribotides are synthesized from glucose (blue lines), xylose (red lines), or both
  glucose and xylose (purple lines) on glucose fermentation (a), xylose fermentation
  (b), and glucose/xylose co-fermentation (c) via the glycolytic pathway and pentose
  phosphate pathway
papertitle: Systematic optimization of gene expression of pentose phosphate pathway
  enhances ethanol production from a glucose/xylose mixed medium in a recombinant
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
