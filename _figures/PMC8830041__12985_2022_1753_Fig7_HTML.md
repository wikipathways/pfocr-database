caption: A model of regulatory effects of IL-17A on anti-HBV activity of IFN-α. IFN-α
  exerts anti-HBV activity by activating JAK-STAT signaling pathway including STAT1
  and STAT2 phosphorylation, transcription factor ISGF3 formation, and at last antiviral
  ISGs expression. Various pro-inflammatory cytokines cross-regulate the IFN-α response
  by altering the expression and activation of IFN-α signaling components. The pro-inflammatory
  function of IL-17A is primarily mediated by NF-κB signal activated by ACT1-TRAF6.
  In our study, IL-17A attenuates IFN-α-mediated anti-HBV activity through reduced
  expression and activation of ISGF3. Furthermore, IL-17A also enhances expression
  of negative regulators, including SOCS1/3 and USP18, inhibits expression of anti-viral
  ISGs and accelerates degradation of IFNAR1
