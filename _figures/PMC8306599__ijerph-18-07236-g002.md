caption: 'Signaling pathways induced by the activation of the receptor of AGEs. (a)
  RAGE is a cell surface receptor composed of three extracellular domains, a transmembrane
  domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. (b) AGEs bind to RAGE’s extracellular portion
  and induce activation of the cytoplasmic domain, leading to different signaling
  pathways, which will finally result in the stimulation of transcription factors
  such as NF-KB and ISRE. Three pathways that can lead to such a response: (c) activation
  of the protein p21, which induces RAF-1, MEKK-1, and MEK 3/6 proteins that activate
  the factors ERK, JNK, and MAPK, which translocate to the cell nucleus. (d) Activation
  of the JAK2/STAT1 pathway, where STAT1 dimerizes and binds to the IRF1 sequence
  to translocate to the cell nucleus, binding to the ISRE segment and inducing transcription
  of proinflammatory cytokines. (e) Activation of the NADPH oxidase that leads to
  the stimulation of NF-KB. These processes can be activated by other molecules such
  as S100, Mac-1, HMBG-1, and β-amyloids. NF-kB: nuclear factor kappa light chain
