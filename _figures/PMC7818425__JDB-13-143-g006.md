caption: Overview of the selected features and functions. (A) List of single nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) and their respective genes. (B‐D) Features belonging to the
  lipid oxidation pathway (B), phospholipase A2 (C) and pentose metabolism (D). The
  metabolites in gray were not selected as features but were added to the figures
  merely to complete the pathways
