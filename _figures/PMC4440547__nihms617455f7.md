caption: 'Our proposed pathway: UVB exposure leads to increased COX-2 expression which
  results in increased PGE2 production. PGE2 binds and activates its G-protein coupled
  receptor, EP2. Upon the binding of PGE2, Gαs binds to Axin resulting in the release
  of GSK3β from the phosphorylation/destruction complex. Concurrently, the Gβγ subunits
  stimulate Akt, through PI3K, leading to the phosphorylation and inactivation of
  GSK3β. This allows for stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin which translocates
  to the nucleus and activates transcription of target genes, such as AXIN2. Activation
  of β-catenin signaling could contribute to the proliferative response of keratinocytes
  to UVB radiation.'
