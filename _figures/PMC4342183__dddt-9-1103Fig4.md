caption: 'p53 pathway in the target list of hsa-miR-181a-5p, based on TarBase 6.0.Notes:
  hsa-miR-181a-5p can regulate the p53 signaling pathway. p53 is situated at the crossroads
  of a network of signaling pathways that are essential for cell growth regulation
  and apoptosis induced by genotoxic and nongenotoxic stresses. In normal unstressed
  cells, the level of p53 protein is downregulated via the binding of proteins such
  as MDM2, COP1, PIRH2, or JNK, which promote p53 degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome
  pathway. As most of these genes are upregulated by p53, this leads to a regulation
  loop that will keep p53 level very low in normal cells. After exposure to genotoxic
  or nongenotoxic stresses, p53 protein level is increased via the inhibition of its
  interaction with MDM2 and the other negative regulators. A series of modulators,
  such as kinases and acetylases, will activate p53 transcriptional activity. Regardless
  of the type of stress, the final outcome of p53 activation is either cell cycle
  arrest and DNA repair or apoptosis. Dysfunctional p53 due to mutations will lead
  to tumorigenesis. p53 mutations can be found in 50% of human cancers including EC,
  but their penetrance is highly heterogeneous. Mutations in various pathways upstream
  of p53 (eg, ATM, p19ARF, or Hcdk2 gene) can be observed in various types of cancer,
  including EC. Targets of hsa-miR-181a-5p are marked with a red star.Abbreviation:
  EC, endometrial cancer.'
