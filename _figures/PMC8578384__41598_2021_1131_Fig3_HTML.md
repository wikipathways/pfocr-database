caption: SERPING1 encodes C1INH, which suppresses complement and coagulation cascades
  and prevents inflammation. SERPING1 in the testis could prevent thrombotic risk.
  The interaction of several CoV2 proteins (ORF 3b, ORF7b, ORF14, nsp2ab, nsp13ab,
  nsp14ab and nsp8ab) with C1-INH can be inhibited during viral infection, leading
  to a predisposition to activate the complement cascade, the bradykinin pathway and
  the intrinsic coagulation cascade. The deletion in N-terminal region of SERPING1
  by SARS-CoV-2 may block its function and increase inflammatory processes. Deteriorated
  SERPING1 expression caused by CoV2 interacting proteins could activate the intrinsic
  coagulation pathway, inducing a pro-coagulant state. CCR5 is involved in the pathology
  of SARS-CoV-2. In SARS-CoV-2 the chemotactic factors such as CCL4, CCL8, and CCL11
  sharing CCR5 as a receptor are upregulated. ADAM10 is correlated with ACE2 cleavage
  regulation in human airway epithelia. BST2 reduces SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication. BST-2
  is strongly induced after exposure to IFN through IRF1. BST2 expression is modulated
  by the TLR4/PI3K signaling pathway. Activation of TLR4 results in TRIF/IRF3-mediated
  positive regulation of BST-2. TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are predominantly localized in
  intracellular compartments and form the key gatekeepers in detecting and combating
  viral infections. In COVID-19 patients, host tetherin-mediated virion endocytosis
  may control TLR9 recognition to restrain immune cell responses. Several host factors
  such as the HMGB1 facilitate entry of self-DNA into the endosomes of pDCs, where
  they trigger TLR9 to induce type 1 IFN responses. GATA-1 is a potent repressor of
  CCR5 expression. CCR5 inhibition decreases IL-6 and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia.
