caption: Anti-inflammatory function of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor
  (TRAF)2 and TRAF3 in toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. In responds to
  TLR stimulation, TRAF6 is recruited to the MyD88 signaling complex. Upon activation,
  the TRAF6 complex relocates from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, a signaling
  step required for activation of the downstream nuclear factor κB and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. TRAF3 negatively regulates TLR-stimulated proinflammatory
  cytokine induction via two potential mechanisms. The first is to target the MyD88–TRAF6
  complex and prevents the relocation of TRAF6 to the cytoplasm, and the second is
  to function together TRAF2 and cIAPs to mediate ubiquitin-dependent degradation
  of two major proinflammatory transcription factors, c-Rel and interferon regulatory
  factor 5 (IRF5). TLR signaling temporarily overrides the negative signaling function
  of TRAF3 by inducing TRAF3 proteolysis. In this process, TRAF6 activates cIAPs (cIAP1
  and cIAP2) through K63 ubiquitination, which in turn function as E3 ubiquitin ligases
  to mediate K48-linked ubiquitination and proteolysis of TRAF3. In microglia, Peli1
  appears to cooperate with TRAF6 or function downstream of TRAF6 to mediate cIAP
  activation.
