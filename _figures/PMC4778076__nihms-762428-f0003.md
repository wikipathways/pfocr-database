caption: Sperm contact with the egg jelly triggers production of NAADP (1), which
  has been implicated in vesicle membrane fusion for the acrosomal reaction (2) and/or
  suggested to be delivered as the activating molecule to the eggs. Sperm-egg contact
  (3) has been shown to trigger a NAADP-dependent Ca2+ current that activate voltage-operated
  Ca2+ channels (VOC) in the membrane allowing Ca2+ influx for the cortical Ca2+ flash
  and the membrane depolarization responsible for the fast block to polyspermy (4).
  Coordinately, sperm egg interaction also triggers PLC activation and IP3 production,
  leading to IP3 receptors activation and amplification of the Ca2+ signal to form
  the wave by coupling with RyR receptors via CICR (5). The Ca2+ wave triggers the
  exocytosis of the cortical granules leading to the elevation of the fertilization
  envelope (FE) (6), which works as a shield for additional sperm, the slow block
  to polyspermy mechanism. Additionally, TPCs in acidic vesicles are found in the
  egg periphery and may play a role in local Ca2+ release events triggered by NAADP.
  ARCs are located in secretory vesicles, cortical granules and/or the plasma membrane,
  and may be responsible for differential production of either cADPR or NAADP.
