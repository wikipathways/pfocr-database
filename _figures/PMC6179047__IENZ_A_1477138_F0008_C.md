caption: A schematic view of the mechanisms whereby the p38 inhibitor SB203580 may
  reduce β cell apoptosis. ERS leads to cellular apoptosis through activation of the
  p38 MAPK pathway. Activation of p38 can promote the activation of ERS pathways,
  thus inducing apoptosis. By contrast, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 attenuates activation
  of the p38 MAPK pathway, reducing apoptosis mediated through the p38 pathway, but
  also by inhibition of ERS, as part of a benign cycle.
