caption: Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) and immune pathways to therapy. Naïve
  B cells are activated by exposure to antigens. In tertiary lymph nodes or in tertiary
  lymphoid tissue within an affected tissue, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells help
  B cells differentiate into antibody secreting cells. Interleukins (IL) 4, 10 and
  21 are critical to B-cell affinity maturation, class switching and clonal expansion.
  At the site of disease, B cells are thought to interact with cytolytic T cells by
  the mutual expression of signalling lymphocytic activation molecule 7 (SLAM7). These
  effector T cells secrete profibrogenic cytokines that may be critical to subsequent
  storiform fibrosis, and cytolytic enzymes. The exact nature of the B cell to cytotoxic
  T cell interaction is still unclear. Therapy targeting CD20 (rituximab) leads to
  a reduction of plasmablasts as a consequence of killing their parent cells; plasmablasts
  do not express CD20. XmAb587 1 is a monoclonal antibody therapy that targets CD19
  and enhances FcγRIIb-mediated inhibition—a receptor that inhibits B-cell function.
  A phase II trial examining the effect of XmAb5871 in IgG4-RD has completed enrolment.
  Elotuzumab leads to SLAM7-induced antibody directed cellular cytotoxicity in multiple
  myeloma. The utility of elotuzumab in IgG4-RD is currently only theoretical. Other
  therapies that may interfere with the pathogenic process are beyond the scope of
  this article, but could include therapy targeting the BAFF APRIL pathway (belimumab,
  atacicept); BAFF is critical for B-cell survival. Ag, antigen; APRIL, a proliferation-inducing
  ligand; BAFF, B-cell activating factor; BCR, B-cell receptor; CXCR5, chemokine receptor
  type 5; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TCR, T cell receptor.
