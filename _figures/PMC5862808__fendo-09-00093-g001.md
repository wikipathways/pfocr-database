caption: 'Comparison between healthy (A) and cancer (B) cells: circadian and metabolic
  differences in NADPH cellular handling. In both entities, there is a dual interaction
  between the transcriptional and the redox circadian clocks. However, in cancerous
  cells, the daily variations in biochemical and molecular phenomena are disrupted.
  A major difference between a normal and a transformed cancer cell is the bioenergetic
  adaptation in which the main mitochondrial activity is no longer ATP production
  (glycolysis/oxidative phosphorylation en healthy cells) but the constant input of
  metabolic intermediaries (Warburg effect, or aerobic glycolysis, in cancerous cells)
  that are needed for cellular duplication. A distinctive biochemical characteristic
  in carcinogenesis is the increased availability of the anabolic coenzyme, NADPH;
  NADPH can be potentially be formed by various enzymatic reactions. Regarding the
  higher levels of NADPH, the production of acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) is also increased by
  the activity of the cytoplasmic enzyme citrate lyase. In the figure, events or enzymatic
  reactions that show circadian rhythmicity are depicted by the symbol ~; for example,
  circadian rhythmicity of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in normal cells. Question
  marks (?) indicate events or enzymatic reactions that have not been characterized
  as showing putative daily rhythmicity in either healthy or cancer cells.'
