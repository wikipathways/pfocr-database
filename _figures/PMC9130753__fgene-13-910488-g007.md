caption: Analysis of lncRNAs involved in the abscisic acid and jasmonic acid signaling
  transduction pathways of hickory female flower buds. Heat maps in the boxes showed
  the expression level of lncRNAs (lncRNA identifier) and the target genes (CCA identifier)
  of these lncRNAs. In the Carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, the secretion of Abscisic
  acid promoted the expression of PYL, which in turn inhibited the expression of SnRK2,
  which was positively correlated with the expression of ABF. All three genes were
  regulated by lncRNA cis-acting, thereby affecting Stomatal closure and seed dormancy.
  In the α-Linolenic acid metabolism pathway, the production of JA-ile from jasmonic
  acid was affected by JAR1, which was also regulated by lncRNA in cis-acting. CCA,
  Carya cathayensis; ABF, ABRE-binding factor; JAR1, JASMONATE RESISTANT 1; PYL, Pyrabactin
  resistance-like; SnRK2, SNF1-related protein kinase 2.
