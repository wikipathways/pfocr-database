caption: 'Schematic representation of the relationship between mitochondrial homeostasis
  and the properties of GDF15: GDF15 modulates mitochondrial functions by inducing
  mitochondria-related genes. OMM: outer mitochondrial membrane, IMM: inner mitochondrial
  membrane. In the figure, the main proteins orchestrating mitochondrial homeostasis
  are highlighted: DRP1, dynamin-related protein 1; Mfn 1–2, mitofusin 1 and 2; OPA-1:
  optic atrophy protein-1. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and adenine nucleotide
  translocator isoform 1 (ANT1) are regulators of mitochondrial metabolism. The paracrine
  mechanisms, mediated by factors released by the stem cells and implicating microRNAs
  (miRNA), play a role in cytoprotection of the myocardium. Exosomes, especially those
  secreted by different cardiac stem cells, confer cardioprotective effects. Stem
  cells and muscular smooth cells (MSC) secrete growth factors such as vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Tissue damage and cellular
  stress induce the expression and secretion of GDF15 from various cells in the myocardium.
  Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor α-like (GFRAL) is an endogenous
  receptor for GDF15; it is identified selectively in some areas of the brain. GDF15
  interacts on endothelial cells with a receptor-pair consisting of activin receptor-like
  kinase (ALK). GDF15 regulates the signaling pathways that are essential for regulating
  proliferation and angiogenesis through activation of ALK receptors and phosphorylation
  of Smad. GDF15 activates PI3K/AKT. The AKT pathway is directly linked to C-AMP response
  element-binding protein (CREB1) activation. Subsequently, activated CREB1 acts as
  transcription factor in the nucleus by directly binding the promoter region of GDF15.
  After myocardial injury and hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are molecular
  mediators of the response to hypoxia. HIF-1α is a transcription factor and GDF15
  activates the HIF-1α signal (+: stimulation; −: inhibition; ↓: decrease).'
