caption: CB1 cannabinoid receptor signaling and regulation of neural stem/progenitor
  cell proliferation. CB1 receptors are coupled to Gi proteins, thereby mediating
  the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA). CB1 receptor
  coupling to Gisignalling is also associated with activation of the extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway via different mechanisms. Direct activation
  of the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways by CB1 receptors may converge, thus synergizing
  with their activation by other receptors such as growth factor receptors with tyrosine
  kinase activity (RTK). CB1 receptor-induced activation of RTKs can occur by promoting
  the processing of membrane-bound growth factor inactive precursors to yield active
  growth factors, or by activating intracellular Src family protein kinases. In some
  circumstances, CB1 activity can antagonize RTK-mediated ERK signaling. Activation
  of the CB1 receptor ultimately controls different transcriptional regulators, including
  CREB, STAT-3, PAX-6 and β-catenin. The CB1 receptor may also regulate mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in NPs as it occurs in differentiated neurons.
