caption: Canonical and non-canonical pathway effects of STAT3 on energy metabolism.Canonical
  STAT3 signaling is activated by its tyrosine phosphorylation, which enables STAT3
  to regulate transcription of its target genes. In addition to regulating genes controlling
  proliferation, survival and self-renewal, STAT3 both directly and indirectly regulates
  the expression of genes important for energy metabolism. Consequently, canonical
  STAT3 transcriptional activation favors glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation
  as the cellular mechanism of ATP production. Non-canonical STAT3 function occurs
  via STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser727. Serine phosphorylated STAT3 can regulate the
  transcription of target genes. In addition, pS-STAT3 can be transported into the
  inner mitochondrial membrane where it enhances the activity of ETC complexes, stimulating
  OXPHOS and increased ATP production.ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CDK1, cyclin-dependent
