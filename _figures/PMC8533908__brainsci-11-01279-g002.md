caption: Major visual processing pathways of the primate brain considered in Gross
  et al.’s [] model. Information from the retino-geniculostriatal pathway enters the
  visual cortex through area V1 and then proceeds through a hierarchy of visual areas
  that can be subdivided into two major functional pathways. The so-called “what”-pathway
  leads through V4 and the inferotemporal cortex (IT) and is mainly concerned with
  object-feature identification, regardless of position or size. V4 is the third area
  in the ventral stream obtaining strong feedforward signals from V2. Additionally,
  it receives projections directly from V1. The “where” pathway leads into the posterior
  parietal areas (PP) and is concerned with the locations and spatial relationships
  among objects, regardless of their identity. The “when” pathway involves the integration
  of signals from “What” and “Where” allowing for preplanning of movement and therefore
  response. (PFAC, prefrontal association cortex; IT, inferotemporal cortex; PP, posterior
  parietal areas; MT, middle temporal visual area; LGN, lateral geniculate nucleus;
  SC, superior colliculus) (after Gross et al. [] with permission).
