caption: Therapy of hydrocephalus. At present, there are many methods that have been
  clinically applied or may be used as a target for the treatment of hydrocephalus.
  Choroid plexus cauterization is one of the important representatives of surgical
  methods. Cell transplantation of CPE is a research hotspot in the future. Upregulation
  of transporters is an effective way, both in transport capacity and protein quantity.
  In addition, using special drug blocking or gene knockout to inhibit inflammatory
  response pathway and some important transporters, such as AQP1 and Na+-K+-ATPase,
  is also a hot research direction
