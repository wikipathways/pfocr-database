caption: Efficient respiration is central to bacterial pathophysiology. A, under normal
  physiological conditions, the intestinal colon consists of mature epithelial cells
  derived from undifferentiated stem cells in the crypts of the villi. In the lumen
  of the colon, a dense microbiota utilizes available substrates to produce metabolites
  like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). In particular, butyrate produced by gut-commensal
  Firmicutes is utilized by mature epithelial cells to perform butyrate fermentation.
  This fermentation is oxygen-dependent. Since the stem cells do not perform butyrate
  fermentation, the microenvironment of the crypts is less hypoxic than that of the
  epithelial surface (32, 33). B, Citrobacter rodentium triggers an active increase
  in luminal oxygen concentration through crypt hyperplasia. Upon infection, C. rodentium
  injects effector proteins into the crypt cells through a Type 3 Secretion System
  (T3SS), activating the Wnt and Notch signaling pathway in these stem cells. This
  leads to cell proliferation without differentiation, causing a build-up of transit
  amplifying cells at the surface of the villi, hence resulting in crypt hyperplasia.
  These cells do not perform butyrate fermentation and consequently, the local oxygen
  concentration increases. The pathogen uses this oxygen to perform aerobic respiration
  and proliferate further (34). C, during invasion by Salmonella enterica, the available
  oxygen and organic compounds in the lumen are initially used to drive pathogen expansion.
  As a consequence of infection, the innate immune response of the host is triggered,
  leading to the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in immune cells.
  The nitric oxide (NO) produced leads to inhibition of not only the pathogen, but
  also the commensal gut microbes. This reduces the colonization resistance towards
  S. enterica, allowing more pathogen proliferation (35). When an antibiotic is introduced,
  it can further deplete the commensal bacteria, including the butyrate-producing
  Firmicutes. Consequently, the lowered butyrate concentration in the gut disables
  epithelial cells from performing fermentation. This increases the local oxygen concentration.
  S. enterica can utilize this increased oxygen to perform aerobic respiration and
  colonize the gut successfully (33)
