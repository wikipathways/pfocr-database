caption: A schematic overview representing the favored mechanism of P53 activation
  in embryonic cells and somatic cells. DNA damage, both in embryonic (blue) and somatic
  (black) cells, will induce P53 activation. To protect genomic integrity, embryonic
  cells favor apoptosis over DNA repair. Conversely, somatic cells preferentially
  engage in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair; however, if DNA damage persists, these
  cells will enter apoptosis or become senescent. Furthermore, telomere dysfunction
  and oncogene activation are other means to activate P53 signaling (mostly in somatic
  cells). In addition to apoptosis, P53 activation and its downstream pathways can
  result in autophagy, senescence, and cell cycle arrest.
