caption: Expression of TRP channels in intracellular compartments. Early endosomes
  (EE) are derived from the plasma membrane via endocytotic vesicles (EV). The cargo
  from these early endosomes can either go back to the plasma membrane via the recycling
  endosomes (RE) or follow the late endocytotic pathway via late endosomes (LE) to
  the lysosomes (LY). Intermediate transport vesicles (TV) are derived from the ER
  and/or the trans-Golgi-network (TGN). The content in these transport vesicles can
  either be delivered to early endosomes, late endosomes, or be transported to the
  plasma membrane via secretory vesicles (SV) or secretory granules (SG). Synaptic
  vesicles (SyV) are derived from early endosomes and release neurotransmitters in
  the extracellular space. Only intracellular locations of TRP channels are indicated.
