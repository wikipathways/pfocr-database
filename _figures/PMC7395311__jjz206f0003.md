caption: Schematic representation of cytokine and receptor Janus kinase pathway. The
  four JAKs [JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2] are selectively bound to and therefore mediate
  signalling for various cytokine and hormone receptors. Scheme representing all JAK
  pathway cytokines and with whom JAKs are associated. TYK2 [shown in dark blue] where
  there is evidence of its catalytic activity playing an essential role. TYK2 [in
  light blue] when it plays a scaffolding function. *The cytokine IL-31 does not signal
  through gp130 because of sharing the subunit [OSMRβ] with OSM, which belongs to
  the IL-6 receptor family.
