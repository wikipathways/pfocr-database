caption: Illustration of molecular signaling involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2
  spike protein is detected via ACE2 with the help of TMPRSS2 protease and initiates
  phagocytosis into the cell. TLRs, RLRs, and cGAS detect viral RNA in the endosomal
  and cytosolic compartments. TLR7/8 activates type 1 Interferon genes (IFN α/β) via
  IRF3 and IRF7 dimerization. The RLRs cytosolic receptors detect dsRNA, which is
  converted from ssRNA by the action of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) after
  hijacking the host ribosomal machinery. Further, RLRs trigger NF-κB as well as IRF3-IRF7
  dimer formation after binding of the CARDs domain of RLR to MAVS in mitochondria.
  The cGAS-STING also detects the dsRNA followed by induction of IRF3-IRF7 dimer formation,
  which increases IFNα/β gene expression. This IFNα/β activates the cytokines via
  the JAK-STAT pathway in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Additionally, the same
  IRFs and NF-κB pathway get activated by the herpes viruses as well as bacteria like
  E. coli, P.aeruginosa, and Clostridium sp.
