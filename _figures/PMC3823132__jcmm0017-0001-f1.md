caption: Potential mechanism(s) of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) action. In
  the ‘genomic pathway’ of EDC action, EDCs interfere with oestrogen (E2) binding
  to oestrogen receptors (ERs). EDCs bind to ERs instead of E2, and can thus affect
  the transcription of target genes in the nucleus by binding to the oestrogen response
  element (ERE) of target genes. The ‘non-genomic pathway’ of EDC action may occur
  through ER such as G protein-coupled receptor (GPR30) located in the cytoplasmic
  membrane. Activation of GPR30 by EDCs leads to rapid downstream cellular signalling.
  This induces subsequent stimulation of protein kinase activation and phosphorylation,
  which in turn may affect the transcription of target genes. The resulting changes
  by interaction between ERs and GPR30 in gene expression and intracellular signalling
  can cause cellular response without regulation, which may produce adverse effects
  of EDCs on organs.
