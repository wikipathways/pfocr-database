caption: 'Regulatory T cells (Treg) are activated following recognition of specific
  antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells. However, Treg cells also exert a
  suppressive function irrespective of their antigen-specificity termed as bystander
  suppression. The mechanism of actions underlying the suppressive function of Tregs
  can be direct or indirect. Treg cells present with very high basal expression of
  high affinity CD25, enabling privileged consumption of the IL-2 growth factor and
  thereby depriving and weakening surrounding conventional effector T cells (Teff)
  cells. Further, Treg cells mediate specific suppression by depleting peptide-MHC
  class II-molecule complexes matching their TCR from the surface of antigen-presenting
  cells via trans-endocytosis and subsequent degradation. As opposed to boosting Teff
  cells by co-stimulatory signals, Treg cells carry molecules, which were classified
  as co-inhibitory receptors: e.g., CTLA-4 has high affinity to CD80/CD86 and thereby
  outcompetes co-stimulatory signals via CD28. Further, Treg cells can disrupt pro-inflammatory
  mechanisms by eliminating effector cells. Direct cell contact with Treg cells can
  also be fatal for the respective target cell by induction of the Fas-mediated pathway
  of apoptosis through ligation by Fas-ligand. In addition, Treg cells use perforin/granzyme
  dependent cytotoxicity to kill target cells accompanied by adhesion via CD18. Treg
  cells can also induce suppressive properties in adjacent cells by secreting soluble
  factors thereby inducing an infectious tolerance. For instance, human Treg cells
  secrete latent TGFβ thereby promoting a suppressive milieu, as well as shedding
  of soluble TNFα receptor II, which can neutralize TNFα and prevents its pro-inflammatory
  signaling. Notably, Tregs can also modulate their environment by secretion of IL-10.
