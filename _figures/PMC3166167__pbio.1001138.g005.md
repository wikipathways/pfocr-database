caption: (Top) The essential function of the apicoplast is the production of isoprenoid
  precursors, IPP and DMAPP, which are exported into the cytoplasm and used to synthesize
  small molecule isoprenoids and prenylated proteins. Parasites that are unable to
  synthesize isoprenoid precursors either due to inhibition of the biosynthetic pathway
  by fosmidomycin or loss of the apicoplast following doxycycline inhibition can be
  chemically rescued by addition of exogenous IPP (red). The exogenous IPP enters
  the host cell through unknown membrane transporters and fulfills the missing biosynthetic
  function. (Bottom) Reaction scheme for MEP pathway biosynthesis of IPP and DMAPP
  with the enzymatic step inhibited by fosmidomycin indicated.
