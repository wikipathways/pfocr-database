caption: Efficient hepcidin expression in hepatocytes requires an intact BMP signaling
  pathway, HJV, neogenin, TfR2, HFE, and BMP6. (A) Under high iron conditions, increased
  loading of Tf with iron stabilizes TfR2, disrupts the HFE-TfR1 interaction, and
  induces BMP6 secretion from the nonparenchymal cells of the liver, which facilitates
  the formation of a complex consisting of the BMP receptor/BMP6/HJV/neogenin/TfR2/HFE
  to induce hepcidin expression. (B) Low iron conditions increase MT2, which induces
  the cleavage of hepatic HJV. Decreased Tf saturation in the circulation destabilizes
  TfR2 protein and facilitates the HFE-TfR1 interaction. Low iron levels in the liver
  reduce BMP6 secretion from the nonparenchymal cells, consequently blunting BMP signaling
  and lowering hepcidin expression. (C) Inflammation induces the expression of IL-6
  and activin B in the liver, which activates the transcription of hepcidin via the
  STAT3/JAK2 pathway and the BMP signaling pathway, respectively.
