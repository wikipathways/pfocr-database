caption: Illustrative model of the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects
  of PROG and ALLO against ketamine-induced cognitive deficits. Under certain conditions,
  the PI3K/Akt pathway can be activated to exert its neuroprotective function by phosphorylating
  a battery of protein substrates, including Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor
  2 (Nrf2), caspase-3/9, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, the PI3K/Akt pathway is a putative downstream
  signaling pathway regulated by EGFR and GLP-1R to elicit multiple biological responses,
  especially cognitive function. Intriguingly, PGRMC1 co-precipitates and co-localizes
  with EGFR in cytoplasmic vesicles in cells and also serves as a novel component
  of the liganded GLP-1R complex. In the present study, the therapeutic effect of
  PROG or ALLO at least in part rely on the activation of PGRMC1/EGFR/GLP-1R/PI3K/Akt
  pathway in the brain. Moreover, the PRGMC1-specific inhibitor AG205 significantly
  antagonized the therapeutic effects of PROG in the MWM task and downregulated the
  PGRMC1/EGFR/GLP-1R pathway, which supports a role for PGRMC1 in the functional regulation
  of EGFR and GLP-1R, as well as their relation to neuroprotective effects.
