caption: The molecular mechanism plot for the role of circ 0061265-miR-885-3p-AUKRA
  ceRNA network in the occurrence and development of GC. miR-885-3p is significantly
  downregulated while circ_0061265 and AUKRA were upregulated in GC. circ_0061265
  can promote the occurrence and development of GC by competitively binding to miR-885-3p
  to regulate the expression of AUKRA. The circ_0061265-miR-885-3p-AUKRA ceRNA network
  may be a key pathway involved in the occurrence and development of GC
