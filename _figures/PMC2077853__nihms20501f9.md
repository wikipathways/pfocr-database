caption: This model shows how GDNF can promote cell cycle progression via activation
  of Src kinase(s) and a PI3K/Akt pathway to increase N-myc gene expression. All 4
  kinases depicted are inhibited by SU6656 and are involved in spermatogonial proliferation.
  p60-Src and c-Yes are necessary for the early response to GDNF, while the addition
  of Lyn and Fyn might be important for proliferation associated with differentiation.
  Because GDNF activates N-Myc expression in the spermatogonial stem cell line and
  a subpopulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia, it suggests that N-Myc activation
  is relevant for spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal only.
