caption: Pathways for synthesis of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) by lung alveolar
  epithelial cells. The de novo pathway proceeds by the phosphorylation of choline
  (choline kinase [CK]) and then generation of cytidine 5-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline),
  which combines with 1,2-palmitoyl diacylglycerol phosphate (DP-DAGP) to form DPPC.
  The remodeling pathway requires a PLA2 acting on phosphatidylcholine (PC) to generate
  a lysoPC, which then forms DPPC by reacylation in the sn-2 position with palmitate.
  Prdx6 has been shown to be the major PLA2 involved in the remodeling pathway for
  surfactant biosynthesis in lung alveolar epithelial cells.
