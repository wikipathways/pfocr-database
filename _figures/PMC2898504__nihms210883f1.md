caption: Pathways to irreversible inhibition of P450 enzymes. Pathways a and b indicate
  the two metabolic routes to inactivate P450 (red boxes) by MI complex formation
  (green boxes) or by protein alkylation (blue boxes). The off path metabolites (purple
  box) are not directly involved in the inactivation of the P450 enzymes. Circulating
  metabolites (pathway a and b) are able to rebind to the P450 enzymes and are further
  metabolized to inactivate the P450 enzymes. The deactivated metabolites (pathway
  b) are dead end products and often detected in vitro.
