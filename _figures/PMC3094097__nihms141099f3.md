caption: Examples of cellular receptors that sense infection and cell death. TLR detect
  infections by recognizing microbial molecules that are structurally different from
  mammalian ones (distinguishing self from nonself). In addition, there is emerging
  evidence that they can recognize certain autologous molecules that are normally
  hidden intracellularly (“hidden self”) but are released when cells die. Once stimulated
  TLR lead to the activation of the transcription factor NFkB and sometimes IRF3 which
  then turn on many of the key components of the inflammatory response. The danger
  signal MSU stimulates a pathway that contains the intracellular Nod-like receptor
  NALP3 and results in the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1.
