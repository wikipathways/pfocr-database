caption: Regulation of gene expression in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons by action
  potential firing patterns. Pathways important in axonal growth and growth-cone signaling
  are oppositely regulated by the 18/1 and 90/5 stimulus patterns. This suggests that
  genes in the pathways that are differentially activated by the temporal nature of
  action potential firing may share transcription factor binding sites that are preferentially
  responsive to action potential firing patterns. Rac signaling pathways are shown
  to depict extracellular, cytoplasmic, and nuclear sites of action. Elements of the
  pathway are up- (11, red) or down-regulated (25, green) depending on the regulation
  of genes in the pathway. Many downstream signaling pathways affect neurite outgrowth
  and dynamics and interact through Rac, for example, actin polymerization, translation
  and membrane ruffling. Reprinted and modified from .
