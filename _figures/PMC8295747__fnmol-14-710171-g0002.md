caption: RLRs signaling pathway activation. Upon binding of immunostimulatory RNAs,
  RLRs undergo conformational changes leading them to an active state. These events
  are tightly regulated by ubiquitylation and phosphorylation processes (not shown
  for simplicity) and by the action of LGP2, which stimulates MDA5 and inhibits RIG-I.
  The activation of RIG-I and MDA5 induces the exposition of their CARDs for the interaction
  with MAVS. MAVS is located on mitochondria, mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAM),
  and peroxisomes and transduces the signal to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TANK1) and IkB
  Kinase ε (IKKε). Subsequently, the interferon regulatory factors 1, 3, and 7 (IRF1,
  3, and 7) are activated together with the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB), leading to the expression of type I interferon (IFN) and other genes, such
  as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). In addition, activated MAVS promotes intrinsic/mitochondrial
  apoptosis through the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes Noxa and Puma, whose
  encoded proteins finally induce the cleavage of the caspases 3, 7, and 9 into the
  active forms. Overall, these molecular events stimulate anticancer immune response
  and lead to cancer cell apoptosis.
