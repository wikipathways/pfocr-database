caption: On top of GSK-3 are transcription factors which are inactivated by GSK-3
  phosphorylation that are indicated in grey diamonds. On bottom of GSK-3 are transcription
  factors which are activated by GSK-3 phosphorylation that are indicated in yellow
  diamonds. Indicated in red ovals are molecules in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway which
  are activated by GSK-3 phosphorylation which are indicated in red ovals and beta-catenin
  which is indicated in an orange oval. Also indicated in a maroon oval is the Bax
  pro-apoptotic molecule. The mitochondrial localization of Bax is promoted when it
  is phosphorylated by GSK-3 and then it promotes apoptosis. Also indicated are some
  cell cycle and signaling proteins which are inactivated by GSK-3 phosphorylation
  (PTEN, Cyclin D1 and p21Cip-1) and beta-catenin which are indicated in grey symbols.
  This figure is presented to provide the reader an idea of the various transcription
  factors, kinases, phosphatases, apoptotic molecules, cell cycle regulator molecules
  which are regulated by GSK-3 phosphorylation and may influence EMT.
