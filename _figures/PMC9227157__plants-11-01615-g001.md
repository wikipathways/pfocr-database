caption: Overview of host temperature stress signalling pathways and the impact of
  temperature stress on Dothideomycete-induced disease severity.  highlights the signalling
  pathways (left) and effects of cold (blue) and heat stress (orange) on the severity
  of several Dothideomycete-induced diseases (right). The cold response cascade presented
  is shared between A. thaliana and rice. The membrane protein chilling tolerance
  divergence 1 (COLD1) triggers the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) upon the perception
  of freezing and chilling stress. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) mediates
  this signalling via the expression of transcription factors such as inducer of C-repeat
  binding factor (CBF) expression 1 (ICE1), which in turn activates the expression
  of cold responsive (COR) genes via transcriptional activators such as CBF. The ICE1-CBF-COR
  pathway is a key response pathway to cold stress. The change of membrane fluidity
  upon heat stress is proposed to induce a signalling cascade mediated by Ca2+. The
  heat shock proteins HSP70/90 repress the activity of the heat stress transcription
  factor HsfA1, a master regulator of thermotolerance in the absence of heat stress.
  Upon heat stress, this regulator is activated and targets downstream transcription
  factors, which in turn modulate the synthesis of chaperones and enzymes involved
  in degradation of unfolded proteins and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
