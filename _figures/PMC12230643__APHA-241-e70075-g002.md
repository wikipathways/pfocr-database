caption: 'The multi‐omics network of hyperglycemia‐induced vascular calcification.
  (A) Multi‐omics network based on genes and metabolites differentially regulated,
  comparing 0 vs. 25 mM glucose treatment of calcifying human coronary artery smooth
  muscle cells. (B) Focused network on hypotaurine/taurine and cysteine metabolic
  pathways and their interactors. Blue nodes represent input molecules. Yellow nodes
  represent metabolites, and red nodes are based on protein–protein interactions from
  genes. Input: Differentially expressed genes (fold change 1.5, p < 0.05, day 3)
  and metabolites from the supernatant (fold change 1.2, p < 0.05, day 5) from the
  0 vs. 25 mM glucose comparison. (C) Overview of the effect of glucose on the hypotaurine/taurine
  metabolic pathway. Blue: Decreased metabolites by glucose. Orange: Increased metabolites
  by glucose. White: Not regulated. Green: Enzyme gene names. (D) Abundance of secreted/extracellular
  hypotaurine based on an untargeted metabolomics approach. n = 3, each n represents
  an independent pSMC donor. Mean ± SD. One‐way ANOVA with Tukey''s post hoc test'
