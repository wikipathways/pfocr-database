caption: The proposed model. The elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, fatty
  acids and glucose play a key role in triggering beta cell stress and demise. Phlda3
  is a novel adaptive beta cell stress response gene induced downstream of XBP1 that
  promotes beta cell survival via the repression of the NFκB pathway and the maintenance
  of adequate antioxidant and adaptive UPR gene expression. FFA; free fatty acids,
  NO; nitric oxide, ROS; reactive oxygen species, T1D; type 1 diabetes, T2D; type
  2 diabetes.
