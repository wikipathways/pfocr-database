caption: A schematic representation illustrating our working hypothesis regarding
  the regulation and activation of gravid uterine AR signaling pathways after combined
  exposure of hyperandrogenism and INS resistance. The signaling pathway depicted
  is based on the findings of the current study. There is evidence that cytosolic
  AR is translocated to and/or exists in the mitochondrion in several cell types and
  thus might exert effects downstream of the hyperandrogenism, thus leading to mitochondrial
  dysfunction. Further studies are required to determine whether PCOS-induced uterine
  cell defects are due to the mitochondrial AR actions during pregnancy
