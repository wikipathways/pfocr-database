caption: Activation of the MAPK pathway by genetic alterations, such as the BRAFV600E
  mutation, primarily drives the development of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) from
  follicular thyroid cells. By contrast, activation of the PI3K–AKT pathway by genetic
  alterations, such as mutations in RAS, PTEN and PIK3CA, primarily drives the development
  of follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) from follicular
  thyroid cells. Conversion from FTA to FTC is largely due to increasing activation
  of the PI3K–AKT pathway. As genetic alterations accumulate and intensify the signalling
  of each of the two pathways, PTC and FTC can progress to poorly differentiated thyroid
  cancer (PDTC). When both pathways are fully activated through accumulated genetic
  alterations, conversion from PDTC to anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is strongly
  facilitated. It is also possible that PDTC and ATC can both develop de novo directly
  from follicular thyroid cells, and that ATC can develop from PTC or FTC if appropriate
  genetic alterations occur. Many secondary molecular alterations also progressively
  accumulate and synergize with the two pathways in driving the progression of thyroid
  tumorigenesis, as discussed in the text (not shown in the figure). The increasing
  number of vertical arrows and colour intensity of the ovals symbolize the increasing
  genetic alterations and signalling of the two pathways as thyroid tumorigenesis
  progresses. The figure is modified from REF. © (2007) American Association for Cancer
  Research.
