caption: 'Localization of AKAPs in T cells. (A) Left: schematic diagram of an AKAP
  anchoring PKA through hydrophobic interaction between the amphipathic helical region
  of AKAP and the N-terminal dimerization region of the two R subunits of PKA. When
  cAMP binds to the R subunit, the C subunit of PKA is activated and released to phosphorylate
  nearby substrates. The AKAP signaling scaffold also typically has additional binding
  sites for other signaling proteins, such as kinases, phosphatases, phosphodiesterases,
  or potential substrates. Finally, the AKAP target the supramolecular signaling complex
  to the appropriate subcellular compartment via protein–protein or protein–lipid
  interactions. Right: ribbon representation of the NMR structure of the regulatory
  subunit (green) in complex with the AKAP amphipathic helix peptide (pink) [modified
  from ()]. (B) AKAPs target PKA to specific compartments in T cells, including the
  plasma membrane (PM), mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, nucleus, and centrosome.
  The same AKAP can be found in different compartments, as illustrated by the presence
  of D-AKAP-1 both in mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum and by finding AKAP450
  in the Golgi and at the centrosome. AKAPs bind to specific partners and, hence,
  define specific supramolecular complex at discrete subcellular locales. For example,
  besides targeting PKA AKAP79 was shown to interact with beta 2-adrenergic receptor
  (β2AR) and calcineurin (CaN) at the plasma membrane and AKAP450 with PP1 and PP2A
  to the Golgi and the centrosome area. The role of each AKAP in T cells has not yet
  been reported. AKAP450 appears to be needed for early events as CD3, LAT, and Vav1
  activation as well as late events as IL-2 production but the mechanism is still
  not determined. However, studies of the role of ezrin and AKAP79 have delineated
  their functions in downregulation of T-cell function by dampening signaling through
  the TCR pathway at the level of inhibition of Lck activity or by blocking IL-2 production
  through the inhibition of the CaN phosphatase activity, respectively.'
