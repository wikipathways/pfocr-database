caption: Natural anti-CCR5 antibodies (Abs) to ECL1 triggers a Class B CCR5 trafficking
  pathway in T cells. After stimulation with anti-CCR5 Abs, the CCR5 receptor associates
  with G protein and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) trigger receptor phosphorylation.
  β-arrestin1/2 can initiate desensitization (at 150 min) with consequent internalization
  of CCR5 by clathrin-coated pits. In particular, activated CCR5 together with β-arrestin2
  is accumulated into protein complexes and induces the activation and retention in
  the cytoplasm of MAP kinase ERK1. These events determine the formation of a CCR5
  signalosome with β-arrestin2 and ERK1 into the cytosol, which remains stable from
  150 min up to 48 h. The signalosome could be targeted for degradation with consequent
  de novo synthesis of the proteins complex (CCR5, β-arrestin2, and ERK1). As a consequence,
  CCR5 reappears on the cell surface with long-lasting kinetics (8 days).
