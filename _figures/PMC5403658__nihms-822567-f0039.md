caption: Arsenite induces oxidative damage while it activates cGMP-PKG signaling pathway
  by increasing cellular level of cGMP and PKG in HBE cells. This in turn increases
  the level of Nrf2 which subsequently increases cellular level of GSH and SOD activity,
  thereby reducing the elevated level of ROS induced by arsenite. This then significantly
  reduces oxidative DNA damage, chromosomal breakage and lipid peroxidation induced
  by arsenite.
