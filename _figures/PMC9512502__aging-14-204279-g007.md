caption: Proposed mechanistic scheme of RON promoting tumor invasion in bladder cancer.
  MSP stimulation induces RON dimerization by binding the sema domain, which stimulates
  the Erk1/2-RSK signal transduction pathway regulating RON-mediated activities such
  as cell growth and invasiveness. Activated ERK1 and ERK2 also stimulate RSK2 and
  promote RSK2 nuclear translocation, which induced CREB phosphorylation. Phospho-CREB
  binds cAMP-responsive element (CRE) site of CXCR4, thereby inducing its transcription
  and over-expression.
