caption: 'The effects of squalene in the NF-ƙB pathway. SQ decreases phosphorylated
  P65-NF-ƙB, which causes a reduction in pro-inflammatory response. (1) Upon stimulation
  of the LPS that binds to the CD14/TLR4/MD2 receptor complex, TLR4 interacts with
  MyD88, which aggregates the signal and is subsequently transmits to IRAK (becoming
  phosphorylated). (2) The phosphorylated IRAK then causes the activation of the transcription
  factors, NF-κB, via phosphorylation of IκBα by the IKK complex, which triggers its
  ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. (3) NFκB is then free to translocate
  to the nucleus for inducing NF-κB target gene expression. (4) SQ decreases phosphorylated
  P65-NF-ƙB, which eventually (5) causes a reduction in pro-inflammatory responses,
  athus decreases the myocardial-related injury. LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MD2: myeloid
  differentiation factor 2; CD14: cluster of differentiation 14; TLR-4: Toll-like
  receptor-4; MyD88: myeloid differentiation factor; IRAK: IL-1 receptor kinase; IκK:
  inhibitor of κB kinase; Iƙβ-α: inhibitor of κB alpha; COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2; TNF-
  α: tumor necrosis factor-2; IL-1β: interleukin 1β; IL-6: interleukin 6; Ub: ubiquitination;
  P: phosphorylated. This figure is modified from Shih et al. (2018) [].'
