caption: Hh in the ischemic skeletal muscle. The upregulation of the Hedgehog (Hh)
  pathway observed in the ischemic skeletal muscle occurs through unknown mechanisms,
  perhaps mediated by the Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α). Sonic hedgehog (Shh)
  protein acts on fibroblasts, which respond by producing angiogenic growth factors
  (including VEGF, HGF, PDGF-BB, IGF), which stimulate proliferation, migration, and
  survival of endothelial cells (ECs). Shh-responding fibroblasts also produce stromal
  cell-derived factor 1α (SDF1α), which is responsible for the recruitment of bone
  marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPCs) into the ischemic site. Angiogenic
  growth factors are also produced by peripheral nerves in the ischemic muscle, upon
  Dhh modulation. There is also evidence that Shh limits the inflammatory response
  to ischemia in the skeletal muscle. Finally, there is in vitro evidence that ECs
  may respond to Hh proteins in a direct manner. Such direct stimulation induces EC
  morphological changes and supports EC tubulogenesis. Dashed lines and italic text
  represent in vitro data.
