caption: Activation of the AMPK enzyme, depicted as a heterotrimer of α, β and γ subunits,
  can result in inhibition of of the mTOR pathway, of CFTR-mediated fluid secretion
  and of cAMP accumulation. AMPK activity can be stimulated indirectly by interventions
  that reduce ATP production [metformin, thiazolidinediones, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG),
  calorie restriction] or directly (salicylate). All of interventions slow disease
  progression in animal models of ADPKD. Created with Biorender.com.
