caption: Multifaceted mechanism of KTC1101 in anti-tumor therapy and immunomodulation.
  The diagram delineates the inhibition of PI3K signaling within tumor cells by KTC1101,
  leading to reduced cell proliferation through downstream effects on AKT and mTOR
  pathways. Additionally, the synergistic effects of KTC1101 when combined with anti-PD-1
  therapy are highlighted, showing the suppression of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and
  the activation of CD8+ T cells. This is facilitated by increased pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines, such as IFNγ, CCL5, and CXCL10, which promote a T-cell
  inflammatory environment conducive to tumor regression. The graphic also indicates
  the shift in macrophage phenotype from M2 to M1, signifying the immunomodulatory
  impact of KTC1101 on innate immune cells
