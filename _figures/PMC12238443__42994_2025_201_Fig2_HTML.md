caption: A current model of the BR signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the
  absence of BRs, BRI1 interacts with BKI1 and BIRs, and BAK1 associates with BIRs,
  inhibiting the formation of the BRI1-BAK1 complex. 14–3-3 proteins promote the export
  of phosphorylated BES1/BZR1 from the nucleus to cytoplasm. BSS1 helps to retain
  BES1/BZR1 in the cytosol. When BRs are exported from the cytoplasm to the extracellular
  matrix via ABCB1/19, they are perceived by the BRI1-BAK1 receptor–coreceptor complex,
  promoting the dissociation of BKI1 from BRI1. BRI1 phosphorylates and activates
  receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, such as BSKs and CDGs. The activated BSKs/CDGs
  phosphorylate and activate BSU1, which in turn dephosphorylates and inactivates
  BIN2. Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated BES1/BZR1 can be transported to the
  nucleus with the help of RACK1. In the nucleus, the phosphorylated BES1/BZR1 can
  be dephosphorylated and activated by PP2A. Finally, non-phosphorylated BES1/BZR1
  initiates the transcriptional regulation of downstream BR-responsive genes. TWD1,
  PP2A, PUB12/13, and UBP12/13 can fine-tune the function of the receptor-coreceptor
  complex. KIB1 can promote the degradation of BIN2, and UBP12/13 can inhibit the
  degradation of the BES1/BZR1 protein family
