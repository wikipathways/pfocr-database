caption: Summary of natural AHR agonist synthesis pathways in mammalian cells, associated
  microbiota, and dietary plants. HOST—endogenous L-tryptophan (L-Trp) metabolism
  via the L-kynurenine (L-Kyn), serotonin (5-HT), and tryptamine pathways; indoxyl
  synthesis in the liver from the diet- or microbial-derived indoles; gastric acid
  condensation of dietary indoles pro-ligands produces high-affinity indolic agonists;
  6-formylindolo [3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) is generated by L-Trp photo-oxidation, L-Trp
  chemical-oxidation, or by enzymatic deamination of tryptamine that yields the precursor
  indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld). SKIN MICROBIOTA—the AHR agonist, synthesized by skin-resident
  microbiota, such as Malassezia yeast species. GUT MICROBIOTA—indole-derived AHR
  agonists, provided by microbial metabolism of L-Trp, which can be further metabolized
  to indoxyl by the host. DIETARY—polyphenol- and indole (e.g., Brassicaceae plants)-rich
  foods provide exogenous ligands, either as direct AHR ligands or as pro-ligands
  that can be converted to AHR ligands by the host. L-Trp metabolic routes have been
  designed according to the KEGG Pathway Database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/map/hsa00380.html
  (accessed on 8 October 2021) and PathBank (https://pathbank.org/view/SMP0000063
  (accessed on 8 October 2021)). AHR ligands or enzymes regulated by AHR are indicated
  in black, and intermediate molecules and enzymes are in grey.
