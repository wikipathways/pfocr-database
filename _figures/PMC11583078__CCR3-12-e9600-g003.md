caption: 'This schematic figure (created with BioRender.com) illustrates the key steps
  involved in the disturbed metabolic pathway that may explain the low vitamin B12
  and folate levels in our patient: (1) Dietary intake: The primary source for vitamin
  B12 and folate is through dietary consumption of protein‐rich foods and vegetables.
  (2) Intestinal absorption: Vitamin B12 and folate are primarily absorbed from the
  small intestine into the bloodstream. (3) Bloodstream: Homocysteine, vitamin B12
  and folate levels in the bloodstream are influenced by the balance between uptake/production
  and removal. (4) Dysfunctional genes: Defects in two key enzymes encoded by the
  CBS and the AMN genes can lead to both impaired homocysteine metabolism and vitamin
  B12 malabsorption'
