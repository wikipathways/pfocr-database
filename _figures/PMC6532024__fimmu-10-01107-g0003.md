caption: 'Inflammatory loops in the EIME of psoriasis. (A) The inflammatory loop of
  IL-17 in psoriasis. TRAF6-dependent activation of danger signals (signal 1: such
  as TLR pathways) induces the production of psoriasis mediator from keratinocytes.
  Subsequent activation of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in DC–T cell interaction gives rise
  to the production of IL-17 (signal 2) that drives further activation of keratinocytes.
  CARD14 associates with ACT1 and TRAF6 and is involved in IL-17 signaling. Activated
  MALT1 degrades A20 and suppresses its regulatory roles for ubiquitin signaling.
  (B) The inflammatory loop of IL-36 and IκBζ in psoriasis. IL-36R is an IL-1R family
  receptor and its signaling pathway is expected to be TRAF6-dependent. The activation
  of an IL-36 pathway by the ligation of IL-36 to its receptor triggers the expression
  of IκBζ. It promotes the transcriptional expression of itself, as well as that of
  a series of psoriasis mediators inducing the production of IL-17 from immune cells.
  IL-36 from keratinocytes binds to IL-36R in keratinocytes and other cells, such
  as DCs and fibroblasts, and drives the loop of IL-36 pathway. Transcriptional regulation
  by IκBζ is in part mediated by histone methylation. Itaconate inhibits the protein
  induction of IκBζ and ameliorates psoriatic inflammation. AP-1, activator protein
  1; BCL10, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10; CARD, caspase recruitment domain-containing
  protein; CXCL, CXC chemokine ligand; CCL, CC chemokine ligand; DC, dendritic cell;
  MALT1, mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor κB; SAA, serum amyloid A; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRAF6, tumor necrosis
  factor receptor associated factor 6.'
