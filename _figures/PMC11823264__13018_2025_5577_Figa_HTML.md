caption: Diagram of endoreceptor signaling. Endoreceptor signals are sensed by endoreceptors
  located at the ends of peripheral sensory nerves that originate primarily from peripheral
  organs. The spinal and vagus nerves are the two main upload pathways that carry
  these signals to the brain. In the spinal pathway, somatosensory neurons in the
  DRG project signals to the brain via the SDH, primarily transmitting somatosensory
  signals such as temperature changes, tissue damage and pain sensations in the skin,
  muscles and bones. The vagus nerve, on the other hand, transmits mechanical and
  chemical signals from internal organs via the JG and NG
