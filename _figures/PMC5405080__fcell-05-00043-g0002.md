caption: The Kreb's Cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways are central to cell
  metabolism. Acetyl CoA from many different sources can enter the Kreb's Cycle (also
  known as the citric acid cycle, or tricarboxylic acid cycle). This pathway not only
  drives oxidative phosphorylation by regenerating succinate, but it provides many
  useful intermediates for biosynthesis. The enzyme complexes of the electron transport
  chain, which support oxidative phosphorylation, are shown embedded in the inner
  mitochondrial membrane.
