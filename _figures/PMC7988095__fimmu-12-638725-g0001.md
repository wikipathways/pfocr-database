caption: Overview of the intestinal stem cell compartment and molecular cascades related
  to AhR signaling. (A) Active and quiescent stem cells reside at the crypt base in
  both the small and large intestine. Local morphogenetic factors produced from small
  intestinal Paneth and subepithelial mesenchymal cells regulate ISC activity. As
  stimulated ISCs migrate upward into the transit amplifying compartment, they then
  become committed differentiated cells. A brush border resides at the apical surface
  of epithelial cells in the small intestine which maximizes the absorptive surface
  area. In contrast, both Paneth cells and a brush border are absent in the colon.
  While the absence of Paneth cells in the colon results in decreased antimicrobial
  proteins, the colon employs other mechanisms to maintain intestinal homeostasis.
  LGR5 leucine-rich-repeat containing G-protein coupled receptor 5, CBC crypt base
  columnar. (B) Numerous molecular pathways orchestrate epithelial cell fate in concordance
  with local morphogenetic factors within the ISC. Key proteins in each signaling
  pathway (blue) interact with transcription factors (brown) to regulate gene transcription.
  Upstream of this, additional kinases (orange) modulate these pathways. Both Wnt/β-catenin
  and Notch signaling play a pivotal role in regulating the differentiation of either
  secretory or absorptive epithelial cell types. Together with EGF/MAPK and JAK/STAT
  signaling as well as others, these pathways work in tandem to regulate ISC stemness.
