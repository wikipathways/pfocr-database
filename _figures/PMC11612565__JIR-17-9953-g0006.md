caption: Overview of the mechanisms related to ferroptosis of ECs in sepsis. NRF2
  and GPX4 act as the key proteins in ferroptosis. Exosomes derived from ADSCs, rich
  in miR-125-5p, can influence the expression of NRF2, alleviating ferroptosis. Dexmedetomidine
  and STEAP1 can also regulate ferroptosis via NRF2. NETs may promote ferroptosis
  by blocking the formation of the SDC-1/HS complex and interfering with the cMET
  signaling pathway. Moreover, circEXOC5 can recruit IGF2BP2 to induce the degradation
  of ATF3 mRNA, inducing EC ferroptosis. GDF11 can inhibit ferroptosis by activating
  the SIRT1/ NOX4 pathway. Created in BioRender. Jiang, L. (2024) http://BioRender.com/p37f510
