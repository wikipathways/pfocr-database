caption: Rho GTPases and AD pathology. a Amyloid precursor protein (APP) can undergo
  amyloidogenic (right) or non-amyloidogenic (left) processing. In the amyloidogenic
  pathway, β-secretase cleavage results in the formation of soluble APPβ (sAPPβ).
  Cleavage by γ-secretase forms β-amyloid (Aβ) and amyloid precursor protein intracellular
  domain (AICD). Accumulation of Aβ leads to amyloid plaque formation. Several studies
  have reported the activation loop between Aβ and Rho GTPases (green arrows). Activated
  Rac1 can increase APP production and promote the amyloidogenic pathway by modifying
  β-secretase selectivity for APP (green arrows). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway,
  α-secretase cleaves within the Aβ region, which results in the formation of sAPPα.
  Cleavage by γ-secretase forms the P3 peptide and AICD. Activation of Rac1 via the
  5-HT4/cAMP/Epac/Rap/Rac1 signaling cascade promotes the formation of sAPPα (purple
  arrows). b RhoA activates ROCK that can phosphorylate tau (Thr245 and Ser409) leading
  to neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) and microtubule destabilization. 5-HT serotonin,
