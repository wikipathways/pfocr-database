caption: 'A: Immune regulatory mechanisms fail within the islet as diabetes progresses.
  Tregs present in the islet initially control the immune response. However, declining
  concentrations of IL-2 and increasing concentration of IL-21 result in decreased
  Treg number and function and increases in effector CD4+ T cells. The high concentration
  of IL-21 also promotes CTL and B cell function in the islet. Increasing concentrations
  of IL-7 results in downregulation of PD-1 expression on Tregs and effector CD4+
  T cells, which promotes beta-cell destruction through failure of the PD-1/PDL-1
  pathway. B: Islet environment promotes CTL function. Beta-cell antigen presentation
  promotes local proliferation of CTLs within the islet, increasing insulitis development.
  CTLs also respond to cytokines present in the islet, and this may increase the expression
  of cytotoxic markers, including granzymeB and IFNγ, and CTL function. CTLs within
  the islet are also stimulated to form an effector memory CTL pool.'
