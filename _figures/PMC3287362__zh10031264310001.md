caption: 'Schematic representation of the anatomic and molecular mechanisms of sepsis-mediated
  sympathoexcitation and ghrelin''s anti-inflammatory effect via sympathoinhibition.
  A: sepsis-mediated sympathoexcitation is represented by blue arrow. Bacterial sepsis
  leads to the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which reaches the liver via the
  portal vein. In the liver, LPS stimulates toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) on Kupffer
  cells (KC) leading to NK-κB-mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines such as
  TNF-α and IL-6. Pyrogenic cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1β enter the brain through
  the circumventricular organs, where they stimulate vascular endothelial cells (EC)
  to release prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 stimulates neurons of the preoptic
  area (POA) of the hypothalamus, leading to an excitatory output to the paraventricular
  nucleus (PVN), which in turn stimulates the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM).
  Excitatory glutaminergic output from the RVLM stimulates sympathetic preganglionic
  neurons in the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, which in turn stimulates
  sympathetic postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic chain, leading to the release
  of norepinephrine (NE) at target organs, including the gut. NE binds to α2A-adrenergic
  receptor (α2A-AR) on Kupffer cells in the liver, leading to activation of p38 MAP
  kinase pathway. The p38 MAP kinase pathway, acting synergistically with the LPS-induced
  NF-κB pathway, leads to augmented proinflammatory cytokine secretion by Kupffer
  cells (see inset of Kupffer cell). Proinflammatory cytokines, together with sepsis-associated
  hypoglycemia (↓Glucose) and acidosis, contribute to norepinephrine release by activation
  of the RVLM. B: ghrelin-mediated sympathoinhibition is represented by red arrow.
  Ghrelin, produced mainly in the stomach, reaches the brain by crossing the blood-brain
  barrier. At the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), ghrelin stimulates growth hormone
  secretagogue receptor type 1a (GHSR-1a) on vagal afferents, leading to suppression
  of glutamate release (see inset of NTS neuron-vagal afferent synapse). The effect
  of ghrelin signaling at the NTS may be transmitted, by as yet unclear mechanisms,
  directly or indirectly [via nucleus ambiguus (NA)] to the interneurons of the caudal
  ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), leading to GABAergic inhibition of sympathetic outflow
  from the RVLM. Ghrelin may also inhibit sympathetic outflow by stimulating agouti-related
  protein (AgRP)-neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Ghrelin-mediated
  phosphorylation of AMPK leads to activation of calcium channels. The resulting calcium
  influx could trigger the release of GABA from synaptic vesicles (see inset of AgRP-NPY
  neuron-PVN neuron synapse). This results in GABAergic inhibition of the PVN, leading
  to dampening of the stimulating effect of the PVN on the RVLM. The overall effect
  of ghrelin-mediated sympathoinhibition is suppression of norepinephrine-induced
  cytokine release.'
