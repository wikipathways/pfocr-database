caption: Intracellular NAD metabolism. NAM is a product of deacetylation and ADP-ribosylation
  reactions, which are catalysed by NAD-consuming enzymes such as sirtuins, PARPs,
  ARTs and CD38. NAMPT, the rate-limiting step in the NAD salvage pathway, catalyses
  the formation of NMN from NAM and 5′-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. NMN is then
  converted into NAD by NMNAT 1-3. NAM can also be methylated by NNMT leading to the
  formation of MNA. NR enters the NAD biosynthesis pathway by phosphorylation to NMN,
  a step catalysed by NRKs. Other NAD biosynthesis pathways include the de novo synthesis
  starting from tryptophan and the Preiss–Handler route by which nicotinic acid enters
  the de novo pathway.
