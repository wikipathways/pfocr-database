caption: CD160 signaling in CLL. Engagement of CD160-GPI via its receptors (MHC-I
  or HVEM) or monoclonal antibodies leads to activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway to modulate gene expression. This activation also downregulates the expression
  of pro-apoptotic proteins and upregulates the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins.
  Consequently, CD160 dysregulates both intrinsic apoptotic pathways (mediated by
  internal stimuli) and extrinsic apoptotic pathways (triggered by death receptors
  such as FasR, TRAIL-R, and TNFR). CD160 also activates the expression of cytokines
  such as IL-6 that activate STAT3 and NF-κB via the JAK2/PI3K/Akt axis. Adapted from
  ().
