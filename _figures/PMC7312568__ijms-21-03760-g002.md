caption: Altered molecular mechanisms in FRDA affected neurons. Frataxin (FXN) deficiency
  in FRDA results in the degeneration of specific neuron types leading to the ataxia
  phenotype. Different hypotheses have been postulated regarding the pathophysiological
  mechanism at the basis of neurodegeneration. FXN is a mitochondrial protein involved
  in Fe-S clusters biogenesis and alterations in FXN activity results in mitochondria
  dysfunctions and iron accumulation. The presence of iron deposits in mitochondria
  has been observed in patient-derived samples; however, whether iron accumulation
  occurs in neurons is less clear. Iron might be toxic and cause cellular dysfunctions
  by mediating the catalysis of ROS via Fenton reaction. However, a ROS-independent
  mechanism of iron toxicity has also been proposed. In this model, neurodegeneration
  arises from increased sphingolipids synthesis and activation of PDK1/Mef2 pathway
  occurring upon iron accumulation. Independently of iron accumulation, FXN deficiency
  results in reduced activity of Fe-S cluster containing enzymes leading to alteration
  in metabolic flow (aconitase), energetic failure (ETC), and altered heme synthesis
  (FECH). Moreover, a role of FXN in the regulation of calcium homeostasis has been
  described and linked to failure of retrograde axonal transport along axons and autophagy
  deregulation. Aberrant autophagy levels have been also reported in other independent
  works. However, whether autophagy is a neurodegenerative mechanism or a defense
  mechanism still need to be clarified. Finally, FXN deficiency may control actin
  dynamics and the growth cone of neurons. All hypotheses have been well described.
  However, which of them is the primary event triggering the neurological phenotype
  in FRDA is still unknown.
