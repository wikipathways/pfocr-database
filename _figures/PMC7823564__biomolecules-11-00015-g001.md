caption: Schematic diagram of NF-κB canonical and non-canonical pathways. In the canonical
  pathway, on the left, the stimulation of receptors by cytokine and growth factors
  lead to the phosphorylation of IKK complex, which in turn phosphorylates IκBα, leading
  to its proteasomal degradation. The free p65/p50 dimers of NF-κB then translocate
  into the nucleus to bind to κB motif and promote NF-κB-dependent gene transcription.
  On the right, the non-canonical pathway is activated by binding of LTβ, CD40L, and
  B-cell activating factor (BAFF) to their respective receptors, causing NIK-mediated
  phosphorylation of IKKα. Phosphorylation of p100 by activated IKKα initiates proteasomal
  processing of p100 N-terminal to form p52. The p52/RelB dimeric complex then undergoes
  nuclear translocation and binds to its κB motif, resulting in NF-κB-dependent gene
  transcription.
