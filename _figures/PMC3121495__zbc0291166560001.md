caption: Pyrimidine biosynthesis. A, de novo biosynthetic pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis.
  B, organization of genes involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis in humans and Leishmania
  spp. The genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the first three enzymatic steps
  (carbamoylphosphate synthetase, aspartate carbamoyltransferase, and dihydroorotase)
  are shown in blue, the gene for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is shown in green,
  and the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the final two steps (OMPDC and
  OPRT) are shown in red.
