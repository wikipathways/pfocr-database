caption: TLR-7/-8 signaling in dendritic cells. LCMV ssRNA is detected by the endosomal
  TLRs; TLR7 and TLR8, expressed by conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid
  dendritic cells (pDCs). The association of MyD88 with the receptor results in the
  association of IRAK1 and IRAK4 through the death domains. Once phosphorylated the
  IRAK proteins dissociate from the receptor to associate with TRAF6. TRAF6 interacts
  directly and indirectly with a number of other proteins, including protein kinases
  such as TAK1. TAK1 can then triggers the activation of transcription factors such
  as AP-1 via the MAPK pathway or NF-κB through the canonical IKK complex. Upon their
  activation, the transcription factors translocate to the nucleus and induce production
  of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, pDCs utilize a unique pathway that allows
  for the rapid immediate-early production of type I interferons. Similar to above,
  MyD88 associates with the receptor and a complex including TRAF3, TRAF6, IRAK1,
  IRAK4 and IKKα is formed. IRAK1 and IKKα phosphorylate the transcription factor
  IRF7, resulting in its activation and subsequent production of type I interferon
  (IFN-I). Solid arrows indicate direct steps, dashed arrows indicate multiple steps/additional
  proteins involved.
