caption: Complement activation pathways and selected regulatory proteins. The three
  pathways of complement activation, classical, lectin, and alternative, are initiated
  by interactions of complement proteins with distinct structures. The common activators
  for each pathway are described in the respective boxes. Complexes of antigen and
  antibody can activate the classical pathway. Mannan-binding lectin recognizes carbohydrate
  structures and, upon association with serine proteases (MASP, mannose-associated
  serine proteases), can activate the lectin pathway. Complement C3 that is covalently
  bound to microorganism surfaces as C3b initiates the cascade of the alternative
  pathway. Each pathway can ultimately generate an active C3 convertase, resulting
  in cleavage of C3 component into C3a and C3b fragments. C3b can interact with C4b2b
  or C3bBb to produce C5 convertase that cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b fragments. C5b
  binds to the cell membrane and serves as a platform for assembly of the membrane
  attack complex (MAC) [,]. The formation of MAC can be inhibited by membrane-bound
  CD59 that binds to C8 and/or C9. Selected regulatory proteins are shown in light
  blue. CR1, complement receptor 1; CFHR 1–5, complement factor H-related proteins
