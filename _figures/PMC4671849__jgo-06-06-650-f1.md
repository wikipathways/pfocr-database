caption: Feedback reactivation of MAPK signaling. (Left) In BRAF mutant CRCs, at baseline,
  MAPK pathway activity and ERK activation is driven primarily by mutant BRAF. (Right)
  Upon addition of a BRAF inhibitor, signaling output from mutant BRAF is blocked
  and there is a transient suppression of ERK activation and MAPK signaling. However,
  in some BRAF mutant CRCs, EGFR (and possibly other RTKs) drives feedback activation
  of RAS and CRAF, leading to reactivation of ERK and restoration of MAPK signaling.
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BRAF, V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene
  homolog B; CRC, colorectal cancer; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; RTK,
  receptor tyrosine kinase; RAS, rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog; CRAF, V-raf-1
  murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1; MEK, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-related
  kinase kinase.
