caption: Molecular links between sphingolipid metabolism and the salicylic acid (SA)
  signaling pathway.  De novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids starts in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and ends in the Golgi apparatus (GA) with the biosynthesis of complex
  sphingolipids. The diagram highlights mutations or silencing events in Arabidopsis
  and Nicotiana that result in loss or reduced function of genes involved in sphingolipid
  metabolism (blue boxes) or sphingolipid modification or transport (pink ovals) and
  their effect on SA accumulation and/or signaling as a consequence of the accumulation
  of long-chain base (LCBs), and/or ceramide (see Table ). Also illustrated is the
  inhibition of the ceramide synthase by sphinganine analog mycotoxin (SAMs; red)
  that additionally contributes to LCB accumulation and SA pathway activation through
  pathogenesis-related (PR1) gene 1 expression. Several signaling molecules are candidates
  connecting sphingolipid metabolism and SA signaling (green boxes). MITOGEN-ACTIVATED
  PROTEIN KINASE 6 (MPK6) may act in a feedback loop between the two pathways. Solid
  arrows indicate biosynthetic steps, while dashed arrows indicate modification of
  LCBs and ceramide. Blue arrows denote proposed steps of convergence between the
  two pathways.
