caption: Cell-cycle regulation by the CWI pathway in response to perturbations in
  the cell surface. This scheme represents the mechanism by which the CWI pathway
  impinges on cell-cycle regulators to respond to stresses in the cell surface. The
  CWI pathway has a negative role in the Start transcriptional program, through inducing
  the expression of the transcriptional repressor Whi7 and promoting the nuclear export
  of the transcription factor Swi6. It also negatively regulates the initiation of
  DNA replication, by stabilizing the CKI Sic1 and inhibiting the DNA replication
  factor Cdc6. The CWI pathway plays a negative role in the G2 transcriptional program,
  inhibiting the Hcm1 and Ndd1 transcription factors, which results in the impaired
  expression of mitotic cyclins, among many other mitotic genes. Finally, it affects
  other aspects of mitotic entry and progression, acting by regulating Swe1, and probably
  Mih1, to control the inhibition of CDK Cdc28 through Tyr-19 phosphorylation, and
  by the activation of phosphatase PP2ACdc55, which positively and negatively affects
  Swe1 and Mih1 and inhibits mitotic progression. Although some molecular details
  and the specific relevance to cell-cycle regulation of some of these mechanisms
  are yet to be fully characterized, a scenario has emerged in which the CWI pathway
  is an important player mediating the arrest of the cell cycle in response to cell-wall/plasma
  membrane stresses.
