caption: Figure 1. A model of the neural circuit through which adenosine receptor
  activation in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) could contribute to the inhibition
  of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis activated by cutaneous cold stimulation. Cool
  cutaneous thermal sensory receptors transmit signals to dorsal root ganglia neurons
  which relay this thermal information to thermal sensory neurons in the dorsal horn,
  which activate neurons in the external lateral subnucleus of the lateral parabrachial
  nucleus. Thermosensory signals are then transmitted to the preoptic area to excite
  GABAergic interneurons in the median preoptic subnucleus which in turn inhibit a
  brown adipose tissue-regulating population of warm-sensitive (W-S) neurons in the
  medial preoptic area. Preoptic W-S neurons providing thermoregulatory control of
  brown adipose tissue thermogenesis inhibit BAT sympathoexcitatory neurons in the
  dorsomedial hypothalamus which, when disinhibited during skin cooling, excite brown
  adipose tissue sympathetic premotor neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla,
  including the rostral raphe pallidus that project to brown adipose tissue sympathetic
  preganglionic neurons (SPN) in the spinal intermediolateral nucleus. Neurons in
  the NTS mediate the effects of afferents in the vagus nerve. The processing of metabolic,
  viscerosensory inputs by NTS neurons supports a potential role for an altered adenosinergic
  system in NTS in the modulation of the metabolic function of brown adipose tissue
  that could predispose to obesity. For simplicity, this figure describes only the
  thermoregulatory outcome, but not the other aspects of the more complex, torpor-like
  state induced by the central activation of the adenosine receptor. Dotted lines
  with question marks indicate that the pathway mediating the effect on brown adipose
  tissue activity is unknown. It is not yet clear if the adenosine-driven inhibition
  of the brown adipose tissue sympathetic premotor neurons in rostral raphe pallidus
  is mediated by a direct projection or a multisynaptic pathway from the NTS neurons
  to rostral raphe pallidus. 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; SPN, sympathetic preganglionic
  neuron; VGLUT3, vesicular glutamate transporter 3.
