caption: In this model, RpoN plays a central role and may be considered a ‘hub’ to
  bridge nitrogen fixation and biofilm formation by activating the transcription of
  the pslA and nifA genes under nitrogen-deficient and carbon-sufficient conditions.
  RsmZ was upregulated rapidly at the early stage of biofilm formation and then downregulated
  remarkably during biofilm maturation, thereby acting as a potent trigger for the
  initiation of biofilm formation. During biofilm development, RpoS exerts a braking
  effect on biofilm formation by transcriptionally downregulating RsmZ expression
  at the mature stage; this effect is restrained by RsmA at the early stage, thereby
  resulting in a novel repression circuit. Additionally, RpoN likely acts as a repressor
  of the Gac/Rsm pathway, markedly increasing the complexity of the regulatory circuitry.
  Arrows and T-shaped bars indicate positive and negative regulation, respectively.
  Broken lines indicate direct or indirect regulations for which evidence exists but
  that need to be studied in further detail. The black tail arrow indicates biochemical
  conversion reactions. The involvement of c-di-GMP in the biosynthesis of various
  polysaccharides has not been demonstrated experimentally, as marked by the punctuated
  tail arrow. For details, refer to the text.
