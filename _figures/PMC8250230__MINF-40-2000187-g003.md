caption: '(A) Five hub genes obtained for genes connected with drugs that might be
  used in COVID‐19 treatment. Colour of the nodes represents the intensity of correlation
  with yellow being the lowest and red the highest (Cytohubba Cytoscape plug‐in+MCC
  method), (B) Tight network of genes connected with candidate drugs for COVID‐19
  treatment, together with 20 related genes (GeneMANIA Cytoscape plug‐in). Colour
  legend: co‐expression – purple; co‐localization – blue; physical interaction‐red;
  pathway – light blue; predicted – orange.'
