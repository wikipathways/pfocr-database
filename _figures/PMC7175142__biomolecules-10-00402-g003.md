caption: The influence of lipid mediators on the mitochondrial pathway. Large groups
  of lipid mediators (black) as well as other molecules associated with lipid metabolism
  and signaling (black) are involved in modulation of apoptosis. They can act as apoptosis
  activators (red font) or inhibitors (green font). Among activators, most important
  are products of COX-dependent phospholipid metabolism (mainly prostaglandins derivatives)
  and products of the non-enzymatic metabolism of phospholipids like 4-HNE or isoprostanes.
  On the other side, some lipids have a cytoprotective function, like anandamide or
  HETEs.
