caption: 'Regulatory mechanisms of Brandt’s vole brain tissue in response to hypoxia.
  Under hypoxic conditions, Brandt’s voles may cope with hypoxia through three key
  mechanisms: (A) inhibition of vascular smooth muscle contraction to increase blood
  flow, (B) enhancing glycolysis to provide energy, and (C) activation of HDAC1 and
  the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway to reduce cell death. The schematic was created using
  the Generic Diagramming Platform (GDP) (https://biogdp.com/, accessed on 1 December
  2024)'
