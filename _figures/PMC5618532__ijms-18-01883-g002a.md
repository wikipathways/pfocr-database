caption: Illustration showing presumed mechanisms mediating SAHA-induced autophagy
  and its regulation in the absence of p53. (A) Transcription-dependent upregulation
  of regulatory autophagic or pro-apoptotic gene and protein expression is blocked
  in the nucleus. p63 and p73 might be able to compensate for p53 in the regulation
  of autophagy and to a lesser extent in apoptosis; (B) Cytoplasmic p53 protein loss,
  however, primarily induces autophagy, while apoptosis is disabled. The absence of
  p53 protein counteracts its suppressive function and could induce autophagic cell
  death by preventing Beclin-1 degradation and/or reactivating the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1
  signaling pathway. Possibly, p63 and/or p73 could contribute to the regulation of
  autophagy in the cytoplasm. Dashed line with arrowhead, deacetylating activity of
  HDAC; Line with arrowhead (HDACi SAHA), activity of SAHA preventing deacetylation;
  Fork symbols, transcriptional or enzymatic inhibition by indicated proteins; Arrowlines,
  transcriptional or enzymatic upregulation or activation by indicated proteins, respectively;
  Double arrow, major pathway activity.
