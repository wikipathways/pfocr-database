caption: The canonical pathway of microRNA (miRNA) processing. In the nucleus, miRNA
  biogenesis is initiated with RNA polymerase II. Pri-miRNA with a hairpin transcript
  is further processed to pre-miRNA by the DGCR8/Drosha microprocessor complex. The
  pre-miRNA is then translocated to the cytoplasm through exportin-5. In the cytoplasm,
  multidomain human TAR element-binding protein (TRBP) recognizes pre-miRNA and is
  cleaved by Dicer, resulting in miRNA maturation. In the miRNA-duplex, only one strand
  is loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) complex (including the AGO1-4
  protein), which then binds to the complementary target gene. Finally, the target
  mRNA can be suppressed through translation repression or degradation.
