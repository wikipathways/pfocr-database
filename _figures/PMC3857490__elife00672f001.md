caption: 'Both branches of the MVA pathway begin with acetyl-CoA (and acetoacetyl-CoA)
  and proceed through a series of enzymatic reactions involving 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA
  Synthase (HMGS), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA Reductase (HMGR, the presumed early
  rate-limiting step), and mevalonate kinase (MVK) before branching. At the bifurcation,
  the canonical MVA pathway, highlighted by light blue arrows, guides MVAP (3) through
  an additional phosphorylation reaction followed by a phosphorylation-dependent decarboxylation
  carried out by phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) and diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase
  (MDD), respectively. The alternative MVA pathway, highlighted with light brown arrows,
  hypothetically decarboxylates MVAP (3) prior to the phosphorylation reaction carried
  out by IPK but the former step has not been discovered until now (). The enzymes
  MVK, PMK, MDD, and IPK all consume ATP during catalysis. All enzymes are shown in
  green type. Statins serve as inhibitors of HMGR as highlighted.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00672.003'
