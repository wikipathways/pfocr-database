caption: Proposed working model. GLN is protective in the intestine by preventing
  EGFR degradation after HS injury, as well as by activating the protective EGFR signaling
  pathway. GLN phosphorylates ERK1/2 and inactivates p38MAPK via EGFR tyrosine kinase
  signaling to prevent apoptosis. However, GLN is protective by activating the PI3-K
  pathway independently from EGFR signaling.
