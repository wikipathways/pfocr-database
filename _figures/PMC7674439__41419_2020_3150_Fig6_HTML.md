caption: HIF1α and HIF2α mutually regulate each other through a negative feedback
  loop mediated by miR-210-3p, and high levels of miR-210-3p lead to higher HIF1α
  expression. HIF1α and HIF2α are upstream regulators of the transcription of the
  EGF gene, which regulates GBM malignancy through the related signalling pathway
  activated by EGF. In summary, HIF1α/HIF2α-miR-210-3p are critical factors that contribute
  to GBM growth, dedifferentiation and chemoresistance by regulating pathways activated
  by EGF in hypoxic cells, thus increasing GBM malignancy.
