caption: Life cycle of the HBV shown by green arrows step by step. Mature HBV virions
  enter hepatocytes through the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide receptor
  (NTCP) on the cell membrane (Step 1). After release from the viral envelope, the
  nucleocapsid is then transported to the nucleus where the genome is repaired to
  form covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) (Steps 2, 3 and 4). Using cccDNA as
  the template, viral RNAs are transcribed and exported into the cytoplasm where they
  are translated to form the viral proteins (Steps 5, 6 and 7). Additionally, pregenomic
  RNA (pgRNA) is packaged by core protein, along with the polymerase protein, and
  the viral genome is replicated through reverse transcription (RT) of the pgRNA to
  form the - strand, followed by partial synthesis of the + strand (Steps 8 and 9).
  Mature nucleocapsids can then either be recycled back to the nucleus to maintain
  a pool of cccDNA, or enveloped and secreted through the endosomal sorting complexes
  required for transport (ESCRT) pathway (Steps 10, 11 and 12).
