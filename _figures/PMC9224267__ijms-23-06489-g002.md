caption: 'Role of tumor microenvironment in EGFR-mutated NSCLC in influencing resistance
  pathways to targeted TKI treatment and potential targets for immunotherapy. EGFR
  mutations are associated with immunosuppressive TME, lower tumor-mutation burden
  (TMB), and increased PD-L1 expression. EGFR mutations may promote cancer immune
  escape through modulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, which in turn determine T-cells
  inactivity and/or exhaustion. This also leads to EGFR-TKI resistance. In addition,
  EGFR mutations influence several TME components, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
  (TILs), Tregs, MDSCs, TAMs, and immunoregulatory/proinflammatory cytokines, i.e.,
  IL-6. The latter, through the activation of the STAT-3 intracellular pathway, contribute
  to tumor growth and resistance to targeted therapies. Abbreviations: AKT—serine-threonine
