caption: Ca2+ signals mediate local symbiotic signaling pathways in the root. Plants

  and LysM receptor kinase 3 (LYK3)/NFR1 subsequently activate the leucine-rich repeat
  receptor-like kinases which include the symbiotic receptor kinase LjSYMRK in Lotus
  and MtDMI2 in Medicago truncatula. The activated LjSYMRK/MtDMI2 may directly open
  unknown cytoplasmic membrane-localized Ca2+ channels or indirectly regulate Ca2+
  channels through ROS signaling pathway, to induce cytosolic Ca2+ influxes. Meanwhile,
  LjSYMRK/MtDMI2 interacts with 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase (HMGR)
  to initiate the biosynthesis of mevalonate. The mevalonate accumulation activates
  LjPOLLUX and LjCASTOR/MtDMI1. MtDM1/LjPOLLUX and LjCASTOR interact with the nuclear
  envelope (NE)-localized channels, CNGC15s (CNGC15a, b or c), to regulate Nod factor-induced
  Ca2+ inflex into the nucleus from the NE or endoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+-bound MtCaM2
  interacts with CNGC15s, causing its closure and thus acting as a negative feedback
  loop for ion channels. Meanwhile, the nuclear localized Ca2+ pump, MtMCA8, uses
  ATP to transport the Ca2+ ions from the nucleus back to NE or ER to maintain the
  Ca2+ oscillation. In addition, a potential component of the nuclear pore complex
  (NPC), nucleoporins, such as NUP133 and UNP85, are essential for the Nod-factor-induced
  nuclear Ca2+ oscillation. The symbiotic Ca2+ signal is decoded by CaM to activate
  down-stream phosphorylation events, through the Ca2+- and CaM-dependent protein
  kinase, LjCCaMK or MtDMI3. The activated LjCCaMK or MtDMI3 phosphorylates LjCYCLOPS
  or MtIPD3, which is a transcription factor. The phosphorylated LjCYCLOPS or MtIPD3
  associates with DELLA, NSP2 and NSP1 to form a complex, which binds to the promoter
  of symbiosis-associated genes to induce their expression, which ultimately leads
  to nodulation.

  description: Ca2+ signals mediate local symbiotic signaling pathways in the root.
    Plants recognize the Nod factor via Nod factor perception (NFP)/Nod Factor Receptor
    5 (NFR5) and LysM receptor kinase 3 (LYK3)/NFR1 subsequently activate the leucine-rich
    repeat receptor-like kinases which include the symbiotic receptor kinase LjSYMRK

    open unknown cytoplasmic membrane-localized Ca2+ channels or indirectly regulate
    Ca2+ channels through ROS signaling pathway, to induce cytosolic Ca2+ influxes.
    Meanwhile, LjSYMRK/MtDMI2 interacts with 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A
    Reductase (HMGR) to initiate the biosynthesis of mevalonate. The mevalonate accumulation
    activates LjPOLLUX and LjCASTOR/MtDMI1. MtDM1/LjPOLLUX and LjCASTOR interact with
    the nuclear envelope (NE)-localized channels, CNGC15s (CNGC15a, b or c), to regulate

    Ca2+-bound MtCaM2 interacts with CNGC15s, causing its closure and thus acting
