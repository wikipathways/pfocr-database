caption: The molecular mechanisms of high UA-inducing oxidative stress, insulin resistance,
  endoplasmic reticulum stress, and endothelial dysfunction. (A) High UA activating
  the ERK/p38 signal pathway and inhibiting the Nrf2 and PI3K/Akt signal pathway,
  leading to an increase in the production of ROS. Increased ROS triggers IRS1/Akt
  phosphorylation to induce insulin resistance in cardiomyocytes. (B) High UA induces
  endothelial cell apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction through endoplasmic reticulum
  stress and the HMGB1/RAGE pathway. eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ER,
  endoplasmic reticulum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HMGB1, high mobility
  group box chromosomal protein 1; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; NO, nitric oxide; Nrf2,
  NF-E2-related factor 2; p-AKT, phospho-Akt; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;
  p-IRS1, phospho-insulin receptor substrate 1; PKC, protein kinase C; RAGE, receptor
  for advanced glycation end products; ROS, reactive oxygen species; UA, uric acid.
