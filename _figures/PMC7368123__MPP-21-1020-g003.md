caption: (a) Preliminary scheme of the cercosporin biosynthetic pathway consisting
  of 12 clustered genes. The polyketide synthase CTB1 forms nor‐toralactone, which
  is processed to cercoquinone C by CTB3 methyltransferase (CTB3‐MT) and monooxygenase
  (CTB3‐MO). Further processing of this cercosporin intermediate might be mediated
  by CTB2, CTB6, CTB11, and CTB12 to yield the cercosporin intermediate displayed
  in the square brackets, which has not been directly observed but is rather logically
  inferred. CTB5 and CTB7 are hypothesized to prime the cercosporin molecule for methylenedioxy
  bridge formation by CTB9 and CTB10. (b) Beticolin structures and isoforms. Beticolins
  are structurally related but can differ by residues (R) and isoforms (ortho‐, epi‐ortho‐,
  or para‐beticolin). Beticolins that carry the same residues are able to transform
  into each other by switching isomery. For example, ortho‐beticolin B2 can transform
  into the epi‐ortho‐beticolin B6 or para‐beticolin B1 based on the position of the
  oxygen and chlorine atoms
