caption: NF-κB activation is central to the acute respiratory RNA virus-induced cytokine
  storm. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to its receptor, i.e. the angiotensin-converting enzyme
  2 (ACE2) and the help of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 trigger endocytosis
  into the host cell. Within the endosomes, RNA from single-stranded RNA virus is
  known to activate the Toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8. Double-stranded RNA intermediates
  generated during viral replication can be recognized by TLR3. TLR7/8 and/or TLR3
  activation can lead to activation of transcription of the interferon-regulator factor
  (IRF) family and antiviral responses (green dotted lines). However, as a second
  major effect the activation of the TLRs can trigger—via various intermediates—the
  activation of IKK (IκB kinases) (gray dotted lines) resulting in phosphorylation
  of the cytoplasmic inhibitor factor IκBα triggering its ubiquitination followed
  by degradation by the 26S proteasome, thereby NF-κB (a heterodimer complex consisting
  of protein subunits p50 and p65) is released from IκBα and can now enter the nucleus
  and initiate transcription of various genes coding for pro-inflammatory proteins
  such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and growth factors. Importantly,
  this final sequence of NF-κB activation is shared with a multiple range of cytokine
  receptor- and Toll-like receptor mediated signal cascades, including binding of
  TNFα or IL-1 to their receptors or binding of LPS (e.g. from secondary bacterial
  infections) to TLR4. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was reported to induce TLR4-mediated
  NF-κB activation as well as ER stress-induced NF-κB activation. Excessive NF-κB
  activation triggers the gene expression for a broad range of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and chemokines, adhesion molecules, and acute phase proteins, resulting in inflammatory
  cell activation and infiltration, vascular leakage syndrome, finally leading to
  pulmonary edema and pneumonia. In contrast, interferon-response factor (IRF)-related
