caption: 'Integration of photosynthetic light reactions and C metabolism. The light
  reactions include the reaction center/electron transport components PSI and PSII
  (green), cytochrome b6f (b6f) (orange), and ATP synthase (blue), with CBBC (cycle,
  Upper Right) and starch biosynthesis (pathway, Upper Left) using the products of
  these reactions. Metabolites: G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate;
  G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; G1P, glucose 1-phosphate. C metabolism-related enzymes
  are highlighted in gold filled rectangles (Rubisco, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase
  oxygenase; PGM, phosphoglucomutase; SS, starch synthase). Other enzymes/electron
  transfer components are PC, plastocyanin (gray-filled circle, involved in transferring
  electrons from cytochrome b6f to PSI); PTOX and FLV (blue-filled ovals; involved
  in reducing O2); NDA2, NADPH oxidoreductase (gray-filled rectangle; moves electrons
  into the PQ pool); FDX, ferredoxin; TRX, thioredoxin; FNR, flavin:NADPH reductase
  (gray-filled circles; moves electrons out of the electron transport chain).'
