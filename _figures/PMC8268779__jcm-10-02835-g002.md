caption: 'Relationship between lipids and IL1β activation. Lipids may induce the expression
  of pro-IL1β and its transformation into IL-1β. In this way, lipid-lowering therapy
  may decrease IL-1β expression. Canakinumab works on the same pathway blocking the
  effect of IL-1β, instead of modulating its expression. Reproduced from reference
  [], with permission. Abbreviations: ASC: adaptor protein; IL-1β: interleukin 1β;
  m-LDL: modified LDL; NF-kB: nuclear factor kB; NLRP3: Nod-like receptor protein
  3; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; TLR: toll-like receptors.'
