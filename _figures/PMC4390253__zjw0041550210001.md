caption: Construction of the Golgi/endosome network (GEN) and of the IR subnetwork
  (IRGEN). A, A set of 666 proteins from the G/E fraction () were grouped and linked
  according to their functional and molecular associations; circles correspond to
  proteins. A link is placed between proteins if a functional or physical association
  exists, thus forming the GEN. The color corresponds to the cellular component categorization,
  as calculated by the Gene Ontology plugin Bingo. B, Projection of IR within the
  GEN (IRGEN). The colors correspond to the functional class to which the associated
  protein belongs. Yellow represents the IR and the associated proteins (proteins
  in magnified fonts were identified in the present study). The width of a link is
  proportional to the distance from IR. Squares correspond to proteins for which the
  gene was associated with type 2 diabetes. In the IRGEN, 107 genes (45% of the IRGEN)
  are associated with type 2 diabetes (supplemental Table S4).
