caption: 'Lipid metabolism. (A) Physiological conditions. Triglycerides (TG) stored
  in adipocytes must undergo a three-step process by which other tissues can access
  their stored energy reserves. The first step, lipid mobilization, involves lipolysis
  of TG to fatty acids (FA) and glycerol, which diffuse into the plasma and are transported
  to the target tissues. TG is lipolyzed by the enzyme hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).
  This process is influenced by many hormones. Insulin inhibits the action of HSL.
  Lipolysis-promoting hormones include catecholamines, glucagon, adrenocorticotropic
  hormone (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), growth hormone (GH) and vasopressin.
  Moreover, most lipolytic processes require the presence of thyroid hormones and
  glucocorticosteroids for optimal effect []. The second step is to activate FA and
  transport them to the mitochondria. The enzyme acyl-CoA synthase catalyzes the conversion
  of FA to active fatty acid (acyl-CoA). Then, long-chain acyl-CoA molecules penetrate
  the inner mitochondrial membrane as carnitine derivatives (acylcarnitine). The third
  step is β-oxidation—acyl-CoA molecules are broken down into acetyl-CoA, which can
  be oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle []. (B) Sepsis. In the initial
  stage of sepsis, lipolysis in adipose tissue is upregulated. The role of hormone-sensitive
  lipase (HSL) activation under the influence of LPS and prolipolytic hormones is
  suggested. Insulin resistance also contributes to the activation of lipolysis. Patients
  with sepsis have increased levels of fatty acids (FA) and triglycerides (TG) in
  the blood. This may be due to insulin resistance in the liver and adipose tissue.
  In the course of sepsis, the β-oxidation process is disturbed, which may be associated
  with a decrease in the expression of genes belonging to the PPAR-α signaling pathway.
  Additionally, the transport of long-chain FA to the mitochondria may be impaired
  due to possible accumulation of malonyl-CoA generated from glucose in hepatocytes.
  The lower efficiency of β-oxidation can cause energy deficiency, lipotoxicity and
  mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to organ damage. Lipotoxicity is a pathological
  metabolic phenomenon resulting from the accumulation of lipid intermediates in tissue
  other than adipose tissue. Lipid accumulation may lead to some of their metabolites
  (e.g., diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramide) reaching levels potentially harmful to cells.
  It is believed that excess lipids can be diverted to non-oxidative pathways and
  be transformed into toxic lipid species (TLS), which can damage mitochondria, modify
  cell signaling and increase apoptosis (lipoapoptosis). Legend: gray color—inefficient
  cellular processes; green color—increasing the activity of the process or enzyme;
