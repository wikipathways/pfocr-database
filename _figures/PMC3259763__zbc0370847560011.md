caption: Schematic models of the roles of Gab1 in IGF-I-dependent myogenic  differentiation.
  IGF-I induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and  subsequent association of Gab1
  with SHP2. Gab1-SHP2 complex plays a critical  role in activation of ERK1/2 in C2C12
  myoblasts. Furthermore, Gab1-SHP2  complex negatively regulates myogenic differentiation
  via activation of  MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway. On the other hand, IGF-I stimulation also
  induced  tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-I and subsequent association with p85 PI3K  subunit.
  IRS-I-p85 complex formation has been reported to be indispensable for  PI3K-AKT
  signaling, which might result in promotion of myogenic  differentiation.
