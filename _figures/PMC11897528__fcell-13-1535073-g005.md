caption: 'The double-edged sword of metabolic reprogramming in GBM, showing the balance
  between resistance mechanisms and therapeutic vulnerability. (A) Glucose metabolism
  in therapy resistance: GBM cells increase glucose uptake through GLUT1 and funnel
  it towards glycolysis and lactate production, leading to resistance to radiotherapy
  and chemotherapy. (B) Glucose metabolism as therapeutic target: pharmacological
  agents such as 2-DG and inhibitor of GLUT1 transporter can alter glucose metabolism,
  reducing cancer cell proliferation. By promoting PKM2 tetramerization, DMAMCL shifts
  cellular metabolism towards OXPHOS. Drugs such as metformin and IACS-010759 disrupt
  OXPHOS, thereby limiting cell proliferation. (C) Lipid metabolism in therapy resistance:
  upregulation of FABP increases the shuttle of fatty acids to various cellular compartments,
  including mitochondria, where fatty acids are converted in MUFAs by SCD1, providing
  an accessible energy source that promotes cell surviving. Moreover, GBM cells rely
  on exogenous cholesterol for survival and suppress LXR ligand synthesis, which enables
  to access a nearly limitless supply of cholesterol to fuel their growth. (D) Lipid
  metabolism as therapeutic target: LXR agonist promotes LXR activity which through
  a negative feedback regulation, decreases cholesterol levels by promoting the expression
  of efflux cholesterol transporters ABCA1. (E) Nucleotide metabolism in therapy resistance:
  through the upregulation of enzymes like IMPDH1 and IMPDH2, GBM increases the de
  novo synthesis of GTP, essential for DNA damage repair. Moreover, TMZ administration
  induces epigenetic modifications that upregulate the expression of ARL13B, which
  binding to IMPH2, suppress the purine salvage pathway. The shift towards the de
  novo synthesis gives GBM cells a self-sufficient means of producing nucleotide,
  supporting both their growth and their abilities to evade therapies. (F) Nucleotide
  metabolism as therapeutic target: targeting IMPDH2 with Mycophenolate Mofetil disrupts
  GTP synthesis, sensitizing GBM to radiotherapy. Additionally, the combination of
  TMZ with guanosine destabilizes mitochondrial membrane potential, inducing apoptosis,
  while the activation of adenosine receptors further amplifies cytotoxicity. (G)
  Iron metabolism in therapy resistance: GBM cells exhibit decreased expression of
  IRP1, leading to the upregulation of genes involved in iron homeostasis such as
  FPN1 and LCN2. This upregulation promotes iron export from the cell, reducing the
  intracellular iron pool and consequently ferroptosis. (H) Iron metabolism as therapeutic
  target: inhibition of System Xc−, which supports GSH synthesis, or inhibition of
  GPX4 using RSL3 disrupts GBM antioxidant defenses. This disruption promotes lipid
  peroxidation and triggers ferroptosis. ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette sub-family A
