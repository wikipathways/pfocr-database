caption: Paclitaxel biosynthesis is proposed to involve 19 enzymes, including 11 well-characterized
  enzymes (blue), 3 partially characterized enzymes (purple), and 5 enzymes yet to
  be discovered. Enzymes used in this study are circled with boxes. Due to unavailability
  of early pathway intermediate, T2αΗ and T7bΗ were characterized with surrogate substrate
  taxusin (taxadien-5α,9α,10β,13α-acetoxy)55 while TBT was characterized with a 2-O-debenzoyl-13-O-acetyl
  baccatin III derivative.56.
