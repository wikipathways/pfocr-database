caption: The binding of VEGF to its receptor initiates activation of both the PI3K-Akt
  and RAF-MEK-ERK pathways (1). Each pathway has its own distinct downstream effects.
  However, they also converge on at least two important downstream targets, mTORC1
  (2) and BAD (3), which plays a key role in apoptosis. Furthermore, Ras binds directly
  to PI3K and each influences activation of the other pathway(4). mTORC1 inhibition
  leads to activation of both PI3K and ERK signalling by abrogating feedback inhibition
  (5). Potential points of therapeutic inhibition are highlighted. Components in the
  signalling pathway that are mutated in cancers are shown in pink.
