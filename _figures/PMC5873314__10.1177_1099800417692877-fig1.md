caption: Theoretical model of how genetic polymorphisms influence symptom burden during
  breast cancer treatment. Both breast cancer and breast cancer treatment have been
  shown to activate the immune response and subsequently increase the levels of circulating
  cytokines. In this way, expression of the neurotrophins’ nerve growth factor and
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are both modulated by proinflammatory cytokines.
  These two neurotrophins bind the TrkA and TrkB receptors encoded by the genes NTRK1
  and NTRK2, respectively, and exert their downstream effects related to neuronal
  function and neural plasticity, specifically in relation to mood, sleep, and pain.
  We hypothesize that polymorphisms within the genes encoding TrkA and/or TrkB could
  alter the structure and/or function of the ligand-receptor relationship and thereby
  contribute to differential susceptibility to the behavioral effects of breast cancer
  and breast cancer treatment through their role in this pathway. Individual differences
  in activity of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme responsible for the
  degradation of catecholamine neurotransmitters and encoded by COMT, have been implicated
  in a number of psychological outcomes, including mood alterations, psychoses, and
  pain susceptibility. Both BDNF and COMT play a role in modulating dopamine signaling,
  a process thought to play a role in the etiology of several symptoms following breast
  cancer diagnosis and treatment.
