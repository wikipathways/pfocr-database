caption: Extracellular and/or intracellular signals can trigger protein kinase cascades,
  which can modify key downstream regulatory or effector molecules involved in DNA
  replication, mRNA splicing, mRNA turnover, mRNA translation, DNA repair, cell cycle
  and other fundamental biological processes. Trypanosomatids must heavily rely on
  phosphorylation of those key downstream effector molecules to regulate their biological
  processes. As an example, in T. cruzi, the ROS signal could be sensed on the membrane
  or travels the cytoplasmic membrane and then start a signal transduction pathway,
  involving CK1 and/or CK2, which can phosphorylate Tcpolβ modifying its DNA synthesis
  activity. Parasite secreted CK1 and CK2 (sCK1; sCK2) can enhance the virulence of
  some trypanosomatid strains, as they stimulate the association of macrophage and
  parasite cells. This hypothesis is easily testable by the use of well characterized
  pharmacological inhibitors to test their effects on the protein kinases and then
  on trypanosomatid biological processes. Alternatively, genetic approaches can be
  used to assay gene function, such as knockdown by RNA interference or gene knockout
  by CRISP/Cas-9 approaches. TcAUK1 has been located inside the mitochondrion together
  with Tcpolβ and it could directly modify its polymerase activity.
