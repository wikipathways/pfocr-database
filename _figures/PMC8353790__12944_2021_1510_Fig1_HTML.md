caption: The role of adiponectin in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Adiponectin is
  secreted by fat cells and can act on keratinocytes and naive T cells. A decreased
  adiponectin content leads to increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased
  anti-inflammatory cytokines []. Among these, TNF-α can further affect macrophages
  and myeloid dendritic cells, resulting in increased secretion of cytokines []. In
  addition, adiponectin increases the number of Vγ4γδT cells. In keratinocytes, adiponectin
  can activate the E2F1 gene through the AMPK pathway, and the decrease in adiponectin
  levels leads to reduced E2F1 gene activation, thereby promoting the proliferation
  of keratinocytes [–]. In addition, SIRT1 can interact with the FoxO family. Downregulation
  of SIRT1 leads to abnormal transcriptional regulation of genes related to cell proliferation,
  survival, apoptosis, and metabolism, resulting in abnormal cell apoptosis [–]. These
  changes interact with the infiltration of the inflammatory response, which leads
  to psoriasis
