caption: In Drosophila melanogaster, the transmembrane receptor Notch binds to the
  ligand Delta or Serrate, resulting in cleavage of Notch, and translocation of the
  Notch intracellular domain (NICD) to the nucleus. NICD functions as a transcription
  factor that drives the activation of target genes, through an interaction with gene-bound
  Su(H) that results in the eviction of co-repressors (CoR) and recruitment of co-activators
  (CoA). The E3 ligase dBre1 is required for full-expression of Notch target genes
  through an unknown mechanism. Rtf1 is also required for Notch signaling and H3K4
  methylation, which may be mediated through H2B ubiquitylation by dBre1. The histone
  chaperones ASF1 and NAP1 are required for Notch gene repression, and interact with
  the H3K4 demethylase LID/KDM5 and Su(H). Loss of the H2B ubiquitin protease Scrawny
  (Scny) induces stem cell differentiation, and this can be prevented by inhibiting
  Notch signaling, suggesting that Scny represses this pathway prior to differentiation.
