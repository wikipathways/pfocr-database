caption: Working model of β-elemene-induced senescence of glioma cells. β-elemene
  treatment inactivates YAP-CDK6 pathway in glioma cells, which may result into typical
  characteristics of senescent cells, including reduced cell proliferation, hypertrophy
  morphology, increased level of SA-β-Gal activity, increased expressions of p16,
  p21, and p53, upregulation of several senescence-associated genes such as IL-1,
  IL-6, MMP-2, MMP-9, NF-κB, and TNF-α, and downregulation of Lamin B1.

  signaling.
