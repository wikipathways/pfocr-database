caption: '(A) In normal physiology, the classic pathway of androgen biosynthesis occurs
  from conversion of 17-hydroxypregnenolone to DHEA and 17-hydroxyprogesterone to
  androstenedione. (B) In the absence of 21-hydroxylase activity, 17-hydroxyprogesterone
  accumulates and can be converted to testosterone and dihydrotestosterone through
  two pathways: the classic pathway and an alternative pathway. Increased expression
  of cytochrome b5 occurs during adolescence, promoting adrenal androgen production
  via the classic pathway. 17-OH activity in the alternative pathway is less affected
  by cytochrome b5 activity. 17-OHPreg=17-hydroxypregnenolone. 17-OHProg=17-hydroxyprogesterone.
  DHEA=dehydroepiandrosterone. DHT=dihydrotestosterone. P450scc+StAR=P450 side chain
  cleavage plus steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. 3βHSD=3-beta-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase. 17-OH=17-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase. b5=cytochrome b5. 21-OH=21-hydroxylase.
  11-OH=11-hydroxylase. AS=aldosterone synthase. 17βHSD=17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
