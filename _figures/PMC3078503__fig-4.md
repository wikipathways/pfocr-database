caption: PIKKs and TCR-associated pathways. The primary mechanism that has been identified
  for detection and downstream relaying of DNA damage involves the activation of PIKKs,
  primarily ATM, ATR, and DNA PKcs. DNA damage also results in significant alterations
  in DNA structure and inhibits RNA transcription, leading to the induction of TCR.
  Activation of ATM, ATR, and TCR may cause alterations of critical molecules, such
  as those involved in p53 nuclear export and cell cycle inhibition, potentially leading
  to apoptotic p53 signaling and/or aberrant entry in to the cell cycle. ATR and ATM
  may also activate apoptosis via p53-independent mechanisms. There is significant
  downstream crosstalk between all these signaling pathways, and whether the outcome
  is repair or cell death likely depends on both the extent and duration of the damage.
  ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad-3-related;
  DNA PKcs, DNA protein kinase catalytic subunit; PIKKs, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like
  kinases; TCR, transcription-coupled repair.
