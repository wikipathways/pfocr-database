caption: Model for gadolinium induced fibrosis. Direct effects on fibroblastic cells
  and indirect effects mediated via monocytes increase the numbers of collagen producing
  cells in lesional skin, increased procollagen production and modulation of the major
  enzyme/enzyme inhibitor pathway that regulate collagen turnover
