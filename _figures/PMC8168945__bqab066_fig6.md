caption: 'VSD associated with cholesterol deficiency. Cholesterol is essential for
  2 of the most important resources required for male sex differentiation: androgen
  synthesis and HH signaling. Within the fetal testis, Sertoli cells produce DHH,
  which diffuses to the interstitium where it interacts with PTCH receptors to stimulate
  fetal Leydig cell differentiation. Bound PTCH releases SMO to stabilize the activated
  GLI3 transcription factor (GLI3A), which, likely along with GLI2A, stimulates steroidogenic
  pathway genes to initiate and maintain androgen production. Fetal Leydig cells produce
  androstenedione, which is converted to testosterone in Sertoli cells. Testosterone
  is released into fetal circulation and converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in
  target tissues to promote urogenital development in cooperation with SHH/IHH signaling
  pathways. Cholesterol deficiency leads to defective androgen production and DHH
  signaling within the fetal testis, and defective SHH/IHH signaling in the urogenital
  organs, ultimately resulting in VSD. Abbreviations: DHH, Desert hedgehog; HH, hedgehog;
  IHH, Indian hedgehog; PTCH, Patched; SHH, Sonic hedgehog; VSD, variations of sex
  development.'
