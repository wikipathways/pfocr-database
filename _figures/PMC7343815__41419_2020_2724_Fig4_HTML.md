caption: Generally, phagosomes become decorated with LC3 and are then trafficked to
  the lysosome for degradation (LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP)). LAP uses a subset
  of the autophagy machinery distinct from canonical autophagy. As a result, dying
  cells are rapidly ingested and degraded and do not induce an autoimmune response.
  If components of the LAP pathway are lacking, dying cells are not degraded and,
  hence, the nuclear material escapes, which leads to autoimmune responses. Consequently,
  a lupus-like systemic inflammatory disease develops.
