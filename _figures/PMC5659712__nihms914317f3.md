caption: Possible mechanisms of inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases by EGCG. Epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) is used as an example to illustrate the multiple intra-cellular
  processes in signaling. 1) Upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding, 2) the receptor
  undergoes autophosphorylation and conformational changes, transforming the EGFR
  to the active form on the surface of cytoplasma membrane. 3) Once activated, EGFR
  is in a functional membrane with unique lipid composition or mobility (often referred
  to as lipid raft). 4) Such a functional lipid unit of EGFR, mediated by Clathrin,
  internalizes and the active EGFR signaling is transduced by the activation of downstream
  PI3K/AKT and SOS/RAS/ERK pathways. 5) Clathrin-coated internalized vesicles is de-coated,
  and EGF is disassociated from the active EGFR. 6) The de-coated vesicles are fused
  with other intra-cellular vesicles. 7) When fused with lysosomes, EGFR is degraded.
  8) When fused with vesicles from Golgi, EGFR can be recycled back to cytoplasma
  membrane. The signaling transduction mediated by different membrane units or sub-cellular
  components is also found in other receptor tyrosine kinases such as IFGR, HGFR and
  VEGFR. EGCG has been reported to inhibit this signaling pathway by interfering with
  the binding of EGF to EGFR, inhibiting EGFR kinase activity, altering lipid organization
  in the plasma membrane (lipid raft), and inducting EGFR internalization without
  activation as discussed in the text.
