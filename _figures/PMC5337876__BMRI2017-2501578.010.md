caption: 'Schematic diagram depicting proposed mechanism for the Wnt signaling pathway
  activation during differentiation of ADSCs into insulin-producing cells. ADSCs,
  in the induction of islet β-cells medium, initiate islet β-cells differentiation.
  Islet β-cells commitment is linked to the stimulation of the canonical Wnt pathway
  that sequentially involves the following: the Wnt ligand combines with the Frizzled
  (Fz) and LRP5/6 receptors. Fz then recruits Dvl, leading to phosphorylation at the
  LRP5/6 intracellular terminal. The phosphorylation of GSK3β leads to the inactivation
  of a cytoplasmic complex composed of CK1, Axin, APC, and GSK3β and detachment of
  β-catenin phosphorylation from the complex. These events result in the increase
  of β-catenin mRNA, but it was not obvious in β-catenin protein (possibly undergoing
  posttranscriptional modifications, actions of miRNA, etc.). The β-catenin stabilization
  activates the islet β-cells marker insulin in the transcriptional and translational
  levels. DKK-1 is a secreted Wnt antagonist that may be used as a drug to inhibit
  Wnt signal. CK1, casein kinase 1; DKK-1, Dickkopf 1; Dvl, dishevelled; GSK3β, glycogen
