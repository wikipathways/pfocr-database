caption: 'Mechanisms of mitochondrial stress in DILI. ATP production by the mitochondria
  is central to cell function and can be compromised by a range of drugs. Some drugs
  induce mitochondrial DNA damage limiting the production of proteins required for
  ATP synthesis by the electron transport chain. Acidic drugs and cationic amphiphilic
  compounds can decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential. Acidic drugs can disrupt
  proton movement by cycling between the intermembrane space and the mitochondrial
  matrix, where they alternately release and acquire protons (H +), effectively uncoupling
  this process. Cationic amphiphilic compounds can cross the inner mitochondrial membrane
  due to the membrane potential even if they become protonated and positively charged
  in the intermembrane space. Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, the drug and the
  associated proton become trapped, leading to an accumulation. Decreased membrane
  potential and severe uncoupling can result in lowered ATP production. The MPTPs
  are also important for upholding membrane integrity. These pores can open upon stimuli
  such as drug induced ROS formation and drug-induced JNK and Bax activation. This
  can either lead to lower ATP production stressing the cell, or cause release of
  cytochrome c, which activates Caspase 3 and 9 in a pathway leading to apoptotic
  cell death. Apart from the mitochondrial membrane, mitochondrial stress can be induced
  by lipid accumulation. Some drugs have been shown to inhibit β-oxidation limiting
  the cells ability to catabolize lipids, resulting in steatosis. DILI: Drug Induced
