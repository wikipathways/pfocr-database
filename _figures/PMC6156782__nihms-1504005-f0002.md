caption: 'Illustration of the mechanism linking activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptor (nAChR) to altered Ca2+-calmodulin activated signal transduction (MIE,
  KE1, KE2, and KE3 from ). Steps 1–12 describe the various components of the signaling
  pathway in each figure. (Left figure) Depiction of the ‘normal’ biology for neuronal
  signaling at the synapse via the nAChR leading to the production of new proteins
  involved in long term memory and (Right figure) an illustration of the same pathway
  perturbed by a chemical stressor via prolonged exposure to a nAChR agonist. Red
  x represents parts of the pathway where perturbation can lead to impacts on memory.
  Further, if phosphorylation of nAChR subunits is impaired, recovery from desensitization
  is also impeded. Abbreviations: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; Ca2+, calcium;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CaMKII, Ca2+-calmodulin kinase II; cAMP, 3’5’-adenosine
  monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; CaMK, Ca2+-calmodulin
  kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; and CRE, cAMP response
  element.'
