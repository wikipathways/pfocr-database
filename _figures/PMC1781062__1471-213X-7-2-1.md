caption: 'CCM2 as a Scaffold for p38 MAPK Activation. As described in [26] the Rho-GTPase,
  RAC, is recruited to actin membrane ruffles by CCM2 following hyperosmotic stress,
  facilitating the activation of p38 MAPK. CCM2 acts as a scaffold binding to RAC,
  MAP3K3, and MAP2K3 to organize these components into a functional signaling module.
  We have included in this model the two additional upstream MAP2Ks to p38 MAPK: MAP2K6,
  a specific activator of p38 MAPK related to MAP2K3; and MAP2K4, which primarily
  activates the JNK/SAPK pathway, but can also phosphorylate p38 MAPK in vitro. These
  two kinases may contribute to activating p38 MAPK in response to hyperosmotic stress
  but unlikely via interactions with CCM2 [26]. Downstream substrates of p38 MAPK
  include MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK5. Figure adapted from Uhlik et al. [26].'
papertitle: Mouse preimplantation embryo responses to culture medium osmolarity include
  increased expression of CCM2 and p38 MAPK activation.
