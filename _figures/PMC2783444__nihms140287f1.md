caption: 'Left panel: Coactivator (e.g., SRC-3/AIB1) regulates the coordinate expression
  of multiple downstream genes (ER-responsive; E2F1-responsive; Her-2 responsive;
  NF-κB responsive; and protein kinase [P13K/AKT] responsive). These TF-responsive
  genes are all required for proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. Targeting
  the individual pathways by using SERMS/aromatase inhibitors (for ER) or Herceptin
  (for Her-2/neu) only inhibits one or two pathways (for combinations). Cancer growth
  is then slowed, but the other pathways are upregulated to compensate, thereby producing
  eventual resistance to the therapy.Right panel: If the coactivator is targeted and
  its function inhibited, simultaneous suppression of all pathways occurs. This scenario
  blocks alternate pathway compensatory upregulation, decreasing the onset of eventual
  drug resistance.'
