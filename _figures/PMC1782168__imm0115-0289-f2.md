caption: 'Specific – receptor-mediated: Binding of the monoamine to dopamine receptors
  alters cAMP levels through modulation of adenylate cyclase (AC) – an enzyme to which
  these receptors couple (via stimulatory or inhibitory G-proteins). Activation of
  D1-like and D2-like receptors may inhibit T-lymphocyte activity (26) possibly via
  increases in cAMP levels (24). Co-activation of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors may
  initiate a unique signalling pathway, not activated by either D1 or D2 receptors
  alone (). Alternatively, receptor ligation may initiate a signalling pathway that
  leads to oxidative stress (). Specific – transporter-mediated: Dopamine can be actively
  internalised by cells that express the dopamine transporter (DAT). Intracellular
  dopamine may bind directly to cellular components such as GTPases to alter their
  activity (15) or enter the nucleus () and bind to nuclear elements () to alter transcriptional
  activity. Cellular dopamine can also chelate iron leading to cell cycle arrest ().
  Inside the cell, dopamine can be metabolised by enzymes with the generation of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) which may damage cellular components leading to cell-cycle
  arrest or death. Non-specific mechanisms: Extra-cellular dopamine can undergo auto-oxidation
  to generate quinones, semi-quinones and hydrogen peroxide (). Quinones/semi-quinones
  may bind to thiol groups on cell-surface proteins and inhibit their activity. Hydrogen
  peroxide generation from dopamine is toxic to immunocytes (31, 37) possibly through
  the generation of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which can damage lipids, proteins
  or DNA, culminating in cell cycle arrest or death.'
