caption: M6A-modified lncRNAs in different cancer types. In glioma, m6A-modified MALAT1
  activated the NF-κB pathway, leading to IDH-wildtype glioma cell proliferation and
  migration. In HNSCC, METTL3 and METTL14-mediated methylation increased LNCAROD stability,
  contributing to HNSCC cell proliferation and mobility. In TC, m6A-modified HAGLR
  may be recognized by IGF2BP2, inhibiting TC cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
  In BRCA, METTL14 methylated LNC942, leading to BRCA epithelial to mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) and chemoresistance; METTL3-mediated m6A modification increased LINC00958
  stability, finally leading to therapy resistance; METTL3 modified MALAT1, facilitating
  BRCA cell stemness. In OS, ALKBH5 demethylated PVT1 and decreased YTHDF2 recognition
  of the m6A mark on PVT1, contributing to OS growth. In CRC, m6A-modified GAS5 may
  be recognized and degraded by YTHDF3, contributing to CRC growth; METTL3-modified
  RP11 may be recognized by HNRNPA2B1, promoting CRC metastasis; ALKBH5-induced demethylation
  increased NEAT1 expression, correlating with poor prognosis of CRC. METTL14-modified
  XIST may be recognized and degraded by YTHDF2, inhibiting CRC invasion. In PC, ALKBH5-mediated
  demethylation upregulated KCNK15-AS1 expression, resulting in EMT of PC; m6A-modified
  DANCR may be recognized and stabilized by IGF2BP2, leading to PC stemness-like properties.
  In gynaecological cancers, m6A-modified FENDRR may be recognized and degraded by
  YTHDF2, resulting in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma cell proliferation; m6A
  modification increased RHPN1-AS1 stability, contributing to epithelial ovarian cancer
  growth; METTL3 methylates ZFAS1, thus enhancing cervical cancer metastasis; m6A-modified
  KCNMB2-AS1 may be recognized and stabilized by IGF2BP3, promoting cervical cancer
  growth. In haematological malignancies, m6A-modified MALAT1 promoted chimeric mRNA
  exportation, contributing to myeloid progenitor cell differentiation in malignant
  haematopoiesis; METTL3 elevated NEAT1 stability, finally releasing chronic myelocytic
  leukaemia cells from cell cycle arrest; decreased m6A methylation of TRERNA1 regulated
  by ALKBH5 was indicated to regulate diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell proliferation.
  In PCa, VIRMA is associated with CCAT1 and CCAT2, indicating poor prognosis of PCa.
  In KC, IGF2BP2 recognized MTC-mediated m6A modification on DUXAP9 and stabilized
  it, ultimately triggering EMT of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. In HCC, METTL3
  mediated LINC00958 upregulation, promoting HCC lipogenesis and development; METTL3
  induced decay of MEG3, resulting in HCC growth; m6A-modified lncAY may be recognized
  and degraded by YTHDF2, ultimately suppressing HCC cell proliferation and migration;
  m6A modification increased NIFK-AS1 expression, mediating HCC metastasis and therapeutic
  resistance. In EC, ALKBH5 removed m6A marks of LINC00278, finally inhibiting esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma cell apoptosis. In GC, ALKBH5 demethylated NEAT1, affecting
  GC invasion and metastasis; METTL3 methylated LINC00470 may be recognized by YTHDF2,
  ultimately promoting GC growth; KIAA1429 repressed the decay of LINC00958, finally
  regulating GC metabolism reprogramming; METTL14 mediated LINC01320 upregulation,
  contributing to an aggressive phenotype of GC. In LC, METTL3-modified MALAT1 may
  be recognized by YTHDF3, resulting in poor prognosis of NSCLC; m6A modification
  upregulated FEZF1-AS1 expression, leading to NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion;
  METTL3 elevated LCAT3 stability, contributing to LUAD oncogenesis; ALKBH5 upregulated
  RMRP expression, inhibiting LUAD cell apoptosis. In NPC, METTL3-mediated modification
  elevated FAM225A stability, ultimately promoting metastasis of NPC. m6A, N6-methyladenosine;
