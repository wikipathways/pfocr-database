caption: HIV-associated metabolic dysregulation influences immune cell responses,
  HIV biogenesis, and cell survival. Increased cell surface expression of Glut1 on
  CD4+ T cells and macrophages enhances glucose uptake. Upregulation of hexokinase
  (HX) converts glucose into G6P and forward feed to produce phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP),
  which is converted into pyruvate by pyruvate kinase muscle type 2 (PKM2). Nuclear
  translocation of PKM2 can induce activation of HIV LTR. Conversely, HX can bind
  to the outer mitochondrial membrane to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential
  and confer an antiapoptotic phenotype of macrophages. Increased glycolysis disengages
  GAPDH from its regulatory control (“moonlighting”) on inflammatory cytokines. Elevated
  aerobic glycolysis fuels the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) to synthesize amino
  acids and ribose-5-phosphate required for HIV protein and nucleotide synthesis.
  Upregulation of these metabolic pathways deprives the tricarboxylic cycle precursors
  for OxPhos, causing decreased mitochondrial ATP production and apoptosis in some
  effector CD4+ T cells. HIV infection may dysregulate mitochondrial biogenesis, resulting
  in oxidative stress.
