caption: PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is regulated by intrinsic feedback. With AKT inhibition,
  intrinsic feedback inhibition mechanisms built into AKT signaling pathway are released,
  resulting in increased RTK surface expression and activation, primarily of HER3.
  With PI3K inhibition, same AKT feedback inhibition mechanisms are released; however,
  because of cross-talk between PI3K and MAPK pathway, release of feedback inhibition
  mechanisms along MAPK pathway also contribute to increased RTK expression and activation.
  These feedback patterns are influenced by multiple cellular factors and are thought
  to differ meaningfully across patient tumors, such that degree of change in expression
  cannot be known a priori.
