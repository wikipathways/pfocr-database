caption: HSP receptors. HSP receptors include SREC-I and LOX-1 that mediate (1) endocytosis
  and, thus, presentation of antigens to APC. Hsp70 can also (2) trigger signaling
  through the TLR4 pathway in a range of cells. (It is not clear whether HSPs can
  interact directly with TLRs or whether the primary interactions are through other
  receptors.) Effects of Hsp70 on TLR4 signaling can be modulated by binding to either
  Siglec-14 that activates TLR4 signaling or other Siglec family members, such as
  Siglec-5, that activate the pathway. Hsp90 can also (3) activate wound healing responses,
  which may play key roles in inflammation, through binding to CD91. Hsp70 triggers
  (4) phagocytosis, a property that may be important in its immune functions, through
  currently unknown mechanisms. Gray ovals indicate nuclei.
