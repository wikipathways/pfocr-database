caption: Three general pathways for the generation of Cer. In mammalian cells, Cer
  is biosynthesized de novo or generated by catabolism of complex SLs. In the de novo
  synthesis pathway (purple block arrow), a four-enzyme sequence culminates in the
  formation of Cer from the amino acid serine and palmitoyl-CoA. This pathway is located
  in the ER. Sphingomyelin can be hydrolyzed to Cer in the SM hydrolysis pathway (orange
  block arrow), which is a one-enzyme step. (Degradation of other complex SLs is not
  shown.) Alternatively, Cer can be produced in the salvage pathway (green block arrows),
  through the acylation of Sph by the ceramide synthase family of enzymes. The red
  blocks represent cartoons of the possible structures of the molecules. It should
  be noted that the acyl-chain length of Cer can vary greatly
