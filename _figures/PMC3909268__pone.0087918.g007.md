caption: Previous data has established that p53 can regulate both PLK1 and PLK4 expression
  through protein-protein interactions. Here we have incorporated our observations
  into the known mechanisms of the p53-PLK regulatory axis (a.) Our data suggests
  that when oxidative stress upregulates p53 activity, this can lead to downstream
  effects that can potentially induce the epigenetic silencing of the PLKs. In wild
  type p53 cells, these mechanisms can include the recruitment and/or collaboration
  with epigenetic modifiers such as DNMT1, DNMT3a or histone deacetylases (HDACs).
  (b) However, oxidative stress in the absence of p53, these vital inhibitory interactions
  carried out through the p53 pathway are abolished. PLK1 and PLK4 expression thus
  carries on unhindered, potentially pushing the cell through the G2/M transition
  point with unrepaired DNA damage, resulting in genomic instability and aneuploidy,
  both of which are hallmarks of cancer.
