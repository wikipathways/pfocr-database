caption: Using DAVID, the genes that were downregulated by MA treatment were used
  to determine the importance for those genes in biological pathways. (A) The 90 genes
  that were found to be involved the cell cycle showed effects in the transition between
  phases of the cell cycle. Several of the cyclin genes (CycE, A, B) were downregulated
  as well as several subunits of the Mini-Chromosome Maintenance Complex (MCM). (B)
  DNA replication pathway was also affected by repeated MA treatment. The DNA polymerase
  complex as well as the DNA clamp had several subunits downregulated by MA treatment.
