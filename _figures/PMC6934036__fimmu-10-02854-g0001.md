caption: A schematic illustration representing different WNT signaling pathways. (A)
  Canonical WNT signaling. Left panel shows inactive pathway. In the absence of WNT
  ligands, β-catenin is phosphorylated by the destruction complex, constituted by
  the scaffolding proteins APC and AXIN and the kinases GSK3β and CK1α. Then, β-catenin
  is ubiquitinated and targeted for proteasomal degradation by the complex containing
  β-TrCP, FBXW7, NEDDL4, and WTX proteins. Thus, β-catenin degradation prevents its
  presence in the nucleus where a complex formed by TCF/LEF and TLE/Groucho binds
  HDACs to inhibit transcription of target genes. Right panel shows canonical WNT
  signaling active. The binding of WNT ligands to FZD receptors and LRP co-receptors
  activates WNT signaling. LRP receptors are phosphorylated by CK1α and GSK3β. Then,
  DVL proteins polymerize and are activated at the plasma membrane inhibiting the
  destruction complex. This results in stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin
  in the cytosol and its subsequent translocation into the nucleus where it displaces
  TLE/Groucho repressors forming an active complex with TCF/LEF proteins that bind
  co-activators such as CBP/p300, BRG1, BCL9, and PYGO. An alternative way of β-catenin
  signaling includes the disruption of epithelial E-cadherin interactions, which breaks
  the binding of β-catenin to the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin and leads to the
  accumulation of β-catenin first in the cytosol, and later in the nucleus. (B) Schematic
  illustration representing the main non-canonical WNT pathways. Left panel shows
  the WNT/PCP pathway. WNT ligands bind to the FZD receptor and the co-receptors ROR
  1/2 (or RYK). Then, DVL is recruited and activated followed by VANGL activation.
  Then DVL binds to the small GTPase RHO A with the collaboration of the cytoplasmic
  protein DAAM1. The small GTPases RAC1 and RHO activate ROCK and JNK. This leads
  to rearrangements of the cytoskeleton and/or transcriptional responses via for example,
  ATF2 and/or NFAT. Right panel shows the WNT/Ca2+ pathway. The signaling is initiated
  when WNT ligands bind to the FZD receptor and the co-receptor ROR 1/2 (or RYK).
  Then, DVL is recruited and activated and binds to the small GTPase which activates
  phospholipase C leading to intracellular calcium fluxes and downstream calcium dependent
  cytoskeletal and/or transcriptional responses. APC, adenomatous polyposis coli;
