caption: Mechanism of synergy between the LINC01419/miR-8070/RAD51AP1 axis and HBV
  in HBV-associated HCC. As a ceRNA, LINC01419 competitively binds to miR-8070, leading
  to the upregulation of RAD51AP1, which stimulates the increase of HBV cccDNA and
  promotes HBV replication. HBV replication in turn enhances the ceRNA axis, forming
  a positive feedback loop that activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and
  promotes the development of HCC
