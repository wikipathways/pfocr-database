caption: Immune-related signalling pathways in mosquitos. In the Toll pathway, the
  pathogen first binds to PPRs, which triggers the proteolytic cleavage of the cytokine
  Späetzle and then activates the Toll receptor to which it binds. Subsequent triggering
  of signals via the adaptor proteins MyD88, Tube, and Pelle leads to the phosphorylation
  and degradation of the Cactus protein, an inhibitor of Rel1. Finally, the degradation
  of the Cactus protein translocates Rel1 to the nucleus and activates the Toll pathway
  to regulate gene transcription. In the IMD pathway, pathogens bind to PGRP-LC and
  PGRP-LE ligands and trigger signalling by various cysteoaspartases and kinases.
  One branch triggers the JNK signalling pathway, while the other triggers signals
  via IMD, FADD, and Dredd, which mediate phosphorylation, as well as the cleavage
  of Rel2. Caspar proteins act as negative regulators of the IMD pathway. Subsequent
  translocation of Rel2 to the nucleus activates the IMD pathway to regulate gene
  transcription. The JAK-STAT pathway is triggered by the binding of Unpaired (Upd)
  to the receptor protein Dome, which activates the receptor-associated Hop Janus
  kinase. Activated Hop kinases phosphorylate each other and subsequently recruit
  phosphorylated STAT transcription factors and form dimers. Phosphorylated STAT dimers
  are translocated to the nucleus to activate JAK-STAT-regulated transcription. RNAi
  pathways include the siRNA pathway, miRNA pathway, and piRNA pathway. In the siRNA
  pathway, exogenous dsRNA is recognised by the RNA-binding structural domain of Dicer2
  and is sheared into small dsRNA of 21–28 nt. The Ago2 protein leads to the silencing
  of complementary transcripts in the cell by degrading or inhibiting the translation
  of sRNAs by binding to them, and R2D2 is involved in the delivery of the siRNA guide
  strand from Dicer2 to Ago2. In the miRNA pathway, pri-miRNAs are produced in the
  nucleus using the genome and processed by Drosha and Pasha proteins to be converted
  into pre-miRNAs. Pre-miRNA is translocated to the cytoplasm via export protein 5,
  where it is further processed by the Dicer1 and Loqs complexes to form miRNA-miRNA
  duplexes, followed by the formation of guide RNAs via Ago1 and Ago2, leading to
  degradation of the target mRNAs and transcriptional repression through the RISC
  complexes (composed of Ago2 or Ago1, VIG, TSN, Rp, C3PO, and other unknown proteins).
  In the piRNA pathway, after viRNA enters the host cell, it binds to unknown PIWI
  proteins (PIWI 1–7) and directly enters the ping-pong cycle to bind to the complementary
  antisense RNA of Piwi5 for shearing and methylation. The antisense RNA is then released
  to bind to an unknown PIWI protein. The processed positive-sense RNA then binds
  to Ago3 to form a long-stranded antisense piRNA precursor, and the antisense piRNA
  precursor is sheared and methylated to form an antisense piRNA release, which binds
  to Piwi5 to start another round of the ping-pong cycle. The other viRNA undergoes
  reverse transcription and replication and then enters the host cell nucleus to integrate
  into the genome, where it is subsequently transcribed and translocated into the
  cytoplasm to enter the ping-pong cycle
