caption: Invasion by RNA viruses is sensed by cytosolic and endosomal RNA sensors,
  RLRs and TLRs. Both RLRs and TLRs can detect viral RNA species such as viral genomic
  RNA and dsRNA produced during viral replication. While RIG-I and MDA5 are responsible
  for sensing cytoplasmic viral RNAs such as 5′-ppp RNA with a secondary structure
  (RIG-I) or dsRNA (short dsRNA; RIG-I and long dsRNA; MDA5), TLRs can detect endosomal
  ssRNA (TLR7/8) or dsRNA (TLR3). Activated RLRs undergo a conformational change that
  allows RLRs to expose CARDs and trigger the IFN signaling pathway through the CARD-CARD
  interaction between RLRs and MAVS. On the other hand, activated TLR3 and TLR7/8
  initiate the antiviral IFN program by recruiting the signal adapter molecules TRIF
  and MyD88, respectively. Then, subsequent activation of the shared downstream kinases
  and transcription factors elicits the production of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines.
