caption: a Multilayer hierarchical GRN related to 6-gingerol biosynthesis identified
  with the BWERF algorithm. Gray and blue lines represent regulatory roles; blue lines
  represent regulatory roles also supported by TFBS predictions. Red nodes in the
  top and middle layers represent key TFs that hierarchically regulate enzyme-coding
  genes (red nodes in the bottom layer) of the 6-gingerol biosynthesis pathway. b
