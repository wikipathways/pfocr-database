caption: 'Cell death signaling in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
  (SARS-CoV-2) infection: Mechanisms of cell death induced by proteins and cytokines
  produced by SARS-CoV-2. An increase in inflammatory cytokines is caused by the stimulation
  of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling by SARS-CoV-2. In response to binding
  of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha
  (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) have a multiplicity of effects: (1) apoptosis
  is induced by the intrinsic pathway; (2) necroptosis is triggered by the phosphorylation
  of mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL); (3) (A) pyroptosis occurs when inactive
  gasdermin is cleaved to form membrane pores by its active form. (B) The envelope
  (E) protein facilitates Ca2+ leakage from endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol,
  and SARS-CoV-2 mediates K+ efflux from the viral membrane to the cytosol. This causes
  mitochondrial damage as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thereby
  triggering pyroptosis induced by NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome.
  (C) SARS-CoV-2 enhances the pyroptosis pathway by promoting TNFR-associated factor
  3 (TRAF3) -mediated ubiquitination of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  a CARD (ASC). (D) During infection with SARS-CoV-2, crosstalk between main cell
  death pathways causes PANoptosis (pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis).'
