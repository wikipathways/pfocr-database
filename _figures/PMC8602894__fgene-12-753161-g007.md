caption: Hsa_circRNA_103124 upregulated in patients with CD inhibits autophagy by
  targeting AKT2 and sponging hsa-miR-650. A schematic diagram of the proposed mechanism
  by which that hsa_circRNA_103124 upregulation in patients with CD inhibits autophagy
  by targeting AKT2 and sponging hsa-miR-650. Pathway Builder Tool 2.0 was used to
  create this diagram. Upregulated hsa_circRNA_103124 in patients with CD targets
  to hsa-miR-650. AKT2, a downstream protein of hsa-miR-650, is upregulated, which
  leads to increased expression of CDK2 and reduced expression of TSC1 and LC3B. Therefore,
  the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells is increased, while autophagy is
  inhibited.
