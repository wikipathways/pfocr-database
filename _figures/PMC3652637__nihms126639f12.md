caption: The muscarinic, cholinergic Ca2+/protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathway
  is illustrated here as an example of the EGF and α1D-adrenergic signaling pathways.
  VIP stimulated increase in cAMP is illustrated as an example of mechanisms that
  increase cAMP. VIP released from parasympathetic nerves binds to its receptors (VIPACR1
  and 2) and activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) to increase cellular levels of cAMP.
  cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) that inhibitis activation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) by cholinergic agonists. Cholinergic agonists, through increasing
  the intracellular [Ca2+] and activate protein kinase C (PKC), activate the non-receptor
  tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and Src to activate MAPK. Gαs-stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding
  protein, PDE-cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase, Ras, Raf-mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinase, MEK-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase.
