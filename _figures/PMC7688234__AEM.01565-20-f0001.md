caption: 'Overview of identified pathways for trehalose synthesis and degradation
  in S. acidocaldarius. S. acidocaldarius degrades d-glucose via a modified branched
  Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, whereas the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway
  is used only for gluconeogenesis (). Glycogen has been reported as a central carbon
  storage compound in S. acidocaldarius (), and hexokinase activity (broad substrate
  specificity) has been reported for S. tokodaii (). The TreY/TreZ (, ), TreT (),
  and novel TPS/TPP pathways for trehalose synthesis as well as the trehalases for
  trehalose degradation () are depicted. Abbreviations: TreY, maltooligosyltrehalose
  synthase; TreZ, maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase; TPS, trehalose-6-phosphate
  synthase; TPP, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase; TreT, trehalose glycosyltransferring
  synthase; TreH, trehalase; NDPG, NDP glucose; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; G1P, glucose
  1-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; T6P, trehalose 6-phosphate.'
