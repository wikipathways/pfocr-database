caption: CPD45 (also known as FHY3) regulates the expression of many genes and is
  an important regulator of chloroplast division, the far red-light signaling pathway,
  circadian rhythm, and other biological processes. Arrows indicate genes that are
  directly regulated by FHY3/CPD45 and the pathways in which they are involved, dotted
  arrows indicate possible pathways that remain to be confirmed, and dotted lines
  represent unknown components or factors and steps not indicated.
