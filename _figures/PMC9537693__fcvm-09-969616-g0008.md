caption: Schematic diagram of effects of DCPIB on angiogenesis. DCPIB exerted anti-angiogenic
  effect on HUVECs by inhibiting the activation and expression of VEGFR2 and its downstream
  mediators including RhoA, CyclinD1, p-ERK and p-STAT3, which lead to decreased migration,
  proliferation and tube formation in endothelial cells.
