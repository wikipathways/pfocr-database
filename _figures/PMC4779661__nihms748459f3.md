caption: Relationship between cellular fatty acid (FA) metabolic pathways and observed
  associations of FAs and enzyme acitivity estimates (EAEs) with colorectal adenomas.
  (A) Lipoproteins and exosomes are the most abundant sources of plasma phospholipid
  (PPL) FAs. (B) Increased fatty acid synthase (FAS) increases intracellular saturated
  fatty acids (SFAs). These SFAs have lipotoxic effects causing stearoyl-COA desaturase-1
  (SCD-1) expression to increase. Higher concentrations of SFAs and expression SCD-1,
  increase monounsaturated FA (MUFA) production leading to increased PL MUFA incorporation
  and cellular enlargement. (C) Visual representation of PA metabolic pathway. PPL
  FAs appear in white boxes and EAEs appear in gray boxes. The arrow in each box indicates
  the direction of the association between the substrate and the likelihood of having
  an adenoma compared to having no colon polyps. A “–“ indicates no observed association.
  Elovl-6, elongation of very long chain fatty acids-6 EAE; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  SCDn-7, stearoyl-CoA desaturase n-7 EAE; SCDn-9, stearoyl-CoA desaturase n-9 EAE.
