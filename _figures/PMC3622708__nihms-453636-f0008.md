caption: 'The Wnt3a/β-catenin pathway directly activates Msgn1 and Dll1. Msgn1 binds
  directly to regulatory enhancers to activate gene expression in the PSM. Direct
  activation of Dll1 by Msgn1 establishes a feed-forward loop that ensures strong
  activation of Dll1 by Wnt signals. Msgn1 synergizes with activated Notch to activate
  Lfng. The Notch target, and clock pacemaker, Hes7, functions in an autoinhibitory
  feedback loop (blue lines) to periodically repress its own expression, and that
  of Lfng, thereby driving the oscillating segmentation clock. The ability of Msgn1
  to bridge the Wnt and Notch pathways suggests an explanation for the antiphase nature
  of Wnt and Notch clock gene expression. Active Wnt signaling initiates the expression
  of Msgn1 and cyclic Wnt target genes such as Axin2, while a phase-lag, to allow
  for the transcription and translation of Msgn1 and the activation of Msgn1-Notch
  target genes, leads to the delayed expression of Lfng. For simplicity, several target
  genes, gene products, and regulatory interactions are not shown. Abbr.: N, Notch
  intracellular domain.'
