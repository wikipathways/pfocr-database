caption: Possible competition mechanism between WIF1 and UCA1 to inhibit or activate
  WNT5A. With the upregulation of HOTAIR and its inability to silence WIF1, there
  may be a mutation in the WIF1 promoter that prevents the recognition of WIF1 by
  HOTAIR, which is observed in this dataset. That would subsequently cause an upregulation
  of WIF1, which would inhibit its target, WNT5A. WNT5A and its associated lncRNA
  UCA1 are upregulated. There may be a competition between WIF1 and WNT5A associated
  with lncRNA, UCA1. UCA1 is known to positively regulate WNT5A. With the upregulation
  of HOTAIR, WIF1, WNT5A, UCA1, and the Wnt pathway, UCA1 may be competing with WIF1
  to positively regulate WNT5A and subsequently the Wnt pathway. The x's indicates
  this gene contains an SNP found in IGV. WIF1—WIF1-S1 (rs7301320); SFRP4—SFRP4-M1
  (rs1802073), SFRP4-3 (rs1052981), SFRP4-S1 (rs1132553), SFRP4-S2 (rs1132552). HOTAIR,
  HOX transcript antisense RNA; IGV, Integrative Genomics Viewer; lncRNA, long noncoding
  RNA; UCA1, urothelial carcinoma associated 1; WIF1, Wnt inhibitory factor 1.
