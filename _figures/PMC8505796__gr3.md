caption: 'Transcriptional regulation of ALDH1A3.The human ALDH1A3 gene promoter contains
  a CCAAT box (71 to 67 bp) activated by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ).
  The binding of C/EBPβ to the promoter activates ALDH1A3 expression. ALDH1A3 impacts
  CSCs through the biosynthesis of retinoic acid (RA).K-RAS. A key regulator of ALDH1A3
  expression is the K-RAS oncogene. Signalling from K-RAS to C/EBPβ2 is likely through
  phosphorylation and subsequent activation of C/EBPβ2, allowing C/EBPβ2 to activate
  genes involved in proliferation and EMT transcriptionally. In a pancreatic cancer
  model using transgenic mice, mutant K-RAS upregulates ALDH1A3 expression via the
  MEK/ERK/mTOR pathways, a crucial regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation,
  and apoptosis .STAT3. Aberrant activation of STAT3 and subsequent interactions with
  apoptosis-related or angiogenic factors can promote tumour progression. Activation
  of the STAT3 pathway significantly promoted ALDH1A3 expression . Without the activity
  of STAT3-NFκB, C/EBPβ forms a complex with DDIT3/CHOP/GADD153. STAT3-NFκB activity
  represses the formation of the complex leading to C/EBPβ-dependent ALDH1A3 promoter
  activation . The inhibition of STAT3-NFκB activity increases DDIT3 expression and
  DDIT3-C/EBPβ complex formation, which reduces the occupancy of the ALDH1A3 promoter
  by C/EBPβ and suppresses ALDH1A3 expression , .Androgen Receptor (AR). ALDH1A3 expression
  is also directly regulated by AR signalling in androgen-dependent prostate cancer
  (PCa) cell line expressing ALDH1A3 only . The UTR of the ALDH1A3 promoter contains
  potential DNA binding domains for AR and its transcription factors Sp1 and NF1 located
  upstream of the transcription initiation site. The addition of androgen DHT to PCa
  cells significantly increased the expression and the activity of ALDH1A3. At the
  same time, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of AR eliminated the ability of
  DHT to induce ALDH1A3 mRNA. DHT upregulated ALDH1A3 directly through the induction
  of AR transcriptional activity and not via indirect involvement of ERK and Src kinase
  pathways . A consecutive study identified ALDH1A3 as a miR187 target in prostate
  cancer. ALDH1A3 expression was inversely correlated to miR-187 and significantly
  downregulated in PCa cell lines after transient transfection of miR-187 precursor
  .HGF/c-MET. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of c-MET in pancreatic cancer
  cells significantly decreased ALDH1A3 expression and activity. Activation of the
  HGF/c-MET pathway significantly promoted ALDH1A3 expression. However, the specific
  mechanism is unknown .Long ncRNA. DANCR impacts ALDH1A3 by derepression of β-catenin,
  leading to an increase of the stemness traits of hepatocellular carcinoma  and elevation
  of activated TGF-β and IL-6, NFκB and STAT3 production in TNBC . In the same cancer
  model, DANCR regulates the promoter binding of EZH2 and stimulates the expression
  of CSC markers, MDR and ALDH1 . The expression of NRAD1 is regulated by ALDH1A3
  and its product RA .Abbreviations: AR - Androgen Receptor, C/EBPβ - CCAAT/enhancer
