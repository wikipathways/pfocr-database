caption: Lipid domains within vertebrate cilia. Vertebrate HH signaling depends on
  the tightly coordinated trafficking of pathway components into and out of cilia.
  In the absence of HH signals, PTCH1 localizes to cilia and represses SMO. Consequently,
  GLI transcription factors are proteolytically processed to their repressor state
  to inhibit HH target genes. HH binding to PTCH1 leads to SMO accumulation in cilia,
  GPR161 exit, and GLI activator formation to induce HH target gene expression (;
  ). Specialized membrane domains within mouse and human cilia allow for HH signal
  transduction. Mouse and human cilia are enriched in the phosphoinositide PI(4)P,
  whereas PI(4,5)P2 is enriched outside of the cilium. Defects in the distribution
  of these two lipids causes mislocalization of HH pathway components such as GPR161
  to cause birth defects (; ). In contrast to PI(4)P, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 are
  enriched at the transition zone at the ciliary base (; ).
