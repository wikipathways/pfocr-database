caption: Ubiquitin codes in the TNF-induced signaling cascade. Tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF) binding to its receptor TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 recruits multiple molecules
  to form the TNFR complex I. In this complex, cIAP (E3) ubiquitinates itself and
  RIPK1 with different linkage types of ubiquitin chains. By interacting with Lys63-linked
  ubiquitin chains on RIPK1, the TAB2/TAK1 complex is recruited to the complex and
  participates in activating the IκB kinase (IKK). In the downstream NF-κB pathway,
  LUBAC components, HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN linearly ubiquitinate the NF-κB essential
  modulator (NEMO) and RIPK1. Recruitment of LUBAC and NEMO also depends on ubiquitin
  chain binding. Activation of IKK leads to phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent
  proteasomal degradation of an inhibitory protein IκB-α leading to nuclear translocation
  of transcription factors NF-κB. Deubiquitinases, OTULIN, CYLD, and A20 counteract
  ligase-dependent ubiquitination, thus inhibiting the signaling cascade. Not only
  the IKK-NF-κB pathway, TNF also activates pathways mediated by MAPKs such as JNK
  and p38 kinases.
