figtitle: Transcriptomic profiling of microglia reveals signatures of cell activation
  and immune response, during experimental cerebral malaria

caption: Pathway mapping were realised using REACTOME and showed by Cytoscape. The
  network among DE genes at the two time points was showed for “cell proliferation”
  at d5 (a) and “immune response by Type IFN” at d7 (b). The blue arrows represent
  molecular relationship, while the yellow dots represent DE transcripts involved
  in the networks (c) MHC class I DE genes has been displayed as fold change in the
  infected mice at the two time points compared to their infected control.
