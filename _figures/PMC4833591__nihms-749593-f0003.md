caption: (A) Prior to and during gastrulation, FGF, BMP and WNT signaling from the
  underlying hypoblast and mesoderm initiates differentiation in naïve ectoderm. (B)
  High BMP and WNT signaling along with FGF inhibition promotes non-neural ectoderm
  on the lateral side of the epiblast while high FGF signaling and reduced BMP and
  WNT signaling induce neural ectoderm formation in the medial side of epiblast in
  developing embryo. (C) The neural border is induced between non-neural and neural
  ectoderm. (D) Attenuation of BMP and WNT signaling in presence of FGF induces the
  pre-placodal region, while high BMP and WNT promote epidermis formation. On other
  hand, BMP and WNT along with FGF signaling promotes neural crest induction closer
  to the neural plate. Activation (green) and repression (magenta) of signaling pathways
  are color coded and the arrows indicate whether a signaling pathway is activated
  (↑) or inhibited (↓). BMP, Bone Morphogenetic Protein; FGF, Fibroblast Growth Factor;
  NC, Neural Crest; PPR, Pre-Placodal Region.
