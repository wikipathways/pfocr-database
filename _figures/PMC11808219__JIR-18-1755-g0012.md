caption: Model of continuous microinjury-triggered cytokines activating EPCs to treat
  DFU. The question mark (middle left) represents the research question of the current
  study – how continuous microinjuries (ie, tibial transport) contribute to remote
  tissue repair (ie, foot wound healing). The model proposed based on the results
  of the current study is that TTT mediates the production of cytokines (such as TGF-β1,
  PDGF-BB, and VEGF) which in turn activate EPCs via the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway,
  leading to EPC proliferation in the bone marrow and migration into the peripheral
  blood. EPCs further travel to the foot wound through the peripheral circulation,
  contributing to different effects including angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation,
  and ultimately wound healing. In addition, some of the secreted cytokines travel
  directly to the foot wound and enhance wound healing. The circles of different colors
  indicate different cytokines triggered by TTT
