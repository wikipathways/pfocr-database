caption: At the very initial phase of infection, CCL2 is initially produced from tissue
  resident CD11bhiF4/80hi macrophages and CD11chiEpCAM+ DCs through stimulation with
  IFN-I proteins produced from mucosal epithelium via the action of IFI-16 and STING
  in response to vaginal infection with HSV-1, thereby recruiting very early CD11b+Ly-6Chi
  monocytes within 12 h pi. Subsequently, the early infiltrated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes
  contribute to migration-based self-amplification through the supply of higher levels
  of CCL2 at around 24 h pi. Delayed production of other CC chemokines (CCL3, CCL4,
  CCL5) from infected and uninfected epithelial cells, together with CCL2 provided
  by monocytes, then contributes to the recruitment of late-comer NK cells at 48 h
  pi. The lack of an initial CCL2 supply in IFNAR KO mice results in reduced recruitment
  of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes; instead, CXC chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2) primarily produced
  from resident cells and CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes probably induce massive recruitment
  of CD11b+Ly-6G+ neutrophils.
