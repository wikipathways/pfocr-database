caption: A model depicting GSH-mediated ABA signaling in stomatal closure and drought
  tolerance. Induction of GSH biosynthesis reduces the level of cysteine, which plays
  a role in activating the AAO3 enzyme and therefore ABA synthesis in the guard cells,
  leading to inhibition of ABA-induced stomatal closure. Whereas drought-induced GSH
  level enhances the expression levels of ZEP and NCED, resulting in an increase in
  ABA synthesis, GST detoxifies xenobiotic substances by conjugating them with GSH,
  leading to induction in the expression of genes encoding ABI3 and ABI5, transcription
  factors that directly activate the expression of ABA responsive genes and drought
  tolerance. GSH is involved in the regulation of the downstream signaling of ABA-induced
  H2O2 in the guard cells and thereby preventing stomatal closure. GSH is also involved
  in the detoxification of H2O2 through the AsA-GSH pathway. The role of GPX is as
  described in , and it promotes ABA-induced stomatal closure and drought tolerance
  via inhibiting ABI2, which acts as a negative regulator of ABA signaling. ABA signaling
  components are described in . ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase; NCED, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid
  dioxygenase; AAO3 abscisic aldehyde oxidase3; MoCo, molybdenum cofactor; MoCo-S,
  sulfurylated MoCo; AsA, ascorbate.
