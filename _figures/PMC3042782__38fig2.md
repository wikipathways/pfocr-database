caption: Models for HJV cleavage by furin-like activity and matriptase-2. (A) HJV
  cleavage by furin-like activity. Newly synthesized nascent HJV in ER traffics to
  the plasma membrane (PM), avoiding processing in the TGN compartment. Upon reaching
  the plasma membrane, HJV interacts with neogenin, which triggers a retrograde trafficking
  into the TGN and the subsequent cleavage by furin-like activity. The cleaved HJV
  is rapidly released into circulation. This process is inhibited by either non-Tf-bound
  iron (Iron) or iron-saturated Tf (2Fe-Tf). The released sHJV is able to bind BMP6
  and other BMP ligands. This pathway is predicted to exist predominantly in skeletal
  muscle. (B) HJV cleavage by matriptase-2 (MT-2). HJV follows the same biosynthetic
  pathway as for furin cleavage. Upon reaching the plasma membrane, HJV binds MT-2,
  which cleaves HJV into fragments and releases it into circulation. In contrast to
  furin cleavage, MT-2–cleaved HJV fragments do not bind BMP6. The outcome of MT-2
  cleavage is to decrease membrane HJV. This pathway exists only in the liver. FNIII
  5, fibronectin III domain 5; FNIII 6, fibronectin domain 6.
