caption: '1, Identification of the question. A good model design defines the question
  to be answered by the model. Determining the desired resolution (microscopic to
  macroscopic) given the complexity of the biological system (molecular level to population
  level) of study will aid in outlining the scope of the model (range of question)
  and its boundary (field of study), which will determine the parameters of inputs
  and outputs of the model. 2, Model building. To build a model, a physiologically
  or pathologically relevant system should be tailored to make the resolution of observation
  match the scope of the study. The driving factors of the system, which is consistent
  with the parameters in the identified question, should be able to be manipulated
  under experimentation. The system should produce a relevant and useful readout that
  properly addresses the endpoints of study. 3, Model testing. Testing of the model
  involves adjusting the parameters of the driving factors as input and generation
  of outputs that allow evaluation for comparison of real system. The study design
  should emphasize the importance of a well defined and controlled operation, ensuring
  statistical power for meaningful conclusions. 4, Outcome evaluation. The endpoint
  of the study should be compatible with that of the real system, allowing comparison
  between the two systems at translatable bases. The translation of modeling results
  to clinical outcomes depends on the resolution of the model: the high-resolution
  modeling (e.g. signaling pathway) allows more straightforward application of the
  results to clinics, while low-resolution (e.g. pathophysiological phenotypes) modeling
  results require consideration of genetic background and scaling. 5, Model improvement.
  Continual assessment should appraise the system for improvement and modifications,
  and the endpoints should be critiqued and evaluated within the context of the real
  biological system. This can inform the next test run and guide design improvements.
  A well-designed model can bridge the gap to translational studies and inform their
  design, with similar feedback from clinical studies informing the next model improvement.
  This interplay can advance fundamental knowledge and clinical therapies.'
