caption: Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) contributes to metanephric mesenchyme self-renewal and
  its differentiation. WT1, Sall1, Pax2, Six2, and Hoxd11 are individually required
  for survival and self-renewal of metanephric mesenchyme (MM). Among them, WT1 is
  upstream of Sall1 and Pax2 transcription factors. BMP4 induces the apoptosis of
  MM; however, BMP7 promotes the MM differentiation. In balance of the BMP-pSMAD signaling
  in MM, WT1 directly regulates Bmper, a BMP-pSMAD inhibitor, and activates the FGF
  signaling pathway via regulating Fgf20/Fgf16 and Gas1 expression to antagonize BMP-pSMAD
  signaling for the survival and self-renewal of MM. High expression level of Wnt9b
  beneath the ureteric tip increases the Wnt singling activity nearing the MM; there,
  the β-catenin-LEF/TCF complex works together with Six2 and WT1 activating the critical
  differentiation factors, Fgf8 and Wnt4, to form pre-tubular aggregate (PTA). Signals
  produced by PTA promote the mesenchyme–epithelial transition (MET) to form renal
  vesicles. The proximal part of the renal vesicle expressing Wt1 will develop into
  the epithelial cells of the glomerulus and the distal part of the renal vesicle
  expressing Lhx1 will develop into the epithelial cells of the nephron tubule.
