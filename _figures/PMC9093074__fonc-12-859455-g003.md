caption: An example for the DTT approach via linear inhibition. While HDAC inhibitors
  exhibit anti-tumor activity via multiple mechanisms of action, exposure to HDAC
  inhibitors however activates the NF-κB pathway via post-translational modifications
  of RelA/p65, a major component of this critical survival pathway, including phosphorylation
  mediated by IKKβ (the mechanism for IKK activation by HDAC inhibitors remains unclear)
  and then acetylation mediated by HATs, but failure of its deacetylation due to inhibition
  of nuclear HDACs (e.g., HDAC1-3). Hyperacetylation of RelA/p65 prevents its nuclear
  export via binding of de novo synthesized IκBα, a downstream gene of NF-κB, resulting
  in sustained activation of NF-κB signal and therefore counteracting the lethal action
  of HDAC inhibitors. Thus, a DTT approach via linear inhibition of this non-genetic
  survival pathway at multiple sites can eliminate such an “off-target” effect of
  HDAC inhibitors and improve their efficacy as anti-tumor epigenetic therapy, though
  HDAC inhibitors often display limited single-agent activity. Disruption of these
  sites could involve IKK inhibitors that block phosphorylation of both IκBα and RelA/p65
  (preventing IκBα degradation via the UPS and subsequent RelA/p65 entering into the
  nucleus), proteasome inhibitors that block proteasomal degradation of IκBα, (thus
  sequestering RelA/p65 in the cytoplasm), transcriptional inhibitors (e.g., inhibitors
  of CDK7 and CDK9) that block the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes), inhibitory
  peptides directly targeting RelA/p65 or its partner p50, and probably HAT inhibitors
  that block acetylation of RelA/p65. P, phosphorylation; Ub, ubiquitination; Ac,
  acetylation; 26S, 26S proteasome.
