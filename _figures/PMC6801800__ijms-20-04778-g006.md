caption: Endogenously derived chemerin mediates a tumor-suppressive effect through
  inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in adrenocortical carcinoma. In adrenocortical
  carcinoma, chemerin expression becomes suppressed due to CpG hypermethylation resulting
  in low intracellular chemerin concentrations. β-catenin accumulates and migrates
  to the nucleus where TCF/LEF genes are turned on mediating (+) cell growth, proliferation,
  and invasion. Based on the known feedback inhibition of chemerin1 on Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling, it is also possible that low chemerin1 expression could contribute to
  the activation of Wnt/β-catenin in adrenocortical carcinoma cells. When tumor chemerin
  production is increased, by unknown (?) intracellular mechanisms (and possibly autocrine
  signaling through chemerin1), β-catenin is targeted for phosphorylation and proteasomal
  degradation reducing the expression of TCF/LEF genes and inhibiting (−) cell growth,
  proliferation, and invasion. APC, APC Regulator of Wnt Signaling Pathway; GSK3β,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3β; CK-1, casein kinase 1. (?) unknown or possible but
  unconfirmed mechanism.
