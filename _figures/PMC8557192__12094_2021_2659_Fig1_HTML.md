caption: The signaling pathway of immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 in cancer
  immunotherapy. When PD-L1 of tumor cells recognizes PD-1 on the surface of immune
  cells, ITSM phosphorylates and activates SHP-1/SHP-2. This process inactivates the
  TCR adaptor molecule ZAP70 and blocks the CD28-mediated PI3K pathway, thereby inhibiting
  T cell activation. ZAP70 is also phosphorylated by LCK, and further inhibits the
  expression of the signaling pathway. Another mechanism through which PD-1 inhibits
  TCR signaling is through blockade of CK2-mediated phosphorylation of phosphatase
  and PTEN. PIP3 can cause phosphorylation of AKT and send a signal to the nucleus.
  Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/MEK/ERK signaling pathways is also inhibited
  in the process. Therefore, PD-1 can inhibit downstream immune pathways of tumors
  through PI3K and Ras. A combination of CTLA-4 and B7 may produce inhibitory signals,
  including inhibition of TCR immune synapses and increasing T cell fluidity, thereby
  avoiding mutual recognition with APCs. Moreover, CTLA-4 mediated PP2A can inhibit
  AKT and suppress IL-2 production, while Tregs expressing CTLA-4 have extracellular
  inhibitory effects on common T cells. Therefore, CTLA-4 mainly helps tumors to evade
  immune surveillance by competitively binding to B7 ligands and inhibiting the function
  of Tregs
