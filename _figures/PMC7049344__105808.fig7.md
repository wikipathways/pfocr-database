caption: Proposed signaling pathway downstream of CD36 through which oxidized low-density
  lipoproteins (oxLDL) activate phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) to suppress cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. OxLDL binds to CD36 to activate a tyrosine kinase
  signaling pathway that leads to a sustained activation of PDE3A. Under these conditions
  cAMP is maintained at low concentrations through hydrolysis to 5′AMP (solid red
  line), and the activation of PKA is diminished (dashed red line). Through dis-inhibition,
  this pathway acts to reduce the threshold for platelet activation and promote thrombosis.
