caption: 'A De novo biosynthesis pathway of coenzyme A (CoA) is a pathway during which
  CoA is produced. Vitamin B5 is taken up by cells and converted into CoA by the action
  of five enzymatic reactions (Leonardi et al, ; Strauss, ). These are carried out
  by pantothenate kinase (PANK), phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS), phosphopantothenoylcysteine
  decarboxylase (PPCDC), phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT), and dephospho‐CoA
  kinase (DPCK), respectively. In Drosophila melanogaster, mice, and humans, PPAT
  and DPCK enzyme activities are carried out by a single bifunctional protein, CoA
  synthase or COASY. Abbreviations of the enzymes are provided. The starting product
  vitamin B5/pantothenate, the intermediate, 4′‐phosphopantetheine, and the final
  product CoA are depicted. PKAN and CoPAN are inherited recessive diseases caused
  by homozygous mutations in PANK2 and COASY, respectively.BFormation of holo‐mtACP
  (active form of mitochondrial acyl carrier protein) is a CoA consuming metabolic
  reaction (Beld et al, ). 4′‐phosphopantetheinylation of inactive apo‐mtACP is required
  to produce the active holo‐mtACP form. During this process, CoA serves as the source
  for the 4′‐phosphopantetheinylation, and hereby, a CoA molecule is degraded and
  adenosine 3′–5′‐biphosphate is released. Holo‐mtACP plays a key role in mitochondrial
  fatty acid synthesis, which can be visualized in (C).CFatty acid synthesis is a
  metabolic pathway in which CoA is re‐used (Kastaniotis et al, ). Mitochondrial fatty
  acid synthesis (mtFASII) is required for the synthesis of lipoic acid, a pathway
  that is dependent on the activity of holo‐mtACP. In this pathway, malonic acid is
  converted to malonyl‐CoA, which requires holo‐mtACP (or NDUFABI in humans) for the
  formation of malonyl‐holo‐ACP as well as for subsequent downstream steps. Mitochondrial
  Enoyl‐[acyl‐carrier‐protein] reductase (MECR, defective enzyme in MEPAN) is required
  for the formation of acyl‐holo‐mtACP as indicated. Via this pathway lipoic acid
  is formed from octanoyl‐holo‐mtACP by lipoic acid synthetase (LIAS). This product
  is then required for the formation of lipoylated pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), lipoylated
  α‐ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (αKGDH), lipoylated branched‐chain alpha‐keto acid
  dehydrogenase (BCKDH), and lipoylated glycine cleavage system (GCV). Lipoylation
  of the above‐mentioned proteins is necessary for catalysis of their respective reactions
  to occur.DFatty acid (FA) degradation or β‐oxidation is an example of a degradation
  pathway in which CoA is re‐used. The starting mitochondrial precursor acyl‐carnitine,
  the intermediates, and the end product of this pathway are indicated, as well as
  reactions in which CoA is required (but not consumed) and released.EIn the glycolysis
  and TCA cycle, CoA is re‐used. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) catalyzes the oxidative
  decarboxylation of pyruvate to produce acetyl that is coupled to CoA to produce
  acetyl‐CoA. Impaired function of this enzyme leads to PDH‐E2 deficiency. The product
  of the PDH reaction, acetyl‐CoA, is the fuel for the TCA cycle which is also a CoA
  re‐using pathway as indicated. OAA: oxaloacetate.'
