caption: Schematic representation of c-Src tyrosine kinase as a potential hub for
  signaling pathways involved in PAH. The interaction between BMPR-II and c-Src tyrosine
  kinase may inhibit c-Src tyrosine kinase activity in the presence of BMP ligand
  by reducing its phosphorylation at tyrosine-418 residue. The inhibition of c-Src
  activity by BMP signaling may inhibit downstream cell cycle regulators such as cyclins
  D and E and subsequently prevent smooth muscle cell proliferation. Moreover, BMP
  ligand stimulation may also inhibit cell proliferation through the Smad pathway.
  In contrast, activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase by 5-HT2B receptor causes the induction
  of cell cycle regulators (cyclins D and E) via ERK/MAPK pathway and subsequently
  triggers cell proliferation. In addition, activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase by
  serotonin inhibits voltage-dependent and Ca2+-activated K+ channel (MaxiK, BK),
  leading to vasoconstriction. Protein–protein interaction between c-Src tyrosine
  kinase and voltage-gated K+ channel (Kv1.5) suppresses outward potassium current
  and ultimately causes vasoconstriction. In contrast, activation of c-Src tyrosine
  kinase by angiotensin-II (Ang-II) receptor leads to increased eNOS gene expression
  and activities via MAPK pathway and subsequently causes vasorelaxation. The “+”
  and “−” signs indicated possible activation and inhibition, respectively, while
  “?” indicated potential cross-talk of the smad and c-Src signaling pathway.
