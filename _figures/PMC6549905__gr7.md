caption: Conceptual representation of model complexity by type. Empirical models convert
  substrate to biomass through the use of yield coefficients. Lumped pathway models
  use simplified metabolic reactions to simulate growth. Metabolic flux models track
  individual metabolites as they are consumed and converted in the cell. Numbers in
  parentheses are manuscripts that included this process. Specific citations can be
  found in Listing S1 of the SI.
