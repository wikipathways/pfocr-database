caption: A proposed model of UBD/p53 promoting CRC cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.
  UBD is upregulated in CRC, and may interact with p53 and facilitate p53 degradation
  through the proteasome pathway, which further promotes cell proliferation and cell
  cycle progression, ultimately, promotes CRC tumorigenesis.
