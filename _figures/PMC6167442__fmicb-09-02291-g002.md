caption: Detailed diagram for fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis in C. trachomatis.
  From Yao et al. (). This figure shows the protein name designations along with the
  C. trachomatis gene locus number for each reaction. The biosynthetic pathway is
  divided into four modules. The initiation module consists of the enzymes that supply
  the precursors to initiate FASII. The elongation module sequentially elongates the
  acyl chain. The acyltransfer module extracts acyl-ACP from the elongation cycle
  to acylate glycerol-phosphate. The phospholipid module diversifies the headgroups
  to produce PE, PG, and CL. Despite a few minor quirks such as the plastidial related
  enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) and 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (PlsE),
  fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis in C. trachomatis is the same as other free-living
  bacteria such as E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
