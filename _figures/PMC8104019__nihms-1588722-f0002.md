caption: The KCC2 co-transporter is a ~140 kDa protein with 12 transmembrane domains,
  a cytoplasmic N-terminal, a large extracellular loop, and a large cytoplasmic C-terminal.
  Phosphorylation residues regulated by WNK-SPAK pathway, which suppresses KCC2 activity,
  are indicated in red. Phosphorylation site regulated by neurotransmitters-GPCRs-PLC-PKC
  pathway, which increases KCC2 activity, is indicated in green. Missense variants
  of SLC12A5 that impair KCC2 function in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy
  are indicated in yellow.
