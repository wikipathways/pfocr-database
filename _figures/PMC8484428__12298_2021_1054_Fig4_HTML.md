caption: Conserved genes assigned to the phytohormone signaling pathways. This figure
  wasadapted from the phytohormone signaling pathways in the KEGG pathway. The gene
  expression levels in P. × euramericana (Pe) and P. simonii (Ps) of each time point
  during AR formation are shown in different columns in the colored grids, and the
  different rows represent the different genes. The colors indicate the levels of
  gene expression with red representing upregulation and blue representing downregulation.
  The gene expression levels of Pe and Ps during the different time points were normalized
  to 0 days after excision (DAE0) of the corresponding poplar species
