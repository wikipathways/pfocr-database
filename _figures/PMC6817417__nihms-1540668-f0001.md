caption: PI3K/Akt signaling pathway regulated by PTEN. Different types of molecular
  mediators that were discussed in the present article were represented here. The
  approaches tested, and the type of regulatory molecules developed were shown at
  the target protein in the signaling pathway. The boxes and letters were highlighted
  in red to represent the type of inhibitory approach used which was discussed in
  the text. The highlights in green color represents that initiation or induction
  of the target protein was used to regulate the signaling pathway.
