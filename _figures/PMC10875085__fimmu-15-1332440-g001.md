caption: Schematic diagram of mechanisms for S protein-induced lung injury. (A) S
  protein binds with ACE2, leading to ACE2 shedding and downregulation. Reduced ACE2
  promotes the activation of Ang II/angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)/NF-κB/NOX1/2
  pathway, leading to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS enhances apoptosis
  of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells, resulting in barrier dysfunction
  and edema. Activated AT1R also activates NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)
  inflammasome in alveolar macrophages and triggers cell apoptosis and cytokine storm.
  (B) S protein activates Toll-like receptors such as TLR4 through binding of lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) and enhances NF-κB activity, resulting in activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  and cytokine storm. (C) S protein promotes M1 polarization of alveolar macrophages
  through binding to ACE2, which enhances the proinflammatory response. (D) S protein
  reduces mitophagy through binding to ACE2, resulting in activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  and cell apoptosis. (E) S protein binds to ACE2 and triggers activation of STAT3,
  MAP kinases (MAPK), and NF-κB via other unidentified mechanisms, leading to cytokine
  storm and neutrophil infiltration. (F) S protein triggers vascular leak and edema
  independent of ACE2 binding. S protein binds with glycosaminoglycans and integrins,
  which leads to the activation of TGF-β signaling pathway and barrier dysfunction
