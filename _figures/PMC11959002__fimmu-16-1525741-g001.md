caption: ncRNAs inhibit PCa metastasis through the PAM signaling pathway. This figure
  illustrates that ncRNAs associated with the PAM signaling pathway inhibit PCa metastasis
  by regulating invasion, migration, anoikis, and EMT. Blue represents the role of
  suppressing the PAM signaling pathway. Red represents roles that facilitate the
  PAM signaling pathway. Cyan color represents an association with invasion and migration,
  purple color represents an association with EMT, and light red color represents
  an association with anoikis
