caption: Schematic representation of potexvirus interactions with plant UPR, ERAD,
  and cell death pathways. VRCs, originating from the ER and Golgi, interact with
  plasmodesmata or aggregate into perinuclear X-bodies. TGB1 protein aggregates induce
  membrane rearrangements to form the core of X-body, which may cause ER stress and
  potentially trigger the UPR. Meanwhile, the viral TGB3 protein, an ER-associated
  protein, directly activates the IRE1-and bZIP60-mediated pathways. TGB3 interacts
  with unbZIP60, both of which are targeted for degradation via ERAD. In addition,
  BAG7 and NAC089 participate in pattern-triggered immunity signaling and the regulation
  of PCD. Other forms of PCD may be induced through the combinatorial actions of TGB1
  and HC-Pro. The ER-resident chaperone BiPs play a critical role in maintaining ER
  homeostasis during ER stress and protecting plant cells from PCD. BiP, binding immunoglobulin
  protein; bzip60, basic leucine zipper 60; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated
  protein degradation; IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme 1; PCD, programmed cell death;
  TGB1, triple gene block 1; unbZIP60, unspliced bZIP60; UPR, unfolded protein response;
  VRC, viral replication complex
