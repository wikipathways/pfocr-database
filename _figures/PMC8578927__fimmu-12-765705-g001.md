caption: NK Cells Exert a Range of Direct and Indirect Antitumor Effects. NK cell
  activation is governed by the net balance between signals received through various
  activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors. When the balance is tipped towards
  activation, NK cells can directly lyse target cells through release of the preformed
  cytotoxic granules granzyme B and perforin (natural killing) or by the engagement
  of target cell death receptors by NK cell-expressed death receptor ligands TRAIL
  and FasL (death receptor pathway). Antibody opsonized target cells may also be directly
  lysed through engagement of the NK cell IgG Fc region receptor III (FcγRIII; CD16)
  in a process of antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Activated
  NK cells are also potent producers of immunomodulatory cytokines (such as interferon
  gamma (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor (GM-CSF)) and chemokines (including interleukin-8 (IL-8), CCL5, and XCL1)
  which activate and recruit other immune cells to the tumor microenvironment, indirectly
  driving a multifaceted antitumor response. Created with (Biorender.com).
