caption: The inner logic of the TOL regulatory network. (a) Layout of a canonical
  type I coherent Feed Forward Loop (FFL). In such a motif, a master regulator × activates
  expression of a target Z both directly and indirectly. Indirect regulation takes
  through activation of a second transcriptional factor Y which in turn has Z as a
  target as well. SX and SY are the signals which trigger the activity of × and Y,
  respectively. The ara operon is shown as an example of this type of FFL, as its
  expression depends on the interplay between the CRP and AraC regulators, cAMP and
  arabinose being the SX and SY inducers respectively. (b) Metabolic Amplifier Motif
  (MAM) found in the TOL network. Compared to the type-I FFL motif, the indirect regulation
  of Z through the X→Y node remains, but the direct interaction X→Y makes a detour
  that involves a metabolic (rather than regulatory) action. Specifically, the master
  regulator × now activates the production of an enzyme (or a metabolic pathway) W,
  which converts the signal SX into SY. In the TOL system, × and Y are represented
  by XylR and XylS, while m-xylene (SX) is converted to 3 MBz (SY) by the action of
  the upper pathway.

  stems from a metabolic amplifier motif (MAM) that optimizes biodegradation of m-xylene.
