caption: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) life cycle in human lung cells. COVID-19
  entry into cells when S protein binds to ACE2 receptor (1). After docking, the S
  protein conformation is changed, which facilitates virus entry into the endosomal
  pathway (2). Then, COVID-19 virus releases RNA into the cell or/and COVID-19 virus
  components may be directed into MVBs/exosomes (3). Virus RNA is translated into
  viral replicas polyproteins pp1a and 1ab, which are then cleaved into viral components
  by viral proteinases. Viral proteins and RNA are subsequently assembled into virions
  in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (4 and 5) and then released out of the cell
  via exocytosis or directed into exosomes (6). Upon entry, COVID-19 virus may be
  directed into the exosomal pathway, and its component is sorted into exosomes for
  secretion and spreading (steps 3 and 6). Extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles)
  may contribute to spread this virus as they transfer such receptors as CD9 and ACE2,
  which make recipient cells susceptible for virus docking. ACE2, angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2; EE, early endosome; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GA, Golgi apparatus; MVB,
  multivesicular body; N, nucleus.
