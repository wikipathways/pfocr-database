caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of Epo action. (A) After hypoxia, the production of
  HIF determines an augmented synthesis of Epo which binds to its transmembrane receptor
  EpoR. The cytoplasmic tail of the Epo-EpoR complex phosphorylates JAK2, which activates
  a complex cascade of signalling pathways. The activation of PI3K/AKT pathway leads
  to the increase of eNOS activity in endothelial cells, determining augmented levels
  of NO and cerebral vasodilation. PI3K/AKT, together with NF-kb, STAT-5 and RAS pathways,
  reduces inflammation, oxidation and apoptosis acting both at nuclear and intramitochondrial
  levels. Moreover, MAPK and PKC mediated mechanisms promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis
  in damaged tissues. Neurogenesis, especially oligodendrogenesis, facilitates the
  process of remyelination and axonal repair, while angiogenesis permits flow restoration
  and migration of neuronal progenitors in the ischemic areas. The erythropoietic
  effect of Epo-EpoR binding is an additional antioxidant mechanism, increasing iron
  utilization resulting in a lower iron oxidant potential. JAK-2: Janus-tyrosine-kinase-2;
  PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT: v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog;
  eNOS: endothelial nitric oxide synthase; NO: nitric oxide; NF-kb: nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; STAT-5: signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 5; RAS: rat sarcoma; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKC:
