caption: Phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (pGSK-3β) and canonical WNT/β-catenin
  signaling in “on” state. The canonical WNT pathway is “on-state” in the presence
  of the inactive phosphorylated form of the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (pGSK-3β).
  Phosphorylation of GSK-3β can be induced either by WNT ligands or by other molecular
  mechanisms and particularly by light. On the one hand, a WNT ligand binds both FZD
  and LRP5/6 receptors. GSK-3β is then under the inactive phosphorylated form pGSK-3β.
  This leads to activation of the phosphoprotein Disheveled (DSH). DSH recruits the
  destruction complex (pGSK-3β + AXIN +APC) to the plasma membrane, where AXIN directly
  binds the cytoplasmic tail of LRP5/6. APC is the adenomatous polyposis coli. On
  the other hand, expression of pGSK-3β follows a circadian rhythm and reaches a maximum
  in the morning at ZT2. In both mechanisms, β-catenin is detached from the destruction
  complex, accumulates into the cytosol, and then translocates to the nucleus to bind
  the LEF-TCF co-transcription factors. This induces the WNT-response gene transcription
  of numerous genes such as EAAT2, GS, and cMYC. This favors the re-uptake of glutamate
  from the synaptic cleft to the cytoplasm of astrocytes. This leads to a decrease
  of glutamate content in the synaptic cleft and a decrease of the activation of NMDA-R
  and AMPA-R, which are receptors located in the synaptic part of the glutamatergic
  post-synaptic neuron. SCN neurons project to the NTS via PVN and consequently decrease
  the parasympathetic tone and increase the sympathetic tone which favors the increase
  in BP in the morning when the expression of pGSK-3β is increased. β-Catenin increases
  the expression of cMYC. cMYC stimulates GS. Glutamine in the SCM astrocyte cytoplasm
  stimulates the PI3K-Akt pathway. The PI3K-Akt pathway phosphorylates GSK-3β
