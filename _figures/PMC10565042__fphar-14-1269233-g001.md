caption: 'The diverse types and molecular mechanisms of the Wnt signaling pathway.
  This diagram illustrates the classification and members of the Wnt signaling pathway.
  The Wnt signaling pathway can be categorized into three classes: (1) Wnt/β-catenin
  signal transduction, (2) Wnt/PCP signal transduction, (3) Wnt/Ca2+ signal transduction.
  In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled receptors and LRP co-receptors,
  leading to the activation of the disheveled protein and subsequent inactivation
  of Axin protein. This results in the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm,
  its translocation into the nucleus, and binding to TCF/LEF transcription factors,
  ultimately inducing downstream gene expression. Wnt/PCP signaling pathway involved
  in cell polarity, tissue morphogenesis, cell adhesion, and directional migration
  through JNK and Rho GTPase signaling pathways. The Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway modulates
  gene expression and cell behavior by regulating intracellular Ca2+ levels. Abbreviations:
  Wnt, Wingless-related integration site; LRP, Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein; GSK3β, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; CKIα, Casein kinase I alpha; Axin,
