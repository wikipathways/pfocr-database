caption: Model depicting the differential functions of LRP1 (A) and LRP1B (B) in endocytosis
  of APP. (A) The fast endocytosis of LRP1 enhances APP endocytosis and, therefore,
  promotes the proteolytic processing of APP through the amyloidogenic pathway. Once
  delivered to the endosomes, APP is firstly cleaved by a β-secretase, producing a
  soluble β-cleaved APP fragment (sAPP-β) and a carboxyl-terminal β fragment (CTF-β).
  This fragment is further cleaved by a γ-secretase, producing the highly toxic amyloid
  β-peptide (Aβ) and the APP intracellular domain. Most of the Aβ peptides are secreted
  to the extracellular space, where they can rapidly aggregate and form fibrils that
  deposit into the amyloid plaques (which are associated with the progression of Alzheimer’s
  disease). (B) The slow endocytosis of LRP1B decreases APP endocytosis and, therefore,
  promotes the proteolytic processing of APP through the non-amyloidogenic pathway.
  At the cell surface, APP is firstly cleaved by an α-secretase, producing a soluble
  α-cleaved APP fragment (sAPP-α) and a carboxyl-terminal α fragment (CTF-α). This
  fragment can be further cleaved by a γ-secretase, producing the non-toxic peptide
  P3 and the APP intracellular domain.
