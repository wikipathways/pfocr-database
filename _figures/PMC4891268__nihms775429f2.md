caption: Cell-cycle entry regulated by a network of protein regulators. The entry
  of a quiescent cell into the G1 phase of the cell cycle requires signals from extracellular
  growth factors, which elicit a cascade of signaling events, mainly the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway, and ultimately result in the regulation of the core cell-cycle machinery,
  the cyclin D–Cdk4/6 complex. CDK inhibitors, such as Ink4 proteins and p21, counteract
  the cyclin–cdk activity.
