caption: TGR5 regulates inflammation to improve vascular endothelial dysfunction in
  DR. TGR5 activation can in turn activate the cAMP-PKA pathway through the cAMP pathway,
  which leads to the upregulation of the expression and the activity levels of CREB,
  ultimately causing downregulation of the expression levels of IL-1β and IL-6 and
  upregulation of the expression of IL-10. Stimulation of the TGR5-Rho-ROCK pathway
  and GLP-1 secretion can inhibit inflammatory transforming factor production and
  the inflammatory response (shown by the red downward arrows in the figure), ultimately
  delaying EC injury. TGR5, Takeda G protein-coupled receptor; DR, diabetic retinopathy;
  EC, endothelial cell; cAMP, cyclin AMP; PKA, protein kinase A; CREB, cAMP response
  element binding protein; ROCK, Rho-associated protein kinase; GLP-1, glucagon-like
  peptide-1.
