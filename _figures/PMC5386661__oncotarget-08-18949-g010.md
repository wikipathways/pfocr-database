caption: Based on the outcomes of this study, we propose a model whereby androgen
  receptor pathway inhibition triggers a developmental reprogramming process that
  results in a metastable cancer stem-like state that resembles neural/neural crest
  stem cells. These N/NC stem-like cells may acquire features of differentiated N/NC
  derived cell lineages when placed into cell-specific differentiation mediums. Depending
  on the cellular microenvironment, these developmentally reprogrammed cells may transdifferentiate
  to neuroendocrine-like or other therapy resistant PCa cell types.
