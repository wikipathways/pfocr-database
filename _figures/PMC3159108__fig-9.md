caption: A putative model integrating lipid peroxidation, phospholipids turnover,
  AA signaling, and SZ symptomatology. As shown, several possible mechanisms can lead
  to increased phospholipid breakdown and AA release, including decreased AA incorporation
  and increased phospholipase activities (PLA2 and PLC), possibly resulting from increased
  oxidative stress and cytokine release. The resulting changes in AA level could then
  affect more downstream processes, including neurodevelopment via growth-associated
  protein (GAP)-43, neurotransmitter homeostasis, phosphatidylinositol signaling,
  and neuromodulatory actions of endocannabinoids. It is proposed that the specific
  behavioral symptomatology of SZ is related mostly to the effect of AA changes on
  the neurochemistry of deaminase, glutamate release, and circulating levels of the
  endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). In addition, alterations
  in AA may also affect the inflammatory response, which can then affect PLA2 release
  via cytokines, further exacerbating phospholipid turnover and AA release. Hence,
  in the current conceptualization, AA is at a nexus point in the cascade leading
  to the syndrome of SZ, and represents a common biochemical pathway leading to the
  highly heterogeneous symptomatology of psychosis. Reprinted with permission from
