caption: Two NetPocos associated with Bipolar Disorder (BD). These NetPocos are consistently
  selected by L1 regularized logistic regression in the final model for risk prediction.
  The circle nodes represent proteins and rectangular nodes represent SNPs. Red dashed
  lines represent the eQTL association between a SNP and a gene, purple lines indicate
  that a SNP is in the ROI of the respective gene, and the blue edges represent a
  protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the products of respective genes. The
  genes that are previously reported to be associated with CAD are highlighted in
  gold. (a) A NetPoco enriched in regulation of dopamin metabolic process which plays
  a central role in bipolar disorder (p-value = 8.67e-6), (b) a NetPoco enriched in
  regulation of neurotrasmitter secretion and insulin receptor signaling pathway (p-value
  = 0.0007).
