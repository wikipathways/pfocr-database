caption: Inhibitory pathway of PGE2 in effector T cells. PGE2 mediates Treg inhibition
  of effector T cell function through a PKA-mediated pathway. (A) In response to continuous
  antigen exposure, for instance in cancer and HIV, adaptive regulatory T cells express
  COX-2 and produce PGE2, which stimulates FOXP3 expression in these cells. The Treg-derived
  PGE2 can signal through the EP2 and EP4 receptors on effector T cells to inhibit
  the function of these cells through the pathway shown in (B). Binding of PGE2 to
  its receptors on effector T cells stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity, which increases
  intracellular cAMP levels and thus activates PKA. Aided by an Ezrin-EBP50-PAG scaffold,
  PKA phosphorylates Csk, which in turn phosphorylates Lck to inhibit its activity.
  Lck normally acts to promote TCR signaling; thus Lck inhibition through this PGE2-initiated
  pathway inhibits TCR signaling in effector T cells.
