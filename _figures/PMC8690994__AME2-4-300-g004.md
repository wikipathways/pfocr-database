caption: The inhibition and activation of the HIF pathway at different oxygen concentrations.
  During nonhypoxic state, PHDs hydroxylate the HIF‐α subunit at the proline residues.
  The hydroxylated HIF‐α binds to VHL, leading to proteasomal degradation of HIF‐α
  subunit; FIH‐1 prevents the binding of an important coactivator p300/Creb‐binding
  protein (CBP/p300) to the HIF‐α subunit, both of which prevents the activation of
  the HIF complex. When exposed to hypoxia, the low oxygen level inactivates PHDs
  and FIHs, thus the HIF‐α subunit binds to its β subunit and activates the signaling
  pathway. HIF, hypoxia inducible factor; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase; FIH, factor inhibiting
  HIF (FIH‐1); VHL, Von Hippel Lindau protein
