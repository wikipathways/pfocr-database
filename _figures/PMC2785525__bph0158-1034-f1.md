caption: The Anticoagulant APC Pathway. TF is the major initiator of the coagulation
  cascade and can be up-regulated under inflammatory conditions. The activation of
  the coagulation cascade leads to the formation of thrombin (IIa) and fibrin. Thrombin
  and fibrin are responsible for the pro-inflammatory effects of coagulation. Thrombin
  signals through PAR-1 to exert its detrimental effects. APC is generated from the
  circulating protein C zymogen. Thrombin bound to TM activates protein C. Binding
  of protein C to the EPCR is responsible for a more efficient activation. After dissociation
  from EPCR, APC can exert its anticoagulant function. APC cleaves the activated coagulation
  factors FVa and FVIIIa that become inactive. APC further inactivates the PAI-1 resulting
  in increased fibrinolysis. These anticoagulant and pro-fibrinolytic characteristics
  are responsible for the indirect protective effects of APC during inflammatory disorders.
  APC bound to EPCR is responsible for its direct cytoprotective effects involving
  PAR-1 signalling. APC, activated protein C; EPCR, endothelial protein C receptor;
  PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; PAR-1, protease-activated receptor-1;
  t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; TF, tissue factor; TM, thrombomodulin.
