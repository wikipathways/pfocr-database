caption: Metabolic reprogramming in HCC. Glucose enters the cancer cell via glucose
  transporters 1 and 2 (GLUT1 and GLUT2), and it is mainly used in the glycolytic
  pathway due to the overexpression of enzymes such as hexokinase 2 (HK2) and hexokinase
  domain containing 1 (HKDC1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and
  pyruvate kinase 2 (PK2). The glycolytic pathway mainly produces, by the overexpression
  of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) isoform, lactate (Lac) which is transported outside
  of the cell mainly throughout the monocarboxylate transporter isoform 4 (MCT4).
  Fatty acids enter cancer cells thanks to the upregulation of fatty acid translocase
  CD36. Nevertheless, fatty acid synthesis can also start from acetate (Ace), which
  is transported in the cell by MCT and converted into acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) by the
  mitochondrial isoform of acetyl-CoA synthase 1 (ACSS1). Moreover, glutamine (Gln)
  takes part in lipid synthesis after conversion into glutamate by mitochondrial glutaminase
  enzymes (GLS/GLS2). Glutamate is then converted into α-ketoglutarate (αKG) which
  can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Alternatively, αKG can undergo a reductive
  carboxylation by which it is transformed in citrate in the mitochondria (red arrow)
  or in the cytosol. In glutamine-free conditions, pyruvate (Pyr) can be converted
  into oxaloacetate (OAA) by the anaplerotic reaction catalysed by pyruvate carboxylase
  (PyC) enzyme. The de novo fatty acids synthesis is increased in cancer cells, and
  it is associated with a high expression of key enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). This latter metabolic pathway is associated
  to a high production of reducing equivalents in the form of reduced nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) that is mainly produced in the first reaction
  of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) catalysed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD) and by the malic enzyme (ME).
