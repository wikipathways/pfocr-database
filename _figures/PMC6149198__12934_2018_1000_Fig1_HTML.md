caption: Flux distribution in central metabolism of control 101a (SPT15WT) and mutant
  102a (spt15_Ala101Thr) strain without transcriptomic changes. Fluxes are simulated
  with iMM904 model using experimentally determined constraints for S. cerevisiae
  strain carrying either SPT15WT plasmid (Control 101a strain) or spt15_Ala101Thr
  plasmid (mutant 102a strain). Fluxes in wild type and mutant are shown in black
  and red colours. The metabolites showing major changes are underlined. Glyoxylate
  cycle which is present only in mutant strain is shown in blue colour
papertitle: Role of phosphate limitation and pyruvate decarboxylase in rewiring of
  the metabolic network for increasing flux towards isoprenoid pathway in a TATA binding
  protein mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
