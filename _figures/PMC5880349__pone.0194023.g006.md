caption: Both endocrine sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells express all components
  of the RET signaling pathway, but endocrine sensitive breast cancer cells lack GDNF
  to initiate the resistance pathway. By contrast, endocrine resistant cells secret
  GNDF, which acts in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to promote endocrine resistance
  in nearby cells.

  resistance.
