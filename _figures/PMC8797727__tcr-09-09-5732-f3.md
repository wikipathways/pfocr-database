caption: Genetics and signaling of p16/ARF locus. P16 and ARF mRNAs arise from the
  same locus but encode distinct peptides. p16 is encoded from exons 1a, 2, and 3
  and ARF from exons 1b, 2, and 3. p16 is an inhibitor of cell-cycle dependent kinases
  CDK 4/6 and induces senescence through that pathway. ARF can also induce senescence
  but acts through the p53 pathway.
