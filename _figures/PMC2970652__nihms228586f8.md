caption: Aβ attenuates mTORC1 signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of mTOR (1),
  thus causing a decrease in the expression of leptin (2). Reduced expression levels
  of leptin are accompanied by a reduction in phosphorylation of leptin receptor (p-Tyr1138
  ObRb) (3). Aβ also increases SOCS-3 expression levels (4), an effect that may also
  cause a reduction in levels of p-Tyr1138 ObRb (5). Reduced levels p-Tyr1138 ObRb
  leads to decreased activation of AkT (6), subsequently resulting in the activation
  of GSK-3β (7). Activation of GSK-3β results in increased phosphorylation of tau
  (p-tau) (8). Attenuated AkT activation can also reduce mTORC1 activation (9), an
  effect that may further reduce leptin expression (2). It is also possible that Aβ
  regulates leptin signaling via other mechanisms independent of mTORC1 and SOCS-3.
