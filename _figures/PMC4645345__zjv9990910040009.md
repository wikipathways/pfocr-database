caption: Proposed mechanism for SCG2 expression in HSV- and reovirus-infected cells.
  Known avian reovirus AP-1 activation pathway molecules are shown in purple and blue.
  The proposed mammalian reovirus pathway is shown in red. The HSV signaling pathway
  is shown in green (based upon data reported in the literature and in this study).
