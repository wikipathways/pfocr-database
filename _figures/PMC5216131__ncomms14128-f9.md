caption: Various death stimuli or viral infection can lead to permeabilization of
  the outer mitochondrial membrane causing the release of cytochrome c, which binds
  to Apaf-1 leading to assembly of the Apaf-1 apoptosome and activation of caspase-9.
  Within this complex active caspase-9 cleaves procaspase-3 to generate the active
  caspase-3 heterodimer. Active caspase-3 in turns cleaves DFNA5 at Asp270 to generate
  the necrotic DFNA5-N fragment which permeabilizes the plasma membrane by forming
  large pores causing osmotic lysis of the cell and releasing cellular contents including
  pro-inflammatory mediators and alamins, into the extracellular space. Caspase-3
  can also be activated by the death receptor pathway, which is activated by death
  receptor ligands at the cell membrane. This pathway can potentially lead to caspase-3-mediated
  processing of DFNA5 and secondary necrosis.
