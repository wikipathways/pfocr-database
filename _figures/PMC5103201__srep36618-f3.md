caption: '(a) Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis. (b) Shown are relative changes
  of metabolite levels in glycolysis, PPP, purine metabolism, and TCA cycle comparing
  non-treated (blue) and IS-treated (red) C2C12 cell extracts. Data are mean ± SD
  (n = 3), *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.0001, difference with control by unpaired
  t-test. Vertical axis shows absolute value (pmol/106 cells). G6P: glucose 6-phosphate;
  F6P: fructose 6-phosphate; F1,6P: fructose 1,6-diphosphate; GA3P: glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; 3-PG: 3-phosphoglyceric acid; 2-PG: 2-phosphoglyceric acid; PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate;
  6-PG: 6-phosphogluconate; Ru5P: ribulose 5-phosphate; PRPP: phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate;
  X5P: xylulose 5-phosphate; S7P: sedoheptulose 7-phosphate; E4P: erythrose 4-phosphate;
  IMP: inosine monophosphate; HXA: hypoxanthine; XA: xanthine. (c) Shown are total
  glutathione (GSH + 2GSSG) level, GSH/GSSG ratio, lactate/pyruvate ratio, G6P/R5P
  ratio, glutamine/2-OG ratio, total Glu-related amino acids, malate/aspartic acid
  ratio, and total oxaloacetate-related amino acid level comparing non-treated (blue)
  and IS-treated (red) C2C12 cell extracts. Data are mean ± SD (n = 3), *p < 0.05,
  **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.0001, difference with control by Welch t-test. Vertical axis
  shows absolute value (pmol/106 cells).'
