caption: The mTOR signaling pathway is involved in liver IR injury and plays crucial
  roles in autophagy. Growth factors such as insulin activates mTORC1 through the
  PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway. However, the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway will
  lead to the inhibition of mTORC1 through activating TSC complex. Hypoxia/ischemia,
  oxidative stress, and DNA damage are mechanisms commonly involved in liver IR injury.
  The decrease of ATP induced by hypoxia/ischemia activates AMPK, which inhibits mTORC1
  through activating TSC or suppressing mTOR directly. Additionally, hypoxia/ischemia
  also activates REDD1, which promotes the TSC-mediated suppression of mTOR. Oxidative
  stress induces the activation of ATM, which inhibits mTORC1 through activating TSC
  directly or through phosphorylating HIF1α, resulting in induction of REDD1, causing
  the activation of TSC. Besides, oxidative stress promotes the activation of AP-1,
  which transcriptionally upregulates the expression of REDD1. Finally, DNA damage
  inhibits mTOR through inducing PTEN, AMPKβ1, and TSC, which are targeted by p53.
  mTOR signaling plays a crucial and complex role in autophagy. In the initial phase
  of autophagy, mTORC1 inhibits ULK1 complex (ULK1/Atg13/ATG101/FIP200) via directly
  phosphorylating ULK1 and ATG13. Besides, mTORC1 can also inhibit ULK complex through
  phosphorylating and suppressing AMBRA, which enhances the activity and stability
  of ULK1. Additionally, mTORC1 represses the initial of autophagy also through inhibiting
  VPS34 complex (VPS34/VPS15/Beclin1/ATG14/NRBF2) by directly phosphorylating ATG14
  and NRBF2. In the elongation/closure phase, mTORC1 suppresses autophagic and lysosomal
  biogenesis through phosphorylating TFEB and TFE3 to modulate their nuclear-cytoplasmic
  shuttling. Moreover, mTORC1 can also augment autophagy through phosphorylating DAP1,
  which acts as a buffering mechanism that counterbalances the autophagic flux and
  prevents its overactivation. Additionally, mTORC2 also participated in the induction
  of autophagy through an unclear mechanism.
