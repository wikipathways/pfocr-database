caption: Regulation of smooth muscle contractility. Uterine stimulants generally stimulate
  specific G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) on the myocyte membrane. This triggers
  two stimulatory pathways. The Gαq subunit activates phospholipase C (PLC) in the
  adjacent membrane and this results in hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositides to
  from inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol, which can activate protein
  kinase C (PKC; see text). IP3 stimulates release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
  and the resulting decrease in cell membrane resting potential leads to massive influx
  of Ca2+ from the extracellular space through voltage–gated L-type Ca2+-channels.
  Ca2+ binds to calmodulin (CaM). The Ca2+-CaM complex interacts with and activates
  myosin regulatory light chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK mediates the phosphorylation of
  myosin regulatory lights chains (RLC) and initiates the contractile apparatus. The
  second stimulatory pathway is mediated through Gα12-14. This causes activation of
  a guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which activates membrane rhoA-GDP
  by substituting GTP for the GDP. The rhoA-GTP activates rhoA-associated kinase (ROK).
  ROK phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain phosphatase (MLCP), which inhibits
  its activity. Since MLCP is normally responsible for removing the phosphate from
  pRLC to cause uterine relaxation, enhanced ROK activity prolongs the effectiveness
  of pRLC and promotes enhanced contractile activity. The major inhibitory pathways
  might also be mediated by GPCR, linked through Gαs resulting in activation of adenylate
  cyclase (AC) or direct activation of guanylate cyclase (GC), which in turn activates
  protein kinase A (PKA) or PKG. These kinases inhibit contractility through a variety
  of mechanisms described in the text. The green lines indicate stimulatory activity
  and the red lines inhibitory. The broken line indicates an indirect effect.
