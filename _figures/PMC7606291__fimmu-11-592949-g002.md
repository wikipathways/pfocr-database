caption: TBK1 regulates inflammation and energy metabolism in adipocytes. TBK1 activity
  is induced by proinflammatory stimuli and undernutrition. Although TBK1 is not directly
  involved in TNFα-induced activation of NFκB, active TBK1 phosphorylates NIK to induce
  its degradation and thus attenuates atypical NFκB pathway in a negative feedback
  loop. Moreover, TBK1 inhibits AMPK to repress energy expenditure in adipocytes.
  AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; NIK, NFκB inducing kinase.
