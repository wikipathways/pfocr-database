caption: Schematic of SIRM workflow for tracer experiments. Cells were cultivated
  in [U- 13C] glucose tracer containing RPMI medium supplemented with 0.5 µM AZD8186
  or vehicle. After 1, 3, 6, and 24 h cells were harvested according to an optimized
  quench and extraction protocol. Cell extracts were measured with LC-QTOF-MS and
  the obtained data analyzed in a targeted as well as untargeted manner. Targeted
  data analysis was performed with the MassHunter Profinder software environment and
  harnessed a metabolite library with corresponding sum formulas, masses, and retention
  times. Untargeted analysis with X13CMS () produced a list of differentially labeled
  metabolites between drug treated and control conditions. Fragment spectra from unlabeled
  cell extracts allowed the assignment of potential candidate structures from the
  X13CMS feature list. Metabolite identity was confirmed by the corresponding pure
  substance, its retention time, and fragment spectra. Finally, the identified metabolites
  were integrated into the targeted SIRM workflow.
