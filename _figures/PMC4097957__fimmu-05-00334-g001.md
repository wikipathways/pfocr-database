caption: The TLR4 signaling pathway. TLR4 is activated by LPS, whereas CD14 and MD2
  act as accessory proteins for LPS/TLR4 binding. Upon ligand binding, TLR4 dimerizes,
  and recruits downstream adaptor molecules such as MyD88/MAL and TRIF/TRAM to mount
  an inflammatory response. The activated MyD88/MAL then activates IRAK4, TRAF6, TAK1,
  and IKK complexes, while TRIF/TRAM signals through RIP1 to TRAF6/TAK1 and IKK. After
  this, both these pathways converge at NF-κB. The cytoplasmic NF-κB complex is maintained
  in the inactive state by IκB, which is in turn degraded by proteasomes, resulting
  in the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus. Besides activating NF-κB, TAK1 also
  phosphorylates MAPKs to further reinforce the inflammatory response. The TRIF/TRAM
  pathway not only activates NF-κB but also triggers IRF3 to mount an antiviral response.
  Cumulatively, all these signaling pathways assist in eradicating infection as well
  as play an important role in sustaining the normal physiological functions in IECs.
