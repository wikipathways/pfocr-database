caption: Biosynthesis pathways of steroid hormones. All steroids are derived from
  cholesterol, which is first converted into pregnenolone and progestogens. Progesterone
  is the major steroid of the progestogen pathway. This hormone can be converted to
  androstenedione, then to testosterone. Testosterone is the main steroid in the androgen
  pathway. This steroid is a precursor to the estrogenic pathway, in which estradiol
  is the main steroid. The corticoid pathway is derived from the progestogen pathway,
  with mineralocorticoids (corticosterone) and glucocorticoids (cortisol). CYP, Cytochrome
