caption: (a). SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE-2 receptor, followed by spike protein cleavage,
  membrane fusion, and endocytosis. RNA of single-stranded RNA viruses activates the
  Toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8. Double-stranded RNA intermediates are recognized
  by TLR3. TLR activation triggers transcription of the interferon-regulator factor
  (IRF) family, but also the activation of IKK (IκB kinases), phosphorylation, ubiquitination,
  and proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor factor IκBα, and release
  of the NF-κB (p50/p65) to enter the nucleus. The final sequence of NF-κB activation
  is shared with multiple cytokine receptor- and TLR-mediated signal cascades, e.g.,
  binding of TNFα or IL-1 to their receptors or binding of LPS to TLR4. Additionally,
  SARS-CoV-2 leads to TLR4-mediated and ER stress-induced NF-κB activation. NF-κB
  activation triggers gene expression for multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  chemokines (with a typical M1/Th1 polarization pattern), adhesion molecules, and
  acute phase proteins. Released cytokines feed into accelerating feedback loops.
  In contrast, interferon-response factor (IRF)-related responses are largely independent
  of NF-κB translocation (a, red transparent area). Metabolic disorders, e.g., obesity
  and diabetes, lead to chronic NF-κB pre-activation via hyperglycemia-induced IKKβ
  overexpression, Protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and advanced glycosylation end
  products (AGEs) that bind to receptors for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGE)
  on vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to oxidant stress. NF-κB triggered cytokine
  (TNFα, IL-1β) expression feeds into accelerating feedback loops via TNFα/IL-1β receptor-triggered
  NF-κB activation and increased expression of RAGE (a, blue transparent area). Aging-related
  genotoxicity, inflammation, ER stress, and oxidative stress stimulate the NF-κB
  pathway. An “inflamm-aging”-associated dysregulation of cytokine homeostasis feeds
  into auto amplifying loops, enhancing the COVID-19-triggered acute NF-κB activation
  storm (a, yellow transparent area). The anti-helminth drug ivermectin and the anti-malaria
  drug artemisinin inhibit the NF-κB pathway at various steps, with artemisinin (a
  proteasome inhibitor) blocking the degradation of IκBα and the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB. (b). Helminth infection induces M2/Th2 predisposition, Treg, and immunosuppressive
  cytokines IL-10 and TGFβ (b, green transparent area), which can counteract SARS-CoV-2-triggered
  NF-κB-mediated M1/Th1 polarization (a,b, green inserts). Duffy receptor-mediated
  transport and transcytosis of chemokines can enhance the migration, adhesion, and
  extravasation of macrophages and neutrophils even at sites distant to the initially
  SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (b, red transparent area), leading to the activation and
  damage of endothelial cells, vascular leakage, pulmonary edema, thromboembolism,
  and multiorgan endotheliitis (b, red insert). This effect may be reduced in geographical
  areas with prevalent DARC negativity. (a) represents a modification of  previously
  published in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33362782/ accessed on 8 September 2021.
