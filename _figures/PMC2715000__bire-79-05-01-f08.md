caption: Summary of caspase 2-mediated signaling cascades in heat-induced germ cell
  apoptosis. Activation of caspase 2 after heat stress results in activation of MAPK14
  and NOS2 induction. It is likely that activation of such signaling cascade perturbs
  the BAX/BCL2 rheostat in the mitochondria [, , ] and triggers the cytochrome c (Cyt.c)-mediated
  death pathway. Caspase 2-mediated signaling could also activate heat-induced germ
  cell apoptosis by targeting mitochondria directly, possibly through a decline in
  cellular metabolism (dotted line).
