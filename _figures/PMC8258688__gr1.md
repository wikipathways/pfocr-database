caption: Synthesis of nucleotide-bound rhamnose in bacteria and fungi. In bacteria
  the biosyntethic pathway involves four different enzymes (RmlA, RmlB, RmlC and RmlD)
  and starts with glucose as precursor. The main differences in fungi are the precursor,
  UDP-glucose in this case, and that the last two steps in the synthesis are carried
  out by a single enzyme with bifunctional activity (epimerase and reductase).
